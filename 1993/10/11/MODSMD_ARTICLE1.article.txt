# Health reform prompts questions, changes at Med Center
## 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
President Clinton's health care plan
pledges to bring relief to millions, but it
has caused concern for many others, in
cluding some at Stanford's Medical Cen
ter.
Short on details, the Clinton plan has
raised more questions than it has an
swered in the minds of many health care
providers. In the medical community,
many support the idea that everyone
should have health care. At the same
time, other care-givers worry about the
plan's lack of specifics — especially about

funding — and wonder if they are going
to lose autonomy or income.
Because academic medical centers —
like Stanford's massive medical facility
— treat many indigent patients, under
take advanced research and treatment,
and support a medical school as well as
hospitals, costs at academic centers are
higher than at most hospitals. In a new
system that places a premium on cost-ef
ficiency, such high overhead costs could
cause extra headaches, Stanford experts
say.
"It's a bold plan, it's an ambitious
plan ... it has dimensions to it that I find
very exciting and support" — such as of-

fering greater access to
health care, said Ken
neth Bloem, president
of Stanford Hospital.
But Bloem said he is
concerned about parts
of the plan, especially its
"relative muteness on
support for academic
medical centers.
"The academic med-

ical center is the soul of American health
care in many ways," he said. "The acade
mic medical center is not squarely in the
center of the Clinton plan. This poses a
major concern for me."

The Clinton draft plan does briefly ad
dress academic health centers as a
unique issue. It recognizes the extra
costs academic institutions face, and
promises to create a funding pool, esti
mated at $6 billion in 1994, to support
advanced research and treatment, and
provide other funding help.
Still, details on the funding are practi
cally non-existent. The draft plan de
votes little more than a dozen para
graphs out of a several-hundred page re
port to the issue.
So, faced with a major change and few
details, along with the unique problems
of an academic medical center, some

care-givers here wonder if the Clinton
plan will be panacea or snake oil.
A time for change
The need for a change in the way
America delivers medical care has been
widely discussed. Over the past year, the
symptoms have become increasingly
hard to ignore: 37 million Americans
have no health insurance. Health care
spending approaches $1 trillion annually
— about 15 percent of the country's
gross domestic product — and costs are
rising quickly.
