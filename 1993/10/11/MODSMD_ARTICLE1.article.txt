# Health reform prompts questions, changes at Med Center
## 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
President Clinton's health care plan
pledges to bring relief to millions, but it
has caused concern for many others, in
cluding some at Stanford's Medical Cen
ter.
Short on details, the Clinton plan has
raised more questions than it has an
swered in the minds of many health care
providers. In the medical community,
many support the idea that everyone
should have health care. At the same
time, other care-givers worry about the
plan's lack of specifics — especially about

funding — and wonder if they are going
to lose autonomy or income.
Because academic medical centers —
like Stanford's massive medical facility
— treat many indigent patients, under
take advanced research and treatment,
and support a medical school as well as
hospitals, costs at academic centers are
higher than at most hospitals. In a new
system that places a premium on cost-ef
ficiency, such high overhead costs could
cause extra headaches, Stanford experts
say.
"It's a bold plan, it's an ambitious
plan ... it has dimensions to it that I find
very exciting and support" — such as of-

fering greater access to
health care, said Ken
neth Bloem, president
of Stanford Hospital.
But Bloem said he is
concerned about parts
of the plan, especially its
"relative muteness on
support for academic
medical centers.
"The academic med-

ical center is the soul of American health
care in many ways," he said. "The acade
mic medical center is not squarely in the
center of the Clinton plan. This poses a
major concern for me."

The Clinton draft plan does briefly ad
dress academic health centers as a
unique issue. It recognizes the extra
costs academic institutions face, and
promises to create a funding pool, esti
mated at $6 billion in 1994, to support
advanced research and treatment, and
provide other funding help.
Still, details on the funding are practi
cally non-existent. The draft plan de
votes little more than a dozen para
graphs out of a several-hundred page re
port to the issue.
So, faced with a major change and few
details, along with the unique problems
of an academic medical center, some

care-givers here wonder if the Clinton
plan will be panacea or snake oil.
A time for change
The need for a change in the way
America delivers medical care has been
widely discussed. Over the past year, the
symptoms have become increasingly
hard to ignore: 37 million Americans
have no health insurance. Health care
spending approaches $1 trillion annually
— about 15 percent of the country's
gross domestic product — and costs are
rising quickly.

Concern over the health of
America's health helped Bill Clin
ton take the White House last
November. His wife Hillary spent
months examining and discussing
health care before the Clintons
outlined their prescription: a plan
that promises to simultaneously
give all American citizens fairly
generous health insurance, make
medicine more efficient and slow
the growth of health care costs.
Under the draft plan, all Amer
ican citizens will sign up with one
of several health care plans either
through a large regional alliance or
through their employers. Individ
uals who sign up for the standard
health benefit package will pay
about 20 percent of the plan's cost;
their employers will pay the rest.
Hospitals, doctors' offices and
other health care facilities will
offer packages of services to large
employers or alliances. Different
providers will vie against each
other, trying to offer the best care
for the lowest cost. Individuals will
be allowed to choose one among
the competing plans.
Effects on academic medicine
Since the plan's release, some
doctors and other health care work
ers have voiced concerns about the
plan: That it may lower their
incomes, push them into large
health care conglomerates and hurt
their autonomy or medical quality.
At academic centers, such as
the Stanford Medical Center,
questions are even greater. The
costs of the Medical Center are
higher than the costs of, say, a pri
vate community hospital, because
academic centers have to fund
advanced research and the educa
tion they cany out in addition to
the procedures doctors perform at
Stanford, Bloem said.
Furthermore, "academic health
centers provide half the indigent
care in the United States," and so
have, to raise their prices to com
pensate for treating patients who
can't pay, said David Korn, dean of
the School of Medicine who has
worked with a group of medical
school deans helping Mrs. Clinton
and others in Washington on
health care reform.
But what makes academic
health centers important also may
make them less attractive to con

sumers seeking the cheapest of
several competitors. So, in order to
compete, these centers will need
support for their research and
education activities.
The Clinton plan promises such
support. Korn said the draft plan
promises two $6 billion pools to help
with academic costs. One would
help fund residencies, more primary
and outpatient care and give some
money to facilities that now give a
lot of care to the indigent, he said.
The other pool, Korn said, would
cover many general "academic
expenses," which historically have
been paid for by raising prices.
The problem with the funding
in this area, as in many areas of
the draft plan, is that there are no
details, Korn said.
"How it will happen is totally
mysterious," he said. While he is
"delighted" that the Clinton plan
promises to address the funding
issue, he said the lack of details are
troublesome.
Even if full funding for the two
pools is found, Korn said, no struc
ture has been established to deter
mine who would distribute this
money, or how it would be dis
tributed.
And Korn said he can't even tell
the total costs Stanford's academic
mission adds to care at the Medical
Center now, because financial
records haven't been separated
along such lines.
Financing questions
Both Korn and Bloem said they
are concerned about the financing
details of the plan as a whole.
"It appears that the financing
will come off the backs of physi
cians and hospitals," Bloem said.
Korn agreed that the plan's
overall finances are troublesome.
"I think the biggest problem in
the whole thing, to my reading of
it, is there's real smoke-and-mir
rors in the financing," he said. "I
think there's a lot , of voodoo eco
nomics in this plan."
Korn said he wasn't sure that
the plan could deal with another
problem: medical costs.
The draft plan requires that the
growth in health care premiums
be held down to the level of growth
of the consumer price index — pro
jected about a 2.7 percent annual
increase — by 1999. The problem,
Korn said, is that providing com
plete, high-quality health care may
raise prices.
Preventative care and advanced
technology can save lives and

make people live longer but, Korn
pointed out, it only prolongs death
and increases the number of elder
ly, who are some of the biggest
consumers of medical care. More
resources will be given to staving
off death, he said, but death will
inevitably come and those costs
must be incurred.
"If everybody lives to be 85, do
you realize what a burden of the
costs will be dropped on the people
who can still work?" he asked.
While Korn said he favors pre
ventative care such as immuniza-

tion for all chil
dren, he pointed
out that the only
way to ensure a
big cost savings
may be to decide
that some
patients are too
sick or too old to
cure, and allow
them to die com-

fortably. But, Korn said, that rais
es tough questions about whether
such decisions are desirable, who
should make such decisions and
whether Americans are ready to
consider such issues.
"That's the problem. Do you
turn off life support on a terminal
ly ill elderly patient? Do you per
form heroic measures on a 1-1/2,
2-pound baby?" he asked.
Korn said he is a believer in a
theory that divides medical care into
three facets — access, quality and
cost — and says any two can easily
be obtained simultaneously, but not
all three. Until Americans want to
face such tough choices about cut
ting off care, he said, getting all
three facets may be out of reach.
"A very important reason for
the size of the health care budget
in this country has to do with
American values and beliefs and
choices. In other words, Ameri
cans choose to be heavy consumers
of medical technology.
"They're impatient and they
hate to make tough choices," he
said. "I don't believe that a truly
successful cost containment will
ever be possible in this country
unless the public comes to under
stand that you can't have your
cake and eat it, too."
There are other concerns about
the Clinton plan that worry some
at the Medical Center. Bloem said
he is not sure that Americans will
have a full range of health care
choices under the plan, especially
to choose procedures beyond a
minimum approved level.

Some are worried, too, about
doctors having limited choiceß.
Charles Sembai, an interventional
radiologist at the medical center,
said that while "health care for all
is a good idea," that regulation
may keep patients from freely
choosing and doctors from freely
giving all the care they might now.
"We're going to be so regulated
in what we do, it's basically going
to become rationed health care,"
he said.
Sembai said he was especially
concerned as a specialist — the
Clinton plan stresses primary care
(general practice and preventative
medicine) over specialized
medicine (advanced, complex
areas like transplant surgery).
"I just deep down inside have
this very unsettled feeling," he
said. "At one time physicians had a
feeling that this was a guaranteed
job for life. I don't feel that
way.... I've never felt this way
before in my career, and I'm just
starting."
Changing structures
Changes in the medical world
will bring other changes to the
structure of the Medical Center
and medical education at the Uni
versity.
Already, Stanford is reorganiz
ing the Medical Center's structure
to streamline its operations. In addi
tion, the Medical Center will try to
create more relationships with local
primary-care doctors, who will refer
patients to Stanford's medical facil
ities. Such extra referrals will not
only help the Medical Center finan
cially but will attract more patients
for academic work and research and
allow medical school students to get
experience outside the hospital,
Korn said.
The restructuring began in
January, and groups are now
working out the details of the
changes, said Geoffrey Cox, the
University's vice provost for insti
tutional planning. While Clinton's
task force started about the same
time, Cox said the structural
changes respond more to a differ
ence in California's health care
system than the national changes.
"It's a very volatile time in the
health care industry," Cox said.
"The bottom line is that the clinical
structure needs to be more in tune
with the market, and the market
has been changing in California for
a long time."
However, Clinton's plan is mov
ing in the same direction health

care in California has been mov
ing, so the structural changes will
hopefully help Stanford under the
Clinton plan, Cox said.
The ideas in Clinton's draft
plan may also change the way the
Medical School educates, Korn
said. Beside shifting the focus
from specialized medicine toward
primary care, the plan also espous
es training more nurse-practition
ers and physician assistants, peo
ple with less training than a medi
cal degree who can provide some
less-advanced health care.
Already, Korn said, the Medical
School is shifting toward more pri
mary-care training. The school has
formed a new clerkship in "ambu
latory care" — basically medical
procedures that require very little
or no hospital stay — and it has
been added as a requirement for
this year's entering class in the
Medical School for the first time,
Korn said.
In addition, he said, the Medical
School's physician assistant pro
gram "should be beefed up, and it
may well be that as the system
evolves, we may want to get into
nurse-practitioner training by
linking up with a nursing school."
Stanford currently has no nursing
school.
Finally, Korn said, in its talks
with Mrs. Clinton, the academic
group has pictured a larger role for
medical schools in the future.
Medical schools would coordinate
research on large bodies of
patients, Korn said, and would
provide lots of continuing medical
education to doctors "keeping the
provider network ... right at the
cutting edge of knowledge."
A final draft
While there seems to be some
considerable support for giving
everyone health care, there is also
concern about the plan the presi
dent has outlined to do this.
However, the plan released last
month is just a draft — in Wash
ington, officials are now working
to flesh out Clinton's blueprint
and will then submit it to
Congress, which will have its turn
to alter and debate the plan before
voting on it.
But no matter what happens in
Congress, several Stanford health
care providers agreed that the face
of medicine is definitely changing
here and now.
"A way of life is going to change
profoundly," Korn said. "I think
it's an exciting time."
