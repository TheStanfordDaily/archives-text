No evidence in plane bombing
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) — Lawyers for the two
Libyans accused of bombing Pan Am Flight 103
said yesterday that British and U.S. officials
have failed to reveal evidence, making it hard for
them to prepare a proper defense.
Ibrahim Legwell, the Libyan lawyer for the
two Libyan suspects, made the complaint in a
statement issued on behalf of the suspects'
defense team.
The prosecution's failure to reveal evidence
"seriously undermines the advisers' ability to
prepare the case properly," the statement said.
A spokesman for the Scottish Crown Office in
Edinburgh said it was not customary to turn
over complete evidence in a case before suspects
were arrested. But the spokesman, insisting on
anonymity, said a summary of the evidence was
presented to Libyan authorities.
The two men, Abdel Basset Ali Megrahi and
Lamen Khalifa Fhima, have been charged in the
United States and Britain with planting a bomb
that blew up on Pan Am flight 103 over Locker
bie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988. All 259 people
on the plane and 11 on the ground were killed.
