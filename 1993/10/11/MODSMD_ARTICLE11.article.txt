# Christopher responds to Somalia action

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - American
decision-makers "right up to and
including the president" were respon
sible for the now-discredited tilt
toward military action in Somalia,
Secretary of State Warren Christo
pher said yesterday.
The effort to apprehend Somali
warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid and
his followers after they began their
attacks on U.N. forces last June "was
a sound and natural response,"
Christopher said on NBC's "Meet the
Press."
But, he said, "I think it did get out
of balance" with too much focus on
the military and not enough on the
political side of the problem.
"I think we're all responsible for
that, right up to and including the
president," Christopher said.
Retired Adm. Jonathan Howe, the
U.N. special envoy to Somalia, said a
$25,000 reward for Aidid's capture
remained in effect, and that U.N.
forces were still trying to bring him to

justice.
Howe, appearing on NBC and
ABC's "This Week With David Brink
ley," said U.N. forces had had "many
opportunities to eliminate" Aidid, but
"that's not our job."
Aidid has reportedly called for a
cease-fire in the fighting that has left
18 Americans dead over the past
week. U.S. officials made clear that
while the U.N. resolution calling for
his apprehension remained valid, the
focus has shifted.
"We have a different set of priori
ties," Defense Secretary Les Aspin
said on ABC. Pressure will be kept on
Aidid until a political settlement is
reached, but "we are going to deper
sonalize it and de-emphasize that
aspect of it."
Christopher denied that there was
any secret peace offer to Aidid, and
said U.S. special envoy to Somalia
Robert Oakley, currently in the region
trying to coordinate a political solu
tion, has not been instructed to meet

the warlord.
But if Aidid wants to stop fighting
unilaterally, "that's fine with us,"
Christopher said. "And as you know,
we had a very quiet night last night in
Mogadishu."
He said the administration favors
the establishment of an African com
mission to assess responsibility for
attacks on Pakistani, U.S. and other
troops under the U.N. command.
Congressional leaders, meanwhile,
urged the administration to give up
the Aidid manhunt.
"The first thing you ought to do is
lift the ransom," Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said on
NBC.
Dole said President Clinton has
"done fairly well" in his handling of
the Somalia problem and supported
Clinton's decision to send more troops
to Somalia if the goal is to "protect
lives, but not to be the posse to go
after General Aidid."
"We have gotten ourselves in a sit

uation of trying to capture an individ
ual in the middle of an urban area
that he controls. It's like going after
Brer Rabbit in the briar patch," said
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Commit
tee.
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a
sharp critic of the Somalia opera
tion, repeated on CBS's "Face the
Nation" that U.S. troops should
leave immediately. "It's eerily remi
niscent of the Vietnam rationaliza
tion for remaining there," said
McCain, a POW during the Vietnam
War.
However Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-
Ind., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, also appearing on
CBS, said a hasty pullout would be
wrong. "If we bail out now, chaos
would come back, starvation would
come back."
President Clinton last week
announced plans to withdraw U.S.
forces by March 31.
