## A 						mature resolution 
### 
Axe Committee showed
responsible commitment
to Stanford community

WHEN ONE thinks of Stan
ford's Big Game traditions,
images of the Stanford
Axe, weenie-bashing in Gaieties
and a truly huge fire roaring to life
in the dry lake bed of Lake Laguni
ta come to mind.
Well, two out of three ain't bad.
Axe Committee chairman Steve
Zika has announced that this
year's Big Game Bonfire will not
take place in order to protect the
several hundred California tiger
salamanders that have taken up
residence in the Lagunita lake bed.
Although not yet on the endan
gered species list, the salamander
was once thought to be extinct on
the Peninsula, and the University
is taking measures to ensure its re
emergence. Over the next year,
studies will be made to determine
exactly what the status of the Stan
ford salamander population is, and
what threat future bonfires might
pose to their survival.
The students on the Axe Com
mittee should be commended for
their decision to cancel the bonfire
of their own accord; the Lake Com
mission and campus planners made
a similar recommendation but had
not yet determined whether to ban
the bonfire officially. As the stu
dents most interested in maintain
ing the bonfire tradition, the Axe
Committee has made a difficult but
mature choice, recognizing its
responsibility to the Stanford com
munity and its environment.
Although the banning of the bon
fire may be unpopular with some
tradition-oriented members of the
Stanford community, there are
other methods of getting the cam
pus excited for the biggest athletic
event of the year. The Axe Commit
tee has said it will hold a crowd
drawing event the Thursday night
before Big Game, when the bonfire

was generally held. Recognizing the
affection that students and alumni
have for the bonfire tradition, it is
important for the University
administration to support the Axe
Committee in its search for alterna
tive venues for their largest and
most popular activity.
One option is to hold fireworks,
to be seen from the Quad, as were
held for Stanford's Centennial cele
bration in 1991. This festivity
would probably draw much of the
Stanford population and is in a
prime location for people who have
just seen Gaieties in Memorial
Auditorium. Coupled with a rally of
the Band and the football team,
this celebration could become as
much of a Stanford Big Game tra
dition as the bonfire has been.
Unfortunately, salamanders are
not the only concern regarding the
bonfire. Complaints have been
lodged for years about the amount
of air pollution emitted from the
blaze. Students in Civil Engineer
ing's environmental science class
often calculate the amount of car
bon and particulates emitted from
such a large flame. For this reason,
if the new Thursday night rally is
well-received, the Axe Committee
should consider abolishing the
blaze for good.
Banning the bonfire from an
environmental standpoint makes
sense regardless of the outcome of
the studies on the salamander pop
ulation. The "no regrets theory,"
which has recently become well
known in environmental policy cir
cles, states that even if the final
outcome of an environmentally
questionable act is not clear, other
benefits may result from a good
decision. In this case, the banning
of the bonfire may provide long
term reductions in local air pollu
tion in the winter months, whether
or not it really affects the salaman
der population.
If all goes well, Stanford Univer
sity may be recognized not only as a
premier research institution with a
profound commitment to teaching,
but also as the savior of the Califor
nia tiger salamander and deserving
protector of the Stanford Axe.
