## Love's most vicious circle 
### 
WITH ALL THE DISCUSSION in
this space about ways to improve
this great University, I'd like to
provide my own perspective on Stanford
and help, in my own Little private way, in
building a better community to serve the
United States and the entire world at
large.
As I see it, this institution has been
taking a turn for the worse, slowly but
surely leading to the brink of collapse for
the entire nation, perhaps. The problem
here is not a lack of moral standards at
Stanford, but quite the opposite. Maybe
an example will help me explain what I
mean. Let's talk about the disappearance
of the dinosaurs.
Where did they actually go? Why did
they die off, leaving us with a trail of old
bones, tough questions, and a whole
slew of entertaining but amazingly
stupid movies? Being the scholar that I
am, I'm going to put in my own two
cents.
I know you've all heard this before
but, with the future of Stanford Univer
sity in mind, the theory takes a whole
new importance. Long ago, in the grand
age of dinosaurs, the forces of Darwini
an evolution were doing their thing;
there were girl dinosaurs and boy
dinosaurs, and, of course, there was sex.
But I have seen proof that dinosaurs
didn't just mate, smoke and run, like
more primitive life forms, but loved.
Loved with a passion. Loved with a fire

that burned deep inside. Well, the
inevitable happened.
I call it the Most Vicious Circle. Let me
demonstrate it this way:
Rex is in love with Sally in love with
Barney in love with Dino (a distinct pos
sibility) in love with Pterry in love with
Ronnie in love with Madonna in love
with . . . (sort of like the "begat" thing,
huh?) ... in love with Hillary in love
with Rex. Everyone was in love with
someone else, encompassing the entire
species. And because of the impeccable
moral fiber of dinosaurs, demonstrated
by the complete lack of any divorce
records or paternity suits, everyone lived
in an interminable Hell of pathetic unre
quited love.
Excuse me. I have to go blow my nose.
What happened next is still unclear.
The two leading theories coming out of
the Department of Paleontology are (pre
pare to take notes): 1) All the dinosaurs
died lonely, miserable, woefully heartbro
ken, never once mating to continue the
line, or 2) On Valentine's Day, an unfor
tunately gloomy day all over the world,
each dinosaur took its own life, leaving us
a huge mass of suicide notes and pitiful
love poems, found, catalogued, hidden
and then destroyed to protect us from the
truth by the U.S. government (though
some were found in Elizabethan Eng
land).
Apparently, small mammals, on the
other hand, raised in an environment of

less moral guidance and restraint, felt
free to take complete advantage of the
emotions of their warm-blooded com
panions. Minnie, though in love with
Mickey, settled and slept with the ever
willing and droopy-eyed Stuart. The rest
is history.
And like all great theories of science,
this theory transcends the boundaries of
just paleontology. Highly dignified,
often-bought-but-never-read journals
have published papers claiming that this
exact effect accounts for the fall of the
great Roman Empire, the disappearance
of the city of Atlantis, and the slow but
steady deterioration of the cast of "Sat
urday Night Live" and the New York
Mets. And also like all great theories,
this one must be studied, understood
and considered for the future.
So, my advice to Stanford University,
kindergarten of the future leaders of the
world, is NOT to make the same mistakes
of the past, but to learn and to grow from
the knowledge.
And remember: if you can't be with
the one you love, love the one you're
with.
