## Humans use religion to achieve their personal ends 
### 
HUMANS THINK they are right.
Throughout history, stubborn
religious beliefs have lead to mas
sive wars as well as acts of peace. Reli
gions have grown from ideas of Gods
(polytheism), a sole God (monotheism),
the supernatural, and other ideas con
cerning 'why we are here,' 'fate' and
'what is beyond.'
Moreover, it is the unknown that is
often the driving force behind why a per
son chooses a certain religion. Diana Akiya
ma and I hold many of the same view
points, as she expressed in the Oct. 7 Cam
pus Viewpoint, but I would also like to
comment on two that I had problems with.
Somehow, religion and personal faith
were tied together in the article like it is
not possible to have one without the
other. I would like to define what reli
gion really is: 1) the service and worship
of God or the supernatural; 2) The com
mitment or devotion to religious faith or
supernatural; or 3) A personal set or
institutionalized system of religious atti
tudes, beliefs or practices.

Therefore, I view religion as being a
construction of humans, not faith itself.
Granted, humans create their own faith,
but it is emotional and deeply personal. I
would like to point out that humans pay
for and build churches, shrines, monas
teries and temples. Humans wrote the
Bible, the Koran, The Book of Mormon
and other religious texts. Humans eat
crackers and drink wine. Humans dic
tate in their own opinions what the word
of God is. Humans use religion to better
themselves or to control others. Humans
think they have the answers. Humans
really do not know anything. All Homo
Sapiens can do is make guesses, some
times educated. Unfortunately, most
religious "guesses" are not based on sub
stantial facts, but rather, blind faith
passed down by others.
The second problem I had with the
article was a particular sentence: "The
process of knowing one's religious or
moral beliefs develops in a process that,
for most of us, is gradual and not with
out pain." Here, she has used "religious"

and "moral" as if they are interchange
able. Moral conduct is vague to begin
with, since one person's morals could be
highly different from another's. I agree
that there is often pain associated with
developing a belief system, but morals
and religion are two different subjects.
One might argue that there are many
morals found in the Bible (i.e. the Ten
Commandments). However, there is also
incest, rape, death, atrocities, discrimi
nation, slavery, greed, you name it —
it's probably in there. Also, morals
change with time. What is wrong today
might be viewed as right tomorrow, or
vice versa. Look at how homosexuality
has finally gained ground in many parts
of the country, especially the West.
In conclusion, I wholeheartedly agree
with Diana that students should forever
explore their belief system, keep an open
mind and continue to find avenues of edu
cation. Diana mentioned the liberal arts,
but one should also have a broad outlook
based on scientific methods as well.
If everyone kept their personal faith

to themselves and did not condemn oth
ers based on religious institutions, peace
would have a better chance. I am proud
that the Memorial Church is non-denom
inational, and that it has a liberal out
look to those on campus. But I could say
with confidence that many worshippers
of non-Christian based religions might
find offense at the design of the building.
This example indirectly shows the
root problem with religion and its prac
tices: every religion has a different view
of what is right. Instead of keeping an
open mind as you would have it, I know
of no religion that accepts other reli
gions as being equal with theirs (i.e.
humans think they are right.
By keeping an open mind about all
religions as well as thoughts that flow
out of science, only then can one have a
forever balanced and changing perspec
tive of life. (Subscribe talk.origins on

would have a better chance. I am proud
that the Memorial Church is non-denom
inational, and that it has a liberal out
look to those on campus. But I could say
with confidence that many worshippers
of non-Christian based religions might
find offense at the design of the building.
This example indirectly shows the
root problem with religion and its prac
tices: every religion has a different view
of what is right. Instead of keeping an
open mind as you would have it, I know
of no religion that accepts other reli
gions as being equal with theirs (i.e.
humans think they are right.
By keeping an open mind about all
religions as well as thoughts that flow
out of science, only then can one have a
forever balanced and changing perspec
tive of life. (Subscribe talk.origins on
