# Casper's actions, ideas cannot be compared to Clinton's lame rhetoric

The Daily's Oct. 4 front-page news
analysis piece comparing Gerhard
Casper to Bill Clinton was truly enter
taining. But of course you weren't seri
ous? Judging from the writer's slant —
especially prominent in the last few
paragraphs—the article seemed more
about sour grapes than journalism. The
reporter apparently felt mistreated and
wants to get even.
In any event, the comparison really
does Stanford's president a disservice.
After all, Casper has a tough job. Don
Kennedy's decade of fraud left Stanford

bankrupt, discredited and lacking any
ethical or intellectual leadership. Presi
dent Casper has braved the storm of
political expediency time and again in
his effort to restore Stanford's reputa
tion, financial health, and commitment
to protecting academic freedom.
Bill Clinton may talk about cutting
the budget and the bureaucracy, but
Casper is actually doing so. Similarly,
while Clinton wraps himself in the fash
ionable symbolism of diversity, Casper
implements a substantive plan which
simultaneously emphasizes the impor
tant function of affirmative action and
scales back the inordinate power of the
Office of Multicultural Development.
The most striking difference, howev
er, is that, unlike Bill Clinton, Gerhard
Casper actually has some new ideas.
Stanford's new Commission on Under

graduate Education is already the envy
of every other top-ranked school in the
nation. Casper has recognized the neces
sity of bringing the average alumni back
into the fold after years of neglect. He
understands that many of Stanford's
problems with alumni and the media
arise from a lack of communication com
bined with an unfortunate record of self
satisfied arrogance on the part of some.
Finally, Casper had the courage to
make possibly the most heretical state
ment I have heard in the past three
years: "We have got to do more with
less." Unlike Bill Clinton, whose motto
seems to be that we must do less with
more. So once again, if you are going to
criticize Gerhard Casper, at least try to
do so on his own merits, rather than by
making facile comparisons to Bill Clin
ton. At Stanford we are fortunate

enough to have a real leader. America's
president suffers by comparison.
