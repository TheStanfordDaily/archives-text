## Education should reflect science and technology in our culture

How well is Stan
ford University
preparing stu
dents for life in the 21st
century, into which stu
dents starting four years
from now will graduate?
Even today, most stu
dents reach graduation
day without knowing
essential facts or under-

standing crucial processes that will shape
their lives. Most graduates have no idea
how many people there are in the world,
their nation or even their home state.
They don't know how fast these popula
tions are growing, how many people
Earth might be able to support or what
either implies for their own future well
being. They know little or nothing about
the energy they use and take for granted.
They usually are aware of many impor
tant environmental problems but know
little of the details, history or implications
of them. Yet as citizens they will vote for
candidates and on issues that may pro
foundly affect these matters; as parents

they will make family-size decisions that
will affect their children's prospects; and
as consumers they will make daily choices
that incrementally contribute to a
brighter or dimmer future.
What should the well-educated gradu
ate know today? In essence, she or he
should have gained some understanding
of how the world works (biologically and
physically, as well as socially, economi
cally and politically) and how human
beings fit into it. It is particularly impor
tant that non-science mtgors be given
some background in these matters, just
as science students are expected to have
basic grounding in history, literature,
language and arts.
Science and technology comprise per
haps half of our culture and are increas
ingly important in the realms of busi
ness and industry as well as politics and
government. Maintaining ignorance of
important scientific matters (such as
evolution or the laws of thermodynam
ics) should be as shameful as ignorance
of Shakespeare or the Congress of Vien
na. Indeed, thermodynamics and evolu

tion have more to do with our lives than
Shakespeare's plays ever could.
But, like other universities, Stanford
is organized by departments, each repre
senting a different discipline. Thus
undergraduates learn about the world
mostly in compartmentalized chunks
having little or no relation to each other
and sometimes even with contradictory
conclusions. Yet, increasingly, the
nation's and the world's problems are
multidisciplinary in character. Address
ing environmental problems such as
human population growth, acidification
of ecosystems, management of toxic sub
stances, ozone depletion or global warm
ing requires collaboration across disci
plinary lines from physics to ethics.
To the extent that rigid disciplinary
boundaries hinder multidisciplinary activ
ities, they handicap students and reduce
the ability of faculty members to deal with
the human predicament. Since students
usually cannot be involved in scientific
research outside universities, they lose
opportunities to learn about and help find
solutions to some of the world's most

pressing problems, and too few young sci
entists are being trained to carry on after
today's cross-disciplinary pioneers.
For decades, Stanford's teaching in
interdisciplinary areas has been mostly
limited to the Human Biology program,
which has never attained the status of a
department (with the attendant rewards
to faculty) and the Science, Technology
and Society program, both for under
graduates, and to self-designed programs
for ambitious graduate students willing
to buck the system. Many environmental
courses existed, but they were scattered
through several different schools and
departments with minimal coordination.
In the last few years, the situation
has been changing. The Morrison Insti
tute of Population and Resources Stud
ies, joined by the Institute for Interna
tional Studies, initiated interdisciplinary
environmental programs, which bring
together ecologists and economists to
thrash out the very real differences in
how they perceive the world. The School
of Earth Sciences is offering an integrat
ed "Earth Systems" teaching program;

the Law School is beefing up its environ
mental law program; the Business
School is getting interested, and there
may be other stirrings.
This trend is certainly to be applaud
ed, but it is still a far cry from what is
needed today: an integrated, university
wide program analogous to CIV, to
ensure that every student learns the
neglected part of the foundation for a
well-educated future citizen. Stanford
could, if it chose, make educational his
tory by developing such a program and
requiring every student to take it. Much
of the senior talent and experience are
present in our faculty, but junior faculty
outside departments would be needed to
make it work. With a little encourage
ment and loosening of the requirement
that all tenure-line faculty must be
inserted in the antique departmental
system, a truly outstanding program
could be put together. I even have a
name for it: Global Change.
