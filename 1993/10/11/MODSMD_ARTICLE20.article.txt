# Take a hike
## 
### Kevin Wack 
Over the weekend, more than 200 freshmen left the Farm
for a second orientation. Participating in one of nine sep
arate trips, somefrosh spent the past two days backpack
ing, camping and performing community-service work.
The following is an account of one group's camping trip
at Andrew Molera State Park in Big Sur.

On Friday afternoon, nine freshmen and two
upperclass guides met for the first time at Wilbur
Field. They came from Andover and Anchorage,
Arizona and East LA, but for the weekend, Cali
fornia's coastal region was their home.
They loaded into vans and headed for a weekend
of base camping at Big Sur, one of the inaugural
First Year Trips sponsored by Recreational Educa
tional Developmental Workshops Out of Doors
(REDWOOD), a student organization.
Having met at 3 p.m., they did not leave for
nearly two hours. So — after missing an exit in San
Jose and stopping for directions in Monterey —
they arrived at Andrew Molera State Park (about
15 minutes south of Carmel) in complete darkness.
It was not just poor orienteering that seemed to
haunt the journey — one of the cars in front of
their caravan ran over a raccoon.
But that night, the raccoons would get their
revenge.
After the tents were erected and a campfire was
started, the trip started to pick up speed. Several of
the campers engaged in a group back-rub, then
gathered around the flame to learn about each
other. Silliness abounded as the chatter swung
from favorite breakfast cereals to "Beavis and
Butthead" to memories of Underoos.
Of course, there were occasional reminders
that, yes, these were Stanford students. "Which is
your favorite book in the 'Aeneid' ?" one camper
asked. Another brought her Calculus book.
But most of the time, they were just teenagers;
escaping the rigors of everyday life, wondering at
the beauty of nature and bonding.
When the freshmen finally went to sleep,
though — most of them outside — they had no idea
what was in store for them.
Packs of raccoons swarmed the campsite
throughout the night, and the campers tried to
decide what was worse: the irritation of the rac
coons themselves or that of leader Dave Kuhn's

incessant at.tfye raccoons.
The next morning, the group, spending its third
weekend at Stanford, awoke to a place completely
different from the one they said good night to the
night before. What in the dark had seemed a gener
ic campground became a panoramic scene of pic
turesque foothills, rolling fog and beautiful trees.
The distant roar of the ocean could be picked up by
the trained ear.
Freshman Chuck Rhee spoke for the group, say
ing simply, "This is so beautiful."
Breakfast came, and with it, conversation that
was less forced. People began to connect. Laughs
came more frequently. Friendships started to form.
Around 11 a.m. the group started along an
ocean trail. They played on the vacant beaches,
gazed at their surroundings and, most important
of all, they talked.
After eating lunch Saturday afternoon, they
took time to talk about their experience, which, at
the time, was only half complete.
Kevin Barenblat, a freshman from Dallas, said,
"It's been a terrific way to really get to know other
frosh, especially from other dorms. This is the first
time I've ever been camping, and it's really been a
lot of fun."
Camping veterans beamed just as emphatically.
"It's the little things like setting up the tents
together, cooking together, chasing off raccoons
together — that make this different and exciting,"
Rhee said.
Still, some of the campers found it more diffi
cult to have a good time when they realized how
much schoolwork they were neglecting. Heidi
Schweiker said she feels the program should be
held during Orientation. "A lot of schools have
programs before school starts," she said. For them,
"it's kind of like an adventure, like coming to
school itself."
But those were the only negative words to be
heard. The freshmen found it hard to argue with
the ocean, the mountains and the opportunity to
lay the foundations for some four-year friendships.

at Andrew Molera State Park in Big Sur.

On Friday afternoon, nine freshmen and two
upperclass guides met for the first time at Wilbur
Field. They came from Andover and Anchorage,
Arizona and East LA, but for the weekend, Cali
fornia's coastal region was their home.
They loaded into vans and headed for a weekend
of base camping at Big Sur, one of the inaugural
First Year Trips sponsored by Recreational Educa
tional Developmental Workshops Out of Doors
(REDWOOD), a student organization.
Having met at 3 p.m., they did not leave for
nearly two hours. So — after missing an exit in San
Jose and stopping for directions in Monterey —
they arrived at Andrew Molera State Park (about
15 minutes south of Carmel) in complete darkness.
It was not just poor orienteering that seemed to
haunt the journey — one of the cars in front of
their caravan ran over a raccoon.
But that night, the raccoons would get their
revenge.
After the tents were erected and a campfire was
started, the trip started to pick up speed. Several of
the campers engaged in a group back-rub, then
gathered around the flame to learn about each
other. Silliness abounded as the chatter swung
from favorite breakfast cereals to "Beavis and
Butthead" to memories of Underoos.
Of course, there were occasional reminders
that, yes, these were Stanford students. "Which is
your favorite book in the 'Aeneid' ?" one camper
asked. Another brought her Calculus book.
But most of the time, they were just teenagers;
escaping the rigors of everyday life, wondering at
the beauty of nature and bonding.
When the freshmen finally went to sleep,
though — most of them outside — they had no idea
what was in store for them.
Packs of raccoons swarmed the campsite
throughout the night, and the campers tried to
decide what was worse: the irritation of the rac
coons themselves or that of leader Dave Kuhn's

The next morning, the group, spending its third
weekend at Stanford, awoke to a place completely
different from the one they said good night to the
night before. What in the dark had seemed a gener
ic campground became a panoramic scene of pic
turesque foothills, rolling fog and beautiful trees.
The distant roar of the ocean could be picked up by
the trained ear.
Freshman Chuck Rhee spoke for the group, say
ing simply, "This is so beautiful."
Breakfast came, and with it, conversation that
was less forced. People began to connect. Laughs
came more frequently. Friendships started to form.
Around 11 a.m. the group started along an
ocean trail. They played on the vacant beaches,
gazed at their surroundings and, most important
of all, they talked.
After eating lunch Saturday afternoon, they
took time to talk about their experience, which, at
the time, was only half complete.
Kevin Barenblat, a freshman from Dallas, said,
"It's been a terrific way to really get to know other
frosh, especially from other dorms. This is the first
time I've ever been camping, and it's really been a
lot of fun."
Camping veterans beamed just as emphatically.
"It's the little things like setting up the tents
together, cooking together, chasing off raccoons
together — that make this different and exciting,"
Rhee said.
Still, some of the campers found it more diffi
cult to have a good time when they realized how
much schoolwork they were neglecting. Heidi
Schweiker said she feels the program should be
held during Orientation. "A lot of schools have
programs before school starts," she said. For them,
"it's kind of like an adventure, like coming to
school itself."
But those were the only negative words to be
heard. The freshmen found it hard to argue with
the ocean, the mountains and the opportunity to
lay the foundations for some four-year friendships.
