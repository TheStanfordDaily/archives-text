## Help wanted Team needs good ground game for balanced attack 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
In the first half of the 1993 football season, the Stan
ford offense has performed like a car due for a tuneup:
it has driven well at freeway speeds, but the lower gears
need adjustment.
While quarterback Steve Stenstrom has demonstrat
ed that he can march the Cardinal quickly downfield
with the pass, he has not had the benefit of an effective
running game to complement his arm.

"That's not going to cany us through the second half
of the season," said Stanford assistant head coach and
offensive coordinator Terry Shea "We've got to produce
in the running game, or else our passing yardage is
going to taper off as well. We're concerned about it, and
we're addressing it."
If Stanford (2-3, 0-2 in the Pac-10) is to have a win
ning season, the imbalance between the passing and
running components of the offense must be corrected.
Stanford currently ranks first in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence in passing offense, throwing for an average of 322
yards per game, but stands last in the league in rushing
offense, gaining a mere 64 yards on the ground each
outing.
"We did a better job of running against Notre Dame
than we did in previous games, and maybe that's a sign
of things to come," Shea said. "We realize that we can't
just continue to throw the football, and that's probably
a by-product of not scoring as many points as we should
because if we don't run the football we don't seem to get
the ball in the end zone enough."
