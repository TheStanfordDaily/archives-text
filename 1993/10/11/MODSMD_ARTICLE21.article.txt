## Help wanted Team needs good ground game for balanced attack 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
In the first half of the 1993 football season, the Stan
ford offense has performed like a car due for a tuneup:
it has driven well at freeway speeds, but the lower gears
need adjustment.
While quarterback Steve Stenstrom has demonstrat
ed that he can march the Cardinal quickly downfield
with the pass, he has not had the benefit of an effective
running game to complement his arm.

"That's not going to cany us through the second half
of the season," said Stanford assistant head coach and
offensive coordinator Terry Shea "We've got to produce
in the running game, or else our passing yardage is
going to taper off as well. We're concerned about it, and
we're addressing it."
If Stanford (2-3, 0-2 in the Pac-10) is to have a win
ning season, the imbalance between the passing and
running components of the offense must be corrected.
Stanford currently ranks first in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence in passing offense, throwing for an average of 322
yards per game, but stands last in the league in rushing
offense, gaining a mere 64 yards on the ground each
outing.
"We did a better job of running against Notre Dame
than we did in previous games, and maybe that's a sign
of things to come," Shea said. "We realize that we can't
just continue to throw the football, and that's probably
a by-product of not scoring as many points as we should
because if we don't run the football we don't seem to get
the ball in the end zone enough."

Three Cardinal players collide while trying to dig a Tiger spike. The
Stanford defense, while stellar against Texas, couldn't restrain UOP.
Through the first five games,
the Cardinal offensive line did not
generate enough holes to allow
the running game to be estab
lished, creating mediocre results.
Senior Ellery Roberts, projected
by many to be the Cardinal's
main weapon on the ground, is
averaging only 47 yards per con
test.
' "When you don't have all the
holes available, it makes a back
look tentative," Shea said. "In a
lot of ways Ellery has had a pro
ductive season, just not as pro
ductive as he would have liked."
The offensive line has, howev
er, greatly improved on a sore
spot from last year — pass protec
tion. Stenstrom has been sacked
only 14 times since the season
opener against Washington.
With extra time from his block
ers, Stenstrom has found his
receivers with precision. He has
thrown for over 300 yards in each
of the last four games, and is com
pleting nearly 70 percent of his
passes. The senior quarterback

currently ranks 15th nationally in
passing efficiency and 11th in
total offense, and is on pace to
shatter several passing marks in
the Stanford record book before
the season is through.
Most of all, Stenstrom is
poised. Twice this season he lead
the Cardinal to come-from-behind
victories (against San Jose State
and Colorado), and nearly did it a
third time against UCLA. His
leadership has helped players and
coaches alike.
"It really allows you from a
day-to-day basis to feel like your
offense is in control because he's
in control," Shea said. "He does a
great job during the week of prac
tice, and he generates that confi
dence among his teammates that
whatever we're going to do offen
sively we'll be OK."
The Cardinal receiving core is
also a confident group. Junior
Justin Armour has caught an
average of 101 yards over Stan
ford's first five games, and senior
receiver David Shaw has added
speed to the lineup. Tight end
Tony Cline has also consistently
made tough catches, including the
game-winning touchdown recep
tion against Colorado.

And then there is Brian Man
ning. The freshman wideout has
caught touchdown passes of 30
yards or more in each of the last
three games, giving Stanford the
viable deep threat that has been
missing in recent years.
"There's no question that
Brian Manning has come in and
really stole the hearts of a lot of
Stanford fans," Shea said. "We
bring him in in isolated situations
where there's not a lot of decision
making involved, and he's made
the catch that we've asked him to
make."
Stanford has demonstrated the
ability to rapidly move the ball
downfield through the air. But
until the running game carries its
weight, the Cardinal offense will
continue to have an uneven ride.
"We haven't scored enough
based on our yardage product*! —
that correlation is not as strong as
it should be," Shea said. "We've
disappointed ourselves in some
regards, but I really feel good at
times about the momentum we
seem to bring into each game. We
feel like we can score at any point
and move the ball at any point,
and consequently, put the ball in
the end zone."

the running game to be estab
lished, creating mediocre results.
Senior Ellery Roberts, projected
by many to be the Cardinal's
main weapon on the ground, is
averaging only 47 yards per con
test.
' "When you don't have all the
holes available, it makes a back
look tentative," Shea said. "In a
lot of ways Ellery has had a pro
ductive season, just not as pro
ductive as he would have liked."
The offensive line has, howev
er, greatly improved on a sore
spot from last year — pass protec
tion. Stenstrom has been sacked
only 14 times since the season
opener against Washington.
With extra time from his block
ers, Stenstrom has found his
receivers with precision. He has
thrown for over 300 yards in each
of the last four games, and is com
pleting nearly 70 percent of his
passes. The senior quarterback

currently ranks 15th nationally in
passing efficiency and 11th in
total offense, and is on pace to
shatter several passing marks in
the Stanford record book before
the season is through.
Most of all, Stenstrom is
poised. Twice this season he lead
the Cardinal to come-from-behind
victories (against San Jose State
and Colorado), and nearly did it a
third time against UCLA. His
leadership has helped players and
coaches alike.
"It really allows you from a
day-to-day basis to feel like your
offense is in control because he's
in control," Shea said. "He does a
great job during the week of prac
tice, and he generates that confi
dence among his teammates that
whatever we're going to do offen
sively we'll be OK."
The Cardinal receiving core is
also a confident group. Junior
Justin Armour has caught an
average of 101 yards over Stan
ford's first five games, and senior
receiver David Shaw has added
speed to the lineup. Tight end
Tony Cline has also consistently
made tough catches, including the
game-winning touchdown recep
tion against Colorado.

And then there is Brian Man
ning. The freshman wideout has
caught touchdown passes of 30
yards or more in each of the last
three games, giving Stanford the
viable deep threat that has been
missing in recent years.
"There's no question that
Brian Manning has come in and
really stole the hearts of a lot of
Stanford fans," Shea said. "We
bring him in in isolated situations
where there's not a lot of decision
making involved, and he's made
the catch that we've asked him to
make."
Stanford has demonstrated the
ability to rapidly move the ball
downfield through the air. But
until the running game carries its
weight, the Cardinal offense will
continue to have an uneven ride.
"We haven't scored enough
based on our yardage product*! —
that correlation is not as strong as
it should be," Shea said. "We've
disappointed ourselves in some
regards, but I really feel good at
times about the momentum we
seem to bring into each game. We
feel like we can score at any point
and move the ball at any point,
and consequently, put the ball in
the end zone."
In the first half of the 1993 football season, the Stan
ford offense has performed like a car due for a tuneup:
it has driven well at freeway speeds, but the lower gears
need adjustment.
While quarterback Steve Stenstrom has demonstrat
ed that he can march the Cardinal quickly downfield
with the pass, he has not had the benefit of an effective
running game to complement his arm.

"That's not going to cany us through the second half
of the season," said Stanford assistant head coach and
offensive coordinator Terry Shea "We've got to produce
in the running game, or else our passing yardage is
going to taper off as well. We're concerned about it, and
we're addressing it."
If Stanford (2-3, 0-2 in the Pac-10) is to have a win
ning season, the imbalance between the passing and
running components of the offense must be corrected.
Stanford currently ranks first in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence in passing offense, throwing for an average of 322
yards per game, but stands last in the league in rushing
offense, gaining a mere 64 yards on the ground each
outing.
"We did a better job of running against Notre Dame
than we did in previous games, and maybe that's a sign
of things to come," Shea said. "We realize that we can't
just continue to throw the football, and that's probably
a by-product of not scoring as many points as we should
because if we don't run the football we don't seem to get
the ball in the end zone enough."

Three Cardinal players collide while trying to dig a Tiger spike. The
