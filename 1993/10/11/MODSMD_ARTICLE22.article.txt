# Water polo beats California, wins NorCal
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
Sixteen of the country's top-rated
water polo teams competed this past
weekend in the Northern California
Tournament at Berkeley's Spieker
Aquatics Complex.
One team clearly emerged as a step
above the rest, notching six victories on
the way to the tournament title.
Stanford was the owner of that per
fect 6-0 record, capping the weekend
with a 9-7 victory over rival California in
the championship game. As a result of
the weekend's success, the Cardinal
raised its season record to 14-1.
"I'm pleased with our consistency,"
said coach Dante Dettamanti. "Everyone
else lost this weekend. In the first month
of the season it was pretty cut and dry.
Stanford, USC, and Cal were the three
top teams. Now USC and Cal have lost a
few games and Pacific, Pepperdine and
[ UC-Irvine] are emerging as good teams."
Throughout the tournament, the
Cardinal controlled their matches, tak
ing advantage of team depth to keep the
squad fresh for Sunday's semifinal and
final round.

After opening with an 18-4 trouncing
of UC-Riverside, Stanford was tested by
No. 8 Pepperdine before winning by a 7-
5 margin.
"In a tournament like this, you basi
cally want to win in the early rounds and
save some for the later games," Detta
manti said. "In a couple of games we cut
it close. We were just trying to get
through with wins - some (games)
weren't pretty but they were wins."
Those games included an 8-7 victory
over No. 7 UCI in the semifinals and a 8-
6 win against No. 5 Pacific.
Stanford then had little trouble han
dling UCLA in the quarterfinals. Led by
senior Chris Wallin, who contributed
four goals to the effort, the Cardinal
whipped the Bruins by a score of 13-8.
Against Cal, the Cardinal came out on
fire to grab a 5-0 lead just four minutes
into the match.
"We set the tone of the game in the
first three minutes," said junior Wolf
Wigo. "We came to play and they had to
play come-back the rest of the way.
The Cardinal surge was emotionally
sparked by a two-point shot by junior
Billy Maguy as the 35-second shot
clock wound down.

"That was a play we had rehearsed in
practice," Maguy said. "When [Cal's
goaltender] came way out behind our
holeman, I made a release move."
After a goal by Stanford's holeman
Frank Schneider, coach Steve Heaston
quickly called a time-out to calm his
stunned Golden Bear squad. The defend
ing national champions responded by
slimming their deficit to 5-2 by the end of
the opening quarter.
Dettamanti was not without worries
of his own entering the early time-out.
"During that time-out I warned them
that the game was far from over," Detta
manti said. "When Cal got behind they
turned on their counter-attack. We
weren't prepared for the intensity of
their attack and got lazy on defense."
The Golden Bears continued to apply
offensive pressure, pulling to within one
goal at 5-4 when Mike Sparling scored
his second goal of the game midway
through the second quarter.
With the Cardinal clinging to their
slim lead, Jeremy Laster provided a
much-needed lift, hitting the net from
long-range for a two-point goal and a 7-4
Stanford lead.
Unfortunately for the Golden Bears,

Laster wasn't finished. With one minute
left to play in the third quarter, Laster
found the net again for two more points.
Stanford led 9-5 at the end of the quarter.
"A lot of goalies know that I usually
shoot to the near side and they bait me
there," Laster said. "Both times, (Cal's
goaltenderl gave me a big hole on the
near (left) side and the defense wasn't
pressing me. The second time I just shot
before they could set up."
Dettamanti was pleased with Laster's
overall play, especially the sophomore's
emergence as a scoring force.
"Jeremy was setting and guarding the
hole (the position directly in front of the
goal). He is one of the best hole guards in
the nation," Dettamani said. "He was
also shooting well from outside and get
ting his shots at opportune times. He's
really gaining confidence and improving
on his freshman year."
The Cardinal defense also gained con
fidence in defeating Cal for the second
time this season. Senior goaltender
Larry Bercutt was outstanding through
out the game, collecting eight saves.
Bercutt was named the tournament's
Outstanding Goalie and was a first-team
all-tournament pick.
