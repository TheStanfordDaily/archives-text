For the first time in seven years, the
Cardinal will relinquish the Stanford/Bank
of America title. And sifter walloping the
second-ranked team in the nation in the
semifinals, the news does not settle well.
The Cardinal fell to No. 11 University
of the Pacific in the championship match
Saturday night in four games. Among the
other teams in the tournament, No. 2
Texas (14-2, 4-0 in the Southwest Confer
ence) came out of the weekend's action in
third place after topping No. 12 Colorado
(12-4, 2-0 in the Big Eight Conference) in
the consolation match.
The Cardinal (12-3, 5-2 in the Pacific 10
Conference) dominated Texas from the
outset of Friday night's match, sweeping
the Lady Longhorns 15-7, 15-2, 15-12.
Pacific then staged a similar production,
handling the Golden Buffaloes 15-6, 17-15,
15-2.
However, the Cardinal's luck ran out
the next night as it succumbed to Pacific
15-7, 6-15, 15-10, 15-9 in a hard-fought
battle.
"I defmitely have to give UOP all the
credit," said head coach Don Shaw. "We
battled like crazy in those three last
games. We were out there scrabbling but it
was just an uphill climb all the way â€”
UOP never let up at all."
While the Tigers may have gotten the
best of the Cardinal squad on Saturday,
Stanford's performance against Texas
proved the team's spot among the top four
in the nation is well deserved. Jumping
out to a four-point lead to start the match,
the Cardinal set the tone for the night,
completely dominating games one and
two.
While the Lady Longhorns managed to
gain a brief lead in the middle of game
three, Stanford then evened the score at
12, then powered ahead for the win.

"I felt like we came out really strong,"
said senior tri-captain Piper Hahn. "We
were really geared towards playing against
them. We've been very focused and I
thought that tonight was a good example
of all that we've been practicing."
Clearly, the Cardinal's defensive prepa
ration paid off with the team tallying 76
digs to Texas' 51. Stanford coordinated its
offensive effort to pose a well-rounded
attack, topping the Lady Longhorns at the
net with a hitting percentage of .281 to
.134.
"We passed very well and ran our
offense very well," Shaw said. "They
weren't passing all that well so they had to
go high and outside most of the time."
The sophomore trio of Cary Wendell,
Wendy Hromadka and Marnie Triefen
bach led the Cardinal's front line. Pound
ing from the right, Wendell racked up 13
kills for a .393 hitting percentage, matched
by Hromadka's left-side onslaught with 13
kills for a .281 percentage. Both players
were named to the all-tournament team.
Triefenbach recorded 10 kills while hitting
.125 and adding 13 digs.
Furthermore, junior Anne Wicks
turned in perhaps her best performance of
the season. Hitting .450 with a career-high
tying 12 kills and 10 digs, she also earned a
spot on the all-tournament team.
Coordinating the offensive action,
Hahn tallied 33 sets and also came
through on the defensive side with a
match-high 16 digs. Starting at middle
blocker, freshman Nikki Otto rounded off
the Stanford attack to hit .357 with six
kills and 11 blocks.
Texas sophomore Samy Duarte was the
only Lady Longhorn to reach double digits
in kills with a total of 16 for a .333 hitting
percentage. The Cardinal block virtually
silenced Katy Jameyson, Texas' second key
hitter, who managed only five kills for .063.
