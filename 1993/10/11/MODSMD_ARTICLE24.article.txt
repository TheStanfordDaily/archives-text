Normally, when a team scores ten goals in two
games and doesn't allow its opponents to score, it
can be expected to win both matches. The excep
tion to this rule occurs when all those goals come
in one game, which the Stanford women's soccer
team found out this weekend.
The Cardinal (10-1-1) quickly disposed of USC
(2-9-1) 10-0 in the San Diego State Invitational
Saturday but faltered yesterday, tying unranked
San Diego State 0-0.
Emily Burt opened the scoring just six minutes
into the game against the Trojans with her first
goal of the season. Stanford's scoring barrage con
tinued in the first half, with Jessica Fischer and
Sarah Rafanelli scoring once each and Erin Martin
adding two goals and assisting on Fischer's score.
Carmel Murphy, Stacy Cook and Jen Stephan had
assists for the Cardinal in the first half.
The second half opened in a similar manner,
with Martin scoring her third goal of the game
four minutes into play on a header from Cook.
