# Soccer tops USC, ties San Diego St.
## 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
Normally, when a team scores ten goals in two
games and doesn't allow its opponents to score, it
can be expected to win both matches. The excep
tion to this rule occurs when all those goals come
in one game, which the Stanford women's soccer
team found out this weekend.
The Cardinal (10-1-1) quickly disposed of USC
(2-9-1) 10-0 in the San Diego State Invitational
Saturday but faltered yesterday, tying unranked
San Diego State 0-0.
Emily Burt opened the scoring just six minutes
into the game against the Trojans with her first
goal of the season. Stanford's scoring barrage con
tinued in the first half, with Jessica Fischer and
Sarah Rafanelli scoring once each and Erin Martin
adding two goals and assisting on Fischer's score.
Carmel Murphy, Stacy Cook and Jen Stephan had
assists for the Cardinal in the first half.
The second half opened in a similar manner,
with Martin scoring her third goal of the game
four minutes into play on a header from Cook.
Anna Patitucci got into the scoring
action on a pass from Vicky Haring.
Maring also assisted on the next
goal, passing the ball across the field
to an open Andrea Johnson.
Rafanelli added her second goal
of the game on a pass from Patituc
ci. Johnson mercifully brought the
scoring to an end with three min
utes left in the game, with the assist
going to Haring, her third of the
game.
"We didn't need to really fire on
all cylinders to win this game," said
head coach lan Sawyers. "We put
away our chances and did what we
had to do to win."
Stanford mustered a remarkable
35 shots on goal, while the Cardinal
defense limited the Trojans to only
two. Goalkeepers Leslie Garrard
and Jennifer Poehler combined for
the shutout, the ninth of the year by
Stanford keepers.
However, the Cardinal's for
tunes took a turn for the worse Sun
day in a tough matchup against San
Diego State (5-4-2). Facing a defen
sive-minded Aztec squad, Stanford
failed to find the back of the net as
the game ended in a 0-0 deadlock
after a 30-minute overtime period.
"We didn't play very well, and
they did what they needed to to beat
us," Sawyers said. "They physically
got us out of our game, which is
what teams will do to us to beat us.
"We worked hard, but we just
didn't execute good technique under
pressure," Sawyers continued "We
missed a few scoring chances, but
for the most part they [San Diegol
played very good, fierce defense."

all season, opening few holes for Stanford running backs.
