# Men's soccer frustrated after dropping two games at home
## 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
If the Stanford men's soccer season were an
extended fishing expedition, the story of the
year would be all about those big ones that
always got away.
"We had the opportunity to win these
games," said head coach Colin Lindores after
his team lost two heartbreakers at home, 2-1
at the hands of powerhouse Air Force on Fri
day and 4-2 against Sacramento State yester
day in overtime. "We just let them off the
hook."
In a season full of frustrations it's often dif
ficult to point to one fatal event that spells the
death knell to the year. But if there has been a
shot in the heart for the Cardinal (2-8-1), this
past weekend would definitely be the estimat
ed time of death.
"I just keep thinking this nightmare is
going to end one of these days," Lindores said.
"As for wins and losses this season is lost, but
there's always that opportunity to keep the
younger players learning."
The entire team learned the meaning of the
phrase "utter disappointment" following their
virtual elimination from postseason play. The
squad had a positive outlook on their playoff
chances going into the start of league play, but
suddenly the Cardinal is 0-2 in the conference
and left without concrete goals to shoot for.
"(The start of league play) was a renewal of
the season for us, a chance for us to knock off
one of the teams that was going to be in front
of us (Air Force) and beat Sacramento State,"
lindores said. "I'm always veiy optimistic
until we play games like this, and then I'm
very pessimistic."
In the Air Force game, Stanford came out
strong and matched the Falcons' intensity in
the first 20 minutes of play. Cardinal goal
keeper Jim Masetti had a great day in the goal,

sealing ofT entry to Stanford's goal and even
blocking a penalty kick by Air Force's Brian
Gesuale, who was five-for-five in penalty kicks
on the year. When the score remained 0-0 at
the half, the Cardinal had plans in mind to
ground the 8-1-1 Falcons.
But the second half told a different and less
glamorous fairy tale.
Less than three minutes passed by in the
second half when a missed ofTsides call by the
linesman gave Air Force a penalty kick outside
the box. With Masetti drawn out of the goal,
the ball was popped in by Falcon midfielder
Rob Behm. Things continued to go downhill
for Stanford, as none of their second passes hit
the mark in the second half. And although
Cardinal forward Rick Goad tied it up with a
penalty kick midway through the second 45
minutes. Air Force sealed the victory with 9:01
remaining in the game after another missed
ofTsides call left the net open to a one-on-one
Falcon attack.
"We've done markedly better in the first
half than in the second half," said Cardinal for
ward Ryan Collins. "Once again, we fell apart
mentally in the second half."
Stanford's performance in the Sacramento
State game only went to prove Collins' theory.
The Hornets (3-5-1) scored only seven minutes
into the game. But Stanford fought back,
pounding the Sacramento goal with shots for
the next 20 minutes until Collins finally head
ed one into the Hornet net and set things
abuzz at one apiece.
And who was that masked figure on the
field? The scoring power of the day for the Car
dinal was Collins, who broke his nose against
Air Force and wore a facial protection mask in
the Sacramento game that made him look like
the ne'er-do-well Jason out of the "Friday the
13th" horror movies.
But Collins wielded no machete on this day.
Instead, he used knowledge of the game and a

few solid headers to kill Sacramento in the first
half. He scored again with seven minutes and 39
seconds left in the half to put Stanford up 2-1.
Unfortunately, as always happens in the
horror flicks, the Hornets were resurrected in
the second half. They tied the game with 11:39
to play and took control of the second overtime

period to slay the Cardinal and leave them
writhing in the pain of an awful win/loss
record.
I can't figure out if we're cursed or if we just
stink,' Collins said. "Wejust lost two conference
games. I've never been in this situation before,
so I don't know what comes after this."
