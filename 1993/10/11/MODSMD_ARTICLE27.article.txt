For those of you whose appetite for winning
Stanford sports teams has not been satisfied by
Bill Walsh and company this fall, prepare to
break your fast.
The second-ranked Stanford men's tennis
team ushers in its fall season this Thursday at
the All-American Tournament in Austin,
Texas.
"There isn't really a limit to what we can
achieve this year," said Cardinal head coach
Dick Gould.
After finishing last season with a 20-5 dual
match record and a final ranking of sixth
nationally, Stanford returns its top eight play
ers, including all six starters, four of whom are
ranked by the Intercollegiate Tennis Associa
tion. They are seniors Michael Flanagan (No.
5), Robert Devens (No. 12), Vimal Patel (No.
18) and 1992 NCAA doubles champion Chins

Cocotos (No. 49). Others returning include
sophomores JeffSalzenstein, Ricky Becker and
Jim Thomas, as well as senior Billy Wright,
whose iryured wrist could limit his playing
time.
Flanagan labeled last year's elimination at
the hands of Georgia in the quarterfinals of the
NCAA championships as "disappointing," but
noted that the team is "pumped up this year,
especially the seniors who won the Champi
onship in '92."
"The seniors are all poised to make major
jumps this year," Gould said, adding that "the
sophomores have a year of experience under
their belts, with Jeff [Salzenstein] ready for a
tremendous year."
The roster also sports a home-grown addi
tion this year. Freshman Grant Elliot from
Palo Alto "will have a great opportunity to play
doubles," Gould said.
In doubles, 1993 NCAA runners-up Cocotos

and Flanagan have achieved a No. 2 ITA rank
ing, while the tandem of Devens and Patel are
ranked 16th.
The netters will face stiff competition this
season. Pacific 10 Conference rivals USC (last
year's NCAA champions) and UCLA are
ranked No. 3 and No. 5 in the country, respec
tively. In addition, those two teams feature the
top-ranked players in the country, Wayne
Black and Sebastian Leßlanc. Georgia recieved
the top ranking in the country, garnishing five
first-place votes to Stanford's two and USC's
three.
"The upcoming Ail-American Tournament
will be a good barometer of how our top players
will do against other colleges' top players,"
Flanagan said.
"If we stay together as a team and work at
being more consistent than last year then we'll
have a great shot at winning the NCAAs," said
Gould.
