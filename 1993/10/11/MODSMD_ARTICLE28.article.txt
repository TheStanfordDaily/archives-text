hockey team was shut out by
seventh-ranked James Madi

Michigan (6-2) 1-0, returning
home with a 5-6 record.
The Cardinal was looking to
play tough defense and stop
JMU forward Carole Thate
who had 38 points going into
the Saturday's meeting.
"Tina [Seyer] was marking
Thate and she did a good job."
said Cardinal head coach
Sheryl Johnson. "Danielle
IBeynet], Markley (Bavinger]
and Natalie IMcCullough] also
played really well. A couple of
their goals were off deflections;
they were great shots."
The first "great" shot was
by Eileen Arnaldo, who deflect
ed a beautiful pass by Carole
Thate past Stanford net-min
der Loretta Hidalgo. The sec
ond was by Thate, who found
the back of the net for the 18th
time in 10 games.
"We had four corners to
their six, our defense played
well and we pretty much shut
down their passing game,"
Johnson said. "We played our
game and we passed well; we
just were not able to [score]."
Stanford remained in Ohio
and on Sunday lost 1-0 to a
Wolverine squad whose only
losses have come to top-ranked
Penn State and No. 3 lowa
