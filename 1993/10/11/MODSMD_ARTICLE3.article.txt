# Stanford might gain $25 million from settlement
## Two-year bout with L.A. museum, Christian Science Church nears end 
### Joe Bialowitz 
Stanford stands to receive close
to $25 million if a judge approves a
recently negotiated settlement
with the Christian Science
Church and the Los Angeles
County Museum.
The settlement could resolve a
nearly two-year-long legal fight
with the church over a $100 mil
lion bequest.
A source close to the case told
The Daily that the settlement
would give about one-fourth of the
money to the University, one
fourth to the museum and about
one-half to the church. The settle

Mabury attended Stanford for one
year in 1891.
The sisters stipulated that the
church must label the book as "au
thorized literature" and distrib

ian Science Reading Rooms."
If, however, the church fails to
fully distribute the book, the
trusts state that the money is to be
split between Stanford and the
museum.
In December 1991, the estate
trustees filed a motion in Los An
geles Superior Court asking that
the money be given to the church.
But, in February 1992, lawyers for
Stanford and the museum sought
to block the distribution of the
money, claiming that the church
had not properly published and
