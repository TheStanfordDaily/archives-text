# Stanford might gain $25 million from settlement
## Two-year bout with L.A. museum, Christian Science Church nears end 
### Joe Bialowitz 
Stanford stands to receive close
to $25 million if a judge approves a
recently negotiated settlement
with the Christian Science
Church and the Los Angeles
County Museum.
The settlement could resolve a
nearly two-year-long legal fight
with the church over a $100 mil
lion bequest.
A source close to the case told
The Daily that the settlement
would give about one-fourth of the
money to the University, one
fourth to the museum and about
one-half to the church. The settle
ment must be approved by Los An
geles County Superior Court
Judge Arnold H. Gold.
Senior University Counsel
Carol Swenson confirmed that a
settlement has been agreed upon,
but she refused to comment fur
ther, citing a non-disclosure
agreement between the parties in
volved.
The money in question comes
from the trusts of sisters Eloise
Mabury Knapp and Bella Mabury.
The sisters' wills leave what likely

amounts to about $102 million to
the Boston-based First Church of
Christ, Scientist, on the condition
that the church publish and dis
tribute "The Destiny of the Moth
er Church" — a biography of
church founder Mary Baker Eddy
written by Bliss Knapp, Eloise
Mabury's late husband. Bella
Mabury attended Stanford for one
year in 1891.
The sisters stipulated that the
church must label the book as "au
thorized literature" and distrib
ute it in "substantially all Christ
ian Science Reading Rooms."
If, however, the church fails to
fully distribute the book, the
trusts state that the money is to be
split between Stanford and the
museum.
In December 1991, the estate
trustees filed a motion in Los An
geles Superior Court asking that
the money be given to the church.
But, in February 1992, lawyers for
Stanford and the museum sought
to block the distribution of the
money, claiming that the church
had not properly published and
circulated the biography.
Following a year of wrangling
in court, the parties agreed in
March to begin out-of-court set
tlement discussions.
Jack Ruskey, the attorney rep
resenting the church, refused to
comment, saying that "we are
vigorously pursuing a settlement,
but it would be inappropriate and
premature to speculate on the
outcome of the negotiations."
Details of the proposed settle
ment will become public tomor
row, when a petition for a confir
mation of the settlement agree
ment will be filed in court, the
source said.
The biography has generated
controversy within the church

because some Christian Scientists
see the book as equating Eddy
with Jesus.
Attorneys for Stanford and
the museum argue that the biog
raphy is not labeled as "autho
rized literature" by the church.
In addition, they point to a study
published last year by the Lon
don Independent newspaper
stating that only about 30 per
cent of 150 Christian Science
reading rooms surveyed carry
the biography.
The church, however, claims
that about 97 percent of its read
ing rooms carry the book. In addi
tion, they say that although the
book does not carry an "autho
rized literature" label, it is indeed
authorized by the church.
When asked what the Univer
sity would do with any settlement
money, Swenson refused to com
