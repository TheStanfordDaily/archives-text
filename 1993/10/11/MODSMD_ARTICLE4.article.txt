## Some say Madera by any other nameespecially Junipero—just isn't the same 
### Charles Katz 
Madera by any other name is
still Madera. Well, sort of.
Much to the chagrin of Madera
die-hards, Madera is now called
Junipero. Well, that's a sort of,
too.
In order to make Okada, the
Asian-American theme house,
more accessible to the disabled, it
was relocated to the former
Madera building in Wilbur.
Okada's old building was taken
over by freshmen under the name
Junipero. And the name Madera
went the way of the Stanford In
dian.
The change seems innocuous
enough, but Maderans are out
raged by the loss of their dorm.
They would like to see the Ju
nipero dorm change its name to
Madera.
"Madera was a really special
freshman dorm. Year after year,
Madera was a good place to be,"
junior ex-Maderan Nik Kolodny
said.
Kolodny, who is also a resident
assistant in Junipero, began his
campaign to keep the name alive
by writing a letter over the sum
mer to all the freshmen telling
them they would live in Madera.
The University, on the other
hand, told the freshmen they
were living in Junipero.
This dual citizenship confused
many freshmen. Junipero fresh

man Spencer Burns said he was
not really sure where he lived
when he first moved in. But, now,
when asked, Burns tells people he
lives in Madera.
Ex-Maderans hoped to indoc
trinate the freshmen into calling
the dorm Madera in order to keep
its spirit alive. They partly suc
ceeded. Most freshmen call it
Madera, but not for the intended
reason. "I just call it Madera be
cause it is easier to say," Burns
said.
The reason for the change is
quite simple, said Ann Porteus,
acting co-director of Residential
Education. Okada had occupied
the Junipero building, but for
convenience, the dorm was re
ferred to as Okada, rather than
Okada at Junipero. Now the pro
gram has moved to the Madera
building, opening up the name Ju
nipero.
"Houses are named and dedi
cated under a specific name," said
Porteus. "Once that name has
been chosen, it cannot be
changed."
Some ex-Maderans believed
that the University wanted to
quell the raucous Madera spirit.
Sophomore ex-Maderan Neil
Goldman said the University
"made an effort to destroy the
image of Madera as a rowdy, fun
dorm." Goldman explained that
at a young University like Stan
ford, establishing and keeping
fun traditions is important. But,
he said the University certainly
has not done that.
That image as a rowdy dorm
may have been well-deserved. Ex-
Madera treasurer, sophomore
Adam Miller, said the Madera
freshmen of last year did nearly
$3,000 worth of damage to the
dorm. And that's not to mention
the broken windows caused by
errant frozen oranges. Yet, Miller
sees no reason to eliminate the
Madera name. "Taking away
'Madera' takes away traditions,"
he said.
Porteus, however, emphatical
ly denied the charge that the Uni
versity is putting a wet blanket on
the hopping dorm. "The change
was not at all to destroy the
Madera spirit," she said — Resi
dential Education made the
change for purely financial rea
sons. It was cheaper to move the
Okada program to Madera, rather
than renovate the Junipero build
ing.
Madera alumni feel their spir
its have been sacrificed to the god
of economics. Yet, they have not
lost all faith. Ex-Maderans have
tried to boost the Madera spirit in
Junipero by posting signs that
say "Madera" throughout
Junipero.
Junipero RA Naseem Zojwalla
at first wanted to call the dorm
Junipero because otherwise it
would confuse the freshmen. But,
now she believes it should be
called Madera.
"It's really hard to cheer
Junipero at football games," she
said. "You wouldn't think about
that unless you're an RA, but, it's
true. Branner and Donner are
simple names to cheer, but how
do you cheer Junipero?"
No matter what the dorm
located across from Okada is
called, it certainly is a spirited
dorm.
"Madera is, and always will be
a part of the Stanford tradition,"
Goldman said.
Kolodny summed up the situa
tion best. "We live in Junipero,
but we are Maderans. Besides,
Madera is good enough to handle
two names."
