# COP to form undergrad education group
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
After failing in their attempt to increase the
number of students serving on the Commission
on Undergraduate Education, Council of Presi
dents members are taking matters into their own
hands.
A COP-sponsored body — the Student Advi
sory Group on Undergraduate Education — will
"essentially parallel the workings of the com
mission," according to COP member Delia
Lopez.
The COP is assembling this group after con
tacting University administrators and sending a

letter to University President Gerhard Casper re
questing an additional undergraduate represen
tative to the commission. Casper denied their re
quest for more undergraduate members Friday.
The student group will work closely with the
two student representatives — one undergradu
ate and one graduate — who will serve on the 19-
member commission, said COP member Ying-
Ying Groh. "Those students will be our strongest
contact with the commission."
COP member Jason Snyder said the two repre
sentatives have not yet been selected from the 37
undergraduates and seven graduates who applied.
He said the ASSU committee on committees will
complete the selection process by tomorrow.

The student group will encourage students
with a variety of opinions to attend, Snyder said.
"I think this advisory group is a tremendous
opportunity for students to get their opinions
into the open," said COP member Ron Brown.
The group will follow a similar timeline as the
commission, but will issue its report earlier so the
commission can take its findings into account,
according to Snyder. Details on who will sit on
this advisory group still need to be hammered
out, he said.
A steering committee — which COP members
intend will include the two commission represen-
tatives, among others — has
already been established to oversee
the student group's progress.
"We want to reach out to every
student out there," said senior Eddie
Garcia, the steering committee's
chair. He added that meetings will
often be held in dormitories in order
to facilitate student interaction.
"We are all a little concerned
that Casper decided not to increase
the number of undergrads on the
commission," said Goh. "We tried
very hard to work through official
channels."

"There's no way two students
can reflect the diverse opinions on
campus," she admitted. However,
the COP is optimistic about the
prospect of the two groups working
together.
Goh said she has spoken with
History Prof. James Sheehan, the
commission's chair, regarding
important issues facing undergrad
uate education.
"We've already started working
on questions ranging from distribu
tion requirements to teaching qual
ity," added Snyder.
Brown said he believes the com
mission will take student input
seriously. "The administrators say
they have great confidence in stu
dents at this University," he said.
