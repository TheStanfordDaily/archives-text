## White House Counsel Nussbaum tells of lessons learned, 'quiet' victories 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Saying that he is proud of the
Clinton administration's accom
plishments so far, White House
Counsel Bernard Nussbaum said
Friday that — despite a few "little
legal problems" — he is also satis
fied with his office's performance.
Nussbaum, speaking to an au
dience of 150 at the Law School,
admitted, though, that he has
learned a lot since January. "I've
learned some strange lessons in
how a nanny should be paid, why a
haircut is sometimes a bad idea,
and when you shouldn't change
travel agents," Nussbaum joked,

referring to the highly publicized
White House blunders that
plagued the Clinton administra
tion earlier this year.
"I used to say that I keep the
president out of trouble. Now I
know that's impossible," he said.
Nussbaum told the audience,
which was dominated by law stu
dents, that a big part of his job was
to minimize the political impact of
the inevitable "controversies and
crises" that come up.
He outlined three priorities
that the administration and his
office have focused on: creating a
strong Justice Department, ap

pointing "excellent" judges to the
federal bench and renewing confi
dence in the FBI.
He argued that decisions in
these areas were not influenced by
politics. "We are not looking to put
43-year-olds on the Supreme
Court to try to control it into the
next century," Nussbaum said. He
went on to praise the experience
and background of Justice Ruth
Bader Ginsburg, who is 60.
Nussbaum also pointed out that
newly appointed FBI director
Louis Freeh, a "law enforcer leg
end," is a registered Republican.
"These people were not FOBs

[Friends of Bill's]," he said. "The
only thing they have in common is
that they are the best people in the
country for the job."
Nussbaum downplayed the sig
nificance of his office's mistakes,
such as the prolonged search for
an attorney general and the with
drawn nomination of Lani Guinier
for a Justice Department post.
"Stumbles and failures make
headlines. Successes quietly make
history," he said, pointing to the
popularity of Ginsburg, Freehand
Attorney General Janet Reno.
Nussbaum accepted some
responsibility for the Guinier fias
co, though he argued that Republi
cans unfairly focused the debate
on her political agenda rather than
her "marvelous career."
"We made mistakes in [the

Guinier nomination]," he said,
"but they were mistakes in good
faith. [We failed] to realize that the
political ground might shift on us."
He said that Clinton still made
the right decision in withdrawing
the nomination, since he was
already facing tough congressional
opposition on his economic plan.
"Everything in those early days
became a test of our presidency,"
Nussbaum said.
"I don't mean to suggest that
we haven't had our problems and
our failures We will do bet
ter," he said.
Comparing Clinton to former
presidents John Kennedy and
Franklin Roosevelt, Nussbaum
explained that it is a "big chal
lenge" for an activist president to
succeed in an age of cynicism and

instant communication.
Drawing from a speech by Roo
sevelt, Nussbaum said America
should realize that "the President
of the United States is [actively] in '
that arena. .. not one of the timid
souls who knows neither victory
nor defeat."
Nussbaum went on to list the
accomplishments of the adminis
tration, including the legislation on
family leave, national service act,
the elimination of the gag rule on
abortion, and the weakening of
restrictions on gays in the militaiy.
Lauding Clinton for "finally
using real numbers" and "daring
to raise taxes" in his plan to reduce
the deficit, Nussbaum said Wash
ington is beginning to realize that
there will be difficult decisions to
make in the future.
