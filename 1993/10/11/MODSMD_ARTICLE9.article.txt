# Students discuss Columbus Day at vigil
## 
### Colleen Krueger Editorial staff 
Last night, usually chaotic White Plaza was
mellowed by contemplative music and the glow of
candles as about 45 students reflected on the
meaning of Indigenous Peoples' Day, an alterna
tive celebration to today's Columbus Day holiday.
The candlelight vigil, coordinated by the Stan
ford American Indian Organization, was orga
nized to remind the entire Stanford community
that there are two stories behind Columbus Day,
said SAIO co-chair Myra Parker.
"This isn't anti-Columbus," junior Paula
Dybdahl said. "We're supporting another vision
of what the New World was and is."
Parker hopes that people will start to ask
themselves why Columbus Day is a federal holi
day, she said.
"People know the mainstream story about
Columbus," Parker said. "But the native peo

pie's story just isn't being told. History isn't just
one people's version."
Though the vigil was organized by SAIO, rep
resentatives and speakers from the Asian Amer
ican Student Association, the Black Student
Union and MEChA, a Chicano/Latino student
group, were present.
The vigil's featured speakers reflected this
broad ethnic base, including Asst. Dean of Stu
dents Jim Larimore, Casa Zapata's Resident
Fellow Tony Burciaga, and junior Lisa Lee,
chair of AASA.
"I came here to show solidarity with the
SAIO," said Lee. "While this brings up a lot of
issues common to all communities of color, they
should be issues for eveiyone."
In addition, sophomore David Tanaka — a
member of Stanford University Nikkei, a
Japanese-American student association — was
asked to speak as a reciprocal gesture.
"Dave had us speak last weekend at the

Japanese American Reunion Ceremony, and
we're trying to repay the favor," Parker said.
"We're really concentrating on stressing that
kind of unity within the different communities
this year."
The vigil followed another Indigenous Peo
ples' Day rally, held Friday in White Plaza.
"Last year, we had a bonfire at Lake Lag,"
Dybdahl said. "But this year, because of the
salamanders (in the lakebed) we decided that a
vigil would be a good way to show solidarity."
Though Parker admits that she would have
been thrilled to see "hundreds of people" at the
vigil, she was pleased with the support the vigil
received from the SAIO, other ethnic communi
ties and interested onlookers.
"A lot of people were just biking by and
stopped to listen for a few minutes to show sup
port," Parker said. "That's what makes me
happy ... to see people taking time to try to
understand why this is important to us."
