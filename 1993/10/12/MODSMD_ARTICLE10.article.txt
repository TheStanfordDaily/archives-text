# Cease-fire reached in Somalia

NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) â€” Following a
show of force over Mogadishu by U.S.
warplanes yesterday, the U.N. special
envoy to Somalia welcomed a cease-fire
by the militia of clan leader Mohamed
Far rah Aidid.
The comment by Jonathan Howe, a
retired admiral, was relayed to reporters
at a briefing after Mogadishu ended its
third night without attacks on fortified
U.N. positions around the city.
"We welcome all overtures of peace
and stability in Mogadishu, as we have
seen them in the rest of the country,"
Howe's statement said. His spokesman,
Farouk Mawlawi, said he would not elab
orate on the envoy's words.
Fighting between U.N. peacekeepers
and Aidid's militiamen has been largely
confined to the part of Mogadishu con
trolled by Aidid. Leaders of the other 14
main factions generally are cooperating
with U.N. forces elsewhere in rebuilding
the nation after a devastating civil war
and famine.
Aidid reportedly announced the sus
pension of attacks in a radio broadcast
Saturday.
The move was timed for the Sunday

arrival of President Clinton's envoy,
Robert Oakley, who is exploring a negoti
ated settlement of the conflict.
American F-18 Hornet fighters and A
-6 Intruder bombers roared low over the
seaside capital yesterday, the thunder of
their engines rattling windows and
emphasizing Clinton's decision to rein
force the U.S. peacekeeping contingent.
Before dawn, U.S. AC-130 aerial gun
ships fired their radar-guided cannons at
mock targets in an unpopulated area
near the city. It was the second time in
three nights that the four-engine gun
ships tested their weapons, the same
kind used to blast Aidid's home and
weapons caches in the first major retalia
tory raids against the warlord in mid-
June.
Burhan Mohamed Nur, a spokesman
for Aidid, described the overflights by the
jets and the target practice by the AC
130s as a provocation.
A three-ship U.S. Navy amphibious
battle group carrying 1,750 Marines
moved through the Suez Canal on yes
terday heading for Somalia. The force is
part of the reinforcements being sent to
Somalia to give U.N. peacekeepers more

fire power until the March 31 deadline
set by Clinton for an American with
drawal.
Aidid spokesmen have said the Amer
ican being held by the militiamen, Chief
Warrant Officer Mike Durant, would not
be released until the United Nations
freed 32 Somali prisoners, including four
key aides of Aidid.
Durant was captured during a battle
Oct. 3 that killed at least 17 American
soldiers and wounded more than 70.
Aidid said 315 Somalis were killed, many
of them civilians, and the Red Cross put
the figure of Somali wounded at 700,
about a third of them women and chil
dren.
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali said Sunday that African,
Arab and Muslim leaders would meet
with him on Oct. 20 in Ethiopia to seek a
plan to prevent Somalia from collapsing
into anarchy after U.S. troops withdraw.
Boutros-Ghali fears Clinton's plan to
pull American forces from Somalia will
lead other countries to withdraw their
U.N. contingents as well. There are
29,103 peacekeepers from 33 nations in
Somalia, about 5,300 of them American.
