## Editorials Diluting students' voice 
### 
ON SUNDAY, the ASSU
Council of Presidents
announced the creation of
two new committees to mirror the
University's Commission on
Undergraduate Education: a stu
dent advisory group on undergrad
uate education and a steering com
mittee to direct the new advisory
group's progress.
While it is regrettable that
another student representative
was not appointed, enlarging the
student bureaucracy will only serve
to dilute student discussion of the
pressing issues before the Univer
sity's commission, and will likely
diminish the impact that the two
students recently selected repre
sentatives may have on the Com
mission's final proposal.
The COP bases its decision in
the opinion that two students are
insufficient to represent the diver
sity of student views on campus,
and that the advisory group's

report will be more successful in
making distinct viewpoints heard.
Merely being able to regurgitate
the varied views of students to the
commission, however, should not
be the final goal. To be successful,
the two student representatives
must directly influence the out
come of the University commis
sion's report, taking into account
the most important issues that are
pertinent to all students. One
would hope that the COP has
impressed upon the appointees
from the beginning their responsi
bility to represent all present and
future students' needs, not just
their own personal agendas.
The COP should facilitate con
tact between the two appointees
and students interested in the com
mission's work, but through meet
ings that encourage a convincing
encapsulation of common student
concerns and not a confusing dis
persion of many smaller issues.
