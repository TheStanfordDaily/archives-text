# Service for financial aid
## 
### 
IN RECENT YEARS, the gov
ernment's attitude toward fur
thering public-service activities
by students has been much like the
oft-quoted aphorism regarding the
weather: Everybody complains,
but no one ever does anything
about it.
However, Stanford is currently
taking steps to rectify this imbal
ance. Following the dictates of
last year's Higher Education Act,
Stanford's Financial Aids Office
and the Haas Center for Public
Service have begun to lay the
groundwork for a system which
will enable students to pay for
their financial aid package
through community service activ
ities.

Both the national government
in general and Stanford in partic
ular should be applauded for
allowing students to work their
way through college while work
ing on service projects of their
choice. Instead of raking leaves or

working in other make-work
positions, scholars enrolled in the
new program will be able to help
themselves and others in their
work-study program. Further
more, while a student may be
able to pay his or her bills work
ing at Tresidder, he or she is
unlikely to earn the personal sat
isfaction or make the real and
lasting differences in others' lives
that come with public-service
opportunities.
Stanford deserves a special
commendation for enacting the
program a year before the feder
ally-mandated start-up date. This
extra time will allow the Univer
sity the opportunity to iron out
any problems which may develop
with the new stratagem.
The public-service system is
helpful, needed and inventive.
Now, if only the government
could devote a similar plan to
eliminate the nation's budget
deficit.
