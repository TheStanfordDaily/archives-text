## The
						hippie turned yuppie 
### 
THERE WERE a few things in life
which I used to hate, things which
kept me going. These things includ
ed chopped liver, the 49ers, and Residen
tial Education. Well, I still hate chopped
liver and the 49ers, but I am not so sure
about Res Ed.
Don't get me wrong, I am a member
of a fraternity with a well-honed aver
sion to anything that smells like resi
dential programming.
I remember a house meeting in my
freshman dorm when I was silenced by
a Residential Assistant because my
question challenged the intended mes
sage of a particular panel discussion. I
decided then and there that Res Ed was
a convenient Stanford euphemism for
multicultural thought police.
I dreamed up a conspiracy theory
which included the Grey Amendment,
threats to banish greek organizations, a
push for a dry campus, and the decision
to replace Plato with Popul Vuh in the
Cultures, Ideas and Values tracks. Boy
was I mad!
I now feel a little like the hippie
turned yuppie. I am an RA, albeit an
RA in a fraternity. While the invest
ment bankers of today reminisce about
Woodstock, I curiously look back upon
my freshman angst.
Have I mellowed in my old age? Have
I sold out my ideals for monetary gain?
The contradiction between Res Ed and

the Greek system seems so apparent,
many people probably never realized
there is an RA in each fraternity house.
Well, I will admit that the salary
accorded the RA and the sizable single
were influential in my decision to apply
for the job. But I also think that by the
time I applied for the job last year I had
a subconscious inclination that, like
most conspiracy theories, my early feel
ings about Res Ed were displaced.
This lesson was reinforced by one,
frankly hellish, week of RA training in
early September. Like a true Res Ed
hater would expect, the meetings were
long, repetitive, and full of popular psy
chology.
Diversity and community were the
flash words which everyone threw
around in discussion. I must admit that
there were moments when that exhila
rating freshmen angst returned to my
soul.
As I sat through training listening to
different people, however, behind the
facade of the conspiratorial monolith, I
found your generic bureaucratic
machine. Every person associated with
Res Ed whom I spoke with had a slight
ly different opinion about fraternities,
about alcohol usage, and about racial,
gender, and sexual diversity. While
there were certainly people I encoun
tered in the administration who shared
the positions which increased my

heart-rate freshman year, many others
appeared quite sympathetic to other
viewpoints. For this reason, in spite of
its length and trite nature, RA training
was not dogmatic. I was unable to find
a consistent party line against which I
could channel my anger.
I have learned that stereotyping is
not a phenomenon particular to race,
gender, religion, or sexual orientation.
Yes, organizations can be stereotyped
too. While organizations and institu
tions do take on a certain life of their
own, the influence of personality and
bureaucratic self-interest preclude
most monolithic conspiratorial struc
tures. There are people and offices
within Res Ed that I have learned to
trust, and maybe even like. There are
parts of Res Ed which still curdle my
blood.
Now that I have reconciled my fresh
man angst, I have all of this angry ener
gy with no place to go. My anger might
have found a home with those who
argue that fraternity RAs don't do any
work. Don't be fooled by what you ini
tially see.

It feels good to hate again
