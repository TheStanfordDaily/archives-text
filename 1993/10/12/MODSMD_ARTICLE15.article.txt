# Letters
## To Mom, from a loving son living in Escondido Village 
### 
DEAR MOM, In my last letter I
wrote how excited we were to be
moving onto the campus of a
world-class university. Well, I regret
to say we were overly optimistic. Yes,
we're on campus, but we live in what
many would call a slum — and we pay
$900/ month!
The day we moved in was a shock
er. The walls, cabinets and floors were
filthy. (We made the silly mistake of
not wearing shoes in the apartment.
At the end of that first day the bottom
of our socks were so black that our
washing machine couldn't get them
clean. So we trashed our socks, went
out and bought a carpet.)
The next rude awakening that our
ceiling and floors are filled with
asbestos. But the University says it's
not a problem, so long as no more
cracks or holes appear. Our neighbors
from Panama weren't so lucky — they
had to evacuate just after moving in

so the University could have their
apartment "abated." That family calls
this place "Esbestos Village," and we
suspect it's not because English is
their third language.
We also discovered our door frames
and moldings are painted with lead
paint. Again the University says we
shouldn't worry, just as long as baby
Jeremy doesn't eat any of the paint
chips which fall. So that inspires us to
vacuum every day, which I guess helps
keep the place cleaner.
When Jeremy locked himself in the
bathroom, we discovered very quickly
that our keys don't open the lock!
After a frantic few minutes we man
aged to jam it open with a coat hanger.
Not to worry, Mom — though shak
en and crying, Jeremy didn't get to the
medicine cabinet or fall into the toilet.
But what's troubling is that the Uni
versity doesn't feel much concern
about it. Our facilities supervisor

declined to provide a key to the bath
room door, and refused to remove the
lock.
Don't panic, though, Mom — I
wrote the University Counsel (the
legal department) detailing what hap
pened and put them on notice for
"strict liability" (landlords cannot
rent apartments that are unsafe).
You guessed it: someone immedi
ately came and removed the lock. It's
a shame you have to threaten a law
suit before the University will make
family apartments safe for children.
Enclosed are some new pictures.
Jeremy sure is growing, huh? Don't
worry about that ominous stuff
behind him in the photo. We keep him
away from all the broken boards and
protruding nails in the courtyard
fences. The Escondido supervisor said
they'd be fixed soon, though our
neighbor says that's been promised
for over a year.

"Don't people complain?" you are
no doubt wondering. Some do, but I
suspect the workload here precludes
much of anything but studying.
Also, so many of our international
neighbors have a different view of
what substandard housing is than
your spoiled American son who
expects his refrigerator to make ice.
Heck, our Ukrainian neighbors are
thrilled just to be on American soil.
And I don't blame them.
Well, I guess that's it. My classes
are terrific, the professors are bril
liant scholars, and I can understand
why Stanford is rated at the top aca
demically.
Unfortunately, we now also know
why a recent poll found Stanford
alumni satisfaction to be way down
the list.
