# Frosh in new Junipero claim bond, traditions with former Maderans
## 
### 
As a resident of a dorm that is going
through an identity crisis, I feel obligat
ed to let non-Junipero/Maderans know,
on behalf of my dorm, what we choose
to be called â€” Maderans!
First of all, Junipero is difficult to
say. I mean, who really knows how to
pronounce the name anyway? Besides,
when we say we live in Junipero,
returning students constantly ask,
"where's that?" We always have to clari
fy by saying, "Well, actually it's
Junipero/Madera." Junipero has no tra
dition and it lacks the sense of unity
that Madera holds for current and ex-
Maderans alike. Madera, meaning wood,

connotes strength, solidarity and dura
bility. I feel that this description is very
befitting for our dorm. Our dorm is full
of strong athletes, people with solid
morals and convictions and those who
are caring and helpful. We are relentless
in our academic and social endeavors
and we are determined to have the best
freshman dorm ever.
Many of you may wonder how all of
this really has to do with a name. How
ever, I believe that a sense of unity in a
dorm is virtually more important than
anything else for freshmen. Students
need to feel a sense of pride in their
dorm and moreover, they need to feel
that it is comfortable and homey. By
giving us two names the University has
caused unneccessary confusion and has
made our dorm feel a little out of place.
I mean when we told returning students
we would be living in Madera, they
would tell us it no longer exitsted and

that they didn't know where Junipero
was. Talk about making a little fresh
man freak out! My dormmates and I
have not had the luxury of knowing who
we really are as a dorm and what histo
ry and traditions have gone along with
our dorm's name.
So next time you ask what dorm
we're from and we energetically answer
"Madera," don't ask us why we have
loyalty to a name we have never known.
Just like ex-Maderans, we realize that
Madera is very special and that it is not
just a name.
Instead, Madera is like a force that
bonds students from all classes togeth
er. Being a Maderan is a respectable
thing because it brings so many differ
ent types of people together. Besides,
wouldn't Junipero Gras be a lame name
for a Mardi Gras party?
