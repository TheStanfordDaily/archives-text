# N'Gai Croal: notes of a non-native son
## Singing the praises of a noble Nobel prize-winner 
### 
It had occurred to Pecola some time ago
that if her eyes, those eyes that held the
pictures, and knew those sights — if those
eyes of hers were different, that is to say
beautiful, she herself would be different
— Tom Morrison, "The Bluest Eye"
I saw it, but I didn't believe it. I didn't
believe it what I saw.
— Senor Love Daddy, "Do the Right
Thing"
LAST WEEK, as I sat in The Daily's
offices browsing through the Asso
ciated Press wire service, I came
across a story that caused me to do a dou
ble-take. Toni Morrison had been award
ed the 1993 Nobel Prize for literature.
Richard Wright didn't get it. Neither
did James Baldwin. Nor did Ralph Elli
son. So you can understand my skepti
cism. I thought I was having a dream
long deferred. But it was true; Toni
Morrison was the first black American
to win the Nobel Prize in literature and
the first American woman to win since
1938, as well as the first native-born

American since Stanford's own John
Steinbeck.
You go girl.
It wasn't easy. When her 1987 novel
"Beloved" didn't win the National Book
Award, four dozen black writers wrote a
letter of protest to the New York Times.
That same year, "Beloved" won the
Pulitzer Prize, leading some to believe
that she'd been awarded the prize to
ward off further protests.
A body of work which includes "The
Bluest Eye," "Sula" and "Song of
Solomon" should be above reproach. In
awarding Morrison the Nobel, the selec
tion committee stated:
One can delight in her unique narra
tive technique, varying from book to book
and developed independently even
though its roots stem from Faulkner and
American writers from further south.
The lasting impression is, nevertheless,
sympathy, humanity, of the kind which
is always based upon profound humor.
Yet her few detractors hang about her
neck like the proverbial albatross. As Ice
Cube might say, "Here's what they think

about you." Charles Johnson, winner of
the 1990 National Book Award for his
novel about slavery, "Middle Passage,"
said that Morrison was "the beneficiary
of goodwill." He added that he would
have voted for Joyce Carol Oates, saying,
"She has a great body of work to show."
Watch out for the night train.
Noted critic Stanley Crouch (or Stan
ley Crotch, as Spike Lee has affection
ately dubbed him) was even more blunt.
The author of "Notes of a Hanging
Judge" said, "I hope this prize inspires
her to write better books."
Et tu, brute?
Every brotha ain't a brotha 'cause of
color. . . or to put it just as bluntly, shut
the fuck up. What good does it do for us
to tear down another's success? Instead
of calling Morrison up and criticizing
her to her face, these so-called men kick
their petty jealousies into high gear,
using Morrison's name and the New
York Times mud-slinging machine to
further their own ambitions — in the
best house nigga tradition. We can only
wonder how cheaply massa obtained

their disses.
There are yet other people who criti
cize Morrison for not writing in a way
that everyone can easily understand. I
ask them: should she limit herself to lin
ear narratives? Should she eschew analo
gies, metaphors and similies? Should she
refrain from trying to capture the poetry
of the spoken word in the written one? I
don't think so. True, her work doesn't
make for the easiest reading. But those
who challenge themselves and stick with
it will definitely be rewarded.
As for Morrison, her greatest chal
lenges still lie ahead of her. Not only
must she strive to maintain the high
standards of her previous work, but
she'd better make sure that Hollywood
doesn't do a "Joy Luck Club" on her
books. Oprah Winfrey bought the rights
to "Beloved," Spike Lee optioned "Sula,"
and the rest of Tinseltown is trying to
get their hands on anything else that
isn't nailed down. Once they get her to
sign on the line that is dotted, well, if
there's anything that Robert Altman's
"The Player" taught us, it's that the

writer is disposable. Novelists from
Michael Crichton to Alice Walker will
attest to that simple fact.
But let's not dwell on the negatives.
Toni Morrison has been awarded the
highest honor that a writer can hope to
receive. In doing so, the Nobel commit
tee has recognized stories of a history
that this country has either overlooked
or ignored. In doing so, the work of the
giants whose shoulders she stood is indi
rectly acknowledged. And in doing so,
Morrison has been admitted to a pan
theon that includes Faulkner, O'Neill
and Hemingway. May they be worth her
company.
You've come a long way, baby.

N'Gai's great-grandfather on his moth
er's side is Irish, but it definitely don't
make his brown eyes blue. His notes
appear here every Tuesday.
