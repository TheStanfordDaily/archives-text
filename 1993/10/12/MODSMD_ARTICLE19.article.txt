## A
						Dickensian tale of a Cardinal cross-country runner Team captain Truitt recounts frustrating two years while anticipating tremendous season

It has been the best of times. It has been
the worst of times.
For senior captain Sarah Truitt, Stanford
women's cross-country has been a tale of two
teams.
Truitt joined the Cardinal program as a
walk-on her freshman year. Under the guid
ance of then-head coach Brooks Johnson and
a handful of sophomores and upperclassmen,
she and nine other freshmen looked for their
collegiate careers to blossom.
But after the 1990-91 season, Truitt was
one of only three freshmen who decided to
return to the next year's squad.
According to Truitt, the team ran well ini
tially and were personally close. However,
the squad peaked too early, then injuries and
frustrations accrued; hence, Stanford did not
finish the year well.
. "Brooks [Johnson] was intense," Truitt
said. "He put a lot of stock in us because he
thought we could run better than we could.
He had so much success in the past with peo
ple like [two-time U.S. Olympian] PattiSue
[Plumerj, and he wanted that for us as well.
He would tell us, 'You all have the talent to
be national contenders. You can do this.' And
he expected you to do it."
Although Truitt felt that Johnson
demanded a great deal from the team, she

added that much of the psychological and
physical pressure may have come from with
in the runners themselves. At the time, Stan
ford was not even a contender in the Pacific
10 Conference.
"Sometimes I felt like I was running so
badly, I didn't want to be out there practic
ing," Truitt said. "The feeling was from with
in me."
"I have no bitterness from the Johnson
era," said Debbie Wells, who was the only
freshman from the '90 season who, aside
from Truitt, has remained with cross coun
try to the present day."I was frustrated by
my injuries. I never thought about the coach
ing."
Regardless of why many freshmen quit,
however, Truitt found herself coming out of
the 1990-91 season with bouts of personal
disappointment, injuries and, above all,
fewer teammates. Three sophomores and a
couple of juniors would comprise the return
ing nucleus. Still, Truitt looked toward her
sophomore year.
Little did she know that the worst of times
was not yet over.
For Truitt, the lowest point in her cross
country experience came her sophomore sea
son at a meet in Arizona. The night before
the race, Truitt recounted, then co-captain
Jill Shenkel visited her teammates and

Sarah Truitt leads a young Cardinal cross country team with a bright future. Pulling up the rear of the Pac-10 just two years
ago, Stanford is now a legitimate conference title contender.
