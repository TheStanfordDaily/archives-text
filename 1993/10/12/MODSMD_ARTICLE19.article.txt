## A 						Dickensian tale of a Cardinal cross-country runner Team captain Truitt recounts frustrating two years while anticipating tremendous season 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
It has been the best of times. It has been
the worst of times.
For senior captain Sarah Truitt, Stanford
women's cross-country has been a tale of two
teams.
Truitt joined the Cardinal program as a
walk-on her freshman year. Under the guid
ance of then-head coach Brooks Johnson and
a handful of sophomores and upperclassmen,
she and nine other freshmen looked for their
collegiate careers to blossom.
But after the 1990-91 season, Truitt was
one of only three freshmen who decided to
return to the next year's squad.
According to Truitt, the team ran well ini
tially and were personally close. However,
the squad peaked too early, then injuries and
frustrations accrued; hence, Stanford did not
finish the year well.
. "Brooks [Johnson] was intense," Truitt
said. "He put a lot of stock in us because he
thought we could run better than we could.
He had so much success in the past with peo
ple like [two-time U.S. Olympian] PattiSue
[Plumerj, and he wanted that for us as well.
He would tell us, 'You all have the talent to
be national contenders. You can do this.' And
he expected you to do it."
Although Truitt felt that Johnson
demanded a great deal from the team, she

added that much of the psychological and
physical pressure may have come from with
in the runners themselves. At the time, Stan
ford was not even a contender in the Pacific
10 Conference.
"Sometimes I felt like I was running so
badly, I didn't want to be out there practic
ing," Truitt said. "The feeling was from with
in me."
"I have no bitterness from the Johnson
era," said Debbie Wells, who was the only
freshman from the '90 season who, aside
from Truitt, has remained with cross coun
try to the present day."I was frustrated by
my injuries. I never thought about the coach
ing."
Regardless of why many freshmen quit,
however, Truitt found herself coming out of
the 1990-91 season with bouts of personal
disappointment, injuries and, above all,
fewer teammates. Three sophomores and a
couple of juniors would comprise the return
ing nucleus. Still, Truitt looked toward her
sophomore year.
Little did she know that the worst of times
was not yet over.
For Truitt, the lowest point in her cross
country experience came her sophomore sea
son at a meet in Arizona. The night before
the race, Truitt recounted, then co-captain
Jill Shenkel visited her teammates and

began to cry over injuries she had
sustained over the year. After the
meet, Shenkel quit. The day after
the competition, co-captain Ash
ley Black also left the team, sim
ply saying, according to Truitt, "I
have no desire to be racing on the
team."
The resignation of the captains
was particularly devastating, Tru
itt said, since the team got along
well with its leaders and looked up
to them. Shenkel and Black's
departure also left three sopho
mores and a group of freshmen to
prepare for Pac-lOs on their own.
"We were scared," Truitt said.
"I wondered, 'What's going to
become of us?' It was so lonely out
there in our workouts. There
wasn't any leadership at all."

At the end of that season,coach
Johnson also resigned. Only Tru
itt, Wells and a group of freshmen
would return for the 1992-1993
season.
To Truitt's relief, however,
women's cross country began to
take a promising turn during her
junior year, her first year as cap
tain. The Cardinal recruited
junior Louise Watson, who ended
up winning the District-8 title
that year, as well as young talent
such as freshmen Laura Hayward
and Beanie Dehlendorf, who con
tributed early in the season at the
annual Stanford Invitational.
According to Truitt, new head
coach Vin Lananna also provided
better coach-runner relations.
She thought there was little pres
sure form their new mentor, and
therefore there seemed to be no
conflict between runner and
coach. However, Truitt felt that
the women's team still searched

for leadership, identity and cohe
sion.
"We were absorbed into the
men's team," Truitt said. "They
had veterans like lAll-American
senior] Gary [Stolz]. I didn't run
much mileage training before
coach arrived, so I didn't know
where the runs were. The men
had to lead us. It was the same
socially. We would do what the
men's team would do."
There was also internal conflict
among the women.
"A lot of people seemed more
concerned about becoming one of
the top seven runners on the
team," she said. "Even I was like
that. I wasn't thinking about
heating [perennial power] Ore
gon."
But in the middle of the sea
son, the best of times finally
arrived.
"The team really had success at
Arizona that year," Truitt said.

"People felt happy, not mediocre.
It was the first time I felt like I
was racing in college ... I was on
a runner's high. I ran with Beanie
[Dehlendorf] to catch other peo
ple. We were out there competing
against other teams instead of
competing among ourselves."
Placing third at the Arizona
event, Truitt and her teammates
began to ride on their success. The
formerly lowly Cardinal women
finished fourth at Pac-lOs and
fourth at Districts, missing a
NCAA berth by merely 10 points.
"At Pac-lOs, I ran the best 5K I
ever ran," Truitt said. "I remem
ber sprinting by this Oregon
woman — that was really unique
for me. And at Districts, I felt
great, started passing people, and
finished 14th. That's what a run
ner's peak should be. It gives me a
sense that it's worth the work,
that I belong out there racing. It
wasn't like the humiliation I felt

sometimes in my freshman year."

And now, as senior captain, Tru
itt wants — and is finally able — to
help bring women's cross country
back to the times when cohesion,
leadership and confidence were not
worries, but the foundations of bet
ter things to come.
"Debbie, Louise and I want to
give young runners the support
we never had," Truitt said. "We'll
show them how college running
can be done without being con
sumed by the ghost and goblins of
training and homework. We'll
show them that running is fun
and racing is a celebration of hard
work."
In addition, Truitt hopes to
install several traditions to give the
women an identity separate from
the men's team. Already underway
are practices such as dining out
together and the sporting of nick
names such as "Brit Twit" for Wat
son and "Acorn" for Truitt.

But the fact that the Cardinal
are no longer cellar dwellers is of
enormous importance to Truitt.
The autumn of talented
returnees such as Truitt and
Watscn and an outstanding
recruiting class featuring the
likes of Kinney National Cross
Country champion Amanda
White has made the Cardinal
women thel2th-ranked team in
the nation, contenders for the
Pac-10 title and possible quali
fiers for the NCAA meet.
"We now have a sense of
pride," Truitt said. "We're going
to show all those schools who
thought Stanford couldn't do
anything. We want recognition
for what we do for Stanford. By
the time our freshmen become
upperclassmen, I want them to
think about the national title,
and not just about qualifying for
NCAAs. We're going to initiate
an era of domination."

Pac-10 title and possible quali
fiers for the NCAA meet.
"We now have a sense of
pride," Truitt said. "We're going
to show all those schools who
thought Stanford couldn't do
anything. We want recognition
for what we do for Stanford. By
the time our freshmen become
upperclassmen, I want them to
think about the national title,
and not just about qualifying for
NCAAs. We're going to initiate
an era of domination."
It has been the best of times. It has been
the worst of times.
For senior captain Sarah Truitt, Stanford
women's cross-country has been a tale of two
teams.
Truitt joined the Cardinal program as a
walk-on her freshman year. Under the guid
ance of then-head coach Brooks Johnson and
a handful of sophomores and upperclassmen,
she and nine other freshmen looked for their
collegiate careers to blossom.
But after the 1990-91 season, Truitt was
one of only three freshmen who decided to
return to the next year's squad.
According to Truitt, the team ran well ini
tially and were personally close. However,
the squad peaked too early, then injuries and
frustrations accrued; hence, Stanford did not
finish the year well.
. "Brooks [Johnson] was intense," Truitt
said. "He put a lot of stock in us because he
thought we could run better than we could.
He had so much success in the past with peo
ple like [two-time U.S. Olympian] PattiSue
[Plumerj, and he wanted that for us as well.
He would tell us, 'You all have the talent to
be national contenders. You can do this.' And
he expected you to do it."
Although Truitt felt that Johnson
demanded a great deal from the team, she

added that much of the psychological and
physical pressure may have come from with
in the runners themselves. At the time, Stan
ford was not even a contender in the Pacific
10 Conference.
"Sometimes I felt like I was running so
badly, I didn't want to be out there practic
ing," Truitt said. "The feeling was from with
in me."
"I have no bitterness from the Johnson
era," said Debbie Wells, who was the only
freshman from the '90 season who, aside
from Truitt, has remained with cross coun
try to the present day."I was frustrated by
my injuries. I never thought about the coach
ing."
Regardless of why many freshmen quit,
however, Truitt found herself coming out of
the 1990-91 season with bouts of personal
disappointment, injuries and, above all,
fewer teammates. Three sophomores and a
couple of juniors would comprise the return
ing nucleus. Still, Truitt looked toward her
sophomore year.
Little did she know that the worst of times
was not yet over.
For Truitt, the lowest point in her cross
country experience came her sophomore sea
son at a meet in Arizona. The night before
the race, Truitt recounted, then co-captain
Jill Shenkel visited her teammates and

ago, Stanford is now a legitimate conference title contender.
began to cry over injuries she had
sustained over the year. After the
meet, Shenkel quit. The day after
the competition, co-captain Ash
ley Black also left the team, sim
ply saying, according to Truitt, "I
have no desire to be racing on the
team."
The resignation of the captains
was particularly devastating, Tru
itt said, since the team got along
well with its leaders and looked up
to them. Shenkel and Black's
departure also left three sopho
mores and a group of freshmen to
prepare for Pac-lOs on their own.
"We were scared," Truitt said.
"I wondered, 'What's going to
become of us?' It was so lonely out
there in our workouts. There
wasn't any leadership at all."

At the end of that season,coach
Johnson also resigned. Only Tru
itt, Wells and a group of freshmen
would return for the 1992-1993
season.
To Truitt's relief, however,
women's cross country began to
take a promising turn during her
junior year, her first year as cap
tain. The Cardinal recruited
junior Louise Watson, who ended
up winning the District-8 title
that year, as well as young talent
such as freshmen Laura Hayward
and Beanie Dehlendorf, who con
tributed early in the season at the
annual Stanford Invitational.
According to Truitt, new head
coach Vin Lananna also provided
better coach-runner relations.
She thought there was little pres
sure form their new mentor, and
therefore there seemed to be no
conflict between runner and
coach. However, Truitt felt that
the women's team still searched

for leadership, identity and cohe
sion.
"We were absorbed into the
men's team," Truitt said. "They
had veterans like lAll-American
senior] Gary [Stolz]. I didn't run
much mileage training before
coach arrived, so I didn't know
where the runs were. The men
had to lead us. It was the same
socially. We would do what the
men's team would do."
There was also internal conflict
among the women.
"A lot of people seemed more
concerned about becoming one of
the top seven runners on the
team," she said. "Even I was like
that. I wasn't thinking about
heating [perennial power] Ore
gon."
But in the middle of the sea
son, the best of times finally
arrived.
"The team really had success at
Arizona that year," Truitt said.

"People felt happy, not mediocre.
It was the first time I felt like I
was racing in college ... I was on
a runner's high. I ran with Beanie
[Dehlendorf] to catch other peo
ple. We were out there competing
against other teams instead of
competing among ourselves."
Placing third at the Arizona
event, Truitt and her teammates
began to ride on their success. The
formerly lowly Cardinal women
finished fourth at Pac-lOs and
fourth at Districts, missing a
NCAA berth by merely 10 points.
"At Pac-lOs, I ran the best 5K I
ever ran," Truitt said. "I remem
ber sprinting by this Oregon
woman — that was really unique
for me. And at Districts, I felt
great, started passing people, and
finished 14th. That's what a run
ner's peak should be. It gives me a
sense that it's worth the work,
that I belong out there racing. It
wasn't like the humiliation I felt

sometimes in my freshman year."

And now, as senior captain, Tru
itt wants — and is finally able — to
help bring women's cross country
back to the times when cohesion,
leadership and confidence were not
worries, but the foundations of bet
ter things to come.
"Debbie, Louise and I want to
give young runners the support
we never had," Truitt said. "We'll
show them how college running
can be done without being con
sumed by the ghost and goblins of
training and homework. We'll
show them that running is fun
and racing is a celebration of hard
work."
In addition, Truitt hopes to
install several traditions to give the
women an identity separate from
the men's team. Already underway
are practices such as dining out
together and the sporting of nick
names such as "Brit Twit" for Wat
son and "Acorn" for Truitt.

But the fact that the Cardinal
are no longer cellar dwellers is of
enormous importance to Truitt.
The autumn of talented
returnees such as Truitt and
Watscn and an outstanding
recruiting class featuring the
likes of Kinney National Cross
Country champion Amanda
White has made the Cardinal
women thel2th-ranked team in
the nation, contenders for the
Pac-10 title and possible quali

son and "Acorn" for Truitt.

But the fact that the Cardinal
are no longer cellar dwellers is of
enormous importance to Truitt.
The autumn of talented
returnees such as Truitt and
Watscn and an outstanding
recruiting class featuring the
likes of Kinney National Cross
Country champion Amanda
White has made the Cardinal
women thel2th-ranked team in
the nation, contenders for the
Pac-10 title and possible quali
fiers for the NCAA meet.
"We now have a sense of
pride," Truitt said. "We're going
to show all those schools who
thought Stanford couldn't do
anything. We want recognition
for what we do for Stanford. By
the time our freshmen become
upperclassmen, I want them to
think about the national title,
and not just about qualifying for
NCAAs. We're going to initiate
an era of domination."
