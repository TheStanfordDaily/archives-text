# Strict fire-door policy may force retrofitting
## Officials won't allow open doors in Wilbur; replacement costs could reach $100,000 
### Elise Wolfgram Editorial staff 
In a move that may cost the University
thousands of dollars to remedy, county fire
officials said they will not allow students in
Wilbur I lall to keep their room doors open.
Asst. Santa Clara County Fire Marshal
Hal Hendrix said statements made by his
deputy, Allison Peha, last week regarding
the automatically closing fire doors in
Wilbur were misunderstood, and the no
tion that his office would ignore such safe
ty violations "really couldn't be further
from the truth."
Peha had told the Wilbur residence staff
that as long as students did not dismantle
the device that makes the door swing shut,
they would not be cited for propping the
doors open.
In the meantime, housing officials have
begun looking at possibilities for replacing
the self-closing doors. One option under

consideration is to purchase closing mech
anisms currently used in the Manzanita II
dormitories, where the doors close auto
matically only in the case of fire.
These closures cost at least $100 each,
Hendrix said. Keith Guy, director of Hous
ing and Food Services, said $100 is proba
bly a "low-end" figure. Replacing closures
for over 400 Wilbur doors, in addition to
labor and power costs, could add up to a
$100,000 or more.
"We're looking into alternatives," Guy
said. "Much of what our decision rests on is
the economics." He added that if the re
placement estimates are more than the
University can afford, the doors will have
to stay the same.
Hendrix said he hopes to educate stu
dents about the danger of leaving doors
blocked open. Fires can be contained in
hallways with closed doors or in rooms
with closed doors, but he said it
often becomes uncontainable
once it spreads from a room to a
hallway.
"My main concern is that there
are a lot of people out there with
dangerous misconceptions," he
said.
"We're going to educate and
encourage students to keep the
doors closed. We expect they'll
comply. But if we find [a viola
tion] we will enforce it."
Hendrix added that he "will
cite whoever is causing the prob
lem" for violations, which could
be either Stanford Housing or an
individual.
"In this case, Stanford Hous
ing has done their part," he said.
Guy said the decision to pur
chase these doors was made by
the architect in charge of the
Wilbur renovation project under
the supervision of the project
manager. He said that while the
architect picked the cheapest,
most maintenance-free option,
the closures are in conflict with

Residential Education's hope for
an "open-door" atmosphere.
"There's certainly no [fire
code] requirement for these other
closures," Guy said. "The thing
that wasn't thought about was
Res Ed and their desire for an
open environment."
Guy said he has been in con
tact with Res Ed since the year
began.
"We agree that we have to find
a solution that allows students to
have their doors open and resists
the fire," Guy said.
Diana Conklin, assistant direc
tor of Res Ed, said, "We're just
trying to help people on both sides
of the issue understand the other
side."
Guy said if a reasonably-priced
solution to the problem can be
found, they will begin to retrofit
the doors this quarter. In addi
tion, he said different plans will
be made for upcoming renova
tions of additional dorms, includ
ing Florence Moore Hall and
Stern Hall.
He added that the closures
removed from the Wilbur doors
would be used in the Escondido
Village high rises where "people
prefer [the doors) to be closed."
