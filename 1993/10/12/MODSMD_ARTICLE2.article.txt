# Strict fire-door policy may force retrofitting
## Officials won't allow open doors in Wilbur; replacement costs could reach $100,000 
### Elise Wolfgram Editorial staff 
In a move that may cost the University
thousands of dollars to remedy, county fire
officials said they will not allow students in
Wilbur I lall to keep their room doors open.
Asst. Santa Clara County Fire Marshal
Hal Hendrix said statements made by his
deputy, Allison Peha, last week regarding
the automatically closing fire doors in
Wilbur were misunderstood, and the no
tion that his office would ignore such safe
ty violations "really couldn't be further
from the truth."
Peha had told the Wilbur residence staff
that as long as students did not dismantle
the device that makes the door swing shut,
they would not be cited for propping the
doors open.
In the meantime, housing officials have
begun looking at possibilities for replacing
the self-closing doors. One option under

consideration is to purchase closing mech
anisms currently used in the Manzanita II
dormitories, where the doors close auto
matically only in the case of fire.
These closures cost at least $100 each,
Hendrix said. Keith Guy, director of Hous
ing and Food Services, said $100 is proba
bly a "low-end" figure. Replacing closures
for over 400 Wilbur doors, in addition to
labor and power costs, could add up to a
$100,000 or more.
"We're looking into alternatives," Guy
said. "Much of what our decision rests on is
the economics." He added that if the re
placement estimates are more than the
University can afford, the doors will have
to stay the same.
Hendrix said he hopes to educate stu
dents about the danger of leaving doors
blocked open. Fires can be contained in
hallways with closed doors or in rooms
