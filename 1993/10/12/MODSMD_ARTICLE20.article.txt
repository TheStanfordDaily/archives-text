# VonAppen laments lack of defense
## 'We're giving up more yards than a linen store or a Carpeteria.' 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Through the first five games
of the season, the Stanford
defense has accumulated a statis
tical portfolio during the large
amounts of time they have spent
on the field. Those numbers,
however, have not been encour
aging.
"We're giving up more yards
than a linen store or Carpeteria,"
said Stanford defensive coordina
tor Fred vonAppen. "We have to
get out of that mode. We're
becoming an embarrassment to
ourselves."
Indeed, a glance at the defen
sive statistics of Pacific 10 Con
ference teams reveals a common
thread: Stanford ranks last in all
four mggor categories. The Cardi
nal is at the bottom of the list for
rushing defense, passing defense,
scoring defense and total
defense.
Against the run, the Cardinal
defensive unit is giving up 265
yards per game, and has allowed
at least one opposing running
back to rush for 100 yards in
each game played this season.
"We're endeavoring to
improve that, but our penchant
has been giving up big plays —
that's where most of those yards
come from," vonAppen said.
"We'll play respectably for a
while and then we'll give up a big
play down the field.
"That was our forte last year,
third-down conversion and

inability to let people run the
football on us. But we had an
experienced defense that was
battle-tested and had played
together for a couple years.
That's not the case with this
one.

The loss of seven defensive
starters from last year's squad
thrust many inexperienced play
ers directly to the forefront. The
secondary only returned one
player — senior Vaughn Bryant
— who played a significant num
ber of minutes last season. In
addition, injuries to Tommy
Knecht and Eliel Swinton have
forced would-be backups to
instead step into front-line jobs.
"We've had to revolve a lot of
people in the secondary," vonAp
pen said. "You'd like to stabilize
that position with five guys play
ing all the time, but due to injury
and circumstance that has not
been the case.
"It's tough on the young guys
playing that position because
when a mistake is made in front
of 80,000 people in space, every
body sees it, whereas a lineman
who gets trapped inside and a

run goes for seven or eight more
yards than it should, the average
guy in the stands will not see that
one and will wonder why he
didn't get stopped sooner in prox
imity to the line of scrimmage.
We (the coaches) then have to act
as resident psychologists and try
to get them back to normalcy."
Though the Cardinal is giving
up an average of 500 yards per
contest, there have been some
encouraging signs for the defense.
Free safety Kevin Garnett leads
the Pac-10 in tackles per game,
and teammate Coy Gibbs ranks
fifth in the league in that category.
"I'm feeling comfortable back
there, but I still have a long way
to go," Garnett said. "We've
made some progress. The week
off has helped us to continue to
improve (with extra practice)."
Ironically, the play of the Car
dinal offense has contributed to
the haphazard performance of
the defense. Because Stanford
has not been able to establish the
running game, most Stanford
scoring drives take the form of a
quick series of passing plays. So
instead of getting time on the
sidelines to rest, the defense usu
ally returns to the field having
little chance to catch its breath —
and consequently tires easily.
"I don't think we've been a
football team that has comple
mented one another very well,"
vonAppen said. "We have an
offense that's somewhat flamboy
ant, but the duration of drives are
sometimes very short and we're

in a position where we need to
spend some time off the field if we
can. Our inability to run the foot
ball has been telling, our errors in
the kicking game have been
telling, and we're young enough
and inexperienced enough under
fire that any errors we make are
easily magnified."
It is that extra bit of energy
which becomes crucial when the
defense has to defend against an
opposing offense with quick ath
letes. That factor in large part
contributed to the success of Col
orado and Notre Dame in run
ning the option play.
"We've had people in position
to play the option and if they'd
take the people they're assigned
to take the option wouldn't look
so devastating," vonAppen said.
"The option has hurt us. Until we
play with effort and consistency
throughout, and those sound like
standard bromides, we're going
to continue to struggle. If you
have lapses when you're as young
as we are the results will probably
be semi-disastrous."
Yet vonAppen feels that his
defensive continues to learn from
its mistakes, and is hopeful that
those errors will diminish as the
season progresses.
"I think down the road we'll
be pretty good," vonAppen said.
"The problem is living through
the present. It behooves us as
coaches to be patient. We're 2-3
and we'd like to be better, and
the only way to get better is to
keep working hard."
