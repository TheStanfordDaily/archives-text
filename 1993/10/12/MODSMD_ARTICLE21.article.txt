# Athletes of the Week

Attack. Kill. Score. Win. These four words
are likely the credo of the Daily's Athletes of
the Week, Jeremy Laster and Anne Wicks.
For these competitors each posted prodigious
scoring totals over the weekend, and while
only Laster's water polo team came away
from the weekend with a tournament victory,
the individual accomplishments of both
Laster and Wicks are worthy of praise.

Laster and the No. 1-ranked men's water
polo team dominated the Northern California
Tournament, compiling a 6-0 record on their
way to the title. In these six games against the
nation's top teams, Laster rang up 13 goals,
including four in the championship match
against archrival California. Laster's scoring
was also well-balanced; he was the only Stan
ford player to score in all six of his team's
matches. For his efforts, Laster was named to
the all-tournament team. Laster came to
Stanford by way of San Clemente High School
and clearly seems to be on the way to Cardinal
stardom.
"Jeremy was setting and guarding the
hole. He is one of the best hole guards in the
nation," said Cardinal head coach Dante Det
tamanti. "He was also shooting well from out
side and getting his shots at opportune times.
He's really gaining confindence and improv
ing on his freshman year."

While the 13 goals that Laster scored
during the NorCal tournament is an
impressive statistic, it is rivaled by the .450
hitting percentage that Anne Wicks posted
during this weekend's Stanford/Bank of
America Tournament. When compared to
an "average" hitting percentage of approxi
mately .290 by other top-flight college play
ers, the grandeur of Wick's accomplishment
is clear.
As a part of this average, the middle block

er accumulated 10 kills. Furthermore, the
junior from Minnesota recorded 10 digs â€”
a personal career high which earned her a
spot on the all-tournament team. Unfortu
nately, the Cardinal was only able to earn
second-place honors in the competition,
dropping the championship match to the
University of Pacific after topping second
ranked Texas on Friday evening.
