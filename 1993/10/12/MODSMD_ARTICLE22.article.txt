# Amphibians, fowl forecast Big Game

### 
Gone are our national title
aspirations. The Rose
Bowl? A pipe dream. Mid
way through the season, distrac
tions like these have gone the way
of the Edsel. It's time we got back
to the basics.
The Axe.
Who cares if Big Game is over a
month away? Christmas is eons
away and my mom's already fin
ished half her shopping.
Stanford has held the Axe since
1987. And things look good again
this year. Examine the numbers:

The records: We're 2-3 and
unranked. California is 5-1 and
ranked as high as No. 17. These
figures alone make the Cardinal
clear favorites in the season
finale. Only twice since 1985 has
the team with the better record
entering Big Game left with the
Axe.
But this particular prognosti
cating tool took a beating last
year, when an 8-3 Stanford team
pounded a hapless 4-6 Cal team,
41-21. Which leads us to cosmic
source No. 2. . . .
The salamander factor. Clouds
of gloom spread over campus last
week when the University can
celled the annual Big Game Bon
fire to protect the California tiger
salamander, an endangered
species living in the bed of Lake
Lagunita.
The Coyote Creek Riparian
Center, commissioned by Stan
ford to estimate the area's sala
mander population, gauged the
number of the critters living in
Lagunita to be in the 400 range.
This figure, derived by count
ing both live animals and "road
kills," according to Coyote Creek
spokesperson Mike Rigney, would
decline with continued Bonfire
activities. Rigney, not one to hide
behind fancy scientific terminolo
gy, stated the obvious: "A bonfire
undoubtedly cooks quite a few of
the salamanders that live in the
cracks" of Lake Lag. Yum.
Threatened for the last few
years because of the noise and
smoke pollution problems it caus
es, the Bonfire is officially a thing
of the past. A 95-year old tradi
tion, wiped away by 400 lousy
salamanders . . . not a good omen
for Big Game this year, right?
Wrong. Axe Committee mem
bers, before you scramble to set
up a Big Game laser light show to
replace the Bonfire, consider the
numbers.
In 1976, the Bonfire was can
celled when two frat guys were
ir\jured trying to lift a telephone
pole into place for the fire. The
event wasn't held again until
1986. In 1989, the Bonfire was

cancelled again due to a lack of
ASSU funding.
But in those 11 years in which
no Bonfire was held, the Cardinal
sported a 7-4 Big Game record.
Still, the salamanders aren't
strong enough evidence for a
Stanford win? Take a gander at
our third forecaster. . . .
The rooster factor: Yes, this is
the Year of the Rooster on the
Chinese calendar. With 12 ani
mals rotating on'
cycles, the Chinese calendar is
seldom used in today's Augustan
calendar-oriented society. How
ever, it has proven itself to be
one of the more effective Big
Game prediction tools on the
market.
The Year of the Rooster
belongs to the Cardinal. Stanford
hasn't lost on a Rooster year since
1921, when it was downed 42-7 at
home by the Golden Bears.
Interesting, you say, but not
convincing. Cal has the better
team this year; Cal will win Big
Game. You're not the only one
thinking that way, which brings
us to. . . .
The prediction factor: "Cal is
the best team in the Pac-10 that
can go to a bowl," said Washing
ton defensive end D'Marco Farr
after the Huskies defeated the
Bears 24-23 on Saturday. "Cal is
going to be the Rose Bowl team."
Cal is going to be the Rose Bowl
team. It makes sense if you're a
Golden Bear fan. Cal narrowly
lost to Washington, the Pac-10
Rose Bowl representative three
years running. With Washington
ineligible for postseason play, the
Bears should be shoo-ins this
year.
But with one conference defeat
already under its belt, Cal proba
bly has to win all of its remaining
conference games to take the Pac
-10 title. Which means that the
Bears must win Big Game to go to
the Rose Bowl. Which means that
Farr was predicting a Cal Big
Game victory when he said that
the Bears would go to the Rose
Bowl.
Whoa. Maybe I'm overhypoth
esizing here, but I can't help sali
vating whenever anyone predicts
a Cal Big Game win.
It all sounds remarkably simi
lar to 1991, when Cal broke out to
a 5-1 start while the Cardinal
began its year at 2-3.
That was the year that Golden
Bear wide receiver Brian Treggs
said that if Cal didn't win Big
Game, he'd buy a house in Palo
Alto.
That was the year Stanford
downed Cal 38-21.
Stanford plays five more games
before the Bears visit the Stadium
to close out the season. Statistical
ly speaking, we've got a porous
defense, an impotent running
game and a non-existent pass
rush. Cal has one of the most
highly-touted offenses in the con
ference, a top-name quarterback
and a defense which held Wash
ington's Heisman Trophy candi
date Napoleon Kaufman to 78
yards on 21 carries.
You've got to like our chances.
