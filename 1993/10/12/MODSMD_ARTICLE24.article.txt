# Stanford, Cambridge Presses join forces
## Partnership to strengthen financial situation of Stanford Press 
### Megan Himan 
The recently formed partnership
between the Stanford and Cambridge
University Presses has been a "win-win"
situation for both, says Norris Pope, act
ing director of Stanford Press.
The collaboration, which was finalized in
July, is part of Stanford University Press's
efforts to improve its finances, according to
Pope. In addition, the press was looking to
strengthen its overall appeal in the indus
try.
"Presses are in the prestige business
more than anything else," said Pope. "An
important part of this association is that it
will improve our standing."
He added that "this collaboration is
financially advantageous . . . because we
should get better authors and better
books."
Pope said Stanford Press will benefit
greatly from Cambridge's strengths in
the physical sciences and distribution,
two areas which had been weak in the

past for Stanford Press because of its
small size.
One of the terms of the partnership is
that Cambridge will distribute and market
all Stanford Press titles outside North
America.
But the major responsibility of this part
nership is to develop the "Stanford-Cam
bridge Program."
This program, published exclusively by
Cambridge, will seek out texts, initially in
the physical, mathematical and biological
sciences, and publish them under the pro
gram name. This is unique in North Ameri
ca because the presses are jointly sponsor
ing the texts in this program.
Other presses are often involved in co
publishing arrangements, in which each
press publishes a text under its own name.
Stanford Press will receive royalties for
books published in the program, Pope
said.
In addition, Cambridge acquired another
headquarters for its North American busi
ness. "Cambridge has long wanted a West

Coast office," Pope said, "and we have long
wanted effective international distribu
tion."
The Cambridge Press has a sign outside
the Stanford Press's building, as well as
offices at the Stanford Press for two Cam
bridge editors, Catherine Flack and Alan
Harvey, who are responsible for finding
new books for the Stanford-Cambridge
Program.
"The Cambridge Press wanted to portray
ourselves as an American publisher as well
as an English one," said Harvey. "To com
pete in the American market we needed to
demonstrate that we're serious about it."
Cambridge Press also has an office in New
York.
Pope said he expects Stanford Press's
revenue to increase as a result of the part
nership, as well as greater satisfaction from
Stanford authors. "Stanford faculty have
already been pleased to see their books
advertised in the Times Literary Supple
ment as part of this partnership," said
Pope.
