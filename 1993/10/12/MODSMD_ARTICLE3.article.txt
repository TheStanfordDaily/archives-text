## Students escalate drive for Asian-American studies program 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
Anxious not to miss the boat while under
graduate education and its budget are re-eval
uated, Asian student-group leaders plan to
push forward initiatives to investigate the fea
sibility of an Asian-American studies program
this year.
"With the University changing its focus in
education, now is the time to get our word in,"
sophomore Jerry Chen said. "We have to do it
now, before the budget is changed and plans
are finalized."
Meanwhile, members of the Asian-Ameri
can community say that the ambivalent state

of History Prof. Gordon Chang's future at
Stanford also signals uncertainty for the fu
ture of their goals.
One of two regular faculty who teach Asian-
American studies courses at Stanford, Chang
was denied tenure last spring, prompting some
students and faculty to seriously question the
future of an Asian-American studies program
at Stanford.
Chen, an active member of the group Asians
and Pacific Islanders for Education and
Change at Stanford (APECS), hopes that all
the student enthusiasm and activist leanings
of the past year will not evaporate.
"We got a lot of attention last year with the
protest," he said. "And we want to use that mo

mentum to carry on this year." Students held a
rally last spring in White Plaza to protest the
lack of an Asian-American studies program at
Stanford, where about one-quarter of the stu
dent body is of Asian descent.
Rejuvenating interest
APECS, a student group founded last year,
was designed to be a more "action-oriented"
group that would collaborate with Asian Amer
ican Student Association in promoting the con
cept of Asian-American studies to the Stanford
community, Chen said. The group is composed
of about 12-15 returning members from last
year.
Slated on the group's agenda
is the organization of a series of
workshops that would bring
together administration, stu
dents, faculty and staff to discuss
the logistical possibilities of orga
nizing an Asian-American stud
ies program. The group would
examine the "nuts and bolts" of a
potential program, such as a bud
get, faculty support and cross
listing of classes, according to
Chen.
However, because of student
turnover and the time needed to
re-coordinate, a concrete sched
ule is yet to be established. "We
don't want to jump in unpre
pared — especially at a school
like Stanford," Chen said. "We
want to do it right."
Chen also said that Chang's
absence — he is currently on
leave — pushed the workshops
back further.
Working in conjunction with
APECS, the AASA Issues Com
mittee is putting together a
speaker series for a proposed
class on Asian-American commu

nity service issues that would
begin winter quarter, if all goes
according to planned. Potential
speakers include former Los
Angeles mayoral candidate
Michael Woo, members of under
privileged Asian communities
and Stanford faculty.
Senior Jon Chow, AASA
Issues Committee co-chair,
said such a class would fulfill
an important role because "a
lot of Asian-Americans have to
educate themselves" about
"what it means to be Asian-
American."
"If not for chance encounters
in community service, I
wouldn't have learned about my
history," Chow said. "I think it's
just sad."
Chow added that he thought
such a class would have much to
offer the non-Asian community
too. "It's not even for just Asian-
Americans," he said. "So much of
American history comes from the
contributions of immigrants."
Bringing in professors
Asian-American community
members cite examples of
progress toward an institutional
ized program, but are doubtful
about the University's long-term
commitment.

The Irvine Foundation —
which helps promote multicul
tural studies in California uni
versities — has currently
brought two short-term faculty
members specializing in Asian-
American studies, to Stanford
and increased the total number
of classes relevant to the subject
this year from four to five.
However, many say the cur
rent budget crisis will still
require intense scrutiny of all
new proposals.
One who has already endured
this scrutiny is Chang, one of
only two regular faculty who
teach Asian-American studies
courses, along with Comparative
Literature Prof. David Palumbo-
Liu. Some say the future of
Asian-American studies will be
heavily influenced by whether
Chang decides to stay at Stan
ford.
"Gordon Chang is also a
tenured professor at (UC-)
Irvine," Palumbo-Liu noted.
Chang, who is currently on
leave from Stanford for a year,
should make his decision by
January, according to Palum
bo-Liu. Chang was denied
tenure at Stanford last spring,
sending a negative message to
potential Asian-American stud

ies faculty.
"It's not the end of the world
for Gordon, but it does question
the credibility of the University's
commitment to multicultural
ism," Palumbo-Liu said. "Gor
don and I are not entirely happy
with things, but there can be pos
itive resolutions to various
issues."
Regarding the future of Asian-
American studies at Stanford,
Palumbo-Liu said, "Let's just say
that there's a lot of issues that
have to be addressed, and the
jury's still out."
Because of this uncertainty,
students such as Chow say they
are frustrated that the school is
putting an undue burden on stu
dents to develop the program.
"It distresses me when the
University talks of diversity, and
we've yet to see commitment,"
Chow said. "The students defi
nitely are working out a lot of
roadblocks.
"But our job is to learn, not to
teach, and it seems we have to do
everything. The initiative is all
with the students," Chow added.
Palumbo-Liu, Chen and Chow
all echoed the need to make
progress incrementally and
develop a foundation of classes
and faculty before a proposal can

be seriously entertained.
"For the administration to
legitimize this, they must be con
vinced of its importance,"
Palumbo-Liu said. "It's impor

tant to sit down in a non
demanding situation with as may
people as possible, minorities of
each color and non-minority stu
dents too."

teach, and it seems we have to do
everything. The initiative is all
with the students," Chow added.
Palumbo-Liu, Chen and Chow
all echoed the need to make
progress incrementally and
develop a foundation of classes
and faculty before a proposal can

be seriously entertained.
"For the administration to
legitimize this, they must be con
vinced of its importance,"
Palumbo-Liu said. "It's impor

tant to sit down in a non
demanding situation with as may
people as possible, minorities of
each color and non-minority stu
dents too."

Garheng Kong speaks at last year's rally to protest the lack of an
Asian-American studies major. This year, members of a pro-Asian
studies group are planning workshops to discuss the logistics of
such a program.
Anxious not to miss the boat while under
graduate education and its budget are re-eval
uated, Asian student-group leaders plan to
push forward initiatives to investigate the fea
sibility of an Asian-American studies program
this year.
"With the University changing its focus in
education, now is the time to get our word in,"
sophomore Jerry Chen said. "We have to do it
now, before the budget is changed and plans
are finalized."
Meanwhile, members of the Asian-Ameri
can community say that the ambivalent state

of History Prof. Gordon Chang's future at
Stanford also signals uncertainty for the fu
ture of their goals.
One of two regular faculty who teach Asian-
American studies courses at Stanford, Chang
was denied tenure last spring, prompting some
students and faculty to seriously question the
future of an Asian-American studies program
at Stanford.
Chen, an active member of the group Asians
and Pacific Islanders for Education and
Change at Stanford (APECS), hopes that all
the student enthusiasm and activist leanings
of the past year will not evaporate.
"We got a lot of attention last year with the
protest," he said. "And we want to use that mo

mentum to carry on this year." Students held a
rally last spring in White Plaza to protest the
lack of an Asian-American studies program at
Stanford, where about one-quarter of the stu
dent body is of Asian descent.
Rejuvenating interest
APECS, a student group founded last year,
was designed to be a more "action-oriented"
group that would collaborate with Asian Amer
ican Student Association in promoting the con
cept of Asian-American studies to the Stanford
community, Chen said. The group is composed
of about 12-15 returning members from last
year.
Slated on the group's agenda
is the organization of a series of
workshops that would bring
together administration, stu
dents, faculty and staff to discuss
the logistical possibilities of orga
nizing an Asian-American stud
ies program. The group would
examine the "nuts and bolts" of a
potential program, such as a bud
get, faculty support and cross
listing of classes, according to
Chen.
However, because of student
turnover and the time needed to
re-coordinate, a concrete sched
ule is yet to be established. "We
don't want to jump in unpre
pared — especially at a school
like Stanford," Chen said. "We
want to do it right."
Chen also said that Chang's
absence — he is currently on
leave — pushed the workshops
back further.
Working in conjunction with
APECS, the AASA Issues Com
mittee is putting together a
speaker series for a proposed
class on Asian-American commu

nity service issues that would
begin winter quarter, if all goes
according to planned. Potential
speakers include former Los
Angeles mayoral candidate
Michael Woo, members of under
privileged Asian communities
and Stanford faculty.
Senior Jon Chow, AASA
Issues Committee co-chair,
said such a class would fulfill
an important role because "a
lot of Asian-Americans have to
educate themselves" about
"what it means to be Asian-
American."
"If not for chance encounters
in community service, I
wouldn't have learned about my
history," Chow said. "I think it's
just sad."
Chow added that he thought
such a class would have much to
offer the non-Asian community
too. "It's not even for just Asian-
Americans," he said. "So much of
American history comes from the
contributions of immigrants."
Bringing in professors
Asian-American community
members cite examples of
progress toward an institutional
ized program, but are doubtful
about the University's long-term
commitment.

The Irvine Foundation —
which helps promote multicul
tural studies in California uni
versities — has currently
brought two short-term faculty
members specializing in Asian-
American studies, to Stanford
and increased the total number
of classes relevant to the subject
this year from four to five.
However, many say the cur
rent budget crisis will still
require intense scrutiny of all
new proposals.
One who has already endured
this scrutiny is Chang, one of
only two regular faculty who
teach Asian-American studies
courses, along with Comparative
Literature Prof. David Palumbo-
Liu. Some say the future of
Asian-American studies will be
heavily influenced by whether
Chang decides to stay at Stan
ford.
"Gordon Chang is also a
tenured professor at (UC-)
Irvine," Palumbo-Liu noted.
Chang, who is currently on
leave from Stanford for a year,
should make his decision by
January, according to Palum
bo-Liu. Chang was denied
tenure at Stanford last spring,
sending a negative message to
potential Asian-American stud

ies faculty.
"It's not the end of the world
for Gordon, but it does question
the credibility of the University's
commitment to multicultural
ism," Palumbo-Liu said. "Gor
don and I are not entirely happy
with things, but there can be pos
itive resolutions to various
issues."
Regarding the future of Asian-
American studies at Stanford,
Palumbo-Liu said, "Let's just say
that there's a lot of issues that
have to be addressed, and the
jury's still out."
Because of this uncertainty,
students such as Chow say they
are frustrated that the school is
putting an undue burden on stu
dents to develop the program.
"It distresses me when the
University talks of diversity, and
we've yet to see commitment,"
Chow said. "The students defi
nitely are working out a lot of
roadblocks.
"But our job is to learn, not to
teach, and it seems we have to do
everything. The initiative is all
with the students," Chow added.
Palumbo-Liu, Chen and Chow
