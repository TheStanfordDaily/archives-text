## Students escalate drive for Asian-American studies program 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
Anxious not to miss the boat while under
graduate education and its budget are re-eval
uated, Asian student-group leaders plan to
push forward initiatives to investigate the fea
sibility of an Asian-American studies program
this year.
"With the University changing its focus in
education, now is the time to get our word in,"
sophomore Jerry Chen said. "We have to do it
now, before the budget is changed and plans
are finalized."
Meanwhile, members of the Asian-Ameri
can community say that the ambivalent state

of History Prof. Gordon Chang's future at
Stanford also signals uncertainty for the fu

One of two regular faculty who teach Asian-
American studies courses at Stanford, Chang
was denied tenure last spring, prompting some
students and faculty to seriously question the
future of an Asian-American studies program
at Stanford.
Chen, an active member of the group Asians
and Pacific Islanders for Education and
Change at Stanford (APECS), hopes that all
the student enthusiasm and activist leanings
of the past year will not evaporate.
"We got a lot of attention last year with the
protest," he said. "And we want to use that mo

mentum to carry on this year." Students held a
rally last spring in White Plaza to protest the
lack of an Asian-American studies program at
Stanford, where about one-quarter of the stu
dent body is of Asian descent.
Rejuvenating interest
APECS, a student group founded last year,
was designed to be a more "action-oriented"
group that would collaborate with Asian Amer
ican Student Association in promoting the con
cept of Asian-American studies to the Stanford
community, Chen said. The group is composed
of about 12-15 returning members from last
