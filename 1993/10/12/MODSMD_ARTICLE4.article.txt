# Asbestos hazard to close Hoover building
## 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
The Lou Henry Hoover Building will be
shut down in the next two or three weeks be
cause asbestos that was sprayed onto its steel
frame more than 25 years ago has now cont
aminated other areas of the building.
The asbestos was found on Oct. 2 after oc
cupants complained about poor air circula
tion in the building, which is next to Hoover
Tower. This problem prompted a Facilities
inspection of the ventilation system, during
which asbestos was found in the ducting and
mechanical room, said Bill Witscher, director
of Facilities operations.

While Hoover Institution staff are still
working in the building, the ventilation sys
tem has been shut off until the contaminated
material is removed.
Even though the levels of asbestos are well
below what would be considered hazardous
to people's health, the building must be shut
down during "asbestos abatement," which
entails eliminating the asbestos from the
building.
However, the building is being evacuated
because of the possibility that asbestos could
leak into the open air and ventilation sys
tems while the material is being removed
from the second floor ducting, Witscher said.
"This was a blow, shock and a concern be

cause it was the first case ever detected with
(asbestos) material in the ventilation sys
tem," Hoover Institution director John
Raisian said.
The date for the asbestos abatement is
contingent upon finding new space for the
Hoover Fellows and other staff members
who use the building. Raisian said he will
hold a staff meeting today to discuss the sit
uation with the building's nearly 50 occu
pants.
Witscher said evacuating the building is a
purely "precautionary" measure, adding
that Facilities is hopeful that new space to
relocate the occupants will be
found in the next two or three
weeks.
Hoover Senior Research Fel
low John Dunlop expressed con
fidence that the University

would look out for its employees'
best interest. "I expect that the
institution will take the proper
steps to ensure that all of our
health is good," he said.
No health problems have been
reported due to the asbestos,
Witscher said.
A date for the re-opening of
the asbestos-free building has
not been scheduled.
