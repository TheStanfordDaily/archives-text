### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
Some of last weekend's com
munity service-based "First Year
Trips" met with disappointment
from several participants,
prompting many to quit their
trips midway.
Student criticism centered on
two of the public-service trips,
"Health Care: HIV and AIDS"
and "Youth in East Palo Alto."
The trips, which ran Friday
through Sunday, were sponsored
by the student organization
Recreational Educational Devel

While First Year Trips are usu

REDWOOD also developed sever

he said, adding that he returned
to his dorm room to sleep.
"I didn't sign up for this to
sleep on campus," he said.
On Saturday, Chanani's group
drove to East Palo Alto where
they spent the day working to ren

Chanani felt the First Year Trips
brochure had misrepresented the
program.
"I felt I was misled about what
we would be doing. [The
brochure] said we would see East
Palo Alto through a child's eyes,
and I met one child all day,"he
said. "It |also] bothered me that
we were doing it at a private
school rather than a public
school."
Lastly, Chanani said he was
confused about how his $75 fee
was used. "I don't know where my
