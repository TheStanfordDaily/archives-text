# Frosh service trips criticized by some
## 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
Some of last weekend's com
munity service-based "First Year
Trips" met with disappointment
from several participants,
prompting many to quit their
trips midway.
Student criticism centered on
two of the public-service trips,
"Health Care: HIV and AIDS"
and "Youth in East Palo Alto."
The trips, which ran Friday
through Sunday, were sponsored
by the student organization
Recreational Educational Devel
opmental Workshops Out of
Doors (REDWOOD).
While First Year Trips are usu
ally associated with the outdoors,
REDWOOD also developed sever
al public-service trips. Incoming
freshmen participating in the pro
gram were asked to rank their
preferences for trips, and were as
signed accordingly. Both the pub
lic-service and outdoor trips cost
$75.
Freshman Kevin Wang, who
did not return to his "Health
Care" trip on Saturday, said he
felt he was not getting his
money's worth. Trip members
spent Friday evening volunteer
ing at an AIDS conference in San

Jose.
"It's not justifiable that you
pay 75 bucks and volunteer at a
conference," he said. "It wasn't a
lot of fun."
Freshman Nikhil Chanani,
who attended the "Youth in East
Palo Alto" trip, also quit because
he felt he had been misguided.
"We met Friday night and we
slept in a Row house, but I left,"
he said, adding that he returned
to his dorm room to sleep.
"I didn't sign up for this to
sleep on campus," he said.
On Saturday, Chanani's group
drove to East Palo Alto where
they spent the day working to ren
ovate an elementary school.
Chanani felt the First Year Trips
brochure had misrepresented the
program.
"I felt I was misled about what
we would be doing. [The
brochure] said we would see East
Palo Alto through a child's eyes,
and I met one child all day,"he
said. "It |also] bothered me that
we were doing it at a private
school rather than a public
school."
Lastly, Chanani said he was
confused about how his $75 fee
was used. "I don't know where my
money went," he said.
Wang said that volunteers on the
"Health Care" trip were asked to
sleep in Potter Lounge on campus,
but they, too, returned to their
dorm rooms.
Trip coordinators explained
that poor organization, not the
programs themselves, led to the
frustration.
REDWOOD program coordina
tor Kathryn Chen explained that
the public service trips were

impaired by a staff shake-up late in
the trips' planning — "so we basi
cally had to start from scratch."
Wang and Chanani said they
would not blame the situations on
their group leaders, who had little
time to prepare. The upperclass
leaders of "Youth in East Palo
Alto," sophomores Vanessa Alvara
do and Beatriz Esparza, "were great
people," according to Chanani. "I
don't blame them at all," he said.
Alvarado defended her trip
amid the student criticism. "We
did a lot of cleaning [at Shule
Mandela School], and we could
tell that when we left everything
was better-looking," she said.

"For the students especially, actu
ally seeing the kids made it much
more enjoyable."
She acknowledged that volun
teers didn't get to work with chil
dren from East Palo Alto as much
as they would have liked, adding
that the group performed the kind
of "grunt work" that is necessary
but not "all fun in the sun."
Chen agreed that the public
service trips need a degree of refin
ing, but said she was pleased with
the trips overall. "Our public-ser
vice trips have a lot to improve on.
[They] may involve a lot more
planning than some of the outdoor
trips do," she said. "Of course, this

is the first year we have done this.
Everything ran on schedule, [so it
hasl definitely been a success from
our perspectives."
Chanani — who said that other
students he talked to were also
upset — stressed that he did not
want to come off as completely
negative. "I do think that they
should continue to do the pro
gram," he said, citing poor plan
ning as the trip's biggest problem.
"If they had, for example, set
up a slumber party for some of
the kids from East Palo Alto"
with the Stanford volunteers, he
said, "it would have been a lot
more worthwhile."

Trips" met with disappointment
from several participants,
prompting many to quit their
trips midway.
Student criticism centered on
two of the public-service trips,
"Health Care: HIV and AIDS"
and "Youth in East Palo Alto."
The trips, which ran Friday
through Sunday, were sponsored
by the student organization
Recreational Educational Devel
opmental Workshops Out of
Doors (REDWOOD).
While First Year Trips are usu
ally associated with the outdoors,
REDWOOD also developed sever
al public-service trips. Incoming
freshmen participating in the pro
gram were asked to rank their
preferences for trips, and were as
signed accordingly. Both the pub
lic-service and outdoor trips cost
$75.
Freshman Kevin Wang, who
did not return to his "Health
Care" trip on Saturday, said he
felt he was not getting his
money's worth. Trip members
spent Friday evening volunteer
ing at an AIDS conference in San

Jose.
"It's not justifiable that you
pay 75 bucks and volunteer at a
conference," he said. "It wasn't a
lot of fun."
Freshman Nikhil Chanani,
who attended the "Youth in East
Palo Alto" trip, also quit because
he felt he had been misguided.
"We met Friday night and we
slept in a Row house, but I left,"
he said, adding that he returned
to his dorm room to sleep.
"I didn't sign up for this to
sleep on campus," he said.
On Saturday, Chanani's group
drove to East Palo Alto where
they spent the day working to ren
ovate an elementary school.
Chanani felt the First Year Trips
brochure had misrepresented the
program.
"I felt I was misled about what
we would be doing. [The
brochure] said we would see East
Palo Alto through a child's eyes,
and I met one child all day,"he
said. "It |also] bothered me that
we were doing it at a private
school rather than a public
school."
Lastly, Chanani said he was
confused about how his $75 fee
was used. "I don't know where my
money went," he said.
Wang said that volunteers on the
"Health Care" trip were asked to
sleep in Potter Lounge on campus,
but they, too, returned to their
dorm rooms.
Trip coordinators explained
that poor organization, not the
programs themselves, led to the
frustration.
REDWOOD program coordina
tor Kathryn Chen explained that
the public service trips were

impaired by a staff shake-up late in
the trips' planning — "so we basi
cally had to start from scratch."
Wang and Chanani said they
would not blame the situations on
their group leaders, who had little
time to prepare. The upperclass
leaders of "Youth in East Palo
Alto," sophomores Vanessa Alvara
do and Beatriz Esparza, "were great
people," according to Chanani. "I
don't blame them at all," he said.
Alvarado defended her trip
amid the student criticism. "We
did a lot of cleaning [at Shule
Mandela School], and we could
tell that when we left everything
was better-looking," she said.

"For the students especially, actu
ally seeing the kids made it much
more enjoyable."
She acknowledged that volun
teers didn't get to work with chil
dren from East Palo Alto as much
as they would have liked, adding
that the group performed the kind
of "grunt work" that is necessary
but not "all fun in the sun."
Chen agreed that the public
service trips need a degree of refin
ing, but said she was pleased with
the trips overall. "Our public-ser
vice trips have a lot to improve on.
[They] may involve a lot more
planning than some of the outdoor
trips do," she said. "Of course, this

is the first year we have done this.
Everything ran on schedule, [so it
hasl definitely been a success from
our perspectives."
Chanani — who said that other
students he talked to were also
upset — stressed that he did not
want to come off as completely
negative. "I do think that they
should continue to do the pro
gram," he said, citing poor plan
ning as the trip's biggest problem.
"If they had, for example, set
up a slumber party for some of
the kids from East Palo Alto"
with the Stanford volunteers, he
said, "it would have been a lot
more worthwhile."
