### Andrea Brunson 
In Washington, D. C., White House Senior
Policy Adviser George Stephanopoulos has
been called a great many things — but never
"The Georgemeister" as he is affectionately
known to Stanford Business School students
Polly Arenbergand Michael Melcher.
As co-founders of the George
Stephanopoulos Fan Club, Arenberg and
Melcher help an international audience keep
track of the comings and goings of their fa
vorite Clinton administration insider.
For a $10 fee, new members receive the
"Stephanopouletter," a quarterly publication
sent to card-carrying fan club members that
includes news about the latest Stephanopou
los sightings and interviews with those who
know him well.
And for the most devoted "L.O.G.s
Lovers of George," T-shirts will soon be avail
able, Arenberg said.
Stephanopoulos, known for his work on the
presidential campaigns of former Gov.
