# Keeping track of 'The Georgemeister'
## Biz school students start Stephanopoulos fan club 
### Andrea Brunson 
In Washington, D. C., White House Senior
Policy Adviser George Stephanopoulos has
been called a great many things — but never
"The Georgemeister" as he is affectionately
known to Stanford Business School students
Polly Arenbergand Michael Melcher.
As co-founders of the George
Stephanopoulos Fan Club, Arenberg and
Melcher help an international audience keep
track of the comings and goings of their fa
vorite Clinton administration insider.
For a $10 fee, new members receive the
"Stephanopouletter," a quarterly publication
sent to card-carrying fan club members that
includes news about the latest Stephanopou
los sightings and interviews with those who
know him well.
And for the most devoted "L.O.G.s
Lovers of George," T-shirts will soon be avail
able, Arenberg said.
Stephanopoulos, known for his work on the
presidential campaigns of former Gov.

Vincent Ho — Daily
Business School students Polly Arenberg and Michael Melcher show off the
"Stephanopouletter," which they created for their favorite White House policy adviser.

Michael Dukakis and President
Clinton, is currently "one of the
most important members of the
inner circle of Clinton's advisers,"
according to the newsletter.
Arenberg said she became inter
ested in Stephanopoulos after watch
ing countless hours of CNN during
the 1992 presidential campaign.
"There are many young, bril
liant and idealistic individuals
working in the government now —
George is merely the most promi
nent one," Arenberg and Melcher
said in the latest issue of the
newsletter.

And since they are close in age
and share an interest in govern
ment, Melcher, 30, said he feels a
generational connection to the 32-
year-old Stephanopoulos.
The fan club was born when the
two students decided to merge
their fondness for Stephanopoulos
with their business school training.
In April, they placed a $50
advertisement in Spy magazine,
looking for potential club mem
bers. Since subscriptions to the
fanzine were pouring in, they
advertised only once more in Spy's
August issue.
The couple "bootstrapped
[their] way through the [publica
tion 1 process" printing only as
many copies of the letter as were
requested, Arenberg said.

The newsletter is about five to
six pages long with a greeting page,
an editorial — this month's was
titled, "My dream date with
George"— a reader quiz and a pot
pourri of other Stephanopoulos
information and gossip.
"The fanzine has stringers
pounding pavements and corridors
in Washington, D.C. to collect spe
cial inside scoops," the newsletter
claims. "And Michael (Melcher)
strategizes ways to hobnob with
George S.'s inner circle when visit
ing friends in D.C.," it states.
The "Stephanopouletter"
eryoys its greatest following in the
Heartland, Melcher said. From this
"center of George love," member
ship radiates across the country
with strongholds in North Caroli

na, Florida, New Jersey and Cali
fornia, he added.
The fan club is also expanding
internationally with members in
Canada, Tokyo and Osaka.
Devotees number in "the three
digit range . . . somewhat more
than Pia Zadora and less than New
Kids on the Block," Melcher said.
Celebrity recipients of the
"Stephanopouletter" include
George's mother and sister Nikki
and Marguerite Stephanopoulos,
and top members of Clinton's staff,
Melcher said.
People Magazine discovered the
fan club and ran a brief article
about the "Stephanopouletter" in
their Aug. 16 issue. Melcher and
Arenberg have since been inter
viewed by the White House, CNN,

KABC Talk Radio, The Washing
ton Post and The New Republic.
Besides piquing media interest,
the club founders have received an
overwhelming response from their
membership, Arenberg said.
"People write zany, gushy let
ters that say things like, 'This is
the most important club in years.
We're so happy you started it,' "
Melcher said.
One freshman at Brandeis Uni
versity said she'd "been waiting
(her) entire life for this letter,"
Melcher said.
After reading about the
"Stephanopouletter" in People
Magazine, Stephanopoulos 1 : .mself
wrote Melcher and Arenberg a per
sonal note, wishing them the best
of luck.

"I only hope that the work we do
here earns your continued sup
port," his letter said.
By supporting Stephanopoulos
publicly, Melcher and Arenberg
hope they will encourage other sim
ilar grass roots movements and help
the Democratic Party, they said.
Melcher and Arenberg plan to
continue publishing the
"Stephanopouletter" while they
complete their education. "George
will be around a long time, and so
will we," Arenberg said.
Melcher said, "The fan club is a
Stanford venture at heart. It's
peppy, optimistic and entrepre
neurial — a California thing. We
couldn't have started this (letter] in
Washington, D.C., but crazy things
work in California."
