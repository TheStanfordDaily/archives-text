Haiti peace mission delayed
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -
Army-backed toughs, warning of another
Somalia, wrecked plans for American
troops to land as part of a U.N. peace mis
sion in Haiti yesterday and drove away
U.S. diplomats waiting to greet them.
The band of 25 to 50 men, some of
them armed, then beat up merchants in
the nearby market and fired guns while
roving through the capital, including
near the seaside U.S. Embassy. No casu
alties were reported.
U.S. and U.N. officials said the distur
bances would not halt the overall peace
mission. But it was yet another direct
challenge by the military to the U.N.
efforts to restore democracy to Haiti.
After the disturbances, the White
House delayed the deployment of the
nearly 200 American military medics,
engineers and civil affairs specialists
aboard the USS Harlan County, an
amphibious landing ship anchored 800
yards offshore. There was no word on
when the troops might dock.
The docking "will not take place until

we have a permissive environment. That
is, one that is safe for the men in the U.N.
mission," U.S. Army Maj. Jim Hinnant, a
mission spokesman, told The Associated
Press. Hinnant, a member of the U.S.
advance team flown in last week, said
negotiations were under way between
mission officials and the Haitian govern
ment.
Fly makes endangered list
LOS ANGELES (AP) - They're only
about an inch long and live a couple of
weeks at best, and you'd probably swat
one if you saw it.
Be careful. The Delhi Sands flower
loving fly is now on the federal endan
gered species list — the first fly ever to
achieve that distinction.
Shrinking habitat is the reason — and
those worried about commercial enter
prise in suburban Colton are left scratch
ing their heads.
"They talk about the fly becoming
extinct, but so are jobs," said Mayor
Frank Gonzales. "Next are they going to
be designating ants?"
