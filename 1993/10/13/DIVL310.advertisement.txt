Cummings Art Building, Room 2
Michael Brill will talk about his contract with the Department of
Energy to design an architectural sculpture to be placed on top of
the WIPP nuclear waste disposal site in New Mexico. The
sculpture is designed to be so repellent that people living 10,000
years from now who may not share any language currently in use
will instinctively be warned away from the site.
