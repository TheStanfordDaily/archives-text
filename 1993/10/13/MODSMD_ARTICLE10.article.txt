# Poisonous snake on the loose in Palo Alto
## 
### 
(AP) — A black mamba
snake, one of the most poi
sonous snakes in the world,
was on the loose in Palo Alto
last night, police said.
A man called police around 5
p.m. to ask if a snake had been
found, said officer Jean
Krhulec.
The man, who said he was
from Arizona and had an Ari
zona-issued permit to own the
black mamba, said the snake
had been missing since about
11 a.m., Krhulec said.
The snake's bite is "fatal
within minutes unless an anti
venom is administered," she
said.
Police were searching last
night for the snake and its
owner, who refused to give his
name or phone number.
The exact description of the
missing snake was unclear, but
African black mambas are
known to grow to more than 10

feet long and are usually black
or various shades of dark
brown. It also has a long strik
ing distance and it was unclear
what would provoke it to strike,
Krhulec said.
The species can move up to
seven miles an hour but it may
be moving slower because of
the climate, she said.
"The caller said it would
probably eat cats," Krhulec
said.
Police said the man didn't
give any details on how the
snake got loose. He said he
would post warning signs in the
area.
It was unclear where the
snake was last seen, but police
were searching the area of Ross
Road near Oregon Expressway.
The city requires a permit
for owning venomous snakes or
reptiles but the city has not
issued any such permits, she
said.
