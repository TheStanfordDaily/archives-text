Yeltsin apologizes to Japan
TOKYO (AP) — Russian President Boris
Yeltsin tried to improve relations with Japan by
apologizing yesterday for Soviet abuse of Japanese
prisoners from World War II and promising to set
tle a decades-old territorial dispute.
His three-day state visit may not produce mayor
breakthroughs, but he appears intent on improv
ing ties that have been chilly since the war ended
and Soviet troops seized four northern islands
from Japan.
Yeltsin said he hoped his visit would "open a
new page in the history of relations between Rus
sia and Japan."
Yeltsin's visit to Japan is only the second by a
Russian leader since the war. Former Soviet Pres
ident Mikhail Gorbachev visited in 1991.
Yeltsin promised to uphold all Soviet commit
ments to Japan, including a 1956 agreement to
return two of the disputed Kuril islands once a for
mal peace treaty is signed.
Surviving Japanese POWs had long awaited
Yeltsin's apology for their suffering, which the
Russian leader called " inhuman" and "a cruel
injustice." After the war, the Soviets detained
some 600,000 Japanese soldiers for years of forced
labor in Siberia.
