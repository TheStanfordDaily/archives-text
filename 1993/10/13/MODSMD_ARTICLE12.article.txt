## Clinton withdraws U.S. troops from Haiti President requests U.N. sanctions, voices support for Aristide 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton abruptly withdrew a shipload
of troops from Haitian waters yester
day but warned defiant leaders there
that he was "dead serious" about the
return of ousted President Jean-
Bertrand Aristide.
Clinton coupled his action with an
urgent request for the immediate reim
position of U.N. economic sanctions
against Haiti, targeted at military and
police leaders trying to block Aristide's
return under a U.N.-brokered accord.
"Now the time has come for the peo
ple who are clinging to their last gasp of
power to honor the agreement," Clin
ton said. "They made the agreement;
they've got to honor it.
"I want the Haitians to know that I
am dead serious about seeing them honor
the agreements they made," he said.
The fast-moving chain of events
came one day after the USS Harlan
County, an amphibious landing ship
carrying about 170 U.S. and 26 Canadi
an noncombat forces, was blocked from
docking in Port-au-Prince. The troops

were on a U.N. mission to help the
Haitians improve in military profes
sionalism, road-building, medical care
and other areas in anticipation of Aris
tide's return.
The ship was sent yesterday to the
U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo, Cuba.
A second U.S. ship set to arrive at Haiti
today, the USS Fairfax County, was
ordered not to leave its station at Little
Creek, Va.
Kathleen deLaski, the chief Pen
tagon spokeswoman, said that 25
Americans who arrived in Port-au-
Prince last week as an advance team
"will remain there for a short time" but
will leave Monday if no significant
progress is made in calming the situa
tion at the port, where the Harlan
County was unable to land.
Secretary of State Warren Christo
pher accused Haitian Army chief Raoul
Cedras and police commander Michel
Francois of reneging on commitments
last July for a return to democratic rule
from military dictatorship.
"By their actions, Gen. Cedras and

Police Chief Lt. Col. Michel Francois
are really inviting the reimposition of
severe economic sanctions, which
would affect their country and also
affect them personally," Christopher
said.
International sanctions against
Haiti were lifted after the July agree
ments were signed.
Aristide, after a meeting in Wash
ington with Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-
Mass., said he was confident that inter
national pressure would prompt the
military regime to step down on Friday,
as scheduled.
"Those killers stopped the process
yesterday and their removal is indis
pensable to the restoration of democra
cy," Aristide said.
Clinton said he thought the U.N.-
brokered agreement to restore democ
racy "will come back to life, but right
now it has been abrogated."
The president said there is "still a
chance" of returning Aristide to power.
Clinton drew a sharp distinction
between the mission of the 600 non

combat troops headed for Haiti and the
role of more than 4,700 forces in a casu
alty-marred peacekeeping assignment
in Somalia.
"This is not peacekeeping. This is
about restoration of democracy," he
said. "So we are going back to the sanc
tions until those people do what they
said they would do."
Clinton said the Defense Depart
ment felt that the U.S. troops' light
arms were sufficient to defend them
selves if the agreement were being hon
ored, but he added, "I am not about to
let them land to test it."
The president said that both Aris
tide and the international community
had done their part to develop a plan
for democracy but the Haitian military
and police were reneging.
"There's no point in our even trying
to land there until we can do what we
were asked to do as advisers," he said.
"They're going to have to honor this
agreement. Otherwise, I'm going to
press very hard to have the sanctions
reimposed," the president said.
