Big Game tickets should
be available for all those
students who wish to go

AT THIS year's Big Game,
there will likely be more
students in attendance
from UC-Berkeley than from
Stanford. Why? Because student
tickets to Big Game — all 4,000 of
them, as opposed to the 6,000
given to Cal — are no longer
available to Stanford graduates
and undergraduates.
This unfortunate situation has
been created by either indifference
or ignorance on the part of the
Athletics Department, and should
not be repeated. Instead, the Ath
letics Department should take
steps to allow a greater number of
Stanford students to attend future
Big Games.
If any students still wish to
attend this year's game, they have
two unpalatable options left. They
can purchase, for $32, one of the
1,000 or so remaining "limited
vision" seats in the first or second
row of the stadium which are
available to the general public.
But when these tickets are sold,
a ticketless Stanford student will
be forced to pay scalpers' prices to
attend the biggest athletic event of
the year. It may seem surprising
that all of the Big Game tickets are
sold out, given their high cost. The
reason is that the Athletics
Department allocated only 4,000
seats in Stanford Stadium for stu
dent purchase, out of an overall
stadium capacity of nearly 85,000.
According to the Stanford Tick
et Office, such a small fraction of
the stadium was allocated because
student ticket packages have not
sold out in recent years.
But the Athletics Department
should have expected an increased
ticket demand given Stanford's
top-20 finish last year and an
exciting home schedule that
includes Notre Dame and UC-

Berkeley.
To add insult to injury, the Stan
ford Athletics Department is treat
ing UC-Berkeley students who
wish to attend Big Game much
better than Stanford students. The
Athletics Department has released
6,000 tickets to Cal under contrac
tual obligation, all of which,
according to the Cal ticket office,
will be available for purchase by
students of that university.
The concept of Stanford stu
dents being outnumbered by their
Berkeley counterparts — at home,
no less — is fearsome indeed.
Attendance at Big Game is an
annual ritual for a large section of
the Stanford community. Many of
the students who go to Big Game
would never consider attending
another football game and there
fore should not be forced to buy
the entire home season package,
as is currently the case, to guaran
tee a seat at Big Game. The Stan
ford—Cal matchup is an impor
tant institution that for many
Stanford students generates some
of their fondest memories and
experiences.
It is probably too late for the
Athletics Department to enable
more students to attend this year's
Big Game. However, the simple
reform of increasing the ami u nt of
student Big Game tickets in the
future would constitute a win-win
situation, depriving nobody of an
opportunity to experience an
important Stanford tradition. In
the unlikely event that not all of
these seats were sold, Stanford
could do as Berkeley does and sell
the remaining seats at full admis
sion price to the general public.
Hopefully, the lack of student
seating is due to a misjudgment
and oversight on the part of the
Athletics Department, instead of a
desire to serve deep-pocketed
alumni at the expense of current
students.
It would not be foresighted,
emotionally or economically, for
Stanford to deny tomorrow's
alums the opportunity to be a part
of University's greatest galvaniz
ing experience.
