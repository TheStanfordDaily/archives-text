## Driving to the end of earth 
### 
NEW YORK City glitters in my
rearview mirror, its vastness
receding into the black, early
morning sky. It is still too early for dawn,
and I wonder at the strangeness of the
other cars whose headlights barrel
through the 3 a.m. mist, leading them
towards unknown destinations. When I
finally hit the interstate, it is mostly
Mack trucks, pulling the last leg of their
night hauls. At this hour, with nostalgia
for my long summer and New York home
already gathering around me, California
seems very far away.
I never imagined what a strange and
beautiful country is held and hidden
between these two coasts. As the miles
slip through me, I slide slowly through
worlds distant from my own, lives of open
planes and rainstorms and farming and
religion, of cattle and dust storms and
endless red earth. Though I have spent
much time in foreign countries, frequent
ing museums, villages, castles and cathe
drals, paying homage to other cultures,
my only visions of the United States
involved a combination of Thelma and
Louise-like movies and Ansel Adams pho
tographs. Thinking of it now, I can hard
ly remember what I imagined these
places to look like, my expectations now
erased and replaced with the brilliant
immensity of earth and sky and rock and
water that is this great country.
Now I can only remember it in frag
ments: In Wyoming I pulled onto the

shoulder of a winding mountain road, cut
the headlights, and stared up at the ink
black sky studded with a billion crystal
stars. It was like glimpsing into infinity
itself. The stars dotted the whole dome of
sky, falling like shattered glass through
the darkness and into the horizon itself.
In South Dakota a boy talked to me about
rain storms and the lightning that pulses
every second and thunder so mighty it
rattles the walls. In Utah I watched the
leaves protest the coming cold in fiery
reds and oranges. In Arizona I saw the
rock cut the sky and crack open the
earth. And always this feeling of endless
ness, of vastness, of the silence that sur
rounds something unspeakable.
There is much about this trip, howev
er, that saddened me. It seemed that
every natural beauty of the landscape
was littered by neon lights, Best West
erns, T-shirts, shiny brochures and
Kodak film. Whole towns, seemingly
built up in minutes out of some log-cabin
kit, were constructed around every con
ceivable rock formation or other slight
feat of nature. Flintstone camp sites,
wall-to wall carpeted caves, petable
prairie dogs and every other imaginable
tourist trap filled the artificial villages.
Perhaps the ultimate was the many rows
of benches set up in Yellowstone around
Old Faithful, occupied by hundreds of
camera-happy people waiting for the
thing to spew its tired breath out of the
ground. I was often reminded of the feel

ing I used to get when I visited the Cen
tral Park Zoo as a child — all of those
graceful creatures locked into contrived
habitats, pointed and gawked at by hun
dreds of sticky city kids each day. I
always imagined that they would look so
much more beautiful in the wild.
When I finally arrived in California, I
drove straight to the ocean. I felt a sort of
relief, a great lifting of a kind of claustro
phobia that I had been unaware of having
throughout my trip. I cannot explain
this, being that I drove through some of
the most desolate places that I have ever
been to. I only know that the sea calms
and comforts me, rocks me into thought
and nostalgia and wonder like no moun
tains or plains ever can. The oceans are
still untouched by humans, free of neon
and road signs, temperamental and per
manent, the most inconceivable thing on
this earth. Facing the horizon and watch
ing the great ball of sun ripening to a
golden red, I understood what someone
once told about why he loved traveling to
California: That standing here, facing the
infinite Pacific, is like having finally
reached the end of the earth itself.
