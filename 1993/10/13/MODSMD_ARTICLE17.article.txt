## Homerooms help personalize the university experience 
### 
CLARK KERR, president of the
University of California, once con
fessed: "The multiversity is a con
fusing place for the student. He has
problems of establishing his identity and
sense of security within it. . . the casual
ty rate is high. The walking wounded are
many." In recent years universities have
grown larger, more complex and more
impersonal.
A recent Carnegie Foundation survey
of university presidents ("Campus Life
in Search of Community," 1990) found
them deeply worried about the lack of an
integrated community on their campus
es. They were bothered by widespread
student alcoholism, sexual harassment,
racial tensions, bigotry and crime. At
least half believe "the quality of campus
life is of greater concern today than a
few years ago."
A university should be a community.
If it attracts large undergraduate popu
lations and takes their money, then it
has a positive responsibility to provide
them with some sense of membership â€¢
and belonging to a larger group.
Unfortunately, large universities have
many features that isolate and harass

students and separate them into compet
ing groups. Housing is chaotic, courses
are passive read-and-regurgitate experi
ences, and grading and financial pres
sures leave little time for socializing. But
the absence of community turns the uni
versity into a trade school. The university
may be a success as a factory turning out
highly skilled technocrats, but it is a fail
ure in teaching people empathy for others
or a sense of sharing and joy in life.
What the university needs are inte
grative mechanisms that will bring stu
dents together, foster friendships and
allow for common activities and sharing.
One such mechanism I am proposing
here is the idea of a permanent home
room. If all students are randomly
assigned to a permanent homeroom
class that meets three or four times a
week and keeps their membership intact
from term to term, the students would
at least develop a group of friends and
acquaintances who would remain con
stant over their college careers.
Moreover, these groups could func
tion as a substitute family, supplying the
student with a group of people who care
about him or her as a person. The nice

part about such a group is that unlike a
fraternity or sorority, or even a social
event, the homeroom class would be a
cross-section of the university. It would
expose the student to people they might
not ordinarily meet during their college
career.
Thus, a psychology major might
become acquainted with a science major,
a music major would meet an engineer
ing student, and a doctorate in English
might get to know a freshman jock on
the football team. And these might also
be people of different ethnic, religious,
social and racial origins. A homeroom
class could help friendships develop
among diverse individuals.
What would students do during their
homeroom class? They might have com
mon projects or maybe just bake tea and
cookies. I don't really know, but I sug
gest that they discuss their problems.
The homeroom class could be a counsel
ing group that gives its members a fresh
perspective and a helping hand with
their problems. There might even be a
monthly council of homeroom members
to discuss their common problems.
How do you get people to attend a

homeroom class? Here I think a little
coercion is necessary. The best way is
probably to assess a fee and then give a
rebate for each homeroom meeting
attended. But even voluntary homeroom
class meetings with coffee, tea and
doughnuts would go a long way to ending
campus anonymity and the sense that
one carries one's burdens and problems
alone.
Large campuses don't have to be lone
ly and impersonal if mechanisms are
established to fight loneliness and isola
tion. And the university should play a
leadership role in establishing such
mechanisms, Otherwise, all its psycholo
gists, economists, planners and scien
tists aren't really solving problems that
need to be solved. They are just teaching
abstract ideas, researching remote facts
and collecting paychecks.
If the university succeeds in integrat
ing students into a larger sense of com
munity and becomes a melting pot that
brings diverse people together, the uni
versity may also be healing some of the
problems of disintegration and alien
ation that afflict our larger society.
