## Scientists to drill 10-km hole to view firsthand how faults can generate large-scale earthquakes 
### Lisa Goldman Staff writer 
Attempting to construct a new theory of
fault physics, Stanford geophysicists have
joined an international research venture to
drill directly into the San Andreas fault.
Led by Geophysics Department chair
Mark Zoback, Stephen Hickman of the
U.S. Geological Survey and Leland
Younker of Lawrence Livermore National
Lab, a team of scientists from more than
eight countries are launching the 10-year
project in hopes of better understanding
fault mechanics. Researchers hope to begin
the study in 1996.
The project, which involves drilling a 10-
kilometer hole directly into the fault zone,
will accomplish several objectives.
- Its primary purpose is to discover why,
contrary to conventional laws of physics,
strong deformations occur in a fault zone
with a relatively weak frictional stress.
In the past, the "stick-slip" theory
served as the physical analogy for earth
quake occurrence along the fault. Under
this theory, when the two sides of a fault
are pressed tightly together, any slipping
will create stress that results in an earth
quake.
fault behavior can be likened to that of a
spring: when the two tectonic plates com
posing the San Andreas fault slide past
each other, frictional stress accumulates

until it must be released, causing deforma
tion.
However, because the high levels of
stress needed to generate an earthquake
have not been found along the San Andreas
fault, this theory does not explain why
deformation still occurs.
It is this quandary that has prompted
the massive undertaking to explore the
depths of the fault.
"Fundamentally, we don't understand
the physics of faulting," Zoback said.
The main alternative hypothesis the
project will pursue is that high water pres
sure in the fault zone is responsible for
earthquakes.
This pressure could facilitate tectonic
plate movement by pushing the plates
apart, causing deformation without high
levels of frictional stress â€” which would
explain the incongruous combination of
low stress levels and fault movement.
Should this explanation also prove
invalid, scientists will try to determine
which materials or processes in the fault
zone are causing it to deform under low
frictional stress.
"The new theory will be some combina
tion of how rocks behave and what role flu
ids play in a way we haven't understood
before," Younker predicted.
If successful, the project will produce
