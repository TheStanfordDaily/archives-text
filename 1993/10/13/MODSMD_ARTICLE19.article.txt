As physicians use steel
instruments to probe the interi
or of a patient, scientists are
now using optical tweezers,
focused beams of laser light, to
trap single molecules and probe
the atomic world.
Physics Department chair
Steve Chu and Medical School
Biochemistry Prof. James Spu
dich are using optical tweezers
in collaborative research on
DNA molecules and molecular
motors.
Building on the work of fel
low researchers at Bell labs, in
1986 Chu successfully used
focused laser beams to levitate a
single atom. Using light, scien
tists can now manipulate parti
cles from a distance, without
direct contact between objects.
The beams of light are called
optical tweezers, or laser traps,
because the laser rays suspend
and confine the particle so it
can be manipulated by the sci
entist.
The secured particle could be
an atom, a molecule or a neutral
object such as a micron-sized
glass bead.
Chu describes the basic idea
of optical tweezers with a lesson
in static electricity: "If you cre
ate a region in space where
there is a maximum electric

field, the particle will be polar
ized and be drawn into this
region of maximum field inten
sity." This must occur with
time-varying fields, not static
fields.
At the focal point of the laser
beam, where the light is most
intense, there are alternating
electric and magnetic fields.
These varying fields attract the
captive particle and hold it in
position.
Chu and Spudich are cur
rently applying the optical
tweezers to explore properties
of DNA molecules and the
molecular basis for muscle con
traction.
The process involves immers
ing the DNA molecules in flow
ing water. Micron-sized
polystyrene beads are attached
to the end of the DNA molecules
and provide a focal point for the
laser tweezers.
The tweezers are focused

through a microscope where
they grasp the tiny beads and
stretch the attached DNA.
Time-sequence photos then
chart the progress of the DNA
molecule as it relaxes after
water flow is turned off.
The experiment tests the the
ories of polymer physics: how
polymers, which are molecules
of repeating subunits, relax and
move through solutions and
bunches of other polymers.
"These theories ha*.en't been
tested that well," Chu
explained. "Now we're in a posi
tion where we can test them
directly."
Optical tweezers can also
stretch DNA in order to study
the motion of enzymes on DNA
molecules. DNA polymerase is
the enzyme that replicates
DNA, and RNA polymerase is
responsible for gene expression.
Of particular interest is the
'walking* motion of RNA poly

merase as it moves down the
DNA molecule. How the RNA
polymerase moves and folds
itself around the DNA is not yet
clear.
The researchers are also
studying molecular motors,
specifically the interaction
between the myosin and actin
proteins that are responsible for
muscle contraction.
The experiment involving
actin and myosin uses optical
tweezers to suspend and hold in
place a thin filament of actin
protein with polystyrene beads
on each end.
The myosin heads of protein
grasp and release the actin
thread, thereby moving down
the actin, much like a second
grader moves through monkey
bars.
The motion of the myosin
displaces the beads at the end of
the actin chain. The beads' dis
placement indicates a move
ment by the myosin molecular
motor.
The optical tweezers can also
prevent the beads from being
displaced as the myosin heads
grasp the actin thread. The
force exerted to keep the beads
stationary must be equal and
opposite to the force exerted by
the myosin.
To calculate the force exerted

by the myosin molecular motor,
Spudich measures the opposing
force exerted by the laser
tweezers to keep the bead sta
tionary.
According to Spudich, "the
importance and elegance of this
is the monomolecular mechani
cal measurements."
Optical tweezers allow scien
tists to manipulate the micro
scopic world of atoms and
molecules, and create new oppor
tunities for many fields of sci
ence.
"When you have a new tech
nique like [optical tweezers],"
Chu said, "you ask classical,
standard questions, but you
also hope to see if there's some
thing new here."
