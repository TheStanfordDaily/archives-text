## ASSU Senate approves members for undergrad education group 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night unani
mously approved the nominations of the
two student representatives to the
newly-formed Commission on Under
graduate Education.
But the issue was not resolved as qui
etly or as quickly as some senators would
have liked.
The ASSU Committee on Committees
selected junior Luz Herrera and David
Lowell, a Ph.D. candidate in the Engi
neering-Economic Systems Department,
as student members of the commission
Monday night.
The committee received 37 applica
tions for the undergraduate position and
seven for the graduate position, said
committee chairman Mork Murdock, an
undergraduate senator.
Despite overwhelming support for the
nominations, some senators remained
dissatisfied with Herrera's selection as
the undergraduate representative be
cause of her connections with the ASSU.
Herrera was an undergraduate senator
last year.
"It's got to be an incredible coinci
dence when, out of 37 applicants, the one
who rises to the top is a former ASSU
senator," said undergraduate senator

Peter Cousins.
In addition to being a former senator,
Herrera is currently a member of the
Council of Presidents' cabinet and holds
a position as undergraduate issues advis
er to the Student Advisory Group on Un
dergraduate Education â€” a project
sponsored by the COP.

Undergraduate senator Anthony
Westerfield, who is a member the Com
mittee on Committees said he believes
this involvement could impair Herrera's
ability to act effectively on the commis
sion.
