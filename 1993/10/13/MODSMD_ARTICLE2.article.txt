## ASSU Senate approves members for undergrad education group 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night unani
mously approved the nominations of the
two student representatives to the
newly-formed Commission on Under
graduate Education.
But the issue was not resolved as qui
etly or as quickly as some senators would
have liked.
The ASSU Committee on Committees
selected junior Luz Herrera and David
Lowell, a Ph.D. candidate in the Engi
neering-Economic Systems Department,
as student members of the commission
Monday night.
The committee received 37 applica
tions for the undergraduate position and
seven for the graduate position, said
committee chairman Mork Murdock, an
undergraduate senator.
Despite overwhelming support for the
nominations, some senators remained
dissatisfied with Herrera's selection as
the undergraduate representative be
cause of her connections with the ASSU.
Herrera was an undergraduate senator
last year.
"It's got to be an incredible coinci
dence when, out of 37 applicants, the one
who rises to the top is a former ASSU
senator," said undergraduate senator

Peter Cousins.
In addition to being a former senator,
Herrera is currently a member of the
Council of Presidents' cabinet and holds
a position as undergraduate issues advis
er to the Student Advisory Group on Un
dergraduate Education — a project
sponsored by the COP.

Undergraduate senator Anthony
Westerfield, who is a member the Com
mittee on Committees said he believes
this involvement could impair Herrera's
ability to act effectively on the commis
sion.
After being informed last
night of Herrera's ASSU posi
tions, he said, "I have a problem
if she does not resign from the
COP's advisory board.
"It would reflect badly on the
senate," he said. "She should
have no ties to any organizations.
. . . She should be impartial."
But Murdock was quick to
defend the committee's decision.
"We don't give anyone more con
sideration because of ASSU con
nections," he said.
However, he admitted that
Herrera "was the only one of the
seven applicants (interviewed by
the committee) who had ASSU
contact."
Despite the controversy over
her nomination, Herrera, a resi
dent assistant in Casa Zapata and
a member of the University Com
mittee for Undergraduate Stud
ies, said she plans to work to
improve undergraduate educa
tion.
"I want to express effectively
the needs of students," she said.
"Since there are a large number
of faculty members on the com
mission, student input is impor

tant.
"I hope that students take the
opportunity to get involved —
even just in dorm discussions
with members of the commis
sion," she added.
Herrera, a political science
mtyor, said she will wait until the
commission meets officially
before selecting specific issues to
focus on.
However, she noted that
"from my personal experience, I
think we should address class
size, quality of [teaching assis
tants! and availability of faculty
members."
Lowell said he too hopes to
improve undergraduate educa
tion. "My career goal is to be an
educator," he said. "This seemed
to be a task of the most funda
mental level — to ask 'what are
we trying to do?' "
Lowell, who attended Stanford
as an undergraduate, has been a
teaching assistant and an under
graduate academic adviser.
In addition to approving the
commission appointments, the
senate finally elected graduate
senator David Golob as this
year's deputy chair.
The election had been post
poned from last spring's final
senate meeting because no sena
tors applied for the position.
