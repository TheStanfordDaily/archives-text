# Nocturnal emissions
## Nolan Ryan and wet dreams OK, says Bug 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
Q: I had always thought I
was heterosexual. But
recently, I had a nocturnal
emission while dreaming about
Nolan Ryan pitching a no-hit
ter. What could cause this? Is
this a one-shot deal, or is it a
reflection of my subconscious
desires?
— Swarthy
A: "One-shot deal."
Hmmm. No, I think I'll
leave that one alone.
Although this may come as a

surprise to you,
Swarthy, I am not
a licensed psychol
ogist or sex thera
pist. Consequent
ly, I am not quali
fied to analyze the
significance of
your experience.
What I can do,
however, is talk a

little bit about the phenomenon
of nocturnal emission.
Nocturnal emissions, per
haps better known as wet
dreams, are orgasms which
occur during sleep.
Both men and women have
wet dreams, although their
experiences of the event are
somewhat different. Men have
wet dreams about twice as often
as women, and — except in
pathological cases — a woman's
wet dreams are not accompa
nied by seminal ejaculation.
In men, wet dreaming begins
a year or so after the onset of
puberty, when the prostate
gland has matured sufficiently
to begin producing seminal
fluid. Nocturnal emission is
responsible for the first orgasm
(a long and fondly remembered
event) in one in eight men — a
distant second to the five
knuckle shuffle, which accounts
for two in three first orgasms,
but well ahead of homosexual
play, which accounts for one in
20.
Studies of paralyzed men
(whose cognitive centers can't
communicate with the neural
machinery responsible for ejac
ulation) show that some noctur
nal emissions occur without
any dreaming at all; in these
cases, the term "wet dream" is
something of a misnomer.
These orgasms can usually be
explained mechanically: friction
against bedsheets or pillows is a
culprit often cited in the schol
arly literature.
Usually, however, nocturnal
orgasms are accompanied by

erotic dreams.
People often have difficulty
remembering the dreams that
accompany nocturnal orgasm.
One subject in a study of the
phenomenon rationalized his
forgetfulness as follows: "I was
too busy enjoying the result." I
can buy that.
Some generalizations can be
made, however. The dreams are
usually brief relivings of recent
sexual contacts, rather than
anticipations of sex acts with as
yet-untried partners.
More often than not, they
are successions of discrete
images, rather than coherent

scenarios
(replete, one
would imagine,
with cheesy
soundtracks,
frighteningly
well-endowed
men, and over
painted vixens
clad solely in
makeup and

high heels).
Regardless of the sexual ori
entation of the dreamer, these
nocturnal erotica can be hetero
sexual, homosexual or other
(e.g., "sheeposexual"). The man
ifest content of the dream may
not even be explicitly sexual, but
there is always a subjective sen
sation of sexual excitement.
In those cases where the
symbolic cause of this excite
ment runs counter to the
dreamer's stated preferences
(i.e., a straight man dreaming
about another man) or is entire
ly obscure (i.e., a straight man
dreaming about Nolan Ryan),
the pleasure of the orgasm may
be tinged with apprehension or
remorse.
But for such guilty wet
dreamers, there is good news:
the contents of erotic dream
sare not so much indicative of
sexual preference as they are a
fairly meaningless by-blow of
the brain's efforts to sort out
the millions of data it collects
and processes in any given day.
But then again .. . you never
know: Fast balls. Curve balls.
Screw balls. Pop flies. Hard
drives up the middle. And all of
these feats performed by men in
tight pants who are constantly
scratching their genitals.
Maybe this is something you
need to talk about.

(whose cognitive centers can't
communicate with the neural
machinery responsible for ejac
ulation) show that some noctur
nal emissions occur without
any dreaming at all; in these
cases, the term "wet dream" is
something of a misnomer.
These orgasms can usually be
explained mechanically: friction
against bedsheets or pillows is a
culprit often cited in the schol
arly literature.
Usually, however, nocturnal
orgasms are accompanied by

erotic dreams.
People often have difficulty
remembering the dreams that
accompany nocturnal orgasm.
One subject in a study of the
phenomenon rationalized his
forgetfulness as follows: "I was
too busy enjoying the result." I
can buy that.
Some generalizations can be
made, however. The dreams are
usually brief relivings of recent
sexual contacts, rather than
anticipations of sex acts with as
yet-untried partners.
More often than not, they
are successions of discrete
images, rather than coherent

scenarios
(replete, one
would imagine,
with cheesy
soundtracks,
frighteningly
well-endowed
men, and over
painted vixens
clad solely in
makeup and

high heels).
Regardless of the sexual ori
entation of the dreamer, these
nocturnal erotica can be hetero
sexual, homosexual or other
(e.g., "sheeposexual"). The man
ifest content of the dream may
not even be explicitly sexual, but
there is always a subjective sen
sation of sexual excitement.
In those cases where the
symbolic cause of this excite
ment runs counter to the
dreamer's stated preferences
(i.e., a straight man dreaming
about another man) or is entire
ly obscure (i.e., a straight man
dreaming about Nolan Ryan),
the pleasure of the orgasm may
be tinged with apprehension or
remorse.
But for such guilty wet
dreamers, there is good news:
the contents of erotic dream
sare not so much indicative of
sexual preference as they are a
fairly meaningless by-blow of
the brain's efforts to sort out
the millions of data it collects
and processes in any given day.
But then again .. . you never
know: Fast balls. Curve balls.
Screw balls. Pop flies. Hard
drives up the middle. And all of
these feats performed by men in
tight pants who are constantly
scratching their genitals.
Maybe this is something you
need to talk about.
