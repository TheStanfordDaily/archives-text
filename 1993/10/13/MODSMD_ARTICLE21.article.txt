## Higher and hire: Ted Leland Third-year AD adds new faces, keeps titles piling up 
### M. Scott Walker Staff writer 
Dr. Ted Leland is a football coach in
an athletic director's job. So it is no
surprise that his hard-hitting style and
emphasis on discipline have rocketed
Stanford athletics to unparalleled
heights.
It was a homecoming of sorts on
June 7, 1991, when Leland was named
the fifth director of athletics in Stan
ford history. Leland was an assistant
football coach for Stanford in 1978 and
1979. He also earned his doctorate in
sports psychology from Stanford's Edu
cation Department in 1982.
Keep the June 7, 1991 date in mind,
because since then Cardinal teams have
won nine NCAA titles. No other univer
sity in the nation has claimed as many
championships in the same time span.
Most Stanford coaches give Leland's
management style credit for this
impressive feat.
"I think that he lays the foundation
and lets things happen. That's part of
his leadership qualities — his ability to
take some chances which others might
not ever consider," said the Cardinal's
head cross-country coach Vin Lananna.
Lananna also worked with Leland at
Dartmouth, where both held identical
posts to their roles at Stanford.
Leland, however, declines credit for
the abundance of championship hard
ware on display at The Farm. He main
tains that the machinery was up and
running well before his arrival.
"I really feel the cogs have been in
place. I think if you say to yourself,
'Oh, you win with coaching or you win
with athletes,' which is probably true,
then certainly the building blocks of
this were here long before I came,"
Leland said. "I think what I've tried to
do is build on the solid foundation that
was in place before I came, and honest
ly has been in place for years and years
at Stanford."
If it ain't broke, don't fix it. It is that

laissez-faire approach which another
recent Leland hire suggests is his boss'
best attribute.
"I think he takes the approach as an
athletic director that he is here to ser
vice and monitor what is happening
among his coaches, rather than direct
them or take credit for or try to manip
ulate or dabble in their sports," said
head football coach Bill Walsh. "He's
there to help and assist in any way he
can. I think that's the critical quality
you need to be an administrator."
Ah, yes — Bill Walsh. The hiring of
coach Walsh to head the burgeoning
football program was a feat in itself.
The landing of both Walsh and Lanan
na showed a commitment to employ
top-flight personnel to lead Stanford
squads.
"He, in my opinion, is the best ath
letic director in the nation. It's not like
ly that I would have considered return
ing had he not been on the scene," com
mented Walsh, who last year led Stan
ford to its best gridiron record since
1940.
Not to say that Leland's tenure has
only been composed of days of wine and
roses. There are still many complex
issues which have claimed his atten
tion. Among them are adding more
facilities for athletics and rebuilding
some struggling athletic programs.
The Arrillaga Family Sports Com
plex, a new training and meeting facili
ty which should be completed this
school year, partially addresses the
need for additional facilities.
Rebuilding long-suffering athletic
programs may be the more difficult of
Leland's two primary chores. "[Building
a program] requires funding, it requires
a vision and I think it requires confi
dence from an athletic director," said
Lananna, who is in the process of such
an undertaking. "There are going to be
some rough times before there are good
times whenever you are taking a pro
gram and trying to expand not only the
quantity, but the quality of a program."

Leland's msyor mandate, however, is
clear: Keep the budget balanced. Bud
getary concerns, in fact, have caused
the biggest commotion during his
tenure. The senior administration of
the department was streamlined in
early 1992, including the removal of
former Senior Associate Athletic Direc
tor Alan Cummings, who had previous
ly held the longest term-of-service in
the department. The decision to cut the
department staff was not an easy one.
"Something that I noticed when I
got here, I thought we had a very exten
sive senior administrative staff,"
Leland said. "Those are strictly budget
issues. The people in those jobs were
wonderful, and they've moved on to
other careers, most of them at Stan
ford. We've had to streamline adminis
tratively, but I see that as no different
as any other institution in the country.
Clearly if the choice comes down to
retaining a program or cutting back
administratively, you want to cut back
on administration if you can."
Leland is an athletic director that
almost wasn't. After graduating from
the University of Pacific in 1970, where
he was an all-conference defensive line
man, he began a career as a football
coach. He became Pacific's defensive
coordinator in 1976, after which he
coached on Walsh's staff in 1978. In
1979, an opportunity to get into athlet
ic administration materialized, and he
accepted a job as an assistant athletic
director at the University of Houston,
beginning a journey which has culmi
nated in Palo Alto.
"About 70 or 80 percent of the peo
ple in professional jobs change careers
at some point in time. My career start
ed off as a football coach. That's all I'd
wanted to be since I was a sophomore
in high school," Leland said. "Then I
decided that football coaching probably
wasn't the career I wanted, and I want
ed to get more involved in the core of
education."
Walsh considers it Stanford's gain.

"He takes talents into administration,
and he works very well with people;
he's very sensitive to other people, he's
creative, he can work smoothly under a

lot of pressure with other people, he's
well organized, and so he has all those
things going for him in administra
tion."

heights.
It was a homecoming of sorts on
June 7, 1991, when Leland was named
the fifth director of athletics in Stan
ford history. Leland was an assistant
football coach for Stanford in 1978 and
1979. He also earned his doctorate in
sports psychology from Stanford's Edu
cation Department in 1982.
Keep the June 7, 1991 date in mind,
because since then Cardinal teams have
won nine NCAA titles. No other univer
sity in the nation has claimed as many
championships in the same time span.
Most Stanford coaches give Leland's
management style credit for this
impressive feat.
"I think that he lays the foundation
and lets things happen. That's part of
his leadership qualities — his ability to
take some chances which others might
not ever consider," said the Cardinal's
head cross-country coach Vin Lananna.
Lananna also worked with Leland at
Dartmouth, where both held identical
posts to their roles at Stanford.
Leland, however, declines credit for
the abundance of championship hard
ware on display at The Farm. He main
tains that the machinery was up and
running well before his arrival.
"I really feel the cogs have been in
place. I think if you say to yourself,
'Oh, you win with coaching or you win
with athletes,' which is probably true,
then certainly the building blocks of
this were here long before I came,"
Leland said. "I think what I've tried to
do is build on the solid foundation that
was in place before I came, and honest
ly has been in place for years and years
at Stanford."
If it ain't broke, don't fix it. It is that

laissez-faire approach which another
recent Leland hire suggests is his boss'
best attribute.
"I think he takes the approach as an
athletic director that he is here to ser
vice and monitor what is happening
among his coaches, rather than direct
them or take credit for or try to manip
ulate or dabble in their sports," said
head football coach Bill Walsh. "He's
there to help and assist in any way he
can. I think that's the critical quality
you need to be an administrator."
Ah, yes — Bill Walsh. The hiring of
coach Walsh to head the burgeoning
football program was a feat in itself.
The landing of both Walsh and Lanan
na showed a commitment to employ
top-flight personnel to lead Stanford
squads.
"He, in my opinion, is the best ath
letic director in the nation. It's not like
ly that I would have considered return
ing had he not been on the scene," com
mented Walsh, who last year led Stan
ford to its best gridiron record since
1940.
Not to say that Leland's tenure has
only been composed of days of wine and
roses. There are still many complex
issues which have claimed his atten
tion. Among them are adding more
facilities for athletics and rebuilding
some struggling athletic programs.
The Arrillaga Family Sports Com
plex, a new training and meeting facili
ty which should be completed this
school year, partially addresses the
need for additional facilities.
Rebuilding long-suffering athletic
programs may be the more difficult of
Leland's two primary chores. "[Building
a program] requires funding, it requires
a vision and I think it requires confi
dence from an athletic director," said
Lananna, who is in the process of such
an undertaking. "There are going to be
some rough times before there are good
times whenever you are taking a pro
gram and trying to expand not only the
quantity, but the quality of a program."

Leland's msyor mandate, however, is
clear: Keep the budget balanced. Bud
getary concerns, in fact, have caused
the biggest commotion during his
tenure. The senior administration of
the department was streamlined in
early 1992, including the removal of
former Senior Associate Athletic Direc
tor Alan Cummings, who had previous
ly held the longest term-of-service in
the department. The decision to cut the
department staff was not an easy one.
"Something that I noticed when I
got here, I thought we had a very exten
sive senior administrative staff,"
Leland said. "Those are strictly budget
issues. The people in those jobs were
wonderful, and they've moved on to
other careers, most of them at Stan
ford. We've had to streamline adminis
tratively, but I see that as no different
as any other institution in the country.
Clearly if the choice comes down to
retaining a program or cutting back
administratively, you want to cut back
on administration if you can."
Leland is an athletic director that
almost wasn't. After graduating from
the University of Pacific in 1970, where
he was an all-conference defensive line
man, he began a career as a football
coach. He became Pacific's defensive
coordinator in 1976, after which he
coached on Walsh's staff in 1978. In
1979, an opportunity to get into athlet
ic administration materialized, and he
accepted a job as an assistant athletic
director at the University of Houston,
beginning a journey which has culmi
nated in Palo Alto.
"About 70 or 80 percent of the peo
ple in professional jobs change careers
at some point in time. My career start
ed off as a football coach. That's all I'd
wanted to be since I was a sophomore
in high school," Leland said. "Then I
decided that football coaching probably
wasn't the career I wanted, and I want
ed to get more involved in the core of
education."
Walsh considers it Stanford's gain.

"He takes talents into administration,
and he works very well with people;
he's very sensitive to other people, he's
creative, he can work smoothly under a

lot of pressure with other people, he's
well organized, and so he has all those
things going for him in administra
tion."
