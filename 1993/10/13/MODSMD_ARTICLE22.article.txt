# Synchronized swimming makes its varsity debut
## 
### Kyle Graham Editorial staff 
This year Stanford has added a 31st varsi
ty sport to their athletic program, joining it to
the ranks of such Farm pastimes as basket
ball, football and baseball.
And while synchronized swimming may
not be as well-known as any of the aforemen
tioned sports, this relative anonymity is not
due to a lack of success by the Stanford squad
in years past.
In fact, the women's synchro team, operat
ing as a club sport, has finished second in the
nation for seven consecutive years. Only the
presence of national powerhouse Ohio State
has prevented the Cardinal from amassing an
incredible string of national titles.
Because of the sport's lack of recognition,

few are familiar with the format used for syn
chro competitions. Swimmers are recquired to
have both technical "figures" routines and
creative performances, earning composite
scores based on their technical merit and
artistic impression. During the creative por
tion of contests, team members may compete
together in duets, trios or team performances
with as many as eight members swimming at
once.
In these matches, judges examine the
swimmers' leap heights, the degree of effort
lessness in their routines and other factors in
giving the competitors scores fluctuating from
zero to 10.
Cardinal coaches are optimistic regarding
the season's prospects, but still see Ohio State
as a difficult hurdle. "It'll be a challenging
year," said assistant head coach and former

Cardinal water polo goalie Andy Maisel. "Ohio
State had a terrific recruiting year, and even
though we also had a great year, we'll be
swimming in their home pool [in the champi
onshipsl." The home-pool advantage is of
importance in synchro because of the judges'
tendency to favor the home team, despite
their intended impartiality.
Leading the Cardinal this season (which
begins in mid-December) will be longtime
head coach Vickey Weir, who has driven the
synchro team to 13 top-five finishes in her 15
years as coach of the club team. Furthermore,
Weir has coached 14 individual national
champions and 39 collegiate Ail-Americans
during her tenure.
"We're pleased to officially welcome Vickey
to our staff of coaches," said Athletics Director
Ted Leland. "Of course, we are already famil

iar with her abilities, her level of dedication,
and her 15 years of commitment to the Stan
ford athlete."
Co-captains Julie Davies and Georgia
Bauman will guide the 11-member Cardinal
squad, a group that is far larger than any
previous Stanford assemblage. Seven of the
swimmers return from last year's squad,
and, all told, three of this year's competitors
particpated in this summer's U.S. Olympic
Festival, at which Weir coached the West
squad.
"This is the first year we've had a large
enough team to do an eight-person event,"
said Maisel. "You get a half-point bonus for
each added swimmer after four who partic
pate in the team routine. Ohio State has
always been able to field an eight-person team,
but this year we will, too."
