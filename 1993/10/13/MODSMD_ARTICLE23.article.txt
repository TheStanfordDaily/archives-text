# Running into a brick wall
## Cardinal prepares for stifling Wildcat defense 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
After a bye week, the lights
are ready to go up once again on
the Stanford football season.
But in order for Saturday's per
formance to be a showstopper,
the Cardinal (2-3, 0-2 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) will have
to open the "Cactus Curtain,"
better known as the Arizona

defense.
Getting the production roll
ing in Tucson will not be an easy
task. The Wildcats (5-0, 2-0)
boast the top-ranked defense in
the nation, gwmg up an average
of only 158 total yards per game.
"This is as tough a challenge
as Stanford will have this year
facing a defensive team," said
head coach Bill Walsh. "We've
spent every waking minute try

ing to come up with a formula
that will give us the best chance
to move the ball."
The Wildcats would like noth
ing more than for that formula
to include the run. In their first
five games, the Arizona run
defense, also ranked first in the
NCAA, has allowed 30 rushing
yards — total. Broken down by
attempts, that figure amounts
to a measly two-tenths of an

inch allowed per carry.
"We're number 11 in the Pac
-10 in rushing — I think the
league office is ahead of us,"
Walsh quipped. "But the point is
we have running plays. We're
not impotent in all areas, and we
will attack them."
A physical group of defenders
will be testing the Cardinal run
ning game. All-American nose
guard Rob Waldrop, a semifinal
ist for the Lombardi Award,
leads the way for the Wildcats.
Nearly half of his tackles have
been for losses. Sophomore
defensive end Tedy Brushi,
meanwhile, leads the Pac-10 in
quarterback sacks.
"They just come out and
attack you and try to get you
out of your game," said Stan
ford offensive lineman Mike
Jerich. "We have to be prepared
to play our best game to stop
them."
The Cardinal offensive line,
though, was dealt a blow this
week with the news that senior
center Glen Cavanaugh — who
has started every game at his
position since the start of the
1991 season — has an injured
disk in his neck and will be side
lined indefinitely. Junior T.J.
Gaynor will replace Cavanaugh
in the lineup.
The Wildcat defense is not as
formidable against the pass.
This worries Arizona head coach
Dick Tomey, who is well aware
of Stanford's aerial game.
"We haven't faced anybody of
the kind of caliber we're facing
this week," Tomey said. "Sten
strom is a great quarterback.
Stanford presents an awful lot
of problems for us."
Tomey also recognizes that
the records for his team and the

Cardinal can be misleading.
While four of Stanford's first
five opponents are currently
ranked in the top-25, none of the
teams the Wildcats have faced so
far are nationally rated.
"They've played a difficult
schedule, much more difficult
than we have," Tomey said.
"Coming off a bye week, both
teams will be rejuvenated. This
could be one heck of a football
game."
The main difference between
this year's Arizona squad and
that of a year ago is an offensive
game to complement the
defense. Wildcat quarterback
Dan White, a sophomore trans
fer, has already thrown for
seven touchdowns, the most by
an Arizona quarterback since
1986.
"He makes a dramatic differ
ence over -a year ago because
he's a passer," Walsh said. "Last
year, they didn't go with the
pass, and a good part of their
losses last year was because of
their inability to score. Now
they have someone who can
throw the ball effectively, and
this gives them a new dimen
sion."
While Arizona is currently
the favorite to represent the
Pac-10 in the Rose Bowl, Walsh
realizes that a win Saturday
night could be the turning point
in Stanford'B season.
"We'll need to make some
first downs rushing, we're going
to have to catch the ball when
it's thrown to us and not have it
jarred loose, and we'll need two
or three gains during the
game of 20 or 30 yards," Walsh
said. "We just have to be patient
and not get frustrated."


Joshua Folk - Dally (He
Freshman Mike Mitchell picks up a few more of his team-leading 578 all-purpose yards. Increasing that
total this Saturday will be quite a challenge against an Arizona defense that Is ranked No. 11n the nation.
