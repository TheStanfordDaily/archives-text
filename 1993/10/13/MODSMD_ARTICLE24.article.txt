Announcer Needed:
The Stanford Athletic
Department is looking for an
announcer for their basketball
teams. The department began
its search last week and
encourages anyone with inter
est to submit an audition tape
to the department by Nov. 1.
Sports Information director
Bob Vazquez said that about
50 people had already called
expressing interest in the job.
When asked about the type
of person he was looking for as
an announcer, Vazquez said
that though previous experi
ence is helpful, the search is
open to everybody. He also
said that he wants an "upbeat
announcer, who gets the
crowd involved ... but is not
obnoxious."
A panel of judges will listen
to the audition tapes submit
ted and select the top six can
didates. These candidates will
then have two opportunities
to do live auditions at exhibi
tion games on Nov. 17 and
Nov. 22. The decision will be
based on these live auditions.
