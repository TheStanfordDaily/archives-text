# Anthro CIV studies original texts, artifacts
## 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
For one group of freshmen this year, Cul
tures, Ideas and Values is incorporating the
study of not only ancient texts, but also ancient
artifacts such as arrowheads.
The new CIV track, "Origins, Encounters
and Identities," offered through the Anthropol
ogy Department, explores questions regarding
the origin of cultures, how culture, language
and civilizations have emerged and how people
formulated their identities.
One unique aspect of the course is that it
assigns students about half the reading
assigned in other tracks. On average, students
are assigned about 128 pages per week — the
coordinators of the track hoped students would
read everything if they weren't overwhelmed
with material.
Anthropology Department Chair George
Collier and Prof. James Fox developed the track
to explore different media of information and to
spend more time on each work. By using this
concept, Fox said the course has more time to

study other interesting materials, including
corn plants, arrowheads and documents from
other cultures.
"Our emphasis is on reading more of each
book. We feel like sometimes there has been a
history of reading too little about a given book
and thinking you know a lot about that book,"
said Fox, who chairs the track.
To enforce the reading, anthropology CIV
students are required to turn in reading notes
— a summary and reaction to what they read.
The Anthropology Department first applied
for funding for their CIV idea from the office of
the dean of Humanities and Sciences two years
ago, but their request was turned down. Still
eager to implement their ideas, the department
used the Anthropology 1 course as a way to test
their ideas for the CIV track. This past winter,
the department's idea was approved.
The track has had "plenty" of student inter
est — even upperclassmen have attempted to
take it, said Fox. The upperclassmen were not
allowed to take the course because the track is
limiting enrollment in its first year to only 72
students.

The track began with a small number of stu
dents because the department is uncertain of
how students will respond to the material —
the department is not accustomed to students
taking their courses as part of a requirement,
and many freshmen don't take anthropology
classes, Fox said.
Although the reading notes may seem like a
drawback for some students, freshman Blanca
Torres said the notes aren't that bad because
there isn't a midterm.
Freshman Robin Goldenberg said the work
seems pretty reasonable so far. "It doesn't seem
like they expect too much from us ... . But it is
challenging."
Goldenberg listed this CIV track as her top
choice because it sounded "cool" to take. But
she added that people who didn't choose this as
their first choice say they are still enjoying the
course.
Goldenberg said she likes the lecturers,
adding, "Apparently, they really thought this
one through — they made it better and more
enjoyable so [the students) actually could get
some stuff out of it."
