# Grad students e-mail fee-refund pleas
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Stanford's electronic mail network
has become the newest ally of the
Graduate Student Tea Party — a
group of graduate students working to
inform others about the ASSU fee-re
fund process.
According to Karen Seta, one of the
group's coordinators, a message en
couraging graduate students to apply
for fee refunds has been sent to at least
4,500 graduate students.
"A lot of people not only have
thanked us, but feel this is a good way
for grad students to make a state
ment," said Seta, who has been plan

ning the campaign since last spring.
"Hopefully this will have an effect."
Students may request refunds of
their $37.22 in ASSU fees — which go
directly to various student groups —
over the university's computer system.
Graduate senator Neil Crellin ex
pressed some concern over the issue,
but reserved stronger comment until
the full impact of the fee-request cam
paign can be assessed.
"I don't want to see complete gradu
ate separatism, but I do see some bene
fit from decoupling grad and under
grad funding mechanisms," he said. "I
think it'll be interesting the im-
pact of the e-mailing program."
Seta's fellow coordinator
Michael Grant, who programmed
his computer to send the mes
sages, said that he has already
received about 150 responses.
"Ninety-five percent of the e
mail that I received was positive,"
said Grant. "A lot of the students
say they're getting their
refunds."
The message, which pro
claims, "Make a statement! Save
$120! Slam the ASSU!" is part of
a political statement that the
group is making about graduate
Ostudent input in the ASSU.
"We feel that views of the grad

students are often ignored by the
student government," Seta said.
In addition to their e-mail
campaign, the group set up com
puter workstations at several
graduate student orientation par
ties over the weekend to encour
age students to request refunds.
"There were a few people who
disagreed with our viewpoint, but
overwhelmingly we got a positive
reaction," Seta said.
The computerized effort is the
group's last attempt to dissemi
nate information before next
Wednesday's deadline to file a
fee-refund request.
"It's surprising how many
people didn't know about the
refund process," Grant said. "I
think the size of the increase in
fee refunds will be significant."
