# Economists battle over school voucher system
## 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Two Stanford education and
economics experts — one who was
a mentor to the other — debated
California's proposed school
voucher system in Annenberg Au
ditorium last night.
Though he said that "there is
no one solution" to the problems
that face California public schools,
Hoover Senior Research Fellow
Milton Friedman said that Propo
sition 174 — which is on Novem
ber's ballot — would bring "mtyor
improvements" to California edu
cation.
Education Prof. Martin Carnoy
— who studied under Friedman
for his doctorate at the University
of Chicago — responded that the
main effect of the initiative would
be to "subsidize religious educa
tion" and undermine the public

school system.
The initiative would amend
California's constitution to give
every elementary and secondary
school student a $2,600 voucher
redeemable at any school that
meets a few minimal require
ments, including private and
church-affiliated institutions.
"Why is it that the public
schools are performing so badly?"
Friedman asked the crowd of 200
people. "For a very simple reason
— monopoly."
"The current education system
is a mess, a failure," Friedman
continued, adding that today's
students will not be as well
schooled as their parents for the
first time in history.
Carnoy responded by pointing
to successes within the public
school system, such as a project in

Baltimore which brought in a
management company to run
nine schools. The facilities
improved markedly, he said,
adding that reforming schools
"doesn't require privatization."
"I am for choice, and I'm for
better education," Carnoy said.
"We do have a challenge [before
us], but I think there are better
alternatives."
Friedman argued that a free
market system is the only path to
success. "How can [the United
States' higher education system]
be number one and its elemen
tary and secondary schools be
number 4,376?" he asked. "The
answer is choice."
Carnoy said that families
should be able to move their

children between schools in dif
ferent communities, but added
that folding private schools into
the system would be a mistake.
"These public schools would
be . . . totally unregulated," he
said.
"Our schools are failing for the
same reason that the Soviet
Union failed. Because socialism is
a terrible [way] to run an enter
prise," Friedman said.
Carnoy countered that public
schools "inherently deliver a
democratic message that private
schools do not."
"I disagree 100 percent,"
Friedman shot back. "I think the
competitive enterprise system is
an extremely egalitarian and
democratic system."
Though polls have shown that
the voucher concept is popular,
Friedman said that the "vested
educational establishments" —
especially the teachers' unions —

have fought every attempt to
introduce them.
Carnoy said he wanted to cut
red tape, but added that private
schools are burdened by bureau
cracy as well.
Friedman discounted claims
that the private school system
could not absorb the expected
exodus of students by pointing
out that the G.I. Bill for veterans
of World War II caused colleges to
double their capacity in three
years.
"A whole new market would
open up" once parents are
"empowered," Friedman said.
According to one estimate, 17
percent — or 864,000 — of public
school students would have to
switch to private schools for the
state to break even.
Such a shift "represents a
huge and unlikely increase in
[attendance at] California private
schools," Carnoy said.
