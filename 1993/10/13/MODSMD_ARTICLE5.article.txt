# Settlement for $25M formally submitted
## Judge to rule on agreement in December, ending dispute between Stanford, church 
### Joe Bialowitz 
A settlement proposal with the Christ
ian Science Church that could give Stan
ford nearly $25 million was formally filed
yesterday in Los Angeles County Superior
Court.
Judge Arnold H. Gold is expected to rule
on the proposal on Dec. 14.
If the court approves the settlement, it
would signal the resolution of a nearly two
year-long legal fight between the Universi
ty, the Los Angeles County Museum and
the church over the more than $100 mil
lion joint estates of sisters Eloise Mabury
Knapp and Bella Mabury. The proposed
settlement was the result of lengthy nego
tiations involving all four parties.
Under the terms of the agreement, the
church would receive 53 percent of the be
quest, which is now being held in a trust,
according to a copy of the petitions to con
firm the settlement agreement. Stanford
and Museum Associates, a support group
for the museum, will each receive 23.5 per
cent of the trusts' assets.
Senior University Counsel Carol Swen
son said she was "pleased to have reached
an agreement," and added that she hoped
the judge would approve it. However, she
declined to comment on the likelihood of
the settlement's approval.
"I think it's a fair settlement," said
Brian Talkott, the church's Northern Cal
ifornia representative.
Chip Rawlings, the chief counsel for
Museum Associates, said he hoped that the
money will escape "the black hole" it is cur
rently trapped in.
"It is in the public's best interest that

the litigation be fully and finally resolved
in a way that the benefits of the funds can
flow to the entitled beneficiaries, which in
clude a major religious institution, a world
renowned educational institution, and one
of the premier art museums in the coun
try," Rawlings said.
Distribution of the money has been held
up for almost two years by legal wrangling
over whether the Boston-based First
Church of Christ, Scientist, lived up to the
terms of the sisters' wills.
The sisters stipulated that the church
would receive what then amounted to a
$98 million bequest if it published and dis
tributed "The Destiny of the Mother
Church" — a biography of church founder
Mary Baker Eddy, written by Bliss Knapp,
Eloise Mabury's late husband.
Under the terms of the wills, the church
must label the book as "authorized litera
ture" and distribute it in "substantially all
Christian Science Reading Rooms."
If, however, the church failed to live up
to these conditions, the wills state that the
money is to be split between two designat
ed alternate beneficiaries: Stanford and
the museum.
In December 1991, the estate trustees
filed a motion in Los Angeles Superior
Court asking that the money be given to
the church. But in February 1992, lawyers
for Stanford and the museum sought to
block the distribution of the money, claim
ing that the church had not properly pub
lished and circulated the biography.
After a year of pre-trial court proce-
dures, the parties agreed in
March to begin court-supervised
settlement discussions. "The Set
tlement agreement is the product
of approximately 10 months and
literally thousands of hours of
arms-length negotiations,"
according to the petitions filed
yesterday.
The biography has generated
"a firestorm of controversy"
within the church, the petitions

say, because some Christian Sci
entists characterize the book as
"heresy," arguing that it equates
Eddy with Jesus.
Because of this controversy
and the fact that "the Mother
Church doesn't govern her
branches' reading rooms," some
of the rooms have elected not to
carry the book, stymieing the
church's ability to "fulfill the
terms of the bequest," Talkott
said.
