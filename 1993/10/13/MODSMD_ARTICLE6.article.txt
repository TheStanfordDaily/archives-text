# Trustees discuss ideas on education, budget
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Skip Schwartz Staff writers 
The Board of Trustees completed two
and a half days of discussions yesterday on
issues ranging from the new Commission
on Undergraduate Education to Universi
ty plans for future budget cuts.
The meetings began with a retreat on
Sunday together with members of the
Commission on Undergraduate Education
that was intended primarily as an opportu
nity for the trustees — most of whom ei
ther attended or taught at Stanford — to
offer their views on what they hope the
commission will accomplish, according to
Geoffrey Cox, vice provost for institutional
planning.
"The trustees are important sources of
input — they care a lot about Stanford and
give generously of their money and time,"
he said.
Cox added that the trustees "are not sit
ting as a government body trying to legis

late certain things" dealing with the com
mission.
Mathematics Prof. Brad Osgood, a
member of the education commission, said
the retreat was "pretty wide-ranging . . .
more broad than deep."
The meeting with the trustees was use
ful for gaining insight into "what people
out in the real world are looking for in
Stanford students, and how we as faculty
are preparing them," he said.
But, he added, "the sentiment was that
we shouldn't worry so much about what
other people are looking for, but to concen
trate on what people of wisdom think is
best, and that the rest will take care of it
self."
Also during the weekend's meetings,
Condoleezza Rice made her first appear
ance as provost before a board subcommit
tee when she met with the Committee on
Academic Policy, Planning and Manage
ment to discuss her recently announced
plans to oversee long-term budget
cuts.
Rice briefed the committee on
her plans — still in the formative
stage — to restructure iadminis
trative costs and reconsider aca
demic programs. "She set the
context for the operating process
es that will be starting soon,"
said Patricia Plummer, an assis
tant to Rice.
Communication Prof. Steven
Chaffee, who sits on the board's
academic policy committee, said
that while Rice did not divulge
any new details on the effort, she
did suggest that final decisions on
cuts will not be made by a large
body representing various inter
est groups, as they were in the
$43 million deficit-reduction pro
cess two years ago.
"She said she does not want to
reconstitute the big, killer com

mittee that everybody, it seemed,
was on," he said. "But while say
ing she won't recreate that kind
of body, she was sort of co-opting
[faculty] into cutting our own
budgets."
The trustees' only policy deci
sion, according to board secretary
Marlene Wine, was to approve
concepts for continued seismic
remodeling of campus structures
damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta
Earthquake.
The remodeling is targeted pri
marily at areas in the Quad, the
Stanford Museum and Green
Library.
"Some remodeling is immedi
ate, but it will be years before we
repair all the damage from the
earthquake," said Michael Han
nan, professor of business and
member of the trustees' Commit
tee on Land and Buildings.
He attributed the delay to "the
fact that the University's long
legal battles with the Federal
Emergency Management Agency
are not yet settled."
