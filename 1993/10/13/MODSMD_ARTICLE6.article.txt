The Board of Trustees completed two
and a half days of discussions yesterday on
issues ranging from the new Commission
on Undergraduate Education to Universi

The meetings began with a retreat on
Sunday together with members of the
Commission on Undergraduate Education
that was intended primarily as an opportu

ther attended or taught at Stanford — to
offer their views on what they hope the
commission will accomplish, according to
Geoffrey Cox, vice provost for institutional
planning.
"The trustees are important sources of
input — they care a lot about Stanford and
give generously of their money and time,"
he said.
Cox added that the trustees "are not sit
ting as a government body trying to legis

late certain things" dealing with the com
mission.
Mathematics Prof. Brad Osgood, a
member of the education commission, said
the retreat was "pretty wide-ranging . . .
more broad than deep."
The meeting with the trustees was use
ful for gaining insight into "what people
out in the real world are looking for in
Stanford students, and how we as faculty
are preparing them," he said.
But, he added, "the sentiment was that
we shouldn't worry so much about what
other people are looking for, but to concen
trate on what people of wisdom think is
best, and that the rest will take care of it
self."

Academic Policy, Planning and Manage
ment to discuss her recently announced
