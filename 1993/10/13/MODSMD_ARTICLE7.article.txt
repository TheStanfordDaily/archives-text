# Terman lights to save energy
## 
### Heather Carlson 
Eric Selmon and Dave Groves had a bright idea.
And now the University is spending $100,000 to im
plement it.
Taking its first step toward recognizing the im
portance of energy-efficient lighting, Stanford is un
dertaking a massive lighting retrofit project for Ter
man Engineering Building.
The new lighting system, designed by Selmon
and Groves, is expected to reduce Terman's electric
ity consumption by 46 percent, which will save the
University over $27,000 per year.
Under the supervision of Civil Engineering Prof.
Gil Masters, the two undergraduates spearheaded a
project to determine a more energy-efficient way to
light up Terman. They started by counting light fix
tures, sending out surveys and monitoring electrici
ty consumption in Terman. They finished by formu
lating a proposal that the University accepted last
spring.
Their proposal is to replace the
two T-12 fluorescent lamps in each
lighting fixture with two T-8 lamps.
T-8s generate 5 percent more light,
but consume less electricity than
the older T-12 lamps.
When the project is completed,
more than 4,600 lamps throughout
the building will have been
replaced.
The retrofit will reduce electrici
ty consumption by more than
317,000 kilowatt-hours per year —
which is equivalent to the amount
of electricity used to pop 4,731,343
bags of popcorn. This amount of
electricity conserved would also
provide enough power for an aver
age car to drive 208,000 miles.
The retrofit project will save
enough money in electricity bills to
pay for itself in less than four
years. The money and energ saved
at Terman will help supply electric
ity at new buildings across campus
such as the Green Earth Sciences
Building and the DAPER athletic
facility.
"Give the students all the credit.
They had the guts to present their
idea to the University, and now its
paying off," Masters said of the two
Earth Systems majors.
In creating the project, the two
undergraduates "were inspired by
the budget cutting stuff going on,"
he said.
"I figure from this project [the
University is] saving about what I
am paying in tuition every year,"
Selmon said.
The project originated in the fall
of 1991 as an outgrowth of the
group Stanford Energy Action
Movement, a team of six students

interested in analyzing energy con
sumption at Stanford.
In the system the students
designed, more efficient electronic
ballasts, which regulate the voltage
transmitted to the lamps, would
replace the energy-guzzling electro
magnetic ballasts.
When fluorescent lights are first
turned on, they need high voltage to
excite the gases in the lamp.
The ballasts allow high voltage

to pass to the lamp during this
start-up stage. Then, after the lamp
has heated up, the ballast reduces
the voltage transmitted to the
lamp.
The new T-8s turn on much
more quickly than the old T-12
lamps because of these new bal
lasts.
The students chose to use two T
-8s for each fixture instead of using
one T-8 with reflectors, since using
only one lamp would reduce the
previous light output by about 30
percent.
"They will really give a better
representation of color," explained
Scott Gould, a member of the ener

gy management group that helped
guide the students' project through
the approval process.
Selmon and Groves also
researched the need for light as well
as the type of illumination.
This study will result in the
installation of occupancy sensors in
low-usage areas such as the Ter
man Library stacks. The new lamps
will automatically turn off when
people are not present.
In addition, offices that get sun
light during parts of the day will
have dual switching so that occu
pants can turn off half the lights
when there is partial lighting from
the sun.
"I think the Terman community
is going to like the new lighting,"
Groves said.
He and Selmon are also trying to
plan a two-unit class in which stu
dents can analyze lighting in other
buildings on campus and make pro
posals for retrofits.
These could include larger build
ings on campus, but will likely not
include dormitories. Retrofits in
dorm rooms would not save the
University enough money to justify
the expense, Gould said.
"The potential for savings is so
much greater in the larger academ
ic buildings," he said. Meyer
Library, which consumes the most
electricity from lighting on campus,
may also be targeted for a retrofit in
the future.
Many students have resorted to
halogen lamps to enhance the light
ing in their rooms. But the halo
gens are energy nightmares,
because instead of providing direct
light, they reflect it off of ceiling
surfaces. The effect is a soothing
glow, but ceilings

are not perfect reflectors, so much
of the light is wasted and absorbed
into the ceiling.
Popular halogen lamps consume
500 watts of electricity, which is
about 500 percent more electricity
than what is necessary to provide
enough light for most students.

Selmon and Groves have also
written a paper about their project
and will present it at the World
Energy Engineering Conference in
Atlanta, Ga., at the end of the
month.
"The people at the conference
will know about fluorescent light

bulbs and electronic ballasts —
but what they may not know is
that students are doing it,"
Groves said.
"We're hoping that universities
that are in the same situation we
are in will have students get
involved," he said.
