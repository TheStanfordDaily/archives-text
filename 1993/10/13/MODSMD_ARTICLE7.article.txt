# Terman lights to save energy
## 
### Heather Carlson 
Eric Selmon and Dave Groves had a bright idea.
And now the University is spending $100,000 to im
plement it.
Taking its first step toward recognizing the im
portance of energy-efficient lighting, Stanford is un
dertaking a massive lighting retrofit project for Ter
man Engineering Building.
The new lighting system, designed by Selmon
and Groves, is expected to reduce Terman's electric
ity consumption by 46 percent, which will save the
University over $27,000 per year.
Under the supervision of Civil Engineering Prof.
Gil Masters, the two undergraduates spearheaded a
project to determine a more energy-efficient way to
light up Terman. They started by counting light fix
tures, sending out surveys and monitoring electrici
ty consumption in Terman. They finished by formu
lating a proposal that the University accepted last
spring.
