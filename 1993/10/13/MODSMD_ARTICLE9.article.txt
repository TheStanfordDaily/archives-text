# Earth systems major gaining popularity

With seven graduates and 53 current
mqjors, the year-and-a-half old earth systems
mqjor has vaulted itself into the academic
mainstream at Stanford.
The mqjor, which also offers a master's
degree and a coterminal degree, is one "whose
time has come at Stanford," said Deanna Fab
bro-Johnston, earth systems administrator.
"There is a great interest in environmental
problems," she said. "Earth systems provides
an avenue that allows students to pursue
courses to take them into the next century."
The program — one of only three of its
kind in the country — is one of the most
demanding programs in the School of Earth
Sciences, said Prof. Gary Ernst, the school's
dean.
In 1990, the program was conceived by fac
ulty and students in year-long proceedings,
and the first earth systems undergraduate
degree was conferred in June 1992.

The requires an interdisciplinary
education that stresses courses in the schools
of Humanities and Sciences, Earth Sciences
and Engineering.
The universality of the nwyor was a strong
selling point for students. "I wanted a mtyor
that would let me study science, but not close
the doors to other fields." said sophomore
earth systems mtgor Andy Chassin.
The explosion in the numbers of earth sys
tems majors can also be attributed to an
increased awareness of environmental issues,
said Susan Alexander, the academic coordina
tor for the msgor.
Although the program is growing and
evolving, Alexander foresees a cap on the
number of majors. "Earth systems will not
get as big as the Human Biology program
because it is very difficult," she said. "The
required courses should keep enrollment at a
manageable level."
While some environmental majors, such as
the environmental track of civil engineering,

force students to take specific classes within
the department, the earth systems
allows students to take classes in many areas.
Graduates in earth systems can go on to a
myriad of related fields, Alexander said. Grad
uates of the program have gone on to work at
NASA and the White House. Current imyors
are planning employment in fields ranging
from law to public policy to engineering.
Ernst said he believes students should seek
a graduate degree after an earth systems
"You have to know more than many
survey courses. It's important to have a good,
broad background, but a graduate degree is
really required to serve today's complex prob
lems."
The earth systems faculty is very excited
about the future of the major. "It will provide
a new understanding of the planet Earth, but
time will tell," Ernst said. "We have high
hopes, but who knows? Environmental prob
lems won't go away, they will only be exacer
bated if something isn't done."
