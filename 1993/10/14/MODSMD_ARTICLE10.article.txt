Students passing through
White Plaza yesterday may have
been a little startled by the
demonstration of exploding gas
vapors and a high-voltage power
line display featured in Quake-
Fest 1993.
The event was designed to pre
pare Stanford students for the
type of seismic disaster that
brought the University — and vir
tually the entire Bay Area — to a
standstill during the 1989 Loma
Prieta Earthquake.
About a half-dozen companies
participated in the event, ped
dling quake-preparedness prod
ucts such as fastening systems for
computers and stereos as well as
emergency survival kits.
The Quake Mobile, an earth
quake-preparedness van, was on
hand to tag animals with the Dat
a Pet electronic identification
microchip, which shelters can use
to identify lost pets. And the 3M
corporation had the latest in shat
terproof window technologies on
display.
Junior Garheng Kong bought
two earthquake-preparedness

kits — one for himself and one for
his family in Fresno — because,
he said, "I've been in little
quakes, and you just never know
when it's going to hit."
Dan Smith, of the Stanford
Police Department's Special Ser
vices Unit, said that, despite
structural damages still visible on
campus, people still tend to ignore
the looming threat of another
large earthquake. "It's an aware
ness issue," he said.
Smith urges students to read
the earthquake-safety pamphlet
that is distributed with every
room key and to participate in the
dorm evacuation drills taking
place this week.
Emphasizing the importance
of these maneuvers, Smith cited
a U.S. Geological Survey study
released in 1990 which reports a
67 percent chance of another
seven-point or larger earthquake
occurring in the Bay Area in the
next 30 years.
In 1988, before the Loma Pri
eta Earthquake, scientists at the
Geological Survey predicted only
a 50 percent chance of such an
earthquake occurring in the next
30 years.
