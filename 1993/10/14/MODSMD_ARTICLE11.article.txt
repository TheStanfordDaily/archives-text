U.N. threatens sanctions
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The
Security Council prepared a threat yes
terday to reapply economic sanctions
next week to show Haiti's military rulers
it means business in demanding a return
to democracy.
Under a draft resolution, the council
would give Haiti's leaders until Monday
to stop violating a July agreement to
reinstate democratic rule before reimpos
ing an arms and oil embargo lifted less
than two months ago.
The United States has led the call for
reimposing sanctions against the impov
erished nation since armed toughs
backed by the military blocked the land
ing of U.N. forces earlier this week.
The draft resolution does not ask the
council to refreeze the foreign holdings of
Haiti's transitional government because
that might hurt the democratically elect
ed body as it tries to create conditions for
Aristide's scheduled Oct. 30 return.
Nor does it ask to authorize the use of
force to permit Aristide's restoration. The

previous round of economic sanctions at
least prodded Haiti's military rulers to
sign the July agreement, and recent U.N.
and American casualties in Somalia have
made a military strike an unsavory option.
49 killed in train wreck
BOMBAY, India (AP) — Dozens of
women jumped from a burning com
muter train into the path of another
train bearing down on an adjoining track
yesterday. At least 49 passengers were
crushed to death, news agencies said.
About 70 women were injured, said
Bombay police spokesman Avinash Jad
hav.
Railway spokesman Mukul Marwah
said the train had come to a halt after
smoke seeped into a coach from a fire in
the undercarriage. Women panicked and
scrambled through the large, open door
way of the coach only to fall in the path of
a fast train coming from the opposite
direction, officials said.
The cause of the fire was not immedi
ately known.
