# No early pullout from Somalia
## Clinton fends off Congress, stands by March 31 deadline 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Clinton and Senate leaders struggled
yesterday to avert a showdown over
congressional demands for an early
withdrawal of U.S. troops from Soma
lia.
"I think the obvious import of what's
happened in the last few days is that
we're moving in the right direction and
I hope we can continue to do that,"
Clinton said at the White House.
A leading Senate critic of the presi
dent's policy, Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
eased his demand for withdrawal by the
end of the year. And the White House
sought to appease angry lawmakers by
furnishing — two days before it was due
— a report defining the military mis
sion as humanitarian and stating
emphatically that it is not open-ended.
In an interview, Clinton reiterated
his position that the United States
would withdraw its forces by the end of
March, but he indicated he was open to
other dates.

"We could leave earlier if, No. 1, I'm
sure we can do it safely, and, No. 2, it's
clear to me that we've done everything
that's possible to give the Somalis what
you might call survival rights," Clinton
said.
Byrd, the Appropriations Committee
chairman, had threatened the adminis
tration with a measure cutting off all
funds for U.S. forces by Dec. 31. But
yesterday he offered a Feb. 1 deadline
— with a provision that Congress could
authorize additional time.
The Clinton administration has tried
to fight off lawmakers' demands for the
immediate withdrawal of American
troops following the raid on Somali
forces loyal to warlord Mohamed Far
rah Aidid that left 18 Americans dead.
In a related development, a U.S.
presidential envoy made it plain yester
day from Mogadishu that Washington
wouldn't bargain for captured U.S. pilot
Michael Durant.
"We will not buy prisoners," said

Robert Oakley, the former U.S. ambas
sador to Somalia.
Onkley did not rule out a U.S. rescue
mission to free Durant. But he hinted
that Durant's ordeal was almost over.
Somali fighters seized the chief war
rant officer after his helicopter was shot
down during a fierce Oct. 3 battle that
killed up to 18 U.S. soldiers.
Oakley, who arrived Sunday in quest
of a peace settlement in Somalia, insist
ed yesterday that Durant be freed with
out conditions. He said there would be
no bargaining or exchange of prisoners
to secure the release of Durant or the
Nigerian private captured earlier.
But he added, "I believe that the
release of both prisoners would indeed
be a very positive sign. . . . There are
some optimistic indications out there."
He would not elaborate.
President Clinton worked to reas
sure rebellious lawmakers yesterday
about U.S. policy in Somalia, stressing
the humanitarian motives.
