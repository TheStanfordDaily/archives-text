## Editorial Cutting community Dining Services' changes to residence-based meals hinder Res Ed's purpose 
### 
ARE IN strong sup
\l\f port of the Residen-
V V tial Education princi
ple of 'building community during
meals with each house together.' "
So states the Stanford Univer
sity Dining Services brochure,
which was distributed earlier this
year to students, parents and
prospective freshmen.
While the brochure makes
claims about providing a place on
campus for "good times, good
food, good friends" (which bears a
suspicious resemblance to the
McDonald's jingle, "food, folks
and fun"), Dining Services has
made cuts in its schedule which
do not seem to work toward this
goal of providing an opportunity
for good times. Furthermore, the
mere publication of the brochures
suggests a somewhat stilted sense
of spending priorities at Dining
Services.
The most glaring example of
these cutbacks can be found in
Branner Hall. Its meal service was
cut this year to only eight meals a
week — lunch and dinner Monday
through Thursday. Manzanita
Dining Commons is another vic
tim of insufficient service, as it
only offers weekday lunches and
dinners.
Unfortunately, this new policy
forces residents to find an alter
native location to eat, usually in
Wilbur or Stern Halls. Hence,
nearly 600 students are required
to trek elsewhere for weekend
meals and breakfast, creating
long lines and an impersonal
atmosphere for both themselves
and the residents who live there.
A sense of community within a
residence is developed primarily
in the dining hall. That feeling is
lost when students are farmed out
to other dorms for meals, mainly

because students tend to eat in
small groups of people they
already know. When given a
chance to eat in their own resi
dence, students feel more com
fortable introducing themselves
to new people.
It is also important that stu
dents who live in a large dorm,
where meeting people on other
halls and floors can be difficult,
have a regular opportunity to
meet and socialize with just their
fellow residents.
Shirley Everett, associate direc
tor of housing and dining services,
cited budget constraints as the
reason for service cutbacks. How
ever, it would have been a better
idea to abandon concepts like the
16-page glossy brochure before
eliminating meals.
This publicity provided by the
brochure is pointless, to say the
least. Students are required by
the University to purchase a meal
plan corresponding to the resi
dence in which they live; when
they eat at another dining hall,
they do it to eat with a friend.
Since the University has a virtual
monopoly on the food students
eat, there is very little need to sell
a dining hall. This is not a com
petitive market.
Although the brochures only
cost about $2,500 to print, in this
time of budget cuts it is vital to
save every penny. Moreover, stu
dents will most likely throw away
the brochure, rather than keep it
on their shelves for handy refer
ence. Simple fact sheets seem to
be a more frugal alternative.
Finally, the fact that nearly 600
students cannot eat in their own
dining hall for the majority of
meals each week is in direct con
trast with Residential Educa
tion's goal, and with Dining Ser
vices' statement to support that
aim. Dining Services should make
every attempt to trim the fat on
its operations to reinstate week
end service to the East Campus
residences.
"Good times, good food, good
friends" shouldn't just be a five
day-a-week motto.
