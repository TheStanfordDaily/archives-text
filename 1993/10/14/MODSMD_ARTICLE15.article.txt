## A 						still-imbalanced policy 
### 
AFTER YEARS of waiting, Stan
ford now has a new sexual harass
ment policy. However, replacing a
bad policy with a flawed policy is cause
for subdued celebration.
The recent Academic Senate discus
sion highlighted a serious problem with
the new policy. It relies on existing
grievance procedures for any victims
who wish to file a formal complaint.
Campus experts agree that this will
serve to keep the number of formal com
plaints to a minimum. In particular, this
procedure continues to keep women
graduate students from charging male
faculty members with harassment.
It is neither reasonable nor possible
to expect the University to stop harass
ment from taking place. Legislation
cannot force people to treat each other
humanely and respectfully. Instead, we
can only sanction them when their
behavior steps over the line. Unfortu
nately, the new policy places an undue
burden on victims. Graduate students
(like untenured faculty) risk their
entire careers when leveling charges of
harassment.
Under the new policy a student can
pursue informal or formal avenues.
Informal resolutions are preferable to
protracted formal proceedings, but the
informal route will only be useful if it is
backed up by a strong and effective for
mal sanctioning process. A formal
grievance procedure provides the teeth

which make informal resolutions effec
tive.
All disputes between students and
faculty are covered by the "Academic
Grievance Procedure," which was writ
ten to cover grading disputes, not advis
ing or research supervisory relation
ships. The steps for filing a formal
grievance are: 1. Confront the harasser.
2. Talk to the department chair. 3. File
formal charges with the dean.
At this point, your allegations are the
talk of the department. Your under
standing of the events is in question.
Other faculty feel compelled to take
sides. The entire issue is now being
debated in the public arena. What are
your chances of finding another mem
ber for your dissertation committee
who will give you genuine, engaged
feedback? What are your chances for
being recommended for a prestigious
post-doc? What will the faculty say
when you are under consideration for a
TA-ship or a faculty position? Will you
be described in professional terms or as
a trouble-maker?
Dr. Frances Conley accurately
described incidents of sexual harass
ment as the exercise of power. Often
those with behavioral problems are
powerful figures in their department.
How many department chairs will jeop
ardize the reputation of a department
by antagonizing or firing a nationally
recognized scholar? As Conley said, peo

pie with power protect people with
power.
Few people are as powerless as grad
uate students. Their futures depend on
being able to make a mark in the
department, and getting the support of
the faculty. Rocking the boat — forcing
faculty to examine their own behavior
and that of their colleagues — is not col
legial behavior.
I would advise a student who has
been harassed to consider her options
carefully. If the harassment is prolonged
and egregious, I do not believe that the
informal channels will suffice. However,
it is probably not worth the personal
risk of pursuing the formal channels.
Until an independent office is given
the responsibility and authority to
investigate allegations and sanction the
guilty, sexual harassment will remain
an underreported and secret problem at
Stanford. This step would not add
"unnecessary complexity" as President
Casper fears, but will rather serve to
equalize the power between harasser
and victim.
