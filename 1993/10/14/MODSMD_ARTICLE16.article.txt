## Council of Presidents defends Student Advisory Group 
### 
IN THE OCT. 12 Daily, the editori
al staff precipitously shot down the
creation of the Student Advisory
Group on Undergraduate Education
by the Council of Presidents.
First, our effort to concentrate stu
dent opinions into a cohesive form was
illogically criticized as an attempt at
"diluting student opinion."
In fact, the Student Advisory Group
will serve as a means to consolidate
students' opinions into a cohesive and
effective voice. Carrying direct input
from a diverse student body, the voic

es of our two student representatives
to the Commission can only be
strengthened in credibility and influ
ence.
Next, our effort to involve more
students in the otherwise removed
decision-making process was inappro
priately dismissed as an attempt to
create more bureaucracy.
In fact, this "bureaucracy" will
serve as a means to critically evaluate
specific areas of undergraduate educa
tion, based on the experiences of stu
dents rather than on the perceptions

of administrators.
The Student Advisory Group will
facilitate more student input and draw
more students into the process. We
have been approached by many stu
dents who express both feelings of
estrangement from University deci
sion-making and desire for a chance to
be heard.
This is precisely the opportunity
that the Student Advisory Group will
provide.
We feel that students necessarily
have a vested interest in the nature

and quality of undergraduate educa
tion at Stanford.
And we believe that our current
efforts to ensure effective representa
tion of students' voices and an inclu
sive, rigorous review of undergraduate
education will, in the long run, be well
worth the hasty criticism received
from The Daily.
