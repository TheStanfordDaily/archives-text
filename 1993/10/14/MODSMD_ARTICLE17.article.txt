## Harris' horse sense leads third-ranked polo squad 
### Kathryn Yang Editorial staff 
Perhaps it is only natural that a
school nicknamed "the Farm" has
one of the best polo teams in the
nation.
But up until last year, the only
polo squad to receive much atten
tion on campus was Stanford's pow
erful water polo squad. Meanwhile,
the University's horse polo club has
played the role of wallflower. In fact,
the team was having problems
scraping together enough horses to
compete only a few seasons ago.
But last year, the horse polo

squad surprised almost everyone as
it made its first-ever postseason
appearance with a trip to the NCAA
Final Four. Finishing the season at
No. 4, the Cardinal are looking to
improve upon that showing this
year, as they kick off their season
ranked third in the nation.
Horse polo's counterpart to
water polo standouts Wolf Wigo or
Chris Wallin is senior captain John
Harris, who has been the catalyst
behind the Cardinal's meteoric rise
from relative obscurity to West
Coast polo powerhouse in just three
short years.
For his efforts, Harris was award

ed the Town and Country National
Polo Player of the Year award over
the summer — the highest collegiate
polo award in the nation.
"West Coast polo is the smallest
I segment! in the nation and we
haven't produced a top collegiate
player in years," said senior attack
er Guy Elliott. "So John winning
the award is a really tremendous
boost for us. Having him with Stan
ford makes Western polo much bet
ter known and respected."
Indeed, before Harris came to
Stanford, UC-Davis was dominating
the West Coast circuit and competing
with the traditionally strong East

Coast clubs. Meanwhile, the Cardi
nal floundered, merely trying to
recruit enough players and horses.
Harris, a seasoned player since
the age of 12, could have fit quite
nicely into the East Coast scene with
his English Pony Club experience.
However, he opted for the West
Coast, where most collegiate players
mount a polo horse for the first time
during their freshman year.
"Most experienced players flock to
the East Coast powers, but I didn't
want to succumb to playing for an
established program," Harris said. "I
wanted to come here and try and
work with a developing program."
Since that fortunate decision, the
club has made a steady climb into
the penthouse with Harris riding in
the No. 2 position, flanked by
defenseman John Mcßitchie and
Elliott in the forward position.
"John is the nucleus of our club,"
said coach Wes Linfoot. "He's the
playmaker on the field, as well as an
amazing captain, because polo is
everything to him. That's why he
means so much to the national polo
community."
On a scale of negative two to 10,
with 10 being the best, Harris is
handicapped at a two in the interna
tional polo arena Most collegiate
players check in at a minus one, and
America has only produced five
players at the 10-level ever.
"He's a very aggressive player
and goal-scorer," Linfoot said. "If he
played more tournament polo dur
ing the year, they would undoubted
ly raise his ranking, but he does
have to go to school in addition to
playing polo."
However, when Harris is not
busy finishing his English degree at
Stanford, he is touring the globe and
competing with top clubs around
the world.
"I expect that with a little luck
and the plentiful experience he's
had, John can be a professional
international polo player after he
graduates," Linfoot said.
Although he has considered that
possibility, Harris is presently try
ing to direct all his energy toward

finishing his collegiate career with
an NCAA title.
With a veteran starting line-up,
Harris has already made all the pre
dictions for this year.
"We were 10-1 last year and
ranked No. 3 this year, so I reckon
no one's really going to be able to
touch us on the West Coast this sea
son," he said. "That will put us
through to the nationals where as

the No. 3 seed we will meet the prob
able No. 2 team, Virginia. I think we
can beat them and move onto the
finals this year against Cornell most
likely."
Powered by optimism and talent,
Harris and his teammates will try to
complete a polo sweep and team up
with their aquatic counterpart to
bring two NCAA titles back to the
Farm this year.

the world.
"I expect that with a little luck
and the plentiful experience he's
had, John can be a professional
international polo player after he
graduates," Linfoot said.
Although he has considered that
possibility, Harris is presently try
ing to direct all his energy toward

finishing his collegiate career with
an NCAA title.
With a veteran starting line-up,
Harris has already made all the pre
dictions for this year.
"We were 10-1 last year and
ranked No. 3 this year, so I reckon
no one's really going to be able to
touch us on the West Coast this sea
son," he said. "That will put us
through to the nationals where as

the No. 3 seed we will meet the prob
able No. 2 team, Virginia. I think we
can beat them and move onto the
finals this year against Cornell most
likely."
Powered by optimism and talent,
Harris and his teammates will try to
complete a polo sweep and team up
with their aquatic counterpart to
bring two NCAA titles back to the
Farm this year.

Harris and his horse Don Quixote look to repeat last year's showing
with a repeat trip to the NCAA Final Four this year.
Perhaps it is only natural that a
school nicknamed "the Farm" has
one of the best polo teams in the
nation.
But up until last year, the only
polo squad to receive much atten
tion on campus was Stanford's pow
erful water polo squad. Meanwhile,
the University's horse polo club has
played the role of wallflower. In fact,
the team was having problems
scraping together enough horses to
compete only a few seasons ago.
But last year, the horse polo

squad surprised almost everyone as
it made its first-ever postseason
appearance with a trip to the NCAA
Final Four. Finishing the season at
No. 4, the Cardinal are looking to
improve upon that showing this
year, as they kick off their season
ranked third in the nation.
Horse polo's counterpart to
water polo standouts Wolf Wigo or
Chris Wallin is senior captain John
Harris, who has been the catalyst
behind the Cardinal's meteoric rise
from relative obscurity to West
Coast polo powerhouse in just three
short years.
For his efforts, Harris was award

ed the Town and Country National
Polo Player of the Year award over
the summer — the highest collegiate
polo award in the nation.
"West Coast polo is the smallest
I segment! in the nation and we
haven't produced a top collegiate
player in years," said senior attack
er Guy Elliott. "So John winning
the award is a really tremendous
boost for us. Having him with Stan
ford makes Western polo much bet
ter known and respected."
Indeed, before Harris came to
Stanford, UC-Davis was dominating
the West Coast circuit and competing
with the traditionally strong East

Coast clubs. Meanwhile, the Cardi
nal floundered, merely trying to
recruit enough players and horses.
Harris, a seasoned player since
the age of 12, could have fit quite
nicely into the East Coast scene with
his English Pony Club experience.
However, he opted for the West
Coast, where most collegiate players
mount a polo horse for the first time
during their freshman year.
"Most experienced players flock to
the East Coast powers, but I didn't
want to succumb to playing for an
established program," Harris said. "I
wanted to come here and try and
work with a developing program."
Since that fortunate decision, the
club has made a steady climb into
the penthouse with Harris riding in
the No. 2 position, flanked by
defenseman John Mcßitchie and
Elliott in the forward position.
"John is the nucleus of our club,"
said coach Wes Linfoot. "He's the
playmaker on the field, as well as an
amazing captain, because polo is
everything to him. That's why he
means so much to the national polo
community."
On a scale of negative two to 10,
with 10 being the best, Harris is
handicapped at a two in the interna
tional polo arena Most collegiate
players check in at a minus one, and
America has only produced five
players at the 10-level ever.
"He's a very aggressive player
and goal-scorer," Linfoot said. "If he
played more tournament polo dur
ing the year, they would undoubted
ly raise his ranking, but he does
have to go to school in addition to
playing polo."
However, when Harris is not
busy finishing his English degree at
Stanford, he is touring the globe and
competing with top clubs around
the world.
"I expect that with a little luck
and the plentiful experience he's
had, John can be a professional
international polo player after he
graduates," Linfoot said.
Although he has considered that
possibility, Harris is presently try
ing to direct all his energy toward

finishing his collegiate career with
an NCAA title.

Harris has already made all the pre
dictions for this year.
