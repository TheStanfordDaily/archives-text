# When Kathryn met Dave: a Flo Mo tale
## 
### 
Do you remember the sappy
romance movie "When Harry
Met Sally?"
Well, at the beginning of that
flick Hany explains to Sally that
men and women cannot be
friends. Accordingly, the two move
on and discover a relationship,
proving that men and women can
not perpetually remain at the
equilibrium "friends stage."

Personally, I disagree with
that. Men and women should and
can be just plain ol' friends with
out developing a romance or dete
riorating into that "I just don't
understand (wo)men" mode.
Last year, I found a wonderful
male friend in my neighbor, Dave
Garnett. By default, Dave, a
senior linebacker on the 1992
Cardinal football squad, was
placed into Flo Mo on a floor full
of freshmen and sophomores
after his fraternity was dissolved.
Self-described as bookish and
quiet, Dave made a huge impact
both on Stanford's ascent to a
New Year's Day bowl victory and
on the naive freshman girl who
lived next door.
Please don't get me wrong.
Although I screamed and rooted
for No. 44 every time he made a
play on defense, this is not some
demented case of hero-worship.
To me, Dave was a throwback
to the elementary school buddy
with whom you played four
square and shared animal crack
ers during recess.
Although he helped Stanford

assemble one of the best defen
sive units in the nation last year
— hard to believe that was only a
year ago, I know — Dave was also
a stiff competitor in our ritualis
tic Street Fighter II bouts on the
Super Nintendo.
Sprawled in front of our lousy
Res Ed-funded television at least
one night a week, we would con
sume massive amounts of grease
and preservatives, while duking
it out until the break of dawn on
the Street Fighter battlefields.
After a while Dave, who
always assumed the alter-ego of
Chun Li (the female martial
artist), could beat me with both
hands tied behind his back while
sitting in the next room studying
for the LSATs. Ouch! That's
when we added another pastime.
Again united by our scrap
metal television, we spent week
ends watching professional bas
ketball games and rooting for our
respective teams, while trash
talking the others.
By the end of the year, I had
compiled the usual "friend"
quota of pictures and memories,
including a shot that captured
Dave and me in a huge dog-pile
with the rest of the dorm.
Since then, Dave has graduat
ed and moved onto the Minneso
ta Vikings, where he has been
reunited with former Stanford
head coach Dennis Green. Rak
ing in the league minimum
$100,000 and playing with the
likes of Jim McMahon and Roger
Craig, I didn't think Dave would
have time for the pesky little
freshman who kept him up until
all hours of the night playing
childish video games last year.
But I reached out and called
him anyway.
I couldn't resist. I wanted to
call him earlier during the pre
season after the Vikings-Sea
