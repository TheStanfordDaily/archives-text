# Field hockey to exorcise Blue Devils
## 
### Christian Leone Staff writer 
After fighting Bobcats, Buck
eyes, Dukes and Wolverines, the
Stanford women's field hockey
team will take on an even more
menacing opponent this weekend
— the devil itself.
Well, actually, the Blue Devils.
Returning to the Bay Area after
splitting four games in Ohio, the
field hockey team will face Duke
(3-8) in Berkeley this Sunday.
The Sunday match gives the
Cardinal little time to rest from
last week's grueling series of
games. Stanford dominated the
first two contests of its roadtrip,

played on Ohio State's artificial
turf. However, although they con
tinued to play well through the
last two matches, the Cardinal
was overwhelmed by top-20
teams.
After whitewashing Ohio 4-0 in
the first matchup, the Cardinal
went on to pull out a squeaker in
the Ohio State contest, 1-0.
Senior forward Sara Hallock
was the star of the two shutouts,
increasing her goal-scoring streak
to nine consecutive games. In
addition to her individual success,
the Cardinal surpassed the .500
mark with the two victories,
upping their record to 5-4.
"We played really well," said

Hallock. "It was the best I've ever
seen us play. We all played to our
potential."
Behind the defense of Markley
Bavinger, Danielle Beynet and
Natalie McCullough, Stanford
then hoped to pull off an upset
against seventh-ranked James
Madison. But after a well-played
game, the Cardinal found itself
clinging to the short end of a 4-0
deficit.
The rubber match of the four
game roadtrip was a defensive bat
tle against 12th-ranked Michigan.
With one-and-a-half minutes left
in a scoreless game, Wolverine for
ward Sherene Smith found the
back of the net to send Stanford

home 2-2 on the trip and 5-6 over
all.
"It was really an even game,"
Hallock said. "No one could put
the ball in the net. Finally, they
scored off a corner."
Despite the last-minute loss to
Michigan, the roadtrip was a con
sidered a success for the Stanford
squad, which enjoys playing on
artificial turf. Boasting a strong
passing game, the Cardinal made
use of its excellent stickwork and
ball-handling abilities during all
four matches.
"The ball doesn't bounce much
on turf, so you have to pass a lot
more," Hallock said. "It's a much
better game."
This Sunday the Cardinal will
return to a grass field as they take
on Duke at Berkeley.
The defensively sound Duke
squad has given up only 18 goals
this season, averaging an impres
sive 1.48 goals-against statistic.
And with a potent offensive
attack, led by Laura Gentile, who
has nine of her team's 14 goals,
the Blue Devils should prove to be
quite an obstacle for the Cardinal.
Although the Blue Devils are
currently 3-8, their record is
deceiving. They play in the diffi
cult Atlantic Coast Conference
and five of their eight losses have
come at the hands of top-20
teams. Among these setbacks was
a 1-0 loss to archrival North Car
olina. Furthermore, the Blue Dev
ils have dropped close overtime
matches to lOth-ranked Temple
and 14th-ranked Northeastern.
After its own overtime disap
pointment against the Wolverines
last week, the Cardinal has been
trying to improve its stamina
through extra conditioning.
"We have been doing a lot of
sprints, (We are! trying to whip
ourselves into shape." Hallock
said. "If we keep playing the way
we did in Ohio we should win a lot
more games."
After Duke, the Cardinal will
begin gearing up for its biggest
tournament of the season when
Stanford takes on California in
the Golden Bears' home invita
tional on Oct. 23-24.

And with a potent offensive
attack, led by Laura Gentile, who
has nine of her team's 14 goals,
the Blue Devils should prove to be
quite an obstacle for the Cardinal.
Although the Blue Devils are
currently 3-8, their record is
deceiving. They play in the diffi
cult Atlantic Coast Conference
and five of their eight losses have
come at the hands of top-20
teams. Among these setbacks was
a 1-0 loss to archrival North Car
olina. Furthermore, the Blue Dev
ils have dropped close overtime
matches to lOth-ranked Temple
and 14th-ranked Northeastern.
After its own overtime disap
pointment against the Wolverines
last week, the Cardinal has been
trying to improve its stamina
through extra conditioning.
"We have been doing a lot of
sprints, (We are! trying to whip
ourselves into shape." Hallock
said. "If we keep playing the way
we did in Ohio we should win a lot
more games."
After Duke, the Cardinal will
begin gearing up for its biggest
tournament of the season when
Stanford takes on California in
the Golden Bears' home invita
tional on Oct. 23-24.

Excellent stickwork and cohesive passing allowed the Cardinal to win two on their recent roadtrip.
Stanford will look to repeat that solid performance against Duke this weekend.
