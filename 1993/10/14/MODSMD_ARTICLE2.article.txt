# Proposal to provide housing to sororities
## Unhoused Greeks could bid for open houses 
### Nick Kuritzky Staff writer 
Stanford's sororities could receive cam
pus housing in the near future, Fraternal
Affairs Adviser Heather Dunn said last
night.
Under a proposal that is likely to be ap
proved by the Office of Student Activities,
sororities would be able to bid to take over
vacated fraternity houses, Dunn said. The
proposal would amend the University's
original fraternity charter, which grants
housing rights only to Stanford's 11 origi
nal fraternities.
Although a formal decision has not yet
been made, Dunn said that if a house be
comes available, preference would likely be
given to sororities.
The new proposal would enable sorori
ties and unhoused fraternities to bid for
one of the original 11 houses if one of those
fraternities lost its housing privileges.
Beta Theta Pi, for example, lost its

housing permit last year due to insufficient
membership. Under the proposal, had the
Betas not regained their house this sum
mer, it could have been available to any fra
ternity or sorority.
Sororities were originally housed at
Stanford, but lost their housing charter in
the 19405. While sororities returned to
campus in the 19705, there was "no desire"
for housing until recently, said Dunn.
Presently, Roth is the only all-female
house on campus.
Dunn referred questions about the rea
son for the change and the proposal's time
line to Dean of Students Michael Jackson.
Jackson refused to comment on the issue
last night.
Jessica Schulman, president of the
Inter-Sorority Council, lauded the propos
al.
"It is a good idea that the University is
viewing women in the same light as men. I
am really excited about the possi
bilities of this," she said.
Janet Feldstein, president of
the Pi Beta Phi sorority, also
responded favorably to the pro
posal, calling it a "great idea" and
noted that, "In the light of the
University's strong emphasis on
equality, it is a logical next step

for the University to offer hous
ing to sororities. "
Feldstein added that a house
would eliminate many of the
problems faced by sororities, such
as having a low profile, and would
foster group solidarity.
Approval for the proposal was
not limited to sororities. Ken
Baerenklau, president of the
unhoused Sigma Phi Epsilon fra
ternity, agreed with Feldstein's
sentiment, underlining "the
inequitable distribution of Greek

housing between the sexes."
Baerenklau also said that a
number of fraternities would pre
fer to be housed, citing that hous
ing gives a fraternity "something
visible, that everyone can associ
ate with a group."
"When you are unhoused, it is
a lot more difficult for people to
know who you are." Baerenklau
said.
