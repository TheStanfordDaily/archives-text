# Proposal to provide housing to sororities
## Unhoused Greeks could bid for open houses

Stanford's sororities could receive cam
pus housing in the near future, Fraternal
Affairs Adviser Heather Dunn said last
night.
Under a proposal that is likely to be ap
proved by the Office of Student Activities,
sororities would be able to bid to take over
vacated fraternity houses, Dunn said. The
proposal would amend the University's
original fraternity charter, which grants
housing rights only to Stanford's 11 origi

Although a formal decision has not yet
been made, Dunn said that if a house be

given to sororities.

one of the original 11 houses if one of those
fraternities lost its housing privileges.
Beta Theta Pi, for example, lost its

housing permit last year due to insufficient
membership. Under the proposal, had the
Betas not regained their house this sum

ternity or sorority.
Sororities were originally housed at
Stanford, but lost their housing charter in
the 19405. While sororities returned to
campus in the 19705, there was "no desire"
for housing until recently, said Dunn.
Presently, Roth is the only all-female
house on campus.
Dunn referred questions about the rea

line to Dean of Students Michael Jackson.
Jackson refused to comment on the issue

Jessica Schulman, president of the
Inter-Sorority Council, lauded the propos

"It is a good idea that the University is
viewing women in the same light as men. I
