# The 						Music Man
## The 						life and tenure of Arthur Barnes 
### BY Linda Friedlieb 
ct. 2 was a memorable day for Stan-
M ford students — noteworthy because
m of our football team's disappointing
loss to Notre Dame, the mobs of
alumni here for Homecoming, and the first full
student section of the year.
But perhaps even more amazing were the
hundreds of former members of the Leland
Stanford Junior (pause) University Marching
Band sporting identical red and white T-shirts.
Yes, the Band almost — but not quite —
looked like a cohesive group of musicians.
The occasion was not only the official Stan
ford Band reunion, but also the 30th anniver
sary of the legendary Arthur Barnes' arrival on
the Farm. And the commemoration of that an
niversary in caricature on the Band's T-shirts is
quite possibly the closest thing the Stanford
Band has ever had to a uniform.
Barnes, Stanford's director of bands and a
professor of musical theory, is the man behind
the musical arrangements of both the Stanford
Symphonic Band and what is commonly
known as "the zoo band." His creations have
been heard at almost every athletic event since
the faH of 1963.
But way back then, he was just another grad
student, taking classes half-time and working
with campus musical groups — some of whom
did not appreciate his arrival.
In an interesting twist of fate, the Stanford
Band banned themselves from the football field,
striking for two games in protest of the dis
missal of Barnes' predecessor. But Barnes
quickly shrugged off these difficult beginnings,
introducing a new version of the "Star-Span
gled Banner" which earned him the devotion
and respect of both Bands' members.
"This piece specifically was arranged for the
Fresno State College Band when I was teaching
there. I wanted to do something different,"
Barnes said. "We had been in the past playing all
night games, and at that moment in the pre
game, with the spotlight on the flag, we played
the national anthem and I thought 'Geez, put
the spotlight on the flag and turn off all the
lights and we've really got a captive audience.
They can't move.'
"I figured 'We're not going to be able to see
any music. So we'll have to memorize it.' Well,
one way to memorize it is to only memorize half
of it. The first half is played by a lone, solo trum
pet. This was borne out of necessity. It just
worked out that way, and then we only had to
memorize the few notes that were left."
ince conducting the Band in its first
W performance of his version of "The
Star-Spangled Banner," Barnes has
directed both Stanford bands as well
as arranging pieces for sale and working with
off-campus Bay Area groups such as the El
Camino Youth Symphony and the Livermore
Symphony.
While he arranges most of the groups'
music, Barnes said he utilizes varying degrees of
student input. "There's no special direction for
the Symphonic Band, although we play the kind
of music we play. Just like there's no special di
rection for the orchestra or chorus — just to do
good music well.
"As far as the outdoor band goes, they pick
the music exclusively. And what usually hap
pens ... is they'll bring me a cassette tape of

music they want to have arranged. We never
buy any music; we write everything we play."
Some of Barnes* arrangements have awak
ened the ears of more than just Stanford stu
dents. In 1983, when Queen Elizabeth visited
campus, the Band played a Barnes original — a
simultaneous combination of two national an
thems.
"This was a funny situation because every
body in the Band had to have a picture ID on
their lapel. And the street up to the president's
house was lined with secret service men at like
every 10 feet. The security was so tight, and
understandably so, but it was just sort of
James Bondish," Barnes recalled. "And I don't
know why we got invited to play. It seemed
reasonable to have the Band play. So we
played 'God Save the Queen' and 'The Star
Spangled Banner' both at the same time. We
solved a musical problem there by putting two
tunes together."
Barnes said he is using the same tactic in an
arrangement he is preparing for this year's Big
Game pre-show in which the UC-Berkeley and
Stanford Bands will play the national anthem
together. "Well, our Band absolutely refused to
play our anthem with the Cal band, and I don't
think the Cal band really wanted to play it any
ways. So I said, let me write another arrange
ment. I've written the national anthem in a
pretty traditional arrangement, but starting

around the middle, I introduce at the same time
'America the Beautiful.' We shoved those two
pieces together. It's sort of a musical conun
drum."
M hile he hopes this year's show
will be memorable, Barnes
already has a pile of unforget
table Big Game memories.
One year "one of our band members registered
with the Cal band for their pre-band season and
got a uniform, went to the practices before
school started and then left and went back to
Stanford with the uniform. We used the uni
form in a show that year — that's classic."
While he has written almost every piece
heard at a Stanford football game since 1963, his
most well-known arrangement may be one he
originally thought could be a disaster — "All
Right Now."
"Remember in the '60s there were a lot of
things that the University got rid of tradition
wise. ... Most of the school songs were
trashed or eliminated. There were a lot of tra
ditional things that were just nixed. And in the
vacuum there doesn't seem to be very much to
take their place. 'All Right Now' was one of
those things that was brought up. And at the
time, of course, that was one of the popular
tunes of the day. Fortunately, most of the
alumni don't know the words. The words are

a little X-rated."
In addition to arranging music for the "zoo
band," Barnes has also served as faculty adviser,
and occasional disciplinarian, to the unruly
group. "The Band has changed in the same way
that the undergraduate student body has
changed — more conservative. Not in the
music they play but in the kind of people they
are," Barnes observed. "There's a feeling that
there's a tradition of outrageousness. And for
the context we're in perhaps there is, but if you
look at the past history of the Band, the Band is
more conservative than it was. It doesn't do as
many outrageous things — like really illegal,
outrageous things.
"But neither does the undergraduate student
body at Stanford. We don't have people climb
ing up and down the outside of Hoover Tower.
We used to have that," he laughed. "That's out
rageous— and probably illegal."
As for University attempts to control the
Band, Barnes said they are eternal. While he
himself doesn't try to discourage the natural
lawlessness of the Band, he added that he occa
sionally is forced to act as lawman. "Once in a
while something happens and then I have to
take action. Like kick the person out, or report
him to the dean of students, or to Marv Her
rington, the chief of police. He knows about the
Band — he's been in place for a long time."
rhe reunion this past homecoming
was a reminder to Barnes of the im
portance of the Stanford Band.
"This was a real love fest. I'm still
oasiang in the warmth and glow of the whole
operation.
"It was a sit-down dinner with wine on the
table and the Band going, a catered dinner. Sev
eral of the people who came back... were like
'This is the Stanford Band. What had hap
pened?' because it was a very, very classy opera
tion and it stayed that way right through the
whole dinner. And I saw a lot of people I hadn't
seen for a long time. A lot of people saw a lot of
people that they hadn't seen for a long time.
People came from all over the world. They came
from Europe, a couple came from Japan, and
that says a lot."
Barnes said he sees no special direction for
the Band to head in; he just wants it to reflect the
student body. "You know when I first came
here, you couldn't be in Band and be in a frater
nity. There was that wide a wedge between the
two groups. But the Band was really a collection
of a lot of peripheral people who were out there,
who were not part of the core student body — a
lot of misfits who didn't get along with any
body. It has always sort ofbeen the fraternity for
those who didn't want to be in a fraternity or
who couldn't afford to be in a fraternity, a big
glean of people who became friends just by
being together all the time."
Barnes said he feels like a part of the Band
family, and although he is officially retiring this
year he will remain here teaching, directing and
arranging music for at least another four years.
"Bam, immediately I think of the Band.
That's where I met all the people I really
know.... By about the middle '60s, it was very
cool to be in the Band, and to me the Band was
then, and still is, a slice of the student body you
don't have to afford to be a part of. And to leave
... just wouldn't be that much fun." ■

buy any music; we write everything we play."
Some of Barnes* arrangements have awak
ened the ears of more than just Stanford stu
dents. In 1983, when Queen Elizabeth visited
campus, the Band played a Barnes original — a
simultaneous combination of two national an
thems.
"This was a funny situation because every
body in the Band had to have a picture ID on
their lapel. And the street up to the president's
house was lined with secret service men at like
every 10 feet. The security was so tight, and
understandably so, but it was just sort of
James Bondish," Barnes recalled. "And I don't
know why we got invited to play. It seemed
reasonable to have the Band play. So we
played 'God Save the Queen' and 'The Star
Spangled Banner' both at the same time. We
solved a musical problem there by putting two
tunes together."
Barnes said he is using the same tactic in an
arrangement he is preparing for this year's Big
Game pre-show in which the UC-Berkeley and
Stanford Bands will play the national anthem
together. "Well, our Band absolutely refused to
play our anthem with the Cal band, and I don't
think the Cal band really wanted to play it any
ways. So I said, let me write another arrange
ment. I've written the national anthem in a
pretty traditional arrangement, but starting

around the middle, I introduce at the same time
'America the Beautiful.' We shoved those two
pieces together. It's sort of a musical conun
drum."
M hile he hopes this year's show
will be memorable, Barnes
already has a pile of unforget
table Big Game memories.
One year "one of our band members registered
with the Cal band for their pre-band season and
got a uniform, went to the practices before
school started and then left and went back to
Stanford with the uniform. We used the uni
form in a show that year — that's classic."
While he has written almost every piece
heard at a Stanford football game since 1963, his
most well-known arrangement may be one he
originally thought could be a disaster — "All
Right Now."
"Remember in the '60s there were a lot of
things that the University got rid of tradition
wise. ... Most of the school songs were
trashed or eliminated. There were a lot of tra
ditional things that were just nixed. And in the
vacuum there doesn't seem to be very much to
take their place. 'All Right Now' was one of
those things that was brought up. And at the
time, of course, that was one of the popular
tunes of the day. Fortunately, most of the
alumni don't know the words. The words are

a little X-rated."
In addition to arranging music for the "zoo
band," Barnes has also served as faculty adviser,
and occasional disciplinarian, to the unruly
group. "The Band has changed in the same way
that the undergraduate student body has
changed — more conservative. Not in the
music they play but in the kind of people they
are," Barnes observed. "There's a feeling that
there's a tradition of outrageousness. And for
the context we're in perhaps there is, but if you
look at the past history of the Band, the Band is
more conservative than it was. It doesn't do as
many outrageous things — like really illegal,
outrageous things.
"But neither does the undergraduate student
body at Stanford. We don't have people climb
ing up and down the outside of Hoover Tower.
We used to have that," he laughed. "That's out
rageous— and probably illegal."
As for University attempts to control the
Band, Barnes said they are eternal. While he
himself doesn't try to discourage the natural
lawlessness of the Band, he added that he occa
sionally is forced to act as lawman. "Once in a
while something happens and then I have to
take action. Like kick the person out, or report
him to the dean of students, or to Marv Her
rington, the chief of police. He knows about the
Band — he's been in place for a long time."
rhe reunion this past homecoming
was a reminder to Barnes of the im
portance of the Stanford Band.
"This was a real love fest. I'm still
oasiang in the warmth and glow of the whole
operation.
"It was a sit-down dinner with wine on the
table and the Band going, a catered dinner. Sev
eral of the people who came back... were like
'This is the Stanford Band. What had hap
pened?' because it was a very, very classy opera
tion and it stayed that way right through the
whole dinner. And I saw a lot of people I hadn't
seen for a long time. A lot of people saw a lot of
people that they hadn't seen for a long time.
People came from all over the world. They came
from Europe, a couple came from Japan, and
that says a lot."
Barnes said he sees no special direction for
the Band to head in; he just wants it to reflect the
student body. "You know when I first came
here, you couldn't be in Band and be in a frater
nity. There was that wide a wedge between the
two groups. But the Band was really a collection
of a lot of peripheral people who were out there,
who were not part of the core student body — a
lot of misfits who didn't get along with any
body. It has always sort ofbeen the fraternity for
those who didn't want to be in a fraternity or
who couldn't afford to be in a fraternity, a big
glean of people who became friends just by
being together all the time."
Barnes said he feels like a part of the Band
family, and although he is officially retiring this
year he will remain here teaching, directing and
arranging music for at least another four years.
"Bam, immediately I think of the Band.
That's where I met all the people I really
know.... By about the middle '60s, it was very
cool to be in the Band, and to me the Band was
then, and still is, a slice of the student body you
don't have to afford to be a part of. And to leave
... just wouldn't be that much fun." ■

A 30-year tenure as Stanford's director of bands has given Arthur Barnes a means to
Judge both the music and the character of the student body. His evaluation: "More con
servative."
ct. 2 was a memorable day for Stan-
M ford students — noteworthy because
m of our football team's disappointing
loss to Notre Dame, the mobs of
alumni here for Homecoming, and the first full
student section of the year.
But perhaps even more amazing were the
hundreds of former members of the Leland
Stanford Junior (pause) University Marching
Band sporting identical red and white T-shirts.
Yes, the Band almost — but not quite —
looked like a cohesive group of musicians.
The occasion was not only the official Stan
ford Band reunion, but also the 30th anniver
sary of the legendary Arthur Barnes' arrival on
the Farm. And the commemoration of that an
niversary in caricature on the Band's T-shirts is
quite possibly the closest thing the Stanford
Band has ever had to a uniform.
Barnes, Stanford's director of bands and a
professor of musical theory, is the man behind
the musical arrangements of both the Stanford
Symphonic Band and what is commonly
known as "the zoo band." His creations have
been heard at almost every athletic event since
the faH of 1963.
But way back then, he was just another grad
student, taking classes half-time and working
with campus musical groups — some of whom
did not appreciate his arrival.
In an interesting twist of fate, the Stanford
Band banned themselves from the football field,
striking for two games in protest of the dis
missal of Barnes' predecessor. But Barnes
quickly shrugged off these difficult beginnings,
introducing a new version of the "Star-Span
gled Banner" which earned him the devotion
and respect of both Bands' members.
"This piece specifically was arranged for the
Fresno State College Band when I was teaching
there. I wanted to do something different,"
Barnes said. "We had been in the past playing all
night games, and at that moment in the pre
game, with the spotlight on the flag, we played
the national anthem and I thought 'Geez, put
the spotlight on the flag and turn off all the
lights and we've really got a captive audience.
They can't move.'
"I figured 'We're not going to be able to see
any music. So we'll have to memorize it.' Well,
one way to memorize it is to only memorize half
of it. The first half is played by a lone, solo trum
pet. This was borne out of necessity. It just
worked out that way, and then we only had to
memorize the few notes that were left."
ince conducting the Band in its first
W performance of his version of "The
Star-Spangled Banner," Barnes has
directed both Stanford bands as well
as arranging pieces for sale and working with
off-campus Bay Area groups such as the El
Camino Youth Symphony and the Livermore
Symphony.
While he arranges most of the groups'
music, Barnes said he utilizes varying degrees of
student input. "There's no special direction for
the Symphonic Band, although we play the kind
of music we play. Just like there's no special di
rection for the orchestra or chorus — just to do
good music well.
"As far as the outdoor band goes, they pick
the music exclusively. And what usually hap
pens ... is they'll bring me a cassette tape of

music they want to have arranged. We never
buy any music; we write everything we play."

more conservative than it was. It doesn't do as
many outrageous things — like really illegal,
outrageous things.
"But neither does the undergraduate student
body at Stanford. We don't have people climb
ing up and down the outside of Hoover Tower.
We used to have that," he laughed. "That's out
rageous— and probably illegal."
As for University attempts to control the
Band, Barnes said they are eternal. While he
himself doesn't try to discourage the natural
lawlessness of the Band, he added that he occa
sionally is forced to act as lawman. "Once in a
while something happens and then I have to
take action. Like kick the person out, or report
him to the dean of students, or to Marv Her
rington, the chief of police. He knows about the
Band — he's been in place for a long time."
rhe reunion this past homecoming
was a reminder to Barnes of the im
portance of the Stanford Band.
"This was a real love fest. I'm still
oasiang in the warmth and glow of the whole
operation.
"It was a sit-down dinner with wine on the
table and the Band going, a catered dinner. Sev
eral of the people who came back... were like
'This is the Stanford Band. What had hap
pened?' because it was a very, very classy opera
tion and it stayed that way right through the
whole dinner. And I saw a lot of people I hadn't
seen for a long time. A lot of people saw a lot of
people that they hadn't seen for a long time.
People came from all over the world. They came
from Europe, a couple came from Japan, and
that says a lot."
Barnes said he sees no special direction for
the Band to head in; he just wants it to reflect the
student body. "You know when I first came
here, you couldn't be in Band and be in a frater
nity. There was that wide a wedge between the
two groups. But the Band was really a collection
of a lot of peripheral people who were out there,
who were not part of the core student body — a
lot of misfits who didn't get along with any
body. It has always sort ofbeen the fraternity for
those who didn't want to be in a fraternity or
who couldn't afford to be in a fraternity, a big
glean of people who became friends just by
being together all the time."
Barnes said he feels like a part of the Band
family, and although he is officially retiring this
year he will remain here teaching, directing and
arranging music for at least another four years.
"Bam, immediately I think of the Band.
That's where I met all the people I really
know.... By about the middle '60s, it was very
cool to be in the Band, and to me the Band was
then, and still is, a slice of the student body you
don't have to afford to be a part of. And to leave
... just wouldn't be that much fun." ■

A 30-year tenure as Stanford's director of bands has given Arthur Barnes a means to
Judge both the music and the character of the student body. His evaluation: "More con
servative."
ct. 2 was a memorable day for Stan-
M ford students — noteworthy because
m of our football team's disappointing
loss to Notre Dame, the mobs of
alumni here for Homecoming, and the first full
student section of the year.
But perhaps even more amazing were the
hundreds of former members of the Leland
Stanford Junior (pause) University Marching
Band sporting identical red and white T-shirts.
Yes, the Band almost — but not quite —
looked like a cohesive group of musicians.
The occasion was not only the official Stan
ford Band reunion, but also the 30th anniver
sary of the legendary Arthur Barnes' arrival on
the Farm. And the commemoration of that an
niversary in caricature on the Band's T-shirts is
quite possibly the closest thing the Stanford
Band has ever had to a uniform.
Barnes, Stanford's director of bands and a
professor of musical theory, is the man behind
the musical arrangements of both the Stanford
Symphonic Band and what is commonly
known as "the zoo band." His creations have
been heard at almost every athletic event since
the faH of 1963.
But way back then, he was just another grad
student, taking classes half-time and working
with campus musical groups — some of whom
did not appreciate his arrival.
In an interesting twist of fate, the Stanford
Band banned themselves from the football field,
striking for two games in protest of the dis
missal of Barnes' predecessor. But Barnes
quickly shrugged off these difficult beginnings,
introducing a new version of the "Star-Span
gled Banner" which earned him the devotion
and respect of both Bands' members.
"This piece specifically was arranged for the
Fresno State College Band when I was teaching
there. I wanted to do something different,"
Barnes said. "We had been in the past playing all
night games, and at that moment in the pre
game, with the spotlight on the flag, we played
the national anthem and I thought 'Geez, put
the spotlight on the flag and turn off all the
lights and we've really got a captive audience.
They can't move.'
"I figured 'We're not going to be able to see
any music. So we'll have to memorize it.' Well,
one way to memorize it is to only memorize half
of it. The first half is played by a lone, solo trum
pet. This was borne out of necessity. It just
worked out that way, and then we only had to
memorize the few notes that were left."
ince conducting the Band in its first
W performance of his version of "The
Star-Spangled Banner," Barnes has
directed both Stanford bands as well
as arranging pieces for sale and working with
off-campus Bay Area groups such as the El
Camino Youth Symphony and the Livermore
Symphony.
While he arranges most of the groups'
music, Barnes said he utilizes varying degrees of
student input. "There's no special direction for
the Symphonic Band, although we play the kind
of music we play. Just like there's no special di
rection for the orchestra or chorus — just to do
good music well.
"As far as the outdoor band goes, they pick
the music exclusively. And what usually hap
pens ... is they'll bring me a cassette tape of

music they want to have arranged. We never
buy any music; we write everything we play."
Some of Barnes* arrangements have awak
ened the ears of more than just Stanford stu
dents. In 1983, when Queen Elizabeth visited
campus, the Band played a Barnes original — a
simultaneous combination of two national an
thems.
"This was a funny situation because every
body in the Band had to have a picture ID on
their lapel. And the street up to the president's
house was lined with secret service men at like
every 10 feet. The security was so tight, and
understandably so, but it was just sort of
James Bondish," Barnes recalled. "And I don't
know why we got invited to play. It seemed
reasonable to have the Band play. So we
played 'God Save the Queen' and 'The Star
Spangled Banner' both at the same time. We
solved a musical problem there by putting two
tunes together."
Barnes said he is using the same tactic in an
arrangement he is preparing for this year's Big
Game pre-show in which the UC-Berkeley and
Stanford Bands will play the national anthem
together. "Well, our Band absolutely refused to
play our anthem with the Cal band, and I don't
think the Cal band really wanted to play it any
ways. So I said, let me write another arrange
ment. I've written the national anthem in a
pretty traditional arrangement, but starting

around the middle, I introduce at the same time
'America the Beautiful.' We shoved those two
pieces together. It's sort of a musical conun
drum."
M hile he hopes this year's show
will be memorable, Barnes
already has a pile of unforget
table Big Game memories.
One year "one of our band members registered
with the Cal band for their pre-band season and
got a uniform, went to the practices before
school started and then left and went back to
Stanford with the uniform. We used the uni
form in a show that year — that's classic."
While he has written almost every piece
heard at a Stanford football game since 1963, his
most well-known arrangement may be one he
originally thought could be a disaster — "All
Right Now."
"Remember in the '60s there were a lot of
things that the University got rid of tradition
wise. ... Most of the school songs were
trashed or eliminated. There were a lot of tra
ditional things that were just nixed. And in the
vacuum there doesn't seem to be very much to
take their place. 'All Right Now' was one of
those things that was brought up. And at the
time, of course, that was one of the popular
tunes of the day. Fortunately, most of the
alumni don't know the words. The words are

a little X-rated."
In addition to arranging music for the "zoo
band," Barnes has also served as faculty adviser,
and occasional disciplinarian, to the unruly
group. "The Band has changed in the same way
that the undergraduate student body has
changed — more conservative. Not in the
music they play but in the kind of people they
are," Barnes observed. "There's a feeling that
there's a tradition of outrageousness. And for
the context we're in perhaps there is, but if you
look at the past history of the Band, the Band is
more conservative than it was. It doesn't do as
many outrageous things — like really illegal,
outrageous things.
"But neither does the undergraduate student
