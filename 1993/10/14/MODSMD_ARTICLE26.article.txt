# Night of the living
## D.A.I.S.Y. De La Soul 
### Cheo H. Coker 
/t's funny how small, seemingly random oc
currences have a way of forever altering the
course of your life.
One summer morning in 1989, the cable
tuner landed on Ralph McDaniel's Video
Music Box after five minutes of furious channel
surfing. Instead of another repeated showing of
Rakim's "Microphone Fiend" a video press kit
for a new group named De La Soul flickered on
the screen. Safe to say, these guys were different
than anything I had ever seen before.
"Transmitting Live From Mars," these nigs
exhumed individuality. Instead of MC or DJ
whatever, they had monikers like Posdnous
("Sop Sound" spelled backwards), Trugoy the
Dove ("Yogurt" backwards, his favorite food
and "Dove" for his reserved nature) and Pace
master Mase.
In an era where real New York hip-hop kids
wore fat gold chains, Fila Track suits, rasta
style Kangols and fake Louis Vuitton/Gucci
wear from a phat uptown boutique named
Dapper Dans, these guys donned faded jeans,
dreads and flower-print shirts. While others
were throwin' up 9 mms and empty, cartoon
character boasts, these "Hip-Hop Hippies"
from Amityville, Long Island were expound
ing the D.A.I.S.Y. (Da Inna Sound Y'all) Age.
With inventive samples, and an insular "style
of speak", they brought a completely different
perspective to rap — where individuality was
more important than fitting in with the
crowd.
"I can make a funky break out of anything,"
boasts De La producer and shadow member
Prince Paul when asked during the program to
explain the group's "inner sound." He reaches
for a Mickey Mouse record, the kind of thing 5-
year-olds play on those corny-ass Fisher Price
record players, and momentarily holds it up to
the camera. Two seconds after the needle hits
the scratchy vinyl, my ears are bombarded by
one of the hardest beats I've ever heard before
or since. The volume on the set is relatively low,
but to my eager ears, it resounds louder than a
bomb.
My previously solid musical foundation is
rocked to its very core. Rap music, an artform
that previously felt as familiar as a favorite pair
of Girbauds, suddenly unraveled at the seams
and I was left trying to cover my privates before
the waistline of my pants joined my ankles.
To this day, I can't remember the five min
utes I spent between dazed confusion and final
coherence.
I was soon determined to re-educate myself.
The possibilities were suddenly endless. I went
straight from the front of the set to my uncle's
record room, eager to find more breaks that
could tell me where rap was going now that the
James Brown era of sampling was thankfully
laid to rest.
Like a whole generation of listeners, I was
hand-led down a D.A.1.5.Y.-lined meadow
where I would later encounter a "Tribe" of beat
junkies on a perpetual "Quest" for the bridge
between jazz and rap fusiotb three brothers
from the "Jungle" who were convinced Africa
is a state of mind, and two outcast w Sheep" con-1
tent to graze silently amid the mainstream's
confusion. The Native Tongues Posse loomed
like a storm cloud, and rap music is not only
wet from the torrential downpour of talent, but
is still caught out there without an umbrella.

"Fuck being hard / Posdnous is complicated.
— Posdnous in "In The Woods"
"I just feel music today has no thought,"
says a reserved-yet-intense Posdnous at the be
ginning of our 45-minute conversation at
Tommy Boy Records' comfortable midtown
Manhattan digs.
Four years and three albums later, the magic
surrounding the group still hasn't faded, and
even now I get flashes from that influential Sat
urday afternoon that changed the musical di
rection of my young life. The bespectacled
young rapper, sporting a red Conart T-shirt

and six-inch afro, looks and acts

much more seasoned
than his 23 years

would lead one
to believe. Re-

garded as the
group's most
pragmatic
member,
Kelvin Mer-

cer has ma
ture d
quickly in
this cut-

throat rap
game, es
pecially
since he
be -

longs
to a

group
that has
gone

through
myriad
musical
and image
conscious

changes.
"It's all
about being en-

raged," he explains,

"and if you're not justifying
your rage, you're justifying

something that's already been justified 40 bil
lion times." He shifts a bit in his chair, moving
slightly closer to the tape recorder. "I do feel as
if some artists take it overboard, cause now it's
to the point where people are like 'it's about
being real and being hard.' Tp me that's being
crossovier» cause It'ltheshit to be underground.
Every rapper how ts like, Tm street* I'm a
hood, I'm from under the sewer.' Fuck all that
being hard, I guess I'm complicated, cause you
can't understand where we're coming from,
and the only level others are on is this whole
realm of thoughtless rap that's really taking

ov?r."
From the first time they dropped funky dit
ties like "Plug Tunin," "Potholes In My Lawn"
and "Me, Myself, and I", De La Soul has made
it their business to shatter all previous conven
tions. The most imaginative record in the his
tory of a consistently innovative genre, their
debut "3 Feet High and Rising," revolutionized
digital sampling, showing that any sound could
be regurgitated and transformed into the latest
street chic.
Johnny Cash, Otis Redding and Cymande
ended up getting downloaded and fused with
The Turtles, Liberace and Sly Stone, making
the cryptic term "sonic collage" a funky, con
crete reality. Their popular new sound, cou-

pled with flowery imagery and a lack
of violent, mysogenist lyrics,

made them crossover and
media darlings, but en
dangered their hard-

core street credibility.
With "De La Soul Is
Dead," their bril-

liant-yet-much
slept-on sopho
more effort,

they "killed"
them-

selves

112 and
their

previous

image, coming
back with a harder

edged, heavier sound
that regained them their

underground respect, yet

alienated more superficial
i i* i • i j

fans and resulted in less than
stellar sales. They soon faded

into relative obscurity, seemingly doomed to
take a backseat in a genre that's quick to recog
nize geniuses and even quicker to retire them.
With "Buhloone Mindstate," their third and
latest record, De La Soul has re-emerged as a
strong musical force, proving that they only get
more imaginative with age. Similar to Spike
Lee'* masterful "Do The Right Thing* when
compared to his spotty second movie "School
Daze," it's usually with their third effort that
many artists regain the focus that allowed them
to become household names in the first place.
With all the pressures and inflated expectations

gone, De La Soul has looked inward and dis
covered the wellspring from which all their cre
ative energy is derived anyway — the soul.
"I consider this record the perfect balance
between the first and second," replies Pos when
asked about the driving forces behind this new
born. " 'Buhloone Mindstate' means expand
ing the mind, as in us expanding our minds and
just taking new concepts that much further.
This album came from inside the group, on
how we learned to deal with certain faults in
volved with this business. Our mindframe was
back on trying to do something experimental,
having fun and getting a lot done."
"Most of the time we're trying to get back to
those days where we made our music in the
basement, because creating is the most exciting
part for us" explains Trugoy (aka David Joli
couer) in a later conversation from Mase's
house. "With this album we just went into the
studio and did as we felt. We just said, 'Let's go
in and do it. Experiment with some live instru
ments and some jazz.' With ["De La Soul Is
Dead"] we had to consciously live up to the De
La Soul name and the meaning of the first
record, and this one was about relaxation and
going in to have a good time.
"I think it's all about one word and that's
'expression'," he concludes. "Expression of
yourself. Expressing what you feel, instead of
copying the next man."
This new relaxed aura shines bright
throughout "Mindstate." Unfettered even by
their own self-induced high standards, the
group turns out their shortest yet most intro
spective record to date, lending perspective not
only to where they've been, but also to where
they're going.
The mantra that repeats itself throughout
("It might blow up, but it won't go pop") not
only connotes that the group's center will never
burst from lack of ideas, but also that crossover
success isn't a major concern; however, solid,
thought-provoking music is. The laid-back,
fancy free jazz-funk edge of "Patty Duke" (fea
turing The Guru of Gangstarr), the deeply in
trospective "I Am I Be," the innovative "3 Days
Later" and the rollicking "Breakadawn" are
only a few measures of proof that the group will
seldom fall back on previously charted territo
ry to accomplish their whimsical musical goals.
"I think [our variety of musical sources] is
why we are so special. It ain't all about jazz,
country, funk, blues, it's all about everything,"
explains Pos excitedly. "That's the way, musi
cally, we will continue to make records. It's just
about anything we can bring together. I mean,
if it's banging on a table and humming, if it
sounds good, to us that's what really counts."
Silent until the end, however it's Maseo, the
group's most quiet and seldom-interviewed
member, who brings the most informed per
spective about the group's past and continued
influence.
"A lot of brothers are just afraid to go and be
different. And it's not so much that; it's just
about being yourself. There was a time when
everyone considered us nerds, and now every
one wants to be like us. I'm ftlst glad that we
were the group to give some people enough
courage to say, 'let me do it my way.' "
After birth, death and blissful reincarnation,
their spirit remains the same. No more, no less,
three's still the magic number. ■

different. And it's not so much that; it's just

/t's funny how small, seemingly random oc
currences have a way of forever altering the
course of your life.
One summer morning in 1989, the cable
tuner landed on Ralph McDaniel's Video
Music Box after five minutes of furious channel
surfing. Instead of another repeated showing of
Rakim's "Microphone Fiend" a video press kit
for a new group named De La Soul flickered on
the screen. Safe to say, these guys were different
than anything I had ever seen before.
"Transmitting Live From Mars," these nigs
exhumed individuality. Instead of MC or DJ
whatever, they had monikers like Posdnous
("Sop Sound" spelled backwards), Trugoy the
Dove ("Yogurt" backwards, his favorite food
and "Dove" for his reserved nature) and Pace
master Mase.
In an era where real New York hip-hop kids
wore fat gold chains, Fila Track suits, rasta
style Kangols and fake Louis Vuitton/Gucci
wear from a phat uptown boutique named
Dapper Dans, these guys donned faded jeans,
dreads and flower-print shirts. While others
were throwin' up 9 mms and empty, cartoon
character boasts, these "Hip-Hop Hippies"
from Amityville, Long Island were expound
ing the D.A.I.S.Y. (Da Inna Sound Y'all) Age.
With inventive samples, and an insular "style
of speak", they brought a completely different
perspective to rap — where individuality was
more important than fitting in with the
crowd.
"I can make a funky break out of anything,"
boasts De La producer and shadow member
Prince Paul when asked during the program to
explain the group's "inner sound." He reaches
for a Mickey Mouse record, the kind of thing 5-
year-olds play on those corny-ass Fisher Price
record players, and momentarily holds it up to
the camera. Two seconds after the needle hits
the scratchy vinyl, my ears are bombarded by
one of the hardest beats I've ever heard before
or since. The volume on the set is relatively low,
but to my eager ears, it resounds louder than a
bomb.
My previously solid musical foundation is
rocked to its very core. Rap music, an artform
that previously felt as familiar as a favorite pair
of Girbauds, suddenly unraveled at the seams
and I was left trying to cover my privates before
the waistline of my pants joined my ankles.
To this day, I can't remember the five min
utes I spent between dazed confusion and final
coherence.
I was soon determined to re-educate myself.
The possibilities were suddenly endless. I went
straight from the front of the set to my uncle's
record room, eager to find more breaks that
could tell me where rap was going now that the
James Brown era of sampling was thankfully
laid to rest.
Like a whole generation of listeners, I was
hand-led down a D.A.1.5.Y.-lined meadow
where I would later encounter a "Tribe" of beat
junkies on a perpetual "Quest" for the bridge
between jazz and rap fusiotb three brothers
from the "Jungle" who were convinced Africa
is a state of mind, and two outcast w Sheep" con-1
tent to graze silently amid the mainstream's
confusion. The Native Tongues Posse loomed
like a storm cloud, and rap music is not only
wet from the torrential downpour of talent, but
is still caught out there without an umbrella.

"Fuck being hard / Posdnous is complicated.
— Posdnous in "In The Woods"
"I just feel music today has no thought,"
says a reserved-yet-intense Posdnous at the be
ginning of our 45-minute conversation at
Tommy Boy Records' comfortable midtown
Manhattan digs.
Four years and three albums later, the magic
surrounding the group still hasn't faded, and
even now I get flashes from that influential Sat
urday afternoon that changed the musical di
rection of my young life. The bespectacled
young rapper, sporting a red Conart T-shirt

and six-inch afro, looks and acts

much more seasoned
than his 23 years

would lead one
to believe. Re-

garded as the
group's most
pragmatic
member,
Kelvin Mer-

cer has ma
ture d
quickly in
this cut-

throat rap
game, es
pecially
since he
be -

longs
to a

group
that has
gone

through
myriad
musical
and image
conscious

changes.
"It's all
about being en-

raged," he explains,

"and if you're not justifying
your rage, you're justifying

something that's already been justified 40 bil
lion times." He shifts a bit in his chair, moving
slightly closer to the tape recorder. "I do feel as
if some artists take it overboard, cause now it's
to the point where people are like 'it's about
being real and being hard.' Tp me that's being
crossovier» cause It'ltheshit to be underground.
Every rapper how ts like, Tm street* I'm a
hood, I'm from under the sewer.' Fuck all that
being hard, I guess I'm complicated, cause you
can't understand where we're coming from,
and the only level others are on is this whole
realm of thoughtless rap that's really taking

ov?r."
From the first time they dropped funky dit
ties like "Plug Tunin," "Potholes In My Lawn"
and "Me, Myself, and I", De La Soul has made
it their business to shatter all previous conven
tions. The most imaginative record in the his
tory of a consistently innovative genre, their
debut "3 Feet High and Rising," revolutionized
digital sampling, showing that any sound could
be regurgitated and transformed into the latest
street chic.
Johnny Cash, Otis Redding and Cymande
ended up getting downloaded and fused with
The Turtles, Liberace and Sly Stone, making
the cryptic term "sonic collage" a funky, con
crete reality. Their popular new sound, cou-

pled with flowery imagery and a lack
of violent, mysogenist lyrics,

made them crossover and
media darlings, but en
dangered their hard-

core street credibility.
With "De La Soul Is
Dead," their bril-

liant-yet-much
slept-on sopho
more effort,

they "killed"
them-

selves

112 and
their

previous

image, coming
back with a harder

edged, heavier sound
that regained them their

underground respect, yet

alienated more superficial
i i* i • i j

fans and resulted in less than
stellar sales. They soon faded

into relative obscurity, seemingly doomed to
take a backseat in a genre that's quick to recog
nize geniuses and even quicker to retire them.
With "Buhloone Mindstate," their third and
latest record, De La Soul has re-emerged as a
strong musical force, proving that they only get
more imaginative with age. Similar to Spike
Lee'* masterful "Do The Right Thing* when
compared to his spotty second movie "School
Daze," it's usually with their third effort that
many artists regain the focus that allowed them
to become household names in the first place.
With all the pressures and inflated expectations

gone, De La Soul has looked inward and dis
covered the wellspring from which all their cre
ative energy is derived anyway — the soul.
"I consider this record the perfect balance
between the first and second," replies Pos when
asked about the driving forces behind this new
born. " 'Buhloone Mindstate' means expand
ing the mind, as in us expanding our minds and
just taking new concepts that much further.
This album came from inside the group, on
how we learned to deal with certain faults in
volved with this business. Our mindframe was
back on trying to do something experimental,
having fun and getting a lot done."
"Most of the time we're trying to get back to
those days where we made our music in the
basement, because creating is the most exciting
part for us" explains Trugoy (aka David Joli
couer) in a later conversation from Mase's
house. "With this album we just went into the
studio and did as we felt. We just said, 'Let's go
in and do it. Experiment with some live instru
ments and some jazz.' With ["De La Soul Is
Dead"] we had to consciously live up to the De
La Soul name and the meaning of the first
record, and this one was about relaxation and
going in to have a good time.
"I think it's all about one word and that's
'expression'," he concludes. "Expression of
yourself. Expressing what you feel, instead of
copying the next man."
This new relaxed aura shines bright
throughout "Mindstate." Unfettered even by
their own self-induced high standards, the
group turns out their shortest yet most intro
spective record to date, lending perspective not
only to where they've been, but also to where
they're going.
The mantra that repeats itself throughout
("It might blow up, but it won't go pop") not
only connotes that the group's center will never
burst from lack of ideas, but also that crossover
success isn't a major concern; however, solid,
thought-provoking music is. The laid-back,
fancy free jazz-funk edge of "Patty Duke" (fea
turing The Guru of Gangstarr), the deeply in
trospective "I Am I Be," the innovative "3 Days
Later" and the rollicking "Breakadawn" are
only a few measures of proof that the group will
seldom fall back on previously charted territo
ry to accomplish their whimsical musical goals.
"I think [our variety of musical sources] is
why we are so special. It ain't all about jazz,
country, funk, blues, it's all about everything,"
explains Pos excitedly. "That's the way, musi
cally, we will continue to make records. It's just
about anything we can bring together. I mean,
if it's banging on a table and humming, if it
sounds good, to us that's what really counts."
Silent until the end, however it's Maseo, the
group's most quiet and seldom-interviewed
member, who brings the most informed per

Later" and the rollicking "Breakadawn" are

seldom fall back on previously charted territo
ry to accomplish their whimsical musical goals.
"I think [our variety of musical sources] is
why we are so special. It ain't all about jazz,
country, funk, blues, it's all about everything,"
explains Pos excitedly. "That's the way, musi
cally, we will continue to make records. It's just
about anything we can bring together. I mean,
if it's banging on a table and humming, if it
sounds good, to us that's what really counts."
Silent until the end, however it's Maseo, the
group's most quiet and seldom-interviewed
member, who brings the most informed per
spective about the group's past and continued
influence.
"A lot of brothers are just afraid to go and be
different. And it's not so much that; it's just
about being yourself. There was a time when
everyone considered us nerds, and now every
one wants to be like us. I'm ftlst glad that we
were the group to give some people enough
courage to say, 'let me do it my way.' "
After birth, death and blissful reincarnation,
their spirit remains the same. No more, no less,

/t's funny how small, seemingly random oc
currences have a way of forever altering the
course of your life.
One summer morning in 1989, the cable
tuner landed on Ralph McDaniel's Video
Music Box after five minutes of furious channel
surfing. Instead of another repeated showing of
Rakim's "Microphone Fiend" a video press kit
for a new group named De La Soul flickered on
the screen. Safe to say, these guys were different
than anything I had ever seen before.
"Transmitting Live From Mars," these nigs
exhumed individuality. Instead of MC or DJ
whatever, they had monikers like Posdnous
("Sop Sound" spelled backwards), Trugoy the
Dove ("Yogurt" backwards, his favorite food
and "Dove" for his reserved nature) and Pace
master Mase.
In an era where real New York hip-hop kids
wore fat gold chains, Fila Track suits, rasta
style Kangols and fake Louis Vuitton/Gucci
wear from a phat uptown boutique named
Dapper Dans, these guys donned faded jeans,
dreads and flower-print shirts. While others
were throwin' up 9 mms and empty, cartoon
character boasts, these "Hip-Hop Hippies"
from Amityville, Long Island were expound
ing the D.A.I.S.Y. (Da Inna Sound Y'all) Age.
With inventive samples, and an insular "style
of speak", they brought a completely different
perspective to rap — where individuality was
more important than fitting in with the
crowd.
"I can make a funky break out of anything,"
boasts De La producer and shadow member
Prince Paul when asked during the program to
explain the group's "inner sound." He reaches
for a Mickey Mouse record, the kind of thing 5-
year-olds play on those corny-ass Fisher Price
record players, and momentarily holds it up to
the camera. Two seconds after the needle hits
the scratchy vinyl, my ears are bombarded by
one of the hardest beats I've ever heard before
or since. The volume on the set is relatively low,
but to my eager ears, it resounds louder than a
bomb.
My previously solid musical foundation is
rocked to its very core. Rap music, an artform
that previously felt as familiar as a favorite pair
of Girbauds, suddenly unraveled at the seams
and I was left trying to cover my privates before
the waistline of my pants joined my ankles.
To this day, I can't remember the five min
utes I spent between dazed confusion and final
coherence.
I was soon determined to re-educate myself.
The possibilities were suddenly endless. I went
straight from the front of the set to my uncle's
record room, eager to find more breaks that
could tell me where rap was going now that the
James Brown era of sampling was thankfully
laid to rest.
Like a whole generation of listeners, I was
hand-led down a D.A.1.5.Y.-lined meadow
where I would later encounter a "Tribe" of beat
junkies on a perpetual "Quest" for the bridge
between jazz and rap fusiotb three brothers
from the "Jungle" who were convinced Africa
is a state of mind, and two outcast w Sheep" con-1
tent to graze silently amid the mainstream's
confusion. The Native Tongues Posse loomed
like a storm cloud, and rap music is not only
wet from the torrential downpour of talent, but
is still caught out there without an umbrella.

"Fuck being hard / Posdnous is complicated.
— Posdnous in "In The Woods"
"I just feel music today has no thought,"
says a reserved-yet-intense Posdnous at the be
ginning of our 45-minute conversation at
Tommy Boy Records' comfortable midtown
Manhattan digs.
Four years and three albums later, the magic
surrounding the group still hasn't faded, and
even now I get flashes from that influential Sat
urday afternoon that changed the musical di
rection of my young life. The bespectacled
young rapper, sporting a red Conart T-shirt

and six-inch afro, looks and acts

much more seasoned
than his 23 years

would lead one
to believe. Re-

garded as the
group's most
pragmatic
member,
Kelvin Mer-

cer has ma
ture d
quickly in
this cut-

throat rap
game, es
pecially
since he
be -

longs
to a

group
that has
gone

through
myriad
musical
and image
conscious

changes.
"It's all
about being en-

raged," he explains,

"and if you're not justifying
your rage, you're justifying

something that's already been justified 40 bil
lion times." He shifts a bit in his chair, moving
slightly closer to the tape recorder. "I do feel as
if some artists take it overboard, cause now it's
to the point where people are like 'it's about
being real and being hard.' Tp me that's being
crossovier» cause It'ltheshit to be underground.
Every rapper how ts like, Tm street* I'm a
hood, I'm from under the sewer.' Fuck all that
being hard, I guess I'm complicated, cause you
can't understand where we're coming from,
and the only level others are on is this whole
realm of thoughtless rap that's really taking

ov?r."
From the first time they dropped funky dit
ties like "Plug Tunin," "Potholes In My Lawn"
and "Me, Myself, and I", De La Soul has made
it their business to shatter all previous conven
tions. The most imaginative record in the his
tory of a consistently innovative genre, their
debut "3 Feet High and Rising," revolutionized
digital sampling, showing that any sound could
be regurgitated and transformed into the latest
street chic.
Johnny Cash, Otis Redding and Cymande
ended up getting downloaded and fused with
The Turtles, Liberace and Sly Stone, making
the cryptic term "sonic collage" a funky, con
crete reality. Their popular new sound, cou-

pled with flowery imagery and a lack
of violent, mysogenist lyrics,

made them crossover and
media darlings, but en
dangered their hard-

core street credibility.
With "De La Soul Is
Dead," their bril-

liant-yet-much
slept-on sopho
more effort,

they "killed"
them-

selves

112 and
their

previous

image, coming
back with a harder

edged, heavier sound
that regained them their

underground respect, yet

alienated more superficial
i i* i • i j

fans and resulted in less than
stellar sales. They soon faded

into relative obscurity, seemingly doomed to
take a backseat in a genre that's quick to recog
nize geniuses and even quicker to retire them.
With "Buhloone Mindstate," their third and
latest record, De La Soul has re-emerged as a
strong musical force, proving that they only get
more imaginative with age. Similar to Spike
Lee'* masterful "Do The Right Thing* when
compared to his spotty second movie "School
Daze," it's usually with their third effort that
many artists regain the focus that allowed them
to become household names in the first place.
With all the pressures and inflated expectations

gone, De La Soul has looked inward and dis
covered the wellspring from which all their cre
ative energy is derived anyway — the soul.
"I consider this record the perfect balance
between the first and second," replies Pos when
asked about the driving forces behind this new
born. " 'Buhloone Mindstate' means expand
ing the mind, as in us expanding our minds and
just taking new concepts that much further.
This album came from inside the group, on
how we learned to deal with certain faults in
volved with this business. Our mindframe was
back on trying to do something experimental,
having fun and getting a lot done."
"Most of the time we're trying to get back to
those days where we made our music in the
basement, because creating is the most exciting
part for us" explains Trugoy (aka David Joli
couer) in a later conversation from Mase's
house. "With this album we just went into the
studio and did as we felt. We just said, 'Let's go
in and do it. Experiment with some live instru
ments and some jazz.' With ["De La Soul Is
Dead"] we had to consciously live up to the De
La Soul name and the meaning of the first
record, and this one was about relaxation and
going in to have a good time.
"I think it's all about one word and that's
'expression'," he concludes. "Expression of
yourself. Expressing what you feel, instead of
copying the next man."
This new relaxed aura shines bright
throughout "Mindstate." Unfettered even by
their own self-induced high standards, the
group turns out their shortest yet most intro
spective record to date, lending perspective not
only to where they've been, but also to where
they're going.
The mantra that repeats itself throughout
("It might blow up, but it won't go pop") not
only connotes that the group's center will never
burst from lack of ideas, but also that crossover
success isn't a major concern; however, solid,
thought-provoking music is. The laid-back,
fancy free jazz-funk edge of "Patty Duke" (fea
turing The Guru of Gangstarr), the deeply in
trospective "I Am I Be," the innovative "3 Days
Later" and the rollicking "Breakadawn" are
only a few measures of proof that the group will
seldom fall back on previously charted territo
ry to accomplish their whimsical musical goals.
