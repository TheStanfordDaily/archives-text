# Addressing the Swing — Wynton Marsalis
## 
### Victor Haseman 
Ever since he was a kid, Wynton
Marsalis knew he wanted to be a jazz
musician. You could blame it on his
father Ellis, a skilled pianist of the bebop tra
dition, who — unlike many of his contempo
raries — found lasting fulfillment as a jazz ed
ucator and as the father and musical mentor
of Wynton and his five brothers.
But Wynton's need to swing and play the
blues originally had much more to do with
the captivating mystique of jazz, the attitude,
the dress, the speak. Duke Ellington was as
stately as Charlie "Yard Bird" Parker was wild
as Miles Davis was cool as the Modern Jazz
Quartet was immaculate as John Coltrane was
introspective as Ornette Coleman was free.
But around 1974, when Wynton knew that
his love for jazz was body and soul, he was dis
couraged to discover that jazz as he knew it
and as his father had known it had moved
onto something more watery and abstract.
"Nobody was playing jazz," Marsalis com
plained. "They were playing this form of jazz
they called fusion. But I knew that wasn't
jazz."
Fusion was and still can be improvisation
ally funky and R&B-ish to the touch. Witness
jazz guitarist George Benson's collaborations
with Quincy Jones throughout the '70s or sax
ophonist Grover Washington's excursions into
pop ballads like "Just the Two of Us." Or later
still the emergence and popularity of groups
like Spyro Gyra, the Yellow Jackets, etc. None
of this was bad, but it wasn't jazz either. Fur
thermore it suggested a general boredom
among younger musicians for straight jazz's
more classical and traditional elements.
"There's two things you have to do to play
jazz," Marsalis confided in between call-wait
ing clicks from his apartment in Manhattan.
"You have to play the blues and also you have
to be swingin' — in that order."
Still it seems odd to say that jazz—consid
ering how we know it today—had all but fall
en off the face of the earth for Marsalis' gener
ation. Not when drummer and band leader
Art Blakey was training his young jazz mes
sengers, not when a number of cats up on vi
braphonist legend Lionel Hampton's band
stand were 30 and younger. Not when bebop
legend Dizzy Gillespie and the Bros. Heath
and Stan Getz and Herbie Hancock busied
themselves with jazz workshops around the
country and world for musicians young and
old. In fact, it was Blakey influence, among
others, who convinced Marsalis that jazz was
alive for musicians his age. But Marsalis knew
he along with his contemporaries would need
to breathe new life into it, if was to eventually
flourish.
"Art Blakey taught me the meaning of
being a musician, giving 150 percent every
night, having respect for the audience. He
taught me the real meaning of jazz music, the
fact that it has a spiritual connection and that
it is about American democracy. 'Jazz is the
highest level of performance on a musical in
strument,' Blakey said. And when he said that

he meant on all levels of musical encounter —
emotional, spiritual and technical."
. This sentiment explains why Marsalis, now
closing in on his 33rd birthday, has consis
tently maintained an intensity about his art
that may very well be unparalleled among
jazz's innovators of the '90s and beyond.
Marsalis said once of the early years with his
first quintet (brother Branford on soprano
and tenor saxophones, Jeff "Tain" Watts on
drums, Kenny Kirkland on piano and Char
nett Moffett on bass) that, "We were trying to
develop a conception that featured group em
pathy, rhythmic give and take. We were trying
to come up with music that addressed the
music of the bands I liked — like Ornette,
Miles and Coltrane."
But the aims of Marsalis' group went far
beyond the boundaries of music. The albums
the quintet recorded were as much a declara
tion of musical intent as a listening experi
ence. "We were fighting for the survival of our
art in our generation," explains Marsalis. "We
were trying to get a band of young musicians
on the road to let the world know that there
were young musicians who really wanted to
play jazz music."
Today, youthful jazz combos are more en
vogue than ever before. So many have sur
faced in the last several years that Marsalis and
his collaborators' interpretations of the blues
and swing feel much older than they should.
His original compositions reference the mas
ters gracefully, without ever feeling like grand
theft. And watching a group under Marsalis'
lead take a stage illuminates this sentiment
with forceful clarity.
Black men, polished musicians at the peak
of their form, their casually serious expres
sions mounted atop crisp Armani suits punc
tuated by outlandish neckties and polished
wingtips ... their body language cries out to
the muses of jazz, "Arrive early, for our busi
ness is most serious" And seldom do the
muses mistake their intentions for anything
that is less than sincere.
Likewise, listening to a Marsalis album is an
entire experience unto itself. Like the record
ings of his forefathers, Davis, Gillespie and
perhaps even Louis Armstrong himself, the
question is never how good or bad, but how
mind-blowing. Brimming with organized dis
sonance, "Black Codes" (from his fourth
album "Black Codes (From the Under
ground)"), swings with all of the elegance of
an Ellington original (say a "Ko-Ko") dedicat
ed to recalling the tribal undercurrents intrin
sic in all black music. Similarly, any of his
"Marsalis Standard Time" volumes make swift
and conclusive arguments for his understand
ing of standard aesthetics. His use of the tried
and true as a launching pad for the contempo
rary and timely rarely misses the mark.
And his string of compositions in the last
three years — "Time in Tomorrow" (an orig
inal soundtrack), the "Soul Gestures in
Southern Blue" volumes one through three,
"Blue Interlude" and most recently "Citi

Movement" (an original score for the Garth
Fagan Dance / Wynton Marsalis Septet collab
oration, "Griot New York") — continue to
show the artistic progression of a musician
who's musical presence hasn't stop expanding i
... yet.
Rolling eight Grammies deep, including
two for his recordings of classical trumpet
solos, it would seem that Marsalis might be far
from the critical reproach of the critical music <
establishment. But, alas, the "Renaissance i
Man," as he was dubbed after winning jazz i
and classical Grammies in the same year, has 1
been criticized at least as much <

as he's been praised.
In the same reviews
that critics have praised

"Citi Movement," many
have also condemned
it. Marsalis' masterful j
arrangements, his apti-

tude for eliciting the very
best from his musicians
and the score's downright

listenability have
wowed many,

but

others say the album's "blind ambition" and
Marsalis' "shameful" regurgitations of Elling
tonian phrases have gotten him written off as
pretentious and pitifully out of touch. Why
else, many wonder, would a musician com
pose a score about one of America's most
provocative cities and fail to reference the in
trinsic ugliness of the metropolis as well?
It's as if critics are most comfortable thinking
of Marsalis as two men: the technically brilliant
musician / improviser and the composer lost in
a musical epoch long past Marsalis has heard
this complaint too many times before — as
early as his first breakthrough records.
... "You

know, there's this swordsman in Japan named
(Miosoto Mufazi), about the 16th century,"
explains a mildly excited Marsalis in a South
ern drawl more mack-daddy slick than back
water country. "He was undefeated in 60-
something bouts. And then, they would fight
to the death, you know? And one of his cardi
nal rules was never trifle with an inferior
enemy."
Not completely satisfied with his parable,
Marsalis leaps back into the fray with, "You
know how they say a bad boxer can make a
good boxer look bad, because they just stand
in the ring and they'll hold you, you know,
just to keep stuff from happening? That's

what a lot of times responding to criticism in
the jazz field is like, because the actual level of
criticism is so low. It's uninformed.
"You don't even know how to respond to it.
It's not something you can get mad at, be
cause criticism is an important part of devel
opment and growth. If you can't deal with
criticism you can't grow. But on the other
hand, how do you respond to something like
that? What do you say to that, 'Sounds like
your samplin' stuff from the past?' "
Absolutely nothing In this case, as in so many
others, musical expression articulates in plainer and
rrrresensfcle "prose" than any fiery rebuttaL Marsalis
first and foremost fancies himself a serious jazz man
and he's got the credentials and the

schedule to

prove it —
not to

mention
the artistry
to flaunt it

That "Qti
Move-

ment"
recalls

Ellington's
"Black, Brown and
Beige" musically can
not be denied But
i whereas Ellington

wishes to summarize
the history of black

America on a 50-minute

112 canvas, Marsalis offers a
danceable, universal interpre
tation of the big city via a tradi
tionally black musicform that
has a swing and feel like no
other popular music But
the differences between the
extended works of "Duke"
and the extended works of
the "Renaissance Man"

vary more than thematically.
Marsalis is a musician who prefers a canvas
of classical jazz to a strictly modern one, not
because he's heavily into emulation but be
cause he's placed little faith in jazz's modern
day hybridizations — and his methods for ad
dressing them are nothing short of belligerent.
Remember that back in the early '80s,
Marsalis and his first band were busying
themselves spreading the word that pure jazz
was not yet dead among musicians of his gen
eration. Hence, he was never concerned with
espousing melodic derivatives he deemed less
than jazz. That was his license for calling out a
Miles Davis who went from "All Blues" to "all
fuse." That's why when brother Branford and
colleague Kirkland collaborated with pop
rocker Sting on "Dream of the Blue Turtles"
and "Nothing Like the Sun," little brother all
but disowned big brother. And that's why he's
had problems with hip-hop, even in its jazzi
er forms.
"The first thing is jazz-rap is just another
creation for the media to latch onto and they
will latch onto like they latch onto every fad.
They don't really respond to things in terms of
what it is as music. They only respond to the
name of something. A form of music is, if
there's a drum and a bass, what the drum and
bass are doing. It's not what a horn player
does on top of it. That's just a basic rule of
rhythm-section music.
"If you go to a gig all night and people are
playing calypso, it's not a jazz band. Now a
jazz band will play maybe a calypso or two.
! But if you go to a gig and the rhythm section
is playing a back-beat all night, it's not a jazz
band. It's either R&B, funk or rock. In hip
hop music, just because somebody plays a 10-
second saxophone solo doesn't make it jazz.
What it is, is hip-hop music with somebody
playing a jazz solo on top of it."
The problem, as Marsalis sees it, is that the
majority of rap artists who layer funk-heavy
jazz loops over hard-hitting yet repetitive
back-beats aren't addressing the jazz's funda
mental elements — playing the blues and the
necessity of swing. Ignore or remove these el
ements and what is left, may be funky and
danceable, but it won't be jazz.
"Very seldom, if ever," maintains an un
flagging Marsalis, "has a rap musician come
to me looking to figure out how to address
jazz music, because the net result is less record
sales." Marsalis definitely has a point.
Freestyle Fellowship's debut album, "Innerci
ty Griots," indulges heavily in jazz-rap exper
imentation with phenomenal success. But at
what price? While Guru's "Jazzmatazz" and
the Digable Planet's "Reachin' (A New Refu
tation of Time and Space)" soared up the
Top-40 charts with oddball molasses of live
instrumentation and traditional beats, "In
nercity" stayed put and out of popular reach,
despite a warm reception from the hip-hop
underground.
"You also have to know something about
the music," continues Marsalis, "and that's

not why people are doing [jazz-rap]. These
combinations don't come out of a need to cre
ate something new, it comes about as the need
to find a way to jump on the pop band wagon
and make some of that money. And it is
cosigned by the fraudulence of the intellectu
al community which surrounds jazz.
"The proof of which is whenever a jazz mu
sician does something that's not jazz, he's cel
ebrated especially if he says it's not jazz. Wit
ness Cecil Taylor, Anthony Braxton, who have
said for years that they don't play jazz, the Art
Ensemble of Chicago who have said for years
that they don't play jazz. Miles Davis, after he
started playing rock music, who repeatedly
said in interviews, he wasn't playing jazz.
"Greg Osby who said he's not playing jazz,
he's playing some rap music or something.
But in the eyes of the jazz people who sup
posedly critique jazz music, and are sup
posed to form some type of intellectual foun
dation, whenever a musician does this, they
then are celebrated as innovators of jazz.
Now this is a level of fraudulence that I really
don't understand. Perhaps you can illumi
nate it for me?"
Even if I could, it's doubtful I'd have the
inclination. As Marsalis himself has noted,
the view of the road from the passenger's side
is drastically different from that of the dri
ver's. He'll normally put up a hand and say,
"Say brotha, straighten' up and drive right,"
only when he feels his life is in some mortal
danger. Otherwise the driving is left to the
cat with the license. Only maybe it would be
better if the driver wasn't always using his li
cense to take the initiative and tell folks when
their driving down roads too difficult or one
way.
Then again, it's not as if he isn't looking out
for his own safety, or in this case his own art.
Who can blame Marsalis. He's on an intellec
tual and artistic high ground trying to pull as
many interested people as he can up to his
vantage point. Maybe that's why he can teach
children the joys of music in the morning, play
gigs in the evening and compose songs of
swing and blues into the wee hours of the
night, only to do it again for days on end with
little time for recuperation in between.
"You know what's going on, man?,"
Marsalis asks almost accusingly. "Everybody
knows. We're celebrating people shooting
people, grabbing people's ass on TV and all of
that. Yeah, you always have a problem trying
to bring something good into the world when
that's going on. When the most money's
being paid to the people who provide the least
for society....
"It's hard to find any culprit, you know
what I'm sayin'? It's just a general attitude that
pervades American life in this latter half of the
20th century.... But the ugliness and the an
griness has always been a part of human life,
in a much greater dose than it is now. And I
am a firm believer that the human will go to
ward sophistication, toward civilization, to
ward beauty — it will prevail." ■
