# A
						deception divine
## 'M. Butterfly,' David Cronenberg's cross-dressing lying game 
### 
Much like its cross-dressing eponymous
character, the story of "M. Butterfly" has two
sides.
The pop-culture interpretation presents a
story of an honest, naive French diplomat de
ceived into kinky, gender-bending sex by a con
niving Chinese freak-of-a-man. Unfortunate

comparisons to "The Crying Game" are in
evitable.
After all, both films portray a white man "se
duced" by an exotic cross-dressing man, while
appearing to exploit the risqu£ titillation of ho
mosexual-yet-not-homosexual sex, under
scored by the enticing question of "How could

he not know his lover was a man?"
Aside from the fact that playwright David
Henry Hwang wrote "M. Butterfly" long before
"The Crying Game" hit cineplexes across the
country, his work — at least in its Intended
form — has very little in common with last
year's surprise hit.
Much to our relief, the film adaptation pre
serves Hwang's scathing social statement on
popular images of Asian women and men with
out resorting to the tabloid appeal of sexual
perversion. This success can be attributed to
Hwang's collaboration on the film (he wrote
the screenplay and was co-executive producer)
and director David Cronenberg's ("Naked
Lunch") insightful ability to see and convey
Hwang's vision.
In the film, Cronenberg and Hwang offer
answers to the obvious and nagging question of
"How could anyone not know for 18 years that
his lover was a man?" through their commen
tary on the white man's conception of the Asian
woman.
The perfect medium for this message lies in
the unexpected yet ingenious decision to cast
John Lone ("The Last Emperor") as Song Lil
ing, a.k.a. "Butterfly." When we first see Lone
— the very picture of Asian action-movie mas
culinity— dressed as a Chinese opera diva, the
fact that French diplomat Rene Gallimard (Je
remy Irons) believes he is a woman is ridicu
lous.
To better convey the socially rooted reasons
behind the successful deception, filmmakers
intentionally left Lone with minimal makeup
and make few attempts to hide his broad shoul
ders and masculine frame.
In the film, as his/her relationship with Gal

limard — sensitively portrayed by Irons — de
velops, we are convinced of Butterfly's ability to
conform to the geisha stereotype and of Galli
mard's overwhelming desire to possess this
"ideal" woman — Gallimard even refers to her
as his "slave." Lone surpasses all bounds of our
imagination as he draws us deeper into the illu
sion of Butterfly with each seductive glance and
toss of his long locks.
Lone's and Iron's outstanding perfor
mances allow us to partially forgive the film's
only real disappointment — the crucial revela
tion scene, in which Gallimard discovers But
terfly is a man.
In the play, this gripping and confrontation
al scene makes us undergo Gallimard's rocky
journey into reality as we see Butterfly slowly
take off his makeup and clothes, confront Gal
limard and then completely undress.
However, "M. Butterfly"'s filmmakers delay
this initial confrontation, first introducing But
terfly as a man to a crowded courtroom in
which Gallimard is seated. The detachment of
Gallimard's discovery destroys the crucial ten
sion of the moment so completely that the later
confrontation seems extraneous and stilted —
not to mention that it foregoes the full frontal
nudity that Hwang originally deemed crucial to
the play (Smells like NC-17).
Nevertheless, the film quickly redeems itself
in a powerful conclusion nearly identical to the
play's that leaves no doubt of Hwang's inten
tions. "M. Butterfly" 's pointed social criticisms
may be a lot harder to swallow than National
Enquirer-esque stories of transvestitism, but
they leave us with a hell of a lot more to think
about
