## Mr. Jones 
### 
"You're a doctor. You can fix my life,
right?"
Maybe. But not even God has much of a
chance fixing "Mr. Jones," a mess mas
querading boldly as a message movie about
manic-depressive disorders and medical
ethics — and, of course, the power of love
which threatens to interfere with them both.
The psychiatrist in question, Dr. Libbie
Bowen (Lena Olin), is, of course, beautiful
and intelligent, complete with a sultry
Swedish accent. And, of course, she turns out
to have more problems than her patient, in
the traditional Hollywood fashion.
Richard Gere is the enigmatic Mr. Jones,
who turns his contagious charms to the max
while his manic cycle is in progress, and —
surprise, surprise — our good doctor

promptly discards
her allegiance to the
Hippocratic Oath
and makes her house
call to Eros Land.
Normally nothing
to find offense with,
surely; except in this
case we simply cease
to care what the con
sequences of this un
lawful liaison are. It is
hard to find a crumb
of sympathy when

the script forces actors to mouth trite confes
sions like "I'm a kid, and I always will be"
while keeping a straight face.
Gere is hardly above blame himself: His
ain't-I-charismatic grin and stereotypical
role seem to have been recycled from his by
gone drifter/dude days in decade-old pics like
"Breathless." In contrast, his waistline has
since expanded to the point where it contant
ly threatens to burst that 35-year-old man
child bubble — especially in the film's nude
bathing scene.
Olin's participation in this project is sig
nificantly less understandable. After impres
sive turns in "The Unbearable Lightness Of
Being" and "Enemies, A Love Story," Olin
now seemed destined to play into Tinsel
town's hands and recreate a Garbo-esque
token of heavily-accented exotica. If nothing
else, she ought to have learned better from
her role in "Havana."
Another talent put to misuse, British di
rector Mike Figgis, the man behind provoca
tive movies such as "Stormy Monday" and
"Internal Affairs," is reduced to ensuring that
Olin produces teardrop after teardrop pre
cisely on cue every time Bowen encounters a
favorite patient or a concerned colleague.
The one bright spot in the film is new
comer Lauren Tom. In a bid to keep the in
tegrity of the psychiatric portrayals in check,
Tom exhibits tremendous promise with her
supporting role as Amanda, a suicidal Asian-
American teenager.
Perhaps Gere and Olin should leave psy

chiatry to those who act as if their lives de
pended on it.
