# Wanted: alumni gifts
## Casper starts direct-appeal effort to increase annual contributions 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Concerned about the small number of
annual alumni donations, Stanford admin
istrators recently began a push for in
creased contributions through direct ap
peals to graduates and a stronger focus on
younger alumni.
University President Gerhard Casper
sent a letter last month to undergraduate
alumni, asking for more gifts to the Annu
al Fund; currently, only 24 percent of un
dergraduate alumni contribute.
"Annual giving is literally the source
that sustains and replenishes Stan
ford. . .. Your gift, in any amount, will
make a difference," Casper wrote.
In the two-page letter, Casper pointed

out that the Annual Fund — which covers
gifts under $50,000 — supports financial
aid, funds library acquisitions and pays for
renovations to Stanford facilities.
"In short, your contributions to the An
nual Fund go to support our most funda
mental objectives," he said in the letter.
In an interview yesterday, Casper said
he thinks "that many alumni believe that
Stanford is a wealthy institution," and
wanted to remind the alumni that it is not.
Casper added that he has received a
number of personal responses to his letter,
but "it's hard to know" this early how
alumni will respond on the donations
front.
