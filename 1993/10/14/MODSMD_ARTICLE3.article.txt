# Wanted: alumni gifts
## Casper starts direct-appeal effort to increase annual contributions 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Concerned about the small number of
annual alumni donations, Stanford admin
istrators recently began a push for in
creased contributions through direct ap
peals to graduates and a stronger focus on
younger alumni.
University President Gerhard Casper
sent a letter last month to undergraduate
alumni, asking for more gifts to the Annu
al Fund; currently, only 24 percent of un
dergraduate alumni contribute.
"Annual giving is literally the source
that sustains and replenishes Stan
ford. . .. Your gift, in any amount, will
make a difference," Casper wrote.
In the two-page letter, Casper pointed

out that the Annual Fund — which covers
gifts under $50,000 — supports financial
aid, funds library acquisitions and pays for
renovations to Stanford facilities.
"In short, your contributions to the An
nual Fund go to support our most funda
mental objectives," he said in the letter.
In an interview yesterday, Casper said
he thinks "that many alumni believe that
Stanford is a wealthy institution," and
wanted to remind the alumni that it is not.
Casper added that he has received a
number of personal responses to his letter,
but "it's hard to know" this early how
alumni will respond on the donations
front.
Stephen Peeps, associate vice president
for development, said the problem
of weak alumni giving is "as old as
Stanford fund raising."
In the past, Peeps said, Stan
ford focused on large alumni con
tributions rather than donations
to the Annual Fund. Last year,
the Annual Fund collected $17.8
million from alumni; all gifts —
including Annual Fund contribu
tions — totaled $182 million.
Donations to the Annual Fund
have been increasing at a reason
able rate, but "we should be doing
a lot better," Peeps said. He
pointed out that Princeton has 55
percent alumni participation in a
similar program.
According to Peeps, Stanford
began to focus on smaller gifts
after Casper took office.
"To his credit, President
Casper saw this [weak contribu
tions] as a problem that we per
haps hadn't (seen)," Peeps said.
"I think when resources [espe
cially from government contracts]
were plentiful, this problem was
[obscured] by how much money
was coming in," Peeps said.
Peeps explained that although
it constitutes only 10 percent of
total donations, the Annual Fund
is important because money given
to it can be used "right away to
meet immediate needs . . . That

kind of I money! is very valuable."
Larger gifts usually go to the
endowment and cannot be spent
immediately, Peeps said.
Alumni Association President
Bill Stone said he is "hopeful that
the percentage lof alumni con
tributing] will go up" in response
to Casper's letter and the recent
alumni homecoming weekend.
The weekend's activities —
modeled after Stanford's popular
Centennial Celebration in 1991
— included special classes taught
by faculty, several seminars and
round table discussions, and a
speech by Hoover Distinguished
Fellow George Shultz.
"We learned that a lot more
alumni would come back if it was
more than just a [dinner party]"
Stone said.
According to Stone, about
6,000 alumni attended, signifi
cantly more than the 3,500 who
came in 1992. Contributions from
those attending "went up sub
stantially," Peeps said.
Alumni weekends with this
format are likely to continue for
at least five years, Stone said.
Peeps said the Office of Devel
opment is also planning to involve
more students in alumni activi
ties. "We want to get more seniors
to volunteer to get pledges [to
donate] from other seniors"
before they graduate, he said.
"We're trying to make it clear
to [students] that a large portion
of their education is subsidized

.... [and they] have an obligation
to pay it back," Peeps continued.
He added that his office will
also focus on recruiting young
alumni.
Stone said the low percentage
of alumni contributions doesn't
mean that graduates are dissatis
fied with Stanford. A poll commis
sioned last year by the Alumni
Association and Development
Office showed that 93 percent of
alumni said they would go to
Stanford if they had to choose
again, and 97 percent called it a
"positive impact" on their lives,
Stone said.
In the past, just raising money
— not necessarily increasing the
percentage of donors — has been
the priority, he explained.
Stone said this emphasis
explains the low alumni satisfac
tion rating U.S. News and World
Report gave Stanford in a recent
issue. The magazine — which
placed Stanford 77th out of 204
"research-oriented" schools in
that category — derives rankings
directly from the percentage of
alumni who donate to their alma
mater.
"I think [that] methodology is
ludicrous," Stone said, adding
that the magazine used statistics
that were two or three years old.
He added that overall alumni
donations have been in "the top
five every year."
"I don't think U.S. News sur
veyed alumni," he said.
