# Demolition Man
## 
### 
Imagine a future where sex is a neurologi
cal passion, commercials are the entertain
ment on oldies-but-goodies radio and vio
lence is on exhibit at the local museum. The
year is 2032. In "Demolition Man," time pa
rades into the 21st century, where, unfortu
nately, typical tales of good versus evil still
abound.
Escaping from Cryoprison, 20th-centu
ry criminal Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes)
is a madman out of control in a basket-case
society. Unequipped to curb his murderous
actions, the inept San Angeles Police De
partment releases and reinstates Phoenix's
20th-century nemesis, rogue cop John
Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) to mop up the
mess.
Stallone and Snipes engage in a tradition
al shoot-'em-up, with outrageous car chases
and testosterone bouts replete with grunt
ing. But "Demolition Man" works at least
fairly well because of Stallone and Snipes'
opposing-yet-amusing portrayals of good
and evil. Though we never commit to the
cockamamie tale director Marco Bambilla
spoon-feeds us, we have so much fun we stop
caring.
Blonde-haired, blue-eyed Snipes carries

the bulk of the film, running away with an
over-the-top performance that instantly re
calls the hip-hop savvy of Nino Brown. In
contrast, Stallone portrays Spartan in a de
cidedly low-key fashion, seeming content to
be a stereotypically dull hero who saves the
day and gets the girl.
Although the film's story line suffers from
intense predictability, the scenes themselves
offer engrossing visual entertainment. Bam
billa's sharp camera angles and images of
techie science-fiction are obnoxiously pow
erful.
By focusing on the universal conflict be
tween good and evil and including an inordi
nate amount of violence, Bambilla uses a
cheap script and two multi-million dollar ac
tors to satirically poke fun at brutality's inte
gral role in our society. Surprisingly, he cre
ates something worth watching — if only for
the chuckles.
