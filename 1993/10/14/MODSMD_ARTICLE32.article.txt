# Musical genius lost
## 'Hatfield's 'Become What You Are' doesn't show what she can do 
### 
Never go to a concert on the basis of an awe
some single.
After leaving The Juliana Hatfield Three
concert last month feeling rather indifferent
about the group, my opinion of their so-so re
lease, "Become What You Are," didn't surprise
me.
And it's too bad, because "My Sister" cap
tures the love-hate root of every sibling rivalry
without reminding the listener of an Oprah
Winfrey episode.
Before the opening lines, "I hate my sister /
She's such a bitch," shock you, be aware that
Hatfield doesn't have a sister — only brothers
who supposedly gave her more than her fair
share of a hard time.
Hatfield, accompanied by her gritty guitar,
Dean Fisher's bass and Todd Phillip's drums,
sings matter-of-factly, "She lets her ladder
down for those who really shine /1 tried to scale
it / but to me she's blind / So I lit a firecracker /
it went off in my eye."
Genius.
Unfortunately, Hatfield neglected to apply
her substantial songwriting ability to half the
cuts off "Become What You Are," her second
album since her tenure with the Blake Babies
and her first fronting The Juliana Hatfield
Three.
Without the biting cynicism and insightful
character depiction found in her more moving
work, many of Hatfield's songs surrender to
their not-so-latent Debbie Gibson-esque lean
ings and leave the listener with a bountiful dis
play of cream-puff pop.
One great example, "Addicted," is about —
you guessed it — addiction. Hatfield declares
in her child-woman voice, "I think I'm addict
ed, addicted / Gotta have it every day."

No kidding.
Even more insulting to the intellect is "For
the Birds," a ridiculous ditty that tritely com
pares a dying baby bird to mankind's role in
the demise of the modern world. Set to sing
song melodies and repetitive chord progres
sions, tracks like these rock you to sleep faster
than a Nyquil overdose. Combine that with
Hatfield's high-pitched, cheerleader vocals
and her propensity for rhyme, and you've got
an amalgamation perfect for the Top 40
charts. ,
Although in a press conference last month,
Hatfield admitted she was "growing tired of
the indie lifestyle," she maintains that she's
striving for a harder sound. Thus, the grunge
guitar slapped behind pre-pubescent
melodies.
Yet Hatfield's lack of technical wizardry
goes unnoticed on the powerfully ironic "Su
permodel," which lambastes the "highest-paid
piece of ass" before pondering, "would she
trade places with me?"
And though Hatfield can't change her voice,
she can make it work for her. In "Mabel," Hat
field tests her dynamics while revealing the
story of an Alzheimer's victim from three dif
ferent points of view.
Starting with the woman herself, Hatfield
sings quietly and in a slightly dazed fashion.
For the next verse, she then slips into a confi
dent, soothing tone, portraying the woman
comforting her grown son as if he were still a
young boy.
Suddenly, Hatfield shouts the chorus, now
speaking as the neighbors who taunt the victim.
Just as quickly, she switches to third-person ob
server, this time choosing a pitying tone to
paint a solemn picture of the "absent" woman

living with her son.
Are you dizzy yet?
You wouldn't be
after listening to
"Mabel." Everything
works in this song:
Hatfield's vocals, the
dark, yet simple
melody and — sur
prise — even the
grunge chords. Lis
tening to "Mabel"
displays Hatfield's
talents, which are
too often hidden and
bring back poignant
memories of "Ugly,"
the best part of her
solo album "Hey
Babe."
During that
track, accompanied
only by her guitar,
Hatfield sings, "My
tiny screams don't
make a sound / And
I'm ugly, with a cap
ital 'U' / And I don't
need a mirror to see
that its true." With
soft, but unwavering
vocals and gentle
guitar sounds,
"Ugly" hits you like
a meat cleaver to the
face. Once again,

everything's clicking — tempered music, can
did lyrics and Hatfield's frank delivery.
Of course, every song can't be "Ugly." But

the rage felt after plunking down 12 or more
bones for "Become What You Are" is hardly
pretty.

While some of her songs demonstrate biting cynicism and musi
cal genius, Juliana Hatfield unfortunately surrenders to her not
so-latent Debbie Gibson-esque leanings.
