## "Human Wheels" John Mellencamp 
### 
"Human Wheels," the latest effort from
early '80s phenom John Mellencamp, almost
seems like one long, continuous, rhythmic
song to the careless listener. Basically, it's al
most as good as a physics text book when it
comes to putting you to sleep.
Trust me, 1 know.
That's not to say it's the worst album in the
world. It's got good rhythm and some beauti
ful guitar chords reminiscent of the early " John
Cougar" days of "American Fool." But the
problem is it all just sounds the same. So while
the first song sounds pretty good, 10 tracks
later the rhythm has grown just a little thin.
"Human Wheels" draws on the almost
country sounds of guitar and rhythm that

first made Mellen
camp famous, but
there is no real inno
vation to make the
album seem fresh.
Most of the songs
seem like pale imita
tions of "Hurts So
Good," "Jack and
Diane" and "Hand to
Hold On To."
In typical Cougar

style, the lyrics touch on a variety of topics —
from nostalgia for the simpler times long
since past to the destruction of the American
family. Religion is also at the forefront with
the name "Jesus" appearing in the lyrics at
least six times — and that's not counting ref
erences to God, rosaries or the Bible.
It's just the kind of biting social commen
tary you would expect from a nice Midwest
ern guy who spent his summer organizing
and performing at charity concerts aimed at
helping flood victims.
But the lyrics are almost irrelevant be
cause they are drowned out by wailing gui
tar chords. For example, the song "Case 795
(The Family)" talks about the horrors of
domestic violence in a very simplistic man
ner. "Tony Jones stabbed Alice Jones / On
their first anniversary / Down in Dallas,
Texas / In a small apartment." Like I said —
simple. But the horror of the violence never
comes through unless you sit down and
make an effort to both read and think about
the lyrics.
The one song that sticks out from the rest
is "Sweet Evening Breeze," a ballad about lost
summer sweethearts and the pain of growing
older. With its slow tones and varied
rhythms, it's a promise of the best of Mellen
camp's music.
Unfortunately, the rest of the album
doesn't keep that promise, and one out of 10
just ain't a great batting average.
