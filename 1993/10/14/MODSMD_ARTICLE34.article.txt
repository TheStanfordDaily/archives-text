# "American Caesar" Iggy Pop
## 
### 
Move over, Nirvana.
Mothers, hide your children.
The king of grunge has returned. Iggy Pop
is back.
It's hard to believe that Iggy Pop, now a
ghost-like apparition of his '70s self, could
crank out the harsh sounds of grunge mixed
with an eerie Alice Cooper flavor — but it's
true.
In his latest release, "American Caesar,"
Iggy dishes out 15 refined — but not polished
— tracks, all pleasing to the teenage ear. But
while Nirvana mixes grunge with funk, Iggy
combines a refined chaos with a dark tone
that gives the album a skin-crawling feel.
His first release from "American Caesar,"
entitled "Jealousy," is more musically con
trolled than most of the album, but less emo
tionally chained. It has a definite if-you-piss
me-off-one-more-time-I-just-might-rip-
your-still-beating-heart-out-of-your-chest
feel. With a military rhythm and strains of
hollow acoustic guitar, it sounds as empty as
the conscience of its singer. The anger here is
not directed toward a lost lover or personal
rival, but rather at greed and the power it has
in our society; and it is this statement that
sets the mood for "American Caesar."
There's something wrong with America

— and Iggy's out to tell us what it is.
On the "lighter" side of things is "I'm
Fucking Alone," just one of several songs that
helps warrant the "Parental Warning: This is
an Iggy Pop Record." Here Iggy croons, de
pressed, into the microphone, bemoaning
the loneliness of an egocentric society. But,
like all of the tracks on "American Caesar," it
has a mature sound and feel to it that eschews
the"I wear black on the outside because
black is how I feel on the inside" attitude of
The Cure.
In contrast, "Plastic and Concrete" is one
of five ear-bleeding slam-dance tunes laden
with scratchy guitar heavy on the distortion
and steady on the relentlessly harsh rhythm.
Two tracks in particular deserve special
mention. The first is a remake of "Louie
Louie" that sounds more like Megadeth then
The Kingsmen, and the second, "Caesar," is a
slow-motion industrial track accompanied
by absurd free-verse poetry praising the
Roman empire and recounting Caesar's
murder.
"American Caesar" is not simply the rant
ings of angry or uncontrolled youth. This is
the music of a man who sat in front of the
evening news for 10 years, immersed in im
ages of violence and hate.
No longer the youth he once was, Iggy has
become a tainted and dangerously melan
choly clairvoyant out to martyr himself to
our senseless and silent world.
