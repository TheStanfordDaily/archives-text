A Bronx Tale
A manic-depressive movie of sorts,
Robert De Niro's directorial debut
fluctuates between moderately bril
liant and excruciatingly clich6d mo
ments. The film depends on the in
evitable and tired attempted Mafia
mystique that Hollywood seems to

require of any movie with both Ital
ians and New York. But it's a heck of
a lot more than most of us would ex
pect from a movie that shamelessly
and relentlessly repeats its theme
quote, "The saddest thing in life is
wasted potential." R
The Age of Innocence
Martin Scorsese may have learned
how to hobnob with the upper crust
of 19th-century New York, but he's
left his heart in 20th-century Little
Italy. Daniel Day-Lewis shines as
one-third of Pulitzer Prize-winning
author Edith Wharton's bizarre love
triangle, but the script and direction
hang Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona
Ryder out to dry. The verdict: aes
thetic masterpiece, emotional mis
fire. PG
Cool Runnings
Disney asks the question, "Is there
any sport a black man or woman
can't excel in?" and answers with a
comically resounding "No." Unfortu
nately it's not the movie its actors
(Doug E. Doug, Leon, John Candy)
or filmmakers (Michael Goldberg,
Dawn Steel) believe it to be. The
real- life struggle of the first Ja
maican bobsled team in history, it's
cute, it's warm, it's fuzzy. .. provid
ed you like being paraded around
like a puppet. Still it's the kind of
light-hearted family fare that's hard
to dismiss entirely. PG

Dazed and Confused
Pari "Nashville," part "School Daze,"
all "Up In Smoke." That's the best
way to describe writer-director
Richard Linklater's latest film, which
goes back to the future, circa 1976,
to deliver a sly rebuke to the hypo
critical morality of the "Me" decade.
By refusing to wallow in nostalgia,
he comes up with a witty, vital look
at a single day and night of high
school hijinks that today's youth will
appreciate. R
For Love or Money
Michael J. Fox plays his usual lik
able Alex P. Keaton character in this
story of a young man trying to get
ahead. But Gabrielle Anwar's brutal
izing performance along with pedes
trian humor and a limp storyline,
topple Fox's best efforts to pull off
typical summer fluff that's not even
good fluff and only intermittently
funny. PG
The Joy Luck Club
Grandiose, epic, tear-jerking and
gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous...
this adaptation of Amy Tan's best
seller is all of the above. Moving de
spite its blatant commercialism,
"The Joy Luck Club" does a splen
did job of bringing the novel to life
and marks a monumental first for
Asian-Americans in Hollywood. PG

Kalifornia
It's the worse kind of deja vu — the
kind that reminds you of something
bad, that reminds you of something
worse, that makes you wag your
head and ask, "Whatever happened
to the good old days?" They're
dead. Buried. What's left are inter
esting premises — a hick-ish serial
killer (Brad Pitt) and his dim-witted
girl friend (Juliet Lewis) go "kill-rid
ing" with a couple of snooty liberal
lovers — that never quite reach the
end of the line. Still Dominic Sena of
Propaganda Films fame has visual
sense enough to hold things togeth
er. R
Malice
Director Harold Becker attempts to
craft a suspenseful story but the re
sult is a series of complicated twists
that never seem to end. Both plot
turns and acting are so exaggerated
that "Malice" seems more like a
comedy than a taut Hitchcockian
thriller. Whatever potential the film
had on paper is lost because both
writers and directors try to include
too many unsurprising surprise ele
ments and canned dialogue. R
The Program
Touchstone Pictures' latest release
is a mediocre look at the corruption
and deceit within major college foot
ball. James Caan plays the role as
sterotypical head coach, overlook

ing the drugs, cash payments and
crime that occur in his "Program."
Though the football scenes are su
perb, the movie focuses on off-the
field activities too much. A weak
script and the never-ending prob
lems the program faces make the'
movie drag on. If it had focused on
the actual football scenes, this could
have become a pigskin classic. R
The Secret Garden
A fine adaptation of the well-loved
novel. Director Agnieszka Holland
("Europa, Europa") is well-attuned to
its darker elements — abandonment,
incest and illness — as well as its
metaphor for puberty and sexual
awakening. She extracts fine perfor
mances from the entire cast without
overly sentimentalizing the story. You
might not be moved to tears, but this
film will certainly hold your interest. G
True Romance
No, it's not a "Bonnie and Clyde" for
the '90s. It's your basic boy meets
ho, boy gets ho, boy kills ho's pimp
and heads for L.A. with suitcase full of
pimp's cocaine story — the kind
we'd expect to find in a trashy ro
mance magazine. Written by auteur
du jour Quentin Tarantino ("Reservoir
Dogs"), the film is as breathless and
shallow as one of those dime-a
dozen stories. But the filmt has a ten
dollar script that rescues it from direc
tor Tony Scott's two-bit hack job. R

had on paper is lost because both
writers and directors try to include
too many unsurprising surprise ele
ments and canned dialogue. R
The Program
Touchstone Pictures' latest release
is a mediocre look at the corruption
and deceit within major college foot
ball. James Caan plays the role as
sterotypical head coach, overlook

ing the drugs, cash payments and
crime that occur in his "Program."
Though the football scenes are su
perb, the movie focuses on off-the
field activities too much. A weak
script and the never-ending prob
lems the program faces make the'
movie drag on. If it had focused on
the actual football scenes, this could
have become a pigskin classic. R
The Secret Garden
A fine adaptation of the well-loved
novel. Director Agnieszka Holland
("Europa, Europa") is well-attuned to
its darker elements — abandonment,
incest and illness — as well as its
metaphor for puberty and sexual
awakening. She extracts fine perfor
mances from the entire cast without
overly sentimentalizing the story. You
might not be moved to tears, but this
film will certainly hold your interest. G
True Romance
No, it's not a "Bonnie and Clyde" for
the '90s. It's your basic boy meets
ho, boy gets ho, boy kills ho's pimp
and heads for L.A. with suitcase full of
pimp's cocaine story — the kind
we'd expect to find in a trashy ro
mance magazine. Written by auteur
du jour Quentin Tarantino ("Reservoir
Dogs"), the film is as breathless and
shallow as one of those dime-a
dozen stories. But the filmt has a ten
dollar script that rescues it from direc
tor Tony Scott's two-bit hack job. R
A Bronx Tale
A manic-depressive movie of sorts,
Robert De Niro's directorial debut
fluctuates between moderately bril
liant and excruciatingly clich6d mo
ments. The film depends on the in
evitable and tired attempted Mafia
mystique that Hollywood seems to

require of any movie with both Ital
ians and New York. But it's a heck of
a lot more than most of us would ex
pect from a movie that shamelessly
and relentlessly repeats its theme
quote, "The saddest thing in life is
wasted potential." R
The Age of Innocence
Martin Scorsese may have learned
how to hobnob with the upper crust
of 19th-century New York, but he's
left his heart in 20th-century Little
Italy. Daniel Day-Lewis shines as
one-third of Pulitzer Prize-winning
author Edith Wharton's bizarre love
triangle, but the script and direction
hang Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona
Ryder out to dry. The verdict: aes
thetic masterpiece, emotional mis
fire. PG
Cool Runnings
Disney asks the question, "Is there
any sport a black man or woman
can't excel in?" and answers with a
comically resounding "No." Unfortu
nately it's not the movie its actors
(Doug E. Doug, Leon, John Candy)
or filmmakers (Michael Goldberg,
Dawn Steel) believe it to be. The
real- life struggle of the first Ja
maican bobsled team in history, it's
cute, it's warm, it's fuzzy. .. provid
ed you like being paraded around
like a puppet. Still it's the kind of
light-hearted family fare that's hard
to dismiss entirely. PG

Dazed and Confused
Pari "Nashville," part "School Daze,"
all "Up In Smoke." That's the best
way to describe writer-director
Richard Linklater's latest film, which
goes back to the future, circa 1976,
to deliver a sly rebuke to the hypo
critical morality of the "Me" decade.
By refusing to wallow in nostalgia,
he comes up with a witty, vital look
at a single day and night of high
school hijinks that today's youth will
appreciate. R
For Love or Money
Michael J. Fox plays his usual lik
able Alex P. Keaton character in this
story of a young man trying to get
ahead. But Gabrielle Anwar's brutal
izing performance along with pedes
trian humor and a limp storyline,
topple Fox's best efforts to pull off
typical summer fluff that's not even
good fluff and only intermittently
funny. PG
The Joy Luck Club
Grandiose, epic, tear-jerking and
gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous...
this adaptation of Amy Tan's best
seller is all of the above. Moving de
spite its blatant commercialism,
"The Joy Luck Club" does a splen
did job of bringing the novel to life
and marks a monumental first for
Asian-Americans in Hollywood. PG

Kalifornia
It's the worse kind of deja vu — the
kind that reminds you of something
bad, that reminds you of something
worse, that makes you wag your
head and ask, "Whatever happened
to the good old days?" They're
dead. Buried. What's left are inter
esting premises — a hick-ish serial
killer (Brad Pitt) and his dim-witted
girl friend (Juliet Lewis) go "kill-rid
ing" with a couple of snooty liberal
lovers — that never quite reach the
end of the line. Still Dominic Sena of
Propaganda Films fame has visual
sense enough to hold things togeth
er. R
Malice
Director Harold Becker attempts to
craft a suspenseful story but the re
sult is a series of complicated twists
that never seem to end. Both plot
turns and acting are so exaggerated
that "Malice" seems more like a
comedy than a taut Hitchcockian
thriller. Whatever potential the film
had on paper is lost because both
writers and directors try to include
too many unsurprising surprise ele
ments and canned dialogue. R
