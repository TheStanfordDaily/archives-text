I'll admit it: I cried during
"The Joy Luck Club." And the
ending of "Out of Africa" always
sends me running for the
Kleenex- Even "Much Ado About
Nothing" stimulated the tear
ducts. What is it about these gut
renchers that leaves me heartbro
ken and sniffling for hours while
my male friends usually sigh
somewhere in the middle and go

play Nintendo?
Is it woman's natural in
clination as the fairer sex

to admire and enjoy these tales of
romance? Far from the random
(and gratuitous) violence that
peppers the movies my guy
friends favor, chick flicks give
their audience something to
which to aspire.
I'm not embarrassed to say
that the parts of "Terminator"
where my eyes weren't closed

were almost entertaining. We
can bridge that gender chasm.
So, come on guys, give these dia
logue-driven movies a chance.
Rather than a Beavis-and-
Butthead reaction to a movie
that may not be immediately
gratifying, invite that special
someone to see "Age of Inno
cence." You might like it.
