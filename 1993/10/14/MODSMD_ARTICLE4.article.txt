# BYOB-only fraternities get boost
## New policy to limit open keg-parties to even-numbered days 
### Charles Katz 
After Oct. 20, there will be no open
keg-parties at fraternities on even-num
bered days.
Under an Interfraternity Council res
olution passed unanimously yesterday,
any open fraternity party held on an
even-numbered day must follow the
Bring Your Own Beverage (BYOB) poli
cy. Parties hosted on odd-numbered days
are not affected by this resolution.
On even-numbered days, open frater

nity parties may not have common con
tainers of alcohol present, but may pro
vide non-alcoholic beverages, according
to the resolution. Common containers in
clude kegs, party balls and bowls of
punch. Individuals attending the event
will be responsible for purchasing and
bringing their own alcohol. During these
BYOB-only days, no chapter funds may
be spent on alcohol.
Closed parties with common contain
ers of alcohol will be exempt from the pol
icy. A closed party signifies one in which

the number of people at the party is less
than three times the number of hosting
members in attendance.
IFC President Mike Champney said
the new policy was implemented in order
to allow fraternities that can only hold
BYOB parties to compete with those that
can hold open-alcohol parties.
Because of their insurance policies
and prcsbure from their national organi
zations, some fraternities have been
forced to hold only BYOB parties.
The mtyority of the 18 fraternities
on campus are being forced into
BYOB-only events because of their
insurance policy, said Heather
Dunn, fraternal affaire adviser at
the Office of Student Activities.
The idea for the resolution was
first brought up by Sigma Phi
Epsilon last spring in order to
allow all campus fraternities to
thrive, even with the BYOB
restriction.
Sigma Phi Epsilon President
Ken Baerenklau, whose fraternity
is restricted to BYOB-only parties,
said fraternity parties are crucial
to recruiting new members.
"If we always had to compete
with large keg parties, our mem
bership could wane," he said.
But, under the new IFC policy,
fraternities such as Sigma Phi
Epsilon will not be in competition
with others that can host open par
ties.
"The administration is pleased
to see that students are willing to
take responsibility and look at both
sides of the issue," Dunn said. "It's
exciting to see that the IFC took all
sides into consideration in their
unanimous vote."
Although the administration
applauds the policy, they had no
input on the actual policy, Dunn
said.

The resolution will be enforced
by the all-student IFC executive
committee, which will both assign
blame and stipulate punishment.
After a recommendation from the
committee, a penalty must be
approved by a two-thirds vote of
the entire IFC.
But Champney said he believes
fraternities will follow the rules.
"The resolution was passed unani
mously in a spirit of cooperation.
Non-BYOB fraternities recognize
they must allow BYOB-only frater
nities to hold successful parties so
the whole Greek system can
remain strong."
Even though almost all other
college campuses have a BYOB
only policy, Baerenklau said he
does not believe that is where Stan
ford is heading. Baerenklau said
this measure was only taken to
allow restricted fraternities to
recruit more easily.
Champney said he thinks the
policy will not significantly alter
Stanford's social scene.
"There's more to fraternity par
ties than just free beer," said
Champney. "Students come to par
ties to socialize and dance. Stu
dents who stay away from the par
ties at fraternities because of the
policy will not be able to find the
same social atmosphere."
Freshman Rob Hatta agreed
that the social life on campus will
not be drastically affected.
"It just means liquor stores are
going to get a little more business
on [even-numberedj days," he said.
