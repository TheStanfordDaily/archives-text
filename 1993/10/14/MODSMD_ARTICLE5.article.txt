# Medical researchers explore genetic basis of manic depression

### Megan Himan 
The Medical Center has joined
with two other research institu
tions to find a genetic basis to
manic depression, the leading
cause of suicide among young
adults.
If their study is successful, it
would be the first time a psycho
logical illness has been proven to
be genetically linked.
Leading Stanford's research is
Genetics Department Chair David
Botstein, who has developed a "si
multaneous search" theory, which
suggests that up to five genes are
responsible for manic depression.

Previous efforts have failed to
pinpoint any single gene that is re
sponsible for the disease, which af
fects more than 2.5 million Ameri
cans.
Botstein said that although
much less common diseases have
been mapped, the genetics of
manic depression seem to be more
complex.
The $2.5 million study, funded
by grants from the Charles A.
Dana Foundation, is one of many
ongoing projects to link diseases to
genetics. Stanford will work with
Johns Hopkins University and
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
on the study.
Chris Clark, a research associ
ate in the Stanford project, esti
mates that the study could be
completed within the next two
years.
"We are cautiously optimistic
that we could scan the whole
genome (to look for possible links)
in a year or two. Whether we find
something or not is uncertain,"
Clark said.
"Once you find the gene, you

can Figure out what's causing the
disease; then you can work on
finding a cure," she said.
Finding the genes that cause
manic depression could permit
early diagnosis and early treat
ment of the disease, which is now
often misdiagnosed or underdiag
nosed. People who have the dis
ease may not always recognize it,
Clark said.
Genetic research was revolu
tionized in 1980 by Botstein's
idea that researchers could use
signposts along the human chro
mosome as markers. Since then,
the human genome project has
created a "genetic map" which
makes it possible to search for the

genes that cause complex dis
eases.
The manic depression study
will use blood samples from about
50 families who have the disease
on one side of the family. Other
studies have been done on one
particular family line, according
to Clark.
"A lot of people have someone
in their family or know a friend
who has the disease," said Clark.
"For me, this is a personal chance
to work on a devastating human
disease for people who want treat
ment for it.... As a scientist I'm
excited to use a new genetic map
to try and do something that's a
challenge."
