# Medical researchers explore genetic basis of manic depression

The Medical Center has joined
with two other research institu
tions to find a genetic basis to
manic depression, the leading
cause of suicide among young
adults.
If their study is successful, it
would be the first time a psycho
logical illness has been proven to
be genetically linked.
Leading Stanford's research is
Genetics Department Chair David
Botstein, who has developed a "si
multaneous search" theory, which
suggests that up to five genes are
responsible for manic depression.

Previous efforts have failed to
pinpoint any single gene that is re
sponsible for the disease, which af
fects more than 2.5 million Ameri
cans.
Botstein said that although
much less common diseases have
been mapped, the genetics of
manic depression seem to be more
complex.
The $2.5 million study, funded
by grants from the Charles A.
Dana Foundation, is one of many
ongoing projects to link diseases to
genetics. Stanford will work with
Johns Hopkins University and
