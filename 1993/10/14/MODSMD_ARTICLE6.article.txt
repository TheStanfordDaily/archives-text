# 3,000 copies of Review stolen from campus bins
## 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
Thousands of copies of The
Stanford Review were stolen from
distribution points around cam
pus sometime before yesterday
morning.
Between 2,500 and 3,000 copies
of the paper — valued at $1,250 to
$ 1,500 — were taken from several
newspaper bins, said Lisa Koven,
the Review's editor-in-chief. The
papers were distributed around 3
p.m. Tuesday, but Koven said she
noticed them missing yesterday
morning.
The papers were assumed
stolen because they disappeared
more quickly than usual and there

were no papers strewn around the
bins, Koven said.
Koven said she had talked to
workers at Tresidder Union, who
confirmed that the papers near
the union were missing when they
arrived at work yesterday morn
ing. University maintenance
workers told Koven they did not
take the papers, she said.
The missing papers were re
ported to the Stanford Police De
partment and the Judicial Affairs
Office, Koven said. Review Execu
tive Editor Anoop Prakash said it
is unclear whether the seizure of
papers was in fact theft because
the Review is free.
Whether or not a crime was
committed, taking the papers was
still wrong, Koven said.
"We think it's almost a traves
ty of justice, because instead of
stealing our papers people should

write us letters so we can have
free and open discourse of
issues," she said.
Neither Koven nor Prakash
said they knew why the papers
were taken. No one has claimed
responsibility, they said.
"Though this is just a setback,
we're taking it as someone's feeble
way of making a point," he said.
Koven said she has more copies

of the Oct. 11 edition of the
Review — which featured cover
stories on alumni satisfaction and
Food Service's points system —
but does not yet know if they will
be distributed.
"This is what we feel to be one
of our best issues in a long time,"
she said. "We want people to know
how bad this is (stealing the
papers)."
