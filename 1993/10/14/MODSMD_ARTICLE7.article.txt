Former Environmental Protection
Agency director William Reilly hopes to
teach a crash course on the environment,
the economy and NAFTA to Stanford
students during his one-year tenure as a
visiting professor this year.
Reilly is a champion of the environ
ment. More specifically, in a time of
free-trade-vs.-environment debates, he
is a champion of integrating economic
and environmental agendas, which he
in part defines as active support of the
North American Free Trade Agree
ment.
NAFTA will promote "upward har
monizing, protection of (strict) environ
mental standards . . . and set the conti
nent on a more unified course," said Reil
ly, who has been lecturing nationwide
and working with Congress to ensure the
passage of the agreement.
Reilly, who led the EPA during the
Bush administration, arrived at Stanford
yesterday as the first Arthur and Frank

Payne Lecturer on the Global Communi
ty and Its Challenges. Reilly's series on
"Greening the World Order," which will
conclude in April, will serve as a resource
for several classes and seminars.
Reilly said the the lectures allow him
the opportunity to reflect on his work at
the EPA and to discuss issues such as
the progress made in environmental
protection and the need for environmen
talists to get involved with making poli
cy.
"We have the opportunity, with the
lend of] the Cold War, to redirect ener
gies. Things we had only dreamed about,
we can aspire to. [But) we don't act as if
we're liberated to go beyond national se
curity. It's a very different world from
just five years ago.
"We need a vision of America that's
confident, outward looking, engaged in
leadership — the only way America
should ever be," he said.
Reilly said the EPA made substantive

progress under his leadership,
elevating the role of science in
environmental policy, setting
records in every area of enforce
ment and prosecuting more
criminal cases in Reilly's four
years than in the previous 18
years. The Clean Air Act of 1990,
which promoted alternate fuels
and required reductions in emis
sions, was also passed during his
term.
Reilly also made foreign policy
a priority in the environmental
landscape. Most recently, in 1992,
Reilly led the U.S. delegation to
the Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro. He also negotiated revi
sions to the Montreal Protocol
phasing out ozone-depleting
chemicals.

Former University President
and Human Biology Prof. Donald
Kennedy lauded Reilly's leader
ship and knowledge of environ
mental issues.
While Reilly was with the EPA
during the Bush presidency, he
was a "voice crying out in the
wilderness. . . . But he was crying
out for the right thing," said
Kennedy, who met Reilly nearly
10 years ago when Reilly was the
head of the Conservation Foun
dation and the World Wildlife
Fund.
Kennedy and Reilly also collab
orated in 1983 on the creation of a
new organization, Clean Sites,
Inc., a non-profit group which
focused its efforts on cleaning up
toxic-waste sites.
Reilly said he believes that the
environmental movement has
made great progress in recent
years, though each new success
brings with it more responsibili

ties.
"Environmentalists have risen
to a degree of influence, which is
a great tribute but also leaves
them with the burden [of partici
pating! in policy making, with
answers, not just with criticism,"
he said.
Reilly's lecture series comes as
a result of a two-year-old endow
ment, which brings to the Univer
sity an expert in international
policy issues, said Walter Falcon,
director of the Institute for Inter
national Studies, which is spon
soring the lecture series.
"Whatever one's political affili
ation, [one must admit] Reilly did
a remarkably good job as adminis
trator of the EPA. We were
impressed with his attempts to
bring incentives to play in doing
good for the environment and his
attempt to bring more of an
emphasis on science to the EPA,"
Falcon said.
