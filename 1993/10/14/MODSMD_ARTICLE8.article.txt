### Scott Van Winkle 
Wearing a green tie in front of a packed
Kresge Auditorium audience, William Reilly,
former head of the Environmental Protec
tion Agency, explained his support for the
North American Free Trade Agreement de
spite opposition from other "green" activists.
In last night's hour-long lecture, the for
mer Bush administration official claimed that
NAFTA is really about "binding our hemi

sphere together" in support of goals including
"growth ... stable institutions and congenial
relations, and environmental cooperation."
Stanford's Student Environmental Ac
tion Coalition, on the other hand, distributed
a "fact sheet" at the lecture stressing
NAFTA's lack of protection for Mexican
workers' rights, relatively small sanctions of
$20 million for environmental offenses and
lack of representation on decision-making
bodies.

Responding to such criticisms, Reilly
stressed the "startling size and fervor of
Mexico's environmental commitments,"
praising Mexican President Carlos Salinas as
a man who had "slain a whole herd of sacred
cows" in shutting down polluting factories,
preserving Mexican land and battling cor
ruption.
Reilly also characterized environmental-
ists' descriptions of exploited
workers, indolent union bosses
and bribe-taking government offi
cials as "negative stereotypes"
and posited the existence of a
"new Mexico" which was "vital
and transforming, modernizing
and full of promise."
He said there would be "little
prospect" for renegotiating a new
agreement with Mexico if this one

is defeated, and warned that if
Congress rejects NAFTA, "the
casualty will be trust of the U.S.
by Mexicans and their future
leaders, with a possible return to
the anti-gringo insularity that
has characterized most of Mexi
can history."
Spicing up the speech with
anecdotes of his years in the Bush
administration and swipes at
Ross Perot and politicians of all
stripes — including both Califor
nia senators, who oppose the
agreement — Reilly urged envi
ronmentalists to "ensure that

environmentalism does not
become a cover for protection
ism.
As a visiting professor at
Stanford's Institute for Interna
tional Studies, Reilly will give a
series of five lectures on campus
to be published at the end of the
year.
He explained his decision to
come to Stanford for the one-year
position as a result of the "irre
sistible force" of Stanford alumni,
including Supreme Court Chief
Justice William Rehnquist, lobby
ing him in Washington.
