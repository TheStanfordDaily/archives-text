# Study to examine ASSU's activities
## Law student plans year-long project 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
ASSU leaders have become ac
customed to students' accusa
tions of resume-packing, ineffec
tiveness and mismanagement
over the past severed years.
Yet few of the critics have come
forward with concrete sugges
tions for how to fix the system.

Enter David
Smolen, a sec
ond-year law stu
dent who plans
to conduct a
study of the
ASSU's work
ings that will
produce recom
mendations on
how to improve

the quality student government.
Smolen is winner of last year's
Robert L. Pierce Memorial
Award, which is sponsored by the
Alumni Association and provides
$1,500 each year for an innova
tive student project.
"The general idea is to take
what I think to be the first com
prehensive look at the ASSU," he
said. The year-long project will
focus on four specific aspects of
student government: student
group funding, the ASSU consti
tution, student feedback and the


Smolen
ASSU banking service.
Smolen's project will be com
pleted this spring when his group
issues a report containing sug
gestions for the ASSU.
"One thing people need to
know is this isn't the ASSU's
project," he said, adding that he
intends to be critical of the cur
rent state of student govern
ment.
But Smolen holds no illusions
about the report's power to bring
about a quick revitalization of the
ASSU.
"We're acting as consultants
— we have no power to change
anything," he said. "I think the
ASSU is an important organiza
tion and, in many ways, it has
lost its relevance."
Smolen plans to begin recruiti
ing teams of undergraduates and
graduates next week who will
research each of these aspects.
"We are going to interview
students and examine the ways
in which other schools' student
governments are set up," he said.
The group has already estab
lished a board of advisers, which
includes Dean of Students
Michael Jackson as well as
ASSU-related students and
administrators.
"The project will bring a fresh

perspective to some of the impor
tant changes that we have made
over the years to the ASSU bank
ing services and business projects
to ensure that things are going
well," Jackson said.
ASSU financial manager
Brian Hillger, who is also a mem
ber of the board of advisers, said
the project is "a chance for people
who are not involved in the ASSU
to get a different perspective on
its operation."
Smolen, who served as ASSU
Senate chair during the 1987-88
academic year, says he wants to
refrain from addressing specific
issues currently confronting the
ASSU.
"We are going to place more of
a focus on the underlying fea
tures of student government," he
said. The project will largely
focus on whether students feel
the ASSU is providing them with
useful services.
"I think the workings of the
ASSU are fairly opaque to the
average student," said graduate
senator Neil Crellin. "This pro
ject is a good way for students to
see inside the government."
As a former senator, Smolen is
well aware of the flimsy plat
forms that elevate many students
to office within the ASSU, a $3
million corporation.
"Hopefully, by reviewing the
constitution and student input,
we can find out how senators can
be more effective."
