MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP)
â€” U.S. helicopter pilot Michael
Durant, battered but buoyant,
returned to freedom yesterday on
a stretcher after 11 days as a cap
tive of a Somali warlord.
The United States said no
deal was made for the release of
Durant, captured in an Oct. 3
battle between U.N. troops and
Mohamed Farrah Aidid's fight
ers, or of a Nigerian peacekeep
er captured in a Sept. 5 gun
fight.
However, Aidid emerged with
an enhanced stature as a result of
the release, which he came out of
hiding to announce at a news con
ference. He appeared confident
and wore a crisply pressed blue
striped shirt and red tie.
The freeing of Durant led to

more calls from Congress for
speeding the departure of U.S.
troops from Somalia. President
Clinton indicated he might be
flexible on his March 31 deadline
for withdrawal.
Dr. John Holcomb of the 46th
U.S. Army Field Hospital, who
examined Durant, said the pilot
suffered a broken leg, broken
cheekbone and a fractured back,
but appeared to have been treated
fairly well by his captors. The leg
was in a splint, but had not been
set and was quite painful, Hol
comb said.
He said most of Durant's
injuries probably were sustained
when a rocket-propelled grenade
blasted the tail off his helicopter,
although Durant said in an inter
view while in captivity that he had

been budly beaten by a crowd and
stripped naked after his capture.
Aidid, who has eluded capture
since June despite a U.N. ransom
of $25,000, looked more like a
political candidate than a wanted
guerrilla during a news confer
ence yesterday.
The meeting with reporters
itself was a sign of how things
have changed in the Somali capi
tal. No longer a fugitive, Aidid
emerged with an enhanced image
and could even become a political
player.
Appearing relaxed, Aidid called
for the unconditional release of 32
Somalis detained by the United
Nations, including three top aides
and his chief arms supplier. Aidid
earlier made their release a condi
tion for releasing Durant.
