Five killed in health club
EL CAJON, Calif. (AP) - A 19-
year-old Alpine man drove to his
health club yesterday, shot a man to
death outside, then entered the
crowded building and killed three
women before killing himself, police
said.
In addition to the five dead, one other
woman was slightly hurt during the
noontime shooting at a Family Fitness
Center in this San Diego suburb, police
Lt. Bill McClurg said.
The gunman, James M. Buquet, died
in his car outside the club, where he was
a member, police said.
Witnesses said he shot himself with a
shotgun.
At least two of the dead women,
Helen-Marie Spatz, 36, and Rebecca
Negrette, age unknown, were instructors
at the health club, McClurg said.
Names of the other two victims hadn't
been released.
Negrette's child was in the health

club's child care center at the time of the
shooting, but was unharmed, police said.
U.S. may blockade Haiti
WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Clinton pledged yesterday to take addi
tional steps to help restore democracy to
Haiti and hinted he might consider some
form of naval blockade — but under
another name.
"The people in Haiti would be sadly
misguided" to think the United States
will walk away from the U.N. effort to
return ousted President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, Clinton said.
Hours after his remarks, the justice
minister of the Haitian transition gov
ernment, Guy Malary, was assassinated
while leaving his government building.
White House Communications Direc
tor Mark Gearan called the killing "a des
perate attempt to thwart the will of the
Haitian people for democracy. The United
States remains firmly committed to . . .
the return to Haiti of President Aristide."
