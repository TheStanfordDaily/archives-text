# Boyfriend says Biehl killers shouldn't die
## Stanford grad Scott Meinert wants education for accused youths 
### 
CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) —
Amy Biehl's boyfriend blames apartheid
for her murder and says her killers
should be given an education rather than
the death penalty.
"They killed Amy, the single most
important thing in my life, and I am very
angry for that," Scott Meinert of Salem,
Ore., told The Associated Press while on
a visit to Cape Town.
He said an education for the youths
who hit Biehl in the face with a brick and
then stabbed her to death Aug. 25 would
help them understand and atone for
what they did. Biehl, a Stanford gradu
ate and a Fulbright scholar, was in South
Africa helping blacks register to vote in
the country's first multiracial elections
in April.
Meinert, 28, agreed he was angry
about the slaying, but he said the ulti
mate blame for the death of the woman
he hoped to marry lay with apartheid
and its white perpetrators.
"They are the people that really, ulti
mately fuel that kind of anger and
hatred," he said yesterday. "I'm infuriat-

Ed and will always probably be until it
(apartheid) is completely stamped out."
Seven black males, ranging in age
from 15 to 23, are to stand trial Nov. 8
for Biehl's murder. At least four have
admitted being members of the student
wing of the Pan Africanist Congress, a
militant black group that demands the
ouster of whites from power in South
Africa.
Meinert and Biehl's parents, sisters
and brother this week visited the
Guguletu black township where the
murder occurred. About 300 black stu
dents welcomed the family at the Uni
versity of the Western Cape, where Biehl
had worked.
Meinert, a law student at Willamette
University in Salem, does not believe the
killers will get a fair trial under South
Africa's legal system.
"I would like to see them go through a
different judicial system, where I honest
ly believe fair trials take place. I'm not
sure they do down here," he said, adding
that he and Biehl opposed the death
penalty.

Murder convictions can bring the
death sentence in South Africa, although
no executions have been carried out for
years.
Biehl, 26, was to return to the United
States on Aug. 27 to study at Rutgers
University in New Jersey, where Mein
ert planned to meet her Sept. 3 and pro
pose marriage. Instead, Meinert deliv
ered a eulogy that day for Biehl.
The couple met while studying at
Stanford in 1987. Meinert, a varsity ath
lete, played basketball for the Cardinal
and Biehl was captain of Stanford's
swimming and diving team.
Today, Meinert wears Biehl's diving
team ring on a chain around his neck. He
was given the ring and other jewelry, still
crusted with blood, after Biehl's murder.
Meinert and Biehl spent a month
together in Cape Town last December, and
he said they often discussed the dangers
posed by South Africa's racial tension.
The last time he was with Biehl was
for 11 days in Paris in July. Meinert said
he decided to propose marriage the next
time they met. That time never came.
