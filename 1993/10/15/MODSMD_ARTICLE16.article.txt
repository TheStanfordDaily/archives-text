## Renovating errors 
### 
Wilbur's face lift points
to need to better involve
Res Ed's goals in future

SOLICIT INPUT. Solicit input.
Solicit input. Confer, confer,
confer. Hold more meetings,
draft a proposal, get more input,
revise, confer.
Repeat.
Not long ago, it seemed this uni
versity suffered from "hypercon
ferencing" — the practice of solicit
ing input from every possible per
son who might remotely be affected
by a given proposal.
The University's policy regard
ing sexual harassment languished
in limbo for two years; the Univer
sity Committee on Minority Issues
broke three deadlines before pre
senting their findings.
Recently, the pendulum has
seemed to swing back the other
way, as policies and projects have
begun to procede full steam ahead.
While this apparent new impetus is
laudable, the University must be
careful that it does not become
impetuous.
A case in point: the $8.4 million
renovation of Wilbur Hall.
In general, it's a great idea.
Everyone agreed: the place was a
pit, the dregs of the Draw, one of
Stanford's true slums. "Fix it up,"
they cried. And so began The Great
Transformation.
But as the lucky new residents of
"Estates de Wilbur" moved in, it
became clear that something was
terribly amiss in the lap of luxury:
The planners and approvers of the
renovation details were oblivious to
the realities of dorm life and did
not effectively consult students or
Residential Education about what
makes and breaks a community.
The number-one mistake
involved, obviously, the doors to stu
dent rooms, which must be kept
closed at all times as per the local
fire code. Anyone who knows any
thing about dorm life at Stanford —

and particularly freshman dorm life
— knows that an open-door policy is
a hallmark of Res Ed. What greater
impediment is there to socializing,
heart-to-hearts, progressive parties
and pillowfights than doors that
slam shut in one's face?
And there were other little
details. Framed, museum-esque
floral prints and wallpaper line the
halls. They are perfectly appropri
ate for the Holiday Inn, but hope
lessly overdecorative for common
areas that will undoubtedly play
host to waterfights and impromptu
football games.
However, conspicuously absent
were the much-needed bulletin
boards for programming notices
and the multitudes of fliers that
inevitably deluge every dormitory
on campus, particularly at the
beginning of the year.
Granted, the error of such deci
sions may not be obvious to some
one who is hoping to create a par
adise for students. But one would
think that if the University is
spending $8.4 million to revamp a
dormitory, they would be sure to
incorporate the goals of the Univer
sity's own Res Ed program into the
planning. One would think that, as
the project progressed, someone
familiar with dorm life would have
taken a tour, seen what was devel
oping, and suggested some modifi
cations to the plan before all eight
buildings were completed.
Instead, the University is now
contemplating the replacement of
the door mechanisms, a project
that could cost well over $100,000.
It's hard not to look back in hind
sight and say that a little more
planning, a little longer timeframe
and a little more consultation with
those in the know could have pre
vented this whole fiasco.
Undoubtedly, students are hap
py with and grateful for a great
majority of the improvements. But
hopefully, as the University moves
forward with the 10-year housing
improvement plan and on to pro
jects like Flo Mo and Stern, it won't
repeat the mistakes made on the
Wilbur project.
