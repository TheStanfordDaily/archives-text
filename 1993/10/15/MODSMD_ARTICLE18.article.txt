## Hark, ye pageant groupies 
### 
BEING 5 feet 10 inches with mud
brown hair, "cute" will never
exactly be an option for me. But
that doesn't mean that I have grown
out of my junior-high insecurities
entirely. I wouldn't want to trade lives
with the "cute women" — they're cer
tainly a big hit with the menfolk,
though, and I've always wondered how
they manage to look like they're being
filmed in soft-focus.
A few weeks ago, I dutifully per
formed a yearly ritual practiced by mil
lions of American women. I'm not
proud of it, but I'm willing to bet that
I'm not the only ambitious Stanford
student to have done it. I climbed into
my ratty pink terry-cloth bathrobe,
made some instant hot chocolate and
Hopped down on my sagging couch to
watch, you guessed it, the Miss Ameri
ca pageant ... as if the world didn't
tick me off enough already.
The same thoughts ran through my
head that plague all other pageant
watchers who are also female. For
example, "If the anorectic look is going
out, then how do you explain Miss
Louisiana?", "That's gotta be surgical
ly augmented" and "Are these really
the most shining examples of American
womanhood, and if so, where do I apply
for emigration?" Now please, o ye
pageant groupies of both sexes, don't
get up in arms about my apparent dis
dain for the contestants. Some are very

talented, some are earnest and intelli
gent . . . some are even attractive. But
there's got to be more to it than this. Of
course, this year, there was. Yes, the
old shindig got a real facelift . . . the
kind that stretches everything a bit too
tight. (Suffice it to say that a little
Pepto was in order after about half an
hour.) I suppose it was all downhill
after Bert Parks' departure and that we
shouldn't demand too much of his suc
cessors.
There were some real disappoint
ments for me, too, including one that
almost broke my heart — no one played
the marimbas in the talent segment.
The swimsuit competition has been re
christened and is now known as the
"fitness in swimsuit" competition. If I
were the host, I would feel incredibly
foolish saying those words, but it was
done, with a straight face and every
thing. Now there's a trooper! Upon
reflection, the name for that segment
probably isn't all that far off. After all,
you have to train pretty intensively to
be able to walk out on a stage in a
bathing suit and four-inch heels, turn
around (oh-so-slowly) and walk off
again, blinking as few times as possible
and maintaining a manic grin on your
face. I couldn't do it.
Yet there is hope . . . the pageant is
changing. There are more contestants
with a master's degree, more ethnic
minorities are represented, fewer fake

blondes and no baton-twirlers, at least
this year. The pageant people are
beginning to feel a little pressure for
reform. You can tell by the more mod
est, one-piece swimsuits and adding
"fitness" (read: firmness) as a criteri
on. Somebody at the planning commit
tee must have heard about the 19th
Amendment. Isn't modern progress
just amazing? Some things, though,
will never change — stupid production
numbers, total failure to recognize real
talent and"The Winning Look" (long
teeth, big hair and frontal anatomy, lit
tle of everything else).
The thing is, that the Miss America
pageant has bent about as far as it can
go without snapping. If they become
any more conscious of the idea that
there's more to being a woman than
being able giggle and wear slinky
sequined dresses, they're going to have
a hard time justifying their own exis
tence. The pageant would have to die,
and America's little girls would no
longer be supplied with such terrific
role models every year.
Wouldn't that be a shame.

with a master's degree, more ethnic
minorities are represented, fewer fake

blondes and no baton-twirlers, at least
this year. The pageant people are
beginning to feel a little pressure for
reform. You can tell by the more mod
est, one-piece swimsuits and adding
"fitness" (read: firmness) as a criteri
on. Somebody at the planning commit
tee must have heard about the 19th
Amendment. Isn't modern progress
just amazing? Some things, though,
will never change — stupid production
numbers, total failure to recognize real
talent and"The Winning Look" (long
teeth, big hair and frontal anatomy, lit
tle of everything else).
The thing is, that the Miss America
pageant has bent about as far as it can
go without snapping. If they become
any more conscious of the idea that
there's more to being a woman than
being able giggle and wear slinky
sequined dresses, they're going to have
a hard time justifying their own exis
tence. The pageant would have to die,
and America's little girls would no
longer be supplied with such terrific
role models every year.
Wouldn't that be a shame.
