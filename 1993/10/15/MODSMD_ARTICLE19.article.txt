## Extra Big Game tickets made available for students 
### 
THE STANFORD Athletic Ticket
Office apologizes for any misun
derstandings regarding the avail
ability of student tickets to the remain
ing football season and to Big Game.
Any Stanford student wishing to attend
Big Game Nov. 20 has two options to
purchase a ticket: a $40 ticket for
admission to the Cardinal's final three
home games vs. Arizona State, Oregon
State and Cal or a ticket to the Big
Game only for $32.
Any student who previously pur
chased a Big Game ticket only and
would like to attend the Arizona State
and Oregon State games can bring that
ticket and their ID to the ticket office
and obtain tickets in the student area
for the two games for an additional $8.
This $40 student packet will be valid
through Friday, Oct. 22 at 4 p.m.

Unsold tickets will then be sold to the
general public.
The decision to hold 4,000 tickets in
the student area is based on historical
information from the previous years of
sales. The total number of Stanford stu
dent tickets sold in the past four years
are: 1989, 4,387; 1990, 4,074; 1991,
3,742; and 1992, 3,633. In 1991, the last
time we hosted Big Game, the actual
number of student season tickets was
3,404 and the additional 338 were sold
in a short-season package. We are hold
ing every available seat on the east side
for students to buy through Oct. 22.
This is an additional 1,000 tickets, mak
ing the total available this year 5,000.
This represents more tickets than have
been purchased by Stanford students in
the past ten years.
The goal is to sell out Big Game (and

every other game each year). In an
effort to meet this goal, we try to antici
pate the number of tickets Stanford stu
dents will buy and hold that many for
them in the student section. When this
section is gone, we offer students tickets
in reserved seats as long as they last. It
is our policy to accommodate the stu
dent population and no student has
been turned away from the opportunity
to purchase tickets for the remaining
home games. Students are critical to the
success of the athletic programs and we
value them as customers.
A percentage of Stanford Stadium is
allotted to Cal, per contractual agree
ment, and they determine the number
of tickets to sell to their students (we do
the same when the game is in Berkeley,
based again on historical numbers of
previous years' sales). Cal will have

35,000 seats in Stanford Stadium on
Nov. 20 and Stanford fans will fill the
other 50,000 seats. We would also like
to note that the Stanford student allot
ment of 4,000 is enough to satisfy one
third of the student population; the
allotment of 5,000 is 42 percent of the
student community (the additional
1,000 tickets are being taken away from
the public sale). The Cal allotment to
their students represents one-fifth of
their student body.
As the director of ticket operations in
the Athletic Department, I hope this clar
ifies any misunderstanding and that all
students will show their support for Stan
ford football by coming to the ticket office
as soon as possible to either exchange or
purchase their student ticket!
