# Beauty notwithstanding, some much-needed advice on driving cross-country
## 
### 
It would be a shame if Nicole Krauss'
poetic column about the idyllic glory of
driving cross-country convinced anyone to
actually do it. As someone who also drove
here from New York just a few weeks ago,
let me give the Stanford community some
much-needed advice: fly.
Unless, of course, you enjoy being stuck
in a car for fifty hours as your brain begins
to rot from the monotony. Krauss recalled
a "feeling of endlessness, of vastness, of the
silence that surrounds something unspeak
able." I remember this feeling, too — but I
called it boredom.
It's the feeling you get after you've been
driving all day through straight, flat and
empty highway, so devoid of features that
you wonder if you're actually any further
than when you started. By then you've lis
tened to all of your tapes five times, and so
you're stuck listening to weather reports

out of Cheyenne on a crackling AM station.
And there's nothing to do but drive. Noth
ing to do but point the car straight ahead
and be sure not to fall asleep, hour after
hour.
Consider Utah, where Krauss watched
"the leaves protest the coming cold in fiery
reds and oranges." I don't remember seeing
any trees. I mostly remember the Salt Flats,
a hundred miles of utter desolation that
looked straight out of a Mad Max movie.
Then, of course, there's car trouble.
Anytime you drive 3,000 miles, some
thing's going to go wrong. My trouble came
somewhere in lowa, in the form of a
jammed odometer which produced a loud
clicking noise that slowly drove me and my
driving partner totally insane. By chance
we were able to have it fixed in Nebraska,
but we got the point; if you were to have a
real problem, you'd be totally screwed.
Krauss is absolutely right that ours is a
nation of tremendous beauty. But I think
most of us would be happier watching it
from the window of a Boeing 747.
