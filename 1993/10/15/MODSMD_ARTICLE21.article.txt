## Nothing is sacred when parents begin to clean house 
### 
MY PARENTS DON'T LOVE ME
anymore. I have tried to ignore
the lack of hometown-newspa
per-clipping filled, gut-busting care pack
ages. Tried to deny so many malicious
8:30 a.m. Sunday phone calls. Tried to
shield my eyes from Christmas after
Christmas of stockings filled with cans of
black olives.
I will hide my agony no longer.
They nefariously managed to camou
flage the symptoms of their distaste dur
ing my childhood. I was fooled by their
perfect attendance record at Back to
School nights. Tricked by so many home
cooked meals served at the dinner table,
not in front of the TV. Swindled by night
after night of frustratingly over-complex
trigonometry explanations from my
father, the math guy.
How could college ever change this
beautiful relationship? They claimed to
still love me while throwing out my old
jog-a-thon winner certificates from fifth
grade. Claimed that rats ate all my scan
dalously low-cut high-school formals in
the closet. Claimed the turquoise and yel

low painted clay plant holders from fourth
grade broke in some unreported earth
quake which ravaged our household's
childhood pottery collection, but miracu
lously left the rest of the greater Los Ange
les area unscathed.
The humanity.
But now they've gone too far. The twist
of the knife. The denouement. The straw
that broke this somewhat-less-frothy
camel's back.
They sold the Volvo.
Not just any Volvo. Not just any car.
They sold the car that was my childhood.
The car that traveled with my family as we
made the jump up the food chain from
backwater LeClaire, lowa — gene pool of
one — to goose-stepping Orange County,
California. The car that shuttled me from
diving practice to gymnastics workouts to
10-K races as a hyperactive 10-year-old
parental nightmare. The car that plagued
my existence as a snot-nosed 14-year-old,
as I matched my socks with my hair thin
gies with my glitter nail polish.
For $20, they sold the Volvo.
They can deny their subtle expulsion of

their youngest daughter from their home
and hearts no longer. Like some cold, cap
italistic, savings-and-loanesque squander
ing of my life savings of memories, my par
ents sold away my childhood. For less than
a dinner for two at the Sundance Mine
Co., they kicked my past through the
uprights, out of the stadium. And there's
no home-field advantage in this game to
keep me in the game for one last drive.
How can I convince them that the
Tequila Sunrise paint job, which was only
fashionable for one decade out of the his
tory of man, is still somewhat attractive?
How do I tell them that the multiple shop
ping-cart pock marks which sprinkled its
complexion added character to the Volvo's
hulking 1974 frame? How do I tell them
that the destruction of the field mice
colony which has called the car's engine
home for the last five years would be an
act of unforgivable genocide?
I can't, because they sold it.
Sold the car they gave to my brother for
his 16th birthday along with ajar of Turtle
Wax — which only accentuated the vomito
ry color-selection-market-researching skills

of Swedish engineers. The car they took
back two weeks later when my dad changed
jobs and gave back the company Oldsmo
bile. The car which my dad drove long after
he had the capital to invest in something
more distinguished and less repulsive, like
the Pinto he bought for mom.
It's all gone now. Gone are the morn
ings the Volvo would stall on the way to
school, sputtering across six lanes of 55-
mile-an-hour traffic — as my dad and I
stared like deer caught in the headlights of
the oncoming cars. Gone are the terrifying
moments I spent pleading with him to drop
me off a quarter-mile from school instead
of rumbling up to the curb in an act of
social hari-kari. Gone the family outings
spent barfing our tonsils out, trying to
scream conversations over the gentle, ear
drum-annihilating purr of the engine.
Life is no longer worth living.
And my dad, the man who was more
attached to that car than his brothers and
sisters, didn't even cry a tear. Such insen
sitivity from the man who used to gloat
about BMWs and Porsches getting out of
his way in the fast lane on his morning

commute, knowing he had nothing, abso
lutely nothing, to lose.
The man who insisted that if he were to
die he wanted a proper Viking burial in
which he would be rolled down the
onramp to the 57 Freeway in the Volvo —
IBM computer, fax machine, modem and
schedule planner by his side — the entire
spectacle set on fire so he could meet his
creator with honor. The man who refused
to let us be Cheeto-cheesy and call his
pride and joy The Great Pumpkin as if we
knew it gave him no pain.
You're a good man Charlie Brown.
But he has conceded, along with my
mom. As I left for Stanford, I knew this
time would come. But I had no idea the
changes would be so swift, so all-encom
passing, so brutal in their implementa
tion. My home is no longer my home any
more. First my Play-School People collec
tion, now the Volvo, and I'm on deck.
You can't go home again.

sisters, didn't even cry a tear. Such insen
sitivity from the man who used to gloat
about BMWs and Porsches getting out of
his way in the fast lane on his morning

commute, knowing he had nothing, abso
lutely nothing, to lose.
The man who insisted that if he were to
die he wanted a proper Viking burial in
which he would be rolled down the
onramp to the 57 Freeway in the Volvo —
IBM computer, fax machine, modem and
schedule planner by his side — the entire
spectacle set on fire so he could meet his
creator with honor. The man who refused
to let us be Cheeto-cheesy and call his
pride and joy The Great Pumpkin as if we
knew it gave him no pain.
You're a good man Charlie Brown.
But he has conceded, along with my
mom. As I left for Stanford, I knew this
time would come. But I had no idea the
changes would be so swift, so all-encom
passing, so brutal in their implementa
tion. My home is no longer my home any
more. First my Play-School People collec
tion, now the Volvo, and I'm on deck.
You can't go home again.

MY PARENTS DON'T LOVE ME
anymore. I have tried to ignore
the lack of hometown-newspa
per-clipping filled, gut-busting care pack
ages. Tried to deny so many malicious
8:30 a.m. Sunday phone calls. Tried to
shield my eyes from Christmas after
Christmas of stockings filled with cans of
black olives.
I will hide my agony no longer.
They nefariously managed to camou
flage the symptoms of their distaste dur
ing my childhood. I was fooled by their
perfect attendance record at Back to
School nights. Tricked by so many home
cooked meals served at the dinner table,
not in front of the TV. Swindled by night
after night of frustratingly over-complex
trigonometry explanations from my
father, the math guy.
How could college ever change this
beautiful relationship? They claimed to
still love me while throwing out my old
jog-a-thon winner certificates from fifth
grade. Claimed that rats ate all my scan
dalously low-cut high-school formals in
the closet. Claimed the turquoise and yel

low painted clay plant holders from fourth
grade broke in some unreported earth
quake which ravaged our household's
childhood pottery collection, but miracu
lously left the rest of the greater Los Ange
les area unscathed.
The humanity.
But now they've gone too far. The twist
of the knife. The denouement. The straw
that broke this somewhat-less-frothy
camel's back.
They sold the Volvo.
Not just any Volvo. Not just any car.
They sold the car that was my childhood.
The car that traveled with my family as we
made the jump up the food chain from
backwater LeClaire, lowa — gene pool of
one — to goose-stepping Orange County,
California. The car that shuttled me from
diving practice to gymnastics workouts to
10-K races as a hyperactive 10-year-old
parental nightmare. The car that plagued
my existence as a snot-nosed 14-year-old,
as I matched my socks with my hair thin
gies with my glitter nail polish.
For $20, they sold the Volvo.
They can deny their subtle expulsion of

their youngest daughter from their home
and hearts no longer. Like some cold, cap
italistic, savings-and-loanesque squander
ing of my life savings of memories, my par
ents sold away my childhood. For less than
a dinner for two at the Sundance Mine
Co., they kicked my past through the
uprights, out of the stadium. And there's
no home-field advantage in this game to
keep me in the game for one last drive.
How can I convince them that the
Tequila Sunrise paint job, which was only
fashionable for one decade out of the his
tory of man, is still somewhat attractive?
How do I tell them that the multiple shop
ping-cart pock marks which sprinkled its
complexion added character to the Volvo's
hulking 1974 frame? How do I tell them
that the destruction of the field mice
colony which has called the car's engine
home for the last five years would be an
act of unforgivable genocide?
I can't, because they sold it.
Sold the car they gave to my brother for
his 16th birthday along with ajar of Turtle
Wax — which only accentuated the vomito
ry color-selection-market-researching skills

of Swedish engineers. The car they took
back two weeks later when my dad changed
jobs and gave back the company Oldsmo
bile. The car which my dad drove long after
he had the capital to invest in something
more distinguished and less repulsive, like
the Pinto he bought for mom.
It's all gone now. Gone are the morn
ings the Volvo would stall on the way to
school, sputtering across six lanes of 55-
mile-an-hour traffic — as my dad and I
stared like deer caught in the headlights of
the oncoming cars. Gone are the terrifying
moments I spent pleading with him to drop
me off a quarter-mile from school instead
of rumbling up to the curb in an act of
social hari-kari. Gone the family outings
spent barfing our tonsils out, trying to
scream conversations over the gentle, ear
drum-annihilating purr of the engine.
Life is no longer worth living.
