## Parker is leader and mentor for Cardinal

Brooklyn, New York. Locals will tell you
to love it or get out of their face.
Tyrone Parker left it so he could get in
other people's faces — as a football defensive
lineman at Stanford University.
"Nothing beats competition, knowing
that if you don't do your best, you're going to
get your butt kicked," said Parker.
Parker has been a steady competitor for
the Cardinal. Since the middle of the 1991
season, he has started 28 consecutive games.
That streak was thought to be in jeopardy
last spring, when Parker suffered a broken
left fibula and ligament damage to his left
ankle in a scrimmage. But Parker was deter
mined to be in the lineup, and though not
100 percent, he took his place at left end for
the season opener.
"The leg is getting better," Parker said.
"The bye week did it some good but it's still
quite sore."
Parker, a fifth-year senior, recognized
that his presence on the line was important.
With seven defensive starters lost from last
year's team, Parker was needed both as a
leader and a mentor for the younger players.
"Good teams learn just as much from the
players as from the coaches, and that's the
same on any level," Parker said. "This year's
group doesn't have as much experience as
last year's, and so you don't have a lot of that
on the sidelines."
"He is our team leader and he's just a

marvelous guy," said head coach Bill Walsh.
"His problem is that he is still suffering from
an ankle problem he had last spring, so he
hasn't been nearly up to his potential. But
his leadership is outstanding and I don't
know what we'd do without him."
Parker knows the value of leadership. He
has witnessed the transformation in atti
tude of the Stanford football team first-hand
since arriving on campus in 1989.
"You go from two losing seasons with a
bunch of guys who basically didn't care how
the team did — they just wanted to play and
get through the program and do their four
years," Parker said. "The (recruiting) class
of 1988 and '89 came in and wanted to
change that. In 1990 we started turning it
around, in 1991 we went to the Aloha Bowl
and got a little bit better, and 1992 was the
culmination of that goal. Now we're in the
process of starting it over again."
Parker takes great pride in the
turnaround, and remembers with fondness
last year's defensive unit, which ended the
season ranked 10th in the nation in total
defense.
"Those guys were — I wouldn't say my
brothers — but we were damn close," Park
er said. "We played together for two years,
and none of us ever missed a game. It's very
rare to get a bunch of guys that play that
much together and stay together without
getting hurt and I was just fortunate to be a
part of that.
