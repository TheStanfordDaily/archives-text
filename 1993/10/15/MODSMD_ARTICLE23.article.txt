There's one thing the Stanford
women's volleyball team hopes to
come out of its next two matches
with — confidence.
"I think morale is in a state of
limbo right now," said senior tri
captain Heidi Eick "On one side we
did a lot of things much better than
we had before but we also know
there's a lot we need to work on."

After last weekend's mixed
results — a win over then-second
ranked Texas followed by a loss to
then-No. 11 University of Pacific in
the Stanford/Bank of America Invi
tational — the No. 3 Cardinal (12-3,
5-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference) is
hoping for a weekend sweep to boost
morale, not to mention its record.
Entering the second half of its
Pac-10 schedule, Stanford will host
No. 23 Oregon State (12-4, 5-2 in
the Pac-10) tonight at 7 p.m. in

Maples Pavilion, followed by Ore
gon (4-11, 1-6 in the Pac-10) at the
sarm ■ > on Saturday.
>al we set for ourselves
after last weekend was to make sure
we're ready to play both nights,"
said head coach Don Shaw. "We
were a little bit up and down over
the weekend against Texas and
UOP; we need to be better at play
ing back-to-back nights — regard
less of the opposition."
While two traditionally weak

Pac-10 opponents could easily be
blown off by the defending national
champions, the Cardinal is not
about to take this weekend lightly.
Oregon State comes into the match
tied with Stanford and filth-ranked
USC for second place in the Pac-10.
The biggest surprise in the confer
ence this year, the Beavers not only
upset USC earlier in the season but
have also downed Washington State
