# Oregon schools come to Maples for two
## Third-ranked spikers to face Beavers and Ducks tonight and tomorrow 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
There's one thing the Stanford
women's volleyball team hopes to
come out of its next two matches
with — confidence.
"I think morale is in a state of
limbo right now," said senior tri
captain Heidi Eick "On one side we
did a lot of things much better than
we had before but we also know
there's a lot we need to work on."

After last weekend's mixed
results — a win over then-second
ranked Texas followed by a loss to
then-No. 11 University of Pacific in
the Stanford/Bank of America Invi
tational — the No. 3 Cardinal (12-3,
5-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference) is
hoping for a weekend sweep to boost
morale, not to mention its record.
Entering the second half of its
Pac-10 schedule, Stanford will host
No. 23 Oregon State (12-4, 5-2 in
the Pac-10) tonight at 7 p.m. in

Maples Pavilion, followed by Ore
gon (4-11, 1-6 in the Pac-10) at the
sarm ■ > on Saturday.
>al we set for ourselves
after last weekend was to make sure
we're ready to play both nights,"
said head coach Don Shaw. "We
were a little bit up and down over
the weekend against Texas and
UOP; we need to be better at play
ing back-to-back nights — regard
less of the opposition."
While two traditionally weak

Pac-10 opponents could easily be
blown off by the defending national
champions, the Cardinal is not
about to take this weekend lightly.
Oregon State comes into the match
tied with Stanford and filth-ranked
USC for second place in the Pac-10.
The biggest surprise in the confer
ence this year, the Beavers not only
upset USC earlier in the season but
have also downed Washington State
and Arizona, both ranked in the top
25.
"Both teams have a lot of new
faces," Shaw said. "I think their fresh
men are making a lot of impact. Older
players who have lost to us year after
year tend to take a defeatist attitude
but the younger players come in with
new attitudes; that's what we're
going to come up against."
Oregon will be attempting to
secure its sixth conference win for the
first time in team history. The

Beavers are led by their outside hit
ters, junior Shelly Smith and fresh
man Rachel Hochgesang. Hitter
Stacey Holley and middle hitter Staci
Hintze, both freshmen, are also
expected to contribute to the youthful
Beaver attack.
Sitting in eighth place in the Pac
-10, the Ducks have only come out
ahead in one game this year, not
counting their match victory over
last-place Washington. Middle block
er Karissa Meith is currently second
in the conference with 78 blocks and
is hitting .209 with 176 kills. Laßeina
Woods heads Oregon's attack with
126 kills for a .227 hitting percentage.
