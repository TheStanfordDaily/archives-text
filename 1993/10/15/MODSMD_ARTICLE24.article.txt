# No. 1 polo heads west to play Davis, UOP
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
For the third consecutive week, the top
ranked Stanford water polo team will take to the
road, visiting No. 12 UC-Davis on Saturday and
No. 4 Pacific on Sunday.
The Cardinal (14-1 overall, 2-0 in the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) is coming off a
first-place finish at the Northern California
Tournament last weekend. Stanford completed
their perfect 6-0 tourney with a 9-7 victory over
California in the championship match.
Saturday, the Cardinal faces a young Aggie
squad. While Davis lacks the experience of other
top-ranked teams, Stanford coaches and players
will not look past the Aggies to Sunday's match

up with UOP.
Head coach Dante Dettamanti plans to use his
entire lineup against Davis in an effort to keep
players strong for Sunday's game.
The match against the Tigers will be the sec
ond between the two teams in the span of a week.
Stanford defeated UOP 8-6 last Saturday in Nor-
Cal Tournament play.
The Tigers made the jump to No. 4 after post
ing a third-place finish at the NorCal Tourna
ment. UOP (10-3 overall) proved resilient in tight
games, as they narrowly defeated USC 9-8 and
UCLA 10-9.
"UOP will be a tough game," Dettamanti said.
"We beat them 8-6 last weekend after leading by
four at one point. We're playing a good team in
their pool, which can be tough."

One reason for the Tigers' success, especially
in close matches, is their speed. UOP is led on the
counter-attack by drivers Brad Schumacher and
Todd Hosmer.
"They both are very fast and can shoot the ball
extremely well from the outside," said sopho
more Jeremy Laster. "Our goal is to try to con
tain them."
Dettamanti is also concerned with the health
of his players, especially juniors Wolf Wigo (back)
and Frank Schneider (shoulder). Both third-year
starters are nursing injuries which date back to
last season.
Dettamanti, while happy with his team's per
formance, is quick to remind them of their goals.
"Right now, we want to stay
healthy and maintain our posi
tion," Dettamanti said. "We
want to have a great record
when the NCAA gives the seed
ings for the tournament. If we
have a few losses, the NCAA
has to make a decision, and
sometimes it's not a decision
you like. We have a chance to
take it out of their hands, to
remove any doubt that we
should be No. 1."
