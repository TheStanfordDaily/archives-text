# Men's soccer looks for Biblical intervention

The Stanford men's soccer squad ought to
bring a slingshot when they travel to Seattle today
to play the rugged University of Washington
Huskies.
This one is looking like a rematch of David vs.
Goliath.
"They're one of the top teams in the division,"
said head coach Colin Lindores on the 7-3-2

Huskies, whom Stanford will play before they
meet Oregon State on Sunday. "We're basically
going to try and avoid losing."
A simple philosophy, but one that the strug
gling Cardinal (2-8-1) is having trouble following.
Today's match against Washington will be Stan
ford's third Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
game, and the squad is already 0-2 in the confer
ence and virtually out of playoff contention.
"We're going to try to eliminate the glaring
errors on defense," Lindores said. "It's been a

mixed bag. There's not just one major error, but
when you patch one up something else seems to
pop up."
Washington holds a 9-5 advantage over Stan
ford in the all-time series, and the Huskies enter
the game with a 13-game unbeaten streak at
home. They also boast All-American senior goal
keeper Dusty Hudock, who has compiled a 1.18
goals-against average in 1993.
"This team is big physically, and they don't give
up many goals," senior forward Rick Goad said of
the Huskies. "They're certainly not going to beat
themselves."
The job of beating Washington is left to the Car
dinal, who lost both games to the Huskies last year
in 1-0 overtime matches. Both Stanford and
Washington played in the Met Life Classic in Nor
folk, Va., in late September. At that tourney the
Huskies and Cardinal both lost to the same two
teams and were eliminated from play.
"They're definitely a good team, but they didn't
look incredibly powerful," said midfielder Ryan
Collins of this year's Washington squad. "We have
nothing to lose, so we can play and not really worry
about anything. It's not going to kill our record."
Following their tough match against the
Huskies, the Cardinal will travel to CorvallLs on
Sunday to take on Oregon State (3-6). The Beavers
have not been a force in the conference this year,
but Stanford does not want to be surprised.
"They're a run-and-gun type of rah-rah college
team," Goad said. "They're good and home, and
it's going to take a good effort on our part to beat
them."
The Cardinal's concern over the Oregon State
game is due in part to the debilitating effect of road
trips.
"This is our last long road trip, and in the sec
ond game people tend to let up," Goad said.
But the Cardinal recognizes there's no true for
mula for guaranteeing a victory. "There are weak
er teams out there than OSU, but we should get a
win," Goad said. "I just can't figure out this sport
anymore. I'm going to retire and move it out to
pasture."
The Cardinal still have to make it through this
final four-game road trip before they can think
about returning home and living a life of restful
grazing.

have much less room to maneuver against Washington today.
