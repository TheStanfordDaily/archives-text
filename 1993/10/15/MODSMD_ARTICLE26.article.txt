# Soccer faces Duke, mind on Carolina
## 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
The University of North Car
olina's women's soccer team suf
fered its last loss three years ago
in Storrs, Conn. This weekend,
Stanford will get its chance to
dethrone the reigning queens of
the women's soccer world at the
Challenge Club College Tourna
ment in Houston, Texas.
However, before the sixth
ranked Cardinal (10-1-1) tangle
with the Tar Heels (10-0), it
meets the eighth-ranked Duke
Blue Devils (9-3-1) Friday at
noon. Stanford then gets its shot
at the the nation's No. 1 team and
seven-time national champion at
9 a.m. Sunday.
Despite only being in its sixth
year of varsity action, Duke
brings a talented squad against
Stanford. However, the Blue
Devils usually start seven or eight
freshmen and sophomores and
have been troubled with inconsis
tencies due to inexperience.
Although Duke lost five senior
starters from a team that was last
year's national championship
runner-up, it has stayed competi
tive and will pose a difficult obsta
cle for the Cardinal, according to
senior forward Sarah Rafanelli.
Although Stanford cannot
afford to look past Duke to Sun
day's match-up, it can't help but
notice the Tar Heels' awe-inspir
ing team.
"We're very excited to play
Carolina," said senior forward
Sarah Rafanelli. "The whole
team is a little nervous, and we
just have to focus and concen
trate on playing well, not on play
ing North Carolina."
Last year, a 10-0 Cardinal
team lost to North Carolina 5-0
in a mid-season Ragnarok
between the country's top two
teams. Now, the Tar Heels ride
an NCAA-record 68-game win

ning streak into this weekend's
tournament. This run may be
extended to 69 after North Car
olina faces Notre Dame, the
fourth team in the tournament,
Friday afternoon.
Although the Tar Heels bring
in pages of records and numerous
Ail-Americans to this weekend's
tournament, they have been vul
nerable this year. In a game
against then-fourth-ranked San
ta Clara earlier this year, North
Carolina fell behind 2-0 at half
time before rallying to a 3-2 win.
It was the first time the Tar Heels
had been down by two goals since
1985, when they fell 2-0 to
George Mason.
"Carolina is struggling, and
they know it," said senior goal
keeper Leslie Garrard. "I've
heard that they have been train
ing very hard all week, and are a
little scared of us."
North Carolina officials recog
nize the difference in this year's
team from past years. "We're defi
nitely not what we were last year,"
said Tar Heel Assistant Sports
Information Director Steve Kirsh
ner. "We've had some difficulties
finishing scoring chances."
Along with their Lou Holtzian
air of rhetoric, the North Carolina
team does have a visible weak
ness. They will be without the ser
vices of junior midfielder Tisha
Venturini, a two-time first team
All-American. Venturini, who had
eight goals and two assists in
eight games, is out indefinitely
with a broken bone in her foot.
However, the Tar Heels will
still have the tremendously tal
ented Mia Hamm prowling
around the Stanford goalbox.
Last year's National Player of the
Year, the senior forward has
scored 11 goals and five assists
this year. As the nation's top
scorer last year, she set a scoring
record with 32 goals and 33
assists for 97 total points.
