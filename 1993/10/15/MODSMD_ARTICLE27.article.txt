# Running with the best
## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
Since Stanford began its cross
country season over a month ago,
the Cardinal's men's and women's
teams have finished no worse than
second in any of their competitions.
Even solid rivals such as UCLA and
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo have not
provided the surging Stanford
squads with a true test.
That will change soon, however,
when the Cardinal runs in the
Michigan Invitational this Sunday.
Featuring seven top-25 squads in
both the men's and women's races,
the Michigan Invite will be a
national-caliber race bearing impli
cations on the NCAA champi
onship meet in November.
Numerically speaking, the 11th
ranked Stanford women will con
front the greater challenge. They

will face third-ranked Michigan, co-
No. 9's Alabama and Notre Dame,
13th-ranked Colorado, 18th
ranked Virginia and No. 19 Dart
mouth. However, the No. 15 Cardi
nal men will not run a easy path,
either. Seventh-ranked Colorado,
lOth-ranked Notre Dame, No. 11
Michipm, No. 18 Dartmouth, No.
21 William and Mary and No. 22
Tennessee will present ample com
petition. In all, 14 men's teams and
10 women's teams will take part in
the Invitational.
"The Michigan event will be a
preview of NCAAs in quality of
competitors and number of com
petitors," said All-American senior
men's captain Gary Stolz. It is pre
cisely these qualities that make the
Michigan Invite a much-anticipat
ed event for Stanford, which looks
to assert itself Sunday.
