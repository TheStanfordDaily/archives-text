# Running with the best
## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
Since Stanford began its cross
country season over a month ago,
the Cardinal's men's and women's
teams have finished no worse than
second in any of their competitions.
Even solid rivals such as UCLA and
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo have not
provided the surging Stanford
squads with a true test.
That will change soon, however,
when the Cardinal runs in the
Michigan Invitational this Sunday.
Featuring seven top-25 squads in
both the men's and women's races,
the Michigan Invite will be a
national-caliber race bearing impli
cations on the NCAA champi
onship meet in November.
Numerically speaking, the 11th
ranked Stanford women will con
front the greater challenge. They

will face third-ranked Michigan, co-
No. 9's Alabama and Notre Dame,
13th-ranked Colorado, 18th
ranked Virginia and No. 19 Dart
mouth. However, the No. 15 Cardi
nal men will not run a easy path,
either. Seventh-ranked Colorado,
lOth-ranked Notre Dame, No. 11
Michipm, No. 18 Dartmouth, No.
21 William and Mary and No. 22
Tennessee will present ample com
petition. In all, 14 men's teams and
10 women's teams will take part in
the Invitational.
"The Michigan event will be a
preview of NCAAs in quality of
competitors and number of com
petitors," said All-American senior
men's captain Gary Stolz. It is pre
cisely these qualities that make the
Michigan Invite a much-anticipat
ed event for Stanford, which looks
to assert itself Sunday.
"I look for the men to finish in
the top five," said head coach Vin
Lananna. " I look for the women to
finish in the top three."
A strong performance would
enhance the Cardinal's chances of
qualifying for the NCAAs. The
country is divided into eight dis
tricts, and the top two squads from
each district automatically
advance to the national meet.
However, six at-large teams will
also be selected on the basis of
their performance against national

powers outside of their respective
districts. Thus, even if the Cardi
nal does not place at least second
at the district race, a high finish in
an inter-district meet like the
Michigan Invite would give Stan
ford an argument for an at-large
selection.
Also, the Michigan Invite will
be important in terms of the Car
dinal's preparation for the Pacific
10 Championships Oct. 30 and the
Districts meet Nov. 13.
"The Michigan meet represents
the midpoint of the season,"
Lananna said. "By now, top run
ners have been selected, and we
can test them and groom them for
running in big meets."

Defending District-8 champion
Louise Watson also commented on
the preparatory aspects of the
Michigan race.
"I feel so much better now,"
Watson said. "I'm a lot stronger
I than I was two weeks ago) and in
control. Thus will be a time for me
to reflect on my training, boost my
confidence and reestablish myself.
There are no expectations, the
pressure's off and I can just pre
pare."
Despite such words, however,
high placement definitely lurks in
the Cardinal's mind.
"If we have everyone running at
their best," Watson said, "we're in
there with a shout."
