# Searching for victory on the diamond
## 
### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
As the Toronto Blue Jays —
Philadelphia Phillies World Series
gets underway tomorrow evening, I,
in my Greek wisdom, thought it
appropriate to enlist as my guest
someone who knows a little bit
about baseball and football. Since
Bo Jackson is still mourning his col
lapse in the American League
Championship Series, I grabbed the
best resource I could find on campus
— the Cardinal baseball coaching
staff.
After tying Dean of Students
Michael Jackson at a break-even 4-4
last week, however, my cumulative
record stands at 8-10 — a notch
below my guests' combined 9-9
mark and well below the standard
for admission to the George
Stephanopoulos Fan Club. As a
penalty for my inability to stay above
.500, the baseball office referred me
not to the head coach, but rather to
assistant Dean Stotz. A knowledge
able fan, Stotz provides a formidable
challenge to yours truly as we keep
the Dean theme alive.
So, with hopes that I don't get
flattened into a pita (again), lines
from Wednesday's Chronicle and
home teams in CAPS, here goes
nothing:
ARIZONA —10 vs. Stanford
Andy: Stanford +10. A week off
means Bill Walsh has probably fig
ured out the Wildcats' stingy
defense by now. As for the Cardinal
defenders ... well, thank goodness

for point spread#.
Dean: Stanford +10. "Stanford will
win the game outright," Stotz pre
dicted. I hope so; we finished a paltry
77th in "alumni satisfaction" in the
recent U.S. News and World Report
survey, and a loss here might send
us even lower.

UCLA -1-1/2 vs. Washington
Andy: Washington +1-1/2. I have
not retracted my statement about
being a believer in the Bruins. It's
just that the Huskies are, well, the
Huskies, and what's wrong with the
occasional exception?
Dean: Washington +1-1/2. Stotz
scored one for the Huskies' recent
tradition and mentioned rather
astutely that this will mark their
only Rose Bowl appearance of the
season. Score one for Dean.
USC —22 vs. Oregon State
Andy: Oregon State +22. No, I am
not kidding. The Beavers have
already tallied three — count 'em,
three — victories this season. True,
they have beaten Larry, Curly and
Moe (in that order), but I still do not
see the Trojans covering this gigan

tic spread.
Dean: Oregon State +22. Referring
to OSU's Stone Age offense, Stotz
said that the Beavers will dam the
Trojan floodgates, using a single
wing tactic similar to basketball's
"four corners" if necessary. Ah,
strategy.

ARIZONA STATE -2 vs. Ore
gon
Andy: Oregon +2. One of the few
constants I have discovered in this
seat-of-the-pants line of work is that
the Sun Devils do not scare anybody.
First Oregon State survived its trial
by fire, then Washington State.
Now, in a very chic Anaheimesque
way, the Ducks get to play angels.
Dean: Arizona State —2. "The Sun
Devils have one chance left to res
urrect a dismal season," Stotz said.
Sorry, Dean, but it will be a cold
day in Chem 130 before that hap
pens.
PENN STATE —6 vs. Michigan
Andy: Penn State —6. Nittany
Lions coach Joe Paterno should
leave his first meeting with the
Wolverines Happy as a Valley. Penn

State's home date against one of its
toughest Big Ten foes translates into
a favorite's role in the Rose Bowl
race.
Dean: Penn State —6. Stotz men
tioned what those who saw last
week's Michigan-Michigan State
score should know already; beyond
star running back Tyrone Wheatley,
the Wolverines are no more than a
handy snack.
ALABAMA -5-1/2 vs. Ten
nfuicAo
iicacHX
Andy: Tennessee -1-5-1/2. Speaking
of snacks, Volunteers quarterback
Heath Shuler has been whetting the
appetites of Heisman voters all sea
son. Now comes his chance to close
some ground on Charlie Ward while
stemming the Crimson Tide's
momentum.
Dean: Alabama -5-1/2. With the
SEC record for consecutive confer
ence victories at stake, 'Bama will
roll, according to Stotz. Where's
your imagination, coach?
OKLAHOMA —5 vs. Colorado
Andy: Oklahoma —5. I came home
from the MCAT on Sept. 18, turned
on the tube and watched our Cardi
nal rip the Buffaloes apart. Some
things haven't changed since then,
which is why the Sooners will have
very little difficulty maintaining
their perfect record.
Dean: Oklahoma —5. "Colorado
doesn't know what defense is for,"
Stotz said. Couldn't have said it any
better myself.

fiends, but Emmitt and the Cowboys
are bade So don't nominate Steve
Young and his Dan Quayle looks for
president just yet; as Sunday will reaf
firm that your dynasty has gone the
way of Linda Evans' career.

role, would not need the points to win

Andy: Tennessee -1-5-1/2. Speaking
of snacks, Volunteers quarterback
Heath Shuler has been whetting the
appetites of Heisman voters all sea
son. Now comes his chance to close
some ground on Charlie Ward while
stemming the Crimson Tide's
momentum.
Dean: Alabama -5-1/2. With the
SEC record for consecutive confer
ence victories at stake, 'Bama will
roll, according to Stotz. Where's
your imagination, coach?
OKLAHOMA —5 vs. Colorado
Andy: Oklahoma —5. I came home
from the MCAT on Sept. 18, turned
on the tube and watched our Cardi
nal rip the Buffaloes apart. Some
things haven't changed since then,
which is why the Sooners will have
very little difficulty maintaining
their perfect record.
Dean: Oklahoma —5. "Colorado
doesn't know what defense is for,"
Stotz said. Couldn't have said it any
better myself.

DALLAS—6*I/2 vs. San Francisco
Andy: Dallas -6-1/2. Sorry, you 49ers
fiends, but Emmitt and the Cowboys
are bade So don't nominate Steve
Young and his Dan Quayle looks for
president just yet; as Sunday will reaf
firm that your dynasty has gone the
way of Linda Evans' career.

that the Niners, in a rare underdog
role, would not need the points to win
You're right, Dean. They would need
landmines
As the Toronto Blue Jays —
Philadelphia Phillies World Series
gets underway tomorrow evening, I,
in my Greek wisdom, thought it
appropriate to enlist as my guest
someone who knows a little bit
about baseball and football. Since
Bo Jackson is still mourning his col
lapse in the American League
Championship Series, I grabbed the
best resource I could find on campus
— the Cardinal baseball coaching
staff.
After tying Dean of Students
Michael Jackson at a break-even 4-4
last week, however, my cumulative
record stands at 8-10 — a notch
below my guests' combined 9-9
mark and well below the standard
for admission to the George
Stephanopoulos Fan Club. As a
penalty for my inability to stay above
.500, the baseball office referred me
not to the head coach, but rather to
assistant Dean Stotz. A knowledge
able fan, Stotz provides a formidable
challenge to yours truly as we keep
the Dean theme alive.
So, with hopes that I don't get
flattened into a pita (again), lines
from Wednesday's Chronicle and
home teams in CAPS, here goes
nothing:
ARIZONA —10 vs. Stanford
Andy: Stanford +10. A week off
means Bill Walsh has probably fig
ured out the Wildcats' stingy
defense by now. As for the Cardinal
defenders ... well, thank goodness

for point spread#.
Dean: Stanford +10. "Stanford will
win the game outright," Stotz pre
dicted. I hope so; we finished a paltry
77th in "alumni satisfaction" in the
recent U.S. News and World Report
survey, and a loss here might send
us even lower.

UCLA -1-1/2 vs. Washington
Andy: Washington +1-1/2. I have
not retracted my statement about
being a believer in the Bruins. It's
just that the Huskies are, well, the
Huskies, and what's wrong with the
occasional exception?
Dean: Washington +1-1/2. Stotz
scored one for the Huskies' recent
tradition and mentioned rather
astutely that this will mark their
only Rose Bowl appearance of the
season. Score one for Dean.
USC —22 vs. Oregon State
Andy: Oregon State +22. No, I am
not kidding. The Beavers have
already tallied three — count 'em,
three — victories this season. True,
they have beaten Larry, Curly and
Moe (in that order), but I still do not
see the Trojans covering this gigan

tic spread.
Dean: Oregon State +22. Referring
to OSU's Stone Age offense, Stotz
said that the Beavers will dam the
Trojan floodgates, using a single
wing tactic similar to basketball's
"four corners" if necessary. Ah,
strategy.

ARIZONA STATE -2 vs. Ore
gon
Andy: Oregon +2. One of the few
constants I have discovered in this
seat-of-the-pants line of work is that
the Sun Devils do not scare anybody.
First Oregon State survived its trial
by fire, then Washington State.
Now, in a very chic Anaheimesque
way, the Ducks get to play angels.
Dean: Arizona State —2. "The Sun
Devils have one chance left to res
urrect a dismal season," Stotz said.
Sorry, Dean, but it will be a cold
day in Chem 130 before that hap
pens.
PENN STATE —6 vs. Michigan
Andy: Penn State —6. Nittany
Lions coach Joe Paterno should
leave his first meeting with the
Wolverines Happy as a Valley. Penn

State's home date against one of its
toughest Big Ten foes translates into
a favorite's role in the Rose Bowl
race.
