# Earthquake costs will reach $157M
## Lack of funding could delay many projects, Casper says 
### Skip Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Nearly four years after the dev
astating Loma Prieta Earth
quake, Stanford still has more
than $157 million in earthquake
repair and structural enhance
ment costs ahead, University
President Gerhard Casper an
nounced to the Faculty Senate
yesterday.
Despite the fact that Stanford
has "clear plans" for the earth
quake renovation projects, Casper
said the University faces an un
certainty regarding where a ma
jority of the money will come
from, meaning "construction on
any of the main projects is not

likely to begin soon."
The extensive renovation pro
jects will begin "the minute we
feel we are comfortable about ei
ther having raised the money or
will be able to raise it, or we have
achieved the right balance be
tween indebtedness and re
sources," he said.
According to Casper, the pro
jected costs include $35 million
for Green Library, $29 million for
the Stanford Museum and more
than $22 million for the Quad's
Language and Geology Corners.
Additional costs will be in
curred as the University reno
vates many buildings in order to
bring them up to new standards.
The work must be completed by
the year 2000, the year the new
Santa Clara County building
codes — instigated by Loma Pri
eta — take effect, Provost Con
doleezza Rice said after the meet
ing.
Rice said the University
worked over the summer to final
ize renovation and enhancement
costs, previously estimated to be
about $120 million.
"The extent of the problem is
extraordinary," Casper said at the
meeting.
Casper commented that the
extent of damage and delay in
repairs has been one of his biggest
surprises since coming to Stan
ford. Saying the problem has even
caught the attention of the U.S.
Senate, Casper read a paragraph
from a Senate Appropriations
Committee report which specifi
cally mentions its dismay with
Stanford's problem in receiving
federal money.
He added that "the most diffi
cult aspect of trying to do some
thing has been [the Federal

Emergency Management Agen
cy]," which, he added, is "excruci
atingly difficult and bureaucrat
ic."
The University is currently in
the process of negotiating with
FEMA for the amount of money
the University will receive to deal
with the costs.
According to Casper, Uni
versity foresees getting $62 mil
lion from FEMA, University
reserves and gifts to cover the
expenses. He added, however,
that "no [financial] commitment
from FEMA is ever really firm."
This leaves Stanford with just
under a $100 million shortfall,
which is delaying any imminent
major construction work. After
the meeting, Rice said that one
way the University will try to
raise this money is through
"fund raising and other sources,"
which could include borrowing
money.
Responding to a question from
Biology Prof. Robert Simoni,
Casper said one of the greatest
uncertainties for Stanford is the
fact that it has no earthquake
insurance but rather a form of
"self-insurance."
John Shoven, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, said that the costs of hav

ing insurance — which include a
$100 million deductible and $5
million premium — outweigh the
risk of not having it.
Casper said that he and Rice
are working to ensure that future
University budgets set aside a
substantial amount for plant
reserves, something that has not
been done in the past.
Shoven added that the best
risk-management policy the Uni
versity could undertake would be
to work as quickly as possible to
upgrade campus buildings, there
by ensuring as little damage as
possible in the future.
Casper said a letter from the
French and Italian Department
brought the matter of slow earth
quake repairs to his attention.
The letter said that the depart
ment feels "far from the center of
University life" in its temporary
office in the Wilbur Modules.
Nelee Langmuir, a senior lec
turer in this department, said the
members of the department are
"patiently waiting ... to be closer
to the center of campus."
"I miss my old office," she said.
Casper said he is "exceedingly
sorry for the inconvenience" the
displacement resulting from the
earthquake.
After the discussion on earth

quake repairs ended, Director of
Benefits Jim Franklin unveiled
the University's new flexible-ben
efits program for faculty and
staff.
According to Franklin, this
program will prove to be better
than the current one in that it
offers more health-plan choices to
those who work for Stanford. The
current plan will no longer be
offered, he said.
History Prof. Judith Brown,
chair of the Committee on Facul
ty and Staff Benefits, said the
plan is being offered to meet the
changing needs of Stanford's
diversified work force. She added
that this will allow for a "change
in Stanford's relations to its
employees from parental to that
of a partner."
The plan, which will continue
to cover those under the current
system, provides faculty and staff
with a wide range of choices for all
aspects of health care, including
an option for a maximum of $25
cash back per pay period.
Franklin said that educating
the faculty and staff about the
plan will continue this month,
and enrollment will begin in
November. The plan is scheduled
to take effect Jan. 1, Franklin
said.
