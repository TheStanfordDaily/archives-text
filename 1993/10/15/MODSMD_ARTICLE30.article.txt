[It's a shiny, warm Saturday afternoon and many of
Stanford's chipper students have gathered to the sunken
diamond to watch the first baseball game of the season. The
Beavers lead the Cardinal 3-1 In the third Inning.
As she works her way through the stands, a perky mem
ber of the Mu Epsllon sorority recognizes out of the crowd
a guy whose friend she once dated. She sits herself down
next to the rather beefy member of the Delta Omega fra
ternity, who, himself, Is well on his way to utter inebria
tion. The Mu speaks with a heavy blond accent.)

Ma Bpsilon: Hey dude, wasaup?
Delta Omega: Nothln' much, but he's out there.

pronunciation] Du —ude — he's awsome.

DO: I sure did. [slurp] Dude's on first.
MB: Come again?
DO: Dude's on first.
MB: [points to first base] Him?
DO: Uh, yeah. Dude.
BAB: [squints to see him better] He looks so much like
this dude I once hooked up with.
DO: He Is Dude.
BAB: Really?
DO: Catching.
MB: What?
DO: You said Really. He's the catcher.
