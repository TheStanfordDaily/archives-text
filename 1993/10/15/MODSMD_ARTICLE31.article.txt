# Cosmic failure in an impassible universe
## 
### 
There's only one thing worse than taking a
course called "Cosmic Horizons," and
that's failing it. I'm guilty of both.
Actually, I didn't really fail "Cosmic Horizons,"
I no-credited it. As most people know, that means
it won't show up on my transcript. Thank heav
ens, or at least the nebulae that comprise them.
It had started off so innocently. I still remem
ber the abstract in Courses and Degrees describ
ing black holes, pulsars and the development of
life. It sounded like sex. Admittedly, I was a wee
bit influenced by "Cosmic Horizons"' reputation
as being intended for people whose knowledge of
science didn't extend beyond Spock's ear wax.
On the first day of class, I encountered the
first of many obstacles in my budding astronom
ic career: finding the classroom. I had never
entered techie-town before. Thus, I was a
stranger in a strange land, and only after wan
dering into some '70s retro room called the
"Explorarama" did I find my way.
By the time I arrived I was already twenty
minutes late. And before taking my seat I man
aged to trip over a seeing-eye dog (I later nick
named him Sputlick.) I found myself surrounded
by just the type of students most conducive to my
getting good grades — football players. In fact,
judging from the fact that his neck was as wide as
his head, the professor appeared to be an ex-tack
le himself. If I could only pass myself off as a
punter, I thought, I could ace this class.
Before I knew it, the lights had dimmed and a
film explaining the virtues of scientific notation
began. In it, we saw a couple picnicking happily,
when our camera focus moved away by increasing
powers of 10. "Dave and Sheila are now lunching
at 10 to the first. At 10 to the second we can make
out Chicago, the site of their picnic. Now, it's 10 to

the third and we see all of I.ake Michigan. While
at 10 to the fourth ..By 10 to the sixth power,
the camera was somewhere in outer space and so
was 1.1 hadn't slept so soundly since CIV.
This was my kind of class. I didn't even need
to go, since the professor provided lecture notes.
Later, however, the class proved more ambitious
than I had reckoned, which meant that no more
movies were shown. Going into the first of two
mid-terms I can't say I was confident.

I did feel more secure once I got back that first
exam. I received a 16 out of 25, which my calcu
lator told me was equivalent to 64 percent. In
most classes, 64 percent means an F, but not so
in "Cosmic Horizons," where it meant I had
scored two points above the mean.
From then on, I ignored the problem sets and
rarely attended lectures. I was inadvertently dis
tancing myself from our cosmos. But there was
nothing to worry about. Afler all, / had scored a
16. I was on my way to becoming an astrophysi
cist. I was invincible. I was Albert Einstein rein
carnated with better hair.
Lulled into a false sense of security, I sank to a
9.5 — 38 percent — on the next exam. That isn't
so bad when you consider Bill Clinton won the
presidency with almost the same percentage. My
professor obviously didn't follow politics, and
thus scribbled an ominous note at the bottom of

my exam: You are cutting it a bit close for pass
ing, so don 7 slack offtcx) much on the final. Ques
tions? See me. R.R.
Unfortunately, I didn't see that message until
the night before the final. The words hit me like
a dwarf star colliding into my corona.
I was desperate. Viewed at 10 to the first I was
slumped to my knees, pounding the cold blue
earth. But my problems paled when I remembered
that at 10 to the ninth, I was but a small speck in
a monstrous galaxy, one filled with countless other
dust particles scoring below the mean.
I sat there for three hours and debated
whether a low mass star in the red giant stage is
about to become a black hole or a french cruller.
And all for do-naught.
But I still had one more card up my sleeve — the
sympathy pipy. I called up my professor to see by
how many points I had failed. Not by much, he
said, then added that I would have passed if I'd
completed the problem sets. Thanks, perfesser.
I proceeded to deliver an Academy-Award
winning spiel about how sorry I was to have
wasted his time and what a "stellar" professor he
was. By the time I finished, there was silence on
the other end. I could just see him, all 300 pounds
of him, dabbing his eyes with a handkerchief.
The man must have thought he was still play
ing football, though, because he wouldn't budge.
"Well," I said to him, "I guess I'll see you in 'Cos
mic Horizons' next spring." He seemed a little
taken aback, but he would have been even more
surprised if he'd heard all the expletives I yelled
into the receiver after we hung up.
So, am I going to take "Cosmic Horizons"
again in the spring?
Fat chance. I'm now enrolled in "Physics for
Poets." Wish me luck.

surprised if he'd heard all the expletives I yelled
into the receiver after we hung up.
So, am I going to take "Cosmic Horizons"
again in the spring?
Fat chance. I'm now enrolled in "Physics for
Poets." Wish me luck.

There's only one thing worse than taking a
course called "Cosmic Horizons," and
that's failing it. I'm guilty of both.
Actually, I didn't really fail "Cosmic Horizons,"
I no-credited it. As most people know, that means
it won't show up on my transcript. Thank heav
ens, or at least the nebulae that comprise them.
It had started off so innocently. I still remem
ber the abstract in Courses and Degrees describ
ing black holes, pulsars and the development of
life. It sounded like sex. Admittedly, I was a wee
bit influenced by "Cosmic Horizons"' reputation
as being intended for people whose knowledge of
science didn't extend beyond Spock's ear wax.
On the first day of class, I encountered the
first of many obstacles in my budding astronom
ic career: finding the classroom. I had never
entered techie-town before. Thus, I was a
stranger in a strange land, and only after wan
dering into some '70s retro room called the
"Explorarama" did I find my way.
By the time I arrived I was already twenty
minutes late. And before taking my seat I man
aged to trip over a seeing-eye dog (I later nick
named him Sputlick.) I found myself surrounded
by just the type of students most conducive to my
getting good grades — football players. In fact,
judging from the fact that his neck was as wide as
his head, the professor appeared to be an ex-tack
le himself. If I could only pass myself off as a
punter, I thought, I could ace this class.
Before I knew it, the lights had dimmed and a
film explaining the virtues of scientific notation
began. In it, we saw a couple picnicking happily,
when our camera focus moved away by increasing
powers of 10. "Dave and Sheila are now lunching
at 10 to the first. At 10 to the second we can make
out Chicago, the site of their picnic. Now, it's 10 to

the third and we see all of I.ake Michigan. While
at 10 to the fourth ..By 10 to the sixth power,
the camera was somewhere in outer space and so
was 1.1 hadn't slept so soundly since CIV.
This was my kind of class. I didn't even need
to go, since the professor provided lecture notes.
Later, however, the class proved more ambitious
than I had reckoned, which meant that no more
movies were shown. Going into the first of two
mid-terms I can't say I was confident.

I did feel more secure once I got back that first
exam. I received a 16 out of 25, which my calcu
lator told me was equivalent to 64 percent. In
most classes, 64 percent means an F, but not so
in "Cosmic Horizons," where it meant I had
scored two points above the mean.
From then on, I ignored the problem sets and
rarely attended lectures. I was inadvertently dis
tancing myself from our cosmos. But there was
nothing to worry about. Afler all, / had scored a
16. I was on my way to becoming an astrophysi
cist. I was invincible. I was Albert Einstein rein
carnated with better hair.
Lulled into a false sense of security, I sank to a
9.5 — 38 percent — on the next exam. That isn't
so bad when you consider Bill Clinton won the
presidency with almost the same percentage. My
professor obviously didn't follow politics, and
thus scribbled an ominous note at the bottom of

my exam: You are cutting it a bit close for pass
ing, so don 7 slack offtcx) much on the final. Ques
tions? See me. R.R.
Unfortunately, I didn't see that message until
the night before the final. The words hit me like
a dwarf star colliding into my corona.
I was desperate. Viewed at 10 to the first I was
slumped to my knees, pounding the cold blue
earth. But my problems paled when I remembered
that at 10 to the ninth, I was but a small speck in
a monstrous galaxy, one filled with countless other
dust particles scoring below the mean.
I sat there for three hours and debated
whether a low mass star in the red giant stage is
about to become a black hole or a french cruller.
And all for do-naught.
But I still had one more card up my sleeve — the
sympathy pipy. I called up my professor to see by
how many points I had failed. Not by much, he
said, then added that I would have passed if I'd
completed the problem sets. Thanks, perfesser.
I proceeded to deliver an Academy-Award
winning spiel about how sorry I was to have
wasted his time and what a "stellar" professor he
was. By the time I finished, there was silence on
the other end. I could just see him, all 300 pounds
of him, dabbing his eyes with a handkerchief.
The man must have thought he was still play
ing football, though, because he wouldn't budge.
"Well," I said to him, "I guess I'll see you in 'Cos
mic Horizons' next spring." He seemed a little
taken aback, but he would have been even more
surprised if he'd heard all the expletives I yelled
into the receiver after we hung up.
