# Golfers fall to Spartans by four in Washington
## 
### Seth Goldstein 
It just wasn't enough. Despite the best
efforts of the Stanford women's golf team,
San Jose State still finished four shots
ahead of the Cardinal to capture the 1993
Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational at thMe
Sahalee Country Club in Redmond, Wash,
on Wednesday.
The second-ranked Spartans finished
with a three-day total of 896 shots, while
No. 7 Stanford placed second with 900. Both
marks shattered the former course record of

913, set two years ago by then-No. 1 Ari
zona. Oregon and and New Mexico tied for a
distant third with 918 strokes, while No. 8
Arizona placed fifth with 921.
After two days, the Cardinal held a one-shot
lead over the field due to a fabulous second
round score of 294 â€” the low team round of
the entire tourney. However, San Jose State
came back to outshoot the Cardinal women
by five strokes in the third and final round
to take the victory.
Nevertheless, Stanford head coach Tim
Baldwin was extremely proud of his squad's

performance.
"I can't remember a tournament in
which we played better golf as a team," said
Baldwin. "Sahalee is ranked 77th in the
world and is perhaps the toughest course we
play and we just played terrifically."
However, the squad did not accomplish
everything it wanted. "Our goal was to beat
San Jose State and we didn't do that. We
didn't get the job done on the last nine
(holes) of that last round," he continued.
"It's just a matter of maturing as a team.
But we did prove that we can play with San

Jose State and we will beat them down the
road."
Individually, Stanford freshman star
Mhairi McKay finished third with 220, one
shot behind second-place Leta Lindley of
Arizona and four shots behind the winner,
Janice Moodle of San Jose State. Junior
Jamille Jose tied for fourth with a 221.
Other Stanford competitors included anoth
er freshman sensation, Andrea Baxter (18th
overall), senior Melinda Daniels (tied for
22nd) and sophomore Julie Bowen (tied for
35th).
