# Speakers discuss Middle East peace
## 
### Amanda Anbar 
About 25 students and faculty gathered in
White Plaza yesterday afternoon in an open forum
to address the justness of last month's historic
agreement for mutual recognition between Israel
and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
The program, organized by Stanford Middle
East Focus, featured Assoc. History Prof. Joel
Beinin, an expert on Middle East affairs, who was
one of three speakers. Beinin acknowledged the
many criticisms of the agreement, but focused on
the positive aspects of the agreement.
"There is not much else that could be done," he
said, emphasizing the need for peace in the Middle
East.
Calling the United States "an obstacle to
peace," Beinin criticized the government's contin
ued financial and political support of Israel's stead
fast hold on occupied territories.
Ghaida Firestone, born in Jerusalem, later a
Palestinian refugee and currently a University
library staff member, voiced her opposition to the
arrangement's provisions and the methods by
which it was reached.
She called the accords undemocratic, because of
the secrecy of the talks and the neglect of discus-

sions th t were proceeding between various peace
groups.
"They speak of Gaza, which Gaza? How much of
Gaza? Jericho, which Jericho? How much of Jeri
cho?" Firestone asked about the agreement's provi
sions. "The language is so vague, I doubt anything
concrete will form — only far more serious problems
will develop. The end does not justify the means."
Following Firestone, Rebecca Stein, a graduate
student in Modern Thought and Literature, spoke
of the need to include Arab East Jerusalem in the
Palestinian state.
"To understand the division, one must under
stand the importance of East Jerusalem. East
Jerusalem is a cultural and religious center, a
home of important educational institutions and
three hospitals, as well as the geographic center of
the West Bank. Israel must change its policy
toward East Jerusalem to get peace," Stein said.
During the second part of the program, audi
ence members were invited to speak their minds.
"I want this to be over, and if we are not engag
ing in dialogue it will never end. It's true that it was
secret, but this is the beginning. I am in favor of any
type of dialogue. It is better than nothing, and much
better than the killing," said Shelley Shick Valdes, a
junior majoring in American Studies.
