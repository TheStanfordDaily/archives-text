Stanford scientists have award
ed a $100 million subcontract to
Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. of
Sunnyvale to build a spacecraft
that will study Einstein's General
Theory of Relativity.
Stanford's High Energy Physics
Laboratory is under a $300 million
contract from NASA to develop the
probe, which will use four precise
ly-engineered gyroscopes to study
how space and time are affected by
the presence of the earth.
If everything progresses on
schedule, NASA's Gravity Probe B
satellite will be rocketed into Earth
orbit in 1999. Over its 18-month
lifetime, the 15 foot-long satellite
will study Einstein's theories on
"curved space-time," according to
Thomas Langenstein, the project's
deputy program manager.
Stanford announced Wednesday

that Lockheed will build the space
craft that will hold the experiment,
some of which has already been
built by Stanford scientists at the
High Energy Physics Laboratory.
The data from Gravity Probe B
"will either amend (Einstein's)
theory or throw out his theory,"
Langenstein explained. There have
been only three tests of the 78
year-old hypothesis.
"Einstein knew that his theory
was a little wrong," said Aeronautics
and Astronautics Prof. Brad Parkin
son, the Gravity Probe B program
manager. "It didn't explain what
was going on I at very small scalel."
The devices — which have
already been manufactured — are
near-perfect spheres that will spin,
acting as "essentially independent
satellites" in a near-absolute zero
environment, Parkinson said.
Imperfections on the gyroscopes
are no more than one ten-thou
sandths of the thickness of a piece

of paper, he added.
Parkinson explained that
changes in the gyroscopes' spins
will be measured to study if and
how "the Earth, as it spins, drags
space and time with it."
The phenomena, if detected,
would be consistent with Ein
stein's General Theory — which
predicts that a celestial body
warps space and time near it —
but not everyone thinks such
changes will be observed.
"Some scientists would not be
surprised if [data from Gravity
Probe B] disagreed" with Ein
stein's theory, Parkinson said.
Three Stanford scientists con
ceived the idea in 1960 and NASA
first funded aspects of the project
in 1962. Currently, about 45 facul
ty and staff from six departments
and up to 40 students are involved
in the project. Project scientists
should be able to make some con
clusions early in the next decade.
