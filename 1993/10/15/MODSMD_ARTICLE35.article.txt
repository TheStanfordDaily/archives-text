For their pioneering research
in gene technology, Dr. Stanley
Cohen, chairman of the Medical
School's Genetics Department,
and Dr. Herbert Boyer, professor
of biochemistry at UC-San Fran
cisco, will receive a $700,000 prize
today in Lugano, Switzerland.
Twenty years ago, working col
laboratively but in separate labs,
Cohen and Boyer discovered how
to transfer genes between living
cells by using a certain class of
enzymes that can cut DNA.
Later, they developed tech
niques for genetic engineering
that spawned the $10 billion
biotechnology industry in the
United States. Implementing
Cohen and Boyer's methods, sci
entists can now insert genes into
bacteria and viruses. Using infor
mation from the inserted genes,
these "bacterial factories" will
produce drugs such as the hepati

tis-B vaccine and the human
growth hormone.
"Each year the significance and
fundamental importance of
[Cohen's] research becomes more
evident," said Mike Goodkind,
spokesperson for the Medical
School. "What we're talking about
is a seminal method for producing
new products in a way that had
not been possible before."
In recognition of their lasting
influence on gene technology,
Cohen and Boyer will receive the
Helmut Horten Research Award,
an honor presented every two
years by the Helmut Horten
Foundation, named for a promi
nent German businessman who
died in 1987.
For Cohen and Boyer, the
award is only one of many honors
they have received for their
research. Both scientists are
members of the National Acade
my of Sciences and the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences.
