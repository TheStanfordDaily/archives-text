## 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
Dr. Ira Friedman, medical director for the
health center at UC-Berkeley since 1989, was
named as the director of Cowell Student Health
Center yesterday.
"We were looking for someone who was not only
looking at health-care reform, but primary care
from the point of view of health promotion, dis
ease prevention and education to students about
their bodies and health," said Mary Edmonds, vice
provost for student affairs.
Edmonds added that Friedman is "highly qual
ified" in adolescent medicine, with 18 years of
experience in patient care, medical education and
administration. He was trained in adolescent
medicine at Stanford's School of Medicine.
His expertise in the areas of sports and adoles
cent medicine "is a big plus" and made him stand

out among the five interviewed candidates, she
said.
Friedman, who will begin work by Jan. 1,
replaces former Director Harvey Weinstein, who
resigned last January.
Edmonds said the University's interest in
continuity of care of varsity athletes during their
off-season was also an important issue and said
Friedman is a "good fit" for matching a director
with this aspect of a student health center's
need.
Although sports medicine is one of Friedman's
areas of expertise, he is also very committed to
dealing with a diverse population, Edmonds
added.
Edmonds said she was impressed with Fried
man's depth of knowledge when she interviewed
him. "He certainly knew college health," she said,
and"he has a good grasp of what a student health
center is all about."
