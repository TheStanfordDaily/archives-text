# Casper: Stanford can't meddle in Webb Ranch
## 
### Skip Schwartz Senior staff writer 
At yesterday's Faculty Sen
ate meeting, University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper officially
distanced the University from
involvement in Webb Ranch
disputes, saying that "Stanford
University cannot run Webb
Ranch."
Casper said the long line of
disputes on Webb Ranch —
particularly the present hous
ing arbitration — is a matter
for the workers and the Webbs
to work out themselves.
"Stanford University can
not manage other people's
business and we can't inteiject
ourselves at all times," he said.
The current dispute is over
who may reside in house trail
ers donated by Stanford. The
United Stanford Workers
union claims that some have
been given to non-laborers, a
possible breach in the contract
between the ranch and its
workers.
Casper said that the work
ers have the union to advocate
their position in ongoing arbi
tration, while he and the Uni

versity have to get back to deal
ing with their demanding agen
da.
"Every minute I spend on
these matters ... is a minute I
do not spend on Stanford Uni
versity business," said Casper.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz,
a long-time supporter of the
Webb Ranch workers, told
Casper that he does not think
this is "a satisfactory situation
. . . and the union is part of the
problem and not the solution."
Rebholz added after the
meeting that "the workers
themselves don't trust the
union and the arbitration pro
cess."
Now that the University —
and Casper— have officially
stepped back from the prob
lem, Rebholz said he will direct
his attention toward the union
to make sure it is aggressive on
behalf of the workers.
He added that he now hopes
students will take over and
speak out on the problem, say
ing he concurs with Political Sci
ence Prof. John Manley's criti
cism that this situation "is a
moral failure of President
Casper and the administration."
