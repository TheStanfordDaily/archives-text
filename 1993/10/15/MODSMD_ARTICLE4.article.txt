# For a tireless teacher, a tough new assignment
## Undergrad education leader Sheehan gathers his team and heads for a field trip

If James Sheehan could have it his way,
he probably wouldn't be heading off to
Meyer Buck Estate tomorrow to begin an
arduous, year-long task as chair of the
Commission on Undergraduate Education.
"I would not be telling you the truth if I
suggested I had been burning to do this," he
said in a recent interview, "that I had been
waiting for the phone to ring to have some
one ask me to do this." That is not to say
that Sheehan is lacking in enthusiasm for,
or confidence in, his commission's ability to
carry out University President Gerhard
Casper's charge to reconsider Stanford's

entire undergraduate program. "I think we
will succeed," he said. "I wouldn't be devot
ing this year of my life to this process if I
thought it would not succeed."
But Sheehan's passion is teaching, and
to an extent, he laments that his attentions
this year cannot entirely be devoted to the
classroom. Sheehan still plans to teach four
classes this year in German history, his spe
cialty, but will not lecture in the History
CIV track, as he customarily does.
"For lots of reasons, it is important to
keep teaching while doing all of this," he
said. "Teaching is fun — it helps keep you
away from the administrative side of
things. And there's something a little odd
about going off to make recommendations

about undergraduate education — and in
the process getting as far away from it as
you can. It's good to stay in the trenches."
It is this very thirst for instruction that
Casper hopes Sheehan will bring to the
commission's proceedings, which com
mence tomorrow with a retreat for the 19
commission members to meet each other
and outline strategy. Over the course of the
year, Sheehan will be called upon to lead
discussions, address large audiences, plan
syllabi, consult primary sources, and re
search facts — all the skills expected of a
faculty member lauded for his teaching.
Like a historian embarking on a study of
uncharted areas, Sheehan is keeping his
goals for the commission properly broad.

The commission will meet each Friday for
two hours, and Sheehan hopes to have a
draft report ready by the end of spring quar
ter. But beyond that, his concerns tran
scend strict administrative details.
"I am interested, first of all, in how it all
fits together," he said. "I'm quite persuad
ed that the individual pieces of what we do
at Stanford are virtually all good. But I'm
not so sure we put it together in the best
way."
In particular, Sheehan is interested in
how the University is encouraging the
learning of "basic skills," namely, writing,
quantitative reasoning, and foreign lan-
