# For a tireless teacher, a tough new assignment
## Undergrad education leader Sheehan gathers his team and heads for a field trip 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
If James Sheehan could have it his way,
he probably wouldn't be heading off to
Meyer Buck Estate tomorrow to begin an
arduous, year-long task as chair of the
Commission on Undergraduate Education.
"I would not be telling you the truth if I
suggested I had been burning to do this," he
said in a recent interview, "that I had been
waiting for the phone to ring to have some
one ask me to do this." That is not to say
that Sheehan is lacking in enthusiasm for,
or confidence in, his commission's ability to
carry out University President Gerhard
Casper's charge to reconsider Stanford's

entire undergraduate program. "I think we
will succeed," he said. "I wouldn't be devot
ing this year of my life to this process if I
thought it would not succeed."
But Sheehan's passion is teaching, and
to an extent, he laments that his attentions
this year cannot entirely be devoted to the
classroom. Sheehan still plans to teach four
classes this year in German history, his spe
cialty, but will not lecture in the History
CIV track, as he customarily does.
"For lots of reasons, it is important to
keep teaching while doing all of this," he
said. "Teaching is fun — it helps keep you
away from the administrative side of
things. And there's something a little odd
about going off to make recommendations

about undergraduate education — and in
the process getting as far away from it as
you can. It's good to stay in the trenches."
It is this very thirst for instruction that
Casper hopes Sheehan will bring to the
commission's proceedings, which com
mence tomorrow with a retreat for the 19
commission members to meet each other
and outline strategy. Over the course of the
year, Sheehan will be called upon to lead
discussions, address large audiences, plan
syllabi, consult primary sources, and re
search facts — all the skills expected of a
faculty member lauded for his teaching.
Like a historian embarking on a study of
uncharted areas, Sheehan is keeping his
goals for the commission properly broad.

The commission will meet each Friday for
two hours, and Sheehan hopes to have a
draft report ready by the end of spring quar
ter. But beyond that, his concerns tran
scend strict administrative details.
"I am interested, first of all, in how it all
fits together," he said. "I'm quite persuad
ed that the individual pieces of what we do
at Stanford are virtually all good. But I'm
not so sure we put it together in the best
way."
In particular, Sheehan is interested in
how the University is encouraging the
learning of "basic skills," namely, writing,
quantitative reasoning, and foreign lan-
guage. But he quickly adds that
the commission will also address,
among other things, core require
ments, the advising system,
"teaching — how we evaluate it
and reward it,"and residential
education.
Recognizing the vast amount
of territory the issue of under
graduate education encompasses,
Sheehan says that "a central part
of the commission's first task is
coming to an agreement on those
things we want to consider, and
formulating the results of this
agreement into a set of questions
we want to have answered.
"This is an immense subject —
it's something we could wander
around in for decades," he said.
"And so the commission must
itself define its mission."
Sheehan has already gained a
sense of the complexities and
inevitable criticisms that are sure
to accompany this study, the first
of its kind at Stanford since 1968.

James Sheehan, History
Years at Stanford: ~\ 4
Average Undergraduate
Classes/Year: 2-3,
including History CIV track
Undergraduate Adviser: Yes
Interests: "Basic skills — making
sure students know how to write
properly, have quantitative reason
ing skills, and have been encour
aged to do as much with a foreign
language as possible"; "how it all
fits together."

Sheehan and Casper's decision
not to place any faculty member
from the literature, philosophy or
religious studies disciplines on
the commission.
Sheehan rejects the suggestion
that the commission should add
another member. "It's already a
much larger group than I would
like," he said. Moreover, he con
tends that literature and writing
specialists will almost certainly be
consulted when the panel breaks
off into working groups.
Likewise, Sheehan shrugs off

the ASSU's calls for increased stu
dent representation on the com
mission, which includes two stu
dent members. "I didn't think
adding one more undergraduate
would substantially change the
representation," he said. "The stu
dent body is so diverse, that having
just one more student would really
not solve the problem."
On the other hand, he said stu
dents will be consulted extensively
throughout the process, and called
the COP's adjunct advisory panel
on undergraduate education "ter
rific — I wish I could take credit
for having thought of it myself."
Sheehan admits that prior to
his appointment, he had not been
losing sleep over the quality of
undergraduate education at Stan
ford. "We have a natural tenden
cy to concern ourselves with the
tasks which we perform," he said.
"But I certainly had the feeling
that we had talked about particu
lar pieces of the curriculum, but
not the whole."
Now, he is challenging himself
— and the entire Stanford com
munity — to ponder relentlessly
the whole question of undergrad

uate education. "What I hope and
firmly believe we will do is suc
ceed in getting people to think
and talk about what we're doing,"
he said. "If the process is open
and consultative (and) vigorous, I
think the process itself has a pow
erful advantage."
Sheehan's affection and capac
ity for teaching will evidently play
a large role in that process. Even
in a casual conversation at his
office, Sheehan is pensive and cir
cumspect, often pausing for sev
eral seconds before responding to
a question.
And in explaining how he hopes
the commission will conduct itself,
he finds an appropriate analogy,
which illustrates Sheehan's
unwavering love for his job
"It's like a discussion in a class
— the best discussions are the
discussions that have a goal,
where you get to where the teach
er wants you to get to," he said.
"But they don't follow a script
— it's not as if everyone has a line
they have to say," he added. "You
kind of move things along,
encourage people to clarify — and
that's what we're trying to do."

On the other hand, he said stu
dents will be consulted extensively
throughout the process, and called
the COP's adjunct advisory panel
on undergraduate education "ter
rific — I wish I could take credit
for having thought of it myself."
Sheehan admits that prior to
his appointment, he had not been
losing sleep over the quality of
undergraduate education at Stan
ford. "We have a natural tenden
cy to concern ourselves with the
tasks which we perform," he said.
"But I certainly had the feeling
that we had talked about particu
lar pieces of the curriculum, but
not the whole."
Now, he is challenging himself
— and the entire Stanford com
munity — to ponder relentlessly
the whole question of undergrad

uate education. "What I hope and
firmly believe we will do is suc
ceed in getting people to think
and talk about what we're doing,"
he said. "If the process is open
and consultative (and) vigorous, I
think the process itself has a pow
erful advantage."
Sheehan's affection and capac
ity for teaching will evidently play
a large role in that process. Even
in a casual conversation at his
office, Sheehan is pensive and cir
cumspect, often pausing for sev
eral seconds before responding to
a question.
And in explaining how he hopes
the commission will conduct itself,
he finds an appropriate analogy,
which illustrates Sheehan's
unwavering love for his job
"It's like a discussion in a class
— the best discussions are the
discussions that have a goal,
where you get to where the teach
er wants you to get to," he said.
"But they don't follow a script
— it's not as if everyone has a line
they have to say," he added. "You
kind of move things along,
encourage people to clarify — and
that's what we're trying to do."

History Prof. James Sheehan will lead the Commission on Undergraduate Education as it maps out a strategy this weekend to study Stan
ford's undergraduate program.
If James Sheehan could have it his way,
he probably wouldn't be heading off to
Meyer Buck Estate tomorrow to begin an
arduous, year-long task as chair of the
Commission on Undergraduate Education.
"I would not be telling you the truth if I
suggested I had been burning to do this," he
said in a recent interview, "that I had been
waiting for the phone to ring to have some
one ask me to do this." That is not to say
that Sheehan is lacking in enthusiasm for,
or confidence in, his commission's ability to
carry out University President Gerhard
Casper's charge to reconsider Stanford's

entire undergraduate program. "I think we
will succeed," he said. "I wouldn't be devot
ing this year of my life to this process if I
thought it would not succeed."
But Sheehan's passion is teaching, and
to an extent, he laments that his attentions
this year cannot entirely be devoted to the
classroom. Sheehan still plans to teach four
classes this year in German history, his spe
cialty, but will not lecture in the History
CIV track, as he customarily does.
"For lots of reasons, it is important to
keep teaching while doing all of this," he
said. "Teaching is fun — it helps keep you
away from the administrative side of
things. And there's something a little odd
about going off to make recommendations

about undergraduate education — and in
the process getting as far away from it as
you can. It's good to stay in the trenches."
It is this very thirst for instruction that
Casper hopes Sheehan will bring to the
commission's proceedings, which com
mence tomorrow with a retreat for the 19
commission members to meet each other
and outline strategy. Over the course of the
year, Sheehan will be called upon to lead
discussions, address large audiences, plan
syllabi, consult primary sources, and re
search facts — all the skills expected of a
faculty member lauded for his teaching.
Like a historian embarking on a study of
uncharted areas, Sheehan is keeping his
goals for the commission properly broad.

The commission will meet each Friday for
two hours, and Sheehan hopes to have a
draft report ready by the end of spring quar
ter. But beyond that, his concerns tran
scend strict administrative details.
"I am interested, first of all, in how it all
fits together," he said. "I'm quite persuad
ed that the individual pieces of what we do
at Stanford are virtually all good. But I'm
not so sure we put it together in the best
way."
In particular, Sheehan is interested in
how the University is encouraging the
learning of "basic skills," namely, writing,
quantitative reasoning, and foreign lan-
guage. But he quickly adds that
the commission will also address,
among other things, core require
ments, the advising system,
"teaching — how we evaluate it
and reward it,"and residential
education.
Recognizing the vast amount
of territory the issue of under
graduate education encompasses,
Sheehan says that "a central part
of the commission's first task is
coming to an agreement on those
things we want to consider, and
formulating the results of this
agreement into a set of questions
we want to have answered.
"This is an immense subject —
it's something we could wander
around in for decades," he said.
"And so the commission must
itself define its mission."
Sheehan has already gained a
sense of the complexities and
inevitable criticisms that are sure
to accompany this study, the first
of its kind at Stanford since 1968.

Sheehan and Casper's decision
not to place any faculty member
from the literature, philosophy or
religious studies disciplines on
the commission.
Sheehan rejects the suggestion
that the commission should add
another member. "It's already a
much larger group than I would
like," he said. Moreover, he con
tends that literature and writing
specialists will almost certainly be
consulted when the panel breaks
off into working groups.
Likewise, Sheehan shrugs off

the ASSU's calls for increased stu
dent representation on the com
mission, which includes two stu
dent members. "I didn't think
adding one more undergraduate
would substantially change the
representation," he said. "The stu

just one more student would really
not solve the problem."
