# In search of a clue

You are pathetic. You've sniveled
your way through three years
and $70,000 worth of Stanford,
and you have nothing to show for it.
No ambition, no direction, no hope.
Nacla.
In nine short months you'll receive
a degree that, lipped printed-side
down, will make a great "will work for
food" sign — if you can scrounge a
pencil stub from the gutter to write
with.
A good place to stock up on stubby
pencils might be Stanford's Career
Planning and Placement Center —
and while you're at it, you may just
find an escape hatch out of the
gloomy, dead-end life your overactive
imagination has set up for you.
Fear not, linguistics and German
studies majors. The CPPC can help
even the most clueless, I-have-no
idea-what-life-holds-for-me types. The
CPPC offers professional help, if you
will.

Start off with the oh-so-aptly titled
workshop, "Getting started at the
CPPC." This short program is a thor
ough overview of CPPC programs and
resources — from recruiting to refer
ence books — for both undergrads and
graduates. Upcoming dates for this
workshop include Oct. 19, Oct. '26 and
Oct. 28. For busy types, it's available
on video. And, for undergrads, it's a
prerequisite (read: required) to make
a personal appointment to see a coun
selor.
Once you've seen what the CPPC
has to offer, you'll probably be over
whelmed with all the books and
binders, files and informational fliers.
To focus your quest for life after
Stanford, you may want to sign up for
a workshop on the Strong Interest
Inventory. This "instrument" (chill
out, it's not a test) can help you iden
tify occupations that may mesh well
with your interests. The next Strong
Interest workshop is set for Oct. 20.

But such "instruments" are not the
only way to assess likes, dislikes,
strengths and weaknesses, say the
experts. "Students should think about
their interests, who they are, whom
they like to work with," says career
counselor Laura Dominguez.
These are just ideas to keep in
mind, however, and it is not nec
essary to keep a '200-page list of
office-color preferences and water
cooler etiquette. Simply eliminating a
few of the myriad of options in the
marketplace can be helpful.
"It's OK to come in and say, 'I
don't know what to do with my life.
Help!' " Dominguez says.
When the time comes for serious
professional help, you may wish to
schedule a personal, 45-minute ses
sion with a CP PC counselor.
Appointments can be made by calling
725-1789. Counselors can help you
assess your interests, skills and val
ues; identify your goals and objectives;
translate that information into a
meaningful career or first job; and
understand the nuts and bolts of get
ting such a job. Same-day, 15-minute
drop-in appointments for quick ques
tions are also available.
Instead of, or in conjunction with,
an appointment, you may want to
attend "Great jobs for new grads," a
popular 90-minute workshop covering
the same basic interest topics. The
next one is set for Oct. 19.
After this initial process of focusing
yourself, your search may take you in
any number of different directions.
For some, recruiting is the path to
employment after graduation. More
than 400 companies and organizations
— representing fields ranging from
accounting and consulting to aeronau
tics and summer camps — visit cam
pus each year in search of bright
young minds. Note that a 90-minute
recruiting orientation session is
mandatory.
But there's much more to the
CPPC than on-campus interviewing,
more than just power suits and fresh
from-the-Bookstore briefcases.
"There's nothing wrong with not
using recruiting," says Dominguez.
"It's not for everybody."
In fact, recruiting isn't even the
"No. 1" way to find a job, says
