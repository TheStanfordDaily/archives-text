# In search of a clue
## 
### Julie Makinen 
You are pathetic. You've sniveled
your way through three years
and $70,000 worth of Stanford,
and you have nothing to show for it.
No ambition, no direction, no hope.
Nacla.
In nine short months you'll receive
a degree that, lipped printed-side
down, will make a great "will work for
food" sign — if you can scrounge a
pencil stub from the gutter to write
with.
A good place to stock up on stubby
pencils might be Stanford's Career
Planning and Placement Center —
and while you're at it, you may just
find an escape hatch out of the
gloomy, dead-end life your overactive
imagination has set up for you.
Fear not, linguistics and German
studies majors. The CPPC can help
even the most clueless, I-have-no
idea-what-life-holds-for-me types. The
CPPC offers professional help, if you
will.

Start off with the oh-so-aptly titled
workshop, "Getting started at the
CPPC." This short program is a thor
ough overview of CPPC programs and
resources — from recruiting to refer
ence books — for both undergrads and
graduates. Upcoming dates for this
workshop include Oct. 19, Oct. '26 and
Oct. 28. For busy types, it's available
on video. And, for undergrads, it's a
prerequisite (read: required) to make
a personal appointment to see a coun
selor.
Once you've seen what the CPPC
has to offer, you'll probably be over
whelmed with all the books and
binders, files and informational fliers.
To focus your quest for life after
Stanford, you may want to sign up for
a workshop on the Strong Interest
Inventory. This "instrument" (chill
out, it's not a test) can help you iden
tify occupations that may mesh well
with your interests. The next Strong
Interest workshop is set for Oct. 20.

But such "instruments" are not the
only way to assess likes, dislikes,
strengths and weaknesses, say the
experts. "Students should think about
their interests, who they are, whom
they like to work with," says career
counselor Laura Dominguez.
These are just ideas to keep in
mind, however, and it is not nec
essary to keep a '200-page list of
office-color preferences and water
cooler etiquette. Simply eliminating a
few of the myriad of options in the
marketplace can be helpful.
"It's OK to come in and say, 'I
don't know what to do with my life.
Help!' " Dominguez says.
When the time comes for serious
professional help, you may wish to
schedule a personal, 45-minute ses
sion with a CP PC counselor.
Appointments can be made by calling
725-1789. Counselors can help you
assess your interests, skills and val
ues; identify your goals and objectives;
translate that information into a
meaningful career or first job; and
understand the nuts and bolts of get
ting such a job. Same-day, 15-minute
drop-in appointments for quick ques
tions are also available.
Instead of, or in conjunction with,
an appointment, you may want to
attend "Great jobs for new grads," a
popular 90-minute workshop covering
the same basic interest topics. The
next one is set for Oct. 19.
After this initial process of focusing
yourself, your search may take you in
any number of different directions.
For some, recruiting is the path to
employment after graduation. More
than 400 companies and organizations
— representing fields ranging from
accounting and consulting to aeronau
tics and summer camps — visit cam
pus each year in search of bright
young minds. Note that a 90-minute
recruiting orientation session is
mandatory.
But there's much more to the
CPPC than on-campus interviewing,
more than just power suits and fresh
from-the-Bookstore briefcases.
"There's nothing wrong with not
using recruiting," says Dominguez.
"It's not for everybody."
In fact, recruiting isn't even the
"No. 1" way to find a job, says

Dominguez. Most graduates-to-be find
non-recruiting-related resources to be
the key to finding a focus and a job.
The CPPC's extensive career
library houses a variety of written
resources about different careers,
resume writing, job hunting and
interviewing. For months of reading
enjoyment, full-time and part-time job
binders, internship announcements,
information on teaching, summer job
listings and other job-search materials
are also located in the library. The
center even has a special section for
minority students, and this year there
are new resources for gay, lesbian and
bisexual students.
In addition to traditional jobs, the
CPPC offers extensive listings of
non-profit and government agen
cies for those wishing to explore pub
lic-service work.
Career counselor Anne Greenblatt,
who specializes in careers in public
service, points out that public-service
jobs often offer more flexible work
schedules, more variety and greater
opportunities for advancement than
jobs with private corporations.
And, she adds, "You can make a

decent living in the non-profit sector."
According to Greenblatt, public ser
vice is a wide field ranging from reli
gion to the environment to education
and the arts. And within each area the
opportunities are extremely varied —
from administrative roles to down
and-dirty grassroots fieldwork. About

'You can make a
dccent living in
the non-profit sector,'
— Anne Greenblatt

25 percent of Stanford students
express interest in public service
work, and 18 to 20 percent of gradu
ates nationwide participate in public
service work immediately out of col
lege, according to Greenblatt.
Recent graduates have done every
thing from working as AIDS educators
to coordinating volunteers at a bat
tered women's shelter to designing
exhibits in museums. The CPPC will

host a public service career week Feb. 7
through 11, and a career fair Feb. 15.
And once you've found a few career
options that appeal to you, the center
offers a mentoring program which
allows you to spend a day with profes
sionals who work in those fields. In
addition, an alumni contact service is
sponsored by the CPPC and the
Alumni Association so you can begin
to network and take advantage of the
$80,000 sentimental bond you share
with other Stanford grads.
As you delve further into your
quest, other workshops — such as
"Resume and cover letter essentials,"
(Nov. 3) "Six sure-fire ways to get a
job" (Oct. 21 and 28) and
"Interviewing" (Oct. 20 and Nov. 3) —
may help you slay the beast of
impending unemployment.
To safeguard all your hard work,
the center also offers a free Reference
File service. A reference file, which
contains letters of recommendation
and your curriculum vitae, may be
used to support your application to
graduate or professional schools, or
your job search. What better way to
keep all your important documents
from falling prey to looting and pillag
ing dorm Vikings or your own faulty
filing system?
Too much carccr
mindedness can
throw off students.'
— Laura Dominguez

In addition to the CPPC, a parallel
organization, the Career Action
Center in Palo Alto, can assist in your
search for life after June 15. The goal
of the center is to teach self-reliance,
says employee Akila Narsimhan.
"We help people help themselves,"
she says.
The center's extensive library fea
tures a collection of videotapes on dif
ferent careers and companies.
Descriptions of more than 1,200 Bay
Area employers and nearly 7,000 job
listings per month can also be found
at the center.
The center also maintains net
working groups and offers workshops
on such topics as creativity, the
biotech industry, international mar
keting and career mastery for
African-Americans.
However and wherever you decide
to start planning for life after
Stanford, the CPPC's Dominguez
advises you to start early. Because a
job search can take as long as eight
months — depending on the field you
are interested in — you are encour
aged to check out the CPPC fall quar
ter and at least establish a timeline
for your quest.
Finally, keep in mind that your
first job after Stanford probably won't
be your last. In fact, the typical

Stanford grad stays at his or her first
job for only two years.
"For most people, it's a figuring
out period," says Dominguez. "Too
much career-mindedness can throw
off students. Usually, your first job
isn't your career. It's just one step on
the road to a career, which may or
may not be closely related to that first
job."

The Career Action Center is located at
445 Sherman Ave. in Palo Alto. It's
open Monday, Wednesday and Friday
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Tuesday and
Thursday 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and
Saturday, for members only, from 9 a.m.
to 1 p.m. One-year memberships cost
$65, and one-day user fees are $10.
There is a 30-minute orientation every
day at 10 a.m. For more information,
call 324-1710.

ting such a job. Same-day, 15-minute
drop-in appointments for quick ques
tions are also available.
Instead of, or in conjunction with,
an appointment, you may want to
attend "Great jobs for new grads," a
popular 90-minute workshop covering
the same basic interest topics. The
next one is set for Oct. 19.
After this initial process of focusing
yourself, your search may take you in
any number of different directions.
For some, recruiting is the path to
employment after graduation. More
than 400 companies and organizations
— representing fields ranging from
accounting and consulting to aeronau
tics and summer camps — visit cam
pus each year in search of bright
young minds. Note that a 90-minute
recruiting orientation session is
mandatory.
But there's much more to the
CPPC than on-campus interviewing,
more than just power suits and fresh
from-the-Bookstore briefcases.
"There's nothing wrong with not
using recruiting," says Dominguez.
"It's not for everybody."
In fact, recruiting isn't even the
"No. 1" way to find a job, says

Dominguez. Most graduates-to-be find
non-recruiting-related resources to be
the key to finding a focus and a job.
The CPPC's extensive career
library houses a variety of written
resources about different careers,
resume writing, job hunting and
interviewing. For months of reading
enjoyment, full-time and part-time job
binders, internship announcements,
information on teaching, summer job
listings and other job-search materials
are also located in the library. The
center even has a special section for
minority students, and this year there
are new resources for gay, lesbian and
bisexual students.
In addition to traditional jobs, the
CPPC offers extensive listings of
non-profit and government agen
cies for those wishing to explore pub
lic-service work.
Career counselor Anne Greenblatt,
who specializes in careers in public
service, points out that public-service
jobs often offer more flexible work
schedules, more variety and greater
opportunities for advancement than
jobs with private corporations.
And, she adds, "You can make a

decent living in the non-profit sector."
According to Greenblatt, public ser
vice is a wide field ranging from reli
gion to the environment to education
and the arts. And within each area the
opportunities are extremely varied —
from administrative roles to down
and-dirty grassroots fieldwork. About

'You can make a
dccent living in
the non-profit sector,'
— Anne Greenblatt

25 percent of Stanford students
express interest in public service
work, and 18 to 20 percent of gradu
ates nationwide participate in public
service work immediately out of col
lege, according to Greenblatt.
Recent graduates have done every
thing from working as AIDS educators
to coordinating volunteers at a bat
tered women's shelter to designing
exhibits in museums. The CPPC will

host a public service career week Feb. 7
through 11, and a career fair Feb. 15.
And once you've found a few career
options that appeal to you, the center
offers a mentoring program which
allows you to spend a day with profes
sionals who work in those fields. In
addition, an alumni contact service is
sponsored by the CPPC and the
Alumni Association so you can begin
to network and take advantage of the
$80,000 sentimental bond you share
with other Stanford grads.
As you delve further into your
quest, other workshops — such as
"Resume and cover letter essentials,"
(Nov. 3) "Six sure-fire ways to get a
job" (Oct. 21 and 28) and
"Interviewing" (Oct. 20 and Nov. 3) —
may help you slay the beast of
impending unemployment.
To safeguard all your hard work,
the center also offers a free Reference
File service. A reference file, which
contains letters of recommendation
and your curriculum vitae, may be
used to support your application to
graduate or professional schools, or
your job search. What better way to
keep all your important documents
from falling prey to looting and pillag
ing dorm Vikings or your own faulty
filing system?
Too much carccr
mindedness can

In addition to the CPPC, a parallel
organization, the Career Action
Center in Palo Alto, can assist in your
search for life after June 15. The goal
of the center is to teach self-reliance,
says employee Akila Narsimhan.
"We help people help themselves,"
she says.
The center's extensive library fea
tures a collection of videotapes on dif
ferent careers and companies.
Descriptions of more than 1,200 Bay
Area employers and nearly 7,000 job
listings per month can also be found
at the center.
The center also maintains net
working groups and offers workshops
on such topics as creativity, the
biotech industry, international mar
keting and career mastery for
African-Americans.
However and wherever you decide
to start planning for life after
Stanford, the CPPC's Dominguez
advises you to start early. Because a
job search can take as long as eight
months — depending on the field you
are interested in — you are encour
aged to check out the CPPC fall quar
ter and at least establish a timeline
for your quest.
Finally, keep in mind that your
first job after Stanford probably won't
be your last. In fact, the typical

Stanford grad stays at his or her first
job for only two years.
"For most people, it's a figuring
out period," says Dominguez. "Too
much career-mindedness can throw
off students. Usually, your first job
isn't your career. It's just one step on
the road to a career, which may or
may not be closely related to that first
job."

The Career Action Center is located at
445 Sherman Ave. in Palo Alto. It's
open Monday, Wednesday and Friday
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Tuesday and
Thursday 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and
Saturday, for members only, from 9 a.m.
to 1 p.m. One-year memberships cost
$65, and one-day user fees are $10.
There is a 30-minute orientation every
day at 10 a.m. For more information,
call 324-1710.
You are pathetic. You've sniveled
your way through three years
and $70,000 worth of Stanford,
and you have nothing to show for it.
No ambition, no direction, no hope.
Nacla.
In nine short months you'll receive
a degree that, lipped printed-side
down, will make a great "will work for
food" sign — if you can scrounge a
pencil stub from the gutter to write
with.
A good place to stock up on stubby
pencils might be Stanford's Career
Planning and Placement Center —
and while you're at it, you may just
find an escape hatch out of the
gloomy, dead-end life your overactive
imagination has set up for you.
Fear not, linguistics and German
studies majors. The CPPC can help
even the most clueless, I-have-no
idea-what-life-holds-for-me types. The
CPPC offers professional help, if you
will.

Start off with the oh-so-aptly titled
workshop, "Getting started at the
CPPC." This short program is a thor
ough overview of CPPC programs and
resources — from recruiting to refer
ence books — for both undergrads and
graduates. Upcoming dates for this
workshop include Oct. 19, Oct. '26 and
Oct. 28. For busy types, it's available
on video. And, for undergrads, it's a
prerequisite (read: required) to make
a personal appointment to see a coun
selor.
Once you've seen what the CPPC
has to offer, you'll probably be over
whelmed with all the books and
binders, files and informational fliers.
To focus your quest for life after
Stanford, you may want to sign up for
a workshop on the Strong Interest
Inventory. This "instrument" (chill
out, it's not a test) can help you iden
tify occupations that may mesh well
with your interests. The next Strong
Interest workshop is set for Oct. 20.

But such "instruments" are not the
only way to assess likes, dislikes,
strengths and weaknesses, say the
experts. "Students should think about
their interests, who they are, whom
they like to work with," says career
counselor Laura Dominguez.
These are just ideas to keep in
mind, however, and it is not nec
essary to keep a '200-page list of
office-color preferences and water
cooler etiquette. Simply eliminating a
few of the myriad of options in the
marketplace can be helpful.
"It's OK to come in and say, 'I
don't know what to do with my life.
Help!' " Dominguez says.
When the time comes for serious
professional help, you may wish to
schedule a personal, 45-minute ses
sion with a CP PC counselor.
Appointments can be made by calling
725-1789. Counselors can help you
assess your interests, skills and val
ues; identify your goals and objectives;
translate that information into a
meaningful career or first job; and
understand the nuts and bolts of get
ting such a job. Same-day, 15-minute
drop-in appointments for quick ques

options that appeal to you, the center
offers a mentoring program which
allows you to spend a day with profes
sionals who work in those fields. In
addition, an alumni contact service is
sponsored by the CPPC and the
Alumni Association so you can begin
to network and take advantage of the
$80,000 sentimental bond you share
with other Stanford grads.
As you delve further into your
quest, other workshops — such as
"Resume and cover letter essentials,"
(Nov. 3) "Six sure-fire ways to get a
job" (Oct. 21 and 28) and
"Interviewing" (Oct. 20 and Nov. 3) —
may help you slay the beast of
impending unemployment.
To safeguard all your hard work,
the center also offers a free Reference
File service. A reference file, which
contains letters of recommendation
and your curriculum vitae, may be
used to support your application to
graduate or professional schools, or
your job search. What better way to
keep all your important documents
from falling prey to looting and pillag
ing dorm Vikings or your own faulty
filing system?

In addition to the CPPC, a parallel
organization, the Career Action
Center in Palo Alto, can assist in your
search for life after June 15. The goal
of the center is to teach self-reliance,
says employee Akila Narsimhan.
"We help people help themselves,"
she says.
The center's extensive library fea
tures a collection of videotapes on dif
ferent careers and companies.
Descriptions of more than 1,200 Bay
Area employers and nearly 7,000 job
listings per month can also be found
at the center.
The center also maintains net
working groups and offers workshops
on such topics as creativity, the
biotech industry, international mar
keting and career mastery for
African-Americans.
However and wherever you decide
to start planning for life after
Stanford, the CPPC's Dominguez
advises you to start early. Because a
job search can take as long as eight
months — depending on the field you
are interested in — you are encour
aged to check out the CPPC fall quar
ter and at least establish a timeline
for your quest.
Finally, keep in mind that your
first job after Stanford probably won't
be your last. In fact, the typical

Stanford grad stays at his or her first
job for only two years.
"For most people, it's a figuring
out period," says Dominguez. "Too
much career-mindedness can throw
off students. Usually, your first job
isn't your career. It's just one step on
the road to a career, which may or
may not be closely related to that first
job."

The Career Action Center is located at
445 Sherman Ave. in Palo Alto. It's
open Monday, Wednesday and Friday
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Tuesday and
Thursday 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and
Saturday, for members only, from 9 a.m.
to 1 p.m. One-year memberships cost
$65, and one-day user fees are $10.
There is a 30-minute orientation every
day at 10 a.m. For more information,
call 324-1710.
You are pathetic. You've sniveled
your way through three years
and $70,000 worth of Stanford,
and you have nothing to show for it.
No ambition, no direction, no hope.
Nacla.
In nine short months you'll receive
a degree that, lipped printed-side
down, will make a great "will work for
food" sign — if you can scrounge a
pencil stub from the gutter to write
with.
A good place to stock up on stubby
pencils might be Stanford's Career
Planning and Placement Center —
and while you're at it, you may just
find an escape hatch out of the
gloomy, dead-end life your overactive
imagination has set up for you.
Fear not, linguistics and German
studies majors. The CPPC can help
even the most clueless, I-have-no
idea-what-life-holds-for-me types. The
CPPC offers professional help, if you
will.

Start off with the oh-so-aptly titled
workshop, "Getting started at the
CPPC." This short program is a thor
ough overview of CPPC programs and
resources — from recruiting to refer
ence books — for both undergrads and
graduates. Upcoming dates for this
workshop include Oct. 19, Oct. '26 and
Oct. 28. For busy types, it's available
on video. And, for undergrads, it's a
prerequisite (read: required) to make
a personal appointment to see a coun
selor.
Once you've seen what the CPPC
has to offer, you'll probably be over
whelmed with all the books and
binders, files and informational fliers.
To focus your quest for life after
Stanford, you may want to sign up for
a workshop on the Strong Interest
Inventory. This "instrument" (chill
out, it's not a test) can help you iden
tify occupations that may mesh well
with your interests. The next Strong
Interest workshop is set for Oct. 20.

But such "instruments" are not the
only way to assess likes, dislikes,
strengths and weaknesses, say the
experts. "Students should think about
their interests, who they are, whom
they like to work with," says career
counselor Laura Dominguez.
These are just ideas to keep in
mind, however, and it is not nec
essary to keep a '200-page list of
office-color preferences and water
cooler etiquette. Simply eliminating a
few of the myriad of options in the
marketplace can be helpful.
"It's OK to come in and say, 'I
don't know what to do with my life.
Help!' " Dominguez says.
When the time comes for serious
professional help, you may wish to
schedule a personal, 45-minute ses
sion with a CP PC counselor.
Appointments can be made by calling
725-1789. Counselors can help you
assess your interests, skills and val
ues; identify your goals and objectives;
translate that information into a
meaningful career or first job; and
understand the nuts and bolts of get
ting such a job. Same-day, 15-minute
drop-in appointments for quick ques
tions are also available.
Instead of, or in conjunction with,
an appointment, you may want to
attend "Great jobs for new grads," a
popular 90-minute workshop covering
the same basic interest topics. The
next one is set for Oct. 19.
After this initial process of focusing
yourself, your search may take you in
any number of different directions.
For some, recruiting is the path to
employment after graduation. More
than 400 companies and organizations
— representing fields ranging from
accounting and consulting to aeronau
tics and summer camps — visit cam
pus each year in search of bright
young minds. Note that a 90-minute
recruiting orientation session is
mandatory.
But there's much more to the
CPPC than on-campus interviewing,
more than just power suits and fresh
from-the-Bookstore briefcases.
"There's nothing wrong with not
using recruiting," says Dominguez.
"It's not for everybody."
In fact, recruiting isn't even the
"No. 1" way to find a job, says

Dominguez. Most graduates-to-be find
non-recruiting-related resources to be
the key to finding a focus and a job.
The CPPC's extensive career
library houses a variety of written
resources about different careers,
resume writing, job hunting and
interviewing. For months of reading
enjoyment, full-time and part-time job
binders, internship announcements,
information on teaching, summer job
listings and other job-search materials
are also located in the library. The
center even has a special section for
minority students, and this year there
are new resources for gay, lesbian and
bisexual students.
In addition to traditional jobs, the
CPPC offers extensive listings of
non-profit and government agen
cies for those wishing to explore pub
lic-service work.
Career counselor Anne Greenblatt,
who specializes in careers in public
service, points out that public-service
jobs often offer more flexible work
schedules, more variety and greater
opportunities for advancement than
jobs with private corporations.
And, she adds, "You can make a

decent living in the non-profit sector."
According to Greenblatt, public ser
vice is a wide field ranging from reli
gion to the environment to education
and the arts. And within each area the
opportunities are extremely varied —
from administrative roles to down
and-dirty grassroots fieldwork. About

'You can make a
dccent living in
the non-profit sector,'
— Anne Greenblatt

25 percent of Stanford students
express interest in public service
work, and 18 to 20 percent of gradu
ates nationwide participate in public
service work immediately out of col
lege, according to Greenblatt.
Recent graduates have done every
thing from working as AIDS educators
to coordinating volunteers at a bat
tered women's shelter to designing
exhibits in museums. The CPPC will

host a public service career week Feb. 7
through 11, and a career fair Feb. 15.
