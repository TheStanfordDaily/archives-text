# A
						DATE WITH DESTINY
## Pre-graduation hysteria as the real world nears 
### Tish Williams 
My name is Tish Williams,
and I have worked at Bob's
Big Boy. I wore those repul
sive "skin-tone" panty hose.
I donned my navy blue polyester
skirt/dress with its oh-so-see-through
cotton blouse. I had a makeshift name
tag whose "TISH" only covered up the
first four letters in "Jesus."
And yes, I wore my hair in a bun.
Mock my pain, pitiless cretins.
Scarred for life by memories of having
to smile at drooling elderly people who
would never even think of sending me
a birthday check. Having to be called
"honey" by slovenly child-moles
teresque "regulars." Having to be
taught the ropes by women with dol
phin tattoos on their ankles who were
actually making respectable money in
tips, only to spend it on IROCs and
acrylic nails.
America the beautiful.
While the rest of you were probably
out working at Club Med or some
cushy paper-pushing job serving coffee
to people doing pseudo-real work at
defense- industry corporations, I
humiliated myself wearing
"Strawberry Festival" trucker hats.
While you packed your resume, I got
picked up by guys who spent their
days tinting the windows on their
Volkswagen Bugs.
OK, so it wasn't all bad.
Right out of high school, that was
the last time I hit the job market. The
last time I went to a place where I was
not known, not loved, not respected
for my 4.5 GPA. And now, on the
brink of seniordom, I feel that same
excitement, that same anticipation,
that same urge to drown myself in a
toilet in the basement of Sweet Hall to
end my miserably unmarketable exis
tence.
I am a history major.
Yes, a history major. You laugh.
You snicker. You try to hide your con
tempt. You try and ask politely with
faux curiosity, "Oh, so you want to
teach?" as you chuckle at the worth-

less piece of paper I am to receive in
June. You console, "There's always
grad school ... or the Peace Corps."
You and your repulsive seriousness
regurgitate some worthless advice
about the ease and convenience of the
hinders at the CPPC.
You will pay for this in hell.
You fiendishly envision me flipping
through binder after binder of invest
ment banking jobs requiring skills and
olive-drab Italian silk suits I will never
have â€” finally breaking down and fill
ing out applications for positions pick
ing parasites out of cod in Alaska. Or
even better, the thought of me flirting
with young, sexually curious 10th
grade football players with large pecs
and the academic potential of a Buick
on cement blocks.
I've always considered teaching my
one chance to give back to society what
it gave to me.
But the pain. 1 too had dreams as a
child. I was going to be the dictator of
a nice Latin American country ripe for
the picking, Belize perhaps. 1 was
going to drive my Ferrari and have my
mansion and dress my children in
Guess overalls and little Nike baby
shoes.
I would live the Cosmo life. Well
accessorized lovers every day of the
week in between corporate grind ses
sions where we wheeled and dealed
econ majors like you as if they were
plague-infested rats. I crushed you in
my childhood dreams, wearing red
Chanel suits and three-inch heels.
I ate people like you for breakfast.
But where am I now? Looking to
cash it all in and go to grad school, giv
ing up all friends and social life in
return for a two-to-six year chance to
be a top-notch professor's personal ox?
Live in some dark corner of some
damp library on the East Coast, hop
ing to eke out some piece of knowledge
never ever happened upon previously
in the history of the universe? Work in
a pizza place just to get to live in the
sludge brown luxury of an ant-infested

apartment in some nirvana resembling
Escondido Village?
Justification for higher education.
But I don't like the looks of the fast
lane, either. I want to be more than
some office hood ornament serving
coffee to the people who have offices
with four walls and a door, wearing
only a camisole under my power suit
jacket in the hopes that with a little
sexual harassment I might climb up to
that glass ceiling a little faster.
Why yes, that is a pubic hair in my
Coke.
T-minus nine months and counting,
I instinctively feel my impending
doom. Why do I anticipate food-stamp
shopping sprees to augment "Top
Choice" liver and tuna cat food din
ners? Living with some obscure rela
tive in Montana because the cost of liv
ing is less and there are no distrac
tions, except for the two TV channels
and one Stop 'N' Go. Learning to clip
coupons for products I will never use
and entering Publisher's
Clearinghouse contests in the vain
hope of having a room not graced by
cockroaches.
The glass is half empty.
But they haven't gotten me yet.
There's still time to thwart this com
munist plot co-sponsored by the Hum
Bio department and Kaplans. This lab
created fear disease crippling fuzzies
like who have no place in a research
university. This strange lack of confi
dence when one looks at the dispropor
tionate number of people in the coun
try who still don't eat red M&Ms fear
ing they cause cancer.
Life will be good at Spiro T. Agnew
Junior High.
