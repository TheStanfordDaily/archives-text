# Public service: a short cut to the corporate fast track
## 
### Tish Williams Staff writer 
Public service is not a
four-letter word.
When you think of public
service, does the image of
you and your Stanford
diploma digging latrines for
the Peace Corps in the 120-
degree heat of Bangladesh
come to mind? Do you see
the face of your crying
mother as she explains to
the neighbors between sobs
that you couldn't cut it in
corporate America? Do you
envision an exclusively Taco
Bell diet, all from the 59-
cent menu?
Snap out of it.
Public service careers,
long stigmatized in the
wheeling-dealing decadence
of the 1980s, are often a
useful way to gain prime
management experience in
a short amount of time.
Though average workers
involved in public service
only make three-quarters of
a typical business-sector
salary, their service work is
a useful tool for acquiring
skills needed for future
employment.
According to Anne
Greenblatt, who is in charge
of public service career
counseling at the CPPC,
about one out of every four
students who come to the
CPPC examine the public
service sector. Nationwide,
she estimates, about 18-20
percent of college graduates
go into public service yearly.
"A recent graduate gets a
variety of experience, usual
ly gets more responsibility
and a sense that they're
doing something for the
planet," Greenblatt says.
"But public service jobs
aren't for everyone. 1 usual
ly ask students their inter
ests."
A personal interest
assessment is a key step

into discovering if such
employment would be right
for you. If high salaries and
presitigious companies are
more in tune with your
employment goals, public
service might not be a good
area to get into. However , if
a workable salary, the
chance to help others and
an often-higher degree of
authority catch your eye, it
would definitely be advis
able to investigate public
service jobs as you hit the
CPPC in your job quest.
Classified generally
under the broad categories
of jobs in non-profit organi
zations or government work
—at the community, state
or national level — public
service careers include a
wide variety of employment
options for future gradu
ates.
Non-profit organization
work tends toward the more
traditional view of public
service employment. People
in such groups are usually
in direct contact with the
groups they serve, on a
more community-based
level.
Workers in these types of
jobs are involved in provid
ing direct help for others, as
in the frequently cited
example of the Peace Corps
— teaching P.nglish in for
eign countries, working in
health education, etc. — or
more locally for groups
working in AIDS education
or with environmental
issues.
These are only a few
examples of a very wide
range of potential employ
ment opportunities which
also include working with
youth, health education,
women's issues and repro
ductive rights, among other
topics. Hut within all non
