# Public service: a short cut to the corporate fast track
## 
### Tish Williams Staff writer 
Public service is not a
four-letter word.
When you think of public
service, does the image of
you and your Stanford
diploma digging latrines for
the Peace Corps in the 120-
degree heat of Bangladesh
come to mind? Do you see
the face of your crying
mother as she explains to
the neighbors between sobs
that you couldn't cut it in
corporate America? Do you
envision an exclusively Taco
Bell diet, all from the 59-
cent menu?
Snap out of it.
Public service careers,
long stigmatized in the
wheeling-dealing decadence
of the 1980s, are often a
useful way to gain prime
management experience in
a short amount of time.
Though average workers
involved in public service
only make three-quarters of
a typical business-sector
salary, their service work is
a useful tool for acquiring
skills needed for future
employment.
According to Anne
Greenblatt, who is in charge
of public service career
counseling at the CPPC,
about one out of every four
students who come to the
CPPC examine the public
service sector. Nationwide,
she estimates, about 18-20
percent of college graduates
go into public service yearly.
"A recent graduate gets a
variety of experience, usual
ly gets more responsibility
and a sense that they're
doing something for the
planet," Greenblatt says.
"But public service jobs
aren't for everyone. 1 usual
ly ask students their inter
ests."
A personal interest
assessment is a key step

into discovering if such
employment would be right
for you. If high salaries and
presitigious companies are
more in tune with your
employment goals, public
service might not be a good
area to get into. However , if
a workable salary, the
chance to help others and
an often-higher degree of
authority catch your eye, it
would definitely be advis
able to investigate public
service jobs as you hit the
CPPC in your job quest.
Classified generally
under the broad categories
of jobs in non-profit organi
zations or government work
—at the community, state
or national level — public
service careers include a
wide variety of employment
options for future gradu
ates.
Non-profit organization
work tends toward the more
traditional view of public
service employment. People
in such groups are usually
in direct contact with the
groups they serve, on a
more community-based
level.
Workers in these types of
jobs are involved in provid
ing direct help for others, as
in the frequently cited
example of the Peace Corps
— teaching P.nglish in for
eign countries, working in
health education, etc. — or
more locally for groups
working in AIDS education
or with environmental
issues.
These are only a few
examples of a very wide
range of potential employ
ment opportunities which
also include working with
youth, health education,
women's issues and repro
ductive rights, among other
topics. Hut within all non
profit organizations there
are different types of jobs,
as well.
A graduate might be
involved in a hands-on
task such as teaching, but
might also be involved in
the management, develop
ment or improvement of
the type of help given by
the group or the structur
ing of the organization
itself. All such activities
help the graduate acquire
needed workplace experi
ence, and often give him
or her more power than
could be found climbing
the first two years of the
corporate ladder.
Government work, an
example of the more theo
retical side of public ser
vice, encompasses a broad
scope of employment
ranging from work on
Capitol Hill to jobs with
think tanks and in policy
making.
These jobs are typically
considered to be distanced
from a given issue
because they focus on
changing systems rather
than small groups. Such
work might feature devel
oping a more effective
health care policy or
studying how to revive
stripped farmland, or
membership in an advoca
cy group intent on getting
its views heard in
Washington.
Both these more
removed jobs and close
contact non-profit sector
jobs provide the training
and skills necessary to
get ahead in the business
world, but it is advisable
to take care in choosing
which field would be
more in tune with your
interests, in order to take
full advantage of the
workplace and the envi
ronment offered to you
there.
"I usually ask students
interested in public ser
vice if they think they'd
be interested in working
with the 'bigger picture'
like policy, or on a more
direct level," Greenblatt
says. "Hut I think it's nec
essary to work on a direct
level before working with

policy."
The CPPC features a
number of handouts dis
cussing public service
careers. Further, it helps
students decide if such a
career might be right for
them. The center also has
reference materials to aid
in your search, including
books, a Bay Area public
service employment
newsletter and the
Rainbow File, which holds
information on 600 public
service organizations
which are likely to be

offering jobs.
Essentially the cardi
nal place to go in order to
complete your mission,
the CPPC also offers
alumni-contact binders
enabling you to find and
talk to Stanford gradu
ates who are currently
involved in fields of inter
est to you — a don't-miss
chance to get pointers on
job-hunting and learn
more about what opportu
nities lie ahead in the real
world.
On Feb. 15, the CPPC
will host its annual Public
Service Career Faire, an
opportunity to meet and
get information from
those dealing in the field.
So if clawing your way
up the corporate ladder
doesn't appeal to you yet
- or never will — maybe
it's time to leave stereo
types behind and look into
a career in public service.

When you think of public
service, does the image of
you and your Stanford
diploma digging latrines for
the Peace Corps in the 120-
degree heat of Bangladesh
come to mind? Do you see
the face of your crying
mother as she explains to
the neighbors between sobs
that you couldn't cut it in
corporate America? Do you
envision an exclusively Taco
Bell diet, all from the 59-
cent menu?
Snap out of it.
Public service careers,
long stigmatized in the
wheeling-dealing decadence
of the 1980s, are often a
useful way to gain prime
management experience in
a short amount of time.
Though average workers
involved in public service
only make three-quarters of
a typical business-sector
salary, their service work is
a useful tool for acquiring
skills needed for future
employment.
According to Anne
Greenblatt, who is in charge
of public service career
counseling at the CPPC,
about one out of every four
students who come to the
CPPC examine the public
service sector. Nationwide,
she estimates, about 18-20
percent of college graduates
go into public service yearly.
"A recent graduate gets a
variety of experience, usual
ly gets more responsibility
and a sense that they're
doing something for the
planet," Greenblatt says.
"But public service jobs
aren't for everyone. 1 usual
ly ask students their inter
ests."
A personal interest
assessment is a key step

into discovering if such
employment would be right
for you. If high salaries and
presitigious companies are
more in tune with your
employment goals, public
service might not be a good
area to get into. However , if
a workable salary, the
chance to help others and
an often-higher degree of
authority catch your eye, it
would definitely be advis
able to investigate public
service jobs as you hit the
CPPC in your job quest.
Classified generally
under the broad categories
of jobs in non-profit organi
zations or government work
—at the community, state
or national level — public
service careers include a
wide variety of employment
options for future gradu
ates.
Non-profit organization
work tends toward the more
traditional view of public
service employment. People
in such groups are usually
in direct contact with the
groups they serve, on a
more community-based
level.
Workers in these types of
jobs are involved in provid
ing direct help for others, as
in the frequently cited
example of the Peace Corps
— teaching P.nglish in for
eign countries, working in
health education, etc. — or
more locally for groups
working in AIDS education
or with environmental
issues.
These are only a few
examples of a very wide
range of potential employ
ment opportunities which
also include working with
youth, health education,
women's issues and repro
ductive rights, among other
topics. Hut within all non
profit organizations there
are different types of jobs,
as well.
A graduate might be
involved in a hands-on
task such as teaching, but
might also be involved in
the management, develop
ment or improvement of
the type of help given by
the group or the structur
ing of the organization
itself. All such activities
help the graduate acquire
needed workplace experi
ence, and often give him
or her more power than
could be found climbing
the first two years of the
corporate ladder.
Government work, an
example of the more theo
retical side of public ser
vice, encompasses a broad
scope of employment
ranging from work on
Capitol Hill to jobs with
think tanks and in policy
making.
These jobs are typically
considered to be distanced
from a given issue
because they focus on
changing systems rather
than small groups. Such
work might feature devel
oping a more effective
health care policy or
studying how to revive
stripped farmland, or
membership in an advoca
cy group intent on getting
its views heard in
Washington.
Both these more
removed jobs and close
contact non-profit sector
jobs provide the training
and skills necessary to
get ahead in the business
world, but it is advisable
to take care in choosing
which field would be
more in tune with your
interests, in order to take
full advantage of the
workplace and the envi
ronment offered to you
there.
"I usually ask students
interested in public ser
vice if they think they'd
be interested in working
with the 'bigger picture'
like policy, or on a more
direct level," Greenblatt
says. "Hut I think it's nec
essary to work on a direct
level before working with

policy."
The CPPC features a
number of handouts dis
cussing public service
careers. Further, it helps
students decide if such a
career might be right for
them. The center also has
reference materials to aid
in your search, including
books, a Bay Area public
service employment
newsletter and the
Rainbow File, which holds
information on 600 public
service organizations
which are likely to be

offering jobs.
Essentially the cardi
nal place to go in order to
complete your mission,
the CPPC also offers
alumni-contact binders
enabling you to find and
talk to Stanford gradu
ates who are currently
involved in fields of inter
est to you — a don't-miss
chance to get pointers on
job-hunting and learn
more about what opportu
nities lie ahead in the real
world.
On Feb. 15, the CPPC
will host its annual Public
Service Career Faire, an
opportunity to meet and
get information from
those dealing in the field.
So if clawing your way
up the corporate ladder
doesn't appeal to you yet
- or never will — maybe
it's time to leave stereo
types behind and look into
a career in public service.
