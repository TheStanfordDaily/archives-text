# Minority Greek groups on the rise
## New sororities, gay fraternity trying to get started 
### Josh Green Staff writer 
Sure, it's just a "colony" now,
in University jargon.
But Sigma Gamma Rho may
soon become the latest addition to
a growing number of Greek orga
nizations for minorities at Stan
ford, which include an Asian-
American fraternity and sorority
and a gay fraternity.
Senior Susan Salcedo, one of
the sorority's local founding mem
bers, said that the sorority, one of
four national sororities for
African-American women, could
be fully established within the
next year.
Sigma Gamma Rho, started by
Salcedo and fellow seniors Mari
Smith and Felicia Williams, was
recognized by the University in
June as a budding Greek organiza
tion, or "colony." It has already
begun to hold informal social
events.

which would require at least six
students as well as recognition
from the national organization,
would follow a trend of minority
Greek organizations finding
footholds at major universities.
Kappa Delta Phi, a new Asian-

American sorority, and Delta
Lambda Phi, the only national gay
fraternity, are also trying to estab
lish themselves.
Sigma Gamma Rho would join
Delta Sigma Theta and Alpha
Kappa Alpha as the African-
American Greek organizations on
campus.
Salcedo said that she decided to
initiate a new chapter because of
her sense that there was lack of
campus connections for African-
American Stanford students.
"You come to campus as a
freshman, and there's nothing
there you feel you can connect
with," Salcedo said. "Our genera
tion was taught that if you don't
feel right about the way things
are, you should do something
about it. So if you come to campus
and you feel uncomfortable, you
do something about it."
