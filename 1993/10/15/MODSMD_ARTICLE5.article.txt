# Minority Greek groups on the rise
## New sororities, gay fraternity trying to get started 
### Josh Green Staff writer 
Sure, it's just a "colony" now,
in University jargon.
But Sigma Gamma Rho may
soon become the latest addition to
a growing number of Greek orga
nizations for minorities at Stan
ford, which include an Asian-
American fraternity and sorority
and a gay fraternity.
Senior Susan Salcedo, one of
the sorority's local founding mem
bers, said that the sorority, one of
four national sororities for
African-American women, could
be fully established within the
next year.
Sigma Gamma Rho, started by
Salcedo and fellow seniors Mari
Smith and Felicia Williams, was
recognized by the University in
June as a budding Greek organiza
tion, or "colony." It has already
begun to hold informal social
events.
"We've gotten a lot of support

'Our generation was
taught that if you don't
feel rightabout the
way things are, you
should do something
about it.'
â€” Susan Salcedo

for this from the black organiza
tions on campus," Salcedo said. "I
don't think it's been too much of a
struggle (to get established) so
far."
Sigma Gamma Rho's founding,
which would require at least six
students as well as recognition
from the national organization,
would follow a trend of minority
Greek organizations finding
footholds at major universities.
Kappa Delta Phi, a new Asian-

American sorority, and Delta
Lambda Phi, the only national gay
fraternity, are also trying to estab
lish themselves.
Sigma Gamma Rho would join
Delta Sigma Theta and Alpha
Kappa Alpha as the African-
American Greek organizations on
campus.
Salcedo said that she decided to
initiate a new chapter because of
her sense that there was lack of
campus connections for African-
American Stanford students.
"You come to campus as a
freshman, and there's nothing
there you feel you can connect
with," Salcedo said. "Our genera
tion was taught that if you don't
feel right about the way things
are, you should do something
about it. So if you come to campus
and you feel uncomfortable, you
do something about it."
The only national gay fraterni
ty, Delta Lambda Phi, is also at
tempting to get a charter at Stan
ford. Led by junior Jason Moore
and senior Ken Dunn, the frater
nity has already registered itself
with the Office of Student Activi
ties and is waiting to hear from
the national chapter about get
ting colony status.
Since the first organizational
meetings last spring, the fraterni
ty has garnered about 10 interest
ed members, accrued mainly
through word of mouth.
While hoping that the uncon
ventional fraternity avoids any
problems, Dunn said he "can't see

us not running into bumps in the
road."
"I can't help but think that
there may be some raised eye
brows in the [Interfraternity
Councill," he said.
However, Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Heather Dunn said that
Delta Lambda Phi and other
minority organizations will be
treated like any other student
group.
"They're really not any differ
ent from any other fraternities,"
Dunn said.
Senior Mike Champney, presi
dent of the IFC, said there would
be "no problem" in gaining
admittance.
"It would take some of the
pressure off the other fraternities

who have been accused of homo
phobia, and would prove that the
accusations are false," Champney
said.
Asian-American students have
also had progress in the Greek
system. Kappa Delta Phi, the new
Asian-American sorority,
received a charter as an associate
chapter last March.
President Liane Nomura, a
sophomore, said that the 14-
member group is interested in
more interaction with the Inter
sorority Counci.
Another motivation for start
ing the chapter, according to
Nomura, was the underrepresen
tation of Asian-American women
in sororities, even though 25 per
cent of Stanford students are

Asian-American.
Salcedo echoed Nomura's com
ments when she said that her
sorority did not want to isolate
itself from the community.
"We're not looking at this like,
'We're a black group' . . . We're
adding another choice of sorori
ty," Salcedo said.
Senior Jessica Schulman, pres
ident of the 400-member ISC,
said the council welcomes and
wants to establish ties to the new
sororities.
Kappa Delta Phi is currently
working with the ISC to coordi
nate Rush activities.
Lambda Delta Phi, Stanford's
only Asian-American fraternity,
was chartered in 1991 and
entered the IFC last February.
