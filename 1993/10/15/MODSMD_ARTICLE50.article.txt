### Rajiv Chandrasekaran 
Three years of resume packing. Three
weeks shopping for the perfect suit.
Three days agonizing over your
resume: Palatino, or Times?
Three hours combing your hair.
And it's all coming down to the next 15
minutes.
Sure, going to all those get-acquainted
at-the-CPPC workshops was time con
suming, getting the Mac in your computer
cluster to properly format your resume
made you scream, and receiving one of
those oh-so-tiny rejection postcards felt
worse than bombing a final.
But according to those who have career
hunted, the interview is undoubtedly the
most harrowing experience along the path
to a $40,000-a-year, BMW-in-the-garage,
I-got-the-best-job-among-my-friends exis
tence.
It's also the most important, they say.
"A resume and cover letter is simply a
way to get an interview. The interview
really decides whether or not you get the
job," says Kathy Campbell of the Career
Planning and Placement Center. "If you
don't come across well in an interview,
you don't get the job."
To be more than just another name in
a thick stack of resumes, you must leave a
strong — positive — impression with the
interviewer. That sort of "success" isn't
that hard, say career counselors. The key,
they maintain, is preparation.
"Before you go into an interview — just
like an exam — do your homework," says
Campbell, who teaches an interviewing
skills workshop at the CPPC. "An inter
view is not the time to learn about an
organization."
She advises interviewees to research
three specific areas:
• Themselves. Job hunters should sit
down and think about their skills, occupa
tions that interest them, what they do
well and what they have to offer an
employer, among other topics.
"When people ask you a question about
yourself, it shouldn't appear like you've
never thought about it,"says Campbell.
• The occupation. "Know about the
field you want to get into," says Campbell.
"What is a typical day like? What skills are
needed?"
She advises interviewees to contact
Stanford graduates for a real-life perspec
tive on potential careers. The CPPC and
Bowman Alumni House have binders with
alumni contact numbers which are avail
able for students to browse through.
The CPPC also has books, pamphlets

and other information on a variety of
careers.
• The employer. Career counselors sug
gest job hunters familiarize themselves
with a corporation before the interviewing
process. "The employer wants to think
you want to work for them," says
Campbell. "If they leave literature (at the
CPPCI, read it."
Recommended reading includes annual
reports, informational brochures and
news articles about new products or large
changes in the company. The CPPC keeps
some information on file, but Campbell
recommends a trip to the library at the
Graduate School of Business. The
library's Rosenberg Collection has infor
mation regarding a myriad of companies,
including articles and annual reports,
available on CD-ROM.
Although this research process is often
tedious and seemingly useless, career
counselors and those on the other side of
the table — job interviewers — strongly
recommend it.
"Preparation is the biggest thing," says
Greg Paquin, a senior employment con
sultant with Apple Computer's research
and development group. "You don't have
to read 401-Ks, but you should know the
basic information."
That knowledge, Paquin says, will be
helpful when the interviewer asks that
one, last, fateful question: "So do you
have any questions for me?"
Although Paquin says interviewees
don't always have to have them, "home
work" is the best way to formulate
insightful questions about a company.
"Some take the shortcut approach and
interview with lots of companies without
doing the research," Campbell says.
"Those are the folks who paste their doors
with rejection letters."
In addition to knowing about the com
pany, CPPC advisers say interviewees
should expect some "classic" questions, in
particular:
• What are your long-range career
plans?
• Why did you choose to go to
Stanford?
• How did you choose your major?
• What does it take to be successful in
this business?
• Why did you apply to this company?
Don't just give extemporaneous
answers, the counselors say, but instead
think about each question carefully both
before and during the interview.
Interrogate yourself and form concrete
responses.
And always be ready for that where-do-
I-start, please-help-me-out question: "Tell

me a little about yourself."
Paquin says it's natural to feel a sense
of confusion if you're asked a question like
that. He suggests asking the interviewer
to narrow the focus, asking him, for exam
ple, if he wants to know about your hon
ors thesis.
"You should feel comfortable to ask
questions to set the interview's focus," he
says.
When responding to questions, inter
viewees should always follow "yes" or
"no" responses with descriptive and
explanatory remarks.
According to Campbell, a greater num
ber of employers are emphasizing "behav
ioral questions," which require a little
more thought and care on the part of the
interviewee.
"Employers are finding out that the
past is the best predictor of future behav
ior," she says. "Often they will ask ques
tions that will force you to draw upon
experiences from your past. It's really a
good way to work in your accomplish
ments and skills."
And if one of those dreaded thick ques
tions comes up, relax and give a thought
ful response, cautions Campbell. "I've
heard of someone being asked if they'd
rather be a lemming, an earthworm or a
sloth, and why."
Campbell also warns students not to
forget the basics: Practice before the big
day and dress appropriately. "Not too
much after shave, don't wear stuff that
jingles, don't play with a pencil," she
warns. "It seems pretty basic, but you
wouldn't believe how many people do
things like that."
She also suggests interviewing either
early or late in the day, but never, never
right before or after lunch.
Additionally, if the interview suddenly
gets tense or you begin to feel like you're
bombing, a little humor can go along way,
says Paquin. "If you can laugh at yourself,
it's a wonderful way to deflect tension."
John Louie, a 1992 graduate and for
mer Council of Presidents member who is
currently working as a business analyst
for McKinsey and Co. in Ixjs Angeles, says
humor and determination were what
worked for him. "You have to walk into an
interview with the attitude that 'you'd be
a fool not to hire me.' "
Finally, despite all the advice and
preparation an interviewee may have,
Campbell and Paquin say honesty is the
key to a successful interview.
"What you and your employer really
want is the 'real' answer. Don't try to tai
lor your answers to what Apple or
Microsoft or IBM want to hear. If you get
offered a job, how happy will either party
be?" says Paquin. "Just be yourself and
things will usually work out."

Bowman Alumni House have binders with
alumni contact numbers which are avail
able for students to browse through.
The CPPC also has books, pamphlets

and other information on a variety of
careers.
• The employer. Career counselors sug
gest job hunters familiarize themselves
with a corporation before the interviewing
process. "The employer wants to think
you want to work for them," says
Campbell. "If they leave literature (at the
CPPCI, read it."
Recommended reading includes annual
reports, informational brochures and
news articles about new products or large
changes in the company. The CPPC keeps
some information on file, but Campbell
recommends a trip to the library at the
Graduate School of Business. The
library's Rosenberg Collection has infor
mation regarding a myriad of companies,
including articles and annual reports,
available on CD-ROM.
Although this research process is often
tedious and seemingly useless, career
counselors and those on the other side of
the table — job interviewers — strongly
recommend it.
"Preparation is the biggest thing," says
Greg Paquin, a senior employment con
sultant with Apple Computer's research
and development group. "You don't have
to read 401-Ks, but you should know the
basic information."
That knowledge, Paquin says, will be
helpful when the interviewer asks that
one, last, fateful question: "So do you
have any questions for me?"
Although Paquin says interviewees
don't always have to have them, "home
work" is the best way to formulate
insightful questions about a company.
"Some take the shortcut approach and
interview with lots of companies without
doing the research," Campbell says.
"Those are the folks who paste their doors
with rejection letters."
In addition to knowing about the com
pany, CPPC advisers say interviewees
should expect some "classic" questions, in
particular:
• What are your long-range career
plans?
• Why did you choose to go to
Stanford?
• How did you choose your major?
• What does it take to be successful in
this business?
• Why did you apply to this company?
Don't just give extemporaneous
answers, the counselors say, but instead
think about each question carefully both
before and during the interview.
Interrogate yourself and form concrete
responses.
And always be ready for that where-do-
I-start, please-help-me-out question: "Tell

me a little about yourself."
Paquin says it's natural to feel a sense
of confusion if you're asked a question like
that. He suggests asking the interviewer
to narrow the focus, asking him, for exam
ple, if he wants to know about your hon
ors thesis.
"You should feel comfortable to ask
questions to set the interview's focus," he
says.
When responding to questions, inter
viewees should always follow "yes" or
"no" responses with descriptive and
explanatory remarks.
According to Campbell, a greater num
ber of employers are emphasizing "behav
ioral questions," which require a little
more thought and care on the part of the
interviewee.
"Employers are finding out that the
past is the best predictor of future behav
ior," she says. "Often they will ask ques
tions that will force you to draw upon
experiences from your past. It's really a
good way to work in your accomplish
ments and skills."
And if one of those dreaded thick ques
tions comes up, relax and give a thought
ful response, cautions Campbell. "I've
heard of someone being asked if they'd
rather be a lemming, an earthworm or a
sloth, and why."
Campbell also warns students not to
forget the basics: Practice before the big
day and dress appropriately. "Not too
much after shave, don't wear stuff that
jingles, don't play with a pencil," she
warns. "It seems pretty basic, but you
wouldn't believe how many people do
things like that."
She also suggests interviewing either
early or late in the day, but never, never
right before or after lunch.
Additionally, if the interview suddenly
gets tense or you begin to feel like you're
bombing, a little humor can go along way,
says Paquin. "If you can laugh at yourself,
it's a wonderful way to deflect tension."
John Louie, a 1992 graduate and for
mer Council of Presidents member who is
currently working as a business analyst
for McKinsey and Co. in Ixjs Angeles, says
humor and determination were what
worked for him. "You have to walk into an
interview with the attitude that 'you'd be
a fool not to hire me.' "
Finally, despite all the advice and
preparation an interviewee may have,
Campbell and Paquin say honesty is the
key to a successful interview.
"What you and your employer really
want is the 'real' answer. Don't try to tai
lor your answers to what Apple or
Microsoft or IBM want to hear. If you get
offered a job, how happy will either party
be?" says Paquin. "Just be yourself and
things will usually work out."

The next CPPC interviewing workshop
will he held Wednesday, Oct. 20 at 2:15
p.m. in the Tresidder Oak East Lounge.
Three years of resume packing. Three
weeks shopping for the perfect suit.
Three days agonizing over your
resume: Palatino, or Times?
Three hours combing your hair.
And it's all coming down to the next 15
minutes.
Sure, going to all those get-acquainted
at-the-CPPC workshops was time con
suming, getting the Mac in your computer
cluster to properly format your resume
made you scream, and receiving one of
those oh-so-tiny rejection postcards felt
worse than bombing a final.
But according to those who have career
hunted, the interview is undoubtedly the
most harrowing experience along the path
to a $40,000-a-year, BMW-in-the-garage,
I-got-the-best-job-among-my-friends exis
tence.
It's also the most important, they say.
"A resume and cover letter is simply a
way to get an interview. The interview
really decides whether or not you get the
job," says Kathy Campbell of the Career
Planning and Placement Center. "If you
don't come across well in an interview,
you don't get the job."
To be more than just another name in
a thick stack of resumes, you must leave a
strong — positive — impression with the
interviewer. That sort of "success" isn't
that hard, say career counselors. The key,
they maintain, is preparation.
"Before you go into an interview — just
like an exam — do your homework," says
Campbell, who teaches an interviewing
skills workshop at the CPPC. "An inter
view is not the time to learn about an
organization."
She advises interviewees to research
three specific areas:
• Themselves. Job hunters should sit
down and think about their skills, occupa
tions that interest them, what they do
well and what they have to offer an
employer, among other topics.
"When people ask you a question about
yourself, it shouldn't appear like you've
never thought about it,"says Campbell.
• The occupation. "Know about the
field you want to get into," says Campbell.
"What is a typical day like? What skills are
needed?"

Stanford graduates for a real-life perspec
tive on potential careers. The CPPC and
