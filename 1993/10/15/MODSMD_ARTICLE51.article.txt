Writing a resume is kind of like trying to tell
that mustachioed, portly aunt whom you only
see at family reunions every five years what's
going on in your life: she doesn't really care
what you say, as long as it sounds impressive
and it implies lots of cash flow.
OK, it may be important for a potential
employer to know you have real experience,
say, a summer internship at IBM, rather than
serving as a "food aspect manager" of the bro
colli fritata at Flo Mo food service.
Resume writing is an art few master. Yet
creating a well-formatted, thoughtfully
planned-out resume is not an impossible task.
By keeping a few simple ideas in mind,
Stanford students can break out of job-search
mediocrity.
"Employers want to be able to identify key
skills you've developed or used elsewhere
which you could apply to the new job," accord
ing to A 1 Levin, assistant director of graduate
counseling and programs at the Career
Planning and Placement Center, pinpointing
the basic goal of any good resume.
But the catch, according to Levin, is that
most potential employers will generally look
over your resume for only 10 to 20 seconds.
Consequently — though not to de-emphasize
content — a strong resume is a clear, concise
description of your relevant job history.
"Relevant" and "concise" are the two words to
always bear in mind.
According to Levin and the handout he
helped author — "Resumes and Cover Letters
For Master's Level Students," available at the
CPPC — it is crucial for a job-seeker to keep
the reader, and the brevity of his or her
encounter with your resume, in mind.
"If employers have a stack of resumes laid
out in front of them, those with things laid out
well so the reader can find information quickly
will have an advantage," Levin said.
Hence organization, layout, headings and
fonts are crucial factors in the success of a
resume. The CPPC handout approximates
only a meager 5 percent to be successful.
In their resumes, Stanford students, even
those unenthusiastic about the prospect of
resume-packing, should not be hesitant to
extol their virtues, making sure to use active
verbs to describe duties and skills. Also impor
tant is avoiding the dreaded "responsible for,"
duties include" and "worked on."
Students also should not hesitate to include
activities and positions which may not fill the
stereotypical concept of "job experience."
According to Levin, many students neglect to
