Writing a resume is kind of like trying to tell
that mustachioed, portly aunt whom you only
see at family reunions every five years what's
going on in your life: she doesn't really care
what you say, as long as it sounds impressive
and it implies lots of cash flow.
OK, it may be important for a potential
employer to know you have real experience,
say, a summer internship at IBM, rather than
serving as a "food aspect manager" of the bro
colli fritata at Flo Mo food service.
Resume writing is an art few master. Yet
creating a well-formatted, thoughtfully
planned-out resume is not an impossible task.
By keeping a few simple ideas in mind,
Stanford students can break out of job-search
mediocrity.
"Employers want to be able to identify key
skills you've developed or used elsewhere
which you could apply to the new job," accord
ing to A 1 Levin, assistant director of graduate
counseling and programs at the Career
Planning and Placement Center, pinpointing
the basic goal of any good resume.
But the catch, according to Levin, is that
most potential employers will generally look
over your resume for only 10 to 20 seconds.
Consequently — though not to de-emphasize
content — a strong resume is a clear, concise
description of your relevant job history.
"Relevant" and "concise" are the two words to
always bear in mind.
According to Levin and the handout he
helped author — "Resumes and Cover Letters
For Master's Level Students," available at the
CPPC — it is crucial for a job-seeker to keep
the reader, and the brevity of his or her
encounter with your resume, in mind.
"If employers have a stack of resumes laid
out in front of them, those with things laid out
well so the reader can find information quickly
will have an advantage," Levin said.
Hence organization, layout, headings and
fonts are crucial factors in the success of a
resume. The CPPC handout approximates
only a meager 5 percent to be successful.
In their resumes, Stanford students, even
those unenthusiastic about the prospect of
resume-packing, should not be hesitant to
extol their virtues, making sure to use active
verbs to describe duties and skills. Also impor
tant is avoiding the dreaded "responsible for,"
duties include" and "worked on."
Students also should not hesitate to include
activities and positions which may not fill the
stereotypical concept of "job experience."
According to Levin, many students neglect to
include volunteer experiences, student)
leadership experiences and work done
in unpaid positions.
Students can further beef up
resumes by including secondary attrib
utes such as academic service, honors
and international experience. Study
abroad, community service, awards and
foreign language proficiency can also be
important bonuses in the eyes of a
potential employers.
You may choose to include personal
interests, hobbies and other talents to
personalize your resume, but Levin
advises against listing the general sub
jects of travel, reading or music. Flat,
generic activities such as these are
highlighted too frequently in an
attempt to catch the eye of the reader.
Basically, most employers are look
ing for talents and qualities which
future employees posess that will pro
vide a good match with the particular
duties, challenges, and responsibilities

of the offered job. Consequently, not
only heavenly, salaried stock-market
positions and nearly unobtainable
internships count in the resume game.
Getting to the more nuts-and-bolts
aspects of a resume, the "Master's
Level" CPPC handout has dozens of
tips for exactly how to create your own
personal description — from using 10
or 12-point Times or Palatino font, to
using a bold-face type for your name, to
avoiding the use of acronyms, to the
three resume formats: chronological,

functional or combination.
When choosing a resume style, once
again keep your reader in mind. It is
necessary to decide whether an empha
sis on education, employment experi
ence and titles — all including dates
is more important, or whether a format
emphasizing skills rather than details
(or a combination of both styles) is bet
ter for you.
If looking for a position in a specific
job field, students may want to opt to
include a "job objective" heading in
their resume. Hv designating a some
what specific job title, two skills which

the student would like to use in that
particular job, and emphasizing the gen
eral type of company the student is
interested in working for, he or she can
highlight a certain degree of focus in
their search.
Finally, Levin reminds students that
the resume is merely an introduction
for employers, acting more as an outline
of work experience and personal skills.
He emphasizes the benefits of a good
cover letter to convey interests, goals
and objectives, to fill in the gaps in a
resume and give a more personal touch
to the job-search process.

Getting to the more nuts-and-bolts
aspects of a resume, the "Master's
Level" CPPC handout has dozens of
tips for exactly how to create your own
personal description — from using 10
or 12-point Times or Palatino font, to
using a bold-face type for your name, to
avoiding the use of acronyms, to the
three resume formats: chronological,

functional or combination.
When choosing a resume style, once
again keep your reader in mind. It is
necessary to decide whether an empha
sis on education, employment experi
ence and titles — all including dates
is more important, or whether a format
emphasizing skills rather than details
(or a combination of both styles) is bet
ter for you.
If looking for a position in a specific
job field, students may want to opt to
include a "job objective" heading in
their resume. Hv designating a some
what specific job title, two skills which

the student would like to use in that
particular job, and emphasizing the gen
eral type of company the student is
interested in working for, he or she can
highlight a certain degree of focus in
their search.
Finally, Levin reminds students that
the resume is merely an introduction
for employers, acting more as an outline
of work experience and personal skills.
He emphasizes the benefits of a good
cover letter to convey interests, goals
and objectives, to fill in the gaps in a
resume and give a more personal touch
to the job-search process.

Writing a resume is kind of like trying to tell
that mustachioed, portly aunt whom you only
see at family reunions every five years what's
going on in your life: she doesn't really care
what you say, as long as it sounds impressive
and it implies lots of cash flow.
OK, it may be important for a potential
employer to know you have real experience,
say, a summer internship at IBM, rather than
serving as a "food aspect manager" of the bro
colli fritata at Flo Mo food service.
Resume writing is an art few master. Yet
creating a well-formatted, thoughtfully
planned-out resume is not an impossible task.
By keeping a few simple ideas in mind,
Stanford students can break out of job-search
mediocrity.
"Employers want to be able to identify key
skills you've developed or used elsewhere
which you could apply to the new job," accord
ing to A 1 Levin, assistant director of graduate
counseling and programs at the Career
Planning and Placement Center, pinpointing
the basic goal of any good resume.
But the catch, according to Levin, is that
most potential employers will generally look
over your resume for only 10 to 20 seconds.
Consequently — though not to de-emphasize
content — a strong resume is a clear, concise
description of your relevant job history.
"Relevant" and "concise" are the two words to
always bear in mind.
According to Levin and the handout he
helped author — "Resumes and Cover Letters
For Master's Level Students," available at the
CPPC — it is crucial for a job-seeker to keep
the reader, and the brevity of his or her
encounter with your resume, in mind.
"If employers have a stack of resumes laid
out in front of them, those with things laid out
well so the reader can find information quickly
will have an advantage," Levin said.
Hence organization, layout, headings and
fonts are crucial factors in the success of a
resume. The CPPC handout approximates
only a meager 5 percent to be successful.
In their resumes, Stanford students, even
those unenthusiastic about the prospect of
resume-packing, should not be hesitant to
extol their virtues, making sure to use active
verbs to describe duties and skills. Also impor
tant is avoiding the dreaded "responsible for,"
duties include" and "worked on."
Students also should not hesitate to include
activities and positions which may not fill the
stereotypical concept of "job experience."
According to Levin, many students neglect to
include volunteer experiences, student)
leadership experiences and work done
in unpaid positions.
Students can further beef up
