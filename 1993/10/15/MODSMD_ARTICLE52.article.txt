# Pounding the pavement
## Winning the rat race any way you can 
### Sam Williams 
What is your favorite Stanford
memory? Any of the last six Big
Games? The old Kamikaze night at
the Phi Delt house? Discussing gender
issues in your freshman English
class?
For me, my favorite memory of
attending Stanford was walking
around Palo Alto every weekday at 1
p.m. in the afternoon. Unlike the
hordes of Paly High kids riding their
skateboards down the California
Street pedestrian tunnel, I had the
perfect excuse for loitering. I was a
college student, and I loved it.
That's why I took it a little hard
when they handed me that diploma in
June of my senior year. I mean, here I
was, a student all my life — with occa
sional detours into the field of under
employment during summer vaca
tions — and now they were telling me
to find something else to do with my

sunny weekday
afternoons.

It was at that point I made the
biggest mistake of my life.
I got a job.
Not that having a job is bad. I have
found jobs an excellent way to spend
your time while both making money;
and, more importantly, not spending
money. I, however, made the mistake
of picking your traditional eight-to
five, spend-the-last-fou r-hours-pre
tending-to-work job, which suddenly
made it very hard for me to enjoy my
weekday afternoons.
I lost all the freedom I enjoyed as a
college student. I found myself mak
ing sentimental trips back to the cam
pus on weekends. 1 envied students
who wore shorts while I ruined pair
after pair of slacks sweating on the
drive to work. I began cutting off bicy
clists who brazenly challenged my
right of way on Campus Drive. In
short, I had turned into an alum, only
three months after graduation.
Then, a miracle happened: I was
laid off. 1 was the victim of my first

corporate downsizing. I spent
the following summer look
ing for similar work, only to
find the jobs which had been
few and far between when I
graduated had disappeared
completely a year later.
After a few months of
crossing out the network
marketing ads in the job
pages, I finally caught a
glimpse of what I was up
against when 1 applied for a
$6-an-hour job at the local
bookstore, only to find 40
resumes ahead of mine.

The next day, instead
of applying for more
vice-president-of-mar
keting openings, I low

ered my sights and
applied for a few
part-time jobs I
found on a local bul
letin board. Within
two days I had
received four phone
calls, two of which
were job offers, and

within a week I was working again at
jobs closer to my work and interest
level. Best of all, I had my afternoons
free.
What my pathetic little anecdote is
trying to show is that in the modern
workplace, the traditional full-time
job is quickly disappearing. Just take
a look at the companies that used to
line up at the CPPC like major league
baseball scouts in San Pedro de
Macoris to get a chance at the fresh
crop of Stanford phenoms. IBM,
Apple, Microsoft — companies that
were hiring even English majors a few
years ago — are jettisoning those jobs
quicker than you can rhyme "leaner"
with "meaner."
As a soon-to-be Stanford graduate,
you should be prepared for this situa
tion, and one of the ways to prepare is
to realize that there are other options
out there that will keep you afloat and
may even put you ahead of the compe
tition in the unending fight for work.
Working independently, freelancing,
consulting, schlepping, call it what
you will, but unless you can scrape
together enough money for a bus ride
to Denver, here are some tips for you
to follow:
The first and most difficult thing to
overcome when you are between or
among jobs is the stigma that comes
with not having a single full-time job.
Believe me, money is a distant second.
Any person who has taken five min
utes at a party to explain their major
will understand what I'm talking
about. It's the same outside of school,
except in the real world people will
judge you even more on the basis of
what you do rather than who you are.
There are a few ways to get around
this:
• Lie. This method is very effective.
Instead of saying that you wait tables
while waiting for your manuscript to
get published, just say that it already
has been published and a film version
is coming out. Advantages: really
impresses people. Disadvantages: oh
what a tangled web we weave . . ,
• Distort the truth. This way you

exaggerate the manuscript part,
leave out the waiting tables part alto
gether and maybe throw in a little
white lie about when it will be pub
lished. Advantages: people already
assume you wait tables, so they
won't be bogged down by your self
loathing when you admit it.
Disadvantages: a year later, you
might still be waiting tables.
• Tell the whole truth. This way you
tell everything: you wait tables 90 per
cent of the time, spend what little
free time you have left to get over
your writer's block and really hate
being interrogated by nosy people.
Advantages: good for the soul.
Disadvantages: everybody else is
using methods one and two, so you
will come across as having an atti
tude problem.
Next comes money. Face it, if you
are a college student you are used to
living on little or no money at all. If a
company paid you $20,000 or
$40,000, you wouldn't know the dif
ference, except your friends would be
making you pay for all the drinks
when you go out.
Sooner or later, however, it's nice
to have a bookcase that isn't made
out of bricks and planks. This
requires money. Also, you might
want other amenities like chairs,
couches, a real TV with vertical hold.

These too
require
money,
unless
you eel-

ehrate more than
one birthday a|
year. And if you'
are one of the
sorry souls who
has a student
loan to pay off
this will als<
require money
Lots of money.
There are twi
rules for makin;
money afte
school: One, don'
buy a new ca
(unless you ca
sleep in it comfor
ably). Two, don
work for free.
The first rule

but the second is the hardest to fol
low. There are many ways people can
get you to work for free. You can be
dumb enough to agree to work for
free as with unpaid (read: slave)
internships. You can work for a com
pany and not get paid. This is a quick
way to learn how American business
works. It's like all those free CDs you
got from Columbia Records Club and
never paid for, except it's not so
funny this time. Or you can be over
worked and underpaid, essentially
putting in extra hours on a fixed con
tract to get the job right — sort of
the CalTrans method.
How can you avoid breaking rule
No. 2? You can't, but one of the great
things about working freelance is
that you quickly learn from your mis
takes. Soon you will be firmer about
your hourly rates. You will develop
working relationships with people
and companies you know to be good
payers. And you will not hesitate to
sponge off friends and family.
I know this may sound depressing,
especially if you've based your
whole life on getting that big, pow
erful corporate job with the bloated,
ridiculous salary that a few of your
lucky friends will grab straight out
of school. What you don't know,
however, is that those salaries are a
sophisticated trick to get your friend
to work for free.
If you divide your friend's take
home pay by the ever-increasing
denominator of 50-, 60- and 70-hour
weeks, you will find they have gone
from wait ing tables to washing dishes.
The third most important factor is
time, or in your case, lack of it. You
will need to work just as much as
evervbodv else, meaning that you will

have to piece together two, three,
even four jobs to make ends meet.
Disadvantage: every job is stressful
enough without having to worry
about getting to your second or third
job on time. Add the fact that the
easier jobs to get are at the worst
hours, and you may find your circadi
an rhythms slip into 5/4 time.
The supreme advantage of work
ing several jobs is that you have mul
tiple options. If you work for one
company, you have only one option
and little time to exercise your out
side interests. If you have several
jobs, you can pick and choose the jobs
which hold the most for your future,
financial needs and personal enjoy
ment. It's also less painful to dump a
bad job. Hut most importantly, you
can use a quick succession of jobs to
build up experience.
To illustrate this last point, imag
ine you are out of work. That
shouldn't be hard to do, because you
probably are out of work. You go
around from company to company
handing out your thin-margined
resumes with Stanford University in
bold, 24-point Helvetica font.
Unfortunately for you, your resume
looks a little thin when compared to
the middle manager from Apple
Computer who just got laid off a
month ago, so every company tells
you thanks but no thanks.
Now you're nervous. Suddenly you
notice everything is costing you
money: food, rent, light bulbs, those
stupid resumes vou had done at


Kinkos. You know that you have to
do something to get money back into
your bank account, so you look for
part time work in your field of inter
est. If your are interested in TV,
maybe an eight-hour-a-week produc
tion assistant job with a Korean pub
lic television station.
Now you realize that your eight
hour-a-week job will pay for your
phone bill for one week. You still
need more work, so you look for a
second job. If you are interested in
writing, maybe a 20-hour-a-week

word-processing job for a local com
pany that publishes New Age tracks.
I must pause here to remind you of
that time-honored adage, "a job is a
job" — but you already know that.
Now you have two jobs, two new
places to network and two new items
to put on your resume. You have two
new resumes, for that matter, a writ
ing resume and a TV resume. Rut
you're not done yet.
What you want to do at this point,
besides getting a third job for a pizza
delivery place to bring your income up
to poverty standards, is continue

developing these jobs. Either
the part-time jobs turn into
better, full-time jobs, or you
dump them altogether, mov
ing onward and upward.
Pretty soon your resume is so
fat that you ( 1 know this
may sound a little crazy
here) leave off some of the
jobs that don't apply to the
position you're looking for,
and emphasize the ones
that do. This is what's
known as a career.
These are choices
you will be making when it
comes time to bid farewell
to the Island of Stanford.
If you're lucky, maybe you
won't have to kick and

scratch for work. But if you do, it
helps to keep in mind that what you
do today can help, rather than delay
what you hope to do tomorrow.
Until then, go spend your after
noon loitering in front of a Palo Alto
office building for me.

lucky friends will grab straight out
of school. What you don't know,
however, is that those salaries are a
sophisticated trick to get your friend
to work for free.
If you divide your friend's take
home pay by the ever-increasing
denominator of 50-, 60- and 70-hour
weeks, you will find they have gone
from wait ing tables to washing dishes.
The third most important factor is
time, or in your case, lack of it. You
will need to work just as much as
evervbodv else, meaning that you will

have to piece together two, three,
even four jobs to make ends meet.
Disadvantage: every job is stressful
enough without having to worry
about getting to your second or third
job on time. Add the fact that the
easier jobs to get are at the worst
hours, and you may find your circadi
an rhythms slip into 5/4 time.
The supreme advantage of work
ing several jobs is that you have mul
tiple options. If you work for one
company, you have only one option
and little time to exercise your out
side interests. If you have several
jobs, you can pick and choose the jobs
which hold the most for your future,
financial needs and personal enjoy
ment. It's also less painful to dump a
bad job. Hut most importantly, you
can use a quick succession of jobs to
build up experience.
To illustrate this last point, imag
ine you are out of work. That
shouldn't be hard to do, because you
probably are out of work. You go
around from company to company
handing out your thin-margined
resumes with Stanford University in
bold, 24-point Helvetica font.
Unfortunately for you, your resume
looks a little thin when compared to
the middle manager from Apple
Computer who just got laid off a
month ago, so every company tells
you thanks but no thanks.
Now you're nervous. Suddenly you
notice everything is costing you
money: food, rent, light bulbs, those
stupid resumes vou had done at


Kinkos. You know that you have to
do something to get money back into
your bank account, so you look for
part time work in your field of inter
est. If your are interested in TV,
maybe an eight-hour-a-week produc
tion assistant job with a Korean pub
lic television station.
Now you realize that your eight
hour-a-week job will pay for your
phone bill for one week. You still
need more work, so you look for a
second job. If you are interested in
writing, maybe a 20-hour-a-week

word-processing job for a local com
pany that publishes New Age tracks.
I must pause here to remind you of
that time-honored adage, "a job is a
job" — but you already know that.
Now you have two jobs, two new
places to network and two new items
to put on your resume. You have two
new resumes, for that matter, a writ
ing resume and a TV resume. Rut
you're not done yet.
What you want to do at this point,
besides getting a third job for a pizza
delivery place to bring your income up
to poverty standards, is continue

developing these jobs. Either
the part-time jobs turn into
better, full-time jobs, or you
dump them altogether, mov
ing onward and upward.
Pretty soon your resume is so
fat that you ( 1 know this
may sound a little crazy
here) leave off some of the
jobs that don't apply to the
position you're looking for,
and emphasize the ones
that do. This is what's
known as a career.
These are choices
you will be making when it
comes time to bid farewell
to the Island of Stanford.
If you're lucky, maybe you
won't have to kick and

scratch for work. But if you do, it
helps to keep in mind that what you
do today can help, rather than delay
what you hope to do tomorrow.
Until then, go spend your after
noon loitering in front of a Palo Alto
office building for me.

What is your favorite Stanford
memory? Any of the last six Big
Games? The old Kamikaze night at
the Phi Delt house? Discussing gender
issues in your freshman English
class?
For me, my favorite memory of
attending Stanford was walking
around Palo Alto every weekday at 1
p.m. in the afternoon. Unlike the
hordes of Paly High kids riding their
skateboards down the California
Street pedestrian tunnel, I had the
perfect excuse for loitering. I was a
college student, and I loved it.
That's why I took it a little hard
when they handed me that diploma in
June of my senior year. I mean, here I
was, a student all my life — with occa
sional detours into the field of under
employment during summer vaca
tions — and now they were telling me
to find something else to do with my

sunny weekday
afternoons.

It was at that point I made the
biggest mistake of my life.
I got a job.
Not that having a job is bad. I have
found jobs an excellent way to spend
your time while both making money;
and, more importantly, not spending
money. I, however, made the mistake
of picking your traditional eight-to
five, spend-the-last-fou r-hours-pre
tending-to-work job, which suddenly
made it very hard for me to enjoy my
weekday afternoons.
I lost all the freedom I enjoyed as a
college student. I found myself mak
ing sentimental trips back to the cam
pus on weekends. 1 envied students
who wore shorts while I ruined pair
after pair of slacks sweating on the
drive to work. I began cutting off bicy
clists who brazenly challenged my
right of way on Campus Drive. In
short, I had turned into an alum, only
three months after graduation.
Then, a miracle happened: I was
laid off. 1 was the victim of my first

corporate downsizing. I spent
the following summer look
ing for similar work, only to
find the jobs which had been
few and far between when I
graduated had disappeared
completely a year later.
After a few months of
crossing out the network
marketing ads in the job
pages, I finally caught a
glimpse of what I was up
against when 1 applied for a
$6-an-hour job at the local
bookstore, only to find 40
resumes ahead of mine.

The next day, instead
of applying for more
vice-president-of-mar
keting openings, I low

ered my sights and
applied for a few
part-time jobs I
found on a local bul
letin board. Within
two days I had
received four phone
calls, two of which
were job offers, and

within a week I was working again at
jobs closer to my work and interest
level. Best of all, I had my afternoons
free.
What my pathetic little anecdote is
trying to show is that in the modern
workplace, the traditional full-time
job is quickly disappearing. Just take
a look at the companies that used to
line up at the CPPC like major league
baseball scouts in San Pedro de
Macoris to get a chance at the fresh
crop of Stanford phenoms. IBM,
Apple, Microsoft — companies that
were hiring even English majors a few
years ago — are jettisoning those jobs
quicker than you can rhyme "leaner"
with "meaner."
As a soon-to-be Stanford graduate,
you should be prepared for this situa
tion, and one of the ways to prepare is
to realize that there are other options
out there that will keep you afloat and
may even put you ahead of the compe
tition in the unending fight for work.
Working independently, freelancing,
consulting, schlepping, call it what
you will, but unless you can scrape
together enough money for a bus ride
to Denver, here are some tips for you
to follow:
The first and most difficult thing to
overcome when you are between or
among jobs is the stigma that comes
with not having a single full-time job.
Believe me, money is a distant second.
Any person who has taken five min
utes at a party to explain their major
will understand what I'm talking
about. It's the same outside of school,
except in the real world people will
judge you even more on the basis of
what you do rather than who you are.
There are a few ways to get around
this:
• Lie. This method is very effective.
Instead of saying that you wait tables
while waiting for your manuscript to
get published, just say that it already
has been published and a film version
is coming out. Advantages: really
impresses people. Disadvantages: oh
what a tangled web we weave . . ,
• Distort the truth. This way you

exaggerate the manuscript part,
leave out the waiting tables part alto
gether and maybe throw in a little
white lie about when it will be pub
lished. Advantages: people already
assume you wait tables, so they
won't be bogged down by your self
loathing when you admit it.
Disadvantages: a year later, you
might still be waiting tables.
• Tell the whole truth. This way you
tell everything: you wait tables 90 per
cent of the time, spend what little
free time you have left to get over
your writer's block and really hate
being interrogated by nosy people.
Advantages: good for the soul.
Disadvantages: everybody else is
using methods one and two, so you
will come across as having an atti
tude problem.
Next comes money. Face it, if you
are a college student you are used to
living on little or no money at all. If a
company paid you $20,000 or
$40,000, you wouldn't know the dif
ference, except your friends would be
making you pay for all the drinks
when you go out.
Sooner or later, however, it's nice
to have a bookcase that isn't made
out of bricks and planks. This
requires money. Also, you might
want other amenities like chairs,
couches, a real TV with vertical hold.

These too
require
money,
unless
you eel-

ehrate more than
one birthday a|
year. And if you'
are one of the
sorry souls who
has a student
loan to pay off
this will als<
require money
Lots of money.
There are twi
rules for makin;
money afte
school: One, don'
buy a new ca
(unless you ca
sleep in it comfor
ably). Two, don
work for free.
The first rule

but the second is the hardest to fol
low. There are many ways people can
get you to work for free. You can be
dumb enough to agree to work for
free as with unpaid (read: slave)
internships. You can work for a com
pany and not get paid. This is a quick
way to learn how American business
works. It's like all those free CDs you
got from Columbia Records Club and
never paid for, except it's not so
funny this time. Or you can be over
worked and underpaid, essentially
putting in extra hours on a fixed con
tract to get the job right — sort of
the CalTrans method.
How can you avoid breaking rule
No. 2? You can't, but one of the great
things about working freelance is
that you quickly learn from your mis
takes. Soon you will be firmer about
your hourly rates. You will develop
working relationships with people
and companies you know to be good
payers. And you will not hesitate to
sponge off friends and family.
I know this may sound depressing,
especially if you've based your
whole life on getting that big, pow
erful corporate job with the bloated,
ridiculous salary that a few of your
lucky friends will grab straight out
of school. What you don't know,
however, is that those salaries are a
sophisticated trick to get your friend

out there that will keep you afloat and
may even put you ahead of the compe
tition in the unending fight for work.
Working independently, freelancing,
consulting, schlepping, call it what
you will, but unless you can scrape
together enough money for a bus ride
to Denver, here are some tips for you
to follow:
The first and most difficult thing to
overcome when you are between or
among jobs is the stigma that comes
with not having a single full-time job.
Believe me, money is a distant second.
Any person who has taken five min
utes at a party to explain their major
will understand what I'm talking
about. It's the same outside of school,
except in the real world people will
judge you even more on the basis of
what you do rather than who you are.
There are a few ways to get around
this:
• Lie. This method is very effective.
Instead of saying that you wait tables
while waiting for your manuscript to
get published, just say that it already
has been published and a film version
is coming out. Advantages: really
impresses people. Disadvantages: oh
what a tangled web we weave . . ,
• Distort the truth. This way you

exaggerate the manuscript part,
leave out the waiting tables part alto
gether and maybe throw in a little
white lie about when it will be pub
lished. Advantages: people already
assume you wait tables, so they
won't be bogged down by your self
loathing when you admit it.
Disadvantages: a year later, you
might still be waiting tables.
• Tell the whole truth. This way you
tell everything: you wait tables 90 per
cent of the time, spend what little
free time you have left to get over
your writer's block and really hate
being interrogated by nosy people.
Advantages: good for the soul.
Disadvantages: everybody else is
using methods one and two, so you
will come across as having an atti
tude problem.
Next comes money. Face it, if you
are a college student you are used to
living on little or no money at all. If a
company paid you $20,000 or
$40,000, you wouldn't know the dif
ference, except your friends would be
making you pay for all the drinks
when you go out.
Sooner or later, however, it's nice
to have a bookcase that isn't made
out of bricks and planks. This
requires money. Also, you might
want other amenities like chairs,
couches, a real TV with vertical hold.

These too
require
money,
unless
you eel-

ehrate more than
one birthday a|
year. And if you'
are one of the
sorry souls who
has a student
loan to pay off
this will als<
require money
Lots of money.
There are twi
rules for makin;
money afte
school: One, don'
buy a new ca
(unless you ca
sleep in it comfor
ably). Two, don
work for free.
The first rule

but the second is the hardest to fol
low. There are many ways people can
get you to work for free. You can be
dumb enough to agree to work for
free as with unpaid (read: slave)
internships. You can work for a com
pany and not get paid. This is a quick
way to learn how American business
works. It's like all those free CDs you
got from Columbia Records Club and
never paid for, except it's not so
funny this time. Or you can be over
worked and underpaid, essentially
putting in extra hours on a fixed con
tract to get the job right — sort of
the CalTrans method.
How can you avoid breaking rule
No. 2? You can't, but one of the great
things about working freelance is
that you quickly learn from your mis
takes. Soon you will be firmer about
your hourly rates. You will develop
working relationships with people
and companies you know to be good
payers. And you will not hesitate to
sponge off friends and family.
I know this may sound depressing,
especially if you've based your
whole life on getting that big, pow
erful corporate job with the bloated,
ridiculous salary that a few of your
lucky friends will grab straight out
of school. What you don't know,
however, is that those salaries are a
sophisticated trick to get your friend
to work for free.
If you divide your friend's take
home pay by the ever-increasing
denominator of 50-, 60- and 70-hour
weeks, you will find they have gone
from wait ing tables to washing dishes.
The third most important factor is
time, or in your case, lack of it. You
will need to work just as much as
evervbodv else, meaning that you will

have to piece together two, three,
even four jobs to make ends meet.
Disadvantage: every job is stressful
enough without having to worry
about getting to your second or third
job on time. Add the fact that the
easier jobs to get are at the worst
hours, and you may find your circadi
an rhythms slip into 5/4 time.
The supreme advantage of work
ing several jobs is that you have mul
tiple options. If you work for one
company, you have only one option
and little time to exercise your out
side interests. If you have several
jobs, you can pick and choose the jobs
which hold the most for your future,
financial needs and personal enjoy
ment. It's also less painful to dump a
bad job. Hut most importantly, you
can use a quick succession of jobs to
build up experience.
To illustrate this last point, imag
ine you are out of work. That
shouldn't be hard to do, because you
probably are out of work. You go
around from company to company
handing out your thin-margined
resumes with Stanford University in
bold, 24-point Helvetica font.
Unfortunately for you, your resume
looks a little thin when compared to
the middle manager from Apple
Computer who just got laid off a
month ago, so every company tells
you thanks but no thanks.
Now you're nervous. Suddenly you
notice everything is costing you
money: food, rent, light bulbs, those
stupid resumes vou had done at


Kinkos. You know that you have to
do something to get money back into
your bank account, so you look for
part time work in your field of inter
est. If your are interested in TV,
maybe an eight-hour-a-week produc
tion assistant job with a Korean pub
lic television station.
Now you realize that your eight
hour-a-week job will pay for your
phone bill for one week. You still
need more work, so you look for a
second job. If you are interested in
writing, maybe a 20-hour-a-week

word-processing job for a local com
pany that publishes New Age tracks.
I must pause here to remind you of
that time-honored adage, "a job is a
job" — but you already know that.
Now you have two jobs, two new
places to network and two new items
to put on your resume. You have two
new resumes, for that matter, a writ
ing resume and a TV resume. Rut
you're not done yet.
What you want to do at this point,
besides getting a third job for a pizza
delivery place to bring your income up
to poverty standards, is continue

developing these jobs. Either
the part-time jobs turn into
better, full-time jobs, or you
dump them altogether, mov
ing onward and upward.
Pretty soon your resume is so
fat that you ( 1 know this
may sound a little crazy
here) leave off some of the
jobs that don't apply to the
position you're looking for,
and emphasize the ones
that do. This is what's
known as a career.
These are choices
you will be making when it
comes time to bid farewell
to the Island of Stanford.
If you're lucky, maybe you
won't have to kick and

scratch for work. But if you do, it
helps to keep in mind that what you
do today can help, rather than delay
what you hope to do tomorrow.
Until then, go spend your after
noon loitering in front of a Palo Alto
office building for me.

What is your favorite Stanford
memory? Any of the last six Big
Games? The old Kamikaze night at
the Phi Delt house? Discussing gender
issues in your freshman English
class?
For me, my favorite memory of
attending Stanford was walking
around Palo Alto every weekday at 1
p.m. in the afternoon. Unlike the
hordes of Paly High kids riding their
skateboards down the California
Street pedestrian tunnel, I had the
perfect excuse for loitering. I was a
college student, and I loved it.
That's why I took it a little hard
when they handed me that diploma in
June of my senior year. I mean, here I
was, a student all my life — with occa
sional detours into the field of under
employment during summer vaca
tions — and now they were telling me
to find something else to do with my

sunny weekday
afternoons.

It was at that point I made the
biggest mistake of my life.
I got a job.
Not that having a job is bad. I have
found jobs an excellent way to spend
your time while both making money;
and, more importantly, not spending
money. I, however, made the mistake
of picking your traditional eight-to
five, spend-the-last-fou r-hours-pre
tending-to-work job, which suddenly
made it very hard for me to enjoy my
weekday afternoons.
I lost all the freedom I enjoyed as a
college student. I found myself mak
ing sentimental trips back to the cam
pus on weekends. 1 envied students
who wore shorts while I ruined pair
after pair of slacks sweating on the
drive to work. I began cutting off bicy
clists who brazenly challenged my
right of way on Campus Drive. In
short, I had turned into an alum, only
three months after graduation.
Then, a miracle happened: I was
laid off. 1 was the victim of my first

corporate downsizing. I spent
the following summer look
ing for similar work, only to
find the jobs which had been
few and far between when I
graduated had disappeared
completely a year later.
After a few months of
crossing out the network
marketing ads in the job
pages, I finally caught a
glimpse of what I was up
against when 1 applied for a
$6-an-hour job at the local
bookstore, only to find 40
resumes ahead of mine.

The next day, instead
of applying for more
vice-president-of-mar
keting openings, I low

ered my sights and
applied for a few
part-time jobs I
found on a local bul
letin board. Within
two days I had
received four phone
calls, two of which
were job offers, and

within a week I was working again at
jobs closer to my work and interest
level. Best of all, I had my afternoons
free.
What my pathetic little anecdote is
trying to show is that in the modern
workplace, the traditional full-time
job is quickly disappearing. Just take
a look at the companies that used to
line up at the CPPC like major league
baseball scouts in San Pedro de
Macoris to get a chance at the fresh
crop of Stanford phenoms. IBM,
Apple, Microsoft — companies that
were hiring even English majors a few
years ago — are jettisoning those jobs
quicker than you can rhyme "leaner"
with "meaner."
As a soon-to-be Stanford graduate,
you should be prepared for this situa
tion, and one of the ways to prepare is
to realize that there are other options
out there that will keep you afloat and
may even put you ahead of the compe
tition in the unending fight for work.
Working independently, freelancing,
consulting, schlepping, call it what
you will, but unless you can scrape
