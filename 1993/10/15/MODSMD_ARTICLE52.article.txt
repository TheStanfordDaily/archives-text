# Pounding the pavement
## Winning the rat race any way you can

What is your favorite Stanford
memory? Any of the last six Big
Games? The old Kamikaze night at
the Phi Delt house? Discussing gender
issues in your freshman English
class?
For me, my favorite memory of
attending Stanford was walking
around Palo Alto every weekday at 1
p.m. in the afternoon. Unlike the
hordes of Paly High kids riding their
skateboards down the California
Street pedestrian tunnel, I had the
perfect excuse for loitering. I was a
college student, and I loved it.
That's why I took it a little hard
when they handed me that diploma in
June of my senior year. I mean, here I
was, a student all my life — with occa
sional detours into the field of under
employment during summer vaca
tions — and now they were telling me
to find something else to do with my

sunny weekday
afternoons.

It was at that point I made the
biggest mistake of my life.
I got a job.
Not that having a job is bad. I have
found jobs an excellent way to spend
your time while both making money;
and, more importantly, not spending
money. I, however, made the mistake
of picking your traditional eight-to
five, spend-the-last-fou r-hours-pre
tending-to-work job, which suddenly
made it very hard for me to enjoy my
weekday afternoons.
I lost all the freedom I enjoyed as a
college student. I found myself mak
ing sentimental trips back to the cam
pus on weekends. 1 envied students
who wore shorts while I ruined pair
after pair of slacks sweating on the
drive to work. I began cutting off bicy
clists who brazenly challenged my
right of way on Campus Drive. In
short, I had turned into an alum, only
three months after graduation.
Then, a miracle happened: I was
laid off. 1 was the victim of my first

corporate downsizing. I spent
the following summer look
ing for similar work, only to
find the jobs which had been
few and far between when I
graduated had disappeared
completely a year later.
After a few months of
crossing out the network
marketing ads in the job
pages, I finally caught a
glimpse of what I was up
against when 1 applied for a
$6-an-hour job at the local
bookstore, only to find 40
resumes ahead of mine.

The next day, instead
of applying for more
vice-president-of-mar
keting openings, I low

ered my sights and
applied for a few
part-time jobs I
found on a local bul
letin board. Within
two days I had
received four phone
calls, two of which
were job offers, and

within a week I was working again at
jobs closer to my work and interest
level. Best of all, I had my afternoons
free.
What my pathetic little anecdote is
trying to show is that in the modern
workplace, the traditional full-time
job is quickly disappearing. Just take
a look at the companies that used to
line up at the CPPC like major league
baseball scouts in San Pedro de
Macoris to get a chance at the fresh
crop of Stanford phenoms. IBM,
Apple, Microsoft — companies that
were hiring even English majors a few
years ago — are jettisoning those jobs
quicker than you can rhyme "leaner"
with "meaner."
As a soon-to-be Stanford graduate,
you should be prepared for this situa
tion, and one of the ways to prepare is
to realize that there are other options
out there that will keep you afloat and
may even put you ahead of the compe
tition in the unending fight for work.
Working independently, freelancing,
consulting, schlepping, call it what
you will, but unless you can scrape
together enough money for a bus ride
to Denver, here are some tips for you
to follow:
The first and most difficult thing to
overcome when you are between or
among jobs is the stigma that comes
with not having a single full-time job.
Believe me, money is a distant second.
Any person who has taken five min
utes at a party to explain their major
will understand what I'm talking
about. It's the same outside of school,
except in the real world people will
judge you even more on the basis of
what you do rather than who you are.
There are a few ways to get around
this:
• Lie. This method is very effective.
Instead of saying that you wait tables
while waiting for your manuscript to
get published, just say that it already
has been published and a film version
is coming out. Advantages: really
impresses people. Disadvantages: oh
what a tangled web we weave . . ,
• Distort the truth. This way you
