# Tsongas calls for deficit reduction

### Cametra Thompson 
An uncontrolled budget deficit will lead to a "gen
erational war" between parents and children, former
Sen. Paul Tsongas (D-Mass.), told the more than 600
students, faculty and staff that packed Kresge Audi
torium last night.
Tsongas, a contender for the 1992 Democratic
presidential nomination, said that in the 1980s, under
former President Ronald Reagan, his generation "had
fun" and accumulated many debts, leaving the next
generation, current college-age adults, to face the con
sequences.
That could mean a very grim reality for the current
generation, Tsongas said. "Jobs you're hoping for
won't quite be there," he said.
According to Tsongas, future workers could pay as
much as 25 percent of their earnings to support Social
Security entitlements for the previous generation.
"As a generation you will learn to resent us and not
respect us," he said.
Using this appeal — which he called an appeal to
the bond between parent and child — as well as humor

and numerous anecdotes, Tsongas urged the highly
receptive audience to support his Zero-Deficit Plan,
which he claimed would completely eliminate the fed
eral budget deficit by the year 2000.
The plan, formulated by the Concord Coalition,
which Tsongas co-chairs with former Sen. Warren
Rudman (R-N.H.), calls for a reduction in budget ex
penditures for entitlements. The reductions would af
fect only American families whose income exceeds
$40,000
Other features of the plan include gasoline, alcohol
and tobacco taxes, as well as spending limits on na
tional security and domestic programs.
Despite his economic conservatism, Tsongas de
scribed himself as a liberal. "I'm a liberal. The defini
tion of liberalism is an expanded economic pie," he
said.
According to Tsongas, his focus on economic con
servatism while bidding for the 1992 Democratic
nomination for president caused important political
changes that will influence future elections.
Those changes mean that
Democrats can no longer run on
an anti-business platform as they
have in the past, and that Repub
licans can no longer run without
a budget-deficit reduction plan,
he said.
The other major factor in
bringing about these changes,
Tsongas said, was Ross Perot,
about whom Tsongas has mixed
feelings.
Tsongas thought Perot's mes
sage was right, but the messen
ger was wrong. "The thing that
troubled me was his tempera
ment — I wondered what he
would be like [heading] the FBI."


Former U.S. Senator Paul Tsongas speaks on a plan to eliminate the
deficit by the year 2000 last night at Kresge Auditorium.
