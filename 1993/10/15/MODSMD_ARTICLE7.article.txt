## Campbell: Hooked on politics After a failed U.S. Senate race, law professor guns for a seat in Sacramento 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
One short year after losing a U.S. Senate prima
ry and returning to Stanford as a full-time law pro
fessor, Tom Campbell is back in the political spot
light.
Although the former U.S. congressman was
considering a return to politics in 1994, he got an
unexpected chance to run for the state Senate
when incumbent Becky Morgan decided to resign
from her 11th District position earlier this year,
opening up a seat for the 1993 election.
For Campbell, whose sabbatical from the Law
School started in June, this race comes at the per
fect time. And he insists that doing politics on the
state level, rather than nationally, is an improve
ment rather than a step down.
"I am very interested in this office. If I make it,
there are only 40 senators, and I can probably get
20 people to agree with me on something. ... to
help the state of California," Campbell said
Wednesday in an interview with The Daily.
Last year at this time, Campbell, a moderate Re
publican, was ambiguous about his political ambi
tions, maintaining that he was happy just being a
professor. Although his opponents now contend
that Campbell will use this office purely as a means
to get back into national politics, Campbell himself
seems genuinely pleased with what the state Sen
ate position can offer.
Campbell also believes the low number of sena
tors will work to his advantage if he is re-elected in
1994 and again in 1996, when California's term
limits are scheduled to take effect.
Under the measure, many current senators,
who have been in office for more than two terms,
will be forced to step down. Their departure would
leave Campbell as one of the most senior members
of the senate after only three years in office.
In addition, Campbell said he prefers the state
government because it will allow him to devote his
attention to the issues he believes are most impor
tant in his state.
"The issues I care about deal with California's

economic performance — getting people back to
work. Most of the reasons we don't have higher
employment are due to the state, not the federal
government," he explained.
The state Senate office will also allow Campbell
to continue teaching, a luxury that would not be
possible with any other political office. Because the
legislature ends in September and reconvenes in
January, Campbell will be able to teach his public
policy class at the Law School for the entire fall se
mester.
