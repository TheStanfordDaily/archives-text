## Campbell: Hooked on politics After a failed U.S. Senate race, law professor guns for a seat in Sacramento 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
One short year after losing a U.S. Senate prima
ry and returning to Stanford as a full-time law pro
fessor, Tom Campbell is back in the political spot
light.
Although the former U.S. congressman was
considering a return to politics in 1994, he got an
unexpected chance to run for the state Senate
when incumbent Becky Morgan decided to resign
from her 11th District position earlier this year,
opening up a seat for the 1993 election.
For Campbell, whose sabbatical from the Law
School started in June, this race comes at the per
fect time. And he insists that doing politics on the
state level, rather than nationally, is an improve
ment rather than a step down.
"I am very interested in this office. If I make it,
there are only 40 senators, and I can probably get
20 people to agree with me on something. ... to
help the state of California," Campbell said
Wednesday in an interview with The Daily.
Last year at this time, Campbell, a moderate Re
publican, was ambiguous about his political ambi
tions, maintaining that he was happy just being a
professor. Although his opponents now contend
that Campbell will use this office purely as a means
to get back into national politics, Campbell himself
seems genuinely pleased with what the state Sen
ate position can offer.
Campbell also believes the low number of sena
tors will work to his advantage if he is re-elected in
1994 and again in 1996, when California's term
limits are scheduled to take effect.
Under the measure, many current senators,
who have been in office for more than two terms,
will be forced to step down. Their departure would
leave Campbell as one of the most senior members
of the senate after only three years in office.
In addition, Campbell said he prefers the state
government because it will allow him to devote his
attention to the issues he believes are most impor
tant in his state.
"The issues I care about deal with California's

economic performance — getting people back to
work. Most of the reasons we don't have higher
employment are due to the state, not the federal
government," he explained.
The state Senate office will also allow Campbell
to continue teaching, a luxury that would not be
possible with any other political office. Because the
legislature ends in September and reconvenes in
January, Campbell will be able to teach his public
policy class at the Law School for the entire fall se
mester.


ErtK Jensen — Daily
Law Prof, and former U.S. Rep. Tom Campbell
has returned to politics after a year-long break.
In fact, Campbell says he is so
pleased with what this position
has to offer that he insists he has
no defined plans to run for any
higher office.
"If I can get re-elected in '96,
that's as far as I'm thinking,"
Campbell said.
But a future run for higher
office is not out of the question.
"In the year 2000, I'll have to step
down when term limits hit me,
and at that time, I might consider
another office if the voters aren't
too tired of me," he said.
The first step, however, is to
win the election this November.
Campbell is widely considered to
be the favorite, with a great deal
more legislative experience than
any of his seven opponents —
three Democrats, two Republi
cans, a Libertarian and an Inde
pendent.
Campbell bases his campaign
platform on what he sees as the
most important issue in Califor
nia today: the economy.
"I care a lot about the environ

ment — we should not ignore it
while we create jobs — but the
No. 1 is the economy. We have not
come out of the recession, but we
must take matters into our own
hands because the federal govern
ment is not going to put any more
money into California," Campbell
said.
A stable economy, Campbell
feels, will also help solve several
of the social problems facing the
state.
"A stable family-job situation
is key," Campbell said. "If par
ents have stable jobs, they can
and do devote time to their chil
dren's education and schools.
They present a much better
model, particularly for lower
income strata, than joining a
gang."
In the past, Campbell, who is
pro-choice and has just received
an endorsement from the Sierra
Club, has been considered one of
the most moderate members of
the California Republican Party.
His concentration on the econo
my is indicative of another one of
his key concerns: that his party
has strayed too far to the right on
social issues, away from the real
problems it should be addressing.

"I want the focus of party poli
tics back on the economy, nation
al defense, law and order, a strong
foreign policy, and away from
condemning homosexuals and
women who have abortions. Mat
ters of individual conscience
should be left to individual con
science and should not be the
tests for Republican loyalty,"
Campbell said.
To further these goals, Camp
bell last year helped form the
Republican Majority Coalition, a
national group of moderates con
cerned with combating the pres
sure of the religious right on the
Republican Party.
According to Campbell, the
coalition hopes to be active by the
1996 presidential primary elec
tion.
Though much of Campbell's
activity with the coalition is on
hold during this campaign, he
believes that a victory in this race
can only help his cause.
"A moderate Republican in
office is a help to the cause of
moderate congressmen every
where," Campbell said. "There
are a fair number of people in
office who believe as I do, but are
timid. The success of an individu

al who does not cave in to pres
sure can bolster courage in oth
ers."
In the 1992 U.S. Senate prima
ry, Campbell lost narrowly to con
servative TV commentator Bruce
Herschensohn after singer and
former Palm Springs Mayor
Sonny Bono entered the race and
split away many of Campbell's
more moderate supporters. Her
schensohn was later defeated by
Democrat Barbara Boxer.
With a new election ahead,
Campbell is putting last year's
defeat behind him. But he is
quick to add that he has not for
gotten the lessons he has learned
over the past year.
"Losing is a very powerful test
of one's own character, much
more than winning. It focuses the
mind on what's essential and on
what your calling really is,"
Campbell said.
And though he is making no
predictions for this election,
Campbell seems to feel his
chances of victory are good.
"I'm very hopeful, but not
overly confident. I'm not saying
anymore than that I'm working
veiy hard to win, and believe that
I will," he said.
