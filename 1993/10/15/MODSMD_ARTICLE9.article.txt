## A 						brief history of the undergraduate education commission 
### Romesh Ratnesar Skip Schwartz Senior staff writers 
Six months after its creation, the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education will meet
for the first time tomorrow.
The 19-member panel will spend its first
day together at the Meyer Buck Estate near
Alpine Road, using the time to get acquainted
with each other and to start establishing a pre
liminary agenda for discussion.
Most of the commission met informally last
Sunday with the Board of Trustees, but its
two student members had not yet been
appointed.
President Gerhard Casper unveiled his
plans for the commission in his first "State of
the University" address April 29, charging
the group to conduct a comprehensive year

long study of Stanford's undergraduate pro
gram.
In June, Casper named History Prof.
James Sheehan to head the commission and
begin initial planning for the study. Delays in
staffing the commission, in particular the
student members, pushed back Casper's orig
inal hope to convene the group over the sum
mer.
Although there is no specific timetable for
the commission's progress, Sheehan spelled
out a general schedule which the panel will try
to follow. He said he hopes to have "a well
defined agenda" and work groups to examine
particular issues established by the end of this
quarter.
Those work groups will be expected to com
plete their studies and report their findings to
the full commission by the end of the winter

quarter. Sheehan believes the commission
should be able to compile a final draft of its
report by the end of spring quarter, and fine
tune it over the summer.
The final report will then be turned over to
the president, and its recommendations
assessed by the appropriate departments and
decision-making bodies.
Sheehan said the commission will hold
weekly, two-hour meetings. In addition, he
said, the group will actively seek input from all
facets from the Stanford community, and will
make various appearances in dormitories and
classrooms.
The commission is comprised of six faculty
members from the School of Humanities and
Sciences, one faculty member from each of the
other schools, two alumni, two students, and
one staff member.
