# 'It was a phenomenal sense of empowerment.'
## A 						first for Mem Chu Gay couple exchange vows of commitment 
### Angie Chuang Senior staff writer 
Business School graduate Terry Rouman re
members his most exciting coming-out experi
ence as the car ride from his commitment cere
mony at Memorial Church.
He and his new spouse, Jason Allen, were dri
ven down University Avenue in a convertible as
family and friends followed, honking their horns.
"We were kissing and people in the street just
stood with their mouths hanging open. Some
body yelled, 'That's disgusting!' " he says, smil
ing.
For Rouman and Allen, the drive down Uni
versity on Sept. 6 was the culmination of the in
numerable challenges they overcame — having
to come out to everyone from the church admin
istrators to the bakery staff— as they became the
first gay couple to exchange vows of commitment
in Memorial Church.
"It was a phenomenal sense of empower
ment," Allen says."I thought, 'My God, if I can
do this, I can do anything.' *
While Allen says the fact that they set a mile
stone for Stanford made the occasion "that much
more meaningful." Rouman adds, "It wouldn't
have lessened the experience if we weren't the
first."
Road to approval
Since Rouman and Allen proposed mutually
on Christmas Day, a church ceremony seemed
natural. "When I proposed to Jason and he
turned around and proposed to me, we had es
tablished the foundation that we wanted a spiri
tual environment for the marriage," Rouman
says.
Rouman recalls that he proposed to Allen by
giving him a "huge box with little boxes inside
each other — each one had a puzzle piece that

spelled out the words, 'Will you
marry me?' and the last one had a
ring."
Having just returned from their
honeymoon in Indonesia, Rouman
and Allen sit in their posh, contem
porary San Francisco apartment
and reminisce fondly about plan
ning their commitment ceremony,
unaware that they are completing
each other's sentences.
Allen starts, "We had looked
into lots of places, but once we got
the idea (of Memorial Church) into
our heads, we had our hearts set on
it."
It was especially important that
the ceremony take place in a
church so that their "non-gay
friends would see it as equal to
their weddings," Rouman explains.
"Also, we were raised in churches
and would personally relate to it
more on a subconscious level."
Rouman was raised as a Greek

Orthodox, and Allen a Roman
Catholic. Because both faiths con
sider homosexuality a sin, howev
er, they both worship at a San
Francisco Methodist church, which
is "inclusive" of gay people, but
does not recognize the couple's
union, Allen says.
After approaching the Memorial
Church staifT and having some ini
tial discussions, the couple asked to
meet with Assoc. Dean Diana
Akiyama and Dean Robert Gregg.
"We stayed for an hour and a
half, and ended up spilling our guts
about our families, our experiences
— it was really heart-to-heart,"
Rouman says.
At the end of the discussion,
Akiyama and Gregg approved their
proposal and the plans went into
full swing.
The church's decision
The staff at Memorial Church
had anticipated requests like
Rouman and Allen's, Gregg says.
"We had talked about what we
thought would be the right kind of
response in terms of justice, com

passion and our service to the com
munity."
"We agreed that [Rouman and
Allen's] relationship warranted
that kind of support," he says,
explaining that the decision to con
duct a certain religious service is
made solely by the church. While
the University administration and
Board of Trustees were notified,
they were not participants in the
discussion.
"We insisted that the public
relations and political ramifica
tions be pushed aside" in making
the decision, Gregg says. "We
wanted to focus on what we were
about religiously."
Akiyama says her personal deci
sion to conduct the commitment
ceremony — Memorial Church
does not use the legal term "wed
ding" — was based on her acknowl
edgment that doing so would be
"politically risky, but theologically
compelling."
"Ultimately, it was because I
think it was very important to take
human beings seriously when they
want to make a commitment of

fidelity and monogamous love to
each other," she says.
Responding to the question of
whether there will be future gay
commitment ceremonies in Memo
rial Church, Akiyama says, "We
had a first, there will be a second."
Paving the way
Planning the service became a
way of pioneering the concept of
gay commitment ceremonies for
future couples, Allen says. When
the couple registered at stores, they
began to realize that, though the
pre-ceremony details would pre
sent awkward moments, they
could also raise awareness.
"Because 'Terry' can be a
woman's or a man's name, all these
people were assuming" he was a
woman, Allen says. When they reg
istered, clerks would make com
ments like, "Well, it's good the
groom is doing this for a change" or
"I can't believe she's making you
do this."
Rouman and Allen insisted they
were registered at stores as either
"registrar and co-registrar" or

"groom and groom," rather than
"bride and groom."
Their persistence not only
caused corporations to alter their
computer systems, but also
prompted some stores to institute
employee training on non-hetero
sexist ways to approach customers.
The ceremony
The fact that the commitment
ceremony could not be a legal wed
ding by state law enhanced the
experience in some ways, Rouman
says. The couple and the church
staff felt they had more room in
designing the ceremony to focus on
the "blessing of the relationship"
rather than meeting legal require
ments.
Instead of a marriage license,
Rouman and Allen signed a mutu
al covenant. Akiyama also helped
them design a ceremony that
would include family and friends in
a collective affirmation of their
vows.
"The wedding was amazing. It
was magic," Rouman says excited
ly. His snapshots and souvenirs

reflect a very traditional ceremony,
punctuated by certain unique
touches — Britten's operatic trib
ute to his male lover and a cake
with two male figurines amid pink
triangles.
While response from family and
friends was generally supportive,
Allen says several people "were
sort of taken aback, shocked."
Nevertheless, both men's imme
diate families were "wonderfully
supportive." Even Rouman's
father, who didn't attend because
he "just wasn't ready for it" called
the morning before the ceremony.
"He wanted to tell me he loved me,
loved Jason (Allen) and wanted to
give us his blessing," Rouman sayb.
Rouman and Allen agree per
haps the most significant reactions
they received were from other gay
couples who now feel empowered
to participate in similar cere
monies.
"Gay friends came up to me dur
ing the reception and said we
changed their lives," Rouman says.
"They didn't think they could do
this. It was so moving."

friends would see it as equal to
their weddings," Rouman explains.
"Also, we were raised in churches
and would personally relate to it
more on a subconscious level."
Rouman was raised as a Greek

Orthodox, and Allen a Roman
Catholic. Because both faiths con
sider homosexuality a sin, howev
er, they both worship at a San
Francisco Methodist church, which
is "inclusive" of gay people, but
does not recognize the couple's
union, Allen says.
After approaching the Memorial
Church staifT and having some ini
tial discussions, the couple asked to
meet with Assoc. Dean Diana
Akiyama and Dean Robert Gregg.
"We stayed for an hour and a
half, and ended up spilling our guts
about our families, our experiences
— it was really heart-to-heart,"
Rouman says.
At the end of the discussion,
Akiyama and Gregg approved their
proposal and the plans went into
full swing.
The church's decision
The staff at Memorial Church
had anticipated requests like
Rouman and Allen's, Gregg says.
"We had talked about what we
thought would be the right kind of
response in terms of justice, com

passion and our service to the com
munity."
"We agreed that [Rouman and
Allen's] relationship warranted
that kind of support," he says,
explaining that the decision to con
duct a certain religious service is
made solely by the church. While
the University administration and
Board of Trustees were notified,
they were not participants in the
discussion.
"We insisted that the public
relations and political ramifica
tions be pushed aside" in making
the decision, Gregg says. "We
wanted to focus on what we were
about religiously."
Akiyama says her personal deci
sion to conduct the commitment
ceremony — Memorial Church
does not use the legal term "wed
ding" — was based on her acknowl
edgment that doing so would be
"politically risky, but theologically
compelling."
"Ultimately, it was because I
think it was very important to take
human beings seriously when they
want to make a commitment of

fidelity and monogamous love to
each other," she says.
Responding to the question of
whether there will be future gay
commitment ceremonies in Memo
rial Church, Akiyama says, "We
had a first, there will be a second."
Paving the way
Planning the service became a
way of pioneering the concept of
gay commitment ceremonies for
future couples, Allen says. When
the couple registered at stores, they
began to realize that, though the
pre-ceremony details would pre
sent awkward moments, they
could also raise awareness.
"Because 'Terry' can be a
woman's or a man's name, all these
people were assuming" he was a
woman, Allen says. When they reg
istered, clerks would make com
ments like, "Well, it's good the
groom is doing this for a change" or
"I can't believe she's making you
do this."
Rouman and Allen insisted they
were registered at stores as either
"registrar and co-registrar" or

"groom and groom," rather than
"bride and groom."
Their persistence not only
caused corporations to alter their
computer systems, but also
prompted some stores to institute
employee training on non-hetero
sexist ways to approach customers.
The ceremony
The fact that the commitment
ceremony could not be a legal wed
ding by state law enhanced the
experience in some ways, Rouman
says. The couple and the church
staff felt they had more room in
designing the ceremony to focus on
the "blessing of the relationship"
rather than meeting legal require
ments.
Instead of a marriage license,
Rouman and Allen signed a mutu
al covenant. Akiyama also helped
them design a ceremony that
would include family and friends in
a collective affirmation of their
vows.
"The wedding was amazing. It
was magic," Rouman says excited
ly. His snapshots and souvenirs

reflect a very traditional ceremony,
punctuated by certain unique
touches — Britten's operatic trib
ute to his male lover and a cake
with two male figurines amid pink
triangles.
While response from family and
friends was generally supportive,
Allen says several people "were
sort of taken aback, shocked."
Nevertheless, both men's imme
diate families were "wonderfully
supportive." Even Rouman's
father, who didn't attend because
he "just wasn't ready for it" called
the morning before the ceremony.
"He wanted to tell me he loved me,
loved Jason (Allen) and wanted to
give us his blessing," Rouman sayb.
Rouman and Allen agree per
haps the most significant reactions
they received were from other gay
couples who now feel empowered
to participate in similar cere
monies.
"Gay friends came up to me dur
ing the reception and said we
changed their lives," Rouman says.
"They didn't think they could do
this. It was so moving."
Business School graduate Terry Rouman re
members his most exciting coming-out experi
ence as the car ride from his commitment cere
mony at Memorial Church.
He and his new spouse, Jason Allen, were dri
ven down University Avenue in a convertible as
family and friends followed, honking their horns.
"We were kissing and people in the street just
stood with their mouths hanging open. Some
body yelled, 'That's disgusting!' " he says, smil
ing.
For Rouman and Allen, the drive down Uni
versity on Sept. 6 was the culmination of the in
numerable challenges they overcame — having
to come out to everyone from the church admin
istrators to the bakery staff— as they became the
first gay couple to exchange vows of commitment
in Memorial Church.
"It was a phenomenal sense of empower
ment," Allen says."I thought, 'My God, if I can
do this, I can do anything.' *
While Allen says the fact that they set a mile
stone for Stanford made the occasion "that much
more meaningful." Rouman adds, "It wouldn't
have lessened the experience if we weren't the
first."
Road to approval
Since Rouman and Allen proposed mutually
on Christmas Day, a church ceremony seemed
natural. "When I proposed to Jason and he
turned around and proposed to me, we had es
tablished the foundation that we wanted a spiri
tual environment for the marriage," Rouman
says.
Rouman recalls that he proposed to Allen by
giving him a "huge box with little boxes inside
each other — each one had a puzzle piece that
