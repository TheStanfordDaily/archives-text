# Clinton sends warships to enforce embargo

### 
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - A U.S. war
ship rode the horizon off the capital yesterday — to
some Haitians an omen that a foreign invasion was
imminent, to others a harbinger that democracy
might soon be restored.
The ship was one of six dispatched by President
Clinton to enforce a U.N. arms and oil embargo that
is to take effect at midnight tonight unless Haiti's
military leaders cooperate with a U.N.-brokered
accord on bringing back ousted President Jean-
Bertrand Aristide.
The ship was the first one spotted by the capital's
fearful residents, although a Pentagon spokesman
in Washington, Maj. Steve Little, said all six were in
place yesterday.
Army commander Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, whose
resignation is part of the U.N. accord, meanwhile
called yesterday for a national conference of all
Haitian sectors to decide the country's future.
He told CNN that the meeting could ask for a

papal representative to replace the U.N. team mon
itoring compliance with the agreement. He also reit
erated his conditions for stepping down, including a
military amnesty, and said foreigners were not in
danger in Haiti.
Aristide, the country's first freely elected leader,
was to return Oct. 30 under an accord he and
Cedras signed in July. A pro-Aristide prime minis
ter had taken office to ease the transition, which
was to be aided by a 1,600-man U.N. military mis
sion.
But Cedras refused last week to step down due to
a dispute over an amnesty for human-rights viola
tions. A U.S. warship carrying troops for the U.N.
mission turned back in the face of unruly port work
ers and protesters. The country's justice minister
was assassinated in broad daylight.
Haitian aid officials and social workers predict
ed yesterday that the U.N. embargo scheduled to
take effect tonight would cause little pain to its

intended target and hurt only the poor masses,
many of whom nevertheless support the harsh
pressure to return elected President Jean-
Bertrand Aristide.
As the tensions grew, U.S. Senate Minority Lead
er Bob Dole said yesterday he will offer legislation
restricting Clinton's authority to send troops to
Haiti.
"I wouldn't risk any American lives to put Aris
tide back in power and try to force democracy on
Haiti," he said.
Nearly all U.N. personnel have been evacuated
from the country and the U.S Embassy is warning
Americans in Haiti to be careful.
Cedras, however, told CNN that there was no
threat to any Americans, or to any U.N. personnel.
Stanley Schrager, the U.S. Embassy spokesman
in Haiti, said U.S. policy-makers believe Cedras is
unlikely to meet the United Nations' terms for
avoiding the sanctions.
