### 
THERE IS a specter haunting
Stanford. The specter of a
graduate student ASSU fee
revolt. However, the philosophy
underlying the graduate school fee
revolt is fundamentally flawed,
and, if successful, the fee revolt
could set a dangerous precedent for
the future of ASSU programs that
benefit all students.
Some graduate students argue
that they do not use the programs
their student fees help fund. This
argument, they contend, justifies
the en masse withholding of ASSU
fees; however, in actuality it
demonstrates an unhealthy atti
tude toward the Stanford commu
nity. The philosophy of the fee
revolt is inherently destructive,
limited in its vision, and ultimately
cannot be reconciled with the reali
ties of Stanford student services.
This self-interested attitude will
unfortunately contribute to a
balkanization of student interests
which, in turn, will undermine the
college community.
The rhetoric of the boycotters
belies their belief in an artificial
distinction between graduate and
undergraduate students with
regard to material benefits received
from the ASSU. This distinction is
inherently false because there is no
black-and-white dichotomy bet
ween "pro-grad" and "pro-under
grad" policies. It is difficult to
grasp how generalized programs
such as the Rape Education Pro
ject, the Speakers' Bureau and
KZSU provide positive benefits to
only undergraduates.
The revolt is motivated by a fal
lacious belief the distribution of
ASSU resources resembles a zero
sum game. If the members of the
grad school revolt are going to boy
cott general fee requests, then they
should not be permitted to enjoy

the proverbial free lunch. How
would this acceptance of conse
quences be accomplished? ID
checks at speaking events? Jam
ming KZSU's signal to all graduate
residents? The inherent absurdity
of secession from common pro
grams demonstrates the need to
resist attempts to focus upon the
specific beneficiaries of programs.
Just as a community should consti
tute more than the sum of its parts,
the services provided by the ASSU
should not be judged on the basis of
which section of the student popu
lation receives a greater slice of the
pie.
The graduate student fee revolt
demonstrates a group attempting
to take common benefits for grant
ed and focusing energy upon local
ized programs. However, it would
be unfair for graduate students to
expect undergraduates to have to
bear the brunt of all common pro
grams. Furthermore, there is no
reason why a separate status as
graduate students justifies their
secession from the funding of those
programs which they consider to be
the domain of undergraduates.
The victory two years ago of the
"I'd Prefer Not to Have a COP"
option proves that a widespread
belief in the inefficacy of ASSU
programs is not a phenomenon
exclusive to graduate students. If
this revolt were to succeed, what
would stop emboldened undergrad
uates from attempting to secede
from programs which they felt did
not serve the interests of their nar
row clique? The end result of this
rampant sectionalism would be the
extinction of ASSU service fees,
and the collapse of the community
that currently arises from them.
Student organizations provide a
sense of community that tran
scends class divisions, both socioe
conomic and educational. The
graduate student revolt threatens
this community by holding groups
hostage to interest group politics.
While the revolt may claim to be
in the interest of fairness, every
body is cheated when a school loses
its sense of identity.
