## Rear ends, reality and Rene 
### 
JUST A FEW days ago, I think, I was
sitting at my desk on my newly-pur
chased seat cushion, a wonderful
product designed with my sensitive areas
in mind, and I began to wonder about my
butt.
Nothing too anatomical, mind you,
just wondering . . .
Well, more specifically, about the chair
upon which my butt, and subsequently
the remainder of my mass, rested. I
began to wonder if I was actually sitting
on a chair in my room, if there really was
a chair in my room, if there really was a
chair . . .
Let me give a little background history
to those frosh who haven't had the plea
sure of the spewings of Rene Descartes in
Cultures, Ideas and Values yet.
Once upon a time, in a land far, far
away, there once a little boy (by the rela
tive and contemporary definition of
"boy") who was named Rene Descartes
(purely a societal tag to facilitate inter
personal interaction; it implies nothing of
the "true nature" of the "boy"). "Rene"
"was" (assumes the passage of time; left
in for simplicity) "sitting" (implies physi
cal incarnation of "Rene," whom we have
not shown to exist) on a "chair" ....
Anyway, Rene Descartes denied every
thing except the unbelievably famous "I
think, therefore I am."
So I was sitting on my butt, feeling
much like Descartes, denying everything,
left and right, mowing down objects at

will, feeling the true force of my all-con
suming power.
"Hey, Course Reader, eat this!"
"University bill, take a hike."
"What stop sign, Officer?"
Oh, and you have never, never in your
wildest dreams, really ticked off your
roommate until you've denied his exis
tence.
So instead of falling to the ground due
to the sudden disappearance of a certain
piece of furniture, I started to think more
abstractly about existence instead of try
ing to obliterate the universe. In the old
days of messed-up scientific theories,
people naively believed that objects actu
ally existed in the real world, and when
we saw or felt them, we were interacting
with the object. But in the true spirit of
science and the advance of human knowl
edge, that theory has been replaced.
Now here's the leading theory: noth
ing really exists out there; those things
are just perceptions that we have of noth
ingness, "projections." You're not actual
ly sitting in a chair; you think you are.
You're not actually reading a paper; you
think you are. That's not actually real
food you're eating; it's . . . well, that's
another story.
And better yet, if you think that Stan
ford cap of yours is red (or cardinal), then
when you stop looking at it, it's not red
anymore. Only when you are looking at it
is it red. After a lot of looking away and at
my cap, really fast, I figured out that it

turns a slight derivative of teal when
you're not looking at it. (Only try this
experiment if you're a trained profession
al.) Apparently, the Wilbur construction
crews have been busy painting and
repainting everything for the sake of
existentialist theories. Maybe if we all
stopped looking at things, Wilbur might
actually get done.
But I don't subscribe to either of these
views. If you think about our senses and
our perceptions, there is no way to view
the "realities" of the world without leav
ing our senses. Everything we know and
think is derived from our senses, directly
or indirectly. There's no way to tell if I'm
really sitting on a chair or if I just think I
am.
Who cares if my butt is resting on a
lovely, soft, fluffy cushion, or if I just
think my butt is the happiest it's ever
been? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter
because there's no way to tell and no way
to affect it.
Sometimes, I really think that philoso
phers would better serve the community
by making seat cushions.
