## ASSU funds do not benefit only undergraduate pursuits 
### 
ALONG WITH thousands of other
graduate students this week, I
received an urgent "call to arms"
from a group calling itself "The Gradu
ate Student Tea Party." After my experi
ence tonight, I would suggest Gratuitous
Soggy Teabag might be a more accurate
appellation.
While I too lament the lack of gradu
ate student presence in much of Stan
ford's community life, I find the
Teabag's deceptive tactics and selfish
ness appalling.
The 4,576 personally addressed e-

mail messages urge graduate students to
demand full refunds of our $37.22 per
quarter in ASSU fees. With an
unabashed call to activism, avarice and
aggression, the Teabags invite disenfran
chised grad students to "Make a state
ment! Save $120! Slam the ASSU!"
This evening, after departing slightly
from the letter's easy-to-follow instruc
tions, I was astonished to discover that
the Teabags' claims are far from accurate.
Their pronouncement that "the vast
majority of ASSU funds go to decidedly
undergraduate pursuits" is nonsense.

Unless, that is, you consider charity and
volunteer organizations; environmental
activism; cultural events; public speakers;
The Daily; KZSU radio; Asian, Black, Chi
cano, American Indian and women stu
dent organizations; the Symphony; and
sexual assault prevention organizations
"primarily undergraduate pursuits."
If you do, I suggest you try to get out
a bit more — maybe let some air into
that stuffy cubbyhole of yours. Many
graduate students are in fact part of and
served by these organizations. Just
because you're not doesn't mean they

don't deserve to exist. The "me" decade
was over 20 years ago.
Sure it's crummy that Stanford stu
dents voted to cut funding to the Gradu
ate Student Association — we undoubt
edly needed it. But as the Teabags them
selves note in their letter, grad students
comprise 50 percent of the student body.
How many of them bothered to vote?
So you want to organize, great. Build
solidarity, wonderful. But don't sabotage
the little sense of community we do have.
