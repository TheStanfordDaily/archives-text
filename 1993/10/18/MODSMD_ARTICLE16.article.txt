# Past ties to ASSU will not hurt Luz Herrera's service on commission
## 
### 
I am writing to provide a rebuttal to
the argument presented by ASSU under
graduate senator Anthony Westerfield
which stated that previous ASSU
involvement will impair Luz Herrera's
ability to serve effectively on the newly
formed Commission on Undergraduate

Education.
Herrera's previous ASSU involve
ment does not render her any less quali
fied to serve effectively on the commis
sion. If anything, the involvement
should help her serve more effectively on
the commission. The people that Her
rera has worked with, the decisions that
she has made and the projects on which
she has served enable her to be in a posi
tion where many resources, be they
ASSU-related or not, are at her finger
tips if she chooses to tap into them to
benefit the student body.

Westerfield claims that the student
representative should "have no ties to
any organizations and should be impar
tial." To expect either of these traits for
any multi-faceted Stanford student is
unreasonable. I'm certain each one of
the candidates has his/her own connec
tions and partialities â€” unless of course
the student has existed in a vacuum and
is perfectly impervious to every form of
Stanford stimuli.
Westerfield claims that he has a prob
lem if Herrera does not resign from the
board. Why should she? Because she is

accused of being an "insider"? Is an
"insider" argument even relevant in this
situation? No. Committee chair Mork
Murdock explicitly stated the selection
committee "doesn't give anyone more
consideration because of ASSU connec
tions."
Instead of lamenting about his pcob
lems, senator Westerfield would be wise
to focus his time and energy on working
with Herrera to help ensure an effective
student input process.
