# No. 11 Arizona squeaks by Stanford, 27-24
## Cardinal shines in heartbreaker 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
TUCSON, Ariz. — Matching
point for point and injury for
injury, the Stanford and Arizona
football teams swaggered like two
prizefighters for close to four
hours on the rain-soaked Arizona
Stadium turf Saturday night.
But it was Arizona (6-0, 3-0 in
the Pacific 10 Conference) that
landed the final punch. Steve
McLaughlin kicked a 27-yard field
goal as time expired to give the
Wildcats a 27-24 decision in front
of a sellout crowd of 57,799.
The kick was set up by the Ari
zona defense. With Stanford (2-4,
0-3) facing third down and nine
deep in its own territory, defen
sive end Akil Jackson rammed
Cardinal quarterback Steve Sten
strom, knocking the ball loose as
Stenstrom was preparing to
throw. Wildcat safety Spencer
Wray recovered the fumble at the
Stanford eight-yard line with 40
seconds left.
"I rolled out to the left, they
came with a blitz off the corner,
and I tried to get up underneath
it," said Stenstrom. "I was getting
ready to hit (receiver) David
Shaw, but as soon as my hand
came off the ball I got hit from the
inside."
Stanford coach Bill Walsh said
that Stenstrom ran the wrong
play.
"It was supposed to be a run
ning play. Steve was going to go to
the outside and run for what he
could and then we were going to
go for the tie," Walsh said. "It was
not a pass play. He didn't expect
the pressure that fast and didn't
protect the ball."
Stenstrom received plenty of
protection in the first half, march
ing the Cardinal to an early lead.
Among the highlights was a 91-
yard pass play to freshman receiv
er Brian Manning — the longest
scoring play ever against Arizona

— to give Stanford a 10-0 advan
tage. Two drives later, Stenstrom
found Justin Armour on the left
sideline for a 16-yard touchdown
pass, increasing the Cardinal's
margin to 17-0.
By halftime, Stanford had 244
yards of total offense against the
top-rated defense in the country,
which was yielding an average of
158 yards per game The Cardi
nal finished with 342 total yards.
For the fifth-straight game,
Stenstrom passed for over 300
yards, completing 30 of 47
attempts for 339 yards and two
touchdowns.
Meanwhile, the Stanford
defense played its best game of
the season. For the first time this
year, the Cardinal defenders held
an opponent scoreless in the first
quarter. Also for the first time,
Stanford's defense forced four
consecutive punts — accomplish
ing that feat twice. Jason White,
Jason Fisk and Toby Norwood
each recorded nine tackles, and as
a unit the defense held the Wild
cats to only 240 yards of total
offense for the game.
"It was just a maturing pro
cess," said left end Tyrone Park
er. "I knew sooner or later that as
a unit we could come together,
and today we did."
After the Armour touchdown,
Arizona head coach Dick Tomey
called the entire Wildcat squad
together for a team meeting on
the sidelines.
Following the conference, Ari
zona running back Chuck Levy
carried the No. 11 Wildcats right
back into the ballgame. Levy
returned Aaron Mills' kickoff 83
yards to set up Arizona's first
touchdown drive, and following a
Stenstrom fumble that was recov
ered by the Wildcats' Brant
Boyer, Levy rambled 27 yards on
the next play to bring the Wild
cats within three.
"I didn't want to wait until the
half for the meeting," Tomey said.

"We were losing poise, becoming
uncharacteristic, so I just tried to
assure them that if we stayed
together, we could get a chance to
win it."
From that point on, Arizona's
defense demonstrated why it is
the nation's best. Turnovers ulti
mately caused Stanford's down
fall in an otherwise outstanding

effort. The Cardinal fumbled the
ball six times (losing three), and
Stenstrom threw four intercep
tions. Three of those giveaways
resulted in 17 Arizona points.
"I give Arizona a lot of credit —
they beat us, but in a lot of ways
we beat ourselves too," Stenstrom
said. "A lot of it is the product of
the pressure defense that they

play. They count on offenses mak
ing mistakes."
Five of the Stanford fumbles
were committed by Stenstrom,
who was effected by the combina
tion of a slippery ball and adjust
ing to new center T.J. Gaynor,
who replaced Glen Cavanaugh

Justin Armour scores on a 16-yard pass to give the Cardinal a 17-0 lead. Unfortunately, the Arizona
Wildcats would bridge this deficit on their way to a 27-24 victory.
(out for the season with a injured
disk in his neck).
"We had a few problems,"
Gaynor said. "The two of us are not
used to each other, and I had a
great player over me (Arizona All-
America noseguard Rob Waldrop)."
The Wildcats tied the game on
a 50-yard McLaughlin field goal at
the beginning of the third quarter,
and took the lead near the end of
the period on a two-yard touch
down run by Billy Johnson.

Stanford brought the count to
24-24 at the 12:43 mark in the
fourth quarter as Ellery Roberts
capped a nine-play, 74-yard drive
with a seven-yard endzone run —
the longest scoring run against
the Wildcats this season.
But the drive did not come
without its price. On the play
prior to Roberts' run, Stenstrom
threw a 35-yard pass to Armour,
who was leveled by free safety
Tony Bouie just before reaching
the endzone. Armour left the
game with a separated right
shoulder and will be out for at
least two weeks.
Both defenses controlled the

remainder of the fourth quarter,
with each forcing two punts.
McLaughlin employed a rugby
style punt that placed Stanford on
its own 15-yard line with 1:08
left. Soon after, Stanford commit
ted the last of its seven turnovers,
a mistake which marred a virtual
ly even contest.
"I knew it was going to be a
tough game," Walsh said. "We
just kept trying to get as many as
we could early. We knew they'd be
tough, and then we had a series of
mistakes that allowed Arizona
back in the game."
The last one enabled them to
win it.
