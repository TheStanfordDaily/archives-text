It might have taken the Stanford women's volley
ball team a while to get moving, but, when push came
to shove, the squad kicked into fifth gear this week
end.
Despite sluggish starts in both games, the No. 3
Cardinal (14-3, 7-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
chalked up two more wins this weekend, defeating
No. 23 Oregon State (12-6, 5-4) on Friday night, then
sweeping Oregon (4-13, 1-8) the following night in
Maples Pavilion.
"It's nice to win, to get the weekend over with,"
said coach Don Shaw.
While a victory is a victory, Stanford had to earn
each hard-fought point. The battle was particularly
fierce against an Oregon team that managed to secure
the first game. The Cardinal finally settled into its
groove, however, and outlasted the Beavers 11-15,17-
15, 16-14, 15-4.
A tough serving effort by Oregon at the outset of
the match, coupled with a string of Cardinal hitting
errors, propelled the Beavers to an early lead in game
one. Stanford managed to even the score at 9-9, but
finally succumbed to the Beaver attack.
Stanford showed signs of revival midway through
the second game after getting off to another slow
beginning. Senior outside hitter Heidi Eick spear
headed the Cardinal effort, together with sophomores
Cary Wendell and Wendy Hromadka, to raise the
team's hitting percentage to .200 from its .098 mark
in game one.
"It was a real battle, a very competitive match,"
Shaw said. "We were on the ropes a few times but
looking at a 2-0 (match) deficit, we managed to pull it
out."
After a tight third game, Stanford started to heat
up in game four as Oregon ran out of steam. Sopho
more Marnie Triefenbach's left-side smash and three
blocks by freshman Eileen Murfee provided the impe
tus for Stanford's relatively quick fourth-game victo
ry.
"We got the hang of things after awhile,"Shaw
said. "We learned to wait on our block and it also
shows in our hitting percentages. I really liked our
effort — we need to play with the same high intensi
ty, but with more control."
In her usual fashion, Wendell led the Cardinal with
19 kills and 21 digs, followed closely by Hromadka and
junior Anne Wicks. Eick was the star of the night,
however, with a career-high 11 digs and a career-tying
five blocks.
While the Cardinal pulled off Saturday's match 16-
14, 15-12, 15-10, it continued to struggle offensively.
Stanford was forced to battle out of a hole in game one
to even the score at 14-14. A pair of Hromadka kills
pulled the Cardinal ahead and Wendell smashed down
the game point.
"We were fortunate we were able to pull that first
game out, which speaks well for our players," Shaw
said. "We battled back and found a way to do it but we
can't keep relying on that. We've got to come out with
a little bit more fire."
Oregon kept the pressure on during the second
game, scoring five straight points to come within two
of the Cardinal at 14-12. Triefenbach's smash proved
more than the Ducks could handle, however, as she
swung for the victory.

with careless hitting errors as the
team's problem area. While the
Cardinal clearly has room to
improve its attack, he also noticed
improvement from the previous
night.
"We're blocking the slide a lot
better than we have been," Shaw
said after Saturday's match. "I

think our block was better in
where we were putting it and how
we played our defense around it."
Hromadka topped the Cardinal
defense with 14 digs and two solo
blocks. Triefenbach was the
night's kill leader with 15 smashes
in 27 swingß, good for a .519 hit
ting percentage. Senior Piper
Hahn ended a characteristically
strong weekend with a total of 76
sets and 22 digs.
"I think we're playing like we
have been playing," Wicks said.

"We have moments when we look
absolutely terrific and we have
moments when we look like the
worst team in the Pac-10."
Coming out of the matches, the
Cardinal takes sole possession of
second-place in the Pac-10 behind
unbeaten UCLA.
"These two nights prove that
there's no easy match in this con
ference, anything is possible,"
Shaw said. "It's a very short ride
from second-place to sixth or sev
enth."

more Marnie Triefenbach's left-side smash and three
blocks by freshman Eileen Murfee provided the impe
tus for Stanford's relatively quick fourth-game victo
ry.
"We got the hang of things after awhile,"Shaw
said. "We learned to wait on our block and it also
shows in our hitting percentages. I really liked our
effort — we need to play with the same high intensi
ty, but with more control."
In her usual fashion, Wendell led the Cardinal with
19 kills and 21 digs, followed closely by Hromadka and
junior Anne Wicks. Eick was the star of the night,
however, with a career-high 11 digs and a career-tying
five blocks.
While the Cardinal pulled off Saturday's match 16-
14, 15-12, 15-10, it continued to struggle offensively.
Stanford was forced to battle out of a hole in game one
to even the score at 14-14. A pair of Hromadka kills
pulled the Cardinal ahead and Wendell smashed down
the game point.
"We were fortunate we were able to pull that first
game out, which speaks well for our players," Shaw
said. "We battled back and found a way to do it but we
can't keep relying on that. We've got to come out with
a little bit more fire."
Oregon kept the pressure on during the second
game, scoring five straight points to come within two
of the Cardinal at 14-12. Triefenbach's smash proved
more than the Ducks could handle, however, as she
swung for the victory.

with careless hitting errors as the
team's problem area. While the
Cardinal clearly has room to
improve its attack, he also noticed
improvement from the previous
night.
"We're blocking the slide a lot
better than we have been," Shaw
said after Saturday's match. "I

think our block was better in
where we were putting it and how
we played our defense around it."
Hromadka topped the Cardinal
defense with 14 digs and two solo
blocks. Triefenbach was the
night's kill leader with 15 smashes
in 27 swingß, good for a .519 hit
ting percentage. Senior Piper
Hahn ended a characteristically
strong weekend with a total of 76
sets and 22 digs.
"I think we're playing like we
have been playing," Wicks said.

"We have moments when we look
absolutely terrific and we have
moments when we look like the
worst team in the Pac-10."
Coming out of the matches, the
Cardinal takes sole possession of
second-place in the Pac-10 behind
unbeaten UCLA.
"These two nights prove that
there's no easy match in this con
ference, anything is possible,"
Shaw said. "It's a very short ride
from second-place to sixth or sev
enth."
It might have taken the Stanford women's volley
ball team a while to get moving, but, when push came
to shove, the squad kicked into fifth gear this week
end.
Despite sluggish starts in both games, the No. 3
Cardinal (14-3, 7-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
chalked up two more wins this weekend, defeating
No. 23 Oregon State (12-6, 5-4) on Friday night, then
sweeping Oregon (4-13, 1-8) the following night in
Maples Pavilion.
"It's nice to win, to get the weekend over with,"
said coach Don Shaw.
While a victory is a victory, Stanford had to earn
each hard-fought point. The battle was particularly
fierce against an Oregon team that managed to secure
the first game. The Cardinal finally settled into its
groove, however, and outlasted the Beavers 11-15,17-
15, 16-14, 15-4.
A tough serving effort by Oregon at the outset of
the match, coupled with a string of Cardinal hitting
errors, propelled the Beavers to an early lead in game
one. Stanford managed to even the score at 9-9, but
finally succumbed to the Beaver attack.
Stanford showed signs of revival midway through
the second game after getting off to another slow
beginning. Senior outside hitter Heidi Eick spear
headed the Cardinal effort, together with sophomores
Cary Wendell and Wendy Hromadka, to raise the
team's hitting percentage to .200 from its .098 mark
in game one.
"It was a real battle, a very competitive match,"
Shaw said. "We were on the ropes a few times but
looking at a 2-0 (match) deficit, we managed to pull it
out."
After a tight third game, Stanford started to heat
up in game four as Oregon ran out of steam. Sopho
