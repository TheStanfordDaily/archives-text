## Campbell, six other contenders debate issues facing California 
### Jim Ho 
School vouchers, abortion and
gun control dominated a lively de
bate Friday afternoon that fea
tured former congressman and
Law Prof. Tom Campbell and six
other candidates vying for a vacat
ed position in the state Senate.
Running for the 11th District
seat, formerly held by three-term
senator Becky Morgan who re
signed this summer, are five can
didates from the two meyor par
ties, a Libertarian, an Indepen
dent and a write-in candidate for
the American Independent Party.
Mark Simon, a columnist for
The San Francisco Chronicle,
moderated the open-forum debate

held before a small audience in
Annenberg Auditorium, taking
questions from the audience and
asking a few himself.
The debate started off with
criticisms of Campbell, a Republi
can, who is widely considered the
front-runner in the Senate race.
Phil Stokes, Democrat and for
mer president of the West Val
ley/Mission Community College
Board, opened the round of at
tacks on Campbell.
"Republicans view this as a
step back for him," Stokes said,
adding that Campbell regarded
the state Senate as merely an op
portunity to "remain in the public
arena" in order to launch another campaign
to return to Washington, D.C.
Campbell ran for the U.S. Senate in
1992, but lost the primary to Bruce Her
schensohn, who was defeated in November
by Barbara Boxer.
Campbell responded to Stokes' criticism
by stressing his dedication to the issues cur
rently facing California. He said that, if
elected, he would likely run again in 1996.
The debate also turned to issues such as
Prop. 174, the controversial school-voucher
initiative which will also be on the ballot in
November.
Campbell, who opposes the measure, was
asked why he had switched positions
months ago. "I did not fully understand it, I
admit... I did not read the second half," he
explained. "But it is irresponsible to create
this entitlement without any guarantee of a
way to support it."
Campbell said competition from the
voucher system could improve public
schools, and that he supported some vouch
er systems, such as one in Wisconsin which
is restricted to the poor and can only be used
toward non-denominational schools. But he
opposes the California measure because it
creates an "entitlement" for students cur
rently enrolled in private schools, which
could cost the state $1.3 billion.
Democrat and Inc. magazine journalist
Hal Plotkin also spoke out against Prop.
174, but spent as much time criticizing
Campbell. "What bothers me is whether
Tom Campbell has carefully read the second
half of any of his legislation" while in
Congress, he said.

The other five candidates expressed a
mix of views on the school-voucher issue,
with arguments on everything from its
financial effects to its educational conse
quences.
Jack Hickey u Republican and write-in
candidate for the American Independent
Party said his campaign is based on the pas
sage of Prop. 174, and attacked the reform
efforts of the California Teacher's Associa
tion and the National Educator's Associa
tion as "tax-supported tinker toys."
Jon Petersen, a Libertarian candidate
and chair of the Santa Clara Libertarian
Party, also in support of the measure, coun
tered Campbell's fiscal argument, saying
that "California would be broke without
174."
Independent candidate Nancy Jewell
Cross, however, argued that public schools
are the only way to create a learning envi
ronment of "diversity," and that the vouch
er measure would be "educationally disas
trous."
The audience also questioned the candi
dates on other issues, including abortion and
gun control. Plotkin claimed that, at a recent
Women's Legislators Caucus meeting, two
Republican women privately expressed their
support for him because Campbell had bro
ken his promise to push for the abortion
platform at the Republican National Con
vention in Houston last year. Plotkin did not
name the two women legislators.
Campbell, the only candidate endorsed
by the California Abortion Rights Action
League, responded by reiterating his
"unwavering" support for abortion rights.
He explained that his failure to push the
platform was more a rejection of a conserva
tive convention he was "disgusted" by, and
that he did not recall making any such
promise.

Campbell, who opposes the measure, was
asked why he had switched positions
months ago. "I did not fully understand it, I
admit... I did not read the second half," he
explained. "But it is irresponsible to create
this entitlement without any guarantee of a
way to support it."
Campbell said competition from the
voucher system could improve public
schools, and that he supported some vouch
er systems, such as one in Wisconsin which
is restricted to the poor and can only be used
toward non-denominational schools. But he
opposes the California measure because it
creates an "entitlement" for students cur
rently enrolled in private schools, which
could cost the state $1.3 billion.
Democrat and Inc. magazine journalist
Hal Plotkin also spoke out against Prop.
174, but spent as much time criticizing
Campbell. "What bothers me is whether
Tom Campbell has carefully read the second
half of any of his legislation" while in
Congress, he said.

The other five candidates expressed a
mix of views on the school-voucher issue,
with arguments on everything from its
financial effects to its educational conse
quences.
Jack Hickey u Republican and write-in
candidate for the American Independent
Party said his campaign is based on the pas
sage of Prop. 174, and attacked the reform
efforts of the California Teacher's Associa
tion and the National Educator's Associa
tion as "tax-supported tinker toys."
Jon Petersen, a Libertarian candidate
and chair of the Santa Clara Libertarian
Party, also in support of the measure, coun
tered Campbell's fiscal argument, saying
that "California would be broke without
174."
Independent candidate Nancy Jewell
Cross, however, argued that public schools
are the only way to create a learning envi
ronment of "diversity," and that the vouch
er measure would be "educationally disas
trous."
The audience also questioned the candi
dates on other issues, including abortion and
gun control. Plotkin claimed that, at a recent
Women's Legislators Caucus meeting, two
Republican women privately expressed their
support for him because Campbell had bro
ken his promise to push for the abortion
platform at the Republican National Con
vention in Houston last year. Plotkin did not
name the two women legislators.
Campbell, the only candidate endorsed
by the California Abortion Rights Action
League, responded by reiterating his
"unwavering" support for abortion rights.
He explained that his failure to push the
platform was more a rejection of a conserva
tive convention he was "disgusted" by, and
that he did not recall making any such
promise.
