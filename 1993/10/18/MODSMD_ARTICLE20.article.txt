# No. 1 water polo squad upset by Pacific Tigers

### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
Although the Cardinal water polo team
began its weekend road series by coasting
to a 16-9 win over UC-Davis Saturday,
Stanford ran into streaking Pacific (12-3)
Sunday in Stockton, Calif. The Tigers
handed Stanford (15-2, 2-0 in the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) their sec
ond loss of the season, prevailing 10-7.
Stanford began the weekend by domi
nating the match at Davis, jumping out to
a 7-1 lead at the end of one quarter of play
and holding the Aggies at bay for the rest
of the game.
In the match, Stanford displayed a bal
anced offensive attack in which 11 differ
ent players scored goals. Five Cardinal
players, including senior offensive captain
Chris Wallin, scored twice.
Defensively, the Cardinal was anchored
by sophomore goaltender Jack Bo wen,
who recorded seven saves.
The lopsided win, however, proved to
be an insufficient tune-up for Stanford's
clash with UOP.
"This is the best team UOP has ever
had," said coach Dante Dettamanti.
"They redshirted three or four juniors
last year and had a really good group com
ing back."

UOP was led by Todd Hosmer and
Darren Baldwin, both of whom contribut
ed four goals apiece. Stanford's Frank
Schneider had three goals to lead the Car
dinal.
"What it boiled down to is that we over
looked them," Dettamanti said. For UOP,
"a win over us is more than a win over the
No. 1 team. It will make their program, no
matter what happens the rest of the sea
son."
UOP has proved itself worthy of their
current No. 4 ranking, as they have gar
nered wins over Stanford, No. 2 USC, No.
5 UCI and No. 6 UCLA so far in the sea
son.
From the outset of Sunday's game,
things did not go well for the Cardinal.
"We made a lot of mistakes," Wallin
said. "We were working hard, but things
just didn't go our way. It was a combina
tion of a lot of different problems - mis
communication, steals and overall
defense."
Even with the Cardinal's numerous
problems, a two-point shot by freshman
Brian Wallin cut the Tiger's lead to 8-7
with a minute-and-a-half remaining in
the third quarter.
