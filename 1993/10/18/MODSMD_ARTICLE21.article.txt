# Men's soccer kicks Huskies
##

Just when you thought the men's soccer
team was down and out, the opening line of
the new and improved squad came out last
weekend during the team's road trip
through the northwest. And they came out
strong.
The debut was a big seller up north as
Stanford (4-8-1, 2-2 in Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation play), defeated in five of its
last six games and virtually eliminated from
post season play, upset defending MPSF
champs Washington 1-0 on Friday and then
mauled Oregon State 4-0 on Sunday.
It might have been that fresh, clean
mountain air. Or perhaps it was the back
drop of snow-capped mountains and luscious
pine forests. More likely, it was that drive for
dignity that every losing team strives to
attain in a season scarred by disappointment
and what could have been.
The game against the Huskies showcased
the Cardinal defense. Washington collected
only eight shots on the afternoon, and only
one of those required goalkeeper Jim Maset
ti to make a save.
Oddly enough, Stanford mustered only
seven shots on Husky All-American goal

keeper Dusty Hudock. But Cardinal mid
fielder Ryan Collins' header past Hudock 22
minutes into the second half, off a feeder
pass from Ricky Goad, proved to be all Stan
ford needed to chalk up the upset.
Stanford's declawing of the Huskies was
made sweeter by a well-known fact in the
MSPF world: it's tough to win on Washing
ton's home field. The Cardinal seemed to
have no problem answering the tremendous
call. Even last year's highly-touted Stanford
squad couldn't muster a win against the
Huskies last season.
The Cardinal's trip took a turn south
Sunday, as they met the struggling Beavers
(3-8, 2-3) in Corvallis. Stanford wasted no
time in allowing Oregon State to think it was
actually going to be a good game, as Collins
scored his sixth goal of the season only 2:28
into the contest.
Thirty-four minutes later the Cardinal
struck again. Goad scored the first of his two
goals in the contest off a pass from Collins
that he one-touch headed into the net. Two
more minutes passed, and after Goad scored
again on a quick turnaround move for his
ninth goal of the season, Stanford led 3-0 and
was on its way to a shutout. A second-half
goal by junior Ryan Estevez was icing on the
cake.
