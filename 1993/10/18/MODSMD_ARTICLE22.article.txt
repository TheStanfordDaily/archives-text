# Hockey bedeviled by Duke
## 
### Christian Leone Staff writer 
The Cardinal field hockey team went to
Berkeley this weekend. However, they did not
have to face the Golden Bears of California,
who have defeated Stanford twice this year.
Instead, they combatted Duke.
Yet the results were the same, as Stanford
suffered its third staight loss this Sunday. The
2-1 disappointment to the Blue Devils (3-8)
lowers the Cardinal's record to 5-7.
Down 1-0 midway through the second half,
the Cardinal was awarded a penalty corner.
Elise Morgan pushed the ball to Leah Jacobs,
who stopped the ball for Sara Hallock. Hal
lock's slap shot deflected off the Blue Devil
goalkeeper and tied the game at one.
With 10 seconds left in the game, Duke
charged downfield on a breakaway. The ball
was brought up the right side of the field and
passed to a streaking, debateably offsides

Duke forward for an open shot at victory.
Faced with the one-on-one, Hidalgo sprint
ed to break up the play. She slid and cleared
the ball, only to hear the referee's whistle sig
nal a penalty. Duke was given a stroke (a
penalty shot seven yards from the goal),
because the official believed Duke would have
scored if it were not for Hidalgo's foul.
"It was a bum call," said Hidalgo. "I was
just going for the ball."
After several minutes of argument, the
Duke forward fired a shot past Hidalgo and
put Duke up for good.
"It was a nightmare," said senior Markley
Bavinger. "It was very demoralizing because
it should have had a different outcome. She
was offsides, and even if she wasn't [Duke]
should have been given a corner, not a stroke.
A stroke is like a given goal. We don't want to
whine about it because that's how the game
goes; but it is unfortunate it had to end that
way."
