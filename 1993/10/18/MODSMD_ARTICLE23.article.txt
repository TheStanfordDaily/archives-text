# No. 5 linksters to tee off in Chicago
## 
### Andrew Blachman 
The men's golf team, ranked fifth in
the nation, is perhaps one of Stanford's
best-kept athletic secrets.
Today and tomorrow they will put
their ranking on the line and travel to
Chicago for the Northwestern Universi
ty Quintessence along with 12 of the top
teams in the country.
The return of three redshirts from
last season and the addition of William
Yanigasawa, an All-Big West Conference
transfer from UC-Irvine, gives this
year's squad added experience.
"This is a very tough team and the
key will be to remain motivated through
out the long season," said coach Wally
Goodwin. The year-long season will test
the linksters' mettle, as the NCAA
championships won't be decided until
late spring. Goodwin expects that the
squad's experience will help motivate
them throughout their grueling sched
ule.
Ail-Americans Notah Begay 111, Casey
Martin and Steve Burdick will anchor a
squad which also includes Yanigasawa
and Brad Lanning, a former All-Pacific

10 Conference player. Four of the top
five, with the exception of Burdick, sat
out last season in order to gain another
year of eligibility. With their return,
Goodwin hopes to field one of Stanford's
best teams ever. Darren Dragovich will
fill in for Burdick, who is not traveling
with the team this week due to an Ail-
American tournament.
The Cardinal's strength and depth
have not gone unnoticed in other parts of
the country. "It's the way other coaches
perceive you," Goodwin said. "The fact
that we were ranked in the top 10 before
the season even started meant that
coaches around the country knew what
was going on here." As the season pro
gressed, Stanford has climbed in the
polls to their current No. 5 position, the
highest ranking in the team's history.
In the young season, the squad has
already proven itself worthy of its rank
ing. At the prestigious Tucker Invita
tional in Albuquerque, N.M., three
weeks ago, the Cardinal shot three con
secutive rounds under par for the first
time in school history and went on to
surprise the field by winning the tourna
ment.

A week later in El Paso, TX., Stanford
competed with the top 18 teams in the
country. A disappointing first round
knocked Stanford out of contention in
the tournament.
The following day, however, Stanford
shocked all onlookers by shooting an
incredible 285, three strokes better than
anyone else and 10-and-a-half strokes
above the average team at the tourna
ment.
Traveling to Northwestern will have
special meaning for Goodwin, who guid
ed the Wildcats for six seasons before
coming to Stanford. "It's very sentimen
tal for me," Goodwin said. "I took a lot of
Northwestern teams out here and it will
be fun to take a Stanford team to Chica
go for the first time."
Goodwin knows that he will need
solid performances from all players to
remain one of the top teams in the
nation. He also knows that team chem
istry is essential to victory.
"You don't go anywhere in intercolle
giate golf unless all five guys are psycho
logically together," he said. "There's
nowhere to hide a player on a golf
course."
