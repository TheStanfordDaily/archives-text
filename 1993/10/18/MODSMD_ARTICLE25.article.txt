The Stanford men's tennis team faced stiff com
petition last week in Austin, Texas, at the Intercolle
giate Tennis Association Men's Ail-American Cham
pionships, their first tournament of the year.
Of the five Cardinal men competing in this year's
first collegiate Grand Slam event, only senior
Michael Flanagan was able to advance past the first
round of the five-day main draw.
"I thought we did a pretty good job, considering
that we weren't match-tough," said coach Dick
Gould, "while most of the schools we played have
already seen action this year, our guys hadn't played
competitively since August."
Flanagan, seeded first in the tourney and ranked
fifth nationally in the ITA preseason poll, chalked up
three victories before bowing to host Texas' lan
Williams in the semifinals, 6-4, 6-4.
After defeating Boise State's Ernesto Diaz and
Southwest Missouri State's Wynn Criswell, Flana
gan scored an emotional quarterfinal victory over
Joaquim Appelqvist of Mississippi. Despite losing the
first set 3-6 and going down 0-3 in the second, Flana
gan came back to win the last two sets, 6-3 and 6-1.
"Michael's greatest asset has always been his
heart, and that was evident in his quarterfinal

match," Gould said.
The other Cardinal men did not fare as well as
Flanagan. Jeff Salzenstein and Chris Cocotoe both
failed to qualify for the main draw of 32 players.
The No. 3 seed in the tournament, senior Robert
Devens, was upset in the first round by Chad Clark
of Texas, 7-6,6-2.
Vimal Patel, ranked 18th nationally, also lost his
first-round match. Hampered by a deep muscle pull
in his back, he lost to Mike Castrilli of Idaho State, 6-
2,6-4.
In doubles play, partners Devens and Patel lost in
the first round to Reni Feneon and Van Lingen of Ole
Miss, 6-7,6-1,6-1.
The tandem of Flanagan and Cocotos advanced
past the first round, defeating LSU's Mahesh
Bhutathi and lan Trevino, 6-2, 7-6. But they lost
their second-round match to Laurent Miquelard and
Joe Simmons of Mississippi State, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4.
Gould was impressed with the quality of play in
general at the tournament and predicted that this
will be a great year for college tennis.
"The top eight teams will be involved in a real dog
fight, with Stanford right in the thick of it," Gould
said.
The Cardinal men will next see action at the Rolex
Regional Qualifying Tournament, to be held on the
Farm Nov. 5-8.
