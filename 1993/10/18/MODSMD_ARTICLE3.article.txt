The conference brought about

from 16 different states to Stan
ford to discuss current issues af
fecting gays in the work environ
ment. A pre-conference for about
90 corporate human resources
personnel was held on Friday,
with representatives from 59
companies.
Workplace issues are "the cut-

ting edge" for gay and lesbian
equality, said Torie Osborn, exec
utive director of the National Gay
and Lesbian Task Force.
"Gay and lesbian equality is
going to be won in the corporate
suites, not the courts," she said.
"It's in the best interest of busi
ness to give equal rights to gays
and lesbians in the workplace."
Osborn said that the confer
ence acts as an organizational hub
for gay and lesbians in the busi
ness world.
She called Stanford's hosting
of the event, M a strong statement
of support (from the University)."
