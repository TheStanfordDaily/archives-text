### Chris Broekhoff 
Titled "Out and Equal in the
'908," the National Gay and Les
bian Task Force held their third
annual conference on gay and les
bian issues in the workplace on
campus this weekend.
The conference brought about
400 gay and lesbian professionals
from 16 different states to Stan
ford to discuss current issues af
fecting gays in the work environ
ment. A pre-conference for about
90 corporate human resources
personnel was held on Friday,
with representatives from 59
companies.
Workplace issues are "the cut-

ting edge" for gay and lesbian
equality, said Torie Osborn, exec
utive director of the National Gay
and Lesbian Task Force.
"Gay and lesbian equality is
going to be won in the corporate
suites, not the courts," she said.
"It's in the best interest of busi
ness to give equal rights to gays
and lesbians in the workplace."
Osborn said that the confer
ence acts as an organizational hub
for gay and lesbians in the busi
ness world.
She called Stanford's hosting
of the event, M a strong statement
of support (from the University)."
Conference chair George Kro
nenberger noted that the number
of companies offering domestic
partner benefits has increased
since the conference started three
years.
Along with two featured
keynote speakers, the weekend
included workshops, panels and
social events.
With titles including "Knocking
on the Closet Door" and "Breaking
through the Lavender Ceiling,"
conference workshops covered a
wide range of topics, from obtain
ing domestic-partner benefits and
conducting an effective job search
to starting a gay-owned business.
Sophia Collier, who co-founded
the American Natural Beverage
Corp. (makers of Soho Natural
Soda) and is now the CEO of
Working Assets Capital Manage
ment, delivered Friday's keynote
speech.

Collier stressed the important
role that gay-owned businesses
have played in helping people
"come out" about their sexual ori
entation. "This conference is tak
ing workplace security to a new
level," she said.
R. David Cruise, director of
intergovernmental affairs for the
U.S. Department of Commerce,
spoke Saturday on the steps that
the gay and lesbian community
needs to take to obtain equality
though business. It was his first
public appearance as an identified
gay man.
Cruise called for the creation of
"a national coalition of lesbian and
gay employee groups to extend the
work of this conference nation
wide and year-round."
He also emphasized the need
for a "coordinated, strategically
sophisticated effort" to educate
regulatory agencies, from the
Securities and Exchange Commis
sion to local business development
districts.
And finally, he urged listeners
to "invent lavender capitalism, an

investment strategy (that would)
both reward the firms that respect
us and penalize those who don't."
Speakers from Stanford also
shared their workplace experi
ences at the conference. Troy
Gilbert, adviser to the Lesbian,
Gay, and Bisexual Community
Center at Stanford, opened Satur
day's events. Gilbert praised Stan
ford for its domestic partner bene
fits and anonymous HIV testing.
Another Stanford speaker,
Asst. Gynecology and Obstetrics
Prof. Kate O'Hanlan, drew upon
her experiences at Stanford in a
workshop she led Saturday on
"Obtaining Domestic Partner
Benefits in Your Organization."
And opening Friday's events,
Whayne Herriford, associate con
troller at Stanford and president
of the local Gay Pride organiza
tion, called for equal rights in the
workplace, saying that gay and les
bian issues usually take a back
seat in most companies.
Herriford added, however, that
Stanford is one of the best places he's
worked at as an openly gay man.
