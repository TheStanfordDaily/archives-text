# New benefits program to cut costs by millions
## University, most subscribers to save; married participants will pay more 
### Skip Schwartz Senior staff writer 
On Jan. 1, a new faculty and staff bene
fits program will begin, at a projected sav
ings of $1.5 million for the University.
The new plan, which provides those who
work at Stanford a variety of options for
medical and dental coverage, will also save
faculty and staff members about $3.5 mil
lion, according to Jim Franklin, director of
benefits.
However, not all faculty and staff will
save under the new plan. The 480 faculty
and staff members who are in marriages or
domestic partnerships with another Uni
versity employee will have to pay more than
they are currently paying.
The reason is that these couples "will be
treated as individuals" under the new poli
cy, rather than as couples, Franklin told the
Faculty Senate Thursday. In other words,
couples will no longer have combined cover

age.
Outlining the reasoning behind the new
plan and its numerous options, Franklin
said that, among other factors, Stanford is
not immune to nationwide increases in
health care costs, which prompted a com
prehensive review of the University's plan.
The review was conducted over the past
two years, with a great deal of input from
the Faculty Senate's Committee on Faculty
Benefits, Franklin said in an interview Fri
day.
The committee had "a very informed
and interactive" role in the process, said
History Prof. Judith Brown, the chair of
the committee. Members sat in on focus
groups to examine the health plan and
passed on this feedback to the Benefits Of
fice. She said Thursday that "these very
lively sessions" involved over 300 members
of the faculty and staff.
