# New benefits program to cut costs by millions
## University, most subscribers to save; married participants will pay more 
### Skip Schwartz Senior staff writer 
On Jan. 1, a new faculty and staff bene
fits program will begin, at a projected sav
ings of $1.5 million for the University.
The new plan, which provides those who
work at Stanford a variety of options for
medical and dental coverage, will also save
faculty and staff members about $3.5 mil
lion, according to Jim Franklin, director of
benefits.
However, not all faculty and staff will
save under the new plan. The 480 faculty
and staff members who are in marriages or
domestic partnerships with another Uni
versity employee will have to pay more than
they are currently paying.
The reason is that these couples "will be
treated as individuals" under the new poli
cy, rather than as couples, Franklin told the
Faculty Senate Thursday. In other words,
couples will no longer have combined cover

age.
Outlining the reasoning behind the new
plan and its numerous options, Franklin
said that, among other factors, Stanford is
not immune to nationwide increases in
health care costs, which prompted a com
prehensive review of the University's plan.
The review was conducted over the past
two years, with a great deal of input from
the Faculty Senate's Committee on Faculty
Benefits, Franklin said in an interview Fri
day.
The committee had "a very informed
and interactive" role in the process, said
History Prof. Judith Brown, the chair of
the committee. Members sat in on focus
groups to examine the health plan and
passed on this feedback to the Benefits Of
fice. She said Thursday that "these very
lively sessions" involved over 300 members
of the faculty and staff.
The new plan will continue to
cover all those who are currently
covered — employees with
appointments for longer than six
months who are not members of
the United Stanford Workers
bargaining unit.
At the same time, though, it
will offer a wider range of health
care alternatives than the cur
rent policy does.
Franklin said in his presen
tation Thursday that one of the
objectives in this new plan is to
allow the faculty to be con
scious consumers of health care
who understand and choose
their own plan, rather than
have one standard plan given to
them.
The new plan, however, has
already raised some preliminary
concerns from employed married
couples and domestic partners.
In a letter to the editor in the
Oct. 13 Campus Report, Henry
Lowood, curator for Germanic
collections in Green Library,
expressed his concerns about the
additional costs this new plan

will incur on University
employed couples.
Chemistry Prof. Steven Boxer
also expressed his worry yester
day, saying "My wife and I are
one of these 240 couples and we
are concerned about the
increased costs."
According to Brown, the pre
vious plan's coverage gave cou
ples and domestic partners with
two employees "an undue
advantage."
However, even though her
family will see additional costs
because she and her husband are
one of these 240 couples, Brown
said yesterday that she believes
the plan is "an overall improve
ment for all employees."
One of the advantages that
comes with this new flexible
plan is that it allows these cou
ples to examine their own finan
cial situations and choose "that
which is most advantageous to
them from a financial point of
view," she said.
These options include cover
age for the individual; the indi
vidual and spouse/domestic part
ner; the individual and depen
dent children; or the individual,
spouse/domestic partner and

dependent children.
Brown said the benefits com
mittee discussed the issue of
greater costs to couples and
domestic partners but felt the
change was better for the Uni
versity as a whole.
"We were not recommending
anything we were not willing to
swallow," she added.
One of the widest ranges of
choices in the plan comes in the
medical coverage and its five
options.
The new plan allows Stanford
employees to choose between a
"triple-option" plan regarding
primary-care physicians, a catas
trophic plan, the three HMOs
currently used, an out-of-area
medical plan, or no coverage at
all.
The catastrophic plan allows
those with generally low medical
expenses the option of "low-cost
medical coverage" to protect
against serious or unexpected ill
ness.
The out-of-area plan makes
medical coverage available to
faculty members on sabbatical.
The no-coverage option is avail
able only if the employee has
coverage provided elsewhere.

The new plan also gives its
insurees the option of receiving
cash.
If the coverage an employee
chooses is less than the amount
the University pays, the employ
ee can decide to receive cash
back payments of up to $25 per
pay period.
Franklin also said in his pre
sentation Thursday that one
significant cost-efficient change
in the new plan is the fact that
the University will no longer
offer its current HMO supple
ment.
This means the University
will no longer cover care by a
provider not affiliated with one
of the three approved HMOs.
He said the average adminis
trative costs in the last two years
with the supplement were
$810,000, while only $630,000
in claims were made.
While the new flexible plan
will go into effect at the begin
ning of next year, Brown told the
senate that the process is still
"ongoing and subject to change
once it is in place and we see how
it works."
Enrollment in the plan begins
in November.

The catastrophic plan allows
those with generally low medical
expenses the option of "low-cost
medical coverage" to protect
against serious or unexpected ill
ness.
The out-of-area plan makes
medical coverage available to
faculty members on sabbatical.
The no-coverage option is avail
able only if the employee has
coverage provided elsewhere.

The new plan also gives its
insurees the option of receiving
cash.
If the coverage an employee
chooses is less than the amount
the University pays, the employ
ee can decide to receive cash
back payments of up to $25 per
pay period.
Franklin also said in his pre
sentation Thursday that one
significant cost-efficient change
in the new plan is the fact that
the University will no longer
offer its current HMO supple
ment.
This means the University
will no longer cover care by a
provider not affiliated with one
of the three approved HMOs.
He said the average adminis
trative costs in the last two years
with the supplement were
$810,000, while only $630,000
in claims were made.
While the new flexible plan
will go into effect at the begin
ning of next year, Brown told the
senate that the process is still
"ongoing and subject to change
once it is in place and we see how
it works."
Enrollment in the plan begins
in November.
On Jan. 1, a new faculty and staff bene
fits program will begin, at a projected sav
ings of $1.5 million for the University.
The new plan, which provides those who
work at Stanford a variety of options for
medical and dental coverage, will also save
faculty and staff members about $3.5 mil
lion, according to Jim Franklin, director of
benefits.
However, not all faculty and staff will
save under the new plan. The 480 faculty
and staff members who are in marriages or
domestic partnerships with another Uni
versity employee will have to pay more than
they are currently paying.
The reason is that these couples "will be
treated as individuals" under the new poli
cy, rather than as couples, Franklin told the
Faculty Senate Thursday. In other words,
couples will no longer have combined cover

age.
Outlining the reasoning behind the new
plan and its numerous options, Franklin
said that, among other factors, Stanford is
not immune to nationwide increases in
health care costs, which prompted a com
prehensive review of the University's plan.
The review was conducted over the past
two years, with a great deal of input from
the Faculty Senate's Committee on Faculty
Benefits, Franklin said in an interview Fri
day.
The committee had "a very informed
and interactive" role in the process, said
History Prof. Judith Brown, the chair of
the committee. Members sat in on focus
groups to examine the health plan and
passed on this feedback to the Benefits Of
fice. She said Thursday that "these very
lively sessions" involved over 300 members
of the faculty and staff.
The new plan will continue to
cover all those who are currently
covered — employees with
appointments for longer than six
months who are not members of
the United Stanford Workers
bargaining unit.
At the same time, though, it
will offer a wider range of health
care alternatives than the cur
rent policy does.
Franklin said in his presen
tation Thursday that one of the
objectives in this new plan is to
allow the faculty to be con
scious consumers of health care
who understand and choose
their own plan, rather than
have one standard plan given to
them.
The new plan, however, has
already raised some preliminary
concerns from employed married
couples and domestic partners.
In a letter to the editor in the
Oct. 13 Campus Report, Henry
Lowood, curator for Germanic
collections in Green Library,
expressed his concerns about the
additional costs this new plan

will incur on University
employed couples.
Chemistry Prof. Steven Boxer
also expressed his worry yester
day, saying "My wife and I are
one of these 240 couples and we
are concerned about the
increased costs."
According to Brown, the pre
vious plan's coverage gave cou
ples and domestic partners with
two employees "an undue
advantage."
However, even though her
family will see additional costs
because she and her husband are
one of these 240 couples, Brown
said yesterday that she believes
the plan is "an overall improve
ment for all employees."
One of the advantages that
comes with this new flexible
plan is that it allows these cou
ples to examine their own finan
cial situations and choose "that
which is most advantageous to
them from a financial point of
view," she said.
These options include cover
age for the individual; the indi
vidual and spouse/domestic part
ner; the individual and depen
dent children; or the individual,
spouse/domestic partner and

dependent children.
Brown said the benefits com
mittee discussed the issue of
greater costs to couples and
domestic partners but felt the
change was better for the Uni
versity as a whole.
"We were not recommending
anything we were not willing to
swallow," she added.
One of the widest ranges of
choices in the plan comes in the
medical coverage and its five
options.
The new plan allows Stanford
employees to choose between a
"triple-option" plan regarding
primary-care physicians, a catas
trophic plan, the three HMOs
currently used, an out-of-area
medical plan, or no coverage at
all.
The catastrophic plan allows
those with generally low medical
expenses the option of "low-cost
medical coverage" to protect
against serious or unexpected ill
ness.
The out-of-area plan makes
