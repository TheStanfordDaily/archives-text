# New director of Cowell to face budget, staff ills
## 
### Cathy Siciliano Julie Tsai Staff writers 
For students who use Cowell Student
Health Center, the doctor is finally in, and
he's ready to deal with any sort of problem
— medical or administrative.
Dr. Ira Friedman, who will begin work as
the newly appointed director of Cowell by
Jan. 1, says that despite changes in the area
of health care and the problems facing him
at Cowell, he is excited and eager to start at
his new position.
When the new director arrives at Cowell,
he will not only inherit the "tremendous
spectrum of problems* that traditionally
face college health centers, but he will also
inherit the challenge of dealing with Cow

ell's various budget-related problems.
After two of the clinic staffs six doctors
resigned recently, the workload of the re
maining doctors increased by about 50 per
cent per doctor in both primary care and
emergency care, according to Dr. John Dor
man, acting director of Cowell. This in
crease in work has also left doctors with less
time to spend on implementing policy rec
ommendations made by consultants last
year.
Another challenge for the short-stafTed
clinic is the re-examination of doctors' pri
orities. As a result, Cowell's policy on HIV
counseling by staff doctors will likely be
changed.
Dor man said consultants who came to
evaluate the center in the spring
deemed the HIV counseling by
doctors "not good use of doctor
time."
"For each HIV consultation, it
takes two appointments, and it's
time consuming," Dorman said.
"There were over 600 HIV consul
tations in *92 — that's 1,200
appointments. We're short-staffed
for this."
Dorman said that in the future,
these HIV consultations will be
done by alternative methods if
possible, by other staff members
or by confidential student peer
counselors. He added that the stu
dent-counselor consultations have
been well-received in the past.
But rather than viewing these
problems as daunting, Friedman
views them as a personal challenge.
"This is a big career step for
me," said Friedman. In his current
position as medical director for the

UC-Berkeley Student Health Cen
ter, he supervises doctors and
nurse practitioners and maintains
the quality of care administered to
patients.
One of the principal issues
Friedman faces at Berkeley is the
diversity of the student popula
tion, which brings diverse medical
problems to the health center — a
matter he will continue to face at
Stanford.
"I'm prepared for the types of
problems I'm going to face by
nature of having worked so long at
a comparable institution," Fried
man said.
Friedman will also have to deal
with the effects of Cowell's
reduced physician staff.
"Most of the effect [of the doc
tors' absence] is in the intangi
bles," Dorman said. "One of the
many hats I wear is a sort of [pub
lic relations] position where I try
to be responsive to student needs.
"But with the decrease in staff,
there's no opportunity to do other
stuff," Dorman said.

next month to work on a tempo
rary basis, but the Co well adminis
tration is holding back on making
permanent replacements in order
to give Friedman some room when
he arrives, according to Dorm an.
Since one of the doctors who
resigned, Dr. Harold Knaster, was
also head of primary care, Cowell
didn't want two new appointees
simultaneously, Dorman said.
Friedman hopes to include stu
dents in any policy changes in
Cowell's delivery of medical ser
vices as well as in implementing
any changes that are needed to
comply with the Clinton health
plan. "Cowell should aim to be in
the highest quality of health care
alliance in representing the inter
ests of Stanford students," he
said.
"The position is exciting
because it is truly a challenge to
work at such a high quality uni
versity and try to address the
numerous problems facing stu
dents and the campus in the area
of student health and well-being,"
Friedman said.

counselors. He added that the stu
dent-counselor consultations have
been well-received in the past.
But rather than viewing these
problems as daunting, Friedman
views them as a personal challenge.
"This is a big career step for
me," said Friedman. In his current
position as medical director for the

UC-Berkeley Student Health Cen
ter, he supervises doctors and
nurse practitioners and maintains
the quality of care administered to
patients.
One of the principal issues
Friedman faces at Berkeley is the
diversity of the student popula
tion, which brings diverse medical
problems to the health center — a
matter he will continue to face at
Stanford.
"I'm prepared for the types of
problems I'm going to face by
nature of having worked so long at
a comparable institution," Fried
man said.
Friedman will also have to deal
with the effects of Cowell's
reduced physician staff.
"Most of the effect [of the doc
tors' absence] is in the intangi
bles," Dorman said. "One of the
many hats I wear is a sort of [pub
lic relations] position where I try
to be responsive to student needs.
"But with the decrease in staff,
there's no opportunity to do other
stuff," Dorman said.

next month to work on a tempo
rary basis, but the Co well adminis
tration is holding back on making
permanent replacements in order
to give Friedman some room when
he arrives, according to Dorm an.
Since one of the doctors who
resigned, Dr. Harold Knaster, was
also head of primary care, Cowell
didn't want two new appointees
simultaneously, Dorman said.
Friedman hopes to include stu
dents in any policy changes in
Cowell's delivery of medical ser
vices as well as in implementing
any changes that are needed to
comply with the Clinton health
plan. "Cowell should aim to be in
the highest quality of health care
alliance in representing the inter
ests of Stanford students," he
said.
"The position is exciting
because it is truly a challenge to
work at such a high quality uni
versity and try to address the
numerous problems facing stu
dents and the campus in the area
of student health and well-being,"
Friedman said.
