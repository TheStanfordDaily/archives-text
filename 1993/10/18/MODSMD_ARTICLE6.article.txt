# 600 freshmen surveyed on eating habits
## 
### Charles Katz Staff writer 
In order to determine which types of eating
disorder services the University should pro
vide, a committee run by Cowell Student
Health Center surveyed three-fourths of all
freshmen women last week about their eating
habits.
Members of the Research, Education, and
Action for Choices of Health Committee hand
ed out the survey at all dormitory meetings
where freshmen were present. From the ap
proximately 800 freshman women, more than
600 surveys were returned.
The questionnaire, which took between 10
and 15 minutes to fill out, asked questions in

tended to help the committee figure out what
types of programs, if any, are needed on cam
pus to help prevent eating disorders among
women, said Cowell Psychologist Karen
Huang, chairman of the committee's subcom
mittee on research.
Women of the Class of '97 will be surveyed
once again during spring quarter and then
once a year for the next three years. Graduate
student Traci Mann, who volunteers for the
committee, said that the time element — the
survey's four-year span — is critical for deter
mining when eating disorders and their relat
ed problems arise.
"If you want to develop effective programs,
you have to know both what problems come up
and when they come up," she said.

The questions used on the survey were all
"standardized instruments," Huang said,
meaning they are questions that other re
searchers have used in similar tests. Since it
asks already-tested questions, the survey's re
sults can be better analyzed, she said.
Although the University supports the sur
vey, the funding for the project has come
through donations and through the work of
volunteers, Huang said. There are about 20 re
search assistants who are volunteering to help
with the survey.
The committee, which oversees the four
year survey, is made up of doctors, psycholo
gists, undergraduates and graduate students.
It has only women members and
was formed last year in an effort
to get all campus women's orga
nizations to work together to
solve these problems.
Even though some programs
are already in place to help stu
dents with eating disorders on
campus, these are not tailored to
fit any collected data, Mann said.
"There is no way to know what
the need is unless you ask," she
said. "Many women feel isolated
and don't think the University
cares."
Although the surveys have yet
to be scientifically analyzed, at
first glance the results are dis
turbing, Mann said. "I was
shocked at the high level of dis
satisfaction over their bodies
among women. Almost all women
said they were on a diet of some
sort," she said.
The questionnaire, which
asked students about their eating
habits as well as what they
thought of their appearance, was
completely anonymous. Included
in the survey were questions

about height and weight, so the
researchers could evaluate how
different types of women viewed
themselves.
Cowell has conducted smaller
surveys on its own, but this is the
first comprehensive survey that
will track students over four
years. Its previous studies on eat
ing disorders show that 1 percent
of Stanford women are bulimic
and many more have tendencies
toward eating problems, Huang
said.
Researchers will implement
future programs based on the
results of the survey. Huang
said she hopes new programs
could begin as early as this year,
based on results from the first
survey.
Freshman Teresa Matt, who
participated in the survey, said
the survey was "a good idea
because it made me more aware
of potential eating-disorder prob
lems."
Many freshmen were forced to
think about their own attitudes
as a result of the survey. "I think
a lot of [women] surprised them
selves with their answers. They
thought, 'Wow, look at all the
ones we answered yes to,' " Matt
said.
