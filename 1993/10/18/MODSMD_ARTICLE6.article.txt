In order to determine which types of eating
disorder services the University should pro
vide, a committee run by Cowell Student
Health Center surveyed three-fourths of all
freshmen women last week about their eating
habits.
Members of the Research, Education, and
Action for Choices of Health Committee hand
ed out the survey at all dormitory meetings
where freshmen were present. From the ap
proximately 800 freshman women, more than
600 surveys were returned.
The questionnaire, which took between 10
and 15 minutes to fill out, asked questions in

tended to help the committee figure out what
types of programs, if any, are needed on cam
pus to help prevent eating disorders among
women, said Cowell Psychologist Karen
Huang, chairman of the committee's subcom
mittee on research.
Women of the Class of '97 will be surveyed
once again during spring quarter and then
once a year for the next three years. Graduate
student Traci Mann, who volunteers for the
committee, said that the time element — the
survey's four-year span — is critical for deter
mining when eating disorders and their relat
ed problems arise.
"If you want to develop effective programs,
you have to know both what problems come up
and when they come up," she said.

The questions used on the survey were all
"standardized instruments," Huang said,
meaning they are questions that other re
searchers have used in similar tests. Since it
asks already-tested questions, the survey's re
sults can be better analyzed, she said.
Although the University supports the sur
vey, the funding for the project has come
through donations and through the work of
volunteers, Huang said. There are about 20 re
search assistants who are volunteering to help
with the survey.
The committee, which oversees the four
year survey, is made up of doctors, psycholo
gists, undergraduates and graduate students.
