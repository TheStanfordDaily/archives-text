BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) â€” Security forces
seized about 1.5 tons of cocaine in two raids on
drug-processing laboratories in the jungles of east
ern Colombia, a newspaper reported yesterday.
In one of the raids Saturday, security forces
exchanged gunfire with guards, thought to be
leftist rebels, at a large cocaine complex in the
remote Vichada province, about 375 miles east of
Bogota, El Espectador said.
Government forces seized three small air
planes and 1,760 pounds of cocaine, which was
packaged and ready to be smuggled abroad, the
newspaper said.
In a second raid, government forces in the
eastern province of Guainia confiscated a twin
engine plane from Bolivia abandoned because of
mechanical problems, the newspaper reported.
They found 1,320 pounds of cocaine inside.
