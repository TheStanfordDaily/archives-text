Kids-
Most women don't know that
aging, as well as smoking, diet and
lifestyle, can dramatically increase
their risk of heart disease.
Every year, an estimated half a
million women past 45 will have a
heart attack. Nearly half of them
will die. Making it the number one
killer of women in America today.
But it doesn't have to be. If
women would only speak to their
doctors, there's a good chance
heart disease could be prevented
What you don't know about
heart disease may kill you. But
what you do know may save you
