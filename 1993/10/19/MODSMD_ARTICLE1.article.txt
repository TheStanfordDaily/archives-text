# NLRB post for Gould?
## Despite opposition, colleagues expect his confirmation 
### Sandy Lee Staff writer 
Although Law Prof. William
Gould's nomination to head the
White House National Labor Re
lations Board has recently met

with opposition
from several na
tional business
groups, col
leagues say this
is not expected to
jeopardize his
nomination.
Gould, an ar
biter and scholar
of labor law, was

nominated by President Clinton
Aug. 6. Until his Senate commit
tee hearings last week, public re
action to his nomination had been
largely favorable and his confir
mation had been expected to
move quickly through the Senate.
The belated opposition coin
cides with a possible last-minute
move by Republicans to stall the
vote in the Senate. The delay
would also put pressure on Presi
dent Clinton to fill the final seat
on the Board with a Republican
nominee.
Although Gould declined to
comment on his pending confir
mation and the recent opposition,
the White House remains confi
dent that Gould will sail through
his confirmation, said Lorraine
Voles, a spokesperson for the
White House Press Office.
"The hearings last week went
well. If the opposition has raised
any questions, Prof. Gould an
swered them quite thoroughly,"
Voles said. If confirmed, Gould
will become the first black Ameri
can to head the NLRB.
While his knowledge and schol
arship are not under dispute,


Gould
