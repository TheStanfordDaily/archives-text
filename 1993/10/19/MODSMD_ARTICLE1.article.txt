# NLRB post for Gould?
## Despite opposition, colleagues expect his confirmation 
### Sandy Lee Staff writer 
Although Law Prof. William
Gould's nomination to head the
White House National Labor Re
lations Board has recently met

with opposition
from several na
tional business
groups, col
leagues say this
is not expected to
jeopardize his
nomination.
Gould, an ar
biter and scholar
of labor law, was

nominated by President Clinton
Aug. 6. Until his Senate commit
tee hearings last week, public re
action to his nomination had been
largely favorable and his confir
mation had been expected to
move quickly through the Senate.
The belated opposition coin
cides with a possible last-minute
move by Republicans to stall the
vote in the Senate. The delay
would also put pressure on Presi
dent Clinton to fill the final seat
on the Board with a Republican
nominee.
Although Gould declined to
comment on his pending confir
mation and the recent opposition,
the White House remains confi
dent that Gould will sail through
his confirmation, said Lorraine
Voles, a spokesperson for the
White House Press Office.
"The hearings last week went
well. If the opposition has raised
any questions, Prof. Gould an
swered them quite thoroughly,"
Voles said. If confirmed, Gould
will become the first black Ameri
can to head the NLRB.
While his knowledge and schol
arship are not under dispute,


Gould
Gould's proposal to allow workers
to unionize more easily by reform
ing the National Labor Relations
Act has sparked some controversy
over his nomination, said Busi
ness School Prof. Bill Simon.
The attacks are grounded in
Gould's many writings that sug
gest changes in the National Labor
Relations Act, according to Santa
Clara University Law Prof. Her
man Levy, a labor law specialist
who worked as an NLRB attorney
with Gould more than 20 years
ago.
"The last change to the act came
in 1959. It's time for some kind of
changes, but that's not up to
[Gould]," he said, explaining that
the opposition mistakenly believes
that Gould would have the power
to enact such drastic reform.
Levy said he circulated a peti
tion endorsing Gould as a "truly
qualified person to head the
National Labor Relations Board."
Seventy-six labor and employ
ment-law scholars signed the
petition, which was sent to the
Senate Committee on Labor and
Human Resources, the group
responsible for Gould's confirma

tion hearings.
"There's no sound basis for
attacking him," Levy said.
What the opponents fail to see
is that the proposals are simply
ideas, and any changes would
have to go through Congress, he
said.
In a statement made during
his hearings, Gould agreed that
he is committed first to his role as
a law interpreter.
"The critical difference between
Prof. Gould and Chairman Gould
is that in the latter capacity, my
responsibility as one of five deci
sion makers is concerned solely
with the interpretation of the law
as it is presently written," Gould
said in the statement.
Despite this assertion, the
business sector that has formally
opposed his nomination antici
pates that Gould will actively
move policy toward strengthen
ing labor at the expense of man
agement.
However, Levy suggests that
the business groups are near-sight
ed in their opposition. "His writ
ings propose changes that are good
for unions and others that are good
for management. [For example,
Gould 1 has suggested better labor
management cooperation that
both sides will like," he said.
Simon said that Gould has

been misconstrued as a left-wing
extremist. "When the opposition
is specific, it reflects the fallacy
that it should be hard for workers
to organize," he said. Gould "has
proposed reforms to make it easi
er to get unions, and the opposi
tion doesn't believe in that; they
believe in weak unions."
"Gould is no raving radical by
any means. He's a moderate
who's spent his whole life in the
labor movement," Simon said.
Law School Dean Paul Brest
said, "In his field, he is regarded
as one of the top scholars of labor
law. My own sense of his scholar
ship is that he's not an ideologue.
He has a fair-minded view of pub
lic policy in this area."
Despite misled assumptions,
Simon said Gould's possible con
firmation is expected to send a
positive message to organized
labor.
"It's the first time in the past
decade that you'll see a board with
a person who is more sympathetic
to the labor provision of the origi
nal labor relations act," Simon
said. "For the past 12 years, the
board has been fairly restrictive in
the interpretation of the act, mak
ing it difficult for labor to orga
nize, and shifting the balance of
power in labor-management rela
tions toward management."

In a statement made during
his hearings, Gould agreed that
he is committed first to his role as
a law interpreter.
"The critical difference between
Prof. Gould and Chairman Gould
is that in the latter capacity, my
responsibility as one of five deci
sion makers is concerned solely
with the interpretation of the law
as it is presently written," Gould
said in the statement.
Despite this assertion, the
business sector that has formally
opposed his nomination antici
pates that Gould will actively
move policy toward strengthen
ing labor at the expense of man
agement.
However, Levy suggests that
the business groups are near-sight
ed in their opposition. "His writ
ings propose changes that are good
for unions and others that are good
for management. [For example,
Gould 1 has suggested better labor
management cooperation that
both sides will like," he said.
Simon said that Gould has

been misconstrued as a left-wing
extremist. "When the opposition
is specific, it reflects the fallacy
that it should be hard for workers
to organize," he said. Gould "has
proposed reforms to make it easi
er to get unions, and the opposi
tion doesn't believe in that; they
believe in weak unions."
"Gould is no raving radical by
any means. He's a moderate
who's spent his whole life in the
labor movement," Simon said.
Law School Dean Paul Brest
said, "In his field, he is regarded
as one of the top scholars of labor
law. My own sense of his scholar
ship is that he's not an ideologue.
He has a fair-minded view of pub
lic policy in this area."
Despite misled assumptions,
Simon said Gould's possible con
firmation is expected to send a
positive message to organized
labor.
"It's the first time in the past
decade that you'll see a board with
a person who is more sympathetic
to the labor provision of the origi
nal labor relations act," Simon
said. "For the past 12 years, the
board has been fairly restrictive in
the interpretation of the act, mak
ing it difficult for labor to orga
nize, and shifting the balance of
power in labor-management rela
tions toward management."
Although Law Prof. William
Gould's nomination to head the
White House National Labor Re
lations Board has recently met

with opposition
from several na
tional business
groups, col
leagues say this
is not expected to
jeopardize his
nomination.
Gould, an ar
biter and scholar
of labor law, was

nominated by President Clinton
Aug. 6. Until his Senate commit
tee hearings last week, public re
action to his nomination had been
largely favorable and his confir
mation had been expected to
move quickly through the Senate.
The belated opposition coin
cides with a possible last-minute
move by Republicans to stall the
vote in the Senate. The delay
would also put pressure on Presi
dent Clinton to fill the final seat
on the Board with a Republican
nominee.
Although Gould declined to
comment on his pending confir
mation and the recent opposition,
the White House remains confi
dent that Gould will sail through
his confirmation, said Lorraine
Voles, a spokesperson for the
White House Press Office.
"The hearings last week went
well. If the opposition has raised
any questions, Prof. Gould an
swered them quite thoroughly,"
Voles said. If confirmed, Gould
will become the first black Ameri
can to head the NLRB.
While his knowledge and schol
arship are not under dispute,


Gould
Gould's proposal to allow workers
to unionize more easily by reform
ing the National Labor Relations
Act has sparked some controversy
over his nomination, said Busi
ness School Prof. Bill Simon.
The attacks are grounded in
Gould's many writings that sug
gest changes in the National Labor
Relations Act, according to Santa
Clara University Law Prof. Her
man Levy, a labor law specialist
who worked as an NLRB attorney
with Gould more than 20 years
ago.
"The last change to the act came
in 1959. It's time for some kind of
changes, but that's not up to
[Gould]," he said, explaining that
the opposition mistakenly believes
that Gould would have the power
to enact such drastic reform.
Levy said he circulated a peti
tion endorsing Gould as a "truly
qualified person to head the
National Labor Relations Board."
Seventy-six labor and employ
ment-law scholars signed the
petition, which was sent to the
Senate Committee on Labor and
Human Resources, the group
responsible for Gould's confirma

tion hearings.
"There's no sound basis for
attacking him," Levy said.
What the opponents fail to see
is that the proposals are simply
ideas, and any changes would
have to go through Congress, he
said.
In a statement made during
his hearings, Gould agreed that
he is committed first to his role as
a law interpreter.
