## Denny beating defendants acquitted on most counts Jury still deadlocked on attempted murder charge; will continue deliberations today 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Two blacks were
acquitted yesterday of most of the felony
charges in the beating of white trucker Regi
nald Denny and other motorists at the start
of the 1992 riots, easing fears of renewed
racial tensions.
The multiracial jury ended the day still
deadlocked on the most serious count —
attempted murder against defendant Dami
an Williams in the videotaped attack of
Denny — and deadlocked on an assault
count against Henry Watson.
Superior Court Judge John Ouderkirk
ordered the jury to resume deliberations
today, saying he hoped that a "good night's
rest" would be helpful.
The jury convicted the defendants of less
er counts. It first told Ouderkirk it was dead
locked on three charges. He told jurors to
continue deliberating and hours later, it
found Williams innocent of a robbery
charge.
Accepting the defense argument that
Williams and Watson were caught up in mob
violence after the state Rodney King beating
trial, the jurors acquitted them of most
charges that required specific intent.
Defense psychologists testified that
Williams, 20, and his 29-year-old co-defen
dant acted in the heat of the moment and
couldn't have planned their actions.
Their heads newly shaven, Williams and
Watson sat calmly as the verdicts were read,
except when the clerk announced "Not
Guilty" on an aggravated mayhem charge
against Williams, which could have brought
him life in prison. Williams clapped his hands
over his eyes, reared back in his seat and
hugged his attorney.

The jury convicted Williams on simple
mayhem, with a maximum penalty of up to
eight years in prison.
In the charges decided against him, Wat
son was acquitted of all but simple assault
on Denny, a lesser related offense that car
ries a maximum penalty of only six months
in prison. The jury rejected the charge that
Watson, who has been held since shortly
after the riots, tried to kill Denny, the
count that could have brought him life in
prison.
"I am in total agreement (with the
jurors)," Denny told the TV tabloid show
"Inside Edition." "They should let the guy
go. He spent a year-and-a-half in jail and has
had time to think about what happened."
He said he wouldn't comment on
Williams until the jury finished deliberating.
As the verdicts were read, Watson's moth
er, Joyce, sat in the courtroom's front row,
stifling sobs with a handkerchief after Oud
erkirk had warned the audience against out
bursts.
Williams, who gained fame when he was
personally arrested by former Police Chief
Daryl Gates, was acquitted of eight counts.
Gates, now a radio personality,
denounced the verdicts as unjust.
"We know they're guilty. But I under
stand this is our system," Gates said.
The new police chief, Willie Williams, said
he was pleased with community response,
which remained generally calm.
And in South Central Los Angeles, scene
of the worst rioting, the Rev. Leonard Jack
son of First AME Church said: "There is a
sense of calm and there is a sense of true jus
tice. We saw justice working at its best."
