Peace mission interrupted

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)
Renegade government soldiers returned
one of two stolen U.N. armored vehicles
yesterday after a U.N. commander said the
thefts jeopardized the peacekeeping mis
sion in Sarajevo.
The United Nations feared the hijacked
armored personnel carriers would be used
in combat against Serbs, compromising the
1,600 U.N. peacekeepers in the city.
Such use of the vehicles — with or with
out their U.N. markings — would discredit
the U.N. mission further in the view of cap
ital residents who feel that the world body
has failed to protect them from Sorb guns.
The smaller of the two French vehicles
was returned yesterday, said Sgt. Frans van
Mourik, a U.N. spokesman. He said negoti
ations for the ret urn of the other were con
tinuing with a renegade government
brigade.
Gen. Jean Cot of France, commander of
U.N. troops in former Yugoslavia, said in a
statement that the situation "could have
serious repercussions on the continuance of
(tlie U.N. peacekeeping) mission in Saraje
vo" if not resolved.

Clinton supports grin bill

WASHINGTON (AP) — Expanding his
anti-crime program, President Clinton yes
terday embraced a proposal that would
make it illegal for minors to possess hand
guns under most circumstances.
In endorsing a bill by Sen. Herb Kohl, D-
Wis., Clinton rejected an alternate
approach by Sen. John Chafee, R-R.1., that
would ban Jill handgun ownership by pri
vate citizens.
"I would have a little problem with a

total ban on handguns," Clinton said.
The president has long supported the
so-called Brady bill, which would require
a five-day waiting period for the pur
chase of handguns. I lis anti-crime pack
age also calls for banning some assault
weapons.
Kohl's bill would make it a federal crime
to sell a handgun to a minor or for a minor
to possess a handgun under most circum
stances. Exceptions would be made for
when a parent is supervising, or when the
minor is hunting or shooting for sport.

Ginsburg gains credit

WASHINGTON (AP) — Judging by her
energetic questioning from the bench,
Supremo Court Justice Ruth Bader Gins
burg is quickly hitt ing full stride in her new
job.
Intensive questioning last week bv Gins
burg in a sexual-harassment case caused
one lawyer to abandon his contention that
the woman who had filed suit must prove
the conduct harmed her performance at
work.
During her first two weeks of high court
arguments, Ginsburg has asked lawyers
frequent and probing questions on other
issues such as drug forfeitures mid civil
rights law.
"She has hit the ground running," said
Stuart M. Gerson, former acting attorney
general in the Mush administration. "She
has shown a great deal of energy and pre
paredness. Being on the court is awe-inspir
ing, but she is not awe-struck."
"It's hard to say that she'll necessarily
change a vote in this instance or change the
way an opinion is written," said Marcia
Greenberger of the National Women's Uiw
Center.
