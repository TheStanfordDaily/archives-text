# Haitian military refuses to step down
## Right wing threatens against attempts to enforce embargo

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -
Haiti's military defied an approaching
midnight deadline to yield power yester
day and belittled a U.N. arms and oil
embargo. Its right-wing supporters
warned that any American invaders will
go home "in bags."
Rightists mixed threats against the
outside world with gifts of chrysanthe
mums to foreign reporters, while Lt. Gen
Raoul Cedras, the army strongman, sug
gested new talks on his departure. But the
United States said Cedras was only
stalling.
An army broadcast urged Haitians not
to worry about the U.N.'-authorized embar
go or the U.S. warships steaming offshore
to enforce it, beginning at midnight. The
measures are aimed at forcing the return of
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's first demo

cratically elected president.
Many Haitians have fled the capital,
fearing violence by army-supported Aris
tide opponents or a possible intervention
by U.S. forces.
Asked about that possibility, said Stan
ley Schrager, a U.S. embassy spokesman,
"I m not saying that a military interven
tion is imminent, but clearly there is
always that risk."
"We accuse the Aristide-Malval govern
ment of having threatened this govern
ment with arms ... by collaborating with
foreign forces," said former Sen. Reynald
Georges, alluding to the threat of U.S.
intervention.
But later, far-right sociologist
Jacquelin Montalvo-Despeignes said he
had a message for Washington: "If you
send boys, they will go back, in bags."

Such threats led to the evacuation of
hundreds of U.N. personnel and recom
mendations by Canada and Belgium for
their citizens to leave. About 9,000 Amer
ican citizens, 8,000 of them Haitian-
Americans, did not get similar warnings,
and very few foreigners were seen at the
airport yesterday.
After the departure Saturday of the
last U.S. members of what was to have
been a 1,600-member U.N. 'force to retrain
police and help rebuild the economy, the
only U.S. troops in the country were
approximately 45 Marines guarding the
U.S. Embassy. About 30 Marines came
Saturday to beef up security.
U.S. officials continued to express con
fidence about the implementation of the
U.N. pact, which called for Aristide to
return Oct. 30.
