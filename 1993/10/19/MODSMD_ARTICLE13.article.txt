# Soldiers confronted by armed Somalis

MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — U.S.
soldiers fired at an armed group that
approached their base yesterday, and
U.N. troops fired warning shots in three
other skirmishes as a nine-day lull in
fighting appeared to fray.
There were no signs the incidents
wore related. Isolated grenade, mortar
and gunfire attacks over the past week
or so have been tied to clans fighting in
Mogadishu and have not appeared
aimed at the multinational peacekeep
ing force.
This port on the Indian Ocean had
been at its quietest in four years since
militiamen of warlord Mohamed Farrah
Aidid shot down two helicopters in a
battle that killed 18 American soldiers

Oct. 3. Aidid spokesmen said more than
300 Somalis died.
Outrage in the United States over the
toll persuaded President Clinton to
choose diplomacy over military force.
Aidid called a cease-fire last week and
released an American pilot and a Nigeri
an peacekeeper he was holding hostage.
A U.N. spokeswoman, Capt. Dawn
Kilpatrick, said no one was injured
when American troops opened fire as 10
armed Somalis approached their
"Sword Base" in southwestern
Mogadishu.
"They fired warning shots, and the
Somalis ... all fled," she said.
But journalists said up to four Soma
li men who appeared to have been

wounded in the incident were being
treated at Benadir Hospital.
Only one peacekeeper has been killed
since Aidid announced the cease-fire, a
Greek killed when bandits attacked an
aid convoy outside Baidoa in central
Somalia. Aidid's power is mostly con
fined to southern Mogadishu.
The increase in attempted attacks in
the capital might be linked to Aidid's
displeasure over the United Nation not
releasing some 70 detainees, including
his four top aides.
Though Clinton, Aidid and the Unit
ed Nations said no deal was struck for
the release of the two peacekeepers last
week, Aidid's followers expected a recip
rocal gesture.
