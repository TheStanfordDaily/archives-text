Stealing campus papers
to silence other opinions
deserves judicial action

LAST WEEK, a theft occurred
on campus. And while the
crime was just as illegal as
the stealing of a bike or automo
bile, its motivations were far, far
different and significantly more
sinister.
Between 2,500 and 3,000 copies
of The Stanford Review were
stolen from their on-campus distri
bution points last week. These
publications had little monetary
worth beyond the recycling value
of the paper; what were more
notable were the thoughts and
ideas present on each page.
But apparently some person or
persons did not want Stanford stu
dents to be exposed to new ideas
that may not conform to many
campus norms. To ensure that this
would not happen, the copies of
The Review were stolen.
This crime was an abhorrent
violation of the tenets of free
speech. The Review posits ideas
into the campus forum that often
times run contrary to the predom
inant ideology of students and fac
ulty on campus. But the fact that
its opinions may occasionally be in
the minority does not strip them of
their worth.
Stanford University is a place of
ideas. It is a place where people are
intended to engage in rational
debate. It is a place where
paradigms are challenged and new
beliefs take root. It is not a place
where opponents to a person or
group's view or views avoid dealing
with a topic by silencing their
opposition through crime and
intimidation.
Unfortunately, similarly repug
nant acts have recently occurred at
other universities, suggesting that
the criminals at Stanford may be
indicative of a larger movement to
extinguish any opinions which

may run contrary to university
norms. Four thousand copies of a
conservative Pennsylvania State
publication were stolen one night
last spring; currently, criminal
charges are being brought against
the two students who decided that
students should not be exposed to
the newspaper's ideas. Compara
ble events have taken place at
Dartmouth College and the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania.
Administration reactions to
these crimes has varied. As
opposed to the admirable, thoughO
firm, stand taken by Penn State,
the editors of the Dartmouth
Review were told that their stolen
papers fell under the category of
"abandoned property, which any
one is free to do with as he or she
sees fit."
Such attitudes are both conde
scending and dangerous. There is
an integral difference between dis
agreeing with someone and effec
tively silencing them. For a univer
sity to be complicit in these acts is
doubly concerning; institutions
presumably in existence for the
purpose of encouraging open
thought have effectively become
sanctioning forces in their own
right.
It is hoped that Stanford will
prosecute this matter to its fullest
ability. Simply put, theft is theft.
The popularity or unpopularity of
the Stanford Review or the ideas it
issues should not be a factor in
bringing those responsible for last
week's crime to justice.
Furthermore, it should be
remembered that efforts to impose
a single standard of thought at the
University run particularly con
trary to the basic principles which
underlie both Stanford and a Stan
ford education. The Farm has
cherished its role as a place where
old ideas are critically evaluated;
our buildings look outward toward
the world rather than inward
toward hidebound traditions. To
suppress an idea — any idea —
would be to turn our back on what
makes Stanford unique among
universities.
