## Surviving family values 
### 
SOME STUDIES have shown that
individuals with close families are
less susceptible to stress-related
sicknesses. After surviving the pres
sures of a close family everything would
seem easy, I am sure.
I spent about four weeks at home
with my parents this summer. The first
week was filled with all of my favorite
meals, family outings to the latest
movies, and get-togethers with other
nearby relatives. I felt closer to my par
ents than I had since first coming to
Stanford.
Unfortunately the feeling did not
last. Erom the apex of familial bliss,
things at home soon deteriorated to the
valley of inter-generational discord. My
parents have some very definite ideas on
how a 21-year-old should live his life.
They have the correct answers for all of
the basic issues of life — my academics,
my career and my social life. After all,
they have the wisdom of experience.
The problem is that I see a different
world from my parents. Genetics has
conspired to make me as stubborn as
Mom and Dad, but time has given me
some very different ideas. What upsets
me most is not that my parents disagree
with me. I find it most difficult to con
tend with the authoritative relationship,
which no matter how liberal one's par
ents are, always comes through on some
level. As old and wise as my parents may
be, I know myself better than they do,

and I frankly trust my own decisions.
To be truthful, 1 think that my indig
nant feelings transcend this simple
inter-generational angst. There are little
problems between my parents and me. I
am on a completely different sleep cycle
from my parents, 1 enjoy spending time
with friends at establishments which
serve pernicious alcoholic beverages,
and I think that I should have a mod
icum of personal privacy, even when at
home. While these are not unique
issues, this is a partial list of why I can
no longer think of my parents' home as
my home.
Is that a terrible thing to say? Am 1 a
disrespectful, ungrateful son? I don't
think so. 1 love my parents, but at some
point one must move on to live a life of
one's own. I know my parents never
planned for me to occupy the same
square room all of my life. As maladjust
ed as I might be, I am no Cliff Clavin.
The problem is that I think my parents
do not want to accept the inevitable.
I don't know how to get through to
Mom and Dad. My mother cries, my
father screams, and 1 feel a tremendous
burden of guilt. All of our education
teaches us how to make tough decisions,
but we are never taught how to convince
others to accept the choices we make.
The diplomatic theory taught in Politi
cal Science 35 is no help when trying to
overcome the bipolarity of parent-child
relations.

To many, I guess all that I have said
is nothing new. Yes, George Bush, we
need more family values, but sometimes
these values become oppressive. Yes,
America has become a fragmented
aggregate of nuclear families, but 1 don't
want to live with all of my family under
one roof. In essence, while the number
and circumstances of inner-city single
mother families are tragic, I do not
think that the traditional family struc
ture is always the answer.
Parents must love and care for their
children, but they also must learn to
trust the judgment and decisions of
their children. Parents must be willing
to listen to their children, and we, as
sons and daughters, cannot be afraid to
say and do what we think is right.
I believe this is the unspoken rite of
passage for those of us reaching the end
of our undergraduate years. It is not the
career and social decisions which are
most difficult. The most stressful task is
often finding a new niche within one's
family.
In the end one must be stoic. Any
thing which doesn't kill you makes you
stronger.
