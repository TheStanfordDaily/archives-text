## Some undergrads also receive little from ASSU fees 
### 
WHILE I'M not associated with
The Graduate Student Tea
Party, I think that I, too,
deserve to be labeled "The Grinch" by
your fine, ASSU-fee-funded publication.
True, I am an undergrad, so I supposed
ly receive a disproportionate share of the
benefits produced by the ASSU's excel
lent "student services." What a deal! I
hand over my $37 per quarter, and I
receive . . . what?
In her letter in yesterday's Daily,
Lisbeth Lispari lists a few of the myriad
programs which I am funding: "charity
and volunteer organizations; environ
mental activism; cultural events; public
speakers; The Daily; KZSU radio;
Asian, Black, Chicano, American Indian
and women student organizations; the
Symphony; and sexual assault preven
tion organizations. . . Thanks, Lis
beth.
Just one small problem, though:
What about me? Seems I'm always slip

ping through the cracks in the multicul
tural give-away sidewalk at this school.
Yes, I admit, I'm a white male (and
straight, too, just for good measure). But
here's an even greater heresy: I don't
care about your culture. No, I mean it.
You want to dance the way your ances
tors danced? Fine. I don't care. Eat cul
turally distinct foods, dress up in exotic
clothes? Well, aren't you special? I still
don't care.
Don't misunderstand me; I won't be
hypocritical about this. For you legions
of halfway objective multicultural advo
cates who want to celebrate my culture,
too: don't bother. I can't imagine why
you'd care about good Scottish folk who
wear skirts and throw telephone poles.
Oh, but then, you don't care - my cul
ture, you say, pervades our entire soci
ety. Yes, each time I see a student walk
ing around campus, books held in one
hand, telephone pole balanced precari
ously by the other, I reflect for a

moment on Scotland's cultural imperial
ism.
I'm being silly again, pretending I
have a right to cultural distinction like
the rest of you. Won't I ever be success
fully brainwashed â€” er, I mean, learn? I
tried to make an ethnic declaration on
Axess, but there's no category for me.
The computer scolded me: "You don't
have an ethnic declaration!" Whoops,
sorry, just thought I could get in on all
this "in touch with my culture" stuff,
excuse me. . . .
I have an alternative funding system
to propose, so that you know I don't
want a "free lunch." I'll contribute to
the charities I choose, on my own. If I go
to see a speaker or the Symphony, I'll
pay at the door. (But no one will attend
if they have to pay, you say? Well, what
does that tell you?) Don't worry about
jamming KZSU so I can't hear it for
free. A free radio station would bo a dar
ing innovation, but I've never listened to

KZSU anyway. The Daily, and environ
mental activism? Well, when my contri
bution is withdrawn, you can produce
one less Daily each day. Save a tree and
all. Somehow, my dorm will make do
with only 49 copies of the Daily for the
52 residents living here. Cultural
events? What are those? Axess tells me I
don't even have a culture.
Yes, I am the (irinch. And the ASSU
is Santa Claus. And Santa has little elves
who toil year-round so that little chil
dren can get their presents. Well, I
refuse to be your little elf any longer;
you'll have to look elsewhere for your
slave labor. "Selfish?" Exactly. Guilty as
charged. I know, I'm being silly again,
but I expect something in return for my
$37. "Self-interested?" That too. All of
your pious accusations are right on tar
get, except one. I think you're wrong
about who's asking for a free lunch.
