# N'Gai Croal: Notes of non-native son

Die, nigger
So black people can take over!
— Last Poets, "Die Nigger"
EVER WONDER WHY black people
never wanted to go where every
body knows your name? It may
have had something to do with the bar
tender. At a Friars Club roast for Whoopi
Goldberg, her boyfriend Ted Danson
came out in blackface and asked for a
watermelon to quench his thirst. It gets
better, though. He told of how Whoopi's
housecleaning skills made his parents
more accepting, explained that anal sex
was their preventive against mixed chil
dren, joked about the feel of her liver-lips
around his . . . well, you get the picture.
Whoopi's response? "Nigger, nigger,
nigger, nigger, nigger ... I don't care if
anyone doesn't like it, I think it's funny."
Robert Guillaume and supermodel Bever
ly Johnson agreed; talk-show host Montel
Williams and New York City Mayor
David Dinkins begged to differ, even
though Friars Club roasts are known for
their off-color, no-holds-barred brand of
humor.

Comedian .Jackie Mason must have
adopted Danson and Goldberg's point of
view, because he referred to Mayor Dink
ins and his administration as a bunch of
"shvartzes" at a fundraiser for a Jewish
organization. A friend assures me that
this term is simply Yiddish for "black."
But just as "moulan yan" is Italian for
"eggplant," that doesn't change the fact
that it's also a derogatory word for black
people. Mason and the organization, of
course, maintained that it was all in jest;
perhaps Jesse Jackson was only joking
when he referred to New York as "Hymi
etown" in 1984.
Perhaps emboldened by the maverick
behavior of Danson, Goldberg and
Mason, the producer of "NBC Nightly
News" called Somali warlord Mohammed
Aidid an "educated jungle bunny." He
went on to explain that "the rest of the
jungle bunnies out there are not like this
at all. They're illiterate." Lest we think
him racist, he protested that he was only
trying to explain the mindset of other
people. Smells like damage control to me.
What's going on here?

I'm a nigga
he's a nigga
she's a nigga
we're all niggaz
wouldn 7 you like to he a mgga too?
— NWA, Niggaz 4 Life
Today's mass media creates an envi
ronment in which it's sexy to use the
word "nigger" and other words like it.
Backlash against the P.C. straw man tells
us that if we are politically incorrect,
we're free-thinking, rebellious individu
alists in the best American tradition. We
too can be Howard Sterns, Rush Lim
baughs or Bob Roberts, merely by open
ing our mouths and saying whatever we
want We too can denigrate blacks, Lati
nos, Jews, gays, lesbians and women. But
we aren't racist, anti-semitic, homopho
bic or misogynist. We're politically incor
rect. We're supercool.
We're also cool like dat, according to
much of rap music, if we can say the word
"nigga" like we mean it. Gangsta rap is
made largely by urban black people for
other urban black people, who use the

term "nigga" as both a term of endear
ment and insult, depending on the tone
and inflection. But more than three-quar
ters of the people who purchase rap
records are white, and over 50 percent live
in suburban neighborhoods. So it's doubt
ful that little Timmy will encounter any of
the gun-totin', crotch-grabbin' niggas that
he listens to in Dolby surround sound —
or any black person, for that matter.
Let's put ourselves in little Timmy's
place, raised on a steady diet of Def
Comedy Jam and Snoop Doggy Dogg. If
we've never met any black people, and
the ones we listen to call each other nig
gas, we'd be silly not to use the term
ourselves. Kicking it back to reality, if
Whoopi's down with the word "nigger"
and blackface and black stereotypes,
can't Jackie Mason and Jeff Gralnick be
down, too?
Some people say that it's different
when a black person uses the word nig
ger. Many black comedians argue that
every time they use the word, they chip
away at its power; after all, it's just a
word. But by doing so, they make the

word nigger and its synonyms more
socially acceptable, along with which
comes four hundred years of stereotypes,
oppression and brutality — The Ameri
can Nightmare. A nigger isn't a twenty
something kid with a record deal, a star
comedienne, a mayor or even an on-the
run warlord. A nigger is Rodney King
being beaten down by L.A.'s finest,
Christopher Williams in a hospital bed
with third-degree burns on his back and
chest, and Malice Green lying six feet
deep. That's a nigger.
Accept no substitutes.

Called Your Niga "
