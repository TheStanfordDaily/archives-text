## Battling toward top Wicks leads Cardinal 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
While some athletes excel based on their
physical ability alone, others possess that
certain quality which causes them to stand
out.
Call it motivation.
Call it determination.
Or in Anne Wicks' case, call it a desire to
battle her way to a win.
"The thing that really stands out about
Anne is the intangible — her competitive
spirit," said Stanford women's volleyball
coach Don Shaw. "She's a solid player as a
person, someone you can really count on to
go to battle for you all the way."
As a tri-captain of this year's young
squad, Wicks has been instrumental in lead
ing the Cardinal into and out of hard-fought
battles all season. As her team heads into
the second half of its Pacific 10 Conference
schedule, the middle blocker will have many
more opportunities to face her opponents at
the net.
"I'm a very, very competitive person,"
Wicks said. "I would go crazy if I didn't have
an outlet for my competitiveness — I'm
really kind of obnoxious that way."
Playing on school and club teams since
sixth grade, Wicks found volleyball to be the
perfect outlet. She led her Lakeville, Minn.,
high-school team to the state finals her

senior year and was named the Volleyball
Monthly High School Co-Player of the Year.
Despite her impressive high-school cre
dentials, when it came time to choose a col
lege, Wicks admits she harbored some hesi
tations about coming to the Farm.
"I was really, really intimidated by Stan
ford at first," she said. "Then I came here
and had a great recruiting trip. Once I went
back and thought about things I knew there
was no way I could pass up an education
here."
Coming in as a freshmen accompanied
only by classmate Denise Rotert, Wicks had
every right to be intimidated. With current
national team members Bev Oden and Amy
Cooper occupying the middle blocking posi
tions, Wicks saw limited match action.
"Things now are really different from my
freshman year," she said. "When I came in,
there were just two of us 1 freshmen]; the
team had not lost any starters or main com
ponents, so we were just hanging on for the
ride, learning how things were."
Practicing with her more experienced
teammates, however, gave Wicks time to
adjust to playing the game on the higher
level than she had in high school. She took
these lessons to heart and applied them on
the court her sophomore year.
"Since then, she's really been a real solid
foundation block from a maturity stand
point," Shaw said. "She works so hard, the

improvement is going to be a natural by
product of her hard work. She's always
going to keep getting better because she
never lets herself settle for where she's at."
Finishing her second year with 187 kills

and 102 digs, Wicks is well on her way to
topping both of these figures, already rack
ing up 126 kills, 100 digs and a team-high 46
blocks on the season.
After traveling to Germany with the

National B Team this summer, Wicks
returned to head a Cardinal squad largely
comprised of sophomore and freshmen. She

she leads the team with 46 blocks.
