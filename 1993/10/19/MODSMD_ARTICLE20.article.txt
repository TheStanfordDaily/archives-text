Hockey:
The ice hockey team started its 1993-94 season
with a bang Friday and Saturday night as the Car
dinal crushed University of the Pacific twice, 15-1
and 18-2, at the Golden Gate Ice Arena in Redwood
City.
On the first evening, the club was led by team
captains Corey Sammons and Luke Winters, with
Sammons scoring a goal and contributing three
assists and Winters adding three goals and an
assist. Remato Cedolin duplicated Winters' scor
ing effort. Furthermore, Bill Sutherland played
well in goal, turning away nine UOP shots.
Winters, the team's leading scorer the past two
years, attributes much of his success to his team
mates. "Last year it was a struggle to get the puck
in the net. A group of new guys playing strong this
year, along with the veterans' strong play, makes
it easier for me to put the puck in the net," said
the junior. -
Sean Morrison and Shawn Sarbacker added
two goals and four assists and four goals and an
assist, respectively. Winters and Cedolin also
chipped in two goals each. Once again the Cardi
nal's goalkeeping was supurb, with Keith Bowen
turning away 13 of the 15 shots he faced.
The club's defense was anchored by fifth-year
team member Geoff Garrison, Eric Haug and
Vince Georges. Garrison acknowledged that,
although the defense was not tested, they played
well enough to win. More importantly for
Georges, though, was the fact that he was on the
ice at all, after missing last season with a shoulder
injury.
Though the Cardinal trounced UOP, a pro
gram in its first year, team members are quick to
point out that the remainder of the season will not
be quite so easy: "It's great to start out against an
inexperienced team where we can work on new
lineups and plays, but we know that we will face
much stiffer competition the rest of the season,"
said Sammons.
The Cardinal will next face Northern Arizona
at home this Friday and Saturday, a club Stanford
has never before faced. Though the team is a bit of
a mystery to coach Ernie Ferrari, he knows the
games will be competitive: "They used to be a Divi
sion One hockey team ... so we're expecting two
tough hockey games.'"
