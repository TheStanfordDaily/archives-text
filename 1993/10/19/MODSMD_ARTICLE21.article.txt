## Cross-country makes waves in Michigan 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
According to national cross-country polls, the 11th
ranked Stanford women should have finished behind
teams such as co-No. 9's Notre Dame and Alabama,
while the 15th-ranked Cardinal men should have trailed
No. 10 Notre Dame and No. 11 Michigan at the Michi
gan Invitational last Sunday. Judging strictly by the
rankings, Stanford should not have continued its sea
son-long streak of finishing no worse than second at
such a national-caliber event.
But the weekend's results provided further evidence
why Harry Truman, among others, never placed much

faith in polls; both the Cardinal men and women placed
second in the Michigan Invite. The men's squad was led
by the stellar performance of All-American senior Gaiy
Stolz, who finished first in the eight-kilometer race.
Garnering 98 points, the Stanford men outpaced the
host Wolverines, 18th-ranked Dartmouth, No. 21
William and Mary and No. 22 Tennesse while tying with
the Fighting Irish. Only seventh-ranked Colorado sur
passed the Cardinal, with a 78-point tally. Meanwhile,
the Stanford women out-classed the 13th-ranked Gold
en Buffaloes, the Crimson Tide, Notre Dame, No. 18
Virginia and No. 19 Dartmouth. Their 90-point score
separated them by 24 points from third-place Colorado,
which earned 114 points. Only the third-ranked Wolver

ines' 49-point performance was able to top the Cardinal
women.
"Both teams were impressive all the way through,"
said head coach Vin Lananna. "The young men's team
maintained its composure â€” that's hard for freshmen.
The 30th- to 50th-place guys moved up after the 5-kilo
meter mark, and we ended up tying Notre Dame, a team
that placed sixth at the NCAA championships last year.
As for the women, we packed up in the top 20s and
always gained ground on other teams. As teams, we ran
as well as we could."
As with most team triumphs, individual efforts
sparked Stanford's surge. On
the men's side, captain Stolz's
finish led all 140 runners with a
time of 25:29. He was tailed
closely by freshman Greg Jim
merson, who came in fifth.
Freshmen J.J. White and Andy

Cowgill and senior Todd Lewis
rounded out the Cardinal scor
ing by placing 19th, 34th and
39th respectively.
On the women's side, senior
and defending District-8 champi
on Lousie Watson led Stanford
with a sixth-place performance,
bouncing back from a sub-par
race two weeks ago. Junior
Stephanie Jensen, senior captain
Sarah Truitt and sophomore

Ann Sheehy followed with 15th,
20th and 23rd-place finishes
respectively, while freshman
Amanda White and sophomore
Laura Hayward tied for 26th.
Despite all its success, howev
er, the most encouraging
prospect for the Cardinal is how
much it can still improve.
"I still don't think we've per
formed to our full potential,"
Watson said. "As individuals, we

can all get better. That's what's
encouraging."
"We ran as well as we can on
Oct. 17," Lananna said. "We
were good, but not brilliant. But
that's encouraging. We'll get
even better. For the first time in
years, Stanford will be right in
the thick of things at the Pacific
10 Championships [Oct. 30],
We've got even better things
ahead of us."
