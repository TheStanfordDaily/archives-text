# Carolina cooks Cardinal

Stanford cleared the hurdle but couldn't
get over the wall.
Facing two of the country's top ten teams
this past weekend in Houston, Texas, in the
Challenge Club College Tournament, the
sixth-ranked Cardinal women's soccer team
(11-2-1) defeated eighth-ranked Duke (8-4-1)
1-0 on Friday but fell 3-1 to the No. 1 North
Carolina Tar Heels (12-0) Sunday.
"The team was very excited about this
tournament," said senior forward Sarah
Rafanelli. "Carolina's been looming over our
heads for the year up until now, but we
played with a lot of confidence this week
end."
Facing a young but talented Blue Devil
team on a sunny, humid Friday afternoon,
Stanford's defense held Duke to only nine
shots on goal. The Cardinal mustered 19
shots, but only scored on one. Meanwhile,
senior goalkeeper Leslie Garrard recorded
her 11 shutout of the year.
Rafanelli scored Stanford's only goal six
minutes into the second half, assisted by
Erin Martin and Emily Burt. It was Rafanel
li's 11 goal of the year, giving her 30 points

for the season.
Despite the win over Duke, Rafanelli was
upset with the difficulty the team had in fin
ishing its scoring chances. The Blue Devils
kept the Cardinal out of its typical midfield
er-controlled possession game, but could not
amount an offensive charge of any sort.
However, the Cardinal's fortunes
changed as quickly as the weather. Under
cloudy skies Sunday, Stanford could not stop
the Tar Heel juggernaut from achieving its
NCAA-record 70th consecutive win.
All-American forward Mia Hamm put
North Carolina on the scoreboard just 1:31
into the first half. A U.S. National team play
er since she was 15, Hamm added a second
goal 10 minutes later to create an insur
mountable lead for the Tar Heels. Both of
the goals came on set offensive plays and not
defensive breakdowns, according to Garrard.
Stanford midfielder Carmel Murphy
ruined North Carolina's bid for a shutout
with an unassisted goal six minutes into the
second half, her fifth goal of the year. How
ever, Hamm again made her presence felt as
she assisted on the Tar Heels' final goal by
forward Rita Tower.
