Athletes of the Week — "When the going gets
tough, the tough get going." Though a cliche,
this saying accurately describes the recent per
formances of our Athletes of the Week. When
the competition looked ominous and the death
knell for the Cardinal was already being sound
ed, these two raised their levels of play to lead
Stanford to victory.
The men's soccer team has had an unchar
acteristically tough year, and many believed the

Cardinal had no chance in Friday's game
against Washington, last year's Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation champions. But mid
fielder Ryan Collins is not easily swayed by such
comments. A third-year starter, this junior
from Boca Raton, Fla., headed a cross-field pass
past Huskie All-American goalie Dusty Hudock
and into the net to give the Cardinal a 1-0 win,
easily their biggest of the year.
Collins turned in similarly dominating play
on Sunday, contributing an assist and his sixth
goal of the year to help Stanford blow out Ore
gon State 4-0.
Ryan is no stranger to big goals. As a fresh
man he led the team in assists and points, while
his nine-goal total was second on the squad. For
these achievements he was named freshman
athlete of the year. After having an off-year as a
sophomore, Ryan has re-established himself
this season as a scoring force to be reckoned
with. He is currently second on the team in
both goals and points.

In the Michigan Invitational last weekend,
Stanford faced a daunting task. Seven ranked
teams stood ready to challenge the upstart Car
dinal women's team and their No. 11 national
ranking. Senior Louise Watson was up to the
challenge, and she brought her young team
mates with her. Watson blazed to a sixth-place
finish in the mud at Ann Arbor, pacing Stan
ford to a second-place finish in the ten-team
field.
Some might say such a performance was
expected of the transfer student from Kent,

England. After all, she did win the District-8
meet last year on the Stanford golf course. But
coming after a lackluster performance two
weeks ago at the Stanford Invitational, where
she placed 21st (behind three of her Cardinal
teammates), Watson's strong Michigan Invite
finish reflects the athlete's resolve to rebound
from sub-par showings Watson has fought
back from that dubious finish to regain her cus
tomary position — the front of the pack.
