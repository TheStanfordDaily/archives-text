# Getting pumped up
## Men, muscle and Encina Gym 
### 
"1 like to think of it as the
Fountain of Youth."
So said Mark, a post-doctoral
scholar, as he calmly pedaled his
Bikemaster at Encina Gym the
other day.

No, Mark wasn't talking about
the cute Grecian waterspout that
sits placidly in front of the main
doors of the complex. He was
referring to the Encina Weight
Room, a sweaty warehouse of a
place stashed between the foot
ball locker rooms and athletic
offices inside the spoils facility.
A long, narrow chamber with
high, vaulted ceilings, the Weight
Room looks more like a good
place to film "The Wizard of Oz"
than a workout gym. Roughly 50
weight machines are clustered on
one side of the room; stretch mats
and exercise bikes (ill the other
half of its space.
A lew weeks ago, the place was
a madhouse. It's 5 p.m. now, rush
hour at Encina, and the gym is
virtually empty. "It's the fresh
men," said Salim, a junior.
"When the work starts piling up,
they stop showing up. They
phase out."
David, a student in the School
of Education and resident Encina
psychologist, had a more thor
ough explanation. "They're the
three-week wonders," he said.
"They come here in packs of five,
and roam around in here. I guess
it's just another dorm experience.
Hut give 'em credit for trying."
While I doubt that Res Ed
includes a trip to the weight room
on its mysterious agenda, frosh
do flock to the place. Hut the
crowds have frittered away, leav
ing the gym to more serious body
builders.
Or so they'd have you think.
"If people don't know what
they're doing, they pretend to
know what they're doing," said
Salim. "Nobody around here
wants to seem like thev don't

know what they're doing, espe
cially in the weight room."
Ah, the eternal dilemna of
males: if you are a man, you
belong in the weight room. If you
don't know what you're doing,
you don't belong in the weight
room. If you don't know what
you're doing, you're not a man.
And Encina, while not closed
to women, is definitely a male
dominated arena. Craig Spence,
who works at the weight room,
estimated 75 to 80 percent of its
users are male; Will, a senior, put
the figure at 30 to one.
"The women I know don't feel
comfortable around here," said
Salim. "Guys around here make a
lot of passes at women."
Not so, accoring to Sally, a
freshman. Sally, a member of the
women's novice crew team, feels
no discomfort working out at the
place. "They play music; it's fine."
And if the soothing sounds of
AC/DC aren't comforting
enough, Sally has further recom
pense. "No one comes in here to
pick us up. Looking bright red
and sweaty isn't particularly
attractive."
Resides, what true man has
time to mingle with the opposite
sex when surrounded by so much
machinery? "The serious people
come in, lift hard and don't stand
around and talk," Spence said.
"The guys who think they're the
bufl'est aren't. They're just here
for show."
Real men shut up and lift: it
almost sounds like a Nike com
mercial.
Built almost 75 years ago,
Encina Weight Room will disap
pear from the athletic scene in
the very near future, replaced by
an ultramodern facility being
constructed across the street
Which is none too soon for
some people. "The machines are
old and the gym is cold," said
.Jason, a frosh who was working
out at Encina for the first time. "I
can't wait for that new place to
open."
" This gym lacks good leg and
back machinery," said Salim. He
should know — he's been using
the weight room almost every day
since his freshman year. He
doesn't really mind it, though.
"It's not so bad. It's a bigger gym
than most places."

"There's a need for a lot more
equipment," says Spence. A senior,
Spence has checked Stanford IDs at
the weight room for three years.
"This place can get crowded at times,
too."
The place can get crowded: while
the Fountain of Youth may be
stretching things a bit, Encina has
represented hope for thousands of

males in the Stanford community.
Hope for what? There are thou
sands of peripheral reasons to lift
weights. Men lift to relieve stress. We
liit to take out our frustrations on
inanimate objects. We lift to enjoy the
company of our fellow males, to work
out hand-in-hand and share a bond
ing experience exclusive to our gen
der.
And then there's the real reason
men lifl.
"As you can see, I am kind of
slim." said Will. "I want to be bigger."

ball locker rooms and athletic
offices inside the spoils facility.
A long, narrow chamber with
high, vaulted ceilings, the Weight
Room looks more like a good
place to film "The Wizard of Oz"
than a workout gym. Roughly 50
weight machines are clustered on
one side of the room; stretch mats
and exercise bikes (ill the other
half of its space.
A lew weeks ago, the place was
a madhouse. It's 5 p.m. now, rush
hour at Encina, and the gym is
virtually empty. "It's the fresh
men," said Salim, a junior.
"When the work starts piling up,
they stop showing up. They
phase out."
David, a student in the School
of Education and resident Encina
psychologist, had a more thor
ough explanation. "They're the
three-week wonders," he said.
"They come here in packs of five,
and roam around in here. I guess
it's just another dorm experience.
Hut give 'em credit for trying."
While I doubt that Res Ed
includes a trip to the weight room
on its mysterious agenda, frosh
do flock to the place. Hut the
crowds have frittered away, leav
ing the gym to more serious body
builders.
Or so they'd have you think.
"If people don't know what
they're doing, they pretend to
know what they're doing," said
Salim. "Nobody around here
wants to seem like thev don't

know what they're doing, espe
cially in the weight room."
Ah, the eternal dilemna of
males: if you are a man, you
belong in the weight room. If you
don't know what you're doing,
you don't belong in the weight
room. If you don't know what
you're doing, you're not a man.
And Encina, while not closed
to women, is definitely a male
dominated arena. Craig Spence,
who works at the weight room,
estimated 75 to 80 percent of its
users are male; Will, a senior, put
the figure at 30 to one.
"The women I know don't feel
comfortable around here," said
Salim. "Guys around here make a
lot of passes at women."
Not so, accoring to Sally, a
freshman. Sally, a member of the
women's novice crew team, feels
no discomfort working out at the
place. "They play music; it's fine."
And if the soothing sounds of
AC/DC aren't comforting
enough, Sally has further recom
pense. "No one comes in here to
pick us up. Looking bright red
and sweaty isn't particularly
attractive."
Resides, what true man has
time to mingle with the opposite
sex when surrounded by so much
machinery? "The serious people
come in, lift hard and don't stand
around and talk," Spence said.
"The guys who think they're the
bufl'est aren't. They're just here
for show."
Real men shut up and lift: it
almost sounds like a Nike com
mercial.
Built almost 75 years ago,
Encina Weight Room will disap
pear from the athletic scene in
the very near future, replaced by
an ultramodern facility being
constructed across the street
Which is none too soon for
some people. "The machines are
old and the gym is cold," said
.Jason, a frosh who was working
out at Encina for the first time. "I
can't wait for that new place to
open."
" This gym lacks good leg and
back machinery," said Salim. He
should know — he's been using
the weight room almost every day
since his freshman year. He
doesn't really mind it, though.
"It's not so bad. It's a bigger gym
than most places."

"There's a need for a lot more
equipment," says Spence. A senior,
Spence has checked Stanford IDs at
the weight room for three years.
"This place can get crowded at times,
too."
The place can get crowded: while
the Fountain of Youth may be
stretching things a bit, Encina has
represented hope for thousands of

males in the Stanford community.
Hope for what? There are thou
sands of peripheral reasons to lift
weights. Men lift to relieve stress. We
liit to take out our frustrations on
inanimate objects. We lift to enjoy the
company of our fellow males, to work
out hand-in-hand and share a bond
ing experience exclusive to our gen
der.
And then there's the real reason
men lifl.
"As you can see, I am kind of
slim." said Will. "I want to be bigger."
"1 like to think of it as the
Fountain of Youth."
So said Mark, a post-doctoral
scholar, as he calmly pedaled his
Bikemaster at Encina Gym the
other day.

No, Mark wasn't talking about
the cute Grecian waterspout that
sits placidly in front of the main
doors of the complex. He was
referring to the Encina Weight
Room, a sweaty warehouse of a
place stashed between the foot
ball locker rooms and athletic
offices inside the spoils facility.
