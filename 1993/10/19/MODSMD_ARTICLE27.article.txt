# Earth Sciences creates new department

The School of Earth Sciences merged its
Applied Earth Sciences and Geology Depart
ments this fall to create the Geological and
Environmental Sciences Department.
According to Prof. Gary Ernst, dean of the
School of Earth Sciences, the new department
places a new emphasis on environmental sci
ences. But even with this change, many of the
courses are very similar to the ones offered in
the past in Applied Earth Sciences and Geolo
gy.
"It was not a drastic change," he said. "It
was evolution, not revolution."
Ernst said the two departments were

merged for academic reasons, and not because
of the financial pinch from recent University
wide budget cuts.
Yet Earth Sciences Prof. George Parks —
who served on the committee which decided to
the department — said individuals still ques
tion whether budget cuts simply triggered the
merger or if they really caused it.
"For me personally, I don't think the
change was a loss," said junior John Lucero,
an applied earth sciences major. "The only
thing that worries me is that I declared under
the old system, and if I keep this major I worry
that I'll be graduating with an archaic
degree."
The consolidation of Applied Earth Sci

ences and Geology has helped to cut costs and
provide flexibility, Ernst said. Although the
support staff was cut slightly, the merger did
not effect faculty jobs since most of the facul
ty already belonged to both departments.
In addition, the admittance of graduate
students has become easier, since two sepa
rate admission committees are no longer
needed and paperwork is minimized, Ernst
said.
The Applied Earth Sciences Department
was created in the 1970s by combining the
Mineral Engineering Department with vari
ous courses from Geology. Parks said many
view the merging as the formation of a depart
ment that should have never been split.
