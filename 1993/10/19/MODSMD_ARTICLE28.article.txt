No fees required

Students at UC-Davis will
not be forced to pay the entire
fee for student organizations
on campus, according to a U.S.
Supreme Court decision on
Oct. 1 not to hear a case con
cerning student funding of
political lobby groups.
The case questioned whether
students should have to pay the
$23.50 fee, which is for services
run through the Associated
Students of the University of
California at Davis (ASUCD),
even though some of this fee
funds political lobby units.

The California Supreme
Court ruled that students can
not be required to pay for polit
ical organizations. The U.S.
Supreme Court's decision not
to hear the case essentially lets
this ruling stand.
The University's chancellor
will devise a set of options for
students. Students may be able
to elect which lobby units to give
money to, or they may have to
pay the whole fee upon register
ing and then sign up for refunds
of money paid to organizations
they don't support. Other plans
may also be devised.
