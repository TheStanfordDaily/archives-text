# Commission will start with basics
## Undergrad education group to examine skills at 1st meeting 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
The Commission on Under
graduate Education will devote its
first formal meeting this Friday to
a discussion of the "proficiency
and basic skills" expected of Stan
ford undergraduates, commission
chair James Sheehan said.
The group convened Saturday
at the bucolic Meyer Buck Estate,
spending the better part of the af
ternoon meeting each other and
relating personal undergraduate
experiences, commission mem
bers said.
Sheehan said the issue of basic
skills was one that several of the
panel's 19 members raised as wor
thy of consideration. "As people
talked, it seemed that there was
agreement that this is something
we should be worrying about," he
said.

Sheehan said the commission
will likely engage in an abstract di
alogue on the necessity and proper
format for writing, foreign lan
guage and mathematics require
ments. However, he stressed that
in Friday's meeting — and other
early sessions — "we won't be
making decisions. We'll talk about
how we want to talk about these
things."
He added that no changes were
made to the tentative timetable
for the commission's proceedings
based on Saturday's retreat. The
commission plans to meet each
Friday for two hours.
History Prof. A 1 Camarillo said
Saturday's meeting contained "no
real surprises."
The commission was created
last April by University President
Gerhard Casper to conduct a
sweeping, year-long study of
Stanford's undergraduate pro
gram.
The reaction to Saturday's
retreat was generally positive
among commission members
interviewed. "I thought it went
really well," said junior Luz Her
rera, the commission's only
undergraduate participant.
The informal, six-hour meet
ing began with brief addresses by
Casper and Provost Condoleezza
Rice, consisting mainly of "inspi
rational remarks," Sheehan said.

"They made us feel that this pro
ject is significant and worth
while." The session then moved
to introductions by each member,
and general discussion on "the
kinds of issues we want [the com
mission] to talk about."
Mathematics Prof. Brad
Osgood said that while several
possible areas of study were sug
gested — ranging from distribu
tion requirements to residential
education — a particular issue of
interest was undergraduate
advising, which he described as
currently "not very good."
In relating their own experi
ences as undergraduates, Osgood
said many panel members
stressed "the importance of men

1 think that by the
end of the day, we
began to develop a
sense of confidence.'

toring relationships . . . getting to
know faculty on a one-to-one
basis."
Camarillo said the commission
displayed "a healthy, positive
group context." He said he
expects the commission to be a
"critical group — willing to ques

tion the basic tenets of how we do
things."
Sheehan, Camarillo and
Osgood all emphasized the diver
sity of the members' backgrounds
and degrees of success as under
graduates. "Some did very well;
others had more mixed experi
ences," Sheehan said.
"I was struck by how many are
from small-town and rural back
grounds," Camarillo said. "I
thought a large majority would be
from metropolitan areas."
"People felt comfortable, and
everyone spoke," Sheehan said, in
summarizing Saturday's activi
ties. "I think that by the end of
the day, we began to develop a
