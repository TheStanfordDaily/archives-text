# No more bumps
## Pothole-ridden Palm Drive may be fixed by next year 
### Vanessa Arrington 
The harrowing, headache-in
ducing bumps on Palm Drive
could be smoothed out as early as
next summer, according to Facili
ties officials.
A specific proposal to recon
struct Palm Drive will be submit
ted to the Board of Trustees in
February, according to Mike
Kuntz, Facilities assistant project
manager. The project will be fund
ed by the University's General
Plant Improvement Fund.
Although there are no definite
plans yet, possible changes to the
road include lane reduction and
the addition of at least one
drainage pipe.
Kuntz said the number of in
bound lanes on Palm Drive be

tween El Camino Real and Ar
boretum Road may be reduced to
one, while leaving the two out
bound lanes the same.
In addition, bicycle lanes may
be relocated to the road, and
"some sort of barrier" to control
traffic during football games may
be planned, Kuntz said.
The road renovation could cost
between $2 million and $3 million,
depending on the amount of work
that needs to be done, Kuntz said.
Stanford will hire a team of
civil engineers and landscape ar
chitects to determine exactly what
repairs are needed on the road,
Kuntz said. The civil engineers
will bore samples of the road to
gauge the strength of the roadbed.
This will help Facilities to decide
whether the road needs to be
ground and re-graded with a new
layer of asphalt or if it needs to
be completely dug up and
rebuilt.
Traffic and aesthetic concerns
will also be taken into considera
tion.
Kuntz said the main aesthetic
concern is drainage. "We will look
for the most economical
[drainage] system and then figure
out the design," he said. "A
drainage system will be installed
on the road and at least one side
of the road will have a pipe run
ning down it to collect water. The
water will come back to Vernal
Pond in the Arboretum."
Facilities has still not decided
whether to renovate Palm Drive
in phases, or all at one time — in
which case the road would need to
be completely closed. According to
Kuntz, the decision will most like
ly require discussions with Palo
Alto city officials about traffic
relocation.
Kuntz said Palm Drive has
been a problem for the University
for decades because it was not cor
rectly built.

It was a horse and buggy path
in the 1890s, and layers were
added to the road over the years.
This process led to rough potholes
on the surface of the road and fre
quent flooding of the outside
lanes.
In addition to planning the
reconstruction, Facilities also has
been working on the landscaping
of the roadside.
In October 1992, 12 new palm
trees were installed on Palm
Drive. Since then, three of those
trees have needed to be replaced,
according to campus planner
Drew Oman.
The cause of the trees' deaths
is uncertain, but Oman said that
palm trees generally have a long
life span, and that he does not
anticipate many more deaths in
the near future.
"We have had to make few
replacements," Oman said. "Usu
ally just when the roads around
the trees are reconfigured, we
notice some trees being extraordi
narily rag-tagged."
The installation of the 12 trees
last fall cost $25,000. The money
for this project came from the
interest collected on a University
endowment for landscaping.
Installation of the three replace
ment trees was free, but each tree
cost $1,300.
