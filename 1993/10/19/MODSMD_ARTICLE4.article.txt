# No more bumps
## Pothole-ridden Palm Drive may be fixed by next year 
### Vanessa Arrington 
The harrowing, headache-in
ducing bumps on Palm Drive
could be smoothed out as early as
next summer, according to Facili
ties officials.
A specific proposal to recon
struct Palm Drive will be submit
ted to the Board of Trustees in
February, according to Mike
Kuntz, Facilities assistant project
manager. The project will be fund
ed by the University's General
Plant Improvement Fund.
Although there are no definite
plans yet, possible changes to the
road include lane reduction and
the addition of at least one
drainage pipe.
Kuntz said the number of in
bound lanes on Palm Drive be

tween El Camino Real and Ar
boretum Road may be reduced to
one, while leaving the two out
bound lanes the same.
In addition, bicycle lanes may
be relocated to the road, and
"some sort of barrier" to control
traffic during football games may
be planned, Kuntz said.
The road renovation could cost
between $2 million and $3 million,
depending on the amount of work
that needs to be done, Kuntz said.
Stanford will hire a team of
civil engineers and landscape ar
chitects to determine exactly what
repairs are needed on the road,
Kuntz said. The civil engineers
will bore samples of the road to
gauge the strength of the roadbed.
