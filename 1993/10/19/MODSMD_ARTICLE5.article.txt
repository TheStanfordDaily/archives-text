# Looking for a 'long and productive interregnum'
## Boskin tries to settle down on the Farm 
### Matthew Gregory 
Staff writer
Though he's been back at Stanford
"off and on" for three weeks, Hoover
Senior Fellow Michael »J. Boskin still
hasn't unpacked all his boxes, filled his

bookshelf, decorated the wall of his of
fice or found a permanent executive as
sistant.
And tomorrow, Boskin is off again —
this time for a short stay in Washing
ton, D C., to advise the Federal Reserve
Board.

Despite his hectic pace, Boskin —
who served as chairman of President
Bush's Council of Economic Advisers
for nearly four years — said he is eager
and ready to return to teaching and re
search.
"I'm already advising graduate stu
dents and I '11 be giving some lectures in
various courses" later this year, said
Boskin, who also holds an endowed pro
fessorship in the Economics Depart
ment.
He added that he would like to teach
Economics 1 next fall. "I enjoy teaching
(Introduction to Economics) and the
students seem to think I was reason
ably capable," Boskin said
"I will try to have an active role in
the Economics Department as well as
at Hoover," he explained. In 1988,
Boskin won the Dean's Award for Dis
tinguished Teaching.
Boskin, 48, spent most of this year
deciding what he would do after his
tenure in Washington."I was very for
tunate to have a very large number of
interesting and attractive possibilities,
some in academe, some on Wall Street,
some elsewhere," he explained
He said his decision to return to
Stanford took several months and nu
merous talks with former government
officials who had made "analogous
transitions."
"Their advice was all over the map.
The only common thread was to take
your time," Boskin said, adding that he
was glad he followed the advice
"I decided that my regard for Stan-

he was a top adviser to President Bush.
ford students and my Stanford and
Hoover colleagues and my confi
dence in the new administration
made Stanford the place for me."
Boskin said he is currently
working with Economics Prof.
Lawrence Lau on a book about
the post-World War II economic
growth of the major industrial
ized countries.
He said he is staying in touch
with and advising political con
tacts, "but that's not going to be a
full-time thing."
"For better or for worse I have
several close friends who are going
to be running for president in
1996," Boskin said. "I'm sure I'll
be advising them at [that] time."
Boskin — who taught at Stan
ford from 1971 until getting the
nod from Bush in 1989 — said
that he cares "very deeply" about
the American and world
economies.
Though he said that he has no
great desire to go back into gov
ernment anytime soon, Boskin
added that he might consider
returning after a "long and pro
ductive interregnum doing other

things."
Working in Washington "was
challenging, interesting, exciting,
demanding, educating, debilitat
ing, exasperating and frustrating
all at once," Boskin said.
He said Congress' micro-man
agement of the executive branch
proved to be a damper on his
experience. "I think [that situa
tion] badly needs reform," he
said. "It would be highly desir
able to bring a far more extensive
infusion of common-sense busi
ness practices to an array of gov
ernment activities."
Though he conceded that gov
ernment service has some nega
tive aspects, Boskin said that it
was "quite worthwhile" overall.
"There are some terrific things
about working in public service in
Washington that you can't do"
anywhere else, he added, citing
his 1989 trip to advise Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev on eco
nomic reforms.
Boskin says he is a strong
believer in public service,
"whether in one's community or in
Sacramento or in Washington." If
people don't take time o(T to get
involved, Boskin said, "the govern
ment would be run only by full
time employees and entrenched
officials. That would be bad thing."

officials who had made "analogous
transitions."
"Their advice was all over the map.
The only common thread was to take
your time," Boskin said, adding that he
was glad he followed the advice
"I decided that my regard for Stan-

he was a top adviser to President Bush.
ford students and my Stanford and
Hoover colleagues and my confi
dence in the new administration
made Stanford the place for me."
Boskin said he is currently
working with Economics Prof.
Lawrence Lau on a book about
the post-World War II economic
growth of the major industrial
ized countries.
He said he is staying in touch
with and advising political con
tacts, "but that's not going to be a
full-time thing."
"For better or for worse I have
several close friends who are going
to be running for president in
1996," Boskin said. "I'm sure I'll
be advising them at [that] time."
Boskin — who taught at Stan
ford from 1971 until getting the
nod from Bush in 1989 — said
that he cares "very deeply" about
the American and world
economies.
Though he said that he has no
great desire to go back into gov
ernment anytime soon, Boskin
added that he might consider
returning after a "long and pro
ductive interregnum doing other

things."
Working in Washington "was
challenging, interesting, exciting,
demanding, educating, debilitat
ing, exasperating and frustrating
all at once," Boskin said.
He said Congress' micro-man
agement of the executive branch
proved to be a damper on his
experience. "I think [that situa
tion] badly needs reform," he
said. "It would be highly desir
able to bring a far more extensive
infusion of common-sense busi
ness practices to an array of gov
ernment activities."
Though he conceded that gov
ernment service has some nega
tive aspects, Boskin said that it
was "quite worthwhile" overall.
"There are some terrific things
about working in public service in
Washington that you can't do"
anywhere else, he added, citing
his 1989 trip to advise Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev on eco
nomic reforms.
Boskin says he is a strong
believer in public service,
"whether in one's community or in
Sacramento or in Washington." If
people don't take time o(T to get
involved, Boskin said, "the govern
ment would be run only by full
time employees and entrenched
officials. That would be bad thing."
