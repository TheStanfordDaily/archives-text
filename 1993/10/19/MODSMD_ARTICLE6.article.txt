# Students debate merits of grad student refund drive
## 
### Ritesh Bhavnani 
Different sides of the graduate student
fee-refund controversy faced off last night,
debating the merits of the special fee sys
tem and discussing the discontent of grad
uate students.
Council of Presidents member Ron
Brown, Graduate Student Tea Party co
chair Michael Grant and former ASSU
graduate senator Derek Miyahara also dis
cussed how student organizations could be
affected by the fee-refund conflict.
"The Graduate Student Tea Party will
serve to directly negatively impact the stu
dent organizations that serve to improve
our campus," Brown said in the discussion
on KZSU's "Campus Conference." For the
past few weeks, the new coalition has been
campaigning to urge graduate students to
get their fee refunds.
According to ASSU projections, Brown
said about 40 percent of students will prob

ably collect fee refunds this year, compared
to about 20 percent last year.
Grant justified this decrease in funding.
"We see a lot of imbalance between gradu
ate funding and graduate involvement," he
said "We also see a lack of consideration
among undergraduates on that fact."
Brown said the ASSU has already voted
to put proposals on the agenda that would
help reform the fee-refund system.
The proposal would split the student
body into two groups — graduates and un
dergraduates, Brown said. Both groups
would vote to approve funding for student
organizations at the ASSU spring elec
tions If both groups voted to fund a certain
organization, then that organization would
receive the full special fee, with each group
footing half the cost.
However, if only one group voted to fund
an organization, then the organization
would be funded entirely by the
group that approved it. While this
method would not directly influ
ence the funds allocated to each
organization, Brown admitted it
would increase the fee refunds for
some students in the cases where
only one group is funding the
organization.
Grant expressed his approval
for the proposal, but said that it
could be problematic that most
students are "completely
unaware that the fee refund sys
tem even exists."

"We're depending on people's

ignorance to keep the refund lev
els down," he said. "I think that
kind of system is good in Las
Vegas, but not over here." He said
this is why the Tea Party was
started — to inform graduate stu
dents of their rights.
Next spring, Grant said he
will plan a voting drive for grad
uate students. "It will be strict
ly non-partisan, non-political
campaign," he said.
After the program, Grant
added that another idea to
improve the refund process was to
"de-fund" the special fees rather
than refund them. Under this
type of system, students who do
not want to support certain orga
nizations could then redistribute
their fees to other groups.
