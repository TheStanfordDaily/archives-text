# Drug-test policy may change
## Ruling in NCAA case could lead to stricter stance 
### Nicolas Kuritzky Staff writer 
In light of an impending decision in the
NCAA vs. Stanford drug-testing case, Ath
letic Director Ted Leland held a question
and answer session last night to discuss
possible changes in the University's drug
testing policy.
During the forum, Iceland said he would
like to see a definitive resolution to the case
before he incorporates input from athletes
and other members of the community into

a new policy.
In early November, the California
Supreme Court will review the suit,
brought in 198 ft by two Stanford athletes
who contested the 198H NCAA drug-test
ing policy.
The case, which has since been taken
over by Stanford and the American Civil
Liberties Union, charged that the NCAA
policy violated the California Right to Pri
vacy Act.
Stanford objected to the
NCAA's questioning of students
about the use of birth control
pills and its failure to specify
which substances are banned.
The University also charged that
the NCAA did not provide recall
measures in the case of a mistake
and unnecessarily monitored
urine tests.
During his presentation,
Leland emphasized that "Stan
ford is not opposed to all drug
testing. We are objecting to the
NCAA program as instituted in
1986."
Most of the NCAA policies
that Stanford objected to in 1986
have been changed, he said, but
the University is still under a
court injunction not to test any of
its athletes, making it the only
university that does not conform
to NCAA drug-testing standards.
Whatever the outcome of the
ruling, Leland stressed that Stan
ford has to pursue a "more
aggressive stance fon drug test
ingl to protect the health and
well-being of our students. We
will be ready no matter what the

court ruling is."
Stanford is developing a drug
use education program, said
Leland. "We are still trying to feel
our way through the issue. We are
still getting input from athletes,
coaches and the community."
Leland said he does not relish
being on the cutting edge of this
issue and that "it hasn't helped
our relationship with the
NCAA." The case also presents
public-relations concerns for the
University.
Why then is Stanford pursuing
the case? The California Supreme
Court decision could have far
reaching consequences, Leland
said. The court could offer guide
lines on which types of drug tests
are permitted and extend these
guidelines to cover areas outside
of athletics.
"My hope is that the court will
say, Stanford, we agree with you
[about the 1986 policy], but there
are policies that do not infringe on
privacy," he said. "We want to be
ready to implement these policies."
Reaction from athletes at
Leland's presentation varied. "We
should have drug testing, but as
long as it is voluntary, I will not
get tested." said senior Gary
Stoltz, a cross-country runner.

Senior Stephanie Wien, a

fencer who underwent drug test
ing during the NCAA finals,
described the urine test as "kind
of embarrassing."
Leland noted that, so far,
coaches mostly have been split

along even lines on the issue.
"Everyone in college athletics
has to deal with it." Leland said,
"It is time for Stanford to deal
with it. We have been a little bit
of an ostrich."
