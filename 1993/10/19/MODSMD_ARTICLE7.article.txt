# Drug-test policy may change
## Ruling in NCAA case could lead to stricter stance 
### Nicolas Kuritzky Staff writer 
In light of an impending decision in the
NCAA vs. Stanford drug-testing case, Ath
letic Director Ted Leland held a question
and answer session last night to discuss
possible changes in the University's drug
testing policy.
During the forum, Iceland said he would
like to see a definitive resolution to the case
before he incorporates input from athletes
and other members of the community into

a new policy.
In early November, the California
Supreme Court will review the suit,
brought in 198 ft by two Stanford athletes
who contested the 198H NCAA drug-test
ing policy.
The case, which has since been taken
over by Stanford and the American Civil
Liberties Union, charged that the NCAA
policy violated the California Right to Pri
vacy Act.
