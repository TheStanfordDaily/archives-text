## On-campus store attracts thrifty customers 
### Jin W. Jung 
Combining the accessibility of
the Bookstore with the low prices
of a large office-supply warehouse,
the University-operated Bonair
Convenience Store has built up a
steady following of thrifty shop
pers since its opening last January.
Although Bonair is on campus,
the store is easy to miss in its incon
spicuous warehouse at 330 Siding
Rd., next to Maples Pavilion. "Peo
ple don't know we're here. When
they do know, they have trouble
locating us," said Jane Williams,
marketing and customer service
manager for Central Stores,
Bonair's parent organization.
Currently, Bonair serves 100 to
125 customers a day, according to
Williams. "We would like to see that
number increase to 500," she said.
"Actually business is doing rather
well, almost twice the expected
level, but we want to do better."
The goal of the store, which
offers near-wholesale prices on
computer and office supplies, is to
be a service to the Stanford com
munity — not to make a profit,

Williams said.
In fact, if Bonair makes more
than a 5 percent profit, its man
agers must lower prices. But since
its grand opening, the store has
never exceeded the 5 percent ceil
ing. "Right now we're hovering

around 0 |percent)," Williams said.
The Procurement Department
had been considering creating the
new store for some time, and
decided to go through with it upon
hearing complaints about the
Bookstore's prices, Williams said.
"We like to call ourselves the
Price Club of the campus," she said.
But he added, "We are not in
competition with the Bookstore —
we complement it." For example,

instead of selling Macintosh com
puters, managers at Bonair have
decided to sell IBM clone brands
DELL and Adisys.
Before the opening of Bonair,
most students had to trek off cam
pus to buy office supplies at a place
other than the Bookstore. "Stu
dents can't afford to spend time
running around. They have much
more important things to do," said
Frank Reisinger, customer service
representative.
"Rather than standing in a line
at another store, you spend your
time more efficiently," said Julia
Logan, a marketing coordinator
for Stanford Publication Services.
Last summer, Bonair managers
made an extensive effort to increase
student awareness of the store by
sending fliers to 12,000 students.
More recently, they have advertised
in various campus publications.
But the best advertisement
may come from the customers
themselves. "A lot of people come
into the store surprised. They say
that they have to tell their friends
about us," said Sharmi Mani, a
clerk at Bonair.
