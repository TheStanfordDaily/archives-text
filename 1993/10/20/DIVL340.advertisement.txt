Help Apple Computer Launch
Its Newton™ Message Pad™
If you're a student who wants to learn more about Apple's Newton Message Pad
and demonstrate it one-on-one to customers during November and December,
this job is for you! Qualified students will be invited to join us in a full-day
Newton training session this coming weekend. Applicants need to:
- Be upperclass or graduate students
- Work 14-20 hours per week evenings and
weekends through December 24
- Have a car to drive to demonstration locations
- Be comfortable with people and computers
You'll earn an excellent student salary plus a bonus at the end of the program. You'll also
receive discounts toward buying your own Newton Message Pad, and there's potential for
additional part-time work next year. During this campaign you will be representing
Apple Computer and the Newton Message Pad; however, you will be employed by
American Passage, so please call American Passage at (800) 487-2434, ext. 8412
before Friday, October 22nd to see if you qualify.
