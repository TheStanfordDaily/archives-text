## President orders Army Rangers to withdraw from Somalia 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” In a further step back
from armed confrontation with Mohamed Farrah
Aidid, President Clinton ordered a pullout yesterday
of Army Ranger forces he had sent to Somalia to cap
ture the clan leader.
The move reflected the administration's effort to
shift the focus in Somalia toward pursuing a political
settlement following the deaths of 18 Americans in
the disastrous Ranger raid on Aidid loyalists Oct. 3.
"Right now we are engaging in a political process
to see how we can resolve our mission in Somalia,"
Clinton told reporters at the White House. "So right
now we're in a stand-down position."
At the Pentagon, spokeswoman Kathleen deLaski
said a Ranger task force of about 750 men would be
withdrawn from Somalia "in the next couple of
days." Officials declined to provide a full breakdown,
but the withdrawal apparently includes about 600
members of the 75th Ranger Regiment and about
150 support forces such as members of the 160 th
Special Operations Aviation Regiment.
Sixteen of the 18 Americans who died in the Oct.
3 raid were members of the Ranger task force.
DeLaski said about 6,300 U.S. troops now remain
in Somalia, of which about 2,700 are assigned to the
U.N. command providing support such as logistical
expertise.
Clinton said the time was right to pull out the
Rangers because two Marine Expeditionary Units,
totaling about 3,600 men with helicopters and

armored vehicles, had arrived off the Somali coast
aboard Navy ships. Clinton suggested the Marines
could substitute for the Rangers if necessary,
although deLaski said there were no plans to bring
the Marines ashore, barring an emergency.
Clinton's announcement came two days after the
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Madeleine
Albright, publicly confirmed that U.S. soldiers in
Somalia had stopped trying to capture Aidid. DeLas
ki noted, though, that he remains wanted by the
United Nations for his alleged role in a June attack
in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, in which 24 Pak
istani peacekeepers were killed.
"There is not an active effort to search for mem
bers of the Aidid apparatus," deLaski said.
Clinton sent an initial contingent of 400 Army
Rangers to Mogadishu on Aug. 24 in response to a
series of bloody attacks on Americans for which
Aidid or his loyalists were blamed. Although the
administration did not say so publicly at the time,
the Rangers' mission was to capture the elusive
Aidid.
Defense Secretary Les Aspin has cited the Ranger
deployment in explaining why he denied the requests
of U.S. commanders in Somalia for more armor to
protect American forces. The lack of armor figured in
the outcome of the October Ranger raid, which in
turn led Clinton to announce four days later that he
was beefing up U.S. forces in Somalia while setting a
March 31 date for full withdrawal.

President Clinton ordered the Army Rangers out of Somalia, more than 6,300 other Americans remain in the country.
