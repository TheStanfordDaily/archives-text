## Cancer drugs aid abortion 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Researchers
at UC-San Francisco are testing an abor
tion technique that uses cancer-fighting
drugs to terminate pregnancies.
In a study of 10 women who requested
abortions, seven had uncomplicated mis
carriages after a low dose of a chemother
apy agent called methotrexate followed by
an artificial hormone called misoprostol
that induces uterine contractions.
In the small doses needed to induce
abortion, the two drugs cost only $6 com
pared to the potential $200 price tag for
RU-486, an abortion pill used widely in
Europe but forbidden in the United
States.
The initial tests, which began in Jan
uary, were so successful that the method
has been tested on more than 50 women

now and the university plans to try it on
more than 100.
Results of the test by Dr. Mitchell
Creinin and his partner, Dr. Philip Dar
ney, appear in the October issue of Con
traception, a medical journal.
Methotrexate, a toxic drug that kills
fast-growing cells, destabilizes the uterus
lining. Its side effects can include fetal
death, birth defects, anemia, diarrhea and
damage to lungs, liver and kidneys
although those do not show up with the
low doses used for abortions, Creinin said.
Three days after the methotrexate
shot, patients are given misoprostol, an
artificial version of the hormone
prostaglandin, which causes the uterus to
expel both the lining and the fetus.
Creinin warned women not to try the
method on their own because, "we can't
say with certainty that this is safe."
