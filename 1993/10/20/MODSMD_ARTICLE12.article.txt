WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate
Democrats and Republicans clashed yes
terday over giving Congress a greater say
in President Clinton's ability to use com
bat troops abroad. The White House
fought to halt or soften three different
measures.
"I don't see how you can prospectively
tell the commander in chief what he can
do with armed forces," said Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., in an argument that
crossed party lines.
But efforts to pass the measures con
tinued, fueled in part by congressional
dissatisfaction with the administration's
foreign policymaking.
The White House was negotiating with
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-
Kan., in an effort to modify his amend
ment that would restrict spending for
American forces in Haiti unless Congress
approves.
It was the second time in a week that
the White House found itself fending off a

single senator and his effort to restrict
presidential authority.
week, it was Sen. Robert Byrd, D-
W.Va., and Somalia.
Clinton has said he opposes all three of
the restrictive efforts: the prospective
Dole amendment to the 1994 defense
spending bill, a measure ordering that
American troops in U.N. operations
always be under U.S. command, and a
provision requiring congressional
approval for sending forces to Bosnia.
The Senate spent much of the day
debating the measure that would prohibit
spending defense dollars on any U.N.
operation in which U.S. soldiers were
under the operational command of a for
eign officer.
Sens. Don Nickles, R-Okla., and Thad
Cochran, R-Miss., modified the measure
so it would not apply to NATO forces in
Europe, would not affect troops in South
Korea and would allow the president to
declare an emergency to place troops

under foreign command.
But Democrats and Republicans still
expressed misgivings with the efforts to
restrict presidential authority.
Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, said, "We
ought to say, 'Mr. President, slow down,
slow down. We don't think you've
thought through this.' "
But Nunn also said, "We should say to
ourselves, the Senate of the United
States, 'Slow down, you're about to alter
the balance of power between the presi
dent and the Congress.' "
Republican Sen. Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania said the provisions were
more restrictive than the War Powers res
olution, which Congress passed 20 years
ago over President Nixon's objections.
That resolution requires a president to
get House and Senate approval if U.S.
forces are to remain longer than 90 days
in "situations where imminent involve
ment in hostilities is clearly indicated."
