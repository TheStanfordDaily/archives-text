## Editorial Fair play at parties The
						IFC's compromise on BYOB policy shows a commitment to equity 
### 
IN KINDERGARTEN we all
learn that on the playground it
is necessary to play fair and get
along with our playmates. Here in
Stanford's sandbox, these lessons
prove themselves true, as different
groups try to peacefully coexist
and harmoniously enjoy all the
toys the campus has to offer.
Now, with the Interfraternity
Council's recently handed-down
compromise resolution regarding
the Bring Your Own Beverage poli
cy, the sandbox has become a nicer
place to play.
In response to insurance-compa
ny demands, many fraternities and
sororities on campus have been
given mandates from their nation
al chapters outlawing parties
which feature open containers of
alcohol — including kegs, party
balls and bowls of punch. These
groups would thereby be forced to
throw all-campus parties with
alcohol consumption limited to a
Bring Your Own Beverage basis.
Last spring the Interfraternity
and Intersorority councils met to
discuss the BYOB issue and the
ramifications of such policies. At
that time, several Greek organiza
tions expressed concern over the
iniquities such a stance would cre
ate. Representatives of individual
groups enumerated the difficulties
which would be created by BYOB
restrictions and the inability of
these organizations to compete on
the party scene, as well as during
Rush in Spring.
Last week, the IFC came to an
accord by which open-keg parties
would be featured only on odd
numbered days — allowing for
strictly BYOB parties to flourish
on even-numbered days. Thus
BYOB groups could throw parties
on the corresponding weekend
night and not be crushed by the

competition of the supposedly
more popular open-container par
ties.
The effort to reach an agree
ment to benefit those groups
falling under BYOB constraints is
to be commended, demonstrating a
refreshing degree of unity and
goodwill among Greek organiza
tions. The action of those fraterni
ties which are not obligated to fol
low a BYOB-exclusive-party design
in self-imposing BYOB rules is a
mature gesture of goodwill uphold
ing healthy and fair competition —
as well as a step in the right direc
tion for the community in general.
The work is not over yet, howev
er, and in order to maintain the
spirit of this agreement, fraterni
ties must be sure that parties
which fall on even-numbered days
do not all suddenly become desig
nated as "closed" parties, thereby
allowing the hosts to provide free
flowing alcohol to guests. Such a
reaction would undermine the
IFC's efforts, and be detrimental
to the social atmosphere on cam
pus where fraternity row, often the
most obvious center for activity on
weekend nights, would become an
impenetrable, isolated social
sphere.
Due to the academic aspirations
of many students, another factor
in the equity issue is the possibility
that a majority of students who
only go out one night of the week
end might choose an odd-num
bered night based on the possibili
ty of free alcohol. Students should
be aware that they are participat
ing members in the development of
a fair environment and recognize
that their attendance at fraternity
functions should not be limited to
such superficial concerns if at all
possible.
It is lamentable that such strict
legislation has been handed down
by insurance companies, necessi
tating logistically difficult BYOB
parties. However, the IFC's
response has been part of a process
which — with student body and
fraternity collaboration — can be a
fundamentally positive one.
