## The 						death of written words 
### 
I AM THINKING, now, of turning the
key in my mailbox and finding a let
ter inside, addressed by hand, worn
and stamped with travel. It has been
sent by a friend, or perhaps a lover who
is somewhere many miles away. I might
not open it at first, instead turning it
over in my hands as I walk to someplace
that is quiet and serene, fitting for read
ing half-finished thoughts that will offer
insight into their days and nights, their
life taking shape on the pages before me.
Somehow I am always moved by these
letters, the written words allowing a cer
tain honesty, a kind of light that phone
conversations rarely can. Hanging up
the receiver leaves me only with the
buzz of emptiness that sounds through
the infinite miles of telephone wires. A
letter, however, sends me reeling into
thought, out on a long night drive, an
autumn walk, reflection.
In an age of faxes, cellular phones,
and answering machines, I am worried
by the disappearance of written corre
spondences. In a recent edition of The
New York Observer, columnist Michael
Thomas asked "What should one
answer when a friend asks at what
point in a budding involvement he
should take the leap and put his new
beloved on autodial?" And it does seem
that the progress of today's relation
ships are measured in technological
increments: exchange of telephone num
bers, the first call, a fax at work, choos

ing to leave a message rather than
hanging up, and finally the victory of
making it to autodial. It seems to me
that we are loosing our ability to com
municate through the written word, a
language often far more potent and
beautiful than conversation, and cer
tainly more so than small-talk. What
then, has happened to the Age of Let
ters, pages inked with ideas and details,
stored in cigar boxes, tied in string, to
be found, read and relived years later?
Those times are not so far gone. I
began first thinking about this while
reading Brad Gooch's biography of
Frank O'Hara this summer. O'Hara's
letters alone could have told the story of
his life entirely, and without them many
of his emotions and experiences would
have dissolved unrecorded into Time's
dust. I remember being struck by the
breadth and depth of the letters, by how
they painted a brilliant portrait of the
1950s and 1960s in bold and vivid
strokes. Of course, one can cite countless
writers, artists, politicians or humanitar
ians whose correspondences have been
published in full, or used to recount their
lives in biographies. But I am thinking
not only of those whose great accom
plishments have gone down in our histo
ry books, but also of our grandparents,
our fathers and mothers who could also
pull down a yellowed pile of letters from
a high shelf, pages that tell the story of
their life, of your own. . . .

I am not suggesting that we all should
keep up a "Griffen and Sabine"-like cor
respondence with all distant loved ones
and old friends. But I do know that the
most deep and lasting relationships that
I have had, still have, most often began
with a letter: pages that one of us wrote
because we were somehow moved by the
other, and tried to reach across the
chasms that divide us to share what is
fundamentally similar between usâ€”
poetry, language, motion, movement, a
euphoria of spirit. Perhaps this is
because in a letter one can communicate
things to a stranger that we wouldn't
otherwise have the courage to say. A let
ter sets a tone of honesty, depth of feel
ing, and openness which is hard to
achieve in a friendship that begins in a
room thumping with bass and salted
with sweat and beer. I am not thinking
so much of notes that begin with "Hi,
how are you? I'm fine," but which
instead might begin like this: "This
morning, the dawn broke lightly over the
skies, arching its gold and blue back out
into light." What a brilliant feeling to
realize how much there is left to say.

Nicole Krauss just completed o midterm
and cannot be blamed for not writing
recently.
