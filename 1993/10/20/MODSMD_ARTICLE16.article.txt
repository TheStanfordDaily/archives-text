## Students must remember the purpose of their education 
### 
LAST WEEK, a friend was debating
whether or not to take a class
pass/no credit; instead of assessing
the extent of her interest in the class, she
was more concerned about the "easy A."
Many students here at Stanford pro
ceed to take classes and pursue academic
agendas not for their interests but for
their own records. How often have you
heard "It looks good on my transcript" or
"I need it to get into [insert your favorite
professional or graduate] school?"
A particularly puzzling phenomenon is
the student who complains about long
problem sets, moans endlessly about
papers, shudders at midterms, and
winces at the thought of going to lecture
regularly. These students repeatedly
enroll in classes in which they have abso
lutely no interest but to have it appear on
that red and white sheet with the water
marks.
Perhaps it is the intense academic
competition that we have cultivated
throughout our schooling. Sure, we all
want to do our best, but we must ask our
selves, "For what purpose?"
We can all get a 4.0 if we put in a great
deal of effort, or in some cases, more

effort than our neighbors. But is there an
upper limit to this? We fight for a few
points here and beg for partial credit
there, just so we can break that meta
physical mean and reap the numerical
benefits at our peers' expense. Can we
ever learn to be happy with what we have
done or can do to the best of our ability?
The first set of midterms are just upon
us now, and when we sit down in front of
that looming textbook, we should each
ask ourselves, "Why am I taking this
class?"
We ought to study that which interests
us, not what interests some intangible
benchmark conjured up by academic
paranoia. A premedical candidate who
abhors biology should not be forced to
enroll in the bio core simply because "it
looks good."
Instead, other achievements should
exhibit his or her true interest in the
medical field; it may be anything from
volunteering in a neighborhood hospital
to doing research at a laboratory. We
think it is a tragedy of immense propor
tions that smart, capable Stanford stu
dents should shape their lives by playing
the percentages rather than maximizing

their potential.
What ever happened to education for
the sake of learning rather than the sake
of a few printed numbers and letters? We
realize that those printed numbers and
letters are important out there in the
"real world."
However, we strongly feel that the aca
demic context at Stanford encourages the
pursuit of personal interests as a means
of getting that transcript to "look good."
We must realize that instead of shaping
our choices to fit grade-point-average-ori
ented mindsets, we will certainly get
more out of our $17,775 tuition by taking
classes in which we have a strong inter
est. Perhaps, this way the "easy A"
wouldn't be so hard after all.
Three years ago, the bulletin that
enclosed our Stanford application forms
quoted the then-president of Stanford,
Donald Kennedy:
"The thing to major in is exactly the
thing that you desire the most, exactly
the thing that excites you the most... I
want you to think about that as a truly
liberating thought, because it opens up
opportunities that you may not have con
sidered. It makes it possible to free the

design of your education from some arti
ficial constraints you may have been
putting on it."
It is, indeed, a truly liberating thought
— and a novel challenge.
When we came here as eager frosh,
Stanford posed a question, as well as a
promise.
The question was whether we would
meet the challenge; the promise was that
we would have access to enormous
resources to help us do it. In our years at
Stanford, we have met many who have
responded admirably to the challenge.
Sadly, we have also met many who
haven't: those who sidestep it, those who
deny it exists, those who still play the per
centages, and those who still search for
that "easy A." They continue to subject
their education to artificial constraints.
Will they discover the idea of academic
liberation? On the answer to that ques
tion hangs the fate of thousands of dol
lars in tuition — and thousands of pre
cious, promising lives.
