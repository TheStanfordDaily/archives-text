## Salmonella's invasion technique makes a 'splash' Stanford researchers uncover how bacteria enters stomach 
### Steve Bait 
Nearly 110 years after young
Leland Stanford Jr. died of
typhoid fever, medical
researchers in the university that
bears his name are one step clos
er to understanding how the
microorganism responsible for
this disease enters its target.
Salmonella typhimurium, the
causative agent in typhoid fever,
is actually a rather common bac
terium.
Often found in foods like
chicken and eggs, it can survive
food preparation and long-term
storage to infect unwary diners.
Although effects on the host's
physiology usually appear mild or
nonexistent because the bacteri
um changes due to each host's
unique immune responses,
salmonella invasion can occasion
ally lead to afflictions such as
diarrhea, localized gastroenteri
tis, and, of course, food poison
ing.
Now, however, School of
Medicine Microbiology and
Immunology Prof. Stanley
Falkow and his colleagues are
zeroing in on how salmonella
enters cells, an understanding
which will then aid researchers in
deterring this process.
In particular, Falkow and his
research group are studying how
salmonella drops through the cell
membrane, creating a strange
"splash" of the cell interior.
Using a sophisticated laser
microscope, Carol Francis, a
graduate student in Falkow's lab
oratory, has recently shown that
salmonella evokes a rather vio
lent response in the host cell — a
phenomenon known as "mem
brane ruffling," in which large
splashes from the cell emerge
from the cell surface and engulf

the invading bacterium.
The ruffles, which Falkow
describes as a "splash of cyto
plasm" surrounding the bacteri
um, comprise a method of entry
apparently unique to salmonella
invasion.
A significant hallmark of bac
terial pathogens, which include
salmonella and other disease
causing agents such as yersinia,
which causes bubonic plague, and
shigella, the pest responsible for
dysentery, is their ability to enter
the cells of a host.
Unfortunately for clinical
microbiologists, the methods by
which bacteria attach themselves
to and enter the cells of higher
organisms are extraordinarily
diverse.
It appears that each microbe
species employs its own tactics to
sneak into the host cell and estab
lish residency in the host's body.
Salmonella most commonly
enters the mammalian host at
the Peyer's patches in the small
intestine, the "Achilles heel of the
[gastrointestinal] tract," accord
ing to Falkow.
Nearly 25 years ago, electron
microscopic studies established
that salmonella disrupts the
architecture of brush border cells
along the interior of the intestine,
but Francis' use of higher-resolu
tion techniques has uncovered
the subtle ruffling effect.
Bradley Jones, a postdoctoral
fellow in Falkow's lab, notes,
however, that ruffling is actually
a general phenomenon seen in a
variety of cell types, and that
there are "maybe a hundred or
so" intracellular events — not
just salmonella entry — that
could permit membrane ruffling.
Consequently, any proposed
mechanism for ruffling is quite
complicated.

For instance, a variety of
growth factors can induce ruf
fling. The epidermal growth fac
tor (EGF) protein causes ruffling
when it interacts with its recep
tor at the cell membrane.
It had previously been suspect
ed that salmonella interacts with
the EGF receptor in a similar
fashion.
Francis' data, however,
refutes this connection by
demonstrating that salmonella
can induce ruffling in cells that
lack the EGF receptor.
Jones has found that a protein
called "rac" can induce general
ized membrane ruffling when
injected into a cell.
A mutant form of rac will not
induce ruffling, except when

salmonella is present, which
shows that salmonella might
"borrow" the rac mechanism for
its own benefit.
Despite the continued lack of
an explanation for the ruffling
phenomenon, this new study is
actually a significant step for
ward for both microbiologists and
cell biologists.
In addition to better under
standing salmonella, researchers
for the first time can directly
observe the entry of a bacterial
pathogen into a host cell, provid
ing a sensitive new measurement
of bacterial invasion.
Stephen Smith, professor of
molecular and cellular physiolo
gy, developed the time-lapse
video microscopy used in Francis'

experiments.
This new technique allows
researchers to watch a bacterial
invasion in a live video rather
than in a static photographic
manner common to electron
microscopy. "The 1990s have
brought forward new ways to see
things," Smith explained, "and
our job is to see them better."
Indeed, the visualization tech
nology has also allowed cell biolo
gists to ask new questions about
ruffling. "We don't understand
the mechanics of how cells do
these things," said Timothy
Ryan, a postdoctoral fellow who
worked with Smith and Francis.
But, he added, "Every time you
do an experiment with the best
stuff, you open another door. You

want to push the technology."
For example, does a signal
from salmonella stimulate the
normally quiescent ruffling and
internalization pathways in
intestinal cells? Or is ruffling
caused primarily by the interac
tion of foreign, bacterial factors
with the host cell?
Nobody knows. "We're sort of
at a dead end," Francis remarked,
"until someone explains the ruf
fling pathway."
Stanford researchers continue
to probe the depths of the bowel
for more answers.
Although it's more than a
century too late to save Leland
Jr., a defense against salmonella
may lie ahead with these new
discoveries.
