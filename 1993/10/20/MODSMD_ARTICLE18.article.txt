# Chromosome clones correct missing DNA
## Possible cure for genetic defects 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
Paving the way for a revolution
in the world of genetic engineer
ing, researchers in the School of
Medicine's Genetics Department
are currently working to complete
the first artificial chromosome
using human DNA.
Led by Michele Calos, an asso
ciate professor in the Genetics
Department, the research group
is proposing to form a miniature
version of these chromosomes to
implant into human cells.
They have so far succeeded in
creating a prototype of the chro
mosome and may have a full
fledged artificial chromosome
ready in several years. Their work
could eventually help scientists
find cures to thousands of genetic
diseases.
Human cells contain 23 pairs
of chromosomes, which are store
houses for the long strands of
DNA encoded with instructions to
operate and replicate a cell.
Past efforts to genetically engi
neer life forms have not been very
successful, mostly because they
involved injection of individual
genes and not full chromosomes.
These would not always be incor
porated by the chromosomes of a
cell, and in some cases even led to

mutations.
Any observed gene incorpora
tion appeared to be random and
could not be controlled.
But the artificial chromosome
will have the advantage of being
an autonomous unit which repli
cates alongside the rest of the
chromosomes in a cell and will not
have to be attached to any other
chromosome.
Once the mini-chromosome is
placed in the cell, it is expected to
become operational on its own
and ensure specific pre-coded
results.
In application, these small
chromosomes could act as supple
ments to defective genetic codes
in DNA.
For example, individuals who
carry the gene that causes muscu
lar dystrophy could be cured if
they are given an additional chro
mosome that makes up for the
defective gene and restores it to
its normal function.
Similarly, the 3,000 to 4,000
genetic diseases scientists have so
far tabulated could be wiped out
through these miniature chromo
somes.
If successful, this project could
also lead to numerous artificial
chromosome applications in other
organisms. Plants could be engi
neered for pest- and weather

resistance. And insects could be
inoculated with a new chromo
some that would make it impossi
ble to carry parasites such as
malaria.
Hurdles
The forerunner of the current
chromosome prototype has been a
viral plasmid, which is basically a
circular strand of DNA pieces
gathered from viruses and strung
together.
Calos and her researchers have
succeeded in making the transi
tion from viral to human DNA
and have also been able to propa
gate these plasmids within
human tissue cultures. And while
the researchers are now able to
replicate human DNA, Calos says
there are two significant obstacles
to overcome in order to create a
full artificial chromosome.
Scientists are still trying to

find a way to fit on to the plasmid
a chromosome part that sorts
DNA and ensures that each
newly-forming cell does not have
two of the same DNA strands.
This chromosome part is at least
30 times larger than any plasmid.
Calos' research group is work
ing to counter the large size by
either synthesizing a part 10
times smaller or by using the
analogous part from a yeast cell,
which contains the same part on a
smaller scale, and implanting it
into the human artificial chromo
some.
Despite the setback in sorting
DNA, Calos remains optimistic.
"I think I can achieve it. The
(sorting parti is tough, but it's do
able," she said.
The other problem involves
altering the plasmid's circular

shape to make it more closely
resemble real chromosomes,
which are long, linear chains with
special DNA attachments on both
ends.
Calos' research group is
searching for a method to con
nect these chromosomes' special
DNA attachments to the circu
lar plasmid and then break the
plasmid into a similar linear
chain.
What About Jurassic Park?
The implications of having a
surer way to control genetic fac
tors become evident, Calos said,
when one thinks beyond the
scope of genetic medicine.
Should the day come when
people can eliminate all genetic
diseases, she believes they will
then turn to enhancing what they
already have.
Humans may turn toward the
aesthetic side of genetics, such as
building Miss Americas or the
next Heisman trophy quarter
back.
And what if scientists want to
generate new organisms such as
flying frogs from specially
designed DNA?

According to Calos,
researchers are definitely far
from being able to create an
organism just with genetic
codes.
"All these people see "Juras
sic Park" and say, 'Why don't we
do that?'
"[But the] problem is that
even if we had all the chromo
somes (of a species), we wouldn't
be able to make one because the
chromosomes do nothing by
themselves," she said.
"So I put together a spinal
cord. Now can I make the per
son?"
Even if scientists could pro
duce the DNA that is needed to
make the cells of an organism,
contends Calos, they still would
not know how to activate the pro
cess of starting from scratch and
building proteins into cells, and
cells into the species.
Current research labs embed
DNA in cells drawn from natural
sources because there is no way of
synthesizing the cells and cell
materials.
Calos says she does not antici
pate that scientists will be able to
generate species from scratch
within her lifetime.
Nonetheless, she does not rule
out the possibility, since genetic
engineering is still nascent and
has yet to prove itself.
