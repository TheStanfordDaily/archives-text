# Thinner film magnetics improve info storage

In Silicon Valley, information storage
materials actually generate more revenue
than the silicon the area is named after.
Information storage is a $50 billion
industry, driven by the desire to increase
memory density and reduce cost.
"I remember when a 20 megabyte memo
ry would cost $100,000 and be the size of a
refrigerator," said Materials Science and
Engineering Prof. Emeritus Robert L.
White. "Now it's the size of a small cigarette
pack."
The Stanford Center for Research on
Information Storage Materials is developing
ways to increase that capacity even more,
according to White.
"With current technology, a factor of two,
four, or maybe eight improvement is possi
ble," White said, "but at Stanford we're try
ing to leapfrog it altogether."
White founded the center in 1991 to fill a
need for long-term research in the area of
information storage. While housed in the
Department of Materials Science and Engi
neering, the center represents a collabora
tion between researchers in Electrical Engi

neering, Applied Physics and the industry
as well.
Research at Stanford is focused on
improving magnetic thin-film materials
used in computer disks and on recording
heads.
Thin-film materials used in computer
disks today consist of tiny pillars of chromi
um topped with small particles of magnetic
compounds.
These particles are over 100 times small
er than previously achieved, allowing more
particles to be placed in the same amount of
space.
Currently, about 2,000 angstroms of
space is needed to store one bit of informa
tion.
A magnetic read-write head codes bits
onto a disk by polarizing a portion of the
material according to whether the bit is a
binary zero or one. Each portion contains
about 1,000 to 10,000 magnetic particles.
A lot of particles are needed to minimize
the amount of noise inherent in the process.
In this case, more magnetic particles give a
better representation of a zero or a one.
One of the projects being undertaken by
White and Electrical Engineering Prof. R.

Fabian W. Pease is aimed at reducing this
noise while also reducing the amount of
space for each bit.
Using lithographic techniques, they are
attempting to carve out islands of magnetic
metal — "like cookies on a cookie sheet" —
with a diameter of 500 angstroms, one
fourth of the present space needed, White
said.
A single bit could be stored on each of
these islands. The ability to make these
islands the same size and to space them reg
ularly would reduce the noise.
"The ultimate size of these islands is very
small compared to what is usually done with
lithography, so the difficulty lies in that,"
White said.
Other thin-film research at Stanford is
aimed at improving the other component of
the recording process: the recording head.
The recording head itself is made of a
thin film of "permalloy," a combination of
nickel and iron.
In the past, recording heads were made of
blocks of iron with a gap corresponding to
the size of the bit to be encoded.
But when the space required for
each bit became very small, it
became impractical to make an iron
recording head with an equally
small gap.
However, depositing a head of
thin film allows the possibility of
laying down information in tinier

spaces.
The new materials being stud
ied at Stanford for these thin
film recording heads are formed
by alternating layers of magnetic
materials such as cobalt, and
nonmagnetic ones such as cop
per.
Computer hard drive read-write
heads made of these materials
would be more sensitive to magnet
ic fields, allowing information to be
stored in less space.
