# Experts question U.S. role in Somalia
## Africa scholars say ignorance, mistakes behind problem 
### Josh Green Jut hymns Harntha Staff writers 
In the wake of a turnaround in U.S.
policy in Somalia this weekend, Stanford
scholars on Africa say poor planning and
a narrow focus on military goals were
among the problems that contributed to
the apparent failure of U.S. participation
in the U.N. relief mission.
Larry Diamond, a senior research fel
low at the Hoover Institution and co-edi
tor of the Journal of Democracy in Wash
ington, D.C., said he believes that igno
rance about Somalia resulted in the de
bacle of American intervention.
"One of the reasons we've gotten peo
ple killed in Somalia is that we had not

been conscientious enough about con
sulting the experts before we went in
there," Diamond said.
The other problem, according to Po
litical Science Prof. David Abernethy, is
that the United States and the United
Nations have focused too much on mili
tary goals, rather than on working to
resolve the political chaos in the coun
try.
"The military mission became an end
unto itself rather than a means to the
diplomatic solution of setting Somalia up
as a state," Abernethy said. "[The United
Nations] needs to negotiate an African
solution to an African problem."
He said the presence of U.S. special
envoy Robert Oakley in Somalia is an in
dicator that the United Nations may be

heading in the direction of an internal so
lution.
But despite current attempts to ex
tract itself from Somalia, the United
States is unlikely to discover a face-sav
ing way out of the problem, said Hoover
Senior Fellow Tom Henriksen, a special
ist on Africa.
"We're back to looking for a politi
cal solution so that we can get out
without embarrassment," Henriksen
said. "Since we did so many things
wrong in the beginning, whatever we
do now is going to look like we're just
trying to find a way out or like we've
made a deal with (warlord Mohamed
Farrahl Aidid.
"The [United Statesl could
solve the problems if we were
willing to spend years and years
and lots of money there," he
said.
The targeting of Aidid as a
wanted man helped erase this
possibility of a political solution,
Diamond said, adding that he
supports President Clinton's
recent efforts to stop focusing on
the renegade warlord.
"We need to de-polarize and
de-personalize this issue," Dia
mond said. "We may not have
the will or the wallet to pacify all
of Somalia, but we may be
able to contain another out
break of violence in southern
Mogadishu."
Diamond stressed that "unsa
vory characters" like Aidid have
to be accepted in an undemocrat
ic country such as Somalia. The
main objective should be to keep
Aidid and others like him from
using food and starvation as a
political tool, he said.
But Diamond still thinks that
the United States initially made
the right decision when it sent
troops to Somalia.
"We saved at least a quarter of
a million lives by going in," Dia
mond said. "It is unlikely that
any other alternative action
would have caused such a rapid
and dramatic effect."
Hoover Senior Fellow Lewis
Gann, an African specialist and

scholar of modern European his
tory, however, argues against
intervention in any form.
He said the basic misunder
standing in Somalia is the pre
supposition that armies and
police are alike.
"Armies fight a defined enemy
and are meant to destroy him.
Police are made to bring crimi
nals to the proper institutions,"
Gann said. "Armies are unfit to
act as police forces. They don't
know the country they're in, they
don't know the language, some
times they even lack inter
preters."
Gann said that anything short
of a colonial administration set
up by Americans in Somalia will
not bring peace, and "Western
colonialism is over."
"People will have to solve
their own problems," Gann said.
"We cannot intervene every time
a democracy is threatened or
innocent people are being
killed."
Gann pointed out that other
places where democracy is falling
apart and human rights viola
tions occur with regularity — the
Sudan, Tibet and Burma, for
example — go virtually unno
ticed.
He blamed television images
for the American public's willing
ness to commit troops to certain
areas of the world.
"We walk in when we see a
child starving, then we walk out
when we see an American soldier
being dragged through the
streets of a foreign country,"
Gann said. "That's not the way to
conduct foreign policy."

innocent people are being
killed."
Gann pointed out that other
places where democracy is falling
apart and human rights viola
tions occur with regularity — the
Sudan, Tibet and Burma, for
example — go virtually unno
ticed.
He blamed television images
for the American public's willing
ness to commit troops to certain
areas of the world.

child starving, then we walk out

Gann said. "That's not the way to
conduct foreign policy."
In the wake of a turnaround in U.S.
policy in Somalia this weekend, Stanford
scholars on Africa say poor planning and
a narrow focus on military goals were
among the problems that contributed to
the apparent failure of U.S. participation
in the U.N. relief mission.
Larry Diamond, a senior research fel
low at the Hoover Institution and co-edi
tor of the Journal of Democracy in Wash
ington, D.C., said he believes that igno
rance about Somalia resulted in the de
bacle of American intervention.
"One of the reasons we've gotten peo
ple killed in Somalia is that we had not

been conscientious enough about con
sulting the experts before we went in
there," Diamond said.
The other problem, according to Po
litical Science Prof. David Abernethy, is
that the United States and the United
Nations have focused too much on mili
tary goals, rather than on working to
resolve the political chaos in the coun
try.
"The military mission became an end
unto itself rather than a means to the
diplomatic solution of setting Somalia up
as a state," Abernethy said. "[The United
Nations] needs to negotiate an African
solution to an African problem."
He said the presence of U.S. special
envoy Robert Oakley in Somalia is an in
dicator that the United Nations may be

heading in the direction of an internal so
lution.
But despite current attempts to ex
tract itself from Somalia, the United
States is unlikely to discover a face-sav
ing way out of the problem, said Hoover
Senior Fellow Tom Henriksen, a special
ist on Africa.
"We're back to looking for a politi
cal solution so that we can get out
without embarrassment," Henriksen
said. "Since we did so many things
wrong in the beginning, whatever we
do now is going to look like we're just
trying to find a way out or like we've
made a deal with (warlord Mohamed
Farrahl Aidid.
"The [United Statesl could
solve the problems if we were
willing to spend years and years
and lots of money there," he
said.
The targeting of Aidid as a
wanted man helped erase this
possibility of a political solution,
Diamond said, adding that he
supports President Clinton's
recent efforts to stop focusing on
the renegade warlord.
"We need to de-polarize and
de-personalize this issue," Dia
mond said. "We may not have
the will or the wallet to pacify all
of Somalia, but we may be
able to contain another out
break of violence in southern
Mogadishu."
Diamond stressed that "unsa
vory characters" like Aidid have
to be accepted in an undemocrat
ic country such as Somalia. The
main objective should be to keep
Aidid and others like him from
using food and starvation as a
political tool, he said.
But Diamond still thinks that
the United States initially made
the right decision when it sent
troops to Somalia.
"We saved at least a quarter of
a million lives by going in," Dia
mond said. "It is unlikely that
any other alternative action
would have caused such a rapid
and dramatic effect."
Hoover Senior Fellow Lewis
Gann, an African specialist and

scholar of modern European his
tory, however, argues against
intervention in any form.
He said the basic misunder
standing in Somalia is the pre
supposition that armies and
police are alike.
"Armies fight a defined enemy
and are meant to destroy him.
Police are made to bring crimi
nals to the proper institutions,"
Gann said. "Armies are unfit to
act as police forces. They don't
know the country they're in, they
don't know the language, some
times they even lack inter
preters."
Gann said that anything short
of a colonial administration set
up by Americans in Somalia will
not bring peace, and "Western
colonialism is over."
"People will have to solve
their own problems," Gann said.
"We cannot intervene every time
a democracy is threatened or
innocent people are being
killed."
Gann pointed out that other
places where democracy is falling
apart and human rights viola
tions occur with regularity — the
Sudan, Tibet and Burma, for
example — go virtually unno
ticed.
He blamed television images
for the American public's willing
ness to commit troops to certain
areas of the world.
"We walk in when we see a
child starving, then we walk out
when we see an American soldier
being dragged through the
streets of a foreign country,"
Gann said. "That's not the way to
conduct foreign policy."
