In the wake of a turnaround in U.S.
policy in Somalia this weekend, Stanford
scholars on Africa say poor planning and
a narrow focus on military goals were
among the problems that contributed to
the apparent failure of U.S. participation
in the U.N. relief mission.
Larry Diamond, a senior research fel
low at the Hoover Institution and co-edi
tor of the Journal of Democracy in Wash

bacle of American intervention.
"One of the reasons we've gotten peo

"The military mission became an end
unto itself rather than a means to the
diplomatic solution of setting Somalia up

solution to an African problem."
He said the presence of U.S. special
envoy Robert Oakley in Somalia is an in

heading in the direction of an internal so
lution.
But despite current attempts to ex
tract itself from Somalia, the United
States is unlikely to discover a face-sav

Senior Fellow Tom Henriksen, a special
ist on Africa.
"We're back to looking for a politi
cal solution so that we can get out
without embarrassment," Henriksen
said. "Since we did so many things
wrong in the beginning, whatever we
do now is going to look like we're just
trying to find a way out or like we've
made a deal with (warlord Mohamed
