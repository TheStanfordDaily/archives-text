# Puff equals cancer? Bug clears smoke
## 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
Q: So, the Surgeon General
has been telling me for
years that cigarettes are going
to give me cancer. I guess I
believe this, but 1 don't really
understand why. So, why?
— Mr. Butts

A:There are a good many
people in the Depart
ment of Biological Sciences and
the School of Medicine who will
get all cranky at me for trying
to answer this question in a
simple — they will say "sim
plistic" — manner.
But never fear, trusting read
er. I can deal with that risk.
The wiles of cancer are, in
many cases, poorly understood.
For every cause and effect I
describe below, there are count
less alternative routes between
steps — innumerate twisted
paths, from high-risk behavior to
low life expectancy.
Caveats aside, let's talk about
why my mother was right when
she told me not to smoke. Wait,
leave my mother out of this. I jet's
talk about your mother.
She might have warned you
about the "tar" in cigarette
smoke — magazine articles and
billboards alike impute to adver
tise the brand of lungenbrotchen
("lung biscuits," a delightful bit
of German slang) with the lowest
tar. However, knowing your
mother, she probably didn't
explain what tar is.
Tar is a mix of hydrocarbon
compounds found in cigarette
smoke. Some are chemicals that
the tobacco plant develope to
make itself unpleasant to eat;
others are reactive byproducts of
the burning of the tobacco leaf.
Most, if not all, of these com
pounds are bad for you. Many of
them can damage DNA, the
genetic material found in all the
cells in your body.
Most of us know that DNA
allows genes to be inherited by
children from their parents, but
it's not just for breakfast any
more. Genes can be thought of as
directions about how to perform
the everyday chores of cellular
survival. Nonreproductive cells
are constantly "reading" their
DNA for such instructions.
When DNA is damaged, infor
mation in genes is oflen disrupt

ed. Cells can correct much of this
damage, but when it persists for
one reason or another — say,
because an individual voluntarily
inhales huge quantities of geno
toxins and the DNA repair sys
tems in the lungs can't get rid of
all the lesions — mutations (per
manent changes in the genetic
content of a cell) can result.
If a mutation permanently
activates a gene that is usually
only turned on when the ceil
should be dividing (an oncogene),
or inactivates a gene that tells the
cell not to divide when it
shouldn't (a tumor suppressor
gene), the cell will forever believe
that it's time to grow and divide.
And it will divide . . . and
divide ... and divide. Soon, Dar
winian selection kicks in: Cells
which divide faster will have an
advantage over slower cells, and
will take over the local popula
tion. As the original slowly divid
ing, singly mutated cells are
replaced by multiply mutated,
uncontrollably proliferating,
invasive, and generally mean and
nasty cells, the little benign lump
that you started with becomes a
life-threatening cancer.
The take-home lesson, as a
shaggy professor of mine once
put it, is that it can all start with
a single puff that results in a sin
gle genotoxic chemical reacting
with a single DNA molecule in a
single cell.
One corollary is that no
threshold quantity of cigarette
smoking is "safe": Although it is
statistically unlikely, it is possible
to develop cancer from smoking a
single cigarette. Everv lung-bis
cuit you suck down is a risk to
your health and life.
Damn, that's depressing.
Man, I need a ...
