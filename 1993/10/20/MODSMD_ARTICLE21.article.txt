## Men's soccer trying to look past shaky first half Booters get confidence boost after 1-0 win over Huskies 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
It's been said that the status of
a sports team is much like that of
Bill Clinton's popularity — in a
state of constant flux.
But please do not tell that to
the Stanford men's soccer squad.
After three consecutive years of
post-season play and a highly
respected reputation as a menac
ing force in college soccer, the fact
that this has been a so-called
'rebuilding' season is a tough pill
for the Cardinal to swallow.
"We didn't expect the team
that we've had in the previous
two years," said coach Colin Lin
dores. "But I'm disappointed. The
players are disappointed. We all
thought that we would have done
better."
In Lindores' fourth season
with the team, Stanford has mus
tered a mediocre 4-8-1 record in
the midst of transition and incon
sistent play. In the previous three
years of Lindores' tenure, the
Cardinal was 32-18-13, including
last year's impressive 11-8-2
mark. But the core of that team
has vanished from Maloney Field,
and the difficult job of filling the
voids has taken its toll on the
squad.
"Losing that many players in
one year was a difficult thing to
get over," Lindores said. "They
were the heart and soul of our
team, the maturity and experi
ence."
Graduation took away Stan
ford's two leading point scorers
and starting goalkeeper from last
season. Keeper Kyle Krpata main
tained a 1.08 goals-per-game aver
age last year, and the lack of an
experienced replacement to take

his spot has weakened the Cardi
nal's once impenetrable defense.
"We had a big turnover in per
sonnel in our back," said senior
forward Ricky Goad. "We lost 75
percent of our players back there,
and the guys we put in their place
initially just couldn't do the job."
In addition, the absence of
Jason Vanacour and Lance Kil
lian, who together scored 16 of
the Cardinal's 40 goals and over
one-third of the team's total
points last year, has forced the
younger Stanford players to step
up and fill the tremendous offen
sive hole that remained.
"Not everyone knew their
niche on this team," said Goad,
who has led the Cardinal this sea
son with nine goals and 20 points.
"With a lot of new people thrown
together like that, it takes a while
to figure out what we're going to
do on the field."
As the season commenced, that
hesitant situation was evident in
the Cardinal's play. After starting
the year 1-0-1, Stanford lost five
games in a row and dropped eight
of nine contests before recording
their first two-game winning
streak last weekend.
"There was quite a bit of
doubt," Goad said. "Guys just
didn't want to believe in them
selves."
This year's Cardinal team con
sists of only four seniors and five
juniors. The seven sophomores
and seven freshmen make up the
majority of the squad, leaving the
older guys with heavy loads of
leadership to bear.
"Our team last year had lead
ership," said junior midfielder
Ryan Collins. "It was a lot easier
for freshmen to fit into an estab
lished system."

But the lack of experience may
have been only a slice of this
year's bitter pie. Some returning
players have seen their numbers
drop from previous years, due in
part to the Unsettled status of the
1993 squad.
"In the beginning [of this sea
son, the team's problemsl could
have been contributed to youth,"
said junior Jeff Kogl. "But some
older guys didn't step up."
However, talent and a drive to
succeed were not what the Cardi
nal lacked this season. Their
problem was almost a logistical
one, a result of the shuffling of
positions and the inability for
each player to play his role in the
squad's production.
"We brought in a good bunch
of frosh to fill spots, but the play
ers that were left didn't always
take their positions," Lindores
said. "One never knows how a
player's going to react in a posi
tion of leadership until he's
placed in it."
Not to say that the absence of a
great record has torn the team
apart. The unity of the group still
exists, and the athletes have dealt
with the blows as a unified group.
"This group has been as tightly
knit as any team in the past,"
Kogl said. "But it's been really
frustrating to see the potential
that we haven't tapped into.
Every game and practice has been
a challenge, and off the field has
been a lot more difficult to handle
than in the past."
Dealing with the mounting
losses has hit the players hard.
For the older athletes on the team
this season has been a cold, hard
slap in the face. Never before (at
least in the college scene) have
they been forced to take so many

large doses of stark reality.
If there is a silver lining on this
particular cloud, the future out
look of the team is a definite
source of hope. The down year
provides an opportunity for the
squad to build for next season and
give younger players much need
ed playing experience.
"You always are positive about
Ithe future]," Lindores said. "Our

younger players have learned a
lot. That really benefits us for
next year."
But the tale does not necessar
ily end on a sour note. While this
season has been full of frustra
tions, the team's gradual im
provement reached a new peak
last weekend when Stanford beat
defending conference champion
Washington and shut out Oregon

State, moving the squad's record
to 2-2 in the league.
"Before this weekend I was not
looking forward to next year,"
Collins said. "But the way we
played fat Washington] — we
have the ability, and we've shown
that we can play differently. We
might go back to the way we were
[earlier this season), but there's
hope."

a sports team is much like that of
Bill Clinton's popularity — in a
state of constant flux.
But please do not tell that to
the Stanford men's soccer squad.
After three consecutive years of
post-season play and a highly
respected reputation as a menac
ing force in college soccer, the fact
that this has been a so-called
'rebuilding' season is a tough pill
for the Cardinal to swallow.
"We didn't expect the team
that we've had in the previous
two years," said coach Colin Lin
dores. "But I'm disappointed. The
players are disappointed. We all
thought that we would have done
better."
In Lindores' fourth season
with the team, Stanford has mus
tered a mediocre 4-8-1 record in
the midst of transition and incon
sistent play. In the previous three
years of Lindores' tenure, the
Cardinal was 32-18-13, including
last year's impressive 11-8-2
mark. But the core of that team
has vanished from Maloney Field,
and the difficult job of filling the
voids has taken its toll on the
squad.
"Losing that many players in
one year was a difficult thing to
get over," Lindores said. "They
were the heart and soul of our
team, the maturity and experi
ence."
Graduation took away Stan
ford's two leading point scorers
and starting goalkeeper from last
season. Keeper Kyle Krpata main
tained a 1.08 goals-per-game aver
age last year, and the lack of an
experienced replacement to take

his spot has weakened the Cardi
nal's once impenetrable defense.
"We had a big turnover in per
sonnel in our back," said senior
forward Ricky Goad. "We lost 75
percent of our players back there,
and the guys we put in their place
initially just couldn't do the job."
In addition, the absence of
Jason Vanacour and Lance Kil
lian, who together scored 16 of
the Cardinal's 40 goals and over
one-third of the team's total
points last year, has forced the
younger Stanford players to step
up and fill the tremendous offen
sive hole that remained.
"Not everyone knew their
niche on this team," said Goad,
who has led the Cardinal this sea
son with nine goals and 20 points.
"With a lot of new people thrown
together like that, it takes a while
to figure out what we're going to
do on the field."
As the season commenced, that
hesitant situation was evident in
the Cardinal's play. After starting
the year 1-0-1, Stanford lost five
games in a row and dropped eight
of nine contests before recording
their first two-game winning
streak last weekend.
"There was quite a bit of
doubt," Goad said. "Guys just
didn't want to believe in them
selves."
This year's Cardinal team con
sists of only four seniors and five
juniors. The seven sophomores
and seven freshmen make up the
majority of the squad, leaving the
older guys with heavy loads of
leadership to bear.
"Our team last year had lead
ership," said junior midfielder
Ryan Collins. "It was a lot easier
for freshmen to fit into an estab
lished system."

But the lack of experience may
have been only a slice of this
year's bitter pie. Some returning
players have seen their numbers
drop from previous years, due in
part to the Unsettled status of the
1993 squad.
"In the beginning [of this sea
son, the team's problemsl could
have been contributed to youth,"
said junior Jeff Kogl. "But some
older guys didn't step up."
However, talent and a drive to
succeed were not what the Cardi
nal lacked this season. Their
problem was almost a logistical
one, a result of the shuffling of
positions and the inability for
each player to play his role in the
squad's production.
"We brought in a good bunch
of frosh to fill spots, but the play
ers that were left didn't always
take their positions," Lindores
said. "One never knows how a
player's going to react in a posi
tion of leadership until he's
placed in it."
Not to say that the absence of a
great record has torn the team
apart. The unity of the group still
exists, and the athletes have dealt
with the blows as a unified group.
"This group has been as tightly
knit as any team in the past,"
Kogl said. "But it's been really
frustrating to see the potential
that we haven't tapped into.
Every game and practice has been
a challenge, and off the field has
been a lot more difficult to handle
than in the past."
Dealing with the mounting
losses has hit the players hard.
For the older athletes on the team
this season has been a cold, hard
slap in the face. Never before (at
least in the college scene) have
they been forced to take so many

large doses of stark reality.
If there is a silver lining on this
particular cloud, the future out
look of the team is a definite
source of hope. The down year
provides an opportunity for the
squad to build for next season and
give younger players much need
ed playing experience.
"You always are positive about
Ithe future]," Lindores said. "Our

younger players have learned a
lot. That really benefits us for
next year."
But the tale does not necessar
ily end on a sour note. While this
season has been full of frustra
tions, the team's gradual im
provement reached a new peak
last weekend when Stanford beat
defending conference champion
Washington and shut out Oregon

State, moving the squad's record
to 2-2 in the league.
"Before this weekend I was not
looking forward to next year,"
Collins said. "But the way we
played fat Washington] — we
have the ability, and we've shown
that we can play differently. We
might go back to the way we were
[earlier this season), but there's
hope."
