# Only the few, the proud: IM refs are a rare breed
## 
### Allyson Mizoguchi 
The job description of the Stanford
intramural referees should look something
like this:
1. Must be willing to get on one's hands
and knees to pry apart huge, sweaty bodies
engaged in physical violence.
2. Must absorb or ignore countless
degrading and nasty remarks about one's
ability as a ref, one's capabilities as a
human in general and one's mother.
3. Must love sports.
Applicants probably didn't bargain on
the first two elements of the job, but unfor
tunately it's a package deal.
And so the 37 officials who constitute
this quarter's refereeing squad work for
the love of sports, for the love of the game.
As third-year referee Dave Delia Lana put
it, "It's the opportunity to be in the World
Series in the bottom of the ninth with two
outs, and you have to make the call."
For Gabe Lucas, also a three-year veter
an, officiating was somewhat of a fantasy
growing up. "As a kid, I always watched the
refs on TV during the games . .. even for
Halloween I was a ref."
The referees are an important part of
the Intramural Athletics Department, an
organization which schedules and juggles
25 sports — from basketball to softball to

soccer — to best cater to the athletic
desires of approximately 2,000 Stanford
students per quarter. In fact, refereeing is
such an integral part of the department
that all staff members either currently offi
ciate or have done so in the past.
But these members see don't see refer
eeing as a chore. Besides being fun and
challenging, it's a chance to "run round, get
some exercise, be outside," said Delia Lana.
Sarah Bacon, who has refereed for two
years, agreed, stating that "it's always
exciting ... and you meet a lot of cool peo
ple doing it."
It takes more than an idealistic vision to
be a good referee, though. And it certainly
demands more than just running around
dressed in stripes. In a competitive environ
ment like Stanford, an official must have
inner toughness and personal integrity.
Lucas went so far as to say that reffing is
a "talent, an art," that one develops with
experience. Bacon, the only female on staff
this quarter, said, "Some people are cut out
for it; some are not."
All refs cite confidence as an integral
quality of officiating. "Having confidence
in yourself carries over into the players,"
said Kevin JefTery, the student director of
IMs. Jeffery stated that a sense of humor is
important too. "If you start to take things
seriously, it's all over."
What sort of things does JefTery refer to?
Try harassment, name-calling and ref
knocking. Stiff competition. It's the way of
intramural sports.
Basketball, the refs agree, is particularly
intense. "It's a lot of pressure," said Delia
Lana. "You're forced to give a quick,
assertive reason why you blew the whistle."
"You don't have time to second-guess
yourself. There's ten sweaty bodies, every
one's agitated, and you've got to make
instantaneous calls," added JefTery.
Making fast calls is the true test of confi
dence. And when those calls are questioned,
the initiation rites begin.
Although none of the refs have actually
been physically assaulted, there have been
hints of physical abuse, according to Delia
Lana. Afier reffing a close basketball game
his freshman year, he was cornered and
players threatened to beat him up.
JefTery, in a similar incident during his
freshman year, said players "wanted to rip
my head off!"
Although administering disciplinary
action, such as warnings or suspensions, is
one way to deal with misconduct, the refs
view it as "less of a punitive thing. . . .
We're trying to preserve the atmosphere of
fun," said Delia Lana.
"We're looking more to be pacifiers than
enforcers," JefTery stated. And often, both
JefTery and Bacon recalled, players who
were derogatory during the game would
apologize afterward, or commend them on
a well-officiated game. Said JefTery: "I
think people do respect the refs, and appre-

date the job we're doing."
The unmistakable competition
that often makes officiating stress
ful is something they accept. "It's a
function of our school," said Delia
Lana. "We've got two kinds of play
ers out there: those playing for fun
and those trying to recapture their
high-school glory days."
Bacon stated that, with basket
ball especially, "It's totally male
dominated . . . and they're so
intense."
Although all officials face this
intensity, being a woman makes
things different. "If I make a bad
call, I immediately lose respect . ..
guys will not give me any leeway."
she said. However, she says that
being a basketball player herself
gives her confidence.
Bacon further believes that if
players saw more female refs, they
would question her less. But being
a novelty, she is challenged and
must stand her ground. "You have

to stick with it," she said.
In hopes of balancing out the
male/female discrepancy, Sherry
Posthumus, director of Intramu
rals, hopes to recruit and prepare
more female refs. In part, this end
will be served by a one-unit class to
be offered next fall through the
Intramural Department. Posthu
mus believes that the course,
which will teach regulations and
technique, will establish a strong
base for staff, as well as entice oth
ers who may be reluctant to join.
Lucas mentioned that making
the staff more diverse would "pre
vent a lot of [unnecessary! things
from happening." In addition,
Bacon said there is a "constant
need" for refs, suggesting that not
only more diversity, but a larger
staff, would help the department.
Clearly, being a ref is not all fun
and glory. "Sometimes I ask
myself, 'Is this worth $6.50 an
hour, when I could be working
behind a desk somewhere?'" Bacon
said. But the positive aspects of the
job are enough to keep them com
ing back according to Bacon. "You
learn a lot about yourself."

intramural referees should look something
like this:
1. Must be willing to get on one's hands
and knees to pry apart huge, sweaty bodies
engaged in physical violence.
2. Must absorb or ignore countless
degrading and nasty remarks about one's
ability as a ref, one's capabilities as a
human in general and one's mother.
3. Must love sports.
Applicants probably didn't bargain on
the first two elements of the job, but unfor
tunately it's a package deal.
And so the 37 officials who constitute
this quarter's refereeing squad work for
the love of sports, for the love of the game.
As third-year referee Dave Delia Lana put
it, "It's the opportunity to be in the World
Series in the bottom of the ninth with two
outs, and you have to make the call."
For Gabe Lucas, also a three-year veter
an, officiating was somewhat of a fantasy
growing up. "As a kid, I always watched the
refs on TV during the games . .. even for
Halloween I was a ref."
The referees are an important part of
the Intramural Athletics Department, an
organization which schedules and juggles
25 sports — from basketball to softball to

soccer — to best cater to the athletic
desires of approximately 2,000 Stanford
students per quarter. In fact, refereeing is
such an integral part of the department
that all staff members either currently offi
ciate or have done so in the past.
But these members see don't see refer
eeing as a chore. Besides being fun and
challenging, it's a chance to "run round, get
some exercise, be outside," said Delia Lana.
Sarah Bacon, who has refereed for two
years, agreed, stating that "it's always
exciting ... and you meet a lot of cool peo
ple doing it."
It takes more than an idealistic vision to
be a good referee, though. And it certainly
demands more than just running around
dressed in stripes. In a competitive environ
ment like Stanford, an official must have
inner toughness and personal integrity.
Lucas went so far as to say that reffing is
a "talent, an art," that one develops with
experience. Bacon, the only female on staff
this quarter, said, "Some people are cut out
for it; some are not."
All refs cite confidence as an integral
quality of officiating. "Having confidence
in yourself carries over into the players,"
said Kevin JefTery, the student director of
IMs. Jeffery stated that a sense of humor is
important too. "If you start to take things
seriously, it's all over."
What sort of things does JefTery refer to?
Try harassment, name-calling and ref
knocking. Stiff competition. It's the way of
intramural sports.
Basketball, the refs agree, is particularly
intense. "It's a lot of pressure," said Delia
Lana. "You're forced to give a quick,
assertive reason why you blew the whistle."
"You don't have time to second-guess
yourself. There's ten sweaty bodies, every
one's agitated, and you've got to make
instantaneous calls," added JefTery.
Making fast calls is the true test of confi
dence. And when those calls are questioned,
the initiation rites begin.
Although none of the refs have actually
been physically assaulted, there have been
hints of physical abuse, according to Delia
Lana. Afier reffing a close basketball game
his freshman year, he was cornered and
players threatened to beat him up.
JefTery, in a similar incident during his
freshman year, said players "wanted to rip
my head off!"
Although administering disciplinary
action, such as warnings or suspensions, is
one way to deal with misconduct, the refs
view it as "less of a punitive thing. . . .
We're trying to preserve the atmosphere of
fun," said Delia Lana.
"We're looking more to be pacifiers than
enforcers," JefTery stated. And often, both
JefTery and Bacon recalled, players who
were derogatory during the game would
apologize afterward, or commend them on
a well-officiated game. Said JefTery: "I
think people do respect the refs, and appre-

date the job we're doing."
The unmistakable competition
that often makes officiating stress
ful is something they accept. "It's a
function of our school," said Delia
Lana. "We've got two kinds of play
ers out there: those playing for fun
and those trying to recapture their
high-school glory days."
Bacon stated that, with basket
ball especially, "It's totally male
dominated . . . and they're so
intense."
Although all officials face this
intensity, being a woman makes
things different. "If I make a bad
call, I immediately lose respect . ..
guys will not give me any leeway."
she said. However, she says that
being a basketball player herself
gives her confidence.
Bacon further believes that if
players saw more female refs, they
would question her less. But being
a novelty, she is challenged and
must stand her ground. "You have

to stick with it," she said.
In hopes of balancing out the
male/female discrepancy, Sherry
Posthumus, director of Intramu
rals, hopes to recruit and prepare
more female refs. In part, this end
will be served by a one-unit class to
be offered next fall through the
Intramural Department. Posthu
mus believes that the course,
which will teach regulations and
technique, will establish a strong
base for staff, as well as entice oth
ers who may be reluctant to join.
Lucas mentioned that making
the staff more diverse would "pre
vent a lot of [unnecessary! things
from happening." In addition,
Bacon said there is a "constant
need" for refs, suggesting that not
only more diversity, but a larger
staff, would help the department.
Clearly, being a ref is not all fun
and glory. "Sometimes I ask
myself, 'Is this worth $6.50 an
hour, when I could be working
behind a desk somewhere?'" Bacon
said. But the positive aspects of the
job are enough to keep them com
ing back according to Bacon. "You
learn a lot about yourself."
