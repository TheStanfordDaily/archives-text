# Defense hopes to spark Cardinal
## After containing Arizona, Stanford looks to stymie Arizona St. 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
For only the second time this season,
the Stanford football team will face an
unranked opponent when the Arizona
State Sun Devils come into Stanford
Stadium on Saturday.
But that doesn't mean things will be
any easier, warned Cardinal head coach
Bill Walsh. "The feeling that 'finally,
we can play somebody,' is the scary
part," said Walsh. "We're going to have

to play with more intensity than a week
ago if we want to win."
That intensity will not be hard to
find. The narrow 27-24 loss to now-No.
7 Arizona last Saturday left the Stan
ford team more angry than disappoint
ed.
"Everyone is sick of losing," said out
side linebacker Jason White. "We're
ready to play our hearts out and win
some games."
The defense did its part against the
Wildcats, forcing 11 punts. The Cardi

nal offense, meanwhile, racked up 342
yards against the nation's best defense.
Turnovers and penalties marred what
otherwise were the correct ingredients
for victory.
"In the many years I've coached, I
don't think I feel any worse than I feel
now after that game, because this (loss)
was self-inflicted," Walsh said. "But we
have to go on. The attitude on the team
is that we're almost deserving now to
start winning."
For Stanford to cross over into the
win column, the team will have to con
tinue to demonstrate the strides it
made in Tucson, Ariz, for the remain
der of the season.
Arizona State travels to Palo Alto
with the same 2-4 overall record as
Stanford, and both teams are 0-3 in
Pacific 10 Conference play.
Again, Stanford's run defense will be
challenged. Sun Devil running back
Mario Bates is second in the Pac-10 in
rushing, averaging 84 yards per game.
"Their running back group is very
fast and explosive," Walsh said. "Our
defense has to sustain the attack."
But Cardinal defenders have a
chance to make an impact on the Ari
zona State passing game. Sophomore
quarterback Grady Benton injured his
throwing shoulder against Louisville in
the Devils' second game of the season,
and his passing deteriorated to the
point where head coach Bruce Snyder
pulled him in favor of freshman Jake
Plummer.
"His shoulder became worse and he
lost a lot of life on the ball," Snyder
said. "Our whole team was struggling,
so we made a change."
Plummer though, is still adjusting to
college football and against Oregon last
week was easily rattled bv the Ducks'
changing defensive sets.
"We really have to get to Plummer,"
