# Trying to avoid those post-tournament blues
## Booters square off against St. Mary's 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
Coming off last weekend's high-pro
file tournament in Texas, the fourth
ranked women's soccer team comes
back to earth as it travels to St Mary's
today for a 4 p.m. match against the
young but talented Gaels.
After defeating No. 8 Duke 1-0 but
falling to No. 1 North Carolina 3-1 in
the Challenge Club College Tourna
ment, Stanford (11-2-1) hopes to avoid
a post-tournament letdown against a
hard-luck St. Mary's team (4-8-1)
which has scored 11 goals in its past
three games but has only a 1 -1 -1 record
to show for its offensive work.
"This will be a good test of where we

are mentally," said Stanford head
coach lan Sawyers. "We'll be going
from playing in front of 3,500 to 4,000
people last weekend to this game
against St. Mary's."
Although the Gaels have a losing
record, they are just the type of team
which gives the Cardinal headaches,
according to Sawyers. Losing five
games by one-goal deficits, the inexpe
rienced St Mary's team is only a few
veterans short of a winning record
Starting as many as eight freshmen
and sophomores, the Gaels offset some
of their deficiencies with hard-nosed,
physical play, according to senior
Sarah Rafanelli.
Stanford has faced St. Mary's seven
times in the past, boasting a 4-2-1

record. Last year, the two teams faced
off on Oct. 24 at Maloney Field, with
the Cardinal edging out a 1-0 win on a
goal by Dena Dey, who remains on the
shelf this year with shin splints.
For the Gaels this year, junior for
ward Lori Hokerson leads the attack
with nine goals and 21 total points Top
defender Kim Donohue, a sophomore,
and freshman midfielder Lauren
Weaver are two other bright spots on a
St. Mary's squad which has eight
freshmen and seven sophomores on a
roster of 19 players.
"As long as we don't shoot ourselves
in the foot, we should do well,"
Sawyers said "But we seem to be
struggling against teams like St.
Mary's this year."
Sawyers noted the exceptional
progress of freshmen Suzie Boots
and Stacy Cook as highlights from
last weekend's tournament. Boots,
Cook, Erin Martin and Emily Burt
comprise a "Fab Four" freshman
class this year for the Cardinal.
Before last weekend's action,
Martin's 30 points ranked her
13th nationally and second in the
Western Region, and Burt's con
sistent play has made the midfield
position even stronger for the Car
dinal.
Reflecting on last weekend's
tournament, Sawyers said the
team's effort was "tremendous."
He also noted how well the
team overcame new problems, like
playing in intense humidity, and
described the entire tournament
as an "exceptional experience
from a coaching and teaching
standpoint."
