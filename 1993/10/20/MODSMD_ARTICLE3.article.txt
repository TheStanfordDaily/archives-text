# Funding for B factory stalls on Capitol Hill
## SLAC officials remain optimistic; say House will eventually approve project 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Although the House rejected a $22.2 bil
lion appropriations bill yesterday contain
ing funding for the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center's proposed B factory, SLAC
officials remain confident that the $237
million project will be approved.
The House sought to reject the Clinton
administration's request for $640 million
for the Superconducting Super Collider,
sending the bill back to a House-Senate
conference committee with instructions to
remove that portion of the legislation.
The 282-143 vote "[basically) told the
committee to reconsider" only the funding
level of Texas' super collider, and not nec
essarily that of SLAC's B Factory, ex
plained Michael Riordan, assistant to
SLAC director Burton Richter.

Riordan said he expects that the House
will eventually approve most of the remain
ing items in the appropriations bill â€” in
cluding the $36 million requested to begin
the first year of work on SlJ\C's B factory
project.
The B factory received a key endorse
ment from President Clinton during a visit
to San Francisco earlier this month, when
he announced that Stanford had been se
lected over Cornell University as the pro
ject site.
The project, which may answer ques
tions on howkthe universe evolved by study
ing the decay of rare subatomic particles,
would keep SLAC at the forefront of
physics research for the next decade. SLAC
scientists will use the money to upgrade the
now-silent Positron-Electron Project ring
