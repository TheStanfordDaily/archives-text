# Funding for B factory stalls on Capitol Hill
## SLAC officials remain optimistic; say House will eventually approve project 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Although the House rejected a $22.2 bil
lion appropriations bill yesterday contain
ing funding for the Stanford Linear Accel
erator Center's proposed B factory, SLAC
officials remain confident that the $237
million project will be approved.
The House sought to reject the Clinton
administration's request for $640 million
for the Superconducting Super Collider,
sending the bill back to a House-Senate
conference committee with instructions to
remove that portion of the legislation.
The 282-143 vote "[basically) told the
committee to reconsider" only the funding
level of Texas' super collider, and not nec
essarily that of SLAC's B Factory, ex
plained Michael Riordan, assistant to
SLAC director Burton Richter.

Riordan said he expects that the House
will eventually approve most of the remain
ing items in the appropriations bill — in
cluding the $36 million requested to begin
the first year of work on SlJ\C's B factory
project.
The B factory received a key endorse
ment from President Clinton during a visit
to San Francisco earlier this month, when
he announced that Stanford had been se
lected over Cornell University as the pro
ject site.
The project, which may answer ques
tions on howkthe universe evolved by study
ing the decay of rare subatomic particles,
would keep SLAC at the forefront of
physics research for the next decade. SLAC
scientists will use the money to upgrade the
now-silent Positron-Electron Project ring
to a state-of-the-art asymmetric B
factory.
The two-ring facility will collide
electrons and positrons to create B
mesons and their anti-particles.
Researchers will study the behav
ior of these particles in the fraction

of a second after they are formed to
understand why matter is domi
nant over antimatter in the uni
verse.
If the funding is approved, offi
cials estimate between 200 and 300
jobs will be saved at SLAC.
The vote "is depressing simply
because a majority of scientists
here are in favor of the [super col
lider]. The added uncertainty for
us is also worrisome," Riordan

said.
He stressed that SLAC scien
tists were still optimistic that the B
factory's $36 million budget would
eventually be allocated. "We have
our staunch supporters [in
Congress].... I would be surprised
if the [B-factory funding] got
touched," Riordan said.
"The real bone of contention is
not the B factory, it's the super col
lider," he said.

The House had voted to appro
priate only $220 million in June to
cover closing costs of the super col
lider, effectively shutting down the
project.
The $640 million figure in yes
terday's joint House-Senate com
promise bill was the same amount
the Senate allocated the super col
lider project in September. The
Senate has not voted on the com
promise plan.

The federal government has
already spent $1.6 billion on the
super collider, which is now 20 per
cent complete.
"There is an element of uncer
tainty" over the passage of the
SLAC funding, Riordan said.
"There's no champagne flowing
out here right now but we're still
very hopeful."
Riordan declined to speculate
on how long the committee would

take to hammer out a new compro
mise. Predicting when Congress
will vote again is "total guess
work," he said.
Rep. Anna Eshoo, who repre
sents Stanford in the House, voted
against the bill, but a member of
her staff stressed yesterday that
the congresswoman still staunchly
supports the B factory and was
only voting against spending more
money on the super collider.
