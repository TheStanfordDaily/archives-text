# High demand stretches Pub Board's resources
## 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
With the installation of $17,000 worth
of shiny, new equipment for Stanford's stu
dent publishing community, both fledgling
and established publications are eagerly
eyeing the vamped-up resources.
But, as student groups are almost sure
to discover, the money is expected to fall far
short of the greater financial demand.
"The discretionary funding is strapped
because of all the increased interest," said
Publications Board director Stephen Rus
sell.
While it traditionally has about $4,800
in its discretionary fund per quarter to
award to about five campus publications,
the Publications Board must now spread
that money among 15-20 organizations
this year.
Usually, "you could count on one hand"
the number of publications sharing that
money, Russell said. But this year, that
number has at least tripled.

More customers
"There's a bigger shortfall for two rea
sons," Russell said. "One, it's because I
tried to inform students about the facilities
available, and there was an increased de
mand.
"Secondly, the new technology is not
fully implemented yet, though the new
equipment will eventually decrease the
cost,"he said.
Among the new equipment brought in
by the Publications Board are two large
screen computers, a laser printer and a
scanner. The system will also be hooked up
to the University's computer network.
This is a vast improvement to previous
capabilities, according to Russell.
"There was better equipment in dorm
clusters (before)," Russell said. "That
shouldn't happen. Why would somebody
come here to use the equipment when
they could hop on a Quadra (in the dorm
cluster)?"
Russell's improvements could
not have been more timely.
Previously, the Publications
Board's ASSU fee, which totals
approximately $50,000, could not
support the added cost of outside
contracting for typesetting, and
the equipment could not meet the
needs of start-up publications such
as Newspeak and the G-Spot, in
addition to regulars such as the
Stanford Review.
Last spring's ASSU election
also saw the students vote to keep
the Publications Board special fee
the same as the previous year,
unlike past years when they usual
ly voted to increase it by at least 5
percent.
Another major problem was a
lack of communication between
the ASSU and the Publications
Board, according to Russell.
At the offices where student
publications worked, "there was
little or no maintenance," Russell
said. "It was a huge fire hazard,
stacks of rotting newspapers, old
electrical wiring in a dry build
ing." Russell said that the pollu
tion had caused the the laser
printer wire to clog, and there was
garbage everywhere, including a
10-foot pile right outside the
building.
Before the improvements, there
were two Macintosh Ilci's — one
of which was rarely used because
of its tiny 12-inch monitor — and a
laser printer. In effect, only the
large-screen computer could be
used for more than editing an arti
cle, resulting in crowding out of
computer time for several publica
tions, according to Michael Meyer,
managing editor for the Review.
"There was one computer,"

Meyer said. "IThe Review] had to
buy a hard drive .. . because it
wasn't fair to other publications
that we were taking up most of the
(hard drive) space."
Because of this competition for
resources, Russell committed
himself to informing the commu
nity of the Publications Board's
increased resources, a step which
created even more competition by
generating unprecedented inter
est in publishing by student orga
nizations.
"Some smaller publications
(previously) weren't aware of the
resources," Russell said. "And
some were forced off by the big
boys," such as the Review, Release
and the Chaparral.
Russell said that smaller pro
jects, including Mind's Eye, a liter
ary journal; Loose Ends, a comedic
journal; and publications by Stu
dents for Self-Government, Stan
ford Asian Youth Project and Stu
dents for Environmental Action at
Stanford, all requested funding
and signed up for time on the new
equipment.
Money matters
This increased interest com
bined with the fact that most
beginning publications need a base
amount of money to make up for
their lack of advertising revenue
means that funding is likely to fall
short of demand.
For instance, a group that seeks
to print a newsletter six times per
year needs a minimum of $1,000
per quarter — a sum that, when
multiplied by 15-20 groups, dwarfs
the Publication Board's $4,800
budget, Russell said.
The Publications Board, cur
rently composed of Russell, an
associate director and a financial
manager, determines how to allo
cate the funds among publications,
including the Review, that do not
receive ASSU fees.

Ideally, Russell said, the board
provides half of the costs and the
publication supplies the other half.
Once the costs exceed about
$5,000 the Board asks the publica
tion to request ASSU funds, which
is what has happened to the
Review this year.
"There is an amount — a floor
of money — that publications need
to keep going," Russell said. "But
if too many apply, those amounts
may fall below the floor for every
group, and no one will be able to
publish.
"For example, Bosnian [Stu
dents Against Genocide] wants
$3,900 for the publication," Russell
said. "For their type of publication,
that's not unexpected for the print
ing cost because they have little
channel of advertising. But there's
no way we can put that much
money for the one publication."
Even established acts like the
Review felt the effects of a pinched
Publications Board budget.
"We applied for $1,000; we
didn't receive any of it," said Bob
Dolbow, the Review's business
manager. "I had full expectations
of getting it, but it didn't become a
problem."
According to Dolbow, the
Review received discretionary
funds as well as annual funds last
year. This year they received only
annual funds, but, according to
Russell and managing editor
Meyer, The Review had enough
funds to cover costs.
The disappearing publication
One publication that did not
cover costs disappeared noticeably
late last year: Release.
"We had inadequate support
from (advertising)," said Cheo
Coker, former Release editor. "It
was never an editorial problem.
"Collecting on the ads (was a
problem)," he said. "Some [adver
tisers] welshed on agreements."

Coker also said that Release,
with Russell's aid and the cheaper,
improved capabilities of the new
equipment, should return by win
ter quarter.
Other notable absences include
Newspeak, an upstart bi-weekly
with a liberal slant, and the G-
Spot, a literary magazine focusing
on gender issues. According to
Russell, no one from either publi
cation has stepped forward to reg
ister and claim their annual funds.
Russell said that the G-Spot,
whose founders graduated last
spring, is a perfect example of a
victim of the board's inefficacy.
"It was a victim of the high cost
of production," Russell said.
"They wanted to come out and do
well.
"There are not enough publica
tions that come around and stay
around, and (there are) too many
flashes in the pan," he said.
More changes in the future
Russell said that the deteriorat
ing publications situation was
largely due to outdated ASSU
bylaws which impede changes
from being made. He said that a
reallocation of office space within
the Storke Student Publications
Building is at least three years
overdue.
Consequently, Russell is work
ing to address ASSU legislative
bylaws that would place the gover
nance of Publications Board mat
ters in the hands of the board.
Russell said he also wants to
expand the composition of the
board to include top editorial and
financial managers of publications
that receive funds.
"Right now, the board is me,"
he said. "Me, and the associate and
the financial manager.
"If there's one thing I want to
accomplish, it's to put control of
Stanford University publications
in the hands of Stanford students."
With the installation of $17,000 worth

Other notable absences include
Newspeak, an upstart bi-weekly
with a liberal slant, and the G-
Spot, a literary magazine focusing
on gender issues. According to
Russell, no one from either publi
cation has stepped forward to reg
ister and claim their annual funds.
Russell said that the G-Spot,
whose founders graduated last
spring, is a perfect example of a
victim of the board's inefficacy.
"It was a victim of the high cost
of production," Russell said.
"They wanted to come out and do
well.
"There are not enough publica
tions that come around and stay
around, and (there are) too many
flashes in the pan," he said.
More changes in the future
Russell said that the deteriorat
ing publications situation was
largely due to outdated ASSU
bylaws which impede changes
from being made. He said that a
reallocation of office space within
the Storke Student Publications
Building is at least three years
overdue.
Consequently, Russell is work
ing to address ASSU legislative
bylaws that would place the gover
nance of Publications Board mat
ters in the hands of the board.
Russell said he also wants to
expand the composition of the
board to include top editorial and
financial managers of publications
that receive funds.
"Right now, the board is me,"
he said. "Me, and the associate and
the financial manager.
"If there's one thing I want to
accomplish, it's to put control of
Stanford University publications
in the hands of Stanford students."
With the installation of $17,000 worth
of shiny, new equipment for Stanford's stu
dent publishing community, both fledgling
and established publications are eagerly
eyeing the vamped-up resources.
But, as student groups are almost sure
to discover, the money is expected to fall far
short of the greater financial demand.
"The discretionary funding is strapped
because of all the increased interest," said
Publications Board director Stephen Rus
sell.
While it traditionally has about $4,800
in its discretionary fund per quarter to
award to about five campus publications,
the Publications Board must now spread
that money among 15-20 organizations
this year.
Usually, "you could count on one hand"
the number of publications sharing that
money, Russell said. But this year, that
number has at least tripled.

More customers
"There's a bigger shortfall for two rea
sons," Russell said. "One, it's because I
tried to inform students about the facilities
available, and there was an increased de
mand.
"Secondly, the new technology is not
fully implemented yet, though the new
equipment will eventually decrease the
cost,"he said.
Among the new equipment brought in
by the Publications Board are two large
screen computers, a laser printer and a
scanner. The system will also be hooked up
to the University's computer network.
This is a vast improvement to previous
capabilities, according to Russell.
"There was better equipment in dorm
clusters (before)," Russell said. "That
shouldn't happen. Why would somebody
come here to use the equipment when
they could hop on a Quadra (in the dorm
cluster)?"
Russell's improvements could
not have been more timely.
Previously, the Publications
Board's ASSU fee, which totals
approximately $50,000, could not
support the added cost of outside
contracting for typesetting, and
the equipment could not meet the
needs of start-up publications such
as Newspeak and the G-Spot, in
addition to regulars such as the
Stanford Review.
Last spring's ASSU election
also saw the students vote to keep
the Publications Board special fee
the same as the previous year,
unlike past years when they usual
ly voted to increase it by at least 5
percent.
Another major problem was a
lack of communication between
the ASSU and the Publications
Board, according to Russell.
At the offices where student
publications worked, "there was
little or no maintenance," Russell
said. "It was a huge fire hazard,
stacks of rotting newspapers, old
electrical wiring in a dry build
ing." Russell said that the pollu
tion had caused the the laser
printer wire to clog, and there was
garbage everywhere, including a
10-foot pile right outside the
building.
Before the improvements, there
were two Macintosh Ilci's — one
of which was rarely used because
of its tiny 12-inch monitor — and a
laser printer. In effect, only the
large-screen computer could be
used for more than editing an arti
cle, resulting in crowding out of
computer time for several publica
tions, according to Michael Meyer,
managing editor for the Review.
"There was one computer,"

Meyer said. "IThe Review] had to
buy a hard drive .. . because it
wasn't fair to other publications
that we were taking up most of the
(hard drive) space."
Because of this competition for
resources, Russell committed
himself to informing the commu
nity of the Publications Board's
increased resources, a step which
created even more competition by
generating unprecedented inter
est in publishing by student orga
nizations.
"Some smaller publications
(previously) weren't aware of the
resources," Russell said. "And
some were forced off by the big
boys," such as the Review, Release
and the Chaparral.
Russell said that smaller pro
jects, including Mind's Eye, a liter
ary journal; Loose Ends, a comedic
journal; and publications by Stu
dents for Self-Government, Stan
ford Asian Youth Project and Stu
dents for Environmental Action at
Stanford, all requested funding
and signed up for time on the new
equipment.
Money matters
This increased interest com
bined with the fact that most
beginning publications need a base
amount of money to make up for
their lack of advertising revenue
means that funding is likely to fall
short of demand.
For instance, a group that seeks
to print a newsletter six times per
year needs a minimum of $1,000
per quarter — a sum that, when
multiplied by 15-20 groups, dwarfs
the Publication Board's $4,800
budget, Russell said.
The Publications Board, cur
rently composed of Russell, an
associate director and a financial
manager, determines how to allo
cate the funds among publications,
including the Review, that do not
receive ASSU fees.

Ideally, Russell said, the board
provides half of the costs and the
publication supplies the other half.
Once the costs exceed about
$5,000 the Board asks the publica
tion to request ASSU funds, which
is what has happened to the
Review this year.
"There is an amount — a floor
of money — that publications need
to keep going," Russell said. "But
if too many apply, those amounts
may fall below the floor for every
group, and no one will be able to
publish.
"For example, Bosnian [Stu
dents Against Genocide] wants
$3,900 for the publication," Russell
said. "For their type of publication,
that's not unexpected for the print
ing cost because they have little
channel of advertising. But there's
no way we can put that much
money for the one publication."
Even established acts like the
Review felt the effects of a pinched
Publications Board budget.
"We applied for $1,000; we
didn't receive any of it," said Bob
Dolbow, the Review's business
manager. "I had full expectations
of getting it, but it didn't become a
problem."
According to Dolbow, the
Review received discretionary
funds as well as annual funds last
year. This year they received only
annual funds, but, according to
Russell and managing editor
Meyer, The Review had enough
funds to cover costs.
The disappearing publication
One publication that did not
cover costs disappeared noticeably
late last year: Release.
"We had inadequate support
from (advertising)," said Cheo
Coker, former Release editor. "It
was never an editorial problem.
"Collecting on the ads (was a
problem)," he said. "Some [adver
tisers] welshed on agreements."

Coker also said that Release,
with Russell's aid and the cheaper,
improved capabilities of the new
equipment, should return by win
ter quarter.
Other notable absences include
Newspeak, an upstart bi-weekly
with a liberal slant, and the G-
Spot, a literary magazine focusing
on gender issues. According to
Russell, no one from either publi
cation has stepped forward to reg
ister and claim their annual funds.
Russell said that the G-Spot,
whose founders graduated last

group, and no one will be able to
publish.
"For example, Bosnian [Stu
dents Against Genocide] wants
$3,900 for the publication," Russell
said. "For their type of publication,
that's not unexpected for the print
ing cost because they have little
channel of advertising. But there's
no way we can put that much
money for the one publication."
Even established acts like the
Review felt the effects of a pinched
Publications Board budget.
"We applied for $1,000; we
didn't receive any of it," said Bob
Dolbow, the Review's business
manager. "I had full expectations
of getting it, but it didn't become a
problem."
According to Dolbow, the
Review received discretionary
funds as well as annual funds last
year. This year they received only
annual funds, but, according to
Russell and managing editor
Meyer, The Review had enough
funds to cover costs.
The disappearing publication
One publication that did not
cover costs disappeared noticeably
late last year: Release.
"We had inadequate support
from (advertising)," said Cheo
Coker, former Release editor. "It
was never an editorial problem.
"Collecting on the ads (was a
problem)," he said. "Some [adver
tisers] welshed on agreements."

Coker also said that Release,
with Russell's aid and the cheaper,
improved capabilities of the new
equipment, should return by win
ter quarter.
Other notable absences include
Newspeak, an upstart bi-weekly
with a liberal slant, and the G-
Spot, a literary magazine focusing
on gender issues. According to
Russell, no one from either publi
cation has stepped forward to reg
ister and claim their annual funds.
Russell said that the G-Spot,
whose founders graduated last
spring, is a perfect example of a
victim of the board's inefficacy.
"It was a victim of the high cost
of production," Russell said.
"They wanted to come out and do
well.
"There are not enough publica
tions that come around and stay
around, and (there are) too many
flashes in the pan," he said.
More changes in the future
Russell said that the deteriorat
ing publications situation was
largely due to outdated ASSU
bylaws which impede changes
from being made. He said that a
reallocation of office space within
the Storke Student Publications
Building is at least three years
overdue.
Consequently, Russell is work
ing to address ASSU legislative
bylaws that would place the gover
nance of Publications Board mat
ters in the hands of the board.
Russell said he also wants to
expand the composition of the
board to include top editorial and
financial managers of publications
that receive funds.
"Right now, the board is me,"
he said. "Me, and the associate and
the financial manager.
"If there's one thing I want to
accomplish, it's to put control of
Stanford University publications
in the hands of Stanford students."
