# Biz school students try hands at service

### Jamie Taylor 
Instead of competing in corpo
rate America's dog-eat-dog race
for internships this past summer,
some Business School students
decided to work at organizations
where profit, surprisingly, wasn't
an issue.
Taking advantage of an innova
tive program to gain valuable job
experience and earn summer
money — partially funded by their
fellow classmates' summer earn
ings, 23 students at the Graduate

School of Business accepted jobs
in the non-profit sector.
A group of first-year business
students who call themselves the
Stanford Management Internship
Fund operated the program,
which offered jobs in the arts,
public service and governmental
agencies.
Last year, the program raised
over $40,000, providing half of
each participant's small summer
salary; non-profit employers
make up the remaining 50 percent.
The $40,000 is raised through
pledges from students. More than
90 percent of this year's first-year
class promised to give 1 to 2 per
cent of their summer salaries to
help some of their classmates take
charitable jobs everywhere from
Prague to South Africa.
"The trend is definitely up,"
said Robert Eno, one of this year's
student coordinators.
Eno denounced the myth that
most MBA students want to work
within the private business sector.
"It's a misconception that people

who can't get into the private sec
tor fall back on these jobs — some
of these jobs are the most competi
tive," he said.
The program, founded 12 years
ago by Brian Kelly, Class of '82, is
designed to encourage MBA stu
dents to use their management
skills in the public sector as well as
to aid the students in their career
searches, Eno said.
"Business students can find
their own specific niche by work
ing in a charitable organization,"
said Danielle Moskowitz, another
program coordinator.
In addition, the program is
designed to provide people with
strong management skills to non
profit organizations that could oth
erwise not afford them, and enrich

es the Business School community
by increasing students' awareness
of the non-profit sector's need for
MBA skills, Eno said.
"This program opens up a lot of
doors to let people try a job they
normally wouldn't try," said John
Bondurant, who worked with a
senior-citizens organization in
Palo Alto. "It helps the non-profit
businesses because they often
can't pay for MBA skills."
More than 16 charities, includ
ing Save the Children, the Mid-
Peninsula Housing Project and
the Palo Alto Medical Foundation,
were involved with the program.
Second-year student Eric Higgs
worked for Direct Relief Interna
tional, an organization geared
toward raising the standard of

worldwide health care. The organi
zation helps establish health pro
grams in the third world, refurbish
biomedical equipment and train
medical technicians worldwide.
"In order to solve our social and
environmental problems, we need
to be sensitized to issues critical to
our society," Higgs said. "[The
program] allows students to have
opportunities to have greater cog
nizance for issues we are trying to
address."
Interest in the program has
grown each year, and Moskowitz
and Eno agree that the program
will probably expand.
Last year, in addition to the
$40,000 in student contributions,
the program received additional
funds from faculty and staff as

well as from alumni who have par
ticipated in the program.
For the future, however, pro
gram coordinators are thinking
about soliciting corporate dona
tions, especially from employers
who recruit on campus, Eno said.
The program has also sparked
similar organizations around the
nation at institutions such as the
University of Virginia and Har
vard Business School.
While other universities may
try to match Stanford's program,
Eno feels his approach is unique.
"Stanford stands out with its com
mitment to government and non
profit organizations. You can tell
that the faculty and the school are
really proud of this program," he
said.
