# What recession?
## Job recruiting stable despite market slump 
### Charles Katz Staff writer 
There may be a prolonged
slump in the nation's economy,
but the Career Planning and
Placement Center hasn't heard
about it.
This year's job recruiting rate
at Stanford has not experienced
any significant change amid what
some call a nationwide recession,
according to Ruth Schneider, di
rector of the CPPC.
One indicator of the relative
stability of the recruitment rate at
Stanford is the number of compa
nies at the Career Faire, Schnei

der said. The Oct. 15 fair drew 14tf
companies, compared to the 151
companies who attended last
year's event.
But because the actual inter
viewing and hiring process for
graduating seniors has just begun,
the verdict is still far from final on
the success of this year 's job place
ment programs.
Last year's programs, though,
fared very well, Schneider said.
There was only a 6 percent drop in
the number of scheduled appoint
ments at the CPPC from the 1991 -
92 school year to 1992-93, she
said.
"There will always be some
fluctuation in the number of
appointments. Last year there
were between 7,000 and 8,000
appointments," Schneider said. "A
6 percent drop is very minimal."
The steady Stanford job place
ment market is a reflection of the
high caliber of students coming
out of Stanford, said Lance Choy,
assistant director of the CPPC.
"Stanford's pretty fortunate
that it is doing as well as last year,"
he said. "A lot of companies are
cutting back on recruiting, but

they still want to come to Stan
ford."
For instance, defense companies
such as Lockheed and Boeing are
not hiring as much as they have in
previous years, Choy said.
The job market is very tough
for students who want to work in
those industries, he said. "We
advise students who want defense
jobs to take jobs in related indus
tries, and if the defense market
takes off again they can reapply."
While defense industries are
not getting off the ground, other
industries are flying high.
Telecommunications, semiconduc
tor and consulting firms are grow
ing by leaps and bounds, he said.
Those companies are picking up
the slack for companies that are

hurting this year, Choy said. "This
is not going to be an unusual year.
Some companies are sluggish,
while others are going like gang
busters."
Currently, Stanford is doing
fairly well in the job market, Choy
said, adding that he does not
expect any significant change in
recruiting in the immediate
future. "The only way to see how
recruiting will be going is to read
the newspapers. You can see a
reflection in recruiting from how
well businesses are doing," he said.
Company recruiting directors
share the CPPC's positive outlook.
"College recruiting is going very
well this year. We are banking
heavily on our college recruits in
order to follow a path to growth,"

said Charlotte Wells, Intel's corpo
rate college recruiting director.
Schneider said she is optimistic
about Stanford's job placement.
But, she said, students' success in
landing jobs depends on them tak
ing an active role in the process.
"Students have to work hard at
getting a job," she said. "They
need to actually look, participate
and network. Good jobs rarely find
the student. The student has to
find the job."
Senior Brian Hillger, an indus
trial engineering major, agreed
that there are jobs available for
students. "For me, recruiting is
going well. There are definitely jobs
out there," he said. "But I won't
know for sure how well every
thing's going until I get a job."
