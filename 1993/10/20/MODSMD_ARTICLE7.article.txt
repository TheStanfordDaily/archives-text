# Prof offers solutions to education debate
## Carnochan, author of new book, stresses broad academic experience 
### Matthew Parsons Staff writer 
Although Stanford is just be
ginning to re-evaluate under
graduate education, English
Prof. Hliss Carnochan has been
pondering the issue for years.
Carnochan, author of the re
cently published book, "The Bat-

tleground of
the Curricu
lum: Liberal
Education and
American Kx
perience," said
he is looking
forward to the
University's
upcoming
study. "I am
very much in
favor of having

(the Commission on Undergrad
uate Education] take a look at
what direction Stanford ought to
take."
His own hook takes a look at
the historical debate over what a
liberal education in America
should be.
"We are at the point where
American higher education
needs to understand better what
it is really trying to do,"
Carnochan said. "The whole
point of my book was to suggest a
review of liberal education in
America."
Carnochan, who has been
teaching at Stanford since 1960,
said he wrote the book out of
frustration and annoyance over
the "liberal education debate"

We are at the point
where higher education
needs to understand
what it is trying to do.'

that keeps being recycled every
10 years.
The academic debate can be
traced back to 1869 and the inau
guration of Harvard University
President Charles Eliot, who be
lieved in the "free elective" sys
tem instead of a required cur
riculum system, Carnochan said
"I've been around a long time

and I've
never heard
the argu
ments at such
a high vol
ume," he
said. "I truly
don't believe
we have a cri
sis in tradi
tional liberal
education.

We just have
to achieve a clearer sense of civic,
institutional and national pur
pose in education."
While Carnochan didn't write
the book with specific answers in
mind, he said he has formulated
some solutions to the liberal-edu
cation debate that are particular
ly suited to the Stanford commu
nity.
One of the things that distin
guishes Stanford from many
other universities is its large
number of engineering majors,
which makes for an educational
demography that needs to be
taken into account, Carnochan
said.
"The traditional liberal ap

proach by humanists is to force
feed the engineering students
Aristotle and Dante because it
will be good for them,"
Carnochan said. "The best form
of education for the Stanford
community would pay attention
to the liberal arts culture and the
culture of technology."
This approach applies to both
sides of the academic spectrum,
Carnochan said. "English majors
should know the cultural and psy
chological parameters that drive
the lives of those people who are
in the engineering world."
Carnochan added that there is
one step that all American univer

sities could take to gear their lib
eral education more toward their
student populations.
"One thing every American
college shares is that it's Ameri
can," he said. "And the Western
tradition books have been mostly
European.
"I don't want to diminish the
value of those books, but I think
we should also focus on American
authors."
The ideas in his book are large
ly drawn from his own experi
ences at both Harvard University
and Stanford. After receiving his
undergraduate, graduate and doc
toral degrees at Harvard, he
headed west.
Carnochan credits his "em
boldening" experience as director
of the Humanities Center from

1985-91 with introducing him to
people in many different fields of
study, from graduate students to
senior professors.
"Until then, I was enthralled
with 18th Century Britain," he
said. "If I hadn't been at the
Humanities Center and talked to
so many different people, it prob
ably wouldn't have occurred to
me to march out of the 18th Cen
tury and into the 20th Century."
Evaluating a liberal education
in America is not only important
for those in academic settings,
but it is also important for Amer
ica as a whole, Carnochan said.
"What you are talking about,
when talking about the Ameri
can liberal education, is what
should be the proper shape of
the nation," he said. "I don't

think anyone could deny that
this is more than an academic
debate. It goes to the heart —
you are asking what America is
going to be."
Because of the weighty impact
these questions have on the coun
try's direction, Carnochan said he
is pleased with the recent forma
tion of the Commission on Under
graduate Education.
"I hope that circumstances
aren't forcing the commission to
do too much and (that) various
political pressures don't over
whelm the realization that this is
a good thing to do," he said.
"Jim Sheehan is an old friend
who did much for the Humanities
Center," he added. "I wish him
well — he obviously doesn't have
an easy job."

these questions have on the coun
try's direction, Carnochan said he
is pleased with the recent forma
tion of the Commission on Under
graduate Education.
"I hope that circumstances
aren't forcing the commission to
do too much and (that) various
political pressures don't over
whelm the realization that this is
a good thing to do," he said.
"Jim Sheehan is an old friend
who did much for the Humanities
Center," he added. "I wish him
well — he obviously doesn't have
an easy job."
Although Stanford is just be
ginning to re-evaluate under
graduate education, English
Prof. Hliss Carnochan has been
pondering the issue for years.
Carnochan, author of the re
cently published book, "The Bat-

tleground of
the Curricu
lum: Liberal
Education and
American Kx
perience," said
he is looking
forward to the
University's
upcoming
study. "I am
very much in
favor of having

(the Commission on Undergrad
uate Education] take a look at
what direction Stanford ought to
take."
His own hook takes a look at
the historical debate over what a
liberal education in America
should be.
"We are at the point where
American higher education
needs to understand better what
it is really trying to do,"
Carnochan said. "The whole
point of my book was to suggest a
review of liberal education in
America."
Carnochan, who has been
teaching at Stanford since 1960,
said he wrote the book out of
frustration and annoyance over
the "liberal education debate"

We are at the point
where higher education
needs to understand
what it is trying to do.'

that keeps being recycled every
10 years.
The academic debate can be
traced back to 1869 and the inau
guration of Harvard University
President Charles Eliot, who be
lieved in the "free elective" sys
tem instead of a required cur
riculum system, Carnochan said
"I've been around a long time

and I've
never heard
the argu
ments at such
a high vol
ume," he
said. "I truly
don't believe
we have a cri
sis in tradi
tional liberal
education.

We just have
to achieve a clearer sense of civic,
institutional and national pur
pose in education."
While Carnochan didn't write
the book with specific answers in
mind, he said he has formulated
some solutions to the liberal-edu
cation debate that are particular
ly suited to the Stanford commu
nity.
One of the things that distin
guishes Stanford from many
other universities is its large
number of engineering majors,
which makes for an educational
demography that needs to be
taken into account, Carnochan
said.
"The traditional liberal ap

American Experience."
proach by humanists is to force
feed the engineering students
Aristotle and Dante because it
will be good for them,"
Carnochan said. "The best form
of education for the Stanford
community would pay attention
to the liberal arts culture and the
culture of technology."
This approach applies to both
sides of the academic spectrum,
Carnochan said. "English majors
should know the cultural and psy
chological parameters that drive
the lives of those people who are
in the engineering world."
Carnochan added that there is
one step that all American univer

sities could take to gear their lib
eral education more toward their
student populations.
"One thing every American
college shares is that it's Ameri
can," he said. "And the Western
tradition books have been mostly
European.
"I don't want to diminish the
value of those books, but I think
we should also focus on American
authors."
The ideas in his book are large
ly drawn from his own experi
ences at both Harvard University
and Stanford. After receiving his
undergraduate, graduate and doc
toral degrees at Harvard, he
headed west.
Carnochan credits his "em
boldening" experience as director
of the Humanities Center from

1985-91 with introducing him to
people in many different fields of
study, from graduate students to
senior professors.
"Until then, I was enthralled
with 18th Century Britain," he
said. "If I hadn't been at the
Humanities Center and talked to
so many different people, it prob
ably wouldn't have occurred to
me to march out of the 18th Cen
tury and into the 20th Century."
Evaluating a liberal education
in America is not only important
for those in academic settings,
but it is also important for Amer
ica as a whole, Carnochan said.
"What you are talking about,
when talking about the Ameri
can liberal education, is what
should be the proper shape of
the nation," he said. "I don't

think anyone could deny that
this is more than an academic
debate. It goes to the heart —
you are asking what America is
going to be."

try's direction, Carnochan said he
