Although Stanford is just be
ginning to re-evaluate under
graduate education, English
Prof. Hliss Carnochan has been
pondering the issue for years.
Carnochan, author of the re
cently published book, "The Bat-

tleground of
the Curricu
lum: Liberal
Education and
American Kx
perience," said
he is looking
forward to the
University's
upcoming
study. "I am
very much in
favor of having

(the Commission on Undergrad
uate Education] take a look at
what direction Stanford ought to
take."
His own hook takes a look at
the historical debate over what a
liberal education in America

ume," he
said. "I truly
don't believe
we have a cri

education.

We just have
to achieve a clearer sense of civic,
institutional and national pur
pose in education."
While Carnochan didn't write
the book with specific answers in
mind, he said he has formulated
some solutions to the liberal-edu
cation debate that are particular
ly suited to the Stanford commu
nity.
One of the things that distin
guishes Stanford from many
other universities is its large
number of engineering majors,
which makes for an educational
demography that needs to be
taken into account, Carnochan
said.
