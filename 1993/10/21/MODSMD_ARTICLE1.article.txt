# Stanford reduces tobacco holdings
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
While the University has de
creased its financial holdings in to
bacco companies over the last year,
it is still deferring any decisions on
formal divestment.
The University's Advisory
Panel on Investment Responsibili
ty delivered a series of recommen
dations in June to the Board of
Trustees concerning the future of
Stanford's tobacco investments,
said Gary Malone, director of in
vestment responsibility at the
Stanford Management Company.
Malone declined to give details
on those proposals, but a final deci
sion on whether to divest is expect
ed "within a couple of months," ac
cording to Diana Diamond, a mem
ber of the advisory panel.
The University currently main
tains $14.9 million in shares in
four tobacco companies, making it
one of only four American univer
sities with tobacco stocks among
their 10 largest holdings, accord
ing to the Chronicle of Higher Ed
ucation.
Stanford's largest tobacco in
vestment — valued at $10.2 mil
lion — is in Philip Morris Compa
nies, Inc.
Over the past eight months,
Stanford has sold about 130,000
shares of Phillip Morris stock, val
ued at about $15.5 million. Over
the same period the University
bought 2,100 shares of American
Brands stock, worth about
$140,000, and 115,000 shares in
Hanson Trust PLC, worth roughly
$1.7 million.
Malone said the decline in the
University's tobacco stock owner
ship since 1992, specifically Phillip
Morris stock, is primarily the re
sult of market factors rather than a
stated policy shift. The value of
Philip Morris stock fell from
$73.50 to $48.50 between June
and July 1992. The stock closed
Tuesday at $52.75.
"Philip Morris took a bath,"
Malone said. "It is not performing
as it had been in the past." Mal
one attributed the stock's nose
dive to the company's decision
last spring to lower their prices

and to a growing societal aversion
to tobacco products.
Most stockholders had little
choice but to sell, Malone said.
"Anybody hired as a manager for
Stanford is graded on the amount
of investment returns," he added.
However, whether the Univer
sity will formally begin divestment
of its tobacco holdings is still
unclear. Malone said discussions
among the advisoiy panel and the
Stanford Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility — a trustee
panel — regarding divestment
possibilities have been ongoing

since 1989.
Stanford's drop in Philip Morris
holdings reflects a national trend
among large universities toward
liquidation of stock in the compa
ny, which produces Marlboro and
Virginia Slims brand cigarettes.
The Chronicle reported that Philip
Morris has, in the last year, fallen
off the top 10 holdings lists of Cor
nell, Dartmouth and Rochester.
The growing threat to Philip
Morris' financial health has prompt
ed its top representatives to lobby
University officials and discourage
divestment. Diamond confirmed

that Philip Morris executives visited
Stanford twice last fall to meet with
the trustees' investment committee.
Among the paid representatives
from Philip Morris was John
Langbein, a professor at Yale Law
School, who helped draft a letter
from the company to the universi
ties "arguing against divestment
of any kind" because universities
should not base fiscal decisions on
social pressures.
"Divestment campaigns are
wrong because they interfere with
what fiduciaries should be doing" —
making money, Langbein said yes

terday. Langbein said Stanford offi
cials "understood my position" dur
ing their meeting last September.
While Malone declined to dis
close details of any conferences
with Philip Morris, he said the
University did express grievances
with tobacco companies about
"their targeting of underage smok
ers, women and minorities, and
the lack of (warningl labels on
overseas packages."
He added that, should the Uni
versity decide to divest, it would do
so as "quickly and prudently as
possible."
