## Denny beating defendant acquitted Jury delivers final verdicts: 'Not guilty' on 14 felony counts 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - With a
final verdict of "not guilty," the Regi
nald Denny beating trial ended yester
day, leaving a scarred city to face a
legacy of racial hostility and doubt
about equal justice for blacks and
whites.
Spectators gasped as the court clerk
read the verdict by a multiracial jury,
whose tortured deliberations left some
jurors ill and prolonged the suspense for
days.
Henry Watson, a second black
defendant, walked free after 17
months because the jury deadlocked
on the remaining charge against him
and a mistrial was declared. "It's a
nice day out today, huh?" he said as he
left jail.
Defendant Damian "Football"
Williams clasped his hand to his face
and smiled as his acquittal was read.
Williams, 20, and Watson, 29, were
accused of beating Denny and several
others when violence broke out April
29, 1992, at the infamous intersection
of Florence and Normandie in South
Central Los Angeles.

Denny was dragged from his rig and
beaten nearly to death while a televi
sion camera in a helicopter recorded it.
The beating was broadcast live and
seen around the world.
The rioting was set off by the
acquittal on state charges of four
white policemen accused of beating
black motorist Rodney King during a
traffic stop in March 1991. Two offi
cers were later convicted of federal
civil rights violations and are current
ly in prison.
Prosecutors said Williams was the
man on the videotape throwing a brick
at Denny's head and dancing in glee.
But the defense challenged the identi
fication and a prosecution claim that
the tape wasn't proof the defendants
intended to kill Denny.
Williams, convicted Monday of one
felony count of mayhem and four misde
meanor assaults on motorists, faces a
possible sentence of eight years in prison.
Watson was convicted of only one
misdemeanor, which has a maximum
jail term of six months.
They were acquitted of a total of 14

felony counts.
"Justice is not perfect. It's certainly
not perfect in this case," said District
Attorney Gil Garcetti, whose office was
Hooded with angry calls about the verdict.
"Perhaps justice is always imperfect."
"From the beginning we felt the
individuals charged with assaulting
Mr. Denny did so with no specific
intent to kill Mr. Denny," said Edi
Faal, Williams' lawyer. "We decried
the district attorney's decision to file
excessive charges."
Last week, the case seemed headed
for a mistrial when the judge replaced
a black woman juror after fellow
jurors said she was failing to deliber
ate. Four others also were replaced
during the trial that began July 28,
three for personal reasons and one'for
talking about the case with friends.
Deliberations on the remaining two
counts seemed in peril again overnight
because two jurors fell ill Tuesday.
The jury, which began its delibera
tions Oct. 1, wound up with four
blacks, four Hispanics, two whites and
two Asian-Americans.
