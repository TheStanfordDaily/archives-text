						Big Game tradition 
### 
WITH ONE BIG GAME tra
dition laid to rest, the time
is ripe to bring another one
back.
Most of the Stanford communi
ty, except the salamanders, was dis
appointed about this year's cancel
lation of the Big Game Bonfire, one
of the last of Stanford's traditional
ceremonial rites.
However, there have been many
other abandoned traditions in
Stanford's history, at least one of
which would be worth reviving in
the wake of the Bonfire's apparent
demise: the block party before Big
Game.
Though current Stanford stu
dents may never have heard of the
block party, the event was a big
draw in previous decades, up until
the 19705. Residents on the Row
would decorate their houses in the
spirit of Big Game and hold a
grandiose street party on and

around Mayfield Avenue the week
end of the game. In addition, houses
would compete to see who had the
best decorations, which, in those
days, ranged from elaborate Rube
Goldberg-esque weenie-roasting
contraptions to house-sized murals
of an Injun-Oski confrontation.
The block party eventually died
out, but could easily be reinstituted
through the efforts of a few dedi
cated and enthusiastic supporters,
maybe even the Axe Committee
members themselves. And associ
ates of Stanford's historical society
have said they would consider
offering a prize for a house-decora
tion contest again.
Contemporary street parties
would be a new twist on an old tra
dition. With live music, administra
tion and student support and prop
er safeguards, the block party could
be just what the doctor ordered to
cure Stanford from salamanderitis.
