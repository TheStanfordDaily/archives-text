ABBREV/TRANS/Dif/Dec
ph. Abbreviated transcripts
are difficult to decipher,
causing confusion and consterna
tion for both Stanford students
and potential employers.
Even though squeezing four
years of coursework into one
transcript is a difficult task,
somewhere in between the anno
tated and unabridged versions of
a student's academic record
there should certainly be room to
print full course names â€” or
something complete enough to
eliminate confusion regarding
the content or certain classes.
For those all-important
prospective employers, full class
names would add immeasurable
depth to that precious, two-sec
ond glance in which they peruse
the vital statistics of an entire
undergraduate career.
A course listed as "Bread &
Asphalt" (about homelessness)
or even "Soc/Found/Democrac"

(about democracy in developing
countries) is not likely to be
either meaningful nor informa
tive.
The transcript reader, in these
cases, would have to take an edu
cated guess or maybe buy anoth
er vowel to figure out what these
course descriptions mean.
And while other colleges also
limit their course descriptions,
this is no reason to accept these
sometimes indecipherable list
ings as customary.
Character count should only
be a secondary concern; tran
scripts' foremost concern should
be the conveyance of informa
tion.
After years of hard work meet
ing Stanford's challenges, stu
dents should be rewarded with a
transcript that will clearly
describe a student's academic
preparation, rather than danger
ously confuse a prospective
employer.
