## Break the tyranny of silence

geoned his adviser to death, which
made him a murderer. It also made
him the most famous person not to receive
a Stanford Ph.D. Most of the other stu
dents who drop out of graduate school slip
away with less fanfare.
No one knows how many Stanford
graduate students drop out of school,
because no one cares enough to keep
track. National research suggests that
only about 50 percent of the students who
start a Stanford Ph.D. program will
achieve their goal. Compare this to a 90-
plus percent completion rate for Stanford
undergraduates.
Faculty tolerate this waste of talent
because it meets their needs. The enor
mous research enterprise which drives
Stanford graduate education relies on a
continuous supply of cheap labor. The
"production" of degree holders and the
education of students are only secondary
outcomes.
In most departments the nurturing of
graduate students is the obligation of indi
vidual faculty members. Thus there is no
collective responsibility for graduate stu
dent success or failure. The Committee on
Graduate Study never asks the Registrar's
Office for attrition data. The Office of
Multicultural Development does not know
if minority students drop out of Stanford
at disproportionate rates.
This conspiracy of silence must end.
Most doctoral students who leave Stan

ford feel demoralized and stupid. By refus
ing to generate even the most rudimenta
ry of attrition statistics, Stanford is creat
ing an atmosphere in which students
blame themselves for their defeat.
Stanford students — among the best in
the world — do not leave Stanford because
they are intellectually inept. The real cul
prit is a combination of factors: lack of
funding, faculty neglect and, for some
groups, an inhospitable departmental
environment. Unfortunately, the collec
tive inattention of the faculty and admin
istration leaves students internalizing
their failure.
In addition, departmental policies and
individual attitudes institutionalize fail
ure. A large percentage of students are
expected to drop out every year. Some
departmental plans, particularly in
Humanities and Sciences, assume steady
attrition. Should too many students suc
ceed, departments would be in budgetary
crisis, unable to support the students to
which they had made financial commit
ments. To some faculty, the world of grad
uate students is divided into winners and
losers. A faculty member suggested that a
teaching assistant who wanted to help a
student struggling with statistics not
spend too much time helping this student.
If everyone succeeded, the professor
implied, it would mean that we aren't
maintaining high academic standards.
As long as the production of knowledge
through research remains a more impor

tant goal than the education of students,
nothing will change. Until faculty are held
accountable for the success of their stu
dents, we will continue to see appalling
attrition rates.
We must no longer tolerate a Universi
ty in which faculty can support their stu
dents as much or as little as they want.
Faculty whose students labor year after
year in their labs,, and yet never finish
their degree, should not be considered
scholarly role models. It should be unac
ceptable for graduate students to be told
by their advisers, "I don't Jnave time for
students." \
The University must break the tyranny
of silence. Students deserve'to know the
attrition rates in each department. We
need to know from which departments
women and minorities leave at alarming
rates. These issues deserve public discus
sion. Faculty must take public and collec
tive responsibility for Stanford's failures.
As long as it serves the interests of fac
ulty to suppress this information, stu
dents will continue to wonder why they
were "not Stanford material" rather than
asking, "Why didn't Stanford do right by
me?"

Chris hopes she will not become a data
point in someone's attrition study.
