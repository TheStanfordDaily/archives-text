## Gay commitment ceremony was insensitive to Catholics 
### 
NOT EVEN AN extremely liberal
interpretation of the Bible and
of Catholic church doctrine
could allow a gay, self-professed
Catholic man to have a wedding cere
mony with another man. That said, I
will refrain from moral judgment, as
that is best left to the individuals
involved and their relationship with
God.
The real problem with the gay wed
ding ceremony officiated in Memorial
Church is the fact that it was allowed
to take place in the first place. Under
the banner of understanding, equal
opportunity, progress and related
altruisms, the deans of Memorial
Church showed the deep root of
hypocrisy that grounds most of the
calls for sensitivity to minorities and
for tolerance of different ideas. I am
wondering why neither Dean Gregg
nor Assoc. Dean Diana Akiyama
showed any sensitivity toward the

members of the Catholic community,
among others, to whom this ceremony
is nothing less than an insult and a
blasphemy.
And why do I have the feeling that
had the land on which Memorial
Church rests been some sort of sacred
grounds for Native Americans, and
had somebody proposed a ceremony
somehow demeaning to such sacred
grounds, Deans Gregg and Akiyama
along with their like-minded cohorts
would have tripped over each other to
condemn such a ceremony and ban it
outright in the name of respect and
understanding.
But sensitivity towards Catholics?
Forget it. Catholics — apparently by
no one's fault but their own — have
failed to achieve victimhood in the
eyes of the enlightened souls that
guard the gates to diversity and open
ness.
Even more amazing is the decision

process of the deans. They spent
"about an hour and a half talking to
the gay couple before deciding to allow
the ceremony to take place in Memori
al Church.
It appears that although the title of
dean that they so proudly abuse was
invested on them by the mere mortals
of the University, those mortals
served simply as a vehicle for divine
intervention. Therefore, why
shouldn't they decide what can or can
not take place in their church? Why
should there be any need to consult
the communities that consider a
church a sacred place, and marriage a
sacrament?
The approach to morality of Deans
Gregg and Akiyama would have made
Henry VIII proud: if it feels good and
creates a "feeling of empowerment,"
then it must be religiously acceptable.
Never mind that those are the same
feelings that, say, a prostitute, or the

chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee may have. The idea of the
Church for all and for all ideas is
wrong.
There are moral and religious lines
that cannot be crossed. Since it has
been decided by two individuals that
in Memorial Church those lines will be
crossed, then it cannot serve as a
church any longer to those who want
to respect limits they believe sacred.
Such is the insult of the blind, irrever
ent and insensitive actions of two peo
ple who have disqualified themselves
as moral leaders of the Stanford com
munity.
Unless, of course, they are leading
us to the neighborhoods of Sodom and
Gomorrah. What's next for Memorial
Church, our revered deans? A bazaar,
perhaps? Oh, for biblical history to .
repeat itself!
