# Students note poignant effect of Krauss' column
## 
### 
A breath of fresh, cool air nuzzled our
eagerly reading eyes today as we opened
the crackling pages of Wednesday's fresh
Daily. All week long, we had waited,
anticipating Nicole Krauss's new col
umn, as babies yearn to be suckled at
the nourishing breast of their mother.
We carried the paper, turning it over
and over and over in our trembling fin
gers, off to some place that was quiet
and serene, fitted for reading half-fin
ished thoughts offering insight into days
and nights. As autumn leaves swirled
like little pixies around our slender
ankles, we embraced and huddled close
over the column, as if it were a familiar
hearth encircling us with warmth and
protection in the midst of a brutally
freezing world.

We were not disappointed.
Nicole's poignant column brought to
joyous light a disturbing problem among
Stanford students. Students are like
young babes, yearning to be nourished
by the milk of many friends and lovers,
but arriving sickly and emotionally ema
ciated. ,
The diet of an average Stanford stu
dent consists merely of books and prob
lem sets and papers and the occasional
frat party salted in beer and the sweat of
muscled, insensitive behemoths. Like
splinters of wood, they dance, solemnly
trying to collect the fractured pieces of
their shattered lives, only to find that
they are consumed by the flames of
ambition and competition and greed and
hatred.
Wednesday's column was like a trum
pet blast, resounding through the lonely
halls of Wilbur and Flo Mo and Stern
and even the far reaches of the Row.
"Rise! Rise!" Nicole beckons us, "And

join an empowered army — a special
army oflove and caring."
If getting a letter makes you feel
good, writing a letter must make you
feel twice as good. Letters are a lost art
form, an incredibly expressive brilliant
portrait of personal life. Be not con
sumed with the wracking stresses and
brutal trials of studying. Ignore the
autodial and realize, through the mail,
just how much we, as human beings,
have left to say.
