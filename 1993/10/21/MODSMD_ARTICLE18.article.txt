# Grad student clarifies rationale for fee revolt
## 
### 
The Oct. 18 Daily editorial claims
that graduate students are requesting
fee refunds because they don't consider

the programs worth funding. Nothing
could be further from the truth. We're
doing it out of spite.
The undergraduates denied us our
money, so we're going to make them pay
for everything.
Claiming fee refunds doesn't mean
that a group gets less money, it just
means undergraduates have to pay more
next year.
It's just like when you were little;
your elder brother would come and take
your football and not let you play. Life is
hard, we're older and wiser, and we're
taking away your toys again.
You didn't want to pay for the GSA,
that's OK, you can pay for everything
else instead.
If you want to renegotiate, the GSA
might still take your money. But
remember, a Smith & Wesson beats four
aces.
