## Sports superstitions: beyond the ol' rabbit's foot Ever wonder why Stanford athletes are so successful? Try looking into their dirty laudry 
### Janet Feldstein 
On a warm Saturday afternoon, thousands of
Cardinal fans flock to Stanford Stadium to per
form their respective pre-game rituals. Some pop
open the tailgate, load it up with food and drink,
then begin a feast. Others flip on the radio and
tune it to pre-game reports, or to play-by-plays of
other sporting events, all the while making pre
dictions for the upcoming game. For these fans,
the game would not be the same without their
preparations for the big event.
But what about the truest sports fans — the
athletes themselves? They cannot afford the luxu
ries of the fans' pre-game preparations; many
Stanford athletes have, however, developed their
own rituals and superstitions.
Canyon Ceman, a setter on the Cardinal men's
volleyball team, said he is a "big believer" in a
lucky pair of socks and shoes. If he has performed
well in a given pair of socks and shoes, he consid
ers them lucky and will wear them again. Howev
er, if he wears the shoes on an off-day, they are
given a "little break." ,
Ceman cited his mental pre-game ritual as one
many athletes use. "I build up angry feelings
against the other team. I change them from
friends to 'the enemy'," the senior said.
While these practices may be understandable to
fans, Ceman sheepishly admitted to another ritu
al that may seem more unusual. "After I run and
do the warm-ups, I have to take the obligatory Big
D." Ceman cannot ascribe this habit solely to
physical or mental need, but "somehow I feel it
helps."
Tennis player Michael Flanagan said he does
not share Ceman's strange ritual, but, like
Ceman, he varies his good-luck tokens. "I'm
always looking for good karma," he said.
For example, at a recent tournament, Flanagan
brought three shirts to wear. Flanagan chose one,
because it was unusual, as his good-luck token.
Unfortunately, his superstition dictated his wear
ing the shirt for all of his games — even if he
played twice in the same day. Fortunately — for
Flanagan as well as the people around him — his
mother was on hand for the competition and
indulged his whim by washing the shirt after each
match.
Flanagan gave another instance when he relied
on a superstition passed-on by assistant coach
John Whitlinger. Whitlinger had kept his frater
nity key in his pocket while he played. When
Flanagan tried the trick at the NCAAs, "it worked
for sure. We won the title!"

Although Flanagan's trick may have worked
for him, the team took another approach. Every
year for the NCAAs the team wears red shoelaces.
Flanagan said, "We rely on what has worked for
us before."
Gymnast Laurie West incorporates similarly
school-spirited good-luck tokens in her competi
tion wear. As a sophomore, West wore blue and
yellow elastics in her hair. The twisting of blue
and yellow bands symbolized the destruction of

Cal by Stanford. Last year West changed her
method and switched to red and white bands
emphasizing her support of the Cardinal.
Success selected a good luck token for baseball
player Scott Faulkner, and bad luck literally
snatched it away. During his freshman year,
Faulkner always wore a necklace with a dollar
sign charm. During one game, he slid into second
base and seriously injured his shoulder. He later
realized that his necklace had been torn off and

lost. As a result of that injury, Faulkner needed
arm surgery, and is only now beginning to play
again. Faulkner said he will find a new good-luck
token soon.
Frank Schneider of the men's water polo team
is an athlete who has lost faith in the notion of
good-luck tokens. When the team was winning
this season, Schneider and teammate Jeremy
Laster became superstitious about their grooming
habits. Laster sported a goatee which he would
not trim while the team was still winning.
Schneider's superstition may have been less
noticeable, but more potentially hazardous to his
opponents; he would not cut either of the nails on
his big toes. When the team eventually lost,
Schneider cut the nails, and decided not to pick a
new good-luck token. He explained his realization:
"You have to win (the game), your toenail can't."
Eric Diehl of the men's swim team still relies
on a good-luck charm that started out as extra
baggage. When Diehl was a 5-year-old and swim
ming for a local city team, he was required to wear
a hat at every meet. Because he brought the hat to
every meet, he mentally linked it with the success
he achieved as a swimmer. Last year Diehl's draw
mate donned the "magical hat" at The Draw, as
harbinger of a "winning" number. The hat
worked; the draw-group now lives in their first
housing choice.
Fencer Errol Hunter openly conceded that he,
too, relies on ritual. Hunter created an "initiation
ritual" for each of his new fencing weapons. The
night before he uses a blade for the first time, he
takes it to bed with him. No explanation, he just
sleeps with it "to break it in."
Football-playing brothers Jeff and Parker Bai
ley, offensive tackle and offensive-lineman respec
tively, developed a ritual involving Lee Corso's
"College Game Day" on ESPN. Every morning the
brothers rise before 8:30 a.m. to watch the show
and hear Corso's predictions for college game out
comes. "Whenever he picks us to lose, we always
win," they said.
While these athletes may admit to supersti
tions and rituals, other athletes insisted that they
have no superstitions, or that their superstitions
and good-luck tokens were abandoned long ago.
Many other athletes cited childhood or high
school superstitions; one athlete carried a teddy
bear, another's football team mandated group
head-banging against the wall. Perhaps these ath
letes feel their superstitions are no longer needed
now that they successfully compete on the nation
al level. Or perhaps they realize that all other
superstitions pale in the light of "the big D."
