# Sometimes I dream, I want to be like Jim

### 
The Cardinal is nailed
down on their own two. Sten
strom takes the ball from center
— hands off to tailback Rob
Ross. . .stutter step left. . . .and
Ross hunts for a hole behind a
disintegrating line. Holy cow,
what a move!!! Ross breaks
through the Arizona secondary
and he's off to the races! One
man to beat. . .and Ross, in a
blaze of Cardinal and white,
dusts the Wildcat cornerback
and scores on a 98-yard touch
down run. That guy. . .his
dashing rushes are like the
brush strokes of Da Vinci!

You don't see it? So you look
at my svelte body with its sleek
but powerful lines and think
Pinto rather than Porsche?
You watch me run and are
reminded of Barry Manilow,
not Barry Sanders? Shows
what you know.
Hey, I did play football in
high school. Okay, okay, so it
was sophomore year and I got
less playing time than the
water girl. But, hey, I could'a
walked on the Stanford team.
Who knows where Fd be now?
Stop laughing. Just ask Jim
Masetti, my idol. He believes in
my athletic ability.
Okay, so he's not that dumb
either. But he's gotta at least
recognize the approach be
cause, after all, it was his. With
a few variations.
Come on, you know Jim
Masetti. The starting goalie for

the men's soccer team. That's
right, one of the top 10 keepers
in the Far West Region. He's
the guy who recorded the back
to-back shutouts against Was
hington and Oregon State last
weekend. Jim's one of the rea
sons the men's soccer team still
has a shot at post-season play
(albeit a long one).
So what? Just another in a
long line of superb Cardinal
athletes. We spoiled Stanford
students have come to expect a
certain level of play, so what's
so special about another player
living up to our expectations?
Well, before you put the
paper down, not wanting to
read yet another tedious article
worshipping yet another Olym
pian who will grace the Farm
with two, three or maybe even
four years of athletic brilliance,
bear with me for another cou
ple lines.
You see, Jim's a walk-on.
Okay, so that's a little more
interesting, but nothing of the
same caliber as Jordan's retire
ment. Given, it's pretty tough
to walk on any team here on
campus, much less one as tra
ditionally successful as the
men's soccer team. But it has
been done. Look at Katherine
Juillard on the women's volley
ball squad, for instance. She's
getting some playing time as
well. So Jim's a little unusual,
but not rare.
How about this, then? Jim
got cut from the team his
freshman year.
That's right, Colin Lindores
threw him overboard, cut off
the excess fat, gave 'em the axe.
Sure, he was pretty good in
high school, making the All-
Peninsula team from San Car
los high school in the Bay Area.
But he just couldn't cut the


Rob Ross
mustard for a top-20 Division I uni
versity.
So Jim joined the other 98 per
cent of Stanford freshmen who
aren't "scholar-athletes". A serious
student, he began his trek toward a
Poli Sci major, with visions of law
school dancing in his head. His
dream of playing soccer for the Car
dinal didn't disappear, but re
mained hidden in that recesses in
his mind, reserved for goals des
tined to always be out of reach.
Not that Jim ran away ciying
whenever he saw a soccer ball. In fact,
he tried out for the Alondra Intramu
ral soccer team. The team was luke
warm to him at first, figuring, "if he's
not good enough for Colin, he's not
gtxxl enough for us," but they were
soon impressed with his reflexes,
quickness and soccer instincts.
Afterwards, Jim hung up the cleats
again to concentrate on the time-con
suming activity of rushing Kappa Sig.
He played a little for some area club
teams, but kept most of his energies
devoted to academics.
Then, sophomore year, Jim took
the class that was to change his life
— weight training.
The instructor was coach Lin
dores, who explained to Jim that
they were short a goalie for spring
practices, so it would be just peachy
if he could come out a couple days a
week to give the team another body
to shoot goals around.
Jim was only able to make three
practices a week and none of the
spring games, but as he practiced he
gained more confidence in his abili
ty to play for the Cardinal. His
dream, hidden away for two years,
began to re-emerge.
He was given a chance to play in
the final spring game and per
formed well. Afterwards, coach Lin
dores gave him the opportunity to
try out again. Mind you, he didn't
offer Jim the starting job, or even a
spot on the squad. Just the chance
to repeat his freshman experience.
Well, you know the rest of the
story. He made the team, finally.
And when the team faltered in the
beginning of the year, he was given
the chance to start, where he has
since led the team to three victories
in its last six games.
So I'm off to practice with my IM
football team. Because you never
know when coach Walsh will teach
weight-training.

student, he began his trek toward a
Poli Sci major, with visions of law
school dancing in his head. His
dream of playing soccer for the Car
dinal didn't disappear, but re
mained hidden in that recesses in
his mind, reserved for goals des
tined to always be out of reach.
Not that Jim ran away ciying
whenever he saw a soccer ball. In fact,
he tried out for the Alondra Intramu
ral soccer team. The team was luke
warm to him at first, figuring, "if he's
not good enough for Colin, he's not
gtxxl enough for us," but they were
soon impressed with his reflexes,
quickness and soccer instincts.
Afterwards, Jim hung up the cleats
again to concentrate on the time-con
suming activity of rushing Kappa Sig.
He played a little for some area club
teams, but kept most of his energies
devoted to academics.
Then, sophomore year, Jim took
the class that was to change his life
— weight training.
The instructor was coach Lin
dores, who explained to Jim that
they were short a goalie for spring
practices, so it would be just peachy
if he could come out a couple days a
week to give the team another body
to shoot goals around.
Jim was only able to make three
practices a week and none of the
spring games, but as he practiced he
gained more confidence in his abili
ty to play for the Cardinal. His
dream, hidden away for two years,
began to re-emerge.
He was given a chance to play in
the final spring game and per
formed well. Afterwards, coach Lin
dores gave him the opportunity to
try out again. Mind you, he didn't
offer Jim the starting job, or even a
spot on the squad. Just the chance
to repeat his freshman experience.
Well, you know the rest of the
story. He made the team, finally.
And when the team faltered in the
beginning of the year, he was given
the chance to start, where he has
since led the team to three victories
in its last six games.
So I'm off to practice with my IM
football team. Because you never
know when coach Walsh will teach
weight-training.
The Cardinal is nailed
down on their own two. Sten
strom takes the ball from center
— hands off to tailback Rob
Ross. . .stutter step left. . . .and
Ross hunts for a hole behind a
disintegrating line. Holy cow,
what a move!!! Ross breaks
through the Arizona secondary
and he's off to the races! One
man to beat. . .and Ross, in a
blaze of Cardinal and white,
dusts the Wildcat cornerback
and scores on a 98-yard touch
down run. That guy. . .his
dashing rushes are like the
brush strokes of Da Vinci!

You don't see it? So you look
at my svelte body with its sleek
but powerful lines and think
Pinto rather than Porsche?
You watch me run and are
reminded of Barry Manilow,
not Barry Sanders? Shows
what you know.
Hey, I did play football in
high school. Okay, okay, so it
was sophomore year and I got
less playing time than the
water girl. But, hey, I could'a
walked on the Stanford team.
Who knows where Fd be now?
Stop laughing. Just ask Jim
Masetti, my idol. He believes in
my athletic ability.
Okay, so he's not that dumb
either. But he's gotta at least
recognize the approach be
cause, after all, it was his. With
a few variations.
Come on, you know Jim
Masetti. The starting goalie for

the men's soccer team. That's
right, one of the top 10 keepers
in the Far West Region. He's
the guy who recorded the back
to-back shutouts against Was
hington and Oregon State last
weekend. Jim's one of the rea
sons the men's soccer team still
has a shot at post-season play
(albeit a long one).
So what? Just another in a
long line of superb Cardinal
athletes. We spoiled Stanford
students have come to expect a
certain level of play, so what's
so special about another player
living up to our expectations?
Well, before you put the
paper down, not wanting to
read yet another tedious article
worshipping yet another Olym
pian who will grace the Farm
with two, three or maybe even
four years of athletic brilliance,
bear with me for another cou
ple lines.
You see, Jim's a walk-on.
Okay, so that's a little more
interesting, but nothing of the
same caliber as Jordan's retire
ment. Given, it's pretty tough
to walk on any team here on
campus, much less one as tra
ditionally successful as the
men's soccer team. But it has
been done. Look at Katherine
Juillard on the women's volley
ball squad, for instance. She's
getting some playing time as
well. So Jim's a little unusual,
but not rare.
How about this, then? Jim
got cut from the team his
freshman year.
That's right, Colin Lindores
threw him overboard, cut off
the excess fat, gave 'em the axe.
Sure, he was pretty good in
high school, making the All-
Peninsula team from San Car
los high school in the Bay Area.
But he just couldn't cut the


Rob Ross
mustard for a top-20 Division I uni
versity.
So Jim joined the other 98 per
cent of Stanford freshmen who
aren't "scholar-athletes". A serious
student, he began his trek toward a
Poli Sci major, with visions of law
school dancing in his head. His
