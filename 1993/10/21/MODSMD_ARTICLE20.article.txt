The Cardinal is nailed
down on their own two. Sten
strom takes the ball from center
â€” hands off to tailback Rob
Ross. . .stutter step left. . . .and
Ross hunts for a hole behind a
disintegrating line. Holy cow,
what a move!!! Ross breaks
through the Arizona secondary
and he's off to the races! One
man to beat. . .and Ross, in a
blaze of Cardinal and white,
dusts the Wildcat cornerback
and scores on a 98-yard touch
down run. That guy. . .his
dashing rushes are like the
brush strokes of Da Vinci!

You don't see it? So you look
at my svelte body with its sleek
but powerful lines and think
Pinto rather than Porsche?
You watch me run and are
reminded of Barry Manilow,
not Barry Sanders? Shows
what you know.
Hey, I did play football in
high school. Okay, okay, so it
was sophomore year and I got
less playing time than the
water girl. But, hey, I could'a
walked on the Stanford team.
Who knows where Fd be now?
Stop laughing. Just ask Jim
Masetti, my idol. He believes in
my athletic ability.
Okay, so he's not that dumb
either. But he's gotta at least
recognize the approach be
cause, after all, it was his. With
a few variations.
Come on, you know Jim
Masetti. The starting goalie for

the men's soccer team. That's
right, one of the top 10 keepers
in the Far West Region. He's
the guy who recorded the back
to-back shutouts against Was
hington and Oregon State last
weekend. Jim's one of the rea
sons the men's soccer team still
has a shot at post-season play
(albeit a long one).
So what? Just another in a
long line of superb Cardinal
athletes. We spoiled Stanford
students have come to expect a
certain level of play, so what's
so special about another player
living up to our expectations?
Well, before you put the
paper down, not wanting to
read yet another tedious article
worshipping yet another Olym
pian who will grace the Farm
with two, three or maybe even
four years of athletic brilliance,
bear with me for another cou
ple lines.
You see, Jim's a walk-on.
Okay, so that's a little more
interesting, but nothing of the
same caliber as Jordan's retire
ment. Given, it's pretty tough
to walk on any team here on
campus, much less one as tra
ditionally successful as the
men's soccer team. But it has
been done. Look at Katherine
Juillard on the women's volley
ball squad, for instance. She's
getting some playing time as
well. So Jim's a little unusual,
but not rare.
How about this, then? Jim
got cut from the team his
freshman year.
That's right, Colin Lindores
threw him overboard, cut off
the excess fat, gave 'em the axe.
Sure, he was pretty good in
high school, making the All-
Peninsula team from San Car
los high school in the Bay Area.
But he just couldn't cut the
