## Cardinal booters kick-off against Spartans 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
They went up to Washington
and left the Huskies whimpering.
Then they lunched on Beavermeat
in Corvallis, Ore. on the way home.
After a finger-licking-good week
end like that, the Cardinal men's
soccer squad has been walking on
air. They have collected two big W's
and still have a glimmer of hope
that they will still be playing soccer
come November.
Postpone the party for a
moment, maestro. Stanford is set to
answer the question, "Yeah, that's
great, but can you do it again?" at
San Jose State today. And even
though the Spartans (1-4 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) have been left as roadkill by
their most formidable opponents,

this team is not going to roll over
and die.
"We're coming off two big wins
back-to-back, playing like myself
and the players know that we can
play," said coach Colin Lindores.
"Now we have to demonstrate that
those two wins this weekend
weren't a fluke."
The Cardinal (4-8-1, 2-2 in
MPSF) hope to emulate the style of
play that they ravaged upon Wash
ington last weekend against San
Jose today.
"The key to this weekend was
that we were all over them from the
start," said forward Rick Goad, who
scored three goals in the two-game
road trip. "It paid off" for us, so you
can look for us to be really intense
right from the beginning 1 against
San Jose]."
This game might be Stanford's

final chance to show that they are
capable of consistent quality play. It
has been an up-and-down season,
and while the lows have outnum
bered the highs the Cardinal are
definitely going into today's game
feeling better than ever.
"It's really a game that we
should win," Goad said. "We have a
tendency to let down after a couple
of big wins, but [against San Josel
we've always come away with a win
in the past."
However, the team is defmitely
not letting themselves get overcon
fident for the matchup.
"I guess we're confident, but
we're taking each game as it
comes," said junior back Jeff Kogl.
"If we have another loss or even a
tie our hopes for playoffs are limit
ed."
A loss would more than limit the

Cardinal's postseason plans. It
would kill them. Stanford is tread
ing on the edge of playoff elimina
tion, even though the team insists
that they are better than the num
bers show. But the squad sees a
positive impact in their misguiding
record.
"As far as I'm concerned that
helps," said junior midfielder Ryan
Collins. "I'm sure Washington
looked at our record and said, 'Ah,
they're not that good anymore.'
Even when we see a team that is 4-
8, we automatically think that
they're beatable."
The Spartans' schedule has been
light outside of the MPSF, but their
8-4 showing overall says something
about the quality of the squad.
"We'll see some good things
from them," said Goad. "They're
not a bad team."
