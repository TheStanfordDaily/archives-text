# Women's golf to host prestigious tourney
## 
### Seth Goldstein 
This weekend, the No. 7 Cardinal wo
men's golf team is prepared to welcome nine
tigers into their lion's den. On Friday, Satur
day and Sunday they will host the 30th
Annual Stanford Women's Intercollegiate
golf tournament at the Stanford Golf Course.
An extremely competitive group of teams
has been assembled for this year's tourna
ment. The field for the contest consists of 19
teams, including third-ranked USC, second
ranked San Jose State and the No.l team in
the nation, Arizona State. Other ranked
teams competing include No. 6 UCLA, No. 12
Arizona, No. 13 Tulsa, No. 16 Indiana, No.
17 Oregon and No. 20 Wisconsin.
"The powers in this tournament are the
powers in golf this year," said San Jose State
head coach Mark Gale. "The tournament will
establish the pecking order and give bragging
rights early in the season. It also lets each
squad know what work it has left to do."
Other coaches agreed with Gale's assess
ment. "It's one of the major college tourna
ments of the year," said Stanford head coach
Tim Baldwin. "There's great strength in the
field. It's very challenging to play against the
top-three ranked teams in the nation."

Baldwin is very optimistic about the Car
dinal's prospects. "I didn't think we'd chal
lenge (the top teams) until April," he contin
ued, "but from how I've seen my squad play
so far, we probably can do it right now, espe
cially on our home course."
A large part of Stanford's success this
weekend will rest upon the shoulders of
Mhairi McKay.
The freshman is a three-time British
junior champion and is considered to be the
No. 1 junior player in the world. "Everything
I have seen has certainly justified this (rank
ing)," said Baldwin.
An integral role will also be played by
junior Jamille Jose, who placed 30th in last
year's NCAA championship and eighth in
this year's NCAA Preview Championship.
"We have a very strong team," said Jose, "If
we all play our games like we can, we have a
very good chance to win. We've been close the
last two tournaments and I think we're just
coming into our prime."
A tournament with so many outstanding
teams comes hand-in-hand with a tourna
ment with many outstanding individuals.
The Stanford Women's Intercollegiate is no
exception.
No. 1 Arizona State brings five potential

Ail-Americans to the Farm, including 1992-
'93 AU-Americans Wendy Ward and Emily
Klein. The Spartans of San Jose St. have All-
Americans Lisa Walton and European junior
champion Vjibjike Stenstrud on their squad.
Janice Moodle, winner of last week's Edean
Ihlanfeldt Invitational, also plays for San
Jose State.
Other top players competing include Jill
McGill of USC, the U.S. Amateur champion,
and All-American Sophie Erickson of Tulsa.
UCLA will also bring a large number of Cali
fornia's top junior players to the tourna
ment.
Each team will start five players who will
play 18 holes each day of the three-day tour
nament. The lowest four scores each day will
count towards the team total.
San Jose State has won the Stanford
Tournament the last two years, setting team
total course records for both 54-hole (865
shots) and 18-hole play (282 shots) during
last year's contest. The Spartans' Tracy Han
son set the individual mark of 210 strokes
last year, as well.
Tee-off times begin at 8:30 a.m. on all
three days of competition. An awards cere
mony will take place at 1 p.m. after the final
round of play on Sunday.
