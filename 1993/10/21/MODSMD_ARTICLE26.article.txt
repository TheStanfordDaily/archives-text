Stanford's Casey Martin came
from two strokes behind to cap
ture the Northwestern Universi
ty Quintessence Classic title
Tuesday in Long Grove, 111. Mar
tin's two-under-par final round,
however, only propelled the Car
dinal to fourth place in the team
standings.
The individual victory was the
first in the junior's Stanford
career. "It was my first college
win and it feels great to get that
weight and off my shoulders,"
said Martin.
The final-round score of 70
posted by the former Ail-American
was the tliree-n>und-toumament's
best. Even more impressively, Mar
tin performed the feat twice, firing
a first-round 70 as well
"Just watching players like
Casey practice makes me want to
do even better," said freshman

team member Conrad Ray. "The
influence one player can have on
the rest of the team is incredible."
For the team as a whole, the
tournament was a disappoint
ment. The Cardinal, which trav
eled to Chicago ranked fifth in
the nation, finished fourth in the
12-team field. Stanford's final
score of 910 fell 14 strokes shy of
tournament winner Kent State.
The four other Stanford repre
sentatives finished bunched in
the middle of the pack. Notah
Begay 111 tied for 28th overall for
Stanford's second-best perfor
mance. William Yanigisawa and
Brad Lanning finished just
behind Begay in the individual
standings. Darren Dragovich tied
for 36th with a score of 234.
"The team results were disap
pointing," Martin said. "Those
were a couple of tlie hardest courses
will play on all year and now it feels
good to be coming back home."
