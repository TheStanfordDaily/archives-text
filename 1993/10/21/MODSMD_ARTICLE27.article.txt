# Soccer sputters but tops Gaels, 1-0
## 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
MORAGA — With only four reg
ular season games left, the Stanford
women's soccer team is doing every
thing it can just to win its games.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal (12-
2-1) did exactly what it needed to do,
but not much more as it topped St.
Mary's 1-0 Wednesday afternoon at
Garaventa Field, escaping with a
victory over a team it should have
dominated.
"A win is a win," said head coach
lan Sawyers. "You've got to take a
win whenever you can get them.
Obviously at this state of the sea
son, we're happy with the win but
we've got a lot of stuff to work on. A
lot of things we've been working on
in practice weren't there."
The Cardinal's only goal came in
the first half when sophomore full
back Jessica Fischer launched a
deep crossing pass in front of the
Gael goal. St. Mary's keeper Anna
Delis mistimed her leap and her
deflection landed in front of mid
fielder Anna Patitucci, who tapped

the ball into the open net.
Despite an inexperienced lineup
with eight freshmen and sopho
mores, St. Mary's (4-9-1) played the
Cardinal step-for-step for most of
the first half, oflen beating Stanford
to loose balls.
"We were kind of hurrying, but
that was partly due to their
defense," Sawyers said. "They |St.
Mary's] were packing it in and play
ing high pressure in the midfield,"
Sawyers said. "We're trying to cre
ate better scoring chances for our
selves. Sometimes it goes with the
flow and sometimes it gets held up a
little. They played tough defense
like they always do, they're well
coached and well-organized."
Looking for a different lineup
after Stanford's slow start, Sawyers
took out forwards Sarah Rafanelli
and Erin Martin. Vicky Haring and
Andrea Johnson replaced the high
scoring duo, and the fortunes of the
Cardinal offense changed, leading
to Stanford's only goal.
"We weren't organizing the way
we wanted to, so I needed a different
look up there. Andrea and Vicky did

a good job," Sawyers said.
Overcoming its inability to con
trol possession of the ball after Pat
itucci's goal, Stanford began to
assert its dominance with crisper
passing and tougher defensive pres
sure in the second half.
"We wanted to play a little high
er pressure in the second half,"
Sawyers said. "We'd given them a
little too much respect. I think our
kids picked it up a little bit after
halllime. That seems to be the pat
tern of things. I think it's making
me old before my time."
In the second half, an apparent
goal by Stanford's Jen Stephan was
negated when the referee decided
Stephan pushed off to get open for
the pass.
As it turned out, a second goal
was unnecessary as Stanford got
tremendous play from its goalkeep
er, Leslie Garrard.
Garrard, a senior, is quietly
putting together an All-American
season. The shutout against St.
Mary's was her 12th of the year,
while only allowing six goals in 15
games.
