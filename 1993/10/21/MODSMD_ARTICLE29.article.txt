# Considering a Miles-free diet Victor Haseman

### 
The early afternoon at my nine-to-five,
slave-sweet-slave was ushered in pre
cisely the same way day after day for
nine months. A late lunch with NPR's Terry
Gross. "From Philadelphia," she'd coo, "This is
'Fresh Air.' " Then, with a grin, I'd let the goofy
groove of her talk-show theme wash over me,
like a mild wave on a breathless beach. Terry
and I, you see, had a real good thing going.
She'd drop by with provocative inter
views with the movers and shakers of pop
culture you've heard of (your John Single
tons and Angela Lansburys) and couldn't
care less about (your William Gibsons and
Georgia Browns); and I'd declare idly to
hook the local public radio station with a fat
cash donation during the next pledge drive.
The arrangement was beautiful, especial
ly that early August afternoon. Lunch was on
— homemade baked macaroni and cheese,
Noah's bagels on the side, and bottled spring
water — and Terry had just introduced me
to Atianta Tribune columnist Pearl Cleage, a
sistah (make that supersistah) as funky and
outspoken as she wants to be.
She originally came by to plug her new
book "Deals with the Devil: and Other Rea
sons to Riot," but Terry has this way of push
ing conversations all over the place like a
shopping cart in Safeway. So the feminine

duo bounced from '90s motherhood, to black
education, to being true to the 'hood, to why
Pearl was still mad at Miles Davis (rest in
peace) and won't play his records anymore.
Uh, could you back up? I'm afraid I
missed something extremely important.
Pearl's still mad at Miles Davis (rest in peace)
and won't play his records anymore.
And why? Because in "Miles: The Autobi
ography" every jazzhead's favorite artistic
but-brutish genius openly admits to beating
down ex-wife Cicely Tyson with an absence
of remorse that flogs the mind.
Pearl's point was crisp and sensible: if
you're niggerish enough to admit to striking
your black woman in a venue where all the
world can see (and clearly don't give a fuck),
don't expect people — namely black people,
but specifically black women — to run to
your music during those moments of black
on-black intimacy, moments of introspec
tion, moments period. Expect them to find
you "guilty of self-confessed violent crimes
against women such that [they] ought to
break [your] records,burn [your] tapes, and

scratch up [your] CDs until [you] acknowl
edge and apologize and agree to rethink
[your] position on The Woman Question."
Super Pearl then kicked her argument to
that next level by dropping the H-bomb, or
rather the G-bomb. What would brothas and
sistas do if they discovered that cross-over
slickster Kenny G had a thing about black
men ... a bad thing. So bad in fact, that
where ever Ken played that golden sax of his,
an unusually large number of brothas would
be laid out in the local emergency room. The
community would not be havin' it.
Still, my "1 support you black woman," was
a qualified one. I had heard the Sermon on the
Mount but still wasn't convinced I needed to
follow Christ. It was Miles. Miles "All Blue,"
Miles "So What," Miles "Footprints," Miles
"Bitches Brew," Miles I-can't-live-without
you, Miles yours-was-the-first-serious-jazz-I
ever-collected; Miles who passed on to the
other side in '91 and could no longer apolo
gize for life's mistakes. 1 was in that blasted
tunnel with the light at the end; and the light
was Miles, and Miles was the light and I

couldn't back up and turn around 'cause the
trip there was longer than the trip back.
Back in reality, the world went right on lis
tening to Miles like nothing had happened.
Clint Eastwood played "All Blues" during "In
the Line of Fire." KJAZ, the Bay Area's local
jazz station, kept playing his music too. Even
women I knew went right on listening to
Miles. 'Footprints' is my favorite song," ex
plained one of my black woman friends. If
she could, why couldn't 1?, I thought. So, I
bought a subscription to "Let the Dead Bury
the Dead," and lived on in quasi-peace.
Until a friend found the article Pearl wrote
back in '90. "When the Music Doesn't Play:
Click! Why this writer got mad at Miles
Davis" asks Miles to apologize or else, and her
printed argument struck me even harder than
her spoken argument did months before. But
my response is still frustratingly the same: a
qualified "I support you black woman." I low
much longer could 1 let Miles run the voodoo
down from beyond the grave? After all, I only
bought a year-long subscription?
"So the question is," Pearl concludes at
the end of her piece, "How can they hit us
and still be our leaders? Our husbands? Our
lovers? Our geniuses? Our friends?"
They can't, Pearl. But a dead black man
can't apologize either. ■

culture you've heard of (your John Single
tons and Angela Lansburys) and couldn't
care less about (your William Gibsons and
Georgia Browns); and I'd declare idly to
hook the local public radio station with a fat
cash donation during the next pledge drive.
The arrangement was beautiful, especial
ly that early August afternoon. Lunch was on
— homemade baked macaroni and cheese,
Noah's bagels on the side, and bottled spring
water — and Terry had just introduced me
to Atianta Tribune columnist Pearl Cleage, a
sistah (make that supersistah) as funky and
outspoken as she wants to be.
She originally came by to plug her new
book "Deals with the Devil: and Other Rea
sons to Riot," but Terry has this way of push
ing conversations all over the place like a
shopping cart in Safeway. So the feminine

duo bounced from '90s motherhood, to black
education, to being true to the 'hood, to why
Pearl was still mad at Miles Davis (rest in
peace) and won't play his records anymore.
Uh, could you back up? I'm afraid I
missed something extremely important.
Pearl's still mad at Miles Davis (rest in peace)
and won't play his records anymore.
And why? Because in "Miles: The Autobi
ography" every jazzhead's favorite artistic
but-brutish genius openly admits to beating
down ex-wife Cicely Tyson with an absence
of remorse that flogs the mind.
Pearl's point was crisp and sensible: if
you're niggerish enough to admit to striking
your black woman in a venue where all the
world can see (and clearly don't give a fuck),
don't expect people — namely black people,
but specifically black women — to run to
your music during those moments of black
on-black intimacy, moments of introspec
tion, moments period. Expect them to find
you "guilty of self-confessed violent crimes
against women such that [they] ought to
break [your] records,burn [your] tapes, and

scratch up [your] CDs until [you] acknowl
edge and apologize and agree to rethink
[your] position on The Woman Question."
Super Pearl then kicked her argument to
that next level by dropping the H-bomb, or
rather the G-bomb. What would brothas and
sistas do if they discovered that cross-over
slickster Kenny G had a thing about black
men ... a bad thing. So bad in fact, that
where ever Ken played that golden sax of his,
an unusually large number of brothas would
be laid out in the local emergency room. The
community would not be havin' it.
Still, my "1 support you black woman," was
a qualified one. I had heard the Sermon on the
Mount but still wasn't convinced I needed to
follow Christ. It was Miles. Miles "All Blue,"
Miles "So What," Miles "Footprints," Miles
"Bitches Brew," Miles I-can't-live-without
you, Miles yours-was-the-first-serious-jazz-I
ever-collected; Miles who passed on to the
other side in '91 and could no longer apolo
gize for life's mistakes. 1 was in that blasted
tunnel with the light at the end; and the light
was Miles, and Miles was the light and I

couldn't back up and turn around 'cause the
trip there was longer than the trip back.
Back in reality, the world went right on lis
tening to Miles like nothing had happened.
Clint Eastwood played "All Blues" during "In
the Line of Fire." KJAZ, the Bay Area's local
jazz station, kept playing his music too. Even
women I knew went right on listening to
Miles. 'Footprints' is my favorite song," ex
plained one of my black woman friends. If
she could, why couldn't 1?, I thought. So, I
bought a subscription to "Let the Dead Bury
the Dead," and lived on in quasi-peace.
Until a friend found the article Pearl wrote
back in '90. "When the Music Doesn't Play:
Click! Why this writer got mad at Miles
Davis" asks Miles to apologize or else, and her
printed argument struck me even harder than
her spoken argument did months before. But
my response is still frustratingly the same: a
qualified "I support you black woman." I low
much longer could 1 let Miles run the voodoo
down from beyond the grave? After all, I only
bought a year-long subscription?
"So the question is," Pearl concludes at
the end of her piece, "How can they hit us
and still be our leaders? Our husbands? Our
lovers? Our geniuses? Our friends?"
They can't, Pearl. But a dead black man
can't apologize either. ■
The early afternoon at my nine-to-five,
slave-sweet-slave was ushered in pre
cisely the same way day after day for
nine months. A late lunch with NPR's Terry
Gross. "From Philadelphia," she'd coo, "This is
'Fresh Air.' " Then, with a grin, I'd let the goofy
groove of her talk-show theme wash over me,
like a mild wave on a breathless beach. Terry
and I, you see, had a real good thing going.
She'd drop by with provocative inter
views with the movers and shakers of pop
