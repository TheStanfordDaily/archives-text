# Revision of Honor Code expected later this year
## In speech, Edmonds also announces three-year plan to examine student programs and services 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
University committees will review the Honor
Code and create a three-year strategic plan to exam
ine the Office of Student Affairs, Vice Provost and
Dean of Student Affairs Mary Edmonds said yester
day.
As part of her second annual "State of Student Af
fairs" address, Edmonds told Student Affairs' staff
members who filled Memorial Auditorium to be pre
pared for changes that Stanford will have to make in
order to stay at the forefront of education and re
search.
"Change can be exciting and rewarding — that is
the way we must think in this new environment.
Stanford is a dynamic institute; it is changing now to
meet the demands and dreams of the future," Ed
monds said.
As part of these changes, Edmonds said the whole
process of judicial review for student violations, in

eluding the Honor Code itself, will be examined and
revised sometime this year.
The Honor Code has not been fully reviewed
since 1976. As it stands, the code gives students
greater academic freedom, such as the privilege of
taking unproctored exams, in exchange for their
promise not to cheat. Last year, the code's effective
ness was questioned after three separate incidents
of cheating were reported on winter quarter final
exams.
But Edmonds said after her speech that she had
been interested in a review of the judicial process be
fore the cheating occurred, and that the University
Cabinet's decision in July to examine the process was
largely unaffected by last year's violations.
"It's been on my list since last year, and now that
both (Provost Condoleezza Rice) and I are in place,
the process has started. Some people's decisions may
have been affected by last year's incidents but a re-
view has been due for a while,"
Edmonds said.
However, she also said that it
is premature to list specific details
on the review.
In addition to the Honor Code,
Edmonds discussed the formation
of a three-year strategic plan — a
self-assessment — that will exam
ine the external and internal fac
tors affecting Student Affairs.
Edmonds also warned staff
members that future budget cuts
are imminent. "We will have to
share the additional cuts — we
can no longer do more with less.
The reality is we will have to
restructure," she said.
"As a unit, we need to look at
our overall vision and mission
statement. ... A strategic plan
gives us a futuristic look of where
we want to be at a given time,"
Edmonds said.

The plan for reassessment will
have numerous objectives,
including studying the value of
different Student Affairs pro
grams and services and examin
ing whether "what we do has
quality, relevance, versatility . . .
and creates a healthy climate,"
she added.
The Office of Student Affairs
oversees the Dean of Students'
office, Residential Education,
Cowell Student Health Center,
and the Financial Aids Office,
among other student-focused
offices.
Although each department will
develop its own specific plan, an
umbrella committee will oversee
the whole process, she said. The
committee, which has just been
formed, will meet for the first
time in November.
In her address, Edmonds also
listed several positive changes
that have taken place in Student
Affairs departments since she
assumed the role of vice-provost a
year ago.

She named the creation of the
sexual harassment and no-smok
ing policies, Rice's appointment
as provost, and the selection of
new leadership for the Haas Cen
ter for Public Service, Cowell and

the Registrar's Office as just a few
of the positive reforms that have
occurred in the face of budget cuts
and other factors.
And even though Student
Affairs faces more budget cuts,
Edmonds said she believes that
it can and will survive the
changes.
"I sensed despair in 1990 but
I knew that with it's fine reputa
tion, Stanford University could
not help but succeed in the face
of odds. It has happened, and it
will continue to happen," she
said.
The Student Affairs office will
endure as well, Edmonds said.
"Student Affairs is healthy — not
wealthy — but we are wise," she
concluded.
Before her speech, Edmonds
recognized staff members who
have worked at the University for
more than 25 years, those people
who have taken on acting posi
tions for the year and introduced
the new directors who have been
appointed this year.
