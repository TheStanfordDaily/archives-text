## Anne Makepeace puts her hand on a 35mm Glock

Imagine Ward, June, Wally and the Beaver home
alone in suburbia after another of June's delicious
meals. Ward sits in front of the television watching
something or other, while June does the dishes, then
goes upstairs to get ready for bed. Ward hears a noise
in another room and goes to investigate. As he does
so, a Vietnamese girl who's been spying on them
through their open curtains slips into the house, takes
the remote control and exits. When Ward comes back
to the television room, the girl points the remote at
the house and channel surfs to her heart's content. Be
fore Ward can figure out what's going on, she and her
partner — a middle-aged Nordic type — jump into
their car and speed away into the night. Poor Ward
never knew what hit him.
Welcome to the off-beat world of Anne Make
peace.
There's something brutally assaultive about the
opening to her latest film, "Night Driving," almost as
if the girl, Tan, and her partner, Daddy, are conspiring
to destroy the ideal American family. Makepeace dis
agrees, saying, "Her looking into the family through
the windows is a longing, because what she imagines
inside is all the great food they're eating and the clean
sheets and the various toys people are playing with.
Her imagination conjures up a life that she thinks she
wants. When she goes inside to steal things, those are
like tokens or trophies or icons of what she sees as this
life that she wants. It's not so much that she's going in
to destroy, it's that she's taking for herself some little
bit of the American dream.
"Now Daddy is another kettle of fish altogether.
He's grown up in the 'I-eave it to Beaver' household
and he knows that there's dysfunction in every family.
Plus, he's just been thrown outside of any ability to live
a normal life by his experiences in the war. One of the
major themes is the wound of the Vietnam War, that
all of the lives in that movie have been created or very
profoundly affected by the Vietnam War."
The film is told from Tan's point of view, but it in
corporates stock footage from the Vietnam War,
which Tan seems too young to remember. "We debat
ed about whether putting a date on there, because the
story was written in 1985, and really, it should be set
in 1985.... The last Amerasian babies could have
been born in 1973, but that still means that they
would be 20 now.
"I did avoid showing any signs of anything after
'88, I think. There are no cars in the movie that are
dated later than that." The anachronism doesn't dc-

stroy "Night Driving"; in fact, it actually gives the film
an eerie disconnectedness from reality, £ la "Jacob's
I-adder," another Vietnam-influenced film.
Having attended Stanford during the '60s, it isn't
surprising that Makepeace, like Oliver Stone and oth
ers, is still haunted by the spectre of Vietnam. After
graduating with a bachelor's in English in 1969, she
stayed on to receive a master's in education in 1971.
Makepeace taught drama, English and filmmaking for
the next eight years, at which point she returned to the
Farm for the graduate program in film.
Her hour-long thesis project, "Moonchild," was
shot and edited over the next few years. Finally com
pleted in 1982, it tells the true story of one person's in
doctrination into the Moonies cult and their subse
quent deprogramming. "I really made it as an educa
tional film to show in schools and colleges as a warn
ing so people wouldn't get involved with groups like
that without knowing what they were getting into."
The success of "Moonchild" came as somewhat of
a surprise to Makepeace. It was broadcast on HBO
and PBS; in addition, the film received numerous
prizes and awards. "It was pretty great for my first
film," she says. "1 sort of thought everything was set."
But it didn't turn her into an overnight sensation.
"I've been struggling ever since," Makepeace admits.
"Certainly, I've had some successes, but it has never
been easy."
"Night Driving" might help to change all that — it's
been selected for showing at the San Jose Film Festival.

Her husband wrote a collection
of stories tided "Night Dri
ving," one of which became the
jumping-off point for the film.
"The film is quite different from
the short story. Basically, what I
took from my husband's story
was the two leads — the Daddy
character and the girl, Tan. I
was really affected by these two

drifting lost souls. I guess I created the whole idea of
her longing for some idealized family and not really
not considering her life, the way it was, of value.
"For me, the story is about claiming your own life,
as chaotic and weird and unconventional as it looks.
That people who you're with or who care for you are
your family."
Tan leirns this the hard way. When she and Daddy
are caught by the police, the authorities turn her over
to a devoutly religious family. It seems that this is

'For me, the story is
about claiming your own
life, as chaotic and weird
and unconventional as it
looks.'
— Anne Makepeace
\

Tan's big break, that she's finally found the nuclear
ideal that she seeks, but she ends up running away to
rejoin Daddy.
"I guess what she realizes when she's sort of locked
inside this house is that it isn't the dream that she had.
It's not this wonderfully comfortable and liberating
thing; in fact, it exacts its own pound of flesh. Basical
ly she becomes nostalgic for the freedom of the road,
as chaotic as it was. She misses the Daddy figure and
she's feeling very pinched in by her tight dress and the
mother's fantasy about what she's supposed to be."
The film also touches on the racist aspects of the
Fast-West dynamic. "She (Tan) has had a fantasy that
her real father lives in a place like this and maybe this
could be her father. Why not? When she brings that up
in the living room and says 'You could be my real dad,'
he says, 'I'm not that kind of guy,' meaning 'I wouldn't
sleep with Vietnamese girls,' which he probably did.
That's a very hurtful thing he says to her."
Makepeace cites Francois Truffaut and Satyajit Ray
as influences, saying, "When I was an undergraduate at
Stanford there were these wonderful film clubs; Tues
day night French films and Wednesday night Italian
films and Thursday night Russian films — it was in
credible. Those foreign films made me see that you
could look at the world in a very different way than the
1 lollywood mainstream did."
Her penchant for things outside the mainstream
won't endear her to the Tinseltown machine. "If
you're like me, interested in somewhat offbeat, char-

acter-driven stories, which are
not necessarily perceived as
commercial, it's very difficult.
Also, it is harder as a woman. I
don't make a big deal about
that, but it just is. It's probably
a gross generalization, but
most women want to tell
human stories and are not
particularly interested in that

(action-oriented) kind of violence, which makes it
even harder."
Still, with a National Endowment for the Human
ities grant and several projects in the works, the odds
arc slowly tilting in Makepeace's favor as she keeps
driving towards her dream J|

opening to her latest film, "Night Driving," almost as
if the girl, Tan, and her partner, Daddy, are conspiring
to destroy the ideal American family. Makepeace dis
agrees, saying, "Her looking into the family through
the windows is a longing, because what she imagines
inside is all the great food they're eating and the clean
sheets and the various toys people are playing with.
Her imagination conjures up a life that she thinks she
wants. When she goes inside to steal things, those are
like tokens or trophies or icons of what she sees as this
life that she wants. It's not so much that she's going in
to destroy, it's that she's taking for herself some little
bit of the American dream.
"Now Daddy is another kettle of fish altogether.
He's grown up in the 'I-eave it to Beaver' household
and he knows that there's dysfunction in every family.
Plus, he's just been thrown outside of any ability to live
a normal life by his experiences in the war. One of the
major themes is the wound of the Vietnam War, that
all of the lives in that movie have been created or very
profoundly affected by the Vietnam War."
The film is told from Tan's point of view, but it in
corporates stock footage from the Vietnam War,
which Tan seems too young to remember. "We debat
ed about whether putting a date on there, because the
story was written in 1985, and really, it should be set
in 1985.... The last Amerasian babies could have
been born in 1973, but that still means that they
would be 20 now.
"I did avoid showing any signs of anything after
'88, I think. There are no cars in the movie that are
dated later than that." The anachronism doesn't dc-

stroy "Night Driving"; in fact, it actually gives the film
an eerie disconnectedness from reality, £ la "Jacob's
I-adder," another Vietnam-influenced film.
Having attended Stanford during the '60s, it isn't
surprising that Makepeace, like Oliver Stone and oth
ers, is still haunted by the spectre of Vietnam. After
graduating with a bachelor's in English in 1969, she
stayed on to receive a master's in education in 1971.
Makepeace taught drama, English and filmmaking for
the next eight years, at which point she returned to the
Farm for the graduate program in film.
Her hour-long thesis project, "Moonchild," was
shot and edited over the next few years. Finally com
pleted in 1982, it tells the true story of one person's in
doctrination into the Moonies cult and their subse
quent deprogramming. "I really made it as an educa
tional film to show in schools and colleges as a warn
ing so people wouldn't get involved with groups like
that without knowing what they were getting into."
The success of "Moonchild" came as somewhat of
a surprise to Makepeace. It was broadcast on HBO
and PBS; in addition, the film received numerous
prizes and awards. "It was pretty great for my first
film," she says. "1 sort of thought everything was set."
But it didn't turn her into an overnight sensation.
"I've been struggling ever since," Makepeace admits.
"Certainly, I've had some successes, but it has never
been easy."
"Night Driving" might help to change all that — it's
been selected for showing at the San Jose Film Festival.

Her husband wrote a collection
of stories tided "Night Dri
ving," one of which became the
jumping-off point for the film.
"The film is quite different from
the short story. Basically, what I
took from my husband's story
was the two leads — the Daddy
character and the girl, Tan. I
was really affected by these two

drifting lost souls. I guess I created the whole idea of
her longing for some idealized family and not really
not considering her life, the way it was, of value.
"For me, the story is about claiming your own life,
as chaotic and weird and unconventional as it looks.
That people who you're with or who care for you are
your family."
Tan leirns this the hard way. When she and Daddy
are caught by the police, the authorities turn her over
to a devoutly religious family. It seems that this is

about claiming your own
life, as chaotic and weird

Tan's big break, that she's finally found the nuclear
ideal that she seeks, but she ends up running away to
rejoin Daddy.
"I guess what she realizes when she's sort of locked
inside this house is that it isn't the dream that she had.
It's not this wonderfully comfortable and liberating
thing; in fact, it exacts its own pound of flesh. Basical
ly she becomes nostalgic for the freedom of the road,
as chaotic as it was. She misses the Daddy figure and
she's feeling very pinched in by her tight dress and the
mother's fantasy about what she's supposed to be."
The film also touches on the racist aspects of the
Fast-West dynamic. "She (Tan) has had a fantasy that
her real father lives in a place like this and maybe this
could be her father. Why not? When she brings that up
in the living room and says 'You could be my real dad,'
he says, 'I'm not that kind of guy,' meaning 'I wouldn't
sleep with Vietnamese girls,' which he probably did.
That's a very hurtful thing he says to her."
Makepeace cites Francois Truffaut and Satyajit Ray
as influences, saying, "When I was an undergraduate at
Stanford there were these wonderful film clubs; Tues
day night French films and Wednesday night Italian
films and Thursday night Russian films — it was in
credible. Those foreign films made me see that you
could look at the world in a very different way than the
1 lollywood mainstream did."
Her penchant for things outside the mainstream
won't endear her to the Tinseltown machine. "If
you're like me, interested in somewhat offbeat, char-

acter-driven stories, which are
not necessarily perceived as
commercial, it's very difficult.
Also, it is harder as a woman. I
don't make a big deal about
that, but it just is. It's probably
a gross generalization, but
most women want to tell
human stories and are not
particularly interested in that

(action-oriented) kind of violence, which makes it
even harder."

ities grant and several projects in the works, the odds
arc slowly tilting in Makepeace's favor as she keeps
driving towards her dream J|

Imagine Ward, June, Wally and the Beaver home
alone in suburbia after another of June's delicious
meals. Ward sits in front of the television watching
something or other, while June does the dishes, then
goes upstairs to get ready for bed. Ward hears a noise
in another room and goes to investigate. As he does
so, a Vietnamese girl who's been spying on them
through their open curtains slips into the house, takes
the remote control and exits. When Ward comes back
to the television room, the girl points the remote at
the house and channel surfs to her heart's content. Be
fore Ward can figure out what's going on, she and her
partner — a middle-aged Nordic type — jump into
their car and speed away into the night. Poor Ward
never knew what hit him.
