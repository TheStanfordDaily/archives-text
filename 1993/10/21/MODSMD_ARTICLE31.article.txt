# Views from the shadows
## Belly's Gail Greenwood 
### Janar Stewart 
just got back from working out
I and I'm semi-naked," pipes
A. bassist Gail Greenwood of Belly,
one of Rhode Island's oh-so-abundant claims
to fame. Kicking back in a high-class Detroit
hotel, Greenwood has just run six miles on
her favorite amenity, the treadmill.
Little pleasures, however, come much less
frequently now that three singles from the
group's debut album, "Star," and their accom
panying videos are in heavy rotation. Belly
has face-planted in the flip side of fame.
"We don't feel it as much as (frontperson)
Tanya (Donelly) does, at all," Greenwood says
of herself and brothers Tom and Chris Gor
man, the group's second guitarist and drum
mer. "Fame, for [Tanya], is a weird thing. She
started playing guitar because she was a lone
ly nerd. The next thing you know you're in
fashion magazines, a pop songstress and all
this. It's definitely a weird thing.
"1 never get recognized. People think I'm a
roadie. I can go to the mall, no problem. The
one time Tanya goes to the mall with a big zit,
someone recognizes her. Thank God I'm so
anonymous-looking."
Not surprisingly, while Greenwood and
the guys relax, Donelly stays in New York to
model boxer shorts for Spin magazine. "She
doesn't even get the shorts. I guess they're re
ally nice boxer shorts," Greenwood muses.
While Greenwood has little desire to bor
row Donelly's boxers, she and the other band
members also face publicity pressures. "You
have to have these meet-and-greets after a
show, with the local radio people, who may
add a song to their playlist. (Once) there was
one station that was a CHR, a major Top 40
station. The guy was just a regular, goofy
looking DJ — you know, all like, 'Hey,' " she
mocks in a Velveeta, lounge-lizard voice.
"They're trying to capitalize on 'goin' al
ternative' by throwing us a bone and on Mon
day night having a show for two hours where
they feature alternative music," she contin
ues. "We're gonna be one of the first bands to
be played on it, so we're supposed to kiss his
ass and say, 'Oh my God, I can't believe you're
adding us to your playlist.'
"Of course, we didn't," Greenwood laughs,
quick to add that the band was careful not to
dis the radio folk. "You saw that [alternative
music] is sort of becoming mainstream. Now
[radio stations are] thinking there's a cash
value attached to it, so they add an alternative
show Monday night. They're not making the
leap of faith to have the whole station incor
porate these types of songs. They're kind of
test-marketing it and seeing if it will work."
Another frustration surfaces wheo bands
attempt to earn money from sources outside
of record and concert ticket sales, she adds. In
fact, selling band paraphernalia at some
venues nearly defeats clearing a profit. "If you
sell t-shirts, the club takes 33 percent, which
makes you look like a loser because you have
to charge a certain amount for your shirts to

break even. And then [the club owners]
charge you tax on top of that," Greenwood
says.
Even the video-making process falls prey
to the machinery of the industry. When creat
ing videos from songs, for instance, Belly
can't just hire whomever they want.
"The record company always wants to
spend tons of money. We wish we could do
something for $20,000 and then it ends up
costing $85,000," Greenwood says. "To para
phrase Tanya, that would feed two families for
two years and [the video is] an advertisement
for a song. That's kind of hard lo come to
terms with [Videos are] a business
That's kind of sickening, but apparently that's
how they do it."
Originally, the band had hoped to keep
their videos close to home by hiring a director
and actors from Rhode Island, but Warner
Bros.' tendency to hire well-known directors
eventually won out. Despite any problems
Belly may have had with the process, the
group has scored with their latest director,
Randy Skinner ("Gepetto" and "Slow Dog").
"We got to present the treatment for the

latest video, 'Gepetto.' We haven't had anyone
tell us we've got to wear tight pants," she says.
"[Skinner is] definitely really cool and trusts
the band's judgment."
Taking into account Donelly's imagery
laden lyrics, Skinner made a wise decision, in
deed. Take "Slow Dog," for example — "Heal
me by the river / Man retires his wife says but
she was so sad / And sick / His heart breaks in
the mud / Thought I'd leave this world by 21."
All those who feel confident enough to in
terpret this, say "Aye."
Though some of Donelly's songs appear
cryptic, it is precisely their uniqueness, en
twined with haunting melodies and textured
guitar work, that makes Belly stand-out.
Greenwood, who joined the group after
the record was made, agrees. "The thing
about Belly that really attracted me was that I
really couldn't peg it as a so-called alternative
band," she says. "Tanya's lyrics are definitely
off-the-wall and I don't think they fit in with
the standard easy listening, VH-1 format."
Greenwood made the leap from her al
ready-broken-up hardcore punk band, Bone
yard, to Belly despite promises to herself that

her next band would be metal.
Even more telling, Greenwood, a long
time guitar player, picked up a bass for the
first time ever only one week before her first
Belly concert. "I was a nervous wreck," she
admits. "I remember them saying, 'Aw, it's
just gonna be like two or three hundred peo
ple' and [the show] kept selling out and they
had to keep moving the venue to a bigger
place. It was really, really frustrating.
"I was nervous and I said a lot of really stu
pid things on stage," Greenwood says, adding
that her edginess had her reverting to her
punk presentation. "I totally forgot where I
was. There were some heckles and I was heck
ling back."
Yet Greenwood's stage presence spices up
an otherwise tame live performance. While
she struts across the stage, bobbing her head
to the beat, Tom Gorman stands like an oak
tree, his fingers flitting up and down the frets.
"He's like the stable dad. He's a perfection
ist. ... That's the difference between the two
of us. He will play note for note, verbatim per
fect, and he very rarely fucks up," Greenwood
says. "Initially, I was worried, 'Am I jumping
around like a friggin' idiot? Am I detracting
from the band?'
"I'm smiling like an idiot and the song's
about a heroin-addicted rape victim. I'm like,
'Am I trashing the integrity of the song?' "
Not hardly, considering that Greenwood's
stage antics actually have encouraged Donelly
to hop around a bit more. Now at a concert,
there's a progression of energy increasing from
potential on the right to kinetic on the left.
Perhaps the youngest fans best summarize
the band's diversity: "Very young boys, maybe
like 12 or 10, go to thein-store record signings
... just as sweet as can be, hand-shaking, eyes
totally watery. They want to marry Tanya,
they want her to be their mother.
"I think Tanya gets the marriage proposal
situation, you know, 'I love you, Tanya,' " she
mocks in a Jersey car mechanic voice. "And I
get, 'You rock!'"
And rock they will after the eight-month
tour finally ends. The band members, who
have jammed together only whenever they
could squeeze it into sound check, will pull
out their four tracks and begin the writing
process this winter.
"We're hoping that this winter we can get
our own space where we can just go and play
and jam out things. I know Tanya has never
written that way before. She's always written
and then presented it to a group.
"[Recording will] be interesting," she says,
adding that the band hopes to have their next
album out by summer.
Maybe next time around, Belly will ditch
the silk boxers and Spin for a tiger-stripe
teddy and a Rolling Stone cover.®

Belly will appear on Oct. 24 at the Warfield,
982 Market St., San Francisco. For more infor
