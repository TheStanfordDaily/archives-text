# The 						world according to SPIKE

I still consider 'Do the Right Thing' to be your best s
overall film. '
I think 'Malcolm X' is. ;
You still think 'Malcolm X' is? How well do you think <
'Do the Right Thing' holds up? •
Now? Better than 'Driving Miss Daisy,' which won 1
Best Picture that year. (Laughs). No, that film's gonna
stand the test of time. I feel that.
Yeah, we just watched it in my screenwriting class the
other day.
Oh, they showed it in your screenwriting class?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah, definitely.

In 1982, a skinny caricature of a young man won the
student Academy Award for his New York University
thesis film, "Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut
1 leads," a witty, flavorful look at a Brooklyn barber

who gets caught up with a sophisticated gent of
a gangster. He followed with "She s

Gotta Have It," which told the
story of a highly sexed woman and
her three men, one of whom was a
skinny caricature of a B-Boy named
Mars Blackmon. This energetic first

feature made writer-director-produc
er-actor Spike Lee a household name
and officially launched the Black New
Wave in the process.

He could have gone on playing Mars
forever and made a killing, but he shot a
black college musical-melodrama instead.

"School Daze," another financial success,
spurred black students to attend black institu-

tions and spawned a new dance craze, Da
Butt." But its less-than-stellar reviews implied
that Spike had succumbed to sophomoritis. He
told them to kiss his black ass two times and kept

on trucking.
In 1989, he dropped the bomb. "Do the Right

Thing" chronicled a day in the life of a block in
Brooklyn that culminates in a race riot. Spike starred
as a shiftless negro named Mookie, the one character
who most whites identify with, until — pushed to re
spond to the murder of his friend by New York's finest
— he throws a garbage can through the window of a
pizzeria, prompting a street full of angry black and Lati
-110 youths to burn it down. Some whites identified so
closely with the Italian pizzeria owner that they felt
Mookie had betrayed his boss; and that Spike, in turn,

had betrayed them. The film's coda, a Martin Luther
King quote on non-violence, did little to soothe white
f ears — Spike followed it with a quote from Malcolm X
on violence as intelligent self-defense.

Everyone has taken Spike seriously since then. Love
or hate the rest of his work ("Mo' Better Blues," "Jungle
Fever," "Malcolm X"), there's no denying that his is a
major talent. He has inspired many others: Mario van
Peebles, Matty Rich and, most notably, "Boyz N the
Hood" director John Singleton have all gotten behind
the camera in the wake of his success. Singleton may
have outgrossed him, Julie Dash might have taken over
the art house, the Hughes brothers may be more
"street," but they've got nothing on Spike. He's the
master.
His latest film, "Crooklyn," is due in theaters next

summer. True to form, the merchandise is already
available. "It all takes place in the early '70s, and it s
about a group of kids growing up," he says. "So it's a
children's film; at the same time, I think it's a film that
adults will greatly identify with." The first script that
he's written collaboratively, he penned "Crooklyn"
with brother Cinque and sister Joie. Ever the promoter,
he spells their names out to make sure I get it right.
The 1970s are a far cry from Spike's contemporary,
hip-hop-influenced cinema, but he doesn't regret set
ting his Harlem-Brooklyn-Bensonhurst mean streets
aside for the moment. "I like hip-hop," he says,
"but I don't like this motherfuckin'

gangsta rap bullshit. I mean, I did
not grow up — and I

Cf I
know a whole lot
of other

African-
Americans — did

not grow up calling black
women bitches and hoes. 'Suck my

dick,' 'I'm gonna get mine,' brandishing <
guns. ... To me, just because you have a gun that's re- |
ally not a sign of being hard.
"And shooting other black people definitely isn't a
sign of being hard. I mean, these guys think they're
gangstas, but they're like, they ain't assassinating no
heads of state." He laughs, a low chuckle that suits his
black nebbish persona. "I'm not tryin' to sound like
fuckin' Tipper Gore, but I feel the shit's gone too far,
and I don't care if it's not fashionable, I'm gonna speak
out against it. A lot of these brothers are just plain
motherfuckin' ignorant. What kind of fuckin' song is 'I
Want A Gangsta Bitch?' C'mon."
Pausing, he returns to his infomercial, already in
progress. "One of the things that people are really
gonna like about 'Crooklyn' is the great music we have
in it. The film takes place in the early '70s, which many

people consider the golden age, you know, of black
R&B and soul. We have people like Jimi Hendrix,
Aretha Franklin, James Brown, The Stylistics, The Chi-
Lites, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Freda Payne,
The Isleys, Marvin Gaye, Al Green, Stevie Wonder
I mean to me, this is music."
Music has always been integral to the Spike Lee
Joint. Jazz, R&B and hip-hop, John Coltrane, Sam
Cooke and Public Enemy, all blend seamlessly into his
aesthetic. As a connoisseur of good music, it shouldn t
come as a surprise that he worries about recent musical
trends. "You know how everybody plays their instru
ments now? One finger on the synthesizer. You wanna
play a trumpet or piano or horn or guitar? All you need
is a fuckin' index finger. I'm sorry, that ain t

learnin'. " I le chuckles again, then imitates a
synthetic-sounding trumpet to prove

his point.

So let's make our own movies
like Spike Lee
'Clause the roles being offered
don't strike me

There's nothing that the
black man could use to earn

Burn Hollywood burn
— Public Enemy, "Burn
Hollywood Burn"

If gangsta culture has
dominated hip-hop, it maybe
just a matter of time before it
does the same to black film.

v With every passing day, it
L seems that any young black

male with a camera, three or
four rappers in lead roles and
a screenplay packed with
senseless black-on-black vi-

olence can get a movie deal.
That's a game Spike won't

play. "I think that stuff is
played out. I'm not making a

r /
comment on individual films, but

there's a lot, though. It's a genre. Like 'New

Jack City,' 'Boy/. N the I lood,' 'Straight Out of Brook
lyn,' 'Juice,' 'Menace II Society,' 'Strapped,' 'Trespass,'
'Deep Cover,' 'Just Another Girl on the IRIY 'South
Central.'
"That is not the entirety of the African-American ex
perience in this country, and one of the worst things to
ever happen to blacks is gangsta rap. I'm sorry, but I'm
gonna tell the truth on that. This gangsta rap is really in
fluential on the type of films Hollywood wants to make
and the type of films black filmmakers want to make."
But if that's true, why is Spike involved in negotia
tions with Martin Scorsese's production company to
write and direct an adaptation of Richard Price's novel
"Clockers?"
"If I do 'Clockers,' the only reason is so it'll be the

final exclamation point on the genre. Let's close the
book. None of this gangsta, New Jack, 'hood,
ghetto film. Move on. That'll be my only reason

for doing it." He's got a point. The book —
which alternates between the story of a 19-
year-old crack dealer whose brother confesses
to murder and an aging police officer who's con
vinced the dealer is the killer — is a perceptive ac

count of life on Jersey's streets that could give the genre
a fitting funeral.
Never one to get trapped by ghettocentricity, Spike
is one of the few filmmakers to consistently document
the lives of the black middle-class; most notably with
"Jungle Fever," which contrasted the life of an upscale
black architect with that of a working-class Italian sec
retary. Concerning these middle-class films, he says,
"That's just my upbringing. We weren't bourgie; we
were starvin' like Marvin, but I guess we had the mid
dle-class mentality." He quickly adds, "Not the bour
geoisie mentality." Like many black people, Spike finds
it important to distinguish bourgeoisie from middle
class, since bourgie implies that one's nose is in the air.
Walking the tightrope between the two isn't easy, but
he hasn't fallen off it yet.

You're blind baby! You're blind from the facts of

who you are 'cause you watchin' that

garbage!

— Public Enemy, "She
Watch Channel Zero"

Spike gets an
irnated when the con
versation switches to

other black person
alities, namely Toni

Morrison and
Whoopi Goldberg.
His production
company,

Forty Acres and a
Mule, optioned Morri-

son's novel "Sula" long be

fore she won the Nobel Prize.

"I would just like to say it's a
disgrace that some black men
have gone on record doggin'
out Toni Morrison. Number
one being Stanley Crotch,
and..
, And Charles Johnson, it is
' offered.
"Yeah, I called up Charles

Johnson. He said that they
took out all his positive com
ments about Toni Morrison. I

long for the day when we as
people get rid of this slave mental
ity, this crabs-in-a-barrel mentali-

ty. We should be happy that Toni
Morrison won. How the fuck can

Stanley Crotch say that "Beloved" is a
fraud. What novel has Stanley Crotch writ-

ten?
"I know his name is Crouch, but I call him

f Crotch. What novel has he written? That mother
fucker ain't done shit but sit back and criticize peo
ple. You know, he got a MacArthur grant, which they
call a 'genius grant,' but for what? No one said shit
when he got that grant. He ain't done shit! I'm happy
Toni Morrison won. I don't see it as a knock against
black men. I think she's a great novelist. And all those
motherfuckers talkin' shit, she should tell 'em to kiss
her black ass two times, because she deserves it. And
then Charles Johnson, he was talkin' about, what was
that lady's name? Joyce Olson...

Joyce Carol Gates?
"Well what the fuck does she have to do with Toni
Morrison. He's gonna say what, Joyce Carol Gates
should have won instead of her? C'mon."
Whoopi Goldberg's name comes up. Spike was one
of the first people to question Whoopi's blackness, per
haps due to her penchant for blue contact lenses, white
men and changing her name. So only halfway through
a question asking Spike about Goldberg, he

says, "She's pathetic." Pressed further on

his reaction to the Friar's Club
scandal (where during

Whoopi's roast, Ted

Danson came out
in blackface),

he says,
" I

' just
think

that ..
it'samaz

ing that
... T wo

words have
been in every

single one of my
films. You know
what those words

are?"
Wake up?
"Wake up. And I

' think there really should
be more of an uproar from
the black community. I

think that we as a people — I'm not trying to exempt
myself, either — but African-Americans let African-
American artists do whatever the hell they want. And
we never call 'em on it. And 1 definitely think Whoopi
Goldberg needs to be called on this by black people.
How do you do this to an artist? Well, you say 'Fuck
you, I'm not gonna buy your record, I'm not gonna go
see your movie.' "
That isn't enough, though. Spike is genuinely con
fused and angered by Whoopi's behavior. "Does she
love white people so much that she's gonna let her lover
put fuckin' blackface on, and then use the word 'nigger'
20 times, have jokes about givin' head and fucking and
all this other stuff and say it's just a joke? I las she no
sense of history? What the fuck? If this doesn't confirm
what I've been saying all along about her, I don't know
what will. Then when she sees me she asks me howcome
I don't use her in my movies? Shit, you don't got a clue,
Whoopi? HELLO?"
There was a small controversy on campus over bring
ing you back to Stanford, because it would cost three times
as much for you as it did for Paul Tsongas. Is that fair?
Who?
Paul Tsongas.
Is what fair?

That there would be a controversy over how much you
were getting paid as opposed to how much Paul Tsongas
was getting paid?
Paid? Look, you get what the market can bear. Chris
Mullin ain't gonna get the same type of money Michael
Jordan gets. (Laughs).
Do you go to Stanford?
I do.
What year arc you?
I'm cf senior.
Where am I gonna be speakin' at?
You're gonna be speaking at Memorial Auditorium,
which is the largest auditorium on campus.
How many does that seat?
Pardon?
How many does that seat?
171X).
Yeah?
Yeah.
You think it's gonna be sold out?
I think so.
I hope so.
Spike likes speaking to college audiences, in part for
very practical reasons. "They make up a large part of
the audience that goes to see my films." He's got an ul
terior motive for coming to speak at Stanford, but not
what you might expect. "I want to meet Bill Walsh," he
says. "Print that. I want to get a signed ball from Bill
Walsh."
The last time Spike spoke at Stanford, some black
students felt that he called them out for not attending
black colleges. He disagrees. "I'm not gonna call out
anybody when they're able to get an education. A lot
of times African American students want to go to a
black institution, but sometimes they're not able to
get the same financial aid they might get from white
institutions. So I say get an education wherever you
can get it.
"But... I feel there arc some things you get at a black
school, there's a nurturing that you just can't get at a
white institution. Now I don't think that it's any coin
cidence that almost all of the great African-American
leaders have been graduates of predominantly black in
stitutions. That's not a coincidence. That's not a freak
accident."
Spike provides similar nurturing to up-and-coming
directors of color, including Wendell B. Harris
("Chameleon Street") and Nick Gomez ("I.aws of
Gravity"). "This is something I've always wanted to do,
it's just that 1 didn't have the ways and means. Now I do.
I've always been sort of like a conduit for young talent.
Now we're just trying to do the same thing for direc
tors."
He's happy that he isn't alone out there anymore,
because this adds to the diversity of black film. "My
films cannot satisfy every single African-American
in the country. That's what people need to under
stand — we arc not one monolithic group. We need
many different voices, and no one filmmaker can
satisfy everybody's need. When you do that then
you're playing down to the lowest common denom
inator."
But Spike isn't going out like that. And that's the
triple truth, Ruth. ■
Spike Lee will speak at Memorial Auditorium tonight at 7:30
p. m. His speech will be simulcast on SCBN.
