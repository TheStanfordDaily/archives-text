# Holiday cheer lost
## The 						making of a Disney monster: The Nightmare Before Christmas' 
### 
Tim Burton and the Walt Disney Corpora
tion formulate entertainment in entirely con
tradictory manners.
Burton starts with an original idea —
sometimes bizarre ("Frankenwecnie"), some
times brilliant ("Pee-Wee's Big Adventure")
— and then uses the contours and facets of

that idea to, eventually, create a movie. If the
product is popular, like "Batman," great; if it is
not, like the "Amazing Stories" episode "Fam
ily Dog," so be it.
Disney, however, starts with the finished
product. They don't think of an idea, they de
rive a sellable concept. They first consider what

the audience's reaction to the movie will be,
then proceed to fill in the integral elements of
plot and style, generally in accordance with the
time-honored formulas that have made the
company untold fortunes. While an occasion
al over-thc-top performance (say, Robin
Williams' in "Aladdin") may edge a Disney
film toward inventiveness, there's always a
cool, businesslike sentiment behind any of the
company's productions.
With this in mind, it is no surprise that
"The Nightmare Before Christmas," a collab
oration between Burton and his old Disney
employers, is a remarkably uneven film. Par
ticular elements of the film are gripping, such
as the craftsmanship inherent in its stop-ac
tion filming. But something is missing, the
something that is absent from most Disney
productions. For all the effort, care, skill and
dedication that went into "The Nightmare
Before Christmas," the film is cold, dry and
unmoving — heartless.
This desiccation is all the more unfortunate
because of the potentially intriguing charac
ters Burton creates for "Nightmare." Among
these personages is Jack Skellington, the
"Pumpkin King" of Halloweentown. In "the
holiday worlds of old," every holiday has its
own production facility (remember, it's a Dis
ney film), and Jack is the undisputed master of
ante-All Saints' Day. Unfortunately, after years
of candy corn and pumpkin pie, Skellington
acquires a massive case of ennui.
Until, that is, he catches a glimpse of
Christmasland and decides to stage a benign
coup de etat. After kidnapping Santa Claus,
Jack and the residents of Halloweentown at
tempt to stage a Christmas celebration to end

all Christmas celebrations. Unfortunately,
that may be the unintended effect of Jack's
machinations.
IfTim Burton had been allowed to take his
concept and run with it, perhaps there would
be more to the movie than this mere skeleton
(chuckle, chuckle) of a plot. But it appears that
Disney allowed Burton control only over the
film's visual aspects, while siccing one of their
hack scriptwriters (in this case Caroline
Thompson) onto the plot.
The result is a movie in which every single
joke or nuance is expressed visually, rather
than in the script. By my count, there were no
written jokes within the film's 74 minutes. Not
one. But it does have an Unnecessary Roman
tic Interest, Token Bad Guy, Rascally Yet Lov
able Imps and, as a special Disney bonus,
Showtunes A' Plenty. And they're not even
good showtunes; Danny Elfman apparently
confused "Nightmare" with "Newsies."
The stop-action filiming, however, is seam
less. Director I lenry Selick makes every move
ment fluid, breathing life into characters such
as the literally two-faced town mayor, the
patchwork moll Sally, trick-or-treaters Lock,
Shock and Barrel and the Orkin man's night
mare, the bug-infested villian Oogic Boogie.
There arc definately things to recommend
about "The Nightmare Before Christmas."
Certain jokes are morbidly spellbinding. The
film is visually stunning. Finally, there's some
thing to say about any film with Halloween,
not Christmas, as the setting for holiday cheer.
But "Nightmare" is by no means the film it
could have been. Once again, Disney has sold
its soul for a Burger King tie-in.

good showtunes; Danny Elfman apparently
confused "Nightmare" with "Newsies."
The stop-action filiming, however, is seam
less. Director I lenry Selick makes every move
ment fluid, breathing life into characters such
as the literally two-faced town mayor, the
patchwork moll Sally, trick-or-treaters Lock,
Shock and Barrel and the Orkin man's night
mare, the bug-infested villian Oogic Boogie.
There arc definately things to recommend
about "The Nightmare Before Christmas."
Certain jokes are morbidly spellbinding. The
film is visually stunning. Finally, there's some
thing to say about any film with Halloween,
not Christmas, as the setting for holiday cheer.
But "Nightmare" is by no means the film it
could have been. Once again, Disney has sold
its soul for a Burger King tie-in.
