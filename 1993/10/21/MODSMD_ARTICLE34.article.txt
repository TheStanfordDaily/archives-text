## Judgment Night 
### 
There are various ways to describe a film
like "Judgment Night," but if 1 had to choose
between "It was bad" and"It sucked like an
industrial Hoover," I would be forced to se
lect the latter passage.
What we have are some fresh-out-of-ado
lescence and soon-to-be-balding good guys
from comfy suburbia (played by a chubby
Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr., Stephen
Dorff and Jeremy Piven) who take a wrong
turn on the way to a boxing match and end
up in an urban wasteland presided over by
Fallon (Dennis Leary) and his band of grimy
henchmen.

After witnessing
Fallon dispatch a re
markably resilient
victim (shot twice
and close to death
when we first meet
him, he survives long
enough to allow Fal
lon to make abstract
artwork of his head),
the quartet are relent
lessly pursued around
the Chicago projects,
defending themselves

with a combination of cunning, bullets, iron
bars and twigs.
The acting is thoroughly pedestrian.
Gooding Jr. spends large tracts of this film
with his eyes and mouth suspended open in
an expression which is presumably supposed
to be a cut-price way of showing fear, horror,
disbelief and anger. And he never flexes his fa
cial muscles. In addition Estevez displays his
lack of talent to a degree that might even cause
embarrassment to the rest of his family.
During the chase sequences (which always
begin with Leary using his remarkable hear
ing to locate the only-just-escaped-the-last
situation good guys ), we never have any idea
of where the respective groups are relative to
each other. This results in a total lack of any
thing even remotely approaching suspense.
The director, Stephen Hopkins, manages
to squeeze more clich£d trash into 109 min
utes than was previously thought possible.
Before the merciful ending, we've had a
"You're not worth it!"; a "Go to hell — Al
ready there"; a "We've gotta make a stand"
speech; a lingering, ominous shot of a gun;
and a bad guy killing one of his own men to
show that he is truly f/iebad guy. In addition,
Hopkins probably expected us to whoop
with delight every time he included a shot of
running shadows on city walls rather than
the people themselves.

What creative genius, Stephen, quel
artiste! We await your next production with
bated breath.
