# Rudy

### 
Another whoopee-the-underdog-won
story with predictable plotting, "Rudy" is a
film so packed with melodrama you almost
want to laugh at the crass sentimentalism An
gclo Pizzo and David Anspaugh, (the team
responsible for "Hoosiers") try to pass off as
drama; and I'm not saying this because Notre
Dame walked all over us a few weeks ago.
The film's main flaw lies in its title charac
ter, Rudy, who has no dimension to his life
other than wanting to attend Notre Dame
and play football. Played by Sean Astin, Rudy
is an ingenuous go-getter, a kind-hearted
runt with no athletic talent. Worse still, he
seems completely opaque.
For instance, his sacrifices — leaving his
dad's job, his girlfriend, living on his own —
to attain his foolish-sounding dreams don't
seem to be particularly painful adjustments
— they're just minor plot points that Rudy
seems to hurdle with seeming indifference.
The problem is: Where's the drama?
The drippy directing doesn't help much ei

ther. Throughout the film Notre Dame is built
up as some sort of holy institution attended
by ethereal beings, and when Anspaugh final
ly pans over the place, he treats it like God
Himself were residing there, using slow-mo
tion pans and a soft haze that'd make a Cal
cutta outhouse look pretty good.
The film also includes the standard equip
ment found in most American underdog
films: the kindly priest, the steelworking dad
who harrumphs and grunts, the brother who
thinks his younger brother's a dumb pud, the
black custodian who gives the final pep talk
and so on. It's all so predictable and unexcit
ing that you watch things happen on screen
but you're left wondering if there's a story or
real character buried somewhere under the
morass of cliches and happy resolutions.
