# Oblivious melodies
## Disney's flat-tasting homage to Annette, an all-American air head 
### 
The year 1959 marked the golden age of
Tupperware, TV dinners and polyester cloth
ing. Ike was in the White Mouse and the Cadil
lac Coupe de Ville had grown to monstrous
proportions. Thousands of preadolescent
girls thrilled to a brand-new role model — the
Barbie doll — blonde, busty and plastic.
It was a wonderful time to be young, mid
dle class, white and withdrawn.
1959 also saw the record debut of Annette
Funicello, like the Barbie doll a busty, plastic
role model for preadolescents across the
country. Her January, 1959 album broke into
the Billboard charts, with the cut "Tall Paul"
reaching number seven.
In a wave of nostalgia, Walt Disney
Records has now released its tribute to the
terminally perky brunette — "Annette: A
Musical Reunion with America's Girl Next
Door," a two-compact disc (47 songs, 113
minutes) collection of Annette's recordings,
spanning from her 1959 debut to the end of
her singing-star days in 1965.
The packaging is beautiful. A toothy pic
ture of Funicello smiles back at you from the
pastel-colored, cardboard box. The liner
notes have the same color scheme, but arc cut
in the shape of an hourglass or Annette's
shapely torso, providing a voyeuristic thrill
with every turn of the page.
Fach page is packed with color pictures of
Annette, usually smiling, her bust jutting for
ward like the prow of a ship. The large-print text,
written at a fourth-grade level, tells how she was
born Oct. 22, 1942 in Utica, N.Y. and debuted
on "The Mickey Mouse Club" Oct. 3, 1955.

After the show ended, the notes tell how
"Uncle Walt" Disney kept Annette around and
started her singing career, which led into a se
ries of "beach party" movies and her retire
ment in 1965. For those who find the notes too
complex, the Disney company has printed key
words in a different color and font, creating a
sort of poem:".. .'the good girl'.. .goofy stuff
... young 10ve... joyride...
Musically, the set is an abomination. An
nette's voice is like marsh mallow fluff and the
lyrics to her songs are asinine. For example,
in the hit "Tall Paul" she sings: "He's my
mountain /1 le's my tree /We go steady /Paul
and me." The liner notes even tell how "the
limitations of her teenage voice" were cured
"by recording her vocals twice, the second
time with large amounts of echo thrown in."
To justify this process, author Joe Rhodes
notes that Connie Francis and Shelley
Fabares later used the same process.
While the background musicians on many
of the tracks are obviously competent, their
talent is wasted on a brand of rock-and-roll
Muzak without any soul. Fverything is shiny
and happy and — overwhelmingly — silly.
What is worst about Annette's music,
however, is how painfully inconsequential it
is. Listening to each two-minute song, you
get lost in a world of Barbie and convenience
foods, high-school pins and beach parties.
There is no hint in Annette's music that
the southern states are being torn apart by
questions of racial segregation or that Fidel
Castro has seized power in Cuba or that
Francis Gary Powers has crashed his spy

plane in the USSR.
Not every song
needs to be socially
aware; indeed,
good-time music
can serve an im
portant role. But
Annette's music re
minds one only of
how unaware
white, middle-class
1959 culture could
be. Everything is
good times and gig
gles and comfort.
Neither the music
nor the lyrics are
challenging.
Listening to An
nette, one would
not know there was
communism or the
Cold War, poverty
or segregation.
Sure, your toes may
tap, but toes are
stupid things, toes
have no brain or
soul. In the end,
Annette's music
seems as sadly
withdrawn from
real life as Barbie —
bathing suit, plastic
smile and all.

minutes) collection of Annette's recordings,
spanning from her 1959 debut to the end of
her singing-star days in 1965.
The packaging is beautiful. A toothy pic
ture of Funicello smiles back at you from the
pastel-colored, cardboard box. The liner
notes have the same color scheme, but arc cut
in the shape of an hourglass or Annette's
shapely torso, providing a voyeuristic thrill
with every turn of the page.
Fach page is packed with color pictures of
Annette, usually smiling, her bust jutting for
ward like the prow of a ship. The large-print text,
written at a fourth-grade level, tells how she was
born Oct. 22, 1942 in Utica, N.Y. and debuted
on "The Mickey Mouse Club" Oct. 3, 1955.

After the show ended, the notes tell how
"Uncle Walt" Disney kept Annette around and
started her singing career, which led into a se
ries of "beach party" movies and her retire
ment in 1965. For those who find the notes too
complex, the Disney company has printed key
words in a different color and font, creating a
sort of poem:".. .'the good girl'.. .goofy stuff
... young 10ve... joyride...
Musically, the set is an abomination. An
nette's voice is like marsh mallow fluff and the
lyrics to her songs are asinine. For example,
in the hit "Tall Paul" she sings: "He's my
mountain /1 le's my tree /We go steady /Paul
and me." The liner notes even tell how "the
limitations of her teenage voice" were cured
"by recording her vocals twice, the second
time with large amounts of echo thrown in."
To justify this process, author Joe Rhodes
notes that Connie Francis and Shelley
Fabares later used the same process.
While the background musicians on many
of the tracks are obviously competent, their
talent is wasted on a brand of rock-and-roll
Muzak without any soul. Fverything is shiny
and happy and — overwhelmingly — silly.
What is worst about Annette's music,
however, is how painfully inconsequential it
is. Listening to each two-minute song, you
get lost in a world of Barbie and convenience
foods, high-school pins and beach parties.
There is no hint in Annette's music that
the southern states are being torn apart by
questions of racial segregation or that Fidel
Castro has seized power in Cuba or that
Francis Gary Powers has crashed his spy

plane in the USSR.
Not every song
needs to be socially
aware; indeed,
good-time music
can serve an im
portant role. But
Annette's music re
minds one only of
how unaware
white, middle-class
1959 culture could
be. Everything is
good times and gig
gles and comfort.
Neither the music
nor the lyrics are
challenging.
Listening to An
nette, one would
not know there was
communism or the
Cold War, poverty
or segregation.
Sure, your toes may
tap, but toes are
stupid things, toes
have no brain or
soul. In the end,
Annette's music
seems as sadly
withdrawn from
real life as Barbie —
bathing suit, plastic
smile and all.
