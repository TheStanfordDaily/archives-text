## "A Storm in Heaven" Verve 
### 
If the fickle fans of college rock arc ready
to accept yet another darling, they should
welcome Verve with open arms.
Unlike so many other alternative releases,
Verve's debut, "A Storm in Heaven," falls
under no particular category.
The music has the intensity of grunge, the
dreamy daze of shoe-gaze pop and the atti
tude of glam-rock. Mix those qualities with
some jazzy spurts of horns and old-fash
ioned rock sensibilities and you have a vague
idea of what this British band sounds like.
In short, Verve takes a lot of stuff we've
heard before and creates something new out
of it.
l yrics, for example. When you can under-

stand what foppish
lead singer Richard
Ashcroft is murmur
ing (which is rare),
it's nothing a zillion
other bands haven't
already sung about.
Yet the Mick Jaggcr
look-alike makes the
lyrics work, blend
ing his vocals with
the general sound
scape. And that's the

charm of Verve. No part stands out from the
whole.
Take the album's most intriguing track,
"The Sun, The Sea," as a case in point. The
song begins with a crash of guitar, which mel
lows out into a irresistible rhythm. At the
right time, Ashbury chimes in with his
melodic voice.
Just as the song seems to teeter out, spasms
of horns take the place of the vocals, joining
with the continuous roar of guitar to form a
delicious combination. Just underneath the
sound, the trill of a flute can just be heard,
adding that final touch. Such a synthesis
makes "The Sun, The Sea" not only an inge
nious song, but also a truly beautiful one.
Of course, a strong album like "A Storm in
Heaven" holds plenty of other gems. "Slide
Away" and "Blue" are excellent in their own
right, capturing the energy of "The Sun, The
Sea" without the horns.
The remainder of the album features more
sedate sounds, which beguile just as well as
the dynamic rock songs.
"Star Sail," the album's opener, lulls its lis
tener with clear chords and mumbled lyrics
into a passive state that no Lush song with its
slab of sound could ever do.
The intense blue flame that burns
throughout the 10 tracks finally flickers out
with the pretty piano ballad "See You in the
Next One."
All this means that Verve has what it takes
to be that infamous "Next Big Thing." They

only need a following, which their debut
surely proves they deserve.
