cards for the GRF. and go listen to the new-
Bad Religion release, "Recipe for Hate."
Bad Religion's lyrics manage to turn hard
core into vocabu-core. Over a hard-driving
drum beat and a couple of guitars, lead singer
Greg Graffin spews lyrics like "Every day I
wander / In negative disposition / As I'm
bombarded by superlatives / Realizing very
well / That I am not alone / Introverted / I
look to tomorrow for salvation / But I'm
thinking altruistically."
Uh, what?
But even if you couldn't care less about
Bad Religion's vocab proficiency, the album
still rocks.
Neither of the band's guitarists (Mr. Brett
or Greg Hetson) compare to the late Randy
Rhodes, but they pull guitar riffs off convinc
ingly.
Overall, "Recipe for Hate" sounds vaguely
like a less-distorted version of Ministry's
"Psalm 69."

Bad Religion isn't the most talented band
on earth, but their music rages with energy.
"All Good Soldiers," for instance, has a killer,
electronic-sounding riff that seeps with wild
emotion.
And while the album's sound isn't stereo
typical grunge, guest vocalist Eddie Vedder's
"oozin' aahs" mix easily with the band's vi
cious, hard-core punk style.
On a disappointing note, the intro to
"Man with a Mission" sadly resembles a Bon
Jovi/Motley Crue combo.
Fortunately, the song quickly recovers
from its wanna-be-glam-rock lapse. The
world doesn't need anymore cheesy rock
bands with spandex , hair spray and "my
baby left me" lyrics.
With "Recipe for Hate," Bad Religion
screws the let's-please-the-public-and-make-
MTV attitude, refusing to sell out. The
album's brand of punk revolution pushes the
envelope of musical rebellion, but some lyrics
are rather random: "Kerosene keeps me warm
/ It feels so good / To watch it burn / Kerosene."
These guys are full of deep thoughts.
But that doesn't keep "Recipe for F late" 's 14
tracks from sounding extremely similar. As a
matter of fact, the album practically mimics
the band's previous release "Suffer." If you
liked "Suffer" you can't go wrong with "Recipe
for Hate," but if you're not into hard-core stay
clear — you won't find a "Hip Hop Hooray"
here.
