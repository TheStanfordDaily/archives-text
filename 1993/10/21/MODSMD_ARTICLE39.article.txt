# "Visiting Your Planet" Naked Soul
## 
### 
In a musical world where a band's success
is too often measured by the grunginess of
their clothing and the scruffiness of their fa
cial hair, it's refreshing once in a while to en
counter a group that offers a fresh and natur
al musical style with no additives or preserv
atives.
On "Visiting Your Planet," their first full
length release, the Costa Mesa band Naked
Soul promises and delivers with their hard
edged but uniquely intelligent post-punk
sound.
Naked Soul's greatest advantage is their
ability to fuse a wide and varied range of mu
sical genres — from sources as diverse as
Chet Baker, the Replacements and Smashing
Pumpkins — into a single distinctive style
that encompasses the entire emotional spec
trum.
For example, on "Wound" frontman Mike
Conley leads the band across a mental break
ing point, moving back and forth between
edgy indifference and grating paranoia. Jeff
Sewell on bass and Larry Pearson on drums
use their own expressive power to reinforce
the emotional pattern established by the vo
cals.
The problem with creating effective post
punk pop is, of course, creating the right bal
ance of pop, punk and, er, post — the alter
native/modern rock sound commonly found
among singers such as Michael Penn.
Naked Soul seems to disprove the theory
that you can't combine all three sounds.
Among the 11 tracks on "Visiting Your Plan
et," mellower postmodern-ish tunes like "A
Little More" and the exquisite title track lie
alongside the harder punk sounds of "Heli
copter Man" and "Wound," with most of the
other songs falling somewhere in between.
It's like a good wedding: something old,
something new, something borrowed, some
thing blue — well, at least the cool graphic on
the disc is blue.
Really, though, Naked Soul's music is
more compelling and less pretentious than
the term post-punk pop makes it seem. Let's
just say that an ear for middle-of-the-road
punk, a tolerance for the catchier sounds of
modern rock and a healthy sense of adven
ture should be enough equipment for thor
ough enjoyment of Naked Souls' visit to your
planet.
