# Vacant lot yields treasures, 'hazardous waste' barrels
## 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
Housing and Food Services has
turned a deserted driveway into a
temporary dumpster, luring trea
sure hunters — even though four
of the items there are labeled "haz
ardous waste."
Several students have retrieved
usable items from the site, adjacent
to the old Phi Sig fraternity house
on San Juan Avenue. Armando
Chavez, project coordinator for
Housing and Food Services, said
the site will be used as a holdover
for items removed from renovated
housing until they can be taken to a
landfill.
Objects at the temporary dump
have included couches, stoves, car
peting, box springs and four bar
rels labeled "hazardous waste."
