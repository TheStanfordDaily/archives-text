# Vacant lot yields treasures, 'hazardous waste' barrels
## 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
Housing and Food Services has
turned a deserted driveway into a
temporary dumpster, luring trea
sure hunters — even though four
of the items there are labeled "haz
ardous waste."
Several students have retrieved
usable items from the site, adjacent
to the old Phi Sig fraternity house
on San Juan Avenue. Armando
Chavez, project coordinator for
Housing and Food Services, said
the site will be used as a holdover
for items removed from renovated
housing until they can be taken to a
landfill.
Objects at the temporary dump
have included couches, stoves, car
peting, box springs and four bar
rels labeled "hazardous waste."

Health and Safety officials were
not aware that the barrels were
there, but after checking them
out, assistant director Harvey
Chock said three of the barrels
were empty. A fourth was one
quarter full of "Triple-O, a pretty
common disinfectant used by
Housing and Food Services."
He said he was uncertain how
long the barrels had been there,
adding, "They shouldn't have been
there, but they don't pose any kind
of danger." He said he will follow
up with Housing and Food Ser
vices to find out why the barrels
were dumped where they were.
Chavez, though unaware that
students had been raiding the
dump site, said he was not sur
prised that they had.

One of the students who has

been used as a dumping ground for
years, things really picked up this
