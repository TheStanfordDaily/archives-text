# "VERY" Pet Shop Boys
## 
### 
Your everyday CD jewel box does not do
justice to the highly anticipated Pet Shop
Boys release "VERY." This new disc by
Britain's premier disco duo appropriately
sports an eye-catching orange plastic case,
marking a dramatic departure from their last
full-length effort — the uncharacteristically
gloomy "Behavior."
"VERY" is a successful attempt at turning
'80s electronic disco into a '90s phenome
non. With their synthesized melodies and
catchy beats, the 12 tracks capture many
moods; some playful, others reflective and a
few melancholy.
For example, the first track, titled "Can
You Forgive Her?" tells the humorous story

of a man with a not-so : nice girlfriend. Neil
Tenant taunts: "She's made you / some kind
of laughing stock / because you dance to
disco and you don't like rock / She made fun
/ of you in bed / and said she's gonna get her
self a real man instead."
In contrast, perhaps the most serious song
on "VERY" is "Dreaming of the Queen." In a
fictitious conversation with Queen Elizabeth
and Lady Di, Tenant sings about being too
frightened to love in the age of AIDS: "There
are no more lovers alive / no one has sur
vived. / So there are no more lovers left alive /
that's why love has died / Yes it's true / look
what's happened to me and you."
But the Pet Shop Boys manage to complete
"VERY" on an upbeat note with their
homage to the Village People. The British
group has a knack for remaking other artists'
material, such as U2's "Where the Streets
have no Name" and Willie Nelson's "Always
on my Mind," into wonderfully Pet Shop
Boys-ish tunes. On "Go West," the Boys em
ploy an all-male back-up choir — capturing
the essence of the original song and the spirit
of the Village People.
The Pet Shop Boys no longer fit on alter
native (modern rock) radio, which has be
come synonymous with grunge, nor Top-40
stations, which are eclectically alternative
and hip-hop. Fortunately, "VERY" will un
doubtedly renew loyalty and allegiance
among die-hard PSB fans. And this eccentric,
sometimes-campy, and always non-main
stream British duo promises them on the sur
prise track (number 13) that "We'll meet
again."
We're counting on that.
