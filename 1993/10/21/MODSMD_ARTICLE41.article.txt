# "Suede" Suede
## 
### 
Although MTV's favorite son R.E.M. and
relative newcomers Suede each has its own
distinctive sound, listening to Suede's self-ti
tled debut brings to mind several similarities
between the two alternative groups.
For example, R.E.M. lead singer Michael
Stipe has a strikingly original voice — one
that takes some getting used to. His band's
mix of alternative and pop sounds has only
recently gained wide popularity with the re
leases of "Out of Time" and "Automatic for
the People." Likewise, Suede has a unique
sound, one which may take time to find an
appropriate niche in the music industry. Brett
Anderson's haunting vocals and Bernard But
ler's lead guitar fit together perfectly, a mix
that is both biting and musical at once.
And, like R.E.M., Suede combines unlike
ly elements in creating their songs; their
debut is a combination of Morrissey-in
spired ballads and grinding dance tunes.
"Metal Mickey," the British band's first single
to be released in the United States, is perhaps
the best song on the album, a track that
makes you want to get down and shake every
thing that's shakable.
Perhaps the most noticeable similarity be
tween "Suede" and earlier albums from the
Athens, Ga., boys would be the relative in
comprehensibility of their lyrics. However,
their inclusion in the jewel box allows us to
ponder what exactly "I was born as a pan
tomime horse / Ugly as the sun when he falls
to the floor" means. Hmmmm....
Oh, well. That's what makes Suede so

much fun. It's music you can go crazy to, or
just listen to while you relax and study. I rec
ommend the second option —r the slower
songs are excellent as background-noise for
studying or hanging out with your friends.
What is most admirable about this album,
and the band itself, is its integrity. None of the
songs echo the typical boy-meets-girl rock,
but tend more towards the extremes. Subjects
range from a housewife's Valium addiction to
people with unconventional sexual persua
sions (which are not always unconventional in
the conventional way). Each song is complete
within itself, and when each ends,
we are quite often left wanting
more.

er, "Suede" is an album which in many ways
defies expectation. And although the hud
dled masses may not have heard of them be
fore now, who knew who R.E.M. was in 1983?
