# "Alapalooza" "Weird Al" Yankovic
## 
### 
"Weird Al" Yankovic's newest release "Ala
palooza" sports the kind of tunes one might
imagine as played in the cars of some of the
characters from "Revenge of the Nerds," and
that doesn't mean the jocks. But that is exact
ly what you would expect from Yankovic

- weirdness and, sometimes, hilarity.
"Bedrock Anthem" is an example
of the best ofWeird Al, the kind of ditty
you want to put in a mix for your

friends, not only for its funny lyrics, but
also because it is extremely memorable.
Starting out with the catchy beginning of
the Red Hot Chili Peppers' "Under the
Bridge" and segueing into their more up
beat "Give it Away," the anthem flaunts
lyrics like "1 wanna go to the city of cave
men, the city of Bedrock."
The chorus "Yabba dabba, yabba

dabba do now" is the kind of thing you

listen to once and find wandering

around your head during boring
classes three days later. This

parody ranks up there with
such Weird AJ favorites as
"Eat it"and "Smells Like

Nirvana."
As a matter of fact,
Yankovic seems to pro
duce great tunes as long

as he bases them on songs

that had at least some musical merit before
they were heinously overplayed on the FM
dial. For this reason his rendition of "Bo
hemian Polka" is fabulous; it was a won
derful song once and he makes it so again.
Those who appreciate a good polka or two
will probably be more appreciative than
the rest — but no matter what your views
on polkas usually are, this has to be the
only one in existence to which everybody
and their nephew will know the entire bal
lad.
Other winners on the album include
"Young, Dumb and Ugly" about some
prenatal punk rockers who think they are
"badder" than they actually are, and

"Living in the Fridge," his parody of
Aerosmith's "Living on the Edge."
Technically, this song is put togeth

cr well through the authentic over
lapping of the real and Yankovic
versions.
But it's always important to
remember that some songs are just
too bad to remake. "Achy Breaky
Heart." Enough said.
And Yankovic's original dit-

I • •
ties just don't live up to his remakes.
For example, "Alapalooza" originals,
"Frank's 2000-Inch TV" and "Talk

Soup," don't provoke thoughts of either
hilarity or musical genius.

A steadfast rule when considering
"Alapalooza" is that if you guffawed to
Weird Al once you'll snort with him
again. Just don't forget to visit the Flint
stones for a real "Dino"-mite good time.
