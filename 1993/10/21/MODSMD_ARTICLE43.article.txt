A Bronx Tale
A manic-depressive movie of sorts,
Robert De Niro's directorial debut
fluctuates between brilliant and ex
cruciatingly cliched moments. It de
pends on the tired Mafia mystique
Hollywood seems to require of any
movie including Italians and New
York. But it's a lot more than we
would expect from a movie that
shamelessly repeats its theme, "The
saddest thing in life is wasted poten
tial." R
Cool Runnings
Disney asks the question, "Is there
any sport in which a black man or
woman can't excel?" and answers
with a comically resounding "No."
The real-life struggle of the first Ja
maican bobsled team in history,
it's cute, it's warm, it's fuzzy. . .
provided you like being paraded
around like a puppet. Still, it's the
kind of light-hearted family fare
that's hard to dismiss entirely PG
Dazed and Confused
Part "Nashville," part "School Daze,"

all "Up In Smoke." That's the best
way to describe writer-director
Richard Linklater's latest film, which
goes back to the future, circa 1976,
to deliver a sly rebuke to the hypo
critical morality of the "Me" decade.
By refusing to wallow in nostalgia,
he comes up with a witty, vital look
at 24 hours of high-school hijinks. R
Demolition Man
Snipes, Stallone, guns. Despite in
tense predictability, "Demolition
Man" offers engrossing visual enter
tainment complete with loads of bru
tality. Director Marco Bambilla uses
a cheap script and two multi-million
dollar actors to satirically poke fun at
brutality 's integral role in our soci
ety. Surprisingly he creates some
thing worth watching — if only for
the chuckles. R
Joy Luck Club
Grandiose, epic, tear-jerking and
gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous...
this adaptation of Amy Tan's best
seller is all of the above. Moving de
spite its blatant commercialism,

"The Joy Luck Club" does a splen
did job of bringing the novel to life
and marks a monumental first for
Asian-Americans in Hollywood R
M. Butterfly
This adaptation of David Henry
Hwang's play could have been por
trayed as a pop culture look at a
naive French diplomat deceived into
kinky sex by a conniving Chinese
freak-of-a-man or a thoughtful criti
cism of popular perceptions of Asian
women and men Fortunately,
Hwang's collaboration on the
screenplay and the ingenious deci
sion to cast John Lone ("The Last
Emperor") as Song Liling preserve
the intended societal critique. R
Malice
Director Harold Becker attempts to
craft a suspenseful story, but the re
sult is a series of complicated twists
that never seem to end Both the plot
turns and acting are so exaggerated
that "Malice" seems almost like a
comedy. Whatever potential the film
had on paper is lost because both

writers and directors try to include
too many unsurprising surprise ele
ments and canned dialogue. R
Mr. Jones
Not even God has much of a chance
fixing this mess masquerading bold
ly as a message movie about manic
depressive disorders and medical
ethics — and the power of love,
which threatens to interfere with
both. Lena Olin and Richard Gere
threaten to violate both medical
ethics and their own careers with a
boring romance — based on a trite
script — that we simply cease to
care about. R
The Program
Touchstone Pictures' latest release is a
mediocre look at corruption and deceit
within college football. James Caan
plays a stereotypical head coach, over
looking the drugs, cash payments and
crime in his "Program." A weak script
and the never-ending problems the
program faces make the film drag. If it
had focused on the football scenes, this
could have become a pigskin dassic R
