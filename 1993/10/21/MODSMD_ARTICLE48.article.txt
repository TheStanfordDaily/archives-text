Wednesday nights are sacred
among my friends. It's agreed
that all classes, appointments,
dates, fires and national emer
gencies will be canceled in antic
ipation of the best two hours of
night time programming. Nail
polish in hand, and Diet Coke
poised for commercial breaks, all
talk of politics and science ceases

as the credits begin to roll.
How dumb can Donna
be? Why does David's ear-

ring grow with each episode? Is it
a disease that forces Brenda to in
cessantly bare her stomach?
Where do they find all those hot
guys, and can 1 transfer to that
college? My disdain and conde
scension flow freely.
As 1 sit and laugh at the impos
sibility of believing that Andrea is

only 18 and at the incredible nerdi
ness of Brandon's parents, one re
current thought plagues me. As 1
sit waiting for the previews of the
next show, I admit my nagging
worry: "My life should be this
good " And, embarrassed, we hang
our heads, blow on our nails and
wait for "Melrose Place" to start.
