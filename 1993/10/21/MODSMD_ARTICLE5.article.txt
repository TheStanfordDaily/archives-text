# Parking changes confuse East campus residents
## Police send message — with $25 tickets 
### Scott Van Winkle 
Some Stanford students were surprised
to learn this week that they will have to
move their cars from "Inner East" parking
lots to what some may call the Far East as a
result of new parking permit restrictions.
New parking rules were enforced with a
vengeance starting Tuesday, despite confu
sion among both students and police about
which lots are available to which resi
dences.
According to a parking handbook, while
students with Inner East parking permits
can park in any East lot, but it doesn't spec
ify that students with East permits cannot
use Inner East lots.

And some police believed that some
spaces directly in front of Wilbur Hall on
Escondido Road would be off-limits to
Wilbur residents, although this is not the
case, said Jeffrey Turn I in, who is in charge
of parking allocation for Stanford.
Police began giving $25 tickets to nu
merous Wilbur and Kimball residents who
parked in the lot in front of Branner Hall on
Escondido Road or in the lot between Bran
ner and Crothers Memorial Hall.
According to Tumlin, these lots have
been declared "Inner East" parking lots
since the beginning of the year, which
means only students living in Crothers
jMemorial, Crothers Hall, Bran
ner and Toyon Hall will be able to
park there.
The new restrictions were
announced in residential trans
portation booklets distributed to
residents when they moved in,
said Tumlin. However, the rules
were not enforced until this week
because police were focusing on
other permit violations, according
to Sgt. Hillary Karp, who heads
the Stanford Police transporta
tion section.
But this initial leniency may
have backfired, said sophomore
Arroyo resident Kris Stanier, who
received a ticket Tuesday. Stanier
said she "assumed it was okay" to
park on either side of Escondido
because she hadn't gotten a ticket
during the first few weeks.

Stanier also said the parking
manual was "kind of ambiguous"
about some parking rules.
Police may have been confused
about the new rules as well.
Arroyo resident Chris Quain
tance was told by the officer who
was about to give him his second
ticket yesterday morning that the
lot directly in front of Wilbur on
Escondido would be off-limits to
Wilbur residents "as soon as the
signs go up."
Tumlin said there are no»plans
to make that lot an Inner East lot.
"It's their front-door parking, so
we wouldn't want to take it
away," he said, although he
admitted the Inner East zone
could be expanded if demand was
high enough.
The reasons for the new rules
go back to the construction of
Kimball and Manzanita Park
dorms, which were built on park
ing lots. According to Tumlin,
however, there are no plans to

increase parking for East resi
dences.
The Inner East zone is
designed so everyone in the East
residences can walk from his car
to his dorm in less than five min
utes, Tumlin said. Since some
Crothers residents currently have
longer walks than that, the new
rules are intended to make room
for them. This would be done by
moving more Wilbur residents'
vehicles into the Wilbur lot and
encouraging more Manzanita
Park and Kimball residents to use
the parking lot across from the
Manzanita trailers which has "at
least 100 spots."
Perhaps not surprisingly,
many ticket recipients supported
Quaintance's statement that
handing out tickets was "not the
way to solve the problem."
Stanier said she realized police
were "just trying to make people
aware, but it's kind of hard at $25
a ticket."
