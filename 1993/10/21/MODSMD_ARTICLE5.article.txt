# Parking changes confuse East campus residents
## Police send message â€” with $25 tickets 
### Scott Van Winkle 
Some Stanford students were surprised
to learn this week that they will have to
move their cars from "Inner East" parking
lots to what some may call the Far East as a
result of new parking permit restrictions.
New parking rules were enforced with a
vengeance starting Tuesday, despite confu
sion among both students and police about
which lots are available to which resi
dences.
According to a parking handbook, while
students with Inner East parking permits
can park in any East lot, but it doesn't spec
ify that students with East permits cannot
use Inner East lots.

And some police believed that some
spaces directly in front of Wilbur Hall on
Escondido Road would be off-limits to
Wilbur residents, although this is not the
case, said Jeffrey Turn I in, who is in charge
of parking allocation for Stanford.
Police began giving $25 tickets to nu
merous Wilbur and Kimball residents who
parked in the lot in front of Branner Hall on
Escondido Road or in the lot between Bran
ner and Crothers Memorial Hall.
According to Tumlin, these lots have
been declared "Inner East" parking lots
since the beginning of the year, which
means only students living in Crothers
