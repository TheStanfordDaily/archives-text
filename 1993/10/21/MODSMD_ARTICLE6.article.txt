# Law prof explores history of crime and punishment
## 
### Allison Short 
After writing or editing more than 150 ar
ticles and a dozen books on legal science, it
would seem that Law Prof. Lawrence Fried
man has exhausted the topic.
But in his office, surrounded on all sides
by volumes of imposing criminology refer
ence books, Friedman says he is far from fin
ished with writing and researching.
Hoping to clear up the erroneous views
many people hold about crime, Friedman re
cently published "Crime and Punishment in
American History," which explores society's
reaction to crime and how the criminal jus
tice system functions.

"Everyone is fascinated by crime," Fried
man said. "It's almost an American obses
sion.
"People have so many myths and miscon
ceptions about crime and prejudice," Fried
man said. "Our view is distorted by politics,
prejudices and by the way the media depicts
criminal justice."
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg said Fried
man's new book is "the best social history of
criminal law ever done. This book is typical of
his work overall — it's a very good example of
his scholarly approach to legal history."
And while Friedman hopes that his new
book "does some tiny bit to make
the dialogue about crime more
realistic," he emphasizes that he is
not an optimist. "The crime prob
lem is insoluble and people are
unwilling to accept that and keep
looking for a quick Tlx," he said.
Friedman spent three to four
years researching his new book.
A great deal of his information
came from his book, "The Roots of

Justice," an intensive study of the
criminal justice system in Alameda
County which he co-authored with
a former Stanford law student.
Researching "The Roots of Jus
tice," Friedman spent long hours
digging through piles of records in
the basement of the county court
house.
Friedman's zest for writing and
researching carries over into his
teaching. "I think they're two
aspects of the same thing," he said.
"Research makes teaching more
meaningful and most teachers do
the best job in something they're

actively involved in researching."
Friedman currently teaches the
popular class, "Introduction to
American Law," which is also the
only undergraduate law class at
Stanford. This fall, 220 under
graduates are taking the class.
"Some kind of exposure to our
legal system is an important part
of education that students should
have" as undergraduates, Fried
man said.
He said his work with under
graduates gives him a new outlook
on the legal profession.
"They're fresh and eager and

many are intellectually curious,"
he said. "They don't feel the shad
ow of vocational needs pressing
them as hard and they have the
luxury of indulging themselves.
"Students come in on day one
ignorant and leave on the last day
having learned and understood
something," he said.
Friedman earned his degrees
from the University of Chicago
and practiced law in a private firm
in Chicago for a few years before
he became a professor.
"I always wanted to teach, and
I like the university atmosphere

— we have a lot of freedom. I
think it's the greatest job on
earth," Friedman said. "A lawyer
doesn't have that flexibility. We
have to generate our own pres
sure."
Friedman has long been inter
ested in the general history of
American law in the 20th century.
And, since his most recent book
"just scratched the surface," he
said he plans to do more research
on criminal justice.
"I hope to keep on writing until
they carry me out of here," Fried
man said.
