Stanford Dining Service gave a free
lunch to hundreds of students who t<x)k
advantage of the Food Vendor Fair yes
terday.
The fair, held near the Wilbur Hall
dining area, was sponsored by the dining
service to give students an opportunity to
sample all the food available from the
vendors who supply Stanford, according
to Assoc. Director of Dining Service
Shirley Everett.
"This gives us a chance to get specific
information from students about what
products they like and what they don't
like," she said.
As they entered the fair, students were
handed a survey that asked them to rate
the product samples. The fair and the
survey are part of Dining Service's efforts
to "enhance their menu," Everett said.
"We're going to use the surveys to
possibly eliminate a product, or add a
new product," said Andre Mallie, execu
tive chef for Dining Service, which was
formerly called Food Service.
The fair was held with no extra costs
to the dining service, Mallie said. Suppli
ers were simply invited to participate in
the fair and give out free samples of their
products.
Products at the fair included Coca-
Cola, pizza, ice cream bars, veggie burg
ers and bagels.
One woman at a booth called "The
Green Line — The Lunch Vegetarian
Line at Branner Hall" was ringing a bell
to attract students' attention.
Jim Basile, a Royal Foods representa
tive, yel led at students to come and grab an
apple or an orange at the produce display.
"We're just here to show Stanford stu
dents that we 'do produce,'" said Basile.

Many students enjoyed just observing
the culinary free-for-all. "This is great *
watching people try and stuff pumpkins
in their pockets," said junior Karin
Aberg.
Freshman Brendan Maher was busy
stuffing food samples into a cardboard
box that he carried around the fair. "I
wish they had this everyday," said
Maher. "I'm not going to get the chance
to try everything."
After filling their pwkets, many stu
dents were left envying Maher. "I just

wish I had a hip box to put all this stuff
in!" said freshman Lisa Corngan.
But, while most fiiir attendants caine
just for the food, junior Nik Kolodny said,
"The sanitation display was my favorite!"
The Ecolab display included a video on
sanitation and a dispenser of "Sanigizer
— Instant Hand Sanitizer" soap
Students seemed to enjoy all the food,
drinks and hand soap samples given
away at the fair. "This is awesome!" said
freshman Celina Ramirez. "I wish I came
out here earlier!"
