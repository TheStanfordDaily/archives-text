Haitian leaders defy U.N.
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -
Under U.S. pressure to make new conces
sions, Haiti's prime minister threatened
yesterday to resign if Haiti's militaiy chiefs
don't step down as required by a U.N. plan
to restore democracy.
Prime Minister Robert Malval's position
further complicated international efforts to
push through the plan that envisions the
Oct. 30 return of exiled President Jean-
Bertrand Aristide.
The head of a parliamentary "crisis com
mittee" said lawmakers cannot complete
their work in time for Aristide's return.
U.S. and U.N. mediators presented Mal
val with a document this week that calls for
broadening the interim government he
heads so that it would include more of Aris
tide's opponents.
The document's intent was angrily debat
ed with the Clinton administration by Aris
tide's supporters, who feel the proposal caves
in to the demands of the military leaders.
Six U.S. Navy warships, three Canadian
vessels and 10 U.S. Coast Guard cutters are
patrolling off Haiti's coast to enforce a

worldwide oil and arms embargo that began
Monday to force the army to cooperate.
Cigarette tax may quadruple
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President Clin
ton will include a 75-cent-per-pack cigarette
tax increase in his health care proposal as
well as a payroll tax on big companies that
set up their own outside plans, an adminis
tration official said yestenday.
The 1 percent payroll tax would apply to
corporations that set up separate health
plans rather than joining regional health
purchasing alliances, the official said, speak
ing on condition of anonymity.
The cigarette tax currently is 24 cents a
pack, and tobacco interests were strongly
resisting talk that it might go as high as $1
or more.
White House Press Secretary Dee Dee
Myers said final decisions on the details of
the health plan were not complete.
But an administration official who spoke
on condition of anonymity said Clinton had
settled both on the 75-cent cigarette tax
increase and the 1 percent corporate payroll
tax.
