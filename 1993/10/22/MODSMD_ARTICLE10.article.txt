U.S. to continue Russian aid
MOSCOW (AP) — Secretary of State
Warren Christopher brought new assur
ances of U.S. support to President Boris
Yeltsin yesterday, including a proposal for
Russian membership in the NATO alliance.
He also tried to build confidence back
home in President Clinton's foreign policy.
There are flickers of disapproval in the
way the U.S. administration approaches
Yeltsin. For example, his closing of sever
al opposition newspapers during his clash
with hard-liners has drawn criticism.
And before leaving Washington, Christo
pher warned that U.S. aid, pegged at $1.6
billion this year, was not open-ended.
"Expanded trade must take its place,"
said.
But, for the most part, Yeltsin and For

eign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev can expect
to get a boost from Christopher in their
talks today and tomorrow.
Israel will release prisoners
TABA, Egypt (AP) — Israeli and Pales
tinian negotiators reached agreement on
the release of Arab prisoners yesterday.
By early next week, Israel will free four
categories of prisoners: women, the sick, and
those younger than 18 and older than 50.
The accord was the first concrete agree
ment to come out of the talks at Taba on
implementing Israel's pact with the PLO
on Palestinian autonomy.
The Mandela Institute in the occupied
West Bank city of Ramallah, which tracks
prisoners, said 715 fall into those four cate
gories.
