## U.N. embargo continues; army leaders refuse to relinquish power

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)
Gunmen reportedly grabbed a legislative
ally of Jean-Bertrand Aristide yesterday,
sending another chilling message to sup
porters of the U.N. effort to bring the
exiled president back to power.
Samuel Milord, a National Assembly
deputy whose family said he was dragged
from a house, had only recently come out
of hiding since denouncing leaders of the
bloody coup that ousted Aristide two years
ago.
His seizure followed the assassinations
of pro-Aristide businessman Antoine
Izmery on Sept. 11 and Justice Minister
Guy Malary a week ago. Malary was part
of the interim government appointed by
Aristide, Haiti's first freely elected presi
dent, under a U.N. plan to restore democ
racy.

Although the army commander Raoul
Cedras signed the plan in July, increasing
violence and threats by army-backed civil
ian gangs have derailed the timetable for
implementing the plan and rebuilding this
impoverished nation.
A U.N. embargo on fuel and weapons
shipments, enforced by at least 11 U.S.
and other warships, was reimposed Tues
day to pressure Haiti's militaiy leaders to
live up to the accord and return Aristide to
office by Oct. 30.
Prime Minister Robert Malval's gov
ernment, which recommended the sanc
tions, said he had received a statement
from fuel distributors saying they would
respect the U.N. sanctions.
Parliament has been trying to draft
laws to implement provisions of the U.N.
democracy plan, and Milord's abduction

likely was a warning to lawmakers not to
proceed
Milord, a civil engineer, was one of the
first lawmakers to publicly denounce the
Sept. 30, 1991, coup, and refused to take
part in parliament sessions in which law
makers were forced at gunpoint to declare
the presidency vacant.
A shipload of American soldiers was
blocked from docking in Port-au-Prince
last week by a gang of toughs that took
over the pier and threatened violence. The
troops were to participate in a U.N. opera
tion to retrain Haitian police and rebuild
ing roads and other infrastructure.
The U.S. Embassy's spokesman, Unai
Montes, insisted yesterday that the goal of
bringing back Aristide on Oct. 30 "is not
yet dead." But he conceded that "the diffi
culty increases the closer we get to that."
