REDWOOD trip leaders
should make freshman
bonding highest priority

IT'S TIME to remove the dead
wood from REDWOOD. The
recent controversy over the
choice of activities presented as
First Year Trips by the student
organization Recreational Educa
tion Developmental Workshops
Out of Doors (REDWOOD) is a nat
ural result of the unexpected
events that occur in the trial run of
a program. The staff at RED
WOOD will undoubtedly overcome
most logistical problems which
may have occurred.
However, the priorities of the
REDWOOD program are also trou
bling, and this predicament will not
be solved as easily as the logistical
problems unless their priorities are
re-evaluated.
The fundamental objective of
the REDWOOD program should be
to encourage interaction among
individuals. This responsibility
necessarily falls upon the program,
given its pre-eminent position as
an activity to be experienced by
incoming freshmen. There is no
time at which students need com
panionship and positive feedback
more than in the first weeks of
their freshman year. If the RED
WOOD program cannot be struc
tured to maximize personal inter
action, it should schedule itself
later in the academic year and be
replaced by another program
which can.
Accordingly, the REDWOOD
program ought to encourage bond
ing between the students who wish
to participate in the program. This
goal is easily achieved in the trips
associated with the outdoors. How
ever, some students have ques
tioned the degree of interaction
which occurs on public-service
trips. A pre-requisite for positive
bonding and feedback would be
that students who participate in a

particular project should be
housed with one another off cam
pus during the program.
Students should not be short
changed by sleeping in the lounge
of another dorm on campus in the
future, as some participating fresh
men did this year. No matter how
much they paint the walls, Wilbur
will always be Wilbur.
For some students, the RED
WOOD public-service trip may rep
resent the only opportunity they
will have to live in an communal
environment entirely with fresh
men. If students are assigned a
public-service task, their attention
should not be diverted from their
job by knowing this opportunity is
the only one they will have to enjoy
each other's company. If the public
service trips continue, REDWOOD
coordinators must make sure they
provide ample bonding time for the
participants through evening activ
ities.
The focus on interaction which
should be a bedrock of the RED
WOOD program extends in princi
ple to the types of activities which
students should undertake. Par
ticipants in the REDWOOD pro
gram should in all circumstances
be placed in a situation where
they can interact with the individ
uals whom they are attempting to
assist. Some students criticized a
program which attempted to
assist East Palo Alto youth as
devoid of meaningful contact with
children. Others felt that they
were merely paying money to per
form public service. These criti
cisms have special importance
with regard to one of the first pro
grams that freshmen will experi
ence at Stanford.
If REDWOOD aims to help stu
dents assimilate into Stanford by
meeting their fellow classmates, it
must provide an atmosphere con
ducive to interaction, whether on a
mountain at Lake Tahoe or a
school in East Palo Alto. RED
WOOD coordinators should take
responsibility for fulfilling this
basic goal if they wish for their
prganization to become another of
Stanford's special features.
