## A 						fuzzie's fashions for fall 
### 
I HAD TO go out and buy flannel.
OK, so maybe I just stole the shirts
from my father. Point is, the pres
sure was too great — I had to conform
to fuzzie nonconformity.
"Learn to be a fuzzie, or just look
like one. . . Ever noticed you can
spot a fuzzie at fifty yards? Old plaid
flannel shirt, tied around the waist.
Faded, stretched-out t-shirt, prefer
ably from a Dead concert before you
were born. Birkenstocks, leather-and
bead necklace (both sexes), and the
piece de resistance, the big plastic cof
fee mug that hasn't been washed since
freshman year, dangling from the
straps of the backpack.
I did not look like this. I did not fit in.
I made several fuzzie faux-pas, like
wearing a Navy sweatshirt to section
during the big Tailhook stink. That was
a HUGE mistake. Because in fuz
ziedom, fashion means more than wear
ing the first thing you tripped over
when you tore yourself out of bed in the
morning — your clothes are your poli
tics, and there's no getting around it.
After two years of English classes, I
think I'm finally getting the hang of
the thing. I've gone for the soft-core
fuzzy look. I don't have a nose-ring or
combat boots and I haven't been able
to bring myself to buy Birks, but I have
mastered second-hand chic to the point
where I can blend into almost any
humanities class. The key is to look

kinda disheveled and really thoughtful
— then most TA's and the hard-core
fuzzies will leave you alone.
Then there's Kane's First Law of
Fuzzie Fashion: there is an inverse rela
tionship between how "troubled" you
look and how much reading you have
done. True, this may be a gross general
ization, but gross generalizations are
one of the things I'm best at. Next time
you're in Anthro 3 section, take a look
around and see if this isn't true. It
works something like this: don't wash
or comb your hair for a week, wear all
black, come in at least 20 minutes late
with a look on your face like Dracula
before a snack, drink espresso and
squint a lot and say one, totally irrele
vant and mind-bogglingly obscure thing
three minutes before the class is over.
Works every time.
Every now and again, I feel a little
ashamed that I have mashed myself
into the classical fuzzie mode. I've wit
nessed a few brave souls wearing
sorority sweatshirts to gender politics
classes and other such suicidal moves.
I'm not quite up to that. But, I do like
pushing the envelope a little. When I
take notes on that green engineering
graph paper, people look at me with a
mixture of awe and revulsion and give
me a wide berth. (This can be a good
thing if it's the end of the quarter and
they haven't showered recently.)
Sometimes I'll pick up a copy of The

Review. While I usually can't stomach
actually reading it, the reactions 1 get
for carrying it around are always
entertaining. Granted, I'm no James
Dean. But then again, who has the
energy?
Looking back to the days when I
took chemistry courses (chalk it up to
calculator envy), I don't remember
classes being politically divided along
fashion lines. Seems to me, we were all
unified by a deep loathing for the prob
lem sets and the people who graded
them. Neat or rumpled, suave or awk
ward, we all joined hands in common
hatred. It was beautiful and I miss it.
I believe there is a timid majority of
humanities majors who are sick to
death of the "fuzzier than thou"
approach and it's time they began to
fight back. Next time there's a clump
of "alternative" folks forming up in the
corner, someone wearing Polo should
sit down right in the middle of them
and make them realize that how you
dress isn't always how you think. I'll
raise my lukewarm espresso to you if
you do.

squint a lot and say one, totally irrele
vant and mind-bogglingly obscure thing
three minutes before the class is over.
Works every time.
Every now and again, I feel a little
ashamed that I have mashed myself
into the classical fuzzie mode. I've wit
nessed a few brave souls wearing
sorority sweatshirts to gender politics
classes and other such suicidal moves.
I'm not quite up to that. But, I do like
pushing the envelope a little. When I
take notes on that green engineering
graph paper, people look at me with a
mixture of awe and revulsion and give
me a wide berth. (This can be a good
thing if it's the end of the quarter and
they haven't showered recently.)
Sometimes I'll pick up a copy of The

Review. While I usually can't stomach
actually reading it, the reactions 1 get
for carrying it around are always
entertaining. Granted, I'm no James
Dean. But then again, who has the
energy?
Looking back to the days when I
took chemistry courses (chalk it up to
calculator envy), I don't remember
classes being politically divided along
fashion lines. Seems to me, we were all
unified by a deep loathing for the prob
lem sets and the people who graded
them. Neat or rumpled, suave or awk
ward, we all joined hands in common
hatred. It was beautiful and I miss it.
I believe there is a timid majority of
humanities majors who are sick to
death of the "fuzzier than thou"
approach and it's time they began to
fight back. Next time there's a clump
of "alternative" folks forming up in the
corner, someone wearing Polo should
sit down right in the middle of them
and make them realize that how you
dress isn't always how you think. I'll
raise my lukewarm espresso to you if
you do.

Kathleen Kane would like to thank
everybody who's bothered to read this
far
