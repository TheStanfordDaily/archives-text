## Students should put their money where their mouth is 
### 
I CONFESS that I was amused by
Stewart Richardson's humor in his
letter in the Oct. 19 Daily. He made
some excellent points, too, including his
critique of multiculturalism. I agree with
his idea that not all white, straight men
are alike, despite what Axess may think.
But Richardson also made several
assumptions that undermine his argu
ment in favor of ASSU fee refunds.
First, Richardson assumes a narrow
definition of culture in which the only
considerations are types of dances, food,
and clothes. However, culture also
includes attitudes, values, beliefs and
norms for behavior. Learning about these
aspects of other cultures might help
Richardson understand many of our
experiences. For instance, we might learn
about the reasons that white, straight

men like he and I speak more in class
than many students of different back
grounds. And why we interrupt others.
And why people who are not white often
do not feel comfortable living with us (at,
for example, 585 Cowell Lane). And why
we like thrash bands. Food for thought.
Second, Richardson assumes that he
does not benefit from the work of ASSU
funded student organizations because he
personally feels no direct impact. Yet,
Richardson reaps many benefits that he
does not recognize. For example, the
Rape Education Project (REP), Project
Heighten Education on Acquaintance
Rape (HEAR), and the Sexual Assault
Prevention Education Center are funded
by his $37 per quarter. They benefit
Richardson and the rest of the Stanford
community by working to prevent sexual

assault against Richardson and his
friends. (The 1988 REP survey found
that 10 percent of undergraduate men, 16
percent of graduate men, 29 percent of
undergraduate women, and 37 percent of
graduate women had been sexually
coerced at least once in their life. More
information is available in "Confronting
Rape," the book that REP distributes to
new students every year and for which a
portion of Richardson's %'tf pays.)
Richardson's benefits become obvious
when we consider our current medium for
communication. Since Richardson endors
es students' receiving their $37 refunds,
what would happen if we all requested
them? Richardson would not have been
able to have his letter published, because
there would have been no Daily.
Stanford students can vote in favor of

an organization receiving money from the
ASSU in the spring elections but can then
request a fee refund. Thus, students do
not have to put their money where their
mouth is. If the federal government oper
ated with the same policy, Richardson and
I could demand income tax refunds for
programs we did not feel "benefited" us.
For instance, we could ask for a refund for
the amount of our money that would have
been spent on high-school education since
we are not in high school.
Of all the absurd happenings at Stan
ford, ASSU fee refunds may well be the
most unbelievable. It would be valuable
for the Council of Presidents to use their
leadership to eliminate fee refunds and
give the ASSU a little more credibility.
