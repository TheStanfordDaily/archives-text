# Graduate student letter letter shows ignorance about ASSU fee refunds

The Oct. 21 Daily letter. "Grad stu
dent clarifies rationale for fee revolt," by
graduate student Tom Castello is testa
ment to the striking diversity of intelli
gence levels on campus.
The arrogant, childish and poorly rea
soned article asserted that graduate students
are acting out of spite resulting from the lack
of a special fee to fund their parties.
This reason is of dubious validity since
general social activities for undergradu
ates are funded through dormitory funds
(not always very responsibly) and are not
paid for by graduate students. Before
making pompous, unsupported statements
such as "we're older and wiser," the
author of the offending letter should justi
fy them by revealing his credentials for
admission to the University.
