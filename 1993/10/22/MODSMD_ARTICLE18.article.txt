## Breaking down the stereotypes, for what? 
### 
NO WOMAN is an island. And I, fair
reader, cannot close myself off
from the mean, nasty world like
some tropical paradise with sandy shores
and NutraSweet drinks with little
umbrellas.
But here I am, as distanced from the
reality of our poor little universe as Gilli
gan and his conically breasted female
counterparts. Isolated from the twisted
environment in which I used to thrive.
Shielded from the warped thoughts I used
to joust with daily, back in the days of old.
Mine eyes have seen the glory.
I've been thinking about my home
town lately, getting all misty-eyed about
my glory days. Back when we used to
watch the gang wars after the last bell in
high school. When we used to go to swap
meets for fun. When we used to spend
raucous nights at a $1.50 movie theater
with policemen sitting in the aisles.
In the good old days, I painstakingly
raked over the inventory of every athletic
store in a 20-mile radius to find the per
fect pair of Nikes. I scarfed down the
trends like corndogs, going from ultra

butt-hugging Bongos to zippered-ankle
Guess to ripped-in-the-knees Levi's.
Before god tapped me on the shoulder
and dropped me into the lap of Stanford
paradiso, I was middle America.
What a difference a day makes.
In La Hahra, CA — that's "the void" in
Spanish, named by Cortes, as legend has
it — I learned what life was all about. I
learned that rich bitches had BMWs and
their daddies bought them very happy
'lives with the ba-zillion dollar limits on
their Gold Cards. Learned that smaks
were almanac-memorizing geeks who
would command six-figure salaries based
on their 3.8 GPAs at prestigious La
Habra High, which offers an overwhelm
ing five, count 'em five, AP exams.
I learned that women were always
girls, homosexuality was wrong and eth
nic difference was a wall that took a life
time supply of Wheaties to scale. Every
venomous stereotype was painted in bold,
brilliant colors on my impressionable ide
ological big-screen.
Coming soon to a theater near you.
But from the moment I strolled across

the Oval, that life was gone — a million
miles back on the evolutionary timeline.
All of a sudden I was discussing French
humanists and Classical Greek architec
ture. KMart slush puppies were a thing of
the past, and I was about to create a newer,
more aerodynamically designed me.
Open your eyes.
Stanford taught me that difference
was inherently cool. Gone were the days
of playing twinsies with my clique, where
ideally we all looked, talked and acted
alike. On the Farm diversity was key, and
man/womyn could not survive on confor
mity alone. Now, one tiny speck of a per
son could incorporate several most cool
elements all, gasp, at the same time.
So we spent peak study hours decon
structing the rigid categories which had
been so firmly defended in high school. We
detested being tragically misunderstood as
a dork, a smak, a jock, and a bimbo at the
same time. Loathed being awarded "Most
Likely to Succeed" when we would've been
orgasmic upon receiving the "Best Eyes"
or even "Best Car" award.
The envelope please.

Unfortunately, now that I was so
ready to accept that those guys who
seemed like Beavis and Butthead's evil
twins could probably appreciate Niet
szche's comments on love too, I found La
Habra wouldn't take me back. They
didn't seem to think I could be a smak
and a bimbo and a jock, all rolled into one.
So now that I wasn't one or the other, I
was nada, zip, the big bagel.
People there know what the bound
aries are. Now I'm the one who's in trou
ble, because without the ability to stereo
type I'm a sitting duck. It's not my place
to go up to a gangster and ask which socio
economic forces shaped his or her life. I
can't hang out in the Pic 'N' Save parking
lot with the druggies if I don't want to get
taken in by the cops. I have to know my
role in the universe to make an In 'N' Out
run without losing my life.
Cross the line.
Since I've been gone, things have only
gotten worse. Two teenaged skinhead
girls beat an African-American woman to
death in my supermarket's parking lot.
Across town, a baby died from rat bites in

its drugged-out parents' apartment com
plex. The gang war keeps everyone ofT the
streets after dark, but it's subsided ever
since the Pee Wees established total dom
inance over the bustling metropolis of
45,000 inhabitants.
Meanwhile I've been debating Marxist
feminism and the oppression of house
wives in a time when unemployment has
eliminated the option of being a house
wife in La Habra. I study newly industri
alized countries when my high school
Physics lab partner is trying to work her
way up to manager at Taco Bell.
But is it she who won't succeed, or is it
me, as I fling myself at a world that I have
been tricked into thinking is understand
ing. Me who will be brought to my knees
after graduation. Me who has been force
fed a new dream that is less filling, half
the calories of the real world — but has
lessened my chances for survival.
Do you want fries with that, sir?

role in the universe to make an In 'N' Out
run without losing my life.
Cross the line.
Since I've been gone, things have only
gotten worse. Two teenaged skinhead
girls beat an African-American woman to
death in my supermarket's parking lot.
Across town, a baby died from rat bites in

its drugged-out parents' apartment com
plex. The gang war keeps everyone ofT the
streets after dark, but it's subsided ever
since the Pee Wees established total dom
inance over the bustling metropolis of
45,000 inhabitants.
Meanwhile I've been debating Marxist
feminism and the oppression of house
wives in a time when unemployment has
eliminated the option of being a house
wife in La Habra. I study newly industri
alized countries when my high school
Physics lab partner is trying to work her
way up to manager at Taco Bell.
But is it she who won't succeed, or is it
me, as I fling myself at a world that I have
been tricked into thinking is understand
ing. Me who will be brought to my knees
after graduation. Me who has been force
fed a new dream that is less filling, half
the calories of the real world — but has
lessened my chances for survival.
Do you want fries with that, sir?

NO WOMAN is an island. And I, fair
reader, cannot close myself off
from the mean, nasty world like
some tropical paradise with sandy shores
and NutraSweet drinks with little
umbrellas.
But here I am, as distanced from the
reality of our poor little universe as Gilli
gan and his conically breasted female
counterparts. Isolated from the twisted
environment in which I used to thrive.
Shielded from the warped thoughts I used
to joust with daily, back in the days of old.
Mine eyes have seen the glory.
I've been thinking about my home
town lately, getting all misty-eyed about
my glory days. Back when we used to
watch the gang wars after the last bell in
high school. When we used to go to swap
meets for fun. When we used to spend
raucous nights at a $1.50 movie theater
with policemen sitting in the aisles.
In the good old days, I painstakingly
raked over the inventory of every athletic
store in a 20-mile radius to find the per
fect pair of Nikes. I scarfed down the
trends like corndogs, going from ultra

butt-hugging Bongos to zippered-ankle
Guess to ripped-in-the-knees Levi's.
Before god tapped me on the shoulder
and dropped me into the lap of Stanford
paradiso, I was middle America.
What a difference a day makes.
In La Hahra, CA — that's "the void" in
Spanish, named by Cortes, as legend has
it — I learned what life was all about. I
learned that rich bitches had BMWs and
their daddies bought them very happy
'lives with the ba-zillion dollar limits on
their Gold Cards. Learned that smaks
were almanac-memorizing geeks who
would command six-figure salaries based
on their 3.8 GPAs at prestigious La
Habra High, which offers an overwhelm
ing five, count 'em five, AP exams.
I learned that women were always
girls, homosexuality was wrong and eth
nic difference was a wall that took a life
time supply of Wheaties to scale. Every
venomous stereotype was painted in bold,
brilliant colors on my impressionable ide
ological big-screen.
Coming soon to a theater near you.
But from the moment I strolled across

the Oval, that life was gone — a million
miles back on the evolutionary timeline.
All of a sudden I was discussing French
humanists and Classical Greek architec
ture. KMart slush puppies were a thing of
the past, and I was about to create a newer,
more aerodynamically designed me.
Open your eyes.
Stanford taught me that difference
was inherently cool. Gone were the days
of playing twinsies with my clique, where
ideally we all looked, talked and acted
alike. On the Farm diversity was key, and
man/womyn could not survive on confor
mity alone. Now, one tiny speck of a per
son could incorporate several most cool
elements all, gasp, at the same time.
So we spent peak study hours decon
structing the rigid categories which had
been so firmly defended in high school. We
detested being tragically misunderstood as
a dork, a smak, a jock, and a bimbo at the
same time. Loathed being awarded "Most
Likely to Succeed" when we would've been
orgasmic upon receiving the "Best Eyes"
or even "Best Car" award.
The envelope please.

Unfortunately, now that I was so
ready to accept that those guys who
seemed like Beavis and Butthead's evil
twins could probably appreciate Niet
szche's comments on love too, I found La
Habra wouldn't take me back. They
didn't seem to think I could be a smak
and a bimbo and a jock, all rolled into one.
So now that I wasn't one or the other, I
was nada, zip, the big bagel.
People there know what the bound
aries are. Now I'm the one who's in trou
ble, because without the ability to stereo
type I'm a sitting duck. It's not my place
to go up to a gangster and ask which socio
economic forces shaped his or her life. I
can't hang out in the Pic 'N' Save parking
lot with the druggies if I don't want to get
taken in by the cops. I have to know my
role in the universe to make an In 'N' Out
run without losing my life.
