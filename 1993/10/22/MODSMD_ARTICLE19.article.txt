## White plugs the defensive holes Star of Arizona game shines in his starting role for Cardinal 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Stanford's game against Ari
zona last Saturday was, in many
ways, a raucous coming-of-age
party for the Cardinal. For the
first time this season, the usually
quiet Stanford defense put
together 60 minutes of volumi
nous effort against its opponent.
The hard-fought battle fea
tured the emergence of new faces
on the Cardinal defense. Fresh
men Leon Vickers and Charlie
Young had outstanding games for
Stanford, speaking up and show
ing themselves to be players not
only of the future, but of the pre
sent.
However, no one's actions
spoke more loudly that those of
Jason White.
Starting his first collegiate
game ever, the sophomore defen
sive lineman had nine total tack
les, two of them for losses. The
performance nearly equaled his
total for all of last year, when he
accumulated 12 tackles on special
teams and as a backup to Ail-
American outside linebacker Ron
George.
"[George] really helped me
out," White said. "When I'd come
off the field, he'd tell me 'great job
on this', or *y° u gotta work on
that.' He really helped my pass
rush a lot. And Dave (Garnett)
was good at that, too; he really
taught me a lot about football.
Garney's a great guy."
Playing with one of the top
defenses in the nation last year
spoke volumes to White.
"Just seeing (Ail-American
free safety John) Lynch and E
(defensive lineman Estevan Avila)
and everyone . . . you see the kind
of intensity you gotta have to be
successful," White said.
Apparently, White has long
had that intensity. Even when he
started playing football in fifth
grade, White played with the age
group above his own.
White's intensity and skill
increased as the years went by. As

a senior defensive lineman at
Boise High School in Idaho, White
garnered first-team all-state hon
ors after a season featuring 78
tackles, including 46 solo tackles
and 10 quarterback sacks.
When the time came to choose

a college, White narrowed his
choices down to Washington
State and Stanford. But Stanford
didn't speak loud enough until
almost too late.
"They didn't offer me a schol
arship until right toward the sign

ing date," White said. "Coach
Walsh called and told me he had a
scholarship — I was kind of wait
ing. I was leaning toward Wash
ington State, too, but then coach
