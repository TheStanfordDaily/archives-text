# Renowned director discusses race relations, his film career
## 
### N'Gai Croal Senior staff writer 
Spike Lee isn't afraid to tell
it like it is.
"It's good to be back here at
Stanford. I was here in 1989, so
most of you weren't here al
ready. And if you were, you
might have to hear the same
shit again."
With those words, the 36-
year-old director introduced
himself to a sold-out crowd of
1,700 at Memorial Auditorium
last night.
Dressed in a monogrammed
Stanford football jacket — a
gift from head coach Bill
Walsh, whom he met earlier
yesterday on campus — he dis

cussed everything from the
power of filmmaking to black
self-hatred to current events.
Drawing parallels between
the L.A. riots and his 1989
film, "Do the Right Thing,"
Lee said, "Is that the right
thing Mookie does (throwing
the garbage can through the
window of Sal's pizzeria)? I
don't think it's right.
"But I understand it. Be
cause as was demonstrated in
Los Angeles two years ago, peo
ple reach a breaking point. The
Rodney King beating was like
the spark that set it off, but
that was not the sole incident."
Lee said of the verdicts in
the Denny beating case, "I'm glad
that the two guys got off. I never
felt that there would be another
uprising.
"This morning Reginald Denny
was on the 'Today' show. He him
self said, 'Look. They've been
incarcerated enough. Put 'em on
parole. Squash it. Let's move on.' I
think that's what we have to do."
Much of Lee's speech focused on
his film career, which was inspired
by his mother, who died when he
was a sophomore at Morehouse
University in Atlanta. But it was
the power of film to influence peo
ple that convinced him this was
something he should do.
"I remember seeing a Bruce Lee
movie, 'Enter the Dragon.' After
the movie, 5,000 kids came out of
the theater throwing flying kicks."
He drove home his point about
the power of film by discussing a
current film, "The Program,"
which shows drunken football
players lying down in the middle of
the highway. "These past two
weeks, three kids have gotten
killed doing the same stupid stunt.
And Touchstone Pictures cut that
scene out of the film. That's
unprecedented."
Addressing any would-be film
makers in the audience, Ixk? said,
"You really have to think about
what you're doing because this
thing is no joke."
He described his upcoming film,
"Crooklyn," as a semi-autobio

graphical summary of the '70s, as
well as a departure from the never
ending wave of "gangsta" movies
that dominate current black film.
"It'sabout a group of kids grow
ing up when parents didn't have to
worry about their kids getting
shot," he said.
"Crooklyn" promises to be
lighter fare than liee's previous
two films, "Malcolm X" and "Jun
gle Fever," in which he tackled
sexual mythology and black self
hatred.
"Jungle Fever" focused on a
black architect and a white secre
tary who came together for the
wrong reason, namely, the black
man's acculturation to the white
ideal of beauty.
"From the time you can think,
you're bombarded with the image
of the white woman as the epitome
of beauty — blond hair, blue eyes,
all that.
"We (black people) go to the sur
geon, have the doctor cut away at
our big, thick, red, juicy African lips
— come out of surgery with these
thin Larry Bird chicken lips. We
wear these blue and green 'Night of
the Living Dead' contact lenses.
This is how (self-hatred) manifests
itself. We won't even bring weaves
up — we'll just 'weave' it alone," he
said, eliciting laughter from the
crowd and causing a few women in
attendance to self-consciously
check their hairdos.
"And African-American males
— we're guilty too. Because a lot of
us brothers think that we're not
successful 'til we have a white
woman on lour arms]."
Leaving the contemporary world

of "Jungle Fever" for the historical
epic of "Malcolm X" brought
more trouble than he expected.
When he went over budget, Warner
Bros, stopped funding the film and
Lee resorted to his fellow black
celebrities — Michael Jordan,
Prince and Oprah Winfrey, among
others — for financial support.
"If they hadn't come through,
the film would not have been the
film we wanted to make," Lee said.
That wasn't the first time Lee
has faced major setbacks; his
emerging career was nearly cut
short twice. His first-year student
film at New York University, "The
Answer," about a black screenwrit
er hired to direct a $50 million
remake of "Birth of a Nation," near
ly got him cut from the program.
"The faculty didn't like that
film because they thought I was
making a personal attack on D.W.
Griffith, who's considered the
father of cinema. What they don't
teach is that this film was used to
recruit for the Klan, and hundreds
of African-American males got cas
trated and lynched because of it."
Fortunately, one of his teachers
championed his work, so he
remained at NYU. No one could
help him, however, when the
financing fell through for his
planned first feature, "The Mes
senger."
Lee then regrouped and wrote
the film, "She's Gotta Have It,"
which launched him to the fore
front of independent filmmaking.
Since then, Lee has produced and
acted in six films, including
"School Daze" (1988), and "Mo*
Better Blues" (1990).

movie, 'Enter the Dragon.' After
the movie, 5,000 kids came out of
the theater throwing flying kicks."
He drove home his point about
the power of film by discussing a
current film, "The Program,"
which shows drunken football
players lying down in the middle of
the highway. "These past two
weeks, three kids have gotten
killed doing the same stupid stunt.
And Touchstone Pictures cut that
scene out of the film. That's
unprecedented."
Addressing any would-be film
makers in the audience, Ixk? said,
"You really have to think about
what you're doing because this
thing is no joke."
He described his upcoming film,
"Crooklyn," as a semi-autobio

graphical summary of the '70s, as
well as a departure from the never
ending wave of "gangsta" movies
that dominate current black film.
"It'sabout a group of kids grow
ing up when parents didn't have to
worry about their kids getting
shot," he said.
"Crooklyn" promises to be
lighter fare than liee's previous
two films, "Malcolm X" and "Jun
gle Fever," in which he tackled
sexual mythology and black self
hatred.
"Jungle Fever" focused on a
black architect and a white secre
tary who came together for the
wrong reason, namely, the black
man's acculturation to the white
ideal of beauty.
"From the time you can think,
you're bombarded with the image
of the white woman as the epitome
of beauty — blond hair, blue eyes,
all that.
"We (black people) go to the sur
geon, have the doctor cut away at
our big, thick, red, juicy African lips
— come out of surgery with these
thin Larry Bird chicken lips. We
wear these blue and green 'Night of
the Living Dead' contact lenses.
This is how (self-hatred) manifests
itself. We won't even bring weaves
up — we'll just 'weave' it alone," he
said, eliciting laughter from the
crowd and causing a few women in
attendance to self-consciously
check their hairdos.
"And African-American males
— we're guilty too. Because a lot of
us brothers think that we're not
successful 'til we have a white
woman on lour arms]."
Leaving the contemporary world

of "Jungle Fever" for the historical
epic of "Malcolm X" brought
more trouble than he expected.
When he went over budget, Warner
Bros, stopped funding the film and
Lee resorted to his fellow black
celebrities — Michael Jordan,
Prince and Oprah Winfrey, among
others — for financial support.
"If they hadn't come through,
the film would not have been the
film we wanted to make," Lee said.
That wasn't the first time Lee
has faced major setbacks; his
emerging career was nearly cut
short twice. His first-year student
film at New York University, "The
Answer," about a black screenwrit
er hired to direct a $50 million
remake of "Birth of a Nation," near
ly got him cut from the program.
"The faculty didn't like that
film because they thought I was
making a personal attack on D.W.
Griffith, who's considered the
father of cinema. What they don't
teach is that this film was used to
recruit for the Klan, and hundreds
of African-American males got cas
trated and lynched because of it."
Fortunately, one of his teachers
championed his work, so he
remained at NYU. No one could
help him, however, when the
financing fell through for his
planned first feature, "The Mes
senger."
Lee then regrouped and wrote
the film, "She's Gotta Have It,"
which launched him to the fore
front of independent filmmaking.
Since then, Lee has produced and
acted in six films, including
"School Daze" (1988), and "Mo*
Better Blues" (1990).
Spike Lee isn't afraid to tell
it like it is.
"It's good to be back here at
Stanford. I was here in 1989, so
most of you weren't here al
ready. And if you were, you
might have to hear the same
shit again."
With those words, the 36-
year-old director introduced
himself to a sold-out crowd of
1,700 at Memorial Auditorium
last night.
Dressed in a monogrammed
Stanford football jacket — a
gift from head coach Bill
Walsh, whom he met earlier
yesterday on campus — he dis

cussed everything from the
power of filmmaking to black
self-hatred to current events.
Drawing parallels between
the L.A. riots and his 1989
film, "Do the Right Thing,"
Lee said, "Is that the right
thing Mookie does (throwing
the garbage can through the
window of Sal's pizzeria)? I
don't think it's right.
"But I understand it. Be
cause as was demonstrated in
Los Angeles two years ago, peo
ple reach a breaking point. The
Rodney King beating was like
the spark that set it off, but
that was not the sole incident."
Lee said of the verdicts in
the Denny beating case, "I'm glad
that the two guys got off. I never
felt that there would be another
uprising.
"This morning Reginald Denny
was on the 'Today' show. He him
self said, 'Look. They've been
incarcerated enough. Put 'em on
parole. Squash it. Let's move on.' I
think that's what we have to do."
Much of Lee's speech focused on
his film career, which was inspired
by his mother, who died when he
was a sophomore at Morehouse
University in Atlanta. But it was
the power of film to influence peo
ple that convinced him this was
something he should do.
