# Lean and mean Dean to screen keen teams
## 
### 
BRAVO! As ringleader of
this whole Greek phe
nomenon, I headed into
last week's competition falling
apart like feta cheese on Pete
Sampras' salad. Scanning the
heavens (and the Vegas betting
parlors) for the tiniest break in
the gloom of a one-game deficit,
I prayed for a sign, for anything
that would help me make up
ground on my feisty foes.

Well, ask and ye shall receive.
Zeus and the gang finally came
through for me. Assistant base
ball coach Dean Stotz, fresh off
his descent from Mount Olym
pus, took a 1-7 shellacking,
while yours truly maintained my
mediocrity at 4-4. So, after three
weeks, the standings are 12-14
for me, 10-16 for my guests
(that's a two-game lead, for
those keeping score at home).
This week's visitor, Jean Fet
ter, also knows something about
assistance. After writing so
many "personalized" congratu
latory messages as admissions
czar, Fetter decided that it's not
easy being dean after all and
became a top aide to University
President Gerhard Casper.
You can still call her "Dean
Jean," though, and as being a
dean once qualifies you to
appear here, we move forward
with lines from Wednesday's
Chronicle and home teams, as
ever, in CAPS.
STANFORD -10-1/2 vs. Ari
zona State
Andy: Stanford -10-1/2. Final
ly, we catch a soft spot in the
schedule. With the Sun Devils
and Oregon State at Stanford
Stadium on consecutive Satur
days, the Cardinal's road back to
a .500 record and a possible bowl
bid looks a little easier, at least
for these next two weeks.
Jean: Stanford -10-1/2. Her
flair for the catchphrase "work
ing in high gear," Fetter predict
ed a 28-14 victory, punctuated

with a "Go Cardinal!" That's it?
Heck, I've heard football players
complete a sentence better than
that.
WASHINGTON -11-1/2 vs.
Oregon
Andy: Washington -11-1/2. The
Ducks are coming off a cakewalk
in Tempe, Ariz, the Huskies are
frustrated after their first con
ference loss and the fans in Seat-

tie are rabid. Ever see the dog in
Nintendo's "Duck Hunt"? If not,
then use your imagination.
Jean: Washington -11-1/2. Last
week's UCLA debacle did not
stop Fetter from noting that the
Huskies are still going strong.
Don't stop believing, Dean Jean,
because this game sure won't
make you.
Ucla -19 vs. OREGON
STATE
Andy: Oregon State -(-19. The
Bruins took the cloud nine
express into Corvallis, where
Oregon State still staggers from
a thrashing at the hands of USC.
The wacky nature of college
football says that the Bruins will
start concentrating with about
five minutes left and barely eke
this one out.
Jean: UCLA —19. "It's in my
gut," Fetter said. I hope laying
19 (gulp) points doesn't upset
your stomach, Dean Jean,
because it sure would make me
sick.
ARIZONA —13 vs. Washing
ton State
Andy: Arizona —13. Now it can
be told: Arizona is the only
Pacific 10 Conference school
never to have been to a Rose
Bowl. Well, Wildcats, this
appears to be your year to steal
the show, and the Cougars are
but another accessory to your
perfect crime.
Jean: Washington State +13.


Andy Eiser


Jean Fetter
Fearing "repercussions" from the
Wildcats' comeback against the
Cardinal last week, Fetter went
the safe way, taking the Cougars
and the points. Where were those
"repercussions" when a lesser
UCLA squad was on the board?
NOTRE DAME -13 vs. Use
Andy: USC +13. All good things
must come to an end, which is why
the Fighting Irish's "Decade of
Dominance" will come screeching to
an unfortunate halt, much like the
Republicans' did about a year ago.
Jean: USC +13. She still believes
that Notre Dame will win by a
touchdown, though. What a shame.
Alabama —7 vs. MISSISSIPPI
Andy: Alabama —7. After making
the call of last week on the Crim
son Tide's tie with Tennessee, I
decided to let up on the best darn
no-offense team I've ever seen.
Just for this week, though. So
don't get any ideas.
Jean: Alabama —7. Believing that

the Tide will "come back strong,"
Fetter generously gave the Bull
dogs a touchdown.
SAN FRANCISCO -10-1/2 vs.
Phoenix
Andy: Phoenix +10-1/2. As those
who know me well (Ha!) will
attest, my amazement over the
Cardinals' scalping of the Red
skins last week has not worn off. If
they carry a small fraction of that
accrued momentum, they will
cover the 49ers easily.
Jean: San Francisco -10-1/2.
"Even without Joe Montana, the
49ers will do alright," Fetter said.
Well, they didn't do so "alright"
last week, did they now?
Buffalo -2-1/2 vs. N.Y. JETS
Andy: Buffalo -2-1/2. With a
week off and a burning need to
increase their American Football
Conference Eastern Division lead,
the Bills will ground Bennie, er,
Boomer and the Jets.
Jean: N.Y. Jets +2-1/2. Showing
that she has at least watched the
last three Super Bowls, Fetter
feels that Buffalo will fall. I just
hope she doesn't catch them when
the chips are down.
BRAVO! As ringleader of

days, the Cardinal's road back to
a .500 record and a possible bowl
bid looks a little easier, at least
for these next two weeks.
Jean: Stanford -10-1/2. Her
flair for the catchphrase "work
ing in high gear," Fetter predict
ed a 28-14 victory, punctuated

with a "Go Cardinal!" That's it?
Heck, I've heard football players
complete a sentence better than
that.
WASHINGTON -11-1/2 vs.
Oregon
Andy: Washington -11-1/2. The
Ducks are coming off a cakewalk
in Tempe, Ariz, the Huskies are
frustrated after their first con
ference loss and the fans in Seat-

tie are rabid. Ever see the dog in
Nintendo's "Duck Hunt"? If not,
then use your imagination.
Jean: Washington -11-1/2. Last
week's UCLA debacle did not
stop Fetter from noting that the
Huskies are still going strong.
Don't stop believing, Dean Jean,
because this game sure won't
make you.
Ucla -19 vs. OREGON
STATE
Andy: Oregon State -(-19. The
Bruins took the cloud nine
express into Corvallis, where
Oregon State still staggers from
a thrashing at the hands of USC.
The wacky nature of college
football says that the Bruins will
start concentrating with about
five minutes left and barely eke
this one out.
Jean: UCLA —19. "It's in my
gut," Fetter said. I hope laying
19 (gulp) points doesn't upset
your stomach, Dean Jean,
because it sure would make me
sick.
ARIZONA —13 vs. Washing
ton State
Andy: Arizona —13. Now it can
be told: Arizona is the only
Pacific 10 Conference school
never to have been to a Rose
Bowl. Well, Wildcats, this
appears to be your year to steal
the show, and the Cougars are
but another accessory to your
perfect crime.
Jean: Washington State +13.


Andy Eiser


Jean Fetter
Fearing "repercussions" from the
Wildcats' comeback against the
Cardinal last week, Fetter went
the safe way, taking the Cougars
and the points. Where were those
"repercussions" when a lesser
UCLA squad was on the board?
NOTRE DAME -13 vs. Use
Andy: USC +13. All good things
must come to an end, which is why
the Fighting Irish's "Decade of
Dominance" will come screeching to
an unfortunate halt, much like the
Republicans' did about a year ago.
Jean: USC +13. She still believes
that Notre Dame will win by a
touchdown, though. What a shame.
Alabama —7 vs. MISSISSIPPI
Andy: Alabama —7. After making
the call of last week on the Crim
son Tide's tie with Tennessee, I
decided to let up on the best darn
no-offense team I've ever seen.
Just for this week, though. So
don't get any ideas.
Jean: Alabama —7. Believing that

the Tide will "come back strong,"
Fetter generously gave the Bull
dogs a touchdown.
SAN FRANCISCO -10-1/2 vs.
Phoenix
Andy: Phoenix +10-1/2. As those
who know me well (Ha!) will
attest, my amazement over the
Cardinals' scalping of the Red
skins last week has not worn off. If
they carry a small fraction of that
accrued momentum, they will
cover the 49ers easily.
Jean: San Francisco -10-1/2.
"Even without Joe Montana, the
49ers will do alright," Fetter said.
Well, they didn't do so "alright"
last week, did they now?
Buffalo -2-1/2 vs. N.Y. JETS
Andy: Buffalo -2-1/2. With a
week off and a burning need to
increase their American Football
Conference Eastern Division lead,
the Bills will ground Bennie, er,
Boomer and the Jets.
Jean: N.Y. Jets +2-1/2. Showing
that she has at least watched the
last three Super Bowls, Fetter
feels that Buffalo will fall. I just
hope she doesn't catch them when
the chips are down.
BRAVO! As ringleader of
this whole Greek phe
nomenon, I headed into
last week's competition falling
apart like feta cheese on Pete
Sampras' salad. Scanning the
heavens (and the Vegas betting
parlors) for the tiniest break in
the gloom of a one-game deficit,
I prayed for a sign, for anything
that would help me make up
ground on my feisty foes.

Well, ask and ye shall receive.
Zeus and the gang finally came
through for me. Assistant base
ball coach Dean Stotz, fresh off
his descent from Mount Olym
pus, took a 1-7 shellacking,
while yours truly maintained my
mediocrity at 4-4. So, after three
weeks, the standings are 12-14
for me, 10-16 for my guests
(that's a two-game lead, for
those keeping score at home).
This week's visitor, Jean Fet
ter, also knows something about
assistance. After writing so
many "personalized" congratu
latory messages as admissions
czar, Fetter decided that it's not
easy being dean after all and
became a top aide to University
President Gerhard Casper.
You can still call her "Dean
Jean," though, and as being a
dean once qualifies you to
appear here, we move forward
with lines from Wednesday's
Chronicle and home teams, as
ever, in CAPS.
STANFORD -10-1/2 vs. Ari
zona State
Andy: Stanford -10-1/2. Final
ly, we catch a soft spot in the
schedule. With the Sun Devils
and Oregon State at Stanford
Stadium on consecutive Satur
days, the Cardinal's road back to
a .500 record and a possible bowl
bid looks a little easier, at least
for these next two weeks.
Jean: Stanford -10-1/2. Her
flair for the catchphrase "work
ing in high gear," Fetter predict
