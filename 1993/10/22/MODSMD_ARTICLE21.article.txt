# Spikers to battle 'Devils and' Cats

Briefly escaping the intensi
ty of midterm week on the
Farm, the Stanford women's
volleyball team will encounter
two tests of a different sort this
weekend in Arizona.
With a month remaining in its
regular season schedule, the sec
ond-ranked Cardinal (14-3, 7-2 in
the Pacific 10 Conference) will
test its knowledge on the court,
facing ofT against No. 17 Arizona
State (11-4, 5-4 in the Pac-10)
tonight followed by No. 21 Ari
zona (8-7, 4-5 in the Pac-10) in a
noontime Sunday match.
"So far, we've been in a
learning phase, which we've
had to go through," said coach
Don Shaw. "Now is our chance
to see how far we've come since
the beginning of the season."
Judging from last weekend's
outcome, Stanford seems to be
on the right track. The Cardinal
took sole possession of second
place in the conference with vic
tories over both Oregon State
and Oregon. While both teams
stumped the Cardinal at the
outset of the matches, with Ore
gon State actually taking game
one 11-15, Stanford eventually
passed the tests, downing the
Beavers in four games and then
sweeping the Ducks.
"I think our main focus
going into this weekend is to
start each game out strong,"
said senior tri-captain Heidi
Eick. "We're trying to be more
intense from the beginning so
we can go out there and play
hard right away."
While the Cardinal has defi
nitely seen its share of shaky
starts and inconsistent play,
Shaw considers these times of
learning for his young team.
The team has come to a point,

however, where instruction will
only carry it so far — the rest
will be decided on the court.
"We just need to go out there
and play," Shaw said. "We've
been overthinking — it's the
paralysis through analysis syn
drome. Now's the time to play
loose and have fun doing it."
The Cardinal hopes this
scrutiny will pay off, especially on
defense. Shaw links Stanford's
trouble against Oregon State mid
University of Pacific to deficient
blocking, which left the opposing
team's best hitters with very lit
tle competition at the net.
While relaxed play may be
the order of the weekend, the
season remains a constant
uphill climb, marked by intensi
ty and practice — a pattern not
likely to change in the next
month.
"We ain't sit back and let
things go," Kick said. "We know
we have to continue to push
ourselves in every match. We're
still focusing on improving —
we definitely have not reached
our peak yet."
Its meetings with the Ari
zona teams earlier in the year
resulted in Stanford's first two
Pac-10 wins. The Cardinal fin
ished off the Sun Devils 5-15,
15-8, 15-4, 15-7 and then swept
the Wildcats 15-4, 15-10, 15-9
in Maples Pavilion. While Stan
ford aims to repeat those early
season performances, playing in
Sun Devil territory provides an
additional challenge, according
to Shaw.
"The Arizona State match is
usually much tougher for us
away," he said. "They're an up
and-down team which usually
plays up when they're at
home."
The Sun Devils pulled out a
five-game win over Arizona last Fri
day and now sit in fourth place in
the Pac-10, along with Washington
State and Oregon State. Outside
hitter Christine Garner, named the
Pac-10 Player of the Week, leads
the Arizona State attack. Garner is
the only player in the country this
season to post more than 30 kills in
three separate matches.
Arizona meets the Cardinal in
the middle of a heartbreaking sea
son. In their last four stand-offs,
including contests with No.l UCLA
and No. 6 USC, the Wildcats have
held match point, yet have not been
able to secure the final point.
"Arizona has been playing every
one tough," Shaw said. "They've had
four straight five-game matches,
that's how close they are. This league
is just so tough that they're just an
eyelash away from a 7-2 record."
Coming off a four-game homes
tand, the Cardinal looks to gain
experience on the road in prepara
tion for postseason action and pos
sibly the Final Four in December.
