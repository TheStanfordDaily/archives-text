Field Hockey
"Frustrated" is probably the best word to
describe Stanford's field hockey team. The
squad has often seen victory within their
grasp, then watched it slip away â€” six of their
eight losses have been by one goal, including
last weekend's 2-1 loss to Duke at California.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal (5-8) is set to
make another trip across the Bay to play in
the California Invitational. They will face off
against Southwest Missouri State on Satur

day and UC-Santa Barbara on Sunday.
"We've lost a lot of close games that we
should have won," said senior defender
Markley Bavinger, referring to both the Duke
'game and a recent 1-0 loss to Michigan.
Ice Hockey
The Cardinal ice hockey team will square
off against Northern Arizona on Friday at 7
p.m. and on Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at the
Golden Gate Ice Arena in Redwood City.

Stanford looks to build upon last week
end's successful season opener. In its first
two-game series, the? Cardinal trashed Pacific
18-2 on Friday before taming the Tigers, 15-
1, on Saturday.
The Stanford squad has never faced
Northern Arizona, but it is ready for a fast
paced and hard-hitting game. Northern Ari
zona will be a formidable opponent, as it used
to boast varsity status before its stadium
burned down.
