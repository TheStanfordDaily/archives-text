# Water polo eager to feast on Golden Bearmeat
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
Sometimes, a loss is not such a
bad thing. Sometimes, after a key
loss a team bounces right back and
takes its game to another level.
Then again, sometimes a team
is ready for an opponent no matter
what the circumstances are.
That should be the case Satur
day when the Cardinal (15-2, 2-0
in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) hosts the California
Golden Bears at deGuerre.
"I hope that we will be able to
come back after the loss to (The
University of Pacific]," said coach
Dante Dettamanti. "But I don't
think our guys need a loss to be up
for Cal."
The Cardinal has met Cal twice
this season, emerging from the
water victorious both times —
most recently with a 9-7 win in the
finals of the Northern California
Tournament.
Despite a 10-7 defeat at the
hands of Pacific last Sunday, Stan
ford still holds the top spot in the
national coaches' poll.
Cal (12-6, 2-2 in the MPSF)
kept their No. 3 ranking after los
ing to No. 2 USC in overtime Sun
day. However, UOP moved up to
tie the Golden Bears for that posi
tion.
The Cardinal has trained hard
this week in anticipation of Ail-
American holeman Troy Barnhart
and his Cal teammates.
"We know what to expect," said
senior goaltender Larry Bercutt.
"We'll be watching out for Barn
hart and (Gavin) Arroyo. We want
to go out hard at them and get up
early like last time."
Stanford blitzed the defending
national champions in the first
quarter of their last meeting,
jumping to a 5-0 lead in the open

ing minutes.
"They would love to beat us in
our pool, in front of our crowd,"
Dettamanti said. "We've beaten
them twice at their pool. They've
got three very good seniors —
Barnhart, Arroyo, and (Tony)
Barnes. They all have good size
and speed."
Barnhart leads the trio and the
team in scoring, although the Stan
ford defense has held him in check
offensively during the teams' two
meetings. Dettamanti will again
match up sophomore Jeremy
Laster against Cal's big man.
"Jeremy will definitely guard Barn
hart," Dettamanti said. "They've got
other guys who can set the hole, but
he's their lx»st. We've been able to keep
Barnhart down so far."
In the two matches, Barnhart
has not scored a goal from close
range, netting only two penalty
shots.
Dettamanti also noted that the
key to both of the previous meet
ings been different and anticipated
Saturday's game will present new
elements.
"In the first game, the differ
ence was six-on-five (man-advan
tage situations due to 20-second
ejection fouls on the defense),"
Dettamanti said. "In the second
game, it was our two-point shots."
Dettamanti hopes the differ
ence will not lie in the health of his
team, as driver Wolf Wigo is still
nursing a sore back and holeman
Frank Schneider is feeling ill.
"Wolf is feeling about 75 per
cent right now," Dettamanti said.
"If he's at about 90 percent Satur
day, I'll be pretty happy. Wolf
doesn't like Cal very much, so I'm
sure he'll be ready to go."
It's a safe bet to say that no
member of the Stanford squad is
very fond of Cal.
Sometimes, that's all it takes.
