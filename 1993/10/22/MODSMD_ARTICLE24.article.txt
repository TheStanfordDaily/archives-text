# No. 4 kickers try to smother Cal attack
## 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
This is the weekend for the women's soccer
team to make its mark against another top
NCAA power, as No. 4 Stanford (12-2-1) travels
to No. 2 California (9-1-4) Saturday before
returning to the friendly confines of Maloney
Field to face Butler (3-7-3) on Sunday.
The Golden Bears come into this weekend
as a surprise top-five team. Ranked 14th in the
preseason, the Golden Bears vaulted to the
No. 2 spot with a 1-0 win over Santa Clara and
a 2-2 tie with Portland, both top-five teams at
the time Cal played them.
"Cal is a very quick team, and they'll be
well-organized," said coach lan Sawyers.
"When they play Stanford, they always get an
extra boost. It's going to be a pressure cooker
up there."
Coming off a lackluster 1-0 win over St.
Mary's earlier this week, Stanford must avoid
its typical slow start if its wants to topple the
upstart Berkeley squad.
"I wonder if we could inject our players
with cafieine before the game," Sawyers joked.

But on a more serious note, he wants the team
to go back to the basics, hoping to solve some
techincal problems.
"It's a simple game, really," Sawyers said.
"It's just a matter of sometimes the kids
don't execute and sometimes they feel the
rhythms. That's the beauty of it."
Despite their jump to No. 2, Cal appears to be
slipping back down the rankings. After four ties
earlier in the season, the Bears suffered their
first setback this week, a 1-0 overtime loss
against the University of San Francisco.
Furthermore, the Bears also face injury
problems. Top scorer Erika Hinton (nine
goals, five assists) sat out all of regulation play
against the Dons to rest a toe injury before
returning to the field for overtime. Goalkeeper
Kyla Schmedding has been troubled by a slight
thigh pull the past week, but both she and
Hinton are expected to play Saturday. Logging
over 1,000 minutes so far this year, Schmed
ding has allowed only nine goals and has four
shutouts.
Other top scorers for the Bears include
Alexis Thompson, with seven goals and five
assists and Stacey Juhl with four goals and

two assists.
On the other side of the spectrum lie the Car
dinal's Sunday opponent â€” the Butler Bulldogs.
In only its third year of varsity action, the But
ler women's soccer team looked to this year as
the breakthrough year. However, coach Bryan
Blitz's team has not lived up to the optimistic
expectations, even though five of its seven losses
have come in overtime.
With a lineup dominated by juniors, the
Bulldogs make up for a lack of top skills with
experience. Midfielder Shannon O'Neil leads
Butler offensively with 16 total points. Chris
Johnson, a forward, is second on the team
with 14 points.
Like Cal, the Bulldogs are hamfx?red by
injuries, as top midfielder Kori Stiefvater will
miss the rest of the season with a leg injury.
Despite being held scoreless in two consecu
tive games for the first time this year, Stan
ford's scoring duo of Erin Martin and Sarah
Rafanelli continue to pace the Cardinal on
offense with 32 points each. Martin leads the
team with 13 goals while Rafanelli has record
ed a team-high eight assists to go with her 12
goals.
