# Men's soccer loses some Z's but gets a W

Don't worry about the fact that
members of the Stanford men's
soccer squad might have missed
their bedtimes last night. They may
have been out a little late, but their
1-0 overtime victory over South
Bay rival San Jose State was more
than enough to make up for the
possible lack of sleep.
"It happens every now and
then," said forward Rick Goad on
the two 15-minute overtime format
in collegiate soccer. "You can play
an extra half-hour and perhaps still
come out with a tie. It's what
makes soccer a strange game."
So if you happen to see one of the
athletes looking tired today in class,
don't apologize for his situation. In
fact, abundant congratulations are
in order after the Cardinal captured
their third-straight victory and
moved to 5-8-1 overall and 3-2 in
the highly-contested Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation.
It took Stanford a little longer
than they would have liked, but
they got the job done. Midfielder
Neils Bruckner took the pass from

forward Ryan Estevez in the 101st
minute and slapped it in an open
goal to give the Cardinal the victo
ry-
Both Stanford and the Spartans
(9-6, 1-5) entered the game in the

midst of frustrating seasons. But
this was the day of defense, and
both squads closed off entrance to
the goals throughout regulation
play.
"We played really well," Goad

said. "We dominated most of the
game, but we didn't get many good
looks at the goal because they
packed it in in the back."
