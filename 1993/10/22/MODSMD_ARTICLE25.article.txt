# Men's soccer loses some Z's but gets a W

Don't worry about the fact that
members of the Stanford men's
soccer squad might have missed
their bedtimes last night. They may
have been out a little late, but their
1-0 overtime victory over South
Bay rival San Jose State was more
than enough to make up for the
possible lack of sleep.
"It happens every now and
then," said forward Rick Goad on
the two 15-minute overtime format
in collegiate soccer. "You can play
an extra half-hour and perhaps still
come out with a tie. It's what
makes soccer a strange game."
So if you happen to see one of the
athletes looking tired today in class,
don't apologize for his situation. In
fact, abundant congratulations are
in order after the Cardinal captured
their third-straight victory and
moved to 5-8-1 overall and 3-2 in
the highly-contested Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation.
It took Stanford a little longer
than they would have liked, but
they got the job done. Midfielder
Neils Bruckner took the pass from

forward Ryan Estevez in the 101st
minute and slapped it in an open
goal to give the Cardinal the victo
ry-
Both Stanford and the Spartans
(9-6, 1-5) entered the game in the

midst of frustrating seasons. But
this was the day of defense, and
both squads closed off entrance to
the goals throughout regulation
play.
"We played really well," Goad

said. "We dominated most of the
game, but we didn't get many good
looks at the goal because they
packed it in in the back."

inherent in Stanford's style of soccer.
Stanford managed only nine
shots on goal, including Bruckner's
winning goal in the first overtime.
But San Jose collected only five
shots and were unable to get a
decent crack at the Cardinal goal.
"It was a battle for most of the
game," said Goad. "We had our
chances, but they were playing real
ly well."
And while it was a rough and
tough game, it was also a tightly
contested matchup. After the regu
lation 90 minutes of play, Stanford

entered the overtime periods know
ing full well that they could settle
for nothing less than a win.
"We knew that we had to win this
game for any of the other games to
have any meaning," Goad said.
And although the pressure was
highest on the Cardinal (the Spar
tans have long been out of playoff
contention), the team was confident
that their dominance in regulation
play would continue into overtime
and eventually give them the victory.
"I had a feeling as soon as regula
tion was over that we'd win it," Goad
said. "We had controlled the ball, and
we were confident at that point."
Because of the stifling defense,
Cardinal goalie Jim Masetti and

Spartan keeper Keith Bateman
nabbed only three saves apiece. San
Jose's offense was nearly non-exis
tent — in addition to their shock
ingly low shot total they did not
execute a single corner kick in the
entire 101 minutes of play.
Stanford, who is climbing the
MPSF golden ladder fast and is
already fourth in the conference,
will meet Fresno State in Southern
California on Sunday.
With this week's series of wins,
the Cardinal is still in the hunt for
a possible playoff position.
"They might overlook us, with our
record as it is," Goad said. "But if we
continue on and play the way we've
been playing, we can win this game."
