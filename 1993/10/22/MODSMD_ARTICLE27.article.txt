## Spreading the wealth $1,000 at a time 
### 
I HEARD WITH great pleasure last week
that Stanford is the soon-to-be beneficiary
of $25 million. Thanks to the strong wills
of two really, really, really rich dead women,
and the half-hearted compliance of the Chris
tian Scientist Church with the deceased's
wishes, we're backing into a rather large for
tune.
I didn't catch all the details in the newspa
per articles, but all that matters on my end is
that the big bursar in the sky just plopped an
unanticipated $25 million in our laps.
It's as if the Navy suddenly realized it for
got to carry a two into the millions column
during that little tiff we had two years ago and
just sent us a rebate check. It's as if every a
cappella singer ever to walk this campus were
fleeing the divine destruction of Dinkelspiel
Auditorium and each one looked back, despite
the warning, and Ka-Zot! they all suddenly
transformed into mounds of $100 bills. It's as
if you put on a jacket you haven't worn in a
while and finding 25 bucks in the pocket, only
doing it a million times. Sure, it's crinkled and
faded because you sent it though the wash,
but don't get anal — it's free money.
The point is that Stanford now has $25 mil
lion that it did not even expect.
$25 million. Think about it. Think of
Scrooge McDuck swimming in his vault full of
money. A plethora of pesos. Multitudinous
moolah. A deluge of dollars, a cavalcade of
clams, a grillion greenbacks, beaucoups bux!
And it is all coming to us.
Now don't get me wrong; I'm not delighting
in the Christian Scientist Church's misfor
tune, or dancing on the graves of those two
really very extremely rich but also really very
dead millionairesses. But you can't really feel
sorry for the Church — as part of the settle
ment they are still getting $50 million.
And those two ladies . . . well, they're still
dead.
I think we owe it to them — the Church,
the rich people, all the people in Congress who
crucified us just because we accidentally took

some extra money, and all the
people at Cal who laughed and
laughed and laughed because
we got caught — I think we owe
it to the whole lot of them to
make something very positive
of this $25 million.
Which brings me to the real
point, the inevitable question:
WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE
MONEY?!
Do we get the yacht out of
hock?
Should we buy 25 million
lotto tickets? That should
mathematically insure that we

win the Grand Prize. (Sure, we might only get
$26 million back, but if we keep doing that,
every month for two years, we just might dou
ble the whole stash.)
Do we put in a monorail around Campus
Drive to reinforce our Disneyland of the North
image? With the left-overs alone we could
commission some cash-strapped M.E. student
to cast a set of bronze Mickey Mouse ears and
turn the Rodin sculpture garden into a more
jovial theme park. All that would be left would
be to connect the Museum with the backside
of the Gates of Hell and create a tunnel ride.
Pirates of the Nine Levels of Hades, or Tor
tured Souls of the Caribbean.

We could shoot the whole wad on Tresidder
Dollars (remember, $125 will buy $130). That
could get you 39,933,600 Chewy Oatmeal
Cookies, 16,016,000 Steaming Cafe Lattes, or
even 11,440,000 Slices of fine Pepperoni Pizza.
But all this is idle speculation. The budget
crunching and belt tightening have hit Stan
ford hard these past few years. We have all
suffered.
Thus, for those who are still here after all
the tuition hikes and staff slashings, this
money is a new dawn. A chance for the Uni
versity to make it up to all of us.
Here's how:
Figure there are about 13,000 students —
graduates and undergraduates combined —
running around this campus. Aproximate
3,000 professors. Count in another 7,000 staff
and miscellaneous affiliates and we're left
with some rather magical calculations.

One thousand dollars a person.
Twenty-five million dollars for twenty
three thousand people.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.
It makes perfect sense. We've all been
hurt by the budget cuts, here is their
chance to make it up to us.
Let the University use this windfall to
show how much they really love us — each
and every one.
You could spend it on anything you
wanted. Road trip to Disney World. Bribe a
TA. Pay for sex. Invest and retire Buy a
used car.
Buy those funky optical posters where
you can't see anything but a lot of static.
Never read a book on reserve again.
Imagine spring break if everyone affiliat
ed with this campus had $1,000 to kill.
There wouldn't be an empty bed in all of
Cancun.
Just for fun we could make it a Brew
ster's Millions kind of deal, where you had
to spend the whole $1,000 in one weekend.
Let's take the benefits one step further.
Think about an eager $25 million, once
caged up, now roaming loose around North
ern California. The local economy —
presently awful - would completely turn
around.
Miyake's could charge 100 times what
they do now, and they'd still be raging.
Now this may seem selfish, and this may
seem trivial, but the simple fact is that no
matter how the University might decide to
spend the $25 million, nothing would possi
bly give me as much satisfaction as a check
for $1,000.
I don't need a new department; statues
bore me; and Wilbur has already been
repainted.
Do you think you would really appreciate
some The Fort Building of Botany over a
solid grand in your pocket?
And think of the practical benefits. We
could get on "20/20," again! And this time
r n n

for positive P R.
Seniors in high schools
around the world would clam
or for applications, and, most
importantly, we would win
hands down the "quality of
life" section of the U.S. News
& World Report rankings. We
could be the only school with
an instant rebate on tuition.
$7,000 down, $1,000 cash
back!
Life would be grand.

There wouldn't be an empty bed in all of
Cancun.
Just for fun we could make it a Brew
ster's Millions kind of deal, where you had
to spend the whole $1,000 in one weekend.
Let's take the benefits one step further.
Think about an eager $25 million, once
caged up, now roaming loose around North
ern California. The local economy —
presently awful - would completely turn
around.
Miyake's could charge 100 times what
they do now, and they'd still be raging.
Now this may seem selfish, and this may
seem trivial, but the simple fact is that no
matter how the University might decide to
spend the $25 million, nothing would possi
bly give me as much satisfaction as a check
for $1,000.
I don't need a new department; statues
bore me; and Wilbur has already been
repainted.
Do you think you would really appreciate
some The Fort Building of Botany over a
solid grand in your pocket?
And think of the practical benefits. We
could get on "20/20," again! And this time
r n n

for positive P R.
Seniors in high schools
around the world would clam
or for applications, and, most
importantly, we would win
hands down the "quality of
life" section of the U.S. News
& World Report rankings. We
could be the only school with
an instant rebate on tuition.
$7,000 down, $1,000 cash
back!
Life would be grand.

I HEARD WITH great pleasure last week
that Stanford is the soon-to-be beneficiary
of $25 million. Thanks to the strong wills
of two really, really, really rich dead women,
and the half-hearted compliance of the Chris
tian Scientist Church with the deceased's
wishes, we're backing into a rather large for
tune.
I didn't catch all the details in the newspa
per articles, but all that matters on my end is
that the big bursar in the sky just plopped an
unanticipated $25 million in our laps.
It's as if the Navy suddenly realized it for
got to carry a two into the millions column
during that little tiff we had two years ago and
just sent us a rebate check. It's as if every a
cappella singer ever to walk this campus were
fleeing the divine destruction of Dinkelspiel
Auditorium and each one looked back, despite
the warning, and Ka-Zot! they all suddenly
transformed into mounds of $100 bills. It's as
if you put on a jacket you haven't worn in a
while and finding 25 bucks in the pocket, only
doing it a million times. Sure, it's crinkled and
faded because you sent it though the wash,
but don't get anal — it's free money.
The point is that Stanford now has $25 mil
lion that it did not even expect.
$25 million. Think about it. Think of
Scrooge McDuck swimming in his vault full of
money. A plethora of pesos. Multitudinous
moolah. A deluge of dollars, a cavalcade of
clams, a grillion greenbacks, beaucoups bux!
And it is all coming to us.
Now don't get me wrong; I'm not delighting
in the Christian Scientist Church's misfor
tune, or dancing on the graves of those two
really very extremely rich but also really very
dead millionairesses. But you can't really feel
sorry for the Church — as part of the settle
ment they are still getting $50 million.
And those two ladies . . . well, they're still
dead.
I think we owe it to them — the Church,
the rich people, all the people in Congress who
crucified us just because we accidentally took

some extra money, and all the
people at Cal who laughed and
laughed and laughed because
we got caught — I think we owe
it to the whole lot of them to
make something very positive
of this $25 million.
Which brings me to the real
point, the inevitable question:
WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE
MONEY?!
Do we get the yacht out of
hock?
Should we buy 25 million
lotto tickets? That should
mathematically insure that we

win the Grand Prize. (Sure, we might only get
$26 million back, but if we keep doing that,
every month for two years, we just might dou
ble the whole stash.)
Do we put in a monorail around Campus
Drive to reinforce our Disneyland of the North
image? With the left-overs alone we could
commission some cash-strapped M.E. student
to cast a set of bronze Mickey Mouse ears and
turn the Rodin sculpture garden into a more
jovial theme park. All that would be left would
be to connect the Museum with the backside
of the Gates of Hell and create a tunnel ride.
Pirates of the Nine Levels of Hades, or Tor
tured Souls of the Caribbean.

We could shoot the whole wad on Tresidder
Dollars (remember, $125 will buy $130). That
could get you 39,933,600 Chewy Oatmeal
Cookies, 16,016,000 Steaming Cafe Lattes, or
even 11,440,000 Slices of fine Pepperoni Pizza.
But all this is idle speculation. The budget
crunching and belt tightening have hit Stan
ford hard these past few years. We have all
suffered.
Thus, for those who are still here after all
the tuition hikes and staff slashings, this
money is a new dawn. A chance for the Uni
versity to make it up to all of us.
Here's how:
Figure there are about 13,000 students —
graduates and undergraduates combined —
running around this campus. Aproximate
3,000 professors. Count in another 7,000 staff
and miscellaneous affiliates and we're left
with some rather magical calculations.

One thousand dollars a person.
Twenty-five million dollars for twenty
three thousand people.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.
It makes perfect sense. We've all been
hurt by the budget cuts, here is their
chance to make it up to us.
Let the University use this windfall to
show how much they really love us — each
and every one.
You could spend it on anything you
wanted. Road trip to Disney World. Bribe a
TA. Pay for sex. Invest and retire Buy a
used car.
Buy those funky optical posters where
you can't see anything but a lot of static.
Never read a book on reserve again.
