Totaling $450,000 in returned money, the Book
store set its rebate rate at 15 percent for the second
year in a row.
The Bookstore determined the rate from the esti
mated number of returned eligible receipts and the
amount of money available for rebates, said Ken
Shark, the manager of retail services.
The Bookstore rebates its profits on all student
book purchases.
With $3 million in receipts turned in last spring,
and the average student spending $700 to $1000 on

books, "the average check will probably run a little
lower than $90 to $150, just because most students
don't turn in all their receipts," Shark said.
According to Shark, the $450,000 rebate total —
which is the same as the amount returned last year —
is high compared to the $300,000 that was available
for the 1991-92 school year, although it is substan
tially lower than the $535,000 of 1987-88, the highest
amount of money ever available for book rebates.
Rebate checks were available at the Bookstore
beginning Oct. 20 and can still be claimed today.
After today, unclaimed checks will be mailed to their
recipients.
