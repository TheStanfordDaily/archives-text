# $1.5M grant to fund recruitment of minorities in medical fields
## 
### Cametra Thompson Staff writer 
When Assoc. Pediatrics Prof. Fernando Mendoza
started teaching at Stanford in 1981, he was one of 65
Mexican-American medical school faculty members
in the United States.
Mendoza and Dr. Hon Garcia, a senior lecturer in
family medicine, are working to change figures like
that. Their efforts recently received a $1.5 million
shot in the arm — in the form of a three-year grant
from the U.S. Public Health Service.

The grant, awarded to Stanford's Center of Excel
lence, will fund efforts to recruit African-American,
Native American, Mexican-American and mainland
Puerto Rican medical students, fellows, interns, res
idents and faculty. Unlike Asian-Americans, such
minorities have been underrepresented in medical
schools.
In addition, the money may be used for minority
health care research and cross-cultural education.
The goal of the center's programs is to produce
physicians sensitive to the needs of
minority populations, since almost
all medical students will have to
treat patients and colleagues from
different racial and ethnic back
grounds. In the programs, medical
students learn about different cul
tures and patient groups, taking
into account variables such as fam
ily and living environment that
can impact health care treatment.
One specific plan to address

minority health care issues is a
cross-cultural medicine course
that will focus on "ethnic and cul
tural dynamics, such as belief sys
tems and communication do's and
don'ts when treating ethnic
patients," Garcia said.
Donald Warne, president of the
Stanford American Indian Medical
Students, said that there is defi
nitely a need for such a program.
"Medicine is cross-cultural.
There are few places you will go
where you will see only one type of
patient. To provide only one per
spective is doing a disservice to
students and to patients," he said.

Warne said that although there
have been some improvements in
covering minority health issues,
such as cross-cultural aspects
brought into the ambulatory pro
gram, there is a need for a greater
emphasis on minority issues and
more minority faculty.
"I have no role models (in the
Medical School)," said Warne.
"There are very few minority fac
ulty members."
Warne, who plans to practice
primary care on a reservation, said
that there are very few Native
Americans at Stanford because
"people think of Stanford as some

thing unattainable."
Garcia agreed that the lack of
minority faculty members is a
problem and said one of the major
uses of the grant will be to increase
recruitment of underrepresented
minorities.
For example, there will be more
recruitment trips to colleges and a
stronger communication network
between minority medical stu
dents and alumni, he said.
However, merely recruiting
more minorities will not solve the
entire problem of underrepresen
tation, said Garcia. To increase the
number of minority role models,

the center will try to introduce
more minority students to
research and encourage them to
pursue academic medicine.
In the past, Garcia said, "the
theme has been to return to the
community and make a differ
ence." Students are now beginning
to see that they can have a large
impact on the community by doing
academic research.
Garcia plans to offer more
research training, seminars and
mentors for underrepresented
minorities. The early matriculation
program, started in 1984, gives stu
dents an opportunity to do research

and take two courses prior to their
first year of medical school. Stu
dents work with faculty members
and are able to take a reduced
course load during their first two
quarters. Garcia hopes to expand
the program with the grant.
Another proposed program is
the minority grand rounds which
will provide a forum for faculty
and students to share research and
findings on minority health care
issues.
A minority health care confer
ence and a Minority Health Infor
mation Center could be in the near
future.
