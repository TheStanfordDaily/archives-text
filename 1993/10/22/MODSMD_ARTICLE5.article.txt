# Laser-light show in lieu of Bonfire?
## Multi-media production may be held in front of Hoover Tower 
### Skip Schwartz Senior staff writer 
The now-extinguished Big
Game Bonfire previously held at
Lake Lagunita may rise from its
ashes like a phoenix in the form of
a multi-media event in front of
Hoover Tower.
If University officials approve
the Axe Committee's plan, a com
bination light show, laser show
and concert could be held in the
large open area around the foun
tain between Hoover Tower and
Memorial Auditorium, said senior
Steve Zika, the Axe Committee's
chair.
The "beautiful setting" would
provide the pre-Big Game event
with good projection facilities and
bring "an immediate draw from
Gaieties," Zika said.
Although final plans for the
event are pending the approval of
the location, Zika said "the idea of
a fire will be there" at the event. A
decision about the use of this loca
tion is expected to be made today

by Lois Wagner, director of
Events and Services, he said.
The Axe Committee settled on
the new event and its location
after brainstorming for several
nights about a replacement for
the Bonfire, Zika added.
Zika said he spoke with Dean of
Students Michael Jackson last
week about the committee's gen
eral proposal to use the fountain
area, and submitted a written pro
posal on Monday.
He said the delay in the deci
sion was due to a three day ab
sence of Jackson, who has been
out of town and sick. "Michael
Jackson is a big player in this but
he hasn't been around to think
about it," Zika said.
Wagner said that an additional
delay was also due to the fact that
the proposal has brought up sev
eral issues that required her to
talk with other campus officials.
The plan to use the fountain
has required a lot of "negotiating
about what we are going to do
and where," Zika said.
For example, Zika said he had
to meet with officials at the
Hoover Institution regarding
potential uses of the area around
Hoover Tower. While Hoover
officials OK'd the hanging of a
banner from the tower, Zika said
other suggested possibilities for
the event were not approved.
If the fountain area is given
University approval, Zika said
details of the event will be final
ized by early next week.
If the fountain area is not
approved, Zika said White Plaza

will be the alternative venue.
Although the new event does
not have a formal title yet, Zika
said Axe Committee members are
calling it"the Non-Fire Rally."
The Axe Committee decided at
the beginning of October not to
hold the annual bonfire after it was
discovered that a population of
soon-to-be endangered tiger sala
manders live in Ijake Lagunita.
The six-inch amphibians, rec
ognized by their black skin dotted
with white spots, live in cracks of
mud in the lake bed before it
begins to fill up with water.
Zika said that although many
students were disappointed with
the Bonfire's cancellation, "No
one has come to me and said they
think we should have gone ahead
with (the bonfire]."
