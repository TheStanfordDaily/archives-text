# Law group to help sex assault victims
## Student plans legal-aid program 
### Josh Green Staff writer 
While there are numerous sex
ual assault resources on campus,
none offer legal advice. But one
law student is trying to change
this by organizing a new sexual as
sault legal advocacy group to be
launched in the spring.
Second-year law student Isabel
Traugott is working on a program
that will provide confidential legal
advice to victims of sexual assault,
informing them about everything
from how to deal with police ques
tions to what legal actions they
can file. The program will train
eight to 10 law students who will
act as legal counselors.
"People are always hesitant to
go to the authorities, across the
board," Traugott said.
"We can tell them what police
officers are like, and we'll even go
with them to be questioned, if

they want us there.
"The main advantage is that
we're students," she said "People
will be coming to their peers to get
advice and find out the options
available to them."
Traugott is currently trying to
gather information on people who
have been sexually assaulted so
that the group will be prepared to
deal with a whole range of issues
once they get started.
The new group, tentatively
named the Sexual Assault Legal
Advocacy Group, is intended to
complement the already existing
psychological counseling pro
grams on campus. It will work out
of the Law School and receive re
ferrals from Counseling and Psy
chological Services (CAPS) at
Cowell Student Health Center.
The project started when
CAPS staff psychiatrist Gail
Prichard contacted Law Profs.
Deborah Rhode and Sally Dick
son, and asked them if they
could provide any legal informa
tion that could help victims of
sexual assault. Traugott got the
call.
She is now working on a
directed research project super
vised by Dickson and Prof.
Robert Weisberg, focused on set
ting up the group and writing
the training manual for student
legal counselors.
The group has not established
funding yet, but Traugott is
"pretty confident" that it will be

able to find resources from the
many grants available for
women's issues projects.
Weisberg said that although
the group is forming in the
wake of Stanford's new sexual
harassment policy implemented
two weeks ago, it will deal only
with sexual assault, not harass
ment.
"The program is really more
designed for rape cases," Weis
berg said. "If it had the collater
al effect of getting people to talk
about sexual harassment, that
would be great."
Traugott said she wants the
group to stay small and focused
when it starts out, but "in the
bigger picture" the group may
eventually help in sexual harass
ment cases. She hopes that the

group will become a permanent
fixture among the resources
open to sexual assault victims.
Dickson said that the project
will be an invaluable source for
those who are unfamiliar with
the process of reporting a sexual
assault.
"When a woman goes to the
police, she wants to know, 'What
are some of the questions they're
going to ask?' " Dickson said.
"She doesn't know how the crim
inal justice system works,
because there's a certain level of
unawareness about these things.
We can help her understand
what channels are available to
her."
Traugott, who has bache
lor's and master's degrees in
English from the University of

Chicago, has done extensive
research preparing for the pro
ject, talking to sexual assault
legal counseling groups at Cor
nell, Brown and the University
of Hartford.
Last summer Traugott
worked in the Sexual Assault
Unit at the Santa Clara County
District Attorney's Office. She
said that she would use what she
learned and the people she met
to establish important liaisons
between the law students and
police officers.

Women interested in speaking to
Isabel Traugott about their sexu
al assault experiences can con
tact her at 941-1157. All the
information will remain confi
dential.
