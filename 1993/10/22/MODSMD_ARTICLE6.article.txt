# Law group to help sex assault victims
## Student plans legal-aid program 
### Josh Green Staff writer 
While there are numerous sex
ual assault resources on campus,
none offer legal advice. But one
law student is trying to change
this by organizing a new sexual as
sault legal advocacy group to be
launched in the spring.
Second-year law student Isabel
Traugott is working on a program
that will provide confidential legal
advice to victims of sexual assault,
informing them about everything
from how to deal with police ques
tions to what legal actions they
can file. The program will train
eight to 10 law students who will
act as legal counselors.
"People are always hesitant to
go to the authorities, across the
board," Traugott said.
"We can tell them what police
officers are like, and we'll even go
with them to be questioned, if

they want us there.
"The main advantage is that
we're students," she said "People
will be coming to their peers to get
advice and find out the options
available to them."
Traugott is currently trying to
gather information on people who
have been sexually assaulted so
that the group will be prepared to
deal with a whole range of issues
once they get started.
The new group, tentatively
named the Sexual Assault Legal
Advocacy Group, is intended to
complement the already existing
psychological counseling pro
grams on campus. It will work out
of the Law School and receive re
ferrals from Counseling and Psy
chological Services (CAPS) at
Cowell Student Health Center.
