# Sun Devil coach Snyder beats the odds, leads Arizona State
## 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
Arizona State head coach Bruce
Snyder is no stranger to overcom
ing long odds. And that is exactly
the former California coach's task
today as he brings his Sun Devil
team to Palo Alto to battle Bill
Walsh and the Cardinal.
In just his second year at Ari
zona State, Snyder is trying to
bring respectability to a struggling
program. Taking over a much-ma
ligned squad in 1992, Snyder led
the Sun Devils to a winning record
(6-5), including wins in five of his
last seven games.
In 1992 the Sun Devils were
forced to start three different red
shirt freshman quarterbacks in
the first three games of the season.
Nevertheless, Snyder, as has been

his hallmark, guided his team
back from adversity. In battling
toward a winning record, the Sun
Devils shut out Louisville, 19-0,
and UCLA, 20-0. They culminated
their season with a thrilling 7-6
come-from-behind victory over in
state rival Arizona.
"I'm really intrigued with the
potential of Arizona State in terms
of success," said Snyder. "One of
my major objectives as a coach is
how hard the team plays, that's
my signature on a team."
So far, the 1993 season has been
a disappointing one for Sun Devil
fans. Like Stanford, Arizona State
comes into today's game with a 2-4
record overall and an 0-3 mark in
the Pacific 10 Conference. Also like
Stanford, Arizona State's defense
remains a major concern.
"We can't get in a shootout and

expect to win," Snyder said. "I don't
think we're mature enough to be
able to do that." Arizona State has
also been rattled by injuries and,
with a tough schedule still ahead,
today's matchup could be critical
for team morale. The Sun Devils
will still play talented teams such as
Washington, California, UCLA and
Arizona before the season ends.
"I think it's important that the
team witness in me and in my staff
a consistency about how to be suc
cessful," Snyder said. "Eventually
things will turn."
"This is my third [time] trying
to turn a program around and I
think I have a feel for it. I know
that consistency is the key issue in
the whole process." Snyder has
also built successful collegiate pro
grams from scratch at Utah State
and California.
Before moving to Arizona
State, Snyder coached the Golden
Bears for five seasons. At Berke
ley, Snyder inherited a 2-7 team
with little talent in 1987 and es
tablished a winner. During his
tenure at Cal, Snyder amassed a
record of 29-24-4, including bowl
wins in 1990 and 1991. He guided
the Golden Bears to a 10-2 record,
a No. 8 national ranking and a Cit
rus Bowl Victory over Atlantic
Coast Conference champion
Clemson in his last season. Prior
to Snyder's arrival, Cal had been
to just one bowl game since 1958.
At Utah State, Snyder's Aggies
posted improved seasons each year
from 1976 to 1979. In 1983 he be
came the rushing coordinator for
the Los Angeles Rams and coached
such talents as Eric Dickerson. At
California, Snyder was named Pac
-10 coach of the year in 1990.
"Bruce has one of the keenest
minds in football today, said
Stanford coach Bill Walsh. "He's
extremely gifted in motivating
players and he's a very assertive
and demanding coach."
"The goal at the beginning of
every year will be to go to the Rose
Bowl," Snyder said. "We're going to
come out of the gate every year with
serious intentions. This school
with the academics, the tradition,
the facilities and the weather has
all the ingredients to be in the top
-10 each year and even to win a na
tional championship."

tenure at Cal, Snyder amassed a
record of 29-24-4, including bowl
wins in 1990 and 1991. He guided
the Golden Bears to a 10-2 record,
a No. 8 national ranking and a Cit
rus Bowl Victory over Atlantic
Coast Conference champion
Clemson in his last season. Prior
to Snyder's arrival, Cal had been
to just one bowl game since 1958.
At Utah State, Snyder's Aggies
posted improved seasons each year
from 1976 to 1979. In 1983 he be
came the rushing coordinator for
the Los Angeles Rams and coached
such talents as Eric Dickerson. At
California, Snyder was named Pac
-10 coach of the year in 1990.
"Bruce has one of the keenest
minds in football today, said
Stanford coach Bill Walsh. "He's
extremely gifted in motivating
players and he's a very assertive
and demanding coach."
"The goal at the beginning of
every year will be to go to the Rose
Bowl," Snyder said. "We're going to
come out of the gate every year with
serious intentions. This school
with the academics, the tradition,
the facilities and the weather has
all the ingredients to be in the top
-10 each year and even to win a na
tional championship."
