# Shante's inferno burns opposing quarterbacks

Steve Stenstrom would like to see as lit
tle as possible of Arizona State's standout
defensive end Shante Carver this after
noon. Don't expect that to happen, howev
er, as Carver has wreaked havoc upon quar
terbacks across the land for four years at
ASU. While questions abound about an
ASU defense that has given up 119 points
in its first three Pacific 10 Conference
games, the only question about Carver is
how many sacks he'll accumulate before his
college career ends.
Coming into this season, Carver was
hardly an unknown. In his previous three
years, he recorded at least 10 sacks each
season. That led the Arizona State media
guide to present a "Sack-by'sack with Carv
er" feature in its 1993 edition. In addition,
several preseason publications, including
the NCAA Football Preview and Playboy
Magazine, tabbed Carver as the top return
ing defensive lineman in the nation.
Carver is living up to the preseason
hoopla, proving himself to be a veritable
sack machine. In six games, he has record
ed seven sacks, giving him 38 for his career
and 10 more than the old ASU record.
Carver began terrorizing opposing signal
callers during his 1990 season, in which he
lead the team with 10 sacks as a redshirt
freshman.
The Sun Devil's favorite victims are the
quarterbacks of Washington State; Carver
has enveloped Cougar pass-callers ten
times in his collegiate career. Moreover, in
last season's game against ASU's Pac-10
rival, Carver deflected two Drew Bledsoe
passes and blocked both a field goal and a
punt.
Furthermore, so far this season the de
fensive end has accumulated 51 total tack
les, 34 of them solo, and has registered a
pass deflection and a blocked field goal. He
only needs eight more tackles this year in

order to match his personal high of 59 he
set last year.
The 6-foot-5-inch, 240-pounder from
Stockton, Calif, compensates for his lack of
size with extraordinary quickness. This
quickness allows him to penetrate the back
field and stop the run as well as the pass.
But it is still his pass-rushing ability that
wins Carver national recognition. "Shante
Carver is a special football player," said
ASU coach Bruce Snyder. "He just has a
natural instinct of knowing how to get to
the quarterback."
Washington State head coach Mark
Price, who has witnessed 10 of Carver's ca
reer sacks come against his team, also gush
es with praise. "We think Shante Carver is
Superman," Price said. "He's the greatest
pass rusher in the world."
Not surprisingly, Carver is a semifinalist
for the Lombardi Award, presented annual
ly to the nation's top defensive lineman or
linebacker, and he is expected to be among
the four finalists for the award. Modestly,
the senior shares credit with the ASU sec
ondary for his success.
"My (defensive backs) have a lot to do
with it, " said Carver. "I always tell my
DB's, 'Give me four seconds and I'll get
there.' " The Cardinal offensive line has
seldom given Stenstrom four seconds all
season, and Carver could respond with a
huge game.
Despite Carver's sensational accom
plishments, his Sun Devils have been disap
pointing as a team this season. The squad
some insiders picked to go to the Rose Bowl
is 2-4 overall, and, like Stanford, 0-3 in the
Pac-10. But Carver remains upbeat.
"There are going to be some highs and
lows," he said. "I love playing the game. I'm
just happy to go out there and play every
Saturday."
Opposing quarterbacks aren't quite so
happy about facing Shante Carver on Sat
urdays.
