# Roberts makes the grade, on the field and off
## Transfer from Miami pursues yards and books with equal vigor 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
Ellery Roberts is a man with perspective.
He has survived five years of NCAA foot
ball, two of which he was forced to watch
from the sidelines. He has undergone the rig
orous process of transferring from one uni
versity to another. He has overcome compli
cated surgery. But through it all, Roberts has
kept one goal firmly in sight a successful
entrance into life after collegiate football.
The transfer experience came first. Con
sidered one of the top running backs in the
nation as a senior at Chaminade High
School in Long Island, N.Y., Roberts decid
ed to attend the football juggernaut Univer
sity of Miami. As a freshman, he was talent
ed enough to make the traveling team.
But by the end of his first semester,
Roberts began to second-guess his choice of
Miami. He came from an academically accom
plished family and realized the University of
Miami did not meet his educational needs.
"I didn't feel as if all my abilities were
being used," said Roberts. "I had always
been a good student in high school and, ba
sically, I gave up academics in order to play
football at Miami. Once I realized I had sold
myself short intellectually, I had to leave.
Luckily, I was able to come to a school like
Stanford where I could pursue both my ath
letic and academic interests."
Those academic interests included a dou
ble major in English and African-American
studies. But Roberts paid a price for his
transfer NCAA regulations forced him to
sit out thel9B9 season. He made his Cardinal
debut in 1990, but saw limited action, finish
ing the season with 84 yards on 28 carries.
Disaster struck during summer work
outs prior to the 1991 campaign. "It was re
ally strange. I just woke up one morning
with pain in my shoulders," Roberts said.
Tests revealed that he had a bulging disc
in his cervical canal. Surgery to correct the
problem in October caused Roberts to miss
the entire '9l season. During a long and ar
duous recovery, Roberts wondered if his
football-playing days were over. "The
thought crossed my mind a few times," he
said. "At that time, I was really glad I had
transferred. Even if I couldn't play football,
I would get a degree from a top-notch
school."
Roberts made it back for the 1992 cam
paign, but his recovery slowed him down.
"If you had asked me then (about the in
jury), I would've said that it wasn't bother
ing me. But now, looking back at the tapes,
I can see that I was a little bit tentative."

By the end of the season, Roberts regained
his health and the form he had flashed at
Miami. In his last four games, he racked up
381 yards on 65 carries and three touchdowns.
Life after football would have to wait.
The NCAA granted Roberts another year of
eligibilty for the '93 season because of his
past injury. Cardinal fans expected Roberts
to lead the young Cardinal team to another
winning season with his bullish runs.
However, Roberts and the rest of the
Stanford running attack have struggled this

season. The Cardinal ranks last in the Pac
-10 in rushing offense, averaging a measly
54.8 yards per game, less than half the aver
age of the ninth-ranked team. Part of the
problem involves the offensive line's failure
to open many holes for Roberts and his run
ning mates to pick their way through.
Coach Bill Walsh said that in the next five
games, Stanford's ability to run the ball will de
termine the team's success. In order for Stan
ford to gain the 150 yards per game that Walsh
demands, Roberts must shine once again.

Roberts is optimistic. "We have a young
team and a young (offensive) line, and coach
just keeps telling me to be patient," he said.
"We should be able to put it all together in
time for the end of the season."
No matter what happens, Roberts will
maintain his perspective on life and how
football fits into it.
And, with a little luck, some help from
the offensive line and hard work, Ellery
Roberts will get the yards the team needs,
along with the education he desires.

Ellery Roberts powers his way past a Notre Dame defender. Roberts has struggled to get on track in the 1993 season, averaging only
3.3 yards per rushing attempt, but will have to carry most of the load if the Cardinal running game is to improve.

Roberts began to second-guess his choice of
Miami. He came from an academically accom
plished family and realized the University of
Miami did not meet his educational needs.
"I didn't feel as if all my abilities were
being used," said Roberts. "I had always
been a good student in high school and, ba
sically, I gave up academics in order to play
football at Miami. Once I realized I had sold
myself short intellectually, I had to leave.
Luckily, I was able to come to a school like
Stanford where I could pursue both my ath
letic and academic interests."
Those academic interests included a dou
ble major in English and African-American
studies. But Roberts paid a price for his
transfer NCAA regulations forced him to
sit out thel9B9 season. He made his Cardinal
debut in 1990, but saw limited action, finish
ing the season with 84 yards on 28 carries.
Disaster struck during summer work
outs prior to the 1991 campaign. "It was re
ally strange. I just woke up one morning
with pain in my shoulders," Roberts said.
Tests revealed that he had a bulging disc
in his cervical canal. Surgery to correct the
problem in October caused Roberts to miss
the entire '9l season. During a long and ar
duous recovery, Roberts wondered if his
football-playing days were over. "The
thought crossed my mind a few times," he
said. "At that time, I was really glad I had
transferred. Even if I couldn't play football,
I would get a degree from a top-notch
school."
Roberts made it back for the 1992 cam
paign, but his recovery slowed him down.
"If you had asked me then (about the in
jury), I would've said that it wasn't bother
ing me. But now, looking back at the tapes,
I can see that I was a little bit tentative."

By the end of the season, Roberts regained
his health and the form he had flashed at
Miami. In his last four games, he racked up
381 yards on 65 carries and three touchdowns.
Life after football would have to wait.
The NCAA granted Roberts another year of
eligibilty for the '93 season because of his
past injury. Cardinal fans expected Roberts
to lead the young Cardinal team to another
winning season with his bullish runs.
However, Roberts and the rest of the
Stanford running attack have struggled this

season. The Cardinal ranks last in the Pac
-10 in rushing offense, averaging a measly
54.8 yards per game, less than half the aver
age of the ninth-ranked team. Part of the
problem involves the offensive line's failure
to open many holes for Roberts and his run
ning mates to pick their way through.
Coach Bill Walsh said that in the next five
games, Stanford's ability to run the ball will de
termine the team's success. In order for Stan
ford to gain the 150 yards per game that Walsh
demands, Roberts must shine once again.

Roberts is optimistic. "We have a young
team and a young (offensive) line, and coach
just keeps telling me to be patient," he said.
"We should be able to put it all together in
time for the end of the season."
No matter what happens, Roberts will
maintain his perspective on life and how
football fits into it.
And, with a little luck, some help from
the offensive line and hard work, Ellery
Roberts will get the yards the team needs,
along with the education he desires.

Ellery Roberts powers his way past a Notre Dame defender. Roberts has struggled to get on track in the 1993 season, averaging only
3.3 yards per rushing attempt, but will have to carry most of the load if the Cardinal running game is to improve.
