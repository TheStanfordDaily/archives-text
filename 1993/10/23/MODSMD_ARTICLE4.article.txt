# Wildcats pounce on Pac-10 Conference
## Arizona starts with purr-fect 6-0 record in chase for Rose Bowl berth 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Editorial staff 
It's the middle of the season for almost
every football team in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. With three-time defending league
champion Washington serving a two-year
suspension from all bowl games, other Pac
-10 teams are looking to capitalize on the
Huskies' problems and land themselves in
the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day. Let's
take a look at each team, from the top to the
bottom.

1. Arizona Wild
cats (4-0 in the
Pac-10, 6-0 over
all) After last week's
come-from-behind
victory over the Car
dinal, Arizona im-

proved to 6-0, its best start ever, and rose to
No. 7 in the AP and USA Today/CNN Polls.
The Wildcats are the front-runner to take
the Pac-10 title. All-American nose guard
Rob Waldrop anchors the top defensive unit
in the country, which has limited the oppo
sition to a mere 189.2 yards per game defen
sively, including an unheard-of 6.3 rushing
yards per game. Arizona has been mediocre
offensively, and quarterback Dan White has
struggled all season. During the next two
weeks, the Wildcats will face Washington
State and UCLA and try to clinch the Pac
-10 outright with two victories.

2. Washington State
Cougars (3-1 in the Pac
-10, 5-2 overall) The
Cougars have exceeded al
most everyone's expecta
tions. Their defensive unit
is ranked second in the Pac
-10 in rushing and total de

fense. Despite the departure of quarterback
Drew Bledsoe, the first pick in the National
Football League draft, and wide receiver
Philip Bobo, the Cougars have still managed
to score points, with quarterback Mike Pat
tinson and wide receiver Deron Pointer step
ping into the roles vacated by Bledsoe and
Bobo. They currently are third in the Pac-10
in scoring, but will need every point this
week as they face undefeated Arizona to try
to force a first-place tie in the Pac-10.

2. USC Trojans (3-1 in the
Pac-10, 4-3 overall) John
Robinson's Trojans had high
expectations coming into the
season, but injuries to start
ing tailback Dwight McFad
den and Rory Fields have
given USC a reality check.

Despite humiliating losses to North Caroli
na and Arizona and a close loss to Penn
State, USC is still in the Rose Bowl hunt
should Arizona lose twice. The Trojans are
led by junior quarterback Rob Johnson and
All-America candidate wide receiver John
nie Morton, who is currently leading the
Pac-10 with 54 receptions for 879 yards and
nine touchdowns. However, preseason Ail-
American defensive end Willie McGinest
has not yet regained his 1992 form as an
outside linebacker.

4. UCLA Bruins (2-1 in
the Pac-10, 4-2 overall)
After two close losses to
Cal and Nebraska involv
ing numerous turnovers
and sloppy play, people

began to wonder whether UCLA would
have any hope of contending in the Pac-10.
The Bruins responded with a 28-25 victory
over Stanford, the first of four consecutive
UCLA victories. Last week against Wash
ington, wide receiver J.J. Stokes scored four
touchdowns, including one on a school
record 95-yard pass play in a 39-25 rout of
the Huskies. The Bruin offensive line, led
by Ail-American tackle Vaughn Parker and
All-Pac 10 tackle Craig Novitsky, has al
lowed only four quarterback sacks in the
last four games. Conversely, Bruin outside
linebacker Jamir Miller has registered 9.5
sacks over that same four-game span.

4. Washington
Huskies (2-1 in the
Pac-10, 5-2 over
all) The Huskies
were hit hard by the
Pac-10 for alleged
booster violations,
but have managed

to play well despite their two-year suspen
sion from postseason play. Running back
Napoleon Kaufman leads the Pac-10 with
656 yards rushing and seven rushing

touchdowns. Quarterback Damon Huard
has struggled to fill the shoes of his prede
cessor, Billy Joe Hobert, but the Husky de
fense remains true to form, currently
ranked third in the Pac-10 in total defense.
The Huskies pulled out a last-second 24-23
victory two weeks ago in Berkeley, but were
trampled by the Bruins last week at the
Rose Bowl.

6. California Golden
Bears (2-2 in the Pac
-10, 5-2 overall) The
Weenies rose to 15th on
the Associated Press
Poll after starting the
season 5-0, but have
dropped like an anvil out
of the top 25 after a last
minute 24-23 loss to

Washington in Berkeley two weeks ago and
an embarrassing 34-7 defeat to Washington
State last week in Pullman. Linebacker Jer
rott Willard leads the Pac-10 with 56 unas
sisted tackles and 83 total tackles, but in
juries have hampered the Bears this season;
running back Lindsay Chapman is still re
covering from a foot injury and quarterback
Dave Barr, who leads the Pac-10 in passing
efficiency, did not play last week due to a
shoulder injury. Cal's two Pac-10 losses all
but eliminated the Bears from Rose Bowl
contention.

7. Oregon Ducks (1-2
in the Pac-10, 4-2
overall) The Ducks' of
fense has been impres
sive during their first six
games, especially during
the first quarter, in
which they have out
scored their opponents

68-7. They have been involved in quite a few
nail-biters: three weeks ago, they watched
Cal rally from a 30-0 deficit to triumph, 42-
41; last week, they trailed early to Arizona
State, but rallied to defeat the Sun Devils.
Quarterback Danny O'Neill currently leads
the Pac-10 in total offense, and is on pace to
break John Elway's Pac-10 single-season
passing yardage record. Despite the Ducks'
success offensively, the Oregon defense has
struggled noticeably, giving up an average of
369 yards per game.

8. Oregon State
Beavers (1-3 in the Pac
-10, 3-4 overall) Oregon
State's "run first, pass
later" style of spread-op
tion offense has netted
300.4 yards rushing per
game, with J.J. Young

leading the charge with 587 yards on 68 car
ries, third in the Pac-10. In fact, the Beavers
are second in the nation to Army in rushing
yards. Unfortunately, they have managed
only 27.0 yards per game passing and contin
ue to struggle defensively. They have already
exceeded many critics' expectations by win
ning three games and will try to make it four
against UCLA today in Corvallis.

9. Stanford Cardinal (0-
3 in the Pac-10, 2-4 over
all) Defense, Defense, De
fense. That's what the Car
dinal has lacked this season
It has given up an astro
nomical 463.7 yards per
game of total offense, but
showed significant signs of
improvement in last

week's loss to Arizona. In addition, the Car
dinal has been unable to establish a consis
tent rushing attack; the passing attack has
compensated for this shortcoming quar
terback Steve Stenstrom, second in the Pac
-10 in total offense, has passed for 300 yards
in a school-record five consecutive games,
and is on a pace to break many of John
Elway's passing records.

9. Arizona State Sun Dev
ils (0-3, 2-4 overall) The
Sun Devils are struggling to
get back on track after a
heartbreaking 45-36 loss to
Oregon. Redshirt freshman
quarterback Jake Plummer
took over the starting role last

week from sophomore Grady Benton, and
played well despite losing. Running back
Mario Bates had his best game of the season,
gaining 111 yards on 24 carries. Defensive
end Shante Carver, a semi-finalist for the
Lombardi award as the best lineman in col
lege football, continues to terrorize quarter
backs and leads a defense that has struggled
against the pass despite his presence.

Beavers (1-3 in the Pac
-10, 3-4 overall) Oregon
State's "run first, pass
later" style of spread-op
tion offense has netted
300.4 yards rushing per
game, with J.J. Young

leading the charge with 587 yards on 68 car
ries, third in the Pac-10. In fact, the Beavers
are second in the nation to Army in rushing
yards. Unfortunately, they have managed
only 27.0 yards per game passing and contin
ue to struggle defensively. They have already
exceeded many critics' expectations by win
ning three games and will try to make it four
against UCLA today in Corvallis.

9. Stanford Cardinal (0-
3 in the Pac-10, 2-4 over
all) Defense, Defense, De
fense. That's what the Car
dinal has lacked this season
It has given up an astro
nomical 463.7 yards per
game of total offense, but
showed significant signs of
improvement in last

week's loss to Arizona. In addition, the Car
dinal has been unable to establish a consis
tent rushing attack; the passing attack has
compensated for this shortcoming quar
terback Steve Stenstrom, second in the Pac
-10 in total offense, has passed for 300 yards
in a school-record five consecutive games,
and is on a pace to break many of John
Elway's passing records.

9. Arizona State Sun Dev
ils (0-3, 2-4 overall) The
Sun Devils are struggling to
get back on track after a
heartbreaking 45-36 loss to
Oregon. Redshirt freshman
quarterback Jake Plummer
took over the starting role last

week from sophomore Grady Benton, and
played well despite losing. Running back
Mario Bates had his best game of the season,
gaining 111 yards on 24 carries. Defensive
end Shante Carver, a semi-finalist for the
Lombardi award as the best lineman in col
lege football, continues to terrorize quarter
backs and leads a defense that has struggled
against the pass despite his presence.










It's the middle of the season for almost
every football team in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. With three-time defending league
champion Washington serving a two-year
suspension from all bowl games, other Pac
-10 teams are looking to capitalize on the
Huskies' problems and land themselves in
the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day. Let's
take a look at each team, from the top to the
bottom.

1. Arizona Wild
cats (4-0 in the
Pac-10, 6-0 over
all) After last week's
come-from-behind
victory over the Car
dinal, Arizona im-

proved to 6-0, its best start ever, and rose to
No. 7 in the AP and USA Today/CNN Polls.
The Wildcats are the front-runner to take
the Pac-10 title. All-American nose guard
Rob Waldrop anchors the top defensive unit
in the country, which has limited the oppo
sition to a mere 189.2 yards per game defen
sively, including an unheard-of 6.3 rushing
yards per game. Arizona has been mediocre
offensively, and quarterback Dan White has
struggled all season. During the next two
weeks, the Wildcats will face Washington
State and UCLA and try to clinch the Pac
-10 outright with two victories.

2. Washington State
Cougars (3-1 in the Pac
-10, 5-2 overall) The
Cougars have exceeded al
most everyone's expecta
tions. Their defensive unit
is ranked second in the Pac
-10 in rushing and total de

fense. Despite the departure of quarterback
Drew Bledsoe, the first pick in the National
Football League draft, and wide receiver
Philip Bobo, the Cougars have still managed
to score points, with quarterback Mike Pat
tinson and wide receiver Deron Pointer step
ping into the roles vacated by Bledsoe and
Bobo. They currently are third in the Pac-10
in scoring, but will need every point this
week as they face undefeated Arizona to try
to force a first-place tie in the Pac-10.

2. USC Trojans (3-1 in the
Pac-10, 4-3 overall) John
Robinson's Trojans had high
expectations coming into the
season, but injuries to start
ing tailback Dwight McFad
den and Rory Fields have
given USC a reality check.

Despite humiliating losses to North Caroli
na and Arizona and a close loss to Penn
State, USC is still in the Rose Bowl hunt
should Arizona lose twice. The Trojans are
led by junior quarterback Rob Johnson and
All-America candidate wide receiver John
nie Morton, who is currently leading the
Pac-10 with 54 receptions for 879 yards and
nine touchdowns. However, preseason Ail-
American defensive end Willie McGinest
has not yet regained his 1992 form as an
outside linebacker.

4. UCLA Bruins (2-1 in
the Pac-10, 4-2 overall)
After two close losses to
Cal and Nebraska involv
ing numerous turnovers
and sloppy play, people

began to wonder whether UCLA would
have any hope of contending in the Pac-10.
The Bruins responded with a 28-25 victory
over Stanford, the first of four consecutive
UCLA victories. Last week against Wash
ington, wide receiver J.J. Stokes scored four
touchdowns, including one on a school
record 95-yard pass play in a 39-25 rout of
the Huskies. The Bruin offensive line, led
by Ail-American tackle Vaughn Parker and
All-Pac 10 tackle Craig Novitsky, has al
lowed only four quarterback sacks in the
last four games. Conversely, Bruin outside
linebacker Jamir Miller has registered 9.5
sacks over that same four-game span.

4. Washington
Huskies (2-1 in the
Pac-10, 5-2 over
all) The Huskies
were hit hard by the
Pac-10 for alleged
booster violations,
but have managed

to play well despite their two-year suspen
sion from postseason play. Running back
Napoleon Kaufman leads the Pac-10 with
656 yards rushing and seven rushing

touchdowns. Quarterback Damon Huard
has struggled to fill the shoes of his prede
cessor, Billy Joe Hobert, but the Husky de
fense remains true to form, currently
ranked third in the Pac-10 in total defense.
The Huskies pulled out a last-second 24-23
victory two weeks ago in Berkeley, but were
trampled by the Bruins last week at the
Rose Bowl.

6. California Golden
Bears (2-2 in the Pac
-10, 5-2 overall) The
Weenies rose to 15th on
the Associated Press
Poll after starting the
season 5-0, but have
dropped like an anvil out
of the top 25 after a last
minute 24-23 loss to

Washington in Berkeley two weeks ago and
an embarrassing 34-7 defeat to Washington
State last week in Pullman. Linebacker Jer
rott Willard leads the Pac-10 with 56 unas
sisted tackles and 83 total tackles, but in
juries have hampered the Bears this season;
running back Lindsay Chapman is still re
covering from a foot injury and quarterback
Dave Barr, who leads the Pac-10 in passing
efficiency, did not play last week due to a
shoulder injury. Cal's two Pac-10 losses all
but eliminated the Bears from Rose Bowl
contention.

7. Oregon Ducks (1-2
in the Pac-10, 4-2
overall) The Ducks' of
fense has been impres
sive during their first six
games, especially during
the first quarter, in
which they have out
scored their opponents

68-7. They have been involved in quite a few
nail-biters: three weeks ago, they watched
Cal rally from a 30-0 deficit to triumph, 42-
41; last week, they trailed early to Arizona
State, but rallied to defeat the Sun Devils.
Quarterback Danny O'Neill currently leads
the Pac-10 in total offense, and is on pace to
break John Elway's Pac-10 single-season
passing yardage record. Despite the Ducks'
success offensively, the Oregon defense has
struggled noticeably, giving up an average of
369 yards per game.

8. Oregon State
Beavers (1-3 in the Pac
-10, 3-4 overall) Oregon
State's "run first, pass

ranked third in the Pac-10 in total defense.
The Huskies pulled out a last-second 24-23
victory two weeks ago in Berkeley, but were
trampled by the Bruins last week at the
Rose Bowl.

6. California Golden
Bears (2-2 in the Pac
-10, 5-2 overall) The
Weenies rose to 15th on
the Associated Press
Poll after starting the
season 5-0, but have
dropped like an anvil out
of the top 25 after a last
minute 24-23 loss to

Washington in Berkeley two weeks ago and
an embarrassing 34-7 defeat to Washington
State last week in Pullman. Linebacker Jer
rott Willard leads the Pac-10 with 56 unas
sisted tackles and 83 total tackles, but in
juries have hampered the Bears this season;
running back Lindsay Chapman is still re
covering from a foot injury and quarterback
Dave Barr, who leads the Pac-10 in passing
efficiency, did not play last week due to a
shoulder injury. Cal's two Pac-10 losses all
but eliminated the Bears from Rose Bowl
contention.

7. Oregon Ducks (1-2
in the Pac-10, 4-2
overall) The Ducks' of
fense has been impres
sive during their first six
games, especially during
the first quarter, in
which they have out
scored their opponents

68-7. They have been involved in quite a few
nail-biters: three weeks ago, they watched
Cal rally from a 30-0 deficit to triumph, 42-
41; last week, they trailed early to Arizona
State, but rallied to defeat the Sun Devils.
Quarterback Danny O'Neill currently leads
the Pac-10 in total offense, and is on pace to
break John Elway's Pac-10 single-season
passing yardage record. Despite the Ducks'
success offensively, the Oregon defense has
struggled noticeably, giving up an average of
369 yards per game.

8. Oregon State
Beavers (1-3 in the Pac
-10, 3-4 overall) Oregon
State's "run first, pass
later" style of spread-op
tion offense has netted
300.4 yards rushing per
game, with J.J. Young

leading the charge with 587 yards on 68 car
ries, third in the Pac-10. In fact, the Beavers
are second in the nation to Army in rushing
yards. Unfortunately, they have managed
only 27.0 yards per game passing and contin
ue to struggle defensively. They have already
exceeded many critics' expectations by win
ning three games and will try to make it four
against UCLA today in Corvallis.

9. Stanford Cardinal (0-
3 in the Pac-10, 2-4 over
all) Defense, Defense, De
fense. That's what the Car
dinal has lacked this season
It has given up an astro
nomical 463.7 yards per
game of total offense, but
showed significant signs of
improvement in last

week's loss to Arizona. In addition, the Car
dinal has been unable to establish a consis
tent rushing attack; the passing attack has
compensated for this shortcoming quar
terback Steve Stenstrom, second in the Pac
-10 in total offense, has passed for 300 yards
in a school-record five consecutive games,
and is on a pace to break many of John
Elway's passing records.

9. Arizona State Sun Dev
ils (0-3, 2-4 overall) The
Sun Devils are struggling to
get back on track after a
heartbreaking 45-36 loss to
Oregon. Redshirt freshman
quarterback Jake Plummer
took over the starting role last

week from sophomore Grady Benton, and
played well despite losing. Running back
Mario Bates had his best game of the season,
gaining 111 yards on 24 carries. Defensive
end Shante Carver, a semi-finalist for the
Lombardi award as the best lineman in col
lege football, continues to terrorize quarter
backs and leads a defense that has struggled
against the pass despite his presence.
