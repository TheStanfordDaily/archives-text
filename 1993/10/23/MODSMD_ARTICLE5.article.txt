# Cardinal look to cool off the Sun Devils
## Stanford gets breather after three straight losses against top-ranked teams 
### Peter Marks Editorial staff 
According to Stanford Coach Bill
Walsh's bible, on the seventh game
of the season the schedule-making
gods gave the Cardinal a rest. Ari
zona State University represents
only the second squad the Cardinal
has faced this entire season not
ranked among the top 25 teams in
college football. The Sun Devils are
just the type of team Stanford needs
to combat as it limps home from a
devastating, last-second loss to Ari
zona last Saturday.
The Sun Devils have definitely
taken some beatings this season.
Like Stanford, they have not yet
won a game in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, losing to Oregon State,
Washington State and Oregon.
Their two wins came against Utah
and Oklahoma State, neither of
which is a current powerhouse.
ASU head coach Bruce Snyder,
sounding like he needed a good
dose of Prozac, said his team
began the season with high expec
tations but now would settle for a
single win.
According to Snyder, ASU's
problems stem from the lack of
continuity on the coaching staff.
The team has had five different
head coaches since 1979 and, con
sequently, recruiting has suffered.
While NCAA regulations permit
88 scholarships per football team,
ASU may have the fewest number
in the country at 69. And five of
those 69 athletes walked onto the
team. That leaves the Sun Devils
thin at a lot of positions. "We don't
have players on the roster to step
in," complained Snyder.
But Snyder is a coach who knows
how to turn a team around. He
guided a 3-8 Utah State team to a 9-
2 mark within three years. Much to
Stanford's chagrin, Snyder worked
the same magic when he took over
at California, transforming a 3-6-2

team to a 10-2 national contender.
With a favorable climate and top-of
the-line athletic facilities, Snyder
believes he can attract the players
necessary to rebuild ASU. "Arizona
State has the potential to be a great
program," said Snyder.
Like Walsh, Snyder is building
his team with youth. However, in
Snyder's case, he has little choice.
Only 30 lettermen returned to the
Sun Devils' team for the 1993 sea
son, the lowest number at ASU
since 1975.
But don't count the Sun Devils
out. They possess good speed and
their offense can put a lot of points
on the board. "We can't get into a
forward passing derby and expect
to win," said Walsh.
Sophomore tailback Mario
Bates is ASU's most potent offen
sive threat. The sophomore ranks
as the second-leading rusher in
the Pacific 10 Conference with an
average of 84.3 yards per game.
Last week against Oregon he
racked up 111 yards on 24 carries.
Another key player for the Sun
Devils is freshman quarterback
Jake "the Snake" Plummer. He
makes his second start of the sea
son after taking over for the in
jured and ineffective Grady Ben
ton. In his debut last week against
Oregon, Plummer completed 18 of
37 passes for 237 yards in a losing
cause. After the game, Oregon
head coach Rich Brooks praised
Plummer: "He's a good athlete, he
can run, avoid pressure and throw
the ball downfield."
But due to his inexperience,
Plummer makes mistakes, and
putting defensive pressure on him
is the key to stopping ASU's of
fense. Left outside linebacker
Jason White is particularly eager
to get to Plummer they played
against each other on rival high
school teams in Idaho. "It'll be nice
to him him again," said White.
White and the rest of Stan

ford's defense enter today's game
seeking to prove they've turned
the corner. After Washington and
Notre Dame humiliated the Stan
ford 'D,' they shocked the Arizona
Wildcats last week, holding them
to 240 total yards. Walsh contin
ues to play as many freshmen on
defense as he can. Saturday's
game featured safety Charlie
Young, linebackers Nick Watts,
Justin Strand and Leon Vickers,
and defensive end Matt Harper.
Young makes his starting debut
today at free safety.
But the Cardinal are also a bat
tered team. Having already lost
left outside linebacker Brian Bat
son for the season, the Cardinal
will play the last six games with

out the services of center Glen Ca
vanaugh. In addition, free safety
Kevin Garnett, the team's leading
tackier, is doubtful against ASU.
Justin Armour, Stanford's leading
receiver, will also sit out the game
with a separated shoulder.
That shouldn't stop quarter
back Steve Stenstrom from pick
ing apart the ASU defense. The
Sun Devils rank last in passing ef
ficiency defense and ninth in total
defense, just ahead of Stanford.
What might stop Stenstrom is
"Shante's Inferno." Defensive end
Shante Carver has racked up seven
quarterback sacks this season and is
a semi-finalist for the Lombardi
award, presented to the best line
man in college football. "Shante

Carver is the best," said Snyder. "He
has been equally effective against
the run. He never comes out."
Stanford ranks last in the Pac
-10 in protecting their quarterback
and unless the team wants Sten
strom to increase Tylenol sales by
100 percent, they must run the ball
successfully. Walsh wants the
team to average 150 yards rushing
in the next five games, and says
freshman Mike Mitchell will get
more playing time than in the past.
If the running game gets un
tracked against ASU, Stanford
can feasibly win its last six games
and qualify for a bowl. But the
character of the team is still in
question. "We're a team trying to
find itself," said Walsh.

the same magic when he took over
at California, transforming a 3-6-2

team to a 10-2 national contender.
With a favorable climate and top-of
the-line athletic facilities, Snyder
believes he can attract the players
necessary to rebuild ASU. "Arizona
State has the potential to be a great
program," said Snyder.
Like Walsh, Snyder is building
his team with youth. However, in
Snyder's case, he has little choice.
Only 30 lettermen returned to the
Sun Devils' team for the 1993 sea
son, the lowest number at ASU
since 1975.
But don't count the Sun Devils
out. They possess good speed and
their offense can put a lot of points
on the board. "We can't get into a
forward passing derby and expect
to win," said Walsh.
Sophomore tailback Mario
Bates is ASU's most potent offen
sive threat. The sophomore ranks
as the second-leading rusher in
the Pacific 10 Conference with an
average of 84.3 yards per game.
Last week against Oregon he
racked up 111 yards on 24 carries.
Another key player for the Sun
Devils is freshman quarterback
Jake "the Snake" Plummer. He
makes his second start of the sea
son after taking over for the in
jured and ineffective Grady Ben
ton. In his debut last week against
Oregon, Plummer completed 18 of
37 passes for 237 yards in a losing
cause. After the game, Oregon
head coach Rich Brooks praised
Plummer: "He's a good athlete, he
can run, avoid pressure and throw
the ball downfield."
But due to his inexperience,
Plummer makes mistakes, and
putting defensive pressure on him
is the key to stopping ASU's of
fense. Left outside linebacker
Jason White is particularly eager
to get to Plummer they played
against each other on rival high
school teams in Idaho. "It'll be nice
to him him again," said White.
White and the rest of Stan

ford's defense enter today's game
seeking to prove they've turned
the corner. After Washington and
Notre Dame humiliated the Stan
ford 'D,' they shocked the Arizona
Wildcats last week, holding them
to 240 total yards. Walsh contin
ues to play as many freshmen on
defense as he can. Saturday's
game featured safety Charlie
Young, linebackers Nick Watts,
Justin Strand and Leon Vickers,
and defensive end Matt Harper.
Young makes his starting debut
today at free safety.
But the Cardinal are also a bat
tered team. Having already lost
left outside linebacker Brian Bat
son for the season, the Cardinal
will play the last six games with

out the services of center Glen Ca
vanaugh. In addition, free safety
Kevin Garnett, the team's leading
tackier, is doubtful against ASU.
Justin Armour, Stanford's leading
receiver, will also sit out the game
with a separated shoulder.
That shouldn't stop quarter
back Steve Stenstrom from pick
ing apart the ASU defense. The
Sun Devils rank last in passing ef
ficiency defense and ninth in total
defense, just ahead of Stanford.
What might stop Stenstrom is
"Shante's Inferno." Defensive end
Shante Carver has racked up seven
quarterback sacks this season and is
a semi-finalist for the Lombardi
award, presented to the best line
man in college football. "Shante

Carver is the best," said Snyder. "He
has been equally effective against
the run. He never comes out."
Stanford ranks last in the Pac
-10 in protecting their quarterback
and unless the team wants Sten
strom to increase Tylenol sales by
100 percent, they must run the ball
successfully. Walsh wants the
team to average 150 yards rushing
in the next five games, and says
freshman Mike Mitchell will get
more playing time than in the past.
If the running game gets un
tracked against ASU, Stanford
can feasibly win its last six games
and qualify for a bowl. But the
character of the team is still in
question. "We're a team trying to
find itself," said Walsh.

The rapidly improving Cardinal defensive unit converges on a UCLA running back. Stanford's defense
put in its best performance last week against undefeated Arizona.
According to Stanford Coach Bill
Walsh's bible, on the seventh game
of the season the schedule-making
gods gave the Cardinal a rest. Ari
zona State University represents
only the second squad the Cardinal
has faced this entire season not
ranked among the top 25 teams in
college football. The Sun Devils are
just the type of team Stanford needs
to combat as it limps home from a
devastating, last-second loss to Ari
zona last Saturday.
The Sun Devils have definitely
taken some beatings this season.
Like Stanford, they have not yet
won a game in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, losing to Oregon State,
Washington State and Oregon.
Their two wins came against Utah
and Oklahoma State, neither of
which is a current powerhouse.
ASU head coach Bruce Snyder,
sounding like he needed a good
dose of Prozac, said his team
began the season with high expec
tations but now would settle for a
single win.
According to Snyder, ASU's
problems stem from the lack of
continuity on the coaching staff.
The team has had five different
head coaches since 1979 and, con
sequently, recruiting has suffered.
While NCAA regulations permit
88 scholarships per football team,
ASU may have the fewest number
in the country at 69. And five of
those 69 athletes walked onto the
team. That leaves the Sun Devils
thin at a lot of positions. "We don't
have players on the roster to step
in," complained Snyder.
But Snyder is a coach who knows
how to turn a team around. He
guided a 3-8 Utah State team to a 9-
2 mark within three years. Much to
Stanford's chagrin, Snyder worked
the same magic when he took over
at California, transforming a 3-6-2

team to a 10-2 national contender.
With a favorable climate and top-of
the-line athletic facilities, Snyder
