# Arizona State/Stanford Match-Ups
## 
### 
Bates ranks second in the Pacific
10 Conference in yards rushing
per game at 84.3. Only a year after
major reconstructive surgery, the
sophomore averages 4.4 yards per
carry. Roberts averages only 3.3
yards per carry, but his offensive
line hasn't opened any holes for
him. Coach Bill Walsh says Stan
ford needs to average 150 yards
rushing per game, and Roberts
must step up to shoulder most of
that burden.

Thomas leads the Sun Devils with
18 receptions for 214 yards. This
is his first season with Arizona
State after transferring from San
Bernadino Valley College follow
ing a junior college Ail-American
season. Ellis, who struggled dur
ing the Cardinal's first five games,
has returned to the starting line
up after an excellent performance
last week against Arizona. He will
be tested today, since he plays op
posite Vaughn Bryant, the most
experienced Cardinal cornerback.

With seven quarterback sacks al
ready this season, Carver is one of
the most-feared pass rushers in
the country and a semi-finalist for
the Lombardi award, presented
annually to the college football
lineman of the year. He has 38
sacks in 39 career college football
games. Dittman will have his
hands full with Carver, but the
Cardinal's senior left tackle does
have a size advantage.

Newsome leads the Sun Devils
with two interceptions, and is an
other junior college transfer from
San Bernadino Valley College. The
Sun Devils expect he and Kenny
McGill to solidify Arizona State at
the cornerback position. Manning,
a true freshman, has continued to
impress the Stanford coaching
staff with his explosive speed. He
has scored on a touchdown pass of
over 30 yards in each of the last
four weeks. Last week, he hooked
up with quarterback Steve Sten
strom on a 91-yard touchdown re
ception, the third longest touch
down pass in Cardinal history.

Plummer, a redshirt freshman,
was named Arizona State's start
ing quarterback last week, and he
responded with an excellent per
formance, completing 18 of 37
passes for 237 yeards and two
touchdowns. In the first six games
of the 1993 season, Stenstrom has
put up outstanding numbers and
is on a pace to break many of John
Elway's single-season and career
passing records. He has thrown
for over 300 yards in the last five
games, a Cardinal record, and has
16 touchdown passes.

It may be over one hundred de
grees everyday in Arizona, but as
natives of the state say, "It's a dry
heat." Yeah, right, just the kind of
weather in which you can fry an
egg on your car hood. Back in Cali,
we're enjoying just another day in
paradise. Not too hot, not too cold,
but just right. As for the earth
quakes. . . .
