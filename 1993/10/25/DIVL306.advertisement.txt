PHILIPS
All big ideas start with a little light bulb.
Take Philips Semiconductors, for example. Over 100 years ago, a
small Dutch lamp-making business began with one bulb. Today,
that company is Philips Electronics, a solid established international
organization. As part of Philips Electronics North America Corporation,
Philips Semiconductors is the segment of a global organization that
chases the newest "light bulbs" of today's technology—and constant
ly develops and produces the biggest ideas in semiconductors. If you
have the imagination and enthusiasm to turn a tiny spark into a grand
idea, join us at Philips Semiconductors.
We are currently seeking EE graduates or December 1993 EE grad
uates with related RF coursework to join our Communications Product
Group as RF Application Engineers. Your focus will be on IC products
for cellular, cordless, and other wireless communications systems
