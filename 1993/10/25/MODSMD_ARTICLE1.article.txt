The Axe Committee has begun planning out the
details of this year's pre-BigGame rally, after Univer
sity administrators approved its proposal Friday to
hold the event in front of Hoover Tower.
So far, the committee has scheduled for the Nov. 18
event the traditional rally with the football team, a

want us to bother our Palo Alto neighbors."
Zika also said the committee was barred from
using fireworks and, most likely, a small ceremonial
fire.
As in previous years, the pre-Big Game event is
scheduled to follow Gaieties at around 10 p.m. on the
Thursday night before Big Game.
Despite the restrictions on this year's event, Zika
said, "I think it will be a blast. It's definitely 100 per
cent different this year. In previous years, the rally
served as an accessory for the fire. We were there for
the rally, but everyone went to see the fire since it was
the central event. Now there's a completely different
