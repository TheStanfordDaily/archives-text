Shootout in Somalia
MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) - Subma
chine gunfire crackled across central
Mogadishu yesterday on the eve of a protest
that threatens to explode into clan violence.
The gunfight was adjacent to the Kilo
meter Four traffic circle in the southern
stronghold of Gen. Mohamed Farrah Aid id,
whose supporters held their regular Sun
day rally barely a mile away. It wasn't clear
if those in the shootout were affiliated with
Aidid or his opponents.
Aidid's deputy, Mohamed Nur Aliyo,
repeated warnings against a demonstration
planned for today. Protesters plan to cross
the line dividing rival clan leader All Mahdi
Mohamed's territory from south Mogadishu.
There are fears Ali Mahdi wants to pro
voke conflict in hopes that the 33-country

U N peacekeeping force will be forced to
intervene and renew its fight against Aidid.
Georgians capture rebel town
TBILISI, Georgia (AP) â€” Government
troops moved into a rebel stronghold for the
first time in their fight against insurgents
trying to topple Georgian leader Eduard
Shevardnadze, an official said yesterday.
Troops captured the town of Martvili, 30
miles northwest of Kutaisi, Georgia's sec
ond largest city. That opened a potential
second route to the town of Senaki, a major
military center in the power base of ousted
President Zviad Gamsakhurdia.
Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's first demo
cratically elected president, was over
thrown in January 1992 by former allies
who accused of him of acting like a dictator.
