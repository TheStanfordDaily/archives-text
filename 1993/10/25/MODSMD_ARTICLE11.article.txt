PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -
U.N. officials welcomed a peace propos
al by opponents of Haiti's exiled presi
dent, but said yesterday the army and
lawmakers must move faster to restore
democracy or face a broadened com
mercial embargo.
A U.N. spokesman said the proposal
by a group of lawmakers opposed to
exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aris
tide represented a shift toward accep
tance of the U.N. plan to free violence
plagued Haiti from military rule.
Still, U.N. officials were trying to
assess whether the plan unveiled Sat
urday night would ease the current cri
sis, or was a delaying tactic.
The United Nations reapplied a
weapons and petroleum embargo last
week to pressure the military to give up
power. One of the warships placed off
Haiti to enforce the sanctions cruised

in Port-au-Prince harbor yesterday,
then steamed to a point off suburban
Mariani near the headquarters of
Haiti's tiny navy.
Under the U.N. plan, army com
mander Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras is to
step down and Aristide is to return by
Saturday. But Cedras has resisted quit
ting, and the country has been plagued
by violence blamed mostly on oppo
nents of Aristide.
Overnight, six people were reported
shot in Petionville, a suburb of Port
au-Prince. Their conditions were not
known.
The new proposal attempts to win
some concessions from Aristide before
allowing his return from 25 months of
exile.
It asks for parliament to enact a gen
eral amnesty law, for Aristide to accept
political opponents into his Cabinet

and for the world body to lift the
weapons and petroleum embargo.
Aristide decreed an amnesty for
political crimes, but Cedras has argued
that this order could be revoked and an
amnesty law is needed. Aristide says
he's not opposed to including oppo
nents in his government, but only after
he returns.
U.N. envoy Dante Caputo unveiled
the proposal Saturday night, after
meeting with U.S. Ambassador William
Swing and Premier Robert Malval,
head of the transition government.
Malval is to ask Aristide about conces
sions in a meeting Wednesday in Wash
ington.
The U.S. Embassy welcomed the ini
tiative and issued a statement saying,
"We encourage all parties to give the
proposal the closest possible scrutiny at
the earliest possible time."
