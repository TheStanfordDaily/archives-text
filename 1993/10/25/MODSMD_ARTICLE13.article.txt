## Editorial An ethical dilemma 
### 
Stanford should not rent
land to Webbs if they are
unfair to Ranch workers

run Webb
kJßanch." Given the long
history of unfair labor practices,
substandard housing and lack of
representation for Webb Ranch
workers, these recent words from
University President Gerhard
Casper seem — on first glance —
callous at best, and immoral at
worst.
As shocking as Casper's state
ment may be, it's nothing new. In
1989, former University President
Donald Kennedy said, "The rela
tionship is, after all, between the
ranch and its employees and it
would do no good ... if a third
party (Stanford) substituted for
either of them."
And indeed, the lease between
the University and Webb Ranch
states that Stanford is neither the
landlord nor the employer of work
ers at the ranch.
Thus, Stanford requires the
ranch to comply with all applicable
laws, but it is up to governmental
agencies to ensure that the ranch
complies with such laws.
Such an arrangement appears
to be one in which Stanford reaps
all the rewards of being a land
lord — i.e., rent money — with a
minimum of responsibility for
what is done on its property. On
the surface, especially in consid
eration of Webb Ranch, it seems
to be a legal way to avoid moral
responsibility.
But this lease condition is a
standard one that Stanford
employs with all its tenants, from
Macy's and Neiman-Marcus at the
Shopping Center to Hewlett
Packard and IBM, which have
offices on Stanford land. And cer
tainly, such a condition is reason
able. After all, the University
should be in the business of educa

tion, not labor relations.
Nevertheless, it doesn't take a
genius to realize that Webb Ranch
is no Macy's.
The ranch workers' living con
ditions are abominable, their
wages minimal at best, and the
general attitude of the ranch
management toward the workers
is hardly one of good faith.
What does Stanford gain from
continuing to lease 238 acres to
the Webbs? According to the lease
agreement which expired in
1989, about $46,416 a year in
rent. University officials would
not release current figures to
The Daily, but it's obvious that
Stanford isn't getting rich off the
arrangement.
What Stanford has gotten is a
vexing ethical dilemma and a pub
lic-relations nightmare.
As one of the nation's top uni
versities, where the brightest
minds of today are supposed to be
training the leaders of tomorrow,
continuing to extend the privilege
of a lease to Webb Ranch is to dis
honor the position of the Stanford
community as a moral and intellec
tual role model.
Stanford and the Webb Ranch
workers are gaining nothing from
the current arrangement, and the
University should not renew its
lease with the Webbs when it
expires in 1995.
In the course of the next two
years, the University should begin
investigating alternative uses for
the land the ranch currently occu
pies. It could be leased to another
tenant for agricultural or non-agri
cultural activities, or it could be put
to academic use.
In addition, the University
should help the current ranch
workers find new jobs, either with
in the University or with other
employers.
It is not acceptable for Casper to
deny responsibility by pointing to
legal agreements and declaring,
"Stanford University cannot run
Webb Ranch."
The point is, Stanford Universi
ty should no longer allow Webb
Ranch to be run.
