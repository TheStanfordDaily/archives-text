## Never drink and derive 
### 
RECENTLY this summer, Andrew
Wiles, a professor at Princeton
University, had done what many
had considered impossible, or at least
very difficult. After withstanding 356
years of the vicious attacks by greatest
mathematicians of our time and of times
past, Fermat's Last Theorem finally fell
to the (ahem) wiles of Andrew Wiles.
If you haven't heard of Fermat's Last
Theorem, or aren't familiar with it, here
is a short history. One night, French
mathematician Pierre de Fermat, in what
was either a stroke of genius or insanity,
claimed that he had discovered a miracu
lous proof of a theorem but had no room
to write it down. And, of Course, in the
spirit of good-sportsmanship, friendly
competition and Murphy's Law, Fermat
didn't spoil everyone else's fun by reveal
ing this wonderful proof, but instead died.
Hence the name, Fermat's Last Theo
rem.
Mathematicians everywhere went
crazy, searching for this miraculous
proof, devoting their lives to solving a
claim of a possibly demented man. So,
obviously, when Andrew Wiles finally got
it, people went crazy. Riots ensued. Wiles
was forced to go on national television to
pacify the looting, rowdy university pro
fessors. But not everyone was quite as
ecstatic as they should have been. Many
wondered why anyone would spend so
much time on something so useless,
when they could be saving the Hawaiian

snakes, curing tropical diseases or taking
over hostile Third World nations.
Why would anyone spend so much
time on something so useless?
I am here to defend Andrew Wiles as
he is no doubt working on some other
astounding proof (maybe proving Rea
gan's Last Conjecture: "'This statement
is false.' is a true statement.").
Let's imagine if Wiles never did prove
this theorem. Mathematicians every
where would still be searching endlessly
for the answer, as mathematicians do.
They would spend all waking hours on
the problem, taking only short, concen
trated breaks to go to the bathroom and
carbo-load.
Soon the question would invade their
sleep, as they had terrible nightmares of
hairy, sharp-toothed differential opera
tors and the nemesis of all Fermat fol
lowers, the dreaded diophantine analysis.
As Fermat's theorem continued to go
unproven, thinkers everywhere would
drink themselves deeper and deeper into
their depression derived from feelings of
anxiety and mathematical inadequacy.
Slowly, one by one, they would misread
the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality in their
drunken stupor, then commit suicide,
leaving a huge mass of suicide notes and
unfinished proofs bequeathed to their
uncaring families. (No, this was not the
way the dinosaurs died.) That would be a
shame.
If we look at it this way, Andrew Wiles

did the world a great service. By solving
and publishing the proof, he single-hand
edly saved the lives of countless mathe
maticians world-wide. Instead, only the
handful of mathematicians that were
half a derivative behind Wiles would com
mit suicide, as they saw their lives' work
go down the drain. This is a much better
alternative.
On the positive side, the proof of Fer
mat's Last Theorem would lead the way
to many, many more heretofore distant
advances. The most notable of these
advances would be the secret to world
peace, the discovery of life on other plan
ets, and, on a lesser scale, the cure for
cancer.
Maybe this didn't demonstrate exactly
what I had in mind but it does leave us
with two morals this week. First, advice
from Dr. Wiles himself to all young aspir
ing mathematicians: "Friends don't let
friends derive drunk. Don't drink and
derive."
Second, from me, some of the most
brilliant and applicable discoveries ever
were made while in search of the silliest
things.

Thai is now tying to find out, if you ship
styrofoam, what do you ship it in ? He wel
comes any suggestions.
