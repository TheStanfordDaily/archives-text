## Love, acceptance and tolerance are true Christian ideals 
### 
THE SELF-RIGHTEOUS Oct. 21
letter from Angel Puerta is just
as insensitive to thinking stu
dents as he claims the commitment
ceremony was to Catholics. His hypo
critical assessment of the moral and
profane problems with the ceremony
cries out for the understanding that
Jesus proclaimed in every word of the
New Testament. Unfortunately, he
does not seem to believe in the true
message of Christianity — Love.
After opening with a general insult
to homosexuals, he promises to
"refrain from moral judgment" — only
to return to the fray with a claim
"There are moral and religious lines
that cannot be crossed." He claims to
understand what happened in the
church, but from his first paragraph he

proved he did not even read The
Daily's article clearly. It clearly stated
that the commitment ceremony was
not a "marriage" because that is a
clearly religious word and the Deans
Robert Gregg and Diana Akiyama did
not feel it was appropriate in this situ
ation. This, unfortunately, seemed to
slip by Puerta when he claimed that
the deans acted in blithe insensitivity
to Catholics.
His pitiful attempt to create an anal
ogy between Catholics and Native
Americans does not hold water, either.
He simply assumes that the deans
would not offend such a sacred group.
While Christians and numerous
other religions would not agree about
God and his worship, the staff of
Memorial Church is there to bring wor

ship and reverence to the entire Stan
ford community. This does not include
intolerance of any religious views, but
their task is instead to bring under
standing and acceptance to all mem
bers of the community.
I would hope that the deans would
consider seriously any request to have
a commitment ceremony. If it included
(just for controversy) animal sacrifice,
I would hope they'd think about it, and
make sure there were enough tarps
that blood didn't splash on the marble.
Get it, Puerta? The idea is accep
tance and tolerance. Your ultimate
ideal given by your ultimate sacrifice
for humanity: Jesus. Love thy neigh
bor, Love thine enemy, Love every
body.
I look forward to sharing the steps

of Memorial Church someday with
some significant other of mine as we
hold our ceremony and commit our
lives to one another, in the fine tradi
tion of Terry Rouman and Jason Allen.
However, I believe ours would be
acceptable in your eyes, currently
termed "holy matrimony." Yes, Angel,
I happen to be a happy heterosexual
who cannot stand by quietly when a
voice of insensitivity speaks out. I
value my ceremonies and public accep
tance, but I see that it is essential for
me to provide those around me with
the same respect I receive. I hope
someday you see the value of under
standing and — you guessed it — Love
