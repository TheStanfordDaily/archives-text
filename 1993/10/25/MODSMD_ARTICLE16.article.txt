# Not-guilty verdicts are no reason to celebrate
## 
### 
When I see black leaders celebrate
the not-guilty verdicts in the Reginald
Denny beating, I get sick to my stom
ach. I have witnessed black racism all
my life. I was born and raised in a town
that is about 90 percent black. The
poor whites who still lived in this com
munity were often beat up on the
streets and in the schools by blacks,
and I was one of the few blacks in this
community who openly spoke out
against this. Therefore it saddens me
when I see black people condoning
racist violence.
Damian Williams and Henry Wat
son had no right to beat up Reginald
Denny. Sure they may have been upset
about the injustice done to Rodney
King, but that had nothing to do with
Reginald Denny. The only crime
Denny was guilty of was being white,
which is no crime at all. Although

being white in America is a privilege in
that whites generally enjoy an econom
ic and cultural advantage over blacks,
it is not a crime. It is not Reginald
Denny's fault that he was born white.
Yet Denny was beat up and his blood
was not avenged.
Many black leaders think that this is
fine simply because blacks have been
victims of a racist criminal justice sys
tem for years. Under the same logic,
one would conclude that it is fine for
the average Jew to walk up to the aver
age Christian and hit him upside the
head with a brick simply because pro
fessing Christians have persecuted
Jews in the past. Therefore it is ridicu
lous to think that Williams and Watson
had a right to beat Reginald Denny.
Just because injustice was done to Rod
ney King, this doesn't excuse the injus
tice done to Reginald Denny. Two
wrongs don't make a right. Rodney
King may be black and Reginald Denny
may be white, but they both bled red
blood.
Perhaps some good can come out of

this mess. Some of the same whites who
are now claiming that the criminal jus
tice system is unfair to whites would
have sworn before that the system could
do no wrong. Perhaps being on the
receiving end of some discrimination will
make these whites understand what
blacks have been going through all these
years.
Hopefully people will start speaking
out against all manner of injustice, no
matter what race the perpetrator is.
