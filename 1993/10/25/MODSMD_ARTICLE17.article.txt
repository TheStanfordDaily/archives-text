# Puerta overlooks Mem Chu's multi-faith ideas
## 
### 
I strongly disagree with Angel Puer
ta's letter criticizing the Memorial
Church deans' decision to allow the
recent gay commitment ceremony. Puer
ta complained that such a ceremony was
insensitive to Catholics.
We must remember that Memorial
Church is not solely a Catholic church,

but an interdenominational church.
This certainly does not mean there
should be a lack of standards for Memo
rial Church events, but rather that the
standards are set down by a diverse col
lection of groups. Many religious groups,
most recently the largest Lutheran
synod in America, have stated that
homosexual unions have the blessing of
God.
I understand that Puerta was offend
ed because he, as a Catholic, believes
that homosexuality is a sin. However,
Puerta should understand that I, as a
Lutheran, would have been greatly
offended had the ceremony not been
allowed.
The deans' primary responsibility
is to improve people's personal rela
tionships with God. To have denied
the request for a commitment cere
mony would not have brought the
homosexual couple closer to God but
rather would have driven them fur
ther away.
