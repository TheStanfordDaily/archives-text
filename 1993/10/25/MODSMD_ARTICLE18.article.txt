## Arizona heat: Devils scorch Stanford 38-30 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Leave it to the devils to repeat
history.
Stanford and Arizona State last
met on the football field four years
ago. That was also the last time that
Stanford lost four games in a row.
All the Sun Devils needed was 15
minutes to make it seem like 1989

all over again.
Arizona State (3-4, 1-3 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) scored 18
points in the fourth quarter, erasing
a 24-20 Stanford lead and walking
away with a 38-30 victory at Stan
ford Stadium on Saturday.
"It's hard to believe, but that's
what happened," said Stanford head
coach Bill Walsh. "Our defense just
wasn't strong enough to hold off

Arizona State, and we made just
enough mistakes on offense not to
be able to take advantage of our
opportunities."
Instead, those opportunities
were given to the Sun Devils, and
one hurt much more than the rest.
After Arizona State scored on its
second consecutive drive of the third
quarter, Cardinal quarterback
Steve Stenstrom was intercepted by

Arizona State's Craig Newsome on
the first play of Stanford's next
series. Then, starting from the
Stanford 18-yard line, Arizona State
found the endzone after four plays
on a five-yard touchdown run by
Mario Bates, and followed that with
a two-point conversion to leave
Stanford trailing 38-24 with 7:56
left.
"I made a poor read on the inter
ception," said Stenstrom. "I
thought a big hole would be there. It
was a ball that I shouldn't have been
throwing."
But other than that particular
pass, Stenstrom again posted solid
numbers. On the day, the senior
quarterback completed 23 of 37
passes for 328 yards and three
touchdowns. The scoring passes
moved Stenstrom to third on Stan
ford's all-time list, trailing only Jim
Plunkett and John Elway. Yet he
was also sacked four times and
missed several open receivers, while
his two favorite targets — Justin
Armour and Brian Manning —
watched injured from the sidelines.
"This one leaves me wishing I
could be out there with a few more
minutes on the clock and have a few
plays back, because except for three
or four plays we had a good day,"
Stenstrom said.
Stenstrom tried to rally Stanford
(2-5, 0-4 in the Pac-10) from the 14-
point deficit with a touchdown drive
that ended on a 40-yard pass over
the middle to Armour's replace
ment, receiver Mark Harris (seven
catches for 160 yards). But kicker
Eric Abrams — after 23 successful
tries in a row — missed the point
after attempt, and the Cardinal sub
sequently incurred an offsides
penalty on Aaron Mills' kickofT. The
Sun Devils started with the ball at
their own 40-yard line and ran out

the last five minutes on the clock.
"It's nice to finally get a win in
this stadium," said Arizona State
head coach Bruce Snyder, who
coached at California from 1987-91
and previously had never defeated
Stanford.
The Sun Devils opened up the
scoring on their second possession
of the contest, consuming 83 yards
in 13 plays with a mixture of runs by
Bates and tailback George Mont
gomery. After holding Arizona to
only 240 yards in total offense a
week ago, the Cardinal defense
yielded 254 yards to Arizona State
in rushing alone. Bates (127 yards)
and Montgomery (100 yards) led the
way.
Stanford came right back with an
80-yard drive of its own, with the
majority of the plays on the ground.
The Cardinal tried to establish its
running game from the outset, and
for the first time this year had some
success. After Arizona State scored
a field goal and another touchdown,
bringing the count to 17-7 with 2:47
remaining in the first half, Stanford
fullback Ethan Allen answered with
an 82-yard touchdown scamper
down the left sidelines — the fifth
longest touchdown run in school
history. Allen had 90 yards rushing
for the game, and teammate EUery
Roberts had 59.
Despite the new balance in the
offense, turnovers and penalties
prevented the Cardinal from experi
encing its first league win. Sten
strom and new center T.J. Gaynor
continued to have problems on the
snap. Stenstrom began the third
quarter by fumbling an exchange
from Gaynor, which was recovered
by Sun Devil inside linebacker Dan
Lucas. Kicker Jon Baker converted


Curtis Chen — Daily
Senior fullback Ethan Allen takes a pounding from the Sun Devils' defense. However, on the day, Allen
compiled 90 yards on the ground, including an 82-yard touchdown.
