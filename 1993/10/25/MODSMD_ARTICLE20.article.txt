# Spikers fall to ASU, Arizona

### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
It was the kind of weekend the Stanford women's
volleyball team would like to completely erase from
their memory — if only it was that simple.
The second-ranked team (14-5, 7-5 in the Pacific
10 Conference) fell victim to an outright slaughter

Friday night at No. 18 Arizona State (13-4, 7-4 in
the Pac-10) and could not revive itself Sunday after
noon, succumbing to No. 22 Arizona (10-7, 6-5 in the
Pac-10) in Tucson.
"I can't find words to describe how humiliating it
felt," said coach Don Shaw. "I haven't felt that way
in a long, long time as an athlete or a coach."
For the defending national champions, a team
accustomed to winning, the losses delivered a harsh
dose of reality. In the history of Stanford women's
volleyball, the Cardinal had never lost a match to
either of the Arizona teams — until now. After the
two defeats, Stanford's all-time records stand at 25-
1 against the Sun Devils and 15-1 against the Wild
cats.
While Arizona State stepped on the court pre
pared for a tough battle against one of country's best
squads, the Cardinal took care of the Sun Devils'
task on its own, self-destructing virtually from the
start.
The Sun Devils jumped out to any early six-point
lead in game one, leaving the Cardinal to struggle in
their wake. Plagued by a characteristically sluggish
start, Stanford was unable to catch up and dropped
the game 15-7.
Showing signs of life in the first half of game two,
the Cardinal pulled ahead to a 12-6 lead. The Sun
Devil attack proved too much for Stanford to handle,
however, as the Cardinal watched its margin evapo
rate. Arizona State evened the score at 13-13 and
went on to a 15-13 victory.
Riddled by offensive errors on the part of its out
side hitters, the Cardinal tried to adjust its third
game lineup in hopes of generating a stronger
attack. Sophomores Marnie Triefenbach and Wendy
Hromadka swung from the left while senior Heidi
Eick tried from the right side, to no avail. The Sun
Devil defense proved capable of handling any combi
nation Stanford offered and took game three 15-7.
"Every once in a while you're going to have a
nightmare like that," Shaw said. "ASU just showed
up, served the ball in and basically ducked and got
out of the way — we ended up hitting balls all over
the gym."
Led by Christine Garner and Kristine Culbreath
on the offensive side, the Sun Devils hit for .147 and
held Stanford to a mere .083. Garner racked up a
match high 13 kills for a .250 hitting percentage
while Culbreath hit .333 with nine kills. Middle
blocker Nancy Christensen led an impressive Sun
Devil defense with 20 digs.
Both Hromadka and classmate Cary Wendell
ended with unusually low hitting percentages with -
.074 and .042. Hromadka managaed only five kills
with seven errors, while Wendell, traditionally the
Cardinal's kill leader, smashed down only seven and
ended with six attack errors. Triefenbach's 11 kills
spearheaded the weak Stanford attack.
"We need to do a better job offensively," Shaw
said. "Siding out, passing, hitting control — those
are the things which have killed us."
The Cardinal came out against Arizona with
some of the spark it lacked on Friday. It seemed as if
the nightmare had finally ended, as Stanford's out
side hitters led to way to a 15-8 game-one victory.
The bad dream began all over again in game two,
however, as the Wildcat defense came alive. Effec
tively shutting down the Cardinal outside attack,
hitters Charita Johnson and Barb Bell led the Wild
cats to a 9-15 second-game victory.
Outside hitter Michelle Bartsch-Malis served for
nine straight points to open game three and cleared
the way for a 15-6 victory in which the Cardinal
never posed a real threat.
Stanford stepped up its attack in game four and
pushed out to a 13-10 lead. The momentum swung
back in Arizona's favor, however, as middle hitter
Trina Smith pounded through the Stanford block to
lead the way to a 16-14 game-and-match win.
The Wildcats came out on top offensively with a
.211 hitting percentage to Stanford's .192. Triefen
bach swung for 16 kills to lead the Cardinal effort
followed by Wendell and Wicks with 11 each.
