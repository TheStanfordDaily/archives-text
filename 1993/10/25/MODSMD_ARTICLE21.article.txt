# A step in the right direction
## Harris fills Armour's shoes 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
For the Stanford football team
and its fans, it may be a difficult
task to search for bright spots in
the Cardinal's fourth-straight
defeat. Just ask receiver Mark
Harris.
"It's hard to feel too great
about the way you played when
your team comes up with the
loss," said Harris immediately fol
lowing the contest.
Nevertheless, coaches and fans
can't be upset with Harris' perfor
mance. The junior transfer from
Ricks College, a junior college in
Utah, caught seven passes for a
game-high 160 yards, including a
nifty 40-yard grab-and-scamper
for a touchdown.
"Mark played well," said head
coach Bill Walsh. "He caught the
ball well and ran effectively after
the catch. We felt that Mark would
be a good solid player at Stanford,
and he demonstrated that. We're
very pleased with him."
At Ricks, Harris caught 52
passes for 1,067 yards and 12
touchdowns in 1992, earning him
a Western States Football League

MVP and first-team Junior Col
lege Ail-American honors. Fur
thermore, his team went 11-0 and
finished with a No. 2 national
ranking. For the two years prior to
that season, Harris had been on a
two-year Mormon mission in
Barcelona, and in 1989 he had
played as a freshman an Southern
Utah State.
Harris' opportunity at Stan
ford came when starting flanker
Justin Armour suffered a separat
ed shoulder in last week's loss to
Arizona. In the first six games of
the season, Harris had caught
seven passes for 73 yards. Howev
er, with Armour averaging seven
catches and 96.8 yards a game,
coaches and players must have
been a bit chary about the replace
ment.
Not so, according to senior
tight end Tony Cline.
"He's fine," Cline said about
Harris' trial-by-fire. "There was
no question about Mark Harris to
that degree. I don't think the
coaching staff [questioned Harris'
ability] either. He's a starting
receiver at almost any university,
it's just that he's behind Justin
Armour."

Harris agreed that finding play
ing time behind probable All-
Pacific 10 Conference selection
Armour and other talented offen
sive players is more difficult than
catching any pass.
"We've got a lot of weapons on
this team," Harris said. "It's real
ly hard to replace Justin. He's a
great player and he adds a lot to
the team."
Harris, originally from Brig
ham City, Utah, began practicing
with the team last spring and was
listed as the starting flanker for a
time when Armour was being
tried at tight end during the
spring. The added experience
helped him adjust from playing
against junior college-caliber play
ers to Division I competition.
"The guys are just so much big
ger," Harris said with a tinge of
exasperation in his voice. "You get
these defensive backs â€” I don't
think I faced a defensive back
[while at Ricks] that's 6-foot-2-
inches and 220 like some of these
guys that you see running around
on their team. There's definitely a
difference in the size and speed of
