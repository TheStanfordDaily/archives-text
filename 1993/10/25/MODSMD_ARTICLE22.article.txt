Led by senior Sarah Rafanelli's three goals over the
weekend, No. 4 Stanford pushed its record to 14-2-1
with identical 4-0 wins over No. 2 California (9-2-4) on
Saturday and Butler (4-9-3) on Sunday.
In Saturday's game, the Cardinal got on the score
board early when Rafanelli found the back of the net on
a pass from Erin Martin 17 minutes into the game. The
score remained 1-0 until 20 minutes into the second
half when fullback Jessica Fischer scored her seventh
goal of the year.
Stanford then slammed the door on Cal, scoring
twice in the final 11 minutes. Laura Wilkes scored her
first goal of the year off a pass from Carmel Murphy,
and Rafanelli finished off the Bears with an unassisted
goal.
"We exposed her 1 Rafanelli 1 to one-on-one situa
tions, and she did a great job getting around that
defender," said coach lan Sawyers.
Cal's loss was only its second of the season, but both
setbacks came within four days of each other. Unde
feated until last Wednesday's overtime loss to San
Francisco, Cal must regroup if it wants a NCAA Tour
nament berth.
"This weekend was awesome," said midfielder
Carmel Murphy. "We've always had trouble with Cal.
They're always a tough team for us, but I think this
year we really crushed them."
Mixing up the regular game plan of ball possession
with a more aggressive, penetrating style, the Stanford
offense got back on track after scoring only four goals in
its last four games.
The Cardinal defense continued its dominating play,
limiting the Bears to four shots on goal. C?oalkeepers
lieslie Garrard and Jennifer Poehler combined for the
shutout, keeping Cal scoreless for only the third time

this season.
"We did a great job, especially the outside backs, of
just keeping them away," Fischer said. "Nobody gut a
chance up front, they never got a turn on us, and they
were never down in our area."
Stanford showed its renewed focus on winning Sun
day by coming out and disposing of the Butler Bulldogs
with aggressive first-half play. Capitalizing on Butler's
defensive mistakes, the Cardinal outshot the Bulldogs
50 to five.
Rafanelli tallied Stanford's first goal 10 minutes into
the first half on an amazing display of footwork and ball
control. Receiving the ball in the right corner, instead of
centering the ball on with a high lob, the senior All-
American got past her defender, cut back in front of the
goal and put the ball in with a left-footed blast.
Rafanelli now has 15 goals and eight assists for the
year, and her 142 career points places her second on the
all-time scoring list, 15 points behind four-time Ail-
American Julie Foudy.
The Cardinal continued to pressure the Bulldog goal
with precision passing and powerful shots. Despite
numerous scoring opportunities, including a remark
able five-shot sequence turned away by Butler goal
keeper Nancy Keys, Stanford didn't score again until
late in the first half.
On Butler's only real scoring threat of the game, an
entry pass in front of the Stanford goal was headed
toward the right corner, past a diving Garrard. Howev
er, freshman midfielder Wendy Latimer was guarding
the right post and deflected the shot.
Freshman Alyze Ivowen then pounced on the loose
ball and sprinted toward the Bulldog goal. Lowen
popped up a pass to Murphy, who put the ball past the
charging goalie for her seventh goal of the year.
"We turned a (possible) 1-1 game into 2-0 with that
