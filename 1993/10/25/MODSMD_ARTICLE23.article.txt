# Polo drowns in deGuerre
## Cardinal wary of slump after a 9-5 loss 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
Two weeks ago, the Stanford
water polo team dominated the
Northern California Tourna
ment, turning back six opponents
on their way to the championship.
The same team is now strug
gling to regain that confidence
and level of play after falling to
No. 3 California 9-5 at deGuerre
Pool Saturday. The loss was the
second in a row for theNo. 1 Car
dinal (15-3, 2-1 in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation), also
defeated last Sunday by Pacific.
Saturday's match began with
promise, but the Golden Bears
(13-6, 3-2 in the MPSF) grabbed
control of the game's tempo early

and never let the Cardinal get
back into the game, dominating
all phases of play.
Stanford suffered at the defen
sive end of the pool, committing
nine personal fouls (two penalty
shots and seven 20-second ejec
tions). Although Cardinal goalie
Larry Bercutt made an outstand
ing save on a penalty shot to pre
serve a scoreless tie early, the
Bears bombarded his net, scoring
seven times in the first half.
"Their counter beat us,"
Bercutt said. "The shots they
took were wide open. You can't
give them that kind of shot if you
want to win. We're just as fast as
they are — that's not something
we can afford to do.
"Now we have to group togeth

er. We just haven't been playing
well as a team. We need to get
back to our style of play — we're a
fast, outside-shooting team."
Stanford's Antonio Busquets
opened the game's scoring with a
penalty-shot goal with 5:30 re
maining in the first quarter, but
Cal roared back. The Golden
Bears beat the Stanford defense
four times within a minute-and-a
half, capped by Tony Barnes'
penalty shot goal, for a 4-1 lead.
Stanford sophomore Josh
Leachman ended the quarter with
a lob shot just out of goalie Sean
Nolan's reach as time expired to
close the deficit to 4-2. That was
the closest Stanford would come
to the California lead.
In the second quarter, Cal con

tinued to jump all over the Cardi
nal, as Barnes sprinted out ahead
of the defense to net a break-away
goal. Two minutes later, Cal
extended their lead to 7-2 on
Barnes' third score of the game.
Coach Dante Dettamanti
pointed to a lack of team-play as
one of Stanford's main problems.
"We got behind and tried to
come back. But instead of playing
as a team, guys were trying to do
individual things — trying to
force the action. Instead of shoot
ing off a pass from a teammate,
we were trying to win with our
arms rather than take an assist."
The big half-time lead gave
California the opportunity to take
their time on offense, often using
their entire shot-clock before
attempting a shot. At Stanford's
end, the offense sputtered and
was held scoreless during the
third quarter, while Cal's Troy
Barnhart scored his second and
third goals of the game to give the
Golden Bears a 9-3 edge.
Two Cardinal goals in the final
three minutes of the game round
ed out the scoring at 9-5.
The lopsided loss left Detta
manti searching for the differ
ences between the team which
had defeated Cal twice this season
and the team which has been out
played the last two weeks.
"What it boiled down to was
too many uncontested shots," he
said. "The goalie just can't block
those. The defense completely
broke and failed to cover up. I
don't know where the break
downs are occuring, but we'll ana
lyze the film to find out."
