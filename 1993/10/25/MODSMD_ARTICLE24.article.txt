# Hockey dominates California Invitational
## 
### Christian Leone Staff writer 
This weekend, Stanford's field hockey
team raised its record to 7-8 and in the pro
cess showed the Bay Area how good they
really are. In two games played at Berkeley,
the Cardinal manhandled a tough (now 9-4)
Southwest Missouri Squad 2-0 and then
embarrassed Santa Barbara 7-0.
The overriding motif of the weekend was
the Cardinal's defense. Stellar play from
senior defenders Markley Bavinger, Danielle
Bey not-, .Natalie McCullough, Connie Fung
and freshman Karla Peterson made it almost
easy for Loretta Hidalgo to record her fourth
and fifth shutouts of the season.
"They got some pretty good shots off,"

said Hidalgo, "but I felt really good."
On offense, defender Beynet displayed her
versatility and opened the scoring for the
Cardinal. After bringing the ball upfield, she
dumped it off to Tina Syer, who crisply
passed it back for Beynet's first goal of the
season.
"It was like one for the defense, it was
great," said Beynet. Before this weekend, the
Cardinal had lost three straight games after
a more successful roadtrip. "After a terrible
game against Duke, we are back," Beynet
added.
The second score of the day was by far the
most awe-inspiring goal of the weekend.
Sara Hallock drove the ball up the left side of
the field where she gave it up to freshman
Kory Taylor, who laced a pass to senior Gina

Bianchini. Coming in on the left side, she
pulled the goalie out and went right around
her for an open shot and her second goal of
the season.
On Sunday, the Cardinal throttled Santa
Barbara in a 7-0 game that really was as close
as the score would indicate.
Hallock's four goals (22 this season) and
two assists, Jen Gleuck's first hat trick of the
season and a strong performance from Natal
ie McCullough in a rare start at forward pow
ered Stanford to its seventh win of the sea
son.
"[Santa Barbara] was not a bad team,"
said Bianchini. "It" would HliVe been really
easy to play to their level but we didn't. We
played our game. It felt good to get some wins
under our belt. It was just fun hockey."
