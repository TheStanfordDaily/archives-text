# Stanford smooches Fresno St. in 1-1 tie
## 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
If the old saying that a tie in a
sporting event is like kissing your
sister is true, then the Stanford
men's soccer squad must have the
loveliest and most desirable sister
in town.
In the game of the year for the
Cardinal (5-8-2, 3-2-1 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion), Stanford tied Fresno State
1-1 after shutting out one of the
league's top two teams for 87
minutes of the game.
The metamorphosis of the
Cardinal squad has taken on its
latest form, that of a team dedi
cated to erasing memories of a
season plagued with defeats and
inconsistency. The team emerged
in Fresno as a squad capable of
playing with the powerhouses.
Fresno State (12-3-2, 3-1-2 in
the MPSF) plays invincible soccer
at home, having not lost on their
home turf all year. But the Cardi
nal wrote their own script for the
production that took place yester
day â€” they played with the Bull
dogs from the opening kick and,
at times, had complete control of
the game.
The first half was played to a
scoreless tie, an obvious indica
tion of the defensive showcase
that was displayed by both

squads. Both Fresno State and
Stanford finished the game (and
its two 15-minute overtimes)
with 11 shots on goal, although
the Bulldogs weren't able to con
vert the attempts into a goal until
late in regulation.
The Cardinal, however, put
one in the net less than two min
utes into the second half. Senior
forward Rick Goad received the
short feed into the middle of the
penalty box from forward Car
men D'Onofrio, and Stanford
could smell the fumes of an upset.
Forty-two minutes of the sec
ond half transpired before the
Bulldogs could ruffle the net.
Fresno State substitute Donovan
Martinez got the long pass from
midfielder Mario Sanchez, gain
ing control of the box and knot
ting the score at 1-1.
The two overtimes provided a
respite for the scoreboard, but the
physical play that was present
throughout the contest only esca
lated after regulation. Stanford
was cited with six yellow cards in
the game, including three in the
30 minutes of overtime. Overall,
he Bulldogs were whistled for 32
fouls, while Stanford was called
for 37 infractions.
The Cardinal, who will still
have to rely on outside forces to
make the league playoffs, host
top-ranked California on Friday.
