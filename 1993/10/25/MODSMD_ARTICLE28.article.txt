## 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
Getting off on the wrong foot
can really hurt a team in the
long run. The Stanford women's
golf squad discovered the truth
behind this axiom at the Stan
ford Women's Intercollegiate
Tournament this past weekend
at the Stanford Golf Course.
After a poor showing in Fri
day's first round left them in
13th place, the Cardinal women
used an excellent second round
to climb into fifth among the 19-
team field on Saturday. Then,
after a competitive final round
on Sunday, Stanford finished
the tournament in sixth place,
44 strokes behind the Spartans
of San Jose State.
Overall, the second-ranked
Spartans captured the presti
gious tournament by shooting a
course-record 863, while Ari
zona State, the No. 1 team in
the nation, placed second, nine
strokes behind.
Stanford head coach Tim
Baldwin was satisfied with his
squad's performance.
"It was tough playing out
there," said Baldwin. "It's very
competitive and there was a lot
of pressure. We have a young
team and I think we did well.

Sixth place in this field isn't
shabby."
Furthermore, Baldwin was
pleased to see the women
rebound from their shaky start.
"What really hurt us was shoot
ing 312 on the first day,"he con
tinued. "It really threw us off
balance. But we made a great
comeback on the second day to
move into fifth."
Golfer Vicky Strada agreed.
"We should've done a little bet
ter on the first day," she said.
"The last two days were in the
area we should be."
San Jose State's Vibeke
Stensrud led all individuals with
a three-day total of 212. Team
mate Janice Moodie and Ari
zona State's Wendy Ward tied
for second with a 214.
Freshman Mhairi McKay led
the Cardinal squad with 221
shots, finishing tied for eighth
overall. Coach Baldwin was
impressed with her outing.
"Down the road I think she'll
really do great things for Stan
ford golf," he said.
Other Stanford competitors
included Melinda Daniels, who
tied for 13th with a 223, Vicky
Strada, who finished 34th with
a 229 and Jamille Jose and
Andrea Baxter, who both ended
with 234 strokes, tied for 51st.
