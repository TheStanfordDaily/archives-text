# Grad student opens discount bookstore

### Karin Geldfeld 
Like most students, John Celestian is frus
trated with the staggering cost of life at Stan
ford, from tuition hikes to petty University sur
charges. But, stepping out of the angry masses,
Celestian decided to do something about it.
The second-year mechanical engineering
graduate student opened Alternative Text
books this fall, a new store which offers busi
ness and engineering graduate students a
cheaper alternative to the Stanford Bookstore.
"I've always been entrepreneurial-minded. .
. . I always think, instead of waiting in a line (at
the Bookstore), I can do this better," Celestian
said. "I'm always on the lookout for efficiency."
His store, located in the Stanford Barn, pro
vides graduate engineering and business books
at 10 percent to 25 percent less than the Stan
ford Bookstore, as well as used books for a 30
percent to 35 percent discount, he said.
For example, a mechanical engineering text

book, "Dynamics: Theory and Applications,"
costs $48 at Alternative Textbooks, compared
to the Stanford Bookstore's $70.50. Similarly,
the business text, "Beyond Entrepreneurship,"
is $15.96 at Celestian's store and $19.95 at the
Stanford Bookstore.
Celestian decided to start up the competi
tion after learning that there was only one
bookstore to serve all of Stanford. Although he
never had any formal business training, he uti
lized his natural entrepreneurial tendencies
while growing up — photographing weddings
and various ceremonies in high school and later
selling used books out of his house.
Last January he put up flyers and started
selling books at home. Discovering support
among students for an alternative to the Book
store, he got right to work and started Alterna
tive Textbooks using his own funds.
And while the store is less than a month old,
word has been spreading rapidly about its low
prices. Graduate student Robin Stevens said

the new bookstore is "a good idea. The (Stan
ford) Bookstore is usually more expensive and
needs some competition."
Celestian has also been providing informa
tion and communicating with customers
through the electronic mail system. People can
find out through e-mail what's in stock and
send him a list of the textbooks they need. Ce
lestian hopes to eventually allow e-mail users
to order all their books on e-mail and simply
pick up their orders.
He is already planning the future of Alterna
tive Textbooks. He hopes to either begin selling
used books for undergraduate and graduate
courses, or to offer all engineering and business
school books at a discount.
And even though business at Alternative
Textbooks is booming, Celestian said relations
with the Stanford Bookstore remain friendly.
"One day the manager of the Bookstore came
by to 'check out the competition,' and we chat
ted a little," he said.
