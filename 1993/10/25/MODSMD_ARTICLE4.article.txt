## New club explores techniques to control lucid dreaming 
### Beth Berselli 
Senior Jake Becker can fly. Maybe not
in real life, but he can fly in his dreams —
or rather his lucid dreams.
Becker is founder of Lucid Dreamers
Unlimited: Exploring the Real Holodeck
Experience, a new student group devoted
to lucid dreaming, a phenomenon in
which slumbering individuals are con
scious that they're dreaming.
" 'Lucid' refers to the clarity of con
sciousness that dreamers experience dur
ing their dreams," Becker said. Lucid
dreams allow individuals to do things in
their dreams that are "impossible in real
life" by essentially letting them control
their dreams.
And though the idea of lucid dreaming
may intimidate the inexperienced dream
er, Becker encourages anyone interested
to join the club.
"If you want to explore a new mental
frontier, you can take acid or lucid

dream," said junior Ben Righy, one club
member.
Sophomore Am it Aggarwal agreed,
saying, "To think that you can control
your dreams is appealing."
The new group is intended "to provide
support, motivation and a center for dis
cussion for those interested in the con
cept and practice of lucid dreaming," ac
cording to its constitution.
At Monday evening meetings, mem
bers discuss techniques to improve their
lucid dreams and even host an occasional
guest speaker.
Currently there are about eight mem
bers in the club — several of whom are
still trying to achieve their first lucid
dream.
Members practice techniques, such as
"reality testing," and use a device called
the Dream Link, to gain more control
over their dreams.
"Reality testing" is a reflection tech
nique that involves determining whether

someone is dreaming or awake. Aspiring
lucid dreamers ask themselves regularly
throughout the day, "Am 1 dreaming?"
Their hope is that this type of question
ing will carry over into dreams and, if an
swered positively, initiate lucidity.
The Dream Link is a small mask worn
at night that flashes lights in the dream
er's eyes, reminding him or her to become
lucid.
Dr. Stephen Laßerge, a Stanford Psy
chology research associate who founded
the Lucidity Institutein Palo Alto and de
veloped the Dream Link, said the device
"acts as a cue that helps you remember
something, mainly that you're dream
ing." Laßerge said that his institute will
donate one such device to the fledgling
club.
An Electrical Engineering major,
Becker first heard about lucid dreaming
in high school. During his freshman year

ploring the Real Holodeck Experience, wears a Dream Link mask. The device, worn at
night, flashes lights in a dreamer's eyes to spur him into awareness that he is dreaming
so that he may control his dream. Dream Link was developed by Dr. Stephen Laßerge, a
Psychology research associate at Stanford.
at Stanford, he developed this
interest by participating in

Becker said that "sex and fly
ing are probably the two biggest
things that people dream about. I
met this one girl who was a very
experienced lucid dreamer, and
she warned me about the dream
sex because it can get so good that

it makes regular sex pale in com
parison."
In fact, the disappointing
reality of her actual sex life
drove her to temporarily aban
don "dream sex" to avoid hurt
ing her boyfriend's feelings,
Becker said.
Becker decided to form the
club because, he said, "I know
that lucid dreaming is something
that I want to get better at, and
the club provides a way for me to
do it."
He said he named part of his
club after "The Holodeck Expe

rience," which is taken from
"Star Trek: The Next Genera
tion."
"It can be used as a metaphor
for lucid dreaming," he said.
"Characters go into the Holodeck
and watch holograms. In the
Holodeck things are so real that
you're not sure whether they're
real or not. Lucid dreaming is the
same way."
Through lucid dreaming,
Laßerge said, "You can dream
the impossible dream. You can do
things that you can't do in the
ordinary world."

Senior Jake Becker, founder of the new student club Lucid Dreamers Unlimited: Ex
ploring the Real Holodeck Experience, wears a Dream Link mask. The device, worn at
night, flashes lights in a dreamer's eyes to spur him into awareness that he is dreaming
so that he may control his dream. Dream Link was developed by Dr. Stephen Laßerge, a
Psychology research associate at Stanford.
at Stanford, he developed this
interest by participating in
experiments conducted by
Laßerge.
Becker said that "sex and fly
ing are probably the two biggest
things that people dream about. I
met this one girl who was a very
experienced lucid dreamer, and
she warned me about the dream
sex because it can get so good that

it makes regular sex pale in com
parison."
In fact, the disappointing
reality of her actual sex life
drove her to temporarily aban
don "dream sex" to avoid hurt
ing her boyfriend's feelings,
Becker said.
Becker decided to form the
club because, he said, "I know
that lucid dreaming is something
that I want to get better at, and
the club provides a way for me to
do it."
He said he named part of his
club after "The Holodeck Expe

rience," which is taken from
"Star Trek: The Next Genera
tion."
"It can be used as a metaphor
for lucid dreaming," he said.
"Characters go into the Holodeck
and watch holograms. In the
Holodeck things are so real that
you're not sure whether they're
real or not. Lucid dreaming is the
same way."
Through lucid dreaming,
Laßerge said, "You can dream
the impossible dream. You can do
things that you can't do in the
ordinary world."
