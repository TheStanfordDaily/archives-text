## New club explores techniques to control lucid dreaming

Senior Jake Becker can fly. Maybe not
in real life, but he can fly in his dreams —
or rather his lucid dreams.
Becker is founder of Lucid Dreamers
Unlimited: Exploring the Real Holodeck
Experience, a new student group devoted
to lucid dreaming, a phenomenon in
which slumbering individuals are con
scious that they're dreaming.
" 'Lucid' refers to the clarity of con
sciousness that dreamers experience dur
ing their dreams," Becker said. Lucid
dreams allow individuals to do things in
their dreams that are "impossible in real
life" by essentially letting them control
their dreams.
And though the idea of lucid dreaming
may intimidate the inexperienced dream
er, Becker encourages anyone interested
to join the club.
"If you want to explore a new mental
frontier, you can take acid or lucid

dream," said junior Ben Righy, one club
member.
Sophomore Am it Aggarwal agreed,
saying, "To think that you can control
your dreams is appealing."
The new group is intended "to provide
support, motivation and a center for dis
cussion for those interested in the con
cept and practice of lucid dreaming," ac
cording to its constitution.
At Monday evening meetings, mem
bers discuss techniques to improve their
lucid dreams and even host an occasional
guest speaker.
Currently there are about eight mem
bers in the club — several of whom are
still trying to achieve their first lucid
dream.
Members practice techniques, such as
"reality testing," and use a device called
the Dream Link, to gain more control
over their dreams.
"Reality testing" is a reflection tech
nique that involves determining whether

someone is dreaming or awake. Aspiring
lucid dreamers ask themselves regularly
throughout the day, "Am 1 dreaming?"
Their hope is that this type of question
ing will carry over into dreams and, if an
swered positively, initiate lucidity.
The Dream Link is a small mask worn
at night that flashes lights in the dream
er's eyes, reminding him or her to become
lucid.
Dr. Stephen Laßerge, a Stanford Psy
chology research associate who founded
the Lucidity Institutein Palo Alto and de
veloped the Dream Link, said the device
"acts as a cue that helps you remember
something, mainly that you're dream
ing." Laßerge said that his institute will
donate one such device to the fledgling
club.
An Electrical Engineering major,
Becker first heard about lucid dreaming
in high school. During his freshman year
