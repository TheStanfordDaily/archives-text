# University seeks more U.S.-born minority faculty
## Bonuses given to schools that further affirmative action goals 
### Sandy Lee Staff writer 
As part of a revised affirmative
action policy, the University has
begun offering financial incen
tives for recruiting targeted mi
nority faculty born in the United
States.
According to Asst. Provost for
Faculty Affairs Kathryn Gillam,
the change, which took effect
Sept. 1, shifts the focus of affir
mative action from targeting mi
nority faculty of any national ori
gin to aiming, at least implicitly,
at the U.S.-born, in particular
African-American, American In
dian, Chicano/Mexican-Ameri
can and Puerto Rican.
Under the new policy, deans
hiring targeted minority mem
bers will receive half their
school's median salary to add to
their budget. In the School of Hu
manities and Sciences that would
mean about $35,000 for every

targeted minority member hired.
The money will come from the
Faculty Incentive Fund, former
ly known as the Affirmative Ac
tion Fund, which has offered fi
nancial incentives for all minori
ty faculty hiring since 1971,
Gillam said.
The revised policy holds deans
accountable for progress in mi
nority faculty hiring, said
Provost Condoleezza Rice. Each
year the gains and losses in affir
mative action hiring will be re
viewed, and each individual
school will be rewarded for its net
gain.
"The primary reason [for the
change] is the desire to address
the fact that historically under
represented minorities [continue
to be underrepresented on col
lege faculties], and this is a pecu
liarly American phenomenon,"
Gillam said.
