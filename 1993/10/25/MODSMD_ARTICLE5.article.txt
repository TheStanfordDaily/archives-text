# University seeks more U.S.-born minority faculty
## Bonuses given to schools that further affirmative action goals 
### Sandy Lee Staff writer 
As part of a revised affirmative
action policy, the University has
begun offering financial incen
tives for recruiting targeted mi
nority faculty born in the United
States.
According to Asst. Provost for
Faculty Affairs Kathryn Gillam,
the change, which took effect
Sept. 1, shifts the focus of affir
mative action from targeting mi
nority faculty of any national ori
gin to aiming, at least implicitly,
at the U.S.-born, in particular
African-American, American In
dian, Chicano/Mexican-Ameri
can and Puerto Rican.
Under the new policy, deans
hiring targeted minority mem
bers will receive half their
school's median salary to add to
their budget. In the School of Hu
manities and Sciences that would
mean about $35,000 for every

targeted minority member hired.
The money will come from the
Faculty Incentive Fund, former
ly known as the Affirmative Ac
tion Fund, which has offered fi
nancial incentives for all minori
ty faculty hiring since 1971,
Gillam said.
The revised policy holds deans
accountable for progress in mi
nority faculty hiring, said
Provost Condoleezza Rice. Each
year the gains and losses in affir
mative action hiring will be re
viewed, and each individual
school will be rewarded for its net
gain.
"The primary reason [for the
change] is the desire to address
the fact that historically under
represented minorities [continue
to be underrepresented on col
lege faculties], and this is a pecu
liarly American phenomenon,"
Gillam said.
In fact, the changes "grew out
of faculty concern," during the
1989-90 and 1990-91 academic
years when James Rosse was
provost, she said. The 1989 Uni
versity Committee on Minority
Issues report stated that slightly
more than half of minority facul
ty were foreign-born, and stu
dent concerns included getting
more U.S.-born minority faculty
to serve as role models.
Rice took exception to this
motivation for changing the pol
icy. "One thing I don't find con
vincing is that foreign faculty
can't relate to an American-born
minority," she said.
Rice also emphasized that the
policy will not sacrifice the qual
ity of faculty recruited. "No pol
icy at Stanford would devalue
the importance of having the
best faculty," she said.
The revised policy is drawn
out in an April 1993 memoran
dum from former Acting Provost
Gerald Lieberman to the seven
deans which explains the incen
tives for hiring targeted faculty
members. The memorandum
does not state that the profes
sors must be U.S.-born,
although Gillam said "the intent
is to emphasize American-born
individuals."
Rice, however, said that there
has been too great an emphasis
on the issue of national origin,
pointing out that there is no
statement in the memorandum
that makes foreign-born faculty
ineligible to earn the funds for
the schools.
Rice, who as provost will be
fine-tuning this policy and
spelling out the "exceptions,"
said the intent of the policy — in
accordance with the intent of
affirmative action — is to "issue
incentives to hire historically
underrepresented minorities in
the American context."
"The authors of the policy
were trying to be more straight
forward about counting affirma
tive action gains," she said. "It is
more forward to count an

African professor from America
rather than an African professor
from Africa."
Although Rice believes "the
intent and spirit of the policy is
quite right," she plans to review
it with the University Cabinet
soon to clarify that the policy's
intent is not nativist.
"Any policy that causes con
fusion as to its intent needs to be
reviewed," she said.
The policy has already caught
the attention of several civil
rights groups across the coun
try.
"Although it's being promot
ed in the name of helping
minorities, it's nativism," said
Rebecca Chaio, a staff attorney
at the National Immigration
Law Center in Los Angeles.
"In a way it's closing off
opportunities," Chaio said.
Although Rice and Gillam
acknowledged that there has
been some misunderstanding
about the policy, they said it
hasn't been very controversial
among the Stanford community.
In fact, Linguistics Prof. John
Rickford said the policy seems to
merely put in writing what was
already an informal policy.
He said the policy to hire
more American minority faculty
and faculty of color is a good pol
icy that also matches affirmative
action guidelines for students.
"Students who qualify for
special recruitment efforts are
American, and faculty recruit
ment should match that," he
said.
However, Rickford expressed
concern over the decision's
apparent premise, which
implies that if a person is Amer
ican, he or she can better relate
to "students from a broad spec
trum."
Rickford said he doesn't
believe the issues raised by the
policy will be divisive at Stan
ford. But it "would be a pity if
[foreign-born faculty] . . . who
could make a visible impact
would be bypassed [in hiring!,
but I wouldn't think that's the
intent of the policy."

ican, he or she can better relate
to "students from a broad spec
trum."
Rickford said he doesn't
believe the issues raised by the
policy will be divisive at Stan
ford. But it "would be a pity if
[foreign-born faculty] . . . who
could make a visible impact
would be bypassed [in hiring!,
but I wouldn't think that's the
intent of the policy."

As part of a revised affirmative
action policy, the University has
begun offering financial incen
tives for recruiting targeted mi
nority faculty born in the United
States.
According to Asst. Provost for
Faculty Affairs Kathryn Gillam,
the change, which took effect
Sept. 1, shifts the focus of affir
mative action from targeting mi
nority faculty of any national ori
gin to aiming, at least implicitly,
at the U.S.-born, in particular
African-American, American In
dian, Chicano/Mexican-Ameri
can and Puerto Rican.
Under the new policy, deans
hiring targeted minority mem
bers will receive half their
school's median salary to add to
their budget. In the School of Hu
manities and Sciences that would
mean about $35,000 for every

targeted minority member hired.
The money will come from the
Faculty Incentive Fund, former
ly known as the Affirmative Ac
tion Fund, which has offered fi
nancial incentives for all minori
ty faculty hiring since 1971,
Gillam said.
The revised policy holds deans
accountable for progress in mi
nority faculty hiring, said
Provost Condoleezza Rice. Each
year the gains and losses in affir
mative action hiring will be re
viewed, and each individual
school will be rewarded for its net
gain.
"The primary reason [for the
change] is the desire to address
the fact that historically under
represented minorities [continue
to be underrepresented on col
lege faculties], and this is a pecu
liarly American phenomenon,"
Gillam said.
In fact, the changes "grew out
of faculty concern," during the
1989-90 and 1990-91 academic
years when James Rosse was
provost, she said. The 1989 Uni
versity Committee on Minority
Issues report stated that slightly
more than half of minority facul
ty were foreign-born, and stu
dent concerns included getting
more U.S.-born minority faculty
to serve as role models.
Rice took exception to this
motivation for changing the pol
icy. "One thing I don't find con
vincing is that foreign faculty
can't relate to an American-born
minority," she said.
Rice also emphasized that the
policy will not sacrifice the qual
ity of faculty recruited. "No pol
icy at Stanford would devalue
the importance of having the
best faculty," she said.
The revised policy is drawn
out in an April 1993 memoran
dum from former Acting Provost
Gerald Lieberman to the seven
deans which explains the incen
tives for hiring targeted faculty
members. The memorandum
does not state that the profes
sors must be U.S.-born,
although Gillam said "the intent
is to emphasize American-born
individuals."
Rice, however, said that there
has been too great an emphasis
on the issue of national origin,
pointing out that there is no
statement in the memorandum
that makes foreign-born faculty
ineligible to earn the funds for
the schools.
Rice, who as provost will be
fine-tuning this policy and
spelling out the "exceptions,"
said the intent of the policy — in
accordance with the intent of
affirmative action — is to "issue
incentives to hire historically
underrepresented minorities in
the American context."
"The authors of the policy
were trying to be more straight
forward about counting affirma
tive action gains," she said. "It is
more forward to count an

African professor from America
rather than an African professor
from Africa."
Although Rice believes "the
intent and spirit of the policy is
quite right," she plans to review
it with the University Cabinet
soon to clarify that the policy's
intent is not nativist.
"Any policy that causes con
fusion as to its intent needs to be
reviewed," she said.
The policy has already caught
the attention of several civil
rights groups across the coun
try.
"Although it's being promot
ed in the name of helping
minorities, it's nativism," said
Rebecca Chaio, a staff attorney
at the National Immigration
Law Center in Los Angeles.
"In a way it's closing off
opportunities," Chaio said.
Although Rice and Gillam
acknowledged that there has
been some misunderstanding
about the policy, they said it
hasn't been very controversial
among the Stanford community.
In fact, Linguistics Prof. John
Rickford said the policy seems to
merely put in writing what was
already an informal policy.
He said the policy to hire
more American minority faculty
and faculty of color is a good pol
icy that also matches affirmative
action guidelines for students.
"Students who qualify for
special recruitment efforts are
American, and faculty recruit
ment should match that," he
said.
However, Rickford expressed
concern over the decision's
apparent premise, which
implies that if a person is Amer
ican, he or she can better relate
to "students from a broad spec
trum."
Rickford said he doesn't
