Discussion of Stanford's writ
ing and foreign language require
ments dominated most of a rela
tively uneventful first meeting of
the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education Friday.
Although History Prof. James
Sheehan, the commission chair,
described the first session as
"nothing newsworthy," he said he
was "very pleased by the openness
and vigor of the discussion and the
useful exchange of ideas."
Sheehan had highlighted the
issue of the basic "competencies"
expected of Stanford undergradu
ates as the primary subject of the
commission's first meeting. He
identified those skills as writing,
study of a foreign language and
quantitative reasoning.
Sheehan said Friday's discus
sion centered around general as
sumptions and goals behind the
three requirements, rather than
specific curricular questions.
"The most important thing we
did was identify the things we need
to know before we make a judg
ment on these matters," he said.
"We need to first see if there is a
problem, if students are or are not
writing as well as we want them
to."

The most live
ly debate con
cerned the for
eign language re
quirement and
the differing phi
losophies behind
it. Sheehan char
acterized the dis
cussion as "a
model for the

kinds of discussions we need to
have."
Commission members broke
down into two camps on the lan
guage requirement: those who be
lieved the need for a foreign lan
guage was mainly a practical one,
and those who contend its true
value is intellectual.
Sheehan said that while some
members felt the paramount pur
pose of foreign language study is to
improve communication and cul
tural understanding, others were
more concerned with the idea that
"using another language in some
fundamental way shapes the way
we think."
Although that debate was not
fully resolved Friday, Sheehan
said he hopes the commission will
arrive at a consensus on "why we
require it â€” why [foreign lan
guage] is established in that privi
