### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
A suspected car thief was
arrested on campus last week,
when police spotted him driving a
rental car he allegedly stole from
Los Angeles International Airport.
The suspect, who gave the name
Ceesay Abubacar to the Stanford
Police, will be charged with one
count of grand theft for the stolen
1993 Ford Probe, police said.
Abubacar denies any wrongdoing.
Stanford Police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer said Abubacar claims to
be taking courses at Stanford, but
that the Registrar's Office has no
record of him. He also may be liv-

ing around campus, although he
gave an East Palo Alto address
when apprehended, Niemeyer
said.
"What we're dealing with here
is a pretty good scam artist," said
Niemeyer. "He has at least eight
different aliases."
The rental car was first seen on
campus parked in the Mirrielees
parking lot. It received several
unanswered parking citations and
was never seen occupied.
Stanford Police checked on the
vehicle and found that it was
reported stolen to Los Angeles
Police Dept. by the Los Angeles
Airport Hertz Rent A Car on Sept.
1. The car was checked out under

the name C. Abu on July 9, and
was found missing when the com
pany checked inventory.
Stanford Police, who began to
watch the stolen car more closely,
finally spotted Abubacar driving
the car on Escondido Road last
Tuesday.
Abubacar was arrested in a sim
ilar incident last November, when
caught driving a stolen Hertz
rental car from San Francisco
International Airport. He is also
suspected in the 1990 theft of
another Hertz car, which was later
found abandoned in a parking lot
in Georgia.
Abubacar is currently being
held at North County Jail.
