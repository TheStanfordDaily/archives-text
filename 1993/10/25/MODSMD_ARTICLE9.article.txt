An article on Asian American
Studies in the Oct. 12 issue of
The Daily misstated that Prof.
Gordon Chang was denied
tenure. However, Chang was not
"denied tenure"; the School of
Humanities and Sciences did not
accept the recommendation of
the History Department to award
him tenure.
In addition, an Oct. 19 article
on the reconstruction of Palm
Drive stated incorrectly that
inbound lanes between El
Camino Real and Arboretum
Road may be reduced from two to
one. The affected lanes, however,
would be between Campus Drive
and Arboretum Road.
