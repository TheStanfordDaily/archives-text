## Liberals victorious in Canadian election Conservatives trounced, lose 153 seats; Campbell ousted 
### 
TORONTO (AP) — Jean Chretien's
left-of-center Liberals, riding a wave of
discontent over a slumping economy,
swept to a massive victory in the Cana
dian election last night, putting a
humiliating end to nine years of Con
servative rule.
Prime Minister Kim Campbell's
Progressive Conservatives were wiped
off the political map, falling from 155
seats in the House of Commons to two
and losing official status in the House.

Not only was the party crushed, Camp
bell lost her own seat in Vancouver.
The Liberal victory makes Chretien
the next prime minister of this country
of 27 million people, buffeted by grow
ing budget deficits, staggering debt and
11.2 percent employment.
Campbell, the first woman to serve
in the country's highest office, was
prime minister for only four months.
She replaced former Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney, who stepped down

early.
The Liberals won a solid majority in
the 295-seat House of Commons. As a
result, Chretien will not have to work
with a minority government and
depend on other parties to pass legisla
tion as had been initially feared.
The Liberal win eventually could
affect trade relations with the United
States. Chretien has promised to rene
gotiate part of the widely unpopular
U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement.

Opponents of the 1989 deal say it has
cost hundreds of thousands of jobs.
Chretien, 59, a Quebec lawyer, cam
paigned hard on a $4.5 billion public
works job-creation plan. Part of his
platform included renegotiation of free
Trade Agreement articles on subsidies
and dumping. It was unclear what
action he would take on the three-way
North American Trade Agreement
that includes Mexico and was ratified
by Parliament in May.
