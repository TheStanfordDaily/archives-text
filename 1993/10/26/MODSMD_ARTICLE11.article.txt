School lunches too fatty
WASHINGTON (AP) — School cafeterias give
students too much salt and fat, setting them up
for cancer, heart disease and other ailments, the
Agriculture Department said yesterday.
"We can't continue to deep fry our children's
health," said Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy.
He released a report criticizing the school lunch
program for failing to meet dietary guidelines his
department helped set.
The report showed that lunches offered by the
nation's schools exceed the government's own dietary
guidelines for fat by 25 percent, for saturated fat by 50
percent and for sodium intake by nearly 100 percent.
The publication, Dietary Guidelines for Ameri
cans, says that no more than 30 percent of daily
calories should come from fat, with no more than
10 percent of daily calories from saturated fat, and
that people should eat no more than 2,400 mil
ligrams of sodium a day.
NAFTA studies discredited
WASHINGTON (AP) — Proponents and oppo
nents of a proposed free trade agreement with
Mexico are misusing economic studies to support
their claims, the chairman of the Joint Economic
Committee said yesterday.
Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., released a review of
16 of the major economic studies of the proposed
agreement that found most of thern "either flawed
in design, limited in scope or unable to accurately
predict the future economic consequences."
The administration has claimed passage of the
North American Free Trade Agreement would
result in 200,000 more jobs than it would lose over
the first two years the agreement was in effect.
Opponents of NAFTA, including major labor
unions, have contended that the pact will cost
thousands of American jobs. Ross Perot, on of
NAFTA's most vocal critics, has put the number
of jobs at risk at 5.9 million.
"A lot of false claims have been made about the
NAFTA based on these studies," said Obey, who
opposes NAFTA.
"What is exceptional is the fact that the over
whelming majority of serious studies, using differ
ent modelling techniques and different assump
tions, conclude that NAFTA will be a net positive
for the United States," said Tyson, chairman
of the president's Council of Economic Advisers.
