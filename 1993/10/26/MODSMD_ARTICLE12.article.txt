# Truce broken in Somalia

MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Militia
men loyal to Mohamed Farrah Aidid,
engaged for months in a guerrilla war with
U.N. forces, clashed with an old rival yes
terday in clan fighting that broke a 19-
month-old truce.
U.N. officials said at least 10 Somalis
were killed and 45 wounded in fierce bat
tles around Aidid's stronghold. The final
toll was expected to be higher.
U.N. and American troops stayed out of
the fray, mindful of the heavy casualties
from an Oct. 3 battle that killed 18 Ameri
cans and some 300 Somalis.
U.S. helicopters scrutinized the action
all day but did not intervene other than to
drop a smoke flare after a rocket-propelled
grenade exploded near the Sahafi Hotel
where most journalists stay. There were
reports that Pakistani peacekeepers fired
warning shots, but no reports that they
had shot at people.
The heavy fighting shattered the rela
tive calm along the city's Green Line,
which separates the southern sector held
by Aidid and Mogadishu's northern neigh
borhoods, controlled by Ali Mahdi
Mohamed.
The gunbattles began when Ali Mahdi's
supporters tried to cross the Green Line
for what was touted as a peace rally.
Spokesmen for Aidid's faction had
warned All Mahdi's followers not to come
into their stronghold, and accused Ali

Mahdi of trying to disrupt a truce Aidid
ordered Oct. 9 in his battles with U.N.
troops.
There has been speculation that Ali
Mahdi wants to provoke conflict in hopes
the 33-country U.N. force in Mogadishu
will be forced to intervene and renew its
fight with Aidid. Ali Mahdi is afraid his
rival will seize power if the United States,
the mainstay of the U.N. force, leaves by
March 31 as scheduled.
Aidid and Ali Mahdi went to full-scale
war over Mogadishu in November 1991
after allying to expel dictator Mohamed
Siad Barre. The heavy artillery, tank and
mortar battles lasted five months and
destroyed or damaged nearly 80 percent of
the seaside capital. Up to 30,000 people,
mostly women, children and the elderly,
died in fighting that persisted until a
March 1992 cease-fire.
It was unclear who fired the first shots
in yesterday's battle, the first major fight
ing in Mogadishu since Aidid declared his
truce with the United Nations.
U.N. spokesman Capt. Tim McDavitt
said foreign troops were trying not to be
drawn into the conflict because the United
Nations is trying to encourage negotia
tions on Somalia's future. That is a switch
from the United Nations' previous empha
sis on capturing Aidid, accused of master
minding attacks that have killed dozens of
peacekeepers.
