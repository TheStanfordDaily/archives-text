ASSU senators need to
correct the Pub Board's
inflexible funding rules

SOMETIMES blessings, when
multiplied, can quickly be
come curses. Just ask the
Publications Board.
With a greater number of start
up publications vying for the Pub
Board's resources, the ASSU ser
vice project recently stated it will
be unable to fund all of these
groups.
Coupled with California's frigid
economy — which has decreased
advertising revenue — the short
age of Pub Board funds means
many of these groups will be left
out in the cold.
Student publications are a vital
part of the Stanford community,
providing a voice for individuals
with many different interests and
penchants. A diversity of such
organizations is key in giving stu
dents a forum for expression,
development and the transmission
of information.
Of late, Stanford has seen sever
al start-up publications fail and
witnessed former campus main
stays brought to their knees by
dire financial straits. This has had
the unfortunate effect of silencing
the voices of the publications' con
tributors and cutting off dialogue
with their readers in the process.
With so few regular publications
currently in print, it is Unfortu
nate that enthusiastic students
who want to enrich Stanford's
print media may have nowhere to
turn for funding.
Unfortunately, there is no quick
monetary solution to the funding
problem. The Pub Board is forced
to work with an insubstantial bud
get each year, a situation made
worse by the percentage system
under which students vote to fund
the board. But with so few publica
tions actually surviving, students
rarely approve incremental in

creases for what is seen as a poor
system.
In contrast to student groups
that can request a special fee, the
Pub Board does not have the flexi
bility to ask the students for a sum
of money that it believes will cover
its costs and help failing publica
tions to get back on their feet. It is
forced to request a fee so low that
the Board is helpless to aid many
of the publications seeking fund
ing.
According to Pub Board's direc
tor, the service project is consider
ing lobbying the ASSU Senate to
create a special fee which would
allow publications to specify how
much they, as a group, need to con
tinue (or start) their work. In the
spring, the group could make its
financial needs clear to campus
voters.
However, the Pub Board and
senate must be careful to avoid a
popularity contest among small
publications, which might result if
there were a special-fee request for
every publication. The campus
would not benefit from pitting
individual publications against
each other. In that case, the Uni
versity would once again be left
with a paucity of written publica
tions.
Clearly, the senate should make
fundamental changes in the way it
funds Pub Board, enabling it to
request the money it will need
based on more information than
just an old budget. If the Pub
Board could present a fair and
manageable budget to the senate
before the end of winter quarter, a
more reasonable level of funds
could be suggested on the ballot
for students to approve.
It is of utmost importance that
the student body maintains a voice
in the approval of funds for the
Pub Board, but as it stands the
students are voting on an outdated
budget. For publications on cam
pus to survive, it is imperative that
the Pub Board have the flexibility
to at least ask for the funding that
a vibrant campus press would
need.
