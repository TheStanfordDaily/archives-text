# N'Gai Croal: notes of a non-native son
## How Spike and Stanford wasted their time 
### 
IT HAD THE makings of greatness.
Take one internationally acclaimed
director (Spike Lee), add 1,700 of
America's brightest minds (you and me,
among others) and bring it to a boil in the
saucepan that is one of the world's finest
academic institutions (our beloved Stan
ford University). The expected dish? An
informative exchange of ideas that few
people in the country are privy to.
Sadly, the result was closer to
warmed-over Alpo. Spike took the stage
like a low-key stand-up comic, opening
his speech with a few witticisms and con
gratulating himself on his recent mar
riage, all to thunderous applause.
Next, he used the recent controversy
surrounding Touchstone Pictures' "The
Program" — which contained scenes of
steroid-addled football players lying in the
middle of a freeway and inspired fatal imi
tations — to make an obvious point about
the responsible use fo the power of film.
The rest of Spike's speech was a recap
of his entree into film and his career since
then. His insider's look at what it took to
make each of his films seemed informa
tive . . . until we realize that everything
he told us is common knowledge, readily
available in the books he's written and
interviews he's granted over the last sev
eral years. It's the same as paying Spike
$12,500 to recycle his own quotes —
intriguing in its self-referentiality, but
pointless as an expensive speaking

engagement.
That didn't stop us from doing an
Oscar-caliber impersonation of Pavlov's
dogs, clapping wildly in response to the
slightest hint of humor, profanity or
potentially offensive comment on Spike's
part. Style triumphed over substance
that night, but the mere presence of
celebrity seemed to make it worthwhile
for those of us who attended.
Once he finished speaking, I thought
it couldn't get worse. Then Stanford's
creme-de-la-creme opened their mouths
to ask questions. One person asked Spike
if he could recommend a good screenwrit
ing book; he gave her an answer that she
could have obtained from any bookstore
clerk in the country.
Since Spike dissed gangsta movies,
someone else rushed to defend them,
claiming that these stories hadn't been
told until recently and that these films
were necessary to depict a side of Ameri
ca that most people know about.
Doesn't the respondant realize that
rappers Ice Cube, N.W.A. and The Geto
Boys tell in three minutes what writer
directors John Singleton and the Hughes
Brothers take over ninety minutes to
explain? That these films are porno-min
strel shows: packaged (un)reality that
middle-class people consume voraciously
from the safety of their homes or subur
ban theaters, while ignoring the real-life
inner-<tity people that die every day? As

Spike said, we know what's going on in
the ghetto. But nothing is being done —
and that nothing includes New Jack
gangsta-'hood shoot-'em-ups, whose
glossy aestheticization of black-on-black
crime only contributes to the problem.
My hopes were raised when people
started asking him about his films;
unfortunately, they seemed completely
unfamiliar with them. Another woman
asked why the classroom scenes at the
end of "Malcolm X" — one set in Harlem,
the other in Soweto — weren't racially
integrated, a la Benetton ad campaign. If
you can't answer that question for her,
stop reading this column now. Bone up
on your current events instead.
Of course, no self-respecting, celebri
ty-featuring event on campus would be
complete without the ambitious, upward
ly mobile student who boldly uses the
question-and-answer session to get a job
with said celebrity. A word of advice to all
you climbers out there: do your home
work. None of Spike's interns have risen
to significant positions of power — artis
tic or production — from the ranks of
interns. None. Nada. Zip.
We wasted Spike's time and he wasted
ours, as well as our money. This could
have been avoided if the format had been
different — perhaps 15-30 minutes of
preferatory remarks, followed by 30-90
minutes of question-and-answer, hope
fully from people who know something

about the speaker and have thought
about what they're going to ask. This
would have forced Spike to deviate from
his rehashed script and given us the
chance to learn something that we
couldn't elsewhere; in other words, make
him earn his fee.
In short, my fears about bringing him
to speak here were entirely well-founded.
Spike is a filmmaker, not a thinker, not a
doer. That's not to say that he doesn't
think or do anything valuable, but nei
ther his thoughts nor his life story are
especially instructive. His films, however,
are. And had we asked him intelligent
questions about them in a different for
mat, we could have patted ourselves on
the back for money well spent.
Instead, we basked in the presence of a
celebrity who deigned to stand in the same
room as us. It almost surprises me that a
group of high-maintenance, mildly cynical
people such as ourselves would settle for
so much less. What happened to us?
It had to be the shoes.

N'Gai Croal hopes that this column won't
prevent him from securing that presti
gious Key Grip Internship at Forty Acres
& A Mule Filmworks.
