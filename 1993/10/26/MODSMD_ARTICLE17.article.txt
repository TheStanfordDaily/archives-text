## Protecting us from freedom 
### 
IT IS ALMOST EXPECTED, as Win
ston Churchill once said, that college
students will be more idealistic than
the rest of society. College campuses nur
tured blasphemous rock 'n' roll in the
19505, instigated anti-war demonstra
tions in the 19605, advocated free sex in
the 19705, and embraced a new gender
and race awareness in the 1980s.
While in general I think this idealism
is healthy, at some point one's starry
eyed perspective is also the source of
one's maladjustment within the context
of society's realities. There will come a
time when we all, to some degree or
another, will leave the paradise of the
Stanford campus. We must be prepared
for this change.
As I look around it seems that student
idealism on campus has, in some ways,
created an overly sensitive and psycho
logically coddled student body. There is a
speech code on campus to protect individ
uals from psychologically distressing
words, and minority groups are segregat
ed into theme houses in order to avoid
the psychological pain of living with
those who are different.
I don't mean to imply that there are
not persuasive cultural arguments for
theme houses or a speech code, but
unfortunately I think that these arrange
ments do a larger disservice to all
involved. Whether we like it or not, for
our nation to survive people of all races
and ethnicities must live and work

together. This does imply a degree of
assimilation into some form of American
culture. Stanford may do a good job of
addressing the psychological and cultural
anxieties of different groups through the
theme house structure, but this only
seems to set us many steps back with
respect to society.
I belong to an ethnic minority, and 1
grew up in probably the most integrated,
diverse venue in the nation â€” New York
City. I recall apprehensive and uncom
fortable moments when I was the only
non-black person playing basketball
across from my apartment building, and
when I attended a high school where
those of Japanese, Chinese and Korean
descent were the most represented ethnic
groups. I think that everyday experiences
like these taught to me live and work
with those who are different.
Certainly there were cultural issues
which I never addressed in New York.
However, I think it is telling that I have
far fewer friends from minority back
grounds at Stanford. Students are so con
cerned with addressing the psychological
anxieties of living together that the cam
pus has become factionalized on racial
lines.
When is the individual who has grown
up in an all-white neighborhood going to
learn to live with minorities, if not at
Stanford? When is the child of inner-city
poverty going to learn to work amicably
with people of different backgrounds, if

not at Stanford? When will we learn to
live and work together as one communi
ty, if not at Stanford?
These appear to be the forgotten
issues in the campus dialogue. Instead,
the same concerns of psychological
anguish are rehashed ad nauseam in the
context of misplaced idealism.
Freedom implies a degree of responsi
bility. Admitting that we are one free
society does imply certain psychological
anxieties. Often we have to listen to peo
ple say things that we find personally
repulsive. As great as the temptation may
be, if we limit what people say and erect
artificial walls around particularly vul
nerable groups, then we have replaced
freedom with paternalism.
As ideal as the paternalism of psycho
logical coddling may seem, we cannot
allow ourselves to take that route. We
must continue to strive for greater racial
justice; we must continue to seek a better
society. We must prepare ourselves to live
with and exercise the individual freedom
which allows us to seek these ends.
Our collegiate idealism at Stanford
has lost touch with the realities of a free,
diverse societv.

Jeremi is torn between the realities of
New York and the isolation of Stanford.
