## Rajiv Chandrasekaran A 						responsibility to print untruths? A newspaper's dilemma 
### 
1 DON'T KNOW Bradley K. Smith, but for
the past two weeks he has been my lift-
Two weeks ago, Mr. Smith sent The Daily
a check and a rather innocuous-looking adver
tisement for publication titled, "A Revision
ist's View of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial
Museum in Washington, D.C."
A brief reading was all it took to disgust
me.
Beginning with the exhortation "You have
the right to know the truth,"the ad attempt
ed to question the authenticity of the muse
um's exhibits — and, in effect, the Holocaust
itself — through pseudo-scholarly debate.
Although Mr. Smith cleverly avoided vio
lent language and ethnic invective, the mes
sage is clear: racism, pure and simple.
Ads like this one are no strangers to college
campuses. In 1991, Mr. Smith attempted to
publish like-minded ads at nearly a dozen uni
versities across the nation. Headlined "The
Holocaust Controversy: The Case for Open
Debate," the ads asserted that "Jews made up
the Holocaust to gain sympathy," that the fig
ure of 6 million Jewish deaths is an "irre
sponsible exaggeration," and that gas cham
bers were actually "life saving" fumigation
shelters used to delouse clothing and prevent
disease.
Citing a newspaper's role in promoting free
expression, newspaper editors at Duke, Cor
nell, Northwestern and the University of
Michigan decided to print the ad, braving
protests from students, faculty and their own
editorial boards.
Editors at the Harvard Crimson, the Yale
Daily News, the Brown Daily Herald and the
Daily Californian at UC-Berkeley, among oth
ers, refused to publish it.
The Daily has no obligation — under the
First Amendment or otherwise — to print the
ad. Implicit in the concept of a free press is a
newspaper's freedom to publish what it
chooses. As Benjamin Franklin said when he
ran a newspaper, "This is not a public stage
coach that has to take everyone who buys a
ticket."
The Daily, however, sees merit in both
approaches. On one hand, free expression is
the cornerstone of democracy. Free debate of
issues and beliefs — even the most firmly
entrenched — only serves to strengthen what
is widely held as the truth. As John Stuart
Mill wrote in "On Liberty," "The beliefs
which we have most warrant for have no safe
guard to rest on but a standing invitation to
the world to prove them unfounded."

To deny the Holocaust may be abhorrent,
but to require that it be discussed within cer
tain limits may do a greater injustice to the
memory of its victims and humankind in gen
eral. "When there is free expression," wrote
the New York Times in an editorial about the
ads, "even the ugliest ideas enrich democra
cy."
While such debate may be valuable, its
proper forum is not in a newspaper. Restrict
ed by time and space, newspapers cannot
engage in debate over fundamental issues
simply so some can attempt to prove them
unfounded. Is grass green? Is the Earth
round? Those are questions better left for dis
cussion in a classroom or in the Coffee House.
Readers also have the legitimate expecta
tion that what they read in our pages is, to the
best of our knowledge, true. The Daily is not a
venue in which every lunatic can bring his
complaint or hypothesis. A bond of trust is
created between a publication and its readers.
If we knowingly print historical lies, that
bond is violated.
That's not to say that The Daily is not
committed to an open marketplace of ideas.
Take, for example, the recent anti-abortion ad
that ran in our paper. Abortion, capital pun
ishment, euthanasia, affirmative action —
these are all moral questions open to legiti
mate debate in society. And as offensive as we
may find an opposing side on any such issue,
it is hard to argue they should not be present
ed in The Daily and discussed.
The occurrence of the Holocaust is a differ
ent story.
David M. Oshinsky and Michael Curtis,
professors at Rutgers University, explained in
the New York Times why such ads should be
rejected:
"If one group advertises that the Holocaust
never happened, another can buy space to
insist that American blacks were never
enslaved. The stakes are high because college
newspapers may soon be flooded with ads that
present discredited assertions as if they were
part of normal historical debate. If the Holo
caust is not a fact, then nothing is a fact, and
truth itself will be diminished."
For those reasons, I have refused to pub
lish the advertisement in The Daily. We can
not promulgate such debate and accept money
for the promotion of what amounts to hatred,
absurdity and factual error.
By refusing to print Mr. Smith's ad we
haven't denied his right to free expression. He
can make thousands of handbills and dis

tribute them throughout campus. He can
stand in the middle of White Plaza and deliv
er his message. He just can't use The Daily as
a way to disseminate his views.
Why then does part of Mr. Smith's ad
appear on this page? For one simple reason.
So readers can see what people like him are
spreading throughout the country. He tar
gets colleges and high schools, trying to
brainwash impressionable minds. Others
who share his views use computer networks
and talk radio shows to spread this virulent
message.
And their efforts are making headway. The
Roper poll that the ad mentions is sobering.
Although many have questioned the poll's
accuracy, the fact remains that a significant
portion of the American public either doesn't
know enough about the Holocaust or doesn't
believe it happened. Such news should pro
vide a wake-up call to today's students, both
Jews and non-Jews: Holocaust education
must continue.
Some will argue that by printing the ad,
The Daily is simply furthering Mr. Smith's
cause. If we'd all ignore types like him, many
say, their influence would be much smaller.
To an extent, I agree.
But suppressing these ads plays into Mr.
Smith's strategy: that evidence of the Holo
caust is difficult to obtain and that the truth
cannot be questioned. At Stanford, it is
unlikely that printing a portion of the ad will
win any new followers for Mr. Smith's cause.
What I hope it will do is encourage an often
apathetic campus to learn about the issues
involved.
When was the last time you talked or read
about the Holocaust? Do you know any more
than the two paragraphs contained in 10th
grade history texts? If someone approached
you on the street and said, "The Holocaust
never happened," could you respond?
If not, take the time to learn. Read a book.
Talk to a professor. Take a class. Visit the
museum.
When you leave this campus, realize that
not everyone shares the common beliefs many
of us at Stanford hold. Realize that such
atrocities can and are happening again.
Look at Bosnia and other places where
racial and religious persecution are running
rampant. And remember the simple phrase:
"Never again."

insist that American blacks were never
enslaved. The stakes are high because college
newspapers may soon be flooded with ads that
present discredited assertions as if they were
part of normal historical debate. If the Holo
caust is not a fact, then nothing is a fact, and
truth itself will be diminished."
For those reasons, I have refused to pub
lish the advertisement in The Daily. We can
not promulgate such debate and accept money
for the promotion of what amounts to hatred,
absurdity and factual error.
By refusing to print Mr. Smith's ad we
haven't denied his right to free expression. He
can make thousands of handbills and dis

tribute them throughout campus. He can
stand in the middle of White Plaza and deliv
er his message. He just can't use The Daily as
a way to disseminate his views.
Why then does part of Mr. Smith's ad
appear on this page? For one simple reason.
So readers can see what people like him are
spreading throughout the country. He tar
gets colleges and high schools, trying to
brainwash impressionable minds. Others
who share his views use computer networks
and talk radio shows to spread this virulent
message.
And their efforts are making headway. The
Roper poll that the ad mentions is sobering.
Although many have questioned the poll's
accuracy, the fact remains that a significant
portion of the American public either doesn't
know enough about the Holocaust or doesn't
believe it happened. Such news should pro
vide a wake-up call to today's students, both
Jews and non-Jews: Holocaust education
must continue.
Some will argue that by printing the ad,
The Daily is simply furthering Mr. Smith's
cause. If we'd all ignore types like him, many
say, their influence would be much smaller.
To an extent, I agree.
But suppressing these ads plays into Mr.
Smith's strategy: that evidence of the Holo
caust is difficult to obtain and that the truth
cannot be questioned. At Stanford, it is
unlikely that printing a portion of the ad will
win any new followers for Mr. Smith's cause.
What I hope it will do is encourage an often
apathetic campus to learn about the issues
involved.
When was the last time you talked or read
about the Holocaust? Do you know any more
than the two paragraphs contained in 10th
grade history texts? If someone approached
you on the street and said, "The Holocaust
never happened," could you respond?
If not, take the time to learn. Read a book.
Talk to a professor. Take a class. Visit the
museum.
When you leave this campus, realize that
not everyone shares the common beliefs many
of us at Stanford hold. Realize that such
atrocities can and are happening again.
Look at Bosnia and other places where
racial and religious persecution are running
rampant. And remember the simple phrase:
"Never again."

1 DON'T KNOW Bradley K. Smith, but for
the past two weeks he has been my lift-
Two weeks ago, Mr. Smith sent The Daily
a check and a rather innocuous-looking adver
tisement for publication titled, "A Revision
ist's View of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial
Museum in Washington, D.C."
A brief reading was all it took to disgust
me.
Beginning with the exhortation "You have
the right to know the truth,"the ad attempt
ed to question the authenticity of the muse
um's exhibits — and, in effect, the Holocaust
itself — through pseudo-scholarly debate.
Although Mr. Smith cleverly avoided vio
lent language and ethnic invective, the mes
sage is clear: racism, pure and simple.
Ads like this one are no strangers to college
campuses. In 1991, Mr. Smith attempted to
publish like-minded ads at nearly a dozen uni
versities across the nation. Headlined "The
Holocaust Controversy: The Case for Open
Debate," the ads asserted that "Jews made up
the Holocaust to gain sympathy," that the fig
ure of 6 million Jewish deaths is an "irre
sponsible exaggeration," and that gas cham
bers were actually "life saving" fumigation
shelters used to delouse clothing and prevent
disease.
Citing a newspaper's role in promoting free
expression, newspaper editors at Duke, Cor
nell, Northwestern and the University of
Michigan decided to print the ad, braving
protests from students, faculty and their own
editorial boards.
Editors at the Harvard Crimson, the Yale
Daily News, the Brown Daily Herald and the
Daily Californian at UC-Berkeley, among oth
ers, refused to publish it.
The Daily has no obligation — under the
First Amendment or otherwise — to print the
ad. Implicit in the concept of a free press is a
newspaper's freedom to publish what it
chooses. As Benjamin Franklin said when he
ran a newspaper, "This is not a public stage
coach that has to take everyone who buys a
ticket."
The Daily, however, sees merit in both
approaches. On one hand, free expression is
the cornerstone of democracy. Free debate of
issues and beliefs — even the most firmly
entrenched — only serves to strengthen what
is widely held as the truth. As John Stuart
Mill wrote in "On Liberty," "The beliefs
which we have most warrant for have no safe
guard to rest on but a standing invitation to
the world to prove them unfounded."

To deny the Holocaust may be abhorrent,
but to require that it be discussed within cer
tain limits may do a greater injustice to the
memory of its victims and humankind in gen
eral. "When there is free expression," wrote
the New York Times in an editorial about the
ads, "even the ugliest ideas enrich democra
cy."
While such debate may be valuable, its
proper forum is not in a newspaper. Restrict
ed by time and space, newspapers cannot
engage in debate over fundamental issues
simply so some can attempt to prove them
unfounded. Is grass green? Is the Earth
round? Those are questions better left for dis
cussion in a classroom or in the Coffee House.
Readers also have the legitimate expecta
tion that what they read in our pages is, to the
best of our knowledge, true. The Daily is not a
venue in which every lunatic can bring his
complaint or hypothesis. A bond of trust is
created between a publication and its readers.
If we knowingly print historical lies, that
bond is violated.
That's not to say that The Daily is not
committed to an open marketplace of ideas.
Take, for example, the recent anti-abortion ad
that ran in our paper. Abortion, capital pun
ishment, euthanasia, affirmative action —
these are all moral questions open to legiti
mate debate in society. And as offensive as we
may find an opposing side on any such issue,
it is hard to argue they should not be present
ed in The Daily and discussed.
The occurrence of the Holocaust is a differ
ent story.
David M. Oshinsky and Michael Curtis,
professors at Rutgers University, explained in
the New York Times why such ads should be
rejected:
"If one group advertises that the Holocaust
