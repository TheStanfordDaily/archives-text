# You have the right to know the truth!
## A
						REVISIONIST'S VIEW OF THE U.S. HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM IN WASHINGTON, D.C. 
### Bradley R. Smith 
After tcs yean ia the planning, $165 million in sUrt-up costs and a government
gin ran ton of teoa of million! mora in tax subsidies, the United Stain Holocaust
Memorial Museum demonstrate* why, according to a Roper Organization poll, 22
p|f '• mit (acme 25 millions!) of all adult Americana have doubts about the orthodox
Holocaust story.

What arc the facts?
The U.S. Holocaust Memorial
Museum displays ao proof anywhere of
homicidal "gassing" chambers and no
proof that even one individual was
"gaaaed" at any camp liberated by Allied
armies.
"Proof* for a gas chamber at Birkenau
is a plastic model created by a Polish
artiste. A plastic copy of a metal door is
displayed as "proof of a homicidal gss
chamber at Maidanek. And, incredibly,
the Muaeum has simply "dropped* the
Auschwitz gas chamber, the casement
room visited yearly by hundreds of
thousands of tourists in Poland.
There is oo mention of the alleged gaa
chambers at Bucheuwald or even at
Dachau, where after World War Two
American O.Ls and German civilians
were assured that more than 200,000
victims were 'gassed and burned."
Human soap? Human skin lamp
shades? Not a sign of them in this
Museum. These monstrous lies are now
all gone—straight down the memory hole!
The notion that eyewitness testimony
given under highly politicized and
emotional circumstances, which this
museum relies ao heavily on, is, prima
Jade, true, waa refuted by the Israeli
Supreme Court when it acquitted John
Demjanjuk of being 'Ivan the Terrible.*
The Israeli Court found that the eyewit
nesses who testified against Demjanjuk
could not be believed!
Deborah Lipstadt argues in her much
praised Denying the Holocaust, that

revisionists ("deniers'] should not be
debated becauae there "can not be"
another aide to the Holocaust story. She
charges that it is "hateful" to listen to a
defense of those accused of mass murder!
la essence, she argues that we bury
America'! old civil virtuea of free inquiry
and open debate — but to what end?
The Deborah Lipstadts—and there is a
clique of them oo every campua—work to
auppress revisioniat research and demand
that atudeoU and faculty ape their fascist
behavior. If you refuse to accept the
Lipstadt clique as your intellectual
fiuirtrt, you risk being slandered as an
"and-scmite." These quasi-religious
Holocaust zealots claim that becauae of
the "purity" of their own feelinga about
the Jewiah experience during World War
Two, yours are aoiled if you doubt what
they preach as "truth."
Winston Churchill, in his massive six
volume history of World War Two, and
Dwigbt D. Eisenhower in his memoirs,
both omitted all reference to "gaa
chambers* and their uae in an alleged
"genocide* of the Jewa. How do the
Museum and the Deborah Lipstadts
explain that?
To many it will appear impossible that
deception on such a grand scale can
actually be taking place. Yet such
deception is not unusual in the realma of
politics, idoology or religion. We are
being deceived for one reason, and one
reason only-we have refused to listen to
the other side of the story.

The Operation and Technique of the Museum
The Museum's exhibit technique ia a mixture of ainialer suggestion and diahonest
omission. The first display confronting visitors beginning the Museum tour is s wall
sized photograph of American aoldiers looking at corpses smoldering on s pyre. The
'context* in which you see the photo suggests that the dead are 'exterminated* Jewa.
But were the prisoners killed or did they die of typhus or some other diacaae during
the last terrible weeks of the war? Autopsies made by Allied medical personnel found
that inmates diod of disease. Not one was found to have been 'gassed. * All such relevant
Information Is purposely omitted from the exhibit. We don 'l even know that the dead
pictured in the photo are Jews!
Unable to judge the significance of the photograph, and not wanting to believe the
Museum would mislead you, you are moved to accept the falae and manipulative
suggestion that it represents the 'genocide" of the Jews.
