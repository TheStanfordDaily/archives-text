# U.S.-born hiring policy questioned

### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Members of Stanford's communities
of color are expressing concern and am
bivalence about a University affirma
tive action policy that encourages hiring
U.S.-born faculty through financial in
centives.
While some condemn the policy for
encouraging discrimination, others
downplay its potential impact on hiring
practices. However, most said they had
not received adequate information
about the policy to make a final judg

The new policy "needs discussion,"
said El Centro Chicano Director
Frances Morales, pointing out the un
fairness of the revised rules. "Some of

the most active students in our commu

to use that criterion against people" in
hiring practices, she said.
Despite her reservations, Morales
said she wanted to learn more about the
policy and discuss it with other mem

However, some have already made up
their minds. "I'm kind of upset about
it," said Fernando Soriano, a visiting as
sistant professor of psychology and edu

"The problem is that it feeds the anti
immigrant hysteria we have here in Cal
ifornia. . . . We're assigning a value to
people based on where they were born,"
said Soriano, who was born in Mexico
but has lived in the United States since
he was a year-old.

The revised policy, which went into
effect on Sept. 1, offers financial re
wards to Stanford's seven schools for
hiring U.S.-born minority faculty mem
bers. Deans would receive half their
schools' annual median salary to add to
their budgets for each targeted faculty
member hired.
In addition, for every member of the
targeted groups hired, the school will re
ceive a "half-billet" â€” the equivalent of
an additional half-time professorship.
"In the normal course of things, if a
Russian history professor retires, you
often would simply search for another
Russian history professor; your chances
of finding a minority in that discipline
are slim and none," Provost Condoleez-
