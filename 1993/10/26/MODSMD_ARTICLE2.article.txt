# U.S.-born hiring policy questioned
## 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Members of Stanford's communities
of color are expressing concern and am
bivalence about a University affirma
tive action policy that encourages hiring
U.S.-born faculty through financial in
centives.
While some condemn the policy for
encouraging discrimination, others
downplay its potential impact on hiring
practices. However, most said they had
not received adequate information
about the policy to make a final judg
ment.
The new policy "needs discussion,"
said El Centro Chicano Director
Frances Morales, pointing out the un
fairness of the revised rules. "Some of

the most active students in our commu
nity were born in Mexico. Ilt's not fair)
to use that criterion against people" in
hiring practices, she said.
Despite her reservations, Morales
said she wanted to learn more about the
policy and discuss it with other mem
bers of the community.
However, some have already made up
their minds. "I'm kind of upset about
it," said Fernando Soriano, a visiting as
sistant professor of psychology and edu
cation.
"The problem is that it feeds the anti
immigrant hysteria we have here in Cal
ifornia. . . . We're assigning a value to
people based on where they were born,"
said Soriano, who was born in Mexico
but has lived in the United States since
he was a year-old.

The revised policy, which went into
effect on Sept. 1, offers financial re
wards to Stanford's seven schools for
hiring U.S.-born minority faculty mem
bers. Deans would receive half their
schools' annual median salary to add to
their budgets for each targeted faculty
member hired.
In addition, for every member of the
targeted groups hired, the school will re
ceive a "half-billet" — the equivalent of
an additional half-time professorship.
"In the normal course of things, if a
Russian history professor retires, you
often would simply search for another
Russian history professor; your chances
of finding a minority in that discipline
are slim and none," Provost Condoleez-
za Rice said in a statement.
"With the fund, however, you
might recruit an excellent minor
ity in another specialty and still
fulfill your Russian history need
through the additional half-billet
or by pairing it with another
half-billet you might have in
hand," Rice continued.
Stanford's Incentive Fund for
a Diverse Faculty — which,
under different names, has
financed minority faculty hiring
incentives since 1971 — will fund
the grants.
Some community members
say the policy's criteria are vague
and detrimental to the Universi
ty's affirmative action goals.
"Under [this] policy, I would
have to go through an extra
hurdle if I wanted to stay here"
as a tenured professor, Soriano
said.
"We have so few Latinos in
higher education anyway and
this would make things worse,"

Soriano added. "The objectives
are great but there are other
ways that people could achieve
this."
Morales stressed that a per
son's involvement in the commu
nity — not his place of birth — is
the more important considera
tion.
"I like that Stanford is trying
to promote the hiring of more
faculty of color [but] I think that
using that criterion is not fair.
There should be more concrete
criteria," she said.
Although the policy's per
ceived implications have some
worried, others downplay the sig
nificance of the change.
Psychology Prof. Ewart
Thomas said that the new policy
would be only a minor influence
on hiring practices.
The details of the policy are
less important than the results,
explained Thomas, former dean
of Humanities and Sciences. He
added that "the business of hir
ing faculty is driven by quality. I
don't think the new policy will
change that."
"As a dean, you are reacting to

what the departments want to do
[and] you're not concerned with
where people were born,"
Thomas said.
John Pearson, director of the
Bechtel International Center,
also expressed little concern. "I'd
be very worried if it hurt foreign
born faculty hiring," he said. "I
would suspect that when consid
ered for tenure or a job, other
things would be taken into
account."
"I think it's great and a posi
tive statement, but I don't think
they're on very safe ground if it's
at the expense of another group.
I hope Ithe University] is not say
ing that," Pearson said.
Legal ramifications are also a
concern. Law School Assoc. Prof.
Bill Hing, an expert in immigra
tion law, said that the legal
issues surrounding the new poli
cy were "very complicated."
"This really raises big issues
with respect to who should bene
fit from affirmative action and
who should not," Hing said. "The
answer to that question may dif
fer from one community to
another."

financed minority faculty hiring
incentives since 1971 — will fund
the grants.
Some community members
say the policy's criteria are vague
and detrimental to the Universi
ty's affirmative action goals.
"Under [this] policy, I would
have to go through an extra
hurdle if I wanted to stay here"
as a tenured professor, Soriano
said.
"We have so few Latinos in
higher education anyway and
this would make things worse,"

Soriano added. "The objectives
are great but there are other
ways that people could achieve
this."
Morales stressed that a per
son's involvement in the commu
nity — not his place of birth — is
the more important considera
tion.
"I like that Stanford is trying
to promote the hiring of more
faculty of color [but] I think that
using that criterion is not fair.
There should be more concrete
criteria," she said.
Although the policy's per
ceived implications have some
worried, others downplay the sig
nificance of the change.
Psychology Prof. Ewart
Thomas said that the new policy
would be only a minor influence
on hiring practices.
The details of the policy are
less important than the results,
explained Thomas, former dean
of Humanities and Sciences. He
added that "the business of hir
ing faculty is driven by quality. I
don't think the new policy will
change that."
"As a dean, you are reacting to

what the departments want to do
[and] you're not concerned with
where people were born,"
Thomas said.
John Pearson, director of the
Bechtel International Center,
also expressed little concern. "I'd
be very worried if it hurt foreign
born faculty hiring," he said. "I
would suspect that when consid
ered for tenure or a job, other
things would be taken into
account."
"I think it's great and a posi
tive statement, but I don't think
they're on very safe ground if it's
at the expense of another group.
I hope Ithe University] is not say
ing that," Pearson said.
Legal ramifications are also a
concern. Law School Assoc. Prof.
Bill Hing, an expert in immigra
tion law, said that the legal
issues surrounding the new poli
cy were "very complicated."
"This really raises big issues
with respect to who should bene
fit from affirmative action and
who should not," Hing said. "The
answer to that question may dif
fer from one community to
another."
Members of Stanford's communities
of color are expressing concern and am
bivalence about a University affirma
tive action policy that encourages hiring
U.S.-born faculty through financial in
centives.
While some condemn the policy for
encouraging discrimination, others
downplay its potential impact on hiring
practices. However, most said they had
not received adequate information
about the policy to make a final judg
ment.
The new policy "needs discussion,"
said El Centro Chicano Director
Frances Morales, pointing out the un
fairness of the revised rules. "Some of

the most active students in our commu
nity were born in Mexico. Ilt's not fair)
to use that criterion against people" in
hiring practices, she said.
Despite her reservations, Morales
said she wanted to learn more about the
policy and discuss it with other mem
bers of the community.
However, some have already made up
their minds. "I'm kind of upset about
it," said Fernando Soriano, a visiting as
sistant professor of psychology and edu
cation.
"The problem is that it feeds the anti
immigrant hysteria we have here in Cal
ifornia. . . . We're assigning a value to
people based on where they were born,"
said Soriano, who was born in Mexico
but has lived in the United States since
he was a year-old.

The revised policy, which went into
effect on Sept. 1, offers financial re
wards to Stanford's seven schools for
hiring U.S.-born minority faculty mem
bers. Deans would receive half their
schools' annual median salary to add to
their budgets for each targeted faculty
member hired.
In addition, for every member of the
targeted groups hired, the school will re
ceive a "half-billet" — the equivalent of
an additional half-time professorship.
"In the normal course of things, if a
Russian history professor retires, you
often would simply search for another
Russian history professor; your chances
of finding a minority in that discipline
are slim and none," Provost Condoleez-
za Rice said in a statement.
"With the fund, however, you
might recruit an excellent minor
ity in another specialty and still
fulfill your Russian history need
through the additional half-billet
or by pairing it with another
half-billet you might have in
hand," Rice continued.
Stanford's Incentive Fund for
a Diverse Faculty — which,
under different names, has
financed minority faculty hiring
incentives since 1971 — will fund
the grants.
