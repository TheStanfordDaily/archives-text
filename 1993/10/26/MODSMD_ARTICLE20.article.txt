## Women's soccer coach Sawyers' road leads to Stanford Wordwide travels, life experience give Cardinal kickers a refreshing change of pace and optimistic outlook 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
The road to a head coaching
position is usually thought to con
sist of many years, not many
miles.
For women's soccer coach lan
Sawyers, it took an 18-month
journey around the world to point

him in the right direction. After
four years of college life at the
Carnegie School of Physical Edu
cation in Leeds, England, Sawyers
and four of his friends decided
they needed a change.
"I got a little disoriented with
the educational system in Eng
land," said Sawyers. "It was a
time when it was breaking down.

They finally restructured it all
and totally changed it, but during
that time me and some friends
who went to school together
decided to go explore the world."
The group embarked for parts
unknown toward the end of 1986.
Finding enough work to survive
was their first obstacle, but
Sawyers said that New York, Cal

ifornia and Australia were the
three places they made enough
money to support their travelling
budgets.
"It was the greatest learning
experience in the world," he said.
"We got to involve ourselves in so
many cultures. English people are
very insular in their thinking,
caught in their own traditions,
and I was very much like that.
"When I travelled, it was a
great experience for me to realize
that people were just being friend
ly to be friendly and invite you
into their culture and have you
experience it first-hand."
Winding up in Colorado work
ing during the ski season at the
end of the year-and-a-half, the
Sunderland, England native was
offered a job in California. Howev
er, he instead returned home to
teach. But he quickly realized
that he didn't want to live there
anymore, so he returned to West
Coast in 1988 to work as a man
ager of a soccer store and a coach
working with college-bound play
ers, his first exposure to coaching
women's soccer.
Involved with soccer since he
was a child, Sawyers played pro
fessionally for two years in Eng
land for Division II Rotherham
United. A reserve team midfield
er, he combined his professional
experience with a degree in physi
cal education to pursue coaching.
"I wasn't really a big-timer,
making the big money," Sawyers
joked. "It was a fun experience,
and I learned a lot during that
whole time."
After brief stints as Director of
Soccer at the Mision Viejo Soccer
Club and work with the Olympic

Development Program, Sawyers
was offered a head coaching posi
tion at Colorado College. Howev
er, former Stanford women's
head coach Berhane Andeber
hahn offered Sawyers a job as an
assistant coach at Stanford,
which he accepted in 1991.
After Andeberhahn left the
program this summer, Sawyers
was named interim head coach
due to the lack of time available to
complete a thorough search for a
replacement.
"They asked me to help out
during the whole interview pro
cess to keep the recruits and the
paperwork going," Sawyers said.
"I hope I'm going to be considered
for the full-time job, but I pro
mised the kids I wouldn't worry
about it, because you don't want
it to affect the way you deal with
players or the way you deal with
training."
The Athletics Department
plans to renew its search after the
season is over, according to Senior
Associate Athletic Director Cheryl
Levick. "With the soccer season
upon us, there was not enough
time for a thorough search," said
Levick.
Although the team's 14-2-1
record and No. 4 ranking this year
help make a case for Sawyers' per
manent promotion, he knows it is
not a guarantee.
"I don't want to worry about
that, I just want to do a good job,"
he said. "The administration has
been very supportive to our team
and to me personally."
Despite the shift in coaching,
many of the players feel very little
change from last year.
"We anticipated a rough tran

sition, but with lan, it has been
very smooth," said senior forward
Sarah Rafanelli. "The freshmen
have stayed very optimistic and
enthusiastic, and lan is doing a
great job."
As one of the Cardinal's top
recruits, Erin Martin faced some
difficulty in her first few weeks at
Stanford. "When I came in, I just
thought 'just put [the coaching
change] behind me and move on'
because there was nothing I could
do about it, so just look forward to
the future. I was really happy to
play for lan when I came in,
because he's a great coach."
In his short tenure as head
coach, Sawyers already has sever
al very special memories of this
year. Topping his list include the
support from the team the day he
notified them of his promotion to
head coach and the team's effort
against women's soccer power
house North Carolina at the Chal
lenge Club College Tournament
in Houston on Oct. 17.
"Even though it looks like we
lost, you know, 3-1 is a loss, the
effort and the joy and fun and
enthusiasm of that game was
really special," Sawyers said.
"One of the things I really wanted
the players to feel from that game
was the fun of the game, to really
enjoy it.
"Sometimes a big game like
that can be very stressful for play
ers, but we didn't want them to
let the moment escape them.
Sometime during the game we
wanted them to stop and think
'this is awesome, we're having a
great time' — just not on a break
