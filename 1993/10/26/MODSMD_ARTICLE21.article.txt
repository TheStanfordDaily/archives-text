# Cross-country teams shine in obscurity
## 
### 
Baby, you were born to run. But not like
these psychopaths.
Take Gary Stolz. Stolz is one of two
seniors on the Stanford men's cross-country
team. He was runner-up at last year's NCAA
individual championships.
When he talks about distances, you'd
think he was driving a Range Rover, not
some worn-out pair of Nike waffle racers.
"I used to put in 60-70 miles a week," says
Stolz, scoffing at those undisciplined days of
old. "Now I might run 115 miles in a week."
115 miles? A quick calculation on the
Daily supercomputer puts Stolz's average
workout, assuming he runs every single day,
at just under 17 miles per jaunt. That's about
six trips around Campus Drive per day.
"That's probably a reflection of Gary's
own development," said head coach Vin
Lananna, tongue-in-cheek. "Gary's a little
bit of the exception."
Stolz is just one cog, albeit a key one, fac
toring into the current resurgence of the
Stanford cross country program. The
women's squad is ranked ninth in the coun
try, while the men log in at No. 10, the best
combined ranking ever for the two teams.
Both teams have legitimate shots at
league titles when the Stanford Golf Course
hosts the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships this Saturday. It's going to be an
event worth seeing.
"[The conference championship| is a pos
sibility, but not a strong possibility," said
Stolz.

Psychologically, among the Pac-10 teams
Oregon should provide Stanford with its
stifTest competition. "Oregon's got a strong
mental attitude," said Stolz. "If they roll the
dice and get snake eyes, they win."

Hmm. Gambling analogies aside, the meet
should be extremely close on both gender
fronts. Lananna, who coached each Stanford
team a to fourth-place conference finish last
year, sees 15-20 points separating the top
three women's teams. The men's race should
be even closer.
"This will be a hotly-contested team bat
tle," said Lananna. "It will be a great iiift 1
for spectators."
Only at this school can a mid-autumn
cross country meet be called great for specta
tors. On the East Coast, such end-of-the-year
races evoke images of slush, sweats and sleet.
This is far from the case at Stanford,
where only parents wear shirts and long
pants to football games.

"The weather out here is a tremendous
advantage," said Lananna. "When we're
training, we don't have to worry about rain
and cloudy days."
Neither do fans, which makes prospects of
going out and rooting on the Cardinal in a
cross country meet a whole lot more inviting.
Not that cross country is high up on the
list of traditional spectator sports. Dorms sel
dom rally around their in-house harriers
(that means "runners" in Track Speak). "Big
Meet" never sells out (actually, there is no
Big Meet); in fact, meets never sell out, as
admission is free to all races. Cross country
has never once been featured on "Wide
World of Sports."
Both Lananna and Stanford assistant
coach Betsy Riccardi acknowledge their
sport's lack of spectator popularity. "A lot of
the fans that do come out are high-school
runners and family members of the team,"
said Lananna.
But Grandma Stolz isn't the only one who
will be in attendance at this Saturday's race.
The Pac-10 meet, hosted by the Cardinal
every year since 1989, drew about 1,000 fans
last year and promises to draw more with
Stanford's rising fortunes in 1993.
With the women's race starting at 3:15
p.m. and the men's event following at 3:45
p.m., the meet should be perfect for football
fans looking to avoid the post-game traffic
jam, according to Lananna.
