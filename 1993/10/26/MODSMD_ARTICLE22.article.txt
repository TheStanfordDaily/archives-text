### Todd Bernstein Staff writer 
The Stanford equestrian team
started its fall season off on the
right hoof by giving a strong perfor
mance at the Cal-State Fresno Invi
tational, held Oct 16-17.
The tournament.which the team
had only a week to prepare for, was
the first show of the 1993-94 Inter
collegiate Horse Show Association
season and provided a glimpse at
the Cardinal team, its prospects for
future success and the opponents it
must face in order to advance to fur
ther tournament action.
The squad competed against
teams from UC-Davis, CaJ Poly-
Sari Luis Obispo, Cal Poly-Pomona,
USC and the University of Nevada
at Reno. Despite the strength of the
USC and Cal-Poly teams, the Car
dinal proved victorious in several
regards, with three team members
garnering awards.
Junior Quito Pearlman led the
Cardinal by taking first place in the
Novice Equatation over Fences
competition. Pearlman's perfor
mance automatically qualifies him
for the regional finals, which will be
held in April.
Coming in strong in the Open-
Stock Seat division was junior

Geneva Gano, who placed second in
this area on Saturday and first on
Sunday.
Furthermore, team president
Kirsten Mattern placed second Sat
urday in the Intermediate Equata
tion Flat competition and third in
the Intermediate Equatation over
Fences division on Sunday.
Equestrian squad members
were pleased with the results and
hope that they are a harbinger of a
fruitful season. "Taking into con
sideration the fact that we had only
one week to prepare for the tourna
ment, I was very pleased with the
team's effort," Pearlman said.
"Judging by this show, I feel we will
have a very successful season."
The Cardinal will have a signifi
cantly longer time to prepare for
their next meet, which will not take
place until Jan. 8 at Davis against
the same teams it faced at Fresno.
Despite the fact that the other
teams will have an equally long
time to prepare for the competi
tion, Stanford's team is optimistic
regarding their prospects, and
hoping to improve last year's sec
ond-place regional finish. "We
have a lot of new team members
this year, but if we concentrate
and work hard, we should do well,"
said Mattern.
