# Hockey squad slips, falls to No. Arizona
## 
### Todd Bernstein Staff writer 
After starting the season with
two impressive wins over the Uni
versity of Pacific, the Cardinal ice
hockey team dropped a two-game
series this weekend at the Golden
Gate Ice Arena in Redwood City
against a tough Northern Arizona
team by a 5-3 margin on Friday
and a score of 8-0 on Saturday.
The Northern Arizona squad,
which boasted Division I standing
before its stadium burned down,
came into the house that Stanford
built and proceeded to take it apart
one brick at a time.
The Cardinal offense, which
scored 33 goals in 15-1 and 18-2
victories over the Tigers two weeks
ago, was completely dismantled
this weekend by a hard-hitting
Lumberjacks defense.
"The offense was out of synch,"
said senior right-winger Cory Sam
mons, who played despite a bout
with the flu this weekend. "We
weren't connecting on our passes,
and we didn't put the puck in the
net." Despite the general lack of
offensive production throught the
lineup, the Cardinal's Luke Winter
scored two goals for the Cardinal

over the weekend.
Coach Ernie Ferrari is quick to
point out that the games were clos
er than the scores show. "Northern
Arizona was a well-organized team
that had a lot of depth," Ferrari said
of the losses Stanford suffered this
past weekend. "We were not expect
ing such tough competition ... but
the team was able to make great
strides so early in the season."
The team will try to rebound
from the punishment dished out by
the Lumberjacks as it travels to take
on Colorado on Friday and Colorado
State on Saturday and Sunday.
However, the team will have to
battle against the Buffaloes and
Rams without the services of Evan
Singer, who suffered a cracked ver
tebrae on Friday. Teammate Re
mato Cedolin, who suffered a
cracked rib in Saturday's game,
has also been temporarily sc
ratched from this weekend's lineup
and is listed as a day-to-day. While
Cedolin is doubtful for this week
end's games, Singer will miss a
minimum of six weeks.
Sammons expects the three
games this weekend to be tougher
than last weekend's games, but
insists that the team will be ready
to play, despite the injuries.
