# Athletes of the Week

The Daily's Athletes of the Week —
Explosions. They may come in many forms:
bombs, dynamite, land mines or in more
unlikely guises. This weekend, Cardinal
opponents were the victims of two major
explosions. And the mad bombers responsi
ble for these detonations were none other
than football fullback Ethan Allen and soc
cer center midfielder Carmel Murphy, this

half-fortnight's Athletes of the Week.
Allen attempted to light a fuse under
neath the Cardinal this weekend via an
explosive 82-yard dash which, in turn, ignit
ed the Stanford offense. Trailing 17-7 before
Allen's burst, Stanford subsequently took a
24-20 lead before falling victim to Arizona's
State's fulminations and falling 38-30.
The 82-yard eruption was the fifth
longest dash in Stanford history. The senior
from St. Peter, Minn., had a total of 90 yards
rushing for the game. Moreover, it sparked a
Stanford running attack which in previous
games had been virtually nonexistent.
Instead, the combination of Allen and Ellery
Roberts (59 yards) stormed through the
ASU line quicker than another Ethan Allen
stormed Eort Ticonderoga.

While Allen's run was like an A-bomb,
women's soccer star Carmel Murphy's week
end performance was more akin to the
steady explosiveness of a machine gun,
relentlessly boring away at opposing defens
es and setting the tone of the Cardinal's
matches against No. 2 California and
unranked Butler.
Murphy has been dropping bombs for
much of ber career; Soccer America maga
zine tabbed her for last year's Freshman All-
American team. The sophomore from Leuca
dia, Calif., had a goal and an assist in the two
matches. But even more impressive than

Murphy's scoring outbursts was her iron
grip on the pace of the two games. The mid
fielder's hustle during the Butler game was
termed "tremendous" by coach lan Sawyers.
Murphy's performance was doubly impor
tant, as it sparked a Cardinal offense which
had appeared stagnant, scoring only three
goals in their last three gamen. But behind
the midfielder, the Cardinal scored four
goals in each of their weekend matches.
