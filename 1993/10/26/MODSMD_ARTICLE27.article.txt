Women's Tennis:
The top-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team saw
action for the first time this sea
son at the Riviera Ail-American
Championships last weekend.
With the country's No. 1-
ranked player, senior Laxmi
Poruri, opting to bypass the
tournament in favor of a pro
event, Stanford was eligible to
send just three delegates to the
collegiate Grand Slam tourna
ment held in Pacific Palisades,
Calif.
The high level of play took its
toll on the Poruri-less Stanford
netters. Kim Shasby, ranked
sixth in the country and seeded
fourth in the tourney, manged
to score straight-set first- and
second-round victories over two
highly regarded Canadians,
Suzanne Italiano of USC and
Duke's Monica Mraz.
Later, though, Shasby was
eliminated by Georgia's Angela
Lettiere in the quarterfinals, 4-
6, 6-2, 6-4.
Junior Kristine Kurth,
ranked 24th in the nation, fal
tered in the first round, losing
to Jana Strnadova of Syracuse,
6-1, 7-5.
The doubles team of Kurth
and sophomore Beth Berris was
also a first-round casualty. The
duo fell to the event's second
seeded tandem, UCSD's Julie
McKeon and Laura Richards, 6-
4, 6-0.
