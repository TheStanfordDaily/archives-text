# Staff member arrested for embezzlement
## 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
A staff member in the Office of Development
surrendered to Stanford Police yesterday on a
charge of grand theft for the alleged embezzle
ment of payroll funds.
Rolanda Fields, 23, an office assistant, is sus
pected of having paid herself as much as $14,000
more than she was supposed to receive by manip
ulating the computerized payroll system, said
Sgt. Rick Enberg. He added that the embezzle
ment has been going on for at least a year.
Fields turned herself in to the police yesterday
at 10 a.m. after she was notified that a warrant
for her arrest had been issued.
The Office of Development first reported the
missing money Aug. 17, launching the ongoing
police investigation that led to
the recent charges against
Fields.
The office said in a statement
released yesterday that the
money was stolen from payroll
funds, and that there does not
appear to be "any irregularity in
the accounts related to donations
to the University."
Payroll was not part of Fields'
duties at the office, and it is not
yet clear how she allegedly
altered the accounts, Enberg
said.
Fields has been fired by the
office. She is currently being held
at the Santa Clara County
Women's Detention Facility in
Milpitas, with bail set at $3,000.
Arraignment is pending.
Fields could face additional
charges, depending on the out
come of the investigation, Enberg
said in a statement.
