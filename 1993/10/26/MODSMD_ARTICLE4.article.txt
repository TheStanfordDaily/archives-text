# Student TV station eyeing independence
## 
### Beth Berselli 
Spurred on by recent financial
troubles, the Stanford Cardinal
Broadcasting Network is exploring
the possibility of becoming inde
pendent from the University.
"We're caught in a Catch-22 be
cause we need money to generate
appealing programming, but the
student body isn't giving us any,"
said junior Matthew Kulikowski,
SCBN station manager.
Becoming independent would
help alleviate the network's lack of
funding by allowing the network to
receive outside advertising fund
ing through paid commercials.
SCBN was denied its special fee re
quest in last spring's ASSU elec
tions.
"With the financial crisis that
we're having now, we either need
to go independent or get student
funding," said sophomore Jason

Wishnow, the network's technical
director.
SCBN, which will kick off its
regular programming on Nov. 1,
received $4,000 from the Program
Board last year, but its staff is not
certain it will receive that funding
this year. The projected operating
budget for this year is $33,000,
which they calculated when apply
ing for the special fee. However,
without the Program Board funds,
SCBN has no financial resources.
"If we take other routes to fund
ing, we'll be able to produce inter
esting and appealing program
ming," Kulikowski said.
To supplement the station's
handful of continuing and new
shows, it may also "help in the pro
duction, editing and broadcasting"
of dorm video productions, and is
looking into getting MTV and
ESPN broadcast on campus,
Kulikowski said. Other feasible
options include a satellite hookup
to other universities and expand
ing its broadcasting into Palo Alto.
Regular broadcasting airs on
channel 10 of the SUNet, with
100 new volunteer recruits help
ing with the production process.
Programming will include both
new and returning shows.
Senior Kul Wadhwa is pro
ducing a new talk show that will
air Wednesdays at 10 p.m. "It
will be like the 'Late Night'
setup up, but hopefully more
intellectually stimulating to
cater to the Stanford audience,"
Wadhwa said.
Wadhwa will interview campus
personalities such as Stanford foot
ball head coach Bill Walsh and Dis
tinguished Hoover Eellow George
Shultz. The show will focus on
"their background, what they're

about, why they do what they do,
how they got where they are — the
more human side of them because
most people don't know what
they're like outside of their profes
sional or academic life."
In addition, the station has
added other new programs to
reach out to a broad audience.
"Time in the Word," a new reli
gious program produced by
ReJOYce in Jesus, a Christian
student group on campus, will
broadcast Sundays at 9 p.m. And
a drama/murder-mystery series is
still in the works.
Returning SCBN programs
include extended sports and
events coverage; "Swap Meet," a
dating game show; and "Eat My
Video," a music video show that's
"like 'Beavis and Butt-head'
except with real people," said
Kulikowski.
The station will also air special
broadcasts, such as those follow
ing the 1992 response to the Rod
ney King verdict, to report on
major breaking news.
