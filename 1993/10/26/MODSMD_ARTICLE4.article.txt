Spurred on by recent financial
troubles, the Stanford Cardinal
Broadcasting Network is exploring
the possibility of becoming inde

cause we need money to generate
appealing programming, but the
student body isn't giving us any,"
said junior Matthew Kulikowski,
SCBN station manager.

help alleviate the network's lack of
funding by allowing the network to
receive outside advertising fund

"With the financial crisis that
we're having now, we either need
to go independent or get student
funding," said sophomore Jason

Wishnow, the network's technical
director.

regular programming on Nov. 1,
received $4,000 from the Program
Board last year, but its staff is not
certain it will receive that funding
this year. The projected operating
budget for this year is $33,000,
which they calculated when apply
ing for the special fee. However,
without the Program Board funds,
SCBN has no financial resources.
"If we take other routes to fund
ing, we'll be able to produce inter
esting and appealing program
ming," Kulikowski said.
To supplement the station's
handful of continuing and new
shows, it may also "help in the pro
duction, editing and broadcasting"
of dorm video productions, and is
looking into getting MTV and
