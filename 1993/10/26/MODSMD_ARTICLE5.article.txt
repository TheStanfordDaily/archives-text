# Special-fee refund rate soars
## Funding threatened by graduate student revolt 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
As a result of a graduate student revolt, ASSU fee re
fund rates have increased dramatically this quarter,
leaving special-fee-funded student groups with at least
a 9 percent decrease in expected funding.
Students requested a total of $165,000 in refunds, a
71 percent increase over fall quarter last year, said
ASSU Financial Manager Brian Hillger.
Seventy-five percent of these requests came from
graduate students, prodded on by the Graduate Stu
dent Tea Party, a recently formed group that spear
headed the effort to increase graduate students' knowl
edge of the fee-refund system
"I think the point of our campaign was just to be
heard and to make the point that the grad students are
a large body that needs to have a voice on campus," said
Karen Seta, a student in the School of Medicine and one
of the coordinators of the graduate student refund
drive.
"Hopefully, we won't have to continue to do this next
quarter," she said. "This is not meant to be anything
punitive, it's really meant to make a point."

fund process, sending electronic
mail messages to more than 4,000
graduate students in an effort to
elicit support.
"I think this shows that grad
students can pull together and
form a voice," said Seta. "In that
respect, it was a success."
But despite the Tea Party's
intentions, student groups will
undoubtedly feel a financial pinch
this year, causing some students
to feel that the refund drive will do
more harm than good.
"Let's face it. In the end, we're
here to take advantage of what
this University has to offer," said
junior Jason Colton, director of
the Concert Network and business
manager for KZSU. "All these peo

pie are doing is making a political
statement."
"I just don't think risking the
existence of campus organizations
is worth it,"he added.
Senior Steve Zika, chairman of
the Axe Committee, agreed, saying
that "there's no doubt that it will
hurt our efforts.
"In terms of how it affects the
students, as a chairman of a student
group, I think that any time events
cannot occur as usual, it hurts
groups on campus," he said. "That
hurts the students themselves."
Colton expressed similar dissat
isfaction. "For KZSU, a 10 percent
reduction in budget is extremely
significant," he said. "The truth of
the matter is that we're already
strapped to the bone."
Hillger said the refund rates for
specific groups did not deviate far
from the average rate of 34 per
cent, implying that students were

not particularly selective in choos
ing groups to refund.
"Fifty percent of the students
[who requested refunds] refunded
all of the groups," he said, adding
that 5,043 students will receive
refunds this fall, double the num
ber in previous years.
Although a 25 percent buffer —
based on last year's refund rate —
was built into the groups' pro
posed budgets to absorb the effects
of the refunds, "the other 9 per
cent is money that the groups will
never see," Hillger said.
Next year, groups will employ a
much larger buffer amount in
order to ofTset the increased num
ber of refunds, he added.
Engineering graduate student
Michael Grant, a coordinator of the
graduate student refund drive, rec
ognized that the refunds will hurt
student groups. "There's no doubt
that at the moment, it's just going

to tick a lot of people off," he said.
"After the initial shock, maybe
people will make constructive
changes to the special-fee system,"
Grant added.
Graduate senator Neil Crellin
agreed, saying that "the current
problems demonstrate what is
wrong with the fee system in gen
eral."
"The process relies on the
ignorance of the majority to raise
the funds," Crellin said, pointing
out that students often do not
request refunds simply because
they do not know that the option
exists.
"I don't think the grads were
being particularly vindictive, but I
think they suddenly found out
about the process and the system
of ignorance did not work as well
as it did previously," he added.
Senate chair Greg Waldorf also
attributed the increase in refunds

to failures in the system. "This sit
uation makes a strong case that
the special-fees process is not
working correctly," he said.
"Everybody would be better
served by revising the process."
Crellin described the fee system
as a "downward spiral." When
people take refunds, "the fees go
up and more people take refunds,
so eventually the bills become very
high and no one can afford not to
get a refund," he said.
Both Crellin and graduate sena
tor Sanford Dickert agreed that
student groups need to pay more
attention to graduate students'
concerns.
"Student groups assume that it
is understood that everyone is wel
come in their meetings," said
Dickert. "But grad students are
not actively pursued by many of
the organizations — if they were,
grad students would not have

made such a large financial state
ment this quarter."
Such graduate sentiment flared
up last year when, in the spring
general election, the special fee for
the Graduate Student Association
was defeated.
"Last year's election was a cata
lyst which forced graduate stu
dents to find ways to make
changes," explained Crellin. "In
many ways, I'm very impressed by
the Tea Party because they have
created a resurgence of graduate
student activism."
Dickert pointed to an ASSU
constitutional amendment which
will be on the ballot this spring as
a solution to the current crisis in
the special-fee process.
"What the ASSU should do is
make sure the students are aware of
the amendment which allows grads
and undergrads to vote on each spe
cial fee individually," he said.

pie are doing is making a political
statement."
"I just don't think risking the
existence of campus organizations
is worth it,"he added.
Senior Steve Zika, chairman of
the Axe Committee, agreed, saying
that "there's no doubt that it will
hurt our efforts.
"In terms of how it affects the
students, as a chairman of a student
group, I think that any time events
cannot occur as usual, it hurts
groups on campus," he said. "That
hurts the students themselves."
Colton expressed similar dissat
isfaction. "For KZSU, a 10 percent
reduction in budget is extremely
significant," he said. "The truth of
the matter is that we're already
strapped to the bone."
Hillger said the refund rates for
specific groups did not deviate far
from the average rate of 34 per
cent, implying that students were

not particularly selective in choos
ing groups to refund.
"Fifty percent of the students
[who requested refunds] refunded
all of the groups," he said, adding
that 5,043 students will receive
refunds this fall, double the num
ber in previous years.
Although a 25 percent buffer —
based on last year's refund rate —
was built into the groups' pro
posed budgets to absorb the effects
of the refunds, "the other 9 per
cent is money that the groups will
never see," Hillger said.
Next year, groups will employ a
much larger buffer amount in
order to ofTset the increased num
ber of refunds, he added.
Engineering graduate student
Michael Grant, a coordinator of the
graduate student refund drive, rec
ognized that the refunds will hurt
student groups. "There's no doubt
that at the moment, it's just going

to tick a lot of people off," he said.
"After the initial shock, maybe
people will make constructive
changes to the special-fee system,"
Grant added.
Graduate senator Neil Crellin
agreed, saying that "the current
problems demonstrate what is
wrong with the fee system in gen
eral."
"The process relies on the
ignorance of the majority to raise
the funds," Crellin said, pointing
out that students often do not
request refunds simply because
they do not know that the option
exists.
"I don't think the grads were
being particularly vindictive, but I
think they suddenly found out
about the process and the system
of ignorance did not work as well
as it did previously," he added.
Senate chair Greg Waldorf also
attributed the increase in refunds

to failures in the system. "This sit
uation makes a strong case that
the special-fees process is not
working correctly," he said.
"Everybody would be better
served by revising the process."
Crellin described the fee system
as a "downward spiral." When
people take refunds, "the fees go
up and more people take refunds,
so eventually the bills become very
high and no one can afford not to
get a refund," he said.
Both Crellin and graduate sena
tor Sanford Dickert agreed that
student groups need to pay more
attention to graduate students'
concerns.
"Student groups assume that it
is understood that everyone is wel
come in their meetings," said
Dickert. "But grad students are
not actively pursued by many of
the organizations — if they were,
grad students would not have

made such a large financial state
ment this quarter."
Such graduate sentiment flared
up last year when, in the spring
general election, the special fee for
the Graduate Student Association
was defeated.
"Last year's election was a cata
lyst which forced graduate stu
dents to find ways to make
changes," explained Crellin. "In
many ways, I'm very impressed by
the Tea Party because they have
created a resurgence of graduate
student activism."
Dickert pointed to an ASSU
constitutional amendment which
will be on the ballot this spring as
a solution to the current crisis in
the special-fee process.
"What the ASSU should do is
make sure the students are aware of
the amendment which allows grads
and undergrads to vote on each spe
cial fee individually," he said.
As a result of a graduate student revolt, ASSU fee re
fund rates have increased dramatically this quarter,
leaving special-fee-funded student groups with at least
a 9 percent decrease in expected funding.
Students requested a total of $165,000 in refunds, a
71 percent increase over fall quarter last year, said
ASSU Financial Manager Brian Hillger.
Seventy-five percent of these requests came from
graduate students, prodded on by the Graduate Stu
dent Tea Party, a recently formed group that spear
headed the effort to increase graduate students' knowl
edge of the fee-refund system
"I think the point of our campaign was just to be
heard and to make the point that the grad students are
a large body that needs to have a voice on campus," said
Karen Seta, a student in the School of Medicine and one
of the coordinators of the graduate student refund
drive.
"Hopefully, we won't have to continue to do this next
quarter," she said. "This is not meant to be anything
punitive, it's really meant to make a point."
The graduate students involved in the campaign
went to great lengths to inform students about there-

fund process, sending electronic
mail messages to more than 4,000
graduate students in an effort to
elicit support.
"I think this shows that grad
students can pull together and
form a voice," said Seta. "In that
respect, it was a success."
But despite the Tea Party's
intentions, student groups will
undoubtedly feel a financial pinch
this year, causing some students
to feel that the refund drive will do
more harm than good.
"Let's face it. In the end, we're
here to take advantage of what
this University has to offer," said
junior Jason Colton, director of
the Concert Network and business
manager for KZSU. "All these peo

pie are doing is making a political

"I just don't think risking the
