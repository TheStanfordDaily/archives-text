# Honor Code violations increase
## Annual report reveals record levels of misconduct last year 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
The number of reported Honor Code vi
olations doubled between the 1991-92 and
1992-93 academic years, according to an
annual summary of misconduct cases re
leased yesterday by the Judicial Affairs Of
fice.
There were 40 reported violations of
the Honor Code last school year, the high
est number of charges since the office
began keeping records in 1972. Of the 40
charges, 33 students received penalties
for the infractions. In the 1990-91 and
1991-92 school years, only 20 infractions
were reported to the University.

Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole said
the increase in reports can be attributed to
"two conspicuous possibilities: either stu
dents are more dishonest than they used to
be ... or the number of reports has in
creased."
Cole was also quick to note that out of
the 40 charges reported, seven were later
dropped for various reasons.
The alleged Honor Code violations in
three of last year's winter quarter final
exams were not included in the summary
since "no charges were filed as a result of
early exam violations," Cole said, adding
that while those incidents were "prob
lems," they "in no way explain the increase
from last year."

Out of the 40 Honor Code cases, 15
were reported from computer science
courses, mostly as a result of plagiarism
and unpermitted collaboration on comput
er programs. However, this number is not
out of the ordinary from previous years,
said Computer Science Prof. Eric Roberts.
Because a computer science program
that doesn't work is useless, "the frus
tration builds and the availability of
[other people's] answers creates a cli
mate in which some people are led to
cheat," he said. "Some students are un
aware of how easy it is to detect similari
ties in programs."
