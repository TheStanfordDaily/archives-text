# Honor Code violations increase
## Annual report reveals record levels of misconduct last year 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
The number of reported Honor Code vi
olations doubled between the 1991-92 and
1992-93 academic years, according to an
annual summary of misconduct cases re
leased yesterday by the Judicial Affairs Of
fice.
There were 40 reported violations of
the Honor Code last school year, the high
est number of charges since the office
began keeping records in 1972. Of the 40
charges, 33 students received penalties
for the infractions. In the 1990-91 and
1991-92 school years, only 20 infractions
were reported to the University.

Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole said
the increase in reports can be attributed to
"two conspicuous possibilities: either stu
dents are more dishonest than they used to
be ... or the number of reports has in
creased."
Cole was also quick to note that out of
the 40 charges reported, seven were later
dropped for various reasons.
The alleged Honor Code violations in
three of last year's winter quarter final
exams were not included in the summary
since "no charges were filed as a result of
early exam violations," Cole said, adding
that while those incidents were "prob
lems," they "in no way explain the increase
from last year."

Out of the 40 Honor Code cases, 15
were reported from computer science
courses, mostly as a result of plagiarism
and unpermitted collaboration on comput
er programs. However, this number is not
out of the ordinary from previous years,
said Computer Science Prof. Eric Roberts.
Because a computer science program
that doesn't work is useless, "the frus
tration builds and the availability of
[other people's] answers creates a cli
mate in which some people are led to
cheat," he said. "Some students are un
aware of how easy it is to detect similari
ties in programs."
But Roberts added that the
Computer Science Department is
taking steps to reduce the number
of cheating incidents. "We've asked
that if people do talk, which we
encourage, that they cite their
sources," he said.
The remaining Honor Code
cases arose in 13 different
departments, which covered
humanities as well as the sci
ences. Approximately two-thirds
of the Honor Code violations
were committed by men, and 34
of the 40 students charged were
undergraduates.
In addition to Honor Code viola
tions, there were 12 reported viola
tions of the Fundamental Stan
dard, including telephone harass
ment, theft, assault and transcript
alteration. There were no Campus
Disruption Policy violations.
Cole said it was "a pretty normal
year" for her office apart from the

increase in Honor Code cases.
Last week, Mary Edmonds, vice
provost and dean for student
affairs, announced that the Honor
Code will be reviewed this year for
the first time since 1976.
As part of this review, students
will be asked to fill out anonymous
surveys reporting any dishonest
acts they have committed since
entering Stanford.
Cole said she hopes these
reports will allow the Judicial
Affairs Office to better under
stand the increase in the number
of Honor Code infractions last
year.
"We hope this will give us a bet
ter sense of whether the level of
honesty has changed. That's the
point at which we can revisit the
question of last year's violations,"
she said.
Cole said the review process will
be handled by the Student Conduct
Legislative Council. "They have
jurisdiction over the Honor Code,
so it only seems appropriate that
they look at whether the rules are
working," she said.
