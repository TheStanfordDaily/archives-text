# Raccoons unmasked
## Furry foragers amuse, annoy campus residents

While the infamous tiger salamanders
have been stealing all the attention late
ly, the raccoons on campus still continue
with their garbage-rifling, night-wan
dering ways.
Most often spotted near Branner! lall,
Cowell Cluster and the School, the
animals both fascinate and annoy stu
dents, especially at this time of year,
when they seem to be more visible than
usual.
Grounds Supervisor Larry Atwater
attributes the apparent increase of rac
coon activity to the season. "They have
their little ones now," he said. And the
younger raccoons, at about six months
old, have reached the age when their
mothers begin teaching them to find

their own food, Atwater explained.
Although Stanford's raccoon popula
tion is not noticeably growing, the rac
coons have caused their fair share of
problems. They've created the most nui
sance while foraging for grubs or insect
larvae on the School's front lawn,
said Rich Skalski, Stanford's pest control
field representative.
"I can see where the raccoons have
been," said sophomore Becca Miller, who
noticed the lawn's disarray. "There are
splotches of torn up grass."
No action has been taken to remedy
the problem, though, since the raccoons
would simply move to another lawn,
Skalski said.

After dark, omnivorous raccoons prowl the campus, foraging for food. The crea
tures particularly enjoy rummaging through garbage cans.
