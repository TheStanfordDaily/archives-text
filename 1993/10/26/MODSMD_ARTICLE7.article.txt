# Raccoons unmasked
## Furry foragers amuse, annoy campus residents 
### Diane Chen 
While the infamous tiger salamanders
have been stealing all the attention late
ly, the raccoons on campus still continue
with their garbage-rifling, night-wan
dering ways.
Most often spotted near Branner! lall,
Cowell Cluster and the School, the
animals both fascinate and annoy stu
dents, especially at this time of year,
when they seem to be more visible than
usual.
Grounds Supervisor Larry Atwater
attributes the apparent increase of rac
coon activity to the season. "They have
their little ones now," he said. And the
younger raccoons, at about six months
old, have reached the age when their
mothers begin teaching them to find

their own food, Atwater explained.
Although Stanford's raccoon popula
tion is not noticeably growing, the rac
coons have caused their fair share of
problems. They've created the most nui
sance while foraging for grubs or insect
larvae on the School's front lawn,
said Rich Skalski, Stanford's pest control
field representative.
"I can see where the raccoons have
been," said sophomore Becca Miller, who
noticed the lawn's disarray. "There are
splotches of torn up grass."
No action has been taken to remedy
the problem, though, since the raccoons
would simply move to another lawn,
Skalski said.

After dark, omnivorous raccoons prowl the campus, foraging for food. The crea
tures particularly enjoy rummaging through garbage cans.
"They're a Stanford communi
ty as much as the students are," he
added.
But when a residence or depart
ment does complain, Stanford's
maintenance crews set live traps
and bring the captured raccoons to
the Santa Clara County Humane
Society, Skalski said.
The raccoons are "indigenous to
the whole area," said Ray Busley,
vice president and regional manag
er of Crane Pest Control. "They do
live in the Foothills but are quite
adapted to flat, populated areas.
Even Palo Alto and residential
areas have them."
While raccoons are omnivorous
and "will eat anything they can
find" including bird eggs, small
animals, grubs, snails and vegeta
tion, "one of their favorite pas
times" is rummaging through
garbage bins, Busley said.
At Whitman, the raccoons eat
food the students provide for the
resident cat. "Cat-feeding on cam
pus really encourages their
growth," Busley added.
Despite the raccoons' mis
chievous nature, most Stanford

students don't seem to mind them.
"We're invading their privacy, not
the other way around," said Whit
man resident Sean McLeary.
The raccoons, which make their
homes in hollow trees, campus
attics or storm drains, are tamer
than ones McLeary has seen in the
wild. "They just sit on the side of
road, and you almost step on them
when you're running."
"I keep almost hitting them
when I rollerblade in the quad,"
sophomore Tom Hertenstein said.
"But personally I like them."
Not all students, however,
appreciate the raccoons. Junior
Alison Gorman often passes the
creatures in the Whitman court
yard. "I scream every time I see
them," she said. "They scare me!"
Pablo Garcia, Whitman's house
manager, said that people some
times "get antsy" when they see
the raccoons and often ask, "Is the
raccoon going to bite me?"
When raccoons do frighten people,
"We kind of shoo them out and scare
them by making noise, and they
usually wander off," Garcia said.
The raccoons sire "very bold"
and "can get vicious if you get too
close or hem them in a corner,
especially when they have their
young," At water warned.
