# Palo Alto OKs development plan
## 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
Despite protests from the Stanford Homelessness
Action Coalition and many local residents, the Palo
Alto City Council last night approved a proposal to
develop private office space on University land.
The council voted unanimously in favor of a pro
posal from a local developer to lease the property from
the University. Under the proposal, the land, at 1050
Arastradero Road, will be used to extend a currently
existing research park. The land had previously been
zoned for housing, so the agreement between the
developer, Keenan & Gates, and the University had
been delayed until the council approved re-zoning.
The final proposal to the council hinged on a com
plex agreement between the city and Keenan &
Gates, under which Palo Alto receives the option to
buy another site, 753 Alma St., from the developer.
The city could then use this location, in downtown
Palo Alto, to build affordable, low-income housing for
local city workers.
Although this alternative, which could provide 88
single-residence occupancies (SROs), was offered,
many meeting attendees still expressed dissatisfac
tion. Among them was senior Theo Emery, a member
of the homelessness coalition. Emery petitioned the
council to delay a vote on the proposal until the Stan
ford community becomes more aware of the issue.

"What is at stake is the sacrifice of human inter
ests over commercial interests. I find it a misfortune
that Stanford has chosen to sacrifice human con
cerns," Emery said. "We would ask that voting upon
this matter be delayed until the city of Palo Alto guar
antees that (they will build the low-income housing
complex at 753 Alma]."
Some citizens were concerned over the viability of
753 Alma as a suitable location for housing. They
cited the location's proximity to auto-repair business
es and the cost of cleaning up soil contamination on
the property as possible obstacles.
Most council members acknowledged the potential
problems with the site, but felt that one clause in the
measure, which allows the city up to 18 months to
decide whether to buy the land, would provide enough
time to make the correct decision.
Council member Dick Rosenbaum said, "It's not
clear that an SRO is going to work at (753 Alma)."
Marlene Prendergast, executive director of the
Palo Alto Housing Corporation, expressed her sup
port for the proposal to build SROs at 753 Alma,
which she feels will provide much-needed low-income
housing for the city's workers.
"The 753 Alma site has difficulties, but it has some
possibilities as well," she said. "We think it will
work."
University officials were not available for com
ment on the issue.
