Ifs interesting what happens when you give extraordinary people an extraordinary amount of
autonomy and support.
They innovate like crazy. Then their company takes off and grows like very few others have.
Case in point: San Diego's own QUALCOMM. We've gone from 8 employees in 1985 to over 1,200
today. That makes us one of America's fastest growing high-tech companies.
It also doesn't hurt to have the company launched by communications visionaries like Dr. Irwin M.
Jacobs and Dr. Andrew J. Viterbi.
The trick, of course, is to keep the entrepreneurial spirit flourishing despite phenomenal growth.
Thaf s why we give our engineers as much freedom and encouragement as possible. This includes an open
door policy company-wide, the latitude to set your own hours, the private space provided by your own
office, and more.
In response, QUALCOMM people have spearheaded many of our industry's most challenging
technologies. Among them are mobile satellite communication networks, dual mode (analog and
CDMA) mobile and portable phones, VLSI products, full-custom ASIC design, low earth orbit satellites,
and more.
We'll throw in the ocean —free.
Along with a highly stimulating work environment, you'll also enjoy the Southern California lifestyle,
which features one of America's most temperate climates. And QUALCOMM is less than a mile from the
Pacific Ocean.
