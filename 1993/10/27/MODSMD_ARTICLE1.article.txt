# House passes B factory
## Senate to vote on $237M project

Center got one step closer yester
day to starting construction on its
proposed $237 million asymmet
ric B factory facility.
In a 222-190 vote, the U.S.
House of Representatives ap
proved the $22 billion conference
committee bill that contains $36
million for the SLAC project. The
Senate — which is also expected
to pass the measure — will vote
later this week.
"We're pleased that it passed,
but there's still the Senate to go
through," said Michael Riordan,
assistant to SLAC Director Bur
ton Richter.
Speculating that some mem
bers of Congress might still take
issue with some aspects of the
bill, Riordan said, "We'd rather
keep our champagne bottles
corked until it's the real thing."
Despite the few hurdles that
remain, Rep. Anna Eshoo voiced
confidence that the Senate will
pass the measure.
"Today's vote on the Energy
and Water appropriations bill is
another step forward for the B
factory and SLAC," said Eshoo,
who represents Stanford in the
House and voted with the majori
ty. "I am proud to have helped
bring this project to Stanford and
look forward to the President's
signing this important legisla
tion."
Riordan still expressed some
concern over the closeness of the
vote. "Generally these final ap
propriations bills pass with over
whelming majorities. ... It
sounds like there's still some
thing in there that's controver
sial," he said.
Last week, the House over
whelmingly rejected an earlier
version of the compromise mea
sure because most members op
posed continuing construction of
the $11 billion Superconducting
Super Collider project in Texas.
On Thursday, House-Senate
negotiators effectively killed the
collider when they agreed to allo
cate $640 million in shut-down
costs for the current fiscal year.
But the conference committee did
not touch the SLAC appropriation.
At a San Francisco press con
ference earlier this month, Presi
dent Clinton expressed his sup
port for the B factory project when
he announced that Stanford had
been chosen over Cornell Univer
sity as the site of the project.
The new project would allow
SLAC to maintain its current
work force, sparing 200 to 300
workers from being laid off.
If the Senate passes the mea
sure, and Clinton signs it as
expected, SLAC scientists will
spend the next five years upgrad
ing the center's Positron-Ele£;_
tron Project ring to a state-of-tha*,,,.
art asymmetric B factory which
will collide electrons and
positrons to create rare subatom
ic particles.
By studying the behavior of
these particles, scientists hope to
gain insight into the how the uni
verse was formed.
