# Health plan falls short of goals
## $30 billion less savings than predicted in president's proposal 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton's health reform proposal will fall
$30 billion short of the budget savings pre
dicted earlier, an administration official
said yesterday as the White House readied
the plan for delivery to Congress.
Five weeks after his initial pitch, the
president and Hillary Rodham Clinton are
due to bring the 1,600-page bill to
Congress in person today in a ceremony in
Statuary Hall.
The president has argued that without
a sharp slowdown in health inflation, the
federal deficit would spired back up later in
this decade. But his economic advisers had
vowed to sacrifice further deficit reduction
before raising taxes any more for health
reform.
In the original draft, Clinton's health
plan would have lowered the deficit by $91
billion between now and the year 2000.
But Dr. Philip R. Lee, the assistant sec
retary for health, told a medical educators'
meeting the deficit reduction figure now is
"around $60 billion."
The new plan sets a deadline of Jan. 1,
1998, to achieve universal coverage for all

Americans and legal residents. The earlier
draft had aimed to bring all states into the
new system by Jan. 1,1997.
One reason for the lower deficit reduc
tion figure was that the White House
added a 15 percent cushion to its pool of
subsidies to help small businesses and low
income workers buy insurance, officials
said.
Other administration officials said the
revised plan will offer discounted coverage
to some small businesses with as many as
75 workers. The cutoff had been 50 work
ers in the original plan.
In another change, the White House
has backed down from an ambitious goal
to reserve half of all residencies for doctors
training in primary care, not specialists,
within five years.
Instead, it would set a goal of having 55
percent of the residents in primary care by
the year 2002. Seventy percent of the
625,000 U.S. doctors now are specialists.
And the revised plan will cover dental
treatment as well as preventive dental ser
vices for children and emergency dental
care for adults.

President Clinton said yesterday he was
not willing to water down his health reform
plan in the face of criticism from the
National Association of Manufacturers that
he was promising Americans too much.
"Most manufacturers are going to save
money on this. If they want to look a gift
horse in the mouth, that can be their deci
sion," he said.
Leon Panetta, the White House budget
director, said Clinton has also built in a
mechanism to cap the entitlements.
Some lawmakers have voiced fears that
Clinton was concentrating too much
power in the hands of an independent
National Health Board and the regional
alliances that would form a new insur
ance-buying marketplace.
Under the final plan, the health board
would be an executive agency, not an inde
pendent board like the Siecurities and
Exchange Commission, the sources said.
And the regional health alliances would
accept virtually all health plans with no
limits on the number of plans offering tra
ditional, fee-for-service medicine, the offi
cials said.
