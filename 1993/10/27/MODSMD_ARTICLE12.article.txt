## Editorial Honoring the Code 
### 
Student cheating is both
unethical and damaging
to Stanford's reputation

WELL, it appears that there
may have been a logical
reason for Stanford's grade
inflation after all.
On Monday, the Judicial
Affairs Office released a summa
ry of the cases they handled last
year. Among these incidents were
40 violations of Stanford's Honor
Code, ranging from plagiarism to
unpermitted collaboration on
examinations to other offenses.
To those students who remem
ber the widespread allegations of
cheating on winter quarter
finals, the doubling of Honor
Code violations between last year
and the norm of years past
should come as no surprise.
While the vast increase may be
unastonishing, that by no means
translates into acceptability. And
even though officials are unsure
as to whether there were more
violations of the code last year or
merely that a larger percentage
of incidents were reported, it is
fairly certain that the rate of
cheating by Stanford students
has somewhat increased of late.
This is an unacceptable devia
tion from the principles which
have made Stanford both a top
notch and unique university
community. Admittedly, students
feel pushed to succeed by the
undeniable fixation of corpora
tions and graduate schools on
grade point averages. And, some
times, the pressure to find a
short-cut when studying for
finals and midterms can be enor
mous.
However, there is a legion of
reasons not to cheat, some noble,
others more self-serving. First
and foremost, cheating is wrong
and unethical. By the time stu
dents arrive at Stanford, they

have heard this saying thousands
of times; nevertheless, at least 40
failed to grasp its meaning.
Cheating is a clear violation of
a compact between the Universi
ty and its students. Stanford pro
vides an open atmosphere in
which students can learn at their
own pace and with a measure of
freedom unparalleled by most
other universities. In return, it
asks its students to comply with
basic rules of honor and decency.
Cheating scandals such as the
winter-quarter finals affair also
damage Stanford's prestige in
such a significant way that, if
violations continue at their pre
sent pace, the value of a Stanford
degree will be significantly less
ened.
What employer would wish to
recruit from a University whose
students were "notorious" for
cheating? It does not require a
particularly large number of inci
dents for a school to acquire an
infamous reputation. Students
who cheat damage their class
mates' futures in ways far
greater than merely bettering
their score on a final.
Many students plead ignorance
regarding Stanford's Honor
Code, stating that it is not clear
ly enunciated to them when they
enter Stanford and periodically
over the course of their studies.
While this argument is feeble at
best, it is hoped that the upcom
ing Honor Code review, the first
performed since 1976, will do its
best to ensure that certain stu
dents cannot hide behind this fig
leaf.
Midterms are here. For some
students, there is and will be the
temptation to violate the sacred
trust among students, teachers
and the University itself. Before
doing so, however, they should
consider that Stanford exists
only because of the beams and
pillars of trust that connect
scholar to teacher, teacher to
school. And removing only one
beam can cause even the strong
est house to fall.
