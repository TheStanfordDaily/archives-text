## Voices of ghosts and gods 
### 
WHEN THE BLUE dark rolls
down from the foothills, and you
find yourself alone in your room,
to which ghosts do you whisper, to which
gods do you pray? Does Nostalgia sift in
through the window, bringing with her
the figures and voices of people you once
knew? And in what language do you
speak to them, as they settle into your
easy chair, or lean up against a wall? And
do you ever stop believing, even for a
moment, that really, they are the stuff of
this world, these ghosts and gods of your
mind?
I don't. If you see me wandering in an
aimless daze or talking to myself, don't
pay me any mind. I am keeping the com
pany of Memory's daughters as they
remind me of the women who cared-Tor ,
me as a child, a boy I loved, or my broth
er and sister miles away. I am not one for
much small talk because there's just too
many people and landscapes and ideas
that are busy speaking in my mind. But if
you want, when the afternoon is long and
the night is longer, I'll sit and talk with
you awhile. We'll walk up Alvarado Row,
just you and I and all of our ghosts and
memories and shades ambling along with
us.
I've been wondering about this lately,
turning a few thoughts over in my mind.
And I've begun to watch people as I walk
about campus on my way to class. Some

times I see one of you passing through the
arches of the Oval and disappearing
around a corner, and I think I can practi
cally see your ghosts leaning their weight
into your shoulders. I wonder what they're
saying to you, or if you're just walking
together and silently remembering. And
other times I'll see you whizzing through
White Plaza on your ten-speed, all your
gods hanging onto your arms and swinging
in the breeze. Every so often, if I'm lucky, I
catch you sitting by yourself at Tresidder,
reading or eating or letting the day pass. It
is then that I think you must be lost and
easy in the world of your mind.
Your gods and ghosts have kept you
company were a child, and the
older you get the more you have. You are
Viot always aware'of them, because when
you are in large groups they seem to just
slip into the crowd. You might feel their
presence most when alone: on long car
rides, during rain storms, on evening
walks. Most often they are not the parts
of you that you share when first meeting
a person, and only after you begin to
trust them do you slowly let your gods
and ghosts talk a little louder and say a
little more.
There are times, of course, when they
say too much. They have a knack of want
ing to whisper to you during class, or
while you are poring over your texts, or
frantically trying to cram for an exam.

They are the ones that have been occupy
ing your mind when you reach the bot
tom of a page and realize you can't recall
anything you've just read. They're the
ones that draw your attention away from
a particularly boring person on the tele
phone, causing your face to flush when,
after a long winded monologue, he asks
"What do you think?" Your gods and
ghosts are mischievous and crafty, but
they are always on your side.
Perhaps that is why they are so impor
tant. They keep you company when you
are lonely, chide whomever you are angry
with, and are sometimes the only onÂ£s
who can make you smile when the day is
slow and dreary. They come in all sorts of
forms, and remind you of all the people,
places and experiences that are deep into
you. And though they sometimes can
make you sad when they remind you of
those whom you have lost along the way,
their sadness is also a kind of light. Final
ly, when night comes on and you are
waiting for the arrival of sleep, they will
sit quietly and watch over you. They tell
you to have dreams of gold. And you do.

Nicole says this is for a night of imita
tions and ghosts.
