## Daily's printing of ad demonstrates poor judgment 
### 
A BRIEF reading of the editor's note
book "A Responsibility to print
untruths? A newspaper's dilemma"
was all it took to disgust us.
As editor of The Daily, Rajiv Chan
drasekaran is neither willing to brave
"protests from students, faculty and [ hisj
own editorial board," nor is he coura
geous enough to refuse to publish it. He
chose to run the advertisement attached
to an editorial condemning its contents.
There were other options. He could
have obscured the content of the ad, and
mentioned in the editorial that anyone
interested could go to The Daily's office
to read its contents. An editorial explain
ing the situation, without any sight of the
ad, would have served essentially the
same avowed purpose. Instead, he chose a
murky middle path â€” free publication of
the advertisement.
Chandrasekaran made the issue not
one of the Holocaust, but of his own per
sonal ethical dilemma. While it is an
engrossing moral debate, the issue of
whether to print the advertisement
obscures the real issue of continuing anti-
Semitism and Holocaust revisionism. He

never answers the advertisement. The
Holocaust occurred, and millions of Jews,
gypsies, homosexuals and other "undesir
ables" were killed. If someone approached
Chandrasekaran and stated that the
Holocaust didn't happen, would he be
able to respond? Perhaps, but he chooses
not to in this space.
Chandrasekaran simply assumes that
the Stanford community will recognize
the insanity of the advertisement. It is
both dangerous and blatantly incorrect to
assert blindly that "at Stanford, it is
unlikely that printing a portion of the ad
will win any new followers for Mr.
Smith's cause." How quickly we forget
the incidents in Ujamaa and Otero, and
the regular vandalism of the Gay Libera
tion statue near the Physics Tank.
An even more appalling aspect of the
editorial, however, is the desire to encour
age a completely open discussion of the
Holocaust. Chandrasekaran writes, "To
deny the Holocaust may be abhorrent, but
to require that it be discussed within cer
tain limits may do a greater injustice to
the memory of its victims and humankind
in general." How did The Daily decide

that the very existence of the Holocaust is
open for discussion? A limit on Holocaust
discussions to the extent that all agree
that it occurred seems not only reason
able, but morally unassailable. Would
Chandrasekaran permit a discussion of
slavery to include a debate on its occur
rence? Of course not, but that is the door
he leaves open with his editorial.
Chandrasekaran also contradicts him
self. "If we knowingly print historical lies,
that bond is violated." Can he explain
precisely how the inclusion of this ad in
an editorial doesn't constitute the print
ing of a historical lie? Does the editorial
refusal to accept money mean that the ad
is not "printed," but merely seen by thou
sands of readers? The linguistical distinc
tion is not nearly as important as the free
publication of the ad.
Chandrasekaran explains his actions
by stating, "For those reasons, I have
refused to publish the advertisement in
The Daily. We cannot promulgate such
debate and accept money for the promo
tion of what amounts to hatred, absurdi
ty and factual error." No, he did some
thing even worse. He didn't take Smith's

money, but he did "promulgate such
debate." Both by printing the ad, and
then by obscuring the issue of the anti-
Semitism that created the ad, he has pro
vided a free forum for Smith.
The editorial did serve one purpose. It
reminded us of the tendency of the media
to attempt to neutrally mediate issues,
rather than admit their subjectivity and
delve into the solution. David Wyman
provides an excellent analysis of the
media's complicity in the Holocaust in his
book "The Abandonment of the Jews."
Perhaps Chandrasekaran has some read
ing to do himself.
Of course, in Chandrasekaran's words,
not including the ad would not prevent
Smith from expressing his views. "He can
make thousands of handbills and dis
tribute them throughout campus." The
appalling truth is that he doesn't need to.
The Daily has done it for him.
