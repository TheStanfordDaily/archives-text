# Combine processes of voting, fee refunding
## 
### 
I've been a student at Stanford for
five years now, and every year I end up
taking a significant (but selective) fee
refund However, unlike many stu
dents, I also vote each year and I always
vote against those groups which I am
planning to refund the following year.
One of the major problems with the
current fee refund process is that many
students will vote for a student group,
only to take a fee refund the following
year. I think that a good way to modify
the fee refund process is simply to com
bine the voting and fee refund processes.
Student groups, when making a

request for a special fee on the spring
ballot, would make a request as a dollar
amount per student. Each student vot
ing would then decide whether to sup
port the group (and give them that
money the following year), or not (and
hence not give them that money the fol
lowing year). Students who didn't vote
(as has been the practice before this
year) would not be entitled to fee
refunds. This would also address con
cerns of the Graduate Tea Party. Gradu
ate Senator Neil Crellin states in the
Oct. 26 Daily, "The [fee refund! process
relies on the ignorance of the majority to
raise the funds." Ignorance of the fee
refund process might be one thing, but of
the voting process? Surely that could not
be an acceptable argument.
Further, combining the voting and

fee refund process would make things
easier from a bureaucratic standpoint.
Each student group would know almost
exactly how much money they would be
getting before the school year started. I
say almost because students who could
not vote in the spring election (i.e. new
students) would have to be allowed to
make their voices heard at the beginning
of the year.
This way, student groups could plan
their budgets before the school year
began and wouldn't have to deal with
the problem of having their budget sud
denly change drastically a month into
the quarter. Furthermore, the ASSU
wouldn't have to issue checks each quar
ter for people who collected a fee refund.
Instead they could just collect the total
amount of money from each student

that he or she chose to fund each quar
ter.
Some might argue that by requiring
students to fund a group which they vote
for, it would be harder for student
groups to get any funding in the first
place. But if a majority of students do
not want to fund a specific group, and
make it known in the spring elections,
then it only stands to reason that the
group shouldn't be entitled to its special
fee. As the Bridge has shown by its
Annual Spring Faire, there are other
ways for groups to raise money than
through the ASSU.
In short, combining the voting and fee
refunds process is a fairer, more desir
able approach than the existing process.
