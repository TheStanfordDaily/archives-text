# Staff Notebook
## Linda Friedlieb For some, there is no debate about the Holocaust's horrors 
### 
/t is impossible to describe the anguish
and the terror one was subject to
under the Nazis. ... We were haunt
ed constantly to get documents from the
police showing that we had no arrest
records, that we had paid all our taxes,
that we had no debts and others, which I
have forgotten already. . . .
All these documents meant that you
had to stand in lines for many hours.
Sometimes I went, because it was more
safe for me; still Daddy stood in lines,
many times all night long, at times also
to help Peppa whose husband Emil and
brother Leo were in Dachau at the same
time.
My father was pulled out of bed in the
middle of the night to scrub streets on his
hands and knees, so you were never safe
— not even in your own house and
home.
My grandmother penned these
words in a book she and my
grandfather wrote for their
grandchildren sometime in the 1980s —
44 pages full of names of people, emo
tions and events that passed before I was
born.
This "book," bound unobtrusively in a
blue folder, full of typos and handwritten
notes, is the most concrete reason why I
know the Holocaust actually occurred.
Unfortunately, my blue book would
not satisfy the "Committee for Open

Debate on the Holocaust," the group that
submitted an advertisement arguing that
the evidence contained in the U.S. Holo
caust Memorial Museum is fraudulent.
Basically, the group — no matter what
they pretend to say — argues that the
Holocaust never occurred.
To my blue book, they would respond
that old people's memories are faulty,
that my grandparents did not know what
was really going on around them. Where
are your Jewish bodies? Where are the
numbers tattooed in your skin? Where is
your human soap?
My grandparents were lucky. They
escaped Hitler's Austria with their lives
and their sanity. Their skin was not made
into lampshades. And they were able to
help other members of their family
escape the terror of the Nazis and come
to the United States.
The unlucky ones are the bodies, the
ones buried in unmarked graves, the rel
atives whose children will never be born,
the ones who leave no trace of their exis
tence except in the memories of survivors
— the ones whose lives cannot be chroni
cled in a museum because no one cares to
remember them.
And those who forget history are
doomed to repeat it.
It doesn't shock me that an anti-
Semitic group exists that is trying to dis
prove the existence of the Holocaust.
When I first read the advertisement, it

made me physically ill — but it didn't
surprise me. What scares me is the num
ber of people who believe the concept
behind the ad. How can 22 percent of the
American public not believe in the event
that almost wiped out my family?
Perhaps Americans don't believe in
the horrors of the past for the same rea
son German Jews didn't believe in their
own dismal future. When my grandpar
ents honeymooned in Italy in 1937,
Hitler was in power but that didn't scare
the German Jews they met:
To our great surprise, there were a
large number of Jewish vacationers in
Venice at the same time .... They had a
great time, did a lot of shopping and
spent a lot of money and when the vaca
tion was over, they did not mind to go
back to Germany....
They told us that the economy was get
ting better all the time and their busi
nesses were doing well. They felt that
Hitler and his henchmen used the Jews
only as a steppingstone to get elected and
that after a while the Nazis would let up
with their anti-Semitic policy and would
leave the Jews alone.
That certainly was wishful thinking.
In the following years I could not help but
wonder how many of these returning
vacationers ended up in concentration
camps and gas chambers.
To this day there are many friends and
family members whose whereabouts

remain unknown to my family. We
assume they are dead; Hitler left us no
choice.
And even those that are alive are scat
tered, thrown about the globe so that I
may never know them. This, too, is the
Nazis' legacy to me.
Yet sometimes there are miracles.
When I was about 10 or 11, my father
received a phone call from a man who
asked him if he was related to Walter
Friedlieb. When my father replied that
Walter was his father, we were intro
duced to Otto Weinburger — a man we
thought the Nazis had killed. In the 40
years since World War II ended, "Uncle
Otto" had been making a new life for
himself in Australia, believing that he
was the sole surviving member of his
family.
Uncle Otto attended my Bat Mitzvah
and was one of the most fascinating peo
ple I have met. He died just a few years
later, lucky to have found a piece of his
family. But for every Uncle Otto, there
are thousands of unmarked graves.
However, I keep coming back to the
people who can't, don't or won't remem
ber. Some find the memories too painful.
Some just cannot believe that people let
such horrors occur without a cry of
protest. Some feel their own guilt for not
believing or taking action while the Nazis
were running their death camps.
And others find it easier to just deny

the truth.
These are my facts: The Nazis di<i
exist, they were white supremaci ts, 11
did kill millions of Jews and
other "undesirables;" they .-til! exi ,
they will kill "undesirables again i ( f 111
have the opportunity Forgetting giv
them that chance.
The truth is not just the object -tl t
can be touched and examined and put
a museum. Often the truth is what <■ >
know on faith, what you know in yo
heart. It is not the dead bodies; it is t
stories of their lives.
Well, the "l()th of November starts
in ike morning with a phone call from /
aunt, Uncle Philip's wife, and sh
warned us not to go out into tin street A
men under the age of HO were stopped u/
arrested, loaded on cattle trucks and cat
ed away. These trucks took them to lit
railroad station and the next stop was
one of the concentration camp* and /
the most of them, the beginning of I
end. . . .
Frankly we never took a count h<
many of our relatives and friends wet

However, I keep coming back to the
people who can't, don't or won't remem
ber. Some find the memories too painful.
Some just cannot believe that people let
such horrors occur without a cry of
protest. Some feel their own guilt for not
believing or taking action while the Nazis
were running their death camps.
And others find it easier to just deny

the truth.
These are my facts: The Nazis di<i
exist, they were white supremaci ts, 11
did kill millions of Jews and

they will kill "undesirables again i ( f 111

The truth is not just the object -tl t

know on faith, what you know in yo

Well, the "l()th of November starts
in ike morning with a phone call from /
aunt, Uncle Philip's wife, and sh
warned us not to go out into tin street A
men under the age of HO were stopped u/
arrested, loaded on cattle trucks and cat

railroad station and the next stop was
one of the concentration camp* and /
the most of them, the beginning of I

/t is impossible to describe the anguish
and the terror one was subject to
under the Nazis. ... We were haunt
ed constantly to get documents from the
police showing that we had no arrest
records, that we had paid all our taxes,
that we had no debts and others, which I
have forgotten already. . . .
All these documents meant that you
had to stand in lines for many hours.
Sometimes I went, because it was more
safe for me; still Daddy stood in lines,
many times all night long, at times also
to help Peppa whose husband Emil and
brother Leo were in Dachau at the same
time.
My father was pulled out of bed in the
middle of the night to scrub streets on his
hands and knees, so you were never safe
— not even in your own house and
home.
My grandmother penned these
words in a book she and my
grandfather wrote for their
grandchildren sometime in the 1980s —
44 pages full of names of people, emo
tions and events that passed before I was
born.
This "book," bound unobtrusively in a
blue folder, full of typos and handwritten
notes, is the most concrete reason why I
know the Holocaust actually occurred.
Unfortunately, my blue book would
not satisfy the "Committee for Open

Debate on the Holocaust," the group that
submitted an advertisement arguing that
the evidence contained in the U.S. Holo
caust Memorial Museum is fraudulent.
Basically, the group — no matter what
they pretend to say — argues that the
Holocaust never occurred.
To my blue book, they would respond
that old people's memories are faulty,
that my grandparents did not know what
was really going on around them. Where
are your Jewish bodies? Where are the
numbers tattooed in your skin? Where is
your human soap?
My grandparents were lucky. They
escaped Hitler's Austria with their lives
and their sanity. Their skin was not made
into lampshades. And they were able to
help other members of their family
escape the terror of the Nazis and come
to the United States.
The unlucky ones are the bodies, the
ones buried in unmarked graves, the rel
atives whose children will never be born,
the ones who leave no trace of their exis
tence except in the memories of survivors
— the ones whose lives cannot be chroni
cled in a museum because no one cares to
remember them.
And those who forget history are
doomed to repeat it.
It doesn't shock me that an anti-
Semitic group exists that is trying to dis
prove the existence of the Holocaust.
When I first read the advertisement, it

made me physically ill — but it didn't
surprise me. What scares me is the num
ber of people who believe the concept
behind the ad. How can 22 percent of the
American public not believe in the event
that almost wiped out my family?
Perhaps Americans don't believe in
the horrors of the past for the same rea
son German Jews didn't believe in their
own dismal future. When my grandpar
ents honeymooned in Italy in 1937,
Hitler was in power but that didn't scare
the German Jews they met:
To our great surprise, there were a
large number of Jewish vacationers in
Venice at the same time .... They had a
great time, did a lot of shopping and
spent a lot of money and when the vaca
tion was over, they did not mind to go
back to Germany....
They told us that the economy was get
ting better all the time and their busi
nesses were doing well. They felt that
Hitler and his henchmen used the Jews
only as a steppingstone to get elected and
that after a while the Nazis would let up
with their anti-Semitic policy and would
leave the Jews alone.
That certainly was wishful thinking.
In the following years I could not help but
wonder how many of these returning
vacationers ended up in concentration
camps and gas chambers.
To this day there are many friends and
family members whose whereabouts

remain unknown to my family. We
assume they are dead; Hitler left us no
choice.
And even those that are alive are scat
tered, thrown about the globe so that I
may never know them. This, too, is the
Nazis' legacy to me.
Yet sometimes there are miracles.
When I was about 10 or 11, my father
received a phone call from a man who
asked him if he was related to Walter
Friedlieb. When my father replied that
Walter was his father, we were intro
duced to Otto Weinburger — a man we
thought the Nazis had killed. In the 40
years since World War II ended, "Uncle
Otto" had been making a new life for
himself in Australia, believing that he
was the sole surviving member of his
family.
Uncle Otto attended my Bat Mitzvah
and was one of the most fascinating peo
ple I have met. He died just a few years
later, lucky to have found a piece of his
family. But for every Uncle Otto, there
are thousands of unmarked graves.
However, I keep coming back to the
people who can't, don't or won't remem
ber. Some find the memories too painful.
Some just cannot believe that people let
