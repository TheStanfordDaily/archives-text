## Stress stalls sex hormones, causes brain damage 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
While stress can keep you up at
night, make you lose your
appetite and increase your irri
tability, it can also contribute to
other more serious ailments
which may give you yet another
reason to stress.
According to Asst. Biology
Prof. Robert Sapolsky, a stress
researcher, long-term stress may
lead to effects as serious as per
manent brain damage, especially
in strokes and seizures, which
themselves are often triggered by
stress.
"Five minutes (of stress) is
fine," said Sapolsky, whose
research group is the first to con
cretely link stress to brain dam
age.
"But when five minutes
become five weeks and ... five
months, that's when real damage
is done."
The origin of stress
Sapolsky describes stress as a
tool nature gave organisms to
help evade potentially dangerous
situations.
"Suppose you're being chased
by a predator in the jungle,"
begins the analogy he used to
explain the origin of stress. At
that point, your body changes
gears and prepares you for a swift
dash.
The body responds to stress by
producing hormones to help it
withstand an upset of its natural
balance. And while in most organ
isms, imbalances are brought
about by changes in physical envi
ronment, such as being chased by
a predator or being injured,

humans can also induce stress
psychologically.
About 80 percent of the body's
stress responses is induced by two
hormones: adrenaline and gluco
corticoids.
Adrenaline helps in drawing
out fat from fat cells to give your
muscles energy and by making
your heart beat faster so more
oxygen is brought into the blood
stream.
Glucocorticoids serve to mobi
lize energy and temporarily turn
off long-term body processes, to
let the body focus on the danger at
hand.
Over long periods, stress hor
mones such as these can cause
high blood pressure, damage
blood vessels and lead to cardio
vascular diseases. Stroke and
brain damage may also result
from long-term stress. \
"(Stress) makes sense when
you're . . . running away from
lions for three minutes, but not
when you do it (for) three months
worrying about the MCATs,"
Sapolsky said.
Glucocorticoids released
throughout chronic stress can
delay the body's long-term pro
jects significantly: growth slows
down, sexual hormones are not
produced as much, causing impo
tency, and mucous is not manu
factured to line the stomach,
allowing ulcers to form.
Brain damage
In addition to long-term body
processes, glucocorticoids also
slow down the energy transferred
to the brain.
The body can usually cope with
this reduced energy. But when
stress is accompanied by a stroke

or seizure, the process of brain
cell destruction begins.
At the cellular level, glucocorti
coids reduce the energy intake of
cells located in learning and mem
ory centers of the brain by 25 per
cent.
Because of this, cells lack the
strength to get rid of calcium ions,
which are periodically released
from one brain cell to relay infor-

Th e
calcium

buildup
reaches the point of becoming
toxic and "chops the cell into
pieces," Sapolsky said. Holes form
in the cell membrane and the
cell's skeletal structure rips apart.
One cell after another falls
prey to this self-destruction in
what scientists call the "cascade"
effect, and the net result is brain
damage.
Sapolsky and others in
research group are also looking

into the possibility that gluco
corticoid shots, given to AIDS
patients to curb pneumonia,
cause the same kind of brain
damage.
Currently one half of all AIDS
patients become what is termed
as "demented" and incur severe
memory loss and disorientation,
he said.
Cures
Since much of the research in
stress-related brain damage is so
recent, little can be done in ways

cur
ing or
halting

the loss of brain cells.
In the meantime, Sapolsky
and his researchers are taking
into account a number of factors
that appear to help reduce stress.
Studies show that patients
about to undergo surgery and
under severe stress can be
calmed to a large extent by sim
ply holding the hand of one they
love.
Such factors are noteworthy

because that would mean that as
much as psychologically-induced

stress can endanger one s health,
much can be done to alleviate
that stress by thinking positively.
This positive approach, Sapol
sky contends, can reduce harm
ful stress side effects just as easi
ly as they are induced.
Sapolsky also spends two
months a year in Africa studying
baboons. His goal there has been
to find out how some some of the
animals succeed in keeping their
stress levels low, despite clashes
within the hierarchical structure
of the primates.

Brain damage
In addition to long-term body
processes, glucocorticoids also
slow down the energy transferred
to the brain.
The body can usually cope with
this reduced energy. But when
stress is accompanied by a stroke

or seizure, the process of brain
cell destruction begins.
At the cellular level, glucocorti
coids reduce the energy intake of
cells located in learning and mem
ory centers of the brain by 25 per
cent.
Because of this, cells lack the
strength to get rid of calcium ions,
which are periodically released
from one brain cell to relay infor-

buildup
reaches the point of becoming
toxic and "chops the cell into
pieces," Sapolsky said. Holes form
in the cell membrane and the
cell's skeletal structure rips apart.
One cell after another falls
prey to this self-destruction in
what scientists call the "cascade"
effect, and the net result is brain
damage.
Sapolsky and others in
research group are also looking

into the possibility that gluco
corticoid shots, given to AIDS
patients to curb pneumonia,
cause the same kind of brain
damage.
Currently one half of all AIDS
patients become what is termed
as "demented" and incur severe
memory loss and disorientation,
he said.
Cures
Since much of the research in
stress-related brain damage is so
recent, little can be done in ways

cur
ing or
halting

the loss of brain cells.
In the meantime, Sapolsky
and his researchers are taking
into account a number of factors
that appear to help reduce stress.
Studies show that patients
about to undergo surgery and
under severe stress can be
calmed to a large extent by sim
ply holding the hand of one they
love.
Such factors are noteworthy

because that would mean that as
much as psychologically-induced

stress can endanger one s health,
much can be done to alleviate
that stress by thinking positively.
This positive approach, Sapol
sky contends, can reduce harm
ful stress side effects just as easi
ly as they are induced.
Sapolsky also spends two
months a year in Africa studying
baboons. His goal there has been
to find out how some some of the
animals succeed in keeping their
stress levels low, despite clashes
within the hierarchical structure
of the primates.

While stress can keep you up at
night, make you lose your
appetite and increase your irri
tability, it can also contribute to
other more serious ailments
which may give you yet another
reason to stress.
According to Asst. Biology
Prof. Robert Sapolsky, a stress
researcher, long-term stress may
lead to effects as serious as per
manent brain damage, especially
in strokes and seizures, which
themselves are often triggered by
stress.
"Five minutes (of stress) is
fine," said Sapolsky, whose
research group is the first to con
cretely link stress to brain dam
age.
"But when five minutes
become five weeks and ... five
months, that's when real damage
is done."
The origin of stress
Sapolsky describes stress as a
tool nature gave organisms to
help evade potentially dangerous
situations.
"Suppose you're being chased
by a predator in the jungle,"
begins the analogy he used to
explain the origin of stress. At
that point, your body changes
gears and prepares you for a swift
dash.
The body responds to stress by
producing hormones to help it
withstand an upset of its natural
balance. And while in most organ
isms, imbalances are brought
about by changes in physical envi
ronment, such as being chased by
a predator or being injured,

humans can also induce stress
psychologically.
About 80 percent of the body's
stress responses is induced by two
hormones: adrenaline and gluco
corticoids.
Adrenaline helps in drawing
out fat from fat cells to give your
muscles energy and by making
your heart beat faster so more
oxygen is brought into the blood
stream.
Glucocorticoids serve to mobi
lize energy and temporarily turn
off long-term body processes, to
let the body focus on the danger at
hand.
Over long periods, stress hor
mones such as these can cause
high blood pressure, damage
blood vessels and lead to cardio
vascular diseases. Stroke and
brain damage may also result
from long-term stress. \
"(Stress) makes sense when
you're . . . running away from
lions for three minutes, but not
when you do it (for) three months
worrying about the MCATs,"
Sapolsky said.
Glucocorticoids released
throughout chronic stress can
delay the body's long-term pro
jects significantly: growth slows
down, sexual hormones are not
produced as much, causing impo
tency, and mucous is not manu
factured to line the stomach,
allowing ulcers to form.
