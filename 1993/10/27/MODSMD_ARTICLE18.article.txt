# X-rays target enzyme atoms
## Better medicines, soil fertilizer key benefits

Paving the way for everything from bet
ter medicines to more effective fertilizer,
Chemistry Prof. Keith Hodgson has devel
oped an imaging technique to observe how
enzymes do their work.
Using X-ray beams harvested from a
storage ring at Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, Hodgson has succeeded in imaging
in detail metal atoms in the active sites of
enzymes, the proteins that catalyze virtual
ly every organic reaction.
By studying how active sites facilitate a
reaction, scientists may someday be able to
understand how to make everything from
more effective drugs to less expensive fer
tilizer.
In spite of their importance, enzymes are
hard to study because they are so massive
compared to their individual parts such as
the metal atoms and amino acids contained
in the active site.
Prof. Arthur Kornberg, a Nobel laureate
and Stanford enzymologist, said that Hodg
son's work will aid the scientific communi
ty by probing into the key parts of enzymes,
which exist in such small dimensions.
Kornberg added, "We are reassured by
looking at [enzymes] in a different way."
New use of X-rays
Previously, scientists used X-ray crystal
lography to look at proteins, including
enzymes.
However, this method showed every sin
gle atom in the protein, making it nearly
impossible to identify the enzyme's most
important part, its active site.
In addition, the protein had to be in a
hard-to-make crystal form in which the
mechanics of enzyme activity were hid
den.
Hodgson and his group have found a new
way to use X-rays to cut through the maze
of amino acids and focus on the active site,
especially on the metal atoms found there.
The technique, X-ray absorbance spec
troscopy (XAS), uses a protein in solution
rather than crystalline form. This one
change enables researchers to view the
active site both before and after it has cat
alyzed a reaction, which they were not able
to do before.
Hodgson has also been able to detect
what a reaction is doing to a metal atom,
and effectively "look directly at the active
site."
Metal atoms have heavy nuclei sur
rounded by a cloud of electrons that
respond to subtle changes in the neighbor
ing atoms' electronic states.
So how do the researchers zero in on the
active site?
For something so tiny, it seems ironic
that they would need something as big as
SLAC to find the answer.
Hodgson and his group harvest X-ray
beams from a circular storage ring at
SLAC, select the beam frequency by "puri
fying" it with prisms, and shine the beam
into a solution of a protein sample.
By selecting the beam energy, Hodgson
and his coworkers can target a specific

metal atom in the enzyme.
Like waves in a pond
When the metal atom is bombarded with
the SLAC X-ray beam, one of the electrons
surrounding it is propelled out of the atom
in the form of a wave, producing an effect
similar to that caused by dropping a pebble
in a pond.
And as with the pond, the waves go prop
agating out from their source, hitting
objects that stand in their way â€” in this
case, other metal atoms.
The interaction of waves between differ
ent atoms offers a clue as to what is really
going on.
Rebounding waves are scattered, causing
interference between the outgoing and
backscattered free-flying electron, accord
ing to Hodgson.
"The analysis of the frequency of the
pattern gives you very accurately the dis
tance (between metal atoms]," he added.
And while the free-flying electron is not
visible, the effects it has on other particles
are.
By observing the waves, researchers can
find out where the wave source and reflect
ing objects must be.
Of course, Hodgson can't directly look at
the pattern of waves and reflections.
Instead, his detector picks up the huge jum
ble of wave frequencies and separates them
into their component waves, much like sep
arating a piece of music into its pure tones.
The detector uses Fourier transform
analysis and numerical curve-fitting tech
niques, which, according to Hodgson, "pro
vides distance information out to better
than five angstroms (50 billionths of a
meter) around the absorbing metal." By
this method, Hodgson has been able to
study long-range organization in the metal
atoms at active sites.
In addition, numerical analysis can also
help researchers determine the angles
between atoms.
What Hodgson has done, then, is to
reconstruct the metal atom configuration
at the active site within the huge enzyme
protein.

"We can determine very accurately what
is happening" as a result of the reaction
being catalyzed, said Hodgson.
Hodgson said the next step in his
research is to trap an enzyme in the act of
catalyzing a reaction, and to look at it while
its active site is occupied.
Turning research into reality
Application of Hodgson's work in other
scientific areas also looks promising.
According to Kornberg, gaining insight into
enzyme active sites is "essential to under
standing how drugs work" and also helping
scientists develop "a basic understanding of
the operations of a cell."
Hodgson has worked extensively with
nitrogenase, the enzyme responsible for
nitrogen fixation in soil microorganisms
and some plants.
Currently, this process is artificially repro
duced in fertilizer production, requiring huge
amounts of energy and high temperature. "If
one could understand this chemistry in a bio
logical organism," said Hodgson, "one could
potentially find ways of doing this much more
efficiently and cheaply."
Another enzyme, methane mono-oxyge
tiase is known for its ability to convert
hydrocarbons such as gasoline into alco
hols.
Hodgson noted that if this process could
be understood and duplicated, we "might
have a way of improving bioremediation,"
the process of detoxifying hazardous mate
rials and pollutants.
A 1 so, because XAS "allows you to study
any metal atom in any environment" of
electrons, scientists can potentially get
information about the electronic and geo
metric structure of radioactive materials,
and formulate more efficient methods of
extracting or compacting nuclear waste.
From nuclear waste to pharmaceuticals to
enzyme physics, Hodgson's technique of X
ray absorbance spectroscopy promises to pro
vide important insight into the basic chemi
cal reactions that govern all forms of life.
Kornberg sees the future as a time when
Hodgson's work may have "consequences
we can't even imagine."
