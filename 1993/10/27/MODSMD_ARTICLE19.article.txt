# Bug drools over saliva quandary

Why do we drool ?
A: I think that a better way
to put that question, my
anonymous Seeker of Truth,
would be, "Why do I drool 9 " —
in this case, "I" being you.
Crankiness aside, let's talk
spit.
Presumably, the average
reader already knows a fair
amount about the justification
for saliva per se, and might wish
for me to jump immediately into
excess saliva (that is to say, the
subject, rather than the thing
itself).

I rarely fail
to vex and
disappoint
my faithful
readers; how
ever, I will
gloss over the
basics of
everyday
salivation
before diving
into drool.

(Again, of course, I speak figura
tively.)
Saliva, or "spit," or "spittle,"
(or, for that matter, "big green
honking phlegm biscuits") is
your mouth's way of making life
easier on the immediately lower
portions of your digestive tract.
It moistens and softens food,
lubricates food's passage to the
stomach via the esophagus, and
even begins digestion of starch
es before the food even leaves
the mouth.
The mechanical functions of
saliva — moistening, softening
and (ooh!) lubricating — are
made possible by a grant from
Chevron, and by mucin, a
starch-like molecule which hap
pens to be very good at absorb
ing water. Moisture-swollen
mucin acts as your mouth's own
personal lubricant, preventing
friction and erosion of tissue
when you force foreign objects
(like Bar-B-Q Corn Nuts™) into
your oral cavity.
The digestive functions of
saliva are performed primarily
by the enzymes maltase and
alpha-amylase. Together, these
enzymes go a long way toward
breaking down long starchy
polysaccharide chains into sim
ple sugars that the cells of your
body can use more easily.
Unless you've had oral radio
therapy, or you walk around

with one of those dental vacu
ums stuck between cheek and
gum, you always have some sali
va in your mouth. In healthy
people, saliva levels increase
over baseline at fairly reason
able times: e.g., when you smell,
see, taste or think about food.
When you add up the baseline
and food-related secretion of
saliva, a single mouth produces
about 750 milliliters (about 3/4
quart) over an average day.
But some unfortunate peo
ple's saliva levels are abnormal
ly high even when they aren't
thinking about food. When this
excess saliva actually dribbles
from their mouths into the local
environment (say, a pillow, or
your boyfriend's hair), these

individuals are
said to "drool."
Drooling hap

one at some
point or anoth

most reasonable explanation for
most nocturnal drooling is
mechanical: You forget to close
your mouth. Saliva leaks out.
Your mouth dries up. and
makes more saliva to compen
sate. Repeat. Saliva forms a
clammy pool that slowly
envelops one side of your head.
You awaken to find that during
the night your significant other
has left you to drown in your
own spittle.
Factors that exacerbate drool
ing during sleep — minor inflam
mation of the mouth, mild indi
gestion and use of certain over
the-counter medications — can
result in excess, uncontrollable
salivation during waking hours if
the factors are chronic. For
instance, ulcer patients ar»>
among the most conspicuous
droolers of all. as are teething
infants and adults who have
undergone dental surgery.
More unusual and pathologi
cal causes of drooling include
mercury poisoning, pregnancy,
alcoholism and malnutrition

ums stuck between cheek and
gum, you always have some sali
va in your mouth. In healthy
people, saliva levels increase
over baseline at fairly reason
able times: e.g., when you smell,
see, taste or think about food.
When you add up the baseline
and food-related secretion of
saliva, a single mouth produces
about 750 milliliters (about 3/4
quart) over an average day.
But some unfortunate peo
ple's saliva levels are abnormal
ly high even when they aren't
thinking about food. When this
excess saliva actually dribbles
from their mouths into the local
environment (say, a pillow, or
your boyfriend's hair), these

individuals are
said to "drool."
Drooling hap
pens to every
one at some
point or anoth
er. The exam

most reasonable explanation for
most nocturnal drooling is
mechanical: You forget to close
your mouth. Saliva leaks out.
Your mouth dries up. and
makes more saliva to compen
sate. Repeat. Saliva forms a
clammy pool that slowly
envelops one side of your head.
You awaken to find that during
the night your significant other
has left you to drown in your
own spittle.
Factors that exacerbate drool
ing during sleep — minor inflam
mation of the mouth, mild indi
gestion and use of certain over
the-counter medications — can
result in excess, uncontrollable
salivation during waking hours if
the factors are chronic. For
instance, ulcer patients ar»>
among the most conspicuous
droolers of all. as are teething
infants and adults who have
undergone dental surgery.
More unusual and pathologi
cal causes of drooling include
mercury poisoning, pregnancy,
alcoholism and malnutrition
Certain forms of mental retar
dation are also strongly associ
ated with excess salivation.
