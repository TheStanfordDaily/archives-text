## The
						Wallin brothers — a mixture of blood and water 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
In recent years, faithful Stanford water
polo fans have grown accustomed to seeing
a WaJlin in the pool.
In 1990, coach Dante Dettamanti and his
Cardinal squad found that two Wallins were
better than one as Mark, a senior, teamed
with brother Chris, a freshman. This year is
more of the same as Chris, now a senior, is
joined by freshman Brian.
"All three of the Wallins are excellent

water polo players," said Dettamanti. "They
come from Sanger [Calif.] High School
where they've dominated water polo for
nine or 10 years. They've helped make
Sanger one of the better teams in the val
ley."
This season, Chris and Brian are helping
Stanford (15-3, 2-1 in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) maintain their position
as the top team in the country. They have
proved to be quite a combination on offense,
scoring goals in the same game in nine of
the Cardinal's 18 matches. In a game

against UCLA earlier this month the two
combined for six goals, with Chris scoring
four and Brian two, to lead Stanford to a 13-
8 drubbing of the Bruins.
Chris, the team's offensive captain, has
been remarkably consistent for the past two
seasons, netting goals in 21 of Stanford's 28
games last year to finish second on the team
in scoring. He has been shut out of-the scor
ing column only twice this year, scoring 28
goals in all, the third-highest total for the
Cardinal.
Brian has been an offensive threat as
well, striking for 17 goals, which is good for
fifth on the team.
Although Dettamanti says that each of
the three brothers has been very unique,
their beginnings in the sport and the pro
gressions of their careers are similar.
The Wallins all began their aquatic
careers at a young age as members of a com
petitive swim club. When Mark entered
high school, he went out for the water polo
team. His younger brothers followed his
lead and each eventually earned high-school
Ail-American honors.
They all participated on Sanger's varsity
swim team, and Chris was named All-Amer
ican in that sport as well. Brian was also a
starter on the school's basketball team.
Chris and Brian have played together as
teammates before, when Chris was a senior
and Brian a freshman in high school. Both
said that playing alongside the other does
not make any difference in a game; they are
simply teammates.
"It doesn't really come into play," Brian
said. "We're kind of alike, but we play dif
ferent positions."
Chris agreed, "I'm more of a driver,
while he's a holeman. It works well, with
the driver/holeman relationship. Some
times he gives me a look, like for passes. I
can tell when Brian wants the ball."
In the Cardinal's first meeting with Cal

ifornia at the beginning of October, it was
Chris giving Brian a look, as Brian put a
pass right on his brother's hand which
Chris turned into a Stanford score. The play
helped Stanford defeat the Golden Bears 6-
4.
Fierce competitors in the pool, the broth
ers often take that attitude home with
them, where they face each other on the
basketball court.
"We're really competitive," Chris said.
"Growing up, we did everything against
each other."
"We're still like that," Brian added. "We
mostly play basketball.... I'm sure we'll
end up out there when we go back home for
Christmas break."
When asked who usually gets the better
of the other on the courts, the youngest
Wallin was hesitant.
"I don't think I should answer that — I
don't want to make Chris mad," he replied.
That competitiveness is one of the simi
larities Dettamanti sees in the Wallin broth
ers. Another is tenacity around the net.
"All three of them are completely differ
ent players," Dettamanti said. "One simi
larity is that they all have great moves in
front of the goal. We call it (these moves!
WaUy's World."
Dettamanti also mentioned the confu
sion created by having brothers in the pool
at the same time.
"The hardest part has been giving them
each names," he said. "When Mark got here,
he was called 'Wally.' Then Chris came
along and we needed a nickname for him, so
we called him 'Junior.' Now with Brian, we
came up with 'Fee-Wee,' which is partly a
joke, since he is the biggest of the three."
Dettamanti has been impressed by Pee-
Wee's adjustment to the collegiate level.
"Brian is an important part, of our varsi
ty team," Dettamanti said. "He's the only
freshman on the varsity, and he's one of the

first subs ofT the bench. He really has a good
feel for the game.
"We really needed a center-forward aller
graduating Chip Blankenhom and Chris
Smith, and Brian's doing a great job."
Although Chris doesn't quite have the
size of his younger brother, he makes up for
it with blazing speed.
"Each (brother) has been progressively
bigger, and they're all good swimmers,"
Dettamanti said. "But Chris is the fastest —
he's one of the fastest swimmers we've ever
had at Stanford. Chris has really learned to
use his speed in games. Just because you're
fast doesn't mean you know how to use
your speed."
Dettamanti is also pleased with the lead
ership the elder Wallin brings to his squad.
"Chris has really developed into an out
standing player," he said. "I have complete
confidence that I can keep him in for the
entire game. He's still as strong at the end of
a game as he was at the beginning.
Both Chris and Brian have also been
members of the United States National
Youth team (17 and under). While in high
school, Chris traveled to Europe. Brian
competed in Mexico and Canada.
Brian has enjoyed meeting the chal
lenges of each higher level of water polo.
"I learned a lot from Chris in high school
and even before," he said. "When I was a
freshman Chris was 20 times better than
me. Playing against tougher people taught
me a lot, gave me a lot of good experience."
Dettamanti is eager to watch Chris lead
his team to a championship and Brian con
tinue to improve and develop as a player «ind
leader.
"By the time Brian is done, they sill will
have made a tremendous contribution to
our program," he said.
And when Brian is done, the Dettamanti
and the Cardinal will have to deal with the
closing curtain of Wally's World.

By making good use of the ball, the Wallin duo hopes to accomplish something
their older brother never did — win an NCAA championship.
