# Lawn bowling: playing 'old men's marbles' in Palo Alto
## The 						Palo Alto Lawn Bowling Club offers quality bowling for Stanford students and faculty 
### Jonathan Fischer 
O.K. sports fans. It's time to see how much you real
ly know about sports. What game is "more social than
golf ... less strenuous than tennis"? What sport has
been called "one of the most interesting sports ever
devised by the mind of man"?
Give up? Well, the sport in question is lawn bowling.
Few people would have recognized these quotes as per
taining to the ancient activity. But many others, includ
ing the members of the nearby Palo Alto Lawn Bowling
Club (whose flyers contained these comments), consid
er lawn bowling to be a sport filled with strategy and
subtle nuances. In fact, the club is attempting to recruit
new members from the ranks of Stanford students so
that they, too, can participate in the game affectionate
ly referred to as "bowls."
Situated only a half a mile away from the Stanford
campus off Embarcadero Road, the PALBC was found
ed in 1933 and boasts a membership of 120, each of
whom pays a $50 annual fee for unlimited club priv
iledges. The club has the appearance of a small park,
with a hedge surrounding the roughly 10,000-sq.-foot
bowling green, upon which members roll weighted balls
toward a marker in a sport that may roughly be
described as a mixture of curling, bowling and bocci ball.
The club has long had an intriguing connection to
the Stanford campus. Every year the PALBC has its
own version of Big Game where the club competes
against the Berkeley lawn bowling club. And, just as
Stanford has controlled "the Axe" for the past six years,
so too has the PALBC won the coveted "Meat Axe" for
four years running.
As it stands now, the sport is dominated by an older
generation; bowler Jack Broadfield of the San Francis
co Lawn Bowling Club joked that it is "old men's mar
bles" between puffs on his cigar. But Joel Stearn, a
member of the PALBC, said that lawn bowls is "a sport
that needs young people."
However, that is not to deny the sport's popularity
within its currently more limited audience. In fact, the
PALBC recently hosted the Pacific Intermountain Divi
sion singles lawn bowling championship, with represen
tatives from 10 area clubs competing for the title.
Lawn bowling has been around for centuries. It is
played most frequently in the British Commonwealth,

where its popularity is comparable to that of golf in
America. The sport is played on a fmely cut lawn by two
teams made up of one to four players. The teams
attempt to place their unevenly weighted bowls closer to
the "jack" than the other team. The team with the bowl
closest to the jack wins the round, or end as it's called.
The game consists of a predetermined number of ends,
or in a singles game, of a predetermined number of
points.
Much of the game's appeal lies in the difference
among ends. The jack is almost always in a new spot,
and the configuration of the bowls around the jack is
also unique to each end.
This is where strategy comes into play. In most
games as many bowls will be in defensive positions as
will be in position near the jack. A bowler has to deter
mine whether to tiy and place his bowl near the jack or
to try and reposition the jack or the other bowls. An
attempt at placement requires finesse and touch, while
an attempt to move other bowls requires a hard throw
to cut down on the curvature of the bowl.
Learning the game can be as simple as falling asleep
during a CIV lecture. Stearn, who was watching the
action at the PIMD championships, said, "It's so easy to
pick up. It's just a matter of how hard you roll it and
where you roll it. It's a zen sport — finesse and mind."
Nonetheless, one cannot become an expert lawnbowler
overnight. Joe Roberts, the PALBC club pro, said the
game takes a "good deal of muscle coordination and
muscle memory. It involves placement, finesse, power,
feel for the last throw, and memory of the last throw."
Stearn, who has been playing for four years, said,
"It's one of the few sports that you can start now and in
a few years compete with the best of them." He added
that it's one of the few sports in which you can start at
a late age and become a national champion.
While the club is attempting to recruit Stanford stu
dents, it already claims a professor from the Farm as a
member. In fact, Materials Science Prof. Bob Sinclair is
a world-caliber lawn bowler. Prof. Sinclair was brought
up in Britain, where lawn bowling is extremely popular.
He began playing the sport at the age of 11, and now
plays about once a week, as well as in tournaments.
Fred Hawley, one of the spectators at the PIMD cham
pionships in which Sinclair competed, said that Sinclair
is "one of the best in the country. The thing about Sin

clair is that he makes it look so easy." In fact, Sinclair
would likely be on the U.S. National Team if only he
had been born in the United States.
Sinclair echoed the sentiments of others that "if you
are sports-minded you can become fairly skilled fairly
quickly." However, the sport requires "more than
mechanics. There is a lot of strategy involved, as well as

mental conditioning. You have to be able to make the
clutch shot. The sport requires a delicate balance of con
servatism and risk-taking. It is an infinitely interesting
game."
So the next time you're looking to enjoy a nice stogie,
feeling too tired for tennis and too social for golf, don't
say you can't find anywhere to bowl.

muscle memory. It involves placement, finesse, power,
feel for the last throw, and memory of the last throw."
Stearn, who has been playing for four years, said,
"It's one of the few sports that you can start now and in
a few years compete with the best of them." He added
that it's one of the few sports in which you can start at
a late age and become a national champion.
While the club is attempting to recruit Stanford stu
dents, it already claims a professor from the Farm as a
member. In fact, Materials Science Prof. Bob Sinclair is
a world-caliber lawn bowler. Prof. Sinclair was brought
up in Britain, where lawn bowling is extremely popular.
He began playing the sport at the age of 11, and now
plays about once a week, as well as in tournaments.
Fred Hawley, one of the spectators at the PIMD cham
pionships in which Sinclair competed, said that Sinclair
is "one of the best in the country. The thing about Sin

clair is that he makes it look so easy." In fact, Sinclair
would likely be on the U.S. National Team if only he
had been born in the United States.
Sinclair echoed the sentiments of others that "if you
are sports-minded you can become fairly skilled fairly
quickly." However, the sport requires "more than
mechanics. There is a lot of strategy involved, as well as

mental conditioning. You have to be able to make the
clutch shot. The sport requires a delicate balance of con
servatism and risk-taking. It is an infinitely interesting
game."
So the next time you're looking to enjoy a nice stogie,
feeling too tired for tennis and too social for golf, don't
say you can't find anywhere to bowl.

O.K. sports fans. It's time to see how much you real
ly know about sports. What game is "more social than
golf ... less strenuous than tennis"? What sport has
been called "one of the most interesting sports ever
devised by the mind of man"?
Give up? Well, the sport in question is lawn bowling.
Few people would have recognized these quotes as per
taining to the ancient activity. But many others, includ
ing the members of the nearby Palo Alto Lawn Bowling
Club (whose flyers contained these comments), consid
er lawn bowling to be a sport filled with strategy and
subtle nuances. In fact, the club is attempting to recruit
new members from the ranks of Stanford students so
that they, too, can participate in the game affectionate
ly referred to as "bowls."
Situated only a half a mile away from the Stanford
campus off Embarcadero Road, the PALBC was found
ed in 1933 and boasts a membership of 120, each of
whom pays a $50 annual fee for unlimited club priv
iledges. The club has the appearance of a small park,
with a hedge surrounding the roughly 10,000-sq.-foot
bowling green, upon which members roll weighted balls
toward a marker in a sport that may roughly be
described as a mixture of curling, bowling and bocci ball.
The club has long had an intriguing connection to
the Stanford campus. Every year the PALBC has its
own version of Big Game where the club competes
against the Berkeley lawn bowling club. And, just as
Stanford has controlled "the Axe" for the past six years,
so too has the PALBC won the coveted "Meat Axe" for
four years running.
As it stands now, the sport is dominated by an older
generation; bowler Jack Broadfield of the San Francis
co Lawn Bowling Club joked that it is "old men's mar
bles" between puffs on his cigar. But Joel Stearn, a
member of the PALBC, said that lawn bowls is "a sport
that needs young people."
However, that is not to deny the sport's popularity
within its currently more limited audience. In fact, the
PALBC recently hosted the Pacific Intermountain Divi
sion singles lawn bowling championship, with represen
tatives from 10 area clubs competing for the title.
Lawn bowling has been around for centuries. It is
played most frequently in the British Commonwealth,

where its popularity is comparable to that of golf in
America. The sport is played on a fmely cut lawn by two
teams made up of one to four players. The teams
attempt to place their unevenly weighted bowls closer to
the "jack" than the other team. The team with the bowl
closest to the jack wins the round, or end as it's called.
The game consists of a predetermined number of ends,
or in a singles game, of a predetermined number of
points.
Much of the game's appeal lies in the difference
among ends. The jack is almost always in a new spot,
and the configuration of the bowls around the jack is
also unique to each end.
This is where strategy comes into play. In most
games as many bowls will be in defensive positions as
will be in position near the jack. A bowler has to deter
mine whether to tiy and place his bowl near the jack or
to try and reposition the jack or the other bowls. An
attempt at placement requires finesse and touch, while
an attempt to move other bowls requires a hard throw
to cut down on the curvature of the bowl.
Learning the game can be as simple as falling asleep
during a CIV lecture. Stearn, who was watching the
action at the PIMD championships, said, "It's so easy to
pick up. It's just a matter of how hard you roll it and
where you roll it. It's a zen sport — finesse and mind."
Nonetheless, one cannot become an expert lawnbowler
overnight. Joe Roberts, the PALBC club pro, said the
game takes a "good deal of muscle coordination and
muscle memory. It involves placement, finesse, power,
feel for the last throw, and memory of the last throw."
