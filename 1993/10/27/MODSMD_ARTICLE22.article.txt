### Field Hockey 
After a season of highs and lows, Stanford's field
hockey team is poised to attain the highest peak of
them all. Set to play the University of Pacific today
at 2 p.m., the Cardinal is in position to propel itself
into the NCAA Tournament.
But first they must emerge victorious from this
week's games. California has not suffered an in-con
ference loss, while Stanford has dropped two games
to the Golden Bears. To win the division, the Cardi
nal first must take care of business against the
Tigers, then beat California this Saturday and hope
for a Bear loss to UOP the following Tuesday.
Sara Hallock (who has twice as many goals as the
entire Pacific team) will lead Stanford against the
Tigers today in the Cardinal's first home game since
their last meeting with UOP Oct. 2.
"Pacific has been improving all season, but I'm
not worried," said netminder Loretta Hidalgo.
"We've been passing well lately and looking really
sharp."
The Tigers have been outscored 29-10 this season
but have played well against some excellent oppo
nents â€” losing in overtime to both Duke and Cal.
"Pacific is not a game we are going to take
lightly," said defenseman Gina Bianchini. "No
one thinks it is going to be easy. But if there has
ever been a time we have been ready for them, it's
now."
