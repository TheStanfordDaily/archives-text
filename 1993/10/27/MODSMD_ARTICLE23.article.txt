# Still looking for their first conference win
## Football prepares for run-lovin' Oregon State 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
With four games remaining, the vessel that is the
Stanford football team must either shape up or sink
to the bottom. And while it may appear to be floun
dering, the Cardinal squad is prepared to plug up
their leaks.
"There is a sense of urgency," said Stanford wide
receiver Mark Harris.
Stanford (2-5, 0-4 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
must win all of its remaining games to have a
chance to play in the postseason. Though not an
impossible task, the opponents left on the docket —
Oregon State, USC, Oregon and California — are
hardly life preservers to which the Cardinal can
cling.
Oregon State (3-5, 1-4), the first obstacle in the
Cardinal's voyage to a bowl, comes into Stanford
Stadium on Saturday, following a narrow 20-17 loss
to UCLA. The Beavers boast the nation's second
ranked rushing offense in the nation, averaging 305
yards per game on the ground. Stanford is last in
the Pac-10 in rushing defense, yielding 245 yards
per outing.
"They (the running backs) have tremendous
speed," said Stanford head coach Bill Walsh. "If you
make one miscue, they can eat up 10 yards before
you get to them."

But it is not so much Oregon State's running
backs individually that will present difficulties for
the Cardinal as it is the offensive system that the
Beavers run. Oregon State employs a
wishbone/quarterback option set, a formation that
has given Stanford fits all season long.
"This will be our most difficult project in defend
ing a style of football," Walsh said. "It has given us
problems in the past and it will give us problems in
this game."
"Our philosophy is to option the football," said
Oregon State head coach Jerry Pettibone. "That's
something we feel we can hang our hat on. We've
tried to develop an offense where our players
believe that they're tough, they're physical, and
they're disciplined. I believe we've been able to do
that."
Two weeks ago, the Stanford defense allowed
only 240 total yards against Arizona Last week,
however, that figure nearly doubled as Arizona
State accumulated 454 total yards. Against the
Wildcats, the Cardinal offense sustained long drives
downfield before scoring, but against the Sun Dev
ils the Stanford offense scored quickly, and as a
result the defense did not have a chance to rest.
But Walsh emphasized that fatigue will be hard
for the Stanford defense to avoid this weekend. The
Beaver defense is very effective against the run,
which will force the Cardinal offense to strike and

score quickly with the pass.
"They're a blitzing, gambling defense," Walsh
said. "They blitz more than anyone else in the Pac
-10. This is not a team to run on because they have
eight men right near the line of scrimmage. We do
have runs that we will naturally be utilizing, but
we're going to have to win with the pass."
Though the Cardinal ranks first in the league in
passing offense, whether the team can take advan
tage of the Beavers' secondary will depend on the
offensive line's ability to protect quarterback Steve
Stenstrom against the Beavers' frequent rush.
"If the backs and receivers don't pick up the blitz
and run the right patterns, Steve's going to get
killed," Harris said.
Stenstrom was sacked four times last week in a
38-30 loss against Arizona State, and that abuse —
coupled with the loss of receivers Brian Manning
and Justin Armour — affected his timing. Armour
will remain sidelined this week, while Manning will
most likely return
Despite the setback to the Sun Devils, the Cardi
nal team has maintained a high morale and is pre
pared to halt its four-game skid.
"We still have the same enthusiasm, interest and
excitement for the game," Walsh said. "They (Oregon
State) have a high-risk defense, but the teams that
have done well against them have come up with big
plays. So we'll just have to be patient in what we do."
