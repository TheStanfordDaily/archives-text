The ASSU Senate approved a
bill yesterday that orders Senate
Chair Greg Waldorf to investigate
the status of summer storage and
report his findings to the senate in
November.
Undergraduate senator Antho
ny Westerfield, who proposed the
bill which passed by a 19-1 margin,

said he created the bill to "explore
all possible avenues" for offering
summer storage and to "parallel"
the activities of the Council of Pres
idents.
Members of the COP promised
last spring that, if elected, they
would try to bring summer storage
back to Stanford. They discussed

general plan is to develop a partner
ship with the University," COP
member Ron Brown said. "The ad
ministration is very willing to work

with us to come to a solution."
Brown and undergraduate
senator Grace Casas Silva met
with housing administrators yes
terday to discuss methods of
solving the problem. During the
meeting, the senators discussed

the possibility of on-campus
summer storage with Lynn
Glick, associate manager of hous
ing.
"There's a good shot for on
campus summer storage. But we
don't see summer storage as some
thing that will take five minutes to
develop," Brown said.
"What we were told is that sum
mer storage is possible. That's it,"
Silva added.
