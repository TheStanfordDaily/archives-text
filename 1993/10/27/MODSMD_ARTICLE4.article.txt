# Webb protesters confront Casper
## Students question president's hands-off stance toward ranch 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
University President Ger
hard Casper came face to face
with students concerned about
Webb Ranch working conditions
at last night's ASSU Senate
meeting.
Though the quarterly ques
tion-and-answer sessions be
tween the president and the sen
ate are intended to focus on a
range of issues, Casper was com
pelled to spend the greater part
of the evening addressing the
concerns of 13 students who ar
rived carrying signs protesting
the University's policy on the
ranch.
"Look, I can only repeat what
I have said at the Academic Sen
ate meeting," Casper said. "The
workers at Webb Ranch have
chosen to be represented by a
trade union."
Casper told the Faculty Sen
ate on Oct. 14 that Stanford
should distance itself from ongo
ing problems at the ranch,
which operates on University
owned land leased to the Webb
family. Currently, the Webbs
and their workers are in the
middle of a dispute over who
may reside in housing trailers
donated by the University. The
United Stanford Workers union
claims that some of the trailers

have been given to non-workers,
a possible breach of the contract
between the two parties.
"There is no role that Stan
ford can play in those negotia
tions," Casper said, adding that

his policy
"echoes the sen
timent ex
pressed by (for
mer University
President) Don
ald Kennedy in
1989."
But the pro
testers at the
meeting were

not satisfied with Casper's re
sponse to their statement that
the University should pursue a
more direct stance in respect to
the workers' situation.
Senior Russell Calleros, one
of the protesters' leaders, listed
specific objections to Casper's
policy — including inhumane liv
ing conditions for workers at the
ranch.
"What else can we do to con
vince you that this issue tran
scends all legal issues?" he
asked. "What we're talking
about here is basic human dig
nity. . . . The University should
hold itself to a higher stan
dard."
Senior Gloria Sanchez, anoth


Casper
er of the group's leaders, asked
for specific action by the Univer
sity. "What we're asking for is
an investigation to review the
conditions at Webb Ranch," she
said.
But Casper argued that such
an investigation would "create
major difficulties for the Univer
sity. "
"Stanford informed the Webb
family last year that there had
been problems," he said. "As far
as I know, those issues have
been resolved."
And when group members
„ admitted that they are not the
workers' official representatives,
Casper responded by saying, "I
really think the workers need to
be represented by whom they
choose to represent them."
But despite his decision to
curtail any University policies
aimed at changing the situation
at the ranch, Casper encour

aged action by interested indi
viduals.
"You and I do not disagree
about the role an individual can
play in the process," he said.
"I am a representative of the
University and thus cannot act
in such a dispute as an individu
al," he explained, saying that his
decisions are made for "the good
of the University and not per
sonal reasons."
In addition to responding to
students' concerns about the
ranch, Casper expressed opti
mism regarding the ASSU's role
in the new Commission on
Undergraduate Education.
"I'm very pleased that the
Council of Presidents has decid
ed to establish a parallel organi
zation to the commission," he
said. "A student group can
inform students in general about
the process."
Casper acknowledged that the
commission may have difficul
ties in ascertaining student
viewpoints without such a paral
lel organization.
"Last year I learned a great

deal about undergraduate opin
ions," he said. "But that infor
mation was mainly anecdotal.
"I think the COP effort will
help the commission in its effort
to seek out the opinions of
undergraduates on the future of
Stanford," he said.
Casper also answered ques
tions regarding University cost
containment and tuition-reduc
tion measures.
"Some of you might believe
Stanford is a wealthy institution
because of its large endowment,"
he said. "But only 11 percent of
our expenditures are covered by
endowment income."
He attributed funding short
falls to low alumni donations. "I
have spoken to thousands of
alumni across the country," he.,
said. "It's very clear that
alumni also believe we are
wealthy."
Though he admitted that the
Board of Trustees has "set no
limit" on tuition, Casper said
that "discussion is currently
underway regarding cost con
tainment."

decisions are made for "the good
of the University and not per
sonal reasons."
In addition to responding to
students' concerns about the
ranch, Casper expressed opti
mism regarding the ASSU's role
in the new Commission on
Undergraduate Education.
"I'm very pleased that the
Council of Presidents has decid
ed to establish a parallel organi
zation to the commission," he
said. "A student group can
inform students in general about
the process."
Casper acknowledged that the
commission may have difficul
ties in ascertaining student
viewpoints without such a paral
lel organization.
"Last year I learned a great

deal about undergraduate opin
ions," he said. "But that infor
mation was mainly anecdotal.
"I think the COP effort will
help the commission in its effort
to seek out the opinions of
undergraduates on the future of
Stanford," he said.
Casper also answered ques
tions regarding University cost
containment and tuition-reduc
tion measures.
"Some of you might believe
Stanford is a wealthy institution
because of its large endowment,"
he said. "But only 11 percent of
our expenditures are covered by
endowment income."
He attributed funding short
falls to low alumni donations. "I
have spoken to thousands of
alumni across the country," he.,
said. "It's very clear that
alumni also believe we are
wealthy."
Though he admitted that the
Board of Trustees has "set no
limit" on tuition, Casper said
that "discussion is currently
underway regarding cost con
tainment."
University President Ger
hard Casper came face to face
with students concerned about
Webb Ranch working conditions
at last night's ASSU Senate
meeting.
Though the quarterly ques
tion-and-answer sessions be
tween the president and the sen
ate are intended to focus on a
range of issues, Casper was com
pelled to spend the greater part
of the evening addressing the
concerns of 13 students who ar
rived carrying signs protesting
the University's policy on the
ranch.
"Look, I can only repeat what
I have said at the Academic Sen
ate meeting," Casper said. "The
workers at Webb Ranch have
chosen to be represented by a
trade union."
Casper told the Faculty Sen
ate on Oct. 14 that Stanford
should distance itself from ongo
ing problems at the ranch,
which operates on University
owned land leased to the Webb
family. Currently, the Webbs
and their workers are in the
middle of a dispute over who
may reside in housing trailers
donated by the University. The
United Stanford Workers union
claims that some of the trailers

have been given to non-workers,
a possible breach of the contract
between the two parties.
"There is no role that Stan
ford can play in those negotia
tions," Casper said, adding that

his policy
"echoes the sen
timent ex
pressed by (for
mer University
President) Don
ald Kennedy in
1989."
But the pro
testers at the
meeting were

not satisfied with Casper's re
sponse to their statement that
the University should pursue a
more direct stance in respect to
the workers' situation.
Senior Russell Calleros, one
of the protesters' leaders, listed
specific objections to Casper's
policy — including inhumane liv
ing conditions for workers at the
ranch.
"What else can we do to con
vince you that this issue tran
scends all legal issues?" he
asked. "What we're talking
about here is basic human dig
nity. . . . The University should
hold itself to a higher stan
dard."
Senior Gloria Sanchez, anoth


Casper
er of the group's leaders, asked
for specific action by the Univer
sity. "What we're asking for is
an investigation to review the
conditions at Webb Ranch," she
said.
But Casper argued that such
an investigation would "create
major difficulties for the Univer
sity. "
"Stanford informed the Webb
family last year that there had
been problems," he said. "As far
as I know, those issues have
been resolved."
And when group members
„ admitted that they are not the
workers' official representatives,
Casper responded by saying, "I
really think the workers need to
be represented by whom they
choose to represent them."
But despite his decision to
curtail any University policies
aimed at changing the situation
at the ranch, Casper encour

aged action by interested indi
viduals.
"You and I do not disagree
about the role an individual can
play in the process," he said.
"I am a representative of the
University and thus cannot act
in such a dispute as an individu
al," he explained, saying that his
decisions are made for "the good
of the University and not per
sonal reasons."
In addition to responding to
