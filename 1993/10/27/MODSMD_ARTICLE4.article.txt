# Webb protesters confront Casper
## Students question president's hands-off stance toward ranch 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
University President Ger
hard Casper came face to face
with students concerned about
Webb Ranch working conditions
at last night's ASSU Senate
meeting.
Though the quarterly ques
tion-and-answer sessions be
tween the president and the sen
ate are intended to focus on a
range of issues, Casper was com
pelled to spend the greater part
of the evening addressing the
concerns of 13 students who ar
rived carrying signs protesting
the University's policy on the
ranch.
"Look, I can only repeat what
I have said at the Academic Sen
ate meeting," Casper said. "The
workers at Webb Ranch have
chosen to be represented by a
trade union."
Casper told the Faculty Sen
ate on Oct. 14 that Stanford
should distance itself from ongo
ing problems at the ranch,
which operates on University
owned land leased to the Webb
family. Currently, the Webbs
and their workers are in the
middle of a dispute over who
may reside in housing trailers
donated by the University. The
United Stanford Workers union
claims that some of the trailers

have been given to non-workers,
a possible breach of the contract
between the two parties.
"There is no role that Stan
ford can play in those negotia
tions," Casper said, adding that

his policy
"echoes the sen
timent ex
pressed by (for
mer University
President) Don
ald Kennedy in
1989."
But the pro
testers at the
meeting were

not satisfied with Casper's re
sponse to their statement that
the University should pursue a
more direct stance in respect to
the workers' situation.
Senior Russell Calleros, one
of the protesters' leaders, listed
specific objections to Casper's
policy â€” including inhumane liv
ing conditions for workers at the
ranch.
"What else can we do to con
vince you that this issue tran
scends all legal issues?" he
asked. "What we're talking
about here is basic human dig
nity. . . . The University should
hold itself to a higher stan
dard."
