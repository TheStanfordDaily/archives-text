# Back to the future: Minority hiring changes course
## 
### Nami Kim Julie Tsai Staff writers 
Turning yet another corner on the path to di
versifying its faculty, the University is hoping that
strategies that have worked in the past — such as
affirmative action and monetary incentives — can
work again in the future.
While recently announced initiatives like the
Faculty Incentive Fund and the renewed empha
sis on affirmative action through the Office of
Multicultural Development have attracted atten
tion, they've also served to raise the questions:
how much progress has the school made to date on
minority hiring, and where will it go from here?
As of June 1993, minorities comprised 10.9
percent of Stanford's faculty. That puts Stanford
slightly below the national average of 12.3 percent
and behind Harvard, Yale, UCLA and UC-Berke
ley. Stanford does, however, rank marginally
above MIT in minority faculty percentage.

Back to the basics
Most recently, the University has bolstered the
incentives to hire minority faculty. As of Septem
ber, the Faculty Incentive Fund will provide to
schools an average of $35,000 and a half-billet —
the equivalent of a half-time professorship — for
each new minority faculty hired.
While some have interpreted the new policy to
be nativist for recruiting specifically "American
ized" faculty, many see it as addressing foremost
the issue of recruiting under-represented minori
ties for the faculty.
"[This] is a very, very positive first step," Eng
lish Prof. Ramon Saldivar said. "Universities have
previously depended on the goodwill of individual
departments (to appoint minority faculty)
The incentives now are much more pro-active."
"(It's] a neglected issue that's been muddied in

the past three to four years. [The
incentive fund] got buried," said
Cecilia Burciaga, associate dean
and vice provost of student affairs,
who served on the 1989 University
Committee on Minority Issues.
In addition to the Incentive
Fund, the University has refocused
the Office of Multicultural Develop
ment back toward affirmative
action.
University Provost Condoleezza
Rice also announced a few months
ago the creation of a vice provost
position specifically for faculty affir
mative action.
"The effort of the provost to hire
a vice provost for faculty recruit
ment and retention is an excellent
idea," said Political Science Prof.
Luis Fraga.
"[This is] a renewed commit
ment that has always been here....
[The University] reinstated a clear
commitment to hiring target
groups," he said.
Burciaga echoed the theme of
old policies revitalized by new lead
ership.
"Thank you, Condie, for saying
what you're going to put in place,
and giving the task some account
ability. The past three years there's
been no accountability," she said.
Progress on UCMI goals
The restructuring of the multi
cultural office also prompted re
examination of the progress the Uni
versity has made on recommenda
tions from the 1989 UCMI report.
The report stressed the need to
increase the number of underrepre
sented (non-Asian) minority facul
ty. At the time, Stanford had 49

such faculty, including those on
tenure and non-tenure tracks. It
recommended adding 30 faculty
members from targeted minority
groups over the course of 10 years,
an average of three a year.
In the past four years, hiring
seems to have kept pace with these
recommendations, as the number
of faculty from underrepresented
groups has risen to 67 — including
13 black, four Latino, and one
Native American. In addition, there
are currently 86 Asian faculty
members, bringing the total to 153.
Nevertheless, Fraga said that
progress toward faculty diversifica
tion has been quite erratic among
different departments.
"Some have been more respon
sive than others," Fraga said.
In retrospect
In 1971, the Faculty Affirmative
Action Fund, now the Faculty
Incentive Fund, was created to
increase the number of women and
minorities across all University
Departments. The provost made
appointments on an individual
basis.
After the fund was instituted,
the first small wave of minority fac
ulty was hired, according to History
Prof. A 1 Camarillo, associate dean
of Humanities and Sciences
"For faculty, the first significant
expansion of minority faculty hir
ing came in the early to mid-705,"
Camarillo said. "A blip arises in the
period from 1973 to 1977, but since
then the rate of increase evens out
and remains at a steady state
through 1990-91."
According to the UCMI report,
between 1972 to 1977, tenure-line
minority faculty, including Asians,
rose from five percent to seven per
cent of total faculty. Within seven
years, the number rose to eight per-

cent. Since 1989, minority faculty
has risen from 8.1 percent to 10.9
percent of total faculty.
Burciaga says, though, that the
state of change was incremental.
"The hiring blip of '72 to '75
wasn't a surge — each year one was
added of the most underrepresent
ed minorities .. . [The school of
Humanities and Science] did make
some gains over the past two
years," she said.
Looking ahead
While the University seems to
have redoubled efforts to recruit
minority faculty, last spring's deci
sion in the School of Humanities
and Science not to accept the histo
ry Department's recommendation
of tenure for Prof. Gordon Chang
has raised questions.
Burciaga said it does send a
mixed message to potential minori
ty faculty regarding University
interest in diversity.
"It does send a chill; it's tough to
be appointed (to faculty) and even
tougher to get tenure. ... It cer

tainly hurt (the ability to attract
minority faculty). If anybody's
savvy, they know what situation is
here before they come, and they
know what to negotiate," she said.
But Asst. Provost for Faculty
Affairs Kathryn Gillam said that
the decision not to grant Chang
tenure was made with curricular
concerns — not diversity concerns
— in mind.
"There are several goals: one is
the desire to bring minority faculty
across the disciplines. The second
issue is questions of curriculum,"
Gillam said. "These are two sepa
rate issues."
While individual hiring decisions
continue to stir debate, many have
expressed optimism on achieving
diversity among faculty.
"I am heartened (by efforts) and
look forward to the next years,"
Fraga said. "It shows that the high
est levels of the University are com
mitted to this."
