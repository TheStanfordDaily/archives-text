# Break-in, vandalism at LGBCC
## Campus authorities puzzled by mysterious incident 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
Random acts of vandalism — moved furniture, of
fensive messages, general disarray — have become
routine for staff members at the Lesbian, Gay, and
Bisexual Community Center. But the scene of broken
glass and bloodstains that one staff member encoun
tered upon entering the center Sunday night seemed
even stranger than usual.
An unknown intruder apparently entered by
breaking one of the center's second-floor windows
while standing on the first-floor roof of the Fire
Truck House, said Stanford Police Lt. Del Bandy.
The intruder was probably injured by the broken

glass, which accounts for the bloodstains on the cen
ter's walls, light switches, refrigerator and computer,
Bandy said.
Natasha Iskander, a member of the center's stu
dent staff, said the break-in must have occurred Sun
day sometime between 1:30 a.m. — the time she last
left the center — and 5:30 p.m., when the mess was
discovered.
The trespasser's motivation is unclear, as nothing
was stolen from the center and nothing was damaged
except for the window. Bandy said that there is noth
ing to indicate that the incident was hate-motivated.
"That's the first thing we consider, given the type
of center that was broken into,"
Bandy said. "But we didn't see
anything that would seem to indi
cate it as a hate crime. There's
not much to follow up on here."
Some past incidents at the cen
ter have clearly been hate-moti
vated, such as one case in which
an intruder scrawled the words
"Kill all dykes" on a book. But
student staff members were
reluctant to rashly ascribe Sun
day's intrusion to bigotry.
"I would withhold judgment,"
said Albert Liu, a worker at the
center. "At this point we do not

have enough information."
Liu noted that the severity and
frequency of vandalism and tres
passing at the center seems to be
"escalating." For months, the
staff has been subject to such
annoyances as chairs stacked so
that they fall when the door is
opened, flyers littering the floor,
and offensive graffiti.
"It's just been a series of inci
dents," Iskander said. "The same
kind of thing happening over and
over."
Over the summer, in response
to the increasing crimes, the cen
ter instituted its own "communi
ty patrols." Additionally, in
response to this incident, police
have agreed to help watch the
area more closely, Liu said.
