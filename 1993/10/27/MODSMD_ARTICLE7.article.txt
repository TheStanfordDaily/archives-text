The next time you see the Pills
bury Doughboy mam bo around a
batch of chocolate-chip cookies or
watch Arnold Schwarzenegger fly
off an overpass in "Terminator 2,"
you're watching the work of Stan
ford alumnus Carl Rosendahl.
A year after graduating from
Stanford in 1979 with a bachelor's
in electrical engineering,
Rosendahl founded Pacific Data

Images, Inc., a company which
specializes in mass-media video
computer graphics and special ef
fects. Rosendahl says he had al
ways wanted to get into the field of
special effects and remembers
being inspired by the movie '"2001
Space Odyssey."
"Although the effects in '2001'
would be considered elementary
techniques today, they still stand
out as incredible," says
Rosendahl.

PDI is best known for innova
tive, eye-catching projects like the
"morphing" at the end of Michael
Jackson's video "Black or White,"
where one face is transformed into
several different identities, shift
ing seamlessly across racial and
gender boundaries The company
also created the digital effects in
the movie, "Toys," and David
Bvrne's new video, "She's Mad."
