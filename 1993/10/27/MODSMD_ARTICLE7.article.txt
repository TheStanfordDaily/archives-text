# Alum explodes onto effects scene

The next time you see the Pills
bury Doughboy mam bo around a
batch of chocolate-chip cookies or
watch Arnold Schwarzenegger fly
off an overpass in "Terminator 2,"
you're watching the work of Stan
ford alumnus Carl Rosendahl.
A year after graduating from
Stanford in 1979 with a bachelor's
in electrical engineering,
Rosendahl founded Pacific Data

Images, Inc., a company which
specializes in mass-media video
computer graphics and special ef
fects. Rosendahl says he had al
ways wanted to get into the field of
special effects and remembers
being inspired by the movie '"2001
Space Odyssey."
"Although the effects in '2001'
would be considered elementary
techniques today, they still stand
out as incredible," says
Rosendahl.

PDI is best known for innova
tive, eye-catching projects like the
"morphing" at the end of Michael
Jackson's video "Black or White,"
where one face is transformed into
several different identities, shift
ing seamlessly across racial and
gender boundaries The company
also created the digital effects in
the movie, "Toys," and David
Bvrne's new video, "She's Mad."
In addition to bending the
imagination, PDl's techniques
have also had some practical appli
cations. In the movie "The Babe,"
the large stadium crowd was "cre
ated" by manipulating shots of a
small group of extras, eliminating
the need to pay thousands of peo
ple to be fans for the scene.
Although PDI now has more
than 100 employees and two
branch offices — the original
office in Mountain View and
another in Hollywood — business
wasn't always so secure,
Rosendahl said.
Fresh out of Stanford armed
with only an idea, Rosendahl
admits he "borrowed money from
Dad."
In the first three years of busi
ness, Rosendahl was able to hire
three employees. PDl's "first big
break" came from Globo Televi
sion in Brazil, who licensed soft
ware that Rosendahl's company
had developed. Things took off
from there, he said.
Now, Rosendahl counts his
employees and projects by the
dozen. PDI is working on about a
dozen projects with a team of a
dozen working on each one. In
addition, there is a software
development department with a
dozen people.
One of the challenges
Rosendahl faces in managing
PDI is maintaining a "creative
environment where people feel
comfortable and relaxed and at

the same time have a traditional
manufacturing atmosphere
where people specialize and work
quickly."
While Rosendahl describes
himself as a hard worker, "it's a
weird kind of work," he says. "A
lot of marketing, getting out and
building those relationships. But
it's really fun and I can't think of
a better job in the world."
PDI would like to start trying
its hand at developing its own
projects in the next few years to
ensure final say over production
content, Rosendahl said.
It has also taken on some more
artistic ventures. Their award
winning computer-generated car
toon, "Gas Planet" — about
extraterrestrials who eat berries
and let out explosive farts —
played at last year's San Francis
co animation festival.
And although it appears to
others that he has climbed the
ladder to financial comfort,
Rosendahl says, "It's all rela
tive."
"When me and my four closest
friends got out of college we
ranked the four F's: fame, for
tune, fun and family," Rosendahl
said. "Fortune was low on my
'4F' list."
While at Stanford, he says,"I
decided I wasn't going kill myself
to be an A student and that I
would be happier that way."
Back then, students "didn't
need to graduate with an A aver
age for a well paying job" in his
field.

"No one ever checks my
G.P.A. now," he added, laughing.
