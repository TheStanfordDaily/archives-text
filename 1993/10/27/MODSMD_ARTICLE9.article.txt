Jobless benefits may be cut
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate
dealt a setback yesterday to a bill providing
additional jobless benefits for the long
term unemployed, but Democrats seemed
likely to resurrect the measure in a day.
Arguing that the spending cuts
Democrats had found to finance the $1.1
billion measure were bogus, Republicans
stalled the legislation by one vote. That
forced the Senate to put the bill aside until
today, when it will hold another vote.
Because two Democratic senators
missed yesterday's vote, Democrats
seemed likely to prevail on the second try.
Leaders of the two parties agreed to look
for substitute financing, but these talks
seemed unlikely to produce a compromise.
The vote put in limbo the 60,000 people
a week who come to the end of their regu
lar 26 weeks of unemployment benefits.
They had been entitled to apply for extend
ed benefits since November 1991, but that
provision expired Oct. 2.
Democrats had 60 votes until Sen.
Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., switched her
vote from supporting to opposing the bene

fits at the last moment.
Christopher visits Latvia
RIGA, Latvia (AP) — Secretaiy of State
Warren Christopher arrived yesterday in
and immediately called on Russia to
withdraw its remaining 16,000 troops from
this Baltic state that is looking westward in
economics and politics.
Christopher boosted the idea of full cit
izenship rights for the Russian-speaking
minority that makes up 34 percent of the
population.
Latvia was Christopher's last stop on an
eight-day trip that has been focused on
U.S. efforts to accelerate the denucleariza
tion of three other former Soviet republics,
Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus.
That effort has had mixed results.
Belarus is complying with its pledge to dis
mantle its 81 long-range nuclear missiles.
But Ukraine and Kazakhstan are taking
their time — as Russia is about withdraw
ing the 16,000 troops that along with a
naval base and a radar installation are the
last vestiges of 50 years of Soviet occupa
tion.
