Breast cancer research woes
WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal agen
cies need to invest at least $500 million a
year in breast cancer research to make
gains against a disease that will kill almost
half a million American women in this
decade, a presidential commission says.
The Special Commission on Breast
Cancer said yesterday that promising
breast cancer research projects are
delayed or never even started because fed
eral agencies lack the money for them.
Commission chairwoman Nancy
Brinker said the National Institutes of
Health is budgeted to spend about $300
million on breast cancer research in fiscal
1994, and the Defense Department has
been given another $210 million for such
research over the next five years. But this

is not enough, she said.
"There are two things we don't know
about breast cancer," Brinker said. "We
don't know the cause, and we don't know
the cure. Until we make such a commit
ment, we're not going to know either
one."
Breast cancer will be diagnosed in
about 2 million women in the 19905, the
commission said, and 460,000 will die.
Since 1950, the incidence of breast cancer
has increased 53 percent — one of the
fastest growing killer diseases in the
nation, Brinker said.
Brinker said that in 15 months of
research and hearings, the commission
found that the lack of funds is slowing the
battle against breast cancer, despite
Eromising advances in genetics, molecular
iology and other fields.
