## Clinton delivers health care bill Congress is open-minded, but expects major changes to the plan 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Promising a
"new era of security for every Ameri
can," President Clinton hand-carried his
revised health care plan to Congress
yesterday and urged passage within a
year. Lawmakers of both parties
applauded, then predicted major
changes.
Clinton won't "get the full bite of the
apple," said House Republican Leader
Bob Michel. He added that there are
"substantive and profound policy differ
ences" over many elements in the plan
assembled by First Lady Hillary Clinton.
Clinton presented the plan in the
Capitol's ornate Statuary Hall — to the
cheers of more than 70 congressional
supporters — in an effort to regain the
momentum lost in the last month after
the original unveiling of the broad pro

posal.
But delivery of the 1,300-page plan
reignited the debate over Clinton's
approach. It sparked little fire fights yes
terday in a preview of the big battles to
come between the president's hard-core
supporters and foes on Capitol Hill.
It could be August 1994 or later
before Congress acts.
Clinton gave a shortened, repeat per
formance of his speech to the nation five
weeks ago when he outlined a need to
reform the nation's $900 billion health
care system.
Since then, the White House, bending
in part to critics, has retooled the plan so
that it postpones the guarantee of uni
versal coverage for a year and limits fed
eral subsidies for medical care. Other
numbers have changed, too, such as how

much the White House is counting on
out of Medicaid savings.
Also, the final version would demand
that drug manufacturers give the gov
ernment rebates of at least 17 percent
on drugs sold to Medicare patients. The
draft plan had indicated a 15 percent
rebate.
In another major decision since the
first unveiling, the administration has
said that part of the plan's cost would be
met by raising cigarette taxes 75 cents
per pack.
Clinton said Congress must act, one
way or another. "The most expensive
thing we can do is nothing," he said.
"The present system we have is the most
complex, the most bureaucratic, the
most mind-boggling system imposed on
any people on the face of the earth."
