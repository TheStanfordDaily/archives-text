Ciy one selected class
in a major should fulfill
the writing requirement

IN THEIR FIRST meeting last
week, the members of the Com
mission on Undergraduate
Education tackled a hefty question
— the validity of the current writ
ing requirement. Starting the pro
cess by examining the fundamental
reasons behind Stanford's core cur
riculum is an extremely important
step in the evaluation process, and
should not be underestimated.
At the same time, however, the
Commission must take this discus
sion one step further. In their eval
uation of the purpose and motives
behind a policy, the members of the
Commission must also examine the
ways in which that policy can be
effectively implemented.
There is a general agreement
that the focus of the freshman
writing requirement should be on
learning to communicate one's
ideas effectively. Proper grammar
and syntax are a part of this, of
course, but the emphasis should be
on developing a lucid and strong
argument and on learning to think
about how and for which audience
one is writing.
For years, the Freshman English
program has been criticized in this
respect. Students are encouraged
to write for their audience — but
writing for a graduate student who
is teaching Freshman English is
hardly appropriate practice. The
program does not truly develop
practical skills applicable to a spe
cific audience.
Recently, Freshman English has
tried to add more relevance to its
papers by including things like the
community service-focused classes.
But even here, the premise is not
on learning writing skills for
academia — the skills that stu
dents will need over four years. In
contrast, Freshman English seems
to exist simply to fulfill the writing

requirement.
Combining the writing require
ment with the Cultures, Ideas and
Values program would eliminate
this problem. The focus of such a
program should be on several
smaller papers, instead of one large
one due at the end of each quarter.
This will allow students to actually
use the feedback they receive from
their section leaders. Students
need the opportunity to continually
evaluate their writing and improve
upon it.
For this to be effective, though,
there needs to be regular discus
sion between the student and the
section leader. Comments in the
margin are often inadequate; the
emphasis should be on talking with
students one-on-one. The shift to
an individual-based program that
stresses the importance of develop
ing each student's writing skills
will be much more effective than a
curriculum-based program.
The need for effective writing
skills is not limited to freshman
year or the CIV program. Many
University departments have rec
ognized the importance of writing
in their degree requirements, but
this should be reflected in the Uni
versity-wide requirements for
graduation.
An "asterisk requirement" (like
the current gender studies require
ment) for courses in the major that
include substantial writing would
teach students to write for their
discipline, whether it be a literary
theory paper or a biology lab
report.
The ability to write well is only a
tool; the current Freshman
English program does not teach
students how to wield that tool in
practical ways. Incorporating the
freshman writing requirement
with the CIV program will intro
duce students to purposeful aca
demic writing. A writing asterisk
will complete a student's education
by teaching them to write within
their discipline. The Commission
should recommend these changes
in its final report to University
President Gerhard Casper.
