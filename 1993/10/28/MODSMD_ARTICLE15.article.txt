## Confessions of a Tea Partier 
### 
-1 CONFESS. I applied for my fee
refund last week. I am a former Stu
dent Activities Director, and I took
money from student organizations.
I am not retaliating against those who
voted down the Graduate Student Associ
ation fee request last spring. Nor am I
trying to punish Stanford student organi
zations. I did it to join the Graduate Stu
dent Tea Party. I believe that the ASSU
has stopped being an effective advocate
for student needs.
Taking away fee money does not hurt
the ASSU per se. The operation of the
ASSU itself — the Senate and the Coun
cil of Presidents (COP) — is not primari
ly funded by ASSU fees. It is supported
by profits from business projects, such as
Lecture Notes. However, the fee refund
process is the most public way for gradu
ate students to protest.
The Tea Party is a protest against an
ASSU which does not take on the admin
istration on issues important to graduate
students. By instigating this protest,
frustrated students have opened a public
debate about their lack of representation
and advocacy. Graduate students make
up half the student body. Our concerns
deserve half of the attention of the ASSU.
We need the ASSU to change. The last
thing that this campus needs is another
useless bureacracy; but if the ASSU
won't understand the problems facing

graduate students, then grad students
must form their own organization. Since
the ASSU is currently undergoing a
review, now is the perfect time for gradu
ate students to say what we do want.
We want informed leadership on
issues affecting our lives. We want lead
ers who get deans to make decisions
which benefit students. We want access
to the information which affects our
lives. We want the senate and COP to
take a stand when bad decisions are
made.
Individual graduate students do not
have the information they need to under
stand current systems on campus, much
less to fight the administration. Only by
acting collectively can we affect change. A
revamped student government could pro
vide the mechanism to collect informa
tion, analyze University policy from a
student perspective, and negotiate on
behalf of students.
Student government needs to do three
things in order to meet the needs of grad
uate students. First, it must uncover and
share information. We must demand
access to data which affects students.
How many graduate students drop out of
Stanford? What is the financial impact of
the loss of tuition remission? Why is
there no student maternity leave policy?
Second, student leaders must under
stand the details of university gover

nance, and be informed policy analysts.
The model of the think-tank might serve
well here. Student government could hire
student research assistants to investigate
and analyze University policy issues from
a student perspective.
Third, students must provide
informed input into administration deci
sions. Student leaders must have access
to key decision makers on a regular basis.
When 1 was an undergraduate at Brown
the student government leadership met
weekly for breakfast with the president
of the university. Students must set an
agenda and demand administrative
response, instead of reacting to decisions
which have already been made.
It has been a long time since the ASSU
served as a voice for student needs. Stan
ford graduate students are making their
needs known. Now is the time to restruc
ture student government to lobby effec
tively for the student position and keep
their efforts in the public eye. In the
words of Benjamin Franklin, we must all
hang together or we will assuredly hang
separately.

Grey.
