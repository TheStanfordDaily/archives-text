## Students discuss hidden agenda of Holocaust Revisionism 
### 
WE ARE WRITING to commend
Rajiv Chandrasekaran's Oct. 26
response to Bradley Smith's
"ad." Too often, campus newspapers
become so ideologically dedicated to
"freedom of expression" that they lose
sight of the newspapers' responsibility to
provide students with truth. We were
encouraged to see The Daily make this
distinction. We would like to address
some of the important issues surround
ing Holocaust Revisionism which were
not within the scope of Chan
drasekaran's response.
The "views" of Smith and other Revi
sionists are nothing more than classic
anti-Semitic claims cloaked in pseudo
intellectual scholarly language. By so
framing their hatred, they gain access to
scholarly arenas from which they would
otherwise be excluded.
Smith targets campus newspapers

precisely because of the questioning
nature inherent to universities. He
asserts, seemingly along the line of polit
ical-correctness, that people ought to
examine the non-traditional view of his
tory, the "other side of the story." He
manipulates the universities' emphasis
on open-mindedness into historical rela
tivism, insisting that other views of his
tory provide us with alternate truths.
Whereas the "other side" of an opin
ion may be a legitimate view which chal
lenges us to defend our belief, the "other
side" of a historical fact is nothing more
than a well-phrased lie. The teaching of
lies is not the vision of the university.
Smith's ad and arguments are power
ful precisely because they demand the
impossible. They demand "proof" of the
Holocaust at the same time that they
dismiss all previous proof as forgery or
emotional sensationalism. When all evi

dence (confessions, testimonies, govern
ment documents, corpses) is explained
away as distortion, exaggeration or lie,
how can one possibly prove anything?
We challenge anyone to prove any
event if all original sources are discredit
ed. For example, it would be absurd to
claim that all documents referring to the
existence of slavery in the United States
were falsified, and then to ask someone
to prove that slavery was a reality. By
indiscriminately discrediting factual evi
dence, Smith's version of Historical
Revisionism obliterates history.
We agree that a college newspaper is
not the correct forum in which to
"debate over fundamental issues." We
question, however, what the correct
forum for such a debate would be.
Would we like to hear students in the
classroom "debating" whether or not the
Holocaust actually occurred? We

applaud the editor precisely because he
does not engage in this so-called debate,
because he does not attempt to disprove
Smith point-by-point.
No one, no matter how knowledge
able, can rationally debate with hate,
no matter how sophisticated the veneer
which covers it; to even try is to suggest
that hate is logical. We were extremely
pleased to see that the editor did not
grant Smith this validity. We hope that
others see that the way to battle the
racist and anti-Semitic agenda underly
ing Revisionists' claims is to under
stand that hidden beneath their intel
lectual language is the same hatred
which fueled the very event they now
deny â€” the extermination of millions of
people.
