# Ad is one consequence of intellectual climate

I was impressed with and grateful for
Rajiv Chandrasekaran's op-ed piece in the
Oct. 26 Daily. It is important that stu
dents realize that Holocaust Revisionism
is not limited to a few fools and crackpots,
but is a growing arena of scholarship, in
which once-respected historians are par
ticipating.
The Roper poll that Chandrasekaran
mentions reported, in April, that 22 per
cent of the adults polled said it seemed
possible that the Holocaust had never
happened; an additional 12 percent said
they did not know if it was possible.
When Allied soldiers "liberated" the
concentration camps in 1945 and the
extent of the Holocaust's destruction was
discovered, the apprehension of intellectu
als and historians was varied, but there
was no question that the Holocaust had
occurred. Yet it is clear to me that the

Holocaust Museum does not exist entirely
because of the unanimous horror of the
world; museums must be conceived, lob
bied for and built.
However, despite the cry of "never
again" and its incarceration in stone and
brick, genocide continues, in high-profile
areas such as Bosnia and in ignored areas
such as East Timor, and very little is ever
done about it. And, unfortunately, there is
a connection between this and Bradley R.
Smith, that 22 percent of American
adults, and some of my fellow students
here at Stanford.
It is individuals such as Smith who
lead us to forget that free speech does not
exist as an end in itself. Rather, free
speech serves to ensure that humans have
as many possible informational resources
from which to make the decisions—moral,
political, social, economic—by which they
will live their lives.
Deborah Lipstadt's point, which at first
is an assault to the instincts and notions
carefully honed by my education, comes to
light in this context. Lips tad t maintains

that to formally contest the Holocaust
Revisionists is to lend them undue credi
bility, and I agree. It is useless to rational
ly counter an irrational and ultimately
hateful movement. The guarantee of free
speech ensures, as it should and must,
that Smith's opinion will not be repressed.
But it is not meant to automatically
ensure legitimacy in the eyes of all. That
is up to Smith and his scholarship.
I am writing this mainly because I view
many of my colleagues at Stanford as
unwitting contributors to an intellectual
climate that makes possible a Bradley R.
Smith. It is, in my opinion, no less than
tragic that deconstruction and postmod
ernist thinking, which focuses on lan
guage's "unreliability" and the "indeter
minacy" of texts, and which has been a
tool of liberation and a reaffirmation of
existence for marginalized identities and
intellectuals, could become a tool in the
hands of many to deny existence.
To affirm that everything is narrative,
that all truth is subjective and that there
is, therefore, no history that really

"exists" is initially an exhilarating and
challenging notion, but it is one with
grave moral consequences. It is up to
those who intend to study, teach and
write about these ideas and who will
thereby enlarge their sphere of influence
and prolong their lives to confront these
consequences.
I hop?? that readers will find these
arguments explicative and provocative.
But I recognize that much of my force
comes from an unanswered question to
Smith's advertisement: If the Holocaust
never happened, why have I no extended
family? Why can I not visit my relatives in
the "old country," as so many of my
friends can and do?
Chandrasekaran is entirely correct:
Holocaust education must continue. But
students, especially those entering adult
hood, must be willing to go further, to
ponder the links between intellectual cli
mates and world events and to ask them
selves what they really do believe.
