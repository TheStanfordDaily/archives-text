## UOP falls; Cal is next 
### Christian Leone Staff writer 
The Stanford field hockey team had to win
yesterday at home against the University of
Pacific. They met the challenge, cruising to a
5-1 win.
It was a pressure situation and, as usual,
senior forward Sara Hallock stepped to the
fore. Her four goals led Stanford (8-7) to its
fourth defeat of UOP (2-9) this season.
Stanford started slowly, but halfway
through the first half Hallock took over. Con
trolling the ball, she avoided a defender and
unleashed a rocket to put the Cardinal up 1-
0.
Minutes later, Stanford was given a cor
ner. Elise Morgan passed the ball to Tina
Syer who passed it along to Hallock. The
result was another blistering, goal-scoring
slap shot.
This Saturday, Stanford will host Berkeley
in a Northern Pacific Conference battle at 11
a.m. Once again there will be pressure for the
Cardinal: if Stanford loses, the team will be
all but eliminated from the NCAA tourna
ment.
"We did not play that well, but we won,"
said Hallock. "We are ready for Cal."
Stanford will have stop a red-hot Ilse
Akkermans, who has four goals and three
assists in her last five games, if they want to
keep their tournament hopes alive. Cal is 5-0
when she scores and 1-5 when she is shut out.
"Cal is really cocky," said Cardinal for
ward Jen Gleuck, "and we are going to show
them who is best."
The 6-5 Golden Bears have been outscored
25-to-20 this season, while the frustrated
Cardinal has outscored opponents 41-23.
The Cardinal defense has six shutouts while
Cal has posted only two. But the Cardinal has
lost two overtime heartbreakers to the Bears.
"We have to win and we are going to win,"
said senior Danielle Beynet. "A loss is not in
our vocabulary."
