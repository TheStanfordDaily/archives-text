## Hallock gives opposition headaches Cardinal's leading scorer has been unstoppable for last four years 
### Christian Leone Staff writer 
They call her Ice.
Some say it's because she is so cool. Others say it's
because when the pressure is on, she has ice in her
veins. But the real reason is iceberg lettuce. For twelve
years, the field hockey team has been giving out fruits,
vegetables, herbs or spices as nicknames for the incom
ing freshman, and Sara Hallock was given iceberg let

tuce.
"They wanted to call me ice because I'm cool," Hal
lock said, laughing. "It's tradition. I don't know why
they gave it to me but it stuck."
A glimpse at Hallock's room leaves no doubt that she
is both celebrated and busy. The walls are covered with
Nike ads, field hockey promotions and a blown-up pic
ture of her on the cover of a field hockey media guide.
There is also a white loft with a huge "Debbie" written
on the side.

"We bought it from someone, we were going to paint
it,"the senior explained.
Sara has an excuse for not painting the loft. She has
been busy dominating Division I field hockey. Hallock
has 24 of her team's 39 goals this season. Named an Ail-
American her junior and no doubt her current senior
year (her 50 points rank her third nationally in scoring),
Hallock has proven that she is one of the best players in
collegiate field hockey.
Scoring goals has never been a problem for "Ice." In
fact, she scored 102 of them in high school and 50 her
senior year. Yet she remains modest.
"Before high school, I had never heard of field hock
ey," said Hallock. "I started playing because because
soccer is in the winter in California and I didn't have
anything to do in the fall."
Hallock has always been coordinated. At the age of
18 months, to the amazement of her parents, she would
climb and swing on jungle gyms. As a child she played
baseball, Softball and soccer.
Furthermore, Sara always seems to come through in
the clutch, no matter what sport she competes in.
"She used to play softball and she was all right," said
Sara's father. "But when her team got to the champi
onship she went five for five with five of the team's
seven hits."
Sara's father makes it easier for her to be modest.
"My dad has pretty much been the driving force
behind every athletic thing I've done. He taught me how
to do everything," Hallock said. "When we are playing
golf, he'll sit there and talk to someone about me like
I'm not even there. He'll go on and on. Its made me a
really modest person just because he totally brags about
me to everyone."
Hallock has been Stanford's leading scorer since her
freshman year.
"She is a scoring machine," said Cardinal head coach
Sheryl Johnson. "Her ball-control skills are incredible
and she can evade a defender almost 100 percent of the
time."
Once she evades her defender, it is usually bad news
for opposing goalkeepers, as her blistering shot is dead
ly-
"She finds a way to get it in," her father explains.
"She just turns on the jets and the game changes. When
she gets the ball, look out and don't get in her way."
"She is a really strong team leader. Not only is she
strong on the field but she has a presence off the field
that has been a real asset to the team," said senior tea
mate Gina Bianchini. "Whatever she does, she does
well. It's fun to watch her because she knows how to

play the game. Sara does it right."
Sara also knows how to play golf.
After taking a tournament golf class,
Hallock caught the attention of the
men's golf coach.
"He told me I should try out,"
Hallock said. "So I did."
Needless to say she made the
team, which further cut into her free
time.
"I don't really have time for any
thing," Hallock said. "When I'm not
playing field hockey, I'm playing golf.

I'm so inexperienced so I've got to get
my butt in gear and play a ton of tour
naments."
It is somewhat of a travesty that
Hallock, one of Stanford's strongest
athletes, has not recieved any type of
scholarship. Even though field hock
ey is a varsity sport, they have none to
give.
"When I came [to Stanford] I just
totally fell in love with the school. I
didn't even know if we were going to
have a program for four years," she
explains. "I just wanted to go to
school here for the education. I knew
I would not be playing field hockey
after college."
A leader by example, Hallock has

earned the respect of coaches, players
and fails across the country.
"You learn so much just by watch
ing her," said Cardinal freshman
Amy Marfil. "And she is always will
ing to help you."
The Stanford field hockey team is
currently 8-7, with Hallock almost
single-handedly outscoring oppo
nents. For example, she has more
goals thim the entire Berkeley team
and more than twice as many goals jis
the entire University of Pacific squad.
In a word, she is awesome.
"Sports have always been a huge
part of my life," Hallock reflects. "I'm
a really competitive person. If I didn't
have sports I would go crazy."

thing," Hallock said. "When I'm not
playing field hockey, I'm playing golf.

I'm so inexperienced so I've got to get
my butt in gear and play a ton of tour
naments."
It is somewhat of a travesty that
Hallock, one of Stanford's strongest
athletes, has not recieved any type of
scholarship. Even though field hock
ey is a varsity sport, they have none to
give.
"When I came [to Stanford] I just
totally fell in love with the school. I
didn't even know if we were going to
have a program for four years," she
explains. "I just wanted to go to
school here for the education. I knew
I would not be playing field hockey
after college."
A leader by example, Hallock has

earned the respect of coaches, players
and fails across the country.
"You learn so much just by watch
ing her," said Cardinal freshman
Amy Marfil. "And she is always will
ing to help you."
The Stanford field hockey team is
currently 8-7, with Hallock almost
single-handedly outscoring oppo
nents. For example, she has more
goals thim the entire Berkeley team
and more than twice as many goals jis
the entire University of Pacific squad.
In a word, she is awesome.
"Sports have always been a huge
part of my life," Hallock reflects. "I'm
a really competitive person. If I didn't
have sports I would go crazy."
They call her Ice.
Some say it's because she is so cool. Others say it's
because when the pressure is on, she has ice in her
veins. But the real reason is iceberg lettuce. For twelve
years, the field hockey team has been giving out fruits,
vegetables, herbs or spices as nicknames for the incom
ing freshman, and Sara Hallock was given iceberg let

tuce.
"They wanted to call me ice because I'm cool," Hal
lock said, laughing. "It's tradition. I don't know why
they gave it to me but it stuck."
A glimpse at Hallock's room leaves no doubt that she
is both celebrated and busy. The walls are covered with
Nike ads, field hockey promotions and a blown-up pic
ture of her on the cover of a field hockey media guide.
There is also a white loft with a huge "Debbie" written
on the side.

"We bought it from someone, we were going to paint
it,"the senior explained.
Sara has an excuse for not painting the loft. She has
been busy dominating Division I field hockey. Hallock
has 24 of her team's 39 goals this season. Named an Ail-
American her junior and no doubt her current senior
year (her 50 points rank her third nationally in scoring),
Hallock has proven that she is one of the best players in
collegiate field hockey.
Scoring goals has never been a problem for "Ice." In
fact, she scored 102 of them in high school and 50 her
senior year. Yet she remains modest.
"Before high school, I had never heard of field hock
ey," said Hallock. "I started playing because because
soccer is in the winter in California and I didn't have
anything to do in the fall."
Hallock has always been coordinated. At the age of
18 months, to the amazement of her parents, she would
climb and swing on jungle gyms. As a child she played
baseball, Softball and soccer.
Furthermore, Sara always seems to come through in
the clutch, no matter what sport she competes in.
"She used to play softball and she was all right," said
Sara's father. "But when her team got to the champi
onship she went five for five with five of the team's
seven hits."
Sara's father makes it easier for her to be modest.
"My dad has pretty much been the driving force
behind every athletic thing I've done. He taught me how
to do everything," Hallock said. "When we are playing
golf, he'll sit there and talk to someone about me like
I'm not even there. He'll go on and on. Its made me a
really modest person just because he totally brags about
me to everyone."
Hallock has been Stanford's leading scorer since her
freshman year.
"She is a scoring machine," said Cardinal head coach
Sheryl Johnson. "Her ball-control skills are incredible
and she can evade a defender almost 100 percent of the
time."
Once she evades her defender, it is usually bad news
for opposing goalkeepers, as her blistering shot is dead
ly-
"She finds a way to get it in," her father explains.
"She just turns on the jets and the game changes. When
she gets the ball, look out and don't get in her way."
"She is a really strong team leader. Not only is she
strong on the field but she has a presence off the field
that has been a real asset to the team," said senior tea
mate Gina Bianchini. "Whatever she does, she does
well. It's fun to watch her because she knows how to

play the game. Sara does it right."
Sara also knows how to play golf.
After taking a tournament golf class,
Hallock caught the attention of the
men's golf coach.
"He told me I should try out,"
Hallock said. "So I did."
Needless to say she made the
team, which further cut into her free
time.
"I don't really have time for any
thing," Hallock said. "When I'm not
