# Wildfires destroy homes, rage through Southland
## 80,000 acres charred; arson suspected 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Wildfires driven by
searing desert winds torched more than 450 homes
and buildings, charred more than 80,000 acres,
emptied a city and made a living hell of wealthy
suburbs and rural hamlets throughout Southern
California yesterday.
Authorities ordered the evacuation of all 24,500
residents of Laguna Beach, 40 miles southeast of
Los Angeles, as flames consumed block after block
of the town last night.
Another fire threatened the Wild Animal Park

in northern San Diego County, where zookeepers
evacuated 26 endangered California condors and
four Andean condors.
A man was arrested for investigation of starting
one fire, and authorities suspected that other de
structive blazes were the work of arsonists.
By late last night, 13 large fires fanned by hot,
dry Santa Ana winds gusting up to 70 mph were
burning from Ventura County to the Mexican bor-
der. The fires fed off vegetation
baked to a crisp in the rainless
summer.
Fifteen firefighters were
injured, three critically.
Gov. Pete Wilson declared a
state of emergency for Los Angeles,
Ventura, Orange, Riverside and
San Diego counties.
Amid the confusion, over
whelmed firefighters ran out of
water and called for reinforce
ments, and helicopters made dar
ing water drops in futile efforts to
douse burning homes.
Smoke and ash eclipsed the sun
over downtown Los Angeles, free
ways and schools were closed, and
wind-borne embers picked out
homes at random, quickly engulf
ing roofs in flame.
In Orange County, a 2,500-acre
wildfire that started in Irvine raced
down Laguna Canyon to the coast
line, destroying an estimated 100
expensive homes and buildings in

northern Laguna Beach, fire offi
cials said.
At dusk, a separate Fire in the
same area raged through El Morro
Beach mobile home park north of
Laguna Beach, destroying at least
60 homes. Both blazes were
believed to have been deliberately
set, officials said.
Stubborn flames devoured
scores more homes well into the
night. "Hundreds (of homes) is
probably not too tar-fetched," said
county fire spokeswoman Kathleen
Cha.
By evening, all 24,500 residents
of the 5.6-square-mile town of
Laguna Beach were under orders
to get out. Officials set up shelters
in nearby cities for the evacuees.
"I'm watching the helicopters
dip their buckets in the ocean to
desperately try to get water and it
all seems to no avail," said Laguna
Beach resident Jan Fisher. "It's
really pathetic and sad here."
Earlier, as many as 75 homes
and buildings were destroyed or
damaged in Altadena, a suburb
northeast of Los Angeles in the
foothills of the San Gabriel Moun

tains.
"They said, it's coming up the
canyon! It's coming up the canyon!'
so we just got out of there as fast as
we could. I have nothing but what
I'm wearing," said Sandra Bohlen,

whose three-bedroom Altadena
home burned.
The Altadena fire was allegedly
started by a homeless man trying
to keep warm early yesterday,
authorities said.
