## The
						trials and tribulations of a baseball-card collection 
### 
Do you see that Dodgers cap down
below? I started wearing that cap as a
freshman in high school.
As a sophomore in high school, I tacked
up my first Nolan Ryan poster to clash with
the delicate pink-rosebud wallpaper in my
room.
That same year I helped my school soft
ball team achieve an unprecedented 0-10
record, while ruining two pairs of pants and
a dozen pairs of socks learning how to steal
second base. A year later, I was mingling
with the sweat-stained jocks on the side
lines, covering the football beat for the
school paper.
If my mom wanted to scold me for being
a tomboy and very unladylike, why didn't
she do it for any of those reasons?
Instead, she had to go and pick on the
most enterprising of all my sports-related
endeavors — baseball-card collecting.
Now, baseball cards have always been
my pride-and-joy, the redeeming factor
after every Dodgers pennant race lost in
mid-March, after every strikeout in softball
and after every lackluster midterm here at
Stanford.
I took a minimum-wage fast-food job in
high school just to be able to buy every
recent card on the market. I have all my
baseball cards filed in a computer database.
I can cross-reference any player, with any
year, with any stat, with any team and pro
duce every card I have of that ballplayer.
Dodgers pitcher Orel Hershiser, you
ask? I have three of every card ever made of
him, except for his 1985 Topps rookie card
and his 1987 Donruss card. Those I only
have two of.
Where are my Don Mattingly's, you

wonder? Card No. 8 of the 1984 Topps
series is sitting side-by-side with every
other rookie card that year. The rest of his
94 cards are sealed in a plastic box, which I
purchased for the low, low price of $15.

Where are my Jack McDowell's or even
my Nolan Ryan's? I have 19 Jack McDow
ell rookie cards (Donruss and Topps traded
combined), filed in the White Sox team
folder. Nolan gets his own folder, where his
$85 1975 Topps card (No. 500) is sitting all
by itself under layers of plastic protective
covering.
My most recent acquisitions, card No.
35 of the Leaf series, a Mike Piazza rookie
card (valued at six dollars) and a 1993 Fleer
Ultra Piazza card worth the same amount,
are presently sitting in my room, waiting to
be shipped back home and united with the
other over-priced rookies cards that came
out this year.
Overall, I don't see how my mom can
complain about a collection that is worth
almost 30 times my initial investment. Any
broker or small company would be flabber
gasted with such a annual yield. And unlike
tenuous real-world investments, baseball

card values can somewhat be predicted and
anticipated.
I took an inventory after the 1993 World
Series ended and calculated my collection's
net worth to be almost 10 percent of my
Stanford tuition this year.
Don't get me wrong here. I'm not ready
to go out and pillage Wall Street with my
investment savvy, or even impress my par
ents with a handsome check. In fact, I have
made more than my share of mistiikes
when it comes to baseball cards.
During my sophomore year in high
school I fell madly and deeply in like with
the first friend who ever swindled me. Allan
sold me a Kirk Gibson 1981 Topps rookie
card for $10 — a real gyp considering the
card was in horrible condition and a brand
new one was worth only four dollars any
way.
On top of that, he tried to unload a Bill
Madlock "autographed" card for $13. It
turns out that the card was neither valu
able nor authentically signed.
How shallow can I get, to judge a person
by his baseball cards?
I almost gave into my mom at that point
— selling the cards and becoming the debu
tante my mom always dreamed I would be.
Delicate pink rosebuds sounded somewhat
appealing compared to the humiliation and
heartbreak that had accompanied the base
ball cards.
My mom thinks I'm childish, just
because I have quadrupled my collection
since that year. Hey, don't worry. I'll grow
out of this, mom — I swear.
But in the meantime, I'm looking for
a mint condition Sandy Koufax rookie
card. .. .
