# Looking for the next Eric Swann
## Air-It-Out comes to campus 
### Vanessa Arrington 
The National Football League will
be scouting for talented football play
ers at Air-It-Out, a flag football tour
nament to be held Nov. 6, 7, 13 and 14,
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day.
The Intramural Department is
sponsoring this event, which will occur
on the IM fields, between Embarcadero
Road and Churchill Avenue.
Four teams of five people will be on
the field at one time, according to Scott
Reiss, an IM staffer. Teams will consist
of players from all over the San Fran
cisco Bay area, including Stanford stu
dents. The tournament is open to any
one over eight years old, even profes
sional football players. According to
Kevin Jeffrey, student director of
Intramurals, there will be four divi
sions in the tournament, based on abil
ity.
The winning teams from both week
ends will play each other to determine
the San Francisco Bay Area Champion.
This team will compete in the NFL Air-
It-Out Championship in Miami, sched
uled for February 1994, which will air
on ABC's "Wide World of Sports" on
Aug. 13, 1994.
Sherry Fosthumus, Intramural
director, predicts there should be
between 300 to 400 teams competing,
with perhaps as many as 5,000 specta
tors. At an Air-It-Out tournament in
Los Angeles prior to the Super Bowl,
there were about 30,000 spectators.
There also will be a carnival on the
fields, entitled "NFL Experience," with
activities geared toward football such
as punting, catching and running com
petitions.
The entry fee for each team is $100.
The IM department will receive a por
tion of this money, though most of the
proceeds go to the NFL. After covering
the costs for prizes, promotion and
"NFL Experience" equipment, the

NFL will donate the excess money to
charities. Such charities include the
San Francisco 49ers Community Out
reach Program which helps the home
less and tackles neighborhood issues,
according to Michael Olmstead, presi
dent of USA Productions, the organiza
tion producing Air-It-Out.
The IM department will be given
four Super Bowl tickets from the NFL
as a partial payment for use of the
fields. These tickets, along with airfare
and hotel accommodations, will be auc
tioned off at the Red and White athlet
ic fundraiser, according to Jim Brun
gard, assistant athletic director. The
money received will then be put toward
Stanford athletic scholarships.
The IM department will be responsi
ble for providing 25 volunteers to set
up, run and clean-up the carnival dur
ing the first weekend of the tourna
ment. The men's and women's fencing
teams and women's lacrosse team will
be in charge of the following wt?ekend.
The IM office will be using the money
they raise to help purchase office sup
plies, according to Jeffery. Air-It-Out
will be a fundraising activity for the
fencing and lacrosse teams as well.
The NFL will be running television
and radio ads to advertise Air-It-Out.
Locally, IM staffers have been passing
out flyers at Stanford football games
and putting them in display cases all
over campus, and will be displaying
three large promotional banners at
various locations.
Flag football is like regular football,
except players wear belts with velcro
(lags which must be grabbed to signify
a tackle.
Anyone interested in participating
in Air-It-Out can still go to the IM
Office to register a team. The deadline
to register for the tournament the first
weekend is Friday, Oct. 29; the dead
line for the second weekend is Friday,
Nov. 5.
