# On Movies, Memorabilia and My Underwear Ed Yoon

If some guy in a lab found that the sacri
fice of vestal virgins multiplied sales at
the box office, movie production com
panies would be dancing frenetically
around trees and lopping off heads by the
thousands. But until then, marketing wiz
ards like those behind "The Nightmare Be
fore Christmas" do something just as dubi
ous — hawk pajamas, t-shirts and boxer
shorts at Macy's.
Alongside your "Nightmare" boxers at
Macy's you can also find their Spartan
collection of "Northern Exposure at
Macy's" garb. So while strolling the bitter
ly cold streets of Palo Alto that suck the
very life from your bones, you can look
like some poor bastard forced to scratch
out a cruel existence in a godforsaken vil
lage in Alaska.
The power of celluloid is such that peo
ple will, against their better reason, buy corn
flakes associated with Kevin Costner, lie
down in the middle of freeways to prove
they're macho and set fire to their homes. I
have no desire to own a pair of "Nightmare"
boxers, but if we assume the unholy mar
riage between product lines and films shall
continue — and there's not a note of evi
dence that they won't — here's some prod

ucts that I'd like to see because I'm sure they
just can't lose:
•"Mad Max" at Neiman-Marcus: A nice
collection of post-nuclear holocaust active
wear that also works for the evening because
such distinctions just don't operate after an
atomic conflagration. This line comes com
plete with apocalyptic underwear and paja
mas. Functional, grungy, hip.
•"Thelma and Louise" and Smith and
Wesson: Women don't appreciate firearms
like guys do, but with Gina Davis' and Susan
Sarandon's angelic mugs engraved on the
butt of the Blackhawk .47 Magnum, it's big,
feminine and has a huge kick. Definitely not
purse-sized, it comes with several target
posters including an offensive truck driver
who has the mud flaps decorated with
naked women, a would-be rapist in a red
neck bar and a lame husband who lies on
the couch all day. Comes in pink, peach and
ecru.
•"Like Water for Chocolate" at Taco Bell:
A great romance film with food, and

penned by an authentic Mexican writer.
Wed that to a 89-cent Burrito Supreme with
a cup of cocoa made with water and watch
the crowds bloom. Not only does the water
cut down on costs, it's nifty. And for those
magic moments, the cocoa could be special
ly prepared at each table for birthdays, wed
dings and office parties.
•"The Seven Samurai" at McDonald's:
Akira Kurosawa's crowning epic provides
instant recognition for a lineup of breakfast
sushi-like products made from ham and
cheese, one named for each samurai. Might
throw in a few fortune cookies as well and
chopsticks shaped like little swords. Could
be nice to get Toshiro Mifune to do a promo
bit with Ronald McDonald.
•"The Crying Game" at Victoria's Secret:
For those of us who possess substantial se
crets ... an enchanting line-up of sexy yet
forgiving undergarments that help prolong
the air of mystery until it's way, way, way too
late. Comes with free air-sickness bag.
•"The Last Temptation of Christ" break

fast cercal: Wouldn't you be tempted as
well by the taste of the corn on one side and
wheat on the other? Purple crosses, yellow
doubting Peters, red Pontius Pilates and
magenta Judases come together for a tasty,
high fiber and theologically appropriate
part of your Lord's breakfast. Comes with a
bike reflector of St. John the Baptist.
• "The Seventh Seal" chicken tenders at
Kentucky Fried Chicken: Deep-fried and
full of 100 percent breast-meat goodness
shaped like Death, Max von Sydow as the
Knight and various minstrels, this product
is sure to attract the more cerebral types for
an existential meditation as opposed to a
banal experience at a competing fast-food
outlet.
The above products represent only
the tip of the consumer iceberg, as
you can well imagine. "Apocalypse
Now" surfboards, "Gandhi" loincloths,
"Alive" pet food — it's the multidimension
al associations and visual images that are
able to elevate a prosaic, everyday mug or
frozen dinner into an object of lust, an ob
ject of meaning.
So pull out those wallets, and let the mass
marketing begin. ■
