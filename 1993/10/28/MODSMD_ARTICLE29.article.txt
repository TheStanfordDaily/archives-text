# Suede Redefining the pop rebellion
## 
### Victor Haseman 
The musical den behind the Warfield
Theater's main stage is loud to the
point of inaudibility, but that doesn't
keep electric bassist Matt Osman from
fishing a familiar tune out of the dis
tortion-heavy sound check for one of
the bands performing with Suede, the
British pop band he co-founded back in the late
'80s.
"Do you know Chris Bell?," he asks. Noting
that the name affects no change in the facial ex
pressions of the interviewers surrounding him,
he repeats, "Chris Bell," in an attempt to jog our
sleepy — or perhaps clueless — brains. "He was
in Big Star. Do you know Big Star?"
"You don't know your own musical heritage,"
Osman exclaims, bathed in disbelief. "There's an
American band called Big Star, who's got Chris
Bell, and this," he says, almost drowned out by the
vibrating distortion on stage, "is one of his songs.
If you ever get a chance to hear it, it's absolutely
great..." I Am the Cosmos' by Chris Bell."
As much as the British native fancies himself
a crack musician, he's been an avid listener even
longer. lie and co-founder Brett Anderson used
to sit in Anderson's college apartment, listening
to old Beatfes and Smiths records in between
their own jam sessions and performances before
empty venues. But that was a long time ago.
Today Suede commands a British following
ready to accompany them to the ends of the
earth — and then jump off into the void. Before
their self-titled debut album dropped, Suede had
already planted three Top 40 singles on the U.K.
charts, including the R.E.M.-like "Animal Ni
trate," which debuted at number seven.
Surprisingly, Osman is rather nonchalant
about the band's climb into the limelight." [Our
success] was quite a steady thing. We just grew
through word-of-mouth, really, and that's quite
hard to do in Britain because Britain is media
obsessed. It wasn't really a surge. People think
that your succe**tart#irom the first time you're
on the front cover ofamagaane, which in com
pletely untrue. It was just a Steady growth "
But there's another important ingredient in
the Suede mix — audience participation. Get
ting the most from a Suede show demands active
participation. Most fans know the lyrics to every
song the band has ever performed; and this prac
tice dates back to before the album. They weep
and throw themselves lovingly on the band's
four members.
"People involve themselves in [our] gigs,"

pipes Osman proudly, "actually performing
rather than just consuming. They get lost in the
music, which is really important to us — we
couldn't survive doing tours if it was just us
knocking through a few tunes and a whole lot of
people going 'Uh.'
"I hate when you see a band and it's like kind
of a dictatorship and they're just stumbling
through their songs with a few people. A really
good gig should be like 1,004 people performing
and four of 'em just happen to be on stage. We
expect the crowd to be prepared and to dress
themselves up and to have spent the last two
weeks getting ready for [our show]. There's got
to be that circuitry there; there's got to be some
sort of connection between us. Otherwise it's
just a marketing exercise and we might as well be
on MTV
But don't think Osman, Anderson and com
puny haven't experimented with the musk-video
medium. Suede's just aren't 14) to snuff, admits
thebassist Of course a dull video has yet to snub
the success of Music Television. What's dipped
Suede's wings is the fact that the band's sound
weirds out American listeners more often than it
pleases them. Neither Billy Joel nor Sonic Youth,
Suede's British pop sound just can't seem to find
a comfortable spot in a polarized American mu
sical market.
And Osman agrees that Suede really doesn't "fit
in with the American underground in any way at

all. If I hear our records on American alternative
radio we sound really bizarre. I'm used to Britain
where we sound like a pop band. You hear us on
national radio and it's like no big deaL"
Over here, its funny. We sound less out-of
place in mainstream, FM radio than we do next
to Pearl Jam. There's a musical grammar in the
States, post-Nirvana, which we haven't really got
a lot to do with."
And that musical grammar wants nothing to
do with the mainstream. It's down with rebellion,
distortion and anything counter-cultural. Ar
guably, Suede's music feeds off a similar vibe.
Osman and lead singer Anderson, two work
ing-class kids from Hayward's Heath, began their
careers in music while Still enrolled as students in
the 1 ondon School of Economics and University
College London.
With the Smiths, the Beatles and other pop
and punk outfits as inspirations, the duo would
sitannmdfor hours listening to the their tnusi
cal Kero«andthen they'd experiment with their
own stuff. Osman would accompany Ander
sons vocals on bass and piano, and together
they'd perform "sad singer-song-writer" num
bers.
The trouble was, remembers Osman, that
their efforts were "just fuckin' awful. I used to be
lieve in the whole 'punk myth,' that you just got
up there and did it." That all changed after lead
guitarist Bernard Butler joined the outfit. Butler

forced both Anderson and Osman to take the
whole thing more seriously. And they did. The
fact that none of them had ever performed in
bands prior to Suede did present some unique
problems. After uniting with drummer Simon
Gilbert, the group proceeded not only to learn
their instruments, but to learn how to play as a
group as well.
"A lot of the reason why no one took any at
tention of us," remembers Osman, "was because
we weren't very good. The kind of band we are
... we're based around songs rather than
grooves and noises. It's boring but you have to
learn how write songs, you have to learn how to
perform, to be a band... you have to learn how
to play together. And we didn't realize that"
But Suede was fortunate. Unlike many of their
pop-band contemporaries, relative obscurity gave
them a chance to make mistakes in private. In
Britain, explains Osman, bands get signed to labels
very quickly. Few have a chance to build under
ground followings or release more than a few
records on independent labels. If you're not hip
enough for British pop fens to snap you up straight
away, consider your band D.OA
"We were lucky that didn't happen to us," ad
mits Osman, "because we were so unfashionable
when we started out We had our mistakes in
fiont of five people in the dark, whereas tons of
British bands made their mistakes on their first
albums or in front of 10,000 people."
But now that Suede has finally grown into a
comfortable, well-adjusted quartet of extremely
popular musicians, what's next? Taking a bite
out of America, obviously. Certain that a trip to
the U.S. would end up a disaster, Suede has ap
proached their North American tour with ex
treme delicacy. To their surprise, however, their
time in the states has proven to be entertaining
ly eye-opening. Furthermore, they have found
American listeners, comically more open than
they expected. j§F *
"I never realized," Osman exclaims, "that
America was about 30 different countries that
randomly just have the same money and the
same TV station and that's about it It's really
funny, because we came ofhere expecting not to
be liked and not to like it and we've been pleas
antly surprised on all accounts — especially the
West Coast. There's a real openness, from Van
couver right down to San Diego, (which) for
some reason I really like." ■

British pop band he co-founded back in the late
'80s.
"Do you know Chris Bell?," he asks. Noting
that the name affects no change in the facial ex
pressions of the interviewers surrounding him,
he repeats, "Chris Bell," in an attempt to jog our
sleepy — or perhaps clueless — brains. "He was
in Big Star. Do you know Big Star?"
"You don't know your own musical heritage,"
Osman exclaims, bathed in disbelief. "There's an
American band called Big Star, who's got Chris
Bell, and this," he says, almost drowned out by the
vibrating distortion on stage, "is one of his songs.
If you ever get a chance to hear it, it's absolutely
great..." I Am the Cosmos' by Chris Bell."
As much as the British native fancies himself
a crack musician, he's been an avid listener even
longer. lie and co-founder Brett Anderson used
to sit in Anderson's college apartment, listening
to old Beatfes and Smiths records in between
their own jam sessions and performances before
empty venues. But that was a long time ago.
Today Suede commands a British following
ready to accompany them to the ends of the
earth — and then jump off into the void. Before
their self-titled debut album dropped, Suede had
already planted three Top 40 singles on the U.K.
charts, including the R.E.M.-like "Animal Ni
trate," which debuted at number seven.
Surprisingly, Osman is rather nonchalant
about the band's climb into the limelight." [Our
success] was quite a steady thing. We just grew
through word-of-mouth, really, and that's quite
hard to do in Britain because Britain is media
obsessed. It wasn't really a surge. People think
that your succe**tart#irom the first time you're
on the front cover ofamagaane, which in com
pletely untrue. It was just a Steady growth "
But there's another important ingredient in
the Suede mix — audience participation. Get
ting the most from a Suede show demands active
participation. Most fans know the lyrics to every
song the band has ever performed; and this prac
tice dates back to before the album. They weep
and throw themselves lovingly on the band's
four members.
"People involve themselves in [our] gigs,"

pipes Osman proudly, "actually performing
rather than just consuming. They get lost in the
music, which is really important to us — we
couldn't survive doing tours if it was just us
knocking through a few tunes and a whole lot of
people going 'Uh.'
"I hate when you see a band and it's like kind
of a dictatorship and they're just stumbling
through their songs with a few people. A really
good gig should be like 1,004 people performing
and four of 'em just happen to be on stage. We
expect the crowd to be prepared and to dress
themselves up and to have spent the last two
weeks getting ready for [our show]. There's got
to be that circuitry there; there's got to be some
sort of connection between us. Otherwise it's
just a marketing exercise and we might as well be
on MTV
But don't think Osman, Anderson and com
puny haven't experimented with the musk-video
medium. Suede's just aren't 14) to snuff, admits
thebassist Of course a dull video has yet to snub
the success of Music Television. What's dipped
Suede's wings is the fact that the band's sound
weirds out American listeners more often than it
pleases them. Neither Billy Joel nor Sonic Youth,
Suede's British pop sound just can't seem to find
a comfortable spot in a polarized American mu
sical market.
And Osman agrees that Suede really doesn't "fit
in with the American underground in any way at

all. If I hear our records on American alternative
radio we sound really bizarre. I'm used to Britain
where we sound like a pop band. You hear us on
national radio and it's like no big deaL"
Over here, its funny. We sound less out-of
place in mainstream, FM radio than we do next
to Pearl Jam. There's a musical grammar in the
States, post-Nirvana, which we haven't really got
a lot to do with."
And that musical grammar wants nothing to
do with the mainstream. It's down with rebellion,
distortion and anything counter-cultural. Ar
guably, Suede's music feeds off a similar vibe.
Osman and lead singer Anderson, two work
ing-class kids from Hayward's Heath, began their
careers in music while Still enrolled as students in
the 1 ondon School of Economics and University
College London.
With the Smiths, the Beatles and other pop
and punk outfits as inspirations, the duo would
sitannmdfor hours listening to the their tnusi
cal Kero«andthen they'd experiment with their
own stuff. Osman would accompany Ander
sons vocals on bass and piano, and together
they'd perform "sad singer-song-writer" num
bers.
The trouble was, remembers Osman, that
their efforts were "just fuckin' awful. I used to be
lieve in the whole 'punk myth,' that you just got
up there and did it." That all changed after lead
guitarist Bernard Butler joined the outfit. Butler

forced both Anderson and Osman to take the
whole thing more seriously. And they did. The
fact that none of them had ever performed in
bands prior to Suede did present some unique
problems. After uniting with drummer Simon
Gilbert, the group proceeded not only to learn
their instruments, but to learn how to play as a
group as well.
"A lot of the reason why no one took any at
tention of us," remembers Osman, "was because
we weren't very good. The kind of band we are
... we're based around songs rather than
grooves and noises. It's boring but you have to
learn how write songs, you have to learn how to
perform, to be a band... you have to learn how
to play together. And we didn't realize that"
But Suede was fortunate. Unlike many of their
pop-band contemporaries, relative obscurity gave
them a chance to make mistakes in private. In
Britain, explains Osman, bands get signed to labels
very quickly. Few have a chance to build under
ground followings or release more than a few
records on independent labels. If you're not hip
enough for British pop fens to snap you up straight
away, consider your band D.OA
"We were lucky that didn't happen to us," ad
mits Osman, "because we were so unfashionable
when we started out We had our mistakes in
fiont of five people in the dark, whereas tons of
British bands made their mistakes on their first
albums or in front of 10,000 people."
But now that Suede has finally grown into a
comfortable, well-adjusted quartet of extremely
popular musicians, what's next? Taking a bite
out of America, obviously. Certain that a trip to
the U.S. would end up a disaster, Suede has ap
proached their North American tour with ex
treme delicacy. To their surprise, however, their
time in the states has proven to be entertaining
ly eye-opening. Furthermore, they have found
American listeners, comically more open than
they expected. j§F *
"I never realized," Osman exclaims, "that
America was about 30 different countries that
randomly just have the same money and the
same TV station and that's about it It's really
funny, because we came ofhere expecting not to
be liked and not to like it and we've been pleas
antly surprised on all accounts — especially the
West Coast. There's a real openness, from Van
couver right down to San Diego, (which) for
some reason I really like." ■
