# Roaring blaze worries students from area
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
The blazes sweeping through
parts of Southern California are
more than 400 miles away, but
some Stanford students have
not escaped their devastating ef
fects.
"They had to evacuate the en

tire town," said sophomore Fred
Gilbert, who lives in Laguna
Beach. "We won't know about
my house until the fires die
down.
"I've seen houses of people
that I know and they're com
pletely gone," he added.
At least one student's house
has already been destroyed by

the fires, and many others are
fearful that theirs will be next.
"The fire was a block and a
half from our house when 1 last
talked to my parents" said senior
Jennifer Triehwasser. "My mom
was evacuated and my dad
couldn't get home from work be
cause the roads are blocked off."
She added that the fire has
already destroyed her high
school. "From what I've heard,
these fires have really devastated
Laguna Hills."
Students also said they have
had trouble contacting their fam
ilies because of widespread evac
uations and downed telephone
lines.
"I live very close to the fires,"
said sophomore Greg Defelice, a
Laguna Hills resident. "When I
tried to call home ... I got a mes
sage saying the fires have inter
rupted phone service."
Triebwasser said she experi
enced similar difficulties when
trying to contact her mother. "I
haven't been able to reach her
because she's so close to the fires,"
she said, adding that her parents
have called her several times.
"My parents called me from
Lucky's," said Erinn Johnson,

who also lives in Laguna Hills.
"There are a number of people at
that Lucky's giving each other
support.
"It's bumper to bumper traf
fic," she said. "My parents are
having trouble leaving the area to
find a place to stay."
Though many students'
homes are in danger from the
fires, some can breathe a sigh of
relief tonight because their
homes have been spared by the
fires.
"We live right on the coast and
we're west of the fires," said
Defelice. "The fires are moving
south, so our house will probably
be OK."
Laguna Hills resident Mckee
Colsman-Freyberger, a fresh
man, said the fires will probably
not affect his house either.
"I called my parents earlier
today and they have the hoses
ready," he said. "But they live
pretty far south and near the
beach. . . . From the looks of it,
we won't have to worry about the
fires."
