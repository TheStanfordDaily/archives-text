# NYREE
## arthy folk talent nergizes campus music scene

As I knock on her door to begin the inter
view, Nyree continues to fiddle with her
guitar. She seems intense, content on
strumming her instrument She doesn't
notice me standing in the doorway.
Even from this brief glimpse of Nyree Rabushka
you can tell the 20-year-old folk musician is eager to
play her music. She's definitely a departure from the
typical Stanford senior graduating with a degree in
economics. Instead, she is one of the most successful
student musicians at Stanford.
"I have this burning need in me to do [music],"
says Nyree. "When I'm not playing music, if I take a
break from it, it just feels like something's gone. It's
something I have to do."
Nyree's sound seems to be the synthesis of four
components: passion, independence, ambition and
confidence. These qualities feed off one another, dri
ving her toward her goal of having music as the guid
ing principle of her life.
Passion seems to be the first part of her melodious
puzzle. Nyree's passion is both a combination of in
nate talent and its cultivation.
Like many kids, she started out playing the piano
at her parents' wishes. It was through this first expo
sure to music that she indirectly found her musical
identity. "I hated the [piano] lessons a lot," Nyree re
calls. "The piano teacher was a classical teacher, but
he realized I was a little restless [ with classical music ].
He wanted me to try a little singing and it turned out
to be something I had a natural ability for."
She first picked up the guitar when she was a junior
in high schooL Certain musical influences, like Joni
Mitchell and her father's records from the '60s, along
with parental support for experimentation combined
to spark her transformation into a musical creature.
However, freedom seems to be another important
factor in her growth. "The nice thing about the guitar
is that you can really take it places. That's one of the

things which really threw me into guitar," Nyree says.
And music provides Nyree with an outlet for her in
dependence. After stints during sophomore year in a
band called Fated Flower and as musical director of the
a cappella group Counterpoint, Nyree has decided to
forego the group dynamic and launch out on her own.
"You would think working together [as a group]
is a big creative meeting of the heart and mind. Well,
it's not. Everyone wants to do things a certain way.
Everyone has certain goals to achieve and whether
that benefits the group or them, I don't know," Nyree
says. "To be honest, I am a solo artist. 1 want to ben
efit me. And I'm happy doing that."
Still, she has the luxury of performing with talent
ed artists with whom she feels comfortable. Occa
sionally backing Nyree on her demo tape and in live
performances are pianist Michael Hallas and musi
cian / engineer Jay Mason. They have helped Nyree
move toward to the day when she gains total control
over her music, from the technical to the aesthetic.
The combination of her yearning for musical free
dom and natural passion has nurtured a sense of de
votion to her goals. Right now, her plan includes as
many live performances as she can fit in her schedule.
Over the summer she hammered out a demo, pro
duced at CCRMA studios at the Knoll, which displays
a surprisingly refined sound. With it, Nyree covers a
wide range of folk sounds.
Her remakes of three Shawn Colvin songs pro
vide Nyree a chance to prove how well her voice is
adapted to singing faster paced songs. The tape gets
off to a speedy start with "Diamond in the Rough,"
giving Nyree the opportunity to showcase her vocal
range with the gritty recitation of the verses and the
smooth chorus.
In comparison, Nyree's original songs are more
introspective and a little more mellow. Still, emo
tional and vocal intensity are very evident, especially
in "Big City." The song deals with the complications of

relationships, both the
happy and sad sides of
them. With "Big Gty,"
Nyree captures a more

varied sound, switching speeds often. The rousing
piano backing plays off of the guitar work and rising
vocals to achieve a nice effect. The lyrics are almost vi
sual, providing a clear background to the ideas in the
song. It's easy to paint a picture in your mind of some
solitary soul thinking about love.
With the contemplative quality of the lyrics, it's
not surprising to find Nyree's muse in them. For in
stance, she sings in "Tale:" "It's question people ask
and they say / 'Ny, why so sad?'... And all 1 know /Is
that songs just come out that way."
Such lyrics show her confidence, not only in bar
ing her soul to an audience, but also in her wish to be
in control of her music. "I used to be a lot more prone
to what people said about my songs," Nyree confess
es. "Now, I feel good enough about my songs that if I
think it's good, it doesn't matter [what other people
think] because it means something to me."
Her first performance at Bay City Coffee Roasting
Company (that place next to Tower where it seems ail
of Palo Alto's dyed-hair teens converge) is a case in
point And while such a crowd might have been in
timidating, Nyree played through her set, making
fans out of the angst-ridden teens.
"My friend overheard them [the Bay City crowd]
talking and that basically the response was that they
wanted to hate me, but they were sitting there thinking
'Darn, she's good,'" she recalls. "I could tell that there
were certain songs that I really got the alternative
teenage crowd's attention.... I feel like my music is
adaptable to crowds and I do adapt my shows."
Even playing to a more accepting crowd, Nyree's
energy and confidence are evident, as she displayed in
a CoHo performance last Saturday. Billed as "Stan
ford's Ballad Queen," she entertained a crowd of
friends and onlookers to originals and covers covering
a wide variety of musical styles.
"The great thing about a lot of places is that be
cause I play such varied stuff... it seems to fit every
one. People can pay attention when they want to and
can like what they want," Nyree explains.
The versatility of her rich voice allows her to pull off
this difficult task At one moment, she might be singing
slow-tempo melody, like the ones in her original "You
and Me." At another, she could be bawling toward the
end of Tori Amos' "Little Earthquakes." What's im
pressive is her ability to maintain a high level of intensi
ty during her three-hour show.
And concentration. Amidst the buzz of conversa
tion and coffee machines, Nyree performed a rous
ing rendition of one of her most evocative original
tracks, "Big City."
At the end of this frenzy of live experience, she
wants to make a CD and then think about hooking
up with a manager. The goal of the live shows is to
hone her sound. "By the time I get to management, I
want to be such a strong performer that they can't say
no," Nyree declares.
At the heart of her lofty goals is the hope that she
can make a living and a life out of music. She'd like to
follow in the steps of one of her musical favorites, the
Indigo Girls, making CDs on a label and playing at
large venues like the Warfield. "I would like to play at
places like Mem Aud. That's the kind of plan I have
for me life," she says."I would really enjoy that."
What is perhaps most striking about Nyree's drive
for success is the lack of qualms she has regarding her
life. There is no mention of "what if I don't."
She has absolute faith.
"If I do make a CD, probably half of it will just be
one instrument, one voice. I think that the sound can
be amazing. It's so good on some people's stuff that
sometimes you don't realize that's all there is."
For Nyree, a voice and a guitar are all she needs.®
