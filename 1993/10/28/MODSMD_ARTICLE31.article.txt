# 13STEPS to Nowhere: the Widow Winchester's Mansion

### 
Mire fun house than haunted house, the
prawling Winchester Mystery House
hould scare no one but architects. Every
though, its magnificent chandeliers and
priceless Tiffany lamps are extinguished, and only a
flashlight comes between the resident undead and you,
the trespassing mortal.
Touring this "beautiful but bizarre" structure is
less of a roller-coaster ride than a brisk hike through
the dark and twisted mind of its creator, Winchester
Rifle heiress Sarah Winchester.
Following the sudden, tragic deaths of her hus
band and infant daughter, Mrs. Winchester, an am
ateur occultist, took the advice of a Boston medium
and headed west, eventually settling in an 8-room
San Jose farmhouse in 1884.
By the time of her death in 1922, the house had
grown to 160 rooms — the largest private residence
of its time. For the medium had warned the widow
that unless she kept her house ringing with the sound
of hammers, the ghosts of the Winchester Rifle's count
less victims would rise from their graves to kill her — as
they had killed her husband and child.
Thirty-eight years and five million dollars' worth
of construction later, Mrs. Winchester died peaceful
ly, leaving her tangled legacy behind for posterity to
unravel. You, too, can try to decipher its web of psy
chic symbols and paranormal booby-traps on daily
guided excursions, or by the glow of flashlights on the
annual Halloween tour.
By ghosts, f°" gkosts
It's a house built by ghosts, for ghosts. The only
mortals to ever inhabit these crooked walls were the
owner, her niece and a staff of 40-plus servants, gar
deners and carpenters. Mrs. Winchester supervised
each enigmatic detail of construction herself, rely
ing on the advice of the otherworldly architects she
consulted in nightly seances. Her goal was to con
fuse evil spirits while appeasing friendly ones.
Above all, construction must never cease.
Thus, the perpetually unfinished masterpiece is
a maze of unbridled Victoriana: rooms built within
rooms, windows installed in ceilings and floors,
trap doors, gables, turrets, pointless recesses and
secret passageways to nowhere. Floor and ceiling
levels change drastically, often within individual
rooms.
Most of the time, it's impossible to guess which
part of the building you're in, which floor you're
on, even whether you're outside or in. And, de
spite the guide's warnings, there's an ever-present
temptation to open closed doors. You could meet
a wall, a ghost, a 30-foot drop — or the late Mrs.
Winchester herself.
Untieing cmd sinister
Despite its massive scale, the structure is all but

invisible from Winchester Blvd., except for its rambling,
blood-red tiled roof. Behind the cobweb-shaped gates,
tall rosebushes peek over high hedges — a facade at once
both enticing and sinister.
A perky tour guide in Doc Martens and a floor-length,
pseudo-Victorian skirt greets you at the back door — the
only one Sarah Winchester ever used, even when her cof
fin was carried out.
Already, there's something wrong with this picture.
Take the row of doors in front of you. One leads to a brick
wall; another is scaled to Mrs. Winchester's height — a
scant four feet, ten inches. Next to it, a diamond-shaped
window wards off malevolent demons. (There are nearly
10,000 windows in the house, most of them offering views
0f... more house.)
You follow the guide up the first of many narrow pas
sageways to the "goofy staircase," which ascends straight
to the ceiling. Although this is the only one included with
in the tour, your guide assures you that several staircases
in the house come to similarly abrupt endings.
Next, you pause to admire a glassed-in storeroom full
of unused tiles, Tiffany windows, light fixtures and bolts
of wallpaper — millions of dollars of materials in all. Ob
viously, Mrs. Winchester planned to keep construction
going for many years — perhaps into eternity.
You descend 13 steps to the thirteenth bathroom, only
partially completed at the time of Mrs. Winchester's
death. The room boasts 13 windows and the only shower
in the house, custom-sized to Winchester's diminutive
frame. In case you haven't figured it out by now, the guide
notes that "13 is thought to have been Mrs. Winchester's
favorite number."
Indeed, the number 13 and its mystical multiples can
be found in almost every room of the house. Drains have
13 holes. Walls have 13 panels. Windows have 13 panes.
Staircases have 13 steps. Chandeliers have 13 candles.
You're beginning to see a pattern here.
/Mot wKat it seems
Back in the thirteenth bathroom, a hush falls over the
group as your guide too-cheerily announces "our next
stop, the room where Mrs. Winchester died."
Despite this morbid distinction, the master bedroom is
easily the most beautiful room you've seen so far. Costly tex
tured wallpaper covers the walls and ceiling, while a rose
patterned carpet and oak herringbone woodwork deck the
floor. A massive carved wood bed dominates one comer.
You take some comfort in the fact that this is not the
actual bed Mrs. Winchester was sleeping in when she died
of heart failure at 83. That bed was sold along with the rest
of Mrs. Winchester's furniture shortly after her death.
What you see is a reproduction. A handful of rooms on
the tour have been similarly restored.
Conveniently located near Mrs. Winchester's bed
room is "the heart of the house, the seance room." Upon
entering, the seance room is not the ghostly den you ex
pected, but a disarmingly cheerful collection of sunny
windows and sparkling white walls with blue trim.
On closer inspection, though, ominous details become

apparent. The black hooks jutting from one wall number
13, one for each of Mrs. Winchester's seance robes. What
looks like a closet turns out to be a secret exit. An innocu
ous-looking door opens onto a 20-foot drop — into the
kitchen sink. Next to it, an interior window allowed the
notoriously nosy mistress to spy on her servants below.
Not everything is what it seems in the Winchester
Mystery House; in fact, it's safe to assume that nothing is
what it seems. In the linen room — a calico-papered en
clave resembling nothing so much as a I .aura Ashley store
— enormous redwood cabinets are inexplicably painted
to resemble bird's-eye maple.
At one point, the group titters with excitement upon
learning that it is about to see "the most expensive win
dow in the house." Unfortunately, that window occupies
a gloomy landing with no light source — in fact, it looks
out directly onto another wall. You can only guess at the
brilliance it might have achieved in different setting.
TvJenovatior\s and innovations
Working your way to the front of the house, you pass
through a series of rooms damaged by the earthquake —
the 1906 earthquake, that is. Here, much of the plaster is
chipped away, taking the wallpaper with it. Beautiful Vi
ennese stained glass windows — intact, if warped — seem
sadly out of place in these ruined caverns.
The "crystal bedroom," originally named for its fantas
tic, glittering wallpaper, has been reduced to a bunch of ex-

posed beams. A hole in the floor marks the spot
where a fireplace once stood, before it crashed
to the room below. Antique photos show the
house as it was prior to the earthquake, seven
stories high instead of the current four.
After the quake, the literally shaken Mrs.
Winchester had the front section of the house
boarded up, and retreated further into her
fortress. Many of the rooms, including two large
basements, remain too damaged to tour

safely.
You pass a servant's bedroom
(about the size of a dorm room) on the
way to the fourth-floor balcony, which

offers spectacular views of the multilevel

roof with its cupolas, skylights and bell

tower, which summoned servants to supper
and spirits to midnight seances. Behind you, a
chimney stops just inches short of the ceiling,

rendering four stories worth of fireplaces in
operable.
Descending to the first floor, you find
yourself at what was once the back door

of the original eight-room farmhouse.
Behind you, a hallway stretches out of
sight to the current back door.

Mrs. Winchester's renovation was so com
plete that it's impossible to tell just how much of

the original structure remains. Indeed, during con
struction, many rooms were added or remodeled only to
be torn out and replaced. As many as 750 different
rooms may have been built over the years.

As you wander through the restored rooms, you may
find yourself more impressed by their modern conve
niences than their anachronisms. The house contains three
elevators, countless bathrooms, electrical wiring, a char
broiler, plus several of Mrs. Winchester's own innovations.
At the touch of a button, Mrs. Winchester could sum
mon any one of her servants to any room in the house. Or,
she could speak with them through a web of voice tubes.
With 24,000 square feet of living space, conveniences like
these could be considered necessities.

.Lost treasures
You proceed to the formal front rooms where Mrs.
Winchester would have received guests, if the reclusive
widow had ever entertained. In the parlor, pink and gold
stained glass windows cast rainbow stripes onto the floor
and furniture. Four different types of wotxl are visible in
the ornate floor, which took one hapless carpenter a year
to assemble — probably because he didn't use nails. Be
hind you, a hollow above the doorway stands empty.
Whatever treasure it once held is lost.
You pause at the base of the main staircase. If you
glance up, you can catch another view of the priceless,
wasted window. On your right, two sets of furniture —
one full-sized, one miniature — crowd the living room.
On your left is the stately ballroom, smaller than you'd ex
pected, and darker — despite the expensive German

chande
lier with its cus
tomized 13 candles.

You dodge an in
verted post in the cabi

net room (all the posts in the '
house are installed upside-down, to confuse

evil spirits) to reach the mustard-colored servants'
kitchen — one of six in the house.
But this kitchen is the only one with its original, enor
mous gas stove and hot water heater intact. Mrs. Win
chester's patented sink with hinged drain hoards is here,
as well. An innovative serving window opens directly
onto the dining room. It all seems quite harmless and ef
ficient, until you realize that the windows above your
head open directly onto the seance room.
In the dark, redwood-paneled dining room, shimmer
ing in the light of a few Tiffany lamps, the guide sums up:
"You've just seen a beautiful but bizarre mansion con
taining 950 doors, 10,000 windows, 17 chimneys, 47 fire
places, 40 bedrooms, 3 elevators, 6 kitchens, 376 steps and
52 skylights — but just that one shower." She also points
out that you've walked more than a mile in all, viewing
110 of 160 rooms.
The tour's only exit leads directly to the gift shop,
which rivals the house itself in its magnitude. There, you

can
buy

au
thentic

Winchester
Ammo Boxes or

wander through the tiny
Antique Products Museum,

housing Winchester roller skates, flashlights

and fishing tackle, as well as a model of the Winchester
House "immortalized in gingerbread." There's a Firearms
Museum, two cafes and a self-guided garden tour as well.
But the mystery lies in the house itself, or, rather, in its
creator. Was Sarah Winchester really acting on behalf of
the undead? Are the house's irregularities the product of ar
chitectural ignorance, or careful deliberation? Was she
crazy, or merely eccentric?

Very shrewd, or very scared?
The answer is — and will re
main — a mystery. ■
