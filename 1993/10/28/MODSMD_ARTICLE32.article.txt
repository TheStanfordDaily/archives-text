# On the road back to Nashville
## Robert Altman recycles past glories with 'Short Cuts' 
### 
Wide is the rift between great and
mediocre films, and any critic worth his
weight in celluloid is hip enough to be aware
of this. Still, no one wants to risk being the
solo voice on the wrong side of the chasm, es
pecially when discussing the works of a wide
ly celebrated director.
fake Martin Scorsese's "Age of Inno
cence," for instance. Even the harshest of re
views have been slow to scrutinize the drag

ging third act of his turn-of-the-century New
York story. The genius associated with his
name carries with it the suggestion that all
things Scorsese are beyond reproach, absent
of flaws.
Sadly, the soft-handed pop criticism em
ployed in addressing "Age of Innocence" is
now likely to be recycled for another cele
brated director. For reviewers still recovering
from the sinister satire of his revival hit "The

Player," all things Robert Alt man are to be
equally lionized ... including "Short Cuts,"
the director's latest three-hour spectacle.
A bittersweet ode to life in a decaying Los
Angeles, "Short Cuts" falls in the tradition of
the I-have-a-love / hate-relationship-with-
New York aesthetic popularized by Scorsese,
Woody Allen and Spike Lee — minus the
near-religious awe normally afforded a con
crete jungle equally imposing and inspiring
in its multi-layered urbanity.
Improvising upon the short stories and
poetry of writer Raymond Carver and armed
with a witty yet sneaky loathing for his psue
do-documentary subject, Altman has opted
to go everywhere he's been before. The 22
characters his story follows instantly recall
the 24 characters of "Nashville," his quirky
masterpiece from the '70s — right down to
its day-in-the-life ambiance.
Both seek desperately to display everyday
life in all of its random, comical tragedy. Both
enlist their soundtracks as vehicles for narra
tive progression. Both unify their crowd of
characters through a series of over-arching
events. So why docs "Nashville" work so
much better than its ambitious, literary kid
sister? Narrative, narrative, narrative.
Arguably, "Short Cuts" is best understood
as a jazz composition in three movements.
The first movement introduces the harmon
ic voices and the melodic motifs that string
them together. The second erects a musical
conflict ripe for dramatic resolution. And the
third seeks to lay the conflict to rest in a man
ner pleasing to the audience.
Interspersed between wide-angled shots
of a dark, noisy, helicopter-littered sky, Alt
man introduces the inhabitants of an L.A.

county besieged by fruit flies. I.APD officer
Gene (Tim Robbins) and his wife Sherri
(Madeline Stowe) engage in a tender mo
ment of shouting, while across town, Sherri's
sister Marian (Julianne Moore) and hubbie
Ralph (Matthew Modine) chat with another
pair, Claire and Stuart (Fred Ward and Anne
Archer), about a possible dinner date during
Zoe's (Lori Singer) cello recital. And at a
night-club venue, Tess (Annie Ross), the cel
list's mother, jazzes it up.
Is it as choppy for you as it was for me?
Good, because the rest of the first movement
fares no better. And while Altman's and
screenwriter Frank Barhydt's re-interpreta
tion of Carver's dark wit make for occasion
ally precious, comic moments, "Short Cuts"
rambles on vaguely through movement two
before sprawling to an ungratifying halt at
movement three's end.
The problem lies somewhere between an
odd assortment of performances, an unfo
cused narrative that accomplishes in 187
minutes what could have easily been accom
modated in 30, and a flagrant neglect of the
film's major character: Los Angeles, the city.
Absent also are the traditional Altman-isms
— the improvisational feel of performances,
the unique layerings of sound, the coinciden
tal feel of character interactions; in short,
everything that made "Nashville" such an
oddly wonderful experience.
What's left is a cutaway diagram of Alt
man's directorial prowess and a bunch of sto
ries and a poem more entertainingly busy
then poignantly literary.

poetry of writer Raymond Carver and armed
with a witty yet sneaky loathing for his psue
do-documentary subject, Altman has opted
to go everywhere he's been before. The 22
characters his story follows instantly recall
the 24 characters of "Nashville," his quirky
masterpiece from the '70s — right down to
its day-in-the-life ambiance.
Both seek desperately to display everyday
life in all of its random, comical tragedy. Both
enlist their soundtracks as vehicles for narra
tive progression. Both unify their crowd of
characters through a series of over-arching
events. So why docs "Nashville" work so
much better than its ambitious, literary kid
sister? Narrative, narrative, narrative.
Arguably, "Short Cuts" is best understood
as a jazz composition in three movements.
The first movement introduces the harmon
ic voices and the melodic motifs that string
them together. The second erects a musical
conflict ripe for dramatic resolution. And the
third seeks to lay the conflict to rest in a man
ner pleasing to the audience.
Interspersed between wide-angled shots
of a dark, noisy, helicopter-littered sky, Alt
man introduces the inhabitants of an L.A.

county besieged by fruit flies. I.APD officer
Gene (Tim Robbins) and his wife Sherri
(Madeline Stowe) engage in a tender mo
ment of shouting, while across town, Sherri's
sister Marian (Julianne Moore) and hubbie
Ralph (Matthew Modine) chat with another
pair, Claire and Stuart (Fred Ward and Anne
Archer), about a possible dinner date during
Zoe's (Lori Singer) cello recital. And at a
night-club venue, Tess (Annie Ross), the cel
list's mother, jazzes it up.
Is it as choppy for you as it was for me?
Good, because the rest of the first movement
fares no better. And while Altman's and
screenwriter Frank Barhydt's re-interpreta
tion of Carver's dark wit make for occasion
ally precious, comic moments, "Short Cuts"
rambles on vaguely through movement two
before sprawling to an ungratifying halt at
movement three's end.
The problem lies somewhere between an
odd assortment of performances, an unfo
cused narrative that accomplishes in 187
minutes what could have easily been accom
modated in 30, and a flagrant neglect of the
film's major character: Los Angeles, the city.
Absent also are the traditional Altman-isms
— the improvisational feel of performances,
the unique layerings of sound, the coinciden
tal feel of character interactions; in short,
everything that made "Nashville" such an
oddly wonderful experience.
What's left is a cutaway diagram of Alt
man's directorial prowess and a bunch of sto
ries and a poem more entertainingly busy
then poignantly literary.
