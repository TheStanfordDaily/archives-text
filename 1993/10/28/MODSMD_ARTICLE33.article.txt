## Fearless 
### 
In the suspended moment when disaster
strikes, when the end is imminent and un
avoidable, then one can say, "This is it — this
is the moment of death — I have no fear."
Max Klein (Jeff Bridges) thinks thusly
when his plane experiences hydraulic failure,
plummets out of the sky and explodes in a
cornfield in the Central Valley. Klein is the
hero of "Fearless," a deeply complex and
emotional film that explores the meaning of
being both an intrepid, courageous hero and
an uncertain, traumatized human being.
Following the crash, Klein returns home
to his loving wife Laura (Isabella Rossellini)
and son Jonah, but all sense of normalcy has

disappeared from his
life. He is surround
ed by a haze of disori
entation, a height
ened sense of reality
that makes the expe
rience of his sur
roundings vivid and
acute to the point of
fantasy.
Inspired by the
life-jeopardizing or
deal, Klein becomes
truly fearless and be-

lieves that he is invincible. High atop a San
Francisco skyscraper, he recklessly dances on
the edge of its roof; and despite his deathly al
lergic reaction to strawberries, he eats them
with sensuous delight.
As Klein slips away from his wife, he finds
himself drawn to another crash victim, Carla
Rodrigo (Rosie Perez). Perez's Carla is a de
vout Catholic who has fallen into deep de
pression over the death of her son. As "one
crash freak to another," Klein reaches Carla in
ways the doctors, her family and even God
cannot, becoming her personal angel.
Rafael Yglesias' script is remarkable,
proving the strong foundation on which a
talented cast and crew develop poignant and
complex portrayals of grief and coping. Di
rector Peter Weir uses a hazy, ethereal form
of photography to capture the critical mo
ments of the film, which is accentuated by
the eerie and other-worldly music of Hen
ryk Gorecki's "Symphony of Sorrowful
Songs."
Nevertheless, the most striking aspect of
"Fearless" is Bridges' stellar performance. He
wholeheartedly steps into the shoes of an
atypical Hollywood character and ultimate
ly creates a very real person of human con
tradictions and fragility. So while his Hous
ton-bound flight may have crashed and
burned, Bridges as Klein definitely flies high.
