"The Beverly Hillbillies" is not an intelli
gent movie.
Instead it's a lazy stroll down memory lane
into nostalgia-land, led by the terminally stu
pid sitcom family.
By no means is the film perfect, but from
the point where the soundtrack begins "Lis
ten to a story about a man named Jed / a poor
hungry creature but he kept his family fed /
until one day he was shooting at some
grub...." it evokes thoughts of watching
"Hillbillies" reruns with my kid brother.
For the pop-culture clueless, the story
goes as follows: Jed, his mother "Granny," his
daughter Elly May and his nephew Jethro
take off for Mecca (otherwise known as Bev
erly Hills) after Jed accidentally locates a
gushing oil well Then, the not-too-intelli
gent-but-now-extremely-rich family creates
tension through their social blundering. For
example, in the movie Jed (Jim Varney)
searches for a wife to teach his tomboy
daughter how to be a sophisticated woman,
while others search for a way to separate the
Clampetts from their money.
Despite the lack of sophisticated plot, sev
eral cast members turn in stupendous perfor
mances. Cloris Leachman is almost unrecog
nizable as the white-haired, hillbilly doctor

Granny. And as the efficient Miss Hathaway
and the dopey cousin Jethro, veteran Lily
Tomlin's and newcomer Diedrich Bader's hu
morous personas are unparalleled.
But Erika Eleniak's appearance makes it
impossible for anyone to buy her as a 16-
year-old, however dumb she may in fact be.
Unfortunately the "Hillbillies" are not very
enlightened in respect to their views on women
and the elderly. For example, poor Granny
takes more abuse than the plot suggests she
should. And the camera can't seem to focus
enough on Elly May's breasts — solely for the
sake of engaging (or exciting?) male viewers.
But despite its flaws, " The Beverly Hillbil
lies" remains a fun trip through the time
warp machine. So as the theme song invites,
"Gome on back now, ya hear?"
But no sequels... please.
