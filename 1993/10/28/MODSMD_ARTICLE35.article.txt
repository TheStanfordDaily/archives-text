## Jazz mixes it up with hip-hop on "Rebirth of Cool" 
### 
What's cool?
Cool is a style of jazz made popular by
Miies Davis, among others, in the early '50s.
Cool is smooth and silky sounding, laid
back, hip, West Coast jazz centered around
tentatively arranged pieces rather than free
form improvisation.
"Rebirth of Cool," on the other hand, is a
compilation of artists playing contemporary
soul and jazz; 10 tracks by artists working to
ward a shared vision of a new musical spirit.
The album's aim is to combine jazz tech
niques with more modern approaches, and
many of the tracks hit the mark by incorpo
rating improv, lots of soulful vocals, sam
pling and hip-hop rhyme.
But what is "Rebirth of Cool" really? Is it
jazz? Funk? Top 40? Alternative? Soul? R&B?
None and all of the above. Although the
album flows smoothly between music types,
"Rebirth" is a compilation that lacks a defin
itive voice. From song to song rhythmic and
melodic emphases change, but while sounds
differ the goal remains the same.
Ronny Jordan's "Bad Brother" gives the
album a progressive flavor, with its free
form blues guitar riffs, solid dance beats
and sampled sounds. The mix gives it a
feel very similar to Living Colour's
"Funky Vibe."
"Bad Brother" helps the album make a
smooth transition from rap-jazz to dance
jazz. Along with the Stereo MC's moody,
Latin-hip-hop cut "Fever," it is perhaps the
album's second-best track. Entirely instru
mental, "Fever" uses jazz piano and brass to

create sounds, chords and tempos associated
more with remixes than improvisational
jams.
Freestyle Fellowship's "Inner City Bound
aries" answers the question, "What the hell is
jazz-rap?" with astounding precision. The
vocals are rhythmic, incorporating scat-like,
Bobby McFerrin improvisations, and the in
strumentation (upright bass, piano, drums
and vibes) recalls the classic combos of the
cool jazz movement. Righteous. Righteous.
Righteous. Period.
Two tracks incorporate the mixing of
sounds and styles so well that classifying
them is impossible. They're best described by
the moods they create. "Caroline," an iiber
seductive track that moves from smooth to
smoother, features the crooning rhymes of
Frenchman MC Solaar in his native tongue.
Picture Inspector Clouseau — in trench coat
and full undercover regalia — standing at a
bar drinking a Perrier with one hand and
twisting his pencil-thin mustache with the
other. He looks at your butt and winks. 'Nuff
said.
To understand the feel of the Subter
ranean's "Taurus Woman," picture yourself
in the lounge of the local Holiday Inn. On the
stage, surrounded in rings of heavy smoke
and a backdrop of red velvet, comes a sound
that is hip, and I mean hooka-smoking
caterpillar hip. Hands down it's the best track
on the album.
The most energetic piece is Loud Minori
ty," which ties "Caroline" for cultural
uniqueness. Performed by United Future Or-

ganization — a
deejay threesome
hailing from Tokyo
— this track main
tains the jazz atti
tude of the compi
lation, relying
heavily on piano
and trumpet riffs to
carry the improvi
sational and cre
ative weight of the
piece. Coupled
with a Latin beat,
lots of percussion,
and a ringing sleigh
bell for added flare,
it's an ace in the
hole.
"Rebirth of
Cool" is excellent
most of the way
through, with only
three tracks really
missing the point
with their commer
cial, Top 40 sounds.
While it represents
the emergence of a
new musical style,

it's not really the rebirth of cool because it de
nies itself the freedom of true improvisation.
Though many of the pieces have free-form
passages, they sound like they were hand
picked from a slew of multiple takes. But if
"Cool" 's songs spend more time in the edit

bay than on the recording floor, they're still
very rich in flavor. If you like funk and the
clean sounds of a crafted and well-thought
out compilation, then dish out the dough.
R&B step aside, "I&R" has arrived.

just one of a host of tracks that successfully push the jazz/rap en
velope on the new compilation "Rebirth of Cool."
