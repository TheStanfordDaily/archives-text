## "Be Bop or Be Dead" Umar Bin Hassan 
### 
Ex-Last Poet Umar Bin Hassans new
album "Be Bop or Be Dead" isn't for the
faint of heart or for those with PC inclina
tions. It's for those who like Afro-centric
music with thick beats, prefer music laced
with militant messages and dig musicians
who tell it like they see it.
On the album's first cut, "Niggas Are
Scared of Revolution," Hassan's hypnotic
delivery, a rapping style more poetic than
clever, flows over pulsating African drum
beats with political savvy. He cites what he
sees are the failings of African-Americans;
mainly, the fear of change. But like a caring
father figure, his swift and harsh reprimand
is underlined by love.

Hassan's method
of composition goes
back to the days of
Nikki Giovanni,
when poetry was
written and then set
to music, making it
more accessible to
the masses. And like
Giovanni's music,
Hassan's shares
nothing in common
with those sappy

R&B love songs they play over and over
again on KMEL. In "Be Bop or Be Dead"
Hassan's message overpowers his musical ac
companiment without ever undermining it.
From track to track, Hassan's delivery
stays fairly consistent. At the beginning of
each phrase the words leave his mouth in a
monotone. In the middle, he crescendos,
makes his point, and then decrescendos.
Adding to the mix, he backs his rhymes
with background vocals that work sublim
inally for all save the most discerning lis
teners.
However, he docs change-up musically.
"Be Bop Or Be Dead" recalls Guru's
"Jazzmatazz," only it's more militant. For
example, the tunes "AM" and "Love" bor
row their swing from the jazz tradition,
while "Pop" combines American folk
music with African vocals. Then Hassan
turns the tables again for the R&B ish
"Malcolm."
Throughout "Be Bop or Be Dead," Has
san takes sound bites from our American
cultural landscape and puts them together
to form vivid images of a deteriorating
American society. As a result, sometimes the
lyrics are combined randomly. Although
this fact may annoy or confuse listeners, it
helps to create the type of images that give
you chills: "Niggas love the word fuck. Nig
gas fuck fuck fuck."
While "Be Bop or Be Dead" is a great lis
ten, don't expect to hear any of its tracks on

pop radio. But that's what makes it special:
Hassan isn't afraid to say what he has to say,
and he says it well.
