# "Respect" Shootyz Groove
## 
### 
Are you in the mood for a unique mesh of
heavy-metal guitar, drums and rap lyrics?
Then put away those Dr. Dre and An
thrax albums and get ready for the eclectic
heavy metal funk of Shootyz Groove. On
their debut EP "Respect," the band creates
an irresistible head-banging, rump-shaking
collage of sound reminiscent of Run
D.M.C.'s early fusions of rock and rap (the
album "Rock Box" and later the runaway
single "Walk This Way").
On "Buddahful Pay," the EP's "love
song," the Groove's five members (Sense,
Season, Dose, Donny and Spec) sing the
praises of herbal cigarettes with lyrics like,
"If you got 'em, smoke 'em, if you got 'em. .
. . Gotta legalize / people all around the
world / feel the effects of the high." Vocal
ists Sense and Season throw out catchy
lyrics that reverberate through the mind
while the rest of the band lays down hard
hitting guitar riffs and rhythms that radi
ate raw energy.

In most cases, Shootyz Groove's instru
mentation frames their lyrics. The band re
lies heavily on a formula of simplistic and
repetitive rhymes broken up by extended
musical improvisations. And with Donny
on guitar, Spec on bass and Dose on "tribal
rhythms," electrifying tracks like "Buddah
blessed" and "Soulfreak" seldom disap
point.
Unfortunately, the formula works
against them as much as it works for them.
Tracks like "Rockin' in the Wilderness" and
"The Craze" leave much to be desired. Fur
thermore, after listening enough times to
"Buddahful Day," "Buddahblessed" and
'Rockin' in the Wilderness," three tunes
that praise the affects of marijuana and get
ting high, we start to wonder if Shootyz
Groove is more interested in describing
their various drug abuses than wowing lis
teners with integrity-laden musical
arrangements.
But this doesn't turn "Respect" into an
all-out disaster. The F,P is stuffed full of
memorable grooves that are sure to inspire
even the most ardent of wallflowers to slam
dance ... or at least think about slam-danc
ing.
Shootyz Groove uses just the right pro
portion of ingredients — occasionally crude
lyrics, crass bravado, fierce guitar and
booming bass — to create a rap / heavy
metal mixture worth sampling.
