# Gettysburg

### 
Although Ted Turner's mammoth "Get
tysburg" clocks in at over four hours, it feels
like you're there watching every minute of
the three-day battle the film depicts.
Presenting the critical battle that became
the turning point in the Civil War from the
officers' point of view, "Gettysburg" is based
on Michael Shaara's novel, "The Killer An
gels." Unfortunately, the script reads just like
the sugar-coated version of American history
that we swallowed in seventh grade.
There is no excuse for the film's length.
Many scenes — among them countless un
interesting landscapes and lingering pur
poseless close-ups — could have and should
have been cut.
Since you know what's going to happen on
the battlefield, the big question is which offi
cer gets to make the next saccharine soliloquy
about life, liberty, duty, honor, happiness,
etc. One particularly wincing scene occurs
when Union Col. Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels)
comes across a mute, hungry runaway slave
and takes the opportunity to show what a
sensitive guy he is.
Despite the misguided script, the main
cast is impressive and some performances
manage to shine. Particularly good on the
Confederate side are Tom Berenger as Gen.
Longstreet, who must obey orders against his
better judgment, and Richard Jordan as Gen.
Armistead, who portrays the anguish many a
man felt at having to fight against friends and
relatives. Under the Union banner, Daniels as
Col. Chamberlain manages to create a pow
erful impression as the educated man com
pelled to fight for idealism.
The film's major accomplishments are
recreating the battle at Little Round Top and
the infamous charge of Pickett's division. Al
though there is a illogical lack of blood and
gore, these scenes convey some of the horror
of a bayonet charge and the suicidal wheat
field slaughter. One has to give director
Robert Maxwell some credit for coordinating
the activities of thousands of extras. Origi
nally envisioned as a TV miniseries, these
battle scenes are the only justification for
bringing "Gettysburg" to the big screen, but
they comprise only about 45 minutes of the
final cut.
"Gettysburg" demonstrates the difference
between an accurate historical reenactment
and a good historical movie. By focusing on
reenacting each detail of the three-day battle,
the movie loses the powerful emotions that
could have made it interesting to more than
just the most dedicated Civil War buffs.
