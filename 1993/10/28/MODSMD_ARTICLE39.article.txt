# Mr. Wonderful

### 
The one unfortunate thing about love sto
ries is that their endings are pretty pre
dictable. So, to compensate, a film must pro
vide other stimulation for entertainment.
Such as humor, suspense, or whatever.
Director Anthony Minghella's romantic
comedy "Mr. Wonderful," doesn't accom
plish any of these. It just manages to be cute.
The film is plagued with gaping holes void of
entertainment value. And even while some of
the flick is humorous, there's hardly enough
material to merit the making of a movie.
Matt Dillon plays a tough guy, blue-collar
worker for Con Edison. He and Annabella

Sciorra are a couple whose young marriage
ends abruptly after Sciorra decides to go to
college to get a degree. They both adapt
quickly to single life. Dillon finds a steady
girlfriend (Mary-Louise Parker) who per
suades him to move in with her, while Scior
ra's character has her hands full with a pro
fessor / student affair with William Hurt.
The plot thickens when Dillon and some
of his buddies decide to reconstruct a run
down bowling alley. But his alimony pay
ments make it difficult for him to afford his
share of the deal.
So, the guys convince him to set his ex
wife up with random men in an effort to
marry her off as soon as possible. It's an ex
cellent movie thing to do. Of course, it
doesn't work out as planned. (Schemes on
the silver screen never do.)
Aside from the film's other flaws, the char
acters in "Mr. Wonderful" don't ever really
grow on you. Maybe it's Sciorra's big hair or
the perpetual red-nosed, teary-eyed look on
Parker's face that distracts from the storyline,
but it's difficult to feel for any of them.
Minghella ("Truly, Madly, Deeply") said
of his film, "People expecting the smooth
ride of 'Sleepless in Seattle' are going to be
surprised. There are bumps in this film. Its
romantic realism. Happiness comes at a
price."
Sure it does, but $7.00 is much too expen
sive.
