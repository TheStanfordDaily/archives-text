# Faculty, students planning protest over Webb Ranch
## 
### Jin W. Jung Staff writer 
Weeks after an announcement that Stanford will
no longer be involved with Webb Ranch, concerned
students and faculty are considering protests and
other activities to force the administration to accept
responsibility for the plight of the workers.
Political science Prof. John Manley and senior
Russell Calleros are planning a teach-in to inform
students and faculty of the situation of migrant
workers at Webb Ranch. They said they are also con
sidering a march on Casper's house.
University President Gerhard Casper told the
Faculty Senate on Oct. 14 that the University cannot
manage the ranch, which has been criticized in the
past for deplorable working and living conditions.
The 237-acre ranch, is located on Stanford land just
off Alpine Road near Interstate 280, and has been
leased to the Webb family since 1922.
"Casper is stonewalling," Manley said. "I think
this could be the beginning of an uprising. I think it's
completely up to the students because the adminis
tration has washed its hands and Casper wants this
issue to go away."
Manley said he believes that only if students voice
their outrage and act as a "moral beacon" to the fac
ulty, especially Latino professors, will administra
tors change their stance.

"Casper has said that he can't set the standard [of
humane conditions for migrant workers]. But I think
that if we can't raise standards then we don't deserve
to be called a university," Manley said.
Workers on the ranch receive slightly above mini
mum wage, and many are unable to afford health in
surance. Several of the University-donated trailer
homes in which they live lacked heat this past winter.
In February, San Mateo County health officials de
clared four of the homes to be "unfit for human oc
cupancy."
English Prof. Ron Rebholz, who has also spoken
out for the Webb Ranch workers, said, "Manley and I
are hoping that some students are really interested
in this issue. . . . We haven't been able to budge the
administration. Now we need a concerted effort on
the part of the students."
Student groups that have expressed interest in
the situation of Webb Ranch workers include
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino student group, the Stu
dent Environmental Action Coalition and the Stan
ford Homelessness Action Coalition. These groups
have decided to investigate the status of Webb Ranch
workers before taking action.
"The next step is to try to meet with the Webbs
themselves. After that, the plan of action will be
much more clear," Calleros said.
