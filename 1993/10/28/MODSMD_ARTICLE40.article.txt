# House of Angels
## 
### 
Ingmar Bergman films aren't the only
movies to come out of Sweden. In addition,
there's Colin Nutley's Oscar-nominated
"House of Angels" — an enchanting comedy
about inter-personal relationships in a small
town in Sweden.
The movie begins with the funeral of Erik
Zander (Per Oscarsson), the owner of a large
estate called "House of Angels." His neigh
bor, solemnly dressed in black, is smirking
with joy because he will at last have the estate
with its dilapidated old house in his grasp, as
Erik has no heirs. Imagine his surprise when
an attractive young woman, Fanny (Helena
Bergstrom), interrupts the funeral claiming
to be Erik's granddaughter and only heir.
Truly, the whole town is astonished by the
new "foreigners" — Fanny, with her seem
ingly outrageous actions and freedom from
societal norms, and Zac (Rikard Wolff), her
rakish companion with the earring, wicked
grin and decidedly uncertain sexual orienta
tion.
When Fanny decides to stay and rebuild
her grandfather's home, the differences be
tween the traveling pair and the staid towns
people lead to conflict. While the men find
Fanny interesting, the women talk about her
scandalously, going so far as to scrutinize her
grocery list. Small-town oddities — secret
rumba dancing parties, porno-flicks and
cabaret music — lend "House of Angels"
some subtle humor.
Despite the difficulty of communicating
through subtitles, "House of Angels" con
tains memorable performances. Bergstorm
gives Fanny depth, creating funny, sweet and
vulnerable sides. In addition, Wolff is hilari
ous as Zac, especially during scenes that focus
on his mysterious sexuality. For example,
when Fanny gets Morten (Jacob Eklund), a
handsome young man, to repair their house,

Zac gives him a sexy smile and says in a low
voice, "There's lots of work in my room, too."
As a director, Nutley deserves special cred
it for his musical selections, using beautiful
hymns to mirror and highlight the emotions
and events of his story. For example, songs of
rebirth parallel Fanny's arrival and her at
tempt to rebuild her grandfather's home.
Overall, "House of Angels" overcomes its
rather trite plot with strong acting and a
focus on the unique peculiarities of small
town life in Sweden which are also relevant to
our own lives.
