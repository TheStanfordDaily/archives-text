# Flesh and Bone
## 
### 
To be perfectly honest, "Flesh And Bone"
is a very easy film to dislike.
The movie opens with a flashback depict
ing a Texas family's sheltering of a young,
seemingly homeless boy for the night. Howev
er, as soon as the family falls asleep, the boy
unlocks the front door for his shotgun-toting
father and the pair begin robbing the house.
The two thieves have done this type of robbery
many times, but on this night the job goes
sour. The family wakes up, a gunfight ensues
and the family is slaughtered as the young boy
watches in bewilderment and disbelief.
Not exactly a fits-of-joy-inducing movie,
to say the least.
Instead it is an excellent portrayal of one
man's inability to escape his past, and ulti
mately fall victim to his hostile environment.
The film makes you think — a practice that

many moviegoers today seem to avoid at all
costs.
Dennis Quaid ("The Big Easy") stars as
Arlis Sweeney, the grown-up version of the
young thief, who is now roaming through
the Texas flatlands selling and stocking
vending machines. His nomadic way of life
stems from the abuse his father inflicted on
him as a young child and his subsequent de
sire to avoid becoming close to anyone ever
again.
James Caan ("The Godfather") gives an
excellent performance as his father, Roy, who
combines a truly evil side with a soft, father
like identity which he adopts to control his
son.
To counterbalance the harsh emotions be
tween father and son, "Flesh and Bone" also
has a romantic subplot. As Arlis performs his
normal routines, he comes in contact with
Kay Davies (Meg Ryan), a woman whose life
has been as dismal as his own. Davies, who is
in the process of leaving her husband, takes
off with Arlis to search for herself and possi
bly a place to settle down.
Despite the clever and intriguing interac
tions among Caan, Quaid and Ryan, the real
strength of "Flesh and Bone" lies in writer
and director Steve Kloves' ("The Fabulous
Baker Boys") ability to create a realistic story
with believable and comprehensible charac
ters.
Skip the 300-word action-adventure ex
travaganza for just one weekend and watch
"Flesh and Bone." And, please, don't forget to
think.
