A Bronx Tale
A manic-depressive movie of sorts,
Robert De Niro's directorial debut
fluctuates between moderately bril
liant and excruciatingly cliched mo
ments. It depends on the tired Mafia
mystique Hollywood seems to re
quire of any movie including Italians
and New York. But it's a lot more
than we would expect from a movie
that shamelessly repeats its theme
quote, "The saddest thing in life is
wasted potential." R
The Age of Innocence
Martin Scorsese may have learned
how to hobnob with the upper crust
of 19th-century New York, but he's
left his heart in 20th-century Little
Italy. Daniel Day-Lewis shines as
one-third of author Edith Wharton's
bizarre love triangle, but the script
and direction hang Michelle Pfeiffer
and Winona Ryder out to dry. The
verdict: aesthetic masterpiece, emo
tional misfire PG
Demolition Man
Snipes, Stallone, guns Despite in

tense predictability, "Demolition
Man" offers engrossing visual enter
tainment complete with gads of vio
lence. Director Marco Bambilla uses
a cheap script and two multi-million
dollar actors to satirically poke fun at
brutality's integral role in our soci
ety. Surprisingly he creates some
thing worth watching. R
Judgment Night
Presenting some fresh-out-of-ado
lescence good guys from comfy
suburbia who take a wrong turn on
the way to a boxing match and end
up in an urban wasteland presided
over by the evil Fallonn, "Judgment
Night" is a thrilling chase film with
out the thrills. Thoroughly pedestri
an acting and predictable plot twists
result in a total lack of anything even
approaching suspense. R
M. Butterfly
This adaptation of David Henry
Hwang's play could have been por
trayed as a pop-culture look at a
naive French diplomat deceived into
kinky sex by a conniving Chinese

freak-of-a-man, or a thoughtful criti
cism of popular perceptions of Asian
women and men. Fortunately,
Hwang's collaboration on the
screenplay and the ingenious deci
sion to cast John Lone ("The Last
Emperor") as Song Liling preserve
the intended societal critique R
Malice
Director Harold Becker attempts to
craft a suspenseful story but the re
sult is a series of complicated twists
that never seem to end. Plot turns
and acting are so exaggerated that
"Malice" seems almost like a come
dy. Whatever potential the film had
is lost because both writers and di
rectors try to include too many un
surprising surprise elements and
too much canned dialogue R
Mr. Jones
Not even God has much of a chance
fixing this mess masquerading as a
message movie about manic-de
pressive disorders and medical
ethics. Lena Olin and Richard Gere
threaten to violate both medical

morality and their own careers with a
boring romance — based on a trite
script — that we simply cease to
care about. R
Nightmare Before Christmas
Tim Burton's and the Walt Disney
Corporation s different management
styles lead to a remarkably uneven
film — the combination of Burton's
brilliant stop-action and Disney's
caution. Despite potentially intrigu
ing characters such as Jack
Skellington, the film is cold and un
moving — efficient, but heartless.
PG
Rudy
"Rudy" is so packed with schmaltzy
cliches and empty performances
that you're left wondering where the
story went. Though supposedly
based on a true story of a little guy
who struggled to get into Notre
Dame and play on its football squad,
the film is so far out in the la-la land
of Hollywood filmmaking that you re
ally don't care what it was based on
— you just want it to stop. PG
