# The
						last word on...
## Aladdin 
### 
Last Tuesday, I took a mo
mentous step in my development
as a human being ... I watched
"Aladdin" for the fourth time.
Don't take this lightly just be
cause by the fourth time you can
sing along with every song (be
cause of course you already have
the soundtrack after the first
time) and you know practically

every spoken line (thanks
to the second and third
time). While you might

annoy the few "Aladdin" novices,
the majority of viewers will be
right with you.
Once you go beyond the com
plex plot, you can concentrate on
the smaller details and more
philosophical ideas. Why is Jas
mine's hair thicker than her
waist? And does the monkey re-

ally steal the lamp from Jafar he
fore he gets pushed into the
crumbling Cave of Wonders?
Despite these unsettling mys
teries, it's obvious Disney has a
winner here. But for all you four
timers out there, life isn't over yet
— there's always the fifth view
ing.
