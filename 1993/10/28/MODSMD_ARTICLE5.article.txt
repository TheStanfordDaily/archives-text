Members of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education ad
dressed concerns raised by stu
dents about distribution require
ments and the commission's scope
at their first town meeting last
night at Roble Hall.
After making initial state
ments, they listened to several
students' worries that the com
mission is focusing too much on
practical matters such as Univer
sity finance, and in doing so is re
stricting options for change.
A handful of commission mem
bers were present to listen and re
spond to the concerns of about 15
students who attended the meet
ing.
Commission member John
Bravman, a materials science en
gineering professor, said the
group would try to maintain a
broad vision while recognizing the
financial constraints under which
the University operates.
Bravman said that "students
[have] pleaded that the commis
sion have a vision. [But] there's al

ways going to be some bounding
principles. There are finite re
sources. And that means that
there are things that we are going
to do and not going to do."
Commission chair James Shee
han said that although the group
will not make specific recommen
dations on how to allocate money,
they won't ignore certain broad
constraints.
"You want big answers, al
though in the end, I think there

sources are going to come back and
pull you down," he added after the
meeting.
But the history professor also
stressed that University President
Gerhard Casper has not placed
any restrictions on what aspects of
undergraduate education the
committee can tackle.

very supportive," Sheehan said.
"If we can't convince them that it
is going to work, it isn't going to fly,"
he said. "(But] we're our own body.
We're not devoting hours of our lives
to enact what other people want."
After the meeting, senior Greg
Gilchrist said, "I was a little disap
pointed because it seemed from the
professors that there were some deci
sions that had already been made
even though they didn't know they

had made those decisions."
The meeting also dealt with mat
ters more concrete than values and
the committee's scope. At the top of
students' list of concerns were distri
bution requirements. Students com
plained that previous administra
tions have piled DRs on top of each
other, with no consistent purpose.
Sheehan said the commission
would place the DR system under
much scrutiny, agreeing with stu
dents that the current framework is
not cohesive.
"I think the DRs are a bunch of
hurdles," he said. "And I think that
feeds into the anti-intellectualism

[on campus]."
Bravman expressed an even
stronger view, saying, "The DRs are
going to change — big time."
Sophomore Chloe Sladden said
she was surprised and dismayed by
the small number of students in
attendance, but felt that the meeting
was productive nonetheless.
"I thouglit some students raised
some really important questions.

the lack of student interest. I hope
more students take advantage? of

commission, and that] the apathy is
just temporary."
