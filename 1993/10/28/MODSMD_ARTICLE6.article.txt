# Stanford doctors report findings:
## Radiation therapy may lead to heart disease 
### Timothy M. Johnson 
A research team headed by
Medical School Prof. Steven
Hancock has reported that
Hodgkin's disease patients treat
ed with radiation therapy enjoy
substantially longer lives but
suffer a higher incidence of heart
disease.
In an article published yester
day in the Journal of the Ameri
can Medical Association, Han
cock, an associate professor of
radiation oncology, reports on a
study of 2,232 Hodgkin's pa
tients treated with radiation at
Stanford between 1961 and
1991.
The study found that, of the
290 eventual deaths unrelated to
Hodgkin's disease in that group,
88 were heart-related — a rate
three times higher than normal.
Risk was greatest for patients re
ceiving the highest radiation
doses, those receiving less
shielding of the heart and those
receiving radiation at the earli
est ages or over the longest peri
od of time.
Hancock pointed out that the

incidence of heart disease
dropped during the 30 year peri
od, due largely to a 1971 discov
ery that the radiation was caus
ing inflammation of the peri
cardium, or the lining of the
heart. That discovery led doctors
to use lead blocks to shield the
heart during much of the irradi
ation procedure.
A cancer of the body's lym
phoid tissue, Hodgkin's disease
was first treated with radiation
therapy in the late 19505. Stan
ford doctors were among the
first to use radical radiation
treatment and, in 1968, pio
neered the use of a combination
of chemotherapy and radiation
treatments. According to Han
cock, about 85 percent of
Hodgkin's patients will now be
cured using one of those meth
ods.
The study, co-authored in
part by Prof. Richard T.
Hoppe, acting chair of the De
partment of Radiation Oncolo
gy, is part of a "long-standing
department philosophy and
policy" to track the late effects
of radiation treatment, said
Hancock. The department has
previously studied effects of
radiation therapy in treating
thyroid conditions and breast

cancer.
"We're looking at improve
ments in technique, and at ways
of using radiation more safely,"
said Hancock. "The focus now is
to minimize and decrease toxici
ty from treatment, and we're
now using radiation less aggres
sively than in the past, and
studying less damaging thera
pies."
