Center has reason to celebrate
after the U.S. Senate overwhelm
ingly approved a bill containing
$36 million for the center's B fac
tory project yesterday.
The Senate voted 89-11 in
favor of the $22 billion conference
committee bill that contains the
funding for the SLAC project. A
similar bill passed Tuesday in the
House of Representatives in a
closer 229-190 vote.
"This is great. We've worked
five years for this thing to come to
Stanford," said Johnathan Dor
fan, project manager for the B fac
tory.
"This funding provides a
healthv future for SLAC and a
continuity for what has been a
world-class research program."
Only an unlikely veto from
President Clinton would stop the
funding for the construction of
SLAC's $237 million B factory,
now that the bill has waded
through both houses of Congress.
But Dorfan said he doesn't see
any reason for Clinton to veto the
bill. The president expressed his
support for the B factory project
when he announced in San Fran
cisco this month that Stanford

had been chosen as the site of the
project.
Both U.S. senators from Cali
fornia, Democrats Barbara Boxer
and Dianne Feinstein, voted for
the bill.
"The funding for the B factory
is an important project to aid in
the revival of California's econo
my," said Feinstein. "In some
cases, such as the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, revival means
maintaining the strength of exist
ing institutions that have helped
make California a world leader in
technology development."
According to Dorfan, the first
step in the project should begin
Jan. 1, when the present accelera

tor will be dismantled. Upgrading
the present SLAC facility to
include a state-of-the-art asym
metric B factory will take about
five years.
The new accelerator will col
lide electrons and positrons to
create rare subatomic particles
called B mesons, which could give
scientists insight into how the
universe was formed.
Dorfan said SLAC will spend
the next couple of months orga
nizing the project, now that SLAC
workers know the funds have
been appropriated. "We have the
technological program laid out,"
he said. "We know what we have
to do."
