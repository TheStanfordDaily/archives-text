For the record
An article printed in The
Daily on Oct. 27 titled "Back to
the future: Minority hiring
changes course" misquoted
Assistant Provost for Faculty
Affairs Kathryn Gillam as hav
ing said that the decision not to
grant History Prof. Gordon
Chang tenure was made with
curricular concerns — not diver
sity concerns — in mind. Gillam,
in fact, did not comment on
Chang's situation.
