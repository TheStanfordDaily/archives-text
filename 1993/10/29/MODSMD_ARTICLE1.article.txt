### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
No one travels the Far East like Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper.
Then again, few would want to.
Tomorrow, Casper embarks on a
breathless, 10-day jaunt to the Orient
that will include visits to three coun
tries, meetings with two heads of state,
the requisite doses of schmoozing, and
very little sightseeing.
"Basically, I will show the flag," he
said "The schedule is very busy."
The general purpose of the trip,
Casper says, is "to try to examine what
role there is for Stanford to play as a
Pacific Rim institution, which it quite
clearly is."
Casper will he accompanied by ofTi-

cials from the Office [
of Development and
"other parts of the
University."
Over the course of
his excursion, Casper
will make appear
ances in Tokyo,
Osaka, Taipei and
Hong Kong, giving *
"various speeches and

participating in panel discussions
about the future of higher education."
He will also meet with regional Stan
ford alumni groups, he said.
The centerpiece of the president's
trip will be his visit to the Stanford cen

overseas campus. "In the case of Japan,
the Kyoto center is of tremendous im

portance to Stanford," he said.
Casper stressed that there is "real
historical depth" in the University's
relationship with Japan, pointing out
that David Starr Jordan, Stanford's
first president, went there as earlv as
1900.
While in Japan, Casper will confer
with the country's newly elected prime
minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, and
members of the Japanese parliament
â€” five of whom are Stanford alumni,
he said.
During his stop in Taipei, Casper
plans to meet with Taiwanese presi
dent Lee Teng-hui.
"I will discuss issues of our relation
