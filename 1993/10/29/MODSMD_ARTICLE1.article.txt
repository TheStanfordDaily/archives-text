# Orient express
## Casper begins whirlwind Asia trip 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
No one travels the Far East like Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper.
Then again, few would want to.
Tomorrow, Casper embarks on a
breathless, 10-day jaunt to the Orient
that will include visits to three coun
tries, meetings with two heads of state,
the requisite doses of schmoozing, and
very little sightseeing.
"Basically, I will show the flag," he
said "The schedule is very busy."
The general purpose of the trip,
Casper says, is "to try to examine what
role there is for Stanford to play as a
Pacific Rim institution, which it quite
clearly is."
Casper will he accompanied by ofTi-

cials from the Office [
of Development and
"other parts of the
University."
Over the course of
his excursion, Casper
will make appear
ances in Tokyo,
Osaka, Taipei and
Hong Kong, giving *
"various speeches and

participating in panel discussions
about the future of higher education."
He will also meet with regional Stan
ford alumni groups, he said.
The centerpiece of the president's
trip will be his visit to the Stanford cen
ter in Kyoto, his first exposure to that
overseas campus. "In the case of Japan,
the Kyoto center is of tremendous im

portance to Stanford," he said.
Casper stressed that there is "real
historical depth" in the University's
relationship with Japan, pointing out
that David Starr Jordan, Stanford's
first president, went there as earlv as
1900.
While in Japan, Casper will confer
with the country's newly elected prime
minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, and
members of the Japanese parliament
— five of whom are Stanford alumni,
he said.
During his stop in Taipei, Casper
plans to meet with Taiwanese presi
dent Lee Teng-hui.
"I will discuss issues of our relation
ship | with Far Eastern nations], espe-

iJ : :
cially concerning our ability to bring
[to Stanford] and finance students
from those countries," Casper said.
In addition, Casper said he will
be "meeting with people of all
three countries that have gener
ously supported Stanford in the
past. They are interested to know
who the new president of the Uni
versity is."
Though he has been to Japan,
Taipei and Hong Kong previously,
Casper admits that he speaks nei
ther Japanese nor Chinese. And
though he said he has "read a lot
on the history of [Asian] cultures,"
Casper is aware of the daunting
possibility of a communication
breakdown.
"I'm reasonably well-informed,"

he said. "Unfortunately, if any of
the people I meet with speaks no
English, we are in trouble."
As for matters of cuisine, Casper
said, "My command of Chinese
menus is higher than Japanese
menus."
With his agenda chock-full of
public appearances, Casper con
cedes he will have very little time
for casual sightseeing. Although
he insists that statesmen qualify
— "they belong to the sights," he
said — the extent of his leisure
activity will be a visit to the impe
rial summer palace in Kyoto.
Casper saw the palace during his
last trip to Japan and was
"immensely impressed." He subse
quently snapped several pho
tographs of the edifice, only to dis
cover a fatal mental slip.
"There was no film in the cam
era," he said ruefully. This time,
Casper pledged, he will stock up.
