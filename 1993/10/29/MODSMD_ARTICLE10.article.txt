Aristide urges full embargo
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Haiti's ousted
president called yesterday for a total trade embar
go to force out the country's military leaders.
Jean-Bert rand Aristide, his hopes of returning
to power by this weekend all but gone, said he
would not waver in his fight to restore Haiti to
democracy. But he reiterated that he would not
return until army commander Lt. Gen. Raoul
Cedras steps down, he said.
"One, he must leave," Aristide said at a news
conference following a speech to the General
Assembly. "Two, I must return."
Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected
president, was to return by Saturday under a
U.N.-brokered agreement reached in July with
Cedras, leader of the bloody September 1991 coup.
But the army has violently resisted the agree
ment, which called for the ruling military to
resign. A transition government has been unable
to fully take control, and violence has heightened
tensions.
An oil and weapons embargo imposed bv the
Security Council on the military government last
week has nearly brought transport in Haiti to a
standstill. The council also ordered that the assets
of anti-democratic forces in Haiti frozen to pres
sure the military rulers to step down.
In the face of continued military intransigence,
the council also plans to discuss expanding sanc
tions to a full trade embargo, halting commercial
air traffic to Haiti, and denying visas to those who
obstructed Aristide's return, according to council
President Ronaldo Mota Sardenberg.
Measles cases reach all-time low
WASHINGTON (AP) — The government yes
terday declared a victory over measles, three years
after it began a massive inoculation campaign dur
ing one of America's most severe measles epidemics.
"We have seen measles virtually disappear in the
United States in 1993," Dr. William L. Atkinson of
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said
at a news conference.
Through the first six months of the year, there
have been only 175 reported measles cases, and he
predicted that by the end of October the total would
reach only about 260.
"This would be the lowest total of measles ever
reported in the United States since reporting
began," he said.
That contrasts with a time in 1989 to 1991, he
said, when there were tens of thousands of measles
cases, 132 deaths and 11,000 hospitalized with com
plications of the disease.
