# Winds calm, residents grieve destruction

LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. (AP)
Blowtorch winds that shoved
wildfires through 580 homes and
113,000 acres relented yesterday,
helping firefighters heat down
flames as residents salvaged
sooty possessions and mourned
lost dreams.
Cool sea breezes replaced the
desert winds that turned 13
Pacific Coast hla/.es from Ventu
ra County to the Mexican border
into firestorms. A growing army
of firefighters seized the chance
to steadily encircle the fires.
President Clinton declared
disasters in five counties and fed
eral agencies organized help for
25,000 displaced. Police hunted
the arsonists responsible for
some of the fires and patrolled
neighborhoods to prevent loot
ing.
Some of the fires raged out of
control. Others were partially
contained but few threatened
more residences.
A procession of fire refugees
walked through the smoke along
a coastal highway into Laguna
Beach, the posh coastal resort
half-gutted by a wall of flame
that destroyed more than 300
homes.
Authorities blocked the Pacific
Coast Highway, allowing resi
dents to return only on foot or
bicycle. Hundreds of people aban
doned their cars to make the trip.
"It's like a war zone," said res
ident John McMurray, as he used
a shovel to poke through debris
that was once his home. "It's just
total devastation. This whole
neighborhood is burnt."
Valerie Coleman dabbed tears
with a towel as she watched
smoke rise from the remnants of
the apartment she lost Wednes
day.
"I have nothing," she said.
Cool onshore breezes signaled
an end to the blustery Santa Ana
condition that spawned winds
gusting over 50 mph, low humid
ity and 90-degree heat Wednes
day.
Firefighters yesterday con
tained more than half of the

10,000-acre Laguna fire, 40 miles
southeast of Los Angeles.
Police said the cause was
arson.
"Explain to me how in the
name of God anybody with
decent impulses would do this,"
Gov. Pete Wilson said yesterday
after touring the city.
Marines searched the rubble
for possible victims, although
there were no reports of anyone
missing, said Orange County
sheriffs Lt. Dick Olson.
Arson was also suspected in a
33,111-acre fire in Ventura
County that destroyed 18 struc
tures.
A transient who set a fire
while trying to keep warm was
arrested in connection with a
5,500-acre blaze that torched 115
homes in Altadena.
Artist Jirayr H. Zorthian,
sporting a sombrero, stood below
his studio and watched heli
copters drop water on his 45-acre
spread in the Angeles National
Forest. He and his wife, Dahney,
watched helplessly as flames
licked precariously close to their
home.
"What can you do when you're
faced with something like this?"
Mrs. Zorthian said. "You just
deal with it. The fear comes
later."
Additional helicopters arrived,
dropping 300-gallon tankloads of
water on the last hot spots of the
Altadena fire.
The Angeles National Forest
and all National Park Service
sites in the Santa Monica Moun
tains were closed yesterday
because of the fire threat.
In Washington, Clinton
declared Los Angeles, Orange,
Ventura, Riverside and San
Diego counties as federal disaster
areas. He sent Federal Emergen
cy Management Agency Director
James Lee Witt to California.
About 2,130 firefighters from
around the state and 600 U.S.
Forest Service firefighters were
summoned to the region. Gov.
Wilson said 6,500 firefighters
already were on the lines.
