University's affirmative
action policy will rightly
aid American minorities

IN RECENT weeks, much atten
tion has been devoted to Stan
ford's national rankings with
regard to alumni satisfaction and
donations. However, another —
and perhaps more important —
characteristic should not be
neglected when juxtaposing the
quality of a Stanford education
with that of our competitors: facul
ty diversity.
Stanford has few minority pro
fessors — 10.8 percent of all facul
ty, to be exact. Compare that to a
national average of 12.3 percent or
to other schools: Harvard and Yale
both have more than 16 percent
minority faculty. Of Stanford's
1,430 faculty members, only 30 are
Latino and 33 are black.
Recently, the University has
sought to remedy this situation by
making affirmative action a priori
ty of the Office of Multicultural
Development and by planning to
hire a new vice provost for faculty
recruitment and retention.
Another, and perhaps more con
crete step, is the refocusing of a
University incentive program for
schools to hire more minorities.
Since 1971, Stanford has provid
ed money to departments for hiring
minority faculty of any nationality.
While the program made great
improvements in faculty diversity,
it provided little incentive to hire
minority faculty from the United
States, including Mexican Ameri
cans, African Americans, American
Indians and Puerto Ricans.
So, effective Sept. 1, the Universi
ty decided to narrow the scope of its
incentive program to focus on these
four underrepresented groups. And
to sweeten the deal, the University
will offer not only $35,000 to each
school for each minority faculty
member hired, but a half-billet —
the equivalent of one-half professor

ship — as well.
Critics have recently lashed out
at this plan, labeling it as nativist
and xenophobic.
But there are no quotas for
"American" professors and no limit
on the number of foreigners —
minority or not — that the Univer
sity can hire. As Provost Con
doleezza Rice recently said, the pol
icy will not be implemented in a
"mechanistic" way. There is no
strict "born-in-the-U.S." litmus
test or a prohibition against using
the incentive fund for certain for
eign professors.
University officials should be
lauded for trying to meet the goals
of their affirmative action pro
grams by remedying historic dis
crimination against American
minorities — which is what affir
mative action programs were
meant to do. In addition, professors
with American experiences will be
able to both better relate to and
provide role models for American
minority students.
At the same time, University
officials should carefully monitor
the recruitment of foreign minority
faculty to ensure that they are still
attracted to and hired at Stanford.
Perhaps this new policy should be
reviewed every two or three years
to make sure that Stanford is meet
ing its goals as both an American
university and as a world universi
ty-
If Stanford is truly committed to
faculty diversity, University offi
cials should also focus on increas
ing the number of American minor
ity graduate students admitted.
Since graduate school is academia's
faculty factory, increasing input
will undoubtedly increase the pool
of available minority faculty candi
dates.
The University has designed a
fine policy to meet a noble goal. If it
is implemented in the manner Rice
says, critics' fears will be unfound
ed.
There is much work yet to be
done. And ultimately, not the policy
but the results will be what really
matter.
