## Tricks for escaping reality 
### 
I DISLIKE reality. I deal with it as
little as possible. After all, that's
one of the main justifications for
Stanford: it's a $25,000-a-year day
dream. A slightly more budget-con
scious approach to escapism is yer good
ol' Halloween. Yeah, it's cheesy, but so
is that high school love-letter you've
been saving all these years, so be quiet.
Halloween is a great tradition. It's
got something for everyone. For the
Marxists, there's the reversal of ageist
power structures and the redistribu
tion of preservatives and sugar. For the
capitalists, there's a huge bull market
— almost unlimited candy demand. For
the pop psychologists, there's the
chance to appear on talk shows and
pontificate about greed and the erosion
of our society. And for all you sickos out
there, there's the chance to dress up as
Gerhard Casper.
Speaking of sick, I suppose it's a lit
tle odd that the night on which the
souls of the tortured dead are supposed
to be roaming the earth should become
an excuse for a really big party. It
reminds me of the "We got in!" cheer at
games against UC-Berkeley (hissss).
The message behind both could be
translated something like this: "We're
so glad we ain't you. Ha, ha you suck
ers! Hey, Bob, pass me a beer . . . ." In
my book, that's one of the more touch
ingly human sentiments we can
express. I'll tell you one thing — it's a

lot more honest than CIV section or
dorm program discussions.
Honesty, that's it! Halloween is our
chance to be ourselves, minus all the
trappings of "image." LIVE! UNCEN
SORED! YOUR SEAMY UNDERSIDE
REVEALED! (Hmmm. Sounds inter
esting.) On Halloween, we can be any
thing we want. We are free to be stupid.
It will never be held against us, because
either everyone was too drunk to
remember or we have equal dirt on
them. Ya can't lose, as long as you
remember to destroy the negatives.
I've been gearing up for the big day
for a while now. I have the dorky pump
kin sign up, got the little black cat
thingie on my desk and did have a bag
of candy corns until a recent all
nighter. (Hint: candy corns and Diet
Pepsi at 4 a.m. can be a bad combina
tion, so fight the temptation). The best
part of it all was going to Half Moon
Bay to pick out my pumpkin. This is
something I recommend for everyone,
especially those of you who are light
enough that they'll let you on the pony
rides. It's wholesome fun and you're
not liable to run into anybody you know
while you're fighting some third-grader
for the best pumpkin. (By the way, the
kid won.)
Maybe I'm a bad example, since I'm
not exactly Ms. Suave in the first place.
But not even YOU are too cool for this.
Being sophisticated all the time can be

really draining — you deserve a little
vacation. Cast away your ('rat sweat
shirts and your Euro-trash turtlenecks
and dress up like the tooth fairy. You'll
feel so much better. You might even
find you like it.
Since we are Stanford students (lah,
dee, dah!), we can take a slightly differ
ent approach to Halloween. Dancing on
Jane and Leland's graves is a good
start, but there are other options.
Trick-or-treating in faculty ghetto is
always entertaining, especially since
you get warm white wine as often as
bite-size Butterfingers. A rousing game
of "deconstruct your neighbor" or "find
the phallus" (a favorite of the English
Department) at the Mausoleum Party
can add that special Stanford some
thing to the evening's festivities. For
techies, "pumpkin dynamics" provides
interesting study; e.g. from what
height drop do you get the maximum
"ick" radius for a rotten jack-o-lantern?
Whatever you do to make Halloween
special, do enjoy it. It may be your only
chance this year to be your real self and
not get laughed at.

Kathleen Kane would like to apologize for
the really bad pun at the beginning of this
column.

translated something like this: "We're
so glad we ain't you. Ha, ha you suck
ers! Hey, Bob, pass me a beer . . . ." In
my book, that's one of the more touch
ingly human sentiments we can
express. I'll tell you one thing — it's a

lot more honest than CIV section or
dorm program discussions.
Honesty, that's it! Halloween is our
chance to be ourselves, minus all the
trappings of "image." LIVE! UNCEN
SORED! YOUR SEAMY UNDERSIDE
REVEALED! (Hmmm. Sounds inter
esting.) On Halloween, we can be any
thing we want. We are free to be stupid.
It will never be held against us, because
either everyone was too drunk to
remember or we have equal dirt on
them. Ya can't lose, as long as you
remember to destroy the negatives.
I've been gearing up for the big day
for a while now. I have the dorky pump
kin sign up, got the little black cat
thingie on my desk and did have a bag
of candy corns until a recent all
nighter. (Hint: candy corns and Diet
Pepsi at 4 a.m. can be a bad combina
tion, so fight the temptation). The best
part of it all was going to Half Moon
Bay to pick out my pumpkin. This is
something I recommend for everyone,
especially those of you who are light
enough that they'll let you on the pony
rides. It's wholesome fun and you're
not liable to run into anybody you know
while you're fighting some third-grader
for the best pumpkin. (By the way, the
kid won.)
Maybe I'm a bad example, since I'm
not exactly Ms. Suave in the first place.
But not even YOU are too cool for this.
Being sophisticated all the time can be

really draining — you deserve a little
vacation. Cast away your ('rat sweat
shirts and your Euro-trash turtlenecks
and dress up like the tooth fairy. You'll
feel so much better. You might even
find you like it.
Since we are Stanford students (lah,
dee, dah!), we can take a slightly differ
ent approach to Halloween. Dancing on
Jane and Leland's graves is a good
start, but there are other options.
Trick-or-treating in faculty ghetto is
always entertaining, especially since
you get warm white wine as often as
bite-size Butterfingers. A rousing game
of "deconstruct your neighbor" or "find
the phallus" (a favorite of the English
Department) at the Mausoleum Party
can add that special Stanford some
thing to the evening's festivities. For
techies, "pumpkin dynamics" provides
interesting study; e.g. from what
height drop do you get the maximum
"ick" radius for a rotten jack-o-lantern?
Whatever you do to make Halloween
special, do enjoy it. It may be your only
chance this year to be your real self and
not get laughed at.

Kathleen Kane would like to apologize for
the really bad pun at the beginning of this
column.
