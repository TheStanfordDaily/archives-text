## Students should recognize the seriousness of depression 
### 
National depression
Awareness Day, earlier this
month, came and went without
notice here at Stanford. Few people
would be foolish enough to say that
there are no sufferers of depression at
Stanford, or no suicides. Do people
think if we ignore these things, they'll
go away?
From a USA Today editorial about
the suicide of Vince Foster, deputy
White House counsel: "Depression.
Not the occasional bout of the blues
we all endure, but a shattering hope
lessness — often with a physiological
cause — that defies even the most
determined victim's efforts to 'cheer
up.'
"Of those who attempt suicide, 80
percent are clinically depressed,
according to the National Institute of
Mental Health.
The tragedy is that Foster's disease
went untreated, as do 70 percent of
all cases. Yet with treatment, 80 per
cent of depression sufferers can be
helped.
"More victims of depression might
seek treatment, or be urged by family
and friends, if only a persistent mis
understanding could be dispelled.

"In a 1991 poll ... 43 percent view
depression as a 'personal weakness'
rather than the health problem it is ... .
"So much of Foster's kind of suffer
ing is unnecessary. It's time society
learned how to stop it."
Many view suicide as the act of a
certifiable "nut case" or as the ulti
mate pathetic personal failure. Some
one who can explain things is a sur
vivor of depression. William Styron.
His book "Darkness Visible" contains
his response to this attitude:
"The argument I put forth was fair
ly straightforward: the pain of severe
depression is quite unimaginable to
those who have not suffered it, and it
kills in many instances because its
anguish can no longer be borne. The
prevention of many suicides will con
tinue to be hindered until there is a
general awareness of the nature of
this pain. . . . most people survive
depression; but to that tragic legion
who are condemned to destroy them
selves there should be no more reproof
attached than to the victims of termi
nal cancer."
Depressed people kill themselves
not because they find the life healthy
people live intolerable, but because of

the pain they endure from their ill
ness.
Over '20,000 depressed people com
mitted suicide in 1991, exceeding
many life-threatening illnesses taken
much more seriously.
There's a myth that everyone
should be happy at Stanford. People
get annoyed and expect depressed peo
ple they know to "do something about
it," unaware that extreme apathy and
helplessness are key symptoms of
depression.
Some, who are sympathetic at first,
are frustrated that the care they show
isn't enough to pull a sufferer "out of
it." Many will shun people they sus
pect to be sufferers and treat them
like "damaged goods," ignorant (hat
with proper treatment most sufferers
can fully recover and be enjoyable,
productive people again.
Last year, in my house of 90 people,
four people were on psychiatric medi
cation.
For some, the medication was
working well, and it was completely
unapparent that they were being
treated.
They all felt the need to hide their
conditions. "People just can't deal

with it," said one.
What can you do? Learn and accept
the truth about these issues. Don't
think less of someone because they see
a psychiatrist or therapist.
Resident Assistants can make
copies of this letter and post them for
people to read. If you are wondering
about whether you may be suffering
from depression, please see a profes
sional. (It's free at Counseling and
Psychological Services if you are a stu
dent.)
Many people don't get help, and
suffer needlessly, out of pride or fear
of stigmatization. People shouldn't
feel ashamed. Society has the wrong
attitude.
Society occasionally has that prob
lem.
Don't expect sufferers, because of
the very nature of the illness, to be
the ones heading up the campaign for
change.
It's almost the 21st century, and
it's time to get out of the dark ages
about these issues. On their behalf, I
ask for your help.

depression; but to that tragic legion
who are condemned to destroy them
selves there should be no more reproof
attached than to the victims of termi
nal cancer."
Depressed people kill themselves
not because they find the life healthy
people live intolerable, but because of

the pain they endure from their ill
ness.
Over '20,000 depressed people com
mitted suicide in 1991, exceeding
many life-threatening illnesses taken
much more seriously.
There's a myth that everyone
should be happy at Stanford. People
get annoyed and expect depressed peo
ple they know to "do something about
it," unaware that extreme apathy and
helplessness are key symptoms of
depression.
Some, who are sympathetic at first,
are frustrated that the care they show
isn't enough to pull a sufferer "out of
it." Many will shun people they sus
pect to be sufferers and treat them
like "damaged goods," ignorant (hat
with proper treatment most sufferers
can fully recover and be enjoyable,
productive people again.
Last year, in my house of 90 people,
four people were on psychiatric medi
cation.
For some, the medication was
working well, and it was completely
unapparent that they were being
treated.
They all felt the need to hide their
conditions. "People just can't deal

with it," said one.
What can you do? Learn and accept
the truth about these issues. Don't
think less of someone because they see
a psychiatrist or therapist.
Resident Assistants can make
copies of this letter and post them for
people to read. If you are wondering
about whether you may be suffering
from depression, please see a profes
sional. (It's free at Counseling and
Psychological Services if you are a stu
dent.)
Many people don't get help, and
suffer needlessly, out of pride or fear
of stigmatization. People shouldn't
feel ashamed. Society has the wrong
attitude.
Society occasionally has that prob
lem.
Don't expect sufferers, because of
the very nature of the illness, to be
the ones heading up the campaign for
change.
It's almost the 21st century, and
it's time to get out of the dark ages
about these issues. On their behalf, I
ask for your help.
