# Louisiana paper found excellent solution to an advertising quandary

The Oct. 21 issue of the Wall Street
Journal reports a story similar to the
situation that The Daily recently faced
with Bradley K. Smith and his revision
ist ad. The story is about how the Ku
Klux Klan unwittingly donated money
to a black scholarship fund and to Klan
investigators. And how The Daily can
draw conclusions from it.
It all started when Richard Baudoin,

the editor of the Times, a local
Louisiana weekly, wrote an Oct. 6 col
umn decrying censorship efforts by
Christian groups to remove the new
ABC-TV series "NYPD Blue" from local
TV programs. Baudoin noted in his col
umn that in contrast to those censor
groups, the Times supports freedom of
expression. The paper has long accept
ed political advertisements for groups
"mainstream and otherwise," with
whom it may not agree, he wrote.
A few days later, a local representa
tive of the Klan walked into the Times'
office with Baudoin's column in his
hand. Fie asked the editors if he could
place a full-page ad describing the plat

form of the Bayou Knights chapter of
the Klan in the paper. The cost of the
ad was about $900.
Stephen C. May, the Times' owner,
was torn between accepting the ad and
the Klan's money, thus offending read
ers and staffers alike, and refusing it,
thus discrediting the paper's public
statements. He then came up with a
solution: "We'll offer the money to the
NAACP (National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People)," he
said.
The local NAACP affiliate accepted
the money for its scholarship fund, and
it split the Klan windfall with Klan
watch, an investigative organization

that tracks white supremacist groups
nationwide. Two weeks ago, the Times
printed the Klan's ad, and explained in
its editorial how the decision had been
reached, and where the money went. "1
have to swallow hard, I really do,"
Roger Harris, Grand Dragon of the
Bavou Knights of the Klan, was report
ed saying.
Following May's example, The Daily
should run Smith's awful piece of mis
information. But it should also give the
money of the ad to a fund for Holocaust
survivors, or to the Holocaust Museum.
And tell Smith to swallow hard.
