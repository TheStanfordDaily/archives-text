## How to be a columnist or just write like one 
### 
IM (!()IN(» TO SHOCK you now.
Shock you to get your eyes over to this
side of the page, and then reel you in
like a gigantic thrashing marlin. Sucker
you into taking t he bait so eventually I can
stuff you, jam marbles into your eyes and
mount you on my wall, perfectly laminat
ed, tor potential scam-partners to see.
I hen I'll load you on with just a dash of
plot, gorging you with silly, pointless jokes
to keep you reading — hoping you'll stay
with me five short minutes, ignoring your
.«>() person lecture class. Of course 1 will
use parallel structure so you, fair reader,
will know that it is me, and not some
other, writing to you.
Don't abandon me.
Now it's time for a pseudo-sexual sen
tence including offensive or deviant mate
rial involving a member of the University
administration, my RF or that tried-and
true, wouldn't-be-the-same-without-it Phi
I )elt reference.
I would then throw in a sob story about
mv paucity of dates. Perhaps detail my
dosire to generate a little e-mail. Maybe
oven smg a full pitch for dating on campus

and the resurrection of the tight shirt.
Are you a thief?
And now I will harsh on Stanford ever
so-slightly to reach out to each and every
one of you. Each and every one of you who
debate boxers and tightie-whities. Each
and every one of you who think that guys
who ask you how many Stanford women it
takes to screw in a lightbulb should turn
around and ask themselves why then, if
we're all such wildebeests, they can't get
one measly date. Each and every one of
you who goes out in search of campus
night life each weekend, complaining all
the while, but is sure to make it back in
time for "Saturday Night Live" so you can
pelt the news guy with criticism.
Which of course would run right into a
gratuitous mention of my home town.
This would no doubt include mid-to-late
' Bos fashion trends, So Cal mall refer
ences, a description of the immensity of
my hair in high school and a generic
matching-socks-and-hair-thingies image.
I'd twist in some Duran Duran buttons,
affirming that John Taylor was by far the
most scrumptious Duran. To top it all off

I'd throw in a plaid flannel McGrunge
shirt to bring the discussion back to earth
for Stanford's fashionably challenged.
Hut I can't neglect the short, poignant
one-liner snippet follow up.
Go ahead, bind my feet.
Looks like a pump, feels like a sneaker-
Objects in mirror are closer than they
appear
Ooh, nasty cold sore.
Rewarding your effort in getting this
far, I'd begin feeding you bite-sized chunks
of Beavis and Butthead meet "A Model
Conversation" in downtown Cleveland
hoping you and your Generation X Atten
tion Span O Matic don't change the chan
nel before I get out my final jingle. All to
escape the brutal reality which sees you
wadding me up into balls for the Flicks
paper fight, as you horrifically miss your
drawmate and peg that hot babe in your
ME section right smack dab in the face,
leaving smudges of print on her perky lit
tle proboscis.
Serves ya' right.
To mix it all up, I'll throw in just a hint
of Hum Sex for taste, hoping you'll gobble

it up like a crazed ferret Cobble up utter
ances featuring nipples, hairy butts, lay
ing-your-penis-on-the-table humor — a
discussion my mom would refuse to tape
up on the 112 ridge. Gobble up a little of what
I'd like to do in library stairwells, in the
elevator at Tresidder if it wasn't made of
glass or perhaps the food service line if
people would stop ruining the ambiance by
complaining so loudly about the food qual
ity.
But then I'd tuck my teenaged fan
tasies away, putting them back on my
future psychotherapist's couch, away
from public view so I could maintain an
ounce or two of self-respect. After all, I
have to pull off my point before the end of
my space.
Pardon my orgasm.
Finally, with only a handful of para
graphs left to go, I hit upon the oh-so-sen
sitive-and-profound Mr. Kernel Of Truth
of the column. Suddenly and painlessly
bringing up multiculturalism, nun-beat
ing, intense foot pain, and the oppression
of women in society. Of course this is done
in a serious tone so the reader won't write

it off after a nanosecond or two, instead
knowing that I am a real believer in truth
justice and the American way.
This all must be done in a pure, unadul
terated paralleling of the "A-Team" style
as Hannibal, Murdock and Mr. T blow uj
the small rural town in the last five sec
onds using a tank/atomic bomb construct
ed of a tractor, a bandanna, duct tape
PVC pipe and tampons, without serioush
injuring any of the ultra-bad guys. Fac<
gets the girl, Hannibal lights a cigar, that't
the column and I am outta here.

ances featuring nipples, hairy butts, lay
ing-your-penis-on-the-table humor — a
discussion my mom would refuse to tape
up on the 112 ridge. Gobble up a little of what
I'd like to do in library stairwells, in the
elevator at Tresidder if it wasn't made of
glass or perhaps the food service line if
people would stop ruining the ambiance by
complaining so loudly about the food qual
ity.
But then I'd tuck my teenaged fan
tasies away, putting them back on my
future psychotherapist's couch, away
from public view so I could maintain an
ounce or two of self-respect. After all, I
have to pull off my point before the end of
my space.
Pardon my orgasm.
Finally, with only a handful of para
graphs left to go, I hit upon the oh-so-sen
sitive-and-profound Mr. Kernel Of Truth
of the column. Suddenly and painlessly
bringing up multiculturalism, nun-beat
ing, intense foot pain, and the oppression
of women in society. Of course this is done
in a serious tone so the reader won't write

it off after a nanosecond or two, instead
knowing that I am a real believer in truth
justice and the American way.
This all must be done in a pure, unadul
terated paralleling of the "A-Team" style

IM (!()IN(» TO SHOCK you now.
Shock you to get your eyes over to this
side of the page, and then reel you in
like a gigantic thrashing marlin. Sucker
you into taking t he bait so eventually I can
stuff you, jam marbles into your eyes and
mount you on my wall, perfectly laminat

I hen I'll load you on with just a dash of
plot, gorging you with silly, pointless jokes
to keep you reading — hoping you'll stay
with me five short minutes, ignoring your
.«>() person lecture class. Of course 1 will
use parallel structure so you, fair reader,
will know that it is me, and not some
other, writing to you.
Don't abandon me.
Now it's time for a pseudo-sexual sen

Are you a thief?
And now I will harsh on Stanford ever
so-slightly to reach out to each and every
one of you. Each and every one of you who
debate boxers and tightie-whities. Each
and every one of you who think that guys
who ask you how many Stanford women it
takes to screw in a lightbulb should turn
around and ask themselves why then, if
we're all such wildebeests, they can't get
one measly date. Each and every one of
you who goes out in search of campus
night life each weekend, complaining all
the while, but is sure to make it back in
time for "Saturday Night Live" so you can
pelt the news guy with criticism.
Which of course would run right into a
gratuitous mention of my home town.
This would no doubt include mid-to-late
' Bos fashion trends, So Cal mall refer
ences, a description of the immensity of
my hair in high school and a generic
matching-socks-and-hair-thingies image.
I'd twist in some Duran Duran buttons,
affirming that John Taylor was by far the
most scrumptious Duran. To top it all off

I'd throw in a plaid flannel McGrunge
shirt to bring the discussion back to earth
for Stanford's fashionably challenged.
Hut I can't neglect the short, poignant
one-liner snippet follow up.
Go ahead, bind my feet.
Looks like a pump, feels like a sneaker-
Objects in mirror are closer than they
appear
Ooh, nasty cold sore.
Rewarding your effort in getting this
far, I'd begin feeding you bite-sized chunks
of Beavis and Butthead meet "A Model
Conversation" in downtown Cleveland
hoping you and your Generation X Atten
tion Span O Matic don't change the chan
nel before I get out my final jingle. All to
escape the brutal reality which sees you
wadding me up into balls for the Flicks
paper fight, as you horrifically miss your
drawmate and peg that hot babe in your
ME section right smack dab in the face,
leaving smudges of print on her perky lit
tle proboscis.
Serves ya' right.
To mix it all up, I'll throw in just a hint
of Hum Sex for taste, hoping you'll gobble
