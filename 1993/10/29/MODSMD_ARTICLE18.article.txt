## Lange: a real-life Rudy for the Cardinal Lack of playing time has not discouraged the senior running back 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
He has labored at practice
every day for three years. Day
after day, he has devoted himself
to Stanford football.
But he rarely plays.
For most, that would be a
source of frustration.
But for senior running back
Scott Lange, simply participat
ing in the program brings all the
satisfaction in the world.
"I enjoy football and I enjoy
learning the game," Lange said.
"I'm learning something new
every year. I enjoy just being a
part of a team; I enjoy the guys
and making friendships that will
last for a lifetime. It's a great
way to challenge yourself and
have fun."
Lange joined the football
team as a walk-on in the winter
of his freshman year. He had
been a three-year starter on both
offense and defense in high
school, and, after watching the
Cardinal compete during the
fall, Lange could not resist
attempting to strap on the pads
one more time.
"It was one of those things
where I wanted to give it a try so
I wouldn't sit back on the couch
10 years from now and wonder if
I could have done it," Lange
said. "I wanted to give it my best
effort and whatever happened I
could live with it."
Following spring practice,
then-coach Dennis Green placed
Lange on the roster. Since that
time, he has appeared in just
four games, and while he would
prefer to play more frequently,
Lange acknowledges his position
and makes his mark on the prac
tice field.
"I understand the role that I
play and have no problems with
it," Lange said. "The guys who
play in front of me deserve to. I'd
like to help, and I think anyone
that plays hopes they can make
an impact in a competitive situa
tion. It's a little frustrating in

that you'd rather make your
impact in a game than in a prac
tice, but I have really no reserva
tions about how they (the coach
es) treat me at all."
"Ho just loves the game," said
Stanford head coach Bill Waish.
"He's just so intense in every
thing he does that he's out there
every day working so hard and
thoroughly and playing a role.
He's just special."
Though he does not see many
minutes on the field, Lange's
work-ethic in practice would
lead you to believe he leads the
Pacific 10 Conference in rush
ing. His Cardinal teammates
refer to him as "the rabbit,"
because he is constantly running
around with a seemingly endless
amount of energy.
"Scott is a stud because if
every guy worked as hard as
Scott does — at practice, in the
weight room, in everything —
Stanford would have probably
never lost a game," said receiver
Justin Armour. "He just doesn't
give up. That's a rare quality
that not a lot of people have."
"It's hard to even really
explain the influence a guy like
that has on the team because it's
pretty tough to go out to practice
and not be inspired by a guy like
that," added receiver Mark Har
ris. "He gives absolutely 100 per
cent on every play — and even
after the play running from drill
to drill. The guy is always in full
gear."
Indeed, Lange was recognized
for his determination after last
season, when he received the
Greg Piers Memorial Award for
the outstanding offensive ser
vice team player.
"Being voted most inspira
tional indicates the kind of
respect he has from his team
mates," said running backs
coach Bill Singler. "He brings a
lot of enthusiasm (to the squad),
and is a positive influence not
just on the running backs but on


Scott Lange just keeps running and running. Even without playing time, Lange is as
energetic as the Energizer Bunny in practice.
the entire team."
"He leads by example," said
running back Ethan Allen. "Per
sonally, he gets me fired up."
A native of Savannah, Ga.,
Lange grew up with football all
around him. Upon arriving at
Stanford, he was not ready to
merely sit in the stands.
"Football is real big down
south in Georgia," Lange said.
"It's not hard to be interested in
football being brought up in
Savannah. The area is a big foot
ball town. That's where Sterling
Sharpe and Herschel Walker
came from — we would play their
high schools growing up. Since I
was in sixth grade, everything

else was for football. It's meant a
lot in that I always try to prepare
myself to develop as a football
player as much as I can."
Midway through the 1991 sea
son, Lange got his chance. Green
inserted Lange in the lineup when
Stanford was driving downfield
against visiting Cornell. In two
carries, he gained four yards.
"It was a big surprise," Lange
said. "I got in in the second quar
ter and we were on the five-vard
line. I was the tailback and they
called a toss-sweep to the right. I
just wanted to make sure I held
onto the ball and it wouldn't be
one of those comical substitu
tions like the Keystone Kops
when they go in there.
"When I was waiting for the
snap, I was like 'OK, it's a toss
right, toss right, toss right.' I kept
reminding myself. It was fun to get

in there. No matter how much you
do it in practice, there's no substi
tute for a game environment. You
can call a play 100 times in practice
and do it easily, and the first time
you hear it in a game you're like,
'OK, what's that?' "
Typically, offensive players
dream of game-winning touch
downs. But Lange's ideal situa
tion does not require theatrics.
"My dream situation would be
to make a play in a game where I
would know that I had helped
our team win," Lange said. "It
wouldn't have to be anything that
anyone else would have to notice
at all, just where I would know
afterward that I had helped my
teammates."
An international relations
major, Lange hopes to pursue a
career in business after his June
graduation. Walsh has high ex

pectations for his well-liked
reserve.
"Scott's a terrific man," Walsh
said. "He's going to be the presi
dent of a corporation some day.
He's got the biggest heart on our
team."
Lange always thinks of the
team first. Kven if he watches the
entire game cheering from the
sidelines, he remains content.
"Basically, I just try to do my
best and have fun with it and let
whatever else happens happen,"
Lange said. "If I don't play a snap
and I give it my best that's fine,
and if I'm called to play in a game
where it's on the line then I'm
ready for that too, whatever the
situation. If it's fourth and one
and we need it, I'll be ready."
(iiven Lange's dedication to
Stanford football, he certainly
will be.

lead you to believe he leads the
Pacific 10 Conference in rush
ing. His Cardinal teammates
refer to him as "the rabbit,"
because he is constantly running
around with a seemingly endless
amount of energy.
"Scott is a stud because if
every guy worked as hard as
Scott does — at practice, in the
weight room, in everything —
Stanford would have probably
never lost a game," said receiver
Justin Armour. "He just doesn't
give up. That's a rare quality
that not a lot of people have."
"It's hard to even really
explain the influence a guy like
that has on the team because it's
pretty tough to go out to practice
and not be inspired by a guy like
that," added receiver Mark Har
ris. "He gives absolutely 100 per
cent on every play — and even
after the play running from drill
to drill. The guy is always in full
gear."
Indeed, Lange was recognized
for his determination after last
season, when he received the
Greg Piers Memorial Award for
the outstanding offensive ser
vice team player.
"Being voted most inspira
tional indicates the kind of
respect he has from his team
mates," said running backs
coach Bill Singler. "He brings a
lot of enthusiasm (to the squad),
and is a positive influence not
just on the running backs but on

energetic as the Energizer Bunny in practice.
the entire team."
"He leads by example," said
running back Ethan Allen. "Per
sonally, he gets me fired up."
A native of Savannah, Ga.,
Lange grew up with football all
around him. Upon arriving at
Stanford, he was not ready to
merely sit in the stands.
"Football is real big down
south in Georgia," Lange said.
"It's not hard to be interested in
football being brought up in
Savannah. The area is a big foot
ball town. That's where Sterling
Sharpe and Herschel Walker
came from — we would play their
high schools growing up. Since I
was in sixth grade, everything

else was for football. It's meant a
lot in that I always try to prepare
myself to develop as a football
player as much as I can."
Midway through the 1991 sea
son, Lange got his chance. Green
inserted Lange in the lineup when
Stanford was driving downfield
against visiting Cornell. In two
carries, he gained four yards.
"It was a big surprise," Lange
said. "I got in in the second quar
ter and we were on the five-vard
line. I was the tailback and they
called a toss-sweep to the right. I
just wanted to make sure I held
onto the ball and it wouldn't be
one of those comical substitu
tions like the Keystone Kops
when they go in there.
"When I was waiting for the
snap, I was like 'OK, it's a toss
right, toss right, toss right.' I kept
reminding myself. It was fun to get

in there. No matter how much you
do it in practice, there's no substi
tute for a game environment. You
can call a play 100 times in practice
and do it easily, and the first time
you hear it in a game you're like,
'OK, what's that?' "
Typically, offensive players
dream of game-winning touch
downs. But Lange's ideal situa
tion does not require theatrics.
"My dream situation would be
to make a play in a game where I
would know that I had helped
our team win," Lange said. "It
wouldn't have to be anything that
anyone else would have to notice
at all, just where I would know
afterward that I had helped my
teammates."
An international relations
major, Lange hopes to pursue a
career in business after his June
graduation. Walsh has high ex

pectations for his well-liked
reserve.
"Scott's a terrific man," Walsh
said. "He's going to be the presi
dent of a corporation some day.
He's got the biggest heart on our
team."
Lange always thinks of the
team first. Kven if he watches the
entire game cheering from the
sidelines, he remains content.
"Basically, I just try to do my
best and have fun with it and let
whatever else happens happen,"
Lange said. "If I don't play a snap
and I give it my best that's fine,
and if I'm called to play in a game
where it's on the line then I'm
ready for that too, whatever the
situation. If it's fourth and one
and we need it, I'll be ready."

Stanford football, he certainly
will be.

Driver Chris Waliin shoots the ball past a California defender. The
Competition doesn't get any easier this weekend as No. 2 USC
?omes to deGuerre.
He has labored at practice
every day for three years. Day
after day, he has devoted himself
to Stanford football.
But he rarely plays.
For most, that would be a
source of frustration.
But for senior running back
Scott Lange, simply participat
ing in the program brings all the
satisfaction in the world.
"I enjoy football and I enjoy
learning the game," Lange said.
"I'm learning something new
every year. I enjoy just being a
part of a team; I enjoy the guys
and making friendships that will
last for a lifetime. It's a great
way to challenge yourself and
have fun."
Lange joined the football
team as a walk-on in the winter
of his freshman year. He had
been a three-year starter on both
offense and defense in high
school, and, after watching the
Cardinal compete during the
fall, Lange could not resist
attempting to strap on the pads
one more time.
"It was one of those things
where I wanted to give it a try so
I wouldn't sit back on the couch
10 years from now and wonder if
I could have done it," Lange
said. "I wanted to give it my best
effort and whatever happened I
could live with it."
Following spring practice,
then-coach Dennis Green placed
Lange on the roster. Since that
time, he has appeared in just
four games, and while he would
prefer to play more frequently,
Lange acknowledges his position
and makes his mark on the prac
tice field.
"I understand the role that I
play and have no problems with
it," Lange said. "The guys who
play in front of me deserve to. I'd
like to help, and I think anyone
that plays hopes they can make
an impact in a competitive situa
tion. It's a little frustrating in

that you'd rather make your
impact in a game than in a prac
tice, but I have really no reserva
tions about how they (the coach
es) treat me at all."
"Ho just loves the game," said
Stanford head coach Bill Waish.
"He's just so intense in every
thing he does that he's out there
every day working so hard and
thoroughly and playing a role.
He's just special."
Though he does not see many
minutes on the field, Lange's
work-ethic in practice would
lead you to believe he leads the
Pacific 10 Conference in rush
ing. His Cardinal teammates
refer to him as "the rabbit,"
because he is constantly running
