## Lange: a real-life Rudy for the Cardinal Lack of playing time has not discouraged the senior running back 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
He has labored at practice
every day for three years. Day
after day, he has devoted himself
to Stanford football.
But he rarely plays.
For most, that would be a
source of frustration.
But for senior running back
Scott Lange, simply participat
ing in the program brings all the
satisfaction in the world.
"I enjoy football and I enjoy
learning the game," Lange said.
"I'm learning something new
every year. I enjoy just being a
part of a team; I enjoy the guys
and making friendships that will
last for a lifetime. It's a great
way to challenge yourself and
have fun."
Lange joined the football
team as a walk-on in the winter
of his freshman year. He had
been a three-year starter on both
offense and defense in high
school, and, after watching the
Cardinal compete during the
fall, Lange could not resist
attempting to strap on the pads
one more time.
"It was one of those things
where I wanted to give it a try so
I wouldn't sit back on the couch
10 years from now and wonder if
I could have done it," Lange
said. "I wanted to give it my best
effort and whatever happened I
could live with it."
Following spring practice,
then-coach Dennis Green placed
Lange on the roster. Since that
time, he has appeared in just
four games, and while he would
prefer to play more frequently,
Lange acknowledges his position
and makes his mark on the prac
tice field.
"I understand the role that I
play and have no problems with
it," Lange said. "The guys who
play in front of me deserve to. I'd
like to help, and I think anyone
that plays hopes they can make
an impact in a competitive situa
tion. It's a little frustrating in

that you'd rather make your
impact in a game than in a prac
tice, but I have really no reserva
tions about how they (the coach
es) treat me at all."
"Ho just loves the game," said
Stanford head coach Bill Waish.
"He's just so intense in every
thing he does that he's out there
every day working so hard and
thoroughly and playing a role.
He's just special."
Though he does not see many
minutes on the field, Lange's
work-ethic in practice would
lead you to believe he leads the
Pacific 10 Conference in rush
ing. His Cardinal teammates
refer to him as "the rabbit,"
because he is constantly running
around with a seemingly endless
amount of energy.
"Scott is a stud because if
every guy worked as hard as
Scott does — at practice, in the
weight room, in everything —
Stanford would have probably
never lost a game," said receiver
Justin Armour. "He just doesn't
give up. That's a rare quality
that not a lot of people have."
"It's hard to even really
explain the influence a guy like
that has on the team because it's
pretty tough to go out to practice
and not be inspired by a guy like
that," added receiver Mark Har
ris. "He gives absolutely 100 per
cent on every play — and even
after the play running from drill
to drill. The guy is always in full
gear."
Indeed, Lange was recognized
for his determination after last
season, when he received the
Greg Piers Memorial Award for
the outstanding offensive ser
vice team player.
"Being voted most inspira
tional indicates the kind of
respect he has from his team
mates," said running backs
coach Bill Singler. "He brings a
lot of enthusiasm (to the squad),
and is a positive influence not
just on the running backs but on


Scott Lange just keeps running and running. Even without playing time, Lange is as
energetic as the Energizer Bunny in practice.
