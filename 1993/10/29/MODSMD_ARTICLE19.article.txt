## Golf team home for Shootout 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
Home sweet home.
That's how the Stanford
men's golf team feels this week
end. For the first time this sea
son, the Cardinal will tee off at
the Stanford Golf Course in the
third annual Stanford Shootout,
starting today.
Stanford, ranked fifth in the
nation, comes off a disappoint
ing fourth-place finish in the
Northwestern University Quin
tessence. So far this season the
Cardinal has also competed in
tournaments in Colorado, New
Mexico and Texas, winning the
William Tucker Invitational in
Albuquerque in September.
Though the team results at
Northwestern were disappoint
ing, junior Casey Martin came
from behind in the final round
to win the individual tourna
ment. Martin's performance
propelled the Cardinal ahead of
two teams on the final day to fin

ish fourth.
It was Martin's first colle
giate win and came on two diffi
cult courses. The first two
rounds were played at the Royal
Melbourne Golf Club while the
final round was played at the
Kemper Lakes Golf Club in
Long Grove, 111., site of the 1990
PGA Championship.
"Those were a couple of the
hardest courses we'll play on all
year," said Martin. "Now it feels
good to be coming back home."
Junior Steve Burdick com
peted in an All-American tour
nament in El Paso. Texas and
thus was unable to travel with
the team to Chicago. His return
improves the Cardinal's chances
for victory this weekend.
"I'm excited to be back home
and playing." said junior
William Yanagisawa, who trans
ferred last year from UC-Irvine.
"We have a really solid lineup
this year. I'm expecting to do
well and the whole team is expect
ing to do well."
Twenty teams from around the
country will be at Stanford this
weekend for the Shootout. Squads
will come from as far away as
Hawaii and as nearby as Berkeley.
Stanford, which won the tourna
ment in 1991, will try to regain the
title it lost to Virginia last year.
"We're looking for a little better
luck now that we're back on our
home grounds," said coach Wally
Goodwin. "It's a little difficult for
us to play in a place like Chicago
where it's cold and damp. We

played on some long and hard golf
courses that we're just simply not
used to."
Shotgun starts kick off the tour
nament today and tomorrow at
7:30 a.m., meaning that every
team in the field starts at the same
time on the front nine.
On Sunday, the top 12 teams
will tee off the front nine at 7:30
a.m. and the bottom teams will tee
off the back nine at 8 a.m. Tour
nament action should run until 2
p.m.
"There are some really good
teams from all over the country
coming out here," said Goodwin.
"But we've got them on our home
grounds and we should be even
more cranked up and motivated
than ever."
