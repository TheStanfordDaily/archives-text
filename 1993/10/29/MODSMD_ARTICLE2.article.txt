# COP education group gets University funds
## Sign of support for student committee 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
In a gesture of formal recognition and
support, the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education granted funding yesterday to
its student counterpart, an ASSU-spon
sored advisory committee.
Although the Student Advisory Group on
Undergraduate Education had already re
ceived strong verbal support from commis
sion chair James Sheehan, the promise of
$ 1,300 in financial support lends it added le
gitimacy, and suggests that its efforts will
have a real impact on the commission's final
report.
"The administration's response has been

very encouraging," said Fkldy Garcia, chair
of the student group, which was initiated
this year by the ASSU Council of Presi
dents.
"Both Prof. Sheehan and other commis
sion members have expressed a lot of sup
port for our project," he said, adding that
when the group requested the funding, the
commission was "very willing to help us
out."
Garcia said the student group intends to
use the funding to pay for office expenses.
COP member Ying-Ying Goh also agreed
that the commission has taken a very favor
able stance toward the student group.
"Every time we've spoken with
them . . . the commission has
been very positive toward us,"
she said. "I feel like we have their
support and that they really are
open to hearing what students
are going to say."
Both Goh and Garcia said they
hope to include a wide range of
student input in the group's dis
cussions.
"We're interested in getting a
feel for the majority view of peo
ple on campus," Goh said.
The group started its effort at
soliciting student opinion
Wednesday at a town hall meet
ing in Roble, but Goh said she
hopes to work harder to seek out
input.

"Besides town meetings,
we're thinking about meeting
with student interest groups and
also possibly setting up some
kind of dorm programs — hope
fully in conjunction with the
[Residential Education] system,"
she said.
"We feel we can pick out more
mainstream views by going to
dorms," she added, pointing out
that many students who attend
the COP-sponsored town meet
ings tends to subscribe to more
radical perspectives.
Garcia said the advisory group,
which is open to all students, has
already received applications
from 18 people.
"We have a broad variety of
class range and majors in the peo
ple who have joined so far," he
said. "The door is open at this
point — our philosophy is to

encourage people to join in."
Though the exact structure for
the group has not been set, Goh
said she believes it will be a suc
cess.
"We will probably submit a
written report to the commis
sion," she said. "So far, it looks
like they're going to take what
we're doing seriously."
COP member Jason Snyder
said that University President
Gerhard Casper has described the
student commission as "the best
idea he has ever seen come out of
the ASSU."
This unprecedented show of
support for the ASSU project
"bodes well for the future," Sny
der said. "It's a good sign for
things to come because it puts the
advisory group in a position
where it's seen as a legitimate
source of student input."
