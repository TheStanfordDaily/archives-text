# COP education group gets University funds
## Sign of support for student committee 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
In a gesture of formal recognition and
support, the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education granted funding yesterday to
its student counterpart, an ASSU-spon
sored advisory committee.
Although the Student Advisory Group on
Undergraduate Education had already re
ceived strong verbal support from commis
sion chair James Sheehan, the promise of
$ 1,300 in financial support lends it added le
gitimacy, and suggests that its efforts will
have a real impact on the commission's final
report.
"The administration's response has been

very encouraging," said Fkldy Garcia, chair
of the student group, which was initiated
this year by the ASSU Council of Presi
dents.
"Both Prof. Sheehan and other commis
sion members have expressed a lot of sup
port for our project," he said, adding that
when the group requested the funding, the
commission was "very willing to help us
out."
Garcia said the student group intends to
use the funding to pay for office expenses.
COP member Ying-Ying Goh also agreed
that the commission has taken a very favor
able stance toward the student group.
