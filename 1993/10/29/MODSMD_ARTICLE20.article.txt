# USC polo is challenge; Davis a mere diversion
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
Although the Stanford water
polo team continues to sit atop
the national rankings, they will
be looking to reverse their recent
fortunes and halt a season-high
two game skid
The Cardinal (15-3, 2-1 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) plays host to No. 2 IJSC at 3
p.m. on Friday and UC-Davis at
10 a.m. Saturday.
While Stanford coach Dante
Dettamanti has called the match
up with the Trojans (12-5) the
most important game of the year
up to this point, Saturday's
meeting with Davis should be a
chance for the entire Cardinal
roster to get ample playing time.
There are many reasons why
Dettamanti and his squad are
stressing the importance of a win
over USC
"First, we have a two-game
losing streak, said Dettamanti.

The most impor
tant thing is to get
back on a winning
track.'
â€” Dante Dettamanti

"Second, USC is ranked No.'2,
right behind us. Third, we've
already split games with them
At their tournament (in Septem
ber) we lost 7-6 without a couple
of our players, then we turned
around and beat them in the
championship game 9-4.
"We need this win to give us a
winning record against them,"
Dettamanti continued. "We still
have to travel to LA next week
end to play USC and If we
lose in our pool, there will be
more pressure to win on the
road. Right now, we've put our
selves in a position where we're
being challenged (for the top
ranking)."
The make-up of the Trojan
squad may pose problems for the
Cardinal, as Dettamanti and
seniors Antonio Busquets and
Larry Bercutt all mentioned
USC's extraordinary team bal
ance and depth.
"They match up against us
really well," Busquets said. "Cal
has (Troy) Barnhart, who is their
star, but (Stanford and USC)
don't really have one big star. We
both balance out the team in
other ways."
Busquets also stressed the
importance of controlling the
tempo of the game in order for
the Cardinal to be successful.
"USC is a very emotional
team," he said.
"We have to come out hard in
the first quarter. They have a
good counterattack and play
team defense. They play well as a
team."
After suffering their worst

defeat of the season last Satur
day at the hands of rival-Califor
nia by a final score of 9-5, goal
tender Bercutt knows the Cardi
nal must pull together to get a
victory Friday.
"We were in a slump, but
we've really found our motiva
tion again," he said. "Practices
this week were really strong
and I think we're ready to play
well."
Bercutt is looking to lead a
revitalized Stanford defense
against USC after defensive
breakdowns contributed to the
Cardinal's recent losses to UOP
and Cal.
"The defense is going to
return," Bercutt said. "What
cost us before were stupid, slop
py errors. I don't see that hap
pening."
Dettamanti, on the other
hand, hopes to see movement in
Stanford's victory column, which
has been stalled at 15 for two
weeks.
"The most important thing is
to get back on a winning track,"
he said. "We need to get back to
the beginning of the season when
we had to win games to get the
No. 1 ranking. We have to play
the way that got us here."
