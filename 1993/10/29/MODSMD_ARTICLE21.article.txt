### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
It's down to one final kick in the seat for
the seniors on the Stanford men's soccer
squad. But this Friday's 2 p.m. game against
California and this Sunday's 1 p.m. game
against Butler will be much more than just a
laid-back good-bye.

Cardinal team competing in the league play

"There's still a remote chance that we can
make the playoffs," said junior midfielder
Ryan Collins. "Ill be really disappointed if we

is an absolute must if the Cardinal ;u - e to

"This game has more impact that just the
Stanford / Cal rivalry," said Cardinal coach
Colin Lindores. "If we could make the playoffs
it would be a big plus mentally to our program
and our players. We would show that we are

"Cal will come here definitely with the
mindset of beating us, and if they do
they're in the playoffs," I.indoivs
said. "Their overall record is not a
winning one, hut we haven't Ixvn
playing well at home."
Not well at all, in fact. Stanford
has won only a single contest on
their home grass, a disturbing fact
going into such a vitally important
match-up.
Even if the Cardinal comes away
with a win, a greater force will ulti
mately decide its fate. Only a Stan
