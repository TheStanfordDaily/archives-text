### Sam Wu Staff writer 
For the first time in several years, both the
Stanford men's and women's cross country
teams have an opportunity to win the Pacific 10
Championships, to be held at the Stanford Golf
Course this Saturday.
The ninth-ranked women and the No. 11 men
both finished fourth last season, while Oregon
basked in the winner's circle. The Ducks have pre
vailed in the last three Pac-10 meets, winning six
titles over the past seven seasons, and they will
compete for the crown again this year. Both the
No. 12 Oregon men and sixth-ranked Oregon
women return almost their entire championship
squad from last season.
However, the Ducks are no longer the clear
favorites The Cardinal has proven itself a legitimate
contender for the Pac-10 crown by placing no lower
than second in any competition since its season
began. Just two weeks ago, both the Stanford men
and women put on second-place performances at the
Michigan Invitational, which featured top-ranked
teams from across the nation. Both teams will also
be challenged by Washington: the Husky women
enter as the defending Distnct-8 champions, while
their male counterparts boast a No. 14 ranking
"Oregon, Washington and Stanford â€” some
how these teams will shake up the top three
spots," said head coach Vin Lananna. "As far as
we're concerned, we just have to maintain our
composure and concentrate on what we do best."
For the women, Lananna's words mean that
the Cardinal must keep the time gap between its
runners as small as possible. As for the young
men's team, which features freshmen standouts
Greg Jimmerson, J.J. White and Andy Cowgill as
three of the squad's top five runners, Lananna
simply hopes for them to continue with the suc
cess they've had all year.
Despite such concerns in addition to the gen
eral anxiety which builds around the Pac-10
championships, however, both the Cardinal men
and women greatly anticipate their challenge.
"We're all excited," said, senior Gary Stoltz.
"It's a home meet, and it's the first of the cham
pionship meets. You train all summer and all
through the season for this. All the hard work is
over. Now you just have to run the race."
"This feels like a championship like it's never
been before," said senior women's captain Sarah
Truitt. "I feel really good about the team We're
serious about the competition because they're
the same ones we'll face at Districts. We're going
to challenge all the teams and be extremely tough
in the last part of the race."
For Stolz, Truitt, fellow senior Louise Watson
and others, Saturday will also be their last home
meet and Pac-10 championships.
"I'm feeling strong and confident, particularly
with the Michigan meet behind me," said defend
ing I)istrict-8 champion Watson, who hopes to
place in the top five. "We also have a good team
backing us up, and that gives added incentive.
But it hadn't really occurred to me until recently
that this is my last year, so there's added incen
tive to leave on a good note."
For now. such wishes must wait until 3:15
p.m. on Saturday, when the women's race begins
at the golf course's second tee. The men's race
will follow at ;-!:45 p m..
"Those who view cross country as an individu
al sport will see it very differently this weekend,"
Lananna said. "It's going to come down to the
fifth runners."
