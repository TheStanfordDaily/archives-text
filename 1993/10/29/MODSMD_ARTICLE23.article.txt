# Who's afraid of the big, bad Cardinal?
## Spikers seek to regain dominance this weekend 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
In any sport, teams must pass
through rocky periods along the
jwith to eventual success. This week
end, the Stanford women's volley
ball team hopes to put its most
treacherous terrain miles in the
rear-view mirror.
The sixth-ranked Cardinal will
take the first step in this direction
tonight iis it faces off against the
University of Washington (7-1 .'i, 2-8
in the Pacific 10 Conference) at 7
p.m. in Maples Pavilion, followed bv
another 7 p.m. meeting with No. 21
Washington State (14-5, 5-5 in the
Pac-10) Saturday evening.
"If we don't pull together, we
could be on the lower half of the Pac
-10 looking up," said coach Don
Shaw. "We need to get back on track
and play well â€” then the other
things will fall into place We're just
going through some struggling
times right now."
Stanford fell to third place in the
conference after being blown away
by Arizona State last Friday (7-15,
13-15, 7-15), then succumbing,to
Arizona in four games (15-8,9-15,6-
15, 14-16) Sunday afternoon.
"We were 1 really humiliated by
ASU, but we know we can't do any
thing about it now," said junior tri
captain Anne Wicks. "We're trying
not to dwell on it because we have
three more Pac-10 weekends coming
up and matches in which we need to
take care of business."
While the team maintains a posi
tive attitude entering its next two
contests, last weekend's losses
exposed the weaknesses of a young
and relatively inexperienced team
"Our technique really cost us,"

Shaw said "Not everyone has
learned to play their positions yet
The reality is that we don't have peo
ple out there who are secure in what
they're doing."
The Cardinal will focus on its
passing game, an area Shaw cited as
esptvially weak last weekend Offen
sively, he attributed the Cardinal's
floundering attack to an abundance
of hitting errors which opened the
d(X)r for the opposition
"All ASU had to really do was
show up, serve the hall and get out of
the way; we basically did the rest,"
Shaw said
The Cardinal not only hopes to
eliminate these errors, it will also be
focusing on increasing its concentra
tion and intensity levels, according
to Wicks.
"Against Arizona we just couldn't
do the things we knew we needed to
do," she said "We need to work on
being mentally tough enough to
push through and fight We're really
focusing on working hard and sus
taining at a high level."

and physical, will be challenged thus

"It's going to be tough going
against teams who haven't beaten
us or have rarely beaten us," Shaw
said. "They figure that this year is
the year they can get us which adds
all that much extra motivation."

While the Northwest teams
might be fueled with some added
incentive to finally upend the
defending national champions, the
Cardimil will do all it am to get itself
back on the winning track.
"This past weekend made us
reflect on our strengths and weak
nesses," said sophomore outside hit
ter Wendy Hromadka. "We need to
build up our confidence as a team
and unit."
