# Week 5: Don dons toga for role as Greek prognosticator
## 
### 
There I was, watching the Serra
lounge cable feed in the comfort of
my column-chambered room, when
who should appear on C-SPAN during a
House debate on improper accounting
procedures?
If you said Dean Martin, give yourself
half-credit and then wake up. It's the '90s,
and I just had to keep the "Dean" thing
alive.
No, it was our good friend John Dingell
(D-Michigan). Now it doesn't take Nikos
(The Last Temptation of Christ)
Kazantzakis to figure out that unjustified
persecution and crucifixion are not
unknown to our beleaguered institution of
higher learning.
So naturally, I thought, how better to
spice up a Greek contest that has started
to smell like rancid cucumber sauce than
to invite former University President /
Biology Prof. Donald Kennedy into the
fray?
After a 3-5 washout with Jean Fetter a
week ago notched my record down to 15-19
and the guests' to 13-21, our little exercise
just got interesting again. Without further
ado, from the cabled-up Alpha Sig lounge
(my buddies thank you, DK) to you, via the
Chronicle's Wednesday lines and home
teams in CAPS, bombs away:
STANFORD —13 vs. Oregon State
Andy: Stanford —13. If the Cardinal can't
snap this wishbone, our campus' only
bowl hopes will reside at the 24-hour El
Camino establishment down the street.

So, win, lose, draw, or death-by-option,
keep me posted. I'll be in Weenieland
watching a tilt between two contenders
(stay tuned).
DK: Oregon State +13. "Stanford will
win, but not* bv 13," said Kennedy, the
master of the obvious. Gosh, I wish I was
a former university president. Then I
could pick what I wanted — Stanford's
ridiculously underrated opponents, new

sheets, a yacht .... Oh well, guess I have
to work my way up the ranks before my
editors give me that freedom.
CALIFORNIA -2-1/2 vs. Use
Andy: USC 4-2-1/2. The Trojans will have
the moral and physical support of yours
truly at gawd-awful Memorial Stadium
tomorrow.
DK: USC- +2-1/2. Understanding the fun
damental connection between Greeks and
Trojans. Kennedy went with USC to win
straight-up. Fight on, Don.
UCLA —6 vs. Arizona

Andy: Arizona +6. The Wildcats and the
points? The steal of the century. I'm
speechless.
DK: Arizona +6. Never at a loss for words,
Kennedy mentioned how up-and-down the
Bruins have been this season. Well, you win
some, you lose some, right, Don? Right?
Washington —9 vs. ARIZONA STATE
Andy: Washington —9. Despite giving up

comparable globs of points to the Huskies
and Sun Devils, the Cardinal would stand
a much better chance of out-scoring ASU
in a rematch. See what being a cynical
Stanford fan will do to you?
DK: Washington —9. "I'm hesitant to pick
a team that's in jail, though," Kennedy
said with a bit of his own cynicism. Valid
point you have there, Tricky Don, but the
Sun Devils were that team just last year.
Oh, and I almost forgot. Paul Biddle
called. He wants to know how Haldemann,
Ehrlichman and Dean are doing.
OREGON —3 vs. Washington State

Andy: Oregon —3. Two reasons to back the
Fighting Ducks: 1) They can't possibly win
fewer games than their Mighty hockey coun
terparts to the south, and 2) The Cougars
can't play over their heads eveiy week.
DK: Washington State +3. Applying his
grading technique to the gridiron,
Kennedy stated that he is impressed by
teams that play better each week. By that
standard, our Cardinal should thank its
lucky stars that the "F" hasn't been rein
stated — yet.
OHIO STATE -3-1/2 vs. Penn State
Andy: Ohio State -3-1/2. The Buckeyes
are about to drive the final nail in the cof
fin of the Nittany Lions' Rose Bowl hopes.
This will be yet another lesson in old-time
religion for Joe Paterno before he starts
making excuses (again) to the long faces in
Happy Valley.
DK: Ohio State -3-1/2. "They are steadi
ly improving and are the class of the Big
10," Kennedy said. I guess that was the
only class Robert Smith cared to attend.
WISCONSIN —4 vs. Michigan
Andy: Michigan +4. Don't get me wrong. The
Badgers are good. Just not Wolverine good.
DK: Michigan +4. "Could you please
answer the question, Dr. Kennedy?" No
pressure here, Don.
Nebraska —2 vs. COLORADO
Andy: Nebraska —2. Hey, stop slamming
the Cornhuskers. They are undefeated
(again), have one of the top rushing

attacks in the nation (again) and a delen -c
that can hold even the Buffaloes in check
(again). That is not to say that this one
won't be exciting, though.
OK: Colorado +2. "I'd like the Buffaloes
even more if they took the headphones
away from McCartney,' Kennedy com
plained about Colorado's coaching. You re
right, Don. I wish John, George or Ringo
would finally get the opportunity they
deserve.
Kansas City — 1 vs. MIAMI
Andy: Kansas City —1. In what was sup
posed to be an even match featuring mar
quee superstars, an understudy hits l>een
thrust center-stage. The Chiefs and Montana
should give Scott Mitchell and the 1 )olphins a
severe case of stage fright.
I)K: Miami +1. Never afraid to lay himself
on the line, Kennedy voiced an objection to
the "Montana mystique " The Bay Area
cannot have its educators questioning the
immortal status of Joe, which explains the
switch to Gerhard Casper, who wouldn't
know Joe if he shared striidel with him
Dallas -10 vs. PHILADELPHIA
Andy: Dallas —10 The Cowboys are fresh
off a victory over the 49ers and a bve week
Bye bye, Birdies.
I)K: Philadelphia +10. "National Football
League teams rarely beat each other by 10
points," Kennedy said. Well, they usually
wait for the Super Bowl, Don, hut the
wounded Eagles should keep Dallas in a
January state of mind this time.
