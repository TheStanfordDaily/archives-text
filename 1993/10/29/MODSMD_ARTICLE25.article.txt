# Booters face-off against Tigers
## No. 2 Cardinal tries to tame erratic Colorado squad 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
Building off last weekend's
breakthrough performance against
California, the No. 2 Stanford
women's soccer team (14-2-1) will
get the chance to solidify its rank
ing when it squares off against Col
orado College (9-5-0) Saturday at
11 a.m. at Maloney Field.
In its upset victory over second
ranked Cal, the Cardinal vaulted
over No. 3 Notre Dame to secure the
No. 2 ranking. Undefeated North
Carolina remains in the top spot.
"We've had a tremendous week
of practice," said head coach lan
Sawyers. "We're very focused, and
I think the team was spiritually
lifted after last weekend's perfor
mance."
This weekend's opponent, Col
orado College, will prove an interest
ing test for Stanford. Ranked as
high as No. 17, the Tigers dropped
out of the rankings after losses to
San Diego State and UC-Santa Bar
bara last weekend. However, similar
middle-of-the-pack teams have
caused the Cardinal difficulties this
year, such as a 2-1 early season loss
to Washington State and a 0-0 tie
with San Diego State.

"They were a perennial Final
Four team a few years ago,"
Sawyers said. "A new coach came
in and that set them back some,
but I think the program is coming
back together pretty well."
Strong up front but weak defen
sively, Colorado College's scoring is
dominated by seniors. Forward
Tara Nott paces the Tiger attack
with 11 goals and five assists. For
ward Jill Jakowich and midfield
er/forward Traci Holbrook have
seven and five goals, respectively.
Plagued by a slow-starting
offense all season, Stanford's scor
ing woes came to an end last week
end with exceptional midfield play
and the re-emergence of All-Ameri
can senior Sarah Rafanelli. 'rally
ing the opening goal in both the vic
tory over the Golden Bears and the
Cardinal's 4-0 spanking of Butler,
Rafanelli kick-started a sputtering
attack which had scored only three
goals in the previous four games.
"I've been very pleased with our
transition," Sawyers said "Not
only from defense to offense, which
led directly to a goal against Butler,
but also from offense to defense.
We've got a good playing rhythm
and we're identifying and estab
lishing one-on-one situations."

Stanford also gains the services
of sophomore forward Dena Dey,
who returned to the lineup against
Butler. Out all season with shin
splints, Dey brings another weapon
to the formidable front line of
Rafanelli, Erin Martin, Andrea
Johnson and Emily Burt.
"We've been running fitness
tests on Dena all week," Sawyers
said. "She's looking pretty good.
She said she felt a little bit 'goofy'
during the (Butlerl game, but now
she's the decider on how much she
will play."
Sawyers also noted that although
bringing Dey into the lineup may
cause some rhythm problems, he
would gladly face the few difficulties
that do come up if it means getting a
player of Dey's quality back onto the
field. In 18 games last year, Dey
scored 11 goals and dished out five
assists for 27 total points, good for
third on the team.
Saturday's game also marks the
final regular season home game for
Cardinal seniors Rafanelli and full
back Anita Koshy, who has missed
the entire season with a knee injury.
Although she is academically a
senior, goalkeeper Leslie Garrard
plans to remain one more year to
play out her four years of eligibility.

The Cardinal will have to similarly dictate the offensive pace of this
Saturday's game against Colorado College.
