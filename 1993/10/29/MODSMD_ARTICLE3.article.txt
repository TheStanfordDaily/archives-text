# Voucher, sales tax measures get top billing in election

### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
California voters will be decid
ing seven propositions when they
go to the polls this Tuesday, in
cluding a nationally watched ini
tiative on school vouchers.

' Proposition 174 — likely the
most hotly debated measure on
this year's state ballot — would re
quire the state to offer a voucher
worth about $2,600 to every
school-age child in California. Par
ents could then use the money for
tuition at private schools.
If the proposition passes, Cali
fornia will become the first state in
the country to offer all its resi
dents school vouchers.
Proponents of this proposition
hail it as an answer to what they
see as low quality and dangerous
conditions in California's public
school system. Opponents say it
will promote discrimination and
drain precious funding from pub
lic schools.
"All it is is a help, it's a step up
for lower and middle-income peo
ple," said John Herr, a spokesper
son for Yes on 174. By providing
the vouchers, a private school edu
cation that is too expensive for
poorer children would become
widely available.
Herr said the proposal could
save state taxpayers billions of dol
lars over the next several years if

at least 10 percent of public school
students switch to private schools,
because the vouchers are worth
half of what it costs to educate a
student in public schools.
The official legislative analysis
of the proposition predicts a wide
range of financial outcomes, from
an annual savings of $1 billion to
an annual cost of $800 million, de
pending on how many students
take advantage of the vouchers.
Furthermore, proponents of
174 say it will make schools more
responsive to parents' wishes.
And, Herr said, school quality can
still be controlled because 174 does
not deregulate education — exist
ing rules on curriculum, teaching,
health and other areas would con
tinue for public and private
schools.
But Chris Levesque, a
spokesperson for No on 174, said
she fears the voucher system "se
verely limits" parental choice and
may lead to discrimination.
The text of the proposition bars
schools that discriminate on the
basis of "race, ethnicity, color or
national origin" from redeeming
vouchers. But, Levesque said,
"there are lots of other ways you
can discriminate," including dis
crimination based on gender, in
come and physical or mental abili
ty. Levesque said she worried such
discrimination might occur, creat
ing segregated schools.
Levesque also said that Califor
nia's private schools do not have
the room for masses of new stu
dents, so parental choice won't be
increased but hurt "because it's
going to be the private school sys
tem that chooses the kids."
Levesque said she worries "un
