# Voucher, sales tax measures get top billing in election
## 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
California voters will be decid
ing seven propositions when they
go to the polls this Tuesday, in
cluding a nationally watched ini
tiative on school vouchers.

' Proposition 174 — likely the
most hotly debated measure on
this year's state ballot — would re
quire the state to offer a voucher
worth about $2,600 to every
school-age child in California. Par
ents could then use the money for
tuition at private schools.
If the proposition passes, Cali
fornia will become the first state in
the country to offer all its resi
dents school vouchers.
Proponents of this proposition
hail it as an answer to what they
see as low quality and dangerous
conditions in California's public
school system. Opponents say it
will promote discrimination and
drain precious funding from pub
lic schools.
"All it is is a help, it's a step up
for lower and middle-income peo
ple," said John Herr, a spokesper
son for Yes on 174. By providing
the vouchers, a private school edu
cation that is too expensive for
poorer children would become
widely available.
Herr said the proposal could
save state taxpayers billions of dol
lars over the next several years if

at least 10 percent of public school
students switch to private schools,
because the vouchers are worth
half of what it costs to educate a
student in public schools.
The official legislative analysis
of the proposition predicts a wide
range of financial outcomes, from
an annual savings of $1 billion to
an annual cost of $800 million, de
pending on how many students
take advantage of the vouchers.
Furthermore, proponents of
174 say it will make schools more
responsive to parents' wishes.
And, Herr said, school quality can
still be controlled because 174 does
not deregulate education — exist
ing rules on curriculum, teaching,
health and other areas would con
tinue for public and private
schools.
But Chris Levesque, a
spokesperson for No on 174, said
she fears the voucher system "se
verely limits" parental choice and
may lead to discrimination.
The text of the proposition bars
schools that discriminate on the
basis of "race, ethnicity, color or
national origin" from redeeming
vouchers. But, Levesque said,
"there are lots of other ways you
can discriminate," including dis
crimination based on gender, in
come and physical or mental abili
ty. Levesque said she worried such
discrimination might occur, creat
ing segregated schools.
Levesque also said that Califor
nia's private schools do not have
the room for masses of new stu
dents, so parental choice won't be
increased but hurt "because it's
going to be the private school sys
tem that chooses the kids."
Levesque said she worries "un
savory private school entrepre-

neurs" will spring up if the propo
sition passes — people who open
private schools more to receive
voucher money than to provide a
good education. She said she
fears the proposition would also
drain billions of dollars from the
public school budget.
Herr said he thought 174 had
very strong parental support and
will be approved. Levesque pre
dicted the proposal will be sound
ly defeated.
Another ballot measure that
has gained a lot of attention this
year is Proposition 172, which
would use a half-cent sales tax to
fund public safety.
The state sales tax is now six
percent. A statewide local sales
tax of 1.25 percent is added to
that, and localities can choose to
add further sales taxes.
The state tax rate is scheduled
to drop by half a percent on Jan.
1, 1994, but 172 would place a
new half-percent tax starting the
same day, so the state tax would
remain at six percent. The money
gained from the new half-cent
sales tax — estimated at about
$1.5 billion annually — would be
dedicated to fund police and fire
departments and other public law
and safety groups.
Proponents of 172 say that if it
does not pass, public safety

groups will face severe budget
shortfalls and will have to cut
back their services. Opponents of
the proposition say it is simply
imposing a new tax so the legisla
ture does not have to allocate
more money to public safety and
make tough decisions about
where to take the money from.
Proposition 172 would bring
about $70 million to Santa Clara
County, said Sheriff Charles
Gillingham. Gillingham said if
the proposition does not pass, the
county will have to cut about $70
million from its budget.
Since many other county agen
cies have been cut in the past few
years, but the safety budgets
have remained relatively intact,
Gillingham said he feared most of
the cuts would come from safety.
If the proposition does not
pass, Gillingham said he will like
ly have to lay off deputies. Police
and fire departments' response
times to 911 calls will increase
and jails will have to release pris
oners early "because there'd be
no staff to watch them," he said.
"{Proposition! 172 gives us
secure funding," Gillingham said.
"It isn't a new tax, it's rather one
we've already imposed on (our
selves)."
Like Gillingham, State Assem
blyman Richard Mountjoy said he
thinks public safety groups need
more funding. However, Moun
tjoy said he opposes 172 because
it unnecessarily maintains a tax
that should be shut down instead

of making the legislature cut
other areas to fund public safety.
"The thing that really angers
me is the politicians made law
enforcement the last spending
priority on their budget"and are
now trying to get more money for
it, Mountjoy said.
"I think it's time to see the leg
islature go back into (special) ses
sion and make some cuts," he
said.
Mountjoy said he also worried
that real funding for public safe
ty does not have to increase
under 172. While revenue from
the half-cent tax must go to pub
lic safety, Mountjoy said, there is

nothing to stop localities from
moving some funding from pub
lic safety to other areas, substi
tuting the new tax money but
not actually increasing safety
budgets.
Mountjoy said he feared 172
will pass, because the proponents
of the opposition have mounted a
large campaign and there is no
organized No on 172 group.
Gillingham said he was opti
mistic about the election, but also
concerned the measure might
fail.
"I don't get worried too much .
. . I am worried about this,"
Gillingham said.
