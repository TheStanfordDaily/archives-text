# Student voters exhibit lackadaisical attitude
## 
### Charles Katz Staff writer 
A year after great cam
puswide and nationwide interest
in the 1992 elections, student
political groups say few students
now are bothering to participate
or pay attention to this year's
local elections.
With the election looming
ahead on Tuesday, political orga
nizations on campus are scram
bling to spread information
about the issues that students
don't seem to care about.
From inviting speakers to
campus to actively registering
voters, political groups have been
doing just about everything pos
sible to build student interest.
"Stanford students aren't as
interested," said Samantha
Halem, president of the Stanford
Democrats, noting that the gen
eral apathy on campus has man
ifested itself into poorly attended
debates and speaker forums.
Although the Stanford
Democrats sponsored a "get out
the vote" campaign during which
it registered about 300 voters in
White Plaza, they say an air of
indifference still pervades the
campus.
"It's not like (it was) during
the presidential election, when
we had a lot of volunteers,"
Halem said. "Right now I just
have a core of 10 to 12 people.
But, I understand that [this
year's election] is local and not
everyone is as politically
obsessed as my officers."
But even with the low
turnout, the newly formed group
Students for Self-Government
has still thrown itself into the
political arena. The non-partisan

organization has been striving to
provide a forum for discussion of
important issues.
"Students seem to be involved
on campus issues, but not on
those outside of the school," said
Self-Government President Blake
Stephenson. "Maybe students
aren't touched directly by outside
issues now, but they will be."
In a spirit of cooperation to
interest the disinterested, the
Democrats, Stanford College
Republicans and Stanford Stu
dents for Self-Government have
formed an umbrella group, the
Stanford Political Union,
designed to bring speakers to
campus under a non-partisan
sponsorship.
"I see our role on campus as
education, not conversion,"
Halem said. By working with
other groups to bring in speakers
from opposing camps, Halem
hopes to encourage more student
attendance. "People are more
likely to come for a [debate) than
for a speech."
Pail of the reason for the lack
of student interest in politics,
Halem said, is that there is not
much political opposition on
campus to the Democratic view
"Most people just agree with one
another on the issues," she said.
The College Republicans, on
the other hand, say they have
enjoyed great successes in their
quest to get students involved
The group has quadrupled its
membership to 80 students, said
President Adam Ross.
Ross' group is putting its new
found strength to use by working
with the Tom Campbell cam
paign for state senate. "We want
to see as many Republicans as
possible elected," Ross said.
