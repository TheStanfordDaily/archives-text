### Klissa Lee Staff writer 
An unidentified man who on
lookers said "went nuts" caused ap
proximately $4,000 worth of dam
age at the Tresidder Union comput -
er cluster last night.
At about 7:15 p.m., a "dazed"
white male entered the facility and
intentionally threw an Apple leaser
Writer 11, a Centris (>5O CPU unit
and a high resolution color monitor
to the ground, according to Ellen
Kennedy, the consultant at the

cluster who was on duty at the time.
Stanford Police Officer Allen
James said the crime is being con
sidered vandalism and will be treat
ed as either a misdemeanor or a
felony depending upon the final
cost of t he damage.
According to witnesses, the man
initially attempted to enter the
cluster through one of the locked
doors. After several violent pulls on
the door, he found the facility's
open door and entered.
He then picked up the printer,
monitor and Centris unit and at

tempted to throw the equipment
through a window. An alarm
sounded as soon as the man picked
up the printer, but lie continued
throwing equipment onto the
ground.
"I was typing and the keyboard
jerked because of the guy ripping
out all the cords and cables at the
next station," said Michael King, a
sophomore who was working in the
cluster during the incident.
According to Kennedy, nobody
noticed the suspect before he began
throwing the computers because it

is not unusual for students to pull
on the locked doors before realizing
where the open door is.
She said the suspect, dressed in a
gray Vanderbilt University T-shirt,
old jeans and gray sandals, looked
like every other student who uses
the computer facility.
"The whole place was frozen
while this was occurring," said
Kennedy, who called the police im
mediately after the incident.
Three police officers searched
for the suspect, but he had not yet
been found as of about 8 p.m. last
night.
According to James, a descrip
tion will be given to all officers
and a "be on your look out"
search will continue. Fingerprints
were taken from the glass door of

the cluster for future investiga
tion.
Along with the estimated
$4,000 worth of damage, the sus
pect temporarily disabled sections
of the cluster. The row of comput
ers in the same area of the Cen
tris 650 CPU was unable to print
for 20 to 30 minutes after the
incident. The internal network
was also damaged by the ripping
of cords and alarm cables, accord
ing to consultant Paxton Cooper.
