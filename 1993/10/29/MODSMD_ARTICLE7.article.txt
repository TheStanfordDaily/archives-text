# Conflicting schedules delay conflict policy
## 'Living, educational document' to be ready by end of quarter 
### Josh Green Staff writer 
The University will have to wait until at
least the end of fall quarter to have a new poli
cy on faculty conflicts of interest, according to
Biology Prof. Craig Heller, chair of the Com
mittee on Research.
The committee was asked by the Faculty
Senate in April to have a final draft of the poli
cy ready by yesterday, but it failed to meet that
deadline.
Members of the committee say the delay
was caused by normal committee problems,

such as members' conflicting
schedules and long, thorough
discussions of each point of
the policy.
"We tried to get some work
done this sum mer, but we had
almost a zero-success rate,"
Heller said "No one's here
during the summer, and we
rarely had a quorum to get
things done."

Two-thirds of the committee is required to
take a vote on particular issues in the policy, he
said.

Heller said that the 25-page draft of the re
port still under review contains many diverse
issues. In order to make it an "educational doc
ument," each point had to he thoroughly dis
cussed and made as clear a* possible.
"We're blessed with a lot of intelligent peo
ple who like to discuss things. ... It makes it
slow," Heller said.
Heller said that the committee recently was
asked by the University to evaluate some indi
vidual cases, putting the policy work on hold.
