# Conflicting schedules delay conflict policy
## 'Living, educational document' to be ready by end of quarter 
### Josh Green Staff writer 
The University will have to wait until at
least the end of fall quarter to have a new poli
cy on faculty conflicts of interest, according to
Biology Prof. Craig Heller, chair of the Com
mittee on Research.
The committee was asked by the Faculty
Senate in April to have a final draft of the poli
cy ready by yesterday, but it failed to meet that
deadline.
Members of the committee say the delay
was caused by normal committee problems,

such as members' conflicting
schedules and long, thorough
discussions of each point of
the policy.
"We tried to get some work
done this sum mer, but we had
almost a zero-success rate,"
Heller said "No one's here
during the summer, and we
rarely had a quorum to get
things done."

Two-thirds of the committee is required to
take a vote on particular issues in the policy, he
said.

Heller said that the 25-page draft of the re
port still under review contains many diverse
issues. In order to make it an "educational doc
ument," each point had to he thoroughly dis
cussed and made as clear a* possible.
"We're blessed with a lot of intelligent peo
ple who like to discuss things. ... It makes it
slow," Heller said.
Heller said that the committee recently was
asked by the University to evaluate some indi
vidual cases, putting the policy work on hold.
Chemistry Prof. Steven Boxer, a committee


Heller
member, said that committee
members want to make the policy
"a living thing, something that
evolves."
Boxer said the policy will be
structured like the U.S. Constitu
tion, complete with a "Bill of
Rights" that can be shaped and
interpreted by individual cases
that arise in the future.
Previous Stanford policies on
conflicts of interest have been
very restrictive and conservative
compared to other universities,
Boxer said.
One issue being discussed is

whether the University will
accept equity payments in place of
cash royalties for patents from
companies in which faculty mem
bers have a substantial interest.
This issue affects students,
Boxer said, because many stu
dents are involved in research
projects that result in new inven
tions or patents. Many students
also get jobs from faculty-owned
companies, according to Boxer.
Biology Prof. Patricia Jones,
chair of the senate, said that the
senate is not going to pressure the
committee to finish before the
group is done drafting the policy.
"This policy will affect differ
ent members of faculty in very dif
ferent types of research. This is

something that if you're going to
do it, you should do it right,"
Jones said.
Communication Prof. Marion
Lewenstein, academic secretary,
said that University President
Gerhard Casper is anxious to get
the policy finished faster than
usual, but there are "endless
problems" in drafting such a doc
ument.
Conflicting faculty schedules
make it difficult for committees to
work on strict deadlines, Lewen
stein said.
"I guess in business it would be
different, where you have to show
up whenever your boss wants you
to," Lewenstein said. "That isn't
the way academia works."
