# Firefighters give Foothills a break
## New fire line an attempt to protect homes, campus 
### Tish Williams Senior staff writer 
In an attempt to prevent the Foothills from suf
fering a tragedy like the one now devastating
southern California, the Stanford Fire Department
recently constructed a break line 50 feet wide along
Junipero Serra Highway.
The break line — a line of dirt designed to pre
vent the spread of fire — separates the Foothills
from homes in the area, and was approved by the
Santa Clara County Fire Marshal's weed abate
ment office on Tuesday, according to Stanford Fire
Marshal Ray Gamma.
"They were extremely happy with our breaks,"
Gamma said. "They said they were more than ade
quate."
Palo Alto Fire Marshal Phil Constantine seemed
confident that the city's roofing and sprinkler ordi
nances would make the consequences of a potential
fire in the Stanford area "less devastating."
Constantine's concern about a potential fire
stems from a 1992 fire in the Foothills, which
charred about 550 acres near the Dish.
Gamma said Santa Clara County does not
require the cutting of grass in the Foothills — a
potential fire hazard — but instead mandates 10-
foot break lines along Junipero Serra. The county
recently expressed concern about these lines, how
ever, and Gamma added that next year the Stan
ford Fire Department will be constructing two 30-
foot-wide break lines bordering the road.
In the greater Los Angeles area, wildfires
engulfed 113,000 acres, destroying 580 homes as of
yesterday afternoon. Five Southland counties —•
Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, Riverside and San
Diego counties — were declared federal disaster
areas by President Clinton.
"That fire could happen anywhere in California
with that kind of wind and that kind of fire,"
Gamma said.
The region has witnessed 90-degree tempera

tures this week, exacerbated by 70 mph winds and
low humidity on Wednesday — conditions some
what similar to those in the Bay Area this week.
About 25,000 residents were displaced by differ
ent blazes in cities such as Laguna Beach, Altade
na and Malibu, and officials believe several of the
fires were begun by arson. Among those affected
were the families and neighbors of many Stanford
students.
Several students from the Laguna Beach area —
one of the areas hardest hit in the blaze —
expressed relief yesterday after learning their
houses remained unscathed.
"The fire had approached our house, but we got
really lucky — suddenly the wind shifted direc
tions," said junior Erinn Johnson.
Other students described close calls, with wind
changes saving their homes from destruction.
"I found out late last night that our house is
fine. It stopped a block (from) my street," said
sophomore Fred Gilbert. "I was really relieved. I'm
glad our house made it, but it's a really sad situa
tion."
Late Wednesday night and early yesterday
morning, several students from the Laguna Beach
area finally heard from their parents. Downed
phone lines and crowded evacuation routes have
made communication difficult with relatives in the
fire-stricken region.
"We don't know (he whole extent of the damage,
but we think our house is OK," said senior Jen
nifer Triebwasser. "It burned the hill above our
house, but the wind shifted north, we're hoping
maybe before it hit our house. ... I was in hyster
ics last night, watching my town in flames, but my
parents think our house is OK.
"It's funny what my mom was able to take with
her. I asked her how she could be so calm about it.
She took my senior yearbook, all our photo albums,
the firebox with insurance papers — she basically
loaded up the car. She even got paintings off the
wall," Triebwasser said.
