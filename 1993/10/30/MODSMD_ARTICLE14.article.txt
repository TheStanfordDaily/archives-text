# Stanford team morale still high but intensity lacking
## 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
The Stanford football team is a
lot like a Timex watch. It takes a
lickin' but keeps on tickin'.
Last Saturday, the Cardinal
dropped a 38-30 decision to Ari
zona State, leaving the squad
with a record of 2-5. The loss to a
team which Stanford was expect
ed to beat has raised questions
about team morale, or lack there
of.
However, most players seem to
have a positive outlook. For the
most part, they view themselves
as having played well against some
of the better teams in the nation
and believe that they are now

heading into the weaker part of
their schedule.
"We have another game this Sat
urday and everyone is excited," said
senior running back Ellery Roberts.
"It's a good chance to make up for
mistakes in the past four games. I'd
say that morale is upbeat."
However, this view is a quali
fied one.
"Morale is good," said head
coach Bill Walsh. "I mean, it's as
good as it could be under the cir
cumstances. You're starting to
struggle right about there."
Junior center T.J. Gaynor
agreed.
"Team morale is good, but
we're obviously disappointed with
the way our season's been going."

While no one is on the verge of
suicide, there seems to be a gener
al consensus that the intensity
which marked last year's drive to
the Pac-10 championship and the
Blockbuster Bowl is not as evident
in this year's squad.
"I think that's pretty obvious,"
said Roberts. "It has to do with new
guys finding themselves and uncer
tainty as far as assignments."
Walsh also feels that this may
be a problem.
"The key is to keep the intensity
because it doesn't look like a bowl
year and most of the time we're
fighting for a bowl," he said. "You
need a reason to play and sometimes
you really have to reach for it to find
it. OSU is a Pac-10 opponent that we
play year in and year out and that's
a reason to play the game. I wouldn't
say morale's bad, but I think inten
sity is what you might lose."
A large reason for the change in
focus and concentration can be
found just by looking at a team ros
ter. There has been an extremely
large turnover rate in personnel
from last year's 10-3 squad, leaving
a much younger team than the one
that took the field a season ago.
"When you replace 25 guys who
have been here for five years with
25 guys who have been here for
five months, you're obviously
going to see a drop-off in experi
ence," said Gaynor.
Walsh has had his hands full
dealing with the trials and tribula
tions of what is most likely the best
recruiting class in Stanford history.
"This team is so different than
last year," said Walsh. "Last year
we had any number of top senior
players who were leaders. This
team is primarily a freshman
team. Freshmen don't feel the tra
dition of games or the competition
of the Pac-10. They're just trying
to survive. They're just trying to
play game-to-game. It makes it
tougher to read how they are. The
effort level has been good. It think
that injuries have tried us a little
bit. We're working with less expe
rience even more than before."
Many of the younger players
were placed in key positions at the
beginning of the season. Injuries
to veteran players like Justin Ar
mour and Tommy Knecht have
pushed even more freshman into
the spotlight.
"A lot of guys are playing who
didn't think they would be playing
and it kind of caught them off
guard," said Roberts. "I think by
the end of the season they'll prove
that they're worth the shot that
they got."
This large pool of youth that
has been forced to play unexpect
edly gives Stanford football a legit
imate excuse to explain its prob
lems this year. It also gives them
hope. Not only are they now tested
for their final battles this year, but
they will also be ready for to re
sume the gridiron war next year.
