# 'Touchdown Tommy' opens his act in NFL
## 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
"Touchdown Tommy" has brought his act
to the National Football League. One of the
first 10 draftees in 1992, Tommy Vardell is
now using the strength and speed which dom
inated the Pacific 10 Conference in 1992 to
anchor the Cleveland Browns running attack.
Vardell graduated from Stanford that
year with a degree in industrial engineering
and excelled in both academics and athletics.
When not leading the Cardinal on the grid
iron, Vardell earned a 3.2 GPA and graduat
ed with honors. He was elected to the First-
Team Academic All-Pac-10 squad in 1991.
"He's very intelligent and he brings that
with him to the game of football," said Cleve
land Browns head coach Bill Belichick. "He
never misses an assignment and he's im
proved all the players around him."
On the Farm, Vardell set numerous
Stanford football records and was selected
to the Ail-American team in 1991. Vardell's
1,084-yard senior season included 20 rush
ing touchdowns, both all-time Cardinal
records. He scored 37 touchdowns on the
ground in his career and led Stanford to the
Aloha Bowl in 1991.
The former Cardinal is a powerful runner
with deceptive speed. He fits perfectly into the
Browns' ball-control offense with his inside
running ability. However, he has also shown
himself capable of busting open the big play.
Many, including football legend Jim
Brown, have called Vardell a throwback to
the days of ironman football with his grind
ing running ability. Yet his speed is perhaps
his greatest asset. In his final season at
Stanford, Vardell had runs of 48, 41, 30, 27
and 25 yards. Earlier this year he out-ran
defensive backs for a 54-yard gain.
"A lot of people say he is like an old-time
fullback, but I think he is a back of the past,
present and future," said Arizona State
head coach Bruce Snyder in an interview
with Sports Illustrated's Douglas S.
Looney. Snyder saw plenty of Vardell when
he coached the California Golden Bears.
"[Tommy] is a quick, slashing, inside run
ner who also has good quickness and the abil
ity to catch the ball out of the backfield," said
former Stanford head coach Dennis Green,
now with the NFL Minnesota Vikings.
In his second year with the Browns,
Vardell is proving himself capable of living
up to his reputation as a strong and tough
running back. Vardell joined a team with a
poor running attack and has helped Cleve
land climb to third in the conference in
rushing. Vardell is a major reason why the
Browns sit atop the AFC Central division
with a record of 5-2.
"He's given us some toughness and con

sistency and really brought our running
game around," said Browns running backs
coach Steve Crosby. "It took him some time
to adapt to the pro game but he picks up on
things quicker than most and, if he keeps
progressing, he could be one of the top play
ers in the league."
So far this year Vardell ranks sixth in the
AFC in rushing with 379 total yards. His
rushing average of 4.1 yards per carry is
among the league's best.
"He leads by example," said Belichick.
"Tommy's not one to give a long, inspira
tional locker-room speech, but he's earned
the respect of his peers."
Despite his success this season, Vardell
still misses college football for the cama
raderie he shared with his' Cardinal team
mates. Vardell said he has found playing in
the NFL more of a job than playing for
pride. "It's a lot different from college," said
Vardell. "You strap up the helmet, go out
and play, and come home afterwards."
Vardell said the most difficult transition
to the pro game has not been the physical
side, but the mental one. He did not antici
pate the type of pressure placed on profes
sional football players by the media. After
failing to score a single touchdown in his
first year, some members of the Cleveland
press dubbed him "Touchdownless
Tommy." At the time, Vardell was playing
in a back-up role and rarely came into the
game in goal-line situations."
"You're driving and you flip on the radio
and some guy is critiquing your perfor
mance," said Vardell. "I'm the type of play
er who likes to please his coaches. And
everyone wants to be liked by the fans. The
Cleveland press loves controversy. I've
learned not to take stock in other people's
opinions. To me it's not worth riding down
that emotional roller coaster."
Vardell has had his doubters before. As
late as his junior year at Stanford, he was
cast as a third-string running back. Even
before his tremendous senior year, in which
he averaged 98.6 yards rushing per game,
he shared the backfield spotlight with Glyn
Milburn, now with the Denver Broncos.
"I've had to really dig deep to get that
white-heartedness, that pure enjoyment of
playing in your backyard until your mom
calls you in for dinner," said Vardell.
He's also had to adapt to a new lifestyle.
"I don't like working full time," he laughed.
"I like the idea of being able to go to my two
classes, go home and take a nap for an hour,
then go to practice."
Vardell's average of 10.91 points-per-game
his senior year led the Pac-10 Conference and
placed him second in the nation. During that
season, the El Cajon, Calif, native had seven
100-yard rushing performances.

One ofVardell's most remarkable Cardinal
statistics involved his consistency. In his 418
carries at Stanford, Vardell never fumbled the
ball. In addition, during his entire collegiate
career, Vardell was never called for a penalty.
"My goal is to make the most out of what
I've been given," said Vardell while at Stan
ford. "Aggressive-style running is my style.

That's what I've found is most productive."
With his dedication, ability, and perspec
tive, "Touchdown" Tommy Vardell is sure to
be a fixture in the NFL for years to come.
"He's everything we thought he'd be and
more," said Belichick. "He's brought every
thing we expected as a person and a player. I'd
take 44 more like him on my roster any day."
