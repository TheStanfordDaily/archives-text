# Young's wishbone is Stanford's nightmare
## Junior halfback carves apart opposing teams with 8-yard average per carry 
### Jeremy Stone 
Oregon State halfback J.J. Young is mak
ing games against the Beavers much
tougher than they used to be.
Young's 640 yards rushing this season
have helped transform the perennially
struggling Beavers into a squad other teams
shouldn't overlook. His string of three con
secutive 100-yard rushing games ended last
week in OSU's narrow 20-17 loss to UCLA,
but it was the longest such streak by a
Beaver running back since Bill Enyart ac
complished the feat 25 years ago. the series
was the culmination of a long road traveled
by Young since his arrival in Corvallis in
1990.
He was originally recruited as a corner
back, and earned All-Rio Hondo League
honors at South Pasadena High School in
Pasadena, Ca., but was converted to run
ning back and redshirted in 1990.
When current OSU head coach Jerry
Pettibone was hired the next year, Young's
quickness attracted the attention of the new
staff. He was timed at 4.48 in the 40-yard
dash in spring practice and became the
starting right halfback in the OSU wish
bone attack. "He was a very pleasant sur
prise, and he established himself as a real
quality player," said Pettibone.
Young was shifted to left halfback and
then sprained his right knee, which dramat
ically reduced his quickness and limited him
to only 169 yards on 64 rushes, for an aver
age of a meager 2.6 yards per carry.
Beaver fans pointed to 1992 as the year
when Young would emerge, but he was
once again sidelined during fall camp.
This time, a stress fracture in his left leg
caused him to miss the first seven games
of the season. In the final four games, he
managed to amass 69 yards on 13 carries.
The disappointing results of the first two
seasons dropped Young to the No. 2 spot
on the depth chart entering the 1993 sea
son.

In the spring, he earned his starting job
back, and his performance this year should
assure him of that job until his career at
OSU ends. The injuries that hampered him
in the prior two years have healed, and his
speed has not diminished.
"He's probably the fastest player on our
team and would compete for one of the
fastest players in the league," said OSU of
fensive coordinator and running backs
coach Mike Summers.
Young quickly laid to rest any skeptics'
doubts by opening the season with a bang,
gaining 119 yards on six carries against
Wyoming. After gaining only 100 yards
combined in the next three games (despite
an 8.0 yards-per-carry average against the
stingy Arizona defense), he rushed for 105
yards against Arizona State, 162 against
Pacific, and 101 against USC. The 162 yards
in the UOP game led a team rushing attack
that netted 667 yards, a new Oregon State
record.
Summers was not surprised by his emer
gence. "The fact that he's been hampered
by injuries has slowed his progress, but we
could always see his potential," Summers
said. "He has been able to realize our ex
pectations by playing in eight games so far
[this season] and staying relatively injury
free."
While Young has performed exceptional
ly, the team's rushing game has also flour
ished. The Beavers have averaged 305.1
yards per game on the ground, first in the
Pac-10 by nearly 100 yards per game, and
second in Division I-A to Army. Young's 640
yards rank him second in the Pacific 10
Conference to Washington's Napolean
Kaufman (798), and nobody in the Pac-10
remotely approaches his 8.0 yard average
per carry.
Despite the balanced attack, Young is
certainly the man to watch today. As Sum
mers commented, "We want to have the ball
in his hands, and he's been able to produce
when we've done that."

In the spring, he earned his starting job
back, and his performance this year should
assure him of that job until his career at
OSU ends. The injuries that hampered him
in the prior two years have healed, and his
speed has not diminished.
"He's probably the fastest player on our
team and would compete for one of the
fastest players in the league," said OSU of
fensive coordinator and running backs
coach Mike Summers.
Young quickly laid to rest any skeptics'
doubts by opening the season with a bang,
gaining 119 yards on six carries against
Wyoming. After gaining only 100 yards
combined in the next three games (despite
an 8.0 yards-per-carry average against the
stingy Arizona defense), he rushed for 105
yards against Arizona State, 162 against
Pacific, and 101 against USC. The 162 yards
in the UOP game led a team rushing attack
that netted 667 yards, a new Oregon State
record.
Summers was not surprised by his emer
gence. "The fact that he's been hampered
by injuries has slowed his progress, but we
could always see his potential," Summers
said. "He has been able to realize our ex
pectations by playing in eight games so far
[this season] and staying relatively injury
free."
While Young has performed exceptional
ly, the team's rushing game has also flour
ished. The Beavers have averaged 305.1
yards per game on the ground, first in the
Pac-10 by nearly 100 yards per game, and
second in Division I-A to Army. Young's 640
yards rank him second in the Pacific 10
Conference to Washington's Napolean
Kaufman (798), and nobody in the Pac-10
remotely approaches his 8.0 yard average
per carry.
Despite the balanced attack, Young is
certainly the man to watch today. As Sum
mers commented, "We want to have the ball
in his hands, and he's been able to produce
when we've done that."
