# Cardinal looks to get back on track vs. OSU
## 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Editorial staff 
After a last-second comeback vic
tory Sept. 18 over Colorado, Stan
ford stood at 2-1 and was ranked
17th nationally. What a difference
five weeks can make. Since that
time, the Cardinal has lost four con
secutive games and dropped com
pletely out of the national rankings.
Stanford will try to end its losing
streak today as it faces Pacific-10
Conference opponent Oregon State.
The Beavers, who most college
football analysts picked to finish
dead last in the Pac-10, have sur
prised many by winning three
games and compiling a 3-5 record,
which includes a close 20-17 loss to
UCLA last week in Corvallis.
Jerry Pettibone, in his third
season as Oregon State head

coach, recognized the importance
of today's game. "This is a big
game for us. Stanford has a good
football team. They throw the
football well," Pettibone said.
"They are a very explosive offen
sive football team. They can move
the football and score points."
The Beavers have run the ball
with great success in 1993; they
are second in the nation in rushing
(behind Army) with 305.1 rushing
yards per game. In fact, nine differ
ent Oregon State players have car
ried the ball 25 or more times this
season. Their wishbone offense
prominently features running
back J.J. Young, who is currently
fourth in the Pac-10 in rushing
with 640 yards on only 80 carries.
Despite its success running the
football, Oregon State has had little
luck with its passing game. No Ore

gon State receiver has caught 10
passes yet in 1993, and the longest
pass completion the Beavers have
had totalled only 20 yards.
At quarterback, the Beavers
are thin due to injuries to starter
lan Shields and backup Don
Shanklin. Freshman Rahim
Muhammad will start after play
ing extremely well during the first
eight games of the season as both a
halfback and a quarterback.
Three weeks ago against Pacific,
Muhammad had a 63-yard run; last
week against UCLA, he had a 32-
yard dash. "Rahim played extreme
ly well'against UCLA," Pettibone
said. "He has progressed a great
deal in two weeks. He has practiced
hard and he did a much better job
against UCLA of reading the option
play. He made the reads that creat
ed yards inside and outside."

Cardinal coach Bill Walsh ex
pressed significant concern over
Stanford's ability to stop Oregon
State's wishbone attack. "[The
Beavers] have a different style of
football which they use very effec
tively," said Walsh. "This will be
our most difficult project in de
fending a style of football which
gave us problems in the past and
will give us problems in this
game."
The Stanford offense is led by
senior quarterback Steve Sten
strom, who last week completed
23 of 37 passes for 328 yards and
three touchdowns. Stenstrom
placed his name in the Cardinal
record book once again by passing
for over 300 yards for the sixth
straight game, making him the
only quarterback in Stanford his
tory to accomplish that feat.

Stenstrom leads a passing of
fense that is currently the best in
the Pac-10 and number six nation
ally. In the last six games, Stan
ford is averaging 339.3 yards pass
ing. The Cardinal is on pace to
break its own Pac-10 record for
most yards passing in a season,
3,311, set primarily by Stanford's
John Elway in 1982.
Despite Stenstrom's success at
quarterback, the Cardinal receiv
ing corps has been hobbled by in
juries. Starting split end Justin
Armour will miss another game
due to a separated shoulder and
freshman wide receiver Brian
Manning will see limited playing
time due to a hamstring injury
that kept him out of last week's
game against Arizona State. Ju
nior Mark Harris did a more than
adequate job filling in for Armour
last week, catching seven passes
for 160 yards and a touchdown.
The lethargic Cardinal running
game has yet to get on track this
year. They are averaging a mere
65.7 yards per game, dead last in
the Pac-10, but picked up 100
yards last week for only the second
time in 1993. Fullback Ethan
Allen rumbled 82 yards for a
touchdown, a 1993 Stanford best,
and tailback Ellery Roberts had
his highest output of the season,
gaining 59 yards on 10 carries.
Oregon State will try to throw
Stanford off sync by taking
chances defensively and blitzing
frequently. "They're a blitzing,
gambling defense. They blitz more
than anyone in the Pac-10, "
Walsh said. "We have to deal with
it and be patient in what we do."
However, because of the
Beavers' pressure defense, Walsh
believes that the Cardinal running
game will not come into play this
game. "This is not a team to run on
because thay have eight-man
fronts and blitz on virtually every
down," Walsh said. "So we're
going to have to win by passing."
Harris believes this is a crucial
game for the Cardinal at this stage
of the season. He added, "There is
a sense of urgency because we
want to win with younger, inexpe
rienced players to give us confi
dence for next season."
For the Cardinal, there is no
better opportunity than now.

Arizona State's Mario Bates finds himself in traffic last week in ASU's 38-30 defeat of Stanford. Bates shredded the Cardinal defense for 127

and Chad Paulson.

ing extremely well during the first
eight games of the season as both a
halfback and a quarterback.
Three weeks ago against Pacific,
Muhammad had a 63-yard run; last
week against UCLA, he had a 32-
yard dash. "Rahim played extreme
ly well'against UCLA," Pettibone
said. "He has progressed a great
deal in two weeks. He has practiced
hard and he did a much better job
against UCLA of reading the option
play. He made the reads that creat
ed yards inside and outside."

Cardinal coach Bill Walsh ex
pressed significant concern over
Stanford's ability to stop Oregon
State's wishbone attack. "[The
Beavers] have a different style of
football which they use very effec
tively," said Walsh. "This will be
our most difficult project in de
fending a style of football which
gave us problems in the past and
will give us problems in this
game."
The Stanford offense is led by
senior quarterback Steve Sten
strom, who last week completed
23 of 37 passes for 328 yards and
three touchdowns. Stenstrom
placed his name in the Cardinal
record book once again by passing
for over 300 yards for the sixth
straight game, making him the
only quarterback in Stanford his
tory to accomplish that feat.

Stenstrom leads a passing of
fense that is currently the best in
the Pac-10 and number six nation
ally. In the last six games, Stan
ford is averaging 339.3 yards pass
ing. The Cardinal is on pace to
break its own Pac-10 record for
most yards passing in a season,
3,311, set primarily by Stanford's
John Elway in 1982.
Despite Stenstrom's success at
quarterback, the Cardinal receiv
ing corps has been hobbled by in
juries. Starting split end Justin
Armour will miss another game
due to a separated shoulder and
freshman wide receiver Brian
Manning will see limited playing
time due to a hamstring injury
that kept him out of last week's
game against Arizona State. Ju
nior Mark Harris did a more than
adequate job filling in for Armour
last week, catching seven passes
for 160 yards and a touchdown.
The lethargic Cardinal running
game has yet to get on track this
year. They are averaging a mere
65.7 yards per game, dead last in
the Pac-10, but picked up 100
yards last week for only the second
time in 1993. Fullback Ethan
Allen rumbled 82 yards for a
touchdown, a 1993 Stanford best,
and tailback Ellery Roberts had
his highest output of the season,
gaining 59 yards on 10 carries.
Oregon State will try to throw
Stanford off sync by taking
chances defensively and blitzing
frequently. "They're a blitzing,
gambling defense. They blitz more
than anyone in the Pac-10, "
Walsh said. "We have to deal with
it and be patient in what we do."
However, because of the
Beavers' pressure defense, Walsh
believes that the Cardinal running
game will not come into play this
game. "This is not a team to run on
because thay have eight-man
fronts and blitz on virtually every
down," Walsh said. "So we're
going to have to win by passing."
Harris believes this is a crucial
game for the Cardinal at this stage
of the season. He added, "There is
a sense of urgency because we
want to win with younger, inexpe
rienced players to give us confi
dence for next season."
For the Cardinal, there is no
better opportunity than now.

Arizona State's Mario Bates finds himself in traffic last week in ASU's 38-30 defeat of Stanford. Bates shredded the Cardinal defense for 127
yards rushing. The defense will have its hands full again this week against OSU's wishbone offense, which features running backs J.J. Young
and Chad Paulson.
After a last-second comeback vic
tory Sept. 18 over Colorado, Stan
ford stood at 2-1 and was ranked
17th nationally. What a difference
five weeks can make. Since that
time, the Cardinal has lost four con
secutive games and dropped com
pletely out of the national rankings.
Stanford will try to end its losing
streak today as it faces Pacific-10
Conference opponent Oregon State.
The Beavers, who most college
football analysts picked to finish
dead last in the Pac-10, have sur
prised many by winning three
games and compiling a 3-5 record,
which includes a close 20-17 loss to
UCLA last week in Corvallis.
Jerry Pettibone, in his third
season as Oregon State head

coach, recognized the importance
of today's game. "This is a big
game for us. Stanford has a good
football team. They throw the
football well," Pettibone said.
"They are a very explosive offen
sive football team. They can move
the football and score points."
The Beavers have run the ball
with great success in 1993; they
are second in the nation in rushing
(behind Army) with 305.1 rushing
yards per game. In fact, nine differ
ent Oregon State players have car
ried the ball 25 or more times this
season. Their wishbone offense
prominently features running
back J.J. Young, who is currently
fourth in the Pac-10 in rushing
with 640 yards on only 80 carries.
Despite its success running the
football, Oregon State has had little
luck with its passing game. No Ore

gon State receiver has caught 10
passes yet in 1993, and the longest
pass completion the Beavers have
had totalled only 20 yards.
At quarterback, the Beavers
are thin due to injuries to starter
lan Shields and backup Don
Shanklin. Freshman Rahim
Muhammad will start after play
ing extremely well during the first
eight games of the season as both a
halfback and a quarterback.
