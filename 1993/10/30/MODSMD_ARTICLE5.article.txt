# Bryant plays big brother on field and off
## Senior shows freshmen defensive backs, younger sibling how it's done 
### Peter Marks Editorial staff 
Darrien Gordon, Vaughn
Bryant's best friend and partner
in the Stanford secondary, is gone.
So are hard-hitting safeties John
Lynch and Seyon Albert. They've

moved on, leaving Bryant sur
rounded by rosy-cheeked fresh
men still living on high-school
memories. From last year's sec
ondary, only Bryant remains.
Now it's Bryant, a senior,
whom the other defensive backs
come to when they need playing

advice. What should you antici
pate on second and two? What do
you do when the tight end moves
inside? Bryant answers them in
his calm, baritone voice, then
shows them how it's done.
"He's very calm on the field,"
said Eliel Swinton, a freshman
cornerback. "He just takes care of
business that's Vaughn."
Average-sized for a cornerback
at 5-foot-9-inches, 180 pounds,
Bryant possesses good football in
stincts, according to Stanford sec
ondary coach Tom Holmoe. A for
mer high-school track athlete,
Bryant also has the speed neces
sary for covering the nation's
fastest receivers.
"I'm real quiet, keep to myself
and just try to get myjob done," ad
mits Bryant. "I think my role, ide
ally, should have been more vocal
to the younger guys, but because I
got hurt it made it difficult."
Bryant injured his hamstring
in August and could only practice
twice before Stanford's first game,
but contrary to what he says, nei
ther the injury nor his reserved
manner stopped him from becom
ing a role model to the team's
freshmen defensive backs. "I look
at Vaughn as a big brother, father
type figure," said Swinton. "We
joke about how we can ask Vaughn
anything. I go to Vaughn for girl
problems. He talks really slow,
very calmly and says: v Okay, this is
what you do.' "
It's fitting that his teammates
should look up to Bryant because
he's a man who knows how impor
tant role models are. Bryant's par
ents divorced when he was in
grammar school and he says it
made him realized how important
a role parents play in a child's de
velopment.
"I think about that so much,"
he said. "Just the importance of
other friends that I had whose par
ents were both in the home, and
just the importance of parents to a
child, or even support for just a
person to be able to mature and
handle situations.
"You always need good advice
from the people you're around.
And for me to make it this far I
feel like I've been lucky to always
be surrounded by people who
gave me good advice wherever I
was."
Nonetheless, Bryant has made
most of the major decisions in his
life on his own. For Bryant, who is
from Detroit, one of those choices
included attending St. Mary's, a
predominately white, male prep
school. Rob Hager, the St. Mary's
head football coach who became
one of Bryant's mentors, remem
bers meeting him. "He struck me

with a presence of a great deal of
character and strength," said
Hager. "He seemed like a young
man determined to do the right
things to prepare himself for excel
lence, for greatness. He was a very
willing student and athlete."
At St. Mary's, Bryant took over
the starting quarterback position
in his sophomore year. In his next
two seasons, Bryant led his team
to a level Hager said St. Mary's
never would have achieved with
out him. Bryant passed for 1,023
yards and 11 touchdowns, and ran
for another 297 yards and 4 touch
downs in his senior season.

Awards naturally followed: All-
Catholic, All-Metro, All-League.
Throw in honor-roll student
and National Honor Society mem
ber as well. Bryant pushed himself
academically. "If I hadn't gone to
college it wouldn't have been that
big a deal," said Bryant. "I could
have just got a job. It's funny I
ended up here of all places."
That Bryant did end up at
Stanford is not surprising to
Hager, who now coaches at West
Los Angeles College. "He never
struck me as a guy who would go
along with the crowd," said
Hager. "He had some friends in
Detroit with as much talent, but
they didn't take care of business
as far as books, so they didn't put
themselves in a situation to get an
opportunity to play at a place like
Stanford. Vaughn took care of
business."
Once Bryant got to Stanford, he
had his tough times like any other
freshman, particularly those who
must balance athletics and acade
mics. Taking Cultures, Ideas and
Values and calculus while playing
football his first quarter some
times proved overwhelming. "Oh,
it was rough," said Bryant. "We
used to spend our nights in the
modules trying to get tutoring
from the calc(ulus) assistants. It
was really rough because mental
ly, football took up so much
amount of energy that it was hard
to concentrate at school at the
same time."

Bryant persevered. He switched
from quarterback to receiver and
finally, to his current position at
left cornerback, where he's started
30 games over the past three years.
Bryant entered the '92 season
amid much criticism some crit
ics said opposing teams would
throw at him. Bryant proved them
wrong, teaming up with Gordon to
form one of the most potent cor
nerback tandems in the country.
Bryant recorded 38 tackles while
leading the team in interceptions
with five. In the Blockbuster Bowl,
Bryant tamed the Nittany Lions
with five tackles, four pass deflec
tions and one interception. Other
coaches recognized Bryant's
achievements, naming him an
honorable mention All-Pacific 10
Conference.
But this year has been more
trying for Bryant.
With so many freshmen getting
significant playing time on de
fense while still learning the sys
tem, the Cardinal defense could
not play the attacking style that
ravaged its opponents last year. In
that blitzing scheme, Bryant and
Gordon were often left in man-to
man coverage, a situation on
which they thrived. Consequently,
the Stanford pass defense has suf
fered, giving up an average of 216
yards per game, next-to-last in the
Pac-10. "The bottom line is that
we're just not winning games,"
said Bryant. "If we were winning
games it (the statistics) wouldn't
matter."
Bryant has stepped up his game
the past two weeks and according
to Holmoe, the next four games
will determine whether the senior
gets a legitimate shot at playing in
the NFL.
Regardless, Bryant, who will
graduate in June with a sociology
degree, eventually plans on study
ing for a master's degree in social
work with an emphasis on mar
riage relations. "Relationships are
what I think about the most and
feel like I'm most talented at," said
Bryant. "That's where my heart
is."
In the meantime, Bryant will
continue to be the role model to
whom his teammates look for
guidance. It's a familiar role to
Bryant his younger brother
moved in with him after his sopho
more year. They share an apart
ment off campus and Bryant's
brother attends Gunn High
School. It's a lot of responsibility
for a 21-year-old.
"Yeah, it is," said Bryant. "But,
you know, you gotta' do what you
gotta' do."
As always, Vaughn Bryant is
taking care of business.

'I feel like I've been
lucky to always be
surrounded by
people who gave
me good advice

Cornerback Vaughn Bryant springs into action against an opponent's
offense. The senior from Detroit is the only remaining player from last
year's starting secondary.
Darrien Gordon, Vaughn
Bryant's best friend and partner
in the Stanford secondary, is gone.
So are hard-hitting safeties John
Lynch and Seyon Albert. They've

moved on, leaving Bryant sur
rounded by rosy-cheeked fresh
men still living on high-school
memories. From last year's sec
ondary, only Bryant remains.
Now it's Bryant, a senior,
whom the other defensive backs
come to when they need playing

advice. What should you antici
pate on second and two? What do
you do when the tight end moves
inside? Bryant answers them in
his calm, baritone voice, then
shows them how it's done.
"He's very calm on the field,"
said Eliel Swinton, a freshman
cornerback. "He just takes care of
business that's Vaughn."
Average-sized for a cornerback
at 5-foot-9-inches, 180 pounds,
Bryant possesses good football in
stincts, according to Stanford sec
ondary coach Tom Holmoe. A for
mer high-school track athlete,
Bryant also has the speed neces
sary for covering the nation's
fastest receivers.
"I'm real quiet, keep to myself
and just try to get myjob done," ad
mits Bryant. "I think my role, ide
ally, should have been more vocal
to the younger guys, but because I
got hurt it made it difficult."
Bryant injured his hamstring
in August and could only practice
twice before Stanford's first game,
but contrary to what he says, nei
ther the injury nor his reserved
manner stopped him from becom
ing a role model to the team's
freshmen defensive backs. "I look
at Vaughn as a big brother, father
type figure," said Swinton. "We
joke about how we can ask Vaughn
anything. I go to Vaughn for girl
problems. He talks really slow,
very calmly and says: v Okay, this is
what you do.' "
It's fitting that his teammates
should look up to Bryant because
he's a man who knows how impor
tant role models are. Bryant's par
ents divorced when he was in
grammar school and he says it
made him realized how important
a role parents play in a child's de
velopment.
"I think about that so much,"
he said. "Just the importance of
other friends that I had whose par
ents were both in the home, and
just the importance of parents to a
child, or even support for just a
person to be able to mature and
handle situations.
"You always need good advice
from the people you're around.
And for me to make it this far I
feel like I've been lucky to always
be surrounded by people who
gave me good advice wherever I
was."
Nonetheless, Bryant has made
most of the major decisions in his
life on his own. For Bryant, who is
from Detroit, one of those choices
included attending St. Mary's, a
predominately white, male prep
school. Rob Hager, the St. Mary's
head football coach who became
one of Bryant's mentors, remem
bers meeting him. "He struck me

with a presence of a great deal of
character and strength," said
Hager. "He seemed like a young
man determined to do the right
things to prepare himself for excel
lence, for greatness. He was a very
willing student and athlete."
At St. Mary's, Bryant took over
the starting quarterback position
in his sophomore year. In his next
two seasons, Bryant led his team
to a level Hager said St. Mary's
never would have achieved with
out him. Bryant passed for 1,023
yards and 11 touchdowns, and ran
for another 297 yards and 4 touch
downs in his senior season.

Awards naturally followed: All-
Catholic, All-Metro, All-League.
Throw in honor-roll student
and National Honor Society mem
ber as well. Bryant pushed himself
academically. "If I hadn't gone to
college it wouldn't have been that
big a deal," said Bryant. "I could
have just got a job. It's funny I
ended up here of all places."
That Bryant did end up at
Stanford is not surprising to
Hager, who now coaches at West
Los Angeles College. "He never
struck me as a guy who would go
along with the crowd," said
Hager. "He had some friends in
Detroit with as much talent, but
they didn't take care of business
as far as books, so they didn't put
themselves in a situation to get an
opportunity to play at a place like
Stanford. Vaughn took care of
business."
Once Bryant got to Stanford, he
had his tough times like any other
freshman, particularly those who
must balance athletics and acade
mics. Taking Cultures, Ideas and
Values and calculus while playing
football his first quarter some
times proved overwhelming. "Oh,
it was rough," said Bryant. "We
used to spend our nights in the
modules trying to get tutoring
from the calc(ulus) assistants. It
was really rough because mental
ly, football took up so much
amount of energy that it was hard
to concentrate at school at the
same time."

Bryant persevered. He switched
from quarterback to receiver and
finally, to his current position at
left cornerback, where he's started
30 games over the past three years.
Bryant entered the '92 season
amid much criticism some crit
ics said opposing teams would
throw at him. Bryant proved them
wrong, teaming up with Gordon to
form one of the most potent cor
nerback tandems in the country.
Bryant recorded 38 tackles while
leading the team in interceptions
with five. In the Blockbuster Bowl,
Bryant tamed the Nittany Lions
with five tackles, four pass deflec
tions and one interception. Other
coaches recognized Bryant's
achievements, naming him an
honorable mention All-Pacific 10
Conference.
But this year has been more
trying for Bryant.
With so many freshmen getting
significant playing time on de
fense while still learning the sys
tem, the Cardinal defense could
not play the attacking style that
ravaged its opponents last year. In
that blitzing scheme, Bryant and
Gordon were often left in man-to
man coverage, a situation on
which they thrived. Consequently,
the Stanford pass defense has suf
fered, giving up an average of 216
yards per game, next-to-last in the
Pac-10. "The bottom line is that
we're just not winning games,"
said Bryant. "If we were winning
games it (the statistics) wouldn't
matter."
Bryant has stepped up his game
the past two weeks and according
to Holmoe, the next four games
will determine whether the senior
gets a legitimate shot at playing in
the NFL.
Regardless, Bryant, who will
graduate in June with a sociology
degree, eventually plans on study
ing for a master's degree in social
work with an emphasis on mar
riage relations. "Relationships are
what I think about the most and
feel like I'm most talented at," said
Bryant. "That's where my heart
is."
In the meantime, Bryant will
continue to be the role model to
whom his teammates look for
guidance. It's a familiar role to
Bryant his younger brother
moved in with him after his sopho
more year. They share an apart
ment off campus and Bryant's
brother attends Gunn High
School. It's a lot of responsibility
for a 21-year-old.
"Yeah, it is," said Bryant. "But,
you know, you gotta' do what you
gotta' do."
