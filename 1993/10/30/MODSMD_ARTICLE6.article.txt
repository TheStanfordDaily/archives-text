# Oregon State/Stanford Match-Ups
## 
### 
Young leads the Beavers in rush
ing with 640 yards on only 80 car
ries. He was timed at 4.48 seconds
in the 40-yard dash, and is consid
ered one of the fastest backs in the
conference. Norwood walked onto
the Cardinal football team in 1990
and got his chance to play last year
after injuries to several lineback
ers. He made the most of the op
portunity, starting 12 games at in
side linebacker and recording 49
tackles. He's already surprassed
that total this year with 61 tack
les, second on the Cardinal to Coy
Gibbs's 63.

Remarkably, Paulson's average of
seven yards per carry ranks sec
ond to Young. The Beavers' senior
co-captain has gained 375 yards
on the ground, only about 75
yards less than the entire Stan
ford team. Fisk, a 1992 First-
Team Academic All-Pacific 10
Conference selection, will need to
use all of his smarts to stop
Young, Paulson and the rest of the
Beaver's wishbone offense. The
senior nose tackle is fourth on the
Cardinal in tackles with 47 but
has registered only one sack the
entire year.

Stanford keeps getting behind its
opponents, then has to pass the
ball to catch up. Luckily, it has a
quarterback as effective as Sten
strom, who had his sixth-straight
300-yard passing game last week,
setting a Stanford record. His tim
ing was a little off against Arizona
State with Justin Armour and
Brian Manning sidelined with in
juries, but Manning returns this
week. Muhammed, a redshirt
freshman, is small, (5-foot-8, 186
lbs.) and quick. He runs the 40-
yard dash in 4.5 seconds. He's in
experienced, but knows how to
run the option.

Ephraim made honorable men
tion All-Pac-10 last year and
wreaked havoc against Stanford
in last season's game, racking up
14 total tackles. He's the top guy
in the Beavers' secondary, and
lists watching Rung Fu flicks and
writing poetry as his current hob
bies. Harris has some different in
terests he spent two years in
Barcelona on a Mormon Mission.
The 23-year-old junior stepped in
for the injured Justin Armour last
week and stepped up, catching 7
passes for 160 yards and a touch
down. He gets another shot this
week against the second-best pass
defense in the Pac-10.

The two-best punters in the Pac
-10 duke it out: Mills ranks first
with an average of 41.9 yards per
punt, Kollas is second at 41.6
yards. The key to the game, how
ever, is not how far they will punt,
but how many times their teams
will force them to do so.

As Stanford students enter Meyer
Library, they see Rodin's master
piece, The Thinker. Perhaps it
gives them inspiration to study
well. As the Oregon State football
players enter Parker Stadium be
fore a game, they see the illustri
ous statue of . . . THE BRONZE
BEAVER. Perhaps it gives them
inspiration to ... no comment.
