# Reform nothing new to undergraduate education
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
While the 103-year history of Stan
ford's undergraduate program has been
marked by numerous reforms, the most
radical idea on the subject may still be the
one that Leland Stanford offered on the
first day of the University's existence.
In his founding address of Oct. 1,
1891, Stanford outlined his hopes and vi
sion for the University's future: "The im
mediate object of this institution is the
personal benefit and advancement of the
students," he said, "and we look beyond

to the influence it will have on the gener
al welfare of humanity."
But Stanford also posed a proposition
that would have reshaped the definition
of "undergraduate" forever: to eventual
ly extend the University's scope to edu
cate scholars from kindergarten all the
way through graduate school.
That ambitious expansion of the stu
dent body is as yet unrealized. Still, the
history of Stanford's undergraduate edu
cation is dynamic, filled with frequent
and rigorous examinations of undergrad
uate life that have changed the face of the
University and often affected higher edu

cation nationwide.
These past efforts at reforming the
undergraduate curriculum are of partic
ular importance now, as the Commission
on Undergraduate Education begins an
other re-evaluation and charts the course
for Stanford's second century.
The early years
The complexion of Stanford today is a
vast departure from what Leland Stan
ford intended when he established the
University. Yet the foundation of the
school, around which all reforms would
be shaped, remains generally unchanged:

an institution modeled on the German
university, one in which faculty are en
couraged to research and teach.
When it opened in 1891, Stanford con

sisted of just 23 departments; today, it
boasts 110. Impositions on students were
minimal â€” the only curricular require
ment was in English, and all classes were
open to all students.
However, students were encouraged
to choose a major upon arrival at the
Farm, and the Stanford education was
focused more on professional develop
ment than on scholarship. The Universi
ty hoped to "increase the demand and
supply for skilled labor, and decrease the
number of the non-producing class,"
