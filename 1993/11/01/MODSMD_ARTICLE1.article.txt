# Reform nothing new to undergraduate education
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
While the 103-year history of Stan
ford's undergraduate program has been
marked by numerous reforms, the most
radical idea on the subject may still be the
one that Leland Stanford offered on the
first day of the University's existence.
In his founding address of Oct. 1,
1891, Stanford outlined his hopes and vi
sion for the University's future: "The im
mediate object of this institution is the
personal benefit and advancement of the
students," he said, "and we look beyond

to the influence it will have on the gener
al welfare of humanity."
But Stanford also posed a proposition
that would have reshaped the definition
of "undergraduate" forever: to eventual
ly extend the University's scope to edu
cate scholars from kindergarten all the
way through graduate school.
That ambitious expansion of the stu
dent body is as yet unrealized. Still, the
history of Stanford's undergraduate edu
cation is dynamic, filled with frequent
and rigorous examinations of undergrad
uate life that have changed the face of the
University and often affected higher edu

cation nationwide.
These past efforts at reforming the
undergraduate curriculum are of partic
ular importance now, as the Commission
on Undergraduate Education begins an
other re-evaluation and charts the course
for Stanford's second century.
The early years
The complexion of Stanford today is a
vast departure from what Leland Stan
ford intended when he established the
University. Yet the foundation of the
school, around which all reforms would
be shaped, remains generally unchanged:

an institution modeled on the German
university, one in which faculty are en
couraged to research and teach.
When it opened in 1891, Stanford con

sisted of just 23 departments; today, it
boasts 110. Impositions on students were
minimal — the only curricular require
ment was in English, and all classes were
open to all students.
However, students were encouraged
to choose a major upon arrival at the
Farm, and the Stanford education was
focused more on professional develop
ment than on scholarship. The Universi
ty hoped to "increase the demand and
supply for skilled labor, and decrease the
number of the non-producing class,"

Stanford said. He maintained that
success in that realm would bring
about a "bloodless revolution and
establish a Republic of industry,
merit and learning."
A centerpiece of the Universi
ty's mission is to "give the student
a technical education, fitting him
for a successful business life,"
Stanford wrote in the University's
endowment.
But as America settled into its
industrial, corporate age, the Uni
versity began to reassess its objec
tives.
In 1916, Ray Lyman Wilbur,
the University'B second president,
emphasized that "the student's
principal business is his study —
any student not content to lead the
simple, clean, and industrious life
experienced on the Stanford cam
pus should go elsewhere."
Beginning in 1917, Wilbur
embarked on a series of reforms to
undergraduate education, some of
which have lasted to the present
day — including the switch from a
semester to a quarter system.
In 1919, Wilbur abolished the
"mcgor-professor" system — in
which students chose majors and
were assigned to faculty advisers
upon arrival on campus.
He also separated curricula for
freshmen and sophomores from
the advanced courses for juniors
and seniors. This shift took place
after a faculty review discovered
that students' schedules were
dominated by courses from their
chosen field of study.
The panel established a "lower
division" curriculum which man
dated that the first 90 units of
undergraduate study include class
es in a laboratory science, English,
a foreign language, history and
social programs. The panel also
instituted the first University
wide course requirement, "Prob
lems of Citizenship," which
focused on the "fundamental polit
ical, social, and economic problems
of the American people."
That requirement was broad
ened in 1934 by Edgar Robinson,
then-chair of the History Depart
ment, who expanded the scope of
the citizenship course, creating
"History of Western Civilization,"
which would become the subject of
numerous curricular debates in
the future.
1950s overhaul
The next mtgor change came in
1954, when former University
President J.E. Wallace Sterling
appointed an 11-man committee
— which included no students —
to conduct the Stanford Study of
Undergraduate Education, a com
prehensive, two-year examination
whose findings were published in a
118-page document titled "The
Undergraduate in the University."
The greatest structural change
the committee made was junking
the two-division format instituted
in 1919. In its place, the commis
sion proposed a "General Studies"
requirement — essentially allow
ing students to fulfill distribution
requirements over the course of
four years and to open advanced
courses to first- and second-year
undergraduates.
"We didn't see a sharp, intellec
tually defensible basis for the sepa
ration between the first and sec
ond years and the junior and

senior years," Political Science
Prof. Emeritus Hubert Marshall,
who co-authored the published
report, said in a recent interview.
"Students who had decent prepa
ration in a certain field needed to
move on to junior-level courses."
The new General Studies pro
gram mandated that, in addition to
coursework in his or her major, an
undergraduate was required to
take eight units in the humanities,
at least nine in natural sciences and
10 in social sciences. Western Civ.
was still required. Marshall noted
that the social science requirement
was the impetus for the creation of
introductory "1" courses in all
social science departments.
Marshall said that under the
format of the Western Civ. course,
all freshmen attended the same
lecture — often held in Memorial
Auditorium — and sections were
taught almost exclusively by grad
uate students.
The report also recommended
instituting freshman seminars
taught by senior faculty members,
a notion that turned out to be the
most contentious among the
report's statements. "It was the

harshest debate
we had," Mar
shall said. "There
was a set of senior
faculty members
who wanted to
focus on students
majoring in their
field, seniors, as
opposed to doing
things for fresh-

men." The recommendation, he
said, passed by "one or two votes."
Since then, the freshman semi
nars have "disappeared under the
pressures of departmentalization
and professional specialization."
The 1954 study included a sec
tion on "the quality of undergrad
uate teaching." Although no
definitive conclusions were made
on the issue, Marshall said the
study did illuminate a growing
problem for the University.
"The faculty's perception of
what counted in terms of promo
tions and appointments was over
whelmingly weighted towards
research. . . . Teaching wasn't
weighted at all," he said. "But
when faculty were asked what they
thought the proper balance should
be, the response was that [teaching
and research] ought to be weighted
equally." The question of how to
reconcile the two duties remains
unresolved.
1960s upheaval
The recommendations of the
1950s soon met challenge and ulti
mate upheaval. The turbulence
and anti-establishment sentiment
of the 1960s spread to the Univer
sity and prompted Sterling to
authorize the landmark, 10-vol
ume Study of Education at Stan
ford (SES), which examined every
thing from undergraduate educa
tion to admissions to overseas
campuses.
"An awful lot of things had
changed since the '50s — it was a
different culture entirely," said
History Prof. Mark Mancall, who
sat on the steering committee of
SES. "We felt it was important to
reconsider the whole institution,
that nothing was inappropriate to
be studied."
Sterling appointed a 10-person
steering committee, which subse

quently formed several study
groups to address particular
issues. "There was constant con
versation between the steering
committee and the various
groups," Mancall said.
"It was a very collegial group —
everybody had a voice," said
Michael Menke, a physics graduate
student at the time who was one of
three student members of the
steering committee. "I recall long,
long hours of discussion, with peo
ple devoting a lot of time to the
process."
Accordingly, the study took
three years to complete, its results
published in 1968. "ISterling's]
mandate was to take our time, and
that allowed us to do things that a
shorter time constraint doesn't
permit," Mancall said.
The fruits of the report were
sweeping. "Our recommendations
.. . are designed to free both tyach
er and student of trammels that
restrain the freedom to teach and
learn," the report said.

That spirit is
reflected in the
recommenda
tions: reduction
of distribution
requirements to
just two courses
of the student's
choice in each of
three areas —
humanities, social

sciences and natural sciences/tech
nology — creation of an individual
ly-designed major option and abol
ishment of the Western Civ.
requirement. "The opening up of
undergraduate education is the
most important thing to come of
[the recommendations]," Mancall
said.
"We felt very strongly that the
DR system had reached a dead end.
We had a sense that the under
graduate should be free to move
around within the University, and
that's what informed our deci
sions."
Mancall added that similar
philosophies underscored the
junking of Western Civ. "Western
Civ. did not seem to us at the time
to reflect what students of this
country should know,"he said.
"The idea of a common undergrad

uate experience, I believe, got lost
in the shuffle."
Today, Mancall concedes that
"whether that was the correct rea
soning I don't know."
Marshall and Mancall both said
the SES's proposals were unique
to the political environment that
produced them — in particular,
the constant questioning, within
the University and throughout
society, of just who should be in
charge.
"I think the faculty lost confi
dence in the way the University
was being run," Marshall said.
"We really lost confidence in our
own ability to make authoritative
statements about anything,
including the curriculum."
The rise of Western Culture
Although many of SES's pro
posals on undergraduate educa
tion were approved, the decline in
political activism and re-assertion
of "traditional" academic values
eventually eroded much of the
report's footholds. In 1975, the
Faculty Senate revamped the DR
system to include more courses.
Over the course of the next 15
years, the number of DRs
increased to the current nine. The
'70s were marked by the approval
of several new interdisciplinary
programs, from American Studies
to International Relations.
In 1976, the Faculty Senate,
citing a sharp decline in the num
ber of humanities majors,
endorsed a proposal to re-institute
a University-wide requirement in
Western civilization.
Two years later, the senate for
mally required a Western Culture
course. According to the commit
tee that made the proposal, the
decision was a "challenge to the
pessimistic assumption that a
good general education is impossi
ble here." In 1980, entering fresh
men chose among seven Western
Culture tracks. Seven years later,
Western Culture would be trans
formed again.
Kennedy and CIV
In his Oct. 12, 1980 inaugural
address as Stanford's eighth pres
ident, Donald Kennedy said that
"the challenge before us amounts

to nothing less than the reforma
tion of undergraduate education
at Stanford." His 12-year presi
dency was marked by numerous
reforms and initiatives aimed at
bolstering the University's under
graduate program.
Kennedy said that "during the
late '60s and early '70s, the Uni
versity had gone through a period
of disaffection. There were some
difficult times on campus." He
said he hoped to rectify such ten
sions by encouraging increased
faculty-student cooperation.
In 1983, the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies produced
substantial proposals to re-invigo
rate residential education, includ
ing the creation of theme houses
and incentives to "encourage more
active participation of Academic
Council members in the Residen
tial Fellow program."
Reflecting a concern articulat
ed in the mid-19705, Kennedy
also sought to bolster humanities
programs, creating the Humani
ties Center and pumping
increased financial support into
endowed professorships and fel
lowships. "Humanities loomed
very large in terms of the total
number of units taken," he said.
"I felt we needed to redouble the
strength of the University in the
humanities."
Yet the reform that gained the
most notoriety during the
Kennedy years proved to be the
change in 1988 of the Western
Culture course to the present Cul
tures, Ideas and Values offering.
The movement for revamping
the Area One requirement began
in 1986, when History Prof. Car
olyn Lougee told the Faculty Sen
ate that the course should be
expanded to include study of the

'I'm delighted about
the amount of atten
tion this issue is get
ting right now. The
commission is going
at its task in exactly
the right way.'

contributions of women and non-
Western cultures. In the fall of
1986, the senate approved a pro
posal for an "alternative" Western
Culture course taught by History
Prof. Clay Carson that would
examine the history of women and
minorities within Western cul
ture.
In October of 1987, a report by
the Area One Task Force pro
posed an expanded course that
threw out the existing "canon" of
books that all tracks previously
studied. What followed was six
months of debate in the senate
that brought national media
attention and charges from critics
that Stanford was abandoning
Western culture and subverting
academic standards.
After substantial revisions and
compromise, the senate on March
31, 1988, approved the new Cul
tures, Ideas and Values course by
a vote of 39-4. The course changed
the Western Culture reading list

to include issues of "race, class
and gender."
Despite the public attention
paid to the CIV debate, Kennedy
maintains that the reform was
"not the most significant thing
that happened around here.
"A lot of attention got paid to it
because people outside of Stanford
saw fit to misrepresent what hap-

pened here, trans
forming a rela
tively modest
issue to some
thing academic
conservatives
could rally
around," he said.
"At the end of
the day, the cur
riculum is not the

most important thing in under
graduate education quality," he
added. Instead, Kennedy pointed
to his 1991 teaching initiative, a
program still in effect which offers
numerous rewards for excellence
in teaching and "changes the crite
ria of promotions" to account for
teaching, as a more telling and
important project.
The initiative dedicated $7 mil
lion to improving undergraduate
teaching and increasing "the reso
nance between teaching and
research." Money from the initia
tive was used to help faculty mem
bers develop new courses and to
reward outstanding teachers,
among other things.
Casper and the commission
The final years of the
Kennedy presidency, however,
were dominated by the indirect
cost controversy and Stanford's
quarrels with the federal govern
ment, pushing further under
graduate education reform to the
back burner. So there was a
sense of inevitability to Gerhard
Casper's insistence that the Uni
versity return its sights to aca
demics.
The result of this commitment
has been the Commission on
Undergraduate Education, a 19-
member commission that is cur
rently examining all aspects of
undergraduate life at Stanford. In
one year, the commission is sup
posed to release the next blueprint
for changing the way undergradu
ates learn.
Kennedy believes that Casper's
creation of the panel is timely, and
to an extent, expected.
"I think things have to come on
schedule, in their own time," he
said. "I'm delighted about the
amount of attention this issue is
getting right now. The commis
sion is superbly composed, and it
is going at its task in exactly the
right way."
Casper, too, seems aware of the
current study's proper place in
Stanford history. When he
announced the commission's cre
ation in April, the president recog
nized the historical precedent of
reforming undergraduate educa
tion and expressed his hope that
this study will both return Stan
ford to its foundations and carry it
into the future:

"Its charge will be to consider
the undergraduate curriculum in
light of the changing needs of our
students, the emerging opportuni
ties and challenges of the 21st
Century, and the increasing need
to focus more intently on the basic
objectives of this institution."
