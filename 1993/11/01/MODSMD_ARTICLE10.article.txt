# Rightists demand Aristide's replacement

### 
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -
Buoyed by the failure of a U.N. plan to
return President Jean-Bertrand Aris
tide to power on schedule, about 200
chanting rightists marched yesterday to
demand his replacement.
Other rightists considered a "consti
tutional coup" that would bar Aristide
from office and replace him with a
Supreme Court justice, although a lead
ing official in the former Duvalier dicta
torship emerged yesterday to demand
power within the Aristide-backed tran
sition government.
"Arrest Malval! Arrest Malval! Aris
tide's in deep trouble!" the demonstra
tors chanted, referring to Aristide's pre
mier, Robert Malval. They stood outside
the vacant National Palace, chanting to
the tune of "Farmer in the Dell."
"We're tired, we're finished with
everything, we're going to form our own

government!" shouted former Sen. Rey
nald Georges, a Duvalier supporter.
Francois "Papa Doc" Duvalier and his
successor son, Jean-Claude, ruled Haiti
for nearly 29 years. The regime was top
pled after popular protests chased Jean-
Claude "Baby Doc" from the country in
1986.
Georges said his supporters didn't
have to storm the palace. "We cannot
storm something that belongs to us," he
told journalists in the Caribbean sun.
Asked about the two-thirds support
reported for Aristide in the 1990 popu
lar election, Georges replied: "Eh-hah
hah-hah! I am laughing."
Across the Avenue of Liberty, four
military officers in civilian clothes
watched the demonstration.
On the street, a prominent business
man looked on sadly. "I don't see how we
are getting out of this thing," said Gerald

Alien, referring to the political and eco
nomic impasse. Three months ago, he
closed his weekly Journal du Commerce,
founded in 1954, because of the collapse
of legitimate businesses in the face of a
thriving contraband market.
"There is nothing left to defend,"
Allen said.
"They (the rightists) say they are the
people, but they are not the people. The
people are in hiding," the Rev. Rene
Giroux, a priest in an Aristide
stronghold in the capital, later told The
Associated Press.
Aristide supporters have been
repressed since the military overthrew
the elected president in September
1991. Premier Malval was appointed by
Aristide in August as part of a U.N. plan
envisioning Aristide's return by Oct. 30,
but the military has retained control of
government ministries.
