## Editorial A risky voucher deal
### 
Proposition 174, Califor
nia's school voucher initia
tive, has been hailed by sup
porters as the cure-all for the
state's educational woes. It would
offer each school-age child a $2,600
voucher to use at a private school.
Backers say the plan would save
money — $2,600 is half what it
costs to educate a student in public
school — and improve the quality
of schools though competition.
Although the plan looks like a
simple solution and a way the avoid
the bureaucratic morass usually
associated with school reform, vot
ers have every right to be skeptical.
Projections of the measure's
financial impact have ranged from
millions in savings to $1.3 billion
in added yearly costs for the state.

With this uncertainty, a cash
strapped state can't afford to take
such a gamble.
More importantly, it is unclear
whether the measure will actually
improve education. State regula
tions on private school curricula
and teachers are lax, and the mea
sure would allow vouchers to be
redeemed at schools that discrimi
nate on the basis of gender,
income, and mental and physical
disabilities. It is also questionable
how far $2,600 would go toward
helping poorer students afford
tuition at most private schools.
Perhaps the best reason to
oppose this measure is a lack of
evidence concerning how it really
works. Vouchers haven't been
tried on a large scale anywhere
else. Does California really want
to let its 5 million students be
guinea pigs for an experiment
with potentially disastrous conse
quences?
