# Tax plan: safety first
## 
### 
VOTERS TOMORROW will
decide the fate of Proposi
tion 172, a half-cent sales
tax which would ensure funding
for public safety.
This tax is not new. The state tax
rate is scheduled to drop by half a
percent on Jan. 1, but Prop 172
would force the rate to hold steady
at 6 percent. The funds accrued
would increase the state's safety
enforcement, a result which war
rants passage of the proposition.
If this measure passes, it will
raise about $1.5 billion in annual
revenue to provide funding for
police and fire departments, bene
fit the war on gangs and drugs, and
effect the implementation of crime
education programs.
However, should 172 fail to

pass, Santa Clara County will be
forced to cut about $70 million
from its budget. According to the
Santa Clara County Sheriff, the
cuts would force the layoffs of
deputies, a longer response time to
911 calls to the police and fire
departments and the early release
of prisoners from jail due a
decrease in the jails' staffs.
Opponents to Proposition 172
say the legislature should cut
other areas of the budget to pro
vide the necessary funding for
public safety. However, the state's
budget is already stretched to a
paper-thin level, and it would be
difficult to get blood out of a
stone.
The recent fires in Southern
California have shown the enor
mous importance of firefighters in
maintaining public safety. And
with the ever-increasing levels of
violence in the state, police forces
also must not suffer from funding
difficulties.
