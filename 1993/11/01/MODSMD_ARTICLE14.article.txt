## Traveling through time? 
### 
HAVE YOU ever dreamed about
going through time? (Read the
next paragraph very quickly.)
Now you too can fly through time,
with the greatest of ease! Imagine, see
the first female president of the UASS
(Union of American Socialist States); wit
ness the discovery of the cure for bald
ness (Ooooohhhh); hear, after all the
planets have been colonized, the monu
mental first words from the first landing
on the sun ("It's hot, Kit"). Now, with
this amazing deal, I'm offering to you the
opportunity to impress your friends,
shock your enemies, overwhelm that cute
teaching assistant, embarrass your
mother, with the Timerator!
How much would you expect to pay
for such a wonderful product: $100, $50,
$19.95? Now, the Timerator is yours for
only $19.94! And for the first 15 million
orders I'll throw in this one-of-a-kind
Klein bottle made from the highest
grade plastic, excellent as a conversation
piece ("Excuse me, is that a Klein bottle
you're holding?" "Why, yes, it is a Klein
bottle.") and as an all-purpose paper
weight / door stop / key chain / lethal
blunt object! Call before it's too late! Act
now! (Send all money to the author of
this column. Allow four to six millennia
for delivery.)
Is this too good to be true? Can we
really go through time? Can I retake that
midterm? If this idea has been pestering
you, the answer is here. Is time travel

possible? Yes and no.
(Most people saw that coming. If you
were surprised by that statement, feel
free to hang your head in shame or live in
ignominy for the duration of eternity.)
What do I mean, yes and no? Well, let
me explain. Yes, you can travel through
time, but, no, you can't if you're preg
nant, have history of back, neck or head
injuries, in-grown toenails, trouble read
ing Hebrew or are under 48 inches tall.
Actually, you can't because Nature won't
allow it.
But you've never obeyed Nature
before. You've been completely plas
tered one night and not been hung over
the next morning (and considered it an
accomplishment). What's so hard about
a little time travel? The problem is that
Nature abhors a paradox; she not only
hates them but oppresses them and
denies them the right to exist. If you, or
anything from a quark to Hoover Tower,
went back in time, the matter would
have to be sent to that time. I'll even
give you the means to get it back there;
let's say, oh, a DeLorean with a blender.
Hey, I'll even overlook that you're
breaking the Law of Conservation of
Mass and Energy. Laws were made for
wimps anyway.
But every particle affects every
other one around it, which in turn
affects everything around that. Just
like in chaos theory, the sudden exis
tence of a particle that wasn't sup

posed to be there would change histo
ry, maybe not drastically enough to
make Rush Limbaugh president, but it
would change history. Change it
enough to change the state of the world
at your time of departure, meaning you
left from a different state you left from
before, and so on. More paradoxes than
y'all can shake a stick at.
What? Time travel's impossible?!?
Don't go (insert any of my mass-suicide
descriptions here) yet; all is not lost.
While you can't go back in time, you can
jump to the future, and that's because of
the nature of time. Time is not a clock
that counts but is only an human inven
tion to help measure things. To go for
ward in time, do what you do in class any
way, sleep. Suddenly, it's 50 minutes
after you fell asleep. If you are complete
ly unconscious for 50 years, no time pass
es to you but when you wake up, it's 50
years later. The only reason we can say
that time passed is that everything
around you kept going. Time is relative to
you.
Think about it. Take your time. And
send me money anyway.

Thai actually did lose his watch last
week. Brown leather band, rectangular
face with "St. Marin " on it.
