## Theme houses provide education, diversity, freedom 
### 
JEREMI SURI'S TORMENT
between the "realities of New
York and the isolation of Stan
ford" in his Oct. 26 column is a symp
tom of a malady affecting many at
Stanford. One has only to open their
eyes to see that we have a whole
diverse community of working people
that serves you breakfast, lunch and
dinner, washes your dishes, picks up
after you, gets rid of your trash, recy
cles your paper and basically makes
sure you have all the support, freedom
and time so Suri can pursue his intel
lectual delights such as passing judg
ment on ethnic theme houses based on
a typical East Coast fallacy that he
lived in the most diverse venue in the
nation — New York City.
To so many of us who live and work
on this farm, being "farm workers" is
far from any vision that Stanford is
this "paradise" that Suri seems "torn"
about living in. Looking deeper at this
university than just from a fraternity
house, generic dorm or Daily desk, one
sees a large and complex organization

that is anything but "paradise" for the
hundreds of workers needed to keep it
functioning.
This year, it's open season on ethnic
theme houses and Suri is just one more
hunter with us in his gun-sight. Dur
ing the past eight years, while serving
as resident fellows of Casa Zapata, we
have seen these seasons come and go.
The damage these "pop" shots inflict
on the integrity and culture of these
residences and their residents is real.
And as usual we run, like a fire depart
ment, from one blaze to the next, not
only to defend but also educate.
Nine times out 10, those that
attack ethnic theme houses have
never lived in one or visited one for a
program or social function. Often,
these critics fail to see a similarity
with housed fraternities that are a
self-selected grouping of individuals
who, like ethnic and other theme
houses, add to the diversity and free
dom of housing choices on this cam
pus. Since Suri is concerned with
freedom, would he deny this freedom

of selecting to live in an ethnic theme
house to any Stanford student? Con
centrations of segregation?
With 50 percent of our residents
being non-Chicano, American Indian,
African-American or Asian-American,
we believe our houses are the most
diverse communities on campus. For
certain they do serve small numbers
in these ethnic populations, but much
more than that, they also serve the
dominant European-American cul
ture. We are educational institutions.
As minorities, (though we do not feel
like a minority on this continent or in
this world), we know more about the
dominant Anglo, European-American
culture than they know about ours.
Our mission is two-fold, and educat
ing the non-"minority" is also a pri
ority.
Despite the pains of such biased
views, the past eight years have been
worth seeing student friendships cross
social, economic, cultural, racial and
religious lines. Ironically, it has been
at Zapata where we have seen "stu-

dents learn to live and work together
as one community." We don't know
where Suri's concerns about "psycho
logical anguish or maladjustment
within the context of society's reali
ties" have come from.
As resident fellows, it has been
poignantly inspiring to see students
who, until coming to Stanford, had
never known a Mexican-American,
much less lived with 50 of them, to
see them delve into a different cul
ture and language, view their majors
as a way of serving a greater commu
nity, teach in East Palo Alto and Red
wood City or travel to Mexico —
something they would have never
experienced at any other residence on
campus.
The University may easily do away
with "ethnic theme houses," but there
will always be a Casa Zapata. With
more than 20 murals, what else could
it be?
