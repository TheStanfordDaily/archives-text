# Language instruction should be mandatory for Stanford students
## 
### 
I was both pleased and surprised to
learn that the Commission on Under
graduate Education considers the acqui
sition of a foreign language one of three
foundational objectives of a Stanford
education. I am pleased because as a
doctoral student in Italian intending to
spend the rest of my life working in a
foreign language and its literature, I
have a clear stake in the future of lan
guage studies; and as resident fellow at
La Casa Italians, I am encouraged that

the current status of foreign language
studies at Stanford — an issue central to
the identity of the language focus houses
— is being carefully scrutinized.
My surprise in learning of the com
mission's valorization of language stud
ies comes from having observed, in the
last three years at Stanford, a steadily
accelerating marginalization of the for
eign language departments. Symptoms
of this malaise in my own department
vary in degree: the only individual in
any of the foreign languages at Stanford
trained specifically in the most up-to
date pedagogy of language acquisition
was let go two years ago due to bud
getary constraints; two native-speaker
lecturers were retired last year in favor
of more dependence on inexperienced
(mostly) non-native speaker graduate

students; administrative responsibilities
have been reshuffled several times —
creating confusion for administrators,
teaching staff and students.
The commission is right to frame
the debate about the place of foreign
languages at Stanford in terms of prac
tical import and intellectual substance;
but it would be incorrect, in my judg
ment, to suggest that the future of the
foreign language departments should
be determined by emphasizing one over
the other. In a global community there
is a very tangible need for its best-edu
cated citizens to speak each other's
languages, but to do so effectively
there is much more involved in the
process than merely learning grammar
and vocabulary. The acquisition of
another cultural perspective should be

an integral dimension of foreign lan
guage learning and is, I would argue
emphatically, one of the primary obli
gations of a properly humanistic uni
versity education.
Commission members will undoubt
edly find a great deal to criticize in look
ing at the results of language instruc
tion at Stanford, but they need look no
further than the absence of a uniform
and rigorous language requirement for
graduation to understand that if fluency
in a foreign language is one of the Uni
versity's ambitions for its graduates,
clearer institutional support — both
moral and material — for those of us
involved in foreign language studies is
imperative.
