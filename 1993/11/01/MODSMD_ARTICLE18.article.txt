# Finally — Stanford downs Oregon St., 31-27
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
On the brink of All Hallow's
Eve, all it took was a few orange
and-black clad opponents from
Corvallis to lift the spirits of the

Stanford football team and allow
them to take home a long-awaited
treat.
Behind the passing of quarter
back Steve Stenstrom, Stanford
recorded its first Pacific 10 Confer
ence win of the season, besting

Oregon State 31-27 on Saturday at
Stanford Stadium.
"A win was something that this
team was yearning for, and we got
it," said Stenstrom. "I think it will do
wonders for our confidence. It was a
big momentum booster for us."

But the ghosts of lost-leads past
nearly spooked the Cardinal once
again. Stanford (3-5, 1-4 in the
Pac-10) enjoyed a 31-21 lead after
Stenstrom, on his third touchdown
pass of the afternoon, connected
with receiver Mark Harris with
6:38 left in the game.
Oregon State (3-6, 1-4), though,
countered with a 69-yard touch
down drive of its own, but failed on
a two-point conversion attempt.
Then, the Beavers successfully exe
cuted an onsides kick to retain pos
session at the Cardinal 49-yard
line.
"It feels like we couldn't get the
win without scaring ourselves a lit
tle bit beforehand," said Harris.
Stanford avoided disappoint
ment when safety Eliel Swinton
intercepted Beaver quarterback
Rahim Muhammad's third-down
pass attempt to halfback Cameron
Reynolds with 1:18 remaining.
"When he (Reynolds) was driv
ing, he tried to explode on me," said
Swinton. "I turned around and it
was like a birthday present out of
the sky from God."
Never mind that it was not
Swinton's birthday. The Cardinal
was willing to accept any gifts
offered.
"We're really pleased to finally
win a game," said Stanford head
coach Bill Walsh. "It got a little
precarious there at the end, but the
overall effort of the team was
great."
Stenstrom's play was especially
impressive. The quarterback com
pleted 29 of 41 passes without an
interception for a career-best 402
yards. His performance marked
only the sixth time in Stanford his
tory that a Cardinal quarterback
has thrown for over 400 yards.
The Cardinal receivers did their
part to help. While injured starters
Justin Armour and Brian Manning
watched from the sidelines, Harris
(6 catches for 98 yards) and fresh
man Andre Kirwan (9 catches for
153 yards) repeatedly exploited the
Oregon State secondary.

"They were blitzing every down
so it was tough to run," Walsh said.
"But they were just giving you one
on-one coverage all over the field
throwing the ball so you're almost
obligated to throw. We had a field
day passing."
The Cardinal offensive line,
meanwhile, shut down the
Beavers' pass rush, allowing only
one quarterback sack.
"The offensive line did a heck of
a job," Stenstrom said. "They (Ore
gon State) gave us a lot of looks we
had never even seen before."
Offensively, the Beavers' look
— the option — was all too famil
iar to the Cardinal. Stanford has
had difficulty with the option all
season, but Saturday proved differ
ent.
Rather than using the option
three or four times for big plays,
Oregon State's style is to use that
formation constantly. The Stan
ford defense, therefore, knew what
to expect. Oregon State, ranked
second in the nation in rushing
offense, gained 338 yards on the
ground. But the Cardinal backers
played up near the line, daring
Muhammad (122 yards rushing,
but only two of six passing for 64
yards) to throw. Left end Tyrone
Parker (12 tackles) stopped the ini
tial advances, and right outside
linebacker Mark Hatzenbuhler
(19) and right cornerback Vaughn
Bryant (17) plugged up the middle.
"We swarmed to the ball well,
and we played hard — that's all
you can ask for," Parker said.
The Cardinal started the game
quickly. On the fourth play from
scrimmage, right end David Carder
forced Beaver running back John
Young to fumble, and left outside
linebacker Jason White recovered.
Five plays later, Stanford was on
the board with a 44-yard field goal
by Eric Abrams.

lead. The Cardinal extended its mar
gin at the beginning of the third
quarter with a 74-yard scoring drive
that ended on a 33-yard touchdown
pass play from Stenstrom to Kirwan
— the first touchdown reception of
Kirwan's collegiate career.
However, Oregon State battled
back, scoring three touchdowns in
the third quarter to cut the deficit to
24-21.
Later, the Cardinal had possession
to start the fourth quarter, and drove
to the Oregon State 32-yard line.
Abrams, however, missed a 49-yard
field goal attempt. The Beavers then
went downfield to the Stanford 15-

yard line. Following a time-out, with
fourth-and-one on the 15, the Beavers
incurred a 5-yard penalty. Instead of a
potential touchdown drive, Oregon
State had to settle for a 37-yard field
goal attempt, which kicker Brooke
Knight missed. Stanford then went
on to score its final touchdown.
"We called time-out," said Oregon
State head coach Jerry Pettibone.
"(But) the official cranked the clock
for play while we were still talking to
the quarterback on the sideline."
With the victory, Stanford kept its
hopes for a postseason bowl game
alive. The Cardinal must also win its
remaining three contests to qualify.
"We talked about finishing the sea
son strong and this was the week to
start it," Stenstrom said. "We just
wanted to look at it as a four-game sea
son. Getting this first win was critical."

recorded its first Pacific 10 Confer
ence win of the season, besting

Oregon State 31-27 on Saturday at
Stanford Stadium.
"A win was something that this
team was yearning for, and we got
it," said Stenstrom. "I think it will do
wonders for our confidence. It was a
big momentum booster for us."

But the ghosts of lost-leads past
nearly spooked the Cardinal once
again. Stanford (3-5, 1-4 in the
Pac-10) enjoyed a 31-21 lead after
Stenstrom, on his third touchdown
pass of the afternoon, connected
with receiver Mark Harris with
6:38 left in the game.
Oregon State (3-6, 1-4), though,
countered with a 69-yard touch
down drive of its own, but failed on
a two-point conversion attempt.
Then, the Beavers successfully exe
cuted an onsides kick to retain pos
session at the Cardinal 49-yard
line.
"It feels like we couldn't get the
win without scaring ourselves a lit
tle bit beforehand," said Harris.
Stanford avoided disappoint
ment when safety Eliel Swinton
intercepted Beaver quarterback
Rahim Muhammad's third-down
pass attempt to halfback Cameron
Reynolds with 1:18 remaining.
"When he (Reynolds) was driv
ing, he tried to explode on me," said
Swinton. "I turned around and it
was like a birthday present out of
the sky from God."
Never mind that it was not
Swinton's birthday. The Cardinal
was willing to accept any gifts
offered.
"We're really pleased to finally
win a game," said Stanford head
coach Bill Walsh. "It got a little
precarious there at the end, but the
overall effort of the team was
great."
Stenstrom's play was especially
impressive. The quarterback com
pleted 29 of 41 passes without an
interception for a career-best 402
yards. His performance marked
only the sixth time in Stanford his
tory that a Cardinal quarterback
has thrown for over 400 yards.
The Cardinal receivers did their
part to help. While injured starters
Justin Armour and Brian Manning
watched from the sidelines, Harris
(6 catches for 98 yards) and fresh
man Andre Kirwan (9 catches for
153 yards) repeatedly exploited the
Oregon State secondary.

"They were blitzing every down
so it was tough to run," Walsh said.
"But they were just giving you one
on-one coverage all over the field
throwing the ball so you're almost
obligated to throw. We had a field
day passing."
The Cardinal offensive line,
meanwhile, shut down the
Beavers' pass rush, allowing only
one quarterback sack.
"The offensive line did a heck of
a job," Stenstrom said. "They (Ore
gon State) gave us a lot of looks we
had never even seen before."
Offensively, the Beavers' look
— the option — was all too famil
iar to the Cardinal. Stanford has
had difficulty with the option all
season, but Saturday proved differ
ent.
Rather than using the option
three or four times for big plays,
Oregon State's style is to use that
formation constantly. The Stan
ford defense, therefore, knew what
to expect. Oregon State, ranked
second in the nation in rushing
offense, gained 338 yards on the
ground. But the Cardinal backers
played up near the line, daring
Muhammad (122 yards rushing,
but only two of six passing for 64
yards) to throw. Left end Tyrone
Parker (12 tackles) stopped the ini
tial advances, and right outside
linebacker Mark Hatzenbuhler
(19) and right cornerback Vaughn
Bryant (17) plugged up the middle.
"We swarmed to the ball well,
and we played hard — that's all
you can ask for," Parker said.
The Cardinal started the game
quickly. On the fourth play from
scrimmage, right end David Carder
forced Beaver running back John
Young to fumble, and left outside
linebacker Jason White recovered.
Five plays later, Stanford was on
the board with a 44-yard field goal
by Eric Abrams.

lead. The Cardinal extended its mar
gin at the beginning of the third
quarter with a 74-yard scoring drive
that ended on a 33-yard touchdown
pass play from Stenstrom to Kirwan
— the first touchdown reception of
Kirwan's collegiate career.
However, Oregon State battled
back, scoring three touchdowns in
the third quarter to cut the deficit to
24-21.
Later, the Cardinal had possession
to start the fourth quarter, and drove
to the Oregon State 32-yard line.
Abrams, however, missed a 49-yard
field goal attempt. The Beavers then
went downfield to the Stanford 15-

yard line. Following a time-out, with
fourth-and-one on the 15, the Beavers
incurred a 5-yard penalty. Instead of a
potential touchdown drive, Oregon
State had to settle for a 37-yard field
goal attempt, which kicker Brooke
Knight missed. Stanford then went
on to score its final touchdown.
"We called time-out," said Oregon
State head coach Jerry Pettibone.
"(But) the official cranked the clock
for play while we were still talking to
the quarterback on the sideline."
With the victory, Stanford kept its
hopes for a postseason bowl game
alive. The Cardinal must also win its
remaining three contests to qualify.
"We talked about finishing the sea
son strong and this was the week to
start it," Stenstrom said. "We just
wanted to look at it as a four-game sea
son. Getting this first win was critical."
On the brink of All Hallow's
Eve, all it took was a few orange
and-black clad opponents from
Corvallis to lift the spirits of the

Stanford football team and allow
them to take home a long-awaited
treat.
