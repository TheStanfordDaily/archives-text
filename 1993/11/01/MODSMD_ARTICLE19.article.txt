# Football as a passing fancy
## Stenstrom tops Elway and Plunkett on all-time list 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
The Stanford offense is turning
out to be a passing fancy.
Saturday's game against Oregon
State marked the seventh consecu
tive game the Cardinal amassed at
least 300 passing yards.
"It's not the big prize were look
ing for. We're looking for wins,"
said head coach Bill Walsh. "But I
think (quarterback) Steve (Sten
strom) is a 300-yard passer. Now,
what that means, I'm not sure."
For one thing, it meant doing
something that no other Stanford
quarterback has ever done before;
not even the likes of Jim Plunkett
or John Elway ever had a seven
game streak like Stenstrom's — or
even six, for that matter.
In addition, Stenstrom's first
time over the four-centuiy mark is
the fifth-highest single-game total
in Stanford history.
"I think, overall, it was the best
60 minutes of football I've put
together as a quarterback," said

Stenstrom. "There were still some
mistakes, but as far as my consis
tency, my accuracy and making the
right decisions, I feel better about
this game than any game up to this
point."
Stenstrom finished the day 29 of
41 for 402 yards, three touchdowns
and no interceptions.
"That was really positive,"
Walsh said, referring to the absence
of interceptions. "He completed a
vast majority of his passes for good
yardage down the field ... I think
Steve has done a great job."
Stenstrom's targets had similar
ly good days. For the second consec
utive week, junior split end Mark
Harris had a big game, grabbing six
catches for 98 yards and two touch
downs.
However, among the receivers,
the day unquestionably belonged to
flanker Andre Kirwan. In his first
start ever, and first game with any
significant playing time, Kirwan
caught nine passes for 153 yards
and a touchdown, the first of his
career.

"It was a post and I was just try
ing to get him to bite on it, and as
soon as he bit, I just tried to fly
out," said Kirwan, a redshirt fresh
man. "Steve put it right on the
money. I really didn't have to do
much, just catch it."
And the catching was catching.
Tight end Tony Cline had five
receptions for 54 yards, and David
Shaw had four catches for 69.
"Our receivers caught the ball
well," Walsh said. "There were very
few dropped passes, if any. We sort
of wore our receivers out."
"At the beginning of the third
quarter, I forget when, I felt my
hamstring give out on me," said
Kirwan, who already had seven
catches for 108 yards at that point.
"It didn't pull or anything, it just
started cramping up. Then my calf
went, and then my other hamstring
went. I just started cramping up."
However, where Kirwan may
have let up on his ridiculous pace,
others stepped in to finish the job —
as has been the case all year for the
receivers.
"We miss our other receivers
(injured Justin Armour and Brian
Manning), but these guys have
stepped forward and really done a
great job," Walsh said. "Mark has
done very, very well, as had David
Shaw, and Andre Kirwan of course
had a great day. We continue to
throw and catch the ball well as
anybody in the country."
One big positive that Walsh and
the coaching staff must have taken
from the game was the offensive
line's pass-protection. Against a
tenacious and oft-blitzing Oregon

State defense, the offensive line
gave up only one sack.
"I give them tons of credit," said
Stenstrom, referring to the front
five. "They kept the guys away
from me, and I was able to have the
time 1 needed). When (Oregon
State] calls blitzes like that, there's
gonna be open receivers. If your
line can give you time to fmd them,
you can have a big day, and that's
what happened."
With the recent emergence of the
offensive line and receivers Man
ning, Harris and Kirwan, the coach
es and players themselves must be
wondering who will step up next
week.
"They're doing a great job," Sten
strom said. "Guys are stepping in
when they need to do the job, and
getting it done. That's critical for us."

tive game the Cardinal amassed at
least 300 passing yards.
"It's not the big prize were look
ing for. We're looking for wins,"
said head coach Bill Walsh. "But I
think (quarterback) Steve (Sten
strom) is a 300-yard passer. Now,
what that means, I'm not sure."
For one thing, it meant doing
something that no other Stanford
quarterback has ever done before;
not even the likes of Jim Plunkett
or John Elway ever had a seven
game streak like Stenstrom's — or
even six, for that matter.
In addition, Stenstrom's first
time over the four-centuiy mark is
the fifth-highest single-game total
in Stanford history.
"I think, overall, it was the best
60 minutes of football I've put
together as a quarterback," said

Stenstrom. "There were still some
mistakes, but as far as my consis
tency, my accuracy and making the
right decisions, I feel better about
this game than any game up to this
point."
Stenstrom finished the day 29 of
41 for 402 yards, three touchdowns
and no interceptions.
"That was really positive,"
Walsh said, referring to the absence
of interceptions. "He completed a
vast majority of his passes for good
yardage down the field ... I think
Steve has done a great job."
Stenstrom's targets had similar
ly good days. For the second consec
utive week, junior split end Mark
Harris had a big game, grabbing six
catches for 98 yards and two touch
downs.
However, among the receivers,
the day unquestionably belonged to
flanker Andre Kirwan. In his first
start ever, and first game with any
significant playing time, Kirwan
caught nine passes for 153 yards
and a touchdown, the first of his
career.

"It was a post and I was just try
ing to get him to bite on it, and as
soon as he bit, I just tried to fly
out," said Kirwan, a redshirt fresh
man. "Steve put it right on the
money. I really didn't have to do
much, just catch it."
And the catching was catching.
Tight end Tony Cline had five
receptions for 54 yards, and David
Shaw had four catches for 69.
"Our receivers caught the ball
well," Walsh said. "There were very
few dropped passes, if any. We sort
of wore our receivers out."
"At the beginning of the third
quarter, I forget when, I felt my
hamstring give out on me," said
Kirwan, who already had seven
catches for 108 yards at that point.
"It didn't pull or anything, it just
started cramping up. Then my calf
went, and then my other hamstring
went. I just started cramping up."
However, where Kirwan may
have let up on his ridiculous pace,
others stepped in to finish the job —
as has been the case all year for the
receivers.
"We miss our other receivers
(injured Justin Armour and Brian
Manning), but these guys have
stepped forward and really done a
great job," Walsh said. "Mark has
done very, very well, as had David
Shaw, and Andre Kirwan of course
had a great day. We continue to
throw and catch the ball well as
anybody in the country."
One big positive that Walsh and
the coaching staff must have taken
from the game was the offensive
line's pass-protection. Against a
tenacious and oft-blitzing Oregon

State defense, the offensive line
gave up only one sack.
"I give them tons of credit," said
Stenstrom, referring to the front
five. "They kept the guys away
from me, and I was able to have the
time 1 needed). When (Oregon
State] calls blitzes like that, there's
gonna be open receivers. If your
line can give you time to fmd them,
you can have a big day, and that's
what happened."
With the recent emergence of the
offensive line and receivers Man
ning, Harris and Kirwan, the coach
es and players themselves must be
wondering who will step up next
week.
"They're doing a great job," Sten
strom said. "Guys are stepping in
when they need to do the job, and
getting it done. That's critical for us."
