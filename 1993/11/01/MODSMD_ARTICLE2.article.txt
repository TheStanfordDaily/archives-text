# Professor to direct European university
## Weiler picked to lead new school 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
The European university Vi
adrina has elected Hans Weiler,
professor of education and politi
cal science and director of Stan
ford's Center for European Stud
ies, as its first president.
Located in Frankfurt/Oder, on
the Polish border in what used be
East Germany, the university's
mission is to establish an educa
tional connection between East
ern and Western Europe.
"There's something in the lo
cale that makes it appropriate to
address borders," Weiler said last
night in an interview from Ger
many.
But in addition to the borders
between east and west, Weiler
said he was particularly drawn to
the university because it placed
an emphasis on "[crossing] the
borders between disciplines."
One of the major reasons for ac
cepting his position was that the
school had "a very strong inter
disciplinary program."
He added, "Once it was clear to
me that both the university and
the government here [fully
backed the curriculum in Ger
many], I found (the job) irre
sistible."
Viadrina is a public university
in its second year of operation,
but Weiler is the school's first
president. An acting president
headed the school in its the first
year.
Political Science Prof. Phillipe
Schmitter, a member of the inter
national organization which nomi
nated Weiler, remarked that Weil
er's involvement with the universi

ty from its infancy, as well as his
own innovative research in educa
tional reform, made him a natural
choice.
Weiler, who has served on Viad
rina's planning committee since
1991, was the only nominee pro
posed by the Founding Senate of
the European University, an inter
national body of educators. Weiler
was officially inaugurated for the
four-year term Oct. 15.

He attributed his successful
nomination to his outsider status.
"When you come in from the out
side, you bring in a different per
spective."
Weiler, who has been a U.S. cit
izen since 1983, said that he is
"well acquainted" with the diffi
culties the job will entail — from
the poor economic condition of
eastern Germany to the rise of
nationalism.

Schmitter lauded Weiler's
research on curriculum.
"Hans defined essentially a new
academic discipline, a large
omnibus department called 'Cul
tural Sciences' at Hans' sugges
tion."
Weiler has always wanted to be
a university administrator, accord
ing to Martin Carnoy, an educa
tion professor who has taught with
Weiler for 25 years. Carnoy called

the job "a great opportunity" for
Weiler, although his colleague
never envisioned getting the job
when he began working on Viadri
na's planning commission.
Viadrina currently holds classes
for about 1,000 students in church
halls and movie theaters. Two
abandoned Soviet military bar
racks serve as libraries.
"It'll be another five or six years
until the university will be out of

the woods as far as facilities go,"
Weiler admitted.
The university, which will even
tually enroll 4,200 students, is cur
rently comprised of two-thirds
German students and one-third
Polish students.
Weiler will take early retire
ment from Stanford next year, but
said he may return to the Universi
ty in 1997 as a professor emeritus
of education and political science.
