## Volleyball back on track after sweeping at home

Luckily, redemption came quickly for the Stanford
women's volleyball team.
After dropping two matches in Arizona the previous
weekend, Stanford (16-5, 9-4 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence) demonstrated the dominating play which charac
terized its early season matches, sweeping both the
University of Washington (2-9, 7-14 in the Pac-10) and
Washington State (15-6, 6-6 in the Pac-10) over the
weekend in Maples Pavilion.
"I'm ecstatic about how we played these past two
matches," said senior tri-captain Heidi Eick. "We
bounced back from two hard losses last weekend and
played really crisp and consistent."
Performing vastly better than during the previous
weekend, the Cardinal handled the Huskies 15-6, 15-4,
15-5 on Friday. After hitting a season low of .083
against Arizona State only a week earlier, Stanford
staged a complete reversal, swinging for a season-high
of .427.
"We really took care of business and didn't play
down to another teams' level," Eick said. "Even though
Washington had a lot of iryuries, it didn't matter, we
still didn't let them get points they didn't deserve."
Stanford coach Dion Shaw attributed part of the Car
dinal's success this weekend to a key lineup change
which added strength to the team's floundering outside
attack. Shaw moved sophomore Maureen McLaren
from her post in the middle, to the outside hitter posi
tion, while freshman Nikki Otto took over the middle
blocking duties.
"We've just been getting too many errors out there
and Mo (McLaren) is going to keep the ball in," said
Shaw. "It gives us more depth at the outside hitter posi

tion and Mo's a tough cookie out there, I like to have
those kind of players."
The new offensive combination provided the much
needed spark against the Huskies, which served to bol
ster the Cardinal attack. Sophomore Marnie Triefen
bach smashed down the match-high 14 kills for a .591
hitting percentage while adding eight digs and two aces.
McLaren swung for an impressive .750 with nine kills
while Otto hit .714, posting a career high ten kills.
"Our hitting distributions were more balanced,"
Eick said. "We used the middle a lot more than we have
been able to use it and that opens up options. Instead of
having just one or two people hit all the balls, we spread
it out a lot more."
The improved Stanford offense maintained its
power against a much tougher challenge Saturday
night as the Cardinal downed WSU 15-13,15-14, 15-4.
While both teams fought for their shares of side-outs
in the first game, Stanford managed to hang on for a
tight victory. The Cougars kept pace with the Cardinal
until junior Anne Wicks' serve pulled Stanford out to
an 11-6 lead. The Cougars came back to tie at 13-13, but
the effort was not enough to stop Stanford from finally
pulling out the win.
Powered by a strong digging defense, the Cougars
pulled ahead to take a 6-12 lead in game two. They were
unable to maintain the margin, however, as the Cardi
nal evened the score at 13-13 and squeeked in another
three points for the victory. The Cardinal quickly fin
ished its job, taking the third game in a relatively easy
contest.
While Stanford's starters certainly played the piv
otal role in defeating the Cougars, Shaw also cited
bench strength as an important factor. Eick, outside
