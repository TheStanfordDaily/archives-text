## Women snare Pac-10 title

They were so excited they
broke the trophy.
The ninth-ranked Stanford

women's cross country team won
the Pacific 10 Championship
Meet at the Stanford Golf Course
this Saturday. In doing so, the
Cardinal ended No. 6 Oregon's
era of dominance, during which

the Ducks captured six of seven
conference titles. And although
All-American Gary Stolz's third
place performance contributed to
a somewhat disappointing fifth
place finish by the llth-ranked
Stanford men, in all, Cardinal
cross country had much to be
proud of this weekend.
By emphasizing that cross
country is not an individual sport,
the Stanford women literally ran
away with the race. Even though
third-place UCLA shot out in
front with eventual champion
Karen Heacox and senior Beth
Bartholomew, and despite the
fact that fourth-place Oregon also
placed two of its runners in the
top seven, the Cardinal featured
the strongest team effort in the
field.
Stanford's top five runners all
crossed the finish line within 12
seconds of one another. Junior
Stephanie Jensen, senior Louise
Watson, senior captain Sarah
Truitt, and freshmen Leila Burr
and Ann Sheehy came in eighth,
ninth, 11th, 13th and 14th
respectively, giving the Cardinal a
championship tally of 55 points.
Second-place Arizona also ran
well as a team, but the Wildcats
fell well short of Stanford with a
65-point total.
