## Women snare Pac-10 title 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
They were so excited they
broke the trophy.
The ninth-ranked Stanford

women's cross country team won
the Pacific 10 Championship
Meet at the Stanford Golf Course
this Saturday. In doing so, the
Cardinal ended No. 6 Oregon's
era of dominance, during which

the Ducks captured six of seven
conference titles. And although
All-American Gary Stolz's third
place performance contributed to
a somewhat disappointing fifth
place finish by the llth-ranked
Stanford men, in all, Cardinal
cross country had much to be
proud of this weekend.
By emphasizing that cross
country is not an individual sport,
the Stanford women literally ran
away with the race. Even though
third-place UCLA shot out in
front with eventual champion
Karen Heacox and senior Beth
Bartholomew, and despite the
fact that fourth-place Oregon also
placed two of its runners in the
top seven, the Cardinal featured
the strongest team effort in the
field.
Stanford's top five runners all
crossed the finish line within 12
seconds of one another. Junior
Stephanie Jensen, senior Louise
Watson, senior captain Sarah
Truitt, and freshmen Leila Burr
and Ann Sheehy came in eighth,
ninth, 11th, 13th and 14th
respectively, giving the Cardinal a
championship tally of 55 points.
Second-place Arizona also ran
well as a team, but the Wildcats
fell well short of Stanford with a
65-point total.

liant," said coach Vin Lananna.
"There's not much more to say. We
won the meet at the one-mile mark.
It was all over."
"I had always thought of cross
country as an individual sport
before I came to Stanford," said
defending District-8 champion Wat
son, who transferred from Kent,
England, her junior year. "But it
was team spirit that made the dif
ference today. We could have gone
to our sixth runner and still have
won. We have great depth anc great
confidence.We know we're good,
and we support each other during
the race. That gives incentive and
inspiration to set individual goals
aside and run well as a team."
Truitt repeated Watson's senti
ments, adding a personal anecdote
to prove her point.
"Near the end of the race,
Stephanie and I got together and
blasted by this Oregon woman," she
said. "My personal goal was to fin
ish in the top 10, but all I could
think of at that time was, 'Beat Ore
gon. Beat Oregon.' I couldn't focus
on anything else, not even the
pain."
For Truitt, the Pac-10 crown
bears particular significance
since she and Debbie Wells are
the only two seniors on the Car
dinal squad who have stayed with
the cross-country program for
four years. She spent two years
under former head coach Brooks
Johnson, who resigned two years
ago. In those days, Stanford was
not even a contender for the con
ference title.
"This championship is all I can
ask for and more," Truitt said. "I've
always had friendship in cross coun
try, but this is more. I finally feel
like we've com ~i close to the high
expectations Brooks set for us."
On the men's side, it was also
team running that prevailed. How
ever, it was No. 14 Washington, not
Stanford, which ran as a tigHt unit.
The Huskies' 67-point tally proved
three better than runner-up Wash
ington State, which was led by
senior Josephat Kapkory's champi

onship performance.
The Cardinal also had runners
out in the lead pack, with senior
captain Stolz s eflort and freshman
Greg Jimmerson's seventh-place
finish. However, Stanford's next
runner, freshman J.J. White, came
in 25th, and sophomore Rob Reeder
and freshman Andy Cowgill fol
lowed in 29th and 32nd respective
ly. That gave the Cardinal a 95-
point total, which dropped it behind
the third-place Ducks' 84 points
and the fourth-place Bruins' 90
points.
"We planned to go out slow, and
then move up," Stolz said. "At the
two-mile mark, we were doing fine,
and the front three were moving
up. But the fourth and filth run
ners didn't move forward soon
enough."
"We're a young team, so you just
can't go out crazy," Lananna said.
"We wanted to go out slow and
catch up. But at the four-mile mark
in the course, you hit this uphill
stretch. We simply ran out of race."
Nonetheless, Lananna expressed
pride in the men, noting that ever>-
one gained ground on their com
petitors during the meet. There is
little concern over the ability of the
men to regroup and reassert them
selves in the District-8 meet Nov. 13.
In fact, the only matter troubling
the men is Stolz's achilles ten
donitis. Stolz has suffered from this
condition for the past three years.
He aggravated it during the final
stretches of the race.
"It's a long-term problem. I've
dealt with my achilles before. I can
hold it through Districts and
nationals." Stolz said. "As far as the
team goes, we know we're a solid
team. We can pull it all together.
We're the same team as we were at
the Michigan Invite, where we
placed second among a lot of nation
ally-ranked teams. Saturday just
wasn't our day."
Lananna also looks forward to
the District meet.
"We can make a big comeback at
Districts," he said. "That's what
we've geared our season towards
anyway."
"This is just icing on the cake,"
Truitt said with regard to the
women's Pac-10 title. "It's not even
the end of the season."

and Ann Sheehy came in eighth,
ninth, 11th, 13th and 14th
respectively, giving the Cardinal a
championship tally of 55 points.
Second-place Arizona also ran
well as a team, but the Wildcats
fell well short of Stanford with a
65-point total.

liant," said coach Vin Lananna.
"There's not much more to say. We
won the meet at the one-mile mark.
It was all over."
"I had always thought of cross
country as an individual sport
before I came to Stanford," said
defending District-8 champion Wat
son, who transferred from Kent,
England, her junior year. "But it
was team spirit that made the dif
ference today. We could have gone
to our sixth runner and still have
won. We have great depth anc great
confidence.We know we're good,
and we support each other during
the race. That gives incentive and
inspiration to set individual goals
aside and run well as a team."
Truitt repeated Watson's senti
ments, adding a personal anecdote
to prove her point.
"Near the end of the race,
Stephanie and I got together and
blasted by this Oregon woman," she
said. "My personal goal was to fin
ish in the top 10, but all I could
think of at that time was, 'Beat Ore
gon. Beat Oregon.' I couldn't focus
on anything else, not even the
pain."
For Truitt, the Pac-10 crown
bears particular significance
since she and Debbie Wells are
the only two seniors on the Car
dinal squad who have stayed with
the cross-country program for
four years. She spent two years
under former head coach Brooks
Johnson, who resigned two years
ago. In those days, Stanford was
not even a contender for the con
ference title.
"This championship is all I can
ask for and more," Truitt said. "I've
always had friendship in cross coun
try, but this is more. I finally feel
like we've com ~i close to the high
expectations Brooks set for us."
On the men's side, it was also
team running that prevailed. How
ever, it was No. 14 Washington, not
Stanford, which ran as a tigHt unit.
The Huskies' 67-point tally proved
three better than runner-up Wash
ington State, which was led by
senior Josephat Kapkory's champi

onship performance.
The Cardinal also had runners
out in the lead pack, with senior
captain Stolz s eflort and freshman
Greg Jimmerson's seventh-place
finish. However, Stanford's next
runner, freshman J.J. White, came
in 25th, and sophomore Rob Reeder
and freshman Andy Cowgill fol
lowed in 29th and 32nd respective
ly. That gave the Cardinal a 95-
point total, which dropped it behind
the third-place Ducks' 84 points
and the fourth-place Bruins' 90
points.
"We planned to go out slow, and
then move up," Stolz said. "At the
two-mile mark, we were doing fine,
and the front three were moving
up. But the fourth and filth run
ners didn't move forward soon
enough."
"We're a young team, so you just
can't go out crazy," Lananna said.
"We wanted to go out slow and
catch up. But at the four-mile mark
in the course, you hit this uphill
stretch. We simply ran out of race."
Nonetheless, Lananna expressed
pride in the men, noting that ever>-
one gained ground on their com
petitors during the meet. There is
little concern over the ability of the
men to regroup and reassert them
selves in the District-8 meet Nov. 13.
In fact, the only matter troubling
the men is Stolz's achilles ten
donitis. Stolz has suffered from this
condition for the past three years.
He aggravated it during the final
stretches of the race.
"It's a long-term problem. I've
dealt with my achilles before. I can
hold it through Districts and
nationals." Stolz said. "As far as the
team goes, we know we're a solid
team. We can pull it all together.
We're the same team as we were at
the Michigan Invite, where we
placed second among a lot of nation
ally-ranked teams. Saturday just
wasn't our day."
Lananna also looks forward to
the District meet.
"We can make a big comeback at
Districts," he said. "That's what
we've geared our season towards
anyway."
"This is just icing on the cake,"
Truitt said with regard to the
women's Pac-10 title. "It's not even
the end of the season."
They were so excited they
broke the trophy.
The ninth-ranked Stanford

women's cross country team won
the Pacific 10 Championship
Meet at the Stanford Golf Course
this Saturday. In doing so, the
Cardinal ended No. 6 Oregon's
era of dominance, during which

the Ducks captured six of seven
conference titles. And although
All-American Gary Stolz's third
place performance contributed to
a somewhat disappointing fifth
place finish by the llth-ranked
Stanford men, in all, Cardinal
cross country had much to be
proud of this weekend.
By emphasizing that cross
country is not an individual sport,
the Stanford women literally ran
away with the race. Even though
third-place UCLA shot out in
front with eventual champion
Karen Heacox and senior Beth
Bartholomew, and despite the
fact that fourth-place Oregon also
placed two of its runners in the
top seven, the Cardinal featured
the strongest team effort in the
field.
Stanford's top five runners all
crossed the finish line within 12
seconds of one another. Junior
Stephanie Jensen, senior Louise
Watson, senior captain Sarah
Truitt, and freshmen Leila Burr
and Ann Sheehy came in eighth,
ninth, 11th, 13th and 14th
respectively, giving the Cardinal a
championship tally of 55 points.
