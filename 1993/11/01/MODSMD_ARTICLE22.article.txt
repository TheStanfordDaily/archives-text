# No.1 water polo slips by Trojans
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
The Stanford water polo team snapped out of
their mid-season slump in grand fashion. In the
biggest and most immediate challenge to their No. 1
national ranking, the Cardinal (18-3, 3-1 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) passed the test,
downing No. 2 USC (12-6) by an 11-10 margin in
deGuerre on Friday.
After fending off the Trojans, Stanford finished
the Friday double-header by cruising past Loyola-
Marymount with a score of 23-6, then returned to
the water Saturday to take care of UC-Davis, 19-6.
Friday's featured match between the nation's top
two teams lived up to its "clash of the titans" billing,
as the outcome was not decided until only 16 seconds
remained in the game.
The end-of-match suspense was due to a Trojan
comeback from which turned an 8-4 deficit into a 10-
9 lead with less than three minutes left in the game.
However, Stanford opened the match with a dom
inating first quarter, building a 4-2 lead behind two
goals from sophomore Jeremy Laster, who finished
the game with five tallies. The Cardinal continued to
put offensive pressure on USC goaltender Andrew
Tinseth throughout the first half, beating the

defense four more times in the second quarter.
"Our goal is to come out strong," said Laster. "It's
good to know that if we need to come out strong we
can. When you're up 8-4 in the first half, you're
cruising. We need to learn to keep intensity up for
the whole game."
After the Cardinal attack, the Trojans regrouped
and came storming back, closing to within one goal at
the end of three quarters of play. USC tallied the first
two goals of the final quarter to tie, and then took the
lead from Stanford, 10-9.
"We had a little trouble in the middle (of the
game) on defense," said senior goaltender Larry
Bercutt. "We came back together and didn't let it slip
through our fingers. It's easy to lay down, but we
kept fighting and came back."
The Cardinal comeback was sparked by coach
Dante Dettamanti's insertion of junior Billy Maguy
into Stanford's lineup with two and a half minutes
left in the contest.
Nine seconds later, Maguy found the back of the
net, tying the game at 10 apiece. On the next Trojan
offensive series, Maguy dropped back into the middle
to make a steal. The Stanford rally was capped by a
man-advantage situation in which Maguy found
senior Chris Wallin open on the
inside post for the winning goal
with 16 seconds left on the
clock. The goal was Wallin's
third of the game.
"When I came in, we were
down by one," Maguy said. "On
our first series I wanted to get a
drive off. The defender didn't
realize I was driving and I got
by him and sealed him behind
_ »»
me.
On the winning play, Maguy
said, "We had a left-hander
(Wallin) on the inside post. We
were looking for the post, and
the middle guard was keyed on
Wolf (Wigo). I saw Chris was
open."
Dettamanti praised the per
formance of Maguy in the criti
cal final minutes of play.
"When we went down, I took
Wolf out and put Billy in," he
said. "Billy responded and got us
the tying goal. There is a desire
on his part, an intensity. You
know he's going to do something
good."
The win solidifies Stanford's
hold on the top spot in the rank
ings with four weeks remaining
until the NCAA Championships.
