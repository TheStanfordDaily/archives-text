# Soccer ends on winning note

They did what they had to do.
But they didn't get the help they
needed.
Last Friday, the Stanford
men's soccer team defeated
archrival California 2-1 in an
exciting comeback victory. Howev
er, the Cardinal's postseason fate
did not reside solely in their own
hands. As a result, despite the
Cardinal's home-field victory they
will be spectators of, not partici
pants in, postseason action.

Yet this disappointment does
not reduce Stanford's satisfaction
with its narrow victory over the
Golden Bears. Defense was king in
the first half, as both teams failed
to score. Then, halfway into the
second period forward Alan Saran
gave the Golden Bears a 1 -0 edge
on a pass from fullback James
Hoese. Ten minutes later, the
Cardinal got its revenge when
senior forward Rick Goad put his
first one into the net. Midfielder
Chet Zimmer assisted on that
play.
Then, with two minutes remain

ing in the game, Joel Russell set up
Goad with a perfect pass to ruin
Cal's chances of making the confer
ence playoffs. Goad, who scored
Stanford's first goal as well, leads
the team with 12 tallies on the year.
The win over the Golden Bears
gave the Cardinal one last chance
of making the playoffs.
"It was a big win for us," said
Goad. "A lot of people didn't think
we could beat Cal because we
haven't been having a great season."
Head coach Colin Lindores
agreed. "Beating Cal was great,"
he said. "They had everything to
lose. By beating them we probably
knocked them out of contention
for the playoffs. At first, we looked
like we weren't going to come
back. This season we've demon
strated we're not n good team com
ing from behind. Today we showed
a little bit more maturity."
However, Stanford's future
was irrevocably tied to the play of
Washington and Fresno State. On
Friday, Oregon State pulled out a
tie with Washington, giving the
Cardinal half of the aid it needed
to reach the postseason. But on
Sunday, Fresno State battled San
Jose State to a two-all standoff,
preserving their bid for postsea
son play and eliminating Stan
ford.
But because the playoff shot
was a long one, its evaporation did
not leave the Cardinal embittered.
In fact, Lindores is optimistic
regarding next season's prospects.
"I'm very happy with how
we've progressed," he continued.
"The older players have stepped
up and the younger ones have
learned a little bit more about the
game. Even if we don't make the
playoffs I think we've demonstrat
ed we've got a good nucleus for
next year."
On Sunday, in its final home
game, the team downed Butler 2-
0. Senior Niels Bruckner scored
both goals within a two-minute
period in the first half. The first
was on a pass from junior Ryan
Collins, while Goad was credited
with an assist on the second.
Goalie Jim Masetti recorded his
fourth shutout of the season.
The team finishes 4-2-1 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion. Overall, their record stands
at 7-8-2. They still have a chance
to reach the .500 mark if they can
knock off St. Mary's in their final
game of the season tomorrow.
