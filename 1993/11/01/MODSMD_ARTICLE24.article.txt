# One win away from the No.1 seed
## Booters demolish Tigers, 4-1 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
The Stanford women's soc
cer team took another step clos
er to a number-one seed in the
Western Regionals this week
end hy defeating Colorado Col
lege 4-1 Saturday at Maloney
Field.
Forcing a lightning-fast
tempo and attacking the Tigers'
goal immediately after kickoff,
the second-ranked Cardinal
(15-2-1) struck twice in the first
10 minutes and held off a shift
in momentum at the end of the
first half, before putting away
Colorado College (9-6-0) with
two more second-half goals.
Erin Martin opened the scor
ing seven minutes into the
game with her 14th goal of the
year. The score came when
Carmel Murphy gathered in an
errant shot by Anna Patitucci
and set up Martin on the left
side of the Tiger goal.
Hoping to feast on inexperi
enced goalkeeping, Stanford put
another shot past freshman
keeper Audrey Maxfield less
than two minutes later. Emily
Burt popped up a pass in front
of the goal, which Patitucci put

in with a strong header past a
diving Maxfield.
After taking the two-goal
lead, head coach lan Sawyers'
changes in the lineup took some
of the steam out of the Cardinal
attack. "I take responsibility for
that," Sawyers said. "We
changed our scheme a little bit,
and I think it disjointed our
players a little bit."
Combining excellent play in
goal with a revitalized Tiger
attack, Colorado College got on
the board 30 minutes into the
first half when Tiger top-scorer
Tara Nott put a shot past an
advancing Leslie Garrard. It
was only the seventh goal Gar
rard has allowed all year, and
the first in the past four games.
The Tigers continued to play
aggressively over the next 15
minutes, with one goal called
back because of an offsides vio
lation and another ricocheting
off the post.
"We set the tone for the
game in the first 20 minutes,
but then we relaxed," said
Sarah Rafanelli. "We let them
back into the game."
The Cardinal struck again
seven minutes into the second
half on a spectacular free kick by

Jessica Fischer. Facing a wall of
defenders in front of the Tiger
goal, Fischer lofted the shot
around the wall and found the
upper right corner of the goal
for her eighth score of the year.
"It was a tremendous
strike," Sawyers said. "I wasn't
sure what was going to happen,
because we had set up some
thing different. They surprised
me, but I'll take those surprises
any day. Jess is our specialist at
our free kicks, and she got that
one beautifully."
Late in the game, it looked as
if senior forward Rafanelli
would be held scoreless in her
final regular-season home game.
However, with 90 seconds left in
the game, Rafanelli and Martin
got free on a break-away. Martin
dumped the ball off to Rafanelli
on the right wing and the Ail-
American put the shot through
with a crossing shot into the left
corner of the goal for her 16th
goal of the year.
"We're playing with a lot of
confidence right now," Rafanel
li said. "By playing better
teams, I think we're forcing
ourselves to play better. We've
had a real resurgence of energy
at the end of this season."
