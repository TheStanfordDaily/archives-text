What a feeling.
The Cardinal men's golf team
turned in the best golfing perfor
mance in school history and blew
away a 20-team field at the Stanford
Shootout, held at the Stanford Golf
Course over the weekend.
Stanford's three-round com
bined score of 848 and a second
round score of 276 were both all
time Cardinal bests. The Cardinal
beat their nearest competitors by an
unprecedented 20 strokes.
"Obviously, I'm incredibly proud
of the team," said coach Wally
Goodwin. "They hung in there and
this is the best we've ever felt."
The Cardinal's individual stand

ings were just as impressive as the
team's performance. In a field of
over 100 golfers, four Stanford play
ers finished in the top nine. Junior
Notah Begay 111 fell just two strokes
shy of winning the individual title
with a three-round score of 209.
An incredible six-under-par score
of 66 shot by Pepperdine's Kevin
Marsh overtook Begay in the final
round. Marsh birdied five of the last
six holes of the tournament to steal
the title.
Stanford juniors Steve Burdick
and Casey Martin tied for fourth
with scores of 213. Junior William
Yanagisawa finished ninth, firing a
three-round total of 215.
The third-annual Shootout
quickly became a battle for second
place. After Stanford's record-set

ting second-round score of 276, the
Cardinal led the field by seven
strokes. The linksters continued
their red-hot performance on Sun
day, firing a 284 to win going away.
Stanford regained the title it lost
to Virginia last year, as the Cava
liers finished in sixth place, 33
strokes behind the Cardinal.
Stanford now looks ahead to the
Golf World/Palmetto Dunes Colle
giate Open to be held Nov. 12-14 in
Hilton Head, S.C. The Cardinal,
ranked fifth in the nation at the
start of the season, will compete
with the top schools in the country.
"If they keep their minds on
the game, I feel they will play
great," said Goodwin. "I just hope
they don't get carried away with
this win."
