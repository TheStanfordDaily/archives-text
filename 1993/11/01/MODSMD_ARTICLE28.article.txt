# Gay community disappointed over Court's approval of military policy
## 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
Members of the gay community, both on and off
campus, expressed disappointment this weekend
with the Supreme Court's decision on Friday to
uphold the "don't ask, don't tell" Pentagon policy on
gays in the military.
"I can't find any gay person who knows anything
about the military that would say this is an improve
ment," said reinstated gay Naval Petty Officer Keith
Meinhold, who is stationed at Moffett Field in
Mountain View.
In its ruling, the Supreme Court said that Mein
hold's reinstatement to the military, in effect since
last November, did not apply to the rest of the gay
community in the military, "which makes me a vir
tual pariah," Meinhold said.
Meinhold, who was discharged in August 1992
after disclosing his sexual orientation on national
television, was reinstated last year after U.S. Dis
trict Judge Terry Hatter ruled that the ban was
unconstitutional.
But when Hatter last month issued a broad rul
ing that discrimination against all gay personnel
strictly on the basis of their sexual orientation was
unconstitutional, the future of the "don't ask, don't
tell" policy became doubtful, and the Clinton admin
istration asked the Supreme Court to intervene.
The new ruling means that "there are 115 people
whose lives and careers are ruined," Meinhold said,
referring to other gays in the military who are
brought up in the suit by the Justice Department.
"There's no doubt to me that the president has sold
out the people he made a promise to."
While the new "don't ask, don't tell" policy
seemed to imply indifference to sexual orientation,
Meinhold says it leaves President Clinton's vow to
"end the witch hunts" unfulfilled.
"It's still easy to have witch hunts, and they still
do," Meinhold said. " 'Don't ask unless there's rea

sonable suspicion' . . . It's the same problem as
before — it's all left to the commanding officer's dis
cretion on whether or not to investigate."
Under the new policy, recruits are not asked
about their sexual orientation, but commanding
officers have the power to investigate charges of
homosexuality and impose penalties. Meinhold said
that aside from pure hearsay, everything is up for
consideration by the officer.
"It's bogus," said Albert Liu, a staff member at
the Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Community Center.
"It's not changing anything from the way it was
before," Liu said of the new policy. "It's forcing peo
ple back into the closet."
Meinhold did add, though, that while there are
officers intent on conducting "witch hunts," most
are not terribly interested in them.
Meinhold said that in addition to the "don't ask"
clause, the new policy has one other minor change
from the old — the elimination of the "queer for a
day" clause, which said that the mere act of homo
sexual sex was not enough to discharge an officer if
he or she were "proven to be straight."
"It meant that if you 'fell off the wagon' for a day,
you won't be penalized," Meinhold said.
But the new policy says that any homosexual act
as well as personal homosexual identification could
be investigated.
Meinhold predicted that the courts haven't seen
the last of this issue. "There's definitely more on the
way," he said. "I was really depressed about the
Supreme Court ruling. The debate will not end until
the discrimination stops."
Indeed, Meinhold's prediction probably won't
have to wait long to be tested.
Navy Lieutenant Zoe Dunning, a Stanford Busi
ness School graduate, said she "will most likely be
discharged soon" for her open homosexuality. As
Dunning's case has elicited much publicity already,
it is likely that if Dunning is discharged, it will spark
further controversy.
