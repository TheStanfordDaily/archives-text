# Webbs, union headed for arbitration
## 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
After several months of ongoing debate, the Unit
ed Stanford Workers union and Webb Ranch man
agement have agreed to let an independent arbitra
tor settle a dispute over who may live in housing
trailers at the ranch.
According to Sam Brooks, lead field representa
tive for the USW, the union and the Webbs are cur
rently "at a standstill" in determining who may re
side in eight housing trailers donated to the ranch by
the University earlier this year.
"The dispute will go to arbitration some time
early next year. We're just waiting for an arbitra
tor," Brooks said.
The new housing was intended for Stanford
workers, to replace several older trailers deemed
"unfit for human occupancy" by San Mateo County
health officials earlier this year. But the USW claims
that some of the trailers have been given to non
workers instead, a possible violation of the contract
between the union and the Webb family.
The new trailers, originally from Manzanita
Park, were purchased by the Webbs more than two
years ago, after the University offered them to who
ever was willing to pay the moving costs.
The current problem is yet another in a long line
of housing disputes between the USW and the
Webbs, who have leased the 237-acre ranch from
Stanford since 1922.
The issue of living conditions
on the ranch first arose last Jan
uary, when the USW discovered
that eight families on the ranch
had been living without heat since
the previous November. Soon
after, the county ordered the evac
uation of four families from the

trailers. Under the threat of a pos
sible review of their lease if they
failed to comply, the Webbs were
ordered to have new housing
ready by the end of March.
Although the Webb family
had intended to have the trailers
ready for occupation by the
county deadline, the housing was
not finished until late summer,
causing yet another rift between
the ranch operators and the
USW.
Although the ranch is run on

University-owned land, Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper has
said several times that Stanford
should distance itself from the
problems between the union and
the Webbs.
"There is no role that Stanford
can play in those negotiations,"
Casper told protesters at an ASSU
Senate meeting last Wednesday.
Richard Kurovsky, the director
of University relations, said Stan
ford has "no comment on this
action."
