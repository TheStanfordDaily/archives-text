# Homeless man disguises as law prof, fools students
## 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
Alan Theall's costume was great. He had
everybody fooled. But police cut the festivi
ties short a week before Halloween.
The role which Theall acted with such
zeal, and which many Stanford students be
lieved with equal enthusiasm, was that of a
law professor. Since this summer, he has
been making friends and influencing people

under that guise at the Law School, the Cof
fee House and the Graduate School of Busi
ness. He mingled at parties, talked the talk,
ate the food and completely duped some of
the country's brightest students.
"He really fooled me pretty badly," said
one undergraduate student who requested
that his name not be used. "I was just sold."
In response to calls from several people
"stating he was weird," police confronted
Theall last week and warned him to stay off

the campus, said Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer. However, because Theall,
who turned out to be a homeless person,
gained no obvious benefit from the imper
sonation, police could not arrest him be
cause no crime was actually committed.
"He has been admonished not to come
back," Niemeyer said. "He has no business
here."
The undergraduate student said that
Theall first began to actively befriend him

in the Coffee House.
"He was a nice guy to talk to," the stu
dent said. "He reads a lot. We would talk
about politics primarily."
Besides being an excellent conversation
alist, Theall also made a lot of extravagant
claims about his education and career. He
claimed to have a law degree from Harvard,
a bachelor's from Grambling State Univer-
sity and a Ph.D. from UCLA. He
also claimed to be an entertain
ment lawyer and was in the habit of
"dropping a lot of names."
"At first you don't believe he's a
lawyer," the student said. "He has
to sell you into the idea. He's a con
man."
According to the undergraduate,
the sale was aided by a graduate
student, apparently an accomplice,
who would verify Theall's stories.
The graduate student could not be
reached for comment.
Theall started taking the under
graduate student to Law School
functions, where he would introduce
himself as "Professor Theall." Law
students seemed to believe his act.
The undergraduate said that

Theall understood the law school
"mentality," and skillfully played
on students' ambitions, including
his own.
"He knew I wanted to go to law
school," the student said. "I
thought I could get a recommenda
tion from him."
Theall, who is black, also played
well on the "multicultural ele
ment," the student said.
"People are afraid to criticize
black people," the student said.
"He's not well dressed at all. He'd
say, 'I can't dress well because white
boys would be jealous of me.' "
The only benefit Theall
appeared to have gained was free
meals at social gatherings. In fact,
that was one of the first things that
provoked the suspicions of his
undergraduate friend.
"He started talking about 'free
food' this and 'free food' that," the
student said.

Several inconsistencies also
began to cast doubt on Theall's
claims as well. His stories became
"less and less believable," as anoth
er law student put it. And then the
Law School's picture book was pub
lished — minus Theall's brave face.
Students began to complain to
Sally Dickson, the associate dean of
student affairs at the Law School.
"There were concerns expressed by
a number of people about the
things he said and the way he
befriended people," she said. "The
stories didn't seem right."
These complaints, in addition to
those filed with the police, eventu
ally led to the warning Theall was
given. He has not been seen on
campus since.
But of course, the damage has
already been done.
"He's a slimeball," Theall's former
undergraduate companion said. "I
just won't trust anybody anymore."

er law student put it. And then the
Law School's picture book was pub
lished — minus Theall's brave face.
Students began to complain to
Sally Dickson, the associate dean of
student affairs at the Law School.
"There were concerns expressed by
a number of people about the
things he said and the way he
befriended people," she said. "The
stories didn't seem right."
These complaints, in addition to
those filed with the police, eventu
ally led to the warning Theall was
given. He has not been seen on
campus since.
But of course, the damage has
already been done.
"He's a slimeball," Theall's former
undergraduate companion said. "I
just won't trust anybody anymore."
