## Campbell heads candidates for 11th District Senate seat 
### Jim Ho 
The 11th District Senate race
wasn't supposed to be like this.
When former state Sen. Rebec
ca Morgan (R-Menlo Park) an
nounced her departure from
Sacramento this summer for a po
sition in the private sector, ru
mors buzzed around the capitol
that the race to fill her seat would
be a showdown between the two
current assemblymen whose con
stituencies comprise her district.
Instead, when voters select
their new representative tomor
row, they will be choosing between
Stanford law professor and former
U.S. Rep. Tom Campbell and
seven other candidates who have
considerably less name recogni
tion and clout in the Peninsula.
That hasn't stopped three De
mocratic candidates from putting
up a tough fight against Campbell,
a moderate Republican, who is
widely considered the front-run

ner in the Senate race.
Hal Plotkin, who is officially
endorsed by the California Demo
cratic Party and a whole host of
Peninsula Democrats, has accused
Campbell of using the senate seat
as a springboard to return to
Washington.
"Republicans view this as a step
back for him," said fellow Democ
ratic candidate Phil Stokes, who
added that he feels Campbell re
gards the state Senate as merely
an opportunity to "remain in the
public arena."
Campbell has denied that he

has his sights set on Washington,
stating that, if elected, he would
likely run for re-election in 1996.
"I have always been an advocate
for this state ... 1 think I could do a
lot more for California in Sacramen
to than in Washington,"he said.
Campbell may have an easier
time tomorrow because the two
assemblymen who were expected to
compete for the seat are not run
ning. Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto) and
Charles Quackenbush (R-Saratoga)
would have had a unique opportu
nity to campaign for the more pres
tigious chamber without endanger
ing their Assembly seats, which are
not up until 1994.
Quackenbush, a conservative,
was the first to announce his inten
tion to run for the seat. When
Campbell announced his own can
didacy, Gov. Pete Wilson stepped in
and asked one of them to withdraw
from the race, according to The

Sacramento Bee. Quackenbush
stepped back shortly after.
Early on, Sher was expected to
challenge the Republicans for the
post, but later expressed his desire
to remain in the Assembly, where
he has served for the past 13 years
and chairs the Natural Resources
Committee.
So Plotkin and Campbell have
emerged as the official major-party
candidates. Although they represent
two different camps, the two seem
to agree on most of the mgyor issues.
Both candidates are opposed to
Proposition 174, the school vouch
ers initiative that will also appear
on tomorrow's ballot.
Plotkin is strongly opposed to
any voucher system. Campbell
switched sides on the measure
months ago.
"There are some forms of vouch
er I could support," said Campbell
in a recent debate at Stanford. "But
I cannot endorse a new entitlement,
which is what this is." He apolo
gized for the change in position,
admitting that "I did not fully
understand [174] ... 1 did not read

the second half."
The six other candidates are split
on the initiative. Jack Hickey, a
Republican who is a write-in candi
date for the American Independent
Party, says that the whole reason for
his campaign is to pass 174.
Jon Petersen, the Libertarian
candidate, has come out strongly in
support of the voucher measure,
saying that "California would be
broke without [it]."
Independent, "party-free"
Nancy Jewell Cross, however, that
the measure would be "educational
ly disastrous."
Plotkin and Campbell agree on a
host of other state issues. Both can
didates favor stronger gun control
measures, oppose Gov. Wilson's
recent immigration proposals and
support abortion rights.
Although it is widely believed
that Campbell will capture the
Senate seat tomorrow, strong
opposition from Plotkin and others
could force a Dec. 28 run-off in
which the top vote-getters from
each party would appear on the
new ballot.

not up until 1994.
Quackenbush, a conservative,
was the first to announce his inten
tion to run for the seat. When
Campbell announced his own can
didacy, Gov. Pete Wilson stepped in
and asked one of them to withdraw
from the race, according to The

Sacramento Bee. Quackenbush
stepped back shortly after.
Early on, Sher was expected to
challenge the Republicans for the
post, but later expressed his desire
to remain in the Assembly, where
he has served for the past 13 years
and chairs the Natural Resources
Committee.
So Plotkin and Campbell have
emerged as the official major-party
candidates. Although they represent
two different camps, the two seem
to agree on most of the mgyor issues.
Both candidates are opposed to
Proposition 174, the school vouch
ers initiative that will also appear
on tomorrow's ballot.
Plotkin is strongly opposed to
any voucher system. Campbell
switched sides on the measure
months ago.
"There are some forms of vouch
er I could support," said Campbell
in a recent debate at Stanford. "But
I cannot endorse a new entitlement,
which is what this is." He apolo
gized for the change in position,
admitting that "I did not fully
understand [174] ... 1 did not read

the second half."
The six other candidates are split
on the initiative. Jack Hickey, a
Republican who is a write-in candi
date for the American Independent
Party, says that the whole reason for
his campaign is to pass 174.
Jon Petersen, the Libertarian
candidate, has come out strongly in
support of the voucher measure,
saying that "California would be
broke without [it]."
Independent, "party-free"
Nancy Jewell Cross, however, that
the measure would be "educational
ly disastrous."
Plotkin and Campbell agree on a
host of other state issues. Both can
didates favor stronger gun control
measures, oppose Gov. Wilson's
recent immigration proposals and
support abortion rights.
Although it is widely believed
that Campbell will capture the
Senate seat tomorrow, strong
opposition from Plotkin and others
could force a Dec. 28 run-off in
which the top vote-getters from
each party would appear on the
new ballot.
