Update on Iran-Contra
WASHINGTON (AP) - The special
prosecutor's final report on the Iran-
Contra scandal concludes that Presi
dent Reagan was not out of the loop,
nor an innocent victim of overzealous
aides, according to a national news
magazine.
Reagan personally directed nation
al security aides Robert McFarlane
and John Poindexter at critical peri
ods during the secret and illegal ship
ments of U.S. missiles to Tehran in
1985 and 1986, U.S. News & World
Report quotes unnamed sources as
saying in the magazine's upcoming
issue.
The report on special prosecutor

Lawrence Walsh's seven-year investiga
tion is scheduled to be released Dec. 3.
River Phoenix dead at 23
LOS ANGELES (AP) - River
Phoenix, whose natural intensity as a
teen-age actor in the 1986 film "Stand
by Me" launched his career, collapsed
outside a nightclub early yesterday and
died. He was 23.
Friends reported that Phoenix was
"acting strange" as he left the Viper
Room in West Hollywood about 1 a.m.,
said sheriffs Deputy Diane Hecht.
Paramedics were called when the
actor collapsed, and Phoenix was rushed
to Cedars Sinai Medical Center. He was
pronounced dead shortly before 2 a.m.
