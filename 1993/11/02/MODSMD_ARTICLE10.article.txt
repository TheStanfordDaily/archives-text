Israelis protest peace talks
BEIT EL, Occupied West Bank (AP)
— Jewish settlers, in an uprising against
a government they say is sacrificing them
for peace with Palestinians, blocked
roads with burning tires and torched an
Arab classroom yesterday.
It was the fourth day of rampage,
which erupted when Muslim militants
killed a settler on Friday. The settlers
also took over some vacant government
homes, proclaiming themselves squat
ters.
"Every crazy settler and every crazy
Muslim fundamentalist can spoil every
thing in a minute," said Israeli journalist
Danny Rubinstein, a veteran observer of
the occupied lands.
Though a majority of Israelis and
Palestinians support the talks, which
resumed in Egypt yesterday, extremist
violence appeared more likely with every
report on progress in the negotiations on
partial Palestinian self-rule.
In Beit El, a settlement of 3,000 about
10 miles north of Jerusalem, residents
said they felt the government was no
longer protecting them.
Every day since the death of Beit El

resident Haim Mizrachi, 30, settlers have
blocked roads with burning tires and
stoned Arab-owned cars and houses. Yes
terday, about 50 men from Beit El
smashed school windows and torched an
empty classroom in the nearby Palestini
an refugee camp of Jalazoun. The chil
dren were not in school at the time.
Haitian turmoil continues
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -
Haiti's military, having blocked the return
of President Jean-Bert rand Aristide, has
not responded to a U.N. request for new
talks on reinstating the ousted leader, U.S.
and U.N. officials said yesterday.
The United Nations, trying to keep a
moribund peace process alive, hopes to con
vene the talks by tomorrow.
Haitian rightists have demanded that
new political negotiations begin without the
mqjor players in the last round of talks:
U.N. mediator Dante Caputo, Aristide and
the army commander, Lt. Gen. Raoul
Cedras.
But the United States, which stationed a
new warship carrying 650 Marines off Haiti
on Sunday, said the rightists had no right to
demand that the three men resign.
