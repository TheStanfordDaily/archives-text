# First lady backs health plan
## Denounces insurance company advertisements 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Hillary Rodham
Clinton accused insurance companies yester
day of waging a deceitful campaign against
the Clinton health plan to protect profits and
preserve the ability to cut people ofT when
they get sick.
"It is time for you and for every American
to stand up and say to the insurance industry,
'Enough is enough. We want our health care
system back,' " she told more than 2,000 pedi
atricians.
But the industry said it was the first lady
who was guilty of deception and promised to
press its $6.5 million advertising campaign
that raises questions about President Clin
ton's health plan.
Mrs. Clinton's voice was fraught with emo
tion as she spoke of the "struggle" for health
reform and praised the American Academy of
Pediatrics for fighting for children.

The first lady castigated the "Harry
and Louise" television ads run by the
Health Insurance Association of America
that question key features of the Clinton
plan.
"One of the great lies that is currently
afoot in this country is that the president's
plan will limit choice. To the contrary, the
president's plan enhances choice," said Mrs.
Clinton.
She referred sarcastically to the "homey
kitchen ads" that end with a woman sighing,
"There must be a better way."
But Charles N. Kahn 111, the health insur
ers' executive vice president, called Mrs. Clin
ton's attack on the ads "a total misrepresen
tation of the facts."
"It's just another example of the adminis
tration trying to paint us as the black hat to
somehow help their cause," Kahn said.
