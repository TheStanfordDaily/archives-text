# Senator faces misconduct charges
## Refuses to turn over 'very personal' diaries 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A nervous
Senate debated sex, privacy and allega
tions of possible criminal conduct yester
day in a historic effort to enforce a sub
poena for Sen. Bob Packwood's "very,
very personal" diaries.
"The Ethics Committee cannot turn a
blind eye" to potential violations of crim
inal law and standards of conduct, Sen.
Richard H. Bryan, the panel's chairman,
said in asserting a need for the diaries.
Members of the panel rose one by one
to support the subpoena in generally
quiet statements. But the argument
between Bryan and Packwood, R-Ore.
turned heated over Bryan's assertion
last week that Packwood may have vio
lated the law.
"The chairman has branded me all
over this country as a criminal," Pack
wood said, jabbing his hand in the air.
Bryan retorted, "My statement was
only to the possibility of such criminal
violations and was made in the context
that this Senate needs to know of the
potential gravity of the offense."
The debate, sometimes emotional,
sometimes stuck on legalities, raged on
for nearly seven hours before senators
gave up for the night and decided to con
tinue today.
Packwood had said earlier that his
more than 8,000 pages of writings
include entries on the sex lives of fellow
lawmakers. He added yesterday that the
diaries included references to history
making events and matters that "are
very, very personal."
He said a deal might be worked out if
the committee would describe to him the
potential criminal conduct it said it
recently discovered in the diaries.
A Packwood aide said yesterday
morning that the senator was trying to
negotiate a last-minute compromise, but
there was no evidence of any talks once
the debate moved to the Senate floor.
There, Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,
defended Packwood's contention that
the committee chairman went too far in
his statement about potential criminali
ty
"This proceeding has been seriously
tainted by the word 'criminal,' " Warner

said, adding that Bryan could have char
acterized the diary information simply
as "misconduct."
Bryan said he mentioned possible
criminal conduct to counter "a barrage
of disinformation" by Packwood and his
lawyers, who suggested the panel was on
a fishing expedition.
The committee won a strong
endorsement from Sen. Patty Murray,
D-Wash. 112 who said that a vote in favor of

the committee subpoena "sends a mes
sage to citizens throughout our nation
that sexual misconduct in this Senate
will be investigated to the fullest possi
ble extent."
Failure to back the committee, she
said, "would send a clear message also to
every woman in this country: if you are
harassed, keep quiet, say nothing. The
cards are stacked against you ever win
ning."
