## Editorials Vote Tom Campbell 
### 
SLIGHTLY over a year ago,
Tom Campbell was defeated
in the primary for the Repub
lication nomination for the U.S.
Senate seat currently held by Bar
bara Boxer. At the time, many felt
Campbell's defeat may have meant
the end of a gifted political career.
However, such was not the case.
Campbell is again campaigning for
the senate — in this case, the Cali
fornia state Senate — and is the
front-runner in the race for the
11th District seat.
Campbell's position is well
deserved. His undeniable intellect,
his earnest devotion to pivotal
issues and his Stanford connection
served him well as a member of the
House of Representatives in Wash
ington and will continue to do so in

Sacramento.
As a representative, Campbell
compiled a moderate record, the
result of a careful and weighty
examination of issues. His pro
choice stance on abortion, support of
gun-control initiatives and free
market economic policies demon
strate a determination to stand by
principles which may not always be
embraced by a majority of voters (or
interest groups) but which are clear
ly in the public's best interests.
Opponents have declared that
Campbell is merely using the state
senate as a means to "remain in the
public arena." However, such a
charge ignores both Campbell's
earnest devotion to make improve
ments and contributions to the
political process and the realities of
California's government under the
new term-limit law.
And, in any event, a few years of
Tom Campbell arc better than
none.
