# Propositions recap

### 
Proposition 174, Califor
nia's school-voucher initiative,
would offer each school-age
child a $2,600 voucher to use at a pri
vate school. Backers say the plan
would save money and improve the
quality of schools though competi
tion.
Voters have every right to be skep
tical. Official legislative estimates of
the proposition project a range of
financial outcomes, from millions in
savings to $1.3 billion in added year
ly costs for the state.
The measure would also allow
voucher-redeeming schools to dis
criminate on the basis of gender,

income, and mental and physical dis
abilities.
Does California really want to let
its 5 million students be guinea pigs
for an experiment with potentially
disastrous consequences?
Proposition 172, a half-cent sales
tax, would ensure funding for public
safety.
If this measure passes, it will raise
about $1.5 billion to provide funding
for police and fire departments, ben
efit the war on gangs and drugs, and
effect the implementation of crime
education programs.
Opponents to Proposition 172 say
the legislature should cut other
areas of the budget to fund public
safety. However, the state's budget is
already stretched to a paper-thin
margin.
The recent fires in Southern Cali
fornia have shown the enormous
importance of firefighters. And with
the ever-increasing levels of violence
in the state, police forces also must
not suffer from funding difficulties.
