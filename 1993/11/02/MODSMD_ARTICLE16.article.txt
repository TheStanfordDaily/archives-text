## Stanford's police state 
### 
WHEN WE throw a party, my
house is the safest place on cam
pus. An army of Stanford police
officers are deployed around the perime
ter of the dwelling, and one can watch the
spectacle of their flashlights tracing
pedestrians go to and from the party. I
know that I am safe under the watchful
eyes of Big Brother and Big Sister (this is
Stanford, after all).
Clearly we do need police officers of
some sort on the Stanford campus. How
ever, there is a very real difference
between protecting a safe campus envi
ronment and creating a police state on
Friday and Saturday nights. It has
always been my feeling that police
should be on call for an emergency, but
they should not be waiting outside the
door looking for an incident.
When we look outside our doors, who
are these caustic cops? According to
"The New Stanford Farm Almanac"
they are deputy sheriffs whose training
"exceeds California standards for full
function Peace Officers." Translation:
these caustic cops are really toy cops.
The "Almanac" also states that "the
Department is a multi-service agency."
Well, if by multi-service agency they
mean a group which closes parties, pro
vides minor-in-possession tickets
(MIPs) to students walking back to their
dorms, and stops scooter riders who do
not come to a full stop at one of the infi
nite intersections on Campus Drive,

then they are correct. I call that general
disservice.
In general I have respect for police
officers, especially those who risk their
lives every day. That is clearly not the
case here at Stanford. The only arrests
listed by the Almanac for the years 1989
through 1993 are in three categories:
alcohol violations, drug violations, and
weapons possession. For the latter cate
gory there was only one arrest noted in
the last year. There were 496 burglaries
and 682 bike thefts on campus in 1992
but not a single arrest is listed for
either. That's probably because all of
the department's resources are mobi
lized for staking out parties on Mayfield
Avenue.
My favorite stories are of those ine
briated freshmen who were stopped on a
Saturday night by the Stanford police
while stumbling home. The first ques
tion always seems to be "where were you
drinking tonight?" This is a not-so-sub
tle form of intimidation used to nab
those party-throwers who were not
infallible in their party management.
Just because we are Stanford stu
dents does not mean we should not be
allowed to have fun. While there is a
great deal of under-age drinking on cam
pus, there are degrees of law enforce
ment. As the police do not search
through freshmen dorms for alcoholic
substances, they should not peer in
through fraternity windows and lie in

waiting along the streets.
This is a simple matter of privacy and
freedom from humiliation. Overzealous
police officers create an uncomfortable
environment even for those who are fol
lowing the law. The Stanford police are
like the parental chaperones who made
every junior high-school party a drag. In
essence, Stanford allows us to take
exams without chaperones, but we must
have chaperones at our parties. We are
adults and we don't need chaperones,
even if they are multi-service peace
chaperones.
It is time that we lift the marshal rule
imposed on weekend nights. Stanford
claims to be a liberal, progressive envi
ronment, but the message has not
reached the Department of Public Safe
ty. As I have stated before, if we wish to
build a truly free and open society we
must start by creating a free community
at Stanford.
With freedom comes a little less safe
ty. There will no longer be a squadron of
police cars around my house. I will not
have Orwellian agents watching my
every move.

Jeremi is tired of watching police cars
pass his house every five minutes every
Friday night.
