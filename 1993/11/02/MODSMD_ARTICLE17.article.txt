## Student proposes more flexibility in DR categories 
### 
AS STANFORD re-examines the
undergraduate curriculum this
year, I have some proposals to
offer for revising the current distribu
tion requirement system.
I hope that these revisions will con
tribute to the formulation of a new
DR system that will be more effective
in accomplishing its purpose and
more intellectually satisfying to stu
dents.
I propose that the number of dis
tinct distribution areas be decreased
(aside from any changes in the total
number of required distribution
courses). Furthermore, any course of
three or more units whose content
falls within a DR area should be appli
cable toward fulfilling the DR. This
would end the current practice of des
ignating only certain selected courses
as DR-fulfilling.
Here is an example of such a system:

• Mathematics, natural sciences and
applied sciences: any three courses
from at least two of these areas;
• Social sciences: any two courses;
• Humanities: any two courses.
I believe that such a system would
be more conducive to increasing the
breadth of a student's education,
while providing the academic freedom
needed for ambitious major plans.
The breadth of one's knowledge
cannot be accurately measured by a
checklist. While exposure to various
disciplines may be important, interest,
intellectual involvement and depth of
understanding in these fields are
equally precious. Under the new sys
tem, students would still be required
to take courses in fields very different
from their majors, and thus be
exposed to diverse forms of thought
and knowledge. However, those fortu
nate enough to find new interests in

distribution subjects would be encour
aged to pursue them in greater detail
and acquire a fuller understanding of
these disciplines. The proposed system
would encourage students to discover
and develop new abilities in areas out
side their major and to extend their
minds in new directions.
This would be more effective in pro
moting a liberal education than forc
ing students to sample courses in
eight or nine areas in the process of
filling out a long checklist. With
today's DR system, students often get
away with learning very little in the
course of half-heartedly staisfying a
requirement; this is an example of
merely going through the motions
without achieving the intended pur
pose.
With so many DRs, students with
demanding study plans (such as dou
ble majors or undergraduate research)

frequently feel pressured to satisfy the
requirements by a superficial, disin
terested sampling of watered-down
classes. The current systems leaves
little time for these students to take
additional courses in distribution
areas which interest them. The prob
lem is compounded by the fact that
many of the more advanced courses
that might be taken for enrichment
are not even accepted as DRs. On the
other hand, the proposed system
would offer these students the oppor
tunity for a more truly liberal and
more satisfying education.
While these proposals may appear
to run contrary to the traditional DR
system, this is one case where Stan
ford should assert its independence in
instituting reforms with clear bene
fits.
