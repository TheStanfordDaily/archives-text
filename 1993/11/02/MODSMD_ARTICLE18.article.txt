# Stanford's pest control policies are tragic and infrequently publicized
## 
### 
All the world may be a stage, but
with all acting, there is a hidden
truth. And whether you look at a play
as a comedy or tragedy often depends
on the underlying reality behind the
well-rehearsed lines. So before readers
of your article last week on raccoons
decide whether they are amused or
annoyed by these campus critters (as
the title of the article aptly suggests),
we need to look behind the facade put
on by the various actors in the rac
coon drama.
Rich Skalski, Stanford's pest con
trol Held representative, pointed out
that "Stanford's maintenance crews
set live traps and bring the captured
raccoons to the Santa Clara Humane

Society." But this is not as benign as
it sounds. What happens at the
"Humane" Society is anything but
humane. Despite the fact that they
may "have their little ones now," as
Grounds Supervisor Larry Atwater
also noted, the raccoons are systemati
cally put to death.
But this is not part of the script, so
Atwater and Skalski paint their rosy
pictures blind to their lack of basic
human decency.
But the "Best Actor" award must
go to Ray Busley, vice president and
regional manager for Crane Pest Con
trol. His verbiage hides one undeni
able truth: that his company makes
money for every animal he captures
and hauls away to be killed. Crane
"Pest" Control has been criticized in
the past for insensitivity in its trap
ping procedures and for overusing poi
sons and pesticides. No matter that in
1985, Stanford lost a great horned
owl, while last year it lost a barn owl,

both victims of poisoning.
And why should it matter? For,
behind the scenes, the Stanford crew
is busy exterminating the wildlife.
(What campus resident who was here
in 1989 does not remember the dead
birds, squirrels and other wildlife we
had to walk around when Stanford
decided that they were a nuisance and
indiscriminately poisoned the lot of
the?)
And what of the argument that
these animals carry rabies? Don't
expect the actors to offer the fact that
there has not been a human rabies
case reported in Santa Clara County
since the 1920s because it isn't part of
the script.
The play may be called "The Farm"
(with its images of green fields and
happy animals) but the reality is
something tragic. But, then, the show
must go on.
