# Letters Policy
## 
### 
The Daily welcomes letters from
its readers. Letters will be published
at the editor's discretion and are
subject to editing.
AH letters must include the
author's name, phone number and
Stanford affiliation, if any.
Submissions with more than five
signatures must designate a repre
sentative.
Letters should be turned in on a
Macintosh disk in Microsoft Word
format with a paper copy of the sub
mission.
Disks should have the owner's
name written clearly on the front
and may be picked up two business
days after they have been dropped
off.
