# State's high court shows little support for drug-testing ban
## Ruling could have widespread effects; athletes will likely face NCAA testing 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer with AP wire reports 
In what may be its most important pri
vacy-rights case in years, the state Supreme
Court yesterday began hearing the NCAA's
appeal to Stanford's 6-year-old lawsuit
challenging drug-testing requirements.
So far, the Court has showed little en
thusiasm for Stanford's case, indicating
that the University will likely be subject to
NCAA guidelines.
"You're proposing to allow a cheater . . .
to get a competitive edge," Justice Armand
Arabian told a lawyer representing former
Stanford athletes, who claimed that
mandatory drug testing violated their right
to privacy.
However, Athletic Director Ted Leland
said last night that the case is not an issue
of competitive advantage. "We just want to

protect Stanford students from violations
of their privacy," he said.
Assoc. Athletic Director Tom Beckett
agreed, saying, "I think that the initial con
cern was never that Stanford was opposed
to drug testing."
The case is based on the NCAA's 1986
drug-testing program, which some Stan
ford athletes contended was a violation of
California's Right to Privacy Act. The
NCAA program in question tested for
steroids, amphetamines and several other
substances, and also asked students about
their use of birth control pills.
Robert Van Nest, the attorney repre
senting the Stanford athletes, said that stu
dents who do not exhibit suspicious behav
ior should not be subject to infringement of
privacy in order to participate in sports.
"The NCAA is the only game in town" for
college athletics, he said.
When Van Nest complained
that athletes not suspected of
wrongdoing were forced to dis
robe and submit to urine testing
in the presence of a monitor, Jus
tice Ronald George asked whether
athletes weren't benefitted by the
creation of a "level playing field."
Justice Joyce Kennard also
noted that participation in sports
is voluntary, implying that ath
letes who object to certain drug
testing requirements can choose
not to play certain sports.
Leland discounted the signifi
cance of the court's skepticism.
"You can't judge the winner by

the coin toss," he said, emphasiz
ing that it is too early to make any
assumptions regarding the trial's
outcome.
A ruling is expected on the case
within 90 days. Legal experts say
the ruling may have implications
for other privacy issues, including
abortion and workplace rights.
Stanford was able to receive an
exemption from the NCAA pro
gram — which requires random
testing of participants in national
championship events and post
season football games — through
lower-court rulings.
"We feel that the NCAA pro
gram has moved a long way in the
last seven or eight years to being
acceptable to us," Leland said.
"But there are still some things
we need to be concerned about."
The NCAA, which governs
major-college sports, has been

ruled a private organization, and,
as a result, is not bound by feder
al privacy regulations.
But California adopted its own
privacy law in 1972, which guards
against privacy infringements by
employers and businesses as well
as the government.
According to Beckett, "It was a
concern that there was an inva
sion of privacy involved," that
caused Stanford students to initi
ate the lawsuit.
The 1987 suit against the
NCAA was originally filed by the
American Civil Liberties Union
representing Simone LeVant, the
former captain of the Stanford
women's diving team. The Uni
versity later joined the suit.
After an injunction was
ordered against testing LeVant,
another suit was filed in 1988 by
former women's soccer captain

Jennifer Hill and football player
Barry McKeever.
They won rulings by a Santa
Clara County Superior Court
judge and a state appeals court
that the NCAA had failed to show
that the testing program was nec
essary or effective.
This is the first case in which
the court must rule directly on
drug testing and privacy rights in
the private sector. It is also the
first privacy case to reach the
court since conservatives gained a
nwyority in 1987.
If the ruling goes against the
NCAA, it could be invoked by
other college athletes in the state
who wish to exempt themselves
from testing. In turn, such a deci
sion would raise questions about
the testing of non-California
schools' athletes.
A broader ruling could set new

standards for privacy rights,
affecting pre-employment psycho
logical screening and abortion
related cases — possibly involving
restrictions on clinic protests and
parental consent for minors.
During yesterday's proceed
ings, Van Nest said that since the
NCAA has concluded that drugs
do not improve performance, its
testing practices are hypocritical.
He also pointed out that the
NCAA spends virtually nothing
on drug education.
The program "tests too many
sports, too many people and too
many drugs and asks too much
information from people who do
not test positive," Steven Mayer, a
lawyer for the University, told the
court.
In addition to being watched
while they urinate, participants
must disclose such personal infor

mation as whether they use birth
control pills, according to Van
Nest.
C. Douglas Floyd, a lawyer for
the NCAA, said the program was
needed to protect athletes, to pre
serve competition and to combat
the pressure some athletes feel to
take drugs regardless of the scien
tific evidence of their effects.
Monitoring of the urine tests was
needed to guard against altering
samples, he added.
Arabian said a university
should encourage fair competition
as well as "bring forth graduates
who will enhance the possibility of
drug-free America."
A former college wrestler, Ara
bian said he would have liked to
know "if the guy I was wrestling
had something in his system
other than the Wheaties he had
for breakfast."
