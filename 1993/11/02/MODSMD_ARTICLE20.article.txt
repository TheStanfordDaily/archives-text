# N'Gai Croal: notes of a non-native son
## Night of the dawn of the day of the living whiteboy 
### 
Someone must have told him it was
whiteboy day. Is it whiteboy day?
—Gary Oldman as Drexl Spivey, a white
pimp who thinks he's black in the movie
"True Romance "
ACTUALLY, 1993 has been Whiteboy
Year. And not in the white men who
miss Larry Bird like crazy but
couldn't jump if their lives depended on it
derogatory way, either. From "This Boy's
Life" to "A Bronx Tale" by way of "The
Adventures of Huck Finn," "Dennis the
Menace" and "Free Willy," it has literally
been a year in which young white boys
became übiquitous in film.
It had to happen. If 1991 was the year
that black and queer cinemas bum-rushed
the show and 1992 was the Year of the on
sale-now-for-less-than-one-million-dollars-
Woman, it was just a matter of time before
the empire struck back, strapped harder
than a sequel.
The motives, as always, were fistfuls of
dead presidents. Hollywood went on a PG-13
binge, hoping that movies anyone could see
meant that everyone would go see them. It

should have been as easy as 1-2-3: put a beau
tiful blond cherub in your movie, show him
prominently in your publicity and hire
Brinks' armored trucks to cart off mo' money,
mo' money, mo' money. More on that later.
Whiteboy cinema became a genre, a
repository for screenwriters and directors
who had lost touch with their inner children
even as they tried to raise their own kids.
Daddy might not have loved them enough,
but New Age father knows best when it
comes to resolving past and present Oedipal
tensions: make a movie about it. Ah, the
therapeutic power of making whiteboy
movies — at just 20 million dollars a pop.
Whitegirls sat in the trunk on this ride.
In what could have been mistaken for a
reprise of Richard Pryor's "The Toy," Huck
Finn sailed down the Mississippi with his
very own full-grown pet negro in Disney's
"The Adventures of Huck Finn," bringing
back remembrances of plantation days
past. The boy who wanted to save the
whales presumably earned his reservation
pass by hanging out with a Native Ameri
can at Sea World. The homoerotic over
tones of "This Boy's Life" and the feverish

jungles of "A Bronx Tale" kicked whitegirls
even closer to the curb of irrelevance.
Whiteboys and whitegirls were allowed
to share the screen as long as they knew
their place, Agnieszka Holland's "The
Secret Garden" notwithstanding. Hence,
the hysterical screamer in "Jurassic Park,"
the two harpies — one whiny, one bitchy —
of "Man Without A Face" and the annoying
kil\joy Margaret in "Dennis the Menace."
We could see the pleas of white men that
"We've had it hard too" reflected in their
work, through the iconographic absent
father. The glossy unreality of "Last Action
Hero" made way for the gritty reality of a
whiteboy in a single-parent family who gets
violently robbed in his bad neighborhood.
Fortunately, Arnold Schwarzenegger
shows up to teach him a crucial four-letter
word: TEC-9 — fully automatic, of course.
Steven Soderbergh eschewed the twen
ty-something antics of "sex, lies and video
tape" for the ten-something troubles of a
whiteboy abandoned by both parents and
starving during the Great Depression.
Even current action hero Mel Gibson got in
on that subgenre with "Man Without A

Face," another tale of boy without a dad —
all the kid wants to do is learn from his sur
rogate father, but mom doesn't get it and
calls in the cops. Truly heartbreaking.
Not all of the sentiments toward white
boys was particularly tender, betraying an
ambiguous anger at those bouncy bundles
of joy. How else to explain Papa Culkin's
insistence on 'lil Macaulay playing a psy
chotic Damien-wannabe who murders his
brother, tries to kill his sister and his moth
er, only to watch helplessly as mom drops
him from a cliff to save his cousin? Or a
menace named Dennis chased through the
neighborhood by Switchblade Sam, a
homeless man whose fashion ensemble
inevitably recalls the latest in child
molester / pervert wear? Even such a lover
of children as Steven Spielberg subjected
his whiteboy character to one of the most
harrowing experiences — a relentless
Tyrannosaurus Rex — in film this year.
Clearly, 1993 movies were no place for The
Beaver and his innocent ilk.
Whiteboy cinema wasn't exactly the most
lucrative racket in town — only "Jurassic
Park," "Dennis the Menace" and "Free

Willy" performed to or above expectations.
I.ikp the casting of rappers in gangsta movies
before them, casting a whiteboy was no
guarantee of success, even when paired with
two of the world's biggest action heroes.
Pitching to kids wouldn't do it either; low
returns forced Miramax to retool its cam
paign for the double-whiteboy extravaganza,
"Into the West," aiming squarely at an adult,
art-house crowd. But those problems
haven't stopped Hollywood from churning
these movies out. New whiteboy features
"Josh and SAM.," "Flight of the Innocent"
and Clint Eastwood's latest, "A Perfect
World" will grace your multiplex with their
presence in the near future.
So the next time you go to see a movie,
ask yourself, "Is it whiteboy day?" Because
in 1993, the odds are high that it is.
