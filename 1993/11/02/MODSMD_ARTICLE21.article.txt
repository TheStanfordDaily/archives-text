## Playoffs? Hockey tops Cal, looks toward Championships 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
After clinching the second-place position in
the Northern Pacific Conference with a 5-1 win
over the University of the Pacific on Wednesday,
the Stanford field hockey team sought to ensure
a winning record by taking the season finale
against California on Saturday. More important
ly, they needed the win to keep their NCAA tour
nament hopes alive.
"We have to win, and we are going to win,"
said senior Danielle Beynet, before her last game
at Maloney Field. True to Beynet's word, the Car
dinal responded with a 1-0 upset victory, their
season-high fourth-straight triumph.
Ail-American Sara Hallock scored her career
high 25th goal of the season 10 minutes into the
California game to give the Cardinal the early
advantage. By comparison, Cal's entire team has
scored only 20 goals in 1993.
Then, the Cardinal controlled the game by
keeping the ball away from its own goal. While
this didn't result in more scores for Stanford, it
kept Cal from mustering any true scoring
threats. When Cal did try to score, Stanford goal
keeper Loretta Hidalgo kept the ball from touch
ing the net as she recorded her sixth shutout of
the season.
The victory for Stanford was its first in three
attempts against Cal this season. The Golden
Bears' loss prevented them from securing their
first perfect NorPac season in school history and
dropped their record to 6-6 overall and 4-1 in the
NorPac. Despite the setback, Cal has clinched the
NorPac regular season title and will host Stan
ford in the NorPac Championship game Nov. 5.
Meanwhile, Stanford moved to 9-7 overall and
4-2 in the NorPac. Another win over Cal in the
NorPac Championship game could possibly
launch Stanford into the NCAA Tournament for
the sixth time in head coach Sheiyl Johnson's
nine-year tenure and the first time since 1991.
The NorPac Championship on Friday promis
es to be an intriguing matchup. There is no love
lost between the two squads, and the Cardinal
players have criticized the Bears' attitude.
"Cal is really cocky," said forward Jen Gleuck
before Saturday's match-up. "We are going to
show them who is best."
