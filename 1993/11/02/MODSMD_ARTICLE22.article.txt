# Spikers to fight Cal in second Big Match
## 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volleyball team is once again
headed in the right direction. Now all it has to do is stay
on the path.
The sixth-ranked Cardinal (16-5, 9-4 in the Pacific
10 Conference) will encounter its next obstacle tonight
in the second Big Match of the season, facing off against

California (10-12, 3-10 in the Pac-10) in Maples Pavil
ion at 7 p.m.
After dropping matches to Arizona State and Ari
zona the previous weekend, Stanford righted itself by
sweeping Washington on Friday night 15-6,15-4, 15-5,
then duplicating the feat on Saturday against No. 21
Washington State, 15-13, 16-14, 15-4.
"We learned a lot from our two losses," said senior
tri-captain Heidi Eick. "This past week in practice we

pushed ourselves harder than we thought we could —
that makes us feel like we deserve to win now."
Much of the Cardinal's training focused on its tradi
tionally weak passing game and its high number of
attack errors. In hopes of strengthening Stanford's out
side hitting, head coach Don Shaw implemented a line
up change, moving sophomore Maureen McLaren from
the middle blocker position to the left side hitter spot,
relying on freshman Nikki Otto to cover the middle
McLaren handled the adjustment well. She swung
for a .750 hitting percentage against the Huskies and
came away without a single attack error. The following
night she racked up another six kills.
While the new lineup eliminated some of the hitting
errors which have plagued the Cardinal attack, Stan
ford's success also stemmed from a tightening of its
serving as well as its passing.
"We served really tough and sided out better than
we have been, instead of letting them get strings of
points," Eick said.
The Stanford defense allowed Washington only 28
kills for a .113 hitting percentage, while allowing the
Cougars 41 slams for a .109 percentage. The Cardinal
swung at a .427 clip against the Huskies and .230 the
following night. While much of this renewed effort was
a result of positioning and strategy, mental preparation
also played a large role.
"We did a good job of continuing to side out," said
sophomore Cary Wendell. "When they got their kills,
we said, 'Okay, great hit, next play,' instead of letting it
get us down."
In a sport which relies on close teamwork, morale is
a key factor which many times determines the outcome
of a match. After the Arizona weekend, the Cardinal
managed to recapture the positive spirit which marked
the first half of its season.
"Right now I think we have a really positive atti
tude," Wendell said. "We're tiying to be really aggres
sive, no matter what situation we get in."
Stanford will need to harness this aggression
tonight against an improving Cal squad. The Bears
enter tonight's contest having split its weekend match
es. In a marathon competition last Friday, the Bears
fought the Cougars to the end, but the effort did not
prove enough to keep Washington State from a 15-13,
11-15, 15-13, 9-15, 15-8 victory. Making a quick recov
ery, however, the Bears came back on Saturday to
sweep the Huskies 15-4, 15-3,15-8.
Pleased with the Cardinal's performance last week
end, Shaw will continue to follow his season-long phi
losophy of gradual improvement leading to a peak in
December.
"We need to just keep getting better," Shaw said.
"We have the luxury now of having six more matches
for the whole month of November. Mainly now we're
going to start working to improve and be as good as we
can be when the playoffs roll around."
