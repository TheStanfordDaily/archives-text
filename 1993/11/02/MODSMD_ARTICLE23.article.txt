# Well-rounded rankings
## Consideration of athletics makes Stanford a cinch for the top U.S. News spot

What makes a ranking a ranking?
A few weeks ago, U.S. News and World
Report published its annual "America's Best
Colleges" edition. For the seventh-straight year,
the magazine dedicated an entire issue to spit
ting out its list of the top 25 schools in the coun
try, crowning them the "Best National Universi
ties."
Best National Universities. Simple. Direct.
Extremely pompous.
How does U.S. News create this magical list?
First, it compiles a myriad of bits of information
in categories ranging from undergraduate accep
tance rates and SAT scores to average faculty
salaries and class sizes.
Then, the magazine wades through flow
charts, graphs, Venn diagrams, trigonometric
identities, algorithmic functions and Newtonian
truths that even your Calc 41 TA wouldn't be
able to understand to come up with its top 25.
The whole idea seems a bit crazy to the out
sider, overburdened with throngs of statistical
data that seem to make no sense whatsoever.
Pages upon pages are filled with numbers atop
numbers — the magazine resembles a veritable
orgy of statistics.
Needless to say, it's a sports junkie's paradise.
Or so I thought. Who else would derive any
sort of pleasure from ingesting this profusion of

numbers?
Yet athletic programs play no part in this
ranking process. Successes on the playing field,
long preached to be an integral part of American

education, are completely ignored by the maga
zine.
This is shocking, almost blasphemous.
National ranking charts owe their existence to
intercollegiate sports — the Associated Press
was compiling lists of top college football pro
grams before U.S. News was even founded. How
can U.S. News ignore the dozens of athletic polls
which rank colleges on a weekly basis?
Let's take a look at the rankings. Stanford
finished sixth on the "Top Colleges" list, our low
est ranking ever. But who placed above us in this

vaunted poll?
Finishing just above the Cardinal in the
fourth and fifth slots were MIT and Cal Tech.
Both of these schools compete at the NCAA Divi
sion 111 level — Stanford vaults over these
schools with ease if athletic programs are taken
into account.
The top three schools in the poll are as pre
dictable as the butcher, baker and candlestick
maker. Harvard, Princeton and Yale snatched
win, place and show, respectively.
Each of these colleges supports a full-fledged
NCAA Division I athletic program. Would they
have reached such lofty heights if their athletic
successes were taken into account?
Consider football, for starters. Harvard, Yale
and Princeton all rank among the five win
ningest college gridiron programs of all time,
with Yale topping the list with its 772 wins.
But the three universities strike out in the
"What have you done for me lately?" category.
The Ivy League stepped down from Division 1-A
to a less intense 1-AA in 1978. This is under
standable — the league hadn't been nationally
competitive in college football for decades.
However, since the league downgraded a
level, Harvard, Princeton and Yale have only
