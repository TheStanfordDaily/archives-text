# Well-rounded rankings
## Consideration of athletics makes Stanford a cinch for the top U.S. News spot 
### 
What makes a ranking a ranking?
A few weeks ago, U.S. News and World
Report published its annual "America's Best
Colleges" edition. For the seventh-straight year,
the magazine dedicated an entire issue to spit
ting out its list of the top 25 schools in the coun
try, crowning them the "Best National Universi
ties."
Best National Universities. Simple. Direct.
Extremely pompous.
How does U.S. News create this magical list?
First, it compiles a myriad of bits of information
in categories ranging from undergraduate accep
tance rates and SAT scores to average faculty
salaries and class sizes.
Then, the magazine wades through flow
charts, graphs, Venn diagrams, trigonometric
identities, algorithmic functions and Newtonian
truths that even your Calc 41 TA wouldn't be
able to understand to come up with its top 25.
The whole idea seems a bit crazy to the out
sider, overburdened with throngs of statistical
data that seem to make no sense whatsoever.
Pages upon pages are filled with numbers atop
numbers — the magazine resembles a veritable
orgy of statistics.
Needless to say, it's a sports junkie's paradise.
Or so I thought. Who else would derive any
sort of pleasure from ingesting this profusion of

numbers?
Yet athletic programs play no part in this
ranking process. Successes on the playing field,
long preached to be an integral part of American

education, are completely ignored by the maga
zine.
This is shocking, almost blasphemous.
National ranking charts owe their existence to
intercollegiate sports — the Associated Press
was compiling lists of top college football pro
grams before U.S. News was even founded. How
can U.S. News ignore the dozens of athletic polls
which rank colleges on a weekly basis?
Let's take a look at the rankings. Stanford
finished sixth on the "Top Colleges" list, our low
est ranking ever. But who placed above us in this

vaunted poll?
Finishing just above the Cardinal in the
fourth and fifth slots were MIT and Cal Tech.
Both of these schools compete at the NCAA Divi
sion 111 level — Stanford vaults over these
schools with ease if athletic programs are taken
into account.
The top three schools in the poll are as pre
dictable as the butcher, baker and candlestick
maker. Harvard, Princeton and Yale snatched
win, place and show, respectively.
Each of these colleges supports a full-fledged
NCAA Division I athletic program. Would they
have reached such lofty heights if their athletic
successes were taken into account?
Consider football, for starters. Harvard, Yale
and Princeton all rank among the five win
ningest college gridiron programs of all time,
with Yale topping the list with its 772 wins.
But the three universities strike out in the
"What have you done for me lately?" category.
The Ivy League stepped down from Division 1-A
to a less intense 1-AA in 1978. This is under
standable — the league hadn't been nationally
competitive in college football for decades.
However, since the league downgraded a
level, Harvard, Princeton and Yale have only


Brian
Egan
won three outright league football
titles. Combined
But we won't stop here. U.S.
News ranked Stanford 77th in
"Alumni Satisfaction," an ambigu
ous category determined "by the
average percentage of a school's liv
ing alumni who gave to its 1991
and 1992 fund drives." Princeton
and Yale finished fifth and sixth in
this particular statistic, while Har
vard came in at No. 29.
I propose a much simpler for
mula. Happy alumni make happy
fans — let's estimate the number of
a school's living alumni who
attended any 1991 or 1992 football
games. Over the last two seasons,
Stanford averaged 50,000 fans per
home game. Not one of the three
top Ivies managed that figure for a
single game.
But football is certainly not the
be-all and end-all of college athlet
ics. Compare the results of the
schools in other sports. Harvard
won the NCAA ice hockey title in
1989. The Crimson were national
champs in women's lacrosse in
1990. They have never won a

national title in any other sport.
Our country's best college is one
that has never excelled at any sport
played on a national level. .. it's a
bit hard to believe.
A aimilftr case can be made with
both Princeton and Yale. The Tigers
won the men's lacrosse champi
onship two years ago. Their biggest
athletic claim to fame is a men's bas
ketball team that loses in the first
round of the NCAA Tournament
every year. Their athletic program is
undaunting, to say the least.
And Yale? The Bulldogs are cur
rently tops in the country in water
polo ... on a dub level They were a
dominant force in men's swimming,
winning four national titles... in the
1940's and 1950'5. They do not strike
fear in the hearts of sports fans from
other schools.
Rankings are given low priority on
the Farm. Grade point averages
aren't calculated, class rankings don't
exist ... such rating systems are
frowned upon because of their non
sensical natures.
Perhaps it's not worth it go get
riled up about the U.S. News poll. But
our athletic program, clearly superior
to those at other "top" schools, is com
pletely ignored in these rankings.
On this page of the newspaper,
such a slight is unforgivable.

be-all and end-all of college athlet
ics. Compare the results of the
schools in other sports. Harvard
won the NCAA ice hockey title in
1989. The Crimson were national
champs in women's lacrosse in
1990. They have never won a

national title in any other sport.
Our country's best college is one
that has never excelled at any sport
played on a national level. .. it's a
bit hard to believe.
A aimilftr case can be made with
both Princeton and Yale. The Tigers
won the men's lacrosse champi

athletic claim to fame is a men's bas

round of the NCAA Tournament
every year. Their athletic program is
undaunting, to say the least.
And Yale? The Bulldogs are cur

polo ... on a dub level They were a
dominant force in men's swimming,
winning four national titles... in the
1940's and 1950'5. They do not strike
fear in the hearts of sports fans from
other schools.
Rankings are given low priority on
the Farm. Grade point averages
aren't calculated, class rankings don't
exist ... such rating systems are
frowned upon because of their non
sensical natures.
Perhaps it's not worth it go get
riled up about the U.S. News poll. But
our athletic program, clearly superior
to those at other "top" schools, is com
pletely ignored in these rankings.
On this page of the newspaper,
such a slight is unforgivable.
What makes a ranking a ranking?
A few weeks ago, U.S. News and World
Report published its annual "America's Best
Colleges" edition. For the seventh-straight year,
the magazine dedicated an entire issue to spit
ting out its list of the top 25 schools in the coun
try, crowning them the "Best National Universi
ties."
Best National Universities. Simple. Direct.
Extremely pompous.
How does U.S. News create this magical list?
First, it compiles a myriad of bits of information
in categories ranging from undergraduate accep
tance rates and SAT scores to average faculty
salaries and class sizes.
Then, the magazine wades through flow
charts, graphs, Venn diagrams, trigonometric
identities, algorithmic functions and Newtonian
truths that even your Calc 41 TA wouldn't be
able to understand to come up with its top 25.
The whole idea seems a bit crazy to the out
sider, overburdened with throngs of statistical
data that seem to make no sense whatsoever.
Pages upon pages are filled with numbers atop
numbers — the magazine resembles a veritable
orgy of statistics.
Needless to say, it's a sports junkie's paradise.
Or so I thought. Who else would derive any
sort of pleasure from ingesting this profusion of

numbers?
Yet athletic programs play no part in this
ranking process. Successes on the playing field,
long preached to be an integral part of American

education, are completely ignored by the maga
zine.
This is shocking, almost blasphemous.
National ranking charts owe their existence to
intercollegiate sports — the Associated Press
was compiling lists of top college football pro
grams before U.S. News was even founded. How
can U.S. News ignore the dozens of athletic polls
which rank colleges on a weekly basis?
Let's take a look at the rankings. Stanford
finished sixth on the "Top Colleges" list, our low
est ranking ever. But who placed above us in this

vaunted poll?
Finishing just above the Cardinal in the
fourth and fifth slots were MIT and Cal Tech.
Both of these schools compete at the NCAA Divi
sion 111 level — Stanford vaults over these
schools with ease if athletic programs are taken
into account.
The top three schools in the poll are as pre
dictable as the butcher, baker and candlestick
maker. Harvard, Princeton and Yale snatched
win, place and show, respectively.
Each of these colleges supports a full-fledged
NCAA Division I athletic program. Would they
have reached such lofty heights if their athletic
successes were taken into account?
Consider football, for starters. Harvard, Yale
and Princeton all rank among the five win
ningest college gridiron programs of all time,
with Yale topping the list with its 772 wins.
But the three universities strike out in the
"What have you done for me lately?" category.
The Ivy League stepped down from Division 1-A
to a less intense 1-AA in 1978. This is under
standable — the league hadn't been nationally
competitive in college football for decades.
However, since the league downgraded a
level, Harvard, Princeton and Yale have only

won three outright league football
titles. Combined
But we won't stop here. U.S.
News ranked Stanford 77th in
"Alumni Satisfaction," an ambigu
ous category determined "by the
average percentage of a school's liv
ing alumni who gave to its 1991
and 1992 fund drives." Princeton
and Yale finished fifth and sixth in
this particular statistic, while Har
vard came in at No. 29.
I propose a much simpler for
mula. Happy alumni make happy
fans — let's estimate the number of
a school's living alumni who
attended any 1991 or 1992 football
games. Over the last two seasons,
Stanford averaged 50,000 fans per
home game. Not one of the three
top Ivies managed that figure for a
single game.
But football is certainly not the
be-all and end-all of college athlet
ics. Compare the results of the
schools in other sports. Harvard
won the NCAA ice hockey title in
1989. The Crimson were national
