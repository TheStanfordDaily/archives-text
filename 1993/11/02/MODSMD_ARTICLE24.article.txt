# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Talk about home field/pool/track/gym
/course advantage! Over the weekend, 13
varsity athletic events took place on the
Farm, and Stanford won 12. The only "loss"
was the men's cross country team's fifth
place finish in the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships.
With so many successes, the criteria for

choosing only two outstanding athletes
becomes nit-picky at best. Keeping that in
mind, The Daily has chosen Andre Kirwan
and Stephanie Jensen as its Athletes of the
Week for their outstanding performances in
leading their respective squads to conference
victories.
One hundred and fifty three yards. It
even sounds impressive. Against Oregon
State on Saturday Kirwan hauled in nine
passes to accumulate this Rice-esque total.
He was also on the receiving end of a 33-yard
touchdown pass from Steve Stenstrom in the
third quarter of the Cardinal win.
A redshirt freshman, Kirwan got his first
colllegiate start this Saturday, replacing an
injured Justin Armour, the Cardinal's lead
ing receiver.

It was a team victory for the Stanford
women's cross country team this Saturday
on the Stanford Golf Course. With all five
runners placing within 12 seconds of one
another, the Cardinal was able to bring
home its first-ever Pac-10 crown. The leader
of the wave of red and white was junior
Stephanie Jensen.
A Bay Area native, Jensen chose to attend
Notre Dame after graduation from high
school. But after two years of racing for the
highly-regarded Irish women's cross-coun
try team, she decided to display her talents a
little closer to home. And, in a steadily

increasing fashion, the Stanford community
is taking notice.
Jansen surpassed her other impressive
early season performances with a stellar race
on Saturday. Starting out mid-pack and
gradually progressing forward, Jensen was
the first Stanford runner to cross the finish
line in 17 minutes and 31 seconds, in eighth
place overall.
