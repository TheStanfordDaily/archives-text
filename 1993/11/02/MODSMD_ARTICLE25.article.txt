# Playoff-bound soccer team to oppose Gaels
## 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
Reports of the Stanford men's
soccer team's death have been
greatly exaggerated. Instead,
today's match against St. Mary's,
the final game of the regular sea
son, will merely be a precursor to
postseason competition.
Had it not been for divine inter
vention, the team might indeed be
playing their final game of the year
this afternoon. However, contrary
to some rumors, the team will play
in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation playoffs for the third
year in the row.
The Cardinal (7-8-2) has little to
prove against the Gaels, who are in
the midst of a rebuilding season.
Yet Stanford gives no indication of
their intent to sit back and revel in
their postseason possibilities.
"If we got out there and [get
beat badly], we will be looking over
our shoulders and wondering
which team will show up [against
UCLA]," said coach Colin Lin

The dual personality that has
plagued the Cardinal all year
seems to have subsided in the past
few weeks. Stanford's Jekyll and
Hyde tendencies cost them many
close games in the regular season,

but the squad's 5-0-1 record in the
last six games indicates a turn
away from the young team's earli
er inconsistencies.
Although the Gaels will not pose
the formidable challenge that the
Cardinal will face against sixth
ranked UCLA (16-2) on Friday, the
game is an opportunity for Stan
ford to prove something to them
selves and gain momentum for the
playoffs.
"It's important to play well and
continue what you have been doing
up until this point," said senior for
ward Rick Goad. "We don't want to
lose confidence going into the
UCLA game."
Lindores also desires a win
against the Gaels to fulfill a team
goal set before the season began.
"We wanted to reach that .500
record," Lindores said. "That was
our original goal."
The St. Mary's game will also
give Lindores a chance to fiddle
with the lineup and play some
younger players, giving aching
older athletes some much-needed
rest and the team some much
needed experience.
"We will play a variety of guys
out there," Lindores said. "A couple
of our people have injuries, and it
