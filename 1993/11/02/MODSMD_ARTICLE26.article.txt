Who would ever think Stanford
would join hands with the Wee
nies?
But this unlikely event is actu
ally taking place. The Cardinal and
California men's crew teams have
been participating in mock dual
meets in a joint effort to grow more
competitive and oust Washington
from the first-place Pacific 10 Con
ference slot.
"We see Cal not as an enemy
but as another team trying to do its
best," said coach Wieslaw Kujda,
who is counting on Stanford to do
its utmost to improve last year's
second-place Pac-10 showing and
become one of the top three teams
in the nation.
In the several home-and-away
races held so far against Cal, Stan
ford has won all four-man boat
races, but has lost in the eight-man
races. Kujda believes many of the
younger oarsmen are still trying to
get a feel for handling larger boats,
which require less individual skill

but more team unity.
In more formal competition, the
Cardinal turned in a somewhat
successful performance at the
annual Head of the Charles in
Boston, held Oct. 24, Stanford
came in 14th — eighth among uni
versities, but also behind six club
teams.
Despite finishing behind Brown
and Harvard, which came in as the
top collegiate teams, Kujda was
consoled by the fact that Stanford
has barely started getting into
shape, while East Coast schools
have had five to six more weeks of
practice.
Nonetheless, he thinks the
team could do even better.
"We did good but I think we
could have placed in the top five
collegiate teams," Kiyda said.
Kuttya acknowledges the Cardi
nal will have to improve its team
unity to combat such difficult
opposition. "Our mental tough
ness is the top in the country, but
we are like the Stanford Band - a
bunch of nerds having a good
time."
