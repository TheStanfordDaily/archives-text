# Education report promises to attract national attention

When the Commission on Undergrad
uate Education releases its final report
next year, Stanford's faculty and students
won't be the only ones interested in its
findings.
While many universities — such as
Harvard, the University of California and
the University of Rochester — have and
are taking extensive looks at their under
graduate programs, Stanford's conclu
sions should draw widespread attention
and scrutiny, many higher education ex
perts say.
According to Peter Smith, director of

public affairs at the Association of Ameri
can Universities, "Stanford has a higher
profile, and no matter how comparable
the other efforts are, if something hap
pens at Stanford ... it is more likely to be
noticed," he said.
Russell Ellis, UC-Berkeley's vice-chan
cellor for undergraduate affairs, com
mented, " I can guarantee it will be noticed
nationally," and said he would be interest
ed in the report when it is issued.
As a member of the Western Associa
tion of Schools and Colleges — the com
mittee that accredited Stanford in 1991 —
Ellis said he gained a great insight into the
University's teaching and educational
philosophy.

"Stanford is a very unique institution,"
he observed, "where undergraduates get a
very rich and complex undergraduate cur
riculum."
But Ellis added that just because Stan
ford is one of the country's more visible in

stitutions does not mean the commis
sion's proposals will have "a generaliz
ability" that pertains to all other institu
tions nationwide.
Still, the commission's final report
could have a major impact among the rel
atively small number of research-based
institutions to which Stanford belongs.
Stanford is just one of approximately
600 research institutions out of 3600 col
leges and universities, according to presi
dent of the American Council of Educa
tion Robert Atwell.
For this small group of research uni
versities, educational issues such as class
size, availability of faculty to undergradu
ates, and the balance between teaching

and research are particularly significant,
Atwell said.
He added that under former Universi
ty President Donald Kennedy and now
under University President Gerhard
Casper's helm, overall national aware
ness of Stanford's education has in
creased.
Atwell noted that Stanford's debate on
Western curriculum in the late 1980s led
to a nationwide interest in the subject,
even drawing the attention of former Sec
retary of Education William Bennett.
In the University's recently initiated
undergraduate education review, Atwell
