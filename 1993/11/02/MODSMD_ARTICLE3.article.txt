# Education report promises to attract national attention
## 
### Skip Schwartz Senior staff writer 
When the Commission on Undergrad
uate Education releases its final report
next year, Stanford's faculty and students
won't be the only ones interested in its
findings.
While many universities — such as
Harvard, the University of California and
the University of Rochester — have and
are taking extensive looks at their under
graduate programs, Stanford's conclu
sions should draw widespread attention
and scrutiny, many higher education ex
perts say.
According to Peter Smith, director of

public affairs at the Association of Ameri
can Universities, "Stanford has a higher
profile, and no matter how comparable
the other efforts are, if something hap
pens at Stanford ... it is more likely to be
noticed," he said.
Russell Ellis, UC-Berkeley's vice-chan
cellor for undergraduate affairs, com
mented, " I can guarantee it will be noticed
nationally," and said he would be interest
ed in the report when it is issued.
As a member of the Western Associa
tion of Schools and Colleges — the com
mittee that accredited Stanford in 1991 —
Ellis said he gained a great insight into the
University's teaching and educational
philosophy.

"Stanford is a very unique institution,"
he observed, "where undergraduates get a
very rich and complex undergraduate cur
riculum."
But Ellis added that just because Stan
ford is one of the country's more visible in

stitutions does not mean the commis
sion's proposals will have "a generaliz
ability" that pertains to all other institu
tions nationwide.
Still, the commission's final report
could have a major impact among the rel
atively small number of research-based
institutions to which Stanford belongs.
Stanford is just one of approximately
600 research institutions out of 3600 col
leges and universities, according to presi
dent of the American Council of Educa
tion Robert Atwell.
For this small group of research uni
versities, educational issues such as class
size, availability of faculty to undergradu
ates, and the balance between teaching

and research are particularly significant,
Atwell said.
He added that under former Universi
ty President Donald Kennedy and now
under University President Gerhard
Casper's helm, overall national aware
ness of Stanford's education has in
creased.
Atwell noted that Stanford's debate on
Western curriculum in the late 1980s led
to a nationwide interest in the subject,
even drawing the attention of former Sec

to a nationwide interest in the subject,
even drawing the attention of former Sec

In the University's recently initiated

said the impact of the commis
sion and its findings will have a
lot to do with the role of its pres
ident. "Much depends on Ger
hard Casper's leadership. . . .
What he has said on [undergrad
uate education] is something
people will listen to," Atwell
said.
Other efforts
Stanford is certainly not alone
in its re-examination of the
undergraduate process. Over the
last decade, universities across
the country have taken time to
rethink their methods of teach
ing.
According to Smith, the uni
versity association is in the pro
cess of surveying its member
institutions about undergradu
ate education to see the results of
many of these re-evaluations and
"the fresh approaches being tried
. . . ways to do a better job of refo
cusing attention to undergradu
ates and ways to give teaching
more weight."
Many of these re-evaluations
and changes often stem from one
of two causes — an administra
tive call for the process or
impending constraints due to
new financial difficulties. Both
causes apply at Stanford.
Ellis thinks that the work of
Stanford's commission will
acquire greater significance in
the coming months as higher
education institutions every
where are witnessing a "conver
gence of issues — money, themes
of undergraduate education, the
changing world of academia."
For UC-Berkeley and the Cali
fornia university system, a 1985
U.S. Department of Education
report was what altered the
course in its dealings with under
graduates, according to Julie
Gordon, the UC system's coordi
nator for undergraduate educa
tional issues.
The report, which criticized
many research universities for
neglecting undergraduates,
prompted the UC system to look
"at ways the university could
take its different kinds of activi
ties and ways to tie them more
closely to undergraduate stud

ies," Gordon said.
Additional university-wide
task forces were then formed to
periodically examine undergrad
uate education, she said. But
implementation of many of their
suggested changes — such as
offering smaller classes — were

cation, the changing

delayed by budget problems.
Financial constraints forced
individual campuses to make
choices regarding what they
could afford to offer students.
"Dealing with lower budgets
forced us to give up [some small
classes] in the interest of having
something at all," Gordon
added.
She said that UC-Berkeley
"has been watching Stanford as
we watch other institutions" to
see how they deal with issues
such as changes in the curricu
lum and budget cuts.
At the University of
Rochester, an extensive study of
its undergraduate education was
instigated by its new president in
1984 — in much the same way as
at Stanford — said Bob Kraus,
executive director of Rochester's
Office of Public Relations.
According to Kraus, the year
long study, conducted by the 18-
member Commission on Univer
sity Goals, "looked into what a
University of Rochester educa
tion might be." The commis
sion's work resulted in "a num
ber of specific changes in the
undergraduate program, as well
as [the recommendation that
there be] a different kind of
attention paid to undergraduate
concerns than previously," he
added.

Although not all of the com
mission's final recommendations
were implemented, the scope of
the school's undergraduate edu
cation was still substantially
expanded, for example, by the
creation of a bachelor of arts
degree in engineering.
In addition, three significant
changes — a "Take Five" pro
gram, a new freshman transcript
policy and a University Day —
were implemented in 1986,
aimed at expanding students'
learning beyond their mqjor.
The first offers students the
opportunity to study free for a
fifth year at Rochester if they can
make an argument that they
need "to take additional studies
to broaden their perspective
before they leave," he said.
Kraus said that this program
has been very popular and has
shown "the university's commit
ment to a broad liberal arts edu
cation."
The new transcript policy has
also tried to achieve that commit
ment, as freshman-year grades
are not recorded on a final tran
script so new students can "be
more adventurous in their stud
ies," Kraus said.

"so that students can attend
seminars, forums, poetry read
ings or concerts" and take more
advantage of what the university
has to offer, he said.
Kraus added that these
changes occurred while the uni
versity was working to reduce
high administrative costs within
individual departments.

DRs vs. a Core
James Sheehan, chair of Stan
ford's commission, said he has
been gathering information about
other universities' undergraduate
evaluations. While noting that
"every school is slightly different
with a different sort of problems,"
he said he still feels it is important
for the commission to look at
what other schools have done.
Sheehan said he will likely dis
tribute information about Har
vard's Core Curriculum to com
mission members when discus
sion about distribution require
ments begins.
In 1978, the Core replaced
Harvard's 32-year-old system of
distribution requirements.
According to the Harvard
Gazette, the Core's basic premise
is that "every Harvard graduate
should be broadly educated, as
well as trained in a particular
academic specialty."
Students must take eight let
ter-graded courses out of the 10
Core areas. The goal of this cur
riculum is to ensure that students
have a knowledge of all aspects of
the world around them, are
exposed to other cultures, can
think critically about moral and
ethical problems and have basic
writing and reasoning skills.
Even though Harvard has suf
fered through budget problems
in recent years, the system "is
here to stay for the immediate
future," according to John New,
assistant director of the Office of
News and Public Affairs.
While financial constraints
forced the university to make
administrative cuts, an immi
nent capital campaign has also
made the school critically exam
ine its academic planning process
and the way it spends its money,
New said.
He added that this re-exami
nation is just part of the univer
sity's cycle of looking at its
undergraduate education.
And although Stanford's com
mission will certainly look at the
undergraduate reform efforts of
Harvard and other universities,
Sheehan said it is "unlikely" that
its final report will end up copy
ing another school's system.
"We have to start with what
we know best and what we are
concerned with — Stanford and
ourselves," he said.

the other efforts are, if something hap
pens at Stanford ... it is more likely to be
noticed," he said.
Russell Ellis, UC-Berkeley's vice-chan
cellor for undergraduate affairs, com
mented, " I can guarantee it will be noticed
nationally," and said he would be interest
ed in the report when it is issued.
As a member of the Western Associa
tion of Schools and Colleges — the com
mittee that accredited Stanford in 1991 —
Ellis said he gained a great insight into the
University's teaching and educational
philosophy.

"Stanford is a very unique institution,"
he observed, "where undergraduates get a
very rich and complex undergraduate cur
riculum."
But Ellis added that just because Stan
ford is one of the country's more visible in

stitutions does not mean the commis
sion's proposals will have "a generaliz
ability" that pertains to all other institu
tions nationwide.
Still, the commission's final report
could have a major impact among the rel
atively small number of research-based
institutions to which Stanford belongs.
Stanford is just one of approximately
600 research institutions out of 3600 col
leges and universities, according to presi
dent of the American Council of Educa
tion Robert Atwell.
For this small group of research uni
versities, educational issues such as class
size, availability of faculty to undergradu
ates, and the balance between teaching

and research are particularly significant,
Atwell said.
He added that under former Universi
ty President Donald Kennedy and now
under University President Gerhard
Casper's helm, overall national aware
ness of Stanford's education has in
creased.
Atwell noted that Stanford's debate on
Western curriculum in the late 1980s led
to a nationwide interest in the subject,
even drawing the attention of former Sec
retary of Education William Bennett.
In the University's recently initiated
undergraduate education review, Atwell

said the impact of the commis
sion and its findings will have a
lot to do with the role of its pres
ident. "Much depends on Ger
hard Casper's leadership. . . .
What he has said on [undergrad
uate education] is something
people will listen to," Atwell
said.
Other efforts
Stanford is certainly not alone
in its re-examination of the
undergraduate process. Over the
last decade, universities across
the country have taken time to
rethink their methods of teach
ing.
According to Smith, the uni
versity association is in the pro
cess of surveying its member
institutions about undergradu
ate education to see the results of
many of these re-evaluations and
"the fresh approaches being tried
. . . ways to do a better job of refo
cusing attention to undergradu
ates and ways to give teaching
more weight."
Many of these re-evaluations
and changes often stem from one
of two causes — an administra
tive call for the process or
impending constraints due to
new financial difficulties. Both
causes apply at Stanford.
Ellis thinks that the work of
Stanford's commission will
acquire greater significance in
the coming months as higher
education institutions every
where are witnessing a "conver
gence of issues — money, themes
of undergraduate education, the
changing world of academia."
For UC-Berkeley and the Cali
fornia university system, a 1985
U.S. Department of Education
report was what altered the
course in its dealings with under
graduates, according to Julie
Gordon, the UC system's coordi
nator for undergraduate educa
tional issues.
The report, which criticized
many research universities for
neglecting undergraduates,
prompted the UC system to look
"at ways the university could
take its different kinds of activi
ties and ways to tie them more
closely to undergraduate stud

ies," Gordon said.
Additional university-wide
task forces were then formed to
periodically examine undergrad
uate education, she said. But
implementation of many of their
suggested changes — such as
offering smaller classes — were

cation, the changing

delayed by budget problems.
Financial constraints forced
individual campuses to make
choices regarding what they
could afford to offer students.
"Dealing with lower budgets
forced us to give up [some small
classes] in the interest of having
something at all," Gordon
added.
She said that UC-Berkeley
"has been watching Stanford as
we watch other institutions" to
see how they deal with issues
such as changes in the curricu
lum and budget cuts.
At the University of
Rochester, an extensive study of
its undergraduate education was
instigated by its new president in
1984 — in much the same way as
at Stanford — said Bob Kraus,
executive director of Rochester's
Office of Public Relations.
According to Kraus, the year
long study, conducted by the 18-
member Commission on Univer
sity Goals, "looked into what a
University of Rochester educa
tion might be." The commis
sion's work resulted in "a num
ber of specific changes in the
undergraduate program, as well
as [the recommendation that
there be] a different kind of
attention paid to undergraduate
concerns than previously," he
added.

Although not all of the com
mission's final recommendations
were implemented, the scope of
the school's undergraduate edu
cation was still substantially
expanded, for example, by the
creation of a bachelor of arts
degree in engineering.
In addition, three significant
changes — a "Take Five" pro
gram, a new freshman transcript
policy and a University Day —
were implemented in 1986,
aimed at expanding students'
learning beyond their mqjor.
The first offers students the
opportunity to study free for a
fifth year at Rochester if they can
make an argument that they
need "to take additional studies
to broaden their perspective
before they leave," he said.
Kraus said that this program
has been very popular and has
shown "the university's commit
ment to a broad liberal arts edu
cation."
The new transcript policy has
also tried to achieve that commit
ment, as freshman-year grades
are not recorded on a final tran
script so new students can "be
more adventurous in their stud
ies," Kraus said.

"so that students can attend
seminars, forums, poetry read
ings or concerts" and take more
advantage of what the university
has to offer, he said.
Kraus added that these
changes occurred while the uni
versity was working to reduce
high administrative costs within
individual departments.

DRs vs. a Core
James Sheehan, chair of Stan
ford's commission, said he has
been gathering information about
other universities' undergraduate
evaluations. While noting that
"every school is slightly different
with a different sort of problems,"
he said he still feels it is important
for the commission to look at
what other schools have done.
Sheehan said he will likely dis
tribute information about Har
vard's Core Curriculum to com
mission members when discus
sion about distribution require
ments begins.
In 1978, the Core replaced
Harvard's 32-year-old system of
distribution requirements.
According to the Harvard
Gazette, the Core's basic premise
is that "every Harvard graduate
should be broadly educated, as
well as trained in a particular
academic specialty."
Students must take eight let
ter-graded courses out of the 10
Core areas. The goal of this cur
riculum is to ensure that students
have a knowledge of all aspects of
the world around them, are
exposed to other cultures, can
think critically about moral and
ethical problems and have basic
writing and reasoning skills.
Even though Harvard has suf
fered through budget problems
in recent years, the system "is
here to stay for the immediate
future," according to John New,
assistant director of the Office of
News and Public Affairs.
While financial constraints
forced the university to make
administrative cuts, an immi
nent capital campaign has also
made the school critically exam
ine its academic planning process
and the way it spends its money,
New said.
He added that this re-exami
nation is just part of the univer
sity's cycle of looking at its
undergraduate education.
And although Stanford's com
mission will certainly look at the
undergraduate reform efforts of
Harvard and other universities,
Sheehan said it is "unlikely" that
its final report will end up copy
ing another school's system.
"We have to start with what
we know best and what we are
concerned with — Stanford and
ourselves," he said.
When the Commission on Undergrad
uate Education releases its final report
next year, Stanford's faculty and students
won't be the only ones interested in its
findings.
While many universities — such as
Harvard, the University of California and
the University of Rochester — have and
are taking extensive looks at their under
graduate programs, Stanford's conclu
sions should draw widespread attention
and scrutiny, many higher education ex
perts say.
According to Peter Smith, director of

public affairs at the Association of Ameri
can Universities, "Stanford has a higher

the coming months as higher
education institutions every
where are witnessing a "conver
gence of issues — money, themes
of undergraduate education, the
changing world of academia."
For UC-Berkeley and the Cali
fornia university system, a 1985
U.S. Department of Education
report was what altered the
course in its dealings with under
graduates, according to Julie
Gordon, the UC system's coordi
nator for undergraduate educa
tional issues.
The report, which criticized
many research universities for
neglecting undergraduates,
prompted the UC system to look
"at ways the university could
take its different kinds of activi
ties and ways to tie them more
closely to undergraduate stud

ies," Gordon said.
Additional university-wide
task forces were then formed to
periodically examine undergrad
uate education, she said. But
implementation of many of their
suggested changes — such as
offering smaller classes — were

delayed by budget problems.
Financial constraints forced
individual campuses to make
choices regarding what they
could afford to offer students.
"Dealing with lower budgets
forced us to give up [some small
classes] in the interest of having
something at all," Gordon
added.
She said that UC-Berkeley
"has been watching Stanford as
we watch other institutions" to
see how they deal with issues
such as changes in the curricu
lum and budget cuts.
At the University of
Rochester, an extensive study of
its undergraduate education was
instigated by its new president in
1984 — in much the same way as
at Stanford — said Bob Kraus,
executive director of Rochester's
Office of Public Relations.
According to Kraus, the year
long study, conducted by the 18-
member Commission on Univer
sity Goals, "looked into what a
University of Rochester educa
tion might be." The commis
sion's work resulted in "a num
ber of specific changes in the
undergraduate program, as well
as [the recommendation that
there be] a different kind of
attention paid to undergraduate
concerns than previously," he
added.

Although not all of the com
mission's final recommendations
were implemented, the scope of
the school's undergraduate edu
cation was still substantially
expanded, for example, by the
creation of a bachelor of arts
degree in engineering.
In addition, three significant
changes — a "Take Five" pro
gram, a new freshman transcript
policy and a University Day —
were implemented in 1986,
aimed at expanding students'
learning beyond their mqjor.
The first offers students the
opportunity to study free for a
fifth year at Rochester if they can
make an argument that they
need "to take additional studies
to broaden their perspective
before they leave," he said.
Kraus said that this program
has been very popular and has
shown "the university's commit
ment to a broad liberal arts edu
cation."
The new transcript policy has
also tried to achieve that commit
ment, as freshman-year grades
are not recorded on a final tran
script so new students can "be
more adventurous in their stud
ies," Kraus said.
Every Wednesday afternoon
has been designated as Universi
ty Day, when no classes are held

"so that students can attend
seminars, forums, poetry read
ings or concerts" and take more
advantage of what the university
has to offer, he said.
Kraus added that these
changes occurred while the uni
versity was working to reduce
high administrative costs within
individual departments.

DRs vs. a Core
James Sheehan, chair of Stan
ford's commission, said he has
been gathering information about
other universities' undergraduate
evaluations. While noting that
"every school is slightly different
with a different sort of problems,"
he said he still feels it is important
for the commission to look at
what other schools have done.
Sheehan said he will likely dis
tribute information about Har
vard's Core Curriculum to com
mission members when discus
sion about distribution require
ments begins.
In 1978, the Core replaced
Harvard's 32-year-old system of
distribution requirements.
According to the Harvard
Gazette, the Core's basic premise
is that "every Harvard graduate
should be broadly educated, as
well as trained in a particular
academic specialty."
Students must take eight let
ter-graded courses out of the 10
Core areas. The goal of this cur
riculum is to ensure that students
have a knowledge of all aspects of
the world around them, are
exposed to other cultures, can
think critically about moral and
ethical problems and have basic
writing and reasoning skills.
Even though Harvard has suf
fered through budget problems
in recent years, the system "is
here to stay for the immediate
future," according to John New,
assistant director of the Office of
News and Public Affairs.
While financial constraints
forced the university to make
administrative cuts, an immi
nent capital campaign has also
made the school critically exam
ine its academic planning process
and the way it spends its money,
New said.
He added that this re-exami
nation is just part of the univer
sity's cycle of looking at its
undergraduate education.
And although Stanford's com
mission will certainly look at the
undergraduate reform efforts of
Harvard and other universities,
Sheehan said it is "unlikely" that
its final report will end up copy
ing another school's system.
"We have to start with what
we know best and what we are
concerned with — Stanford and
ourselves," he said.
