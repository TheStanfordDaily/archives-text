# Asbestos forces Hoover fellows, library to relocate â€” for a while
## 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
More than 35 Hoover Institu
tion scholars and staff will be
moved out of the Lou Henry
Hoover Building offices by Friday
so that asbestos can be removed
from the ventilation ducts.
Curators yesterday began to
temporarily relocate the circula
tion desk of the Institution's East
Asian Collection Library to the
courtyard level of the nearby
Hoover Memorial Building.
The Hoover Fellows and staff
currently occupying the building
will be moved to office space in the
Stanford Business Park adjacent
to campus on Page Mill Road.

Despite being forced to move,
most affected staff at Hoover
aren't complaining. "I'd rather re
main on campus," said Research
Fellow George Marotta. "(But)
they are really going out of their
way to make this as convenient as
possible for us."
Everyone will be able to keep
their phone number and office
equipment at the new location,
Marotta explained. "The only
thing we'll miss is the (interac
tion) with the other fellows," he
said.
No date has been set for when
the fellows will be able to move
back, according to Chonna De
laney, the facilities manager as
signed to the project. Because a

contractor has not yet been hired,
she said, "It's really hard to give a
time frame."
The date for opening the East
Asian Collection is also uncertain,
said Deputy Curator Mark Tarn,
explaining that the library is re
questing more money to defray
the costs of maintaining the two
locations.
"We will open the stacks to fac
ulty and graduate students for
limited hours," Tam said, adding
that researchers will also be able
to request materials at the relocat
ed circulation desk.
Delaney explained that the
work would involve removing
loose asbestos in air ducts and
"mechanical areas" as well as
"encapsulating" asbestos already
attached to walls.
She stressed that there is no
immediate danger because the
asbestos is not in any of the
building's working areas.
"This isn't a problem. ... It
just shouldn't be there," she said.
The asbestos was found last
month when facilities staff
opened the ducts while investi
gating complaints about poor air
circulation.
