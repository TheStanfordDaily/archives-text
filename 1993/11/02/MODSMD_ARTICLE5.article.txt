# Meyer to be multi-media mecca
## New program to provide training, low-cost equipment 
### Rosalind Wang 
In response to growing faculty interest in multi
media computer equipment, Stanford has joined a
new program that will enable it to purchase this
equipment at greatly reduced prices.
Stanford recently joined the New Media Centers
program, a relationship with an association of com
puter and publishing firms interested in promoting
the use of interactive media systems in education.
The program's goal is to establish 15 media cen
ters throughout North America by 1994. The Stan
ford Media Integration Lab for Education (SMILE),
located on the second floor of Meyer Library, is one of
the first of these centers, serving as a model for future
ones.
Under the program, Stanford and the other uni
versities involved will train faculty and students to
use multi-media equipment, as well as pay the costs of
maintaining the centers. The new centers will send
feedback to the funding corporations about the equip

ment. In return, the corporations will give the schools
greater discounts on hardware, software and other
company products.
These discounts will enable Stanford to purchase
more new equipment and upgrade current machines
with the same amount of allocated funds.
"This gives us a way to keep up to date with the
newest technology," said Charles Kerns, director of
the Curriculum Development Lab and the Media
Center. The older equipment can then be "recycled to
other parts of the campus."
SMILE currently contains two multi-media devel
opment systems and one SVHS editing machine,
which allows the user to digitize and add special ef
fects to video by computer. To use the machines, stu
dents and faculty must submit applications to
SMILE.
According to Kerns, Stanford's involvement in the
program stemmed from faculty requests for better
training in multi-media systems.
"Multi-media has tremendous
teaching potential," said John
Rick, associate professor of
anthropology. "It can incorporate
sound, sight, and text in a way
that textbooks can't... It is not a
linear teaching tool. The faculty
needs training to use it efficiently,
as it can be very complex. With
training, they can go from merely
being interested learners to profi
cient practitioners."
Workshops in SMILE to train
student assistants of faculty will
begin in December as one of the

ways to teach people about the
equipment.
The program benefits students
by giving them "access to the
same equipment as corporate
America," Kerns said.
"This technology truly is
new," said Byron Reeves, profes
sor of
communications. "Students will
be asked to be familiar with this
kind of equipment in any kind of
business. Things are changing so
quickly that it's important not to
fall behind."
The companies involved in the
program include Adobe Systems,
Apple Computer, FWB, Macro
media, Prentice Hall, Sony Elec
tronics and Super Mac Technolo
gy.
