# Group brings cultures together
## Cross Cultures trying to create multi-ethnic student group 
### Allison Short Staff writer 
It's hard to relate grinding
corn for tortillas with playing
traditional Hanukkah dreidel
games and celebrating the dawn
ing of the lunar new year. But
with the formation of a new stu
dent group, all of these distinct
cultures may now have a com
mon forum.
Cross Cultures, a new multi
ethnic student group, hopes to
unite students from various
backgrounds and invite them to
share their culture with others.
"Once you come to Stanford,
you're put with people from dif
ferent ethnicities, but kids tend
to collect in groups of their own
race because they feel most com
fortable with those people," ju
nior Lywan Kummer said. "We
want to provide a place that's
comfortable for people who
aren't all the same."
Cross Cultures focuses on a
different ethnic theme at each of
their meetings, held every other
Tuesday in a location appropri
ate to the evening's theme.

about the Japanese internment
camps and the recent reunion of
those alumni who were placed in
the camps.
At the next meeting, which will
be held tonight at El Centro Chi
cano, Cross Cultures will celebrate
El Dia de los Muertos, or the Day
of the Dead, Mexico's Halloween
which emerged from the country's
indigenous traditions. "Instead of
seeing death as a scary thing, it's
another part of life. It's a way of
cultural awareness," said junior
Irine Lara, who is coordinating the

celebration.
Students will begin the celebra
tion by paying homage to their
deceased relatives and friends,
bringing their photos before an
altar, Lara said. The group will
then create their own masks out of
plaster of paris by first forming
them to their faces with vaseline
and gauze, and then decorating
them in the traditional skeleton
style.
The group Cross Cultures
evolved out of the Half Asian Peo
ple's Association. HAP A members
Junko Peterson, Rob Axelrod and
Kummer felt last year that with
such a variety of interesting stu
dents on campus, a club should be
formed where students could learn

about their many diverse cultures.
"Nothing (in HAP A) was hap
pening," Kummer said. "It was
just another homogenous club."
"We wanted to change the focus
of HAP A and actually do some
thing," Peterson said. "It's good
for people to explore their ethnici
ty, but you need to share it with
other people because otherwise it
doesn't impact you."
HAPA was originally formed
four or five years ago for those stu
dents who were half Asian and
didn't quite feel like they fit into a
certain group, Kummer said. This
year HAPA wanted to expand into
a club which encompasses all cul
tures rather than just a select
group.

Kummer, Peterson and Axelrod
— along with the help of financial
manager Alicia Morga and chair
Ivan Han — came up with the idea
of the club, ant! after that "one
thing fell into place after the
other," Kummer said.
Cross Cultures derived their
name and logo from the Cross Col
ors clothing company, a division of
Threads 4 Life, which they use on
every flyer.
"It gives you an in-depth expo
sure to other cultures," said
sophomore David Stoffel, a
prospective member of Cross Cul
tures. "Besides just reading about
it, you get hands on experience
about another culture."
Cross Cultures is also planning

a celebration of Chinese New Year,
a folk dancing night, a Korean
theme night where students will
make sushi together, and possibly
a Filipino theme night.
Organizers see this year as a
"transition year" for Cross Cul
tures — they still haven't officially
changed their name from HAPA.
They hope to make the change
official soon because using the
name HAPA can turn people off if
they think their ethnicity doesn't
fit the title, Kummer said.
"We want everyone to be a
group of friends and teach each
other," Kummer said. "It's funny
to watch people teach others to use
chopsticks, but it's a friendly envi
ronment."

Cross Cultures, a new multi
ethnic student group, hopes to
unite students from various
backgrounds and invite them to
share their culture with others.
"Once you come to Stanford,
you're put with people from dif
ferent ethnicities, but kids tend
to collect in groups of their own
race because they feel most com
fortable with those people," ju
nior Lywan Kummer said. "We
want to provide a place that's
comfortable for people who
aren't all the same."
Cross Cultures focuses on a
different ethnic theme at each of
their meetings, held every other
Tuesday in a location appropri
ate to the evening's theme.

about the Japanese internment
camps and the recent reunion of
those alumni who were placed in
the camps.
At the next meeting, which will
be held tonight at El Centro Chi
cano, Cross Cultures will celebrate
El Dia de los Muertos, or the Day
of the Dead, Mexico's Halloween
which emerged from the country's
indigenous traditions. "Instead of
seeing death as a scary thing, it's
another part of life. It's a way of
cultural awareness," said junior
Irine Lara, who is coordinating the

celebration.
Students will begin the celebra
tion by paying homage to their
deceased relatives and friends,
bringing their photos before an
altar, Lara said. The group will
then create their own masks out of
plaster of paris by first forming
them to their faces with vaseline
and gauze, and then decorating
them in the traditional skeleton
style.
The group Cross Cultures
evolved out of the Half Asian Peo
ple's Association. HAP A members
Junko Peterson, Rob Axelrod and
Kummer felt last year that with
such a variety of interesting stu
dents on campus, a club should be
formed where students could learn

about their many diverse cultures.
"Nothing (in HAP A) was hap
pening," Kummer said. "It was
just another homogenous club."
"We wanted to change the focus
of HAP A and actually do some
thing," Peterson said. "It's good
for people to explore their ethnici
ty, but you need to share it with
other people because otherwise it
doesn't impact you."
HAPA was originally formed
four or five years ago for those stu
dents who were half Asian and
didn't quite feel like they fit into a
certain group, Kummer said. This
year HAPA wanted to expand into
a club which encompasses all cul
tures rather than just a select
group.

Kummer, Peterson and Axelrod
— along with the help of financial
manager Alicia Morga and chair
Ivan Han — came up with the idea
of the club, ant! after that "one
thing fell into place after the
other," Kummer said.
Cross Cultures derived their
name and logo from the Cross Col
ors clothing company, a division of
Threads 4 Life, which they use on
every flyer.
"It gives you an in-depth expo
sure to other cultures," said
sophomore David Stoffel, a
prospective member of Cross Cul
tures. "Besides just reading about
it, you get hands on experience
about another culture."
Cross Cultures is also planning

a celebration of Chinese New Year,
a folk dancing night, a Korean
theme night where students will
make sushi together, and possibly
a Filipino theme night.
Organizers see this year as a
"transition year" for Cross Cul
tures — they still haven't officially
changed their name from HAPA.
They hope to make the change
official soon because using the
name HAPA can turn people off if
they think their ethnicity doesn't
fit the title, Kummer said.
"We want everyone to be a
group of friends and teach each
other," Kummer said. "It's funny
to watch people teach others to use
chopsticks, but it's a friendly envi
ronment."
