Clinton signs SLAC bill into law
President Bill Clinton signed the Energy and
Water Bill on Oct. 30, which contained $36 million
in funding for the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter's proposed B factory.
The bill was passed by both houses of Congress
last week.
"[This] means we have a solid future," said
Michael Riordan, assistant to the director of SLAC.
"Our hands will be full for the next five years."
Riordan said no obstacles remain for the short
term future of the accelerator. He said he does not
foresee the government withdrawing support from
the project, as it did with the demise of the $11 bil
lion superconducting supercollider project in Texas.
Presently, the first day of construction is

planned for Jan. 1, 1994, although construction
may begin earlier, Riordan said.

Assoc. Law Prof. Joseph Grundfest was named

Grundfest, 42, said, "The thing that is particu
larly great is that the work fits in so well with my
teaching and research," he said. "It will generate so
much [material for me]."
Grundfest is director of the Law School's
Roberts Program in Law, Business and Corporate
Governance. "[This] is a wonderful synergistic
opportunity — and the meals are good too," he
said.
