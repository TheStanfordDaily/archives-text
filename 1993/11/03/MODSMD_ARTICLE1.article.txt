# Voters defeat voucher plan
## Sales tax extension OK'd 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer with AP wire reports 
California voters soundly defeated a controversial
school voucher initiative yesterday.
With 86 percent of precincts reporting, the mea
sure was losing by a wide margin — seven out of 10
voters cast their ballots against the proposal.
In another closely watched initiative battle,
Proposition 172 — which would permanently main
tain a half-cent sales tax to fund public safety depart-
ments — was ahead 57 percent to
43 percent with 86 percent of
precincts reporting. The sales tax
extension would replace $1.5 bil
lion of a $2.6 billion cut local gov
ernments took from the state,
although opponents said it would
also raise taxes on an average
family of four by $175 a year.
The school voucher initiative,
Proposition 174, would have
amended the state constitution to
award a $2,600 scholarship to any
California student. The scholar
ships could be redeemed at pri
vate schools meeting certain min
imum requirements.
Opponents of 174 celebrated the

initiative's defeat. Education Prof.
Martin Carnoy said he was pleased
with the results, but added that he
did not think voters have seen the
last of the voucher concept.
"I don't think this thing is
dead," he said. "Certainly, [sup
porters] can do a lot to make [a
future initiative] more attrac
tive."
Carnoy said he believes that
controversial aspects of the initia
tive — like inclusion of religious
schools — led to its defeat.
He added that he feels public
education needs "a tremendous
amount" of improvement, but
"putting education into the mar
ketplace [by using vouchers]
won't help too much."
Education Prof. Michael Kirst
said he didn't think future reform
proposals in California would nec

essarily involve only vouchers and
school choice.
"We need to broaden the dis
cussion to include other types of
reform," said Kirst, who co
directs Policy Analysis for Califor
nia Education, a non-partisan
think tank which studied the pro
posal's ramifications.
Future debates will focus more
on discussion of "local financing
techniques," expansion of "char
ter schools" within the public
school system and breaking down
large school districts to give more
control to voters, Kirst predicted.
He added that he thinks future
school reform proposals will not
be similar to 174, since tinkering
with the proposal to appeal to
more voters would alienate sup
porters.
"If they put more regulations

on to satisfy the public, they
would lose the support of some
private schools," Kirst explained.
"Crafting a winning coalition
[with a voucher plan] would be
very difficult," he said. "It's not
as easy as people think [since] you
could lose the political base you
started with."
Carnoy said he thinks that the
supporters of 174 were driven
more by "anti-government" senti
ment than by a desire to reform
schools.
"I think they're trying to send a
message.... They're trying to de
legitimize public sector interven
tion in anything," Carnoy said.
"The message I would like to
have seen is how to improve
schools," he said, explaining that
he didn't think 174 offered any
concrete reform proposals.

Voucher supporters "said that
all you need is competition [to
reform schools], but there's no
proof of that," Carnoy said.
"Government has a very
important role to play in society,"
he added.
In other initiative races, Cali
fornia voters rejected Proposi
tions 168, 169, 170 and 173.
Proposition 168 would have
allowed local governments to
plan, build and buy low-rent
housing without a vote. Proposi
tion 169 would have combined the
several bills that now make up
state budgets into one large bud
get bill, hoping to speed budget
passage.
Proposition 170 would have let
property taxes exceed their cur
rent 1 percent limit to pay for
community school-bond issues.

Proposition 173 would have
allowed bond issues to raise
money to give mortgage guaranty
insurance to first-time, low- and
moderate-income home buyers.
Proposition 171, which would
have given property tax breaks to
certain home owners whose hous
es were destroyed in natural dis
asters, was too close to call as of
press time.
Announcement of the state
wide tallies was delayed by the
wildfires which ravaged parts of
Southern California. Gov. Pete
Wilson signed an executive order
yesterday afternoon which kept
20 precincts in three fire-struck
counties open until 10 p.m.
California law mandates that
election results cannot be
announced until the last polling
place closes.

started with."
Carnoy said he thinks that the
supporters of 174 were driven
more by "anti-government" senti
ment than by a desire to reform
schools.
"I think they're trying to send a
message.... They're trying to de
legitimize public sector interven
tion in anything," Carnoy said.
"The message I would like to
have seen is how to improve
schools," he said, explaining that
he didn't think 174 offered any
concrete reform proposals.

Voucher supporters "said that
all you need is competition [to
reform schools], but there's no
proof of that," Carnoy said.
"Government has a very
important role to play in society,"
he added.
In other initiative races, Cali
fornia voters rejected Proposi
tions 168, 169, 170 and 173.
Proposition 168 would have
allowed local governments to
plan, build and buy low-rent
housing without a vote. Proposi
tion 169 would have combined the
several bills that now make up
state budgets into one large bud
get bill, hoping to speed budget
passage.
Proposition 170 would have let
property taxes exceed their cur
rent 1 percent limit to pay for
community school-bond issues.

Proposition 173 would have
allowed bond issues to raise
money to give mortgage guaranty
insurance to first-time, low- and
moderate-income home buyers.
Proposition 171, which would
have given property tax breaks to
certain home owners whose hous
es were destroyed in natural dis
asters, was too close to call as of
press time.
Announcement of the state
wide tallies was delayed by the
wildfires which ravaged parts of
Southern California. Gov. Pete
Wilson signed an executive order
yesterday afternoon which kept
20 precincts in three fire-struck
counties open until 10 p.m.
California law mandates that
election results cannot be
announced until the last polling
place closes.
