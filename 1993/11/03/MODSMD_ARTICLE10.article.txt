## New wildfires incinerate 100 homes, force evacuations 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Fierce winds sent a wild
fire barreling down mountain canyons into Malibu
yesterday, destroying more than 100 homes and
other buildings and forcing thousands — some of
them Hollywood's rich and famous — to flee.
Other new fires roared through brittle brushland,
just days after firestorms torched more than 800
buildings and burned thousands of acres across
Southern California. At least 12 people were injured
yesterday.
The largest fire rampaged through 20,000 acres
from the Santa Monica Mountains to Malibu, torch
ing at least 100 homes and seaside mansions and cre
ating a nightmarish traffic jam on the Pacific Coast
Highway.
A Coast Guard cutter was stationed offshore to
handle possible evacuations as a late-night, wind
whipped frenzy of fire approached Pepperdine Uni
versity and Hughes Research Laboratories, a high
tech research and development center.
University spokesman JefT Bliss said about 1,000
students and staff were sheltered in a campus gym
nasium, confident flames wouldn't overrun build
ings at the 830-acre, well-landscaped school.
"We're staying here until the fire department tells
us to move," Bliss said.
Firefighters established a command post on cam
pus and said they feared a mass evacuation of stu
dents and staff would deepen the logjam of emergen
cy vehicles and displaced residents on the coastal
highway, said Los Angeles County fire inspector
Robert Graham.
"My parents are hysterical," said Pepperdine
freshman Robert Vogt of San Antonio, Texas.
Vogt stood on a ridge above the campus, watching
the flames approach.
"I've got everything in my truck," he said. He said

his computer, stereo equipment and compact disks
were all ready to go if evacuation was necessary.
The blaze in western Los Angeles County created 1
a billowing cloud of reddish-brown smoke that was
visible 60 miles east. It forced public schools to can
cel classes and move students to shelters. At least
100 homes were burned, said Los Angeles County
Fire Inspector Michael Chuck.
The fires erupted as hot, dry Santa Ana winds
clocked at up to 53 mph returned to Southern Cali
fornia, complicating firefighters' efforts to control 13
blazes that torched thousands of acres and hundreds
of homes during the past week.
