# Senate demands diaries
## Ethics committee may take Packwood to court 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - By an
overwhelming vote, the Senate
backed a demand for full disclo
sure of Sen. Bob Packwood's
diaries yesterday night as part of
a probe into allegations of sexual
harassment and possible criminal
wrongdoing.
The 94-6 vote came after two
days of wrenching debate over
whether Packwood's rights were
being violated, and shortly after
one lawmaker called on the Ore
gon Republican to "have the
grace" to resign his seat of a quar
ter-century.
"I believe (Packwood) has lost
his grasp of what it means to be a
U.S. senator," said Sen. Robert C.
Byrd.
The vote came on a bid by the
Senate ethics committee to
enforce a subpoena for Pack
wood's diaries that the senator

has so far defied. Now, the com
mittee is expected to seek to
enforce the subpoena in court —
a move Packwood's lawyer said
he is likely to contest.
"At this point, I think our
inclination is to resist the subpoe
na on the grounds it exceeds the
4th Amendment rights of the
committee," Packwood lawyer
James Fitzpatrick said.
The vote came shortly after
the Senate voted 77-23 against
Sen. Alan K. Simpson's proposal
to narrow the scope of the com
mittee's subpoena to "relevant"
information. The information
pertained to alleged sexual mis
conduct, intimidation of witness
es and Packwood's attempt to get
his wife a job in exchange for
some official quid pro quo.
Simpson called the commit
tee's request so broad as to be

"frightening." But the Senate
accepted the argument of com
mittee leaders that anything less
than full compliance would let
Packwood determine what is "rel
evant."
Packwood spent much of the
day parrying with leaders of the
ethics committee in a wrenching
floor debate over allegations that
he sexually harassed women,
intimidated would-be witnesses
and then resisted Senate
attempts to investigate him.
Packwood was not on the floor
when Byrd called for his resigna
tion, but his lawyers were pre
sent.
Byrd said Packwood has cho
sen to stay "in spite of the contin
uing damage he is doing to the
body by prolonging this matter
and refusing to comply with the
ethics committee's request."
