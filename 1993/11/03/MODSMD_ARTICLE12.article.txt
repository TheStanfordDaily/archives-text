# PLO walks out of negotiations

### 
TABA, Egypt (AP) â€” The PLO walked out of peace
talks with Israel yesterday, accusing the Israelis of
trying to back out of an agreement to withdraw from
occupied lands.
Nabil Shaath, the PLO's chief negotiator, charged
that Israel wants to redeploy its troops rather than
pull them out of the occupied Gaza Strip and the town
of Jericho in the West Bank.
Israel's withdrawal plan, he said, ran counter to the
Sept. 13 Israel-Palestine Liberation Organization
agreement on Palestinian autonomy.
The Palestinian walkout was the first mtyor snag
since negotiations began three weeks ago on imple
menting the first phase of the autonomy plan.
But both sides said they wanted to resume the

talks, and the Palestinians might have walked out to
demonstrate their anger over the Israeli position on
withdrawal.
The talks in Taba, in their fourth round, are meant
to define how Israel will transfer some powers to Pales
tinians in Gaza and Jericho under terms of the Israeli-
PLO accord.
Yesterday's dispute grew from maps and withdraw
al plans the Israelis presented Monday, and apparently
centered on Israeli access to roads to protect Jewish set
tlements in Gaza.
Jewish settlers, saying their government has aban
doned them to make peace with Palestinians, waged four
days of violent protests in the occupied territories begin
ning Friday. The settlers did not take action yesterday.
