Stanford could increase
alumni contributions by
strengthening class ties

TO GET something, you have
to give something. And while
Stanford certainly gives a
great deal to its students, recent
statistics show a relatively low level
of alumni contributions in compari
son with other institutions of simi
lar size and stature.
Somewhere between a stu
dent's first steps through the
Quad and their final march to
receive their diploma, it seems,
something is missing — the some
thing that keeps many of these
individuals from giving back to
the University.
In order to look at alumni dona
tions in a constructive light, Stan
ford needs to take a good hard
look at the forces behind this apa
thy and figure out some feasible
solutions.
Stanford offers a quality educa
tion and a myriad of academic
resources, but the University
lacks certain aspects at a less tan
gible, more sentimental level.
Although we recently celebrated
our centennial, Stanford is with
out a sense of school history, a
feeling of campus unity and a
strong base of tradition, which are
often at the heart of alumni nos
talgia and goodwill.
Stanford has a handful of tradi
tional activities: Full Moon on the
Quad, Big Game, the Orientation
Square Dance, freshman advising
groups and freshman dorms,
among others.
But when all is said and done,
students leave the Farm without
the concrete bonds one would
expect between individuals and
their alma mater.
Stanford would be well served
by trying to generate some sense
of unity to counteract this trend.
Students rarely identify them

selves with their respective class
in a significant way until Senior
Pub Nights roll around.
Each year, the Classes of '94
through '97 have only one collec
tive grouping in the Freshman
Orientation, Sophomore Celebra
tion, Junior Convocation and
Senior Disorientation — events
which too often are characterized
by only a box lunch, a member of
the administration and poor
attendance.
If the University would liven up
these activities or have more
informal gatherings for students
of the same class — with, for
example, a band, some drinks and
good publicity — this crucial bond
between members of the same
graduating class could be fos
tered.
Having fond memories of
shared experiences would improve
students' attitudes about what
Stanford has offered them, educa
tionally and socially.
With students changing dorms
from year to year, the lack of stu
dent-professor contact and a
paucity of class unity, students
cling instead to other groups —
ethnic centers, extracurricular
activities, etc. This loyalty is not
to Stanford, sadly, and it is the
University that suffers.
This apathy could also be easily
remedied by rejuvenating student
associations in individual depart
ments. Although many such orga
nizations exist in both large and
small majors — from history to
symbolic systems — more fre
quent gatherings, social events
and academic-based activities
would create a new set of alle
giances.
Stanford should seriously con
sider taking concrete measures to
foster class, departmental and
campus unity.
The psychological benefits of
such offerings may seem easily
dismissed, but it would be the
University which would reap the
rewards, laughing all the way to
the bank.
