## The 						treasures dreams hold 
### 
LAST NIGHT I dreamt that Poe was
only kidding. While trying to write
an essay on the tragic lyrics of
Thomas Hardy, I fell asleep for a short
nap. I dreamt that a man with a long
mustache that, grew into a longer begird
was crouched at the foot of my bed, howl
ing poetry to me in Russian.
He paused and asked me if I spoke
Yiddish, and before I could answer, he
was rattling off words like "schmutta,"
"kepela," and "tchachka" with a rapid
ity that could baffle even my grand
mother. I am not joking; one cannot
make these things up.
It is amazing to me, the things I
dream about. Certainly they are far
more interesting than the thoughts
that occupy my mind when I am
awake. Well, perhaps it is a close call,
but the dream about Poe was the decid
ing factor: Sleep more; stay awake less.
Some will profess that people waste
a third of their lives sleeping. Not so. I
don't know for sure what you dream
about, but judging from the landscapes
that I traverse in the unconscious, I
would venture to say that when we're
asleep, we're not missing anything.
I have visited distant countries, wit
nessed ancient pasts, spoken in foreign
languages as if they were my mother
tongue. I have chatted with dead
geniuses who drop me coins of wisdom
as if they were only loose change. I am
rich with things that I forget in the

morning. But then, each night, I dive
back into the treasure. Like I said,
dreams of gold.
There are probably lots of theories
about how the unconscious is the great
joiner of all time-planes: histories,
pasts, futures, all existences crashing
together at once. Much must have been
written about how the shapes and
souls of those who have passed out of
this world return to us in dreams. As
for me, I haven't taken Sleep and
Dreams and I am not much of a believ
er in religions, afterlives or The Great
Hereafter.
I am a NOW thinker, and I've cho
sen to believe this: Our dreams are the
fusion of all things that we do not
know we know. Everything that we
have ever heard, seen, written, read
and thought we had forgotten, come
flying like bats out of the dark when we
fall asleep. And how truly amazing it
is.
In dreams, things we've left behind
return to us, mixing and clashing with
other things that might not rationally
fit together. All of the boundaries of
logic that we have created in order to
live structured and co-existing lives are
smashed to smithereens. And every
thing just flies and flows in together —
images, ideas, memories, visions. The
linear wire of time is bent into the
most peculiar shapes; places and peo
ple who have never met end up con

versing with each other.
Hence, Poe and I. Dreams give you a
chance to say things you probably
couldn't say in the waking hours. I toid
him I thought his writing was abhor
rent. He told me he was only kidding.
May all further studies of Edgar Allen
Poe cease: the man was only joking. I
know, we have spoken.
This is not a pitch for sleeping
through your life. Certainly it is not.
As Luke Greenley and R.N. Reynolds
have pointed out, I revel in my life,
find constant amazement in the world
of my waking hours. But that is only
one part of living. The other part
comes when we think we are resigning
ourselves to a few hours of darkness
and silence. Really though, each time
we fall into our nightly slumber, we are
stepping off into a world of the most
brilliant lightness we know.
Our gods and ghosts and everyone
under the sun join in for the magic car
pet ride of a lifetime. Only it happens
every night.

Nicole Krauss'dreams have inspired her
to polish up her Yiddish and make sure
that she has read thoroughly of all
deceased authors, lest they be more
malignant than Poe.
