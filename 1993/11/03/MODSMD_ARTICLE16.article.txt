## Museum is vital to preserving memories of Holocaust 
### 
AS A STUDENT of history, I have
some insight into how the Holo
caust began and what must be
done to ensure that it never happens
again. The first lesson, as Elie Weisel has
taught us, is to remember; the second is
to respond. In this context, I am
responding to Bradley Smith's virulent
and anti-Semitic message, particularly
his Revisionist View of the U.S. Holo
caust Memorial Museum. I also want to
applaud editors, like The Daily's Rajiv
Chandrasekaran, who understand the
danger associated with printing
untruths. I found his exploration into
this topic engaging and compelling. A
focal point of this dialogue is the U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Museum; since I
was present at the dedication of that
museum, I thought I would share my
thoughts and impressions about that
moment in history as a way of remem
bering and responding.
All of us who stood in the rain that
day were a part of histoiy: speakers,
prominent dignitaries, and each member
of the audience. The symbolism of Chaim
Herzog's presence was clear — as presi
dent of Israel he represented a country
expressly devoted to championing the
rights of and providing refuge for Jews.
The irony of Lech Walesa's presence was
also clear, coming only a few weeks after
the 50th anniversary of the Warsaw
Ghetto uprisings.
It was cold and wet, fitting that dark
period in modern civilization, but no one
moved during the dedication. The speak
ers stirred emotions ranging from sorrow
to defiance. Questions I had posed as a
child were echoed by the crowd: How
could this have happened? How can
there be a God if such things are possi
ble? How could so many people have
turned away knowing what they knew
about unspeakable atrocities, such inde
cencies of the hand and the heart? These
were the questions that were raised on
that day, questions I never expected to

hear raised in Washington, D.C. But that
bastion of politics and power is precisely
where these questions belonged. As Pres
ident Clinton said, "The Holocaust
reminds us forever that knowledge
divorced from values can only serve to
deepen the human nightmare, that a
head without a heart is not humanity."
There was no better place for such a
reminder than in our capital and at this
time in history when racial and ethnic
hatred are proliferating worldwide,
including ethnic cleansing in the former
Yugoslavia, racial segregation and vio
lence in South Africa, as well as the
oppression of the Kurds in Iraq and the
Baha'i in Iran.
There were also feelings of rage while
we listened to survivors and liberators
describe what they had seen and experi
enced. The now familiar cry "never
again" swelled in my heart, that pledge
of strength and survival choking me with
emotion. The Jewish Defense League
also played a role, literally providing a
backdrop for this event. Protesters with
signs stating that the Holocaust had
never happened were an unreal sight —
but I stared at their faces and they did
not look like the lunatic fringe. They
reminded me that it could happen again
— both with misguided, disturbed people
and with ordinary, good people who fail
to speak out because they are too busy or
too afraid to step out of their protected
little worlds.
The question keeps recurring: How
could so many people and so many coun
tries have allowed this to continue when
they knew what was happening? And
Elie Wiesel's question — why no one
bombed the railroad tracks to stop the
horror — still haunts me today. But I
could see how it begins: dismissing the
cranks because they are so small, disor
ganized, and obviously crazy; then failing
to fight subtle and not-so-subtle biases
and bigotry in our own hearts — dehu
manizing groups that we consider some

thing less than ourselves because they
are different.
When I finally forced my eyes from
the parade of speakers, each more rivet
ing than the last, I noticed how many gay
and lesbian couples were gathered there,
listening and watching. Many had come
to the city to participate in the gay and
lesbian rally later that weekend. But
many were there for the same reason I
was. We listened to every word, every
nuance and intonation. We held on to
every word as if it were precious and
holy. It seemed right that there were so
many gay couples present: as one speak
er pointed out, the Nazis found it fright
eningly easy to start the horrible process
with homosexuals because they were dif
ferent, outcasts, social deviants. They
were already treated in a dehumanizing
manner, making it easier to dismiss and
destroy them. Their presence was a gen
tle reminder that we need to guard
against all socially condoned bigotries.
As the survivors spoke, I thought of
my own family and friends. I thought
about the devastation I felt while
researching my family tree when I found
that an entire line had been wiped out in
a few years by the Nazis' systematic
genocide. The scale of it is difficult to
comprehend, even when it touches your
own family. I also thought about all the
survivors I have met throughout my life.
I remember as a child, leaning over and
asking my mother in synagogue what the
numbers meant — the numbers tattooed
on the arm of the woman sitting next to
me. I remembered the stories told night
after night by survivors on a kibbutz in
Israel. They were not proud stories,
many survivors were ashamed of what
they had to do to survive — but they
lived.
One survivor spoke about how he was
lined up with his brother in front of a
mass grave. The two boys were told they
could stay alive if they would be scav
engers and take valuables off the dead

bodies for the Nazis. The brother refused
and was shot; my kibbutz friend did
what he had to do to survive. Another
survivor tried to help me understand
why so few fought back. He told me how
one Nazi would leave an empty rifle
within reach of naked prisoners standing
in line en route to the gas chambers.
Inevitably someone would grab the rifle
and try to shoot the Nazis. They would
take the rifle away and tell the victim
that he or she was responsible for seeing
everyone else in line shot to death first
because of that one action. These mental
games did not compare with the insidi
ous acts of physical cruelty and torture,
of disfigurement and destruction.
When Edward R. Murrow said, "If
I've offended you by this rather mild
account of Buchenwald, I'm not in the
least sorry," I understood, and I believe
that the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Muse
um, Yad Vashem in Israel and the Holo
caust Center of Northern California
serve the same purpose. They describe
what happened without apology, as a
debt to the dead and a reminder to the
living that they must prevent such
things from ever happening again — to
any group.

manizing groups that we consider some

thing less than ourselves because they
are different.
When I finally forced my eyes from
the parade of speakers, each more rivet
ing than the last, I noticed how many gay
and lesbian couples were gathered there,
listening and watching. Many had come
to the city to participate in the gay and
lesbian rally later that weekend. But
many were there for the same reason I
was. We listened to every word, every
nuance and intonation. We held on to
every word as if it were precious and
holy. It seemed right that there were so
many gay couples present: as one speak
er pointed out, the Nazis found it fright
eningly easy to start the horrible process
with homosexuals because they were dif
ferent, outcasts, social deviants. They
were already treated in a dehumanizing
manner, making it easier to dismiss and
destroy them. Their presence was a gen
tle reminder that we need to guard
against all socially condoned bigotries.
As the survivors spoke, I thought of
my own family and friends. I thought
about the devastation I felt while
researching my family tree when I found
that an entire line had been wiped out in
a few years by the Nazis' systematic
genocide. The scale of it is difficult to
comprehend, even when it touches your
own family. I also thought about all the
survivors I have met throughout my life.
I remember as a child, leaning over and
asking my mother in synagogue what the
numbers meant — the numbers tattooed
on the arm of the woman sitting next to
me. I remembered the stories told night
after night by survivors on a kibbutz in
Israel. They were not proud stories,
many survivors were ashamed of what
they had to do to survive — but they
lived.
One survivor spoke about how he was
lined up with his brother in front of a
mass grave. The two boys were told they
could stay alive if they would be scav
engers and take valuables off the dead

bodies for the Nazis. The brother refused
and was shot; my kibbutz friend did
what he had to do to survive. Another
survivor tried to help me understand
why so few fought back. He told me how
one Nazi would leave an empty rifle
within reach of naked prisoners standing
in line en route to the gas chambers.
Inevitably someone would grab the rifle
and try to shoot the Nazis. They would
take the rifle away and tell the victim
that he or she was responsible for seeing
everyone else in line shot to death first
because of that one action. These mental
games did not compare with the insidi
ous acts of physical cruelty and torture,
of disfigurement and destruction.
When Edward R. Murrow said, "If
I've offended you by this rather mild
account of Buchenwald, I'm not in the
least sorry," I understood, and I believe
that the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Muse
um, Yad Vashem in Israel and the Holo
caust Center of Northern California
serve the same purpose. They describe
what happened without apology, as a
debt to the dead and a reminder to the
living that they must prevent such
things from ever happening again — to
any group.

AS A STUDENT of history, I have
some insight into how the Holo
caust began and what must be
done to ensure that it never happens
again. The first lesson, as Elie Weisel has
taught us, is to remember; the second is
to respond. In this context, I am
responding to Bradley Smith's virulent
and anti-Semitic message, particularly
his Revisionist View of the U.S. Holo
caust Memorial Museum. I also want to
applaud editors, like The Daily's Rajiv
Chandrasekaran, who understand the
danger associated with printing
untruths. I found his exploration into
this topic engaging and compelling. A
focal point of this dialogue is the U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Museum; since I
was present at the dedication of that
museum, I thought I would share my
thoughts and impressions about that
moment in history as a way of remem
bering and responding.
All of us who stood in the rain that
day were a part of histoiy: speakers,
prominent dignitaries, and each member
of the audience. The symbolism of Chaim
Herzog's presence was clear — as presi
dent of Israel he represented a country
expressly devoted to championing the
rights of and providing refuge for Jews.
The irony of Lech Walesa's presence was
also clear, coming only a few weeks after
the 50th anniversary of the Warsaw
Ghetto uprisings.
It was cold and wet, fitting that dark
period in modern civilization, but no one
moved during the dedication. The speak
ers stirred emotions ranging from sorrow
to defiance. Questions I had posed as a
child were echoed by the crowd: How
could this have happened? How can
there be a God if such things are possi
ble? How could so many people have
turned away knowing what they knew
about unspeakable atrocities, such inde
cencies of the hand and the heart? These
were the questions that were raised on
that day, questions I never expected to

hear raised in Washington, D.C. But that
bastion of politics and power is precisely
where these questions belonged. As Pres
ident Clinton said, "The Holocaust
reminds us forever that knowledge
divorced from values can only serve to
deepen the human nightmare, that a
head without a heart is not humanity."
There was no better place for such a
reminder than in our capital and at this
time in history when racial and ethnic
hatred are proliferating worldwide,
including ethnic cleansing in the former
Yugoslavia, racial segregation and vio
lence in South Africa, as well as the
oppression of the Kurds in Iraq and the
Baha'i in Iran.
There were also feelings of rage while
we listened to survivors and liberators
describe what they had seen and experi
enced. The now familiar cry "never
again" swelled in my heart, that pledge
of strength and survival choking me with
emotion. The Jewish Defense League
also played a role, literally providing a
backdrop for this event. Protesters with
signs stating that the Holocaust had
never happened were an unreal sight —
but I stared at their faces and they did
not look like the lunatic fringe. They
reminded me that it could happen again
— both with misguided, disturbed people
and with ordinary, good people who fail
to speak out because they are too busy or
too afraid to step out of their protected
little worlds.
The question keeps recurring: How
could so many people and so many coun
tries have allowed this to continue when
they knew what was happening? And
Elie Wiesel's question — why no one
bombed the railroad tracks to stop the
horror — still haunts me today. But I
could see how it begins: dismissing the
cranks because they are so small, disor
ganized, and obviously crazy; then failing
to fight subtle and not-so-subtle biases
and bigotry in our own hearts — dehu
manizing groups that we consider some

thing less than ourselves because they
are different.
