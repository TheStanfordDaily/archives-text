## GSA should take over grad students' affairs and correct fee system 
### 
As a graduate student who support
ed the Tea Party's efforts, I was
pleased by The Daily's coverage of the
refund process. I found the quote by
undergraduate Jason Colton of KZSU
very telling: "We're here to take
advantage of what the University has
to offer ... all these people are doing
is making a political statement."
I agree that undergraduates are
here to "take advantage" of all the
University has to offer â€” but the
same is simply not true for graduate
students. Many of us have little time
or inclination to fully participate in
the "Stanford Experience." The ASSU
needs to recognize that graduate stu
dents have different needs, interests
and priorities, and lumping us in with
the undergrads is simply unfair.
I hope Mr. Colton's attitude toward
the graduates making a "political state
ment" is not representative of under
graduates in general. He seems to be

saying, "The graduate students are
inconveniencing us; why don't they just
pay their money and shut up?"
Personally, that sounds like a
change from "taking advantage of the
University" to "taking advantage of
the graduate student body." And if
making political statements on college
campuses is wrong, where is it right?
I propose that the graduate stu
dents withdraw from the ASSU
entirely, with the GSA (or something
similar) taking over the equivalent
role for the graduate student body.
This way, the graduate student body
could chart its own course without
having to compete with the (more
involved) undergraduates.
This would allow the ASSU to make
more reasonable funding estimates for
organizations, since graduate students
account for the majority of refund
requests.
Finally, if organizations were
allowed to seek funding from both the
ASSU and the graduate student gov
ernment, this would directly force
organizations which wanted graduate
student funding to encourage gradu
ate student participation.
While it is unlikely that the gradu

ate student body is united on what we
believe should be done to correct the
fee system, I hope it is clear that we
do not approve of its present form.
