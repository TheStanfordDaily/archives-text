# Webb Ranch protesters should know the facts before assigning blame
## 
### 
The Daily's Oct. 25 editorial was cer
tainly accurate in calling the Webb Ranch
situation "an ethical dilemma." Perhaps
the students and faculty who have been
protesting the workers' treatment should
reread that editorial to remind them
selves that the situation is not as cut-and
dried as they seem to think it is. I find
their methods questionable.
According to Daily stories on Oct. 27
and 28, a group of students and faculty
want University President Gerhard
Casper to "take a stand" against Webb
Ranch management and to "investigate
the conditions" there.
Exactly how should the University
conduct such an investigation? Are the

protesters aware of the legal ramifica
tions, if any, that Casper (and hence the
University) would face by undertaking
such action? Instead of dismissing
Casper's refusal as "stonewalling" and
accusing the administration of "hiding
behind" legal issues, the protestors
should investigate those issues more
closely.
Casper was right when he said (Oct.
27) to the protestors, who "admitted that
they are not the workers' official repre
sentatives," that "the workers need to be
represented by whom they choose to rep
resent them." It is incredibly presumptu
ous of this group to "protest" on behalf of
people who, we can only conclude, were
not consulted about their desire or need
for such representation.
Unfortunately, the only peep we have
heard in The Daily from anyone who in
any way seems to represent these work
ers was a minuscule quote from Chris
Akerman of the United Stanford Work
ers (Oct. 28): "It's wrong. But what do
you do?" Well, it is my understanding
that the function of a union is to take
legal action when possible contract viola
tions have occurred.
Akerman's feeble response makes it
look like the union is either a) dragging its

feet, or b) needs all the help it can get.
Perhaps the protestors should spend their
time pressuring the Webb Ranch workers'
union to take action, or offering to help
the union's efforts, instead of planning to
march on Gerhard Casper's house!
Comments by Webb Ranch supervisor
Tom Hubbard (Oct. 28) were interesting.
He said he was "unaware of [their 1 con
cerns" and hence did not have "an under
standing of their point of view." Could
this be because, as he said, "the workers
have a new contract and they're all in
their new houses"? This leads me to won
der whether the "plight" of the Webb
Ranch workers has become a non-issue,
having boiled down to a simple breach of
contract.
All of this leads me to question the
protestors' grasp of the issues. How
much do they really know about the
workers' current situation? Do they real
ly think they will be helped by being put
out of their jobs? Perhaps they should
ask the workers how they feel about the
situation before presuming to speak for
them, and especially before staging any
"uprising" or claiming to act as a "moral
beacon."
