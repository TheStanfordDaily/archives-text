## Stolen credit card numbers used to buy Big Game tix 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
An Oakland man is facing charges of grand theft
and possession of a fraudulent credit card number
after scamming Stanford and UC-Berkeley ticket of
fices out of more than $5,000 worth of Big Game tick
ets.
After a two-week investigation, Stanford Police
apprehended Russell Edward Styles on Oct. 25 for
using a fraudulent credit card number to purchase
$1,344 worth of Big Game tickets from the Depart
ment of Athletics ticket office, according to Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer. Another man was arrested along
with Styles, but had to be released due to lack of evi
dence.
In addition, charges are expected to be filed today
against Styles, 33, for purchasing more than $4,000
worth of tickets in the same manner from UC-Berke
ley's ticket office.
The first purchase Styles allegedly made at Stan

ford was on Oct. 12, Niemeyer said. Styles reportedly
purchased 12 Big Game tickets by phone, at $32 each,
with another person's name and credit card number.
He then told the ticket office to hold the tickets for
pick-up by Russell Styles, who he said was his son.
Police suspect he then picked up the tickets he had or
dered.
Styles allegedly made another purchase on Oct.
18, ordering 30 Big Game tickets with the same cred
it card and making the same arrangements for pick
up.
Another man, who police suspect was the same
person who was with Styles at the time of the arrest,
then called the ticket office and had the tickets sent to
an Oakland address.
After the second purchase, police received a report
from the real owner of the credit card, who com
plained that the card was being used without his per
mission. On Oct. 23, when the suspect called to pur-
chase tickets again, Stanford
Police Sgt. Rick Enberg, who led
the investigation, went to the
ticket office to wait for Styles,
but he never showed.
The suspect was finally
caught when, on Oct. 25, the
ticket office reported that Styles
and another man were there to
pick up tickets. Enberg and Lt.
Del Bandy intercepted the two
men as they were leaving and
arrested them.
The owner of the credit card
identified the two men as
acquaintances, and said he sus
pected that they got his card
number while at his house for a
party, Niemeyer said.
UC-Berkeley Police Detective
Kristine Milani said she expected
Styles would be formally charged
today for the fraudulent pur
chases from the UC-Berkeley
ticket office.
"He did the exact same thing
at Cal as he did at Stanford,"
Milani said.
Stanford's ticket office is
planning to re-issue tickets to
replace the stolen ones, Niemey
er said. The stolen tickets, which
are still outstanding, will not be
accepted.
Students should be wary of
scalpers selling stolen tickets,
Niemeyer said. The tickets pur
chased by Styles from the Stan
ford ticket office were located in
section AA, row 1, seats 1 to 10;
section AA, row 2, seats 1 to 20;
and in section T, row 1, seats 11 to
22.
