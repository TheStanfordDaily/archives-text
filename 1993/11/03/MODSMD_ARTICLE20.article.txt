## Rare corn yields 'jumping' DNA Maize from indigenous Mexican plant contains special genes 
### Steve Bait 
This fall, Stanford biologists are
proving that "the Farm" may be
more than just a fond historical nick
name for the University campus.
On the outskirts of campus near
Stock Farm Road, Biological Sciences
Prof. Virginia Walbot and her stu
dents have been growing and harvest
ing corn.
But not just any corn. These
researchers have been working with a
strain of Mexican corn that grows 12
to 15 feet tall and contains a certain
piece of DNA that can jump into or
out of an organism's normal chromo
some during its development.
Zapalote chico is a strain of maize
cultivated for the past 3,000 years by
the Zapotec Indians in Oaxaca in the
southern part of Mexico.
It serves as a staple of the Zapotec
diet — in particular, in their corn
meal "masa" and "totopos," the
starchy crackers which are made
from it.
While different varieties of corn
contain "Mutator," a family of
"jumping genes," Zapalote chico is
the only naturally occuring strain of
maize that is known to contain the
"master" Mutator element identified
by Walbot's lab in 1991, called
MuDR.
Walbot's research group is trying
to map out the sequence of MuDR
and find out why MuDR appears to be
silenced in Zapalote chico corn.
And last week, they harvested a
plot of corn to conduct experiments
designed to probe the regulation of
Mutator.
Mutator is highly active. "It's this
rampant thing that jumps around,"
said graduate student Maria-Ines
Benito.
But this unique feature may allow
plant geneticists to use the Mutator
system in other species.
Such efforts, for instance, could
identify specimens in which an
important gene is faulty, by inserting
a Mu element.
Mutator, or Mu, elements are

examples of "transposable elements"
— also known as "transposons" —
which are pieces of DNA that can
jump into or out of an organism's
normal chromosomes during its
development.
When transposons are introduced
into host DNA, the function of the
proteins encoded by that DNA may be
disrupted.
The results of this interruption
can be easily visible on a single ker
nel, which is essentially a large mass
of maize cells.
For instance, cells which retain
the transposon in a purple pigment
gene will be beige, while cells in
which the transposon has been
excised will show purple spots.
A handful of Mu transposons in
the Mutator family have been identi
fied in maize.
MuDR, the "master" Mu element,
can direct the insertion and removal
of other Mu transposons in the family.
But while Mu elements have great
potential for plant geneticists, scien
tists have met with little success in
their attempts to introduce MuDR
into other species.
Benito expects to overcome some
of these barriers by studying the nat
ural regulation of MuDR expression.
"If we understand its regulation and
how it works, [Mutator] is a more
useful tool," she explained.
To this end, Walbot and Benito are
currently mapping the sequence of
MuDR.
Walbot said she hopes the result
will be "a Rosetta stone to match the
proteins [encoded by the transpo
son] with the functions they carry
out."
In addition to the molecular analy
sis, Walbot hopes to use genetic
experiments with Zapalote chico to
discover how a naturally occurring
plant species regulates MuDR.
Zapalote chico, however, does not
exhibit high Mutator activity, which
may explain its use as a crop plant.
Walbot is trying to find out why
MuDR appears to be silenced in
Zapalote chico.

Walbot likens the transposons to
"a genetic wild card": when the plant
is stressed, the transposon becomes
functional and plant diversity is ele
vated, allowing some plants to over
come the environmental pressure.
When the plants are sick, Mutator
appears to be very active, Benito
explained.
How, then, can its expression be
studied?
As an initial step, Walbot plans to
perform genetic crosses between
native Zapalote chico and other vari
eties of corn to observe whether
Zapalote's MuDR element influences
the expression of genes from other
species.
In the corn field, her "big laborato
ry room," the first parental stocks for
this year's experiments have been
harvested.
The first set of crosses will be per
formed this winter, on the Hawaiian
island of Molokai.
