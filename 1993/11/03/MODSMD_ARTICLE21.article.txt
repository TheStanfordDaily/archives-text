# Holograms to revolutionize info storage
## Fiber optics transmit directly into crystals 
### Christian Chabot 
Did you know that tiny green holograms,
about the size of those on your credit card, have
over 10,000 times the information-storage poten
tial of your average Macintosh?
But don't shove your Visa card into the near
est Mac Classic just yet. These holograms are
much different than those you see on many
charge cards, even though they're "recorded" in
much the same way.
They are the result of current research into
the new field of "holographic data storage," led
by Electrical Engineering Prof. Lambertus Hes
selink and his group, and they may shape the
future of information storage in computers.
"Our appetite for storing, retrieving, and
transmitting large amounts of data appears to
grow exponentially," Hesse link said.
In recent years, fiberoptic networks have been
developed to better cope with these enormous
information transmission demands, but they rely
on inefficient methods that convert electronic
signals (from a sending computer) to light waves
(to be transmitted over fiberoptic cables), back to
electronic signals (for the receiving computer).
Holographic data storage, which uses laser
light to record data in photo-refractive materials,
reduces the need for conversion processes
because it uses bandwidths that are compatible
with fiberoptic networks.
In theory, the technology can allow transfer
rates 100 to 1,000 times faster than those avail
able with current disk drives.
Storing information in crystals
The tiny holograms, which can theoretically
hold a trillion bits of information per cubic cen
timeter, are formed by shining two laser beams
on photo-refractive storage crystals, such as
strontium barium niobate.
The first laser beam passes through a
checkerboard-patterned spatial light modulator
(SLM), which is similar to the liquid crystal dis

plays (LCDs) on digital watches.
Instead of numbers, however, the SLM dis
plays a pattern made up of black squares and
transparent spaces. These patterns symbolize
the numbers one and zero, and represent the
information to be stored in the crystal.
Because the black squares are opaque, the
modulator allows only the laser light that hits the
transparent squares to pass through.
This light beam combines with a second laser
known as the "reference beam," and then con
tinues on to bathe the photo-refractive storage
material behind the modulator in a correspond
ing checkerboard pattern.
The two beams come together to form an
interference pattern which strikes the crystal
and stimulates the electrons of each individual
atom within. As photons of the laser light are
absorbed by the individual atoms, "excited" elec
trons are produced, which then move to the dark
areas in the interference pattern where they are
no longer stimulated.
As they become less excited, they become
attracted to local protons and get trapped in the
material. When the incoming lasers are shut off,
the electrons remain "clumped" in certain areas
of the crystal.
A relatively strong electric field results from

such tightly packed electric charges, and this field
changes the index of refraction of the packed
areas.
As a result, if a laser beam was shone through
the crystal at a later date, deviations would be
seen in the way light is refracted in the crystal.
One would be able to see the ones and zeros
that constitute data storage represented by the
varying degrees of electron concentration.
Future uses
Ultimately, this relatively nascent technology
could greatly transform information storage in
computers.
Holographic data storage is superior to exist
ing storage methods because it combines huge
memory capacities with speedy transfer rates.
This advancement could lead to numerous inno
vations in the future: "dialing up movies" from
central storage computers for home viewing may
be possible, multi-media applications may be
improved, and complex NASA images may be
relayed from deep space with greater speed and
accuracy.
In addition, because holograms can be
retrieved with only limited information, comput-

ers may be able to retrieve, for
example, the correct picture of a
person if only half of the face is
given as input.
Provided it becomes cost effec
tive, Dr. Hesselink believes the tech
nology would initially be used in
hard drives, and doesn't think any
"mqjor shift in the structure of com
puters" would be necessary to

accommodate holographic data
storage.
Hypothetically, small, depend
able lasers could be put in personal
computers and used to produce
information-packed holograms.
And, if current problems with
the technology can be worked out,
holograms may even be used to
read and write onto portable
disks.
Because it has such potential in
both military and commercial appli
cations, research on holographic
data storage is also attracting atten

tion from the government.
According to Donna Baranski-
Walker, a licensing associate at
Stanford's Office of Technology
Licensing, the Advanced Projects
Research Agency (ARPA) "has
recently put up $22 million for
research in this area."
The primary reason for the
increased funding is to develop the
most essential component of holo
graphic data storage — the "photo
refractive crystal" — which holds
the checkerboard image of the spa
tial light modulator.
