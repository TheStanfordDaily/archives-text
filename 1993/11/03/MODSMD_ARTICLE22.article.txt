# Smoke-free campus has clinical support

Joining a growing number of
institutions across the country
choosing to go smoke-free, Stan
ford recently enacted its own ban
on smoking in most areas on cam
pus.
Two weeks ago, a ban on smok
ing in all enclosed buildings and
at University-sponsored events
went into effect. By next Septem
ber, the ban will extend to the sale
of all tobacco products on cam
pus.
The campus smoking policy
was revised partly because of
increased knowledge on second
hand smoke, said Tom Matteoli,

director of employee relations and
development before the policy
went into effect.
Environmental tobacco smoke
(ETS) or secondhand smoke has
been shown to be potentially as
dangerous as inhaling cigarette
smoke itself, and has been recog
nized as a "known humuan car
cinogen" by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA).
The American Medical Associ
ation has also declared second
hand smoke a "Class A carcino
gen," a classification that
includes chemicals like formalde
hyde and benzene. According to
Dr. David Altman of the AMA, a
Class A rating is "pretty serious

stuff."
However, an understading of
how smoke causes cancer at the
molecular level has yet to be
reached.
"Nobody knows what it does to
the DNA. . . . [There arel a great
many theories about breakage in
links of DNA," said Dr. Thomas
Houston of the AMA. "[We] don't
know precisely what causes the
cell to turn on the switch that
makes it grow out of control....
[it just] eats up a whole lung or
kidney. That's what cancer is â€” a
cell gone out of whack with
growth."
According to Dr. Mark Becker
of the Radiation Oncology

Department at Stanford Medical
Center, the difference between
actually knowing and only sus
pecting deleterious effects is quite
significant. There is a "fine line,
but it's kind of important. .. .
that's what tobacco companies
emphasize."
Tobacco companies are among
those who believe the dangers of
secondhand smoke are highly
exaggerated. And an editorial in
the National Review has claimed
that smoking's impact is "no dif
ferent than that from cooking and
heating flames."
