# Science of Vibrations': Harmonics conflict synthesized by Bug

/'"V Why is it that two different
ICY sounds are heard, even
though the same note is played
on each instrument?
— Been Wondering for a While
A: Musical sounds, like all
sounds, are created by forc
ing air to vibrate. This vibra
tion can be driven by the oscil
lation of a string (as in the gui
tar, violin and piano), an air col
umn (as in the oboe or flute) or
a steel or wooden block (as in
the xylophone and marimba).
The oscillation of an instru
ment's vibrating parts (which, we
will refer to as "resonators"
rather than "vibrators" for obvi
ous reasons) create a compres
sional wave in the surrounding
atmosphere. This wave impinges
upon human ears and is inter
preted as musical sound.
A musical resonator can't pro
duce just any sound. Rather, the
sound it produces must be of a
frequency corresponding to the
allowed standing wave frequen
cies for that resonator.
Mathematically, a standing
wave is essentially a pair of waves
travelling in opposite directions
through a medium bounded at
one or both ends.
To get a visceral grip on stand
ing waves, imagine two small chil
dren swinging a jump rope
between them. The rope appears
to sweep out a football-shaped
chunk of space. If they increase
the speed with which they turn
the rope, the football will split
into two footballs of identical size.
A spot exactly in the middle of the
rope isn't moving at all; this point
is called a node. If they drive the
rope even more rapidly, the two
footballs will appear to split into
three, with nodes evenly placed
one-third and two-thirds of the
way down the rope's length.
The take-home lesson here is
that you will never see half a foot
ball, or two-and-a-quarter, or
3.14159.... The allowed stand
ing wave frequencies are limited,
in this case by the distance
between the two children's
hands.
Standing wave frequency for a
resonator varies proportionally
with tension and inversely with

the length (which is why one of
those big wonkin' Notre Dame
organ pipes produces a lower note
than a flute).
Like the jump rope, the res
onators in musical instruments
can vibrate at multiple frequen
cies. The lowest possible frequen
cy is called the "fundamental" or
"first harmonic."
Since the fundamental fre
quency is the one that most lis
teners will remember, it is gener
ally considered the pitch of a note.
When you strike the A above mid
dle C on a piano, the string which
is struck in turn vibrates 440
times per second. Its frequency is
said to be 440 Hertz, and so is the
pitch of the note.
Go back to my delightful jump
rope analogy. Not only does a
given note vibrate with its funda
mental frequency (the single foot
ball), but also — added on top, if
you will — with higher frequen
cies that are related to the funda
mental in a simple way: their fre
quencies are integral multiples of
the fundamental. So, A above
middle C has a fundamental fre
quency of 440 Hz, but there are
also components at 880 I Iz, 1320
Hz and so forth.
The basic difference between
notes is the relationship between
the intensities of the first and
higher harmonics.
The higher harmonics of a
note played on a flute, for exam
ple, are much lower in intensity
than the fundamental; listeners
hear a pure and innocent tone.
The same note on a saxophone,
however, has a few harmonics
which rival the frequency of the
fundamental, and you get an
entirely different sound —
rougher, brassier and (compared
to the flute) a bit adulterated.
