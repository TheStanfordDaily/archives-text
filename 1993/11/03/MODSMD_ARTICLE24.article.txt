## Bombs away! Cardinal nukes Golden Bears 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
Not only did the Stanford women's
volleyball team rack up another Pacif
ic 10 Conference victory, it also com
pleted one of any Stanford student's
favorite activities — creaming the
Weenies.
In the second Big Match of the sea
son, the sixth-ranked Cardinal (17-5,
10-4 in the Pac-10) shut down Califor
nia (10-13, 3-11 in the Pac-10) in three
games — 15-6, 15-8, 15-8 — last nig
ht in Maples Pavilion.
"I felt that at times we did a real
good job, especially offensively," said
coach Don Shaw. "We were able to
wait long enough until we got our
opportunities to score some easier
points — sometimes that's what you
have to do."
The Cardinal started out strong in
game one against a Cal attack plagued
by hitting errors. Powered by sopho
more outside hitter Marnie Triefen
bach, Stanford surged out to an early 6-
1 lead.
Over the course of the game, both
Triefenbach and senior outside hitter
Heidi Eick were the victors of heated
jousts at the net, eventually boosting
Stanford to a 15-6 win.
"I thought we were pretty smooth,"
said senior tri-captain Piper Hahn.
"We sided out really consistently —
that was something we had been a lit
tle sporadic about. We're finally com
ing around in that aspect of the
game."
The challenge proved much tougher
in game two as Cal turned up its defen
sive effort. The Bears, led by middle
blocker Cara Dane, stuck with the
Cardinal for the first half of the game

for an even score of 8-8. At this point,
Stanford managed to spread out its
offensive attack to score seven
straight points for a 15-8 second-game
win.
Hahn attributed Stanford's early
second-game troubles to a slow defen
sive reaction.
"They threw in a lot of off-speed
shots and tips," Hahn said. "We didn't
make an adjustment to our defense
until after the second game, plus they
came out stronger in the second
game."
Engaged in an intense rivalry, the
Bears were not willing to let the match
go, despite a two-game deficit. Display
ing a greatly improved defensive effort
from the earlier games, Cal managed
to hold an early lead before the Cardi
nal evened the score at 5-5.
"We seemed sluggish defensively,"
Shaw said. "For one, when they got a
good pass and Cara Dane was in the
front row, she was tough to stop. For
tunately for us, we served tough
enough so they couldn't get the ball
where they wanted."
Despite Cal middle blocker Jill
Schneider's strong effort at the net,
the Cardinal offense stayed one step
ahead of the Cal defense. Playing off
Hahn's quick set, Anne Wicks swung
for the kill that pulled Stanford ahead
of the Bears. While Dane's smashes
sailed through to penetrate the Cardi
nal blocks on numerous occasions,
Stanford proved unstoppable for the
remainder of the game, securing a 15-
8 victory.
"We did a good job of siding out, but
the games really lasted a lot longer
than the scores indicate," Shaw said.
"If you look at the scores it looks like a
rout, but in games two and three they

stayed close to us for quite a while."
For an offense which is frequently
marred by a high number of hitting
errors, the Cardinal put together an
exceptionally good match. Triefenbach
led the effort with 17 kills, with one
attack error, for a .518 hitting per
centage, while Gary Wendell swung for
a team-high .609 hitting percentage
with 16 kills and two errors. Both
Maureen McLaren and Wicks made
further contributions with six and
seven kills, respectively.
The Cardinal kept the Bears to a
.208 hitting percentage, but the Cal
offense still managed to rack up its
share of kills. Dane came through for a
.323 mark with 15 kills, while outside
hitter Shaney Fink also registered 15
kills for a .242 hitting percentage.
Schneider rounded out the Cal offense
with 13 kills.
For a team working on playing con
sistently, tonight's match proved a
positive indication of an increasingly
steady attack.
"We still have our moments where
we really do some bonehead plays,"
Wicks said. "We were able to play well
for three games again, though —
that's what we want to keep doing."
With more than a week until its
next match, Stanford will have an
opportunity to rest and prepare for its
last four Pac-10 matches, including
contests against first-place UCLA and
second-place USC. Just beating Cal,
however, is good enough for now.
"Every year we play them, they
always give us a good fight," Hahn
said. "I don't know if it's because of
the rivalry or whatever, but in years
past they've usually gotten a game off
us — it was nice to just sweep them in
three."

always give us a good fight," Hahn
said. "I don't know if it's because of
the rivalry or whatever, but in years
past they've usually gotten a game off
us — it was nice to just sweep them in
three."

night's win over California, Stanford will take on Oregon and OSU Nov. 12-13.
Not only did the Stanford women's
volleyball team rack up another Pacif
ic 10 Conference victory, it also com
pleted one of any Stanford student's
favorite activities — creaming the
Weenies.
In the second Big Match of the sea
son, the sixth-ranked Cardinal (17-5,
10-4 in the Pac-10) shut down Califor
nia (10-13, 3-11 in the Pac-10) in three
games — 15-6, 15-8, 15-8 — last nig
ht in Maples Pavilion.
"I felt that at times we did a real
good job, especially offensively," said
coach Don Shaw. "We were able to
wait long enough until we got our
opportunities to score some easier
points — sometimes that's what you
have to do."
The Cardinal started out strong in
game one against a Cal attack plagued
by hitting errors. Powered by sopho
more outside hitter Marnie Triefen
bach, Stanford surged out to an early 6-
1 lead.
Over the course of the game, both
Triefenbach and senior outside hitter
Heidi Eick were the victors of heated
jousts at the net, eventually boosting
Stanford to a 15-6 win.
"I thought we were pretty smooth,"
said senior tri-captain Piper Hahn.
"We sided out really consistently —
that was something we had been a lit
tle sporadic about. We're finally com
ing around in that aspect of the
game."
The challenge proved much tougher
in game two as Cal turned up its defen
sive effort. The Bears, led by middle
blocker Cara Dane, stuck with the
Cardinal for the first half of the game

for an even score of 8-8. At this point,
Stanford managed to spread out its
offensive attack to score seven
straight points for a 15-8 second-game
win.
Hahn attributed Stanford's early
second-game troubles to a slow defen
sive reaction.
"They threw in a lot of off-speed
shots and tips," Hahn said. "We didn't
make an adjustment to our defense
until after the second game, plus they
came out stronger in the second
game."
Engaged in an intense rivalry, the
Bears were not willing to let the match
go, despite a two-game deficit. Display
ing a greatly improved defensive effort
from the earlier games, Cal managed
to hold an early lead before the Cardi
nal evened the score at 5-5.
"We seemed sluggish defensively,"
Shaw said. "For one, when they got a
good pass and Cara Dane was in the
front row, she was tough to stop. For
tunately for us, we served tough
enough so they couldn't get the ball
where they wanted."
Despite Cal middle blocker Jill
Schneider's strong effort at the net,
the Cardinal offense stayed one step
ahead of the Cal defense. Playing off
Hahn's quick set, Anne Wicks swung
for the kill that pulled Stanford ahead
of the Bears. While Dane's smashes
sailed through to penetrate the Cardi
nal blocks on numerous occasions,
Stanford proved unstoppable for the
remainder of the game, securing a 15-
8 victory.
"We did a good job of siding out, but
the games really lasted a lot longer
than the scores indicate," Shaw said.
"If you look at the scores it looks like a
rout, but in games two and three they

stayed close to us for quite a while."
For an offense which is frequently
marred by a high number of hitting
errors, the Cardinal put together an
exceptionally good match. Triefenbach
led the effort with 17 kills, with one
attack error, for a .518 hitting per
centage, while Gary Wendell swung for
a team-high .609 hitting percentage
with 16 kills and two errors. Both
Maureen McLaren and Wicks made
further contributions with six and
seven kills, respectively.
The Cardinal kept the Bears to a
.208 hitting percentage, but the Cal
offense still managed to rack up its
share of kills. Dane came through for a
.323 mark with 15 kills, while outside
hitter Shaney Fink also registered 15
kills for a .242 hitting percentage.
Schneider rounded out the Cal offense
with 13 kills.
For a team working on playing con
sistently, tonight's match proved a
positive indication of an increasingly
steady attack.
"We still have our moments where
we really do some bonehead plays,"
Wicks said. "We were able to play well
for three games again, though —
that's what we want to keep doing."
With more than a week until its
next match, Stanford will have an
opportunity to rest and prepare for its
last four Pac-10 matches, including
contests against first-place UCLA and
second-place USC. Just beating Cal,
however, is good enough for now.
"Every year we play them, they
always give us a good fight," Hahn
said. "I don't know if it's because of
the rivalry or whatever, but in years
past they've usually gotten a game off
us — it was nice to just sweep them in
three."
