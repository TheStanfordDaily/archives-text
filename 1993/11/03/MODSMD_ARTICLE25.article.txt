# Cardinal football to test Trojans' strength
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Riding the momentum of its
first Pacific 10 Conference win,
the Stanford football team will try
to make it two straight when it
ventures south this weekend for a
battle with USC at the Los Ange
les Coliseum in a game that will
likely have bowl implications for
both teams.
Stanford (3-5, 1-4 in the Pac
-10) must win each of its remaining
three games to stay in the postsea
son hunt. Following Saturday's
game against the Trojans, the Car
dinal would need wins over Ore
gon and California to keep its sea
son going.
"The potential is there, if we
somehow win three games against
three top teams," said Stanford
head coach Bill Walsh. "We've
played well enough this year to
beat all three of these teams, but
we've also been unable to win
some of the big games. The UCLA,
Arizona and Arizona State games
were all within reach. If we sud
denly were to eliminate the many
grievous mistakes we've made,
we'll be competitive."
USC (5-4, 4-1), on the other
hand, currently stands in a three
way tie for first place in the league
and cannot afford another loss if it
wishes to play in the Rose Bowl.
The Trojans need victories in their
final three games, plus another loss
or tie by Arizona, in order to spend
New Year's Day in Pasadena.
"We're still alive with a chance
at the Rose Bowl," said USC head
coach John Robinson. "It's been
very much of an up-and-down year
for us."
As it has been for the Cardinal.
Both Stanford and USC have
played some of the toughest sched

ules in the country. In terms of
quality of opponents, Stanford's
schedule is ranked third in diffi
culty by the NCAA, while USC's
ledger ranks fourth.
The game will feature the head-to
head competition of two of the
nation's outstanding quarterbacks.
Stanford's Steve Stenstrom and
USC's Rob Johnson were teammates
at Ell Toro High School in Orange
County, Calif.; in fact, in 1989, Sten
strom's senior year, Johnson was his
favorite target at wide receiver. Cur
rently, Stenstrom ranks fifth nation
ally in total offense, while Johnson
rates 11th nationally in pissing effi
ciency.
"The game will be wide open,"
Walsh said. "I'm hoping the score
will be close, because one way or
the other, both teams will throw
the ball effectively."
The Trojans' primary receiving
threat is senior Johnnie Morton. A
player with great speed, Morton
has recorded 180 receptions in his
career thus far — the most ever
for a Pac-10 wide receiver.
"He's as good a man as I've
been around in catching the ball,"
Robinson said.
While both teams are very pro
ficient with the pass, Saturday's
contest could turn on which team
is most effective in running the
ball. USC and Stanford rank ninth
and 10th in the Pac-10, respective
ly, in rushing offense.
"I've seen some things in the
past couple weeks that look
promising," said Stanford fullback
Ethan Allen. "Hopefully, we'll be
able to run when we need to."
An interesting sideshow for
this weekend's showdown is the
coaching matchup between Walsh
and Robinson. A year ago, Walsh
returned to coaching for a second
tour of duty at Stanford. This
summer, Robinson was rehired at
his old college stomping grounds
at USC. The last time the two
leaders met was in 1988, when
Walsh was at the helm of the San
Francisco 49ers and Robinson
directed the Los Angeles Rams.
Robinson's Rams won, 38-16.
Now, the two will meet again, on
exactly the same date of their first
encounter on the sidelines as col
lege coaches — with the same
schools — in 1977.
"I really didn't expect to coach
again, period, and I'm sure there
was a period of time in his life
when he did not expect to coach
again at the college level," Walsh
said. "But if he ever were to
return, it would only have been at
USC, and in my case it would only
have been at Stanford. In a sense,
we both stand for the same kinds
of things ... I'm a big admirer of
his."
"Well, as I've always said, Bill's
like a father figure to me, and I
hope when I'm as old as he is I'm
still coaching," Robinson quipped.
The Cardinal built up a big lead

last week against Oregon State and
was able to hold on for a 31-27 win.
USC, in contrast, was unrelenting
in a 42-14 shellacking of Cal. Walsh
feels that the Cardinal will not be
as fortunate if it has such a let
down again against the Trojans.
"We're going to have to change

up, we're going to have to depend
heavily on the blitz on occasion,
and we're going to have to be at our
very best," Walsh said. "We have to
concede 300 yards passing to the
Trojans. The key will be whether
they make the big plays and score
with them."
