# Seven straight without a loss
## Soccer scores OT victory over Gaels, 3-2 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
It was a game that meant noth
ing in the standings, but eveiy
thing to the team.
The Stanford men's soccer
squad defeated St. Mary's in over
time yesterday, 3-2, and the win
was a tasty morsel for a team that
is building momentum like a loco
motive. But the Cardinal (8-8-2),
which has not lost a game in its
last seven matches, still has a bit
tersweet taste in its mouth going
into league playoffs on Friday.
"What was important was how
well we played," said junior mid

fielder Ryan Collins, who scored
Stanford's two goals in regula
tion. "We stooped down to the
level of our competition, and we
didn't play as well as we would
have liked to."
Another victory under its belt
just was not enough for the Cardi
nal. The team faces sixth-ranked
UCLA Friday in the first round of
the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration playoffs in Los Angeles,
and Stanford's performance
against the mediocre Gaels (6-11-
0) was not good preparation for
the challenge they will face
against the Bruins.
"We will approach the UCLA

game differently than we ap
proached this one," said coach
Colin Lin do res. "This team has
done some strange things this sea
son. Who knows how they're
going to respond. That's the beau
ty of the college amateur sport."
Stanford started strongly
against St. Mary's. Collins scored
the game's first tally on a pass
from Chet Zimmer 17 minutes
into the contest, and the Cardinal
held off the Gaels to keep a 1-0
lead at the end of the first half.
The coaching staff started the
same lineup as in games past in
the contest, but eventually some
younger players were brought in

to give some playing time to the
inexperienced athletes.
"We played well the first half,"
said Lindores. "It looked like we
were playing decent for a while.
Unfortunately, our whole ap
proach was very [laid back]."
In the second half Stanford
took control once again, and the
Cardinal went up 2-0 after Collins
scored again on an assist from for
ward Rick Goad.
Unfortunately, the shutout
inspired bliss did not last long. St.
Mary's scored only a minute later
when Matt Pierovich put the ball
