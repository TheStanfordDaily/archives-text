# Hoopsters aim to rebound from dismal year
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Trying to rebound from last
year's disastrous 7-23 season, the
Stanford men's basketball team
opened practice this week with a
cast of new players and a feeling of
"cautious optimism."
"I'm not going to make any bold
statements about anything based
on where we have been the last
year," said head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "I think I'm going to
approach this thing with a low-key
approach and challenge our guys to
improve in every aspect of the
game, which I think we can do and
I think we will do.
"We can't afford to have the
types of injury problems that we
had last year," he said.
The Cardinal, which managed
only two wins in the Pacific 10 Con
ference last year, enters the 1993-
94 season with a relatively experi
enced nucleus surrounded by a
number of question marks. In fact,
only six of the 12 players now on
the squad were practicing and play
ing with the team last year.
"To me it's a little like starting
from scratch," Montgomery said.
"It's like coming in and redoing
everything and reemphasizing all of
the things you have to do to win
games, because we didn't do any
thing well enough last year to allow
us to win games."
The Cardinal's most immediate
concern is finding a replacement for
point guard Marcus Lollie, who
graduated after starting for two
seasons. The two candidates vying
for the position are junior Frank
Harris and freshman Brevin
Knight.
Harris is a transfer from Con
nors State Junior College in Warn
er, Okla. — only the second Cardi
nal junior-college transfer since
Montgomery came to the Farm in
1986 (the other was guard Kenny
Ammann). After averaging 20.1
points and 7.3 assists per game for
Connors State, Harris was named a

First Team Junior College All-
American last season by Future
Stars magazine.
Knight, who is from East
Orange, N.J., led Seton Hall Prep to
the state parochial high-school
championship last year, and coach
es suggest that his tremendous
quickness will be a major asset for
the team.
"Both Frank and Brevin are nat
ural point guards and are used to
leading clubs, and I think that
because they're not exactly coming

into an established situation, they
should be able to adjust well,"
Montgomery said. "We really feel
comfortable (that) with these two
kids along with (junior) Warren
Gravely that the position is well
taken care of."
Even if the two new recruits
combine to fill the hole at point
guard, the Cardinal still needs to
find a healthy combination of big
men.
Although Montgomery said that
no one on the team earned the right

to be named an automatic starter
based upon the team's performance
last season, sophomore Darren Ail
away and 6-foot-11-inch senior Jim
Morgan are almost sure to start at
power forward and center, respec
tively.
Morgan has recovered from the
herniated disk that hobbled him
throughout last year, and Alia way,
whose effectiveness was cut short
toward the end of the season with a
