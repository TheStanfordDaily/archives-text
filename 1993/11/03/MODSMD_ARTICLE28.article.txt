# Hoopsters aim to rebound from dismal year
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Trying to rebound from last
year's disastrous 7-23 season, the
Stanford men's basketball team
opened practice this week with a
cast of new players and a feeling of
"cautious optimism."
"I'm not going to make any bold
statements about anything based
on where we have been the last
year," said head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "I think I'm going to
approach this thing with a low-key
approach and challenge our guys to
improve in every aspect of the
game, which I think we can do and
I think we will do.
"We can't afford to have the
types of injury problems that we
had last year," he said.
The Cardinal, which managed
only two wins in the Pacific 10 Con
ference last year, enters the 1993-
94 season with a relatively experi
enced nucleus surrounded by a
number of question marks. In fact,
only six of the 12 players now on
the squad were practicing and play
ing with the team last year.
"To me it's a little like starting
from scratch," Montgomery said.
"It's like coming in and redoing
everything and reemphasizing all of
the things you have to do to win
games, because we didn't do any
thing well enough last year to allow
us to win games."
The Cardinal's most immediate
concern is finding a replacement for
point guard Marcus Lollie, who
graduated after starting for two
seasons. The two candidates vying
for the position are junior Frank
Harris and freshman Brevin
Knight.
Harris is a transfer from Con
nors State Junior College in Warn
er, Okla. — only the second Cardi
nal junior-college transfer since
Montgomery came to the Farm in
1986 (the other was guard Kenny
Ammann). After averaging 20.1
points and 7.3 assists per game for
Connors State, Harris was named a

First Team Junior College All-
American last season by Future
Stars magazine.
Knight, who is from East
Orange, N.J., led Seton Hall Prep to
the state parochial high-school
championship last year, and coach
es suggest that his tremendous
quickness will be a major asset for
the team.
"Both Frank and Brevin are nat
ural point guards and are used to
leading clubs, and I think that
because they're not exactly coming

into an established situation, they
should be able to adjust well,"
Montgomery said. "We really feel
comfortable (that) with these two
kids along with (junior) Warren
Gravely that the position is well
taken care of."
Even if the two new recruits
combine to fill the hole at point
guard, the Cardinal still needs to
find a healthy combination of big
men.
Although Montgomery said that
no one on the team earned the right

to be named an automatic starter
based upon the team's performance
last season, sophomore Darren Ail
away and 6-foot-11-inch senior Jim
Morgan are almost sure to start at
power forward and center, respec
tively.
Morgan has recovered from the
herniated disk that hobbled him
throughout last year, and Alia way,
whose effectiveness was cut short
toward the end of the season with a

sprained ankle, is back with added

English Junior National Team dur
ing the summer.
Juniors Bart Lammersen and
Todd Manley will provide solid front
line help off the bench. Montgomery
acknowledged that the significant
number of minutes Lammersen and
Manley played last season was "a sit
uation they shouldn't have had to
have been put in that early," but he
said he believes both made great
strides over the course of the year.
Forward Andy Poppink, a junior,
returns to the team after sitting out
last season with a bad back, and
junior Justin Armour, also a starting
wide receiver for the football team,

will provide some backup muscle.
The most solid areas for the Car
dinal are at the small forward and off
guard positions. Montgomery is
counting on fifth-year senior small
forward Brent Williams and sopho
more shooting guard Dion Cross to
provide the bulk of the scoring.
Williams led the team in scoring
and rebounding last year with 13.2
points and 5.8 rebounds per game,
but he needs to improve on his 41.5
percent shooting average.
Cross, meanwhile, emerged as the
team's most consistent scoring threat
in the latter half of the 1992-93 sea
son, averaging 15.2 points in the 11
games he started. After being named
to the All-Pac-10 Freshman First
Team last year, Cross has been select
ed as a preseason Honorable Mention
All-American by at least one publica
tion this fall.
Coming off the bench for Williams

and Cross will be junior David Har
bour, who missed all of last season
after undergoing surgery to repair a
seriously injured right thumb, and
20-year-old freshman Rich Jackson,
who has spent the past two years on
a Mormon mission in New Zealand.
After two and one-half weeks of
practice, the Cardinal will start with a
home exhibition against the Blue and
Gold Fleet on Nov. 17, and the official
season opener will be the Fry's Invi
tational, held over Thanksgiving
weekend, when Stanford will host
Cal-State Northridge.
While much depends on how the
team bounces back from last season,
Montgomery remains upbeat that
the Cardinal can be competitive.
"We feel that we could get into the
upper half (of the Pac-10) although it
would take a real, real tremendous
effort, and a lot of things would have
to fall into place," Montgomeiy said.

Montgomery said. "We really feel

sprained ankle, is back with added
experience after playing for the
English Junior National Team dur
ing the summer.
Juniors Bart Lammersen and
Todd Manley will provide solid front
line help off the bench. Montgomery
acknowledged that the significant
number of minutes Lammersen and
Manley played last season was "a sit
uation they shouldn't have had to
have been put in that early," but he
said he believes both made great
strides over the course of the year.
Forward Andy Poppink, a junior,
returns to the team after sitting out
last season with a bad back, and
junior Justin Armour, also a starting
wide receiver for the football team,

will provide some backup muscle.
The most solid areas for the Car
dinal are at the small forward and off
guard positions. Montgomery is
counting on fifth-year senior small
forward Brent Williams and sopho
more shooting guard Dion Cross to
provide the bulk of the scoring.
Williams led the team in scoring
and rebounding last year with 13.2
points and 5.8 rebounds per game,
but he needs to improve on his 41.5
percent shooting average.
Cross, meanwhile, emerged as the
team's most consistent scoring threat
in the latter half of the 1992-93 sea
son, averaging 15.2 points in the 11
games he started. After being named
to the All-Pac-10 Freshman First
Team last year, Cross has been select
ed as a preseason Honorable Mention
All-American by at least one publica
tion this fall.
Coming off the bench for Williams

and Cross will be junior David Har
bour, who missed all of last season
after undergoing surgery to repair a
seriously injured right thumb, and
20-year-old freshman Rich Jackson,
who has spent the past two years on
a Mormon mission in New Zealand.
After two and one-half weeks of
practice, the Cardinal will start with a
home exhibition against the Blue and
Gold Fleet on Nov. 17, and the official
season opener will be the Fry's Invi
tational, held over Thanksgiving
weekend, when Stanford will host
Cal-State Northridge.
While much depends on how the
team bounces back from last season,
Montgomery remains upbeat that
the Cardinal can be competitive.
"We feel that we could get into the
upper half (of the Pac-10) although it
would take a real, real tremendous
effort, and a lot of things would have
to fall into place," Montgomeiy said.
Trying to rebound from last
year's disastrous 7-23 season, the
Stanford men's basketball team
opened practice this week with a
cast of new players and a feeling of
"cautious optimism."
"I'm not going to make any bold
statements about anything based
on where we have been the last
year," said head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "I think I'm going to
approach this thing with a low-key
approach and challenge our guys to
improve in every aspect of the
game, which I think we can do and
I think we will do.
"We can't afford to have the
types of injury problems that we
had last year," he said.
The Cardinal, which managed
only two wins in the Pacific 10 Con
ference last year, enters the 1993-
94 season with a relatively experi
enced nucleus surrounded by a
number of question marks. In fact,
only six of the 12 players now on
the squad were practicing and play
ing with the team last year.
"To me it's a little like starting
from scratch," Montgomery said.
"It's like coming in and redoing
everything and reemphasizing all of
the things you have to do to win
games, because we didn't do any
thing well enough last year to allow
us to win games."
The Cardinal's most immediate
concern is finding a replacement for
point guard Marcus Lollie, who
graduated after starting for two
seasons. The two candidates vying
for the position are junior Frank
Harris and freshman Brevin
Knight.
Harris is a transfer from Con
nors State Junior College in Warn
er, Okla. — only the second Cardi
nal junior-college transfer since
Montgomery came to the Farm in
1986 (the other was guard Kenny
Ammann). After averaging 20.1
points and 7.3 assists per game for
Connors State, Harris was named a

First Team Junior College All-
American last season by Future
Stars magazine.
Knight, who is from East
Orange, N.J., led Seton Hall Prep to
the state parochial high-school
championship last year, and coach
es suggest that his tremendous
quickness will be a major asset for
the team.
"Both Frank and Brevin are nat
ural point guards and are used to
leading clubs, and I think that
because they're not exactly coming

into an established situation, they
should be able to adjust well,"
Montgomery said. "We really feel
comfortable (that) with these two

Gravely that the position is well
