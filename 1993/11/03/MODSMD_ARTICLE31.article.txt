# Stanford plans Sand Hill meetings
## Public workshops, input sessions to touch on road issues 
### Charles Katz Staff writer 
A year after it filed the necessary applications
with Palo Alto, the University has put its two Sand
Hill road corridor projects on hold until after it com
pletes a six-month program to inform and receive
input from the public about its plans.
One of the applications calls for widening and
extending Sand Hill Road to El Camino Real, along
with an expansion to the Stanford Shopping Center.
The other one asks for the development of a resi
dential community on 48 acres adjacent to the Oak
Creek Apartments and a senior housing community
located on the old Children's Hospital site.
After the program has ended, the required envi
ronmental studies and approval of the projects by
the Palo Alto and Menlo Park City Councils are
expected to take about 14 months, said Richard
Kurovsky, director of University relations.
The outreach program will include a dozen small
meetings with local residents in November and
December, followed by large public workshops from
January to April.
"It's a chance to hear directly from the citizens
what they think about the projects," Kurovsky said.
The Sand Hill Road extension, which has been
under discussion for almost 30 years, would link

Sand Hill with El Camino near the border of Palo
Alto and Menlo Park.
The proposal also includes provisions for widen
ing the road between Santa Cruz Avenue and
Arboretum Road from two lanes to four, and the
work is expected to cost $9.1 million, according to a
1992 study.
The University has asked Palo Alto to pay $2.15
million of the costs to relieve some of the pressure
caused by cars taking short cuts through the shop
ping center. "The extension will rationalize the traf
fic patterns in the shopping center," Kurovsky said.
The shopping center expansion would add about
140,000 square feet of retail space, increasing its
size by 10 percent. In addition to more store space,
the center will add 700 parking spaces.
Stanford West, the proposed residential commu
nity, will have two sections.
In an attempt to provide affordable housing for
University employees, 750 rental units would be
constructed next to the Oak Creek Apartments, and
a senior housing community, composed primarily of
388 independent-living units and 72 assisted-living
units, would be built on the 21-acre lot by the old
Children's Hospital, Kurovsky said.
He added that senior citizen alumni and employ
ees have expressed interest in living at such a com
munity on the Stanford campus.
