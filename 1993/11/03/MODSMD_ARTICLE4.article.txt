## Law prof stomps 7 opponents, gets about 60 percent of vote 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
The atmosphere in Tom Campbell's
campaign headquarters was jubilant
last night, as the new state senator pro
claimed victory and finally put to rest
the specter of his defeat in last year's
U.S. Senate primary.
The Stanford Law School professor
easily beat out seven other candidates
in the race for the 11th District state
Senate seat vacated by Becky Morgan
earlier this year. With 99 percent of the
precincts reporting, Campbell, a Re
publican, had 60 percent of the vote.
The nearest of his seven challengers,
Democrat Hal Plotkin, had 11 percent.
By capturing a majority of the vote,
Campbell won the election outright,
avoiding a run-off.
But in his victory speech, Campbell
made no reference to his landslide, fo
cusing instead on the people who had
helped him win.
"There was one key — the efforts of
the volunteers. What a blessing I had to
have such a wonderful volunteer base
here in Silicon Valley," he said.
Campbell also told his cheering sup
porters not to forget that they had a job
to do.
"The honor of winning carries with
it the obligation to service. That's why
I ran. It is a wonderful victory tonight,

and we're here to celebrate, but also to
remember why we did it: because we
care," he said.
Things were not as easy for Camp
bell last year when he ran for the U.S.
Senate seat currently occupied by De
mocrat Barbara Boxer. Campbell was

the race and split away many of Camp
bell's more moderate supporters.
But with this year's victory, Camp
bell said he feels that he has gotten
back on the right track.
"The call to service has brought me
back, and you with me," he told his
supporters. "Thank you for starting
me on my path once again."
Campbell's path has already been a
long one. A Law School professor since
1983, he unseated the 12th District Re
publican incumbent in the 1988 U.S.
House of Representatives primary,
going on to defeat Anna Eshoo, then
his Democratic challenger, in the gen
eral election. He was easily re-elected

to the same position in 1990.
In the past, Campbell has
insisted that a state Senate
position is not a step down from

the national level, saying that
the office will allow him to
devote time to the issues he
believes are the most important
for his state while still allowing
him to teach at the Law School
part-time.
And, while opponents argue
that Campbell will use this seat

primarily as a means to jump
back onto the national scene, he
maintains that he wants to spend
his time on California issues, par
ticularly the economy. Last night,
he spoke about his visions and
hopes for California's recovery
from the recession.
"We can do it. California is still

a land of opportunity. [My wifel
and I came from Chicago, and
California opened its door to us.
That's a debt I'm trying to
repay," he said.
Campbell's volunteers are con
fident that their candidate will do
a good job. Even Becky Morgan,
whose seat Campbell will soon fill,

turned out to give her support to
the new senator.
"I can't think of a better per
son to succeed me. We have simi
lar philosophies and I can see
him replacing me on several com
mittees. I think he'll be a strong
voice for this district," Morgan
said.
