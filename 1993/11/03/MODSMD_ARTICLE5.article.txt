# Lake Lag more likely to be filled to preserve salamander habitat

The endangered tiger salaman
der killed one Stanford tradition
earlier this year, but it may yet en
sure that another is saved.
Concerns for the salamander's
natural habitat — which led to an
October announcement canceling
the annual Big Game bonfire at
Lake Lagunita — are again being
raised by campus planners. But
this time, the six-inch black sala
mander may save the lake itself.
The annual decision by Univer
sity planners and water manage
ment officials on whether to fill
the lake historically hinges upon
winter rainfall levels. But this
year, biologists are being consult
ed on how maintenance of the lake
affects the salamander population
inhabiting the lake bed and sur
rounding grassland areas.
"From what I know of the crea
ture, it breeds in water, so if we're
really concerned about the sala
mander, it's far preferable to fill

than not to fill," said Drew Oman,
campus planner.
Droughts kept the lake dry for
four years before it was filled in
1992 and again last spring. Exces
sive winter rains and water
pumped from San Francisquito
Creek brought last year's lake
level to nine feet and permitted
swimming, sailing and windsurf
ing there for only the second time
since 1988.
While the salamander's breed
ing habits may tip the scales in
favor of artificially filling the lake
this spring — an endeavor that
costs up to $12,000 from the Uni
versity's water budget — they also
raise questions about controlling
lake-bed vegetation.
"We used to disk the lake bed
every year to get rid of the weeds,"
said Mike McKnight, manager of
the Utilities Division, explaining
how a tractor-pulled hoe was used
to turn the ground.
Last year, conservation con
cerns led groundskeepers to dis

continue disking in favor of mow
ing. This year, McKnight said he
has been advised by conservation
experts that even mowing could be
detrimental to the salamander.
But some say the lake would be
useless for recreational purposes
if weed growth isn't controlled.
Blake Middleton, director of
the sailing and windsurfing pro
grams, said that last year — when
weed growth got a two-month
head start due to excessive winter
rains — use of the lake was "pret
ty marginal."
"There were more weeds than
there was water," Middleton said.
"We tried pulling out just tons of
the stuff, but windsurfers literally
would be sailing along and then
crash and burn when they hit too
many weeds."
