# NAFTA teach-in stresses harms of trade treaty
## 
### Cametra Thompson Staff writer 
About 70 students attended a teach-in last night
on the North American Free Trade Agreement, dur
ing which opponents of the agreement said it will
benefit large corporations at the expense of the ma
jority of Mexican and American citizens.
The meeting — sponsored by the Student Envi
ronmental Action Coalition, a sub-group of Students
for Environmental Action at Stanford — focused on
how NAFTA would harm the environment and
workers in the United States and Mexico.
Peggy Law, an organizer and social activist with
the Peninsula Peace & Justice Center, said the for
mer Bush administration, Mexican and Canadian of
ficials, and multinational corporations negotiated
the agreement in secret. The treaty gives attention
to "intellectual property rights and other issues
which protect business patents and profits," she
said.
Absent from the treaty are protections for labor,
ecology and consumers, Law told the group gathered
in a meeting room at Tresidder
Union.
Law said one of the most dis
turbing aspects of the agreement
are the plans to address non-tariff
trade barriers. Current non-tariff
trade barriers between the United
States and Mexico require Mexico
to observe U.S. environmental laws
in the manufacturing of exports.
"Mexico has more pesticides
than our law allows, and Mexico
can challenge those laws as a barri
er to free trade," Law said, adding
that challenges could be heard by
an international tribunal whose
environmental standards are much
more lax than those in the United
States.
Pratap Chatteijee, a free-lance
writer specializing in environmen
tal issues, said that NAFTA would
encourage companies to relocate to
countries with cheap labor and lax
environmental laws, he said.
Telephone installer Gladys
Mendelson said that while NAFTA
does not directly affect her job, she

is hurt just the same. "If jobs are
hurt here in the U.S., it does affect
my job," she said.
In addition to hurting American
workers, the speakers said the
agreement will harm Mexican
workers.
NAFTA "pits workers on all
sides of the border against each
other," Mendelson said.
According to Law, Mexican
President Carlos Salinas created
changes that drove millions of
small farmers off their lands in an
effort to attract foreign investors.
These changes, called structural
adjustment programs, include
deregulation of environmental and
labor protection laws, support for
export rather than domestic food
crops, privatization of state enter
prises, elimination of food subsidies
and reductions in public expendi
tures for education and public
health, Law said.
The environmental group's
organizers said they are planning a
march to the office of Rep. Anna
Eshoo on Friday, and have gath
ered petitions and are organizing a
trip to Tiajuana Nov. 14 and 15 to
support workers opposed to
NAFTA.
