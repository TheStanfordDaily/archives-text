The student who threw about $4,000 worth
of hardware around the Tresidder Union com
puter cluster Thursday night has turned himself
in for psychiatric help.
The man, whose name was not released,
checked himself into Cowell Student Health
Center Saturday morning.
"He's had some mental instability problems,"
said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
The student was described as "dazed" when
he entered the computer cluster Thursday at
7:15 p.m. and threw an Apple LaserWriter 11, a
Centris 650 CPU, and a high resolution color
monitor to the floor. Police were unable to find
him that night.
After his outburst at Tresidder, the student
apparently "went berserk" at his dormitory as
well, although this was not reported to police,
Niemeyer said.
The typical procedure at Cowell is to retain
such a patient for 72 hours, Niemeyer said. After
release, periodic psychiatric counseling is con
tinued.
Police are not bringing any criminal charges
against the student at this time, Niemeyer said.
