# Republicans sweep to victory in Virginia, New Jersey, NYC

Republicans swept to three
dramatic victories last night,
ousting New Jersey Gov. Jim Flo
rio and New York City Mayor
David Dinkins and taking the gov
ernor's mansion in Virginia.
Christie Whitman won by a
razor-thin margin in New Jersey,
denying Florio a second term. The
New York race was another
cliffhanger, with Rudolph Giu
liani narrowly winning his
rematch against Dinkins.
There was no such drama in
Virginia, where Republican
George Allen beat Democrat Mary
Sue Terry 58 percent to 41 per
cent and ended 12 years of Demo
cratic rule in Richmond.
The GOP triumphs were the
latest in a series of electoral
embarrassments for President
Clinton and his party just a year
after his White House victory.
"The Democrats like to say all
politics is local," said national
Republican chairman Haley Bar
bour. "Well, we learned again
that, locally, Clinton is a very
unpopular president."
Whitman, who made an issue
of Florio's record $2.8 billion tax
increase in 1990, said her election
"sent a message right across this

nation."
Hours earlier in Richmond,
former congressman Allen
claimed victory in a race he began
as a huge underdog.
"The people have demanded
honest leadership from their Vir
ginia government and they'll get
it," Allen told cheering supporters.
With those verdicts in, Dinkins
was the Democrats' last-gasp
hope for blocking a GOP sweep in
the night's big three contests.
At midnight, Dinkins had a
tiny lead, but it quickly evaporat
ed — taking the Democrats' hopes
with it. With 99 percent of the
New York vote in, Giuliani led 51
percent to 48 percent.
Those three defeats came on
the heels of three others for
Democrats since Clinton won last
year's presidential race: Senate
races in Georgia and Texas, and
the Los Angeles mayor's race.
Elsewhere, ballot issues
around the nation tested the pub
lic mood about crime and taxes —
and offered an early look at the
climate awaiting 1994 candidates.
In all, there were races or bal
lot questions in 29 states. In a
warning to incumbents, term lim
its were endorsed by voters in
Maine and New York City. And
anxiety about crime was evident

in Texas, where voters approved a
$1 billion bond issue to build
more prisons. In Cincinnati and
Lewiston, Maine, voters repealed
local gay rights laws.
But the high drama was in
New York and New Jersey.
Three years after a $2.8 billion
tax increase that infuriated voters
and sent his standing into the cel
lar, Florio had appeared poised for
a comeback — and re-election.
Late public opinion polls
showed him leading Whitman, but
the polls that count told a different
story. With 98 percent of the New
Jersey vote reporting Whitman led
50 percent to 48 percent — 32,000
votes out of 2.3 million cast.
Florio's tax hike was the
paramount issue in that contest,
viewed as a test of whether politi
cians could overcome public anger
by selling taxes as tough but
sometimes necessary medicine.
Exit polls showed voters who
thought taxes were the biggest
issue sided convincingly with
Whitman, who promised a 30 per
cent tax cut over three years.
The Whitman and Allen victo
ries whittled the Democratic edge
in statehouse control to 29-19.
Alaska and Connecticut have
independent governors. The
Democratic advantage will be

tested in a big way next year,
when 36 states elect governors.
The Terry and Whitman candi
dacies also were tests of whether
the good fortune women candi
dates enjoyed in 1992 would carry
over. In the end, it was a split
decision; Whitman won in her bid
to become New Jersey's first

woman governor; Terry failed in
her identical quest in Virginia.
The Dinkins loss in New York
didn't do much to the overwhelm
ing edge Democrats enjoy at city
halls, but it was a remarkable tro
phy for Republicans nonetheless.
Coupled with Republican Richard
Riordan's June win in Los Ange

les, Republicans will soon run the
nation's two largest cities. Giuliani
will be New York's first Republi
can mayor in a quarter century.
In another contest of note,
Minneapolis City Council Presi
dent Sharon Sayles Belton was
elected the city's first black
mayor.
