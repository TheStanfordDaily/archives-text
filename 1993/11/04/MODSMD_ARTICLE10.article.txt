# Russia changes its weapons policy
## Military doctrine allows use of nuclear missiles during a first strike 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) â€” Abandoning a
longstanding Soviet policy, Russia now
is ready to launch nuclear missiles in a
first strike if it or its allies are attacked
with conventional weapons, a top offi
cial said yesterday.
The United States and other West
ern powers have repeatedly refused to
rule out a first strike, arguing that such
a pledge would diminish the deterrent
value of their nuclear arsenals and limit
their military options.
The new Russian policy is part of a
military doctrine approved by President
Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday. The docu
ment had been demanded by the mili
tary as payment for its support in
Yeltsin's fight with parliament last
month.
The 23-page doctrine states that
Russia's military mission is primarily
defensive and that no nation is consid
ered a potential enemy.
It also allows the military to inter
vene in domestic crises "to protect the
constitutional system."

This provision "reflects the objective
reality of our society, which is passing
through a transition period," said
Valerie Manilov, deputy secretary of the
country's top policy-making Security
Council.
Manilov said the new doctrine allows
use of nuclear weapons "against states,
nuclear or non-nuclear, which have
undertaken aggression against Russia
or supported such aggression."
"Russia reserves the right to use all
means at its disposal to repulse aggres
sion and crush the aggressors," Manilov
said. "This is in line with the positions
of the United States, Great Britain and
France."
Former Soviet leader Leonid Brezh
nev, speaking at the United Nations in
June 1982, made a unilateral commit
ment not to use nuclear weapons first in
an effort to score propaganda points
against the United States.
That policy formed the backbone of
the Soviet Union's military and political
strategy for years. Soviet authorities

often criticized the U.S. refusal to make
a similar pledge during their attempt to
rally European public opinion against
the deployment of new U.S. missiles in
the 1980s.
The new Russian strategy declares
Russia's hopes to eliminate nuclear
weapons someday, but states it will con
tinue to possess them "at the minimum
expedient level," Manilov said.
He said Russia regards nuclear
weapons as a deterrent, necessary to
"prevent the escalation of local conflicts
into a full-blown war."
The doctrine also reflects Russia's
role as a great power, "with interests in
many parts of the world, which it
intends to defend primarily by political,
peaceful means," he said.
One of the regions that Russia con
siders of national interest because of its
geographical proximity is the Persian
Gulf, and it "will continue to take part
in (international) efforts to resolve
problems of maintaining peace and sta
bility" there, Manilov said.
