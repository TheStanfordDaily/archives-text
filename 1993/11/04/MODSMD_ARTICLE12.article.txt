Bon Appetit's monopoly
on Tresidder food hurts
University and patrons

STUDENTS OF Stanford unite;
you have nothing to lose but
your change.
There is far too little competi
tion on this campus in the distribu
tion and marketing of student ser
vices. One need look only to the
current monopoly on Tresidder
Union food services enjoyed by Bon
Appetit catering to witness the
effects of this unfortunate situa
tion.
If our Econ 1 classes are to be
believed, monopolies cause higher
prices and fewer choices for con
sumers. The antithesis of a
monopoly, free competition, in
evitably results in lower prices and
more choice.
The best way to achieve this type
of variety on campus would be to
institute a competitive, decentral
ized system for food services in
Tresidder. This fundamental
change would constitute the first
battle in a noble experiment to
overcome the negative effects of
Bon Appetit's exclusive franchise.
Competition 'will necessarily
increase revenues, decrease costs,
and present more options for stu
dents and staff eating there. The
overtures made to Taco Bell are a
step in the right direction, but even
that venerable institution will be
forced to have a limited menu
whenever it arrives and will be
under the overall authority of Bon
Appetit.
The administration should sub
contract space in Tresidder to any
one who is willing to pay the highest
cost.
This simple reform would benefit
students and administrators alike.
Initially, the competitive pressures
which would result from indepen
dent contractors within Tresidder
would force existing groups to lower
prices and increase quality or lose

their business.
Furthermore, the administra
tion could make Tresidder dollars
payable at whatever place Stan
ford students choose to shop.
This would empower students to
make their own choices that for
financial reasons could not be
ignored by participating busi
nesses.
Furthermore, instituting compe
tition would lower prices. Who
would believe that the Corner
Pocket would still charge $2.50 for
a piece of pizza when students
could simply take their business to
a neighboring Pizza Hut?
Increasing competition in
Tresidder would be another step
toward bettering on-campus eating
options. The Tea House and Toyon
Terrace have improved the quality
of life for Stanford students and
faculty alike. The addition of other
restaurants or cafes in Tresidder
would further this ameliorative
trend.
Finally, even the administration
would benefit from this action.
Open, competitive bidding would
enable the University to charge
higher licensing fees and collect a
high proportion of revenue from
these new outlets. This will result
in a win-win situation, in which the
University makes more money
from Tresidder space and students
and staff pay less for their meals
there.
The University should realize
that they are fighting a hopeless
battle if they attempt to resist the
trend toward increased product
choice, one of the hallmarks of
modern consumerism. In an era of
increasingly tight budgets, it would
appear counterintuitive, to say the
least, if the University hurt itself
financially in an attempt to deprive
students of the right to convenient
enjoyment of the food they wish to
eat.
The administration of this Uni
versity would be well served to apply
toward food services at Tresidder
the precepts set forth in our motto:
"Let the winds of freedom blow."
It's time to say "Bon Voyage" to Bon
Appetit's monopoly.
