## Unsettling degree programs 
### 
THE BEST thing President Casper
has done is question the Stanford
norm of a four-year bachelor's
degree.
He questioned a fundamental principle,
shaking up the status quo. It is enormous
ly healthy for the institution to step back
and question the norms and assumptions
which underlie undergraduate educational
requirements. It is important to under
stand the current educational context and
be sure that the University is meeting the
needs of students given the current eco
nomic realities and societal expectations
for college graduates.
But Gerhard, where is the parallel
debate about graduate education? Why are
we not questioning our assumptions about
that process?
One expressed norm at Stanford is that
a doctoral degree takes around four years
to complete. The structures of graduate
student financial support (four years of
guaranteed funding) are one way in which
this norm is reified and expressed to stu
dents.
In part this norm originated with the
last comprehensive study of graduate edu
cation, the 1972 "Study of Graduate Edu
cation at Stanford." One finding of this
report was that graduate education took
too long. The culprits were identified as the
academic departments, which did not
establish clear timetables and integrated
academic programs in order to help stu
dents and faculty understand academic

expectations. Many current policies are
structured around the norm of the four
year doctoral degree.
In the intervening 20 years many
things have changed, which makes this
norm unrealistic. The financial commit
ment from the federal government for
graduate-student training has been
severely curtailed. The academic job mar
ket has shrunk. The intellectual expecta
tions for the dissertation have expanded
greatly. What would have been an accept
able dissertation 20 years ago is now con
sidered an acceptable chapter. A mar
ketable dissertation must consist of pub
lished, successful experiments (in the sci
ences), or of material able to be turned
into a book (in the humanities and social
sciences).
The composition of the graduate stu
dent population has changed. The number
of women has tripled nationally; women
now account for 30 percent of the Stanford
graduate student population. Because of
various social factors (e.g. women are more
responsible for child care) it takes longer
for these students to complete a graduate
degree.
Currently, it takes the average Stanford
doctoral student between five and six years
to earn a degree. In 1990-91 and 1991-92,
550 doctoral degrees were awarded. The
average number of Quarters Registered
was between 20 and 21. This translates to
a minimum of five years of continuous
enrollment.

There is considerable variation among
schools and departments. Contrary to lore,
scientists do not finish more quickly than
humanists or social scientists. Of the 38
departments granting at least four doctor
ates in 1991-92, seven departments had an
average of under 17 Quarters Registered
(about 4 years). These departments were
Business, Art, German, Food Research,
Music, Statistics and Psychology. Twenty
departments had an average of 17-21
Quarters Registered (about five years).
Another six departments had an average of
21-25 Quarters Registered (roughly six
years). Students in five other departments
took even longer, over 25 Quarters Regis
tered: Engineering Economic Systems,
English, Biochemistry, Neurosciences and
Microbiology/Immunology.
Clearly the actual experiences of the
students are out of sync with the Universi
ty norm. It is time for the University to
reopen the question of graduate education.
We must risk being unsettled by publicly
debating the assumptions which undergird
the current system of graduate education.
