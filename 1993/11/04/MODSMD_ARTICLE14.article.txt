## Student activist defends supporting Webb Ranch workers 
### 
THIS IS in response to yester
day's letter from Patricia
Scheiern Lewis in which she
criticized Webb Ranch protesters and
called their methods "questionable."
Let me first make it clear that I
speak only for myself as one of the
students currently taking action
against President Casper's position
(or lack thereof) on Webb Ranch.
However, because the student organi
zation to lead this movement is in its
initial stages of formation, I find it
necessary to respond to her accusa
tions before this cause is undermined
by those who wish to stand to the side
and criticize instead of becoming
involved.
On the first hand, The Daily's Oct.
25 editorial was not accurate in calling
the Webb Ranch situation "an ethical
dilemma." The only dilemma we face

is the spineless stance our administra
tion takes on the situation.
I agree with Lewis that the first
course of action is education. This is
why NO PROTESTS have been sched
uled and we are currently gathering
and disseminating information regard
ing the issue for anyone who is inter
ested.
This information was distributed
and discussed at Tuesday evening's
MEChA meeting, which was attended
by members of several campus groups
interested in the issue. And because
we are the first to realize that the
wishes of the workers take priority
over all else, also in attendance Tues
day were six Webb Ranch workers and
their union representative who
answered questions students had
regarding the issue. In addition to
their clarifying remarks, the workers

and the union specifically asked the
students to begin pressuring the Uni
versity to take a stand on the issue.
The fact remains that Stanford not
only owns the land on which Webb
Ranch sits, but also often employs
these same people to do maintenance
work around the main campus. In
addition, these workers are part of the
United Stanford Workers, Local 680,
which represents 1,300 employees at
this school.
Our administration does indeed
have a vested interest in the welfare
of these workers and does indeed have
the power to convince the Webb Fami
ly that their plantation mentality
must cease.
Previous Stanford administrations
have done just this and were some
what successful. However, housing
and working conditions remain inhu

mane and unacceptable. In the past,
laborers have been exploited, mis
treated, and as Augustin Gonzales, a
Webb Ranch worker, told students
Tuesday night, "enslaved." As con
cerned and informed students, we can
not tolerate these hardships brought
upon our neighbors and friends.
So, Ms. Lewis, in response to your
question "How much do [the students]
really know about the workers' cur
rent situation?", the answer is: quite a
bit. And we intend on continuously
informing ourselves and fellow stu
dents until everyone on this campus
becomes aware of the atrocities taking
place in our own backyard. Perhaps
some of us, however, need to stop
using The Daily as our only source of
information.
