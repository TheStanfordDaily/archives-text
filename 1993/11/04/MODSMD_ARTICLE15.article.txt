# Ignorance of American civics, history should be subject for commission
## 
### 
Reading reports on the Commission
on Undergraduate Education has
made me reflect on my own education
al development.
In doing so, I have come to the con
clusion that an undergraduate educa
tion nov/adays does very little to cor
rect a critical flaw engendered in high
school: near wholesale ignorance of
American history, civics and the insti
tutions underpinning this democratic
state.
Yes, other cultures and institutions
deserve their place in the academic
playground, but without the necessary
knowledge and a point of reference
with which to examine and to distin
guish amohg them, education and the
pursuit of truth will be merely akin to

groping in the dark alleys of relativity.
Thus, it seems to me very odd that
we here in the University embrace
everything else except America, as if it
were the embodiment of evil.
The person versed in the art of
discrimination (the good kind) will
know that America, and Americans
themselves, are held to the highest
standards and that these standards
of freedom, democracy and toler
ance are well-nigh impossible to
attain.
And yet there will always be revo
lutionaries, people who would like
nothing better than to tear down the
liberal foundations of this country
through their speech codes and what
nots.
Their efforts perhaps would be
better directed at stopping violence
in their neighborhoods, or finding a
job.
As an immigrant to this country,
I've encountered my fair share of dis
crimination and racism, and many

times I've thought to myself, "This is
sure one racist country." But then
again, I look at my parents and how
they view blacks, and I say, "Now
that's racism and ignorance personi
fied."
I think I'm not as racist as my par
ents, but that wasn't due to multicul
turalism or whatever.
In fact, I believe I owe it to the Ser
mon on the Mount and Thomas Jef
ferson.
If one of the goals of an undergrad
uate education is to prepare students
to be future leaders, then it necessari
ly follows that they know something
about this society that they will be
leaders of.
I'm not too sure; so it belongs in
the hands of the undergraduate com
mission to make sure of this. Or we'll
have another case of the blind leading
the blind.
