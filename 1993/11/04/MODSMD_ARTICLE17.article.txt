## 'Mr. Versatility' carries men's soccer into playoffs Senior foward Ricky Goad stands tall after four stellar seasons on the Cardinal playing fields 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
In a year deemed a "rebuilding
season," the Stanford men's soccer
squad has one player who has
always stood tall.
The construction of Ricky Goad
the soccer player began when he
was only six years old, and the pro
cess has continued ever since.
From his playing in all 21 games as
a Cardinal freshman to this year's
12 goals and 28 points, the Stan
ford senior forward has been a
major contributor to the soccer
program and the backbone of this
year's squad.
"I wasn't really concerned with
soccer when I first came here," said
Goad, who has played in all but
four games at Stanford during his
four-year collegiate career. "I
thought, 'If it works out, great, and
if it doesn't I'll just immerse myself
in other areas.' But it's really been
great."
Goad only played high-school
soccer his freshman year; however,
he participated in club soccer
throughout his high-school tenure
and was a member of the Texas
state champion club team before
making the move to college.
"I've been playing constantly
ever since I was six," Goad said.
"On the club team, I had to drive
two hours to Dallas every time we
practiced."
Goad's high academic abilities
gave him a wide array of colleges to
choose from, but the decision came
down to just two prospective uni
versities.
"My last two choices were Stan
ford and South Carolina, two total
ly opposite schools," said Goad.

"Carolina offered me more money,
but I knew I'd get a better educa
tion at Stanford and be exposed to
a lot of different things."
The college soccer experience
began immediately for Goad. His
freshman year he started in 18
games and saw action in all 21 Car
dinal contests. The team finished
9-6-6 that year.
"My freshman year we didn't
have much talent," Goad said.
"Most of the team was made up of
sophomores."
The following year saw the
emergence of Goad as a scoring
power and team leader. He started
in all but one game that year and
recorded two goals and three
assists. The Cardinal coaching staff
deemed him "Mr. Versatility," as
he saw playing time at both outside
back and midfield.
"We only lost four games in the
regular season my sophomore
year," Goad said of the 1991 Cardi
nal, which recorded its best record
in over 10 years (12-4-5).
That year Stanford lost in the
first round of the NCAA tourna
ment to Santa Clara in overtime.
"It was such a close game,"
Goad said. "We played with them
the entire game, and it could have
gone either way."
Last year the team finished 11-
8-2 and lost in the first round of
the NCAA tournament once
again. But Goad continued to
improve during the season, finish
ing the season as Stanford's
fourth-leading scorer with three
goals and a team-high seven
assists for 13 points.
"Last year we dropped off a little
bit, but we still made the tourney,"
Goad said.

This year, Goad became the
leader and quality all-around play
er that helped lead the 1993 Cardi
nal to the playoffs. He also led the
team in scoring and was third in
the Far West Region in goals
scored.
"Since I've been here the team
has been on an upswing," Goad
said. "I feel like I've contributed my
share to making that happen."
Earlier Cardinal squads never
could make it past that elusive first
round in the NCAA tourney, but
Goad understands the difficulty
that Stanford has in acquiring
high-powered players.
"Maybe there is some kind of a
hill that we can't get over, but it's a
lot harder to recruit here than at
an UCLA," Goad said. "Stanford
doesn't give out much money, and
the grades requirements are so
high."
As if to prove Goad's point, the
Cardinal was looking at six
prospects from the under-18
national team this year, but all six
ended up going to other schools
(such as Duke and Virginia)
because of the lack of monetary
incentives to play for Stanford.
"[Coach] Colin [Lindores] has
done well with the resources that
he has had," Goad said. "We don't
have many scholarships. But this
team will need to get a player in the
next couple of years who's a real
standout."
Both Goad and Lindores came
to Stanford the same year and have
lived through the good and bad
times together for four years.
"Rick is one of those players
that we don't see enough of in the
college game," Lindores said. "He
doesn't have a lot of physical speed,

but he does have a lot of technical
and tactical speed. That's what
gets him through. The college
game, with its mass substitutions
and the tendency for high-powered
games, tends to overlook these
kind of people."
The great improvement that
Goad made from his junior to
senior year is recognized and
applauded by the coaching staff. In
a time when the team was young,
Lindores needed somebody to step
up and take control.
"His performance his final year
here was his best," Lindores said.
"This was something that we
expected him to do in his last year."
Goad echoes praise for his col
lege mentor.
"IColin| is a first-class guy and a
first-class coach," Goad said. "He
really represents this program
well. If he has enough time and
gets help monetarily from the Ath
letics Department, this program
will really take off."
Goad disagrees with the school's
policy of waiting until the team
does well before giving soccer more
money to work with. "It should be
the other way around. With more
money we could get in some better
players and take this team to the
next level."
Competitive soccer is not in
Goad's future plans. He plans to
get a job in his mechanical engi
neering field in his home state of
Texas.
A few final words of wisdom
from one of Stanford's soccer
greats:
"I think everybody should write
the Athletics Department and tell
them to give us more money,"
Goad said. "Also, we need to get

more students into soccer. If you
haven't been to a soccer game since
you've been here, you're really
missing out.
"I've taken a lot of pride in this
program because of the love of the

sport and the competition."
That pride has been reciprocat
ed by Stanford soccer and any stu
dent who appreciates a great ath
lete and a quality human being all
wrapped up in one.
