## Soccer to battle Santa Clara for top seed in Western Region 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
The Western Region's No. 1 seed
will most likely be determined tonight
as the No. 2 Stanford women's soccer
team (15-2-1) journeys to No. 4 Santa
Clara (14-3-0) for its final regular-sea
son game.
Although the Broncos still have one
more game this weekend against No. 11
UC-Santa Barbara, the winner of
Thursday's game is almost assured the
top spot in the regional tournament.
Kickoff is set for 7:30 p.m. at Buck
Shaw Stadium, where Santa Clara is a
perfect 7-0 this season.
As important as this game is in
terms of playoff ramifications, Cardinal
coach lan Sawyers has tried to keep it
in perspective.
"We're trying to build momentum
into the postseason," said Sawyers.
"We want to keep playing well, like we
have over the past two or three games."
Stanford has won its past three
games by a combined score of 12-1.
"We've had a lot of scoring opportuni
ties the past few games, and I think if
we increase our scoring percentages,
we'll do fine," Sawyers added.
Santa Clara rides a similar wave of
momentum, as it just wrapped up the
West Coast Conference Championship
last weekend with a 7-0 win over Loy
ola-Marymount. For the year, the
Broncos have exceeded expectations in
nearly every way, recording an impres
sive 5-2 record against teams ranked
11th or higher this year.
"It's a real surprise this year how
well we've played," said Santa Clara

coach Jerry Smith. "We started off well
and have continued to make small
improvements throughout the season."
A young team, Santa Clara brings
enthusiasm and a fresh outlook to the
field. "A youthful spirit has really
taken over the team," Smith added.
Freshmen have had a major impact
on this club, with first-year forwards
Mikka Hansen and Erin Martinez lead
ing a high-scoring Bronco attack, which
has broken all-time school goal and
assist records. Hansen ranks fifth in
the Western Region with 14 goals and
seven assists, while Martinez has seven
goals and 11 assists.
"Mikka is a very raw player with a
lot of rough edges," Smith said. "She's
got the same type of hard-nosed,
aggressive play as Sarah Rafanelli. Erin
is a lot more refined and is an excellent
passer."
However, the key to the Santa Clara
offense is sophomore midfielder Jen
nifer Lalor. Although she has only
scored five goals this year, her 15
assists leaves her two shy of the school
record.
Goalkeeping remains a mystery for
the Broncos. Junior Dawn McDonald
was tabbed as the starter at the begin
ning of the season, but a torn posterior
cruciate ligament in her knee forced
her to miss 10 games. Freshman
Rachel Stoppello filled the void in goal,
but as soon as McDonald was ready to
play again, Stoppello went down with
an ankle sprain. Both are in playing
shape now, but Smith has not decided
who will start for Santa Clara.
"We may alternate and play one in
the first and one in the second half, or

we may give this game to one and Sat
urday's game to the other," Smith said.
The specter of last year's matchups
with the Broncos looms over the Stan
ford squad. Playing to a 1-1 tie at Mal
oney Field during the regular season,
Santa Clara returned to Stanford and
eliminated the Cardinal in the finals of
the Western Regionals with a 2-0 victo
ry. The all-time series between the two
schools is knotted at 6-6-4, but Santa
Clara is 4-1-1 since 1989. Despite the
recent difficulty with the Broncos, Car
dinal goal keeper Leslie Garrard isn't
worried about Thursday's game.
"For some reason, there's this huge
rivalry between us and Santa Clara,"
Garrard said. "They play it up to be
some big huge game. They purposefully
schedule our game at night so it can be
a big social event. Obviously they're a
well-coached team, they're always con
tenders, but I know we're better than
them. They just live off their reputa
tion."
Despite the importance of the game,
Sawyers does not plan on changing his
team's strategy. Rather, he wants to go
with what has gotten it here so far,
namely scoring bursts and an excep
tional defense which has limited its
opponents to an average of 7.6 shots
and a miniscule .37 goals per game.
"To change drastically for one game
wouldn't do us much good," Sawyer
said. "I'm very happy with what we've
done this year."
Senior Sarah Rafanelli continues to
pace the team in scoring with 16 goals
and eight assists. Her 40 total points
ranks her second in the region and 15th
in the nation.
