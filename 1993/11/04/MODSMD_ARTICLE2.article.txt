Just one day after voters pummeled
Proposition 174, California's controversial
school voucher initiative, Political Science
Prof. Terry Moe introduced two new vouch
er proposals that may be placed on next No
vember's ballot.
Moe said the measures are "very differ
ent" from the defeated proposition and ad
dress "many of the concerns — like cur
riculum requirements, teacher standards,
financial accountability and testing re
quirements — that people had with 174."
The new proposals would also give larger
vouchers to low-income and significantly
disabled children. Either proposal would be
phased in over a seven-year period to miti
gate the financial impact on the state, and
both would protect the state's level of school
funding guaranteed by Proposition 98.

"What we learned from
the 174 campaign was that
people are very dissatisfied
with the current educa
tional system. They want
radical change, real over
haul," Moe said.
"I think people are very
supportive of school
choice, but they just didn't
want 174," he continued.

"[These proposals] address every single one
of their concerns."
Moe, who wrote the measures with six
other people, formally submitted them to
the state attorney general yesterday after
noon. He refused to identify the other au
thors.
On Tuesday, 70 percent of voters in the
statewide special election voted "no" on
