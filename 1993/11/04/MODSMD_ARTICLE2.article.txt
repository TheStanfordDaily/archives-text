# Prof introduces new school voucher plan
## Moe's proposals would toughen regulations, give more funding to low-income students

Just one day after voters pummeled
Proposition 174, California's controversial
school voucher initiative, Political Science
Prof. Terry Moe introduced two new vouch
er proposals that may be placed on next No
vember's ballot.
Moe said the measures are "very differ
ent" from the defeated proposition and ad
dress "many of the concerns — like cur
riculum requirements, teacher standards,
financial accountability and testing re
quirements — that people had with 174."
The new proposals would also give larger
vouchers to low-income and significantly
disabled children. Either proposal would be
phased in over a seven-year period to miti
gate the financial impact on the state, and
both would protect the state's level of school
funding guaranteed by Proposition 98.

"What we learned from
the 174 campaign was that
people are very dissatisfied
with the current educa
tional system. They want
radical change, real over
haul," Moe said.
"I think people are very
supportive of school
choice, but they just didn't
want 174," he continued.

"[These proposals] address every single one
of their concerns."
Moe, who wrote the measures with six
other people, formally submitted them to
the state attorney general yesterday after
noon. He refused to identify the other au
thors.
On Tuesday, 70 percent of voters in the
statewide special election voted "no" on

174, which would have amended
the state constitution to grant
school-age children $2,600 vouch
ers to use at the private school of
their choice.
The California Teachers Associ
ation and other educational groups
contributed more than $10 million
to defeat the initiative. They
warned that the measure would
allow virtually anybody to open a
private school and would drain
money from the state's already
stretched education budget.
Although the vouchers would
have been worth about half what
the state spends, on average, for
each student, opponents said the
plan could have cost taxpayers an
additional $1.3 billion to $1.8 bil
lion a year. They claimed that
while most of the state's 554,000
children already enrolled in private
schools would take advantage of
the program, there would be few
openings available for public
school children at private schools,
resulting in increased costs.
Moe said the gradual phase-in
of the program would answer
174's funding problems. In the
program's first year, only low
income students would receive
vouchers. In the second year,
other children not currently
enrolled in private schools would
receive a fraction of the full
voucher funding. After a few
years, these students and private

school students would receive the
full $2,600 voucher.
"It'll soften the hit on the state
and allow savings to mount up,"
Moe said.
Many opponents of 174 also
charged that $2,600 was too low
an amount to fully fund tuition
for poorer students. Under Moe's
plan, low-income and disabled
children would receive $4,000
vouchers.
The only difference between
Moe's two proposals is that one
would require 15 percent of stu
dents at a voucher-redeeming
school to come from low-income
families. The 15 percent require
ment, Moe said, would prevent
discrimination based on family
wealth.
"Obviously, for some people
this is a very controversial provi
sion," he said. "In the end, we'll
use the one that gets the most
support."
In addition, the proposals
require teachers at voucher
redeeming schools to have a bach
elor's degree and have passed a
state competency test. New
voucher schools would also be
subjected to auditing and testing
requirements, Moe said.
"Compared to 174, virtually all
of this stuff is new," he said.
While the measure prohibits
discrimination on the basis of
race, family income and place of
residence, Moe said voucher
schools would be allowed to use
religion and gender as an admis
sions criterion.

Education Prof. Martin
Carnoy, a voucher opponent, said
Moe's proposal is an improvement
over 174 but that some funda
mental questions have still not
been resolved.
"This proposal still assumes
that the main problems with
schools can be fixed through the
marketplace," he said. "That's a
big assumption."
Both Carnoy and Education
Prof. Michael Kirst questioned how
much support the proposals will
receive. With added regulations,
Kirst said, Moe risks alienating pri
vate school leaders and conserva
tive groups that supported 174.
"The more he placates the
[California Teachers Association],
the more he loses from his sup
port base," Kirst said. "It's hard
to design a proposal to pick up a
winning coalition."
In fact, leaders of the Excel
lence Through Choice in Educa
tion League, the group that
backed Proposition 174, have
given Moe's plan a lukewarm
response.
"It's short-sighted just to
throw a proposal out without hav
ing the resources to back it," said
Sean Walsh, the group's commu
nications director.
The group is examining other
options and may design another
initiative in the next few days.
Joseph Alibrandi, the group's
leader, told the San Francisco
Chronicle that he is considering a
measure for next year's ballot
that would be very similar to 174,

except for a new testing require
ment and a three-year funding
delay for students in private
schools.
Carnoy said Moe's emphasis on
low-income families would not
gain him much support at the vot
ing booth.
"Most of the people who vote
don't want to increase social
spending," he said.
Kirst said Moe's coalition
needs to raise at least $10 million
to wage a successful campaign,
and those most helped by the pro
posal are not likely to be large
contributors. And in order for
either of the measures to qualify
for next year's ballot, supporters
would need to collect at least
600,000 signatures.
"He's got a long way ahead of
him," Kirst said. "It going to be
very hard after being defeated 70-
30 to get enough enthusiasm up
quickly."
Moe, who has spent the past
several days toiling over the pro
posals, said his group introduced
them yesterday to get a head start
in the signature-gathering pro
cess. And despite the seemingly
insurmountable obstacles ahead
of him, Moe remains confident
that his measure will pass.
"It's war with the educational
establishment. We don't have to
depend on the support of the reli
gious right or others," he said.
"Our success depends on convinc
ing business and social groups
who care about educational quali
ty in this state."
