# New kid on the block: Bill Walsh, meet Rob

Steve Stenstrom should stop right
here.
If Cary Wendell continues, she'll get
completely lost. Gary Stolz won't do any
better.
They just can't understand.
Hey, we all used to be athletes. But we
came to Stanford, sure that our athletic
glory days were over. Knowing full well
that being the best swimmer in Rapid
City, S.D., doesn't mean a darn thing to
Skip Kenney and his squad, we still
choose to matriculate. With reassurances
like, "Shoot, I could have started at Har
vard," we began our academic career on
the Farm, having finished participating in
competitive sports. We hung up the cleats,
threw out the jock strap and lost the com-

bination to our ath
letic locker. We
retired.
The first few
weeks were fine. We
sure as hell didn't
miss the practices,
the two-a-days and
the total-body
fatigue. We watched
the athletes miss out
on all the fun we
were having in our

dorm and smiled. We didn't need sports.
Then, it started to set in. The"I
remember that!" feeling. Soon we start
coming home from most Cardinal match
es just a little depressed. Shoot, cheering
is fun, but we missed playing. The capma
raderie, the competition, the physical
exertion. We lost it all when we hopped on
that plane bound for SFO.
So we fighj that feeling the best we
can. Some choose to write about their
favorite sport, others talk about it on the
radio (some are so desperate that they do
both). Some get together with other ex
jocks on IM teams, while others take soli
tary jogs around Campus Drive and up to
the Dish.
But in my experience, none of these
solutions work. Sure, IM sports are fun,
but you can never get that same competi
tiveness out of a bunch of friends just try
ing to have fun that you got from real
teams in high school. Taking long runs or
working out constantly just highlights the
"What's the point?" question. And no
matter how many times you write "We
win," the hard fact remains that they
won, you merely wrote about it.
Well, I've got a solution. It took me
almost two years to find it, but I found the
perfect outlet for my repressed athieti

cism. Coaching.
There are billions of little suburbanite
kids in this affluent area, all being forced
to play on as many teams as their parents
can sign them up for. Football, baseball,
basketball, soccer; sporting leagues are
peppered all over Palo Alto, in every sea
son. And they all need coaches.
That's where we come in. Last spring I
got together with six of my closest friends
and helped coach a Little League baseball
team. Really only three of us started the
squad, hut as our friends found out how
much fun the practices and games were,
they all came along to help out.
Basically, we were given 14 8-to-12-
year-olds to mold in our image (go ahead,
free blow). We practiced twice a week on

the field between Gover
nor's Corner and Suites,
and played on the week
ends. At first we worried
about how much time it
was taking, but soon it
became the only thing
that we looked forward to
during the week. We had a
great time at practices
and, most importantly, we
lived for the games.
The games became festi-

'" v IVOH
vals of sorts. With all the coaches and our
friends and the various parents all attend
ing, we'd get sometimes as many as 30 or
40 fans. We had our own little rituals,
from making all the kids sit in their bat
ting order to telling a pre-inning joke
before we took the field. We had a special
infield/outfield program and our own
cheer whenever we struck someone out.
We had heroes and goats. There was
Greg Tsien, striking out the last batter
with the bases loaded to preserve a 4-3 vic
tory. There was little Russell Douglas,
pulling a Bill Buckner and costing us a
playoff bid. There was even Amhad, a
nine-year-old who couldn't catch a beach
ball on the first day of practice, making a
diving catch in center field to win our
third game.
Most importantly, our "Omega Print
ing" squad was a real athletic endeavor.
We created a team, taught them as much
as we could, then helped them compete
against the toughest elementary school
kids in the city. It was challenging and
competitive. It was euphoric and depress
ing. It was fun.
We got rid of that "I remember that!"
feeling by looking forward to the next
game, rather than missing the ones that
finished years ago.
