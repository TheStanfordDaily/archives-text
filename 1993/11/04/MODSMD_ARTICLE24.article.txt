# Sports medicine class gets its second wind
## 
### Wendy Kula 
Gone are the days when an
athlete could be at the top of his or
her sport without an entourage of
medical professionals — doctors,
trainers and therapists now have
a permanent place on the side
lines.
And as the field of sports
medicine expands, so does the
range of discussion topics in the
School of Medicine's recently
revived sports medicine class.
Going beyond covering physical
therapy in traditional sports like
football, basketball and soccer, the
course also exposes students to
aspects of dancing and high alti
tude climbing, as well as sports
psychology.
Dr. Alfred Spivack, a Palo Alto
cardiologist and clinical professor
of medicine, led the effort to reacti
vate the sports medicine course,
which was discontinued in 1988
for budgetary reasons.
"For 12 years, there was good
attendance and good interest,"
Spivack said.
Part of the Medical School's
effort to develop a comprehensive
sports medicine program, the
course, "Medicine 260: Sports
Medicine," emphasizes physiology,
psychology and proper athletic
training.
The course also touches upon
sports-related issues like not push
ing young athletes, the increased
risk of sexually transmitted dis
eases for young star athletes, and
the effects of aging on an athlete's
body.

In addition, the course often
takes students outside the tradi
tional classroom setting.
Several lectures have been held
in the varsity training room to
allow students a chance to look
around and familiarize themselves
with the equipment essential to
injury assessment and basic treat
ment.
"Sports medicine has a renewed
sense of purpose on campus," said
Dr. James McGuire, chief of staff
at the Medical Center and acting
director of the Sports Medicine
Program.
"It has brought people back to
the Stanford campus like Michael
Dillingham (primary orthopedic
surgeon for the San Francisco
49ers), Spivack and other people
who are interested in sports
medicine, but didn't have a
venue," McGuire said.
"My own athletic past has cre
ated an awareness for the
increased performance that comes
from playing injury-free," said
senior Eric Cetrulo, a member of
the lacrosse team who is consider
ing medical school.
But for some students, like
Karen Heles, a graduate student in
genetics, the course has little to do
with her career goals. As an ath
lete who underwent reconstructive
knee surgery, Heles is more famil
iar with sports medicine from the
patient's side.
"During my treatment I real
ized that sports medicine is a field
that is continuously growing,"
Heles said. "There is always room
for learning and improving."
