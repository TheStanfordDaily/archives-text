# Angry black man under glass Victor Haseman

The day was a good day. Or was it? Pass
ing the tape to Silver Screen who
slipped it into the Clarion pullout,
The Punisher declared, "Man, no one I've let
listen to Cube's new record has liked it yet. You
know how trife it is, man?"
I didn't.
"My roommate told me not to even bother
dubbing him a copy."
"Preach it," chimed S.S., hand raised sancti
moniously as he invoked hip-hop's guardian
deities as his witness, "the shit was ass."
"Of course, being the third member of the
Drop Squad," continued T.P., "we had to wait
for your opinion before declaring Cube, dead,
dead, dead."
"Word," I muttered.
Membership has its privileges and my pass
was sterling. Still, after indulging in the savory
accoutrements — the free movie screenings,
the interviews, the politics, etc — of enter
tainment journalism for two years, we three
had developed a cynicism that would make
Murphy seem optimistic. If it wasn't ambrosia
from on high, it was pig slop from down
under.
But even though we all feared that Ice Cube,
the Nigga Amerikkka's lads loved to hate, was
leaning further and further into the abyss of

creative failure, I was caught off-guard by the
speed with which my fellow Droppers (both
hearty Cube fens) had decided that the brotha
with the new album had all but fallen off. But
listening is believing, so I braced myself for
what might be the most unnecessary disap
pointment of the year.
TP's advance copy of Cube's fourth, "Lethal
Injection," started like every record before it: an
intra that drops an agenda for mass consump
tion. First, he was better off dead
("AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted"), then he was
eulogized as the wrong nigga to fuck with
("Death Certificate"). And now two albums
later, on "Lethal," he's a medical technician
with a .357 injection meant expressly for white
boys.
"Brace yo' self?'
The cocking of the hammer and following
gun shot happened so quickly and with such
noise that the three of us jumped, forgetting
momentarily that the gat wasn't pointed at us
but at the temple of Mr. White.
Some agenda.

With throats choked by nearly delighted
giggles of astonishment, our heads bobbed,
more in response to the illness of the staged
event than the lyrics, samples and break beats
of "Mutherfuckin G," the album's first track.
Tracks two, three, four, five... they, too, fell on
deaf ears because the intro consumed my
mind. And with every mental playback, my
view toward it changed until it thoroughly and
hopelessly weirded me out.
The realization that Cube had never snuffed
someone on a record without a reason dealt me a
pile-driving blow from behind. South Central's
own is and always will be a lot of things — short
fused, militant and above all else a down-ass "G."
But he had never indulged in pure gratuitousness
until "Lethal Injection."
I looked around my car at the rest of the
Squad, hoping one of my homies would under
stand my position through osmosis. Negative.
So I decided to drop the bomb....
"Yo fellas, Cube's not just on some ol' next
shit, he's practically being as irresponsible as the
Hughes Bros, were with 'Menace II Society.' I

mean think about it, if a white cat tried to flip
some shit like this, brothas and sistas would not
be having it Right?"
The Droppers let me ramble on until, in des
peration, I asked, "Look, do I have a problem or
what? When this album drops at the end of No
vember, all of Cube's white fans will make certain
this album goes platinum fester than you can
spell Top 40 backwards. Are /all trying to tell me
that when they pop their cassettes and CDs in,
they're going to enjoy hearing Cube put their
collective white head out?"
TP. and S.S. had two words for me, words
that my own cynicism should have clued me
into — "self-respect" and "threat" One could
waste unnecessary time and energy concocting
elaborate justifications of Cubes blatant bel
ligerence, but why bother when it's a white
company (Priority) and not a black one col
lecting money from middle-class white kids
who can't get enough of Southern Califomian
wild, black rage.
If only a young black male on a record cover
could be as serious a threat to the establish
ment as he is to himself and other black men.
But since they aren't, my apologies. Cube's re
ally a wily businessman. Cheers to intimidat
ing black men, their guns and the imaginary
white boys they kill. You go Cube. ■
