# Cultivating character
## The 						somber stories of Steven Kloves 
### Todd Bernstein 
Blood, guts, sex, guns, bombs, sex,
breasts, knives, drugs, snappy one
liners, sex and an occasional death
via power tool seem to be what the American
public looks for in a movie these days.
Look at the box-office success of "Termina
tor II" and "Demolition Man," "The Naked
Gun" and "Risky Business." Not to deny the
enjoyment found in blood-and-guts action
adventures and slapstick comedies, but it is
becoming harder and harder to find the suc
cessful, simple, character-driven films with
themes which resonate in audiences' minds
for days on end.
But writer and director Steve Kloves con
tinues to march to the beat of his own charac
ter-driven drum.
"(Character development] is probably
what I enjoy doing the most and what attract
ed me to film in the first place," says Kloves,
sounding more like a casual pal than a well
known movie director accustomed to dealing
with the likes of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid.
"I grew up watching the movies of the late '60s
and early '70s, which were the ones I remem
ber to be character-driven. I always felt that
the best movies were the ones in which you
knew the people ... they continued to live
after you left the theater."
Kloves has sought to develop strong, realis
tic characters in each of his three films, most
recently in "Flesh and Bone." Similar efforts in
his directorial debut, "The Fabulous Baker
Boys," helped earn that film four Oscar nomi
nations and a Writers Guild of America nom
ination for Best Original Screenplay.
"I try to create characters that will linger
with you after you leave the movie, not just
cardboard cutouts. I try to give my characters
dimensions," Kloves explains.
One reason his characters are so realistic is
that Kloves bases them on people he has
known throughouthis life. While the 33-year
old director acknowledge* that most people
do not suffer experiences as tragic as those of
his movie characters, their lives seem to paral
lel the audeience's to some degree —
whether, it involves emotions or experiences.
But why is character development as a
film's central focus considered such a novel
concept by contemporary movie-goers?
Kloves insists that character-driven movies
are not a lost art among filmmakers. "It's cer
tainly taken a lot of body blows in the past
years — it's a bruised art. It troubles me a

10t.... I think there are writers who want to
do this work, there's just so much resistance in
Hollywood, that it just pushes people away."
Due to Kloves' effort to create believable
stories, his films are often criticized as somber
and depressing. "Flesh and Bone" is no excep
tion. The film takes a look at how traumatic ex
periences of one's past can change a person s
life forever. Moreover, the work analyzes man's
in ability to escape from his past and fate.
Kloves is not afraid to avoid using the "hap
pily ever after" ending that seems standard in
many films today. For example, *Flesh and
Bone" clearly does not have a storybook ending,
causing many critics to slight the film by de
scribing il as a very "bleak drama." The director
decries this diaracterizatioaas unfair; insisting
that "(the audience] doesn't have to laugh for
two hours to think that a movie is not somber."
Additionally, he cites another "problem"
with the changing perception of movies in so
ciety: "Twenty years ago, ['Flesh and Bone']
wouldn't have been seen as that somber a
movie. Hollywood has betrayed audiences in
the past several years... in the sense that hor
rible things can happen (in films) and then
you're fine."

Kloves criticizes this theme as unrealistic
and too simple. "I don't think people escape
their pasts. I think they learn how to deal with
it, and certainly go on to have good lives, but
some acts are irrevocable and damage people
forever."
Another ideal in movie-making that typi
fies Kloves' dramatic style is his desire to allow
the audience to draw their own conclusions
about his films' events, whereas most movies
tie up all the loose ends at the end of the film,
leaving the audience with nothing to guess at.
His films seem to "purposely meander" in an
effort to circumvent leading the audience in
any particular direction throughout the entire
drama. He chooses to leave his own interpre
tations out ofbts films ami require audiences
to pay attention and think about what the
movie is essentially saying.
"People are used to being spoon-fed. I still
believe in the audience... but I think there has
been a trend in movies where things are so light
and frosty, that even some 'dramas' are pretty
light and thin. And they don't challenge an au
dience or cause an audience to feel deeply."
Kloves wants audiences to continue think
ing and talking about his films after the lights

come up. He concedes that you have to be pa
tient with his movies, but if you pay attention
you can discover for yourself the "thematic
ramifications" the movie establishes.
Besides the obvious character and plot de
velopment that occurs in his films, Kloves fo
cuses heavily on visual style. How the images
on the screen help to form his characters and
story is Kloves' greatest concern, following the
completion of the actual script.
"1 always want the camera to be invisible. I
felt that [for 'Flesh and Bone'] it was extreme
ly important that viewers never feel the cam
era pressuring them." It was important to
Kloves that the actors felt comfortable on
screen as well. The characters seem to dictate
the movement of the cameras, rather than
having the cameras choreograph the actors.
Due to his tremendous desire to keep the
camera from calling attention to itself, Kloves
teamed up with Academy Award-winning di
rector of photography Philippe Rousselot ("A
River Runs Through It") for "Flesh and Bone."
The two effectively conceal the presence of the
camera, except in rare scenes when they feel it
should move for a specific purpose, to draw
attention to some aspect of a character or
event. For example, in the opening scene,
when a child watches his father murder a fam
ily after a robbery goes sour, the camera focus
es on the still child and pans only to show the
violence of each death.
To what will Kloves apply his unique film
style next? Uncertain of his future, the writer
director said his only plan is to begin working
on another original screenplay — although
the topic is still unknown.
With his unpopular emphasis on charac
ter-development, where does Steve Kloves
think he stands in the motion picture indus
try? He doesn't He admits that he never
knows how the public or the critics feel about
him, but hopes that he has had a positive effect
on those who see his films.
"Movies were very important to me grow
ing up. There nave been some movies that
have lingered in my mind for years, and I go
back and revisit them and they're like old
friends. Hopefully, I've made a couple of
movies that, at least for a few people in the au
dience, have given them the same feeling that
I had in watching movies growing up."
There's no doubt that, due to Kloves' work,
movie aficionados have picked up a couple of
new friends along the way. ■
