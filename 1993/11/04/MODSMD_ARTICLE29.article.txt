# The 						Crux
## of the matter 
### Marnie Berringer 
qwas reading a column in a local
newspaper that moaned and
wailed about the "youth of today"
and how theater would "die out"
because Generation X does not appreciate it.
Well, the Drama Department's premier pro
duction of playwright April de Angelis'
"Crux" gives us a chance to prove them all
wrong.
What exactly is "Crux," you ask? In dictio
nary terms, crux (kruks) is "a crucial or vital
moment; critical point; the basic, essential,
or central feature." It's also the perfect title for
a play by a writer whose art is as politically
and socially driven as de Angelis.
So it's not surprising that her play is an
odd combination of the contemporary and
medieval, avant-garde and traditional.

"It's a fun play," claims director

Kirstie Gulick, a second-year

graduate student in

drama. "It isn't a com
edy, but it has jug
gling and magic, straw

and rotting fruit. It has
atmosphere. You can al-

most smell it."

Although the play is set in
14th-century France, the lan-

guage is pure, contemporary

American. Well, British, if you want

the truth — there are a few "bloodies"

thrown in. Hailing from London, the

poet / playwright's works haven't been

performed much in the United States, al
though she has had a bit of success in her na
tive land.

Her play "Ironmistress," which draws par
allels to the Thatcher era, won a Fringe First
at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival for its story
set in a 19th-century iron foundry. Another
play, "Soft Vengeance," focuses on the issues
relating to racial strife in South Africa. And
her play-in-progress was commissioned by
Graiae, an English disabled theater company.
"She makes a living," Gulick says, which is
all some can ask for these days, especially in
the theater.
Gulick became familiar with de Angelis'
work while working in London after graduat
ing from college. "She writes very well-struc
tured, highly poetic plays," she says.
"Crux" is an ensemble piece, which pro
vides a great opportunity for student actors.
The cast consists of four women (Laura
Farabough, Marcie Gilbert, Kei Harris and
Kathleen Peterson) and two men (Thomas
Freeland and Geoff Sobelle). And with two
graduate students and four undergraduates,
the range in age and talent is impressive.
Three members of the cast have even acted
professionally. "It's a tight group; an excellent

cast," says Gulick. "All of the roles are very
strong."
The evolution of "Crux" began about
three years ago, when de Angelis was com
missioned by an English theater company to
write a play concerning the Crusades. But

while there is a mention of the Crusades
in "Crux," it is clearly not the focus.

Instead, it is loosely based

around a bizarre footnote

in the religious history

of France.
At the time

when the

pope

resided
in Avi-

gnon in the
south of

France, there
arose a kind of "al-

ternative" religious

movement known as

the Free Spirit. Follow-

ers of this movement be-

lieved that God resided in
each of them, so that their

will was His will. For them, sin

didn't exist. Neither did money
or property ownership. Further
more, the members of the Doctrine

of the Free Spirit would do no work,
relying on their neighbors and the
Catholic church to take care of them.

In 1310, because of the growing unpopu
larity of the movement's religious practices,

Marguarite Porete, an itinerant preacher in
the Free Spirit, was burned at the stake for
heresy. "Crux" focuses on the events sur-

rounding her death and the home of
"voluntary poverty" she estab
lished with three other women.

De Angelis questions what a
woman's place in organized re
ligion should be. The women

presented develop their

own kind of ritual to re
place the traditional

dogma which leaves

them "in the back
galley not under-

standing the
Latin," ac-

cording to

Gulick.

"Crux"

does not advo-

cate overthrowing

beliefs, but questioning
them. It also questions the

very construction of spirituality.
Sexual roles in medieval society and

today are also examined in De Angelis'
play. "There is no doubt that the women pre
sented are threatening to their society," ex
plains Gulick. "They have stepped out of the

roles available to them, which are basically
marriage or prostitution."
By refusing either role, she continues, men
have no power over them. And that scares
them.
"Crux" is important for both of many rea
sons, but also because of the fact that this is
theater, and not just a movie or a book. En
tering the theater, you become a part of the
performance, you are involved in the spirit
and the message. Theater lets you question,
makes you think.
"Crux" offers a unique opportunity to be
one with theater, to immerse your soul in the
experience. Because of the Nitery Theater's
small seating capacity, the audience is even
more crucial to the performance. In addition,
Crux is being presented "in the round," in
which the audience is seated on all four sides
of the actors.
"Honestly," suggests Culick, "theater can
be a spiritual experience, which makes the
subject of' Crux' even more relevant. "With
its atmosphere of ritual and performance, a
play can offer a striking contrast to the rituals

of religion, which heightens the intensity

and emotional impact of the perfor

mance."

"Crux" is not just a play for femi
nists, but for people of all religions
- and both sexes. Even though the

issues presented might have a
-A 1

strong and very personal
emotional impact, don't ex-

pect an hour and a half
lecture. It is another

world, yes, but it
doesn't have to be

scary.
It is a

world where
every day life is

closer to the earth.
Where people fight and

lie, weep and die. "A world of
stench and lice," as director Gulick

puts it, "with an all-powerful pope

with bizarre sexual fetishes." Oh, that kind
of world.
De Angeli's "Crux" sends a breath of air.
No, not fresh air, but air heavy with the scent
of sweat and pain, of human suffering. De
Angeli forces us to question and experience,
to live in the most raw sense of the word. ■
