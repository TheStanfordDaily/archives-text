# Diabetes prevented in experiments with mice

After two and a half years of work, Stan
ford researchers have found a protein that
may cause juvenile diabetes.
Five postdoctoral fellows working in the
laboratory of Microbiology and Immunolo
gy Prof. Hugh McDevitt identified the pro
tein glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)
through experiments on mice bred to devel
op a disease similar to juvenile, or Type I,
diabetes in humans.
The team also discovered that exposing
subjects to the protein when they are young
can stop diabetes from developing.
Type I diabetes prevents the production
of insulin, causing diabetics to tire easily
and forcing them to take daily insulin injec
tions to live. The disease — which usually
strikes people younger than 35 — can lead
to poor circulation and blindness, and af
fects approximately one of every 500 people
in the United States.
Though the identification of the protein
points to a possible treatment, Dr. Roland
Tisch, one of the researchers involved, said
that his team's findings would not revolu
tionize diabetes care overnight.

"There is a possibility [that we have
found] a protein for therapeutic use," Tisch
said, but he quickly added that "there's still
much groundwork that has to take place
before we can consider [GAD] a true possi
bility" for stopping diabetes before it devel
ops in humans.
"This work is very preliminary," Tisch
said.
He said the researchers' next step will be
to learn how GAD induces tolerance
against diabetes when it is introduced
early, and to study aspects of the immune
reaction against the protein.
"We want to dissect the actual GAD pro
tein to see what aspects of it are involved in
diabetes," he added.
GAD — which is found in nerve cells and
insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas
— was one of five proteins that the re
searchers studied.
It was the only protein that induced an
immune response in mice that coincided
with the onset of diabetes: after GAD was
introduced to four-week-old mouse tissue,
white blood cells began to attack the in-
