means every

ple who have a history of

writing verbal checks their rep-

utations can't cash. When not ex-

panding his niche in the urban art

form known as hip-hop, KRS-One,

a.k.a. Kris Parker, tends to lose control in

everyday conversation.

But this unpredictability is why any
event involving rap's self-proclaimed
"Teacher" is that much more exciting. De
pending on his mood, anything can jump
off — a slammin' history lesson as in "Edu
tainment" or a brutal on-stage beatdown, & la

P.M. Dawn.
"Fuck black people," Parker says emphatically. All pre
sent in the small conference room remain still, wondering
what the calmly maniacal individual will say next. Making
direct eye contact from across the solid oak table, Blast
master Kris leans in my direction, driving his point home.

With a frame thatValmostas solid as his Ivrical repu
tatig|, fcris e'ally intimidates those finaccugfljmed to his
lantings and ravings. A PBS film crew, mouths agape,
keeps the tape rolling. Their nucropiKJfies hover overhead
as they film our animated exchange for a documentary
they are miming about a man widdy regarded as a walk
ing, talking contradiction.
"Fuck black people." This statement, taken out of con
text, from one of the artists who pioneered rap Afrocen
tricity, seems to confirm what many other hip-hop writ
ers have whispered in closed-door editorial sessions ail
along; KRS-One is out of his cotton pickin' mind.
"I don't get caught up in pro-black cause that's a false
philosophy," he continues. His voice, slightly raised and
tinged with more than a bit of cynicism, reverberates
from the walls. "Put that in the article too. Fuck that.
'Cause at the end of the day, if you're not thinking like a
human being, it doesn't matter."
Not even 20 minutes after daring — damn near urg
ing — me to print the statement, Kris requests I retract it
from the interview. Joined in sentiment by his BDP Crew
member Willie D, he feels that he might be misinterpret
ed by the black masses, especially after the commercial
failure of his "H.E.A.L." (Human Education Against Lies)
project.
What's said is said, though. He was on the record. He's
the man who, on the August afternoon we talked, com
pleted three photo shoots, conducted 11 in-depth, one
on-one interviews, and had the PBS film crew capture it
all.
The man who takes over five minutes to answer a yes
or-no question. The shameless self-promoter who wants
at least 30 minutes of Warholian fame because the stan
dard 15 won't do — each of his sentences the equivalent
of a Faulknerian full-page ad.
He gets on a soapbox to attract people's attention, then
gets mad when people use his own words to refute his
points. Not only does he want to have his cake and eat it
too, he wants to pick the frosting, decide which ingredi
ents go into the mix, and have onlookers comment on
how good it looks.
If it wasn't for all of the talent l>ehind his continued
"Ego-Trippin,' " it would be easy to kick Kris Parker to the
curb. But when it comes to skills, denial would be futile.
In a rap genre that consistently sends its heroes to the
cleaners, he's managed to release seven critically and com
mercially successful albums. His debut effort, "Criminal
Minded," is a virtual work of art; like Eric Band Rakim's
"Paid in Full," it's a standard by which all other rap records
must be measured.
He's appeared on everything from Arsenio Hall to
CNN, toured the world and lectured to packed university
halls. And along with Public Enemy and the Jungle Broth
ers, he introduced black nationalism and Afrocentricity
to rap music. Like he said in almost every interview he's
ever granted, KRS-One is, in many ways, the breathing
personification of hip-hop culture. Few performers em
body all of the rage, cutting edge political commentary,

— KRS-One in "Stop BbT

For Kris Parker, rap music is m off wtfmlPfmst I me
or a money-maker; it's a way of life. He's always
lived it, from bombing trains as a youngster in his
native South Bronx to attending the legendary block par
ties in Bronx River projects where Afrika Bambaataa and
Kool Here used to spin dusty funk records well into the
"patty duke" hours of the morning.
He left home at the tender age of 15 to live on the
streets, ostensibly to "study metaphysics and become the
world's greatest MC." That might be suspect coming from
some people, but there's something about Kris' personal
ity that makes you want to believe him. Even when he lies,
he's does it sincerely.
"It's important to have a vision," Kris quietly remarks,
our conversation momentarily interrupted by a camera
crew and other assorted extras moving to a different area
of the cavernous soundstage he's rented for the day. We're
on the set of his directorial debut, the video "Outta Here,"
during a short break. It's obvious that his days of slim
pickings are behind him — he looks trim, but nowhere
near as gaunt as he did on his first album cover.
"I learned about that when I was 10 years old," he says,
looking off in the corner at his impoverished past. "If you
don't see yourself as something, you'll never be it. So I vi
sualized myself as that and said, 'I want to be the greatest
artist ever in my life,' and I keep that thought even until
today. Even now it's important for me to maintain my
own self-visualization as the greatest rap artist ever, and to
back my shit up. I can't be dilly-dallying."
Kris entered the hip-hop game at a period when it first
began to blossom commercially. Run-DMC had just be
come household names with their legendary album
"Raising Hell" and even the mainstream was starting to
recognize the music as a force to be reckoned with. Adidas
stepped to the group with a merchandising deal, and even
Fred and Barney started rappin' for their "Fruity Pebbles."
But from Parker's perspective as an up-and-coming artist,
the multifaceted aspects of hip-hop culture weren't being
shown.
"When Scott La Rock, D-Nice, Will and 1 came into
this, we felt that rap music wasn't being presented in a
light where it could last," Kris reminisces. Even his favorite
group at the time, Run-DMC, at their zenith didn't fully
bring forth what he considered the "real" shit. "People
were saying about Run-DMC, 'this is rap,' and we were
like 'No, that's Run-DMC, not rap as a whole.'
"We felt as if a crew should come out that represented
the whole culture — breakdancing, graffiti, new styles of
rhymes, etc. While everybody else had four-bar phrases,
we dropped 16 bars. When everyone else was rappin'
about gold chains and beer, we dropped hip-hop reggae

and styles like *9 mm' an«t The Bridge is Over.' " TOg

and 1% a magnetic MC's "Critical Beat
downy pushed rap irl fcrew ?3|rections. The hird-core
prSPffToy IjMUI platform from whidwfc couktfj
project his vigfl(k£reality to theiest of the world. 1 h e
"new school" 's hardeMrod uction style, heavy w
bass kicks and stripped-down lames Brown samples, was
filled with the underground jpt lilt reflected happenings
on the street with breathtaking clirityjjnMfwitts g°t hard
er and the rhyme structures becaqje more complex. But
according to the way Kris sees thingQmfli his Knowledge
Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone moniker, things
happened that way because he came on the scene.
"Before me," he states with supreme overconfidence,
"there was no 'make-you-think' rap record."
What about the Sugar Hill Gang's "The Message," the
song many critics and fans regard as one of the strongest
social commentaries of the early '80s?
"That didn't make me think," he replies nonchalantly.
"It made me say, 'word he knows what I know.' You know,
I'm very conscious of what I represent. I'm not someone
who will sit here and say, 'I don't know how I did this.' I sat
there and I wrote it, and I wrote with the idea that when
you sit down and listen to it, whether you like it or not, it's
nothing you've ever heard before."
I push back my chair and prepare for a lecture; the
largest ego in hip-hop is about to rear its pompous
head. Kris Parker is Jelly Roll Morton in a b-boy
stance, a man who is not shy about proclaiming his great
ness and if challenged, will come correct with such verbal
ferocity that one is hard pressed to disprove him. He's the
kind of rapper that will slip past a lesser MC with stylish
grace, and the next minute slam lyrics hard in his face, all
the while laughing and playing the dozens.
"If you touch that mike against me in a derogatory
manner, you gotta know the rules — I don't care if you're
somebody's mother," Kris booms. His nostrils flare as his
head swells with illusions of grandeur.
"I'm the number-one lyricist in the world. Period. Test
the respect. Whoever disagrees with it, they can meet me
at my next show. My shit is top-notch all the time, it's been
that way for seven years, and it'll be like that for seven
more years."
I ask him if he still considers rap his dog, a pet that fol
lows him around everywhere he goes? While listening, I
can't help but recall Kris' infamous interview with the ed
itor of The Source, where the Blastmaster alienated an en
tire segment of the Hip-hop Nation with the outlandish
comment.
"Yes! Yes! Yes!" he proclaims, beaming with pride. "Lit
erally," he admits between chuckles, "I think I am hip-hop.
I don't do hip-hop, I am hip-hop. KRS-One is the physical
manifestation of hip-hop culture and my music pushed
rap music to its highest levels, I think I've introduced new
things, plus I've rocked the world — literally. I can't see
why anybody would front. Pick an artist. Who has con

tributed more? The only one I can see is Run-DMC, and
the only Lhing they contributed was my doming."
What about Rakim? Big Daddy Kane? LL Cool J?
"1 think Rakim is on the same level in artistic contri
bution," he replies with slight deference to the rapper
many regard as God on a microphone, "but 1 don't think
he's arrogant enittigft to say he's hip-hop. If LL want's to
call himself, 'the baddest rapper in the history of rap it
self,' if that's what he thinks, he's right.
"You have the right to say anything you want in hip
hop. If one person says, 'I'm the greatest thing that ever
walked this planet,' and the next says, 'I'm eight million
deep," now the next guy has to come and say, 'well I'm..
And that's hip-hop. And when we meet onstage, he grabs
the mike and goes for his and I grab the mike and go for
mine. It's up to the listener to look at our track records.
Every time I open my mouth, I'm giving you something
new."
The "Return of the Boom Bap," the Blastmaster's
latest record, is proof positive that KRS-One is a
living legend. His arrogance is astounding, but
then again, so is his music. Once the album's opening
medley registers — with its bits and pieces of "Criminal
Minded," "My Philosophy," "Jack of Spades" and"The
Bridge Is Over" — in one's eardrums, it becomes clear
why Kris regards himself as the Muhammad Ali of verbal
sucka-punching.
"Boom Bap" is Kris' first record in ages where the beats
match the ferocity of his rhymes. Thought provoking
lyrics are augmented by low-ended, straight-up ass
whuppin' funkers by the likes of Kid Capri, Showbiz and
the unstoppable DJ Premier of Gangstarr.
"I Can't Wake Up," is a hilarious scenario where Kris
dreams that he's a marijuana-filled blunt that's passed
around and hit off by the biggest names in hip-hop. As
notables from Cypress Hill to Bubba Clinton takes a toke
(except the Prez doesn't inhale), the running joke almost
slips unnoticed — everyone's getting high off Kris' skills.
From the breathtaking "Sound of the Police," to the
raw a cappella track "Uh Oh," Kris seems unstoppable.
And after the body warming, tantalizing bass of "Brown
Skin Woman" and the energetic bass-bomp of the title
track hits the ears, there's no doubt left. Like it or not,
KRS-One, like your mother's nagging, will never go away.
"What keeps me going," Kris concludes, "is when I'm
walking on the street and somebody comes up to me and
says, 'Yo Kris, you dropped that shit!.' 1 don't care if he
never comes to another one of my shows again, or pays
money for my tape — that acknowledgement is my pay
right there.
"1 could be platinum, but if I don't have you saying
something like that, then I'm in trouble. After you have a
whole bunch of people come out, you can always refer
back to BDP. That's what my album is for, to keep the hip
hop world in focus and to be able to walk down the street.
That's what keeps me going."
Breath control indeed. ■

Breath control
means every
thing to peo-

ple who have a history of

writing verbal checks their rep-

utations can't cash. When not ex-

panding his niche in the urban art

form known as hip-hop, KRS-One,

a.k.a. Kris Parker, tends to lose control in

everyday conversation.

But this unpredictability is why any
event involving rap's self-proclaimed
"Teacher" is that much more exciting. De
pending on his mood, anything can jump
off — a slammin' history lesson as in "Edu
tainment" or a brutal on-stage beatdown, & la

P.M. Dawn.
"Fuck black people," Parker says emphatically. All pre
sent in the small conference room remain still, wondering
what the calmly maniacal individual will say next. Making
direct eye contact from across the solid oak table, Blast
master Kris leans in my direction, driving his point home.

With a frame thatValmostas solid as his Ivrical repu
tatig|, fcris e'ally intimidates those finaccugfljmed to his
lantings and ravings. A PBS film crew, mouths agape,
keeps the tape rolling. Their nucropiKJfies hover overhead
as they film our animated exchange for a documentary
they are miming about a man widdy regarded as a walk
ing, talking contradiction.
"Fuck black people." This statement, taken out of con
text, from one of the artists who pioneered rap Afrocen
tricity, seems to confirm what many other hip-hop writ
ers have whispered in closed-door editorial sessions ail
along; KRS-One is out of his cotton pickin' mind.
"I don't get caught up in pro-black cause that's a false
philosophy," he continues. His voice, slightly raised and
tinged with more than a bit of cynicism, reverberates
from the walls. "Put that in the article too. Fuck that.
'Cause at the end of the day, if you're not thinking like a
human being, it doesn't matter."
Not even 20 minutes after daring — damn near urg
ing — me to print the statement, Kris requests I retract it
from the interview. Joined in sentiment by his BDP Crew
member Willie D, he feels that he might be misinterpret
ed by the black masses, especially after the commercial
failure of his "H.E.A.L." (Human Education Against Lies)
project.
What's said is said, though. He was on the record. He's
the man who, on the August afternoon we talked, com
pleted three photo shoots, conducted 11 in-depth, one
on-one interviews, and had the PBS film crew capture it
all.
The man who takes over five minutes to answer a yes
or-no question. The shameless self-promoter who wants
at least 30 minutes of Warholian fame because the stan
dard 15 won't do — each of his sentences the equivalent
of a Faulknerian full-page ad.
He gets on a soapbox to attract people's attention, then
gets mad when people use his own words to refute his
points. Not only does he want to have his cake and eat it
too, he wants to pick the frosting, decide which ingredi
ents go into the mix, and have onlookers comment on
how good it looks.
If it wasn't for all of the talent l>ehind his continued
"Ego-Trippin,' " it would be easy to kick Kris Parker to the
curb. But when it comes to skills, denial would be futile.
In a rap genre that consistently sends its heroes to the
cleaners, he's managed to release seven critically and com
mercially successful albums. His debut effort, "Criminal
Minded," is a virtual work of art; like Eric Band Rakim's
"Paid in Full," it's a standard by which all other rap records
must be measured.
He's appeared on everything from Arsenio Hall to
CNN, toured the world and lectured to packed university
halls. And along with Public Enemy and the Jungle Broth
ers, he introduced black nationalism and Afrocentricity
to rap music. Like he said in almost every interview he's
ever granted, KRS-One is, in many ways, the breathing
personification of hip-hop culture. Few performers em

— KRS-One in "Stop BbT

For Kris Parker, rap music is m off wtfmlPfmst I me
or a money-maker; it's a way of life. He's always
lived it, from bombing trains as a youngster in his
native South Bronx to attending the legendary block par
ties in Bronx River projects where Afrika Bambaataa and
Kool Here used to spin dusty funk records well into the
"patty duke" hours of the morning.
He left home at the tender age of 15 to live on the
streets, ostensibly to "study metaphysics and become the
world's greatest MC." That might be suspect coming from
some people, but there's something about Kris' personal
ity that makes you want to believe him. Even when he lies,
he's does it sincerely.
"It's important to have a vision," Kris quietly remarks,
our conversation momentarily interrupted by a camera
crew and other assorted extras moving to a different area
of the cavernous soundstage he's rented for the day. We're
on the set of his directorial debut, the video "Outta Here,"
during a short break. It's obvious that his days of slim
pickings are behind him — he looks trim, but nowhere
near as gaunt as he did on his first album cover.
"I learned about that when I was 10 years old," he says,
looking off in the corner at his impoverished past. "If you
don't see yourself as something, you'll never be it. So I vi
sualized myself as that and said, 'I want to be the greatest
artist ever in my life,' and I keep that thought even until
today. Even now it's important for me to maintain my
own self-visualization as the greatest rap artist ever, and to
back my shit up. I can't be dilly-dallying."
Kris entered the hip-hop game at a period when it first
began to blossom commercially. Run-DMC had just be
come household names with their legendary album
"Raising Hell" and even the mainstream was starting to
recognize the music as a force to be reckoned with. Adidas
stepped to the group with a merchandising deal, and even
Fred and Barney started rappin' for their "Fruity Pebbles."
But from Parker's perspective as an up-and-coming artist,
the multifaceted aspects of hip-hop culture weren't being
shown.
"When Scott La Rock, D-Nice, Will and 1 came into
this, we felt that rap music wasn't being presented in a
light where it could last," Kris reminisces. Even his favorite
group at the time, Run-DMC, at their zenith didn't fully
bring forth what he considered the "real" shit. "People
were saying about Run-DMC, 'this is rap,' and we were
like 'No, that's Run-DMC, not rap as a whole.'
"We felt as if a crew should come out that represented
the whole culture — breakdancing, graffiti, new styles of
rhymes, etc. While everybody else had four-bar phrases,
we dropped 16 bars. When everyone else was rappin'
about gold chains and beer, we dropped hip-hop reggae

and styles like *9 mm' an«t The Bridge is Over.' " TOg

and 1% a magnetic MC's "Critical Beat

bass kicks and stripped-down lames Brown samples, was
filled with the underground jpt lilt reflected happenings
on the street with breathtaking clirityjjnMfwitts g°t hard
er and the rhyme structures becaqje more complex. But
according to the way Kris sees thingQmfli his Knowledge
Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone moniker, things
happened that way because he came on the scene.
"Before me," he states with supreme overconfidence,
"there was no 'make-you-think' rap record."
What about the Sugar Hill Gang's "The Message," the
song many critics and fans regard as one of the strongest
social commentaries of the early '80s?
"That didn't make me think," he replies nonchalantly.
"It made me say, 'word he knows what I know.' You know,
I'm very conscious of what I represent. I'm not someone
who will sit here and say, 'I don't know how I did this.' I sat
there and I wrote it, and I wrote with the idea that when
you sit down and listen to it, whether you like it or not, it's
nothing you've ever heard before."
I push back my chair and prepare for a lecture; the
largest ego in hip-hop is about to rear its pompous
head. Kris Parker is Jelly Roll Morton in a b-boy
stance, a man who is not shy about proclaiming his great
ness and if challenged, will come correct with such verbal
ferocity that one is hard pressed to disprove him. He's the
kind of rapper that will slip past a lesser MC with stylish
grace, and the next minute slam lyrics hard in his face, all
the while laughing and playing the dozens.
"If you touch that mike against me in a derogatory
manner, you gotta know the rules — I don't care if you're
somebody's mother," Kris booms. His nostrils flare as his
head swells with illusions of grandeur.
"I'm the number-one lyricist in the world. Period. Test
the respect. Whoever disagrees with it, they can meet me
at my next show. My shit is top-notch all the time, it's been
that way for seven years, and it'll be like that for seven
more years."
I ask him if he still considers rap his dog, a pet that fol
lows him around everywhere he goes? While listening, I
can't help but recall Kris' infamous interview with the ed
itor of The Source, where the Blastmaster alienated an en
tire segment of the Hip-hop Nation with the outlandish
comment.
"Yes! Yes! Yes!" he proclaims, beaming with pride. "Lit
erally," he admits between chuckles, "I think I am hip-hop.
I don't do hip-hop, I am hip-hop. KRS-One is the physical
manifestation of hip-hop culture and my music pushed
rap music to its highest levels, I think I've introduced new
things, plus I've rocked the world — literally. I can't see
why anybody would front. Pick an artist. Who has con

tributed more? The only one I can see is Run-DMC, and
the only Lhing they contributed was my doming."
What about Rakim? Big Daddy Kane? LL Cool J?
"1 think Rakim is on the same level in artistic contri
bution," he replies with slight deference to the rapper
many regard as God on a microphone, "but 1 don't think
he's arrogant enittigft to say he's hip-hop. If LL want's to
call himself, 'the baddest rapper in the history of rap it
self,' if that's what he thinks, he's right.
"You have the right to say anything you want in hip
hop. If one person says, 'I'm the greatest thing that ever
walked this planet,' and the next says, 'I'm eight million
deep," now the next guy has to come and say, 'well I'm..
And that's hip-hop. And when we meet onstage, he grabs
the mike and goes for his and I grab the mike and go for
mine. It's up to the listener to look at our track records.
Every time I open my mouth, I'm giving you something
new."
The "Return of the Boom Bap," the Blastmaster's
latest record, is proof positive that KRS-One is a
living legend. His arrogance is astounding, but
then again, so is his music. Once the album's opening
medley registers — with its bits and pieces of "Criminal
Minded," "My Philosophy," "Jack of Spades" and"The
Bridge Is Over" — in one's eardrums, it becomes clear
why Kris regards himself as the Muhammad Ali of verbal
sucka-punching.
"Boom Bap" is Kris' first record in ages where the beats
match the ferocity of his rhymes. Thought provoking
lyrics are augmented by low-ended, straight-up ass
whuppin' funkers by the likes of Kid Capri, Showbiz and
the unstoppable DJ Premier of Gangstarr.
"I Can't Wake Up," is a hilarious scenario where Kris
dreams that he's a marijuana-filled blunt that's passed
around and hit off by the biggest names in hip-hop. As
notables from Cypress Hill to Bubba Clinton takes a toke
(except the Prez doesn't inhale), the running joke almost
slips unnoticed — everyone's getting high off Kris' skills.
From the breathtaking "Sound of the Police," to the
raw a cappella track "Uh Oh," Kris seems unstoppable.
And after the body warming, tantalizing bass of "Brown
Skin Woman" and the energetic bass-bomp of the title
track hits the ears, there's no doubt left. Like it or not,
KRS-One, like your mother's nagging, will never go away.
"What keeps me going," Kris concludes, "is when I'm
walking on the street and somebody comes up to me and
says, 'Yo Kris, you dropped that shit!.' 1 don't care if he
never comes to another one of my shows again, or pays
money for my tape — that acknowledgement is my pay
right there.
"1 could be platinum, but if I don't have you saying
something like that, then I'm in trouble. After you have a
whole bunch of people come out, you can always refer
back to BDP. That's what my album is for, to keep the hip
hop world in focus and to be able to walk down the street.
That's what keeps me going."
Breath control indeed. ■

as they film our animated exchange for a documentary
they are miming about a man widdy regarded as a walk
ing, talking contradiction.
"Fuck black people." This statement, taken out of con
text, from one of the artists who pioneered rap Afrocen
tricity, seems to confirm what many other hip-hop writ
ers have whispered in closed-door editorial sessions ail
along; KRS-One is out of his cotton pickin' mind.
"I don't get caught up in pro-black cause that's a false
philosophy," he continues. His voice, slightly raised and
tinged with more than a bit of cynicism, reverberates
from the walls. "Put that in the article too. Fuck that.
'Cause at the end of the day, if you're not thinking like a
human being, it doesn't matter."
Not even 20 minutes after daring — damn near urg
ing — me to print the statement, Kris requests I retract it
from the interview. Joined in sentiment by his BDP Crew
member Willie D, he feels that he might be misinterpret
ed by the black masses, especially after the commercial
failure of his "H.E.A.L." (Human Education Against Lies)
project.
What's said is said, though. He was on the record. He's
the man who, on the August afternoon we talked, com
pleted three photo shoots, conducted 11 in-depth, one
on-one interviews, and had the PBS film crew capture it
all.
The man who takes over five minutes to answer a yes
or-no question. The shameless self-promoter who wants
at least 30 minutes of Warholian fame because the stan
dard 15 won't do — each of his sentences the equivalent
of a Faulknerian full-page ad.
He gets on a soapbox to attract people's attention, then
gets mad when people use his own words to refute his
points. Not only does he want to have his cake and eat it
too, he wants to pick the frosting, decide which ingredi
ents go into the mix, and have onlookers comment on
how good it looks.
If it wasn't for all of the talent l>ehind his continued
"Ego-Trippin,' " it would be easy to kick Kris Parker to the
curb. But when it comes to skills, denial would be futile.
In a rap genre that consistently sends its heroes to the
cleaners, he's managed to release seven critically and com
mercially successful albums. His debut effort, "Criminal
Minded," is a virtual work of art; like Eric Band Rakim's
"Paid in Full," it's a standard by which all other rap records
must be measured.
He's appeared on everything from Arsenio Hall to
CNN, toured the world and lectured to packed university
halls. And along with Public Enemy and the Jungle Broth
ers, he introduced black nationalism and Afrocentricity
to rap music. Like he said in almost every interview he's
ever granted, KRS-One is, in many ways, the breathing
personification of hip-hop culture. Few performers em

You Wanna know what the problem with mc is? / take thp>*
hip-hop shit too serious. A
— KRS-One in "Stop BbT
trfr'
For Kris Parker, rap music is m off wtfmlPfmst I me
or a money-maker; it's a way of life. He's always
lived it, from bombing trains as a youngster in his
native South Bronx to attending the legendary block par
ties in Bronx River projects where Afrika Bambaataa and
Kool Here used to spin dusty funk records well into the
"patty duke" hours of the morning.
He left home at the tender age of 15 to live on the
streets, ostensibly to "study metaphysics and become the
world's greatest MC." That might be suspect coming from
some people, but there's something about Kris' personal
ity that makes you want to believe him. Even when he lies,
he's does it sincerely.
"It's important to have a vision," Kris quietly remarks,
our conversation momentarily interrupted by a camera
crew and other assorted extras moving to a different area
of the cavernous soundstage he's rented for the day. We're
on the set of his directorial debut, the video "Outta Here,"
during a short break. It's obvious that his days of slim
pickings are behind him — he looks trim, but nowhere
near as gaunt as he did on his first album cover.
"I learned about that when I was 10 years old," he says,
looking off in the corner at his impoverished past. "If you
don't see yourself as something, you'll never be it. So I vi
sualized myself as that and said, 'I want to be the greatest
artist ever in my life,' and I keep that thought even until
today. Even now it's important for me to maintain my
own self-visualization as the greatest rap artist ever, and to
back my shit up. I can't be dilly-dallying."
Kris entered the hip-hop game at a period when it first
began to blossom commercially. Run-DMC had just be
come household names with their legendary album
"Raising Hell" and even the mainstream was starting to
recognize the music as a force to be reckoned with. Adidas
stepped to the group with a merchandising deal, and even
Fred and Barney started rappin' for their "Fruity Pebbles."
But from Parker's perspective as an up-and-coming artist,
the multifaceted aspects of hip-hop culture weren't being
shown.
"When Scott La Rock, D-Nice, Will and 1 came into
this, we felt that rap music wasn't being presented in a
light where it could last," Kris reminisces. Even his favorite
group at the time, Run-DMC, at their zenith didn't fully
bring forth what he considered the "real" shit. "People
were saying about Run-DMC, 'this is rap,' and we were
like 'No, that's Run-DMC, not rap as a whole.'
"We felt as if a crew should come out that represented
the whole culture — breakdancing, graffiti, new styles of
rhymes, etc. While everybody else had four-bar phrases,
we dropped 16 bars. When everyone else was rappin'
about gold chains and beer, we dropped hip-hop reggae

and styles like *9 mm' an«t The Bridge is Over.' " TOg

and 1% a magnetic MC's "Critical Beat

bass kicks and stripped-down lames Brown samples, was
filled with the underground jpt lilt reflected happenings
on the street with breathtaking clirityjjnMfwitts g°t hard
er and the rhyme structures becaqje more complex. But
according to the way Kris sees thingQmfli his Knowledge
Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone moniker, things
happened that way because he came on the scene.
"Before me," he states with supreme overconfidence,
"there was no 'make-you-think' rap record."
What about the Sugar Hill Gang's "The Message," the
song many critics and fans regard as one of the strongest
social commentaries of the early '80s?
"That didn't make me think," he replies nonchalantly.
"It made me say, 'word he knows what I know.' You know,
I'm very conscious of what I represent. I'm not someone
who will sit here and say, 'I don't know how I did this.' I sat
there and I wrote it, and I wrote with the idea that when
you sit down and listen to it, whether you like it or not, it's
nothing you've ever heard before."
I push back my chair and prepare for a lecture; the
largest ego in hip-hop is about to rear its pompous
head. Kris Parker is Jelly Roll Morton in a b-boy
stance, a man who is not shy about proclaiming his great
ness and if challenged, will come correct with such verbal
ferocity that one is hard pressed to disprove him. He's the
kind of rapper that will slip past a lesser MC with stylish
grace, and the next minute slam lyrics hard in his face, all
the while laughing and playing the dozens.
"If you touch that mike against me in a derogatory
manner, you gotta know the rules — I don't care if you're
somebody's mother," Kris booms. His nostrils flare as his
head swells with illusions of grandeur.
"I'm the number-one lyricist in the world. Period. Test
the respect. Whoever disagrees with it, they can meet me
at my next show. My shit is top-notch all the time, it's been
that way for seven years, and it'll be like that for seven
more years."
I ask him if he still considers rap his dog, a pet that fol
lows him around everywhere he goes? While listening, I
can't help but recall Kris' infamous interview with the ed
itor of The Source, where the Blastmaster alienated an en
tire segment of the Hip-hop Nation with the outlandish
comment.
"Yes! Yes! Yes!" he proclaims, beaming with pride. "Lit
erally," he admits between chuckles, "I think I am hip-hop.
I don't do hip-hop, I am hip-hop. KRS-One is the physical
manifestation of hip-hop culture and my music pushed
rap music to its highest levels, I think I've introduced new
things, plus I've rocked the world — literally. I can't see
why anybody would front. Pick an artist. Who has con

tributed more? The only one I can see is Run-DMC, and
the only Lhing they contributed was my doming."
What about Rakim? Big Daddy Kane? LL Cool J?
"1 think Rakim is on the same level in artistic contri
bution," he replies with slight deference to the rapper
many regard as God on a microphone, "but 1 don't think
he's arrogant enittigft to say he's hip-hop. If LL want's to
call himself, 'the baddest rapper in the history of rap it
self,' if that's what he thinks, he's right.
"You have the right to say anything you want in hip
hop. If one person says, 'I'm the greatest thing that ever
walked this planet,' and the next says, 'I'm eight million
deep," now the next guy has to come and say, 'well I'm..
And that's hip-hop. And when we meet onstage, he grabs
the mike and goes for his and I grab the mike and go for
mine. It's up to the listener to look at our track records.
Every time I open my mouth, I'm giving you something
new."
The "Return of the Boom Bap," the Blastmaster's
latest record, is proof positive that KRS-One is a
living legend. His arrogance is astounding, but
then again, so is his music. Once the album's opening
medley registers — with its bits and pieces of "Criminal
Minded," "My Philosophy," "Jack of Spades" and"The
Bridge Is Over" — in one's eardrums, it becomes clear
why Kris regards himself as the Muhammad Ali of verbal
sucka-punching.
"Boom Bap" is Kris' first record in ages where the beats
match the ferocity of his rhymes. Thought provoking
lyrics are augmented by low-ended, straight-up ass
whuppin' funkers by the likes of Kid Capri, Showbiz and
the unstoppable DJ Premier of Gangstarr.
"I Can't Wake Up," is a hilarious scenario where Kris
dreams that he's a marijuana-filled blunt that's passed
around and hit off by the biggest names in hip-hop. As
notables from Cypress Hill to Bubba Clinton takes a toke
(except the Prez doesn't inhale), the running joke almost
slips unnoticed — everyone's getting high off Kris' skills.
From the breathtaking "Sound of the Police," to the
raw a cappella track "Uh Oh," Kris seems unstoppable.
And after the body warming, tantalizing bass of "Brown
Skin Woman" and the energetic bass-bomp of the title
track hits the ears, there's no doubt left. Like it or not,
KRS-One, like your mother's nagging, will never go away.
"What keeps me going," Kris concludes, "is when I'm
walking on the street and somebody comes up to me and
says, 'Yo Kris, you dropped that shit!.' 1 don't care if he
never comes to another one of my shows again, or pays
money for my tape — that acknowledgement is my pay
right there.
"1 could be platinum, but if I don't have you saying
something like that, then I'm in trouble. After you have a
whole bunch of people come out, you can always refer
back to BDP. That's what my album is for, to keep the hip
hop world in focus and to be able to walk down the street.
That's what keeps me going."
Breath control indeed. ■

failure of his "H.E.A.L." (Human Education Against Lies)
project.
What's said is said, though. He was on the record. He's
the man who, on the August afternoon we talked, com
pleted three photo shoots, conducted 11 in-depth, one
on-one interviews, and had the PBS film crew capture it
all.
The man who takes over five minutes to answer a yes
or-no question. The shameless self-promoter who wants
at least 30 minutes of Warholian fame because the stan
dard 15 won't do — each of his sentences the equivalent
of a Faulknerian full-page ad.
He gets on a soapbox to attract people's attention, then
gets mad when people use his own words to refute his
points. Not only does he want to have his cake and eat it
too, he wants to pick the frosting, decide which ingredi
ents go into the mix, and have onlookers comment on
how good it looks.
If it wasn't for all of the talent l>ehind his continued
"Ego-Trippin,' " it would be easy to kick Kris Parker to the
curb. But when it comes to skills, denial would be futile.
In a rap genre that consistently sends its heroes to the
cleaners, he's managed to release seven critically and com
mercially successful albums. His debut effort, "Criminal
Minded," is a virtual work of art; like Eric Band Rakim's
"Paid in Full," it's a standard by which all other rap records
must be measured.
He's appeared on everything from Arsenio Hall to
CNN, toured the world and lectured to packed university
halls. And along with Public Enemy and the Jungle Broth
ers, he introduced black nationalism and Afrocentricity
to rap music. Like he said in almost every interview he's
ever granted, KRS-One is, in many ways, the breathing
personification of hip-hop culture. Few performers em

For Kris Parker, rap music is m off wtfmlPfmst I me
or a money-maker; it's a way of life. He's always
lived it, from bombing trains as a youngster in his
native South Bronx to attending the legendary block par
ties in Bronx River projects where Afrika Bambaataa and
Kool Here used to spin dusty funk records well into the
"patty duke" hours of the morning.
He left home at the tender age of 15 to live on the
streets, ostensibly to "study metaphysics and become the
world's greatest MC." That might be suspect coming from
some people, but there's something about Kris' personal
ity that makes you want to believe him. Even when he lies,
he's does it sincerely.
"It's important to have a vision," Kris quietly remarks,
our conversation momentarily interrupted by a camera
crew and other assorted extras moving to a different area
of the cavernous soundstage he's rented for the day. We're
on the set of his directorial debut, the video "Outta Here,"
during a short break. It's obvious that his days of slim
pickings are behind him — he looks trim, but nowhere
near as gaunt as he did on his first album cover.
"I learned about that when I was 10 years old," he says,
looking off in the corner at his impoverished past. "If you
don't see yourself as something, you'll never be it. So I vi
sualized myself as that and said, 'I want to be the greatest
artist ever in my life,' and I keep that thought even until
today. Even now it's important for me to maintain my
own self-visualization as the greatest rap artist ever, and to
back my shit up. I can't be dilly-dallying."
Kris entered the hip-hop game at a period when it first
began to blossom commercially. Run-DMC had just be
come household names with their legendary album
"Raising Hell" and even the mainstream was starting to
recognize the music as a force to be reckoned with. Adidas
stepped to the group with a merchandising deal, and even
Fred and Barney started rappin' for their "Fruity Pebbles."
But from Parker's perspective as an up-and-coming artist,
the multifaceted aspects of hip-hop culture weren't being
shown.
"When Scott La Rock, D-Nice, Will and 1 came into
this, we felt that rap music wasn't being presented in a
light where it could last," Kris reminisces. Even his favorite
group at the time, Run-DMC, at their zenith didn't fully
bring forth what he considered the "real" shit. "People
were saying about Run-DMC, 'this is rap,' and we were
like 'No, that's Run-DMC, not rap as a whole.'
"We felt as if a crew should come out that represented
the whole culture — breakdancing, graffiti, new styles of
rhymes, etc. While everybody else had four-bar phrases,
we dropped 16 bars. When everyone else was rappin'
about gold chains and beer, we dropped hip-hop reggae

and styles like *9 mm' an«t The Bridge is Over.' " TOg

er and the rhyme structures becaqje more complex. But
according to the way Kris sees thingQmfli his Knowledge
Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone moniker, things
happened that way because he came on the scene.
"Before me," he states with supreme overconfidence,
"there was no 'make-you-think' rap record."
What about the Sugar Hill Gang's "The Message," the
song many critics and fans regard as one of the strongest
social commentaries of the early '80s?
"That didn't make me think," he replies nonchalantly.
"It made me say, 'word he knows what I know.' You know,
I'm very conscious of what I represent. I'm not someone
who will sit here and say, 'I don't know how I did this.' I sat
there and I wrote it, and I wrote with the idea that when
you sit down and listen to it, whether you like it or not, it's
nothing you've ever heard before."
I push back my chair and prepare for a lecture; the
largest ego in hip-hop is about to rear its pompous
head. Kris Parker is Jelly Roll Morton in a b-boy
stance, a man who is not shy about proclaiming his great
ness and if challenged, will come correct with such verbal
ferocity that one is hard pressed to disprove him. He's the
kind of rapper that will slip past a lesser MC with stylish
grace, and the next minute slam lyrics hard in his face, all
the while laughing and playing the dozens.
"If you touch that mike against me in a derogatory
manner, you gotta know the rules — I don't care if you're
somebody's mother," Kris booms. His nostrils flare as his
head swells with illusions of grandeur.
"I'm the number-one lyricist in the world. Period. Test
the respect. Whoever disagrees with it, they can meet me
at my next show. My shit is top-notch all the time, it's been
that way for seven years, and it'll be like that for seven
more years."
I ask him if he still considers rap his dog, a pet that fol
lows him around everywhere he goes? While listening, I
can't help but recall Kris' infamous interview with the ed
itor of The Source, where the Blastmaster alienated an en
tire segment of the Hip-hop Nation with the outlandish
comment.
"Yes! Yes! Yes!" he proclaims, beaming with pride. "Lit
erally," he admits between chuckles, "I think I am hip-hop.
I don't do hip-hop, I am hip-hop. KRS-One is the physical
manifestation of hip-hop culture and my music pushed
rap music to its highest levels, I think I've introduced new
things, plus I've rocked the world — literally. I can't see
why anybody would front. Pick an artist. Who has con

tributed more? The only one I can see is Run-DMC, and
the only Lhing they contributed was my doming."
What about Rakim? Big Daddy Kane? LL Cool J?
"1 think Rakim is on the same level in artistic contri
bution," he replies with slight deference to the rapper
many regard as God on a microphone, "but 1 don't think
he's arrogant enittigft to say he's hip-hop. If LL want's to
call himself, 'the baddest rapper in the history of rap it
self,' if that's what he thinks, he's right.
"You have the right to say anything you want in hip
hop. If one person says, 'I'm the greatest thing that ever
walked this planet,' and the next says, 'I'm eight million
deep," now the next guy has to come and say, 'well I'm..
And that's hip-hop. And when we meet onstage, he grabs
the mike and goes for his and I grab the mike and go for
mine. It's up to the listener to look at our track records.
Every time I open my mouth, I'm giving you something
new."
The "Return of the Boom Bap," the Blastmaster's
latest record, is proof positive that KRS-One is a
living legend. His arrogance is astounding, but
then again, so is his music. Once the album's opening
medley registers — with its bits and pieces of "Criminal
Minded," "My Philosophy," "Jack of Spades" and"The
Bridge Is Over" — in one's eardrums, it becomes clear
why Kris regards himself as the Muhammad Ali of verbal
sucka-punching.
"Boom Bap" is Kris' first record in ages where the beats
match the ferocity of his rhymes. Thought provoking
lyrics are augmented by low-ended, straight-up ass
whuppin' funkers by the likes of Kid Capri, Showbiz and
the unstoppable DJ Premier of Gangstarr.
"I Can't Wake Up," is a hilarious scenario where Kris
dreams that he's a marijuana-filled blunt that's passed
around and hit off by the biggest names in hip-hop. As
notables from Cypress Hill to Bubba Clinton takes a toke
(except the Prez doesn't inhale), the running joke almost
slips unnoticed — everyone's getting high off Kris' skills.
From the breathtaking "Sound of the Police," to the
raw a cappella track "Uh Oh," Kris seems unstoppable.
And after the body warming, tantalizing bass of "Brown
Skin Woman" and the energetic bass-bomp of the title
track hits the ears, there's no doubt left. Like it or not,
KRS-One, like your mother's nagging, will never go away.
"What keeps me going," Kris concludes, "is when I'm
walking on the street and somebody comes up to me and
says, 'Yo Kris, you dropped that shit!.' 1 don't care if he
never comes to another one of my shows again, or pays
money for my tape — that acknowledgement is my pay
right there.
"1 could be platinum, but if I don't have you saying
something like that, then I'm in trouble. After you have a
whole bunch of people come out, you can always refer
back to BDP. That's what my album is for, to keep the hip
hop world in focus and to be able to walk down the street.
That's what keeps me going."
Breath control indeed. ■
