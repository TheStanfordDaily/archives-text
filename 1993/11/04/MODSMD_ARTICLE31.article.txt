## History foils love in Kaige's 'Farewell My Concubine' 
### 
It's difficult for us to see things clearly in
"Farewell My Concubine." Scenes are shot
through fire, gauze, smoke, windows, fish
bowls and rice-paper doors, making images
as fluid and ever-changing as the political sit
uation in China over the film's 52-year span.
Director Chen Kaige's visual metaphor is par
ticuarly apt: the two main characters have
been raised from childhood for a life of per
formance in the Peking Opera — but the
tragedies of history keep getting in the way.

The film opens in 1977, a year after the end
of the Cultural Revolution. Two men in full
opera dress walk through a deserted stadium in
Peking. An elderly caretaker recognizes them as
Cheng Dieyi (Leslie Cheung) and Duan Xi
aolou (Zhang Fengyi), men whom he idolized
in his youth for their renowned performances
in the opera "Farewell My Concubine " The two
haven't seen each other in 11 years, ostensibly
due to the Cultural Revolution.
The story goes back to 1925, where Dieyi's

mother, a prostitute, abandons her son to
opera schoolmaster Guan of the All Luck and
Happiness Academy. Like a Dickensian Rin
gling Bros, circus, Guan trains the students
brutally and disciplines them even worse;
contrary to its name, there is little happiness
and even less luck in this club, as the children
are shaped and molded into the roles they will
play for a lifetime.
Dieyi is trained for female roles because of
his delicate good looks, while Xiaolou takes
on the masculine, warrior parts. The pair's
specialty, "Concubine," centers on a king
whose concubine refuses to leave him when
all is lost, killing herself only when the end is
near. By the time they leave the academy to
become star performers, Dieyi has fallen in
love with Xiaolou; blurring fantasy and reali
ty, he insists that their real lives mirror the
opera. So when Xiaolou marries prostitute
luxian (Gong Li), it creates a rift between the
partners with long-lasting repercussions.
Dieyi strives to focus on his art, but 20th
century Chinese history won't be denied. The
Warlords' control of Peking in 1925, the
Japanese invasion in 1937 and their subse
quent surrender at the end of World War 11,
the rule of the Nationalist Government, the
Chinese civil war, the communists' victory in
1949 and finally, the Cultural Revolution —
all conspire against the three points of the
film's bizarre love triangle. Dieyi saves Xi
aolou from the Japanese at Juxian's request,
Xiaolou saves Dieyi from the Nationalists and
Juxian nurses Dieyi through his opium addic

tion — only to see the trio betray one anoth
er during the Cultural Revolution.
This is history written with a flamethrow
er, and Kaige's adaptation of Lillian Lee's
novel is more than up to the task. He directs
intimate moments and chaotic crowd scenes
with equal skill, combining the styles of
Zhang Yimou ("Ju Dou") and John Woo
("The Killer") to great effect. All the staples of
melodrama — suicide, miscarriage, court
room trials — are trotted out, but since they
are grounded in the lives of three such com
plex characters, they avoid banality. And by
placing the characters against the tumultuous
backdrop of Chinese history, Kaige gives them
a relevance and vitality that "Age of Inno
cence" and "M. Butterfly" would kill for.
His cast acts in a theatrical style that fits the
operatic material without forsaking any of
their characters' complexities. Fengyi gives
Xiaolou an imperious sense of right and
wrong that fits the king he plays, only to have
it stripped from him in the Cultural Revolu
tion. But his two "concubines" shine the
brightest: Gong Li digs beyond Juxian's ma
nipulativeness to find a fierce heart of gold,
while Cheung revels in Dieyi's bitchy devo
tion to his king in a performance that haunts
us long after the lights come up. In an age
where critically acclaimed literary adapta
tions prompt innocently uncritical raves, & la
"The Joy Luck Club"and "Short Cuts," Chen
Kaige has crafted in "Farewell My Concu
bine" a film for the ages.
