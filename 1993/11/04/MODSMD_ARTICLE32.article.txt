"Fatal Instinct" — the name of the film
alone inspires considerable trepidation.
Let's face it; after a few years of movies like
"The Naked Gun," "Hot Shots" and "Loaded
Weapon," the parody of a tired genre has be
come a tired genre in and of itself. But despite
the fatigue of the genre, its newest film is a
comedic romp surprisingly full of energy.
After a slow start, "Instinct" heads into the
trend of sophomoric humor that can always be
appreciated — given the right state of mind.
The film features Armand Assante as Ned
Ravine, cop by night, defense lawyer by day. His
wife Lana, played by Oscar nominee Kate Nelli
gan, is sleeping with the mechanic and plotting
to kill Ned for the ever-popular insurance
money. Sean Young is Lola Cain, a seductive

femme fatale who, after
a "brief and torrid af
fair" with Ravine,
stalks him with her
trusty icepick / lighter.
Completing this love
square is Sherilyn Fenn
as Laura, Ravine's be
leaguered secretary, se
cretly enamored of her
boss.
One odd aspect of
"Fatal Instinct" is that
its stars all have reputa-

tions as sterling "serious" actors rather than
comedic geniuses. But they are obviously hav
ing a good laugh at themselves and having a
good time with their parts. The role of Lola is
especially played up by Young, who is widely
known for allegedly stalking James Woods a few
years ago after a "brief and torrid" on-set affair.
Although writer David O'Malley repeatedly
takes jabs at both "Basic Instinct" and "Fatal
Attraction" (yes, there is a no-panties reference
and a gratuitous rodent), "Instinct" is not a di
rect parody of either. Instead, O'Malley and di
rector Carl Reiner borrow from a variety of
sources. For example, all of the female charac
ters have their roots in 1940s film noir. In addi
tion, there are numerous references to films
such as "Sleeping With the Enemy," "Cape
Fear" and "Chinatown" — just to name a few.
While many allusions were humorous, the
sheer number was overwhelming at times.
The film's other major flaw is its parody of
an inappropriate subject. In a flashback scene
reminiscent of "Sleeping With the Enemy,"
Fenn sports a black eye while her husband goes
ballistic because the towels are out of place.
Some subjects just can't — and shouldn't —
become comedic.
With that exception, "Fatal Instinct" is a
parody of the first order, pulling out enough
one-liners and visual comedy to awaken the
sleeping genre of silliness.
It almost makes me want to see "Jurassic
Fugitive."
