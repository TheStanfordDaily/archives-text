# Remains of the Day
## 
### 
Let us sing and praise the name of An
thony Hopkins, whose performance in
"The Remains of the Day" will stun you and
leave you in a quivering shambles. Desire,
love and fear dance across his face while he
tries to maintain proper English restraint,
torn between what he believes and what he
so dearly wants.
It's an unmatchable performance, and
though we must applaud the unstoppable
duo of James Ivory and Ismael Merchant,
it's Hopkins who occupies most of the film's
time. The actor manages effortlessly to in
fuse the most innocuous lines with whatev
er emotions he wills.
As the consummate butler at a stately
though somewhat desolate English manor,
Hopkins plays Stevens, the paragon of ser
vice, dignity and blind obedience, a*true
samurai who finds meaning only in his total
and unquestioning loyalty to his master.
Enter Emma Thompson, as an idealistic
and feeling housekeeper, and the swirling
events leading to the Second World War,
and Stevens suddenly finds that his code of
butlery crumbling around him.
"I prefer to keep things as they are,"
Stevens says early in the film, and in a sense,
very little actually changes from beginning
to end. But in a deeper sense, we see in his
expressions and movements the conflict,

pain and emotional anguish he endures,
though again and again he returns to his
only refuge — his role as the faithful
manservant. It is a testimony to Hopkins'
amazing performance that we do not dis
miss him as a callous, anal tightwad because
of his moral and emotional failings; rather
we hope that he'll allow himself to be the de
cent person we know him to be.
Unlike "Howard's End," which was more
of an ensemble piece, "The Remains of the
Day" is focused and strides along where the
former occasionally puttered about. All of
the actors turn in fine performances (in
cluding former Superman Christopher
Reeve), but it's Hopkins who shows his love
and hurt without uttering a word, provid
ing the very definition of acting.
Don't wait for the video, because a per
formance of this caliber demands only the
silverest of screens.
