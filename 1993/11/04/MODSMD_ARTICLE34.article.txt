## Pearl Jam's 'Vs.' sets course for a brave old world 
### 
For all of you grungeoid alternative-types
who think that listening to Pearl Jam will ad
vance your membership into the hallowed
grounds of coolness, wake up. Pearl Jam is a
mainstream band. They just don't suck like
most other mainstreamers.
But on the same note, all of you who think
Pearl Jam is nothing but a load of processed,
commercial doody, snap out of it. Pearl Jam
is loaded with talent and skill that most un
derground thrash-thugs could only dream
about.
That leaves Pearl Jam's latest release, "Vs.,"
misunderstood by most of their potential au
dience — which is a feat respectable enough
to warrant their latest album's emission from
my speakers during most of my in-dorm
hours.
As in their previous album "Ten," the
most striking aspect of "Vs." is Eddie Ved
der's vocals. Even though the instrumental
aspects are undoubtedly excellent, without
Vedder's baritone howls Pearl Jam would be
in, well, a jam. Basically, if you put Vedder,
Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, Alice in Chains' Lane
Staley and Soundgarden's Chris Cornell in a
boxing ring, Eddie's epiglottis alone would
kick flannel all over the place.
"Vs." is scattered with some new-found
funk as bassist Jeff Ament and drummer
Dave Abbruzzese lay it down stronger
than on their previous stab. "W.M.A.," an
other installment in the music world's re
cent tribute to law enforcement, is held up
by rolling drum-beats, and the opening
track, "Go," is ushered in with a thickly
bubbling bass.
Perhaps the most funked-up shanty on
the album is "Glorified G." A catchy song

prodding the sanity behind gun use, "Glori
fied G" opens up sounding dangerously sim
ilar to a Spin Doctors tune — clean up the
guitar a bit and then all you need is a scraggly
beard and a Lois Lane fetish.
Vedder's scratchy übervocals, though, in
stantly change the picture, and all that's keep
ing this song down is its gratuitous message.
If the refrain was changed from "Glorified
version of a pellet gun" to say, "Glorified vir
gin and a pelican," then it might make the
whole endeavor a bit more exciting and re
spectable.
Things do get a bit fired up with the wah
wah guitar licks and pounding percussion of
"Blood," and then hit the other side of the
spectrum with "Elderly Woman Behind the
Counter in a Small Town." A song that is
right up there with any folk-charged charac
ter bits, it packs an umph and portrays a
depth that would go unnoticed by many-a-
Doc Martined suburbanite.
"Daughter" is a track that is reminiscent
of the bridge from "Ten" 's "Alive," with "Dis
sident" and the emotionally distraut
"Rearviewmirror" maintaining that same
type of tradition as solid, well-built tunes.
The only question that seems to blare out
from them, though, is does anything pleasant
happen in Seattle? 1 mean, I understand the
drizzled-out, caffeine-fueled thing, but the
more up-beat side of existence never man
ages to show its face on the album. Do these
guys ever laugh?
Also missing from "Vs." is the enthusiasm
of my favorite P.J. song, the "Singles" sound
track's "State of Love and Trust." This is
somewhat channeled into the anthem-esque,
youth-unity theme of "Leash," and although

I almost feel foolish humming "Drop the
leash, drop the leash," its infectious guitar
can't be denied.
Rounding out the album is the most ques
tionable song on the album, "Rats," a track
lauding the virtues of rodentia and "Animal,"
the potent anti-violence tune that was the
precursor to the whole Neil Young thing at
the MTV Video Music Awards — a veritable
bridging of generational-labeled gaps.
The end result, then, is that although

"Vs." doesn't cover any radical new ground, it
delivers the goods — regardless of all the
hoopla and hubbub.
"Vs." rocks when it should and mellows
out when it can, molding a sound that even
with its shortcomings challenges the band
wagoneers of both the wanna-be-cool and
the way-too-cool.
Now if I can only get that "Eco Pak" CD
case open.

So what if Eddie Vedder and company are mainstream. Pearl Jam's latest effort "Vs."
proves that integrity doesn't have to get lost in the Top 40 shuffle.
