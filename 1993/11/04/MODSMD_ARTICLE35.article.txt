# "Laid" James
## spins 
### 
James' first album, "Gold Mother," didn't
make an impression on me, or on anyone
else, actually. However, in a second attempt
at fame, the English pop band re-released
eight songs from "Gold Mother" plus two ad
ditional tracks under a self-titled recording.
Surprisingly, the seven-man group received a
wealth of public attention for "James."
Now, "Laid," the band's latest album, uses
James' trademark strengths — namely Tim
Booth's rich, hypnotic vocals and the band's
angst-ridden lyrics. Lyrically, the music
beckons those teens / post-teens who are feel-

ing the effects of
being wronged, pro
moting acts of ac
ceptance or protest.
In a typical Jame
sian juxtaposition of
themes, domination
and tenderness are
contrasted in "Out to
Get You." "Some
times," Booth sings,
"in your eyes I see
your soul." At the

same time, other tracks such as "laid" produce
existential eloquence. In a particularly interest
ing lyric, Booth states, "Every kiss leaves a bruise
/ You've been reading too much into existence."
With tighter production than its predeces
sors, "laid" transmits an acoustic, yet neo
psychedelic feel. (Imagine if the Byrds hijacked
a U2 tour bus.) Many songs are slow and
poignant, filled with airy pop-like folk guitar,
relying on various distortions and effects. For
instance, the tracks "Skin Diving" and "One of
the Three" are notably soothing and melodic.
The album is also peppered with more up
beat guitar arrangements as in "Out to Get
You." The drums, smoothly consistent, are
often even tribal at times. But that familiar
bumbling style of drumming — from al
bums past — can still be found in tracks like
"Say Something" and "P.S." But songs like the
audibly random "Five-O" and the absurd
"Low, Low, Low" drive home the fact that
James as a band is far from being the consis
tent hitters they seem.
What "Laid" does is prove that more often
than not, the band's purpose seems more to
accompany Booth's voice than to perform as
an actual band. Still, if you're into "Manches
ter-pop," look into "laid." While good lyrics
and melodic vocals may suffice for some,
they didn't for me.
