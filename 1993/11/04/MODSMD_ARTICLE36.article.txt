# " '93 Til Infinity" Souls of Mischief
## 
### 
The Hieroglyphics are a hype clique
that has made a significant contribution to
the Hip-Hop Nation and the West Coast
rap scene. They consist of two groups and
three solo rappers who grew up in the
heart of East Oaktown. Their style is
unique to the other city by the Bay with
lyrics so complex they are reminiscent of
the ancient Egyptian script the posse takes
as its name.
Ice Cube's cousin Del Tha Funkee Ho
mosapien was the first member to make his
mark on the hip-hop world, and now four
more Hieros hit the scene with a vengeance.
Tajai, A-Plus, Opio and Phesto arc the Souls of
Mischief and their debut album " '93 Til In
finity" is a phat display of West Coast hip-hop
innovation.
They ignore the tired gangsta-rap lyrics
and beats of the mainstream, challenging
sucker MC's with freestyle techniques
straight from the street. The group's sound
is fun, fresh and appealing. They play with
the King's English in a puerile way, convey
ing the joviality of bragging and causing
trouble.

"Let 'Em Know,"the album's first track,
is a bold statement to other rappers that the
Souls plan to dominate the Hip-Hop nation
for eternity. Hieroglyphics producer Domi
no lays down smoothed out jazz samples
for his boys to kick hyperactive lyrics over,
affirming the group's arrogance and the
musical philosophy at the core of the
record.
In a tribute to losers and suckers who
never get respect on the street, the Del Tha
Funkee Homosapien-produced cut "That's
When Ya Lost" continues on the jazz tip as
the rapid-fire denigrating rhymes are backed
by music that flows almost angelically to the
listener's ears.
Describing their future in the hip-hop
scene, the title track produced by A-Plus
conveys the feeling that rap's future will be
like jazz is to adults, a type of music that we
can sit down, relax, and chill to. M '93 Til In
finity" almost feels mellow, as the group de
livers 90 rpm lyrics over a cerebral R&B
arrangement.
Blessed with tremendous lyrical tal
ent, self-confidence, and top-rate pro
duction, Souls of Mischief seem to be on
the way to rap super-stardom. These
young black men should make Oaktown
very proud.
