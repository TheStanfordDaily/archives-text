The Beverly Hillbillies
While definitely in the "stupid" genre
of filmmaking, the nostalgia value of
the "Hillbillies" and several inspired
performances (Cloris Leachman,
Lily Tomlin, Dtedrich Bader) save
the movie from utter unacceptability.
Despite its flaws, "The Beverly Hill
billies" remains a fun trip through
the time-warp machine. PG
Fearless
In a suspended moment when dis
aster strikes, when the end is un
avoidable, it is then one can say,
"This is it — this is the moment of
death — I have no fear" Jeff Bridges
and Rosie Perez are justified in their
fearlessness because their superb
portrayals of grief complement a
strong script and remarkable direct
ing to produce a film that flies high. R
Flesh and Bone
A sobering look at the connection
between past actions and future
possibilities, this film is no typical
fairy-tale-ending fare. The strength
of the film lies in a realistic story with

believable characters that the audi
ence can get to know and its ability
to make you think about serious is
sues in a very un-Hollywood man
ner. R
House of Angels
An enchanting, Swedish comedy
about inter-personal relationships in
a small town, "House of Angels"
gains its humor from the conflicts
between the seemingly staid towns
people and the shocking behavior
of "foreigners" in their midst. Over
coming a stereotypical plot, strong
acting and a focus on the unique pe
culiarities of small-town life make the
film surprisingly relevant. R
The Joy Luck Club
Grandiose, epic, tear-jerking and
gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous ...
this adaptation of Amy Tan's best
seller is all of the above. Moving de
spite its blatant commercialism,
"The Joy Luck Club" does a splen
did job of bringing the novel to life
and marks a monumental first for
Asian-Americans in Hollywood. R

M. Butterfly
This adaptation of David Henry
Hwang's play could have been por
trayed as a pop-culture look at a
naive French diplomat deceived into
kinky sex by a Chinese freak or a
thoughtful criticism of popular per
ceptions of Asian women. Fortu
nately, Hwang's collaboration and
the ingenious decision to cast John
Lone as Song Liling preserve the in
tended societal critique R
Mr. Wonderful
A love story with a predictable end,
"Mr. Wonderful" lacks the humor,
suspense or character development
to make it more than a pile of mush.
This typical silver-screen scheme, in
which Matt Dillon attempts to marry
off his ex-wife to avoid her alimony
bills, is a boring romance without
the passion necessary to interest an
audience. PG-13
Nightmare Before Christmas
Tim Burton's and the Walt Disney
Corporation's different styles lead to
a remarkably uneven film — a com

bination of Burton's brilliant stop-ac
tion and Disney's corporate caution
Despite potentially intriguing char
acters, the film is cold, dry and un
moving — heartless. PG
Short Cuts
Unfortunately genius does not al
ways produce quality work, and
Robert Altman's latest epic is proof
of that principle. A bittersweet ode to
a decaying Los Angeles based on
Raymond Carver's writing, Altman's
series of vignettes neglects its main
character — the city of Los Angeles.
What remains is a shadow of Alt
man's directorial prowess and some
stories more entertainingly busy
then poignantly literary. R
Striking Distance
Bruce Willis, playing a renegade
homicide detective, unsuccessfully
attempts to create a film of "Die
Hard" caliber. "Striking Distance"
has all the key elements of a suc
cessful film — sex, violence, and an
actor with a bad-boy-attitude, but it
fails to do anything creative. R
