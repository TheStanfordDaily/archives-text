# Wanted: Escorts for salamanders
## 
### Skip Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Now that the salamanders don't have
to worry about getting burned by the Big
Game Bonfire, they can just wait for the
rains.
As soon as the first major downpour
occurs, the six-inch amphibians will
come out from animal burrows in the
Foothills to begin their march across Ju
nipero Serra Boulevard back to Lake La
gunita, only to die under the tire treads of
an oncoming car.
But one group of volunteers, based
out of the Stanford Center for Conserva
tion Biology, is going to try to prevent the
animals "from getting smooshed," while
learning more about their behavioral
patterns.
According to Jamie Reaser, co-direc
tor of the California Tiger Salamander
Rescue and Research Project, the group
is recruiting helpers "to be on call to col
lect data and do rescue work— moving
the salamanders across the road." While

the current weather pattern has been far
from rainy, Reaser said the volunteers in
the group have to remain on call, ready at
a moment's notice to don their reflective
rain gear and go to Junipero Serra to res
cue the black and yellow creatures.
Once the heavy winter rains begin,
Reaser said, the 10 nightly volunteers
will go to the road and set up two-foot
high drift fences to block the salaman
ders from crossing the road. The fences
will channel them to a point at the end of
the fence where volunteers will be wait
ing to put them in buckets and escort
them across the busy thoroughfare.
While a few of the salamanders spent
the summer under the lake bed, the ma
jority were in the burrows of pocket go
phers and ground squirrels in the
Foothills, Reaser said. She added that
when heavy rains begin, there will be "a
mass movement" of the animals to Lake
Lag to lay their eggs for the winter.
Reaser said helping the salamanders
across the road is a critical job because
approximately 200 were found dead on

the road last year, an extreme loss to a
population thought to be only about 400.
The tiger salamander population at
Stanford is the largest on the Peninsula.
The salamander is waiting to be consid
ered an endangered species.
Another important job of the volun
teers will be to check traps placed strate
gically in the storm drains around Ju
nipero Serra, Reaser said. There is the
possibility that the rains could actually
wash the salamanders into the drains,
from which they could not escape and so
would die.
Reaser said she hopes that the conser
vation center will soon have a banner
with a salamander on it that they can
hang on Herrin Hall to notify volunteers
if they are to work that night.
Reaser conceded that the project vol
unteers will only be able to cover so much
of the road in collecting the salamanders,
leaving some to fend for themselves
across the 15 feet of asphalt. She
added that as the project pro
gresses, the biologists will use the
statistics of the number saved
versus the number killed to
restructure their effort.
In addition to helping the ani
mals make their journey, Reaser
said one of the goals of the project
is to collect as much data as possi
ble to use for a long-term study of
the species. Since little is known
about these amphibians, volun
teers will be measuring their sizes
and mapping out individual spot
patterns. Reaser said that, among
other things, these pieces of infor
mation will help the biologist
determine the animals' ages and
breeding patterns.
Ted Lee, a junior, is helping
coordinate the effort to save the
salamanders as well as conduct
ing his own project on how weath
er affects their behavior.
Lee is doing his study as a "pro
ject of interest" and hopes the
information he gathers about the
relationship between environmen
tal conditions and the salaman
ders will help future biologists.
Student volunteers can arrange to
receive credit for their work
through the Biology Department.
The salamanders were discov
ered in the summer of 1992 by
researchers from the Coyote
Creek Riparian Center, which
had been contracted by Stanford
to determine the ecological

impact of building two new stu
dent residences on the Knoll. It
was this discovery — after five
years of drought conditions —
that prompted the Stanford cen
ter's project.
The discovery also postponed
construction projects at the Knoll
and forced the Big Game Bonfire
festivities and the Kappa Alpha
Mud Volleyball Tournament to
relocate.
Although Coyote Creek has
not been officially contracted by
Stanford to help in the salaman
der rescue effort, Mike Rigney, a
researcher with the group, said
that they are helping with the
road logistics of the project.
Reaser said that one of the
hazards of conducting this project
is that the volunteers will be out
on a wet Junipero Serra at night.
She added that the salamanders
are more active at night because
of the cool temperatures.
All of the volunteers in the
project will be required to go
through a brief training course
that will focus on safety and "how
not to be hit by a car," as well as
how to set up the drift fences and
handle and map the salamanders,
Reaser said.
But Reaser added that all the
late nights and hard work are def
initely worth the information the
center will gather about the
species.
Besides "teaching us a lot about
the environment," Reaser said
that the study "is about the issue
of stewardship and the role Stan
ford and its students play in the
long term survival of the species."

dent residences on the Knoll. It
was this discovery — after five
years of drought conditions —
that prompted the Stanford cen
ter's project.
The discovery also postponed
construction projects at the Knoll
and forced the Big Game Bonfire
festivities and the Kappa Alpha
Mud Volleyball Tournament to
relocate.
Although Coyote Creek has
not been officially contracted by
Stanford to help in the salaman
der rescue effort, Mike Rigney, a
researcher with the group, said
that they are helping with the
road logistics of the project.
Reaser said that one of the
hazards of conducting this project
is that the volunteers will be out
on a wet Junipero Serra at night.
She added that the salamanders
are more active at night because
of the cool temperatures.
All of the volunteers in the
project will be required to go
through a brief training course
that will focus on safety and "how
not to be hit by a car," as well as
how to set up the drift fences and
handle and map the salamanders,
Reaser said.
But Reaser added that all the
late nights and hard work are def
initely worth the information the
center will gather about the
species.
Besides "teaching us a lot about
the environment," Reaser said
that the study "is about the issue
of stewardship and the role Stan
ford and its students play in the
long term survival of the species."
Now that the salamanders don't have
to worry about getting burned by the Big
Game Bonfire, they can just wait for the
rains.
As soon as the first major downpour
occurs, the six-inch amphibians will
come out from animal burrows in the
Foothills to begin their march across Ju
nipero Serra Boulevard back to Lake La
gunita, only to die under the tire treads of
an oncoming car.
But one group of volunteers, based
out of the Stanford Center for Conserva
tion Biology, is going to try to prevent the
animals "from getting smooshed," while
learning more about their behavioral
patterns.
According to Jamie Reaser, co-direc
tor of the California Tiger Salamander
Rescue and Research Project, the group
is recruiting helpers "to be on call to col
lect data and do rescue work— moving
the salamanders across the road." While

the current weather pattern has been far
from rainy, Reaser said the volunteers in
the group have to remain on call, ready at
a moment's notice to don their reflective
rain gear and go to Junipero Serra to res
cue the black and yellow creatures.
Once the heavy winter rains begin,
Reaser said, the 10 nightly volunteers
will go to the road and set up two-foot
high drift fences to block the salaman
ders from crossing the road. The fences
will channel them to a point at the end of
the fence where volunteers will be wait
ing to put them in buckets and escort
them across the busy thoroughfare.
While a few of the salamanders spent
the summer under the lake bed, the ma
jority were in the burrows of pocket go
phers and ground squirrels in the
Foothills, Reaser said. She added that
when heavy rains begin, there will be "a
mass movement" of the animals to Lake
Lag to lay their eggs for the winter.
Reaser said helping the salamanders
across the road is a critical job because
approximately 200 were found dead on

the road last year, an extreme loss to a
population thought to be only about 400.
The tiger salamander population at
Stanford is the largest on the Peninsula.
The salamander is waiting to be consid
ered an endangered species.
Another important job of the volun
teers will be to check traps placed strate
gically in the storm drains around Ju
nipero Serra, Reaser said. There is the
possibility that the rains could actually
wash the salamanders into the drains,
from which they could not escape and so
would die.
Reaser said she hopes that the conser
vation center will soon have a banner
with a salamander on it that they can
hang on Herrin Hall to notify volunteers
if they are to work that night.
Reaser conceded that the project vol
unteers will only be able to cover so much
of the road in collecting the salamanders,
leaving some to fend for themselves
across the 15 feet of asphalt. She
added that as the project pro
gresses, the biologists will use the
statistics of the number saved
versus the number killed to
restructure their effort.
In addition to helping the ani
mals make their journey, Reaser
said one of the goals of the project
is to collect as much data as possi
ble to use for a long-term study of
the species. Since little is known
about these amphibians, volun
teers will be measuring their sizes
and mapping out individual spot
patterns. Reaser said that, among
other things, these pieces of infor
mation will help the biologist
determine the animals' ages and
breeding patterns.
Ted Lee, a junior, is helping
coordinate the effort to save the
salamanders as well as conduct
ing his own project on how weath
er affects their behavior.
Lee is doing his study as a "pro
ject of interest" and hopes the
information he gathers about the
relationship between environmen
tal conditions and the salaman
ders will help future biologists.
Student volunteers can arrange to
receive credit for their work
through the Biology Department.
The salamanders were discov
ered in the summer of 1992 by
researchers from the Coyote
Creek Riparian Center, which
had been contracted by Stanford
to determine the ecological

impact of building two new stu
dent residences on the Knoll. It
was this discovery — after five
years of drought conditions —
that prompted the Stanford cen
