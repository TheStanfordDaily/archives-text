# Wanted: Escorts for salamanders
## 
### Skip Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Now that the salamanders don't have
to worry about getting burned by the Big
Game Bonfire, they can just wait for the
rains.
As soon as the first major downpour
occurs, the six-inch amphibians will
come out from animal burrows in the
Foothills to begin their march across Ju
nipero Serra Boulevard back to Lake La
gunita, only to die under the tire treads of
an oncoming car.
But one group of volunteers, based
out of the Stanford Center for Conserva
tion Biology, is going to try to prevent the
animals "from getting smooshed," while
learning more about their behavioral
patterns.
According to Jamie Reaser, co-direc
tor of the California Tiger Salamander
Rescue and Research Project, the group
is recruiting helpers "to be on call to col
lect data and do rescue workâ€” moving
the salamanders across the road." While

the current weather pattern has been far
from rainy, Reaser said the volunteers in
the group have to remain on call, ready at
a moment's notice to don their reflective
rain gear and go to Junipero Serra to res
cue the black and yellow creatures.
Once the heavy winter rains begin,
Reaser said, the 10 nightly volunteers
will go to the road and set up two-foot
high drift fences to block the salaman
ders from crossing the road. The fences
will channel them to a point at the end of
the fence where volunteers will be wait
ing to put them in buckets and escort
them across the busy thoroughfare.
While a few of the salamanders spent
the summer under the lake bed, the ma
jority were in the burrows of pocket go
phers and ground squirrels in the
Foothills, Reaser said. She added that
when heavy rains begin, there will be "a
mass movement" of the animals to Lake
Lag to lay their eggs for the winter.
Reaser said helping the salamanders
across the road is a critical job because
approximately 200 were found dead on

the road last year, an extreme loss to a
population thought to be only about 400.
The tiger salamander population at
Stanford is the largest on the Peninsula.
The salamander is waiting to be consid
ered an endangered species.
Another important job of the volun
teers will be to check traps placed strate
gically in the storm drains around Ju
nipero Serra, Reaser said. There is the
possibility that the rains could actually
wash the salamanders into the drains,
from which they could not escape and so
would die.
Reaser said she hopes that the conser
vation center will soon have a banner
with a salamander on it that they can
hang on Herrin Hall to notify volunteers
if they are to work that night.
Reaser conceded that the project vol
unteers will only be able to cover so much
of the road in collecting the salamanders,
leaving some to fend for themselves
