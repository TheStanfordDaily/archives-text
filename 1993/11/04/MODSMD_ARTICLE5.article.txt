## Students' phone-monopoly lawsuit in limbo with utilities commission 
### L.M. Taber 
While a three-year-long suit
against the University alleging
monopolistic telephone service
practices continues to languish
before the California Public
Utilities Commission, the com
mission's practices have recent
ly caught the attention of state
legislators.
The attorney representing
four Stanford students who
filed the suit appeared before
the state Senate's Energy and
Public Utilities Committee and
its Assembly counterpart in Los
Angeles on Oct. 21, testifying
that the utilities commission
has "refused to decide" the stu
dents' complaint.
The commission, which is
charged with deciding the case
against Stanford, has yet to
hand down a decision, though
final briefs were filed in April
1992.
The suit alleges that Pacific
Bell broke the law by selling
telephone equipment to Stan
ford, allowing the University to
set up a private branch ex
change and cut students off
from potentially cheaper out
side phone service.
Jotham Stein, attorney for
the plaintiffs, characterized the

delay as "a due process viola
tion," in his testimony and in a
letter to the legislative commit
tees charged with monitoring
the utilities commission.
"The commission has been
sitting on the case for an un
heard-of year and a half now,"
Stein said in a phone interview.
"Meanwhile students are being
defrauded by the Stanford
Board of Trustees and execu
tive administrators who want
to make money."
But Senior University Coun
sel Jasper Williams maintains
that Communication Services
is not a profit-making opera
tion, and that "the vast minori
ty of Stanford students are
much better off in the Universi
ty system than if they were
treated as a public utility."
Williams suggested that the
commission may be delaying
the case "in order to take all the
evidence into thoughtful con
sideration."
Utilities commission staff
members were unable to ex
plain the delay or locate any in
formation regarding the case.
The commission had initial
ly decided against co-com
plainants Michael Murray, Bill
Behrman, Gerald LeTendre and
Mary Beth Rice in June 1990, but
rescinded that decision three
months later, granting the stu
dents a rehearing.
The rehearing began in Novem
ber 1991 and final briefs were filed
in April 1992, in which the stu
dents "painstakingly demonstrate
how defendants Pacific Bell and
Stanford repeatedly broke the
law," according to Stein's letter to
the legislators.
The plaintiffs argue that stu
dents are illegally denied access to
money-saving programs offered by
carriers like MCI, Sprint and
AT&T, as well as Universal Life
line Telephone Service, which pro
vides low-income households with
cheaper basic rates, as is mandat
ed by legislative codes.
The plaintiffs have requested
that in addition to gaining access
to their choice of carriers, all Stan
ford students should receive two
years of free interstate calling ser
vices and 24 vouchers worth $10
each of long-distance calls per
month in repayment of savings
denied them since 1990, when stu
dents were hooked up to the cam
pus phone service.
Those figures would increase
considerably, Stein says, once they
are revised to include savings lost
due to the commission's delay in
deciding the case.
"It is entirely possible that the
occasional person might be better

off outside our system," said Bill
Clebsch, associate director for
Networking and Communication
Systems. But, he added, "I know
that person is few and far
between."
Clebsch said eight different
studies have been conducted since
June 1989, and all have concluded
that campus telephone service
subscribers share $1.7 million to
$2.2 million in savings per year.
Communication Services has
also analyzed a handful of bills
brought in by concerned students
over the last two years, Clebsch
said, and consistently found that
they saved more under the Uni
versity system than if they had
been under any one of the savings
plans offered by other carriers.
Clebsch said the analyses did not
take into account whether or not
students are eligible for the approx
imately $8 per month savings of
Universal Lifeline or special bonus
earnings — like frequent-flyer
points — but "it does not move the
model very much," he said.
"I think the issues get mud
dled," he added, "when you push
people into a corner and they're
told that they have to do some
thing. Even though it will save
them money, they don't want to do
it. It raises the specter of choice."
But Stein, a former Stanford
Law student who now teaches at
UC-Berkeley's School of Law,
maintains that "some students
may be better off' under Stanford's
system, but "some students are
definitely much worse off and the
University is defrauding them into
believing they don't have a choice."
