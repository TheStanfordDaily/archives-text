## Students' phone-monopoly lawsuit in limbo with utilities commission 
### L.M. Taber 
While a three-year-long suit
against the University alleging
monopolistic telephone service
practices continues to languish
before the California Public
Utilities Commission, the com
mission's practices have recent
ly caught the attention of state
legislators.
The attorney representing
four Stanford students who
filed the suit appeared before
the state Senate's Energy and
Public Utilities Committee and
its Assembly counterpart in Los
Angeles on Oct. 21, testifying
that the utilities commission
has "refused to decide" the stu

The commission, which is
charged with deciding the case
against Stanford, has yet to
hand down a decision, though
final briefs were filed in April
1992.
The suit alleges that Pacific
Bell broke the law by selling
telephone equipment to Stan
ford, allowing the University to
set up a private branch ex
change and cut students off
from potentially cheaper out
side phone service.
Jotham Stein, attorney for
the plaintiffs, characterized the

delay as "a due process viola
tion," in his testimony and in a
letter to the legislative commit
tees charged with monitoring
the utilities commission.
"The commission has been
sitting on the case for an un
heard-of year and a half now,"
Stein said in a phone interview.
"Meanwhile students are being
defrauded by the Stanford
Board of Trustees and execu
tive administrators who want
to make money."
But Senior University Coun
sel Jasper Williams maintains
that Communication Services
is not a profit-making opera
tion, and that "the vast minori
ty of Stanford students are
much better off in the Universi
ty system than if they were
treated as a public utility."
Williams suggested that the
commission may be delaying
the case "in order to take all the
evidence into thoughtful con
sideration."
Utilities commission staff
members were unable to ex
plain the delay or locate any in
formation regarding the case.
The commission had initial
