# Law prof, journalist debate Anita Hill case
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Stanford Law Prof. Kathleen
Sullivan came face to face with a
staunch intellectual foe, journal
ist David Brock, last night in the
Law School.
Brock, who authored "The Real
Anita Hill" — a best-selling book
describing how Anita Hill came to
allege sexual harassment against
Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas — and Sullivan, who cri
tiqued his book for The New York
Review of Books, held an hour
long discussion over the nature of
Hill's allegations in front of a spir
ited crowd of about 250 people.
Brock, speaking first, chose to
quickly summarize the argument
of his book, which he described as
"informed speculation" on the po
litical forces which "in effect pro
duced Anita Hill." But he spent
most of his time concentrating on
the reaction to his book.
Sullivan, meanwhile, used her
time to criticize Brock for his ar
gument that Hill had acted im
properly in her attempt to derail
the Supreme Court nomination of
Clarence Thomas two years ago
Brock skipped his prepared at
tack on Sullivan's specific criti
cisms from the book review, but
he characterized other critics of
his book as "hysterical" in their
vilification of his work — a devel
opment he saw as directly compa
rable to the Thomas hearings
themselves.
He accused liberals in the

media of "muscling history" by
neglecting to report the "startling
lack of evidence" to corroborate
Hill's account of events, which he
challenged by publishing his book.
Brock complained that liberal
critics at first refused to take up a
debate with him after the book

was published. He contended that
those critics then attempted to
change the subject of the debate
from"the real Anita Hill" to "the
real David Brock."
However, Brock said he was
satisfied that the book had "shift
ed the ground of the debate onto

issues of fact.
"The fact war is one that Anita
Hill supporters can never win," he
said.
Sullivan, on the other hand, fo
cused primarily on the argument


Burt Herman — Daily
Law Prof. Kathleen Sullivan squares off with journalist David Brock, author of "The Real Anita Hill," last
night at the Law School. Brock said there's a "startling lack of evidence" to corroborate Hill's accusa
tions of sexual harassment by now-Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas; Sullivan criticized Brock
for arguing that Hill acted improperly in her attempt to derail Thomas' nomination two years ago.
of Brock's book.
" The Real Anita Hill' reads
like a tract in a cultural war," she
said.
She argued that Brock's
descriptions of Hill's motives for
bringing allegations against
Thomas were flawed because they
relied on two mutually exclusive
caricatures of Anita Hill: what
she called "the pawn," where Hill
is seen as the victim of a liberal
conspiracy, and"the feminist
quota queen" who is out for
revenge — neither of which accu
rately describe her.
She further derided as "naive"
Brock's idea that a "shadow Sen

ate" of liberal Congressional staff
members and interest groups
formed a conspiracy which prod
ded Hill into making her allega
tions, arguing that such informal
influences are merely a fact of life
on both sides of the political spec
trum.
Sullivan also attacked Brock's
either/or construction of the
issue. "The truth is not something
that Mr. Brock has established. . .
. or something the liberals have
muscled," she said. "The truth is
something more complex."
She posited that both Hill and
Thomas could have been telling
the truth, and that Brock's book
failed to address the "deep sub
stantive controversy" over the dif
ference between "women's truth"
and men's that such a possibility
raises.
