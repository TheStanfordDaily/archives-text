## NAFTA sent to Congress President makes concessions before submitting bill 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - After
months of haggling and some last
minute modifications, President
Clinton sent Congress the final
version of legislation to put in force
the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
The bill was sent to Capitol Hill
yesterday after Mexico and the
United States reached agreement
at 4 a.m. on new side deals
designed to protect U.S. sugar, cit
rus and vegetable producers,
administration officials said.
Even so, Clinton conceded he
still lacks the votes for the pact —
which would lower tariffs and
other trade barriers among the
United States, Mexico and Canada
— but predicted he would when the
House acts on Nov. 17.
"We don't have them today, but
we're getting there," he said.

Congressional committees have
already worked with the adminis
tration in shaping the final mea
sure and the legislation cannot be
amended further.
Officials said privately that
Clinton still appears about 40 votes
short — even with some of the
1 lth-hour sweeteners.
The new items — designed
almost exclusively to woo undecid
ed lawmakers — included help for
businesses ranging from appliance
manufacturers to broom makers to
a $ 10 million authorization to build
a trade study center in Texas.
The pact, scheduled to go into
effect Jan. 1 and be phased in over
15 years, would create the world's
largest economic market, with 363
million people and a combined
domestic product of $6.3 trillion.
It is being strongly opposed by

organized labor and by Texas bil
lionaire Ross Perot, who claim
companies will move plants to
Mexico to take advantage of low
wages.
Supporters concede there might
be some initial dislocations, but
they say the pact will create more
U.S. jobs in the long term by open
ing new markets to U.S. goods.
"This will create the world's
largest tariff-free zone, from the
Canadian arc to the Mexican trop
ics," Clinton said. The measure
implements a pact initially negoti
ated by the Bush administration.
"If we turn away from NAFTA,
we risk losing a natural trade
advantage that should come to the
United States as Mexico and the
rest of Latin America build market
economies and stronger democra
cies," Clinton added.
