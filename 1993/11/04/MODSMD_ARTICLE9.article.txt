Flooding plagues Honduras
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -
Heavy flooding kept more than 15,000 peo
ple from returning yesterday to homes
swamped by three days of storms. At least
110 people have died and 263 are missing,
authorities said.
After flying Tuesday over the hardest
hit areas, President Rafael Leonardo Calle
jas said experts were estimating damages
would exceed $60 million.
The nearly 72 hours of torrential rains
began before dawn on Sunday as a series of
storms and high winds lashed the coastal
provinces, unleashing mudslides that top
pled more than 1,000 homes.
House approves crime bill
WASHINGTON (AP) - Prodded by
voter anger over crime, the House gave its
endorsement yesterday to deployment of an
additional 50,000 police on America's streets.
Four other anti-crime measures await
ed passage later in the day, to be followed

this month by debate on legislation requir
ing a five-day waiting period for handgun
purchases.
Approval for additional officers came by
voice vote. The measure authorizes — but
does not fund — $3.45 billion for beefed up
police forces over the next six years. Clin
ton wants to use the savings from a year
end round of spending cuts to finance the
anti-crime initiative.
Economy gets thumbs up
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal
Reserve delivered a moderately positive
assessment of economic conditions across
the country yesterday, noting strength in
consumer spending, particularly for autos.
It said business activity is spotty in Cal
ifornia and New York and mentioned
some signs of inflation in the raw materi
als that manufacturers buy. But overall,
the Fed's assessment of regional business
activity was seen by economists as a bit
more optimistic than its last report in
September.
