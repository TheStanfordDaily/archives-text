# Museum logs Indian items
## University scrambles to meet federal regulations 
### Tish Williams Senior staff writer 
In order to comply with recent federal regulations,
the Stanford Museum and the Anthropology Depart
ment are rushing to finish a year-long inventory of Na
tive American artifacts in the University's collections.
The Native American Grave Protection and Repa
triation Act of 1990 requires the documentation,
maintenance and possible repatriation of Native
American artifacts, asking all federally funded institu
tions to itemize holdings and inform the respective
tribes by Nov. 16. The penalty provision of the act has
not yet been written.
Under the legislation, the museum and the An
thropology Department must describe the objects per
taining to each group and provide information regard
ing the acquisition of these items.
Using this information, Native American groups
may find out which objects fall under specific cate
gories and then initiate the process of repatriation.
This process has not been a short one for Stanford,
which possesses hundreds of Native American arti
facts, including a basketry collection, historical and
prehistorical pottery, stone tools such as spearheads
and arrowheads, beaded clothing, and day-to-day tools
and household items.
"We're scrambling," said Assoc. Anthropology
Prof. John Rick, curator of the Anthropology Depart
ment's collection. "In process it is a simple feat, but in
execution it is very difficult."
While the regulations may mean that Stanford
might have to return a few of its holdings, University
officials stressed the positive outcomes of the act.
"The intent of this legislation is to get a better dia
logue going between museums and Native American
groups," said Thomas Seligman, director of the Stan
ford Museum. "We will of course be receptive to any
subsequent visit requests, and we are required by law
to share any information with them."
A two-stage process, this first step covers only items
categorized as unassociated funerary objects, sacred
objects and objects of cultural patrimony. In approxi
mately two years, human remains and associated fu-
nerary objects must also be reported.
"Rest assured, there is nothing
simple about this," Seligman said.
"We have to inventory our entire col
lection. We've had an enormous
amount of help from volunteers in
order to comply with the legislation."
Seligman said that determining
an object's categorization, as well as
its origin and the specific tribe to be
notified has made the process tricky.
One example he described is
some ceramic items in the Muse
um's collection which are archaeo
logical artifacts pertaining to the

Mimbres tribe, a group of peoples
living in the Southwest over 1,000
years ago. The museum will be
writing a number of groups in the
region, who will then have to
demonstrate a genealogical connec
tion to the Mimbres in order to
benefit from the act.
"The stickler is figuring out
which tribe is concerned," Rick
said. "By law we must inform all
recognized tribes."
The review of the collection —
which is taking more than a year —
has meant "bringing in experts and
Indian peoples to confirm the iden
tification process," said Ruth
Franklin, the museum's curator of
the Africa, Oceania and Americas
collections. "We regard this as an

opportunity to develop communi
cation with Native American
groups. We're not thinking in
terms of penalties, because we're
complying in full."
Anthropology students are aiding
the department's compliance with
the regulation, by way of a museum
methods class taught by Rosa Rick,
assistant curator of the Anthropolo
gy Department's collection.
According to Rick, Stanford has
three collections pertinent to the
act's requirements: an Anthropolo
gy collection within the Anthropol
ogy Department, an Anthropology
Department collection residing in
the museum, and a museum collec
tion over which the department
has curatorial duties.
