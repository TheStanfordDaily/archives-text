## Wildfire nearly contained Malibu residents grieve destruction caused by disaster 
### 
MALIBU, Calif. (AP) — Alice
Kavaldgian cried as she trudged
through the ashes of her home.
"This is it," she said, pointing to
the clothes she was wearing. "1
don't even have a sweater."
Kavaldgian was among thou
sands of residents chased from
this celebrity enclave by an arson
wildfire that roared out of the
Santa Monica Mountains on
Tuesday and burned 200 houses.
One person was killed.
Some returned yesterday to
see whether any of their past was
still standing. Others waited at
roadblocks hastily put up to allow
fire or aircraft bombing runs over
the remaining hot spots.
As of yesterday, firefighters
had contained 70 percent of the
18,500-acre wildfire, one of a
series of blazes that have
destroyed 1,000 homes, black
ened 200,000 acres and injured
nearly 200 people in Southern

California since Oct. 26. Several
were blamed on arsonists.
With cool sea breezes mixing
with wind gusts in the hills, crews
and Firefighting aircraft focused
yesterday on the hot spots around
Fernwood in Topanga Canyon.
Forecasters weren't expecting
a return of the hot, dry Santa Ana
winds from the deserts northeast
of Los Angeles that fanned the
worst of the fires.
Mike Pierson, 33, returned to
his wood-sided house to find it
intact. His relief, however, was
subdued.
"My cousin's home is gone, my
best friend's home is gone. Every
person I grew up with, their home
is gone," Pierson said. "I look
here and I can't even tell where
people live."
Nelson Carpentier returned to
his Las Flores Canyon lot to find
his home destroyed and his
restored 1970 Mercedes-Benz a

burned out shell.
As family members dug spoons,
metal tools, ceramic cups and pots
out of the ash, Carpentier
expressed anger at the arsonist
who authorities said set the fire.
"It makes me sick," he said. "I
did nothing to that guy, and he
destroyed everything I own."
The blaze claimed its first
fatality Wednesday night.
British movie director Duncan
Gibbins, 41, died of burns suf
fered when he tried to rescue a
Bluepoint Siamese he had taken a
liking to. A burned friend, Ron
Mass, 40, remained in critical
condition.
A $250,000 reward was posted
for information leading to the
capture and conviction of whoev
er set the Malibu fire.
Authorities searched for clues
and questioned a witness who
saw two men in a pickup near the
fire's point of origin.
