# White House revises health care costs
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A week
after energizing critics by saying 40
percent of insured Americans would
pay more under the president's health
plan, the White House said yesterday
the real number is only 30 percent.
White House budget director Leon
Panetta, dispatched to Congress to
deliver the revised, rosier numbers,
said the 40 percent figure only took into
account what people would pay in
insurance premiums.
The 30 percent number includes out
of-pocket costs, such as co-payments
and deductibles, that are likely to
decrease for many Americans undo-
President Clinton's plan.
"If we fail to pass this plan, 100 per
cent of Americans will pay higher pre
miums, because that's where are health
costs are going," Panetta said.
It was more damage control for the
White House after critics seized on the
40 percent figure in testimony last week

by Health Secretary Donna Shalala.
"There was confusion that was
unfortunate," said White House
spokeswoman Maria Romash.
"We wanted to be able to provide the
American people with as accurate an
analysis as we could. To just talk about
premium costs is to miss half the pic
ture," she said.
For instance, there are some people
carrying policies with high deductibles,
such as a $3,000, who might pay the
full amount of the visit's cost every
time they see the doctor, Romash said.
Their premiums might be higher under
Clinton'f 1 <~>n' ?
much lower, sue said.
It was unclear just how much good
the White House would reap from
recalculating the numbers.
Senate Finance Chairman Daniel P.
Moynihan, D-N.Y., suggested Clinton
still has a political problem trying to

convince millions they need to pay
more.
"I already said that," Moynihan
replied when asked about negative fall
out Last week, he suggested the 40 per
cent figure might translate into as
many as 100 million Americans paying
more, but administration officials have
said that was a dramatic overestima
tion.
Kenneth Thorpe, a health expert at
the Department of Health and Human
Services, said that in revising the num
bers the agency looked at those who
stand to be affected most by changes in
n re™ turns — the 40 million households
xn ed 112 J ts
± iiuoe nouociiv/ids account for uoout
100 million Americans; the nation's
other 160 million residents are made up
of Medicare and Medicaid recipients,
the self-employed or those who buy
their own insurance, and the 37 million
uninsured, Thorpe said.
