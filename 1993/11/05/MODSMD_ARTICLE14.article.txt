## Affecting the report Student advisory group should focus on specifics of commission's agenda 
### 
THE $1,300 PLEDGE made
last week by the Commis
sion on Undergraduate
Education to the ASSU's Student
Advisory Group on Undergradu
ate Education is more than just a
monetary transaction — it is a
seal of approval. By writing that
check, the commission virtually
endorsed — in advance — the
efforts of the group.
More importantly, the money is
an affirmation that the commis
sion will listen carefully to the
SAGUE's suggestions and incorpo
rate them into its final report to
University President Gerhard
Casper.
By accepting the commission's
funding, the student group has
implicitly agreed to act in coopera
tion with the commission, report
ing student opinions on the topics
that the commission is discussing,
rather than operating completely
independently.
This is a reasonable way for
students to participate in the pro
cess. The SAGUE should be what
it claims to be — a student advi
sory group to the true decision
making body. As such, it should
be the strongest line of communi
cation between the Stanford stu
dent community and the commis
sion.
At present, that line of commu
nication is severely limited by the
fact that there are only two student
members on the commission. It is
unlikely that these two students
will be able, by themselves, to fully
reflect the opinions and concerns of
the rest of the student body — or
even a majority of it.
But they aren't expected to. The
student members of the commis
sion were selected in order to give a
student's perspective on the issues
under discussion. They are not

responsible for relaying the views
of other students; that should be
the primary responsibility of the
SAGUE.
This puts the SAGUE in a poten
tially influential position. If orga
nized and run professionally, its
recommendations will be those of
the student community in general,
and, as such, they will have a sig
nificant impact on the commis
sion's final report.
The SAGUE must seize this
opportunity. It should use this
funding to develop a quantitative
system for determining students'
opinions on undergraduate educa
tion issues.
Already, the SAGUE has initiat
ed discussions — both formal and
informal, within dorms — that
encourage students to think about
their own experiences in under
graduate education.
Now that this foundation has
been established, the SAGUE must
solicit opinions on the specific
issues, like the distribution
requirements or Residential Edu
cation, that the commission
intends to discuss.
It is extremely important that
each discussion remain centered
around a particular issue and
come to a complete understanding
of it. Subject-specific talks attract
more participants, and will be
much more effective in drawing
students that are knowledgeable
on the specific topic of the discus
sion.
These issue-oriented meetings
should give the SAGUE enough
information to develop good
polling questions to ask the entire
student body or representative
portions of it.
Each week, the SAGUE should
present copies of its quantitative
polls on each issue to the members
of the commission as they discuss
the same issue.
Through this two-step process,
the student advisory group can
capitalize on the opportunity that
the commission has graciously
offered, and will make a significant
impact the commission's final
report.
