## Public Affairs director clarifies Webb Ranch issue 
### 
IN THE LEAD sentence of an Oct. 28
news story, The Daily made an erro
neous statement about Stanford's
relationship with Webb Ranch — specifi
cally that "Stanford will no longer be
involved in Webb Ranch." This is cer
tainly not true as it pertains to on-site
housing for ranch employees. I would
like to set the record straight on this
issue and on a few others.
Here are the facts:
• Webb Ranch is a lessee of land from
Stanford. Under the terms of its lease,
the Ranch must maintain its buildings
— including employee housing — in a
fit condition that meets County building
codes as well as standards for agricul
tural housing, according to Curtis
Feeny, executive vice-president for real
estate of the Stanford Management Co.
The Stanford Management Co., which
has the responsibility of enforcing all
leases on Stanford lands, has been close
ly monitoring the installation and reno
vation of mobile homes for workers at
Webb Ranch since early last spring.

During the months the mobile homes
were being improved and brought up to
code, Webb Ranch provided displaced
Ranch farm workers with alternative
housing at its own expense. The County
certified the housing as habitable and
allowed the farm workers to occupy the
mobile homes beginning in August. Of
course, Stanford Management Co. will
continue to monitor all on-site employee
housing to ensure that it is maintained
to standards, and will take appropriate
action, if necessary.
• In an Oct. 25 editorial, The Daily
described the living conditions of the
farm workers as "abominable." This is
a surprising conclusion. The eight
mobile homes that have been the sub
ject of attention were donated by Stan
ford and have since been improved by
Webb Ranch. Each renovated unit,
which houses one family, includes three
bedrooms and two bathrooms. The
homes were moved from the Manzanita
Park residence area on campus to make
way for construction of Kimball Hall.

Moreover, mobile homes like the ones
at Webb Ranch are still housing Stan
ford students today at Manzanita.
• The Daily editorial incorrectly
reported that the lease with the Webb
Ranch expires in 1995. The lease with
Webb Ranch, Inc. for 237 acres of land
expires on Aug. 31, 2000.
• The Daily has failed in its recent cov
erage to report that the farm workers are
empowered, through their union and
their collective bargaining agreement, to
settle disputes with the Webb Ranch
owners. The current dispute at the Ranch
seems to have arisen over which of the
employees may live in the eight trailers.
This is an issue that they have agreed by
contract to be resolved by the union rep
resenting the farm workers, the United
Stanford Workers, Ix>cal 680, and the
Webb Ranch, following dispute resolution
procedures set forth in their collective
bargaining agreement. These procedures
include using professional, neutral arbi
trators. It appears that they are doing so
now and will thereby obtain a final and

binding resolution of the dispute.
It is also important to note that in
1989 the farm workers themselves voted
in an official, government-certified elec
tion to select the USW union as their
sole representative in negotiating all
agreements and disputes with Webb
Ranch covering wages, benefits and other
employment matters, such as housing. In
April 1990, the workers voted 23 to 1 to
ratify the current five-year contract with
Webb Ranch. After the agreement was
signed, a USW official was quoted in
news accounts as calling the agreement a
"model" for farm laborers.
Finally, Stanford is not a party to this
agreement between Webb Ranch owners
and the Union, nor is Stanford a party
to the dispute resolution procedures.
Some of the public confusion over Stan
ford's relationship with Webb Ranch
may be based on a misunderstanding of
this important point.
