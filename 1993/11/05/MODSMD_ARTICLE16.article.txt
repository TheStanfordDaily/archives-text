# ASSU graduate senator argues against creating two student associations
## 
### 
While James Kittock, in his Nov. 3
letter, may feel that the graduates
should leave the ASSU, there are
good reasons for the body to remain
united. From a point of view of effi
ciency and unity, the student's needs
are better served by a unified student
body.
On many issues the concerns of grad
uate students are the same as for under
graduates Both groups benefit from
Legal Counseling, anti-discrimination
services, rape awareness and the
Women's Center, to name just a few.
To duplicate these services would

be crazy. Furthermore, as a unified
student body the ASSU gets more
exposure to the University adminis
tration and is better able to represent
its constituents. At a public-service
level the efforts of some students
reflect on the whole student body.
These groups contribute to what Stan
ford represents in the wider communi
ty and as such provide a useful service
for all students.
As far as funding for specific groups
is concerned, that has been addressed
and in the next general election there
will be a referendum on splitting the
special-fee funding process. If approved
this means that graduate students will
fund only those programs that a major
ity of graduates support, and similarly
for undergraduates.
