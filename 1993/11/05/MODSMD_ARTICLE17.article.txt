## It ain't easy bein' sneezy 
### 
AUTUMN — the sunlight thins as
shadows lengthen, the nights grow
timid and cool, leaves blush hot
with shame and fall like memories to the
unremembering ground . . . and people
start sneezing on the back of my head in
lecture.
Yes, cold season is upon us and even
though the skies are still sunny, you had
better break out your raingear and wear
it to class. The sneezers and coughers are
out in full force and they're looking to get
YOU.
Pop psychologists say, "Good people
sometimes do bad things." This is
undoubtedly true for things like armed
robbery, adultery, etc. However, in-class
sneezers are evil incarnate and should
receive no mercy.
All right, I have been known to sniffle
during class. But I have tried to be as
inoffensive as possible about it. Nothing
touches my heart more than when I see
a young man or woman valiantly doing
battle against an incipient sneeze or
cough. Their faces twist with the effort
to suppress the explosion, sweat breaks
out on their foreheads as they clench the
arms of their chairs and dig their heels
into the Kresge carpet. If, after all their
struggle, a strangulated sneeze should
escape, I do not condemn them. They
are the true heros of our age for trying
to fight the menace of air-borne bacteria
and goo.

The coughers I abhor are the ones
who revel in it. They move closer to you
as they feel a cough coming on and then
let it fly in a torrent of sound and wind.
Worse are the sneezers. They ruin a
day faster than a Poli Sci midterm.
Walking to class, you've enjoyed the
delicate sunlight and the faint smell of
woodsmoke on the air and are pretend
ing you're at an Ivy League school.
You're awake and think you might stay
that way all through lecture. Your out
look is positive. Then some oaf in a
"Bikini Watchers" t-shirt lands in the
seat next to you and starts snorting. You
know what's coming and try to escape,
but the lecture's starting and you're
trapped. It's only a matter of time and
the sneezer will be sure to pick his
moment.
It's usually when you're just begin
ning to feel safe. The next second your
notes are suddenly damp and slimy and
he's laughing as he wipes his nose on his
bare arm.
Not all sneezers and coughers are this
overt. There are the demurely dressed
women who let out squeakingly high
"pooh" sounds and then giggle. There are
the dry hack coughers and the baritone
sneezers. In spite of their differences,
they all participate in a conspiracy
against the rest of us. They want to
spread their misery as far and wide as a
good sneeze will carry it. But they don't

stop there. They always wait until the
prof says something like "The most
important point here is . . to send forth
a chorus of sneezes, coughs and gurgles.
No one in the lecture hall has heard what
she said and the prof usually doesn't dare
try to repeat it. Not content to make us
all sick, they want to bring down the
curve as well.
I have a few suggestions for in-class
etiquette. 1) Wake up and smell the
Vicks. Do everything you can to stifle
your sniffling-sneezing-coughing-stuffy
head feeling BEFORE coming to class.
We'd all rather hear you smacking on a
cough drop than hacking up a small
typhoon. 2) Don't come to class if you
can't fix it. We promise to fill you in on
what happened and throw some Kleenex
into the bargain. 3) If you insist on com
ing, everybody with colds should sit in
the front. Guck travels forward, so sit
ting in the back just isn't cool. Besides,
the only person you'll infect is the pro
fessor.
Yeah, this part of the plan is a little
Machiavellian, but we all like to see a
"Class canceled due to illness" sign in
the morning.
