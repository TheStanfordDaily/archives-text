## Music for the masses, psychotherapy through song 
### 
TOP-40 singers should be shot. Mer
cilessly put to rest for creating a
Utopian universe in which Barbie
and Ken zip down the freeway of life with
out the Barbie Vette ever getting a flat. A
world where Skipper never, ever, tells
Ken that Barbie's not a real blonde and
Barbie never gets stretch marks.
Destroyed for their bit part in the
Casey Kasem reality which no longer tells
the troubles of my generation like it did
two bra sizes and five years ago. The
meaner, not-so-leaner me dines on only
the most bitter, dysfunctional, societally
rejected fare I can get my paws on. Hold
the hollow back beats and the Debbie Gib
son dilemmas if you please — life in the
age of angst does not satisfy my emotion
al appetite unless served with a thick slab
of frustration and a side order of anger.
Gimme the blue plate special.
I've always been a true believer in the
divine guidance of the song lyric. A faith
ful fan to any group who can describe how
I feel about my split ends and poor com
plexion at just that crucial moment. An
addict hooked on the quick fix that comes

when I feel that somewhere out there in
AM/FM land a lead singer understands
what I'm feeling on lonely Tuesday
nights.
Way in the back of my sinister mind my
inner rugrat sits curled up in the fetal
position, clutching on to the idea that all
the big, bad problems the world shoves
my way can be solved for $13.99 or my
money back, satisfaction guaranteed. My
paltry CD collection shielding my tiny
heart, I can deflect even the lowest of life's
biorythms. With just a tap of the remote
control, the best friend of my choice can
fill my ears, belting out advice and soli
darity, chasing all my troubles away.
Play "Misty" for me.
But as I sit, dizzied by the altitude of
my ultra-high loft, I have to wonder why I
trust Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder to carry
the burdens of my life on his shoulders.
Sitting smoking fat Havana cigars in
Corinthian leather Multi-Platinum Land,
the last thing on Eddie's mind has to be
my personal face plants and victories. He
probably wouldn't stop kissing stacks of
trillion-dollar bills for even half a second if

I told him about that A- on my last
midterm.
Maybe Morrissey would, if he knew
how human he makes me feel when he
spits out spritely upbeat lyrics detailing
fear and rage and twisted happiness.
When the man croons the loss of inno
cence or abuse politely taken I'm no
longer alone, swimming in my $19.95
comforter on the fringe of society. When
he pouts indignantly at the dominant
paradigm of choice or the oppressive insti
tutions of the cold, cruel world, I, with
random play on my side, can fulfill my
human-interaction quota and feel some
common bond, all within the comfort of
my own mind and with no money down.
Shoplifters of the world unite.
In fact, with minimum effort I can
even relate to those things that my mini
van-driving suburban mentality couldn't
even pretend are in the ballpark of poten
tial problems. Just as I squealed out
"Papa Don't Preach" with Madonna as a
junior-high schooler who wouldn't have
known how to have an illegitimate child if
given an instruction manual, I wail out

lyrics about war and suicide and hunger
with the passion of an a capella group on
a glazed-donut high.
Even better yet, I can usurp a song's
feeling and make myself depressed about
some fat, tap-dancing red-haired girl
dressed up like a bumble bee — revelling
in the fact that someone, somewhere is
more of an outcast than I. My honors the
sis, my lack of a respectable pair of black
flats and my fear of bridges seem small
camels compared to some of the gut
wrenching pathos coughed up onto the
airwaves.
Everybody cries.
And if I'm too much of a coward to go
down the hall and ask the guy who insists
on playing Patty Smyth's "Sometimes
Love Just Ain't Enough" hour after
painful hour what's wrong, I can hope
that Patty will curl up with him in her
arms that night. Just as others are unpre
pared to deal with the bitter thoughts that
correspond with the guitar-crunching
music du jour playing in my little love
den, I cower in my inability to relate to the
sophisticated opera fiends and the perky

Amy Grant worshipers of the world. What
could I possibly say, what could little ol'
me have to offer a dour classical music fan
in case of an emergency?
Unless it was Ludwig Van.
It's a steal, if you think about it. I can
scream with Nirvana in rage over missing
my advisor's office hours for the fourth
week in a row — while I let my real, in
the-flesh friends hear about the Simp
sons, the care package Aunt Martha sent
me and the well-articulated point I
wowed my FemStud class with minutes
ago. For just a few moments I can ditch
reality for a Clash slam pit, sweating
along in top form, leaving my life behind
— until I can present a rosy picture for sill
to see. A beautiful concept. Beautiful
results.
Face the music.

Tish promises to get un-depressed soon
and return to her usually perky self.

sons, the care package Aunt Martha sent
me and the well-articulated point I
wowed my FemStud class with minutes
ago. For just a few moments I can ditch
reality for a Clash slam pit, sweating
along in top form, leaving my life behind
— until I can present a rosy picture for sill
to see. A beautiful concept. Beautiful
results.
Face the music.

Tish promises to get un-depressed soon
and return to her usually perky self.

TOP-40 singers should be shot. Mer
cilessly put to rest for creating a
Utopian universe in which Barbie
and Ken zip down the freeway of life with
out the Barbie Vette ever getting a flat. A
world where Skipper never, ever, tells
Ken that Barbie's not a real blonde and
Barbie never gets stretch marks.
Destroyed for their bit part in the
Casey Kasem reality which no longer tells
the troubles of my generation like it did
two bra sizes and five years ago. The
meaner, not-so-leaner me dines on only
the most bitter, dysfunctional, societally
rejected fare I can get my paws on. Hold
the hollow back beats and the Debbie Gib
son dilemmas if you please — life in the
age of angst does not satisfy my emotion
al appetite unless served with a thick slab
of frustration and a side order of anger.
Gimme the blue plate special.
I've always been a true believer in the
divine guidance of the song lyric. A faith
ful fan to any group who can describe how
I feel about my split ends and poor com
plexion at just that crucial moment. An
addict hooked on the quick fix that comes

when I feel that somewhere out there in
AM/FM land a lead singer understands
what I'm feeling on lonely Tuesday
nights.
Way in the back of my sinister mind my
inner rugrat sits curled up in the fetal
position, clutching on to the idea that all
the big, bad problems the world shoves
my way can be solved for $13.99 or my
money back, satisfaction guaranteed. My
paltry CD collection shielding my tiny
heart, I can deflect even the lowest of life's
biorythms. With just a tap of the remote
control, the best friend of my choice can
fill my ears, belting out advice and soli
darity, chasing all my troubles away.
Play "Misty" for me.
But as I sit, dizzied by the altitude of
my ultra-high loft, I have to wonder why I
trust Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder to carry
the burdens of my life on his shoulders.
Sitting smoking fat Havana cigars in
Corinthian leather Multi-Platinum Land,
the last thing on Eddie's mind has to be
my personal face plants and victories. He
probably wouldn't stop kissing stacks of
trillion-dollar bills for even half a second if

I told him about that A- on my last
midterm.
Maybe Morrissey would, if he knew
how human he makes me feel when he
spits out spritely upbeat lyrics detailing
fear and rage and twisted happiness.
When the man croons the loss of inno
cence or abuse politely taken I'm no
longer alone, swimming in my $19.95
comforter on the fringe of society. When
he pouts indignantly at the dominant
paradigm of choice or the oppressive insti
tutions of the cold, cruel world, I, with
random play on my side, can fulfill my
human-interaction quota and feel some
common bond, all within the comfort of
my own mind and with no money down.
Shoplifters of the world unite.
In fact, with minimum effort I can
even relate to those things that my mini
van-driving suburban mentality couldn't
even pretend are in the ballpark of poten
tial problems. Just as I squealed out
"Papa Don't Preach" with Madonna as a
junior-high schooler who wouldn't have
known how to have an illegitimate child if
given an instruction manual, I wail out

lyrics about war and suicide and hunger
with the passion of an a capella group on
a glazed-donut high.
Even better yet, I can usurp a song's
feeling and make myself depressed about
some fat, tap-dancing red-haired girl
dressed up like a bumble bee — revelling
in the fact that someone, somewhere is
more of an outcast than I. My honors the
sis, my lack of a respectable pair of black
flats and my fear of bridges seem small
camels compared to some of the gut
wrenching pathos coughed up onto the
airwaves.
Everybody cries.
And if I'm too much of a coward to go
down the hall and ask the guy who insists
on playing Patty Smyth's "Sometimes
Love Just Ain't Enough" hour after
painful hour what's wrong, I can hope
that Patty will curl up with him in her
arms that night. Just as others are unpre
pared to deal with the bitter thoughts that
correspond with the guitar-crunching
music du jour playing in my little love
den, I cower in my inability to relate to the
sophisticated opera fiends and the perky

Amy Grant worshipers of the world. What
could I possibly say, what could little ol'
me have to offer a dour classical music fan
in case of an emergency?
Unless it was Ludwig Van.
It's a steal, if you think about it. I can
scream with Nirvana in rage over missing
my advisor's office hours for the fourth
week in a row — while I let my real, in
the-flesh friends hear about the Simp
sons, the care package Aunt Martha sent
me and the well-articulated point I
wowed my FemStud class with minutes
ago. For just a few moments I can ditch
reality for a Clash slam pit, sweating
along in top form, leaving my life behind
— until I can present a rosy picture for sill
to see. A beautiful concept. Beautiful
results.
