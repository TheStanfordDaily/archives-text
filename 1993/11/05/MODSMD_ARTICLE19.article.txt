## Men looking for glass slipper Kickers to face UCLA 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
Heck, they've got nothing to lose.
Check that. There is one thing they've got to
lose — the chance to become one of the most cel
ebrated Cinderella teams in Cardinal soccer his
tory.
All of the Stanford men's soccer squad's luck
and circumstance during the regular season is
out the window now. It is a real simple concept
from here on out — if you win, you keep playing;
and if you lose, you go home.
"First of all, we're very surprised, based on
our early season record, that we got into the
playoffs," said coach Colin Lindores on his Car
dinal's (8-8-2) 8 p.m. match in Los Angeles
tonight against the sixth-ranked UCLA Bruins
(16-2). "But we've obviously demonstrated that
we can play. Now we're playing against probably
the top team on the West Coak and it will be a
real challenge for our young team."
Stanford has crawled from the depths of
despair — a disastrous 2-6-1 start — to an unde
feated record in their final seven games. The
momentum certainly is there, but the question
is whether or not its enough to overpower the
Bruins.
"They've got a lot of talent," said forward
Ricky Goad regarding UCLA. "They play fast,
they re athletic, they've got a good program and
a good coach. It's going to be a challenge, but it's
one that we accept and accept willingly."
With tonight's game against UCLA, the Car
dinal will be playing in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation playoffs for the third year in
a row. In the previous two years Stanford has
also advanced to the NCAA playoffs, losing in
the first round both times.
"We're going in [to the UCLA
game] with the attitude that we can
play with anybody," said senior
midfielder Niels Bruckner. "A lot of
top teams have been beaten by
lower-ranked teams this year."
The wildfires in the Los Angeles
area may have clouded the South
ern California skies, but the Cardi
nal hopes not to get burned on the
UCLA soccer field. They are enter

ing this game with a clear mind and
a logical outlook.
"If we win, we win, and if we lose,
we lose," said Lindores. "I think that's
a realistic attitude. Nobody on this
team has got pie-in-the-sky expecta
tions of a national championship."
Last year the Cardinal defeated
UCLA in the MSPF playoffs via
penalty kicks. This year, however, the
Stanford squad is much younger and
this UCLA team is still a powerhouse.
"UCLA and its reputation is big
ger than life," said Lindores. "But
we can beat them again, and the
players realize this."

Stanford's recurring habit of
playing well against good teams and
lousy against bad teams gives them
a bit of an edge against the Bruins.
Plus, the pressure is resting square
ly on the backs of the boys from LA.
"Reputation-wise they've cer
tainly got more to lose than we do,"
Lindores said. "We're not supposed
to even be here, and we're certainly
not supposed to win."
If such an event were to occur,
however, the Cardinal would play
again at 2 p.m. Sunday. They would
play the winner of the
Northridge/Air Force contest.
