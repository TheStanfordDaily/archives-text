## Men looking for glass slipper Kickers to face UCLA 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
Heck, they've got nothing to lose.
Check that. There is one thing they've got to
lose — the chance to become one of the most cel
ebrated Cinderella teams in Cardinal soccer his
tory.
All of the Stanford men's soccer squad's luck
and circumstance during the regular season is
out the window now. It is a real simple concept
from here on out — if you win, you keep playing;
and if you lose, you go home.
"First of all, we're very surprised, based on
our early season record, that we got into the
playoffs," said coach Colin Lindores on his Car
dinal's (8-8-2) 8 p.m. match in Los Angeles
tonight against the sixth-ranked UCLA Bruins
(16-2). "But we've obviously demonstrated that
we can play. Now we're playing against probably
the top team on the West Coak and it will be a
real challenge for our young team."
Stanford has crawled from the depths of
despair — a disastrous 2-6-1 start — to an unde
feated record in their final seven games. The
momentum certainly is there, but the question
is whether or not its enough to overpower the
Bruins.
"They've got a lot of talent," said forward
Ricky Goad regarding UCLA. "They play fast,
they re athletic, they've got a good program and
a good coach. It's going to be a challenge, but it's
one that we accept and accept willingly."
With tonight's game against UCLA, the Car
dinal will be playing in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation playoffs for the third year in
a row. In the previous two years Stanford has
also advanced to the NCAA playoffs, losing in
the first round both times.
