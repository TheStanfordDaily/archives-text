# Trojans again
## Polo to play use, UCLA 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
After last weekend's three-game sweep which includ
ed a nail-biting 11-10 victory over No. 2 USC, the top
ranked Stanford water polo team (18-3) will now travel
south to hostile waters, visiting No. 6 UCLA (11-10) and
USC (13-6) today and tomorrow.
Coach Dante Dettamanti and his team are focused
on grabbing two wins this weekend to virtually assure
that Stanford will be named the top seed at the NCAA
Championships over Thanksgiving break.
"If we win both, we'll have only three losses and USC
will have seven," Dettamanti said. "We'd have a four
game advantage in the loss column with only five left to
play in the regular season. We'd be in great shape."
"This will be a very tough weekend," he continued.
"We're playing the No. 6 and No. 2 teams back-to-back
in their pools. If we lose, we're right back in the thick of
things with the conference tournament coming up next
week."
This weekend's opponents are two teams headed in
entirely different directions. UCLA has been virtually
eliminated from an NCAA berth, while USC is consid
ered as one of the co-favorites, along with California and
Stanford, to win the NCAA title.
The Cardinal will need to overcome the handicap of
playing on the road, which has traditionally caused
Stanford teams difficulty while competing in LA
"UCLA's pool is very narrow, which makes it hard to
make an outlet pass," said senior Antonio Busquets.
"That kills our counterattack. We'll have to start look
ing at other ways to score during the game."
Another key will be the containment of Bruin Ail-
American candidate Chris Kellerman. Sophomore Jere-
my Laster will be called on to keep
Kellerman in check.
Against USC, team defense
could make the difference for both
teams. Dettamanti expects another
shootout with the Trojans after
last week's combined 21 goals in
Stanford's win. USC followed that
game with a 15-13 victory over Cal
ifornia.
"Defense will be the key to vic
tories this weekend," said Ail-
American goaltender Larry
Bercutt. "USC is a very good offen
sive team. If we shut them down
we'll win."
Stanford may have to compete
with junior holeman Frank
Schneider playing limited time.
Schneider will meet the team in LA
Friday afternoon, hours before
gametime, due to family business.
"Frank has only had one work
out this week," Dettamanti said.
"I'm not sure what kind of shape
he'll be in. Frank will be coming in
off the bench and we plan to use
Jeremy Laster at set."

Martin's play was instrumental in leading Stanford to a 2-0 victory
over Santa Clara before a crowd of nearly 3,500.
