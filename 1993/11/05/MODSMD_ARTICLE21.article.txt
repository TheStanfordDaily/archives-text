Bring on Carolina, baby.
The Stanford women's soccer
team justified its No. 2 ranking with
a 2-0 victory over fourth-ranked
Santa Clara last night at the Bron
cos' Buck Shaw Stadium before a
crowd of nearly 3,500. Combining a
stifling defense and scintillating sec
ond-half ball control, the Cardinal
(16-2-1) assured itself of the number
one seed in the Western Regionals by
disposing of the Broncos (14-4-0).
"The defense kept us in the first
half," head coach lan Sawyers said.
"I thought our back line was tremen
dous. They were so composed under
the pressure and totally committed
to what we needed to do."
In her last regular-season game,
forward Sarah Rafanelli demonstrat-

Ed her All-American ability by scor
ing both of the Cardinal's goals dur
ing a two-minute span in the second
half.
The first goal came when fresh
man Erin Martin found Rafanelli on
the right side of the goal box with a
twisting header, putting Rafanelli
into position for the goal.
"The ball she got from Erin was a
great pass," Sawyers said. "Sarah did
really well to get into scoring posi
tion. She got in front of both the
defender and the goalkeeper."
To create her second goal, a
speedy Rafinelli raced past one Bron
co defender on a breakaway and out
muscled two others for the ball,
finally putting the shot past an
advancing Santa Clara goalkeeper.
"She created both of her goals,"
said Sawyers. "It wasn't the fault of
the defense. She jumped on some

loose balls and really made the most
of them."
The first 15 minutes of the game
saw a physical Bronco team out-hus
tle the Cardinal to nearly every loose
ball. However, an indirect kick by
Jessica Fischer shifted the momen
tum to Stanford for the rest of the
game as the Cardinal started to exert
its signature midfield pressure.
Although Fischer's blast did not
find the back of the net, a change was
noticeable in Santa Clara's play
immediately following the shot.
Stanford found the middle of the
field open to breakaways as Santa
Clara tried to defend against the long
pass. After bringing the Bronco mid
field closer to the ball as the attack
started, the Cardinal went back to
the long pass and stretched the field,
finding Martin and Rafanelli open
downfield on numerous breakaways.

"I thought Erin was world-class
tonight," Sawyers said. "That's a
very bold statement to make, but it
was the best I'd seen her play in a
long time."
After trading shots at the end of
the first half, Stanford came out in
the second period with a renewed
aggression. Controlling possession in
the midfield, the Cardinal defensive
line rarely broke down to allow a shot
on goal. The determination of the
Stanford team was shown in a small
altercation between Cardinal goal
keeper Leslie Garrard and Bronco
midfielder Margaret Krawiec. The
two players tangled in front of the
Stanford goal after a corner kick,
with Garrard pushing her away
forcefully.
"The defense made my job easy,"
