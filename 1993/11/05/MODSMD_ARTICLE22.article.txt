# Norwood: He works hard for his money
## A
						walk-on three years ago, he has become a key player for the Cardinal 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Inside linebacker Toby Norwood is what you would
call a blue-collar football player. Whether it's on the
gridiron, in the weight room or on the practice fields,
there's work to be done.
"It's just a matter of going out there and taking care
of business," said Norwood, who is a senior defensive
captain in his second year as starter for the Cardinal.
Norwood's business-like attitude has taken him a
long way from his high-school days in Columbus, Ga,
where he was a workhorse on his high-school team. As

a linebacker, fullback, punter and kicker, Norwood led
his team to a 13-1 record his senior year and was
named First-Team All-State.
However, despite his work and success, Norwood
didn't think much about playing football in college.
"I thought about it, but I also did track," Norwood
said, who competed in the shot-put, discus and mile
relay. "I really enjoyed that, so I probably wanted to do
that in college more than football."
Stanford recruited Norwood to be on the track
team, and he decided to attend. But the idea of football
was still nagging at the back of his mind.
"I decided I'd give it a shot," Norwood said. "I didn't

want to be feeling the rest of my life, 'Well maybe I
could have done this, maybe I could have done that."'
Norwood sent the Stanford football coaches some
tapes of his play, and he was asked to come out early
and attempt to walk on the team. But the transition
from high school wouldn't be easy.
"I was pretty intimidated, especially seeing all those
big linemen we used to have — Hoyem and Cassidy
and Cavanaugh," Norwood said with a laugh. "I was
really scared of those guys, because they all had funny
looking haircuts then. Hell, I still am scared of those
guys. Let's face it, they're not normal."
After the initial shock wore off, it was down to busi
ness. Although Norwood's goal was to "just play one
play," the coaches observed the freshman's hard work
ethic and choose him to play on special teams.
In Stanford's upset win over Notre Dame last sea
son, Norwood played on the kickoff, kickoff return,
punt and punt return teams, and recovered a fumble.
At the end of the year, the walk-on received the team's
"Best Freshman" award.
During his sophomore year Norwood saw more spe
cial-teams experience, and reveled in it. Collecting 16
tackles and playing in every game, Norwood was one
of the team's best special-teams player.
"I was just so excited that we had a good team,"
Norwood said. "It was a lot of fun that year. Coach
(Dennis) Green was just the best guy. I've got a lot of
respect for him. He was a real blue-collar kind of
coach, I think. He expected us to work hard, and for
the large part, we did."
Again, Norwood's hard work paid off. The day
before Green announced that he was headed off to
coach in the NFL, Norwood was called into Green's
office. Green told the sophomore that he was getting
put on scholarship.
The next year, Norwood made an even bigger
impact. With an injury to starting linebacker Coy
Gibbs in spring practice, Norwood began seeing play
ing time in practice with the first-team unit. When the
season began against Texas A&M, Gibbs wasn't quite
recovered, so Norwood started the game. He never
relinquished the position.
By the time the year ended, Norwood had started 12
games, recording 49 tackles, a sack and five tackles
for-a-loss. The defense as a whole ended the year rated
among the top 10 in the nation. But Norwood took the
success as all part of the business at hand.
"I don't think it was all that big of a surprise, we had
a lot of guys back for that defense, a lot of good play
ers," Norwood said, and then added after a moment's
thought, "and just because I was a walk-on doesn't
mean that I don't believe in myself or my abilities. I've
always had confidence in myself."
That confidence has made Norwood a leader of the
defense this year. Norwood's style, however, is to let
actions speak for themselves.
U I feel like I don't have a lot of good things to say a
lot of times," Norwood said laughingly. "I mean,
maybe I'll have a good thought, but it seems like when
I say it, it doesn't come out the way I want it to."
While not vocal, Norwood is nevertheless the heart
and soul of the Stanford defense. His 68 tackles (8.5
