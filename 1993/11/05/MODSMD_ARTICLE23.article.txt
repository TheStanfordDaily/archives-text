# One last time for all the marbles
## Field hockey to play Cal for championship, NCAA ticket 
### Christian Leone Staff writer 
The tide has turned.
The Stanford and California
field hockey teams have clashed
three times this season, with Cal
winning the first two contests in
overtime.
But in game three, momentum
shifted to the Cardinal. In last
Saturday's tense, well-fought
match, Stanford preserved a 1-0
victory behind All-Amencan Sara
Hallock's Northern Pacific Con
ference leading 25th goal.
Now, Stanford hopes to ensure
that their ship will come in. The
8-7 Cardinal will face off against
the 6-7 Golden Bears at Berkeley
today for the Northern Pacific
Conference Championship and a
ticket to the NCAA Champi
onships
"This is it," said coach Sheryl
Johnson. "Winner takes all."
In California, the Cardinal
sees a team that has slipped of
late. Cal lost to the University of
Pacific, 2-1, in overtime earlier
this week, giving them the same
conference record as the Cardi
nal.

"Cal has been really lucky,"
said senior Cardinal defender
Markley Bavinger. "UOP was the
beginning of a downward trend
and we are going to finish it."
Other team members are
equally optimistic.
"We are at our peak right now
and we are ready for this game,"
said senior Gina Bianchini. "We
will be victorious."
Stanford will be led into the
match by Hallock, the third most
prolific scorer in the nation. How
ever, Hallock will be aided by a
Cardinal defense that has im
proved throughout the season.
With the leadership of Bavinger
and fellow senior Danielle
Beynet, the Cardinal has allowed
only one goal in the last four
games, while netting 15 them
selves.
Bavinger epitomizes the
toughness inherent in this year's
squad. Early in most recent game
against Cal, Bavinger was taken
out of the game with an injured
finger.
"They took a shot and
somehow the ball hit my
thumb and broke it in three
places," said Bavinger. Al

though she saw little action in
the remainder of the Cal
game, the defender will play
in today's match.
While Stanford has been domi
nating opponents, Cal has been
squeaking by. By way of compari
son, Cardinal goalie Loretta
Hidalgo has been excellent in net,
allowing a mere 1.4 goals a game,
while California's Kasandra
Cronin lets in almost almost
twice that average.
Offensively, the upcoming
match looks like a rout. Stanford
has outscored opponents 42-23,
while the Bears have been
outscored 25-20. Behind Hallock
and Elise Morgan (6 goals, 4
assists) Stanford's offense has
been unstoppable. Meanwhile,
the only semblance of an offense
for Cal is play maker Ilse Akker
mans, who with six goals and four
assists leads the overachieving
Berkeley squad.
Based on this statistical evi
dence, Stanford believes that it is
high tide for their NCAA Tourna
ment hopes.
"We're a juggernaut," said
freshman Karla Peterson "We're
on our way to the NCAAs."
