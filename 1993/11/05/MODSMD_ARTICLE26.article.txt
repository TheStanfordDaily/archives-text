## Montoya 'psyched up' to battle Eiser 
### 
An all-expenses-paid vacation
to Crete if you know what the fol
lowing events have in common: a
25-hour Halloween, my getting
kissed at Full Moon on the Quad,
a Republican winning the New
York City mayoral election and
Jesse Jackson and A 1 Sharpton
remaining silent through David
Dinkins' concession speech.
Give up? Well, you get a one
way ticket for stating the obvious
— that they all (but one) took
place in the last seven days — and
a round-trip pass for using Aris
totelian logic and realizing that
the chance of each (much less all)
of them occurring is incalculable.
Like dividing by zero, these things
are just not supposed to happen.
Shocked as I was by these
recent developments, I turned to
someone who knows about defy
ing the odds — and my high
school by name — Dean of Under
graduate Admissions James Mon-.
toya. Upon learning about my 6-4
windfall last week (in which I kept
Donald Kennedy to a 5-5 mark)
Montoya gathered his staff
around the secret random num
ber generator that picks who gets
into this hallowed institution and
decided that my improbable

three-game (21-23 to 18-26) lead
on my guests must be eliminated.
"Hello, Andy, my name is
James Montoya. You defeated my
former boss. Prepare to die." With

that rousing introduction, lines
from Wednesday's Chronicle and
home teams in CAPS, here comes
my shot at .500:
USC -10-1/2 vs. Stanford
Andy: Stanford +10-1/2. Follow
ing my nose to the scent of home
cooking, I will be on a plane enjoy
ing an aerial view of the Southern
California fires as you read this. I
will watch my high school team
crush its arch-rival tonight (cer
tainly), then be on hand as the
Cardinal extinguishes the Tro
jans' Rose Bowl hopes tomorrow
(hopefully).

James Gang: Stanford +10-1/2.
"After last week, the Cardinal is
psyched to win," spokesman Mon
toya said. Not quite, James. In
fact, after squeaking by Oregon

State last week, the Cardinal
would be psyched to survive this
contest. Nice use of the word
"psyched," though.
ARIZONA STATE -3-1/2 vs.
California
Andy: California +3-1/2. Golden:
our enigmatic foes across the Bay
opened with a 5-0 record. Bears:
those same foes have played pro
gressively worse in their three
losses since. Needing a win to
ensure that their Thanksgiving
weekend game in Hawaii won't be
their last, the Golden Bears
should put Bruce Snyder and his

Sun Devils back in place after an
anomalous triumph over Wash
ington a week ago.
James Gang: Arizona State —3-
1/2. Montoya expressed sympathy
for his counterpart at Cal, reiter
ating the Golden Bears' promo
tional "Everyone's getting into
Cal" slogan as reason enough to
pick against our Axe-less rivals.
Washington -13-1/2 vs. ORE
GON STATE
Andy: Washington -13-1/2. Pity
poor OSU. After leaving here with
a near-upset, they come home to
face the three-time defending
Pacific 10 Conference champions
fresh off a huge loss. Leave it to
the Beavers to sink into such a
scheduling quagmire.
James Gang: Washington -13-
1/2. Proving once and for all that
a criminal record does not put you
out of favor with the Admissions
Office, Montoya's posse took the
Huskies in a-romp.
Ucla -7-1/2 vs. WASHING
TON STATE
Andy: Washington State +7-1/2.
The Bruins now own the inside
