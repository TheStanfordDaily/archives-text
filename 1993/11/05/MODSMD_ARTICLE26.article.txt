## Montoya 'psyched up' to battle Eiser 
### 
An all-expenses-paid vacation
to Crete if you know what the fol
lowing events have in common: a
25-hour Halloween, my getting
kissed at Full Moon on the Quad,
a Republican winning the New
York City mayoral election and
Jesse Jackson and A 1 Sharpton
remaining silent through David
Dinkins' concession speech.
Give up? Well, you get a one
way ticket for stating the obvious
— that they all (but one) took
place in the last seven days — and
a round-trip pass for using Aris
totelian logic and realizing that
the chance of each (much less all)
of them occurring is incalculable.
Like dividing by zero, these things
are just not supposed to happen.
Shocked as I was by these
recent developments, I turned to
someone who knows about defy
ing the odds — and my high
school by name — Dean of Under
graduate Admissions James Mon-.
toya. Upon learning about my 6-4
windfall last week (in which I kept
Donald Kennedy to a 5-5 mark)
Montoya gathered his staff
around the secret random num
ber generator that picks who gets
into this hallowed institution and
decided that my improbable

three-game (21-23 to 18-26) lead
on my guests must be eliminated.
"Hello, Andy, my name is
James Montoya. You defeated my
former boss. Prepare to die." With

that rousing introduction, lines
from Wednesday's Chronicle and
home teams in CAPS, here comes
my shot at .500:
USC -10-1/2 vs. Stanford
Andy: Stanford +10-1/2. Follow
ing my nose to the scent of home
cooking, I will be on a plane enjoy
ing an aerial view of the Southern
California fires as you read this. I
will watch my high school team
crush its arch-rival tonight (cer
tainly), then be on hand as the
Cardinal extinguishes the Tro
jans' Rose Bowl hopes tomorrow
(hopefully).

James Gang: Stanford +10-1/2.
"After last week, the Cardinal is
psyched to win," spokesman Mon
toya said. Not quite, James. In
fact, after squeaking by Oregon

State last week, the Cardinal
would be psyched to survive this
contest. Nice use of the word
"psyched," though.
ARIZONA STATE -3-1/2 vs.
California
Andy: California +3-1/2. Golden:
our enigmatic foes across the Bay
opened with a 5-0 record. Bears:
those same foes have played pro
gressively worse in their three
losses since. Needing a win to
ensure that their Thanksgiving
weekend game in Hawaii won't be
their last, the Golden Bears
should put Bruce Snyder and his

Sun Devils back in place after an
anomalous triumph over Wash
ington a week ago.
James Gang: Arizona State —3-
1/2. Montoya expressed sympathy
for his counterpart at Cal, reiter
ating the Golden Bears' promo
tional "Everyone's getting into
Cal" slogan as reason enough to
pick against our Axe-less rivals.
Washington -13-1/2 vs. ORE
GON STATE
Andy: Washington -13-1/2. Pity
poor OSU. After leaving here with
a near-upset, they come home to
face the three-time defending
Pacific 10 Conference champions
fresh off a huge loss. Leave it to
the Beavers to sink into such a
scheduling quagmire.
James Gang: Washington -13-
1/2. Proving once and for all that
a criminal record does not put you
out of favor with the Admissions
Office, Montoya's posse took the
Huskies in a-romp.
Ucla -7-1/2 vs. WASHING
TON STATE
Andy: Washington State +7-1/2.
The Bruins now own the inside

track in the Rose Bowl race,
and you know what that
means: it's time for a squeaker.
Feeling artificially high after
the Arizona romp, UCLA will
remain in the driver's seat —
barely — after the Cougars use
some ugly fall weather to their
advantage for three quarters.
James Gang: UCLA -7-1/2.
"We liked the Bruins' energy,"
Montoya said of his gulag. Hmmm,
energy ... maybe that explains
why they almost allowed us to
erase an 11-point lead in just under
two minutes a few weeks back.

ARIZONA —6 vs. Oregon
Andy: Arizona —6. Back in the
Mountain Time Zone, the Wild
cats should turn back the clock
and remind the Ducks who the
class of the conference was just
one week ago.
James Gang: Arizona —6. In
another loss-recovery special,
Montoya and crew admitted that
the Wildcats should make the
Ducks feel the pain.
TENNESSEE -13 vs.
Louisville
Andy: Louisville +13. Possibly
the most underrated team in
the nation, Howard Schnellen
berger's 7-1 Cardinals (that's
Cardinals with an "s") should at
least trade blows with the Vol

unteers before losing a close
decision.
James Gang; Louisville +13. "We
were very impressed with
Louisville," Montoya said. Atten
tion potential transfers.
KANSAS CITY -3-1/2 vs.
Green Bay
Andy: Kansas City -3-1/2. Much
as I hate to admit it, the Chiefs
are pretty good, especially at
Arrowhead Stadium. Look for
them to send the Packers packing
with a loss.
James Gang: Green Bay +3-1/2.
"Joe may be hurt, but the Pack
ers' spirit will carry them to victo
ry," an obviously confused Mon
toya mumbled. Call me if you can
figure out he meant.
