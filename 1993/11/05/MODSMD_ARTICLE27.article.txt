## East of Admissions: a Dean's day 
### 
In the Beginning
I wasn't your typical Stanford student: three
of my four years were spent in all-frosh dorms (I
mean, residence halls), I actually liked dorm food
(I mean, University dining) and, during my
junior year, I announced to my friends (and any
one else who would listen) that I would one day
be Stanford's Dean of Admissions. Twenty-some
odd years later, I'm looking at the world from the
second floor of the Old Union. So, what's the view
like from here? Let me tell you
An Identity Crisis
Let's face it, I began the position with a clear
disadvantage: my first name doesn't rhyme with
"dean." "Dean Jean" had it made. Now that I've
settled into the position, having performed twice
in Gaieties (and currently preparing for my third
role), it's time to settle into an image.
Dean Jim? Ho-hum.
Dean Jaime? Eh.
Dean Monty? Better suited to a license plate
on a Dodge.
Last year a few Wilbur residents yelled out,
"Hey, James Dean." After their third shout, I
realized they were calling out to me.
I combed my hair back with one stroke of my
hand before looking up to acknowledge their
greeting. Had I found that suitable identity as
the new "James Dean" — a rebel with a cause:
ED-U-CA-TION? Strong, yes. Quiet, yes. Out
side, yet inside, yes, yes.
If it hadn't been for my Brooks Brothers blaz
er and horn-rimmed glasses, I might have
accepted the role; I might have said yes to James
Dean. So here I sit, staring out my Old Union
window, still searching....
Mew from the Stage
Another interesting vantage point is that
from the stage of Memorial Auditorium. It is
from there, on opening day, that I watch parents
of entering students beam with pride; and anx
ious first-day frosh wonder why they were even
admitted.
It's also from there that I perform in Gaieties.
The past two scripts have been great — last year
I sang about malong Weenie Pie, and my first
year I declared a-la-Princess Bride, "My name is
James Montoya You killed my student. Prepare
to die!" It's a small piece of Hollywood and the
glamour of it is almost too much for this kid
from San Jose.
Do you remember last year's performance? I
had several one-liners and one juicy solo For
tunately, the orchestra covered for me when I for
got to open my mouth at the beginning of my solo.
I even screwed up my speaking part that night
and tripped on stage doing the Cha-Cha Fortu
nately, those of you in the audience were very for
giving — a quality I now seek in applicants.
Although I am sworn to secrecy on the details
of this year's Gaieties script, I will tell you that
this year's role may land me on Broadway. It's a
doozie.
Typical Day
On some days (no — on most days!) I over
schedule my life. At age 40 (yes, 40), I juggle
three calendars, though I take great pride in the
fact that I never carried a calendar as a high
school student, as many do today. (Pen scribbles

on my hand, arm, or shirt seemed sufficient
then.)
Today it seems we must schedule our lives
well enough in advance to assure we'll have time
to be spontaneous. It shouldn't surprise you
then that my schedule is virtually planned week
by-week through January, 1995.
I can tell you that on Dec. 3 I'll cook dinner for
friends, and that on Feb. 19 I fly to Denver. I've
set aside June 2 and 3 to do "serious thinking"
on educational issues before heading to Texas to
speak to alumni the weekend of Sept. 17. I'll
speak on the use of standardized testing in
Washington, D.C. the last weekend of October,
and I'll be at a College Board Trustees Meeting
Jan. 8 and 9,1995. I've saved Jan. 10 to be spon
taneous!
Typical days are never typical: take yester
day...

6:30 am Morning run.
7:30 am Fundraising meeting for
Theatre Works.
9:00 am Think about Daily article; resp
ond to six phone messages.
10:00 am Meet with graduate student
intern.
11:00 am Meet with John Bunnell, Direc
tor of Freshman Admission, to
discuss "yield" study.
12:00 noon Drink cup-of-soup at my desk
and write first draft of the Daily
article.
1:00-3:00 pm Student Affairs Executive Board
Meeting.
3:00 pm (Another) budget meeting.
4:00 pm Respond to alumni letters —
another diversion from writing
the Daily article.
5:15 pm Pick up clothes from the cleaners.
6:00 pm Branner presentation on Public
Service.
B:lspm Write Srst draft ofthe Daily article.
(Instead I think about getting a
"life"; make list for next visit to
the store; review my calendar for
the next year, and recycle.)
9:00 pm Late dinner (welWeserved fast
food run).
10:00 pm Panic about the Daily article.
11:30 pm Contemplate an all-nighter.
Give up on that idea.

Why Do Deadlines Exist?
Even the most intelligent people have diffi
culty with deadlines. Did you know that nearly
50 percent of Stanford's 14,000 applications are
mailed on the deadline? It's moments like this in
attempting to write something memorable and
humorous for The Daily that I am empathetic to
the thousands and thousands of Stanford appli
cants who sit at their desks on December 14, the
night before the deadline, contemplating their
favorite quotation or the best conversation
they've had (this year's essay questions). I sus
pect that this year, like the past two, their panic
will lead to some of the more painful essays I
read. It's in that moment of desperation that an
applicant convinces himself or herself that an

(now with retsin ™ )

essay on "vomiting" will help them stand out in
the applicant pool. It usually does, but the end
results are not typically those desired.
Keep this in mind. Graduate school is just
around the corner ....
Eating, Running, and Favorite Restaurants
"Some people eat to run; others run to eat."
I think a lot about food — and 1 know that is
why I am a runner. My taste runs from The
Four Seasons in New York City to Taco Bell. (In
case you are interested, the Taco Bell on El
Camino in Mountain View is of higher quality
than its counterpart on San Antonio Road.)
Now that a Taco Bell is moving into Tresid
der, some of you may find it convenient to con
vince yourselves that Taco Bell is a healthy fast
food choice. Wrong. Though better than some,
the calorie and fat counts are relatively high:
My Dinner Calorics Fat (g)
Tacos (3) 549 33
Tostada (1) 243 11
Bean buirito with
green sauce (1) 447 14
TOTALS 1,239 58
Other top-ten restaurants on my list include
Periyali (W. 20th) and II Vagabondo (E. 62nd) in
New York City; Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe; Uncle
Julio's in Dallas; Hacienda Morales in Mexico
City; Janos in Tucson; and Ming's in Palo Alto
(great chicken salad!).
Good Night
It's a Friday night, just before 10:00 p.m. The
phone rings at Casa Montoya:
"Hello."
"Dean Montoya?"
"Yes."
"This is the University operator. There is a
student on the line who says he must talk to you
tonight. Should I put him through?"
"What's his name? .... Never mind. Just put
him through...."
"Go ahead, please."
"Hello. This is Jim Montoya."
"Mr. Montoya, thanks for taking the call. I'm
an applicant, and I need your help. I'm taking
my achievements tomorrow morning and I want
to know which tests you prefer I take. I really
like your school, and I don't want to screw up my
chances of getting in. So, which of the exams do
you personally prefer?"
The conversation goes on for 10 minutes.. ..
Before it ends Dean Montoya asks, "By the
way, what's your name?"
The student responds, "Do you really think
I'm going to tell you?"
