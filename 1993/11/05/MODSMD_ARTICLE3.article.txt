# Stanford gets a wake-up call
## 'Good Morning America' to air from Quad 
### Elissa Lee Staff writer 
Stanford students will get to say "Good
Morning America" to the nation when ABC's
popular morning show, co-hosted by Charlie
Gibson and Joan Lunden, is taped in the inner
Quad on Tuesday.
Unlike their past programs taped at univer
sities — such as the "How Do I Get My Kid Into
Harvard?" episode — the Stanford-based pro
gram is intended to be more general. "The pro
gram will cover a broad range of things and will

be less news-heavy than normal," Gibson said.
An audience of 300, mainly consisting of
Stanford students, will be present for the 8
a.m. to 10 a.m. taping. The audience was se
lected to be representative of the student body,
according to Jack Hubbard, associate director
of News Service, who is handling the Universi
ty's part in the event.
Selecting students for the audience was
more advantageous than selling tickets, Hub
bard said, because he needed a commitment
from students that they would show up for the
taping. The audience will mainly consist of stu

dents, faculty and staff, but local relatives of
Lunden are also expected to be there, seated in
the VIP section.
Hubbard said he had no control over the au
dience size. "They (ABC) outlined what they
wanted," he said.
The guest list is still tentative, but inter
views with Distinguished Hoover Institution
Fellow and former Secretary of State George
Shultz, head football coach Bill Walsh, and
Olympic medalist Summer Sanders are
planned. The program is still con
sidering having panels of gradu
ate or undergraduate students to
discuss education in California.
"Everything is running as
smooth as silk," Hubbard said.
The show's producers have
been filming interviews and vari
ous aspects of university life for

the past two months. On Tuesday
morning, a blimp will fly over the
Quad to provide a bird's eye view
of the Farm for viewers.
The morning show visits a uni
versity during each of their "Bus
Tour" trips. College campuses
possess a great amount of energy
and tend to be interesting places,
Gibson said.
In the past, the show has visit
ed Northwestern, the University
of Tennessee at Chattanooga and
Harvard. Gibson said Stanford

was an obvious choice, consider
ing the area the "Great Pacific
Coast Highway Bus Tour" cov
ers.
The bus tour is planned to
start at San Simeon, continue on
to Carmel and Monterey, the
Napa Valley and end in San Fran
cisco.
The show, which is usually
broadcast live, will be aired the
following day due to the three
hour time difference between the
East and West Coasts.
