# Student robbed on Palm Drive
## 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
On a dark and silent Palm Drive early last Saturday
morning, two men attacked and robbed a student on
his way home from a Friday night out.
Senior Aaron Ross was near the intersection of
Palm Drive and Roth Way at 2 a.m. on Saturday, when
two men suddenly stepped out of the bushes. He said
that one of the men punched him on the left cheek,
knocking him to the ground, and the two proceeded to
take his wallet and flee.
Ross had been at the club, 42nd Street, celebrating
a friend's birthday. The person who gave him a ride to
the club left before him, so he decided to walk home.
Ross said he had been drinking, and was feeling the
effects, although he was "not completely drunk."
"It was a long walk, so I was kind of zoning," Ross said.
"Next thing I know, two guys come in front of me. Before
I knew what was happening, [one of them] hit me."
Ross said another man was standing behind the two
men who attacked him. After they took his wallet, they
looked for his keys, which he didn't have with him.
The men, whom Ross could only describe as large
black males wearing wool caps, ran away after telling

him to stand still and count to 20. At the count of three,
Ross said he heard a car start and leave the scene.
Stanford Police have no suspects or leads in the rob
bery, according to Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
"I ran to the police station and called the police,"
Ross said. "But [there was] not much they could do."
Ross said his nose was "really bleeding," and he had
several cuts and bruises, but nothing severe. Besides
his driver's license and some membership cards, the
thieves didn't get much, he said.
"They were probably pretty disappointed, because
there was only a dollar in my wallet, and I canceled my
credit cards," he said.
Niemeyer said that although strong-arm robbery is
a "very infrequent" occurrence on campus, everyone
should be careful.
"This is why we caution people," he said. "Even if
you're a male, it's not a good idea to walk by yourself."
As for Ross, he is able to see the humor in what he
calls the "ultimate irony" of the incident. He stayed
later than the friend who gave him a ride because he
was in the process of getting a phone number from a
woman he met at the club.
"The number was in my wallet," Ross said, and
laughed.
