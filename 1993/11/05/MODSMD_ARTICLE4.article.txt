# Day of Dead more than tricks, treats
## 
### Jose J. Gutierrez 
1 he Stanford community can taste a bite of Mex
icano/Chicano cultura tonight, as El Centro Chi
cano, along with MEChA, presents its annual cele
bration of Dia de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead.
Although this tradition is a distant cousin of Hal
loween, it is much more than just tricks or treats.
Los Dias de los Muertos, usually observed on the
first two days in November, begins with El Dia de los
Angelitos, in commemoration of dead children. On
the second day, the "older people" arrive from
Mictlan, the Aztec place of the dead.
As they arrive after a tiring journey, they find an
altar covered with offerings such as food, family
memorabilia and liquor. El Centro, Casa Zapata and
the Law School each have arranged altars for public
viewing.
Tonight at 7 p.m. in El Centro, traditional danc
ing, poetry readings and Latin American rhythms
will bring the holiday to life.
Lisa Monz6n, the student financial coordinator
for El Centro, explained that there are two reasons
for this annual event: first, it allows those in the
Mexicano/Chicano culture who understand this tra
dition to participate, and secondly, it helps to expose
both those in the culture and others who aren't to
become familiar with it.
The event helps "to show how we in the Mexi
cano/Chicano community at Stanford express our
selves," Monz6n said. The celebration is open to the
entire Stanford community, and usually draws
about 150 students to the El Centro lounge to wit
ness it.
"Last year, we had people sit
ting near the entrance stairs of El
Centro," said senior Jorge Solis,
the education rights coordinator
for MEChA, a Chicano/Latino
student group. "Centro may be
small, yet it holds the spirit we
consider necessary for El Dia de
los Muertos. It's cozy, and the
spirit makes up for its size."
This year's event basically fol
lows the format of previous ones,
but Solis noted that graduate stu
dents have "really come out to
support" it.

Entertainment will vaiy, with
music from Oakland's Tloatani,
or "Messenger of the Wind,"
which will present Latin-Ameri
can and Mexican rhythms, to
improvisational skits by Teatro
Xicano, a Stanford theatrical
group.
" Teatro's spontaneity gets the
crowd going," said a student who
saw their performance last year.
In addition, the celebration
will feature poetry readings, Bal
let Folklorico, and special speak
ers such as Mistress of Cere
monies Monica Espinoza, a visit
ing professor through the Chi
cano Fellows Program. The cus
tomary refreshments of "Pan de
Muerte," or bread for the dead,

and Mexican-style hot chocolate
will be served free.
MEChA and El Centre mem
bers emphasized that a special
aspect of the entire celebration is
the participation of various multi
cultural associations. For exam
ple, on Wednesday, Cross Cul
tures and MEChA united to host a
mask-making session for today's
festivities. Many of these groups
also donate money to fund events
such as Dia de los Muertos.
"We usually ask different orga
nizations in our community to
contribute to our event, and they
willingly respond," Monz6n said,
adding that many of these donors
dedicate funds consistently every
year.
