# Day of Dead more than tricks, treats
## 
### Jose J. Gutierrez 
1 he Stanford community can taste a bite of Mex
icano/Chicano cultura tonight, as El Centro Chi
cano, along with MEChA, presents its annual cele
bration of Dia de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead.
Although this tradition is a distant cousin of Hal
loween, it is much more than just tricks or treats.
Los Dias de los Muertos, usually observed on the
first two days in November, begins with El Dia de los
Angelitos, in commemoration of dead children. On
the second day, the "older people" arrive from
Mictlan, the Aztec place of the dead.
As they arrive after a tiring journey, they find an
altar covered with offerings such as food, family
memorabilia and liquor. El Centro, Casa Zapata and
the Law School each have arranged altars for public
viewing.
Tonight at 7 p.m. in El Centro, traditional danc
ing, poetry readings and Latin American rhythms
will bring the holiday to life.
Lisa Monz6n, the student financial coordinator
for El Centro, explained that there are two reasons
for this annual event: first, it allows those in the
Mexicano/Chicano culture who understand this tra
dition to participate, and secondly, it helps to expose
both those in the culture and others who aren't to
become familiar with it.
The event helps "to show how we in the Mexi
cano/Chicano community at Stanford express our
selves," Monz6n said. The celebration is open to the
entire Stanford community, and usually draws
about 150 students to the El Centro lounge to wit
ness it.
