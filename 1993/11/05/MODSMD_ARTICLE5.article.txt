# USW taken over by parent union
## Internal disputes contribute to breakdown in local leadership 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
Control of the labor union that
represents Stanford employees
was taken away by the union's par
ent organization yesterday, after
an investigation revealed that in
ternal political disputes were hin
dering attentiveness to worker
complaints.
Representatives from the Service
Employees International Union
(SEIU) arrived on campus yesterday
morning and dissolved the govern
ing body of United Stanford Work
ers, a local affiliate of SEIU.
The USW will operate under the
trusteeship of the parent organiza
tion for the next six months, with
its executive operations handled by
two SEIU officials.
Bill Pritchett, the SEIU west re
gional director, said that USW suf
fered a "political breakdown be
tween two sides fighting over who
should direct day-to-day affairs."
"It decreased the union's ability

to govern its members, which was
unacceptable to them, and the labor
movement as a whole," he said.
Pritchett said that over roughly
the last six months, SEIU "re
ceived a lot of requests from vari
ous representatives within [USWJ
and members of the executive
board asking us for help."
He said that divisions in the 12-
person executive committee —
which is comprised of approxi
mately five elected union members
and seven volunteer members —
stemmed from disputes over super
vision of union activities.
"There were disagreements as
basic as who should be in charge,"
he said. "One faction believed the
union should be run by majority,
and another said the elected offi
cers should have control. There
were charges and counter-charges
being filed back and forth, but
there was no final resolution that
this person should be the leader, or
his group." Pritchett described the
clashes as "a little bit personal, but
mostly political and ideological."
The bickering "diminished the
ability of the union to represent
workers effectively, and to govern
itself and its day-to-day opera
tions," he said. Those kinds of fail
ings included unreturned phone
calls, sluggish response to labor
misgivings, and general staff dis
organization.
Pritchett contended that union
leaders were generally supportive
of the shakeup. But Fred Harris,
president of the union, called the
decision to place the USW under
trusteeship "sudden."
"I don't know anything about

it,"he said. "There was no warn
ing or anything."
Calls placed to union represen
tatives yesterday were deferred to
Pritchett.
Reuben Serna, a former USW
field representative who left Stan
ford in June, said he "knew the
[SEIUI was poking around," but
that up until the time he resigned
from his post, no structural prob
lems were distinguishable.
A letter to the USW from SEIU
president John Sweeney stated
that a hearing between SEIU rep
resentatives and union members
Sept. 23 revealed that "there had
been a breakdown of democratic
structures within the Local, and
that there now exists two separate
and parallel governance structures,
each of which refuses to abide by
the decisions of the others."
Pritchett said SEIU control

over the union will last for six
months, or until "inconsistencies
in operating practices and policies
are reconciled." After that time,
the union members will reclaim
control, he said.
"We're going to assess every
aspect of the union, to make it as
sophisticated and professional as
possible," he said.
For the duration of the trustee
ship, "workers will feel, in terms
of their lives, not much of a change
at all," Pritchett said. He down
played the suggestion that labor
complaints will be subordinate to
SEIU's bureaucratic shuffling,
arguing that workers will be
involved in the effort to reshape
the union.
"We will absolutely improve all
members' ability to get rapid
access to resources, leverage and
technical expertise," he said.
