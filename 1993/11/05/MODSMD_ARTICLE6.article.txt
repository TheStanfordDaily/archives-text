# University studying grad housing needs
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Graduate housing, a perennial
concern for graduate students, has
traditionally been overshadowed by
the need for undergraduate hous
ing.
But now that the University has
succeeded in guaranteeing housing
to all undergraduates, it has fo
cused its attention on graduate is
sues by commissioning a study to
research the housing needs of grad
uate students.
An outside research company
has nearly finished compiling and
analyzing a wide range of data on
housing-related concerns raised
through recently completed inter
views with a random sampling of
graduate students.
"We decided to find out what
kinds of issues surround graduate
housing," said Mary Edmonds, vice
provost for student affairs and one
of the administrators who has
worked on the report since May.

"At the point we guaranteed the
housing to undergraduates, the
[unmarried] graduate students
made their concerns known," she
said. "We decided to find out how
much demand for grad housing was
out there."
The results of the report will be
used to improve the condition of
graduate housing, Edmonds said.
"We will use it to decide what types
of housing projects to work on in
the future."
The report itself will focus on a
variety of graduate housing issues,
ranging from the facilities students
prefer to views on current housing
policy.
"We weren't just looking at
housing spaces, though that was
the main focus," said Chris Griffith,
the director of graduate residences.
According to Sanford Dickert, an
engineering graduate student, the
graduate housing demand is signif
icantly large.
"Many grad students feel that
the University does not put a large
emphasis on graduate student con
cerns. ... the University is geared
toward undergraduates," he said.
"There is not enough housing, the
facilities need renovation."
In conducting the study, graduate
students both on and off campus
were interviewed by telephone.
According to Griffith, the survey

included 100 unmarried master's
students, 200 unmarried doctoral
students, 100 couples and 100 fami
lies.
"We worked with the Housing
Center to get random samples of
students," said Griffith, another
member of the committee that
worked on the report.
Though the research for the
report has already been completed,
details will not be released until
meetings have been held with grad
uate-student housing committees.
"We have already found out
quite a bit of information, but I am

hesitant to go into details before we
have full information," Griffith
said.
Also, the group wants to get
"direct student input" on the pro
cess, Edmonds said. Meetings with
graduate student groups will be
held in the upcoming weeks.
According to Griffith, the last
survey of this type was conducted in
the mid 1980s, prior to the con
struction of Rains.
"We feel that it's time to re-eval
uate current housing policy," she
said. "It's important to consistently
ask what students want."
