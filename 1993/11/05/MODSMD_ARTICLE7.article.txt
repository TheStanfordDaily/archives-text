# Sophomores prance around Toy on in pajamas
## Students try to revive 50-year-old tradition 
### Cametra Thompson Staff writer 
While freshmen, juniors and seniors spent last
night reading or doing problem sets, a few of the oft
forgotten members of the student body — sopho
mores — hopped into their pajamas and took last
night off for pillow fights, paper fights, and the clas
sic movie "Ferris Bueller's Day Off."
But a smaller-than-hoped-for number — less
than 30 — of these eager and energetic sophomores
were in attendance at the first Sophomore
marino in 50 years, which was held in Toyon yester
day. Sponsored by the Stanford Alumni Network
(STAN), the event attempted to revive a Stanford
tradition and give sophomores a rare chance to cele
brate just being sophomores.
Sophomore Rainbow Chen, who coordinated the
program, said she organized the event because she
wanted to counter the general perception that no ef
forts were being made to promote class unity. De
spite STAN's efforts, though, the sophomores didn't
seem willing to participate, she said.
Chen got the idea for the Pqjamarino after talk
ing with an alumnus from the Class of *43. During
his sophomore year, he and his class had a sock hop
at Burnham Pavilion. They wore pajamas, of
course, and then met at the Oval to make the trek to

the Stanford Theater.
"He couldn't remember whether
it was a one- or a two-day event — it
was so long ago," Chen said.
But the faithful alum could
remember that his Pqjamarino
was a tremendous success
STAN project director Jason
Kwan, a junior, said the group
wanted to start a program for
sophomores, since there are

already several events — such as
Full Moon on the Quad and Senior
Casino Night — which are
planned for freshmen and seniors.
Previous attempts to start
events for sophomores and juniors
have been unsuccessful, Kwan
said, adding that the Ptyamarino
"is one of the few traditions sopho
mores can call their own."
Unable to secure the Stanford
Theater, STAN held the event in
Toyon and treated sophomores to
popcorn, a movie and an opportu
nity to bond with their classmates.

STAN members promoted the
event all week with popcorn in
White Plaza, and went to house
meetings to encourage sopho
mores to attend.
Kwan said that although the
Pajamarino is starting small, he
hopes it will expand in the coming
years and once again become a
sophomore tradition.
"I think it's a great idea," said
sophomore Rob Gittin. "I wish
someone had done it for freshmen
and I hope someone will do it next
year for juniors."
