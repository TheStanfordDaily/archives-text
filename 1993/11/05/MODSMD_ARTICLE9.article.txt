# Students unite for Webb workers
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
It took an hour and a half, and
all they formally decided on was a
name.
Nevertheless, members of a
student group now calling itself
the Coalition for Dignity and Jus
tice at Webb Ranch said the meet
ing they held last night in El Cen
tre Chicano was successful.
The group of about 30 stu
dents came out of the meeting
applauding agreement on general
goals and organization, although
organizers Gloria S&nchez and
Nicole Sanchez were unwilling to
state definitively the organiza
tions' purpose.
The group's current goals
include education and "a height
ened awareness for everyone in

the Stanford community" of the
working conditions of Webb
Ranch workers, said Nicole
Sanchez, a senior.
"We're not here for publicity,"
said senior Gloria Sanchez.
"We're here for the livelihood of
hard-working people . . . the invis
ible people of the University."
As part of this education effort,
meeting organizers distributed a
timeline describing the history of
the dispute between Webb Ranch
workers and the Webb family,
who lease the land from the Uni
versity.
"We're still informing our
selves," said Gloria Sanchez.
"The contract has been in exis
tence since 1922. It takes time to
look at the whole issue."
Another purpose of the meet
ing was an attempt to present the

group as a unified front. A letter
introducing the timeline called
past efforts made on behalf of
workers at the ranch "weak and
fragmented."
"Hasty demands and rash
agreements are not going to
make a lasting impression on the
University or the Webb family,"
the letter states. "If this were to
become a thoughtful and educat
ed community movement, how
ever, the chance of attaining
tangible, long-term results for
the workers is infinitely
greater."
Last night's meeting was pri
marily a response to University
President Gerhard Casper's
statement at a recent Faculty
Senate meeting that the Universi
ty would distance itself from labor
disputes at the ranch.
