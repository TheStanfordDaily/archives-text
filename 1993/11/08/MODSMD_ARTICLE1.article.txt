Stanford's system of distribu
tion requirements needs to be re
viewed, the Commission on Un
dergraduate Education decided
Friday.
Although no formal plans for
changing the requirement system
will be made until a sub-commit
tee is formed this winter, there is
"a general consensus that the re
quirements are not working as
well as we want them to," said
History Prof. James Sheehan,
chair of the commission.
For the most part, the 19 com
mission members — which in
clude faculty, staff, alumni and
two students — feel that the re
quirements do not expand the un
dergraduate educational experi
ence as well as they should.
"Distribution requirements
are supposed to broaden your ex
perience, but they don't create
breadth or depth. That means
they're broken," said Political
Science Prof. David Brady.
In particular, there is a general
feeling among commission mem
bers that the requirements do not
pose enough of a challenge to stu
dents, who often take the easiest
classes in each distribution area
just to get the requirement out of
the way.
"If you are taking a class for
your major for a grade, and a dis
tribution requirement class
pass/no credit, guess which one
gets the quality time at midnight
on Sunday," said graduate stu
dent David Lowell.
Lowell said commission mem
bers had also pointed out that
many classes that fall under the
distribution areas are not
designed to give breadth in the
subject, but are focused introduc
tory courses for a particular
major which aim to prepare stu
dents for further study in that
subject.
"CIV was created to cover a
wide breadth of things, but other
classes have different goals," said
Lowell.
Because CIV is a good model of
what a distribution requirement
should be, the commission plans
to treat that course separately
when it creates sub-committees
this winter.
"There is a sense that the way
CIV is organized, as a three
course sequence designed -specifi
cally for that requirement, would
benefit the discussion of the other
distribution requirements," said
Linguistics Prof. John Rickford.
Although the whole commis
sion seemed to agree that the sys
tem of requirements needs to be
changed, Sheehan said that there
was "a difference of opinion" as to
how radical the revision should
actually be.
"Everyone agrees that some
degree of breadth is a good thing,

but how much is the question,"
he said.
Solutions ranged from simply
giving more explanation of the
requirements to completely
revamping the system and "more
drastic solutions," said Sheehan.
For example, Rickford said
other schools that offer a wider
choice of classes in each required
area were brought up as models
of a possible change.
However, Sheehan added, "At
this stage, we're just getting dif
ferent opinions and a sense of
what the possibilities are. . . .
The commission is beginning to
form some common basis, but
we're a long way from any deci
sions."
The commission, which was
formed last year by University
President Gerhard Casper to
examine undergraduate educa
tion as a whole, has met three
times this year. Sheehan said he
was particularly happy with last
week's meeting.
"I was very pleased with the
discussion — everybody partici
pated," he said.
This sentiment was echoed by
other commission members.
"The discussion was the best
we've had yet. People had obvi
ously thought a lot about this,
and it was impressive to listen to
their views. They were clearly
committed to fixing what was
broken," said Lowell.
