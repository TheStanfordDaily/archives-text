# Clinton blames labor groups for opposition facing NAFTA
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Using
harsh language against an old
ally, President Clinton said orga
nized labor is strong-arming law
makers with "roughshod, mus
clebound tactics" to scuttle the
North American Free Trade
Agreement.
In a rare and sweeping Sunday
morning television interview,
Clinton also insisted that North
Korea cannot be allowed to devel
op a nuclear bomb.
"We have to be firm about it,"
he said, but refused to discuss the
possibility of a pre-emptive strike
against the communist nation's
nuclear facilities.
Clinton, appearing for an hour
on NBC's "Meet the Press," reit
erated his support for Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and
exiled Haitian President Jean-
Bertrand Aristide. And he said
U.S. troops in Somalia would
renew efforts to clear supply lines
for humanitarian operations.
Aides said his attack on labor
was not scripted, but the remarks

were astonishing for a Democrat
ic president, even on a free-trade
issue that has spawned an odd
menagerie of political coalitions.
"At least for the undecided
Democrats, our big problem is
the raw muscle, the sort of naked
pressure that the labor forces
have put on," Clinton said.
He said unions are privately
threatening to cut financial sup
port and field opponents if law
makers support the free-trade
deal with Mexico and Canada.
"The president knows better
than that," AFL-CIO spokesman
Rex Hardesty said in a telephone
interview after the show. "He
knows what our record is with
seeking working-rights protec
tion in trade agreements."
During a commercial break in
the show, senior White House
adviser David Gergen slipped
Clinton a piece of paper telling
him that wire service stories were
trumpeting his criticism of labor.
Clinton called the situation an
example of how a president's

words can be twisted.
"Those guys are my friends,"
he said of the unions. "I just
don't agree with them on
NAFTA."
Hardesty said the president
"was right later in the show when
he said this was virtually the only
issue in which he disagrees with
the AFL-CIO."
The free-trade deal, which
comes to a vote Nov. 17, is about
30 votes short of the majority
needed to pass it in the House,
Clinton said. "I think we'll make
it, however," he said.
Opponents, most visibly for
mer presidential candidate Ross
Perot, believe the pact would cost
thousands of jobs. Clinton said
Vice President A 1 Gore will fare
well in his Tuesday night debate
with Perot, although the Texas
billionaire "is the master of the
one-liner and the emotional
retort."
Clinton said Perot has "kept
things stirred up. I think that's
what he likes to do."
