# Jordan holds first multiparty elections

### 
AMMAN, Jordan (AP) — Candi
dates made last-minute appeals yester
day for votes in Jordan's first multi
party elections since 1956, in which
proponents of peace with Israel are
expected to retain a majority in parlia
ment.
Today's elections come after Israeli
officials confirmed over the weekend
that Jordan and Israel are close to
reaching a peace agreement. King Hus
sein has not yet made any public com
ment.
While Muslim fundamentalists are
expected to win the single largest bloc
in the 80-seat lower house of parlia
ment, conservative and tribal members
who support Hussein's pro-peace poli
cy are expected to keep a majority of
seats.

The bicameral legislature must rati
fy any peace agreement, although Hus
sein retains ultimate authority with
the power to dissolve parliament and
rule by decree. The 40-seat upper
house is appointed by Hussein and nor
mally backs him.
Jordan and Israel signed an agenda
for peace talks on Sept. 14, a day after
Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization reached a peace accord
that provides for Palestinian self-rule
in the occupied territories.
But while peace has played a role in
campaigns, Jordanians appear more
concerned with poverty and unemploy
ment. The country is straining under a
$6.5 billion foreign debt and $4 billion
in losses stemming from 1990-91 Gulf
crisis, when trade with Iraq, Jordan's

biggest trading partner, was blocked.
For the most part, the campaign
ended peacefully. Police briefly
detained a Muslim fundamentalist can
didate after he and supporters roughed
up two members of a moderate Islamic
party, the state-run Petra news agency
said.
The fundamentalist Muslim Broth
erhood and leftist groups oppose the
U.S.-backed peace process. The Broth
erhood advocates Israel's destruction
while the leftists say the process has
failed to provide for a Palestinian state.
Both groups appear to have failed to
turn their opposition into an election
winner, even though half the popula
tion is of Palestinian descent. Analysts
said the lineup in the parliament was
unlikely to change much.
