Breakthrough in Alzheimer's
WASHINGTON (AP) — Discovery of a
key role played by a gene in Alzheimer's
disease may lead quickly to a diagnostic
test and possible eventual development of
drugs to prevent the memory-destroying
disorder, scientists said yesterday.
New studies presented at a symposium
sponsored by the government's National
Institute on Aging suggested that one
form of a gene called apolipoprotein-E, or
apoE, may protect some people from devel
oping Alzheimer's disease, while a flawed
form of the same gene substantially
increases the risk.
The research, by a Duke University team
led by Dr. Allen Roses, showed that a rare

form of the gene, called apoE2, appears to
protect people from developing Alzheimer's
disease. But people with another form of
the gene, apoE4, were at substantially
greater risk of developing the disease.
"There is almost universal agreement
now about the importance of apoE in
Alzheimer's," said Dr. Robert Katzman of
the University of California, San Diego. He
said the discovery, for the first time, offers
the possibility of developing a drug that
would copy the natural protective action
against Alzheimer's.
A statement from the National Institute
of Aging called the apoE gene discovery "a
breakthrough in Alzheimer's research, a
disease that has baffled researchers for
over 20 years."
