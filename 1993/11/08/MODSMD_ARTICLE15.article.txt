## Editorial Operational change SCBN should become an independent station to best serve the community 
### 
After years of fits and
starts, it is time for Stanford
to have an active student
run television station.
Presently, the Stanford Cardinal
Broadcasting Network's program
ming is relegated to community
bulletin boards and an occasional
event that gets lost in the shuffle.
This situation helps neither the
network nor its potential audience.
There needs to be a fundamental
change in the operation of SCBN: it
should become independent from
the University. Independence
would foster a more vibrant stu
dent-run network, one which
would give students a valuable
training ground in broadcast jour
nalism and business while better
informing and entertaining their
audience.
As it stands, SCBN hasn't
received a fee request in two years
and only received $816 from the
ASSU for the upcoming quarter.
Students won't vote for a special
fee because they can't foresee the
potential benefits reaped by having
a student-run TV station.
Shows like last year's "The
Study Break" were good starts at
offering a full programming slate,
but to garner real student support
and viewership the station needs to
take on more substantial projects
as well as consistent news and
sports coverage. Away sporting
events — especially popular, but
rarely televised, sports like volley
ball and water polo — are ideal pro
gramming material for a student
run station.
Yet, covering major events like
championships and celebrity visits
should not be the sole purpose of
SCBN. Stanford-centered daily or
even weekly news should also be
included.
However, planning such projects

is almost impossible without the
necessary permanence and money.
Both problems would likely be
solved by independence. SCBN
would have a much better founda
tion if it were no longer dependent
on the whims of apathetic voters
and disgruntled fee refunders, but
on a hard-working core of intelli
gent Stanford students attempting
to create a successful commercial
venture.
The money necessary to launch
SCBN as a viable venture could be
generated from a variety of
sources. A sensible place to start is
with sponsorships from Stanford
alumni or local businesses interest
ed in boosting broadcast media on
campus, or from the community at
large. These sponsors might also
donate equipment to bring SCBN's
hardware up to par.
From there, the station should
work out a deal with the University
to let them use advertising as a
source of income. As long as SCBN
remains a non-profit organization
and pays the required taxes on
advertising, this would provide a
good interim, legal funding source.
The next step for achieving con
sistency and cash flow would be
incorporation and official separa
tion from the University. This
would make the station a legiti
mate business. Incorporation
requires only a lawyer's advice, a
book detailing how to become a cor
poration in the state of California
and a relatively small fee. Couple
this idea with a deal to lease their
present facilities from the Univer
sity and an independent TV station
is almost formed.
This type of reorganization
would certainly improve and
increase the programming avail
able to the Stanford community
and train those students interested
in broadcast journalism, as well as
providing experience to those who
sell the advertising and run the sta
tion's business.
The alternative to this plan is
the status quo: a station which sits
in the University's shadow and
only shines when an occasional fee
request is passed.
