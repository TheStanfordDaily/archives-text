## A 						writer's joyful mission 
### 
A COUPLE OF weeks ago an editori
al writer for the San Jose Mercury
News came to The Daily and spoke
with this volume's columnists, giving us
pointers, suggestions, and basically
destroying any shred of arrogance we
picked up from getting a column. Slowly,
she picked her way through the columns
and, finally, came to mine.
"You know, I hate humor columns."
Sometimes I wonder why I'm even
writing a column. But then I remember
the great benefits I'm getting from The
Daily (a free subscription) and it all
comes back to me.
Then, she went on: "I like your style,
though, but, uh, what's the point?"
At that time, I was still scraping
myself off the cold cement, trying desper
ately to piece together my existence from
the hazy memory that was just barely
surviving the first comment. Well, now
the gloves are off, the gauntlet has been
thrown down; I'm going to prove my col
umn has a point and a mission:
To spread peace and joy and happiness
and love to all.
Let me explain. Here at Stanford, both
the students and faculty are working and
worrying constantly, preparing for exams
or preparing them, writing essays to be
graded or to be published. The last thing
they want is to open the paper to read
someone complain about the University
or human nature or the ecological state of

affairs in Nepal (they get enough of that
at house meetings). For that reason,
every week, I bring to you the silliest
thing I can imagine that will last 3600-
3800 characters. And also for that rea
son, in the spirit of Tish Williams, I
throw in the occasional one-liner.
That is not to say you can't lick my
grapefruit.
But it's not that simple. If I could, I
would just go off on any topic, making
obscure references to lampshades and
blowfish. But I can't. My duty goes
beyond just giving an essential diversion,
but includes securing this University for
future stressers.
Stanford relies on the generosity of
alumni everywhere, needing them to
fund activities and scholarships. Without
their support, Stanford would be noth
ing, a wasteland. I, for one, cannot allow
that to happen. I need to show the alum
ni that their money is going toward some
thing intellectual, worthy. If The Daily
weren't sent to alumni all over the world,
one Monday you might read a column
that starts off:
"STANFORD, Calif. - Crowds gath
ered outside Memorial Church last night
in a candlelight vigil remembering the
cattle lost in last week's accident. The
fourteen bovines, killed when an exces
sive build-up of methane touched off a
chain reaction of explosions, were eulo
gized by Michael Jackson, who cancelled

his Singapore concert specifically to
mourn the loss. University President
Gerhard Casper was unavailable for com
ment, but aides close to him saw him
break into tears upon hearing the news."
As you can see, my hands are tied. Use
less articles like that can't be run.
Instead, I write columns with a scholarly
bent, making more intellectual references
to four-dimensional bottles, diophantine
equations and Okazaki fragments. That
way, the alumni see what they want and
support the future of this nation, nay, of
this world. And instead of writing about
exploding cows, I write about relevant
questions: Why did the dinosaurs die? Is
time travel possible? Is there an evolu
tionary explanation for mimes?
I contemplate every word, every letter.
I make sure each sentence carries all I'm
trying to convey, while still amusing stu
dents and faculty, pleasing alumni, and
moving the world closer to Utopia. The
responsibility is enormous, the pressure,
unbearable. I don't just sit down once a
week and spew off several hundred words
of gibberish in half an hour.
I just looks like I do.

Thai will slight and ignore the alumni
for a week and write about exploding
cows if enough requests are made.
