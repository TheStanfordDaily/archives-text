## Lecturer stresses need for strong English requirement 
### 
I APPLAUD The Daily's concern
about the writing requirement and
especially about improving student
writing, but I find the solution proposed
in the Oct. 28 editorial extremely puz
zling. Combining Freshman English and
Cultures, Ideas and Values, as The Daily
suggests, would only further dilute the
quality of writing instruction at Stan
ford.
Contrary to The Daily's implication,
not all courses in Writing and Critical
Thinking (WCT — the new name for
Freshman English) are taught by gradu
ate students. Moreover, many of those
graduate students are excellent, experi
enced teachers with impressive resumes
of their own published work.
About 35 percent of writing sections
are currently taught by lecturers. Due to
budget pressures and a lack of institu
tional commitment, this proportion is
down from over 50 percent just two
years ago. That's not a good trend for
undergraduates at Stanford, and I want
to make it clear why.
The lecturers in WCT are profession
al writing teachers, experts in the field
of composition studies. In fact, they are
the only composition experts at Stan
ford.

Nationwide, composition studies is a
large, thriving, complex discipline that
incorporates literary and discourse theo
ry, rhetoric, cognitive and learning theo
ry, the writing-across-the-disciplines
movement, research in computer and
network-based instruction and other
areas. Composition studies is far ahead
of most academic disciplines in its atten
tion to teaching practices.
Stanford has no tenure-line faculty in
composition studies. English Depart
ment faculty members — a few of whom
teach in WCT — are literary scholars,
not rhetoricians. It follows that the
department's graduate students are lit
erary scholars in training. The depart
ment does, however, invest substantial
time and resources to train them in the
teaching of writing.
Most of this training has been done
by the core professional teachers in
WCT, the lecturers. The lecturers all
have advanced degrees and typically
have 10 to 20 years' teaching experi
ence. They have published research and
several widely-used textbooks in the
field of composition, along with innova
tive computer software. The nationally
recognized Community Service Writing
Project, the Computers and Writing

Project, the Writing Across the Cur
riculum Program and the nationally
distributed newsletter "Notes in the
Margin" all were developed by lectur
ers.
If Stanford students want the best
instruction, they shouldn't ask a writing
teacher to teach calculus, chemistry, or
philosophy. Likewise, they shouldn't ask
professors in other disciplines — such as
those teaching CIV — to teach writing.
Rather than arguing to take more
writing instruction out of the hands of
the people best trained to do it, The
Daily ought to be asking (as it did in
1992) why some sections of WCT —
despite strenuous objections by writing
faculty — are being taught this year by
graduate students in the History
Department!
Do we really want to improve the
quality of writing instruction at Stan
ford? Then we should ask the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education to
consider:
• Requiring two quarters of writing
instruction for every student, regardless
of AP status.
• Increasing the units for WCT cours
es from three (for English 1-2) to five
per quarter, to reflect the reality of the

workload as well as the importance the
University supposedly places on this
"basic skill."
• Creating tenure-line positions in
composition studies, like those at many
other universities. If the subject is going
to be taught here, then shouldn't we
have those world-class researchers that
we have in other fields?
• Requiring that a minimum propor
tion of writing sections be taught by
experienced lecturers, and limiting the
proportion of sections that can be taught
by inexperienced teachers.
• Mandating that sections be limited
to 15, as they once were, so students can
receive the maximum individual atten
tion to their writing. Under recent bud
get pressures, section sizes have crept up
to 20 and more.
• Supporting the writing program
with real money and giving the profes
sional teachers in the program real jobs.
Lecturers are now offered only part-time
jobs with just one-year term appoint
ments, clearly demonstrating the Uni
versity's lack of commitment to those
"basic competencies" the commission
has been charged to evaluate.
