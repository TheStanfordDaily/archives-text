## Stanford succumbs to Trojan attack, 45-20 USC scoring blitz simultaneously dashes the Cardinal's victory, bowl hopes 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES - USC
scored touchdowns in its first
three possessions of the third
quarter while holding Stanford to
a mere field goal in the entire sec
ond half to record a 45-20 slaugh
ter of the Cardinal before 59,376
at the Coliseum on Saturday.
The loss dropped the Cardi
nal's record to 3-6 overall, with a
1-5 mark in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, and dashed the squad's
hopes for a third-consecutive
postseason appearance.
"We had aspirations for a bowl
game and now that's out of the
question," said quarterback

Steve Stenstrom. "Things just
didn't click, and it just wasn't our
day."
Though Stanford trailed by
only 24-17 at halftime, the Tro
jans, with fullback Deon Strother
leading the way, effectively
clinched the game after the inter
mission. On USC's first drive of
the second half, Strother caught
passes of 14 and 35 yards before
completing the procession with a
one-yard end zone dive.
Following a missed field goal
by Stanford kicker Eric Abrams,
Strother went back to work,
hooking up with quarterback Rob
Johnson on a 19-yard pass play.
After a Johnson completion to
wide receiver Johnnie Morton,

Strother raced 38 yards for his
second touchdown of the after
noon.
Then, before Stanford could
catch its breath, USC struck
again, this time on a 39-yard
touchdown pass from Johnson to
receiver Ken Grace. The Trojans
accumulated 194 yards in total
offense on those three drives
alone. From that point on, the
Cardinal needed a miracle that
not even Stenstrom could pro
vide.
"By the middle of the third
quarter we felt it was critical that
we score every possession — and
then we didn't do it," Stenstrom
said.
USC (6-4, 5-1) knew Stan

ford's weaknesses and exploited
them, amassing 497 yards in total
offense. Johnson, who completed
22 of 35 passes for 349 yards and
one touchdown, continually test
ed the Cardinal secondary by
throwing deep.
Receivers Morton (four recep
tions for 127 yards) and Grace
(four for 71) were more than
happy to oblige. With his num
bers, Morton — who has 1,233
yards receiving this year — set a
new Pac-10 single season record
for receiving yards.
"We were outgunned," said
Stanford head coach Bill Walsh.
"The lack of speed and size in our
secondary hurt us. Our pass rush
was not very good, and we didn't
get off the ball very well."
Throughout the season, the
Cardinal defense has had difficul
ty maintaining consistency. All
the Trojans needed were the
breakdowns at the start of the
third period to put Stanford
away.
"We didn't really run to the
ball that well," said Stanford
safety Kevin Garnett. "They got
some big plays on us, and then it
was hard to get our rhythm
back."
"In the second half, they
(USC) came out ready to play and
we didn't," said end Tyrone Park
er. "We knew what they were
going to do, we just weren't able
to stop it. We missed tackles and
made bad plays."
Meanwhile, the Stanford
offense struggled. Stenstrom (29
of 49 for 263 yards and one touch
down) received constant pressure
from the Trojan defensive front.
The Cardinal converted just
seven of 18 third-down conver
sions.
"He's tired, we made him work
tonight," said USC head coach
John Robinson. The defense led
us. We contained that team."
Indications that the Cardinal
was in for a long afternoon came
on Stanford's first series. With
fourth-and-one on their own 48,
Stanford elected to try for the

first down. But fullback Ellery
Roberts was stuffed by the Tro
jans' Brian Williams.
USC took over, scoring six
plays later on a two-yard run by
tailback Shawn Walters, then
added another touchdown
moments later when Johnson
connected with Morton for 30
yards over the middle. USC led
14-0 only six minutes into the
contest.
The teams then traded field
goals before each defensive unit
alternately forced a punt and a
turnover. The last beneficiary in
the possession exchange was
Stanford, which regained control
of the ball on an interception of a
Johnson pass by Tommy Knecht
at the Cardinal 37. Stenstrom
then marched the Cardinal 63
yards in 10 plays, culminating in
an 11-yard touchdown pass to
receiver David Shaw in the back
of the endzone to bring Stanford
within seven.
But the Cardinal defense then
suffered a lapse, resulting in an
occurrence that has become all
too-familiar this season — the big
play. After the Trojans took over
on their own 15 following Aaron
Mills' kickoff, Johnson found
receiver Edward Hervey for a 14-
yard gain. Then, he connected for
20 yards to Morton, who, after a
missed tackle by Garnett, scam
pered 71 yards down the left side
lines for a touchdown. In 37 sec
onds, Stanford's deficit was dou
bled.
"They (Stanford) tried to mix
it up a ton (on defense)," Johnson
said. "They started off with zone
and we picked it apart. Then they
went with man and we got the 71-
yard reception. They had trouble
stopping us all day."
Stanford, though, came right
back on its next series with a 69-
yard touchdown drive capped
with a two-yard run by freshman
Mike Mitchell. Freshman Leroy
Pruitt ignited the drive with a 26-
yard reverse around left end to

move the ball into Trojan terri

"In the second quarter, once
they attacked us we got off bal
ance," Robinson said. "In the
third quarter we made some
adjustments that worked right
away."
The adjustments USC made
kept the Trojans alive in the
Rose Bowl hunt, and the Cardi
nal is now faced with trying to

"We knew we had to have got
ten veiy lucky to come close, and
we weren't lucky, so this is what
happens," Walsh said. "We're
doing the best we can. I'd just like
to win another game or two,
somehow."
