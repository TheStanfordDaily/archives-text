# Twice as nice
## Polo sweeps foes 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
It wasn't pretty, but the Cardi
nal water polo team found a way
to win.
Top-ranked Stanford (20-3)
fought their way through Los
Angeles last weekend and
escaped with a pair of victories,
12-10 over No. 6 UCLA (12-11)
and 11-10 over No. 2 USC (13-7).
The successful road trip virtu
ally assures that the Cardinal will
be the No. 1 seed at both the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion Tournament this weekend
and the NCAA Championships in
three weeks. Both tournaments
will be held in Long Beach, Calif.
The Los Angeles road trip,
always a tough one for Cardinal
teams, featured two extremely
similar games.
"In both games, we had to
score a two-pointer with very lit
tle time remaining to win," said
coach Dante Dettamanti. "In
both, we were behind or tied most
of the way. Very rarely did we
have a lead."
The Cardinal managed to have
the lead when it counted, howev
er, which made Dettamanti opti
mistic about his team's remain
ing schedule.
"What's starting to come out
about our team is we do whatever
it takes to win a game," Detta
manti said. "We're finding a way
to win. That's a sign of a champi
onship team. You have to win the
close ones."
Three of the team's recent vic
tories have come with only sec
onds remaining, including a
defeat of the Trojans in the final
16 seconds of play one week ago.
"We've played a really tough
schedule," Dettamanti contin
ued. "We're not dominating, by
any means. [The rest of the sea
son is] still going to be tough. But
we should have the advantage of
going into the NCAA Champi
onships No. 1, and that helps."
On Friday at UCLA, Stan
ford's advantage was the stellar
play of freshman Brian Wallin,
who tossed in four goals, includ
ing a two-pointer with 1:22
remaining in the match to put the
Cardinal up for good.

UCLA had also struck from
long range, scoring a pair of two
pointers early en route to a 7-5
halflime advantage.
A penalty shot by senior Anto
nio Busquets brought the Cardi
nal into a 7-7 tie early in the third
quarter, but the Bruins respond
ed with two goals of their own.
Stanford refused to roll over,
however, as the Cardinal slowly
pecked away at the UCLA lead.
The Stanford rally culminated
with 40 seconds left in the third
quarter, as junior Brian Clemens
gave the Cardinal its first lead of
the game, 10-9.
After the Bruins tied the score
at 10, just one minute into the
final frame, the two teams played
evenly until Wallin found the net
for the winning goal.
"That was Brian's best game
so far," Dettamanti said. "He
matched the output of UCLA's
super-freshman Jim Toring. He
really proved himself to be one of
the top freshmen in the country."
Busquets chipped in three
goals and Clemens two. Goal
tender Larry Bercutt turned
away 15 Bruin shots on goal.
But the excitement was just
beginning, as Stanford traveled
across town for a Saturday show
down with its closest rival in the
rankings, No. 2 USC.
Earlier, while the Cardinal
battled UCLA, the Trojans scout
ed from the stands, waiting for a
shot at No. 1.
However, in the early going
against USC, Stanford looked to
be in good shape, jumping out to
a 3-2 lead at the end of one quar
ter. But the Trojans scored the
next three goals to take a 5-3
advantage, forcing the Cardinal
to play from behind.
Once again, it was Stanford's
long-range accuracy that led to a
wild win, as Cardinal two-point
ers erased three Trojan leads.
Leading the long-range attack
was Busquets, whose two-pointer
tied the match at 5-5 just before
halftime.
"With the two-point shot,
most teams are playing man-to
man," Dettamanti said. "USC
played a zone defense. I guess
they felt their goalie could block our
outside shots."
The break of the game came in the
third quarter with the Cardinal trail
ing 8-6, when Trojan goaltender
Andrew Tinseth was ejected for 20
seconds for interfering with a free
pass. Sophomore Jeremy La-ster's
shot from two-point territory then
sailed over the heads of USC's players.
Stanford then capped its two
point outburst as junior Wolf Wigo
tallied the winning two-pointer
with just under a minute left to
play, turning a 10-9 deficit into the
final score of 11-10.
Wigo led the team in scoring with
four goals. He was joined by Busqets
with three goals, Laster with two and
Josh Leachman and Frank Schneider
with one apiece.
Looking ahead to the conference
tournament, which includes the top
nine teams in the country, the Cardi
nal hopes to be healthy and rested.
To win, they may have to defeat
the Trojans for a third time in three
weeks.
Chances are, they'll find a way.
