# The 						Cardinal: drawn and third-quartered
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
It was the quarter that decided Stanford's
football season. USC's 21-point explosion dur
ing the third period of the Cardinal-Trojan
game assured Stanford of a loss, a losing season
and no postseason play. While the Cardinal has
been performing like a sub-.500 team for the
past two months, that third period was the final
nail driven into the Stanford's football-shaped
coffin.
"[USC] just got tons of momentum and we
weren't able to turn it around in time," said
Stanford quarterback Steve Stenstrom. "USC
came out with the desire to put the game away
in the third quarter and did a great job of doing
that."

The quarter began with Stanford down by
just a touchdown, 17-24, and kicking ofT to the
Trojans. Following a touchback, USC drove 80
yards in eight plays for a touchdown, including
a 35-yard pass completion on third-and-one.
"That possession sets the tone for the whole
half," said defensive tackle Tyrone Parker. "If
we stop them, perhaps they don't score another
time. But they went through us pretty easily
and, hey, they did it the next two possessions.
"If you can't stop them the first time, that
gives them momentum because they think you
can't stop them, and you lose a little bit of your
momentum. The tide just turns. It's like a
chess match."
Stanford looked somewhat promising on
their following drive, marching 59 yards, but
kicker Eric Abrams missed a 31-yard field goal

attempt. But Stanford was not so willing to give
the ball back.
When Abrams' kick sailed wide left, the ball
missed the net and landed in the Stanford visi
tors' section. When the security guards came to
retrieve the football, the fans played keep
away, hiding the ball and chanting, "We've got
the ball."
After 20-30 security guards tried to locate
the ball, "ClifT," an astute Cardinal fan, subtly
guarded the ball between his feet as the
searchers made individuals stand up to be
checked out. The ball was not recovered.
"At the time, [USC] were scoring a lot of
touchdowns, so we felt a little vindicated," Cliff
said.
The ball now resides safely in
Cliff s dorm room.
Following the attempted search -
and-seizure debacle, USC contin
ued their offensive ways. This time
it took the Trojans only four plays
to cover 80 yards for another touch
down on a 38-yard touchdown run
by fullback Dion Strother.
After Stanford failed to get a first
down on their following possession,
USC again took the ball and scored
another touchdown. The Trojan
drive spanned 16 seconds and ended
with a 39-yard pass for the score. It
was followed by a successful two
point conversion.
All totalled, the Trojans amassed
over 200 yards in the quarter. Stan
ford, which at times appeared to move
the ball effectively in the quarter, was
nevertheless frustrated by tipped
passes, quarterback hurries, penalties
and an interception.
"It was kinda tough," said left
guard Jeff Buckey. "We knew we
were still in it coming out in the
third quarter, but things just didn't
really go our way. We got a few bad

breaks here and there and it turned
around quick."
The quarter turned the tide of
the game not only quickly, but deci
sively.
"At halftime, we felt we were in
the combat, that we were in the
game," said Stanford head coach
Bill Walsh. "I feel badly about not
scoring (a touchdown) in the second
half. I feel badly about our penalties
and other mistakes."
The game was typical of Stan
ford's season. Much of the contest
featured a competitive offense by
the Cardinal — even a fairly decent
running game. It was that one
stretch after the half that spelled
doom for Stanford.
Stenstrom's total of 263 passing
yards marked the first game since
the season-opener against Washing
ton in which the senior quarterback
failed to throw for 300 yards. Even
the consistency of the passing game
lagged at times.
"By the end of the third quarter,
I knew we weren't gonna win the
game," said one Stanford fan who
watched the game via satellite. "But
I couldn't even root for Stenstrom
to have another 300-yard game;
they took it off the satellite because
it was such a blowout."
