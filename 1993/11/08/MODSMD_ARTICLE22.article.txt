# The
						Cardinal: drawn and third-quartered
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
It was the quarter that decided Stanford's
football season. USC's 21-point explosion dur
ing the third period of the Cardinal-Trojan
game assured Stanford of a loss, a losing season
and no postseason play. While the Cardinal has
been performing like a sub-.500 team for the
past two months, that third period was the final
nail driven into the Stanford's football-shaped
coffin.
"[USC] just got tons of momentum and we
weren't able to turn it around in time," said
Stanford quarterback Steve Stenstrom. "USC
came out with the desire to put the game away
in the third quarter and did a great job of doing
that."

The quarter began with Stanford down by
just a touchdown, 17-24, and kicking ofT to the
Trojans. Following a touchback, USC drove 80
yards in eight plays for a touchdown, including
a 35-yard pass completion on third-and-one.
"That possession sets the tone for the whole
half," said defensive tackle Tyrone Parker. "If
we stop them, perhaps they don't score another
time. But they went through us pretty easily
and, hey, they did it the next two possessions.
"If you can't stop them the first time, that
gives them momentum because they think you
can't stop them, and you lose a little bit of your
momentum. The tide just turns. It's like a
chess match."
Stanford looked somewhat promising on
their following drive, marching 59 yards, but
kicker Eric Abrams missed a 31-yard field goal

attempt. But Stanford was not so willing to give
the ball back.
When Abrams' kick sailed wide left, the ball
missed the net and landed in the Stanford visi
tors' section. When the security guards came to
retrieve the football, the fans played keep
away, hiding the ball and chanting, "We've got
the ball."
After 20-30 security guards tried to locate
the ball, "ClifT," an astute Cardinal fan, subtly
guarded the ball between his feet as the
searchers made individuals stand up to be
checked out. The ball was not recovered.
"At the time, [USC] were scoring a lot of
touchdowns, so we felt a little vindicated," Cliff
said.
