# Men's soccer beaten by UCLA in tourney

LOS ANGELES - The dew on
the grass at UCLA's Spaulding
Field left all the players soaking
wet after the evening game. For
the Bruins, the water was a
refreshing symbol of their "wash
ing away" of a formidable oppo
nent and continuation in the play
offs.
For Stanford, the wetness only
served to conceal the tears.
In a valiant display of guts and
heart, the Cardinal men's soccer
squad trekked into a realm hereto
fore thought to be out of their
reach and lost a 2-1 heartbreaker
to third-ranked UCLA (17-2) Fri
day night in the first round of the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion playoffs.
"I knew it was going to be a
tight game," said senior forward
Ricky Goad, who had the assist on
Stanford's goal. "It's disappoint
ing. It's kind of hard to put it in
perspective right now."
It was a game that, on paper,
looked like an under-12 youth soc
cer league against a Division I col
legiate squad. But the contest
played out into an exciting
matchup that easily could have
gone the other way.
"We worked our butts off out
there," said sophomore forward
Carmen D'Onofrio. "But it seemed
like it was all in vain."
The game commenced in the
nippy Los Angeles evening, but
things heated up right from the

opening whistle. It was evident
from the beginning that Stanford
was facing a team much better
than any they had played this
year.
The Bruins' offensive pressure
weakened the Cardinal's defense
immediately, and UCLA's aggres
siveness near Stanford's goal put
the Bruins on top first. Sixteen
minutes into the matchup UCLA
defender Eddie Lewis took a
breakaway drive to the left side of
the net and crossed over to the
right, where the ball cleared the
right post by several feet.
"We worked so hard," said
D'Onofrio. "But it didn't seem like
things clicked for us tonight. The
ball just didn't bounce our way."
Although UCLA's defense
appeared flawless in the game, the
Cardinal never stopped pressuring
Bruin defenders. Nevertheless,
UCLA goalie Chris Snitko only
touched the ball in the first 25
minutes of play for two goal kicks
and a touchback by a Bruin
defender. He finished the game
without a single save, evidence
that Stanford had trouble getting
a good look at the net.
But 28 minutes into the first
half, Cardinal junior midfielder
Ryan Collins received a cross-pass
from Goad and slapped it between
the posts. It was a replay of the
Bruin goal in every detail, and
with the score tied 1-1 at the half
Stanford had renewed hope and
vigor.
