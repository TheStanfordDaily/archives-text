# Men's soccer beaten by UCLA in tourney
## 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
LOS ANGELES - The dew on
the grass at UCLA's Spaulding
Field left all the players soaking
wet after the evening game. For
the Bruins, the water was a
refreshing symbol of their "wash
ing away" of a formidable oppo
nent and continuation in the play
offs.
For Stanford, the wetness only
served to conceal the tears.
In a valiant display of guts and
heart, the Cardinal men's soccer
squad trekked into a realm hereto
fore thought to be out of their
reach and lost a 2-1 heartbreaker
to third-ranked UCLA (17-2) Fri
day night in the first round of the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion playoffs.
"I knew it was going to be a
tight game," said senior forward
Ricky Goad, who had the assist on
Stanford's goal. "It's disappoint
ing. It's kind of hard to put it in
perspective right now."
It was a game that, on paper,
looked like an under-12 youth soc
cer league against a Division I col
legiate squad. But the contest
played out into an exciting
matchup that easily could have
gone the other way.
"We worked our butts off out
there," said sophomore forward
Carmen D'Onofrio. "But it seemed
like it was all in vain."
The game commenced in the
nippy Los Angeles evening, but
things heated up right from the

opening whistle. It was evident
from the beginning that Stanford
was facing a team much better
than any they had played this
year.
The Bruins' offensive pressure
weakened the Cardinal's defense
immediately, and UCLA's aggres
siveness near Stanford's goal put
the Bruins on top first. Sixteen
minutes into the matchup UCLA
defender Eddie Lewis took a
breakaway drive to the left side of
the net and crossed over to the
right, where the ball cleared the
right post by several feet.
"We worked so hard," said
D'Onofrio. "But it didn't seem like
things clicked for us tonight. The
ball just didn't bounce our way."
Although UCLA's defense
appeared flawless in the game, the
Cardinal never stopped pressuring
Bruin defenders. Nevertheless,
UCLA goalie Chris Snitko only
touched the ball in the first 25
minutes of play for two goal kicks
and a touchback by a Bruin
defender. He finished the game
without a single save, evidence
that Stanford had trouble getting
a good look at the net.
But 28 minutes into the first
half, Cardinal junior midfielder
Ryan Collins received a cross-pass
from Goad and slapped it between
the posts. It was a replay of the
Bruin goal in every detail, and
with the score tied 1-1 at the half
Stanford had renewed hope and
vigor.

Jeff Kogl consoles teammate Joel Russell after Stanford's 2-1 loss Friday.
"Stanford is a very difficult team
to play against," said UCLA coach
Sigi Schmid. "They play a physical
game, and that took us out of our
game."
The physical pressure that the
Cardinal utilized kept the skill of
the Bruins in check for most of the
first half. The second half contin
ued in the same fashion, but even
tually the precise passing and
expert dribbling of the Bruins sliced
through Stanford's defense again.
In the 56th minute UCLA midfield
er Sean Henderson scored on a
cross shot to the far post, and that
would the end of the scoring in a
defense-dominated contest.
"We battled back, but we had
the mental lapse and they scored
again," said Cardinal junior back
JefTKogi.
The Bruins played the final 35
minutes conservatively, but Stan
ford's physical play prevented
UCLA from simply sitting on the
ball and collecting the victory.
"They were very physical, and a
lot of the fouls that were called took
the momentum out of our players,"
Schmid said. "We lost the vision of
what we had to do."
Perhaps they lost that vision
because Stanford was in their face
for most of the game. Obviously
trying to combat the Bruins' appar

ent advantage in skill, the Cardinal
fought back with aggressiveness.
As a result, Stanford was called on
25 penalties as compared with
UCLA's 13, and the Cardinal col
lected four of the five yellow cards
passed out in the game.
"We're just happy to get the
win," Schmid said. "Stanford is the
most physical team we've played
against all year. Physical play is not
normally our strength, and it's
good to see us win a game where
that's what we've got to do."
Going into this game, the stats
were heavily in favor of the Bruins.
In addition to being ranked third
nationally, UCLA was first in the
MPSF Pacific division and placed
all 11 starters on MPSF all-star
teams. Rick Goad was the only Car
dinal player in the list of MPSF
scoring leaders for the season,
while the Bruins ranked five
starters in the top 16 scorers.
Snitko was the most productive
goalkeeper in the league, and
UCLA led the league in goals scored
while Stanford finished ahead of
only Oregon State.
"It's upsetting, but we got beat
by a better team," said Collins.
"They're by far the best team that
I've seen this year. It hurts, but as
least we put forth a good effort."
The fact that Stanford even
scored against the Bruins, who
collected 11 shutouts during the
season, is praiseworthy. The Car
dinal held UCLA to under three
goals, a feat accomplished by only

six other teams this year. But this
serves as little consolation to
Stanford.
"They're a good team, and we
have to give them credit because
they deserved to win," said Goad.
"But I still think that our team did
a great job. We battled all the way
and never gave up on ourselves."
Stanford's primaiy problem, and
the one that prevented them from
moving into the playoffs, was an
inability to continue a pass pattern
deep into the Bruins' defense. UCLA
backs have allowed only 0.61 goals per
game this season, and the impenetra
ble force they represent caused prob
lems for the Cardinal all night.
"They're very, veiy good at the
restarts on our side of the field,"
said Lindores. "You take your eye
off the ball and let them turn a play
and they'll score off of it."
Although the loss ends Stan
ford's play for the year, it is a sea
son that will be recalled fondly.
"We struggled in the season, but
this team showed a lot of character,"
said D'Onofrio. "We made it to the
playoffs, and that's always a goal.
Things are looking bright for next
year, and hopefully we'll be back."
The coaching staff also remi
nisces on the season as one of
improvement, and the strong finish
points in a positive direction for the
squad in the future.
"We can look at it and say that
the season ended on a big plus,"
said Lindores. "It really looks
promising for next year."
