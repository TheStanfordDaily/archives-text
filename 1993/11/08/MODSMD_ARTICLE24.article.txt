## Well-balanced Cardinal squad advances in Rolex Tournament 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
Even if the Stanford men's ten
nis team doesn't end up victorious
after today's final round of the
Rolex Regional Qualifying Tourna
ment, the squad will still walk
away confident after their strong
display of depth against the West
Coast's best collegiate players this
weekend at Stanford.
Despite the absences of seniors
Michael Flanagan and Robert
Devens, who were unable to play in
the tournament, and Chris Coco
tos, who was forced to default in
the third round when his shoulder
tightened up on him, the second
ranked Cardinal has shown that
they will not be denied a strong
showing.
Sophomore Jim Thomas has
been the story of the tournament
thus far, reaching this morning's
final round. After rolling over his
opposition in the first three
rounds, Thomas faced the No. 5

seed in the tournament, Califor
nia's Brian Eagle, whom he defeat
ed in a comeback victory by a score
of 0-6, 6-4, 6-3.
In the quarterfinals, Thomas'
strong volleys helped him dispose
of Pacific's Adi Kremer, 6-4, 6-3.
Kremer was the tourney's fourth
seed and had narrowly defeated
Stanford's Ricky Becker in the
fourth round.
Thomas culminated his march
to the finals with a hard-fought
semifinal victory over teammate
and No. 2 seed Vimal Patel, 6-4, 4-
6, 6-4.
"I had to serve well because
Vimal's returns are so strong," said
Thomas. He added, "It's always
tough to play someone who's on
your team."
"Jim really worked hard this
summer to improve his game," said
Stanford head coach Dick Gould.
"He will be a big factor for this
year's team."
Thomas, who is seeded among
the tournament's top 16 players,

said that he "had a good couple of
days (and) hopes to pull out the big
match."
Thomas will face off against
Cal's promising sophomore, Casey
Louie. The Golden Bear pulled off
several upsets of his own, including
a 6-3, 5-7, 6-1 semifinal victory
over the No. 1 seed, San Jose
State's Brandon Coupe.
Coupe's defeat may be partially
due to fatigue incurred during a
tough quarterfinal victory over the
Cardinal's seventh-seeded Jeff
Salzenstein one hour prior to his
semifinal match.
In what Gould labeled "the best
match of the tournament so far,"
Salzenstein and the highly regard
ed Spartan split the first two sets
before a break late in the third set
allowed Coupe to serve out the
match, 7-6, 2-6, 6-4.
"There wasn't much difference
between us as far as ability,"
Salzenstein said. "Coupe just
seemed to win the big points."
Salzenstein wasn't the only Car

dinal to give Coupe trouble in the
tournament. He had to fight off a
surprising attack by freshman Grant
Elliot in the fourth round. The Palo
Alto native took Coupe to a first-set
tiebreak before losing the first match
of his Stanford career, 7-6, 6-2.
Elliot, who was getting over a
case of walking pneumonia, said
that he "felt comfortable" in front
of the contingent of friends and
fans that came out to see him, but
that he "ran out of gas after the
first set."
In doubles play, the newly
paired tandem of Patel and Salzen
stein has advanced to the semifi
nals, where they will face off today
against Washington's Ornello
Arlati and Mark Tomandl.
In a schedule change, the sin
gles finals as well as the doubles
semifinals will be played concur
rently at 10 a.m. this morning on
the stadium courts. The doubles
finals will take place a half-hour
after the conclusion of the semifi
