# Field hockey team comes to end of road
## Season ends with a 3-0 loss to California in NorPac championship 
### Christian Leone Staff writer 
On Friday, Stanford's field hockey team
was defeated by California 3-0 in the North
ern Pacific championship game for the second
straight year. The Cardinal's eighth loss of
the season propelled the Golden Bears (7-7)
into the NCAA tournament find ended an
impressive but frustrating season for the Car
dinal.
The Cal team started the scoring early on
their home field. Cal's junior midfielder,
Annie Lavelle, fired the first salvo 10 minutes
into the game with an unassisted rocket blast
into the net's lower-right corner. Five min
utes later, Cal was awarded a corner. Lavelle
started the play by passing to her sister Kath
leen Lavelle, who stopped the ball for Cal's
leading scorer Use Akkermans. Akkermans
then found the back of the net for the seventh
time this season.
"It was awful. In the first half we were not
ready at all and they pounced on us," said Car
dinal defender Danielle Beynet. "We just sat
there and watched."
One minute and 19 seconds later, the same
Cal trio combined for another goal. Off a beau

tiful pass from her sister, Kathleen again
stopped the ball for Akkermans, who knocked
in her second goal of the game.
"It was a weird day," said Cardinal mid
fielder Gina Bianchini. "It was just one of
those games where it just didn't click. They
were pumped up and we just were not ready."
Sophomore Jen Gleuck agreed with Bian
chini. "Cal came out really strong," she said.
"Some days a team has it and sometimes they
don't. As much as we wanted it, it just wasn't
there."
Senior netminder Kasandra Cronin record
ed 10 saves to preserve Cal's shutout and
insure its trip to the NCAAs. "We had a lot of
chances, we just could not put them in," said
Beynet. "We dominated the second half but it
was too late."
"We were really psyched going into the
game," said Stanford freshman Baochi Ng
uyen. "We desrved it. With an Ail-American
and most likely a couple of All-NorPac's, we
are a much more skilled team. It's too bad we
had such an off game on such an important
day."
Despite a disappointing end to the season,
Stanford, which finishes the season with an 8-
8 mark, proved itself to be one of the top

teams in the league when it went 2-2 against
some of the best teams in the nation earlier
this year. However, the season has been frus
trating, as five of the Cardinal's eight losses
have been by one goal and severed have come
in overtime.
"Despite all the frustrations, we accom
plished a lot," said sophomore Elise Morgan.
"We have some underclassmen who have been
playing and next year the team is going to be
different in how we work together, but we
should still be a strong team."
Even though Stanford will lose seven
seniors, it expects to remain one of the top
teams in the West next year. "It's tough to
lose seven starting seniors," said freshman
Karla Peterson. "But don't count us out next
year."
"The freshman have really improved," said
senior All-American Sara Hallock. "They are
going to be great next year,"
The Cardinal's 8-8 record was significantly
better than last year's 4-9-2 mark, and Stan
ford hopes to build on this year's showing next
season. "We improved a lot as a team," said
freshman Amy Marfil. "Overall, it was a suc
cessful season. We wanted to go on, but it just
didn't happen."
