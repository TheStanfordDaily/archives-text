# Club sports: hockey falls, smashers soar
## 
### Todd Bernstein Staff writer 
As the fall club sports season
rolls along, a few teams are cur
rently facing key competition.
Among the squads which have
already faced fierce challenges
are the ice hockey and racquet
ball teams, each of which
looked to establish itself over
the weekend as a powerhouse
in the collegiate ranks of its
respective sport.
Ice Hockey
The ice hockey team had an
extraordinarily rough weekend,
dropping two games on their
home ice in Redwood City to
Arizona State by the scores of
10-5 and 6-5. The Cardinal
played well in both games, but
faltered in the third period of
each match. Stanford, which
entered the weekend contests
without six key players for rea
sons including injuries and a
suspension, lost three more
members to the injured list
over the course of the weekend.
On Friday night, the team
battled ASU to a standstill for
two periods, but completely fell
apart in the third, yielding five
unanswered goals. The team,
which started the game with
three lines of players, was
reduced to two lines by the
start of the third period.
Among these losses was de
fensemen Vince Georges, who
had to leave the game with a
broken wrist.
The loss of these players
hampered the Cardinal de
fense, especially since Stanford
was already playing shorthand
ed. Senior Geoff Garrison was
out for Friday's game, serving a
one-game suspension for fight
ing in last weekend's game
against Colorado State. Evan
Singer was out of the lineup, as
well, due to a cracked verte
brae. Nick Fekete was also side
lined this weekend with a torn
back muscle.
All of the injuries and sus
pensions led to the third-period

collapse on Friday night. "It
was a very frustrating experi
ence," Winter said of the defen
sive cataclysm. "We fell apart
as a team and just broke down
in the third period."
Saturday night's game was a
more positive effort by the Car
dinal, who fell just one goal
short of victory. The team out
shot and outplayed the Sun
Devils for the first two periods
of the game, but once again lost
the lead in the third period.
The team looks to improve
upon these losses and witness
the return of several players
from the injury list before next
weekend's games at the Uni
versity of Arizona.
Racquetball
The racquetball team placed
third in its first-ever tourna
ment at the UC-Davis Invita
tional this weekend. At the
competition, the Cardinal faced
experienced teams from Brig
ham Young University, UC-
Davis, Sacramento State and
California.
The men's squad was an
chored by sophomore James
Mulcock. Mulcock, the sixth
ranked junior player in the
nation, posted a perfect 4-0
record. The team was also led
by senior Ryan Kaltman, who
earned a 2-2 split in his games.
Also giving strong perfor
mances for the men's squad
were Paul Previde, Matt Hills,
Tom Nolan and Brad Presner.
The play of the team placed
them ahead of California and
Sacramento State, but was not
good enough to catapult them
past BYU or UC-Davis.
The women's squad's lone rep
resentative was Michele Pifer, who
was playing in her first tournament
ever.
"We're very proud of our success
this weekend," said Kaltman. "We
hope to become stronger and do bet
ter in February at the Berkeley
Invitational."
This invitational, the Cardi
nal's next competition, will be
held Feb. 22 and 23.
