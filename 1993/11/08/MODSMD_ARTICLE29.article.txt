# Despite hardships, Russian choir practices for first performance
## 
### Anthony Marsh 
In the tradition of the Hoover Institution's exten
sive collection of Russian artifacts and past visits
from former Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev,
the Russian spirit has once more returned to Stan
ford — but this time with a song.
Without the benefits of a regular practice room or
even a paid director, the 11-member Stanford Rus
sian Choir still manages to bring the beauty and tra
dition of Russian music to the Farm.
The choir, which was formed in 1992, is currently
practicing for its first performance, scheduled for
December in Slavianskii Dom. The group did not per
form a concert last year because of its newness and
instability, but concentrated instead on developing
each member's vocal ability, said choirmaster Irina
Talyanskya.
At choral rehearsal, the group focuses on learning
the musical fundamentals, like tempo, pitch and
rhythm; warm-ups include clapping, developing
range and rhythmically pronouncing lyrics in Rus
sian. "Every person has to not only show their knowl
edge and ability with singing, but their own timbre —
color of voice," Talyanskya said.
Since the group is still just starting out, their reper
toire consists mainly of simpler tunes, such as popular
folk songs and church songs, Talyanskya said.
One popular folk song, "Kalinka" (Little Snowball
Bush) carries the sound and beat of a nursery rhyme:
"Ka-lin-ka, Ka-lin-ka, Ka-lin-ka mo-ia! Vsa-du ia
go-da ma-lin-ka mo-ia," which, translated, means
"Ka-lin-ka, Ka-lin-ka, Ka-lin-ka of mine! In the gar
den grows a berry like sweet sherry wine."
The choir learns songs in English and in a "step
by-step" format, said Talyanskya, a former precentor,
professional singer and vocal instructor with the
Kazan opera. Prospective members need no previous

choral experience, nor do they need to be proficient in
Russian in order to audition, she said. The choir,
sponsored by the Slavic Department, is open to stu
dents, faculty, staff and all members of the Stanford
and Palo Alto community.
"You're not expected to be a singer when you
start," graduate student Sergei Makar-Limanov said.
"Irina takes you from where you are and lifts you
up," said Christian Pappas, a Berkeley graduate stu
dent.
But in its attempts to "explore the classical Russian
vocal tradition," the choir has also found itself strug
gling for cohesion and stability, Talyanskya said.
For instance, they still have not found a regular
rehearsal room. The group has held rehearsals every
where, from the logical choice of Braun Music Center
to their "desperation point" — the Medical Center.
Being shut out of rehearsal space has hindered
their "development and growth as a choir group," said
member Luba Talaska, the wife of a Stanford physi
cist.
Although they started at Braun, the group has not
been able to get priority or preference in scheduling
because they are not sponsored by the Music Depart
ment, said the choir's University liaison Luba
Mintas.
"There is no definite policy, no definite meeting
places," Talyanskya said. "You can't predict from
week to week where you will rehearse."
In addition, Talyanskya volunteers as choirmas
ter, while working a second job as a ballet school
pianist in Palo Alto.
Still, despite the obstacles, Talyanskya and the
choir remain dedicated to their work. "My attempt is
not to teach Russian songs, but as a professional, my
most true interest is in the personal growth and
development of peoples' voices for the purpose of
knowing how to express oneself," said Talyanskya.
