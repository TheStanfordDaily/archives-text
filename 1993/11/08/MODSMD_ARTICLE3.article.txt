# Community service day draws hundreds
## 
### Cindy Yu 
While some students spent Saturday cram
ming for midterms, others took the day off to
build a nature trail, spruce up a senior citizens'
home and organize a Christmas gift program,
and participate in other community service ac
tivities.
More than 300 Stanford students from 40
different dorms participated in Reach Out
Today, the annual campus-wide community
service day sponsored by the Stanford Volun
teer Network.

"The purpose of Reach Out Today is to pro
mote service on campus and to get as many stu
dents to participate in community service as
possible," said senior Roopal Mehta, chair of
the volunteer network. This year also marks
the event's 10th anniversary.
The volunteer network sponsored 26 pro
jects on Saturday throughout the Bay Area
which were divided into various categories, in
cluding hunger and homelessness, youth, envi
ronment, the elderly and health care.
" It was a very rewarding experience. . . . It's
good to get away from campus and help out the

community. It makes people aware of what's
going on outside of school and studying," said
sophomore Vivek Nasta, a community service
representative for Lantana House. "I did it last
year and I plan to do it next year. ... I'll defi
nitely do it again."
Freshman Sarah Horine, whose dormitory
went to Escondido School to work on the school
grounds, said, "It was a good way to launch off
the year in community service, at least within
the residences. I was impressed by how much
we accomplished."
Students from West Lagunita
helped the school by spreading
compost and mulch to improve
the playground areas. However,
Horine added that her dormmates
were disappointed the project did
not deal with people directly.
"They enjoyed it, but I think
they would've preferred working
with people so they could see the
impact firsthand," Horine said.
Other groups worked on envi
ronmental projects. About 60 stu
dents from Toy on, Adams, Alon
dra, Twain and other dormitories
traveled to the hills above Stan
ford near the Dish to plant acorns.
"I really enjoyed it.... It was a
good way to meet people and work
with others," said freshman Tom

Narang, community service repre
sentative for Twain. "And I know
more people want to become
involved after trying it this first time.
We have a lot more people signed
up so we're ready to do it again."
Greek organizations also
pitched in. Members of the Chi
Omega sorority helped clean
tables and chairs at St. Anthony
of Padua Church, which serves
meals to the hungry.
"I think |the community ser
vice project] is a great idea," said
senior Jennifer Randall, commu
nity service chair for Chi Omega.
"It's only one day, and when peo
ple know it's Reach Out Today
and that all the dorms are doing
it, it's easier to get people to vol
unteer."
Although the projects only last
for one day, they can lead to a
more extended commitment from
students.
"It was hard work," Randall

said, but "everyone was really posi
tive and they didn't mind getting
wet and dirty. In fact, we've already
talked about going back later
on this year to serve food there."
Overall, the community ser
vice program appeared very suc
cessful, according to the officers
of the volunteer network.
"From the feedback I've gotten
from individuals, I'd say that it
was very successful. We had no
problems this year, not even the
usual problems like transporta
tion," said junior Kris Ledesma,
co-director of special projects at
the volunteer network.
"This is the first time we've
had more students than projects,"
Mehta said. "Usually we end up
with several leftover projects, but
this year, we've had so much
interest that we've ended up call
ing many agencies and asking
them if 20 students were OK
instead of 10."
