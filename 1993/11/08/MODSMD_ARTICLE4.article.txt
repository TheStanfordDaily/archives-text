## 30 vie to become next basketball announcer 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
They came from all over the
Bay Area yesterday for a shot at
the big time.
They included lawyers, a re
tired assistant police chief, an
electrician, a stand-up comedi

Bob Vazquez narrowed the list
down to about 30 men for Sun
day's tryout, and a panel of
judges from the Department of
Athletics will select between
four to six finalists to do live au

basketball exhibitions on Nov.
17 and 22.
The new announcer, assum

will then be able to keep the job
for as long as he wants it,
Vazquez said.
Like Frost, almost everyone
who auditioned yesterday had
at least some experience in an
nouncing, either at high schools
or small colleges, and several
said the opportunity to work in
the Pacific 10 Conference could
