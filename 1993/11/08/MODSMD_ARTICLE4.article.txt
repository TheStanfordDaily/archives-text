# Shooting for the mike
## 30 vie to become next basketball announcer 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
They came from all over the
Bay Area yesterday for a shot at
the big time.
They included lawyers, a re
tired assistant police chief, an
electrician, a stand-up comedi
an, a Stanford football player
and even a two-time losing can
didate for the ASSU Council of
Presidents.
And they all wanted one
thing — to become the next pub
lic address announcer for Stan
ford men's basketball team.
"Good evening ladies and
gentlemen, and welcome to
Maples Pavilion for tonight's
game."
With their booming voices
echoing throughout the empty
arena, the 30 wanna-be an
nouncers squared off in hopes of
occupying what has been called
the best seat in the house.
"I've done public address an
nouncing in high school, and I
do it whenever I go home," said
junior Steve Frost, a back-up
noseguard for the Cardinal foot
ball team. "It's always been

kind of fun, and I think this
would be a great experience."
Eighty-two people had ap
plied to fill the shoes of long
time Cardinal public address
announcer Len Smith. Smith,
who had held the position since
1982, moved to Prescott, Ariz.,
during the summer.
Sports Information Director
Bob Vazquez narrowed the list
down to about 30 men for Sun
day's tryout, and a panel of
judges from the Department of
Athletics will select between
four to six finalists to do live au
ditions during the two men's
basketball exhibitions on Nov.
17 and 22.
The new announcer, assum
ing he does a satisfactory job,
will then be able to keep the job
for as long as he wants it,
Vazquez said.
Like Frost, almost everyone
who auditioned yesterday had
at least some experience in an
nouncing, either at high schools
or small colleges, and several
said the opportunity to work in
the Pacific 10 Conference could
be the "big break" for their
career.
"I'm hoping that maybe this
could get me into play-by-play
broadcasting," said John Reid,
40, who delivers hot dogs in San
Francisco for a mqjor meat-pack
ing company. "I think there are a
lot of people here who feel like
that."
The chance was also too good
for Anthony Robinson, 29, to pass
up.
"Any time I get this type of
opportunity to apply, I have to go
for it," said the Santa Rosa
junior high school campus super
visor, who had been the
announcer at Sonoma State for
four years. "I also went out to
Candlestick Park last spring
when they had tryouts to be the
San Francisco Giants announc
er, and this is just another great
opportunity."
For those not interested in a
career in sports announcing, it
was the lure of a good time — as
well as the salary of $40 to $50
per game — that motivated them
to apply.
"I love public address
announcing. You have a lot of
control over the crowd and how
they react," said senior Jeff Ota, a
veteran KZSU basketball broad
caster and the only other under

graduate besides Frost to survive
the cut. "I hope to bring class and
excitement to the games."
Every candidate worked to
show off his own unique style,
sticking closely to the script while
setting himself apart from the
rest of the pack.
"I'll be pretty straightfor
ward," said David Hyatt, a 1992
graduate who twice ran for the
COP on the slate sponsored by
the Chaparral, the campus
humor magazine. "On my tape, I
used more of a deep voice than I

usually speak in, and I think I will
go with what got me here."
After the tryouts, the judges
said they expect to have a diffi
cult time choosing the finalists,
who will be named by Wednes
day.
"The competition was keen,
and there were a few surprises,"
Vazquez said. "It will be difficult
to cut this list down, but there
were several people who stood
out. It was also very exhausting
to listen to all of these voices and
try to distinguish each one."
