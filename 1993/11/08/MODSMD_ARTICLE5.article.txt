# Barney visits, entertains kids in Escondido Village
## Hundreds come to see fat purple dinosaur 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
Nearly 500 people turned out in
sunny Escondido Village on Saturday
to paint their faces, dig through the
sand and pay homage to Barney.
The occasion was Family Fun Day,
an event the University sponsored for
the about 400 families living in Escon
dido Village. Children had a chance to
make and decorate their own kites,
take part in a treasure hunt in play
ground sand and eat cupcakes.
The main attraction, however, was
Barney. When the perky purple di
nosaur with the fat green belly showed
up at 3 p.m., mobs of little children
swarmed to the stage where he was
dancing to prerecorded Barney music.
The character, star of a popular chil
dren's show, entranced his young audi
ence as dozens of parents videotaped
the event. Dancing with his two female
assistants from "Puddles O' Fun" —
the company that provided Barney —
the extinct one sang songs celebrating
the imagination, the sounds of barn an
imals and the difference between the
five fingers on a hand.
"Barney was a referral from a friend
who works at the children's hospital,"
said Cynthia Clement, the head family
graduate resident assistant and one of

the organizers of the day."I wish I'd
thought of it."
Escondido hosts one large event for
families each quarter, funded by a por
tion of the rent Escondido residents
pay. Clement said she and a staff of 12
graduate RAs had been planning Fam
ily Fun Day since the year began. Next
quarter she said, the family event will
likely be a safety fair.
Chris Griffith, director of graduate
residences, said the events are planned
so Escondido residents can "get to
know their neighbors. . . . And of
course, Barney is so popular." Out of
the about 3,500 Escondido residents,
Griffith estimated there are 400 fami
lies and 500 children, the target audi
ence for events like Fun Day.
And the children partying in the sun
on Saturday seemed to enjoy all the ac
tivities, especially Barney.
Psychology doctoral student Fred
Luskin and his wife Jan Krinsley, a
teacher at Escondido's Rainbow
School, said their two children, 16-
month-old Danny and 6-year-old
Anna, enjoyed the day's events, and
Barney in particular Anna said Barney
was "good," though "kind of silly."
