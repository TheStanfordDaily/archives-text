# Senate bill could restrict Defense funds to Stanford
## Legislation would curtail support to schools that owe government 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
Congress is considering a bill
that would restrict Defense De
partment funding to Stanford and
seven other universities, a devel
opment that portends more legal
headaches for the University in its
incessant dispute with the federal
government.
The new measure — a rider to a
larger defense appropriations bill
— proposes to cut Defense Depart
ment support to any university
with outstanding debt to the gov
ernment exceeding $15 million.
According to some estimates,
Stanford may owe the government
as much as $200 million for alleged
improper accounting related to in
direct-cost reimbursement.

The differences between the
House and Senate versions of the
bill are scheduled to be worked out
by the joint congressional commit
tee on appropriations. The bill has
already been passed by both hous
es, but only the Senate version
contains the imposition on univer
sities.
An Appropriations Committee
spokeswoman said Friday that the
committee had not convened and
that there is no timetable for final
passage of the bill.
According to Office of Develop
ment figures for 1992, $36 million
of the $267 million of total federal
support to the University came
from the Defense Department.
Reed Brimhall, the Universi
ty's director of government rela
tions, said that even if the puni
tive wording survives conference
negotiations, the direct financial
effect on Stanford will not be
shatf ering.
"One way or the other, it won't
have an immediate impact on us,"
he said. "[But] we may have to go
to the Defense Department and
explain why this doesn't apply to
us."
The bill contains a proviso that
funding restrictions would be
relieved if "the institution either
repays in full to the U.S. Treasury
the amount overbilled to the fed
eral government, plus interest or .
. . is no longer liable for such
restitution, or that the dispute
has become the subject of formal
judicial review." Institutions
would have six months to comply
before penalties are imposed.
However, none of those provi
sions currently apply to Stanford.
An official in the office of govern
ment relations said passage of the
bill could force the University to
file a lawsuit to settle its differ

ences with the government. Stan
ford's case is under negotiation
with the Armed Service Board of
Contract Appeals, which is not
considered judicial review.
Indirect costs are overhead
expenses such as libraries and
staffing that accompany spon
sored research. The government
currently reimburses the Univer
sity 61 cents for every dollar of
government-sponsored research
to cover such costs.
The indirect-cost rate has been
under dispute since 1990 when
the Office of Naval Research's on
campus regulator Paul Biddle
accused the University of over
charging the government.
But whether the University
must repay the government for
the alleged overcharges remains
unclear. "Stanford has not been
told it owes anything," said Chief
Financial Officer Peter Van
Etten. "There has not been a set
tlement — only a draft audit that
questions some costs."
Van Etten said that "Biddle
used to throw around hundreds of
millions of dollars" as the amount
the University owes the govern
ment. "Those aren't real num
bers," he said. "We're in this
crazy situation where we're all

working to pull together to find
what the range of the [owed! dif
ference is."
If passed today, the appropria
tions bill would affect seven other
universities: Caltech, Carnegie
Mellon, Cornell, Georgia Institute
of Technology, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Penn
State and the University of
Hawaii. All institutions are
reportedly pressuring the confer
ence committee to strike the puni
tive wording.
Yet while the funding restric
tions may not make it past confer
ence scrutiny, Van Etten warned
that such efforts have not yet
exhausted themselves.
"Frankly, this happens every
year — inevitably, proposals like
this are put forward," he said.
However, he said that in the past
"eventually, people looked closer"
and such measures were reconsid
ered.
Brimhall added that the bill
may be a warning signal intended
to sound louder in Defense
Department offices than in uni
versity laboratories.
"My opinion is that this is a
way to send a message to the
Department of Defense to get
these things closed out," he said.
