# Senate bill could restrict Defense funds to Stanford
## Legislation would curtail support to schools that owe government

Congress is considering a bill
that would restrict Defense De
partment funding to Stanford and
seven other universities, a devel
opment that portends more legal
headaches for the University in its
incessant dispute with the federal
government.
The new measure — a rider to a
larger defense appropriations bill
— proposes to cut Defense Depart
ment support to any university
with outstanding debt to the gov
ernment exceeding $15 million.
According to some estimates,
Stanford may owe the government
as much as $200 million for alleged
improper accounting related to in
direct-cost reimbursement.

The differences between the
House and Senate versions of the
bill are scheduled to be worked out
by the joint congressional commit
tee on appropriations. The bill has
already been passed by both hous
es, but only the Senate version
contains the imposition on univer
sities.
An Appropriations Committee
spokeswoman said Friday that the
committee had not convened and
that there is no timetable for final
passage of the bill.
According to Office of Develop
ment figures for 1992, $36 million
of the $267 million of total federal
support to the University came
from the Defense Department.
