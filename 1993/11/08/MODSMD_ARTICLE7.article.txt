Last year, Stanford graduate
students found a champion for
their needs in an environment
often bent toward undergradu

George Dekker has been a busy

efforts of the past few years, has

fighting for more
graduate student
housing and in
creasing minority
graduate student
recruitment.
"Something

able source of information about
where to go, what to do, how to get
something done," he said.
So Dekker made the printing of
a new Graduate Student Hand
book a priority. Gathering infor

sources and hiring an editor to put
together the handbook, Dekker
has worked the last six months to
create the first graduate student
handbook since 1990.
Dekker said that the handbook
will "see the light of day" by the
end of this quarter, or the begin
