# Hectic schedule for grad students' dean
## 
### Josh Green Staff writer 
Last year, Stanford graduate
students found a champion for
their needs in an environment
often bent toward undergradu
ates. Since then, English Prof.
George Dekker has been a busy
man.

A 21-year veteran of the Stan
ford faculty, Dekker was appoint
ed associate dean of graduate poli
cy, a half-time position in the of
fice of the dean of research and
graduate policy. He is the first ad
ministrator designated for gradu
ate affairs since the dean of gradu
ate studies position was dissolved
in 1990.

Dekker, twice the chair of the
English Department and heavily
involved in the budget reduction
efforts of the past few years, has
piled up a number of items for his
agenda. Left to "shape the job and
create the role" as he wanted to,
Dekker concentrated on compiling
a graduate student handbook,

fighting for more
graduate student
housing and in
creasing minority
graduate student
recruitment.
"Something
that I discovered I
almost immedi- I
ately after taking '
up the job was

that there was no reliable, avail
able source of information about
where to go, what to do, how to get
something done," he said.
So Dekker made the printing of
a new Graduate Student Hand
book a priority. Gathering infor
mation from many different
sources and hiring an editor to put
together the handbook, Dekker
has worked the last six months to
create the first graduate student
handbook since 1990.
Dekker said that the handbook
will "see the light of day" by the
end of this quarter, or the begin


Dekker
ning of next quarter at the latest.
He added that it will be distribut
ed by mail to every graduate stu
dent, on and off campus.
"We had to make a lot of choic
es about what to put in and what
to leave out," Dekker said. "There
were some long, tedious policy
statements that I would have left
out, but it seemed necessary to
keep them in. I've edited a lot of
things, tried to cut them down to
the absolute minimum that con
veyed the information."
Dekker also is working on living
information for graduate students,
"things like where to go shopping
... or where to buy secondhand
children's clothes." Originally that
information was going to be includ
ed in the handbook, but Dekker
decided that it only pertained to
first-year graduate students, so it
will be published separately.
In addition to putting out the
handbook, Dekker has lobbied the
University to replace the Manzani
ta Park trailers with graduate
housing.
Dekker got help from a number
of Graduate Housing Advisory
Group student members, whom he
praised for "coming up with infor
mation and challenging ideas."
"I think we've made a signifi
cant and measurable amount of
progress over the last 12 months,"
Dekker said. "But frankly, at the
end of this, the progress will prob
ably be disappointing."

Dekker pointed out that the
trailers, which house about 150
graduate students, "are coming to
the end of any life they could possi
bly have."
"Structurally, [the trailers] are
ready to give up the ghost,"
Dekker said.
Dekker wants the University to
incorporate a new graduate resi
dence with more spaces than the
trailers into its 10-year, $100 mil
lion University-wide capital
improvements budget. But unfore
seen costs such as complying with
the Americans with Disabilities
Act is making administrators hesi
tant to approve an expensive new
residence, he said.
Though Dekker is cautious
about promising that the plan will
receive final approval, he is opti
mistic.
"One reason I think the Univer
sity is likely to approve this is that,
whatever happens, we have to do
something about the Manzanita
Park trailers," Dekker said.
Fourth-year electrical engineer
ing graduate student Tallis
Blalack, who was a member of the
Graduate Housing Advisory
Group and worked with Dekker on
the housing issue commended
Dekker's efforts.
"George Dekker is one of the
few administrators I've met who is
very concerned with graduate stu
dents," Blalack said.
Frustrated with the continuing
funneling of resources to under
graduates and long committee dis
cussions without real change,
Blalack said he was grateful for
Dekker's advocacy.

"There were about three stu
dents on the grad housing commit
tee," said Blalack, "and we'd come
out of the meeting talking amongst
ourselves, and say, Thank God for
George Dekker.' "
Blalack said the work on gradu
ate housing could make more
progress once the results of a
phone survey taken last spring are
analyzed and distributed. About
400 graduate students in different
living situations were included in
the survey.
"Hopefully the survey will
strengthen our position, which is
that there is a large demand from
grad students for housing, and it's
not being met," Blalack said.
Currently, 40 percent of Stan
ford's graduate students live in on
campus housing, according to
Blalack.
Blalack said Dekker has been
attentive to students and willing to
get input on a number of issues.
Dekker said the focus of the
University over the last 10 years
under former University President
Donald Kennedy has been on
undergraduate issues. He wants to
change that, beginning with ask
ing for the University to give grad
uate students a two-year housing
guarantee in place of the one-year
guarantee they now have. Dekker
said the two-year guarantee could
be in place within two years.
Dekker also foresees changes in
the lottery process to "achieve as
much equity within the system as
possible."
"We're within reach of some
significant improvement there,"
Dekker said. "It's not just pie in

the sky.... But it's going to fall
short, whatever we do is going to
fall short of what I would ideally
have."
Minority recruitment is also a
high priority for Dekker, because
of increasing competition among
high-level universities for a limited
number of qualified applicants.
"The provost has asked me to
take on oversight responsibilities
for minority recruitment, reten
tion, and graduation," Dekker
said.
In response to the provost's call,
Dekker has set up a committee to
review minority graduate student
issues. The committee, made up of
students, faculty, and recruitment
officers (three from each group),
will meet this winter to discuss
why Stanford minority graduate
student enrollment has been at a
plateau for the last three years.
While Stanford is "making an
effort" and "holding its own" in
comparison to other schools, the
committee will review the Univer
sity's weaknesses and try to come
up with viable solutions.
Dekker said financial aid for
minority students is not a primary
issue, since "by and large, we will
be able to come up with financial
aid, either from our own resources,
or a national fellowship."
While financial aid may not be
an issue, Dekker said increasing
the proportion of minority faculty
would increase the number of
minority graduate students who
want to come to Stanford.
A report from the committee
should be ready by April, Dekker
said.
