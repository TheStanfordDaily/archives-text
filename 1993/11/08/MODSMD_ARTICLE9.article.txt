Amherst to reinvest in S. Africa
Amherst College is considering changing
its policy of divestment in companies with
ties to South Africa, in light of the country's
upcoming elections.
The college initiated the policy in 1985.
But following ANC leader Nelson Mandela's
public plea in September for reinvestment in
South Africa, the school began to rethink the
sanctions, joining other colleges that have
reinvested such as Dartmouth and Connecti
cut colleges and Wesleyan University.
The board of trustees' investment committee
began discussing the issue around Oct 20. They
plan to review the current policy, get input from

student and faculty, and reach a decision some
time in November. The committee is opti
mistic that the policy will be rescinded.
However, some university employees said
they doubt that the policy changes would
impact campus life. For example, citing the
change from Coca-Cola to Pepsi products in
1989, food service officials said that chang
ing brands is an arduous process and there
has been no dissatisfaction with Pepsi, so a
change is not likely.
Mexico gives endowed chair
The University of California at Santa
Barbara was recently able to name the coun
try's first endowed chair in Chicano studies,

thanks in part to a $120,000 donation from
the Mexican government.
The endowment was campaigned for by
members of the UCSB community who
wanted to honor the accomplishments of
Prof. Luis Leal.
Leal is a literary historian whose work
includes the study of Chicano literature and
culture. He has been the recipient of many
awards in his career, including the Aztec
Eagle award, a prestigious honor from the
Mexican government. He has also authored
15 books.
The endowment, including corporate con
tributions, is worth about $360,000.
