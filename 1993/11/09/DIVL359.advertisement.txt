"The difficulty in life is the choice."
GEORGE MOORE
Investigating your professional options
is not easy. Finding the proper place
in which to pursue them is not much
easier. Founded in 1869, we've long
devoted ourselves to creating just such a
place. An investment bank that is
uniquely in tune with the abilities and
aspirations of the people who comprise
it. Where high professional standards
are reflected in principled everyday
practices. Where employees receive the
support and attention of the firm and
where clients receive the commitment
and dedication of every individual within
it. Where a variety of career opportunities
are available for individuals from a wide
range of backgrounds. And where those
who choose to accept the challenges of the
task before them are those who achieve
both personal and professional growth.
