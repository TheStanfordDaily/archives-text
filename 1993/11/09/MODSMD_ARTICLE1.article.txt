# 'Poetry is very personal. It's like sharing a part of yourself.'
## Group puts poetry in its place

Candles cast eerie flickering shad
ows on the walls as their light hits the
bodies in the room. Students gather on
couches arranged in a circle, some sip
ping subtly from flasks, others listen
ing intently. All eyes focus on the lone
presenter sitting in the center of the
room.
Though the scene may sound like a
bizarre Druid ritual, it actually de
scribes the Stanford Literary Forum's
Wednesday Night Readings.
These poetry/prose performance
events began last winter at the Deke
House when then-senior Nick Weber
noticed the lack of an organized outlet
for creative writing outside the class
room. "Everything was either acade

mic or social," Weber says. "No one
ever mixed the two. I like talking about
literature at parties, and I like to drink
beer or wine in a class, but it just
doesn't happen."
This year, the literary tradition con

Wednesday at 10 p.m.
In part, the poetry readings are a
part of a new national trend. What once
belonged only to a small New York sub
culture — immortalized in Audrey
Hepburn's smoky Parisian cafe in
"Funny Face"— has now hit the main
stream, from Gap ads to MTV spots, to
watering grounds in small midwestern
towns.
The trend was slower to catch on at
Stanford. With the University's em
phasis on engineering and science, and
the prevailing "anti-intellectual atti

tude" here, many students are skepti
cal about fiction writing, says senior
David Neiman, a regular reader.
Neiman, who joined the group last
spring, has agreed to organize the
weekly readings this year, since many
older members have graduated.
At the start of the evening, Neiman
asks who has brought works to read. At
least half of the audience is just there to
listen. Someone volunteers and sits in
the reader's chair in the center. A semi
traditional disclaimer follows in which
the poet explains that he or she wrote
this in a hurry, and that it's unfinished.
Then the performance begins. One
poet rocks back and forth, pounding a
fist to the rhythms of his poem, while
another sits back on her haunches as if
