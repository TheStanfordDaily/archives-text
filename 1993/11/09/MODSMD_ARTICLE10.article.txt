### Elise Wolfgram Editorial staff 
The Stanford Solar Car is far
ing well in the World Solar Chal
lenge, an 1,800-mile race through
Australia that began Nov. 7.
The Sunburner was in 14th
place yesterday, seven hours
behind the lead car, according to
team member Charles Nickel who
helped work on the car's electrical
parts.
But the race is close at this
point, with the second-place Uni
versity of Biel car only 15 minutes
behind the leader, Nickel said.
Fifty cars, entered by corporate,
college and high school teams, are
participating in the race.
The Sunburner is about on
schedule, Nickel said, and the 12-
person team will probably finish
on the sixth day of the competi

tion and is averaging about 45
miles per hour. The car trails the
other four colleges entered in the
competition: California Polytech
nic-Pomona, George Washington
University, California State-Los
Angeles and the University of
Michigan.
The race began in Darwin and
will end in the city of Adelaide.
The first teams are expected to
finish late tomorrow, with an
average speed of 53 miles per
hour.
The Sunburner was nearly
destroyed in a fire last year, but
project members worked thou
sands of hours and spent thou
sands of dollars to restore the car
to its former condition.
Following the World Solar
Challenge, the Stanford Solar Car
project members will form a new
team for the 1995 U.S. Sunrayce.
