Woman who cut off penis testifies
MANASSAS, Va. (AP) — A woman who cut
off her husband's penis sobbed on the witness
stand yesterday as she told the jury he pinned
her to the bed and raped her. Afler he fell
asleep, she said, "I lifted the sheets and I cut it."
John Wayne Bobbitt, 26, is accused of mari
tal sexual assault. Mrs. Bobbitt faces her own
trial Nov. 29 for the mutilation. Each could be
sentenced to 20 years in prison if convicted.
The prosecutor in the rape trial told the jury
of nine women and three men that Bobbitt fre
quently forced his wife to have sex.
The defense said the sex was consensual and
Lorena Bobbitt leveled a false accusation
because she was jealous and dissatisfied with
his lovemaking.
Mrs. Bobbitt, 24, testified that she objected
several times but her husband said her objec
tions didn't matter. She said that after inter
course she was angry, grabbed a knife and
returned to the bedroom.
Mrs. Bobbitt described how she fled the cou
ple's Manassas apartment the night of June 23,
still clutching the penis and the red-handled fil
leting knife. She said she was midway between
the apartment and her office when she realized
she was still holding the organ.
Mrs. Bobbitt severed two-thirds of her hus
band's penis while he slept.
In his cross examination of Mrs. Bobbitt,
defense attorney Gregory Murphy stressed
inconsistencies between her testimony and
prior statements about the mutilation.
Mrs. Bobbitt appeared to give conflicting
statements about whether her husband used
his feet or his hands to remove her running
shorts and how he held her down.
Stockholm museum robbed
STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) — Thieves cut
a hole in the roof of the Museum of Modern Art
and "ripped the heart out" of its Picasso collec
tion, stealing $52 million worth of uninsured
art work.
The thieves carried seven framed paintings
and a Picasso bronze sculpture out through the
roof in one of the biggest art heists in modern
history. Two of the paintings were by Georges
Braque and five by Picasso.
The break-in was discovered yesterday
morning. The sight of a 3-foot-by-3-foot hole in
the sheet metal and wooden roof, footprints on
the whitewashed wall and shattered glass on
the floor caused a guard to raise the alarm.
