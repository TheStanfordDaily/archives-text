## Serbs flee Sarajevo 
### 
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) —
Hundreds of Bosnian Serbs — mostly
women, children and elderly men — piled
onto buses yesterday in the first major
evacuation from Sarajevo since May.
By nightfall, more than 300 evacuees
had reached Serb territory by a round
about route through southwestern
Bosnia, after an evacuation marked by the
chaos and delays that have come to mark
life in the besieged capital.
A bus driver said one of four buses leav
ing the city was shot at, but that no one
was hurt.
In a suburb of Sarajevo, meanwhile,
Serb soldiers forced open a U.N. armored
vehicle with a crowbar yesterday and
abducted two Bosnian Croats taking part
in a peace mission to a central Bosnian
war zone.
In Sarajevo, Jarle Thorgersen, a U.N.
logistics officer, said 642 Serb civilians
were to be evacuated from the capital in
stages. No major evacuation of civilians
has taken place since May because of the
danger of crossing Croat, Muslim and Serb
lines to leave the city.
The evacuation was behind schedule
because of searches by Bosnian police of
evacuees' luggage, delays at government
checkpoints, and chaos at the departure
point.
Evacuees said Bosnian police would not
let them take letters, large amounts of for
eign currency, TVs or stereos.
Elvedin Kantardzic, a government liai
son officer with U.N. peacekeepers,
blamed much of the confusion of the flight
on Serb authorities.

He said they initially offered to let the
buses take a direct route between Sarajevo
and Pale, their headquarters outside the
capital, but then decided the buses must
follow a more circuitous route.
Driver Huso Melez said his bus, carry
ing 64 evacuees, was shot at by a Bosnian
army sniper. Nobody was hurt, he said.
U.N. spokesman Ray Wilkinson clari
fied a previous U.N. report that two buses
were fired at near the airport, saying he
did not believe the fire was directed at the
buses and that no shots came near the
vehicles.
The Serbs trying to leave were unde
terred, however, by violence en route.
In other developments, Germany and
France sought to revive Bosnian peace
talks by proposing yesterday that U.N.
sanctions be lifted from Yugoslavia if
Serbs make territorial concessions to Mus
lims.
The sanctions and cost of aiding Serbs
in former Yugoslav states have wrecked
Yugoslavia's economy, and the two
nations hope a promise to lift sanctions
would entice officials in Belgrade to pres
sure Bosnian Serb leaders.
The foreign ministers of the 12 nations
of the European Community discussed the
idea but made no decision. So far, the group
has insisted there will be no talk of lifting
the sanctions until a peace accord is signed.
Bosnia's government has rejected a
Serb-Croat peace plan to carve the repub
lic into three ethnic states, saying Serbs
should give up more land for the proposed
Muslim state. Serb forces now control 70
percent of Bosnia.
