# Yeltsin presents new constitution to voters
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Boris Yeltsin set
out his design for the new post-Soviet
Russia yesterday, with a draft constitu
tion that bolsters his presidency and
keeps a tight rein on Russia's restive
regions.
The constitution, which is to go
before voters next month, lets Yeltsin
serve out his five-year term until 1996
but sets lawmakers' terms at two years
— half the length proposed earlier.
The shorter terms and Yeltsin's
retreat from a promise to hold early
presidential elections in June have fed

criticism that he is strengthening his
own power at the expense of the leg
islative branch. Since disbanding par
liament and crushing resisters in early
October, Yeltsin has wielded virtually
absolute power.
Supporters say the president, elected
in 1991 and backed by a second popular
vote in April, should serve out his term
for stability's sake. They say parlia
ment, on the other hand, should turn
over more rapidly to ensure a smoother
transition while Russia undergoes
tumultuous changes.

Parliament will be chosen in nation
al elections on Dec. 12, the same day as
the referendum on the constitution.
The new document codifies much of
what the post-Soviet legislature or
Yeltsin already did by amendment or
decree, such as abolishing censorship,
guaranteeing privacy, and ensuring the
right to buy and sell land.
According to a working draft made
public early this month, the president
could declare a state of emergency and
temporarily cut back on civil freedoms. It
said, however, that laws spelling out the

conditions under which he can declare a
state of emergency have to be passed by
the new parliament. The final draft of the
constitution is to be made public today.
The early draft also gives the presi
dent the right to disband the lower
chamber if it rejects his candidate for
prime minister three times.
A presidential aide, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the only
major amendment to the document was
to abolish regional citizenships, mean
ing people would be citizens of the Rus
sian Federation only.
