HONEY, NOW THAT we are
alone, what are we going to
do tonight?
a. Hold hands
b. Kiss
c. Have sex
Although this multiple choice
question may seem inappropriate,
it is a standard query at Aiitioch
College in Ohio.
Antioch's Sexual Offense Policy
requires that community members
obtain "the verbal consent of the
other individuals] involved" if sex
ual contact is not mutually initiat
ed. While this policy was adopted
with good intentions, it oversteps
the limits which any university
community — whether it be Anti
och, Harvard or Stanford — can
place on the conduct of its residents.
The policy, which demands per
mission "specific to each act," was
established last year at Antioch in
the wake of growing concerns about
sexual assault on campus.
The explicit rules of this policy go

beyond the authority a college or
university has. The actions of those
in a sexual relationship cannot be
dictated by a school policy; sexual
behavior cannot be institutional
ized.
In addition, this policy does not
help solve disputes — it is still word
against word in cases where there is
no tangible evidence of assault.
Antioch's policy was obviously
formulated with positive inten
tions. However, there is a fine line
between discouraging unacceptable
behavior and orchestrating person
al relationships. Few other universi
ties have adopted Antioch's meth
ods, and with good reason. Stan
ford's sexual assault policy, which
also prohibits "sexual assault by
force or coercion," is far superior —
it does not attempt to dictate the
way in which a sexual relationship
should progress.
The success of a relationship
should not hinge upon a multiple
choice exam.
