# Reach Out Tomorrow
## 
### 
MORE THAN 300 students
from 40 different dorms
took a break from midterm
hell on Saturday to perform com
munity service through Reach Out
Today, Stanford's annual one-day
service project extravaganza.
It's encouraging to see such
high levels of participation in vol
unteer affairs, especially among
freshmen. And it's even more
encouraging to hear that the ser
vice day has sparked interest
among many students in long
term public service projects.
Because while Stanford has
much to offer students inside the
circumference of Campus Drive,
there's even more to be learned
outside of it. Projects like Barrio
Assistance, Ravenswood tutoring
and the Stanford Project on Nutri
tion provide a forum for students
to apply their skills in the real
world while providing service to
many who desperately need aid.

Last year, several of these
groups suffered from a lack of par
ticipation; hopefully, those who
had positive experiences volun
teering through Reach Out Today
will incorporate regular service
into their schedules.
Given the success of Reach Out
Today, the Stanford Volunteer
Network should consider expand
ing the event, perhaps making it a
quarterly affair. Students who
missed the first session could have
a second chance at an introduction
to service, and holding multiple
events would give students an
opportunity to explore different
kinds of community service before
committing to involvement in one
of the long-term projects. And,
obviously, it would benefit the
community three times as much.
With so much student interest,
Reach Out Today shouldn't be
limited to just one "Today" in a
year.
