## Rare discussion of religion 
### 
I HAVE NEVER been a very religious
person. I don't really subscribe to any
particular institutionalized faith, and
I am skeptical of any spiritual explana
tion for material objects. The scientific
method appears to be the most cogent
explanation for the evolution of our
world.
This being said, I have trouble deny
ing the existence of some inexplicable,
supernatural life-guiding force. There
are just some things which modern sci
ence cannot explain. If all of life began
as a big bang, where did the initial ele
ments for the great explosion come
from? At some point there had to be a
genesis of some sort. Why are some
people so much luckier than others?
The coincidences are too numerous for
me to relegate such outcomes to chance
alone. Most troublesome, why are we
alive and what will happen to us when
we die? I have spent many a sleepless
night thinking that there must be
some higher meaning for all of our
daily motions. Everything cannot end
when our last breath is gone.
I get a headache just thinking about
these things. I am sure I am not the
only person who contemplates these
issues. What troubles me is that, with
the exception of the religious groups on
campus, most Stanford students do not
voice these frustrating questions out
loud. We are comfortable discussing
culture but not religion.

Part of this discomfort has to do
with the academic nature of our envi
ronment. As mentioned earlier, the sci
entific method provides some limited
answers and then tells us that the
deeper questions require mental gym
nastics. Then there is deconstruction
ism and the relativist-positivist dogma.
According to this line of thought there
are no universal answers and religion
should be used as a basic form of social
control and empowerment. In many
ways multiculturalism is an outgrowth
of this creed.
Stanford, however, is not unique in
its avoidance of religious issues. For
much of America separation of church
and state has come to mean indiffer
ence to religion. A large number of
intelligent, affluent Americans do not
discuss the inexplicable.
I think that this American separa
tion of church and state has been one
of the pillars holding our diverse
nation together. America has never
been divided by a religious war. In the
same way, Stanford's indifference to
religion opens the campus to many
more perspectives than say, a Jesuit
school.
I do not want to change this, and I
am not arguing for greater attendance
at religious services, or for prayer in
school. In fact, I have never attended a
religious function where these ques
tions were adequately and fairly

addressed. Stanford is primarily a sec
ular institution, and it should never be
divided by religious issues. However, I
do not think that this caveat precludes
all discussion of religion.
In recent years we have taken some
ambitious steps at Stanford to address
questions of culture. I do not agree
with many of the particular steps
taken by the University, but I do think
that the changes have sparked a very
worthwhile discussion and reassess
ment of what culture means. Why
can't we have a similar discussion con
cerning religion?
I clearly am not advocating religious
programming. Instead I would encour
age students on campus to be more
open-minded and willing to voice those
headache-inducing anxieties which
trouble our sleep.
If there is an oppressor on campus it
might be the scientific method. I do not
think that I will ever be a very reli
gious person, and I will probably
remain non-denominational. I would,
however, like to have the comfort of
knowing that there are others who see
a limit to the materially explicable.

Jeremi is still searching for the meaning
of life. If you find it, give him a call.
