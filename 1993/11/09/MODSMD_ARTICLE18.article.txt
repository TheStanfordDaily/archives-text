## Former athlete opposes Stanford's ban on drug testing 
### 
AS A FORMER member of the Stan
ford women's swim team and
someone who has been drug-tested
countless times, I cannot believe that the
Department of Athletics and Stanford
University continue to support the now
six-year-old drug-testing ban of Stanford
athletes.
Although I supposedly benefited
directly and never had my privacy "invad
ed" at any collegiate event, I believe the
rule is hypocritical and an embarrass
ment to the school. Not only does it have
the potential to set a dangerous prece
dent, it ends up hurting the people it is
designed to protect: the athletes. Why
anyone participating in sports on the
NCAA level would be in favor of this rule
is beyond me.
Peeing in a cup while someone looks
on is not exactly pleasant. But I wouldn't
call it an invasion of privacy. If your urine
might contain performance-enhancing
substances that would give you an unfair
advantage, it is not a private issue. How
ever, I am neither qualified to discuss the

legal ramifications nor do I wish to do so.
This issue has a much larger scope, that
is, keeping sports drug-free. Besides, ath
letic competition is completely voluntary.
If you don't like the rules, don't partici
pate.
Were Stanford to win this lawsuit,
other schools might take up the battle
and rightfully win, given the precedent.
Soon, independent national sports-gov
erning bodies will be attacked by their
athletes on the same premise. After all,
peeing in a cup is an invasion of one's pri
vacy whether the NCAA is the boss or
anyone else. All of a sudden, sports in the
United States runs the risk of becoming
extremely drug-infested since there is no
longer a deterrent. More importantly, we
can no longer expect or demand other
countries to submit to drug testing if we
aren't allowed to monitor our own.
Ted Leland said in the Nov. 2 edition
of The Daily, "We just want to protect
Stanford students from violations of their
privacy." Yet he seems to forget that this
trend may, in the long run, sabotage the

efforts of our own athletes. Need I
remind him of the 1992 Olympics where
two Stanford women swimmers lost out
on gold medals due to suspected steroid
induced performances of the Chinese?
Leland goes on to claim that the rule is
not an issue of competitive advantage.
Maybe the rule isn't, but its implications
are. Ask anyone who has ever had to pro
duce a urine specimen and they will tell
you it can be an extremely time-consum
ing process. When done at competitions,
Stanford athletes have the luxury of skip
ping the whole ordeal, using their time to
rest up and concentrate on the event at
hand. Not a competitive advantage? You
better believe it is. The lawsuit Stanford
is in at the moment supports this unfair
ness.
Lastly, "Robert Van Nest, the attorney
representing the Stanford athletes, said
that students who do not exhibit suspi
cious behavior should not be subjected to
infringement of privacy in order to partic
ipate in sports." Where do you draw the
line on suspicious behavior? Obviously,

given the state of affairs, more concrete
measures are necessary than how an ath
lete acts. There is no doubt in my mind
that there are people out there who are
on steroids who act normally. They would
just slip through the system if Van Nest
had his way. He obviously misses the
point: Drug testing is designed to avoid
such subjectivity as defining "suspicious
behavior."
I, as a former Stanford athlete, would
have gladly submitted to drug testing as
many times as needed to keep my sport
fair. This is a small price to pay for the
satisfaction of knowing the individual in
the lane next to me is clean. Ultimately,
we, the athletes, are the ones to benefit.
Given that Stanford is a leader in ath
letics both on a national and internation
al level, we should be at the forefront in
supporting drug testing. Hurrah for the
state Supreme Court for showing "little
enthusiasm" for the case. I hope Stanford
loses.
