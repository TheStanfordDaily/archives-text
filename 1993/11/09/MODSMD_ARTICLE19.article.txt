# Both interdisciplinary and discipline-specific writing classes needed
## 
### 
The Oct. 28 editorial in The Daily
argues, correctly, that students need to
learn "to write for their audience." To
accomplish this, it proposes elimination
of the present writing requirement and
a substitution of writing-intensive
courses within disciplines. This proposal
wrongly conflates writing for an audi
ence with writing for a professor within
a discipline. In fact, because academic
writing today is increasingly interdisci
plinary, students ought to learn how to
write for non-disciplinary audiences.
At the moment I am reading a book
on Puerto Rican gangs in Chicago, "The

Gang as an American Enterprise." Felix
Padilla, the author, defines his audience
as follows: "As a professor, I have made
a commitment to write for the entire
public, to make sure that my colleagues
and peers as well as nonacademics can
read and understand the story. There
fore, I have refrained from saddling the
story with all the usual jargon of social
science."
Padilla does not say he never learned
jargon; he just won't use it. In effect, he
learned to write twice, once to be under
stood by sociologists and again to trans
late for non-sociologists, for "the entire
public."
It is not just Padilla who writes for
general readers. As firms operate in a
global economy, they hire people who
have an international perspective, which
means knowledge of non-English lan
guages and countries, but which also

means an ability to translate complex
problems for general readers. This is
why the Big Eight accounting firms
issued a report in 1989 demanding that
students have "more breadth." More
breadth included the ability to write for
varied audiences. For many business
schools recently, building an interna
tional curriculum has led to a focus on,
among other things, writing.
Interdisciplinarity and globalization
are facts of writing life. Today and
tomorrow, students will be called on to
write for far more varied audiences than
a professor in one's discipline. Thus,
while discipline-specific writing courses
are a good idea, students also need to
take a course which asks them to pro
duce texts for general audiences.
