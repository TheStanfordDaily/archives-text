The Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center and Varian Associates
Inc. of Palo Alto yesterday an
nounced that they have signed a
$1.5 million research and develop
ment agreement to produce mi
crowave tubes called klystrons
that will drive SLAC's asymmetric
B factory.
The B factory — for which
funding was approved by Con
gress and the president in late Oc
tober — will enable scientists to
study the differences between
matter and antimatter by collid
ing electrons and positrons to pro
duce millions of short-lived Band
anti-B meson particles.

The state-of-the-art $240 mil
lion collider will be built by up
grading SLAC's current Positron
Electron Project (PEP) ring — a
2.2 kilometer particle collider —
and will have a much higher ca
pacity to collide electrons and
positrons.
While the PEP ring can circu
late six bunches each of electrons
and positrons at any one time, the
new B factory will be able to han
dle up to 1,700 bunches at once,
according Michael Riordan, assis
tant to SLAC director Burton
Richter.
This increased capacity makes
necessary the advanced klystrons
which will be built by Varian and
