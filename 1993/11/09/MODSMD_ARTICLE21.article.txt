# N'Gai Croal: an open letter to the Y-chromosome
## Men on the verge of a nervous breakdown 
### 
Dear brothers,
CAN WE talk? It's that time of year.
Leaves fall, daytime shrinks, the
night air gets even colder and our
thoughts turn to indoor sports. Like a full
dose of GHB steroids in a trendy L.A.
nightclub, the season has a strange effect
on our minds and bodies. Thoughts of
poetry dance through our heads as we
romanticize a three-letter word into a
four-letter one: L-O-V-E. Big mistake.
Welcome to the next level.
Say it. Say it. "To hell with love."
There now, don't you all feel better? It
may be tough for us to admit, but the
most recent person to say it best was an
XX. Annie Ross' tough cookie in Robert
Altman's "Short Cuts" sang it loud and
sang it proud, "To hell with love," growl
ing as though her life depended on it.
Before her, in Spike Lee's "Mo' Better
Blues," Denzel Washington scatted,
"What the world needs now ... is not
another love song."
It's all true.
The other 51 percent has had us on the
ropes for years now, and they're closing

in for the kill. First, they wanted a man's
man. Gary Cooper, Rock Hudson, Clint
Eastwood — someone who would make
their day. Someone who could take out
four bad guys without breaking a sweat
or dropping their cigarettes. Someone
who would rather die than let a single
tear drop from their eyes. So we did that.
Then they wanted a woman's man.
Bill Cosby, Richard Dreyfuss, Alan Alda
— someone who would ask them how
their day went and really mean it. Some
one who would convince the four bad
guys to put down their guns and get in
touch with their inner children. Someone
who would cry every day just to show how
sensitive they were. And we did that too.
Now they want repression. Anthony
Hopkins. Daniel-Day Lewis. Tom Hanks.
Someone who would never ask them how
their day was because that would be a
pornographic breach of form ("Remains
of the Day"). Someone who will pine over
them for a lifetime but never make a
move until it's much too late ("The Age of
Innocence"). Someone who lives clear
across the country and moons over his

dead wife — without ever crying — forc
ing them do all the work to even get to
meet him ("Sleepless in Seattle").
I'm gonna hurl.
Goodfellas, we only have ourselves to
blame. Martin Scorsese got away from
that violent, Italian thing and turned his
back on the balls-out world of "Raging
Bull" and "Cape Fear" to write and direct
the drawing-room tangos of "The Age of
Innocence." Kazuo Ishiguro wrote the
novel "Remains of the Day," which was
produced and directed by the dynamic
duo of James Ivory and Ismail Merchant.
Hold the gender gap, though. Women
are eating this stuff up by the pound.
They walk out of the theater, eyes misted
over, wondering where they can find a
man that they can't call their own.
On the surface, it doesn't make much
sense that women would go for it. How
many of you would keep Michelle Pfeif
fer, Emma Thompson or Meg Ryan at
arm'B length for even the two-hour run
ning time of an average movie? That's
male fantasy at its finest — a man with
the almost effortless strength to resist

the last temptation of western cinema's
icons of beauty.
Fear of commitment has become a
virtue — with women as its foremost
admirers, and our fellow men are bent on
selling us out with this ice-king persona.
Where can we turn? Does anyone have
the courage to wipe this neo-Victorian
sensibility off the silver screen?
It's time for us to bite the bullet and
sleep with the enemy.
Yes, the best man for the job is a
woman. Jane Campion's latest film, "The
Piano," shatters the stereotypes of
repressed men and women at the turn of
the century. True, the film is a period
piece. But the Merchant-Ivory sense of
propriety is thrown out the window,
replaced by volatile emotions — fear,
lust, jealousy — in '90s doses.
The skinny? A newlywed woman
allows another man to take increasing
liberties with her to get back her prized
piano. I know, I know. You're thinking
"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down," pr the origi
nal "Beauty and the Beast" before Disney
got their revisionist paws on it.

But it's actually a whole new world.
Campion's poetic brand of feminism spins
a tale that champions passion and hon
esty over repression and self-delusion —
an antidote to our age of faux innocence.
The Hopkins' and Day-Lewis' of the
world would leave "The Piano" scratch
ing their heads. So don't fall for the new
standard in guy fare, no matter how
much women's hearts flutter at the sight
of these inaction heroes. "The Piano" is
about to sound in full fanfare mode, sig
naling that the cineplex — or at least the
art house — is once again a safe haven for
love. Play it again, Jane.
Fool for love,
N'Gai .

Don't let the bravado fool you. N'Gai can
be macho, sensitive, repressed — whatev
er it takes to get a date.

Dear brothers,
CAN WE talk? It's that time of year.
Leaves fall, daytime shrinks, the
night air gets even colder and our
thoughts turn to indoor sports. Like a full
dose of GHB steroids in a trendy L.A.
nightclub, the season has a strange effect
on our minds and bodies. Thoughts of
poetry dance through our heads as we
romanticize a three-letter word into a
four-letter one: L-O-V-E. Big mistake.
Welcome to the next level.
Say it. Say it. "To hell with love."
There now, don't you all feel better? It
may be tough for us to admit, but the
most recent person to say it best was an
XX. Annie Ross' tough cookie in Robert
Altman's "Short Cuts" sang it loud and
sang it proud, "To hell with love," growl
ing as though her life depended on it.
Before her, in Spike Lee's "Mo' Better
Blues," Denzel Washington scatted,
"What the world needs now ... is not
another love song."
It's all true.
The other 51 percent has had us on the
ropes for years now, and they're closing

in for the kill. First, they wanted a man's
man. Gary Cooper, Rock Hudson, Clint
Eastwood — someone who would make
their day. Someone who could take out
four bad guys without breaking a sweat
or dropping their cigarettes. Someone
who would rather die than let a single
tear drop from their eyes. So we did that.
Then they wanted a woman's man.
Bill Cosby, Richard Dreyfuss, Alan Alda
— someone who would ask them how
their day went and really mean it. Some
one who would convince the four bad
guys to put down their guns and get in
touch with their inner children. Someone
who would cry every day just to show how
sensitive they were. And we did that too.
Now they want repression. Anthony
Hopkins. Daniel-Day Lewis. Tom Hanks.
Someone who would never ask them how
their day was because that would be a
pornographic breach of form ("Remains
of the Day"). Someone who will pine over
them for a lifetime but never make a
move until it's much too late ("The Age of
Innocence"). Someone who lives clear
across the country and moons over his

dead wife — without ever crying — forc
ing them do all the work to even get to
meet him ("Sleepless in Seattle").
I'm gonna hurl.
Goodfellas, we only have ourselves to
blame. Martin Scorsese got away from
that violent, Italian thing and turned his
back on the balls-out world of "Raging
Bull" and "Cape Fear" to write and direct
the drawing-room tangos of "The Age of
Innocence." Kazuo Ishiguro wrote the
novel "Remains of the Day," which was
produced and directed by the dynamic
duo of James Ivory and Ismail Merchant.
Hold the gender gap, though. Women
are eating this stuff up by the pound.
They walk out of the theater, eyes misted
over, wondering where they can find a
man that they can't call their own.
On the surface, it doesn't make much
sense that women would go for it. How
many of you would keep Michelle Pfeif
fer, Emma Thompson or Meg Ryan at
arm'B length for even the two-hour run
ning time of an average movie? That's
male fantasy at its finest — a man with
the almost effortless strength to resist

the last temptation of western cinema's
icons of beauty.
Fear of commitment has become a
virtue — with women as its foremost
admirers, and our fellow men are bent on
selling us out with this ice-king persona.
Where can we turn? Does anyone have
the courage to wipe this neo-Victorian
sensibility off the silver screen?
It's time for us to bite the bullet and
sleep with the enemy.
Yes, the best man for the job is a
woman. Jane Campion's latest film, "The
Piano," shatters the stereotypes of
repressed men and women at the turn of
the century. True, the film is a period
piece. But the Merchant-Ivory sense of
propriety is thrown out the window,
replaced by volatile emotions — fear,
lust, jealousy — in '90s doses.
The skinny? A newlywed woman
allows another man to take increasing
liberties with her to get back her prized
piano. I know, I know. You're thinking
"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down," pr the origi
nal "Beauty and the Beast" before Disney
got their revisionist paws on it.

But it's actually a whole new world.
Campion's poetic brand of feminism spins
a tale that champions passion and hon
esty over repression and self-delusion —
an antidote to our age of faux innocence.
The Hopkins' and Day-Lewis' of the
world would leave "The Piano" scratch
ing their heads. So don't fall for the new
standard in guy fare, no matter how
much women's hearts flutter at the sight
of these inaction heroes. "The Piano" is
about to sound in full fanfare mode, sig
naling that the cineplex — or at least the
art house — is once again a safe haven for
love. Play it again, Jane.
Fool for love,
