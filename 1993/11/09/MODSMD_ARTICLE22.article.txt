## Garrard keeps goal and goals well in sight for Cardinal 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
As the starting goalkeeper for
the second-ranked Stanford wo
men's soccer team, Leslie Garrard
has become as adept at achieving
her goals as she is at stopping her
opponents from scoring any.
Satisfying her need for person
al glory and national-caliber expe
rience before coming to Stanford,
Garrard now has focused her
attention on team achievements.
"I reached all my goals, basical
ly, when I came to Stanford,"
Garrard said. "I just want to be
good for Stanford. If we can win
the national championship, that
means so much more for so many
people than for me to play on a
national team."
Growing up in the soccer-rich
Dallas community, Garrard start
ed playing soccer in the first
grade. After her mother began
coaching, Garrard progressed
through the youth leagues quick
ly, settling in at goalkeeper at the
under-12 level.
"Dallas is really big in youth
soccer, so I started playing on club
programs because not much goes
on in high school," Garrard said.
"At the under-14 and under-16
level, I started getting involved in
the Olympic Development pro
gram. I started to take it pretty
seriously at under-16, and I want
ed to play in college."
Playing in Bulgaria with the
youth national team during her
senior year of high school and at
the Olympic Festival the summer
before starting at Stanford gave
her the experience needed to
move on to the next level. Garrard
put aside any desires for individu
al honors, focusing her attention
on the team goal of a national
championship.

Starting as a redshirt fresh
man in 1991, Garrard has defi
nitely amassed an impressive
record over the course of her Car
dinal career. In her three years of
tending the net, Stanford is a
combined 50-6-2. Starting 54 of
the 58 contests over this span, she
has only allowed 24 goals for an
astounding 0.44 goals-against
average. In that span, she has had
a major hand in 37 shutouts.
"My strength is that I'm a
shot-stopper — anticipating and
diving for shots," Garrard said.
"I'm pretty intense in those five
seconds before the shot."
Although Garrard anchors a
very strong Cardinal v'efense, she
is the first player to praise the
contributions of back-line players
such as Jessica Fischer, Melinda
Minstrell and Suzie Boots.
"It makes my job so much eas
ier," she said. "People see all my
shutouts, but a lot of it is just they
stop the ball before it gets to my
hands. So many goals are prevent
ed because they stop a crossing
pass or a one-on-one situation."
Head coach lan Sawyers has
been very impressed with the
team's defensive play this year,
especially Garrard's increasing
acceptance of a leadership role.
"For a team to be great, you
need a strong spine down the cen
tral part of the field," Sawyers
said. "You can't play at a top level
without a top keeper, and Leslie
fills that role for us. She's is in a
position where she's a leader for
our team, and she's done a great
job by leading by example and by
becoming more vocal this year."
An English mqjor working on a
thesis in the Humanities honors
program on French symbolist
poetry, Garrard is also involved in
the Feminist Studies program
and is thinking about law school

in the future. Despite needing
very few classes to graduate this
year, Garrard plans to return
next season for her final year of
eligibility as a fifth-year senior.
"I like being a student-athlete,"
Garrard said. "It keeps me sane,
because you have two insane things
and somehow, they keep you sane. I'm
really enjoying my thesis — it's very
therapeutic."
Like her perspective on educa
tion, Garrard's intense mentality
helps her concentrate, even when
the ball is at the other end of the
field for extended periods of time.
"There's a big difference
between goalkeeper mentality
and what I call forward mentali
ty," Garrard said. "When you're
playing keeper, you're either the
hero or the scapegoat. It takes a
lot of experience to deal with that.
"It's also harder to be a team play
er, because when you see the other
team coming down, I need to be in
tune with my defense and telling them
what to do, but basically I'm being
totally selfish and taking care of what's
going on in my head and getting set to
receive the shot"
Another advantage Garrard
has over other players is her love
of confrontation. As are many
other team members, Minstrell is
impressed by the demeanor Gar
rard brings to the field.
"I could never do the type of
stuff she does," Minstrell said.
"She physically and mentally
dominates the game. Nothing
gets past her. She's intimidating
for other teams, especially when
she comes up with a great save.
We're confident that she'll stop
any shot that gets past us."
For Garrard, however, psych
ing herself up on a breakaway is
one of the moments she looks for
ward to most.
"It's like the big paradox being

a keeper," Garrard said. "You've
got to love it when the other team
is coming down the field on a
breakaway, because if you don't,
it's not fun playing."
With her shutout total creep
ing to 15 after last Thursday's 2-0
win over Santa Clara, Garrard
has drawn praise from numerous
people outside of the realm of
Stanford soccer.
"Leslie's a tremendous keep
er," said Santa Clara coach Jerry

Smith. "The secret to goalkeeping
is to make it look easy, and she's
very good at that. She commands
the penalty box very well, and she
has no real weaknesses. I think
there are some awesome games
left in her."
Despite such a successful sea
son under her belt, Garrard
remains a few steps away from
achieving the only goal she
brought to Stanford four years
ago — a national championship.

"When we played North Car
olina earlier this year in the
Houston tournament, we realized
that weekend that the stigma of
UNC and the stigma of the
national championship being
unreachable was completely bro
ken," Garrard said. "The idea
that, wow, this is college soccer,
this big tournament and you're
signing autographs for these little
kids. Playing college soccer is a
great feeling."
