## Thomas survives a field of 86, wins Rolex Tourney 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
What a difference a year makes.
Last year, Jim Thomas was a freshman trying to
crack into the starting lineup of Stanford's men's
tennis team.
Yesterday he was crowned singles champion of
the Rolex Northern California Men's Intercollegiate
Tournament. It's a safe bet that he'll be starting for
this year's squad.
After three days and six rounds of matches at the
Stanford Tennis Stadium, all that remained of the
field of 86 top collegiate players were two sopho
mores: Thomas and California's Casey Louie.
In a well-played finale, Thomas' volleying ability
prevailed over the speed and grit of Louie, 6-3, 6-4.
The soft-spoken Cardinal from Canton, Ohio
said, "The key was that I put away the balls when I
had to, because Louie was so fast. When I didn't, he
was all over them.
"Louie beat me the last time we played [at under
-18 nationals!, so it was nice to beat him here in front
of all the Stanford fans," Thomas said.
Down 2-3 in the second set, Thomas broke his
opponent after having played out four deuces. Louie
then returned the favor to go up 4-3, but Thomas
broke back twice to close out the match.
Both Thomas and Louie had been seeded among
the tournament's top 16 players, and each had
scored notable upsets to reach the final round.
In the semifinals, Thomas defeated his teammate
and the No. 2 seed, Vimal Patel, and Louie took out

the tourney's highly regarded No. 1 seed, Brandon
Coupe of San Jose State.
Ironically, Louie was nearly upset in the second
round by Stanford sophomore Robert Franklin. At
one point, Franklin was up 7-5, 5-4 and was serving
for the match. Louie, however, managed to score 12
straight points and close out the match 5-7, 7-5, 6-4.
"I'm really proud of Jim," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould, adding that Thomas "worked
harder than anyone else on the team this summer —
and they all worked hard."
Thomas attributes much of his success to a four
week summer tour of the French Tennis Circuit
that he took along with teammate Ricky Becker.
"It allowed me to play a lot of matches against a
lot of different (French) players," Thomas said. "We
learned to adapt to crazy situations on and off the
court, mostly created by the language and culture
barriers."
Thomas' victory now qualifies him to compete in
the Rolex Indoor Championships Feb. 3-6 in Dallas.
Stanford netters also captured the tournament's
doubles title, giving the Cardinal a clean sweep of
the event.
The team of Patel and Jeff Salzenstein fought off
Washington's Mark Tomandl and Ornello Arlati in
the semifinals, 2-6, 6-3, 6-2. Then, in the finals, they
defeated the Cal tandem of Dan Hiddleson and
David Melmed, 6-3, 7-6.
"Our young guvs played really well in this tour
nament," Gould said. "Thomas, Salzenstein, Beck
er, (Grant) Elliot and Franklin all pulled out some
big matches."
