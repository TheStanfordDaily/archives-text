# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
During a less-than-stellar week for athletics
on the Farm, two Stanford teams continue to
fly high with renewed hopes of NCAA glory and
a slice of national championship pie.
First, the red-hot water polo squad set
Southern California ablaze with its weekend
victories over USC and UCLA.
Not too far behind was the women's soccer
squad, which spent the weekend prepping for
the Western Regional finals afler it white

washed Santa Clara, 2-0, last Thursday.
At the helm of these Cardinal successes
stand veteran All-Americans I>arry Bercutt and
Sarah Rafanelli. Both athletes are more than
worthy of note, as they will lead their respective
teams into league finals this weekend.
After coming in second to California in the
NCAA Tournament for two consecutive years, the
Cardinal water polo team hopes to vault into the
winners' circle this season, with the help of senior
Bercutt in the keeper position. Over the weekend,
Bercutt preserved both Stanford victories with a
15-save performance against UCLA and a 10-save
display against USC.
Always a stabilizing force on defense,
Bercutt has tallied 163 rejections in the goal
this season, compared to his Ail-American total
of 181 saves a year ago. Entering this week
end's Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
finals, the top-ranked Cardinal will rely heavily
upon their all-star keeper in order to stave off
the attacks of No. 2 USC and No. 3 Cal.

Who woulda thunk it? Afler Julie Foudy
graduated last year, Stanford has found anoth
er All-Universe selection in senior Sarah
Rafanelli. Undoubtedly one of the best soccer
players in the nation, Rafanelli has racked up a
team-high 18 goals to go along with her eight
assists this year.
Going into Stanford's final game of the sea
son last Thursday, the Cardinal needed a victo
ry to secure home-field advantage and the top
spot in the West. Rafanelli answered by single

handed'y demolishing tHe Broncos in a display
of offensive mastery. Baffling the Bronco
defenders, the Piedmont, Calif., native rifled in
two goals to seal Santa Clara's fate.
Rafanelli has terrorized Cardinal opponents
with her scoring prowess for four years. In her
previous threo seasons, the 1992 All-American
scored a total of 39 goals and accumulated 26
assists.
