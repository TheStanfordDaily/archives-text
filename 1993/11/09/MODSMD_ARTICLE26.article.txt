# Seaquest: the tale of Cardinal lifeguards
## 
### 
Commodore Longfellow ne
ver envisioned it like this.
A Red Cross pioneer, the
Commodore spent much of the
first half of the 20th century
living up to his self-stated mis
sion of "waterproofing Ameri
ca." He traveled across the
country organizing swimming
clinics and demonstrations,
teaching standard lifesaving
methods and increasing gener
al water-safety awareness.
Today, the Commodore's troops
number in the tens of thousands,
and lifeguards
across the na-

tion follow the
guidelines he
devised decades
ago.
Lifeguards
begin their ca
reers at you
nger ages as
well, someti
mes as early as
15 or 16. Be-

cause of this, each incoming
freshman class brings dozens,
perhaps hundreds of experi
enced guards onto the Farm.
These men and women reek
of lifeguarding experience.
They bubble with knowledge of
death-defying wave tanks, jelly
fish-infested ocean beaches and
urine-infested community po
ols. They ache for tastes of life
guarding action at Stanford.
At the pools on campus, they
encounter aspects of lifeguard
ing completely different from
anything previous experience
might have led them to expect.
Indeed, lifeguarding is a pas
sive rather than an active job at
Stanford. Guards don't wear
whistles; many don't even wear
bathing suits. There are only
two guard chairs at deGuerre, a
10-lane, 50-meter pool; Stan
ford's smaller pool, Roble, is
watched by one lifeguard.
"It's a cushy job, as far as
lifeguarding goes," said anoth
er deGuerre employee. "Cover
ing the pool is usually the only
time we break a sweat."
And why should the job be
any different? There are no
screaming kids at Stanford's
two recreational pools. In fact,
there are hardly ever any kids
at all at the pools.
The pools themselves would
fulfill a highway planner's wet
dreams. Lanes are conveniently
labeled "slow," "medium" and
"fast." Swimmers swim on the
right and pass on the left. It's
only a matter of time before the
kickboards have seatbelts.
From a safety perspective, the

statistics at the two pools are
impressive. "Most municipal pools
and waterparks average a handful
of spinal injuries every season," said
another Stanford guard. "To my
knowledge, we've only had one res
cue here in the last three years."
One rescue in three years?
Estimating the total number of
daily lifeguard work hours at
50, we get a ratio of one save
per 18,000 hours of lifeguard
duty.
"I've only gone in the pool once
while I was working," said one
guard. What
dire emergen-

cy caused him
to enter the
water? "I was
hot, I think. I
just dove in
and swam."
But if
Stanford's
lifeguards
lack water-

rescue expe
rience, they make up for it in
observational experience.
"I can look at you when you
walk into this place and know if
I should keep an eye on you or
not," said one guard. "Most of
the times, the answer is no."
Especially at this point in the
year, when the air temperature is
often lower than the water temper
ature. Both pools remain open all
year and in all types of weather,
save lightning.
In the winter months, recre
ational swimming takes on an
entirely different meaning —
people swim, come rain, hail or
(four winters ago) snow.
Which only naturally leads
guards to exhibit a certain dis
dain for swimmers who don't
match such ultra-dedicated
patterns.
"I can't watch the slow lanes
— they make me ill," said a
guard who currently splits his
time between Roble and
deGuerre. "It amazes me that
some people can make it to this
point in their lives and not
know how to swim."
But if words like these cause
the old Commodore to turn in
his grave, his spirit lives on.
Lifeguards at Stanford provide
minimal standards of safety at
the school's two recreational
pools, resorting to as little per
sonal interference as possible.
Or perhaps the interference
is more subtle. "There's a fine
line between floating and
drowning," said a first-year
guard. "I just help people figure
out which side of the line
they're on."
