# Cardinal sails to victory in Stanford Invitational
## 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
Though the winds were light at the Red
wood City Sailing Complex this weekend,
the No. 9 Stanford sailing team still
breezed to victory in the Stanford Invita
tional, the only home regatta of the fall sea
son.
"Overall, we really dominated," said
first-year coach Steve Bourdow. "It was a
marginally competitive regatta."
Eight California schools sent a total of
21 teams to the competition, which consist
ed of 12 races. Of these teams, seven were
from Stanford.
Overall, the Stanford teams placed first,
second, fourth, fifth, sixth, 10th and 12th.
Besides Stanford, only USC sported a team
able to sneak into the top six in the overall
standings.
The Stanford Invitational featured two
dinghy divisions, in which skipper-crew
combos raced against each other; unlike
some other regattas, there were no single
hand races. In division A, Stanford posted
four of the top five teams. Stanford's top
skipper, Scott Sellers, and Katherine Chen
were the winners of this division, followed
by teammates Charles Meade and Letitia
Yang. Stanford also had teams placing
fourth, fifth, seventh and eighth in the divi
sion.
In the B division, Stanford was even
more dominant. Cardinal sailors registered
the top four times, paced by Jeremy Mcln
tyre and Don Chennavasin. The women's
team of skipper Gretchen Uznis and Sibyl
Diver placed second. Stanford teams also
finished eighth and 12th in division B.
The Cardinal's impressive perfor

mance was encouraging even though it
did not come against Stanford's potential
ly most challenging competition. Califor
nia, which beat Stanford in the Stoney
Burke Intersectional Oct. 9, did not send
its most-skilled sailors to the regatta.
Consequently, they placed well out of the
running.
Nevertheless, Bourdow said that Stan
ford would have won even if Cal had
brought its full squad. "At Stoney Burke,
we should have beat Berkeley, but we
didn't. (This weekend), Berkeley didn't
send their absolute best guys, but we would
have destroyed them anyway."
The absence of other schools besides
California also helped make the Stanford
Invitational only a "marginally competi
tive" meet. "A lot of people don't like to sail
at Redwood Shore," said Bourdow. "Still,
all of the best teams lon the West Coast!
were there except for Hawaii."
The Rainbows, however, leave a huge
shadow. Hawaii boasts the best collegiate
sailing team in the Western region and the
third best in the nation. In earlier regattas
this season, Hawaii's top sailors have car
ried them to victories over a deeper, bal
anced Stanford squad, generally regarded
to be Hawaii's chief competitor in the
region.
The Cardinal will face the Rainbows this
weekend in the fall season's most impor
tant event, the North/South Intersectional
at San Luis Obispo. Along with Hawaii,
nearly all of the district's top teams will be
there.
Bourdow is optimistic that Stanford will
cruise to victory. "The team is really
pumped. I'm pumped for it, and they are
too. It's definitely a big one."
