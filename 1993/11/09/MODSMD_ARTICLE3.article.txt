# Salamander as mascot?
## Students suggest 'Blazing Salamanders' for Stanford's new merchandising tool 
### Charles Katz Staff writer 
If members of the California
Tiger Salamander Research and
Rescue Project have their way, the
black and yellow colors of the tiger
salamander will adorn the Stan
ford crest in the future.
In an effort to preserve and pro
mote pride in the endangered am
phibian, the rescue project is try
ing to build grass-roots support
for the salamanders, said first
year graduate student Jamie
Reaser, the project's assistant di

rector.
"The Stanford Blazing Sala
manders" would be a perfect mas
cot for Stanford, Reasersaid. "The
tiger salamander can choke down
a banana slug [UC-Santa Cruz's
mascot) in no time flat — and can
you imagine a slogan like 'Slime
Cal?' "
Noting the Stanford Commit
tee on Licensing and Marketing's
past efforts to find a new mascot to
bolster merchandise sales, Reaser
suggested that the salamander
would be very marketable.
"Right now in the Bookstore,
there are no cute and cuddlies. With
a mascot like the salamander, dolls
and merchandise could be sold. It's
a lot better than an 'S.' "
Besides, if the decision were
made on a purely marketable basis,
"the new name of the school [mas
cot] would be the Stanford Cabbage
Patch Kids," Reaser said.
The salamanders reached their

zenith in popularity after their
endangered status caused the Axe
Committee to cancel the annual Big
Game Bonfire held in Lake Lagunita.
Reaser said that in some ancient
cultures the salamander was
thought to bring fire, so it is ironic
that the salamander has contributed
the demise of the Bonfire. "The sala
mander has been around for over a
million years in the area," she added.
"The cardinal color has been around
Stanford for less than a century."
Currently, there is no actual
organization championing the effort
to change the mascot. The project is
hoping that some student organiza

tion will take up the cause. Right
now, the project is only trying to
build support in order to make it
easier to raise funds for their con
servation efforts, said Reaser.
However, not all students are
convinced about the mascot-change
drive. Sophomore Charles Goodan
111, the Stanford Tree, said he would
have to seriously think about
whether he would dress up in a tiger
salamander suit. Goodan explained
that "a tree is one thing, but a sala
mander is something completely dif
ferent."
"Stanford University has already
changed its mascot once too often. If

it ever does again, it certainly
shouldn't pick a slimy, little bug
eyed lizard," Goodan said.
Stanford's official mascot is the
cardinal color, while the tree is only
the mascot for the Band. Reaser
explained that a salamander cos
tume would allow the mascot to per
form many more entertaining
cheers than the tree costume per
mits.
To that end, Reaser and her pro
ject have already envisioned some
thing special for the future. "Just
imagine a six-foot salamander with
a bucket of slime chasing the Cal
Bear. It's coming."
