# Rocky start for new student commission
## Optimistic leaders plead for patience 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
At an organizational meeting last night,
members of a student advisory group strug
gled to define their role in the University's
current review of undergraduate educa
tion.
After a lengthy and often-spirited dis
cussion, the Student Advisory Group on
Undergraduate Education was unable to
agree just how it will operate. However,
ASSU-appointed co-chairs Eddie Garcia
and Ying-Ying Goh, along with junior Luz
Herrera, the undergraduate student repre
sentative on the Commission on Under
graduate Education, promised to present a
statement of the advisory group's purpose
and function at next week's meeting.

"Please be patient with us," pleaded
Garcia, as the approximately 25 students
who attended the meeting adjourned.
Group members also expressed frustra
tion at the lack of student representation
on the commission.
The group was formed in October by the
Council of Presidents, who were concerned
that only two students would participate in
the commission's discussions. The group
received University President Gerhard
Casper's endorsement at an ASSU Senate
meeting two weeks ago, and also received
$1,300 in funding from the University com
mission.
Last night's meeting was marked by
the advisory group's debate over what its
relationship with the commission
should be and how it could influ
ence the current process of under
graduate education reform.
Herrera stated at the begin
ning of the meeting that she saw
the group as a forum for her, as a
student representative, to gather
a wider range of student opinions
and "get more ideas generated
into the discussion" of the com
mission.
Other members of the group
suggested additional ways the
group can represent students,
either by providing information
or quantitatively analyzing stu
dent opinion.
However, many expressed
ambivalence about how much
impact they can really have on the
final product of the commission,
which will issue a preliminary
report in the spring.
Sophomore Michael Choo
said he is concerned that the
process includes "many loop
holes" that allow students' opin
ions to be expressed, but not
implemented.
Some members of the group
complained bitterly about the
lack of student representation on

the commission, while others
questioned whether the group
was pre-disposing itself against
the commission before its find
ings were even close to being
released.
Choo said student representa
tives on the commission cannot
provide any more than "token"
representation for the Universi
ty's diverse student body. Choo
said he agreed with commission
member, graduate student David
Lowell, who has said he is "not
pretending to represent stu
dents." Lowell was not present at
the meeting last night.
The group also struggled with
its agenda and membership at the
meeting. "The advisory group is
anyone who's interested in these
issues," Garcia said.
Goh also defended their initial
policy of allowing anyone who
comes to the meetings to be con
sidered a member of the group.
"The commitment is personal,"
she said. "We're not excluding
anyone."
Other members of the group
said they felt that membership
needed to be limited. Also, in
order to make the group represen
tative of the Stanford community,
some students suggested that
each voluntary student organiza
tion send a representative to
group meetings.

Goh and Garcia called the
meeting a success despite the
irresolution. Goh said she was
"optimistic" because "that [type
of discussion] is going to be the
driving force of this group."
"I didn't anticipate the intelli
gence of this group," Garcia said.
"I thought it was clear what we
were doing, but it obviously
wasn't."
At the meeting, Garcia and
Goh proposed creating an officer
position to coordinate residential
programs. "We want to tap into
Residential Education as much
as we can," Garcia said, arguing
that dorm programming would
be the best way to get student
input.
Some students discussed the
possibility of forming another
group to allow a different level of
student involvement in the pro
cess.
Herrera and other advisory
group members stressed the vari
ety of ways in which students can
affect the process. "Most of the
commission members are very
open to student opinion," she
said.
However, Herrera admitted
that the powers of the commis
sion were limited, saying, "The
changes that are going to be made
are going to be made by the presi
dent and the provost."
