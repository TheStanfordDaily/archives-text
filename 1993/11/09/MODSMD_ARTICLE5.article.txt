# Student groups suffer from fee-refund drive
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
The results of this quarter's ASSU spe
cial-fee refunds are in — and student
groups are surveying the damage.
An average of 9.4 percent was axed
from each group's fall quarter budget
after a 71 percent jump in fee-refund
rates.
While some student groups, such as the
SPOON hunger-relief network, were
spared from major cuts with only a 5.9
percent budget reduction, other groups
will lose as much as 14 percent of their
budgets.
According to ASSU Financial Manag
er Brian Hillger, in past years the refund
rate has increased throughout the
school year since more students usually
request refunds in winter and spring
quarters.
"It's not something that students will
see over the short term," said Jason
Colton, business manager of KZSU, which
will lose 11.9 percent, or $3,096.
"IThe loss is] stuff like equipment that
can't be replaced — students don't neces
sarily see the scars," he said, adding that

the station was planning to buy a new
transmitter to replace the 20-year-old one
it now uses.
KZSU "may have to investigate other
sources of funding," said Colton, adding
that because the station is non-commer
cial, it is prohibited by law from selling ad
vertising.
While the refund rate varied for each
organization, most student groups will be
forced to trim their budgets this quarter,
as well as locate new sources of funding.
"We've taken a lot of financial blows in
stride. . . . This will just be another set
back," said junior Charles Nickel, a mem
ber of the Stanford Solar Car Project,
which lost 10.4 percent of its expected
funds.
"It sure would be nice if you could
count on that money when the ASSU says
it's going to give it to you," added junior
Jason Garoutte, another member of the
solar car project. .
But despite the setbacks posed by this
loss of funding, student groups say they
will try to make things work and carry out
their projects in the best way possible.
"Our fellowship program is
really a priority," said senior
Marney Cheek, director of Stan
ford-in-Government. "We're
going to try and make sure [the
refunds! don't harm those pro
grams in any way."
Though her group stands to
lose 13.4 percent, $1,438, of its
budget, members plan "to try
and work around that," she said.
But "it definitely does make it
tight for us," she added.
However, like most groups,
SIG has not been able to assess
the damage because it has not
yet had time to revise its budget
figures for fall quarter. "We
haven't made any definitive deci
sions yet," said Cheek, adding
that the group will make cuts
only after carefully considering
its budget.
According to Hillger, in many

cases the refunds will result in
across-the-board cuts in stu
dent-group budgets. However,
the ASSU is "willing to work
with organizations to make
their budgets work as well as
possible."
The special-fee refund rate
rose largely as a result of a drive
by graduate students to request
refunds in protest of ASSU poli
cies.
Approximately 75 percent of
the money refunded this quarter
came from graduate student
refunds.
In addition, 50 percent of the
people who requested refunds
did so indiscriminately —
refunding all groups rather than
choosing which groups to
refund.
"I think a lot of people tend to
vote for groups and then take the
refund," said Garoutte, echoing
the perspective of many campus
groups. "I've heard some talk of
election reform and maybe that's
a good idea."
