# Tresidder finalizes plans for Taco Bell
## 
### Beth Berselli 
As students eagerly await Taco Bell's arrival
on campus with meal cards in hand, Tresidder
Union Assoc. Director Paul Szczesiul says
plans for the franchise are well under way.
Currently, an in-house architect at Taco
Bell is drawing up the blueprint for the mini
restaurant, which will replace the front desk at
the Recreation Center. The first draft of the

plans should be completed this week, Szczesiul
said.
According to Tresidder Director Bobbi
Braden, the renovation should cost no more
than $70,000. This money will come from
Tresidder's reserve fund. "We've been saving
money over the years to do projects like this
one," Szczesiul said.
Actual construction will probably begin in
early December, probably during Dead Week,

Szczesiul said. "Most of the work will be done
over break. It will be about a month's con
struction time," Szczesiul said.
Once the Taco Bell opens, it will stay open
"later than any other food services in Tresid
der," said Szczesiul, explaining that the restau
rant's hours will probably be from 11 a.m. to 1
or 2 a.m. The restaurant will offer a limited
menu, but prices will be about the
same as those at regular Taco Bell
franchises.
In addition, the on-campus
Taco Bell will accept Tresidder
dollars.
The restaurant's opening date
will depend on various factors,
including obtaining the necessary
approvals from the University
and from Santa Clara County
Health and Building Depart
ments. The franchise must meet
the county health codes, and a
building permit must be issued
before renovation can begin.
Tresidder is hoping to submit
the request for the building per
mit, complete with architectural
plans for the new restaurant, in a
couple of weeks, Szczesiul said.
Szczesiul said the planning
process "can get held up at any
spot along the way. If we review
and begin construction on sched
ule, we'll be very happy." Szcze
siul added that the location on the
ground floor of Tresidder will
make the franchise "visible and
accessible."
Facilities' project management
department must verify that the
planned Taco Bell complies with
the American with Disabilities
Act and provides access for cus
tomers with disabilities.
"We may have to do some work
upgrading the restrooms so that
they meet the standards of the
[act]," Szczesiul said. "Once you

start construction everything has
to come up to compliance stan
dards."
In addition, the plumbing,
heating, air conditioning, electri
cal systems and asbestos level
need to meet Facilities' stan
dards. The University fire mar
shal also has to verify that the fire
codes are met.
Bon Appetit, the San Francis
co-based company that runs food
operations in Tresidder, will own
and manage the franchise after
signing a licensing agreement
with Taco Bell in mid-September.
Bon Appetit will hire 10-15 stu
dent employees in December.
Bon Appetit and the Tresidder
staff initiated the plan to open a
Taco Bell on campus. Mary
Edmonds, vice provost for stu
dent affairs, approved the plan.
"Taco Bell is very popular on
college campuses across the coun
try," Szczesiul said. "It is the stu
dents' food of choice."
It is also "an efficient opera
tion," requiring less equipment
and kitchen space than other
restaurants, Szczesiul said. The
"operating area" itself will be
500-600 square feet.
As the Taco Bell plans are
being finalized, the Tresidder
staff is exploring more ways to
increase student eating options,
primarily by contracting a nation
al pizza delivery company to
accept Tresidder dollars.
According to Szczesiul, "It is
very likely that this will happen.
We'll be announcing it in the next
few weeks, and it would be imple
mented Dec. 1."
