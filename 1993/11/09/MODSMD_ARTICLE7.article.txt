# What about 'Bob'?
## Robert Moore gets new name 
### Gina Lee 
Just like their neighbors down the block in
Xanadu, the residents of Robert S. Moore South have
voted to change their name — to "Bob."
Residents of the house, which previously was the
American Studies House, were given the option by
the University of choosing a new name this year.
The 49 students unanimously voted in a house
meeting to hold a contest to come up with a new
name. For two and a half weeks, suggestions were
written by students on the door of Christian Chabot,
the resident advisor.
"We decided to change the name because everyone
was severely truncating the name anyway, and the
different names, such as 'Bobby' and 'RoMoSo', were
getting annoying," Chabot said.
When the sign-up sheet for names on the door was
full, Chabot compiled the suggestions — which num
bered more than 100 — on a computer and sent a list
to every resident for voting.
"The name change was hotly contested," Resident
Fellow Bud Homsy said. "Students took this very se
riously and names such as 'Casa Bob' were close in
the running."
However, when the votes were
tallied, "Bob" came out the clear
winner. Chabot attributed this
choice to the logical connection to
the building and Stanford stu
dents' love of shortening names.
Even before the contest was over,
some students were referring to

their home as Bob.
Some students, though, were
not as pleased with the decision.
"I would have preferred Chaos,
but Bob is OK," resident Robbie
Becker said.
Chabot submitted a two-page
essay to the Office of Residential
Education outlining the rationale
behind the switch.
Chabot said that the name
became official about a week and a
half ago when the petition was
approved by Res Ed.
