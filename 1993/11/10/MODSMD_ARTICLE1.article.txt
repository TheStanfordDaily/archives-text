# University to cut an additional $20M from budget
## Administration to be hit hardest; 'weak' academic areas could be eliminated 
### Skip Schwartz Senior staff writer 
In its continuing struggle to get back
into the black, the University will slash
another $18 million to $20 million from
its administrative and academic areas
over the next three years in a plan de

signed by Provost Condoleezza Rice.
The reductions will be made by cutting
central administrative costs by 15 percent
to 30 percent by fiscal year 1997 and elim
inating some weak academic areas, ac
cording to the provost's annual budget
letter sent this week to deans and vice
presidents.

Academic areas were not given specific
cutting targets, but they are being asked
to re-evaluate their priorities and reorga
nize their administrative structure, Rice
said in an interview Monday.
Rice said the cuts are designed to elim
inate the University's ongoing budget
deficits and provide funding for innova
tive academic programs.
The University is projecting a $20 mil
lion deficit for next year, Rice said. A $10
million shortfall in fiscal year 1994-95 had
been predicted in last year's budget plan
ning, but that figure has increased pri

marily due to deferred maintenance costs
and the continuing reduced indirect-cost
rate.
Because the cuts are intended to guar
antee the long-term financial stability of
the University rather than respond to the
immediate financial setbacks of two years
ago, Rice said she does not believe there is
a need for the broad, community-wide
consultation that took place during the
$43 million deficit-reduction process in
1991-92.
Although extensive input will be so
licited in the coming months, Rice said de

cisions on the new round of cuts will be
made by top University administrators.
Administrative cuts
While eventual reductions will have to
come from both administrative and acad
emic areas within the University, Rice
said that next year's cuts will come pri
marily from the central administrative
units, which took the most drastic cuts in
the last two rounds of budget cutting.
These areas will be asked to prepare
budgets based on a reduction of 5
percent to 10 percent per year for
each of the next three years, Rice
said. She added that she hopes to
reduced administrative costs by $5
million next year.
Rice declined to specify if a
majority of these cuts will come in
the form of layoffs, saying only that
"attrition, retraining and re-deploy
ment are all obviously preferable."
Academic cuts
Rice said she gave no specific
guidelines to academic units, only
asking "the deans, departments
and faculty to take an honest look
at themselves" in determining the
most efficient way to run their
departments.
Acknowledging that there is
"not much more fat to trim," Rice
said different departments never
theless have to take steps to con
tribute to the long-term financial
stability of the University.
She said she is relying "on the good
faith" of the deans to take serious
looks at specific programs within and
across departments and see if they are
"as strong as they can possibly be."
While she believes programs
should not be cut just for having
"temporary weaknesses," Rice said
that the University "cannot contin
ue to invest in everything.... If we

continue a program and it is not
strong, we have to ask ourselves
why we do it."
She declined to give specifics as
to potential academic cuts, saying
that she does "not believe in cen
tralized planning."
Dean of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences John Shoven said
he is "very supportive of the idea of
developing a plan to try to figure
out our strengths and weaknesses."
Shoven says he hopes that those
within the school view the new plan,
"not as retrenchment" but as an
opportunity to take advantage of
opportunities and grow within the
department.
In planning these cuts, the
departments will have to keep in
mind that the new budgets will be
now be "revenue-driven" rather
than "cost-driven," meaning they
will be based on each unit's expect
ed revenue, and not its expected
need, as in the past.
The previous cost-driven
method placed too much pressure
on the University to find ways to
increase revenue, said Budget
Director Tim Warner.
The University "used to look at
the expenditure side and how it had
grown and then scrambled to find
revenue to match this," Warner
said. This has turned into a prob
lem since restricted giving has
risen faster than unrestricted giv
ing, while "unrestricted expendi
tures are exceeding unrestricted
revenue," he said. (See related

story.)
Another of the plan's long-term
goals is to increase the amount of
money set aside in the budget for
innovation, Rice said. The current
$2 million represents only 0.5 per
cent of the overall budget.
Rice said she also wants to see
increased investment in the Uni
versity's infrastructure, especially
for modernizing laboratories, class
rooms and computer technology.
A different process
In contrast to the University's
current $43-million deficit-reduc
tion plan, Rice said the new plan is
"not crisis budget cutting ... fbut]
looking for long-run management."
She said she wants "the commu
nity to be calm about it. Let's not
assume that we're spinning up
again for another big budget-cut
ting exercise.
"We need to think of it as a nor
mal management process— where
revenue is not keeping pace with
expenditure," she said.
The University went through its
first round of budget cuts in 1990,
when then-Provost James Rosse
announced a swift $22 million
reduction, called repositioning. But
another $43 million cut was
announced soon after in 1992,
when the government reduced the
University's indirect-cost reim
bursement rate.
The $43 million reduction pro
cess involved broad, community
wide discussions funneled through

the Cabinet Committee on Budget
and Strategic Planning, a "crisis
mobilization" that Rice said served
its purpose by helping the campus
to deal with drastic and immediate
budget cuts.
In addition, the CC-BSP was a
costly committee, especially in
terms of the time spent by all mem
bers of the Stanford community,
Rice said.
This new round of budget cuts
will also involve some campus-wide
input, she said, including meetings
with the ASSU Council of Presi
dents and the Faculty Senate's Pol
icy and Planning Board, an elec
tronic-mail address for comments
(budget.savings@forsythe), and at
least two town hall meetings.
"It's not as if one of us sits here
and has edicts about what to do,"
Rice said, adding that faculty and
student input is especially impor
tant with regard to "the changes of
levels and types of services." How
ever, the upcoming reduction pro
cess still will not engage as large a
coalition as the previous one.
Even though Rice said she fore
sees the additional years of budget
cutting "to be a challenge and diffi
cult," she emphasized that "it is not
impossible."
"I don't think anyone in the fac
ulty really thinks that we can con
tinue to do things the same way,"
Rice said. "If we want the best for a
long-term, creative and innovative
Stanford, we have to make tough
choices."

guidelines to academic units, only
asking "the deans, departments
and faculty to take an honest look
at themselves" in determining the
most efficient way to run their
departments.
Acknowledging that there is
"not much more fat to trim," Rice
said different departments never
theless have to take steps to con
tribute to the long-term financial
stability of the University.
She said she is relying "on the good
faith" of the deans to take serious
looks at specific programs within and
across departments and see if they are
"as strong as they can possibly be."
While she believes programs
should not be cut just for having
"temporary weaknesses," Rice said
that the University "cannot contin
ue to invest in everything.... If we

continue a program and it is not
strong, we have to ask ourselves
why we do it."
She declined to give specifics as
to potential academic cuts, saying
that she does "not believe in cen
tralized planning."
Dean of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences John Shoven said
he is "very supportive of the idea of
developing a plan to try to figure
out our strengths and weaknesses."
Shoven says he hopes that those
within the school view the new plan,
"not as retrenchment" but as an
opportunity to take advantage of
opportunities and grow within the
department.
In planning these cuts, the
departments will have to keep in
mind that the new budgets will be
now be "revenue-driven" rather
than "cost-driven," meaning they
will be based on each unit's expect
ed revenue, and not its expected
need, as in the past.
The previous cost-driven
method placed too much pressure
on the University to find ways to
increase revenue, said Budget
Director Tim Warner.
The University "used to look at
the expenditure side and how it had
grown and then scrambled to find
revenue to match this," Warner
said. This has turned into a prob
lem since restricted giving has
risen faster than unrestricted giv
ing, while "unrestricted expendi
tures are exceeding unrestricted
revenue," he said. (See related

story.)
Another of the plan's long-term
goals is to increase the amount of
money set aside in the budget for
innovation, Rice said. The current
$2 million represents only 0.5 per
cent of the overall budget.
Rice said she also wants to see
increased investment in the Uni
versity's infrastructure, especially
for modernizing laboratories, class
rooms and computer technology.
A different process
In contrast to the University's
current $43-million deficit-reduc
tion plan, Rice said the new plan is
"not crisis budget cutting ... fbut]
looking for long-run management."
She said she wants "the commu
nity to be calm about it. Let's not
assume that we're spinning up
again for another big budget-cut
ting exercise.
"We need to think of it as a nor
mal management process— where
revenue is not keeping pace with
expenditure," she said.
The University went through its
first round of budget cuts in 1990,
when then-Provost James Rosse
announced a swift $22 million
reduction, called repositioning. But
another $43 million cut was
announced soon after in 1992,
when the government reduced the
University's indirect-cost reim
bursement rate.
The $43 million reduction pro
cess involved broad, community
wide discussions funneled through

the Cabinet Committee on Budget
and Strategic Planning, a "crisis
mobilization" that Rice said served
its purpose by helping the campus
to deal with drastic and immediate
budget cuts.
In addition, the CC-BSP was a
costly committee, especially in
terms of the time spent by all mem
bers of the Stanford community,
Rice said.
This new round of budget cuts
will also involve some campus-wide
input, she said, including meetings
with the ASSU Council of Presi
dents and the Faculty Senate's Pol
icy and Planning Board, an elec
tronic-mail address for comments
(budget.savings@forsythe), and at
least two town hall meetings.
"It's not as if one of us sits here
and has edicts about what to do,"
Rice said, adding that faculty and
student input is especially impor
tant with regard to "the changes of
levels and types of services." How
ever, the upcoming reduction pro
cess still will not engage as large a
coalition as the previous one.
Even though Rice said she fore
sees the additional years of budget
cutting "to be a challenge and diffi
cult," she emphasized that "it is not
impossible."
"I don't think anyone in the fac
ulty really thinks that we can con
tinue to do things the same way,"
Rice said. "If we want the best for a
long-term, creative and innovative
Stanford, we have to make tough
choices."
In its continuing struggle to get back
into the black, the University will slash
another $18 million to $20 million from
its administrative and academic areas
over the next three years in a plan de

signed by Provost Condoleezza Rice.
The reductions will be made by cutting
central administrative costs by 15 percent
to 30 percent by fiscal year 1997 and elim
inating some weak academic areas, ac
cording to the provost's annual budget
letter sent this week to deans and vice
presidents.

Academic areas were not given specific
cutting targets, but they are being asked
to re-evaluate their priorities and reorga
nize their administrative structure, Rice
said in an interview Monday.
Rice said the cuts are designed to elim
inate the University's ongoing budget
deficits and provide funding for innova
tive academic programs.
The University is projecting a $20 mil
lion deficit for next year, Rice said. A $10
million shortfall in fiscal year 1994-95 had
been predicted in last year's budget plan
ning, but that figure has increased pri

marily due to deferred maintenance costs
and the continuing reduced indirect-cost
rate.
Because the cuts are intended to guar
antee the long-term financial stability of
the University rather than respond to the
immediate financial setbacks of two years
ago, Rice said she does not believe there is
a need for the broad, community-wide
consultation that took place during the
$43 million deficit-reduction process in
1991-92.
Although extensive input will be so
licited in the coming months, Rice said de

cisions on the new round of cuts will be
made by top University administrators.
Administrative cuts
While eventual reductions will have to
come from both administrative and acad
emic areas within the University, Rice
said that next year's cuts will come pri
marily from the central administrative
units, which took the most drastic cuts in
the last two rounds of budget cutting.
These areas will be asked to prepare
budgets based on a reduction of 5
percent to 10 percent per year for
each of the next three years, Rice
said. She added that she hopes to
reduced administrative costs by $5
million next year.
Rice declined to specify if a
majority of these cuts will come in
the form of layoffs, saying only that
"attrition, retraining and re-deploy
ment are all obviously preferable."

and faculty to take an honest look
