# University to cut an additional $20M from budget
## Administration to be hit hardest; 'weak' academic areas could be eliminated 
### Skip Schwartz Senior staff writer 
In its continuing struggle to get back
into the black, the University will slash
another $18 million to $20 million from
its administrative and academic areas
over the next three years in a plan de

signed by Provost Condoleezza Rice.
The reductions will be made by cutting
central administrative costs by 15 percent
to 30 percent by fiscal year 1997 and elim
inating some weak academic areas, ac
cording to the provost's annual budget
letter sent this week to deans and vice
presidents.

Academic areas were not given specific
cutting targets, but they are being asked
to re-evaluate their priorities and reorga
nize their administrative structure, Rice
said in an interview Monday.
Rice said the cuts are designed to elim
inate the University's ongoing budget
deficits and provide funding for innova
tive academic programs.
The University is projecting a $20 mil
lion deficit for next year, Rice said. A $10
million shortfall in fiscal year 1994-95 had
been predicted in last year's budget plan
ning, but that figure has increased pri

marily due to deferred maintenance costs
and the continuing reduced indirect-cost
rate.
Because the cuts are intended to guar
antee the long-term financial stability of
the University rather than respond to the
immediate financial setbacks of two years
ago, Rice said she does not believe there is
a need for the broad, community-wide
consultation that took place during the
$43 million deficit-reduction process in
1991-92.
Although extensive input will be so
licited in the coming months, Rice said de

cisions on the new round of cuts will be
made by top University administrators.
Administrative cuts
While eventual reductions will have to
come from both administrative and acad
emic areas within the University, Rice
said that next year's cuts will come pri
marily from the central administrative
units, which took the most drastic cuts in
the last two rounds of budget cutting.
These areas will be asked to prepare
