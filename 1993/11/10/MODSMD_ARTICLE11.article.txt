## Editorials Grad student vision 
### 
WELL, THE PARTY'S over,
but the big question
remains: Who's going to
clean up the mess?
The Graduate Student Tea
Party has achieved its immediate
goal â€” cutting student groups'
funding in protest of the ASSU's
failure to address grad concerns.
What remains to be seen, howev
er, is exactly how the ASSU
should be restructured to solve
the problem which effected the
refund blitz.
The campus debate over the Tea
Party made clear one sentiment
held by graduate students: they
have a different vision of what
their student government should
be doing.
Undergraduates, especially those
concerned with the future funding
of student-initiated projects, recog
nize the importance of graduate
concerns, but seem unsure just how
to address them. Their proposals
are often criticized because they

lack a personal understanding of
the real graduate issues.
The solution is straightforward:
Graduate students should voice
not only their dissatisfaction, but
also their vision for the future of
student government.
The study of the ASSU headed
by second-year law student David
Smolen couldn't have come along
at a more appropriate time. His
group, led by several graduate stu
dents, intends to analyze the
ASSU's workings and recommend
specific changes.
More importantly for the dis
gruntled supporters of the Tea
Party, Smolen is looking for people
to help.
If there were ever an opportuni
ty for graduate students to work
out what student government
should be, or avoid being, this is it.
The group's initial meeting is
tomorrow at 7 p.m. at the Bowman
Alumni House.
Bring your own tea.
