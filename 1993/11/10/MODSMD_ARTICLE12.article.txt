# An illusion of safety
## 
### 
LAST WEEK, a Stanford stu
dent was attacked and robbed
while walking home on Palm
Drive. Although incidents like this
are rare at Stanford, they do happen.
The isolation of Stanford's cam
pus offers peace, but we must not
let its relative safety lull us into a
somewhat false sense of security.
We must not forget that this is the
Farm, and Stanford's secluded
areas harbor potential threats.
The first step toward safety is
awareness. Students and staff
should make a conscious effort to
be constantly alert and to take
notice of the people nearby, espe
cially in remote areas.
But safety is not only a personal
issue. The University should lead
the way in increasing campus secu
rity, and the first steps in this
direction should be the installation
of security phones and the

improvement of lighting around
campus. Too many areas, even in
the center of campus, are danger
ously dark and isolated.
The incident on Palm Drive last
week should be a reminder to all of
us that Stanford is not as immune
to crime as it seems. It should also
be an incentive for change.
As a major artery in and out of
campus, Palm Drive must be safe
for all students to use. The Univer
sity needs to improve the lighting
along this street and install phones
along Palm Drive as well as on
other major campus thorough
fares.
We at Stanford are lucky; our
campus is much safer than many
others. But the University must
work to ensure that Stanford
never becomes a place where peo
ple are constantly looking over
their shoulders.
