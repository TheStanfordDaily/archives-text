## The
						world without you in it 
### 
THE CLOCK flashes a neon 6:30
a.m. in the dark, and after a sleep
less night you decide to go for a
walk to watch the day come on. When you
go outside, the cold air quickly wraps
itself around you and slips down your
neck. The moon is low and white, and this
is the only sign that morning is near. You
notice how still everything is, the only
suggestions of motion being the rhythm
of your steps and the distant rush of a car.
Minutes pass, and soon the edges of the
sky begin to color a dusty violet, then
orange, finally erupting into a red lava
that spreads over the paling night. And
you think to yourself, so this is what the
world looks like when 1 am not in it.
And this feeling of seeing the world as
it exists without your presence does not
leave you. That early Saturday morning,
you stand up on the hill and watch the
red-roofed campus as it sleeps. You watch
as the streetlamps slowly burn out, and
you listen to car engines groaning awake.
The thought of this happening every
morning whether you are here for it or
not does not escape you. Walking back
down Mayfield, you pass Bob whose front
steps are lined with carved pumpkins.
Before he senses you, a black squirrel
dips his front paws into a Jack-o'-
lantern's mouth, and then submerges his
whole torso. You move closer, and in a
flash he disappears into the bushes, the
only sign of him being the pumpkin's nib

bled half-grimace, now altered with his
artistry.
All day, you think this over. In the
afternoon you remember a friend's voice
and look for him everywhere. Finally, you
find him in the kitchen, and watch him
humming as he cooks. He is unaware
that you are leaning in the door frame,
and you notice how his body moves
before it is conscious of your presence.
You don't remember having ever enjoyed
being with him more. When he finally
sees you, both of you cannot help grin
ning.
During dinner you begin to remember
other times when you caught a glimpse of
the world without you, and realize that it
is not always serene and beautiful, but
sometimes rather silly. You recall a time
when you heard noises coming from your
older brother's room. You had leaned
against the wall and watched him start a
fight with his image in the mirror, throw
ing insults and punches into the air while
you tried desperately to hold in a tremen
dous cackle.
But mostly, the times you remember
— when you realized just how much goes
on in this world that you are unaware of
— were ones of amazement. Things that
go on while you are sleeping or talking.
You remember the time when you woke
in the early morning to the blanket of
snow that had covered the ground
overnight. And as you reveled in the

thoughts of cancelled school you sudden
ly saw the proud arch of a pheasant's
neck as she paraded across the white
ground. You had gotten so excited that
you woke your small sister up and carried
her to the window, and she had pressed
her face to the glass in wonder. You
leaned close to her head, the cap of her
hair still wet with sleep, and said, This is
what the world looks like without us in it.
By night, though, you have begun to
si nk back into the cocoon of your life here
at school, your mind occupied with
papers, books and telephone calls you still
have to return. The world seems not to
extend outside of the walls of your room,
and certainly not past the columns that
guard Palm Drive. By the time you are
ready for sleep it is hard to remember that
all the while things are happening around
you, lives are taking shape and going
about themselves whether you know it or
not. By morning the thought has nestled
itself somewhere into the recesses of your
mind, now forgotten until the next time
you are reminded of what the world looks
like without you in it.

It's a good thing Nicole performed this
experiment before the time change,
because 5:30 a.m. would have been too
early even for her.
