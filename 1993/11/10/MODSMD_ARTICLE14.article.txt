## Student expresses dismay at Taco Bell in Tresidder 
### 
ACCORDING to an article in yes
terday's Daily, "students eagerly
await Taco Bell's arrival on cam
pus." Well, I am a student, and I eagerly
await Taco Bell's arrival as much as I
look forward to, say, Stanford's next
tuition hike or its next cut of integral
student programs. For many reasons,
the imminent arrival of greasy, heart
clogging tacos, low-wage, low-skill jobs
and mounds of increased trash does not
seem to excite me.
For one, the University seems to be
sending the message "if you are a multi
national corporation, come on in, but if
you are a local, student-run food service,
get the hell out!" While Tresidder courts
Taco Bell, a subsidiary of Pepsico, by
spending $70,000 to facilitate the arrival
of its new guest, several local, student
run businesses and kitchens have been
harassed or shut down. Most prominent
of these victims was Nick's Diner, which
served late-night snacks last year. Yet,
not so prominent is the fact that individ
uals in co-ops, which are, in essence, stu
dent-run, financed, and managed food
services, pay over $100 extra in rent just

because they cook for themselves! Is it
fair that students who start a local busi
ness or partake in food self-sufficiency
pay while a multi-national corporation
with no direct ties to Stanford comes in
and gets paid?
Furthermore, where is this mystical
student consensus that "(Taco Bell) is
the students' food of choice" coming
from? Maybe it was the several ASSU
senatorial candidates who last year ran
on the promise that they would fight to
get a Taco Bell. Well, judging from the
voter turnout and most students' feel
ings for the ASSU, I doubt this is the
case. I do not remember any campus
vote on what Stanford's official "food of
choice" is. The people telling us what
our "food of choice" is are from Tresid
der. How many STUDENTS do you see
in decision-making positions at the STU
DENT union? When were the STU
DENTS, at large, involved in the process
of deciding whether we wanted a Taco
Bell? If Tresidder wants to use my name
in decision-making, let me help make
the decision.
Also, I can think of a lot of ways the

$70,000 could be better spent. One of
these could be a waste-reduction pro
gram. Tresidder, with its paper plates,
plastic forks and knives and styrofoam
cups generates a lot of waste. Sure,
Tresidder does not have to pay directly
for its mammoth consumption of non
renewable resources and disposal of
landfill-gobbling waste products, but
someone does. Currently, those who pay
are low-income communities which
house almost all the landfills in the Bay
Area. But in the future, Stanford itself
could pay as tough recycling laws come
into effect forcing the University to min
imize its waste stream or pay fines.
Finally, I will wager that a vast
majority, if not nearly all, of the student
patrons at Taco Bell will be Stanford
Food Service customers. In a co-op or
self-op with a stocked open kitchen, any
student can make nachos, burritos, or
tacos above the quality of Taco Bell with
extreme ease and little cost. With Food
Service, there is no open kitchen an stu
dents pay two to three times more for
board to boot! It is not a coincidence
that from my experience most people

who eat at self-ops and co-ops dine out a
lot less than those in dorms. And when
they do, it is usually not Taco Bell, since
they can afford a lot better food with the
money they save!
My recommendation is to encourage
and expand locally run businesses and
kitchens to meet the dining needs of
Stanford students. Students who pay
over $100 a week for food should not
have to take refuge in Taco Bell to satis
fy their eating demands. In addition,
Tresidder should spend the money allot
ted for Taco Bell on correcting problems
such as waste proliferation before creat
ing new ones. To quote Thomas Jeffer
son, "We are witnessing a direct con
frontation between the great transna
tional corporations and the sovereign
nations themselves." In other words,
before inviting a multi-national, low
wage paying, and waste-generating fast
food chain to rescue us from our
abysmal dining situation, we should look
for the answers to student eating needs
at home.

clogging tacos, low-wage, low-skill jobs
and mounds of increased trash does not
seem to excite me.
For one, the University seems to be
sending the message "if you are a multi
national corporation, come on in, but if
you are a local, student-run food service,
get the hell out!" While Tresidder courts
Taco Bell, a subsidiary of Pepsico, by
spending $70,000 to facilitate the arrival
of its new guest, several local, student
run businesses and kitchens have been
harassed or shut down. Most prominent
of these victims was Nick's Diner, which
served late-night snacks last year. Yet,
not so prominent is the fact that individ
uals in co-ops, which are, in essence, stu
dent-run, financed, and managed food
services, pay over $100 extra in rent just

because they cook for themselves! Is it
fair that students who start a local busi
ness or partake in food self-sufficiency
pay while a multi-national corporation
with no direct ties to Stanford comes in
and gets paid?
Furthermore, where is this mystical
student consensus that "(Taco Bell) is
the students' food of choice" coming
from? Maybe it was the several ASSU
senatorial candidates who last year ran
on the promise that they would fight to
get a Taco Bell. Well, judging from the
voter turnout and most students' feel
ings for the ASSU, I doubt this is the
case. I do not remember any campus
vote on what Stanford's official "food of
choice" is. The people telling us what
our "food of choice" is are from Tresid
der. How many STUDENTS do you see
in decision-making positions at the STU
DENT union? When were the STU
DENTS, at large, involved in the process
of deciding whether we wanted a Taco
Bell? If Tresidder wants to use my name
in decision-making, let me help make
the decision.
Also, I can think of a lot of ways the

$70,000 could be better spent. One of
these could be a waste-reduction pro
gram. Tresidder, with its paper plates,
plastic forks and knives and styrofoam
cups generates a lot of waste. Sure,
Tresidder does not have to pay directly
for its mammoth consumption of non
renewable resources and disposal of
landfill-gobbling waste products, but
someone does. Currently, those who pay
are low-income communities which
house almost all the landfills in the Bay
Area. But in the future, Stanford itself
could pay as tough recycling laws come
into effect forcing the University to min
imize its waste stream or pay fines.
Finally, I will wager that a vast
majority, if not nearly all, of the student
patrons at Taco Bell will be Stanford
Food Service customers. In a co-op or
self-op with a stocked open kitchen, any
student can make nachos, burritos, or
tacos above the quality of Taco Bell with
extreme ease and little cost. With Food
Service, there is no open kitchen an stu
dents pay two to three times more for
board to boot! It is not a coincidence
that from my experience most people

who eat at self-ops and co-ops dine out a
lot less than those in dorms. And when
they do, it is usually not Taco Bell, since
they can afford a lot better food with the
money they save!
My recommendation is to encourage
and expand locally run businesses and
kitchens to meet the dining needs of
Stanford students. Students who pay
over $100 a week for food should not
have to take refuge in Taco Bell to satis
fy their eating demands. In addition,
Tresidder should spend the money allot
ted for Taco Bell on correcting problems
such as waste proliferation before creat
ing new ones. To quote Thomas Jeffer
son, "We are witnessing a direct con
frontation between the great transna
tional corporations and the sovereign
nations themselves." In other words,
before inviting a multi-national, low
wage paying, and waste-generating fast
food chain to rescue us from our
abysmal dining situation, we should look
for the answers to student eating needs
at home.
