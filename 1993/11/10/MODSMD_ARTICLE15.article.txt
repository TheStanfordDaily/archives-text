# Stanford organizations as well as classes can provide school identity
## 
### 
The Daily's Nov. 3 "Pledging alle
giance" editorial states that "(wjith stu
dents changing dorms from year to year,
the lack of student-professor contact and
a paucity of class unity, students cling
instead to other groups .. . Stanford
should seriously consider taking con
crete measures to foster class, depart
mental and campus unity."
I agree with The Daily that there is
a lack of identification and unity

among classes. Many students graduate
early, others co-term or stay five years,
resulting in a graying of class distinc
tions.
In addition, residential education,
ethnic organizations and extracurricular
groups hamper strong class ties as stu
dents prefer to socialize and identify
with friends in their dormitory or indi
viduals who share a common interest or
background.
Despite these barriers each class
shares a special identity and STAN, the
Stanford Student Alumni Network,
sponsors programs to bring freshmen,
sophomores, juniors and seniors togeth
er in social settings. We too have recog
nized the dearth of activities aimed
specifically at sophomores and juniors.

On Thursday, Oct. 4, in an attempt to
revive a 50-year-old tradition, STAN
sponsored Sophomore Pajamarino. In
addition, STAN aims to strengthen class
ties through events such as Junior Com
edy Night, Senior Casino Night, Senior
Weekend and major-based brunches, as
well as class sweatshirts, t-shirts and
key chains.
However, active participation in the
Stanford community, whether in dormi
tories, ethnic organizations, the Greek
system, athletics, public service or
other extracurricular activities should
not be discouraged. Student involve
ment strengthens Stanford as a whole
and provides opportunities for students
to define themselves within the Univer
sity. The Alumni Association recognizes

the importance of these associations by
organizing "mini-reunions" of smaller
groups as part of the larger undergrad
uate reunions that take place every five
years.
Class allegiance shouldn't be left to
the University to initiate or encour
aged solely for the purpose of increas
ing alumni contributions. Rather,
complementing Stanford's other
opportunities, a strengthening of class
identity offers a chance for students to
celebrate each year as a unique experi
ence, meet fellow students, relish
their time at Stanford and become
active alumni.
