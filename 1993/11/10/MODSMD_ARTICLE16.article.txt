## Fat lotion cures large thighs Student helps research new fat-reducing cream 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
Always thought your thighs were too fat?
Want to get rid of that beer belly, even though
the rest of you is fine?
An answer to your worries may be on its way.
Senior Erin Hamilton has helped to synthe
size a lotion that will allow fat to be lost or redis
tributed from the area it is applied to.
The lotion contains an active ingredient
called aminophyiline that enters the body from
the skin and diffuses into fat cells. Once inside
fat cells, this ingredient helps to propagate the
body's natural process of breaking down stored
fat.
For example, applying the lotion to your
thighs would cause fat to be broken down there.
If you were dieting at the same time, your thigh
fat would be used before fat from other parts of
your body would; otherwise the fat would be
spread to other parts of the body.
Hamilton has helped to test and formulate
this ground-breaking liniment through sum
mer internships with Stanford alumnus Frank
L. Greenway, a professor at Harbor-UCLA
Medical Center in Torrance, Calif.
The fat cycle starts at the dinner table.
The body digests food and separates the fat
from the rest of the food. The fat is then trans
ported to fat cells throughout the body. Fat
accumulation differs from person to person.
While some tend to gain fat most easily in their
thighs, others may gain it in their abdomen.
The lotion is most effective in the areas
where fat usually accumulates.
A chemical known as cyclic AMP is key acti
vator of the fat-breaking process in the cells.
Under normal circumstances, this chemical
wears away after a period of use.
But aminophyiline prevents cyclic AMP from
disintegrating and so causes fat to be continual
ly broken down.
This decomposed fat, made up of fatty acids
and glycerol, is released into your blood stream
to be consumed as energy by other parts of the
body.
If you're dieting or exercising, there is less
energy coming from food sources, so your body
begins using stored fat instead. In this case, the
fat already freed up by the lotion is used first.
The net effect is weight loss from the desired
area.
If the body does not need this extra energy , it
stores the fat. However, if itfll dSesrlot store'as
much fat in the area where the lotion is applied
because of the fat-breaking effects of the amino
phyiline.
The research group has already obtained a
patent and is well on its way to mass-producing
and marketing their product.
But before that, they will have to perform a
number of safety tests. So far, aminophyiline
has proved to be a safe active ingredient in its
0.5 percent concentration, and does not enter

the bloodstream itself.
The product may need to undergo more tests
if the Food and Drug Administration classifies it
as a prescribed drug. Otherwise it may be sold
as a cosmetic lotion to "smooth dimples caused
by fat," Green way said.
The group hopes that it will become a substi
tute to liposuction.
Hamilton recently presented the results of
the group's research at the North American
Association for the Study of Obesity, and the
idea elicited both surprise and skepticism from
the scientific community.
"Why is fat loss tougher in the thighs than in
the abdomen?" was the question that first set
" Greenway and co-researcher George Bray, cur
rently at Louisiana State University, on their
path to creating this lotion.
While on sabbatical in Sweden, Bray noticed
that women had an easier time losing fat from
their abdomens than from their thighs after
obesity surgery.
The two scientists later found that thigh fat
cells have a certain cell receptor that inhibits fat
loss in greater quantity than in other fat cells.
To counter the effects of the receptors, they

started tests in women using hormonal injec
tions, and their research yielded a viable chemi
cal to use as an active ingredient.
"We knew the concept (of regional fat reduc
tion) worked in the body, but women don't want
injections," Greenway said.
Hamilton, who is majoring in human biolo
gy, was hired as an intern to develop the prod
uct.
Through further research, the group came
up with an alternative to iryections: an oint
ment base using vaseline.
Their most recent formulation of a lotion
base has so far been successful. Hamilton's tests
on women's thighs have shown that the lotion is
absorbed well. After five weeks of application,
the treated thighs of a group of 11 women were
several centimeters less in girth than the con
trol thighs.
"But how much fat can I keep losing from my
thighs?" you may ask. Though the researchers
have not been able to find a limit yet, Greenway
believes aminophylline can only diffuse to a cer
tain depth. Beyond that, fat won't be broken
down, so your leg should not shrivel up into a
stick either.

To counter the effects of the receptors, they

started tests in women using hormonal injec
tions, and their research yielded a viable chemi
cal to use as an active ingredient.
"We knew the concept (of regional fat reduc
tion) worked in the body, but women don't want
injections," Greenway said.
Hamilton, who is majoring in human biolo
gy, was hired as an intern to develop the prod
uct.
Through further research, the group came
up with an alternative to iryections: an oint
ment base using vaseline.
Their most recent formulation of a lotion
base has so far been successful. Hamilton's tests
on women's thighs have shown that the lotion is
absorbed well. After five weeks of application,
the treated thighs of a group of 11 women were
several centimeters less in girth than the con
trol thighs.
"But how much fat can I keep losing from my
thighs?" you may ask. Though the researchers
have not been able to find a limit yet, Greenway
believes aminophylline can only diffuse to a cer
tain depth. Beyond that, fat won't be broken
down, so your leg should not shrivel up into a
stick either.

Always thought your thighs were too fat?
Want to get rid of that beer belly, even though
the rest of you is fine?
An answer to your worries may be on its way.
Senior Erin Hamilton has helped to synthe
size a lotion that will allow fat to be lost or redis
tributed from the area it is applied to.
The lotion contains an active ingredient
called aminophyiline that enters the body from
the skin and diffuses into fat cells. Once inside
fat cells, this ingredient helps to propagate the
body's natural process of breaking down stored
fat.
For example, applying the lotion to your
thighs would cause fat to be broken down there.
If you were dieting at the same time, your thigh
fat would be used before fat from other parts of
your body would; otherwise the fat would be
spread to other parts of the body.
Hamilton has helped to test and formulate
this ground-breaking liniment through sum
mer internships with Stanford alumnus Frank
L. Greenway, a professor at Harbor-UCLA
Medical Center in Torrance, Calif.
The fat cycle starts at the dinner table.
The body digests food and separates the fat
from the rest of the food. The fat is then trans
ported to fat cells throughout the body. Fat
accumulation differs from person to person.
While some tend to gain fat most easily in their
thighs, others may gain it in their abdomen.
The lotion is most effective in the areas
where fat usually accumulates.
A chemical known as cyclic AMP is key acti
vator of the fat-breaking process in the cells.
Under normal circumstances, this chemical
wears away after a period of use.
But aminophyiline prevents cyclic AMP from
disintegrating and so causes fat to be continual
ly broken down.
This decomposed fat, made up of fatty acids
and glycerol, is released into your blood stream
to be consumed as energy by other parts of the
body.
If you're dieting or exercising, there is less
energy coming from food sources, so your body
begins using stored fat instead. In this case, the
fat already freed up by the lotion is used first.
The net effect is weight loss from the desired
area.
If the body does not need this extra energy , it
stores the fat. However, if itfll dSesrlot store'as
much fat in the area where the lotion is applied
because of the fat-breaking effects of the amino
phyiline.
The research group has already obtained a
patent and is well on its way to mass-producing
and marketing their product.
But before that, they will have to perform a
number of safety tests. So far, aminophyiline
has proved to be a safe active ingredient in its
0.5 percent concentration, and does not enter

the bloodstream itself.
The product may need to undergo more tests
if the Food and Drug Administration classifies it
as a prescribed drug. Otherwise it may be sold
as a cosmetic lotion to "smooth dimples caused
by fat," Green way said.
The group hopes that it will become a substi
tute to liposuction.
Hamilton recently presented the results of
the group's research at the North American
Association for the Study of Obesity, and the
idea elicited both surprise and skepticism from
the scientific community.
"Why is fat loss tougher in the thighs than in
the abdomen?" was the question that first set
" Greenway and co-researcher George Bray, cur
rently at Louisiana State University, on their
path to creating this lotion.
While on sabbatical in Sweden, Bray noticed
that women had an easier time losing fat from
their abdomens than from their thighs after
obesity surgery.
The two scientists later found that thigh fat
cells have a certain cell receptor that inhibits fat
loss in greater quantity than in other fat cells.
To counter the effects of the receptors, they

started tests in women using hormonal injec
tions, and their research yielded a viable chemi
cal to use as an active ingredient.
