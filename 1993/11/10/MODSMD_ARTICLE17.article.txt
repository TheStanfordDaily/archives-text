# Ozone hole worsens to thinnest ever recorded

### Kara Howland 
The earth's ozone hole has got
ten worse this fall, and will con
tinue to deteriorate for decades to
come, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration
(NASA) reported recently.
According to NASA, the term
"ozone hole" is used to describe
a large area of intense ozone
depletion that occurs annually
over the Antarctic during late
August through early October
and typically breaks up in late
November.
The report specified that the
ozone layer's thickness, measured
in Dobson units, has decreased to
the lowest levels ever recorded.

Three-hundred Dobson units
equals about three millimeters.
The "regular" level of ozone
exhibited in winter, spring and
early summer hovers at a level of
about 275 Dobson units, but dur
ing this last measurement during
the month of October, it was
recorded at 90 Dobson units.
NASA has linked the annual
phenomenon of severe Antarctic
ozone depletion to the release of
certain chlorine compounds and
other chemicals through human
activity.
Although much has been done
to rectify the ozone problem, "it's
not a solved problem," Biological
Sciences Prof. Steven Schneider
explained. "We know that [ultra

violet light] damages things, we
know that statistically, exposure
to ultraviolet increases cancers
and we know that it increases
cancers of all types, but it gets
very confusing. . . ."
Schneider added that although
the emission of ozone-depleting
chemicals has decreased, yearly
depletion will continue for some
time to come: "We have to wait
for the ultraviolet light above the
ozone layer to destroy the fluoro
carbons, produce the chlorine, do
the ozone-reducing, and eventual
ly have the system heal itself a
century from now." It will take
industries at least two decades to
completely stop harmful emis
sions, and the same time for

nature to respond to them.
Ozone is a molecule made up of
three recombined oxygen atoms.
It is a one of the uppermost layers
of the atmosphere and absorbs
ultraviolet radiation from the
sun. Less ozone present in the
atmosphere allows more harmful
ultraviolet light to reach the
earth's surface.
Recently, the validity of the
hole in the ozone layer has been
questioned. Many individuals are
up in arms over this development.
However, Schneider added, "It
would be better to listen to the
scientists who actually study
what human activities could be
doing to nature than the polemics
of someone like Rush Limbaugh."
