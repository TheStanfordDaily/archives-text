# Accessor fits diverse disabilities
## Researchers improving info access for disabled

"Give me a place to stand on,
and I will move the earth,"
Archimedes said.
Following the motto of this
ancient Greek mathematician, the
Center for the Study of language
and Information is working on
The Archimedes Project, designed
to improve disabled individuals'
interactions with technology that
may not be disabled-user friendly.
Between 40 million and 50 mil
lion people have disabilities in the
United States. And as CSLI
research associate Elizabeth
Macken, one of the leaders of the
Archimedes Project, points out,
"There are not just four or five
kinds of disabilities, there are
thousands of combinations"
which must be taken into consid
eration when building accessibili
ty into products.
Neil Scott, a research associate
at CSLI, has designed a system
which allows individuals with a
range of disabilities to use a cus
tom-designed, portable accessor to
communicate with host comput
ers or other electronic products,
such as an automated teller

machine (ATM).
The Total Access System
(TAS), is unique in that it provides
a new, low-cost user interface
which will be easy to install and
simple to use.
The accessor interacts with the
host computer through a high
speed, infrared communications
link, much like how a remote-con
trol device communicates with a
television set.
The host computer is connected
to the accessor through a stan
dardized Total Access Port (TAP),
which communicates with the
accessor via infrared receiver. A
microprocessor then translates
access codes into electronic sig
nals, emulating the particular
keyboard or mouse inputs the host
receives.
The Total Access System gives
disabled persons greater mobility,
allowing them to carry the acces
sor around with them and use the
device in their homes, at work and
in public areas that have the
access port installed.
And with more efficient ways of
exchanging information, the
entire community would benefit,
Scott said.

In addition, computer manu
facturers could attach a TAP to
their products for under $100 and
slightly modify their designs to
make their products accessible to
anyone with an accessor.
The system provides different
benefits for people with different
disabilities. A person who can only
move an eyebrow would be fitted
with an accessor that is hooked up
to the eyebrow. The person would
enter keystrokes into the host
computer using Morse code.
Blind persons encounter a dif
ferent type of problem with the
increasing use of graphics on com
puters. Icons, windows and pull
down menus are innovative, but
they are inaccessible to the blind.
But as computer manufactur
ers develop "dual-representation
languages" that combine text with
non-textual elements, automatic
screen readers that read on-screen
text for blind people have become
nearly obsolete.
Still, an accessor for blind indi
viduals could process much more
information than do current
screen readers because it could
include a character-magnification
program, speech synthesizer,

graphics scanner, and optical
character-recognition software, all
tailored to an individual's needs.
For the physically disabled,
interacting with appliances, com
puters, an ATM, or even their own
wheelchairs can be problematic if
they do not have the motor abili
ties to operate the controls.
Currently, there is a wide range
of technology to help physically
disabled people to perform normal
motor functions. However, many
individuals must use a collection
of separate devices to meet their
needs. This can be both costly and
cumbersome, Scott explained.

A single accessor, however,
would provide a consistent inter
face for users to communicate
with all types of devices.
An accessor can also communi
cate with another accessor, which
could improve information
exchange between, for example, a
deaf person and a hearing person
who does not know sign lan
guage.
This application could be
adapted to allow people who
speak different languages to com
municate with one another face
to-face.
Presently, the Total Access

System concept is working, and
demonstrations are being run.
But researchers are still trying to
make the computer code bug-free
and reduce the accessor and TAP
sizes.
Because "computers are every
where," Scott said, "we need to
make them fully accessible so no
one is left out."
The Archimedes Project's
unique approach to "getting out
side the computer" and under
standing the obstacles to equal
technological access may provide
the solution everyone's been
waiting for.
