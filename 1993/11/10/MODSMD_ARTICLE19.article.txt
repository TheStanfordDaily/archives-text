Q: What's the dope on pot? 1
mean, how bad is it for
you, really ?
— Dazed and Confused
A: From an early age, Amer
icans are indoctrinated
about the dangers of drugs
in general and marijuana in par
ticular. Marijuana is a killer, we
are told — single puffs turning
otherwise productive citizens
into brain-damaged addicts who
usually die of an overdose before
cancer rots away their lungs.
Fortunately for those who
occasionally

indulge in mari
juana use, this
bleak picture is
far from the
truth. Every
well-controlled,
unbiased study
I could find on
the topic indi
cates that mari
juana — while

not exactly good for your health
— isn't very bad for you at all.
Marijuana does cause some
brain damage. So does smoking a
tobacco cigarette or drinking one
Lite™ beer. The fact of the mat
ter is, you lose about 200,000
brain cells every day, and as far
as the best experiments can tell,
a joint of pot isn't really that sig
nificant an agent of neural decay.
"But what about people who
smoke, like, ten joints a day for
thirteen years? They must surely
get brain damage? After all,
where did the rumors come
from?"
Despite the somewhat unreal
istic premise of this (rhetorical)
question, it leads us on to an
interesting topic: the so-called
"chronic" users of pot, a sorry
bunch whose statistics form the
backbone of many studies on the
subject of marijuana use.
The chronic users cited in
research papers about pot tend
to be from low socio-economic
classes and have criminal records
(in fact, many of these studies
recruit from among prison
inmates, offering them small
comforts in exchange for their
blood, medical histories and ver
bal testimony). In addition,
many of them smoke truly
unreasonable quantities of grass
— multiple joints per day over
many years, in some cases.
These subjects do show some
brain cell loss over controls (peo
ple of the same age who claimed
to have never taken a single hit
of grass), but because they are so
different from the control groups
in other ways (many are heavy
users of alcohol, tobacco and nar
cotic drugs; others have a history
of malnutrition), it is scientifical
ly unreasonable to conclude that
marijuana was responsible.
The same thing could be said
about another reputed harm of
marijuana smoking: cancer.
Some studies of cancer incidence
among marijuana users find a
slight increase over controls, but

these are the same studies which
depend on criminal subjects with
histories of other sorts of drug
use and abuse.
Other studies find that pot
smokers are not at all more like
ly to get cancer of the lung,
throat or nose. These are the
studies which control for tobacco
and alcohol use throughout the
subject's life.
Conclusion? The assertion
that marijuana smoking causes
cancer is based on flawed
research which failed to control
for significant variables. My
money, as always, is with the
more scientific studies. It can't
exactly be good for anyone to

inhale burn
ing vegetable
matter into
the lungs, but
hey, you can
always eat it.
"But
what makes
those poor
jailbirds
smoke pot all

the time?
Mustn't they be addicted?"
The issue of addiction in the
case of marijuana is less straight
forward than it is for drugs like
cocaine and heroin. These hard
er drugs interact with the brain's
pleasure centers. Chronic
administration of these drugs
limits the brain's ability to pro
duce the neurotransmitters
associated with positive feelings;
eventually, the only way a coke
fiend or junkie can feel better is
by getting a fix.
Not so with marijuana,
because its active molecule,
THC, has its own receptors
within the brain. Chronic pot
use does reduce the levels of
these receptors — requiring the
smoker in question to consume
larger and larger quantities over
time in order the achieve the
same high — tjyt ft doesn't
interfere with the brain's natu
ral abilities to make itself feel
good.
Ergo, you don't have the
awful addiction and even worse
withdrawal that accompany
recreational use of drugs like
coke and heroin. There is a cer
tain degree of psychological
addiction, but — according to my
reading of the literature — no
physical dependence whatsoever.
There you have it, folks: the
dope on pot. Forget what Nancy
Reagan told you when you
weren't old enough to know the
difference. It's not going to kill
you, it's not going to addict you,
and it's not going to make you
stupid.
Lest you think me a proselyte
of pot, allow me to assure you
that I am merely a scientist
reporting what I know of the
facts.
Hey, Joe ... pass that bong.
