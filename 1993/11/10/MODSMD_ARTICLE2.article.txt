# Leaders to discuss campus' global role
## IIS council starts conference today 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
A former president of Israel and
recent foreign minister of the Soviet
Union are among 23 leaders in poli
tics, business and academia who are
arriving on campus today for discus
sions on Stanford's role in changing
world affairs â€” and, as an added
bonus, for a round of golf.
The dignitaries are members of
the Institute for International Stud
ies Advisory Council, a group
formed three years ago to advise
Stanford on its programs and re
search related to international secu
rity, political economy and the glob
al environment.
"This is an important event for both
lIS and Stanford," said Walter Falcon,
director of the institute. He said dis
cussion topics will include trade and
security issues, among others.
Established in 1988, the Insti

tute for International Studies has
served as an umbrella organization
that coordinates the University's
numerous international efforts.
During the advisory council's
four-day meeting, members of the
Stanford faculty will provide
overviews of the international pro
jects in which the University is in
volved, and the meeting partici
pants will offer suggestions on ways
to improve them.
"Its purpose is to talk about the
work going on at Stanford .... to
critique our programs [and| give
good pointers on future activities
that would be productive," said
Assoc. Director Nancy Okimoto.
Topics of past meetings included
Stanford's role in the reconstruc
tion of the former Soviet Union, as
well as health care and environmen
tal issues.
