# Leaders to discuss campus' global role
## IIS council starts conference today 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
A former president of Israel and
recent foreign minister of the Soviet
Union are among 23 leaders in poli
tics, business and academia who are
arriving on campus today for discus
sions on Stanford's role in changing
world affairs — and, as an added
bonus, for a round of golf.
The dignitaries are members of
the Institute for International Stud
ies Advisory Council, a group
formed three years ago to advise
Stanford on its programs and re
search related to international secu
rity, political economy and the glob
al environment.
"This is an important event for both
lIS and Stanford," said Walter Falcon,
director of the institute. He said dis
cussion topics will include trade and
security issues, among others.
Established in 1988, the Insti

tute for International Studies has
served as an umbrella organization
that coordinates the University's
numerous international efforts.
During the advisory council's
four-day meeting, members of the
Stanford faculty will provide
overviews of the international pro
jects in which the University is in
volved, and the meeting partici
pants will offer suggestions on ways
to improve them.
"Its purpose is to talk about the
work going on at Stanford .... to
critique our programs [and| give
good pointers on future activities
that would be productive," said
Assoc. Director Nancy Okimoto.
Topics of past meetings included
Stanford's role in the reconstruc
tion of the former Soviet Union, as
well as health care and environmen
tal issues.
Members of the 39-person advi
sory council who are attending this
session — the third such meeting —
include Distinguished Hoover Fel
low and former Secretary of State
George Shultz, former Israeli Presi
dent Chaim Herzog, and former
Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Paul Volcker. Shultz chairs the
council, which last met in May 1992.
The presence of so many influ
ential dignitaries on the council hais
had the added benefit of raising
Stanford's worldwide visibility.
"It's been interesting [to see how
much] feedback we've been get
ting" from foreigners who have
heard about it, Okimoto said.
Falcon agreed, saying that the
council "has opened doors and pro
vided some valuable contacts [in
other countries]."
Activities kick off this afternoon
with a discussion in Kresge Audito
rium on prospects for peace in the

Middle East, and participants
include the former prime ministers
from Australia and Germany as
well as former Soviet Foreign Min
ister Alexander Bessmertnykh.
The public affairs cable network
C-SPAN will film the event for air
ing at a later date.
For the meeting's official open
ing tomorrow, Shultz will moder
ate a lunch discussion with the
council and 140 guests, who will be
mainly faculty members.
Throughout the weekend, five
closed sessions will be held in which
council members and Stanford fac
ulty discuss Stanford's involve
ment in particular academic topics,
such as "Science in Space," "Edu
cation in a Global Context" and
"Russia Update: The Continuing
Political Crisis and the Prospects
for Economic Reform."
On Friday, the advisory council
will have lunch with about 200 pre
selected students in the Manzanita
Dining Hall. On Saturday, council
members will have the chance to
play golf at the Stanford Golf
Course.
