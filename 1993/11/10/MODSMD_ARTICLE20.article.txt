## Stanford's Eick finds role 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
In order for any team to be phe
nomenally successful, it needs a
cast of superstars. Just as impor
tant, however, are those members
who play supporting roles.
No one has learned this lesson
better than senior Heidi Eick. In
her fourth year on the Stanford
women's volleyball team, she has
finally found her place both on and
off the court. Her search, however,
has not been easy.
"Every Stanford student comes
from being one of the best in the
town they grew up to coming
here," Eick said. "Suddenly you're
in a world where everyone was the
best and you drop all the way down
to just average."
While Stanford sees its share of
exceptional athletes, few would use
the term "average" when describ
ing Eick. This season she has been
a key figure on the court as a front
row substitute for setter Piper
Hahn and also leads the team as a
tri-captain and one of only four
upperclassmen on the young
squad.
"This year has been so much
fun because I have a specific role on
the team which is important to the
team's success," Eick said. "That's
the greatest thing that I could have
hoped for coming into Stanford,
something that I've always want
ed."
Throughout her first three
years on the Cardinal squad, Eick
saw limited playing time on teams
loaded with experience and talent.
Her main challenge came in defin
ing her place among these groups,
even if it meant her rmyor contri
butions would come during prac
tices instead of matches.
"There comes a time when you
have to realize what you have and

make the most of it," said coach
Don Shaw. "She's done a tremen
dous job of realizing what her limi
tations are and also not letting
them hold her back. She's still
going to keep battling out there
and striving to improve."
While many are tempted to give
up when the battle seems particu
larly brutal, Eick took the opposite
approach. While she may have
spent more time on the sidelines
than she had hoped, Eick proved
herself an extremely hard worker,
always giving everything she could
during practices. She dedicated
herself not only to helping improve
the team but developed her own
skills as well as style along the way.
"Sometimes you just have to
look to yourself," Eick said. "I
think it helped me build my charac
ter and made me a stronger person
— I learned to depend on myself a
little more than I was used to."
While Eick came to rely on her
self as a source of strength, she also
turned to her family and friends for
support and encouragement. Her
parents not only reminded her of
her own talents, they also helped
her realize the caliber of the Stan
ford team.
"My parents helped me a lot,"
Eick said. "They always tried to put
things in perspective for me and
say listen, you forget about who
you're around."
After first playing volleyball on
her elementary school team in her
hometown of Manhattan Beach,
Calif., it was actually Piper Hahn's
(a present Cardinal teammate)
family who convinced Eick to try
out for a club team in the seventh
grade. The two went on to play
together at Mira Costa High
School, leading the team to the
national title their senior year.
That same year, Eick was named a
Volleyball Monthly first-team high

school All-American.
Since coming to Stanford, Eick
has been a member of exceptional
Cardinal teams. With three years
of experience playing on successful
squads and also as part of last
year's national championship, Eick
has witnessed the quality of play
needed in order to earn a second
title.
"We can always use last year's
team as a standard," Eick said.
"We know what it takes to win
because we were on that team and
we know what the competition is
like out there."
At the same time, Eick and her
teammates have found that the dis
tinction of being the defending
national champion is not enough to
secure regular-season victories, not
to mention lead them to the Final
Four.
"We realize we have to earn
every single win that we get for
ourselves — last year's team can't
win it for us and that reputation
can't win it for us; we have to earn
that reputation again," Eick said.
"I think that that's been good
because we've had to work a lot
harder and had to re-evaluate
where we are."
While this year's squad knows it
must make its name for itself, last
year's team still serves not only as
a guideline, but also as a source of
inspiration.
"He (Shaw) had us watch the
championship match after we lost
to Arizona State and' Arizona,"
Eick said. "We came in on Monday
and he just put in the champi
onship game and was like, 'This is
what we need to start doing.' A lot
of people watched it for the first
time in a different light, realizing
actually what it takes."
As co-captain, Eick makes an
extra effort to help her younger
teammates as they deal with the

difficult transition to high-level col
lege volleyball.
"She's very good at being able to
communicate with teammates,"
Shaw said. "She's able to listen and
understand. She's just been a
tremendous asset to this program."
Leading the Cardinal through
the end of this season, Eick is plan
ning for a career outside of volley
ball and may see her share of time

in a different kind of court. After
working for a Los Angeles law firm
for the past two summers, the eco
nomics major decided to take the
IJSAT last year and is currently
applying to law schools.
"After my sophomore year play
ing volleyball I realized that I had
to find other things in my life that
made me feel good about myself,"
Eick said. "It was really interesting

to see how a law firm works and I
was around a lot of people who
were applying to law school."
With her long-term sights set on
becoming an attorney, Eick will
focus in on the remainder of the
season and, as usual, give all she
can to the Stanford squad. After
devoting herself to the team for the
past four years, she wouldn't
expect anything less.
