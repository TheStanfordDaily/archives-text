# The 						best ever?
## Top-ranked women's tennis squad prepares for Rolex Invite 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
After coaching eight national champion
teams at Stanford, you wouldn't expect
women's tennis coach Frank Brennan to be
particularly impressed by any squad.
Nevertheless, Brennan believes that this
year's team may be the most talented Cardinal
crew ever to grace the courts of the Stanford
Tennis Stadium.
"I can't remember a year when we've had
so many good players," Brennan said.
The Intercollegiate Tennis Association's
ranking committee supports Brennan's
appraisal. It awarded the Stanford women a
preseason No. 1 ranking.
Several members of last year's NCAA run
ner-up squad have also received national
rankings. They include No. 1 Laxmi Poruri,
No. 6 Kim Shasby, No. 24 Kristine Kurth, No.

37 Beth Berris and No. 42 Amy Chiminellq.
In addition, the Cardinal roster features
the only graduate from the high-school class of
'93 to be ranked by the ITA, No. 49 Katie
Schlukebir.
The team looks to improve upon last May's
NCAA showing, in which it was beaten by an
upstart squad from Texas in the finals.
"Last year we played up to our potential
before losing to Texas," said Brennan. "This
year we're pretty hungry. There's pent-up
demand for a championship."
According to Brennan, this year's presea
son rankings could be deceiving. He said that
while Stanford landed some of the best Amer
ican-bred recruits, successful "overseas
recruiting by schools such as Florida" pre
vents anyone from being able to accurately
gauge some colleges' levels of talent.
Stanford will get a look at its and other
schools' new players when it hosts the Rolex

Regional Women's Tennis Tournament this
Fnday through Monday.
Shasby, Kurth and Berris are expected to be
seeded among the top players in the event.
Other players likely to be seeded are third
ranked California's Pam Nelson, Jennifer
Poulos and Vira Vitels.
Poruri will not play this weekend because
her ranking among the nation's top five
players provides her with automatic entry
into the Rolex National Indoors Champi
onship in February.
Chiminello will also miss the upcoming
tourney. She is recovering from foot surgery
and will not be able to play until winter.
Play will begin on Friday at 8 a.m. and
will continue throughout the day. Saturday
and Sunday matches will start at 9 a.m. each
day, and the finals in singles and doubles will
be played concurrently on Monday at 1:30
p.m.
