# Oregon first, garage later for Cardinal
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
With postseason play now an
unrealized goal, the Stanford foot
ball team travels to Oregon this
week faced with the challenge of
finding motivation for its final two
games of the season.
"Our hats are of! to Oregon and
all the other Pac-10 schools, for
that matter, for being bowl-bound,"
said Stanford head coach Bill
Walsh. "We will be home sweeping
up and cleaning the garage out and
those kinds of things."
But Oregon (5-4,2-4 in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference) is not necessarily
headed for a bowl game. The Ducks
need victories in their final two
games against Stanford and Oregon
State in order to have the minimum
six wins against NCAA Division I-A
opponents (one of Oregon's victo
ries this year was against Division l-
AA Montana). A Stanford win this
Saturday would relegate the Ducks
to hou9ecleaning rather than bowl
ing after Thanksgiving.
"Certainly, we have bowl aspira
tions," said Oregon head coach Rich
Brooks. "This is our most impor
tant game of the year. We're going
to do anything we can to be alive (for
postseason) next Monday."
Stanford (3-6, 1-5) has increas
ingly evidenced growing pains as
the season has progressed. After
winning two of its first three
games, the combination of injuries
and inexperience then took its toll
on the Cardinal.
Defensively is where youth has
been the Cardinal's greatest liabili
ty. While many players on the team
are already eagerly anticipating
next year, the squad still must con
tend with the offenses of Oregon
and California before they can

think about spring practice.
The Cardinal secondary, after
being scorched for 349 yards by USC
quarterback Rob Johnson in a 45-20
loss to the Trojans on Saturday in
Los Angeles, will get another stifT
test this week in Eugene. Ducks
quarterback Danny O'Neil is second
in the Pac-10 only to Stanford's own
Steve Stenstrom in total offense.
After what Johnson did to the
Cardinal, Walsh is concerned about

facing another potent passing
attack.
"The deep pass concerns us, but
also so does the medium pass — and
the short pass," Walsh observed.
"Oregon can move the ball against
anybody."
With Stenstrom and O'Neil both
looking to throw long, the key to Sat
urday's game, according to Brooks,
will depend on "which defense han
dles the other offense best."

Yet both defenses rank near the
bottom of the league, and neither
team has a running game to boast
about. Therefore, the scoreboard
operator at Autzen Stadium
should have a busy day.
"This game will be a fireworks
type of game with a lot of passing,"
Walsh said. "Between the two schools
we'll see a lot of offense. Our best
defense will be to make first downs
(on offense) and control the ball."
