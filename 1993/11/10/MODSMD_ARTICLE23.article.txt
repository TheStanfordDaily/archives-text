# Jogging for the jock
## AFA provides casual competition 
### Roger Han 
On the bulletin board outside
the men's locker room in dank
Encina Gym, a small sign mysteri
ously proclaims "ANGELL FIELD
ANCIENTS."
The Ancients, as they are affec
tionately known, are a motley
group of Stanford faculty, staff,
alumni and graduate students
who run together throughout the
year.
They meet every weekday at
12:15 p.m. on Angell Field, except
for Wednesday when they meet in
the stadium. Usually they run on
the golf course on Mondays, in the
foothills on Tuesdays, and hold
interval workouts on the stadium
track on Wednesdays. On Thurs
days and Fridays, they do whatev
er strikes their fancy.
Wednesday is the most popular
day, with as many as 50 people
from all over the area showing up
to train on the stadium track. The
runners usually break up into
slow, medium and fast groups for
timed intervals.
Many talented athletes have
trained with the Ancients at one
time or another, including several
Olympians. Phil Conley, who com
peted in the javelin at the 1956
Olympics, runs a couple of times a
week, and Olympic rower Kent
Mitchell is an occasional partici
pant. Even world-class runner
Nancy Ditz is rumored to have
shown up once or twice.
However, "there's probably the
least emphasis on elitism here as
you can find anywhere," said
Stanford professor emeritus Don
Carpenter, who attended Stanford
as an undergraduate in the late
1940s and began running with the
group in 1973.
"One of the joys of the Ancients
is a definite lack of seriousness,"
he said.
The runners do have a compet
itive attitude and like to push each
other, but they also enjoy the
social side of running. They hold
social functions such as a chili
party in the fall, a beer party in
the spring and a picnic in the sum
mer. The members also award
humorous honors to each other at
their gatherings.
One of the more coveted
awards is the Golden Jock award,
which has been passed around for
the last twenty years. The "tro
phy" is a giant jockstrap adorned
with medals, which was once
given for athletic prowess, but is
now mainly a means to convey
good-natured scorn and ridicule.
The current winner, 48-year-old
inventor Jan Krieg, known locally
as Dr. Technology, has been run
ning with the Ancients for four
years.
A new award that is only being
presented for the second year is

the Golden Jog Bra award. The
winner this year, 38-year-old
Lynn Macy, an Ancient for 13
years, guessed that she won the
award because of her team spirit
and dedication.
Many other awards have been
handed out such as the "Win is to
Win" award, given for the largest
margin of victory in a race, and
others just made up on a whim,
such as the "Flying Start Award,"
or the "Leathery Old Man
Award."
The Ancients show their appre
ciation by regularly donating to
the Friends of Stanford Track
fund and supporting Stanford
running in general.
The AFA tradition was born in
1964 when Stanford Professors
James Gere, Dave Stevenson and
Alan Waterman met while run
ning at Angell Field. Since then,
hundreds of runners have shared
in this special experience.
The ages of the members cur
rently range from the mid-20s to
the mid-60s. Such a wide range in
age can cause compatibility diffi
culties.
"My problem these days is try
ing to keep up with the guys," said
former Stanford mile-record-hold
er Norman Lloyd. "Unfortunately,
as you get older, you lose speed."
Undergraduates rarely run
with the group, and oftentimes
join the Stanford Running Club
instead, said Prof. Carpenter.
At one time, the Ancients actual
ly won a national clearinghouse
competition for intercollegiate fac
ulty-staff running teams, but now
enter fewer competitions as a team.
They do hold competitions within
the group such as "farewell" runs
when a member leaves, but these
are mainly for fun.
"In any relay we have, we don't
consider it successful unless one
or two teams get lost or run in the
wrong direction," explained Car
penter.
The Ancients' main group com
petition is the recently held Intra
mural Cross Country meet, which
they unofficially won by capturing
15 of the top 24 places. They were
also largely responsible for having
the race moved from the soccer
fields to the lush golf course years
ago, said Carpenter
One self-described "maniacal
Angell Field Ancient" is George
Behlmer, a professor at the Uni
versity of Washington. "This is an
organization with amazing tenta
cles," he said.
Behlmer started running as a
Stanford graduate student in the
mid-1970s and has since returned
frequently during vacations and
summers to run with the group.
"This place is second home," he
said of his association — "it's part
social, part athletic, and part state
of mind."

for Wednesday when they meet in
the stadium. Usually they run on
the golf course on Mondays, in the
foothills on Tuesdays, and hold
interval workouts on the stadium
track on Wednesdays. On Thurs
days and Fridays, they do whatev
er strikes their fancy.
Wednesday is the most popular
day, with as many as 50 people
from all over the area showing up
to train on the stadium track. The
runners usually break up into
slow, medium and fast groups for
timed intervals.
Many talented athletes have
trained with the Ancients at one
time or another, including several
Olympians. Phil Conley, who com
peted in the javelin at the 1956
Olympics, runs a couple of times a
week, and Olympic rower Kent
Mitchell is an occasional partici
pant. Even world-class runner
Nancy Ditz is rumored to have
shown up once or twice.
However, "there's probably the
least emphasis on elitism here as
you can find anywhere," said
Stanford professor emeritus Don
Carpenter, who attended Stanford
as an undergraduate in the late
1940s and began running with the
group in 1973.
"One of the joys of the Ancients
is a definite lack of seriousness,"
he said.
The runners do have a compet
itive attitude and like to push each
other, but they also enjoy the
social side of running. They hold
social functions such as a chili
party in the fall, a beer party in
the spring and a picnic in the sum
mer. The members also award
humorous honors to each other at
their gatherings.
One of the more coveted
awards is the Golden Jock award,
which has been passed around for
the last twenty years. The "tro
phy" is a giant jockstrap adorned
with medals, which was once
given for athletic prowess, but is
now mainly a means to convey
good-natured scorn and ridicule.
The current winner, 48-year-old
inventor Jan Krieg, known locally
as Dr. Technology, has been run
ning with the Ancients for four
years.
A new award that is only being
presented for the second year is

the Golden Jog Bra award. The
winner this year, 38-year-old
Lynn Macy, an Ancient for 13
years, guessed that she won the
award because of her team spirit
and dedication.
Many other awards have been
handed out such as the "Win is to
Win" award, given for the largest
margin of victory in a race, and
others just made up on a whim,
such as the "Flying Start Award,"
or the "Leathery Old Man
Award."
The Ancients show their appre
ciation by regularly donating to
the Friends of Stanford Track
fund and supporting Stanford
running in general.
The AFA tradition was born in
1964 when Stanford Professors
James Gere, Dave Stevenson and
Alan Waterman met while run
ning at Angell Field. Since then,
hundreds of runners have shared
in this special experience.
The ages of the members cur
rently range from the mid-20s to
the mid-60s. Such a wide range in
age can cause compatibility diffi
culties.
"My problem these days is try
ing to keep up with the guys," said
former Stanford mile-record-hold
er Norman Lloyd. "Unfortunately,
as you get older, you lose speed."
Undergraduates rarely run
with the group, and oftentimes
join the Stanford Running Club
instead, said Prof. Carpenter.
At one time, the Ancients actual
ly won a national clearinghouse
competition for intercollegiate fac
ulty-staff running teams, but now
enter fewer competitions as a team.
They do hold competitions within
the group such as "farewell" runs
when a member leaves, but these
are mainly for fun.
"In any relay we have, we don't
consider it successful unless one
or two teams get lost or run in the
wrong direction," explained Car
penter.
The Ancients' main group com
petition is the recently held Intra
mural Cross Country meet, which
they unofficially won by capturing
15 of the top 24 places. They were
also largely responsible for having
the race moved from the soccer
fields to the lush golf course years
ago, said Carpenter
One self-described "maniacal
Angell Field Ancient" is George
Behlmer, a professor at the Uni
versity of Washington. "This is an
organization with amazing tenta
cles," he said.
Behlmer started running as a
Stanford graduate student in the
mid-1970s and has since returned
frequently during vacations and
summers to run with the group.
"This place is second home," he
said of his association — "it's part
social, part athletic, and part state
of mind."
On the bulletin board outside
the men's locker room in dank
Encina Gym, a small sign mysteri
ously proclaims "ANGELL FIELD
ANCIENTS."
The Ancients, as they are affec
tionately known, are a motley
group of Stanford faculty, staff,
alumni and graduate students
who run together throughout the
year.
They meet every weekday at
12:15 p.m. on Angell Field, except
for Wednesday when they meet in
the stadium. Usually they run on
the golf course on Mondays, in the
foothills on Tuesdays, and hold
