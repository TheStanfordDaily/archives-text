# Semantics crucial in newest budget process
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
Not everyone can be a budget
hawk.
But while the technicalities of
budget-cutting might cause the eyes
of most to glaze over, the impact of
such cuts — higher tuition, shorter
library hours, fewer drama produc
tions — are enough to keep anyone
up at night.
So while Provost Condoleezza
Rice's latest round of cuts may not
seem dramatic at first glance, their
aims do differ in subtle but signifi
cant respects from past efforts.
Some of those departures are dis
tinguishable only by mere shifts in
wording, yet they alter the way in
which University budgeting will be
conducted in the future.
The following contains defini
tions and rudimentary explanations
of some of the terms that promise to
be central to the discussion of Rice's
proposals:
• Rice has mandated that future
funding of academic and adminis
trative units must be based on rev
enue-driven budget models, rather
than on cost-driven budget models,
which are used now.
Under cost-driven budgeting, a
unit would calculate and report its
total costs for a given year, and the
University would then "scramble
for sources of revenue" to cover
them, explained Tim Warner, Uni
versity budget director.
The new proposal calls for fiscal
decisions to be made in the reverse
order: by first discerning the unit's
expected revenue, and then tailoring
expenditures to meet that figure.
As illogical as cost-driven budget
ing might sound now, Warner said
the approach "worked in that period
when one could expect that revenue
would be growing by fairly good
clips."
However, cost-driven accounting
in recent years also "partly explains
tuition hikes," Warner said, as the
University sought to achieve rev
enue parity with spiraling expenses.
So while the shift in budget cal
culation might mean a slowdown of
tuition hikes, it could also require
re-examination of programs and
services that much of the communi
ty now takes for granted.
• The current proposal also calls

on the academic schools to provide
consolidated budgets which take
into account both restricted and
unrestricted funds.
Unrestricted funds, which total
$469 million, or 30 percent of the
University's consolidated budget,
are considered "operating" money,
which can be used to fund any func
tion of the University.
Restricted funds are gifts, con
tracts and grants designated for par
ticular academic projects. These
funds vary in levels of restriction,
sometimes earmarked for highly
specific pursuits, sometimes simply
to a particular school or department.
In the past, Warner said, depart
ments did not always factor restrict
ed allocations into their budgets.
Instead, they "relied heavily on
unrestricted funds" to cover over
head costs that might accompany
projects using restricted funds.
But in recent years, the "growth
rates of restricted funds has out
paced those of unrestricted funds,"
placing an increased strain on the
unrestricted side.
"Bills still need to be paid, lights
still need to be turned on," Warner
said. "We have a major deficit facing
us in the unrestricted area of the
University."
• A recurring theme in every
budget-cutting exercise is the need
for administrative restructuring as
a way to trim budgets, with "admin
istrative" referring to any program
or office not falling under the rubric
of an academic school.
"Restructuring is looking at
what services are provided and how
well (units] are doing it," Warner
said. "We have to first determine
whether these services should [con
tinue] to be provided, and if so, to
come up with different ways of pro
viding them."
That might include scaling down
services, or collapsing several duties
into a single position.
However, this round of cuts will
not likely entail wide-scale elimina
tion of positions, primarily because
"the fat in the budget is gone" as a
result of past efforts.
Warner said restructuring will be
the most significant — maybe the
only — way of saving money from
administration. And that in turn
could mean tougher decisions on the
academic side this time around.
