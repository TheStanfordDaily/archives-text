# Senators walk out during ASSU debate
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
After its meeting fell apart
amid shouting and profanity, the
ASSU Senate last night failed to
come to a consensus over whether
students are being excluded from
participating in senate functions.
The debate centered around a
bill that would prohibit non-sena
tors from serving as chairs of sen
ate standing committees. The
issue arose when Tom Costello, a
fourth-year graduate student, was
chosen as chair of the senate's Ad
ministration and Rules Commit
tee, despite the fact that he is not a
senator.
"Basically, I'm just a student
who came along and wanted to be
involved," Costello said. "Basical
ly, they changed the rules in order
to exclude me."
But graduate senator Nawwar
Kasrawi, the bill's author, argued
that "a committee chair should be
someone who is accountable and
available — someone who is elect
ed by the students."
"It's great to have people serve
on the committees, but the chair

of the committee is a position of
responsibility," he said.
But graduate senator Neil
Crellin disagreed, saying the bill
would exclude students from par
ticipating in student government.
"It sends a clear signal to me,"
Crellin said. "If you're a grad stu
dent, you're not welcomed by the
ASSU."
The debate become so heated
that all but 11 of the approximate
ly 30 senators present left the
meeting — some in protest of the
bill's intent, and others in anger
over the meeting's disorder.
Despite the fact that only 11
senators are needed needed as a
quorum to conduct senate busi
ness, the issue will be decided at the
next meeting because the remain
ing senators chose to table the bill.
"It's inappropriate for the 11 of
us to decide on this issue," said
graduate senator Sanford Dickert,
who threatened to leave the meet
ing without a full quorum if the
remaining senators proceeded to
vote on the issue.
The senate also approved the
budget for the Axe Committee's
multimedia presentation, which
will be held the Thursday before
Big Game in front of Hoover
Tower as a replacement for the
Big Game Bonfire.
Because the committee lost
12.7 percent of its funding to spe
cial-fee refunds, approximately
two-thirds of its reserve money
will be used to fund the program,
a decision which ASSU Financial
Manager Brian Hillger described

as "horrible."
"This special fee crisis may
occur again next year," Hillger
said. "This decision is basically
covering their deficits with
reserves which they may need
later on down the road."
But Steve Zika, the commit
tee's chair, said the money is vital
to the committee's efforts.
"At this date we don't know if
the bonfire will be back next
year," he said. "We want to want
to try and start a new tradition.
"Without the additional money,
the lighting will be much less sig
nificant — we'll have to cut a great
deal off the event,"he added.
