# All eyes on the Quad
## Morning TV show awakens Stanford spirit 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
A select group of Stanford students had a
brief moment in the national spotlight yester
day when they got a chance to say good morn
ing to the rest of the country.
About 400 students showed up in the Quad
at 7 a.m. for a two-hour taping of "Good Morn
ing America,"the ABC morning show. The
broadcast from the University, which was the
third stop on the show's "Great Pacific Coast

Highway Bus Tour," was scheduled to air
today at 7 a.m.
For two hours, co-hosts Joan Lunden and
Charlie Gibson entertained students and gave
viewers across the country a taste of life at
Stanford.
Interviews with various campus personali
ties — such as football coach Bill Walsh,
Olympic gold medalist Summer Sanders and
Distinguished Hoover Fellow and former Sec
retary of State George Shultz — were inter
spersed with segments examining a Silicon

Valley graphics firm, earthquakes and public
education in California.
All of those interviewed told Lunden and
Gibson that they enjoyed life at the University.
"It's a great place to learn and be stimulat
ed. There are so many different disciplines,"
Shultz said. He told Gibson that he should
move to California when he leaves his job as
the show's co-host.
When asked about combining athletics with

academics, Walsh told Lunden that
Stanford's athletes were among
the best. "Few people are outstand
ing athletes and students, but
when you do get that, it's fantastic.
... we have true student athletes,"
he said.
Walsh's appearance also gave
the student audience an opportuni
ty to chant "Beat Cal" on the air
just before the program went to a
commercial break.
Throughout the show, the hosts
had brief exchanges with the stu
dents who made up the audience.
While the camera was on, Lunden
and Gibson asked students about
their reasons for choosing Stan
ford, their opinions on its high
tuition, and their views on job
prospects after graduation.

But during breaks for commer
cials and news, the hosts were
more informal, engaging the audi
ence in lighthearted banter.
"We have a young man over
here who is studying for a 10:30
midterm ... at least he says he's
studying. I'd say that was pretty
gutsy," said Gibson, who later
threatened students with a test
after the show and jokingly claimed
that Harvard students had more
enthusiasm.
For their part, audience mem
bers said they were pleased about
the exposure the University
received from the show.
"It's nice that Stanford is in the
spotlight. We're a model school —
not that we don't have a lot to learn
— but we deserve the national
recognition," said sophomore
Mona Tekchandani.
Others were more excited about
their own chances to be on nation
al television.

"When I was younger and they
filmed TV segments in the city, I'd
walk back and forth behind them
trying to get on. I'm hoping this
will be my big break," said sopho
more Katie Friedman.
Several students also said they
were impressed with the efficiency
of the show's technicians.
"It's neat to see how they put
the whole thing together. It's
funny how much time and energy
go into making these people look
normal," said senior Andi Marmor.
Despite the apparent complicat
ed nature of the operation, techni
cians — who are mostly local work
ers contracted for this tour — said
that setting up at Stanford was eas
ier than in other situations they
have encountered during this trip.
Compared to Big Sur and the
beach at Carmel, the other places
the show has been to this week,
Stanford's campus "is very accom
modating, especially because it's

flat here," said Mel Kekuewa, a
technician from Los Angeles who
had been hired to provide the light
ing and camera equipment.
Kekuewa also said that setting
up in the midst of bikers riding
through the Quad had proved to be
as much fun as a challenge.
"It's part of the fun, having kids
ride over the power cables," he
said.
A few students from each student
residence were selected by their resi
dent assistants to attend the pro
gram, said senior Victor Madrigal,
who was in charge of recruiting
audience members. Madrigal said
that this method resulted in "a good
mix" of students.
"We didn't advertise since we
wanted a small crowd, but it
worked out fine. Since it's such an
early hour, the people we got are
the dedicated and devoted students
who want to show Stanford off," he
said.
