As the hosts of "Good Morning
America," Joan Lunden and Charlie
Gibson have been on location at places
all over the country. But both agree
that filming on a college campus makes
a great show.
"Any campus is terrific, because the
kids are so 'up,' " said Gibson in an inter
view after the show.

And although Lunden has enjoyed the
rest of her California trip, she said that she
particularly liked being at Stanford. "The
tour has been great, but l r .ay was differ
ent and special. The students were fabu
lous — energetic and well-spoken," she
said.
In the past few years, "Good Morning
America" has traveled to several differ
ent schools, including Harvard, West


Vincent Ho — Daily
Point, the Naval Academy at
Annapolis and the University of
Tennessee at Chattanooga. At all
of them, Lunden and Gibson said
that students lent great energy to
the show.
"The first time, we didn't know

what we'd get. We thought we
might have protests. But the kids
really got into the spirit of it," Gib
son said.
According to the hosts, Stanford
students were just as enthusiastic
as their counterparts at other
schools.
"We didn't have as large a
crowd as at Harvard, but we got
tremendous energy out of the
Stanford students. These kids
were great," Gibson said.
