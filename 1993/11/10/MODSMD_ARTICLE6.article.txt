# Graduate creates niche in Prague literary scene
## 
### Colleen Krueger Editorial staff 
Expatriates forging their own creative
subculture in Europe — it's a defining
characteristic of our national literature,
with American artists still clinging to ro
manticized notions of Paris in the '30s or
the Israel of Twain and Melville.
The search for this outside perspective
led writer and Stanford graduate Michael
I.ee to Eastern Europe over a year ago.
"You hear all the hype about I Vague.
There's thus wistful nostalgia about a collec
tion of expatriate writers clustered in smoky
coffee houses," he said. "It Ux>k me two or
three days to decide it was kind of silly "
Ironically, it was only after exiting the
Bohemian scene of "beatnik U.S. writ
ers" that found his own creative
niche in Prague — as founder and editor

of the quarterly literary journal "Trafi
ka."
"Prague was being looked at" in the in
ternational writing community, Lee said.
"People were waiting for something to
come out of there."
While "Trafika" — named afler the
generic Czech tobacco and magazine
stores — is based in the former Czechoslo
vakia, the magazine tries to "incorporate a
lot of people who are famous in their own
national literary circles" into an interna
tional literary review.
"We didn't want to limit ourselves to a
particular focus like local magazines,"
Lee said But getting "Trafika" to be rec
ognized as a primarily international col
laboration has sometimes been difficult.
"We were given a one-page ad with an
Australian society of writers and we ended
up getting all of these submissions from

Australians writmg about Eastern Eu
rope," Lee said. "Prague is the last thing
someone from Australia should be writing
about."
Lee, who earned a bachelor's degree in
political science in 1989 and a master's de
gree in Eastern European studies in 1990,
spent a year in Boalt Hall l*aw School be
fore getting a fellowship to research law in
Budapest.
"After the third or fourth day of law
school I figured out that I wanted to get out
of there and do something," l>ee said. "Re
searching in Budapest turned out to be my
ticket."
Afler finishing his work in Budapest, he
traveled to the "pastoral" city of Prague,
which he said was a welcome change from
the polluted and "overwhelmingly urban"
Hungarian environment.
I.<ee met co-founder and editor Alfredo

Sanchez while tending bar in Prague, and
approached him with the idea of starting a
literary journal.
"At first, he said no," Lee said. "But
after a few drinks — everything happens
over drinks in Prague — he ended up
agreeing to the idea "
Lee, who sees himself as "first a writer,
then an editor and reluctantly a publisher
last," still finds himself challenged by the
bureaucratic aspects of marketing and
funding the journal, which has a circulation
of about 2,000.
"We're being funded right now mostly
through private donations," Lee said.
"But we're not considered a part of any
community. Even though we're registered
in New York as a non-profit organization,
we're not considered to be from America or

from Prague."
Lee hopes that the journal will
become easier to run as time goes
on, leaving him more time for his

first love: fiction writing.
"Meeting writers and spending
time with other people's work has
helped me develop a healthy sense
of who I am as a writer," Lee said.
"I've heard the phrase that 'Science
is what scientists do.' Well, I'm a
writer, and writing is what writers
do."
