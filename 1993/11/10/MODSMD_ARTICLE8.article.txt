## Gore and Perot trade barbs over NAFTA 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a con
tentious, finger-pointing debate, Vice
President A 1 Gore said last night that
Ross Perot will profit from the defeat
of the North American Free Trade
Agreement. Perot dismissed the
charge as "propaganda" to defend a
deal that would punish American
workers.
The prime-time showdown was com
bative from the outset, reflecting the
high stakes in an extraordinary fight in
which the Clinton administration is
about 25 votes short with the pivotal
House vote just a week away.
House Speaker Thomas Foley rated
NAFTA's chances of passing at "50-50."
Hours before the debate, the White
House got a much-needed boost —
NAFTA endorsements from five House
Democrats who had been undecided. A
sixth, Rep. Jim Bacchus of Florida,
announced his support just as the
debate got under way.

The debate on CNN's "Larry King
Live" was but a minute old when Perot
accused Gore of interrupting him. Ten
sion crackled throughout the 90-minute
program as Gore and Perot traded a bar
rage of charges, some of them substan
tive, others more personal.
Gore said Perot supported the trade
deal in 1991 but then flip-flopped as a
presidential candidate last year "to
bring out the politics of fear." Later, he
upped the ante, saying a Perot family
business in Texas stood to make huge
gains as a trade center should NAFTA
be defeated.
"If NAFTA is defeated, then this
free-trade zone that he has is still in
business," Gore said. "If it's good
enough for him, why isn't it good
enough for the rest of the country."
Perot was quick to fire back, denying
his opposition to the agreement was
motivated by any personal or family
financial stake.

The debate was the climax of a fren
zied day of NAFTA jockeying in the cap
ital, led by President Clinton himself.
In a role reversal, Clinton served as
warmup act for Gore, fiercely disputing
arguments that dropping tariffs and
other trade barriers with Mexico and
Canada would send American manufac
turing jobs rushing south to low-wage
Mexico.
And, in a line Gore would echo hours
later, Clinton said America would be
stripped of its credibility in stalled trade
talks with Europe and Japan should
NAFTA be defeated.
"So the stakes here are very large,
indeed," Clinton said. "If we don't do
this with our closest neighbor, it's going
to be hard for us to have the credibility
to make the case for the world."
Perot scoffed that such an argument
was part of the administration's "sky is
falling routine." Every time Clinton falls
behind, he claims "the presidency is at

stake," Perot said.
Seated side-by-side, Gore and Perot
answered questions from King, fought
among themselves and also took calls
from viewers in the United States and
abroad, including one from Croatia.
The Gore salvos were part of a strat
egy that was evident from the outset —
personalize the NAFTA fight with Perot
in hopes of tarring the trade agreement
with his negatives and convincing
wavering Democrats to choose their
president over Perot.
From the earliest moments, Gore
had Perot on the defensive — demand
ing that he say what he would do to
make the treaty better. Perot had no
answer.
But for all the theatrics, Gore and
Perot broke no new substantive ground,
trading familiar arguments over
whether the trade deal would kill or cre
ate jobs and raise Mexico's labor and
environmental standards.
