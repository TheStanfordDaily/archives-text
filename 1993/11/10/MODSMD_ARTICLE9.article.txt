Strong stance against harassment
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Supreme Court
strengthened workers' protection against sexual
harassment yesterday, ruling unanimously that
employers can be forced to pay monetary damages
even when employees suffer no psychological harm.
"So long as the environment would reasonably
be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abu
sive, there is no need for it also to be psychologi
cally injurious," Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
wrote as the court revived a Tennessee woman's
lawsuit against her ex-boss.
The woman said her boss, among other things,
had asked her to retrieve coins from his front
pants p<x:ket, suggested they go to a local motel to
negotiate her pay raise and asked if she gained a
sales contract by providing sexual favors.
"It's a big win for women," Marcia Greenberg
er of the National Women's Law Center said of
the 9-0 ruling.
