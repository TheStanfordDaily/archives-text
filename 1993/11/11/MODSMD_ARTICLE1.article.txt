# 'Greater cause for hope' in Middle East
## Former heads of state discuss prospects for peace 
### Matt Gregory Staff writer 
Five dignitaries from around the
world — including former Israeli Pres
ident Chaim Herzog and recent Soviet
Foreign Minister Alexander Bessmert
nykh — expressed reserved optimism
that peace in the Middle East can be at
tained at a discussion last night in
Kresge Auditorium.
The September handshake between
Israeli President Yitzak Rabin and
PLO leader Yassir Arafat "was an elec
tric moment, but we all know that
there's lots more to do," said Distin
guished Hoover Fellow and former Sec
retary of State George Shultz, who
moderated the discussion.
"I believe we do have greater cause
for hope than ever before," said former
Australian Prime Minister Bob
Hawke. "We've seen too many lives
lost, too many resources wasted" since
the creation of Israel in 1948.

Still, Hawke warned that the peace
process may hit snags in the future be
cause of factors like the poor economic
conditions that Palestinians face.
TThese difficulties 1 present a sense of
challenge, but they will also be a signif
icant cause of tension," Hawke said.
Herzog agreed, saying that "the
Middle East picture is a complex one,
fraught with dangers on the one hand
and pregnant with hope on the other."
He added that the current mood in
Israel "certainly is not euphoric. ...
[Hope for peace is] tempered by con
cern and anxiety.
"The Palestinian population lives
under a reign of terror created by their
own extremists," Herzog said.
Bessmertnykh said a peaceful reso
lution is still a long way off. "The agree
ment is not perfect — there are still
many gaps and holes in it,"he said.
However, Bessmertnykh added that
"if the gaps and holes I werel filled now,
it would be a diplomatic failure" be

cause many aspects need discussion.
He said that "impressive results" so
far prove that the U.S.-Russian post-
Cold War strategy is working.
Herzog also discussed other success
es related to the Middle East peace
process, such as an economic confer
ence in Copenhagen with representa :
tives from 14 Arab states that ended
yesterday.
According to Herzog, conference at
tendees arranged financing for 35 joint
ventures in 10 fields to help the Pales
tinian population. He hoped that even
tually a "Middle East common market"
could be formed that would help all the
nations in the region.
"The area can cease to be the main
export market" for world arms dealers,
Herzog said.
The panel stressed that Israel and
the PLO must be patient to reach a so
lution. "One thing is clear to me," Bess-

mertnykh said. "Getting peace in
that area is a stage-by-stage, long
and painful process."
He added that other countries
must get involved in the peace
process for it to be successful.
Former West German Chan
cellor Helmut Schmidt focused on
the common traits that the par
ties' religions share. "Why should

it be impossible [for them] to
learn to understand each other
and tolerate each other?"
Although the collapse of the
Soviet Union helped the peace
process, Schmidt said it created
more problems that countries in
the region need to address. "In
the future, we will give a wider
meaning to the term 'the Middle
East' " to mean more than just
Israel and its neighbors, he said,
explaining that several former
Soviet republics should be includ
ed.

Schmidt said that even if peace
with Israel is attained, there will
still be conflict in the expanded
Middle East region.
All five dignitaries at the dis
cussion are members of the Insti
tute for International Studies
Advisory Council, which is meet
ing this week to discuss Stan
ford's role in changing world
affairs. The council — which
meets approximately every 18

mertnykh said. "Getting peace in
that area is a stage-by-stage, long
and painful process."
He added that other countries
must get involved in the peace
process for it to be successful.
Former West German Chan
cellor Helmut Schmidt focused on
the common traits that the par
ties' religions share. "Why should

it be impossible [for them] to
learn to understand each other
and tolerate each other?"
Although the collapse of the
Soviet Union helped the peace
process, Schmidt said it created
more problems that countries in
the region need to address. "In
the future, we will give a wider
meaning to the term 'the Middle
East' " to mean more than just
Israel and its neighbors, he said,
explaining that several former
Soviet republics should be includ
ed.

Schmidt said that even if peace
with Israel is attained, there will
still be conflict in the expanded
Middle East region.
