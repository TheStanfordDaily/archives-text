The product of last
week's meeting of the Stu
dent Advisory Group on
Undergraduate Education was a
simple decision for the ASSU
appointed co-chairs, Eddie Garcia
and Ying-Ying Goh, to specify the
group's goal and function before
the next meeting.
In their proposal, Garcia and
Goh should make clear that the
SAGUE needs to be both pro
active and reactive if it is to have
a definitive influence on the com
mission's final report.
Some members were con
cerned that the SAGUE has no
pro-active potential to affect the
commission's agenda. While this
is a valid concern, there is no
reason for it to become a reality.
This quarter, the Commission
on Undergraduate Education
intends only to decide which
issues their report will address.
Luz Herrera and David Lowell,
the two students on the commis

sion, are full members, and have
every right to incorporate their
own issues with those already
decided upon.
Therefore, the SAGUE has the
potential to work closely with
Herrera and Lowell to include its
concerns on the commission's
agenda for the future. It should
do so.
On the other hand, the
SAGUE also needs to have a
good system in place for collect
ing reactive student opinion
before the commission begins its
full study. Poll results presented
to each commission member at
each meeting will have a power
ful effect on the ensuing discus
sion.
This combination of goals will
allow both the SAGUE and the
students on the commission to
effectively and professionally
influence the final commission
report on behalf of student
interests.
