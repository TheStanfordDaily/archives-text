# Fighting finals blues
## 
### 
IT'S THAT TIME of year again.
Time for Orientation relation
ships to break up and time for
the winter blues to set in.
With the stress of finals and the
dawn of the rainy season closing
in, Stanford students should know
their options if there comes a time
when an outside source might
help them to cope with feelings
that interfere with their school
work and lives.
Often students turn to their
friends to discuss their depression
or other problems, but sometimes
issues are too personal or serious
to feel comfortable discussing
them with people seen every day.
But there are other people to
talk to. For example, Counseling
and Psychological Services (CAPS),
located on the second floor of Cow
ell Student Health Center, is pre
pared to help with individual issues
like immediate or past sexual
assault, cultural problems and anx

iety. Both homosexual and hetero
sexual couples are encouraged to
use these services. There are also
quarterly support groups that dis
cuss common problems like stress
management, social skills, and
depression. The number for CAPS
is 723-3785 or 723-4861.
The Bridge, consisting entirely
of volunteer student counselors
trained in peer issues and suicide
counseling, is another service to
consider. Like CAPS they offer a
hotline for 24-hour, seven-day-a
week access to a counselor. The
Bridge can be reached at 723-
3392.
It's not only OK to use these
services, it's free.
The University should remem
ber when budget-cutting time
comes to protect the excellent ser
vices Stanford offers, thereby rec
ognizing that mental health can
not and should not take a back
seat to other priorities.
