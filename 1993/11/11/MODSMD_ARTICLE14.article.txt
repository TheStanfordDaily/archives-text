## Stanford's Quad watchers 
### 
MAY DAY in the former Soviet
Union was an occasion of great rit
ual. The troops would march past
a reviewing stand of the Kremlin elite.
Across the world, scholars would then ana
lyze the array of old men on the platform.
By looking at this symbolic positioning —
who was missing, who was standing close
to whom — the so-called Kremlin-watch
ers slowly evolved lengthy interpretations
of current Kremlin power politics and
future policy directions.
As the Clinton team took power, even
the most minor conversational fragments
were scrutinized and analyzed.
Similarly, Stanford has its own Krem
lin-watchers, those who make meaning of
seemingly routine actions of a remote
leadership, in order to understand future
directions and policy priorities.
In both corporate and university cul
tures, offices are a much-interpreted sym
bol. By asking questions — Who has
offices in Building 10, the Main Quad
Office of the President and Provost? How
has this changed from when Donald
Kennedy was president? — the pundit can
draw conclusions about how the style and
priorities of given administrations differ.
In the two most recent administrations,
the president, the provost (chief academic
officer), the staff of the Board of Trustees
and their support staff have been in Build
ing 10. Under President Kennedy, the
Office of Multicultural Development, the
dean of Graduate Studies and several assis

tants to the president who were responsible
for meeting with students were also housed
in Building 10. Under President Gerhard
Casper, they have been replaced by the
dean of Research and Graduate Policy, the
director of University Budgets, the chief
financial officer and a chief of staff.
What could an armchair analyst derive
from this?
1. The multicultural emphasis of the
Kennedy years has been put on the back
burner. Sharon Parker, the director of the
Office of Multicultural Development,
resigned last spring amid great controver
sy. Several months before she resigned,
her office was moved out of Building 10.
This loss of status may have precipitated
her departure.
2. Financial planning and management
are paramount concerns for the new
administration. The vice president for
finance and the chief budget officer are
both located a stone's throw from the
president. Moving the Office of the Dean
of Research into Building 10 makes the
financial dependence of the University on
research income explicitly important.
3. Monitoring student concerns is rela
tively unimportant. Kennedy had assis
tants who spent many hours meeting
with students and trying to understand
trends in student concerns. Requests to
see the president are now filtered through
the Dean of Students' Office.
Both figuratively and literally the
"open door" has been shut. One of the two

doors to the building has been converted
to an emergency exit. There is no longer
an unmonitored entryway. All traffic is
now routed past the receptionist. Security
concerns prompted this change, but the
symbolism is unmistakable.
The point is not simply that clever peo
ple spend their time making these analy
ses. Rather, in any complex organization,
in times of change and uncertainty, those
removed from the leadership will look to
symbolic action to understand the cli
mate. One lesson we can learn from the
example of the Soviet Union, as addition
al information is becoming available, is
that many Kremlin-watchers were wrong.
Their analysis of symbols led to the wrong
conclusions.
Does President Casper intend to send
these messages to the community? I hon
estly do not know. Stanford is still getting
to know him, and trying to understand
him. In the absence of more fully devel
oped direct communication, it is inevitable
for people to engage in interpreting sym
bols. President Casper needs to be aware
of the signals he is sending, and make con
certed efforts to counteract them, if they
do not reflect his true beliefs.

Chris hopes this column will get her sent to
the gulag.
