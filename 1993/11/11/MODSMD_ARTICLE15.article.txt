## Ceremony shows a commitment to pursuit of happiness 
### 
A BASIC RIGHT in this country
is the pursuit of happiness.
Relationships, whether simple
loving friendships or life-long exlusive
partnerships, are a cornerstone of
happiness.
We, as gay men, lesbians and bisex
uals, fall in love with members of the
same sex. The public declaration of
our love is nothing more than a funda
mental acknowledgement of the fact
that we, too, are human beings.
Unfortunately, we are rarely granted
the right to declare our love and com
mitment publicly. Most organized reli
gions preach that we should not have
relationships with members of the
same sex and refuse to bless our
unions.
What most religious organizations
fail to understand is that we are not

asking for mere "sensitivity" or even
"tolerance." Most of us no longer care
whether this or that church thinks
homosexuality is a sin. Our reason is
simple: we must be afforded the same
basic human rights and privileges as
those enjoyed by heterosexuals.
Memorial Church Assoc. Dean
Diana Akiyama and Dean Robert
Gregg had the vision and courage to
see through the fear and confusion
homosexuality inspires in some peo
ple. We applaud Akiyama in particular
for performing the recent ceremony in
Memorial Church in which two gay
men declared their love for one anoth
er. We hope that soon a real gay mar
riage will be possible, but this is a
legal issue only the state can rectify.
If same-sex commitment cere
monies are "insensitive," "insulting"

and "blasphemous" to some Catholics,
should we hide and deny ourselves
basic rights in order to appease those
who, for religious or moral reasons,
would deny us our basic rights? If our
open existence insults some people,
then some people will have to be
insulted.
We hope that Angel R. Puerta will
apologize to the Memorial Church for
his outrageous condemnation of the
recent ceremony. His suggestion, in
an Oct. 21 letter to The Daily, that
the same-sex commitment ceremony
was designed to offend Catholics is
ludicrous. The commitment ceremony
simply fulfilled the promise of afford
ing the basic human right of public
declaration of love. The sexuality of
the two participants neither blas
phemes nor insults. The sacredness of

Memorial Church is in no way altered
by such a union; rather, it is
enhanced.
It bothers many of us to know that
our sexuality and public declaration of
same-sex love are offensive to some
people, but what would Puerta have
us do? Disappear? Live in shame?
Never set foot in a church? Avoid any
public displays of affection that might
make people uncomfortable?
Sorry, but we've been there, and we
won't play those games anymore. We
are not asking for special rights, bend
over-backwards tolerance or even spe
cial sensitivity. We simply want to
affirm our basic human rights without
apologies.
