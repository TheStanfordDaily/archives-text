# Stanford and Tresidder provide eating options to University students
## 
### 
The Nov. 4 editorial addressing the
so-called "monopoly" on food services
at Tresidder Union missed the dinner
bell in assessing food services at Stan
ford.
The total food service sales at Stan
ford exceed $35 million annually.
Food services at Tresidder, managed
by Bon Appetit Management Company
and overseen by University staff,
account for only 13 percent of total
sales.
This includes the Cafe, Baker
Street, Corner Pocket, Coffee House
and Bon Appetit/Tresidder Catering.
The remaining 87 percent is divided
among a large number of independent
food services including University
Housing & Dining, departmental
lounges in the School of Education,

Law School, Graduate School of Busi
ness, School of Medicine, Department
of Psychology, Department of Political
Science, School of Engineering, the
Faculty Club, Bookstore Cafe, self
ops, co-ops, Toyon Eating Clubs, Gov
ernor's Corner Dining Societies and
Tresidder Express, operated by the
Bookstore.
Not included in these numbers are
the sales from the Stanford commu
nity at the plethora of restaurants on
El Camino and in the surrounding
area.
The Stanford community, and espe
cially students, have a full range of
choices based on cost, quality, variety
and location. In an effort to provide
even more choices, there are several
exciting changes being planned for
Tresidder for winter quarter. Through
the efforts of Bon Appetit, and in
response to student requests, Taco
Bell is planned to open in January
1994 in the space currently occupied
by the Recreation Center service
counter.

The Tresidder Dollars debit card
program will be expanded this winter
to include Taco Bell and a national
brand pizza delivery service. Negotia
tions are also underway with the
Stanford Bookstore to include Tresid
der Express in the program.
The Daily asserts that the food ser
vices in Tresidder should simply be
contracted "to anyone who is willing
to pay the highest cost." The other
side to that reasoning is that the one
willing to pay the highest cost charges
the highest prices.
Tresidder Union is committed to
provide a wide range of food options at
prices which reflect good value. We
encourage participation in this process
through customer feedback, and par
ticipation in the Tresidder Union
Board, one of the vehicles for stu
dents, faculty and staff to provide
input into the operation of the Stan
ford Union.
