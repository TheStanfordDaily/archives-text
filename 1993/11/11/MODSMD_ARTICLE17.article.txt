# Ground squirrels must not be neglected in the Sand Hill Road conflict
## 
### 
I read with interest in the Nov. 3
Daily about the University's interest and
concern over the tiger salamander living
in Lake Lagunita to the extent that they
are willing to expend $12,000 of the
water budget, and are considering the
elimination of disking the lake bed to
preserve its habitat.
Opponents of Stanford's proposed
development of Sand Hill West take
heed! Enlist the environmentalists on
your side. Point out that building in this
field would endanger and rout the hun
dreds of ground squirrels now living
there.
Preserve the open space off Sand
Hill Road!
