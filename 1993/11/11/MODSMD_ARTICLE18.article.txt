# Best golfers battle in SC
## 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
The competition is getting tougher for the
Stanford menu's golf team.
This weekend, in what promises to be their
biggest challenge to date, the seventh-ranked
links ters will compete with the rest of the nation's
top 18 teams at the Golf World / Palmetto Dunes
Collegiate Open, held in Hilton Head, S.C.
"We've been practicing well all week, and I
think we look pretty good," said freshman Conrad
Ray. "Everyone seems ready, and I think we'll
have a good showing."
With the top schools in the nation represented,
the Cardinal squad hopes to solidify its position as
a national power this weekend. Oklahoma State,
Oklahoma, Nevada-Las Vegas, Texas, Arizona
and Ohio State all rank ahead of Stanford and will
provide the Farm's golfers with a difficult test.
The weather could play a key factor in the Car
dinal's chances for victory. The squad has typical
ly fared better in warmer climates, and the fore
cast for Hilton Head predicts similar cold and
rainy conditions to those that held Stanford to a
disappointing fourth-place finish in the
Quintessence Classic in Chicago last month.
The tournament marks the end of a highly suc
cesful fall season for the Cardinal. The linksters
opened the year ranked fifth in the nation and
have finished first in two of their five fall tourna
ments, including the William Tucker Invitational
in Albuquerque, N.M, held Sept. 25.
Stanford comes off an impressive victory at
home two weekends ago in the Stanford Shootout.
The linksters turned in the best performance in
school history and annihilated the 20-team field.
The squad set school records with a single-round
score of 276 and a three-day total of 848. With
over 100 golfers competing at the Stanford Golf
Course, an amazing total of four Cardinal players
finished in the top nine.
Notah Begay 111, who finished second at the
Stanford Shootout, will travel to South Carolina
along with Brad Lanning, William Yanigisawa,
Casey Martin and Steve Burdick. Four of these
golfers' top five scores will count toward the team
standings in this weekend's tournament.
Stanford's No. 7 GolfweekyTaylor Made Poll
ranking places them second in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, just behind Arizona. Arizona State,
ranked 15th, could also challenge the Cardinal for
the Pac-10 title.
Stanford coach Wally Goodwin hopes the thrill
of their recent record-setting performance will not
go to the golfers' heads. "If we keep our minds on
the game I feel we'll play great," he said. "I just
hope we don't get carried away with [last week's]
win."
