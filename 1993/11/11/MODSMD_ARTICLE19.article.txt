## High hopes for the future Hoopsters net tall recruiting classes 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
"Wait until next year" now means a
whole lot more for the men's and
women's basketball teams.
Both teams secured letters of intent
yesterday from a number of top-ranked
high-school seniors — including two of
the tallest players in Stanford history
— on the opening day of the early sign

ing period.
For the men, Tim Young, a 7-foot-l
inch center from Santa Cruz, and Mark
Madsen, a 6-foot-8-inch forward from
Danville, signed written commitments
to come to Stanford.
On the women's side, the new
recruits include 6-foot-7-inch center
Chandra Benton, 6-foot-2-inch forward
Kristin Folkl, 6-foot guard Regan
Freuen, 6-foot-2-inch forward Heather

Owen and 6-foot-2-inch forward
Olympia Scott.
"We are signing one of our very top
recruiting classes," said women's head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "All five are
big-time players, first-round picks if
you will."
