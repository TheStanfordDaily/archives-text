## High hopes for the future Hoopsters net tall recruiting classes 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
"Wait until next year" now means a
whole lot more for the men's and
women's basketball teams.
Both teams secured letters of intent
yesterday from a number of top-ranked
high-school seniors — including two of
the tallest players in Stanford history
— on the opening day of the early sign

ing period.
For the men, Tim Young, a 7-foot-l
inch center from Santa Cruz, and Mark
Madsen, a 6-foot-8-inch forward from
Danville, signed written commitments
to come to Stanford.
On the women's side, the new
recruits include 6-foot-7-inch center
Chandra Benton, 6-foot-2-inch forward
Kristin Folkl, 6-foot guard Regan
Freuen, 6-foot-2-inch forward Heather

Owen and 6-foot-2-inch forward
Olympia Scott.
"We are signing one of our very top
recruiting classes," said women's head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "All five are
big-time players, first-round picks if
you will."

Player of the Year, is also expect
ed to play for the Cardinal volley
ball team.
"Kristin is very, very talent
ed," VanDerveer said. "She's
strong, but it's her jumping abili
ty that sets her apart. She could
play in any sport that she set her
mind to."
In Benton, the women's team
secured a center who will become

the tallest player in Cardinal his
tory, surpassing even 6-foot-5-
inch junior Anita Kaplan. She
was called the "No. 1 recruit in
the country" by Dick Vitale's
magazine.
Both of the men's recruits
have been highly touted in
national publications, with Young
ranked 90th among high school
seniors by The Sporting News
and Madsen ranked 96th. Both
players were also named to the
"Best of the West" First Team by
the Long Beach Press-Telegram.
At 7-foot-l-inch, Young

becomes the first 7-foot Stanford
player since the mid-19705, and
he will be able to fill the role of a
big man in the middle after the
graduation of 6-foot-11-inch
senior center Jim Morgan.
Madsen became a national
prospect this summer in Indi
anapolis when he turned in a
strong performance at the Nike
Camp.
But Madsen will not arrive at
Stanford until the fall of 1996,
after he completes a two-year
Mormon mission that will begin
next June.
