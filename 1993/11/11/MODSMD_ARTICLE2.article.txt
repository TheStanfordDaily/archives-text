# Budget cuts: needed, but tough to achieve
## Administrators say $20 million reduction plan will prove challenging, frustrating 
### Skip Schwartz Senior staff writer 
While some top administrators regard
Provost Condoleezza Rice's new plan to
trim the budget by $18 million to $20 mil
lion as necessary, they nevertheless feel the
cuts will be difficult to make.
"We've cut to the bone in the last two to
three years — there is little left to cut," said
Gary Ernst, dean of the School of Earth Sci
ences.
In a budget letter Rice sent to deans and
vice presidents this week, she outlined her
plan to reduce both administrative and aca
demic costs over the next three years.
The plan gives the University's central
administrative units specific guidelines on
slashing their budgets by 5 percent to 10

percent. Academic deans, however, were
not given such guidelines, but were given
recommendations to look closely at their
departments and identify cuts that would
allow for better long-term financial man
agement.
According to Ernst, dean of the Univer
sity's smallest school, "it is important to cut
administrative costs." But he said trying to
find weak academic areas within his school
will be "like trying to choose which kid to
feed to the lion."
Faculty members have had varied re
sponses to the announcement of additional
budget cuts, depending on how much they
feel their department will be burdened.
When the $43 million deficit-reduction
program began more than two
years ago, the Drama Department
was mentioned often as a depart
ment slated for elimination.
Although the department survived
the cuts, it was forced to severely
reduce its budget.
Drama Department Chair
Michael Ramsaur feels that the
department's most recent brush
with budget cuts will help it sur
vive this new round of cutting.
"I am not fearful of these cuts,"
Ramsaur said, adding that the last
process gave the department the
chance to show its importance with
in the Stanford community, and the
detrimental effects budget cuts
would have on the department.
On the other hand, Lazar Fleis
chman, chair of the Slavic Lan
guages and Literature Depart
ment, fears that further cuts could
seriously hurt the quality of teach
ing in his department.
Fleischman said his department
is "already small and under
staffed" and does not see how fur
ther cuts could be made.
Dean of the School of Humanities
and Sciences John Shoven said
Tuesday that the University's
largest school has already begun
looking at ways to restructure the
language and literature departments
and make them more efficient.

And while all admit that tough
decisions are ahead, many hope
that the University's recent spot
light on undergraduate education
will help shed light on the process.
"Hopefully the Commission on
Undergraduate Education will be
helpful in identifying academic
areas that we do excel in and oth
ers that need help. ..." while
keeping in mind the needs of both
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents, ASSU Council of Presidents
member Ron Brown said.
For some graduate schools,
though, the budget cuts are not
about specific departments but
about making cuts from the school
as a whole. Since the Law School is
considered one academic unit that
needs "to remain a general-pur
pose law school," Dean Paul Brest
said it has to look to where "it can
husband resources where we need
to grow" rather than try to fmd
weaknesses.
These same ideas also apply for
the administrative units, according
to Barbara Butterfield, vice presi
dent for faculty and staff services.
Butterfield said the University has
"to try to fmd better, less expensive
ways to do business."
Stressing the need to have
funds to ensure long-term academ
ic flexibility and investment, But
terfield said she hopes this next
round of cuts "will be done
extremely carefully and with a lot
of consciousness about our ability
to work together [in the University

as a whole] and how we can con
tribute to mutual solutions."
Individual schools will also need
to think about how the possible
reductions of central administra
tive functions will affect them,
Brest said.
Jean Fetter, assistant to the
president, said that this next round
of cuts "will be a challenge — not
our first and not our last."
As the person in charge of the
budget of the Office of the Presi
dent and Provost, Fetter said she
will make an effort to gather input
from the heads of all 16 units that
fall under the office's jurisdiction.
Brown stressed that the entire
process requires University-wide
input, especially because these cuts
will not be identified by a broad
based committee like the Cabinet
Committee on Budget and Strate
gic Planning.
Jason Snyder, another COP
member, agreed, saying that Rice
and the COP are planning regular
meetings "to make clear the stu
dent perspectives on issues."
He added that he hopes one of
the results of this streamlining will
be a reduction in tuition increases.
James Gibbons, dean of the School
of Engineering, said even though it is
going to be difficult to find where to
cut, he feels the cuts will have signifi
cant long term benefits.
While there are some immediate
short-run side effects, he added
that he feels "that we always come
out as a healthier institution."
