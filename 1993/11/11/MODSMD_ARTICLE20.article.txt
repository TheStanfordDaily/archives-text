# Driver Busquets driven by love for game

Antonio Busquets loves the game of
water polo.
The senior driver from Ponce,
Puerto Rico, has been playing the
sport since he was 13 years old, and
his love and intensity for the game
have not diminished since day one.
As a youngster, Busquets began
swimming competitively at age five
and rose to become one of the best
breaststrokers in Puerto Rico. He
made the Central American Games
team as a 10-year-old and continued to
qualify afterwards. When he began to
play water polo, it was only as a short
break from swimming. His water polo
season lasted from September to
November, with swimming occupying
the rest of his schedule.
During his senior year of high
school, Busquets' aquatic priorities
switched, as he turned his main focus
to water polo.
"I was training in water polo for the
Junior Pan Ams, and I decided to ded
icate myself full time," Busquets said.
"I was still swimming, but I played
water polo through the whole year."
It was his combined swimming and
water polo abilities which drew Bus
quets to Stanford.
"Stanford was one of the only
schools where I could have done both
swimming and water polo," he said. "I
decided to stick with water polo. I like
it because it's a team sport, especially
at Stanford. We have so many good
players and good friends. That makes
it worth it. Everyone is willing to give
100 percent."
That was a decision coach Dante
Dettamanti couldn't have been happi
er with.
"Antonio brought with him intensi

ty, spirit and great desire," Dettaman
ti said. "He always plays hard, always
working. We really needed that when
he came in. He made an impact as a
freshman because he had these quali
ties."

When asked about his aggressive
style and abandon, Busquets said, "I
just try to play with as much intensity
as a can. I love playing so much that
sometimes I get carried away."
Getting carried away sometimes

leads to referees giving Busquets 20-
second ejection fouls. Against Cal last
month, he fouled out late in the first
half of a Cardinal loss, picking up two

of his three fouls for "aggressive
play."
While Busquets made a success
ful transition to the collegiate ranks,
there were parts of his game which
required work.
"In Puerto Rico, we focus mainly
on offense," Busquets said. "It was
hard to adjust to defense. I'm still
improving."
"Antonio needed to learn better
positioning on defense and disci
pline," Dettamanti said. "He has
great legs and should be a great
defender. Sometimes, though, he
gets beat and tries to get the ball
back. I told him not to panic when
he got beat, let the goalie help you
out. He's so intense that he took
(getting beat) personally.
"Another thing he learned was
not to always shoot the ball really
hard," Dettamanti continued. "Also
not to shoot every time he got his
hand on the ball. He used to shoot as
hard as he could, right through the

goalie. Sometimes he would knock
the goalies backward."
Busquets currently has 31 goals
this season, including six from two
point range.
The Cardinal saw Busquets'
explosive offensive skills as early as
his freshman year, in which he
scored 10 goals in a reserve role. As
a starter in 1991, Busquets raised
his output to 33 goals, second-high
est on the team. Last year, he gained
All-America honorable mention
honors as he found the net 29 times,
including six goals at the NCAA
Championships.
In placing second to California at
that tournament, the Cardinal took
part in an intense championship
match, losing in sudden-death over
time, 12-11. Busquets recalls that
game as one of his greatest memo
ries at Stanford.
"It was really incredible," he said.
"We were down by six and we got
together and started working
toward winning. Everything went
right until the end."
In that game, as always, Bus
quets put forth an incredible effort.
In the closing seconds of regulation,

with the score tied, he stole the ball
from Cal standout Chris Oeding
and drove in to take a shot on goal.
His shot hit the goal-post, bounced
off the goaltender's head, and land
ed to the side of the goal. Busquets
retrieved the ball and attempted
another shot, which was blocked.
"It was a great effort," Detta
manti said. "He is the quickest play
er on our team. He leads the team in
steals and break-aways. He usually
scores on those."
Looking forward to this year's
NCAA Championships, which will
be played later this month, Bus
quets is optimistic.
"We need to keep focused, and
keep the level of play up," he said.
"These will be the hardest three
weeks of the season, with all of our
games against top-five teams."
It is certain that any team who
has to face the Cardinal in this
year's NCAAs should watch out for
Busquets, whose ultimate goal is an
NCAA championship ring.
And goalies beware, should he
break away for another one-on-one
shot. He doesn't plan on missing
any more of those.
