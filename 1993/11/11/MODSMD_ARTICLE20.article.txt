# Driver Busquets driven by love for game

Antonio Busquets loves the game of
water polo.
The senior driver from Ponce,
Puerto Rico, has been playing the
sport since he was 13 years old, and
his love and intensity for the game
have not diminished since day one.
As a youngster, Busquets began
swimming competitively at age five
and rose to become one of the best
breaststrokers in Puerto Rico. He
made the Central American Games
team as a 10-year-old and continued to
qualify afterwards. When he began to
play water polo, it was only as a short
break from swimming. His water polo
season lasted from September to
November, with swimming occupying
the rest of his schedule.
During his senior year of high
school, Busquets' aquatic priorities
switched, as he turned his main focus
to water polo.
"I was training in water polo for the
Junior Pan Ams, and I decided to ded
icate myself full time," Busquets said.
"I was still swimming, but I played
water polo through the whole year."
It was his combined swimming and
water polo abilities which drew Bus
quets to Stanford.
"Stanford was one of the only
schools where I could have done both
swimming and water polo," he said. "I
decided to stick with water polo. I like
it because it's a team sport, especially
at Stanford. We have so many good
players and good friends. That makes
it worth it. Everyone is willing to give
100 percent."
That was a decision coach Dante
Dettamanti couldn't have been happi
er with.
"Antonio brought with him intensi

ty, spirit and great desire," Dettaman
ti said. "He always plays hard, always
working. We really needed that when
he came in. He made an impact as a
freshman because he had these quali
ties."

When asked about his aggressive
style and abandon, Busquets said, "I
just try to play with as much intensity
as a can. I love playing so much that
sometimes I get carried away."
Getting carried away sometimes

leads to referees giving Busquets 20-
second ejection fouls. Against Cal last
month, he fouled out late in the first
half of a Cardinal loss, picking up two
