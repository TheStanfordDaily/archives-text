# Kathryn's not afraid to dream the big dream
## Dollar by dollar, she's hording up the green to buy the Dodger blue

Sometimes I dream, that he
is me ... I wanna be like
Mike, like Mike ... try to be
like Mike.

We've all had sports fan
tasies before, whether it be
quenching our deep-down
body thirst by soaring with
the likes of Michael Jordan or
staring down the barrel of a
Nolan Ryan fastball.
Well, my dreams are a little
more modest than that. I'm
convinced that by the time I
am 65, I will be the majority
shareholder and chief execu

tive officer of the Los Angeles
Dodgers. Don't laugh, now.
Today I'm trading baseball
cards, tomorrow I'll be swap
ping the players themselves.
Today I'm paying $12 for
an upper-deck reserved seat,
tomorrow I'll own every spot
in Dodger Stadium. Today,
I'm watching my friends on
"Good Morning America,"
tomorrow I'll be smooching

with the 57th (if no one holds
the executive office more than
once) president of the United
States before he throws out
the first ball of the season on
prime-time television.
Really, you can stop laugh
ing now. Peter O'Malley (the
present owner of the Dodgers)
be forwarned: I'm already
planning this coup d' etat.
So what makes me think

that I can amass that much
money, you ask?
Well, I can inherit the team
from the O'Malleys by marry
ing into the family (not too
likely).
Or I can write best-selling
novels like Tom Clancy, who
used his royalties to purchase
part of the Baltimore Orioles
