# Kathryn's not afraid to dream the big dream
## Dollar by dollar, she's hording up the green to buy the Dodger blue 
### 
Sometimes I dream, that he
is me ... I wanna be like
Mike, like Mike ... try to be
like Mike.

We've all had sports fan
tasies before, whether it be
quenching our deep-down
body thirst by soaring with
the likes of Michael Jordan or
staring down the barrel of a
Nolan Ryan fastball.
Well, my dreams are a little
more modest than that. I'm
convinced that by the time I
am 65, I will be the majority
shareholder and chief execu

tive officer of the Los Angeles
Dodgers. Don't laugh, now.
Today I'm trading baseball
cards, tomorrow I'll be swap
ping the players themselves.
Today I'm paying $12 for
an upper-deck reserved seat,
tomorrow I'll own every spot
in Dodger Stadium. Today,
I'm watching my friends on
"Good Morning America,"
tomorrow I'll be smooching

with the 57th (if no one holds
the executive office more than
once) president of the United
States before he throws out
the first ball of the season on
prime-time television.
Really, you can stop laugh
ing now. Peter O'Malley (the
present owner of the Dodgers)
be forwarned: I'm already
planning this coup d' etat.
So what makes me think

that I can amass that much
money, you ask?
Well, I can inherit the team
from the O'Malleys by marry
ing into the family (not too
likely).
Or I can write best-selling
novels like Tom Clancy, who
used his royalties to purchase
part of the Baltimore Orioles


Kathryn
Yang
a while back (I don't think so).
Or I can stick to my present
plan: saving one dollar at a time
and making a damn good invest
ment when the time is ripe.
Right now I put $25 to $50 in
an interest-earning CD at Home
Federal every week. I've been
doing that whenever I have a
steady income. Most of my birth
day and Christmas money goes
into that slush fund. It's a one
way street. Money in, nothing
out.
Then I figure I'll be able to
deposit something around the
neighborhood of $700 to $1,000
each week after I graduate and
find a job. Yes, that means I'm
not looking for public service
type jobs or anything that doesn't
pay well. Blasphemous, I know.

Call me shallow and immature,
but the ends justify the means.
And just like that, I'll have a
substantial lump saved up by the
time I'm 60. And then with a lit
tle luck or a good lottery ticket,
I'll be able to scrounge up enough
to cover part of that $200 million.
Peter O'Malley, read 'em and
weep.
I've always wanted to stroll
across the Dodger Stadium dia
mond and yuck it up with players
in the dogout. Or just toeing the
rubber on the mound during bat
ting practice and meeting Future
Hall-of-Famers face-to-face. Every
one has a dream.
Fat chance, you say? Well,
where there's a will, there's a
way. And if you don't see me in
the president's suite at Dodgers
Stadium sometime around the
year 2040, I'll probably be bum
ming in front of the TV at home
... or maybe in front of the big
screen in the locker room.
