# Sailors hope to make Rainbows bleed Cardinal red

### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
After coasting to a win in the
Stanford Invitational last week
end, the ninth-ranked Cardinal
sailing team is once again ready
to prove their recent success was
no fluke. At the North-South
Intersectional in San Luis Obis
po this weekend, the squad is
looking to show that it may be
the class of the Pacific Coast
Division.
The North-South Intersec
tional is the major regatta of the
fall season. The results will qual
ify teams for upcoming regattas
in the hectic, more consequential
spring season. Unlike the Stan
ford Invitational, which was a
district regatta, the North-South
meet is an intersectional, mean
ing that it is nationally attended.
However, while a few schools
from the East Coast and the
Northwest Division will partici
pate, the grand nwyority will be
from the Pacific Coast region.

Stanford sailing coach Steve
Bourdow estimated that over 15
schools from that region would
be present, including all that
were at last week's Stanford
Invitational.
It's a school who wasn't at last
week's regatta, however, that
poses the largest threat to Stan
ford. The clear favorite in the
Intersectional is Hawaii, the
third-ranked team in the nation.
In earlier encounters this season
the Cardinal was unable to top
the Rainbows.
Bourdow keeps the rivalry
against Hawaii in perspective.
"We don't go out and race
against one school," he said. "We
just have to race the race."
The North-South Intersec
tional, like most mqjor regattas,
consists of four divisions. The A
and B divisions are dinghy divi
sions, in which skipper-crew
teams race against each other.
The C and D divisions are single

handed, or laser divisions. The
laser boats are operated by one
person rather than a two-per
son skipper-crew team. As a
result, laser racing is slightly
more physically demanding.
Bourdow is counting on Stan
ford's lasers to perform well,
but he says that the main
emphasis is still on the dinghy
divisions.
As long as the Cardinal does
perform well, they will qualify
to attend most spring regattas.
Spring, Bourdow says, is when
the action really counts.
"Fall is pretty lame when it's
compared to spring. In the
spring are the major races, the
national championships, and
major intersectionals. That's
when we want to be on top."
