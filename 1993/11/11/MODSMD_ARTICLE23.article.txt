# Playing in the rain
## Women to golf through drops 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
Following the advice of the Miller Genuine
Draft commercial, the Cardinal women's golf
team will be getting out of the old and into the
cold this weekend in the Golf World Champi
onship Tournament.
Cold and blustery weather is expected for the
competition, which begins tomorrow and will run
through Sunday at the Palmetto Dunes Golf
Course in Hilton Head, S.C. There, the women
will do battle in a field comprised of the top 10
teams in the nation.
Stanford hosted No. 1 San Jose State, N0.2
Arizona State, No. 3 USC, No. 5 UCLA and No.
10 Tulsa just three weeks ago at the Stanford
Women's Intercollegiate Tournament, and will
compete against these squads once again this
weekend. Despite a sixth-place finish in the Inter
collegiate, the Cardinal women are now ranked
fourth in both the Golf World and the coaches'
polls.
The Cardinal lineup consists of Mhairi McKay,
whose play has led the squad thus far, Melinda
Daniels, Amy Lawrence, who is making her first
appearance for the team, Andrea Baxterm and
Jamille Jose. Two other talents, Vicky Strada and
Julie Bowen, will not be making the trip.
Cardinal head coach Tim Baldwin has
expressed his concern about the prevailing weath
er conditions. While it is presently sunny in
Hilton Head, there is a good chance of rain over
the weekend and cold temperatures have been the
norm of late.
"The only thing that worries me a little bit is
that it's very cold and wet there right now," said
Baldwin. "Last year, we experienced beautiful
weather."
