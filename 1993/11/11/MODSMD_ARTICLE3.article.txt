# Prof. Armacost rumored for deputy State office
## Possible nominee calls reports 'idle speculation' 
### Sandy Lee Staff writer 
Following the resignation of the second
ranking State Department official on Mon
day, Washington insiders are speculating
that Michael Armacost, a visiting professor
at Stanford, may be picked to fill the post.
Political Science Prof. Daniel Okimoto,
co-director of the Asia/Pacific Research
Center, called Armacost a "leading candi
date" for the vacancy left by Deputy Secre
tary of State Clifton Wharton. "By experi
ence and by ability [Armacost] is an ideal ap
pointment. Whether or not he would choose
to leave Stanford, however, is uncertain."
Armacost, a distinguished fellow and vis
iting professor at the Asia/Pacific Research
Center, has an extensive background in the
foreign service and State Department that
matches the description of the foreign ser
vice veteran the WTiite House seems to be
seeking, said James Raphael, the center's
director of research.
Most recently, Armacost served as U.S.
Ambassador to Japan, from 1989 to 1993.
Armacost declined to comment on the

prospect of his possible nomination, dis
missing it as a "Washington press rumor"
and "idle speculation." Armacost, who had
been traveling on the East Coast, said he
had not heard about his status as a candi
date for the appointment from any official
sources.
"I just returned from foreign service, and
I'm well-settled and enjoying myself at
Stanford," he said.
Several Stanford scholars said Armacost
is well qualified for the job.
"He knows the field of foreign policy.
He's spent his life in it. He's an experienced
and seasoned person," former Secretary of
State George Shultz said.
"He had the same sort of job when I was
secretary of state and he was the under sec
retary of political affairs. The person who is
the under secretary of political affairs
should be a very senior foreign service offi
cer who brings all the experience to the sec
retary of state's inner circle. It's traditional
ly filled by the top foreign service official,"
Shultz said.
On the other hand, "the
deputy secretary of state should
be a political appointee who is
politically attuned with the
president.
"The secretary of state must
be able to get along with the
appointee because he (the
deputy) serves as the secre
tary's alter ego, managing the
department when the secretary
is away — that includes meet
ing with the president and act
ing in [the secretary's] stead,"
Shultz said.
Shultz also expressed doubt
that Armacost will return to the
State Department as Wharton's
successor.
He is politically acceptable,
and"he is certainly able to do
it, but he has just retired and
he has already done a similar
job in the Reagan administra
tion.

"It's unlikely that the Clinton
administration will turn to
someone who already did [the
job] in the Reagan administra
tion," Shultz said.
Armacost left Japan in July
and came to Stanford in mid-
September to begin his year
long stay at the research center,
in cooperation with the Center
for East Asian Studies and the
Institute for International
Studies.
Armacost said he is currently
writing a book and guest lectur
ing in various classes.
He declined to comment on
career plans beyond this year,
saying that he is enjoying his
"sabbatical leave from all other
responsibilities."
Okimoto called Armacost a
"key member" in the center's
current research efforts.
In one project, he is working
with a small group of faculty on
convening a group of Asian lead
ers to discuss foreign-relations
issues as well as formulating
U.S. policy in Asia.

"With his many years of
experience in Japan and the
Philippines, we thought he
would fit in perfectly with our
research project on Asia's
regionalization — a multi-year,
multi-disciplinary project on
the emergence of Asia as a
region and America's national
interest in Asia," Okimoto
said.
Armacost will also give sever
al public lectures throughout
the year, Okimoto said.
Armacost was a professor of
political science at Pomona Col
lege before he joined the State
Department.
He has also served as U.S.
Ambassador to the Philippines.
His previous appointments in
Washington include senior staff
member for Asia in the National
Security Council, principal
deputy assistant secretary of
state for East Asian and Pacific
Affairs, and under secretary of
state for political affairs, the third
ranking position in the State
Department.

Department.
Following the resignation of the second
ranking State Department official on Mon
day, Washington insiders are speculating
that Michael Armacost, a visiting professor
at Stanford, may be picked to fill the post.
Political Science Prof. Daniel Okimoto,
co-director of the Asia/Pacific Research
Center, called Armacost a "leading candi
date" for the vacancy left by Deputy Secre
tary of State Clifton Wharton. "By experi
ence and by ability [Armacost] is an ideal ap
pointment. Whether or not he would choose
to leave Stanford, however, is uncertain."
Armacost, a distinguished fellow and vis
iting professor at the Asia/Pacific Research
Center, has an extensive background in the
foreign service and State Department that
matches the description of the foreign ser
vice veteran the WTiite House seems to be
seeking, said James Raphael, the center's
director of research.
Most recently, Armacost served as U.S.
Ambassador to Japan, from 1989 to 1993.
Armacost declined to comment on the

prospect of his possible nomination, dis
missing it as a "Washington press rumor"
and "idle speculation." Armacost, who had
been traveling on the East Coast, said he
had not heard about his status as a candi
date for the appointment from any official
sources.
"I just returned from foreign service, and
I'm well-settled and enjoying myself at
Stanford," he said.
Several Stanford scholars said Armacost
is well qualified for the job.
"He knows the field of foreign policy.
He's spent his life in it. He's an experienced
and seasoned person," former Secretary of
State George Shultz said.
"He had the same sort of job when I was
secretary of state and he was the under sec
retary of political affairs. The person who is
the under secretary of political affairs
should be a very senior foreign service offi
cer who brings all the experience to the sec
retary of state's inner circle. It's traditional
ly filled by the top foreign service official,"
Shultz said.
On the other hand, "the
deputy secretary of state should
be a political appointee who is
politically attuned with the
president.
"The secretary of state must
be able to get along with the
appointee because he (the
deputy) serves as the secre
tary's alter ego, managing the
department when the secretary
is away — that includes meet
ing with the president and act
ing in [the secretary's] stead,"
Shultz said.
Shultz also expressed doubt
that Armacost will return to the
State Department as Wharton's
successor.
He is politically acceptable,
and"he is certainly able to do
it, but he has just retired and
he has already done a similar
job in the Reagan administra
tion.

"It's unlikely that the Clinton
administration will turn to
someone who already did [the
job] in the Reagan administra
tion," Shultz said.
Armacost left Japan in July
and came to Stanford in mid-
September to begin his year
long stay at the research center,
in cooperation with the Center
for East Asian Studies and the
Institute for International
Studies.
Armacost said he is currently
writing a book and guest lectur
ing in various classes.
He declined to comment on
career plans beyond this year,
saying that he is enjoying his
"sabbatical leave from all other
responsibilities."
Okimoto called Armacost a
"key member" in the center's
current research efforts.
In one project, he is working
with a small group of faculty on
convening a group of Asian lead
ers to discuss foreign-relations
issues as well as formulating
U.S. policy in Asia.

"With his many years of
experience in Japan and the
Philippines, we thought he
would fit in perfectly with our
research project on Asia's
regionalization — a multi-year,
multi-disciplinary project on
the emergence of Asia as a
region and America's national
interest in Asia," Okimoto
said.
Armacost will also give sever
al public lectures throughout
the year, Okimoto said.
Armacost was a professor of
political science at Pomona Col
lege before he joined the State
Department.
He has also served as U.S.
Ambassador to the Philippines.
His previous appointments in
Washington include senior staff
member for Asia in the National
Security Council, principal
deputy assistant secretary of
state for East Asian and Pacific
Affairs, and under secretary of
state for political affairs, the third
ranking position in the State
Department.
