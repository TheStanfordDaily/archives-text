# Prof. Armacost rumored for deputy State office
## Possible nominee calls reports 'idle speculation' 
### Sandy Lee Staff writer 
Following the resignation of the second
ranking State Department official on Mon
day, Washington insiders are speculating
that Michael Armacost, a visiting professor
at Stanford, may be picked to fill the post.
Political Science Prof. Daniel Okimoto,
co-director of the Asia/Pacific Research
Center, called Armacost a "leading candi
date" for the vacancy left by Deputy Secre
tary of State Clifton Wharton. "By experi
ence and by ability [Armacost] is an ideal ap
pointment. Whether or not he would choose
to leave Stanford, however, is uncertain."
Armacost, a distinguished fellow and vis
iting professor at the Asia/Pacific Research
Center, has an extensive background in the
foreign service and State Department that
matches the description of the foreign ser
vice veteran the WTiite House seems to be
seeking, said James Raphael, the center's
director of research.
Most recently, Armacost served as U.S.
Ambassador to Japan, from 1989 to 1993.
Armacost declined to comment on the

prospect of his possible nomination, dis
missing it as a "Washington press rumor"
and "idle speculation." Armacost, who had
been traveling on the East Coast, said he
had not heard about his status as a candi
date for the appointment from any official
sources.
"I just returned from foreign service, and
I'm well-settled and enjoying myself at
Stanford," he said.
Several Stanford scholars said Armacost
is well qualified for the job.
"He knows the field of foreign policy.
He's spent his life in it. He's an experienced
and seasoned person," former Secretary of
State George Shultz said.
"He had the same sort of job when I was
secretary of state and he was the under sec
retary of political affairs. The person who is
the under secretary of political affairs
should be a very senior foreign service offi
cer who brings all the experience to the sec
retary of state's inner circle. It's traditional
ly filled by the top foreign service official,"
Shultz said.
