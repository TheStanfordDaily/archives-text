# Altogether alternative ideas

You've grown tired of the vapid
junk that lines the walls of Block
buster — "The Beverly Hillbillies"
movies showcasing the exuberant talents of
Macaulay Culkin or Pauly Shore or Sharon
Stone — a wasteland of happy endings, play
ground-level morality and horrific acting.
What now?
Well you can read this column every
other week and try some different stuff
that's out there, something that you may
find interesting or challenging, or you can
watch TV.
Now don't fret. This does not mean you
have to watch black-and-white films where
blubbering Italian clowns inexplicably dis
appear while shuffling about a padded
room. This column is not intended to send
you to the Coffee House to hold court on
movies that bored you but let you use words
like "Gadameresque" "semiotic," and "limi
nal." It only offers something different when
you and your friends are feeling vegetative
and could go for a video.
This week, let's talk Chinese action. As in
action films. And when we mean action,
Hong Kong flicks engage in it the camera
sometimes moves so quickly your retinas
struggle to keep up, especially when scanning

interestingly rendered subtitles. The stunts
are amazing — they make short work of the
prissy stuff you see Van Damme, Stallone or
anybody else in the U.S. trying to get away
with — and are a far cry from the less-than
professional kung fu theater you saw on Sat
urday afternoons.
Here are some films worth trying. It's a
hugely popular genre, so films vary in qual
ity. But the following are worth catching at
the video shop or at special theater festivals,
and all of them are technically superb.
Once Upon A Time in China 1
A martial arts master and physician (Jet
Li) struggles against British colonization in
this turn-of-the-century tale. Authentic
epic sweep, amazing physical action and ro
mantic possibilities between the doctor and
a Chinese woman educated in the West set
this one apart.
Ghost Story 1
Set in ancient China, a meek but decent
scholar falls in love with a beautiful ghost Un

fortunately, her stepmother likes to use her as
bait so she can feed on mortal souls, and wants
to marry her to the Duke of Hell. The scrappy
scholar and a belligerent Taoist priest set out to
free his lover from her step-mom and bring her
back to life. A nice romance, funny lines from
the priest and loads of supernatural action.
Swordsman 2
A band of swordsmen decide to give up
their violent careers and try the hermit's way
of life, but they're drawn into a nasty feud be
tween a megalomaniac wizard and a religious
sect. A Bros. Grimm fairy tale on steroids, it
features magical scrolls that turn men into
women, flying swordsmen, flying swords and
a priestess who cracks a mean whip. Packed
with humor, this eye-popping film showcases
a romantic triangle between our main hero, a
happy-go-lucky fighter who just wants some
peace and quiet, the priestess, and the wizard.
Project A Part 2
Jackie Chan plays a turn-of-the-century
cop in colonial Hong Kong trying to bust cor
rupt officials, fight off the crazed pirates and

deal with revolutionaries trying to overthrow
the British. A great setting that mixes British
hoity-toityness with down-home Chinese
butt-kicking, Chan has to be either the most
amazing athlete or the craziest psycho ever to
jump off a building in front of a camera. He
also happens to be the funniest Chinese actor
in existence, blending Chaplin's grace and
humor with amazing athleticism and hair
raising bravado. If you don't laugh or your
mouth doesn't drop at his antics, you should
consider Prozac.
Full Contact
Director Ringo Lam's gritty, rip-roaring
movie about a bouncer in Thailand who
beats up the wrong guy and takes up with
bad partners in crime to pay for his mistake.
Action galore, on the level of "Reservoir
Dogs," but the most absorbing feature is the
betrayal of our hero by his best friend, and
how the bouncer decides to even up the
score. A "Mean Streets" for Hong Kong, this
is for folks who like it down and dirty.
If you think these sound interesting, just
imagine all the other great Chinese flicks
you're probably missing out on. So say
good-bye to "NYPD Blue" and hello to "A
Better Tomorrow." ■
