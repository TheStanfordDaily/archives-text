# EXTREMES:
## WARREN MILLER'S LEGACY IN THE POWDER 
### MICHAEL G. NICHOLS 
more than a half-century ago, Warren
Miller shot his first ski footage.
While out on the slopes with a
friend, the duo began filming each other's
moves so they could watch the footage later
and give themselves technical pointers.
Those initial reels slowly became more
elaborate, until Miller finally decided to shoot
full-length feature films on skiing, with which
he toured around the country, accompanying
them with live narration. This passionate
hobby soon became the annual Warren Miller
Entertainment ski film, which quickly gained
the respect and admiration of snow-sports en
thusiasts around the country.
Forty-four years later, he is still going
strong.
Though Miller has now sold the company
to his son Kurt and partner Peter Speek, he still
continues to write, narrate and appear in the
MTV-like documentaries. And at 68 years of
age, that's not too shabby.
In his newest film, "Black Diamond Rush,"
Warren quips that anyone who claims to do
skiing activities with the same proficiency
they had 20 years earlier "must not have done
it very well back then." This statement does
not hold true, however, for this master of ski
cinematography.
But what makes his ski movies so good? What
makes audiences return year after year to pay
around $12 to see a flick about the same sport?
Perhaps it's the feelings created by the quality
of the production and the experience of the
Miller team "Skiing is a sense of freedom, and
that's why people are so emotional about it,"says
Peter Speek, who co-produces and directs the ski
movies with Kurt Miller. With the clout to as
semble the world's best in the sport and a team of
technicians that know their genre, Warren Miller
flicks definitely have a pulL
The film editor has worked on Warren
Miller Entertainment productions for 15
years; the cameramen for ages; and the head of
production for nearly three decades. As Speek
modestly puts it, "we have the dream team of
ski filmmaking."
So, while these flicks may still appeal to
Beavis and Butthead, they sure weren't made
by them. Year after year, the films continue to
draw both loyal and new audiences and never
stop giving the spectator the same adrenaline
rush the skiers on the screen are experiencing.
Another part of the films' staying power
comes from the production team's willingness
to evolve over time, an evolution that took
shape most dramatically after Warren sold the
company to his son and Speek five years ago. |
Since then, key components in the movies
have changed, bringing them stylistically up
to speed with the tastes of the MTV genera
tion, without losing the signature Miller feel.
Speek describes the evolution as a healthy
"collaboration with (the older style of Warren
Miller that] makes the film much more cohe
sive in blending sometimes opposing perspec
tives [such as] music." But never fear, "Black
Diamond Rush" is not a Sugar Cubes video. It
still contains the classic Miller ingredients of a

savvy script, fantastic camera work and im
promptu humor.
"Black Diamond Rush" is more than sim
ply amazing stunts; it displays a lot of sheer
talent as well. For instance, there's the senior
champion mogul racer who zips down treach
erous slopes with such grace that you could
"balance a tray with a cocktail on his head."
By traveling to locations throughout the
world, the Miller films reveal the conditions
and terrain for both skiing and life in other
countries. "Black Diamond Rush" was shot in
the U.S. as well as France, Romania, Chile, Ice
land, Russia and Canada. While showing
some of the best locations in the world, the
film also dishes out a very sophisticated atti
tude toward the
A day on the slopes in Transylvania, Roma
nia, for instance, will set the locals back a pal
try $0.25 for lift tickets on the technologically
backward rope pull lift. For foreigners, the
fc)rice is inconspicuously raised to the more fa
miliar $40.
Although finances keep many people from
skiing, money is not what skiing is really
about. It's an attitude, an oudook embraced
by skiers world-wide; it's a feeling of freedom
and the ability to explore personal potential.
"Skiing generally needs to be governed by
self-responsibility ... [it] is a freedom sport
and it is a risk sport," says Speek. "People need

to set their own boundaries and be reasonable
and take responsibility for the boundaries and
decisions they make."
And even in Miller's "Black Diamond Rush,"
with the best skiers in the world, sometimes
wrong decisions are made. The most amazing
aspect of the film is how the athletes get out of
the situations they are in. Occasionally, howev
er, there's a zig to miss a cameraman and a zag
into a tree. For all the laws of physics that seem
to be violated in this film, the rules governing
force and impact still hold true. But serious in
jury, knock on wood, has so far been avoided.
"We have a very strong mandate... safety
first," Speek said resolutely. "In 44 years of
filmmaking, I think we've had two broken
bones. 1 * But when you see a skier plowing
down a virgin powder mountain slope in
Valdiz, Alaska, and jumping over a 200-foot
deep crevice, that's hard to believe.
When asked what Miller and Speek's goal
in making their films was, they both replied
that making the most emotional and quality
laden production possible was of paramount
importance. And part of the reward is deliver
ing "a product that people love and get emo
tional about, and we do that without sex, vio
lence or profanity," explains Speek.
Part of the Miller films' appeal is that they
not only show the best, but they show the best
doing all those things you don't even imagine

possible. "[Our skiers] are the best in the
world at what they do," said Miller, defending
the potentially dangerous content of his films.
Although the film never flashes a "Don't Try
This at Home" warning across the screen, it
does include a very somber moment — a
memorial to one of the skiers. A short one
month after a location shoot with Paul Ruff, he
died alone in a remote region of the Sierras try
ing to set his own personal world-record verti
cal drop. Simple proof that freedom, especially
at the level of these films, does not banish limits.
As Miller points out, "A lot of us can shoot
a basketball and make it from half-court once,
but we were lucky. We could never do it again."
Though the films have moved away from
the outrageously dangerous footage that used
to mark them as inspirational to the "extreme"
skiing movement, they still continue to amaze.
Those less familiar with mogul racing and
helicopter skiing without guides will be
amazed. Some of the more fabulous footage
includes freestyle skiers who catch 30 feet of
air doing synchronized triple flips, body twists
and leg splits — total aerial ballet "Black Dia
mond Rush" captures the best at their best,
"doing things that simply have never been
done before," according to Kurt Miller.
When you put together the five best aerial
ists in the world, the U.S. women's ski team
and others, what else could you expect?
Nothing less than making audiences
around the country and world realize the per
sonal potential and power involved in skiing.
And when Miller says that the WME film
"shapes the outdoor enthusiast world around
the sport of skiing," he's not kidding. What
seems outrageous and amazing in the films
one year, may be the fashion of the slopes the
next. "We've had snowboarding in the films
for 15 years," Miller notes.
Both Miller and Speek have high goals
when making their films, striving to learn from
past productions and top themselves each
year. According to Speek, " 'Black Diamond
Rush' is the best film we have ever done."
But what makes it so special?
"The unplanned moments," Speek replies.
"Cinema v£rit£ comes out a lot in our films...
a lot of things just happen."
For instance, in "Black Diamond Rush,"
the WME team happened upon A.J. Snow, a
100-year-old skier. Blind in one eye, almost
completely deaf, but still very much active,
Snow sums up the spirit of skiing just as well
as all the younger athletes combined. What
would he miss most if he couldn't ski?
m - "The companionship, the camaraderie, the
sense of freedom, and the will to live."
Or take it from another man who's been
doing it all his life — Warren Miller.
"Go out there and hit the snow, and whether
you're in the powdery mountains of Alaska or a
mild slope in lowa, let yourself go and you'll find
your own 'Black Diamond Rush.'"

"Black Diamond Rush" continues its Bay Area
engagements through Nov. 11. Prices vary by lo
cation. Call (408) 998-BASS for locations and

Valdiz, Alaska, and jumping over a 200-foot
deep crevice, that's hard to believe.
When asked what Miller and Speek's goal
in making their films was, they both replied
that making the most emotional and quality
laden production possible was of paramount
importance. And part of the reward is deliver
ing "a product that people love and get emo
tional about, and we do that without sex, vio
lence or profanity," explains Speek.
Part of the Miller films' appeal is that they
not only show the best, but they show the best
doing all those things you don't even imagine

possible. "[Our skiers] are the best in the
world at what they do," said Miller, defending
the potentially dangerous content of his films.
Although the film never flashes a "Don't Try
This at Home" warning across the screen, it
does include a very somber moment — a
memorial to one of the skiers. A short one
month after a location shoot with Paul Ruff, he
died alone in a remote region of the Sierras try
ing to set his own personal world-record verti
cal drop. Simple proof that freedom, especially
at the level of these films, does not banish limits.
As Miller points out, "A lot of us can shoot
a basketball and make it from half-court once,
but we were lucky. We could never do it again."
Though the films have moved away from
the outrageously dangerous footage that used
to mark them as inspirational to the "extreme"
skiing movement, they still continue to amaze.
Those less familiar with mogul racing and
helicopter skiing without guides will be
amazed. Some of the more fabulous footage
includes freestyle skiers who catch 30 feet of
air doing synchronized triple flips, body twists
and leg splits — total aerial ballet "Black Dia
mond Rush" captures the best at their best,
"doing things that simply have never been
done before," according to Kurt Miller.
When you put together the five best aerial
ists in the world, the U.S. women's ski team
and others, what else could you expect?
Nothing less than making audiences
around the country and world realize the per
sonal potential and power involved in skiing.
And when Miller says that the WME film
"shapes the outdoor enthusiast world around
the sport of skiing," he's not kidding. What
seems outrageous and amazing in the films
one year, may be the fashion of the slopes the
next. "We've had snowboarding in the films
for 15 years," Miller notes.
Both Miller and Speek have high goals
when making their films, striving to learn from
past productions and top themselves each
year. According to Speek, " 'Black Diamond
Rush' is the best film we have ever done."
But what makes it so special?
"The unplanned moments," Speek replies.
"Cinema v£rit£ comes out a lot in our films...
a lot of things just happen."
For instance, in "Black Diamond Rush,"
the WME team happened upon A.J. Snow, a
100-year-old skier. Blind in one eye, almost

more than a half-century ago, Warren
Miller shot his first ski footage.
While out on the slopes with a
friend, the duo began filming each other's
moves so they could watch the footage later
and give themselves technical pointers.
Those initial reels slowly became more
elaborate, until Miller finally decided to shoot
full-length feature films on skiing, with which
he toured around the country, accompanying
them with live narration. This passionate
hobby soon became the annual Warren Miller
Entertainment ski film, which quickly gained
the respect and admiration of snow-sports en
thusiasts around the country.
Forty-four years later, he is still going
strong.
Though Miller has now sold the company
to his son Kurt and partner Peter Speek, he still
continues to write, narrate and appear in the
MTV-like documentaries. And at 68 years of
age, that's not too shabby.
In his newest film, "Black Diamond Rush,"
Warren quips that anyone who claims to do
skiing activities with the same proficiency
they had 20 years earlier "must not have done

The film editor has worked on Warren
Miller Entertainment productions for 15
years; the cameramen for ages; and the head of
production for nearly three decades. As Speek
modestly puts it, "we have the dream team of
ski filmmaking."
So, while these flicks may still appeal to
Beavis and Butthead, they sure weren't made
by them. Year after year, the films continue to
draw both loyal and new audiences and never
stop giving the spectator the same adrenaline
rush the skiers on the screen are experiencing.
Another part of the films' staying power
comes from the production team's willingness
to evolve over time, an evolution that took
shape most dramatically after Warren sold the
company to his son and Speek five years ago. |
Since then, key components in the movies
have changed, bringing them stylistically up
to speed with the tastes of the MTV genera
tion, without losing the signature Miller feel.
Speek describes the evolution as a healthy
"collaboration with (the older style of Warren
Miller that] makes the film much more cohe
sive in blending sometimes opposing perspec
tives [such as] music." But never fear, "Black
Diamond Rush" is not a Sugar Cubes video. It
still contains the classic Miller ingredients of a

savvy script, fantastic camera work and im
promptu humor.
"Black Diamond Rush" is more than sim

talent as well. For instance, there's the senior
champion mogul racer who zips down treach
erous slopes with such grace that you could
"balance a tray with a cocktail on his head."
By traveling to locations throughout the
world, the Miller films reveal the conditions
and terrain for both skiing and life in other
countries. "Black Diamond Rush" was shot in
the U.S. as well as France, Romania, Chile, Ice
land, Russia and Canada. While showing
some of the best locations in the world, the
film also dishes out a very sophisticated atti

Although finances keep many people from
skiing, money is not what skiing is really
about. It's an attitude, an oudook embraced
by skiers world-wide; it's a feeling of freedom
and the ability to explore personal potential.
"Skiing generally needs to be governed by
self-responsibility ... [it] is a freedom sport
and it is a risk sport," says Speek. "People need

to set their own boundaries and be reasonable
and take responsibility for the boundaries and
decisions they make."
And even in Miller's "Black Diamond Rush,"
with the best skiers in the world, sometimes
wrong decisions are made. The most amazing
aspect of the film is how the athletes get out of
the situations they are in. Occasionally, howev
er, there's a zig to miss a cameraman and a zag

to be violated in this film, the rules governing
force and impact still hold true. But serious in

Miller team "Skiing is a sense of freedom, and
that's why people are so emotional about it,"says
Peter Speek, who co-produces and directs the ski
movies with Kurt Miller. With the clout to as
semble the world's best in the sport and a team of
technicians that know their genre, Warren Miller
flicks definitely have a pulL
The film editor has worked on Warren
Miller Entertainment productions for 15
years; the cameramen for ages; and the head of
production for nearly three decades. As Speek
modestly puts it, "we have the dream team of
ski filmmaking."
So, while these flicks may still appeal to
Beavis and Butthead, they sure weren't made
by them. Year after year, the films continue to
draw both loyal and new audiences and never
stop giving the spectator the same adrenaline
rush the skiers on the screen are experiencing.
Another part of the films' staying power
comes from the production team's willingness
to evolve over time, an evolution that took
shape most dramatically after Warren sold the
company to his son and Speek five years ago. |
Since then, key components in the movies
have changed, bringing them stylistically up
to speed with the tastes of the MTV genera
tion, without losing the signature Miller feel.
Speek describes the evolution as a healthy
"collaboration with (the older style of Warren
Miller that] makes the film much more cohe
sive in blending sometimes opposing perspec
tives [such as] music." But never fear, "Black
Diamond Rush" is not a Sugar Cubes video. It
still contains the classic Miller ingredients of a

savvy script, fantastic camera work and im
promptu humor.
"Black Diamond Rush" is more than sim
ply amazing stunts; it displays a lot of sheer
talent as well. For instance, there's the senior
champion mogul racer who zips down treach
erous slopes with such grace that you could
"balance a tray with a cocktail on his head."
By traveling to locations throughout the
world, the Miller films reveal the conditions
and terrain for both skiing and life in other
countries. "Black Diamond Rush" was shot in
the U.S. as well as France, Romania, Chile, Ice
land, Russia and Canada. While showing
some of the best locations in the world, the
film also dishes out a very sophisticated atti
tude toward the
A day on the slopes in Transylvania, Roma
nia, for instance, will set the locals back a pal
try $0.25 for lift tickets on the technologically
backward rope pull lift. For foreigners, the
fc)rice is inconspicuously raised to the more fa
miliar $40.
Although finances keep many people from
skiing, money is not what skiing is really
about. It's an attitude, an oudook embraced
by skiers world-wide; it's a feeling of freedom
and the ability to explore personal potential.
"Skiing generally needs to be governed by
self-responsibility ... [it] is a freedom sport
and it is a risk sport," says Speek. "People need

to set their own boundaries and be reasonable
and take responsibility for the boundaries and
decisions they make."
And even in Miller's "Black Diamond Rush,"
with the best skiers in the world, sometimes
wrong decisions are made. The most amazing
aspect of the film is how the athletes get out of
the situations they are in. Occasionally, howev
er, there's a zig to miss a cameraman and a zag
into a tree. For all the laws of physics that seem
to be violated in this film, the rules governing
force and impact still hold true. But serious in
jury, knock on wood, has so far been avoided.
"We have a very strong mandate... safety
first," Speek said resolutely. "In 44 years of
filmmaking, I think we've had two broken
bones. 1 * But when you see a skier plowing
down a virgin powder mountain slope in
Valdiz, Alaska, and jumping over a 200-foot
deep crevice, that's hard to believe.
When asked what Miller and Speek's goal
in making their films was, they both replied
that making the most emotional and quality
laden production possible was of paramount
importance. And part of the reward is deliver
ing "a product that people love and get emo
tional about, and we do that without sex, vio
lence or profanity," explains Speek.
Part of the Miller films' appeal is that they
not only show the best, but they show the best
doing all those things you don't even imagine

possible. "[Our skiers] are the best in the
world at what they do," said Miller, defending
the potentially dangerous content of his films.
Although the film never flashes a "Don't Try
This at Home" warning across the screen, it
does include a very somber moment — a
memorial to one of the skiers. A short one
month after a location shoot with Paul Ruff, he
died alone in a remote region of the Sierras try
ing to set his own personal world-record verti
cal drop. Simple proof that freedom, especially
at the level of these films, does not banish limits.
As Miller points out, "A lot of us can shoot
a basketball and make it from half-court once,
but we were lucky. We could never do it again."
Though the films have moved away from
the outrageously dangerous footage that used
to mark them as inspirational to the "extreme"
skiing movement, they still continue to amaze.
Those less familiar with mogul racing and
helicopter skiing without guides will be
amazed. Some of the more fabulous footage
includes freestyle skiers who catch 30 feet of
air doing synchronized triple flips, body twists
and leg splits — total aerial ballet "Black Dia
mond Rush" captures the best at their best,
"doing things that simply have never been
done before," according to Kurt Miller.
When you put together the five best aerial
ists in the world, the U.S. women's ski team
and others, what else could you expect?
Nothing less than making audiences
around the country and world realize the per
sonal potential and power involved in skiing.
And when Miller says that the WME film
"shapes the outdoor enthusiast world around
the sport of skiing," he's not kidding. What
seems outrageous and amazing in the films
one year, may be the fashion of the slopes the
next. "We've had snowboarding in the films
for 15 years," Miller notes.
Both Miller and Speek have high goals
when making their films, striving to learn from
past productions and top themselves each
year. According to Speek, " 'Black Diamond
Rush' is the best film we have ever done."
But what makes it so special?
"The unplanned moments," Speek replies.
"Cinema v£rit£ comes out a lot in our films...
a lot of things just happen."
For instance, in "Black Diamond Rush,"
the WME team happened upon A.J. Snow, a
100-year-old skier. Blind in one eye, almost
completely deaf, but still very much active,
Snow sums up the spirit of skiing just as well
as all the younger athletes combined. What
would he miss most if he couldn't ski?
m - "The companionship, the camaraderie, the
sense of freedom, and the will to live."
Or take it from another man who's been
doing it all his life — Warren Miller.
"Go out there and hit the snow, and whether
you're in the powdery mountains of Alaska or a
mild slope in lowa, let yourself go and you'll find
your own 'Black Diamond Rush.'"

"Black Diamond Rush" continues its Bay Area
