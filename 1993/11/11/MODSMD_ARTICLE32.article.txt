# Drama Fantastique Gilbert and Sullivan's
## 'lolanthe' 
### Allison Amend 
Think singing fairies, love-struck Par
liament members and dancing shep
herds.
It's not the lead story for the latest issue of
a British tabloid or a historically based Harle
quin romance, but a traditional Stanford
Savoyards' production of a century-old
Gilbert-and-Sullivan musical entitled
"lolanthe." One of the dynamic duo's more
obscure works, "lolanthe" is being per
formed by the Savoyards for the second time
in less than five years.
"Most people have heard of 'Pirates of
Penzance' or 'HMS Pinafore,' " says Rita Tay
lor, executive producer of the Savoyards and
a 20-year veteran of the group. She insists
that "lolanthe," otherwise known as "The
Peer and the Peri," is as much fun as the pair's
more famous works. "It's intellectual humor,
not slapstick."
The light opera highlights the fantastic,
implausible story of the Fairy Queen lolanthe
(Stanford graduate Hope Cochran) who has
an illicit union with the mortal Lord Chan
cellor (libraries staff member Ed Glazier),
producing a half-mortal, half-fairy shepherd.
Unfortunately, the child Strephon (graduate
student Ross King) is in love with a beautiful
ward of the House of Peers named Phyllis
(Jennifer Pursell) who is forbidden to marry
a lowly shepherd.
Although the plot is confused by the scads
of fairies and lords played by supporting cast
members, the chaotic nature of the event of
fers many comic opportunities. "Puccini's
plots make no more sense than Gilbert and
Sullivan's, and though Gilbert and Sullivan
lack the snootiness of Italian or German light
opera, they're not held in as high regard," says
stage director Craig Fuget, a six-year Savo
yards veteran.
Fuget, a Mountain View resident, is like
many other cast members in that he has no
particular affiliation with the University.
"I'm an alumni spouse, does that count?" he
asks. In addition to local community mem
bers, Stanford faculty and staff, graduate and
undergraduate students, spouses and alumni
are all part of the Savoyards' saga. And this di
versity makes for an interesting, if sometimes

difficult, mix.
But having such a varied cast can be trying
on occasion. As assistant stage director and
Stanford junior Ari Lipton says, "Though
(the age difference] is a salient factor, stu
dents have trouble conforming to the sched
ules of working people. There are scheduling
conflicts."
The cast agrees that the layers of experi
ence help both the production and the indi
viduals. "I can't think of any other way stu
dents can get to meet people from the com
munity," says Taylor.
Fuget adds, "We have everything from
emeritus faculty, mature members of the
community to high-school students. It's a
very warm, friendly atmosphere. This year
we even have a father and a daughter in the
cast"
Lipton said she got involved for the first
time this year because she was upset at the
fact that students didn't take other campus
productions such as dorm plays seriously.
Most of the other cast members have sim
ilar stories. "I got Shanghaied into it!" laughs

one. Others tell stories about how they came
to see friends in productions and got hooked.
But Rita Taylor has a longer history with
the Savoyards, stemming almost all the way
back to the group's inception. She and her
husband, Stanford Prof. Dick Taylor, missed
the organizational meeting, but attended the
first show, "Pirates of Penzance," in June,
1973, and she is now completing her 20th
production with the group.
"During the Vietnam War, Ram's Head
(Theatrical Society) had kind of died out,"
Taylor says. "A couple of graduate students
from Cornell were here, and were appalled to
find that there was no Gilbert and Sullivan
group." The "founding fathers" rented
Dinkelspiel Auditorium for the first show.
"There were lines on opening night all the
way to the Faculty Club," Taylor remembers.
"It was a three-night run; all three were sold
out."
Costumes were a problem in those early
days. Money was tight, as the group started
with only a $600 grant from the University.
Taylor recalls that one Savoyard bought the

old Memorial Auditorium curtain for $1.05
and group members proceeded to rip, dye
and sew until uniforms could be made.
Since that first production, the Savoyards
have mounted two musicals a year, all in
Dinkelspiel. The auditorium is "a challenge,"
says Fuget. "It's like a haiku. There's a limit to
the amount you can do by the constraints of
the facility." He speaks of an ancient light
board, the strange shape of the stage and a
lack of space above the stage for storing and
hanging scenery.
"The stage makes a loud noise when you
step on it, so you have to be careful," adds
Lipton. "Also, the acoustics are so bad you
have to face out all the time if you want to be
heard. It's very hard for the characters to talk
to each other."
In addition to the standard challenges,
"lolanthe" lends some unique difficulties to
the Savoyards. As many of the characters are
supernatural, there is a call for magic in the
script and Lipton admits the group has
"some trick items."
Gilbert and Sullivan, too, have created dif
ficulties, with words and music that require
rigorous practice. "lolanthe" is one of only
three musicals for which Sullivan himself
wrote the overture (usually an assistant creat
ed it from a mixture of songs throughout the
musical). Taylor claims that his contribution
creates a unique beginning to a musical in
which the audience "really gets the feeling of
the words through the music."
The group doesn't claim to be as profes
sional or as polished as other campus theater
groups. "Ram's Head knows how to do that,"
Fuget says, yet Taylor feels confident that am
ateurism won't keep away the fans. "We have
a regular audience."
But though the audience may be "regular,"
the plot is not and that's what makes it a true
Gilbert-and-Sullivan performance.

The Stanford Savoyards production oflolan
the" will appear at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
Nov. 12-14, 19-20 at 8 p.m. All tickets are gen
eral admission at $10 or $6.50 for students and

Think singing fairies, love-struck Par
liament members and dancing shep
herds.
It's not the lead story for the latest issue of
a British tabloid or a historically based Harle
quin romance, but a traditional Stanford
Savoyards' production of a century-old
Gilbert-and-Sullivan musical entitled
"lolanthe." One of the dynamic duo's more
obscure works, "lolanthe" is being per
formed by the Savoyards for the second time
in less than five years.
"Most people have heard of 'Pirates of
Penzance' or 'HMS Pinafore,' " says Rita Tay
lor, executive producer of the Savoyards and
a 20-year veteran of the group. She insists
that "lolanthe," otherwise known as "The
Peer and the Peri," is as much fun as the pair's
more famous works. "It's intellectual humor,
not slapstick."
The light opera highlights the fantastic,
implausible story of the Fairy Queen lolanthe
(Stanford graduate Hope Cochran) who has
an illicit union with the mortal Lord Chan
cellor (libraries staff member Ed Glazier),
producing a half-mortal, half-fairy shepherd.
Unfortunately, the child Strephon (graduate
student Ross King) is in love with a beautiful
ward of the House of Peers named Phyllis
(Jennifer Pursell) who is forbidden to marry
a lowly shepherd.
Although the plot is confused by the scads
of fairies and lords played by supporting cast
members, the chaotic nature of the event of
fers many comic opportunities. "Puccini's
plots make no more sense than Gilbert and
Sullivan's, and though Gilbert and Sullivan
lack the snootiness of Italian or German light
opera, they're not held in as high regard," says
stage director Craig Fuget, a six-year Savo
yards veteran.
Fuget, a Mountain View resident, is like
many other cast members in that he has no
particular affiliation with the University.
"I'm an alumni spouse, does that count?" he
asks. In addition to local community mem
bers, Stanford faculty and staff, graduate and
undergraduate students, spouses and alumni
are all part of the Savoyards' saga. And this di
versity makes for an interesting, if sometimes

difficult, mix.
But having such a varied cast can be trying
on occasion. As assistant stage director and
Stanford junior Ari Lipton says, "Though
(the age difference] is a salient factor, stu
dents have trouble conforming to the sched
ules of working people. There are scheduling
conflicts."
The cast agrees that the layers of experi
ence help both the production and the indi
viduals. "I can't think of any other way stu
dents can get to meet people from the com
munity," says Taylor.
Fuget adds, "We have everything from
emeritus faculty, mature members of the
community to high-school students. It's a
very warm, friendly atmosphere. This year
we even have a father and a daughter in the
cast"
Lipton said she got involved for the first
time this year because she was upset at the
fact that students didn't take other campus
productions such as dorm plays seriously.
Most of the other cast members have sim
ilar stories. "I got Shanghaied into it!" laughs

one. Others tell stories about how they came
to see friends in productions and got hooked.
But Rita Taylor has a longer history with
the Savoyards, stemming almost all the way
back to the group's inception. She and her
husband, Stanford Prof. Dick Taylor, missed
the organizational meeting, but attended the
first show, "Pirates of Penzance," in June,
1973, and she is now completing her 20th
production with the group.
"During the Vietnam War, Ram's Head
(Theatrical Society) had kind of died out,"
Taylor says. "A couple of graduate students
from Cornell were here, and were appalled to
find that there was no Gilbert and Sullivan
group." The "founding fathers" rented
Dinkelspiel Auditorium for the first show.
"There were lines on opening night all the
way to the Faculty Club," Taylor remembers.
"It was a three-night run; all three were sold
out."
Costumes were a problem in those early
days. Money was tight, as the group started
with only a $600 grant from the University.
Taylor recalls that one Savoyard bought the

old Memorial Auditorium curtain for $1.05
and group members proceeded to rip, dye
and sew until uniforms could be made.
Since that first production, the Savoyards
have mounted two musicals a year, all in
Dinkelspiel. The auditorium is "a challenge,"
says Fuget. "It's like a haiku. There's a limit to
the amount you can do by the constraints of
the facility." He speaks of an ancient light
board, the strange shape of the stage and a
lack of space above the stage for storing and
hanging scenery.
"The stage makes a loud noise when you
step on it, so you have to be careful," adds
Lipton. "Also, the acoustics are so bad you
have to face out all the time if you want to be
heard. It's very hard for the characters to talk
to each other."
In addition to the standard challenges,
"lolanthe" lends some unique difficulties to
the Savoyards. As many of the characters are
supernatural, there is a call for magic in the
script and Lipton admits the group has
"some trick items."
Gilbert and Sullivan, too, have created dif
ficulties, with words and music that require
rigorous practice. "lolanthe" is one of only
three musicals for which Sullivan himself
wrote the overture (usually an assistant creat
ed it from a mixture of songs throughout the
musical). Taylor claims that his contribution
creates a unique beginning to a musical in
which the audience "really gets the feeling of
the words through the music."
The group doesn't claim to be as profes
sional or as polished as other campus theater
groups. "Ram's Head knows how to do that,"
Fuget says, yet Taylor feels confident that am
ateurism won't keep away the fans. "We have
a regular audience."
