# BIGGAME GAIETIES

### 
nergy not talent!" Producer Dave Bar-
lin, a junior, calls out the mantra of
Ik Big Game Gaieties auditions as a herd
of aspiring performers, heads down in deep
concentration, march out Memorial Auditori
um's green-room door.

They don't call this a "cattle call" audition for
nothing. The large groups of auditionees stam
peding to and from the Mem Aud stage attest to
that.
Minutes after the first bunch marches
through the door, another group bursts in, still
wired from their audition. "I sang and acted
well, but boy did I dance horribly!" one hopeful
says to no one in particular, popping handfuls of
M&M's into his mouth. "That was fun. Can 1
audition again?"
Not far away, the tentative, nervous singing
of another would-be cast member on stage
slowly grows into a full-out operatic bellow as
he relaxes and gains confidence. As he finishes
his song, the enthusiastic applause of the staff
and peers echoes through the auditorium.
Thus begins another year of an age-old Stan
ford tradition, as yet another group of stu
dents — ranging from freshmen to trans
fers to Law School students — vie for a spot in
the cast of Gaieties.
Actually, the pieces of the Gaieties puzzle re
ally started falling into place right after the close
of last year's Gaieties, when the outgoing pro
ducer hired Barlin as the new producer. The
producer selected the rest of the staff. Then the
team of writers, headed this year by senior Jason

Mayland got to work.
The writing process is a culmination of indi
vidual and group efforts, ranging from "scenes
that are split up and written by two people to
everyone sitting around stone drunk all night and
writing," says Ram's Head Executive Producer
and Gaieties veteran Melissa Wilson, a senior.
Two months before last school year ended,
Mayland started to tie up the various compo
nents of the script, and worked on consolidating
it over the summer, Wilson says. However, the
script is always subject to revisions depending
on current events, at Stanford or elsewhere.
Meanwhile the technical crew — led by ju
nior Mark Brandt — orchestra and set directors
are also hard at work, awaiting the merging of
the Gaieties components.
But back in the green room, the onstage as
pects of the show are on everyone's mind
as auditionees mull around, some talking
excitedly, others singing and even a few pretend
ing to be deeply absorbed in course readers.
Participants and staff agree that Gaieties au
ditions differ from those of most other produc
tions because, true to the fun nature of the show,
aspiring performers are chosen for their spirit
rather than ability.
"The main thing I'm looking for — and it's
almost a cliche — is energy and enthusiasm.
That's more important than whether you've
played Hamlet 35 times on Broadway," says Di
rector Dan Goldman, a senior. He further ex
plains that Gaieties is probably the best oppor
tunity for "shower singers" to get involved in

the performing arts at Stanford.
Yet with over 75 people vying for only 30 to
35 cast positions, it does help to be able to sing
on-key, and maybe even dance.
"I've just got to make sure I don't get a danc
ing part," fifth-year senior Kyle Miller says em
phatically before his audition.
Almost an age-old tradition, dread of the
dancing is to Gaieties auditions what the show
itself is to Big Game. In a two-hour process, all
auditionees sing prepared or given songs, do
cold readings, and learn and perform a dance.
Another four auditionees sit down in the
green room, relieved but fidgety, and reflect on
their experiences.
"I was so psyched-out. The whole time I was
on cruise control," freshman Elliot Brown says,
leaning forward in his chair.
"It was pretty non-stressful," senior Tom
Russell comments, his feet propped up.
"Totally," junior John Lucero agrees.
"Everyone was really supportive," freshman
Heidi Schweiker says.
"Anything goes," Lucero says.
"It was great how everyone else was out there
cheering for you," Schweiker says."And the
staff wasn't sitting there with stern faces when
you were up."
"It's less of a competition and more group
oriented," Russell adds.
The next night, Memorial Auditorium is abuzz
once again, this time with callbacks for major
roles and dancers. Now, auditionees wander
around in smaller groups, more relaxed and con

fidenL They have made the first cut.
Onstage, actor-singers are competing for a
character simply referred to as "Lounge Singer."
Senior Ben Evans, the musical director, sits at the
piano and plays the chords of "The Love Boat"

for freshman George Lin.
Lin — who is dancing in place nonstop —<
hums the tune, then asks, "What if we don't
know the verses for the Love Boat?"
"Make them up. Now/ee/theschmarm you're
about to exude," Evans says, starting the opening
chords.
"The Love Boat ..Lin croons in his best
Wayne Newton imitation. Halfway through the
verse, he pauses in consternation, then belts out a
made-up verse that falls in perfectly with the
rhythm. "Maybe I'll be the lucky oooone." Fel
low auditionees and staff applaud and laugh as
Lin grins and dances offstage.
"It was different from what I expected," Lin
says after his audition. "The competition was
there, but I didn't feel it because it was fun."
Sue aspiring lounge singers later, sophomore
Lori Elder is up. Everyone notices her — she is the
only woman called back for the part. Confident,
she strikes a distinctly feminine pose on stage, one
hand on her hip and one knee slightly bent.
"Ooze with schmarm," Evans says as he
launches into the opening chords of "The Love
Boat" once again. Elder effortlessly warbles the
tune and doesn't even flinch when singing, "I
aaaaam an innocent ttiaaan" in the acting part of
her audition.
Later, as the lounge singers prepare to depart,
Elder reflects on competing for a stereotypically
male role. "Lounge lizards can be women. I think
women can be just as schmarmy as men," she
says.
While Elder says it was impossible to ignore
the competitive aspects of the audition with eight
others vying for the same part, she used a little ra
tionality to bring perspective to the experience.
"When you think about it, it's kind of ridiculous
that there's nine of us who are dying to be lounge
lizards," she says, laughing.
That night, when all the auditionees have
gone home, the Gaieties production staff begin
the painstaking process of deciding who will
claim the coveted parts. Goldman says this year a
decision was made not to post a cast list until a
full day after callbacks, so the staff wouldn't have
to stay up all night to make their announcements
by morning.
Not only does the staff have to decide who will
play all the main roles in a day, but they must also
choose the chorus members and decide which
ones will appear in which scenes, Goldman says.
The night after callbacks, Barlin, in his rounds
of congratulating roll -outs, rudely awakens
sophomore Brennan Carlson up in his Car
denal room at "about three in the morning."

(Carlson, who had been recently rolled out by an
a cappella group, apologizes profusely to his
"very understanding" roommate.
Carlson recalls feeling "excited, scared and
confused" as he found out the good news
through a sleepy haze.
The exuberant group overcomes their grog
giness, congregating at Lyon's for the first of
many cast-bonding experiences.
Stage manager Alison Duxbury, a junior,
said that in order to make cast members feel
they were a "part of an ensemble," the perform
ers were not told that morning what parts they
were assigned.
It isn't until the first rehearsal that the roles
are revealed. Carlson remembers being handed
a script, and "on the first page, left-justified,
there was the character name" — he had been
cast as the lead, "David."
"1 was really happy," Carlson says. "1 didn't
expect the part."
As rehearsals launch into full swing, auditions
— and roll-outs — are a distant memory. In one
of the Drama Department classrooms, Elder,
now officially a female lounge lizard, croons "I
aaam an innocent maaan" for real this time.

Ingrid Hoffman, a junior, calls out,
leading a dance with enthusiasm ap
proaching aerobics-instructor level. Assistant
choreographer Barbra Tibbies, a junior, backs
her up. A group of about 20 struggles to keep up
with them, kicking, jumping and posing.
T-minus 14 days and counting to opening
night. It's midterms week and the cast, attired in
T-shirts, sweats and jeans, is practicing at Elliot
Program Center, on a polished hardwood floor
and in front of a full-wall mirror — a scene rem
iniscent of "Fame."
"Does everyone remember the knee-jump?"
Hoffman asks, eliciting groans. She demon
strates the ballet-inspired move, "See, you lift
one knee up and ... jump. No problem. Every
one got it?"
Thuds echo and chaos ensues as everyone prac
tices on their own, with varying degrees of success.
"But where do the arms go?" someone asks.
While rehearsals are hard work — "you act,
dance, sing and sweat a lot" — Carlson says they
also are "a bonding experience" for the cast.
Having just transferred from the University of
Pennsylvania, Gaieties provides the perfect in
troduction to Big Game tradition and rivalry, he
adds.
Other cast members are Stanford veterans,
like third-year Law School student Rob Gor
man, one of only two graduate students in the
show. "It sounded like fun, like a good way to
meet people," he says.
Waiting their turn, a small group of cast
members sits in a back room and laments their
lack of dancing expertise.
"When I'm trying to learn a dance, I always
try to sneak to the back row so no one will see
me," junior Ryan Holland says. "Hopefully by
opening night I won't have to stay back there
and copy the tall women who can dance— I'm
always half a step late."
Egged on by concurring remarks, Holland
says,"And another thing. Singing and dancing
at the same time — I guess some people are able
to do that, but I can't seem to get that."
"I can sing. 1 can dance. But I can't do it at the
same time," Freshman John Chakan says,
laughing.
Sophomore Adam Fingerhut says he prac
tices the dances in his dorm room. So what does
his roommate think? "I don't practice when he's
there," Fingerhut says.
"I did it until my roommate found out,"
Chakan adds.
Back in the studio, Hoffman and Tibbies
are leading the dancers as they polish up
their routine. The movements are syn
chronized now, but the wear and tear of an hour

and a half of rehearsing are starting to show as
the jumps and kicks become less enthusiastic.
"Let's add the arm here. It looks better,"
Hoffman says, demonstrating the impromptu
revision. "Okay, now let's try the dance with the
music."
She turns on a tape recorder and an upbeat,
playful song filled with the usual Stanford-life
allusions comes on. The cast members sing
along. "Okay, ready? 5,6,7,8 ..Hoffman calls
out.
Suddenly, the moves that the dancers have
been practicing come together and the energy
level shoots up. The recharged performers are
smiling and bouncy once again, as the jumps are
higher and the arm movements snappier. Once
in a while, a stray arm or leg misfires, but with
the group's exuberance, nobody notices.
After they complete the number, cast mem
bers jump around, laugh and exchange high
fives. "That was so cool," one performer says,
hugging the dancer next to her.
"There's a totally different energy level when
we practice with the music," sophomore Chi
Chi Liang says. "It's when we start to feel like
everything's starting to come together."
Because the practices are segmented into
"read-throughs, sing-throughs" and dance
practices, cast members often don't see how a
certain song or routine fits into the bigger pic
ture until toward the end of the process, Liang
explains. "It's great to see it start to take form."
Sophomore Alice Feng echoes Liang's senti
ments, saying, "Sometimes practice is a drag,
but today it was really fun."
So when is practice not fun? "When you have
midterms," Fingerhut groans, lamenting the
fact that he has an exam the next day. He is not
among the few who have toted along books to

practice and sit in corners reading. Does anyone
get work done during practice? "What a joke,"
Fingerhut says.
"I've basically given up studying until De
cember," Chakan says, shrugging his shoulders.
As the cast enters into "Tech Week," members
are expecting to spend 45 hours in rehearsals.
As opening night draws closer, the practices
increasingly begin to resemble the final
product. Soon, the cast will move to Mem
Aud, so they can familiarize themselves with the
stage. Sets, costumes and the orchestra will fol
low shortly thereafter.
Sophomore Lori Ginsburg says the amount
of energy created by finally practicing on stage
with the orchestra is "incredible." A second
time Gaieties performer, she says, "Last year 1
was so tired after it was all done. I said, 'No way
am I trying out again.' "
But it was the feeling of the practices coming
together into a performance that drove her to
return. "I thought about that, and when audi
tions came around again, it was like, 'I gotta do
it,' " she says.
Opening night, when the final component
— the audience — falls into place, marks the
culmination of six weeks of rehearsals and a
year of planning and preparations. Ginsburg
says, "The only way I can describe it is as a
rush." ■

plains that Gaieties is probably the best oppor
tunity for "shower singers" to get involved in

the performing arts at Stanford.
Yet with over 75 people vying for only 30 to
35 cast positions, it does help to be able to sing
on-key, and maybe even dance.
"I've just got to make sure I don't get a danc
ing part," fifth-year senior Kyle Miller says em
phatically before his audition.
Almost an age-old tradition, dread of the
dancing is to Gaieties auditions what the show
itself is to Big Game. In a two-hour process, all
auditionees sing prepared or given songs, do
cold readings, and learn and perform a dance.
Another four auditionees sit down in the
green room, relieved but fidgety, and reflect on
their experiences.
"I was so psyched-out. The whole time I was
on cruise control," freshman Elliot Brown says,
leaning forward in his chair.
"It was pretty non-stressful," senior Tom
Russell comments, his feet propped up.
"Totally," junior John Lucero agrees.
"Everyone was really supportive," freshman
Heidi Schweiker says.
"Anything goes," Lucero says.
"It was great how everyone else was out there
cheering for you," Schweiker says."And the
staff wasn't sitting there with stern faces when
you were up."
"It's less of a competition and more group
oriented," Russell adds.
The next night, Memorial Auditorium is abuzz
once again, this time with callbacks for major
roles and dancers. Now, auditionees wander
around in smaller groups, more relaxed and con

fidenL They have made the first cut.
Onstage, actor-singers are competing for a
character simply referred to as "Lounge Singer."
Senior Ben Evans, the musical director, sits at the
piano and plays the chords of "The Love Boat"

for freshman George Lin.
Lin — who is dancing in place nonstop —<
hums the tune, then asks, "What if we don't
know the verses for the Love Boat?"
"Make them up. Now/ee/theschmarm you're
about to exude," Evans says, starting the opening
chords.
"The Love Boat ..Lin croons in his best
Wayne Newton imitation. Halfway through the
verse, he pauses in consternation, then belts out a
made-up verse that falls in perfectly with the
rhythm. "Maybe I'll be the lucky oooone." Fel
low auditionees and staff applaud and laugh as
Lin grins and dances offstage.
"It was different from what I expected," Lin
says after his audition. "The competition was
there, but I didn't feel it because it was fun."
Sue aspiring lounge singers later, sophomore
Lori Elder is up. Everyone notices her — she is the
only woman called back for the part. Confident,
she strikes a distinctly feminine pose on stage, one
hand on her hip and one knee slightly bent.
"Ooze with schmarm," Evans says as he
launches into the opening chords of "The Love
Boat" once again. Elder effortlessly warbles the
tune and doesn't even flinch when singing, "I
aaaaam an innocent ttiaaan" in the acting part of
her audition.
Later, as the lounge singers prepare to depart,
Elder reflects on competing for a stereotypically
male role. "Lounge lizards can be women. I think
women can be just as schmarmy as men," she
says.
While Elder says it was impossible to ignore
the competitive aspects of the audition with eight
others vying for the same part, she used a little ra
tionality to bring perspective to the experience.
"When you think about it, it's kind of ridiculous
that there's nine of us who are dying to be lounge
lizards," she says, laughing.
That night, when all the auditionees have
gone home, the Gaieties production staff begin
the painstaking process of deciding who will
claim the coveted parts. Goldman says this year a
decision was made not to post a cast list until a
full day after callbacks, so the staff wouldn't have
to stay up all night to make their announcements
by morning.
Not only does the staff have to decide who will
play all the main roles in a day, but they must also
choose the chorus members and decide which
ones will appear in which scenes, Goldman says.
The night after callbacks, Barlin, in his rounds
of congratulating roll -outs, rudely awakens
sophomore Brennan Carlson up in his Car
denal room at "about three in the morning."

(Carlson, who had been recently rolled out by an
a cappella group, apologizes profusely to his
"very understanding" roommate.
Carlson recalls feeling "excited, scared and
confused" as he found out the good news
through a sleepy haze.
The exuberant group overcomes their grog
giness, congregating at Lyon's for the first of
many cast-bonding experiences.
Stage manager Alison Duxbury, a junior,
said that in order to make cast members feel
they were a "part of an ensemble," the perform
ers were not told that morning what parts they
were assigned.
It isn't until the first rehearsal that the roles
are revealed. Carlson remembers being handed
a script, and "on the first page, left-justified,
there was the character name" — he had been
cast as the lead, "David."
"1 was really happy," Carlson says. "1 didn't
expect the part."
As rehearsals launch into full swing, auditions
— and roll-outs — are a distant memory. In one
of the Drama Department classrooms, Elder,
now officially a female lounge lizard, croons "I
aaam an innocent maaan" for real this time.

Ingrid Hoffman, a junior, calls out,
leading a dance with enthusiasm ap
proaching aerobics-instructor level. Assistant
choreographer Barbra Tibbies, a junior, backs
her up. A group of about 20 struggles to keep up
with them, kicking, jumping and posing.
T-minus 14 days and counting to opening
night. It's midterms week and the cast, attired in
T-shirts, sweats and jeans, is practicing at Elliot
Program Center, on a polished hardwood floor
and in front of a full-wall mirror — a scene rem
iniscent of "Fame."
"Does everyone remember the knee-jump?"
Hoffman asks, eliciting groans. She demon
strates the ballet-inspired move, "See, you lift
one knee up and ... jump. No problem. Every
one got it?"
Thuds echo and chaos ensues as everyone prac
tices on their own, with varying degrees of success.
"But where do the arms go?" someone asks.
While rehearsals are hard work — "you act,
dance, sing and sweat a lot" — Carlson says they
also are "a bonding experience" for the cast.
Having just transferred from the University of
Pennsylvania, Gaieties provides the perfect in
troduction to Big Game tradition and rivalry, he
adds.
Other cast members are Stanford veterans,
like third-year Law School student Rob Gor
man, one of only two graduate students in the
show. "It sounded like fun, like a good way to
meet people," he says.
Waiting their turn, a small group of cast
members sits in a back room and laments their
lack of dancing expertise.
"When I'm trying to learn a dance, I always
try to sneak to the back row so no one will see
me," junior Ryan Holland says. "Hopefully by
opening night I won't have to stay back there
and copy the tall women who can dance— I'm
always half a step late."
Egged on by concurring remarks, Holland
says,"And another thing. Singing and dancing
at the same time — I guess some people are able
to do that, but I can't seem to get that."
"I can sing. 1 can dance. But I can't do it at the
same time," Freshman John Chakan says,
laughing.
Sophomore Adam Fingerhut says he prac
tices the dances in his dorm room. So what does
his roommate think? "I don't practice when he's
there," Fingerhut says.
"I did it until my roommate found out,"
Chakan adds.
Back in the studio, Hoffman and Tibbies
are leading the dancers as they polish up
their routine. The movements are syn
chronized now, but the wear and tear of an hour

and a half of rehearsing are starting to show as
the jumps and kicks become less enthusiastic.
"Let's add the arm here. It looks better,"
Hoffman says, demonstrating the impromptu
revision. "Okay, now let's try the dance with the
music."
She turns on a tape recorder and an upbeat,
playful song filled with the usual Stanford-life
allusions comes on. The cast members sing
along. "Okay, ready? 5,6,7,8 ..Hoffman calls
out.
Suddenly, the moves that the dancers have
been practicing come together and the energy
level shoots up. The recharged performers are
smiling and bouncy once again, as the jumps are
higher and the arm movements snappier. Once
in a while, a stray arm or leg misfires, but with
the group's exuberance, nobody notices.
After they complete the number, cast mem
bers jump around, laugh and exchange high
fives. "That was so cool," one performer says,
hugging the dancer next to her.
"There's a totally different energy level when
we practice with the music," sophomore Chi
Chi Liang says. "It's when we start to feel like
everything's starting to come together."
Because the practices are segmented into
"read-throughs, sing-throughs" and dance
practices, cast members often don't see how a
certain song or routine fits into the bigger pic
ture until toward the end of the process, Liang
explains. "It's great to see it start to take form."
Sophomore Alice Feng echoes Liang's senti
ments, saying, "Sometimes practice is a drag,
but today it was really fun."
So when is practice not fun? "When you have
midterms," Fingerhut groans, lamenting the
fact that he has an exam the next day. He is not
among the few who have toted along books to

practice and sit in corners reading. Does anyone
get work done during practice? "What a joke,"
Fingerhut says.
"I've basically given up studying until De
cember," Chakan says, shrugging his shoulders.
As the cast enters into "Tech Week," members
are expecting to spend 45 hours in rehearsals.
As opening night draws closer, the practices
increasingly begin to resemble the final
product. Soon, the cast will move to Mem
Aud, so they can familiarize themselves with the
stage. Sets, costumes and the orchestra will fol
low shortly thereafter.
Sophomore Lori Ginsburg says the amount
of energy created by finally practicing on stage
with the orchestra is "incredible." A second
time Gaieties performer, she says, "Last year 1
was so tired after it was all done. I said, 'No way
am I trying out again.' "
But it was the feeling of the practices coming
together into a performance that drove her to
return. "I thought about that, and when audi
tions came around again, it was like, 'I gotta do
it,' " she says.
Opening night, when the final component
— the audience — falls into place, marks the
culmination of six weeks of rehearsals and a
year of planning and preparations. Ginsburg
says, "The only way I can describe it is as a
rush." ■

nergy not talent!" Producer Dave Bar-
lin, a junior, calls out the mantra of
Ik Big Game Gaieties auditions as a herd
of aspiring performers, heads down in deep
concentration, march out Memorial Auditori
um's green-room door.

They don't call this a "cattle call" audition for
nothing. The large groups of auditionees stam
peding to and from the Mem Aud stage attest to
that.
Minutes after the first bunch marches
through the door, another group bursts in, still
wired from their audition. "I sang and acted
well, but boy did I dance horribly!" one hopeful
says to no one in particular, popping handfuls of
M&M's into his mouth. "That was fun. Can 1
audition again?"
Not far away, the tentative, nervous singing
of another would-be cast member on stage
slowly grows into a full-out operatic bellow as
he relaxes and gains confidence. As he finishes
his song, the enthusiastic applause of the staff
and peers echoes through the auditorium.
Thus begins another year of an age-old Stan
ford tradition, as yet another group of stu
dents — ranging from freshmen to trans
fers to Law School students — vie for a spot in
the cast of Gaieties.
Actually, the pieces of the Gaieties puzzle re
ally started falling into place right after the close
of last year's Gaieties, when the outgoing pro
ducer hired Barlin as the new producer. The
producer selected the rest of the staff. Then the
team of writers, headed this year by senior Jason

Mayland got to work.
The writing process is a culmination of indi
vidual and group efforts, ranging from "scenes
that are split up and written by two people to
everyone sitting around stone drunk all night and
writing," says Ram's Head Executive Producer
and Gaieties veteran Melissa Wilson, a senior.
Two months before last school year ended,
Mayland started to tie up the various compo
nents of the script, and worked on consolidating
it over the summer, Wilson says. However, the
script is always subject to revisions depending
on current events, at Stanford or elsewhere.
Meanwhile the technical crew — led by ju
nior Mark Brandt — orchestra and set directors
are also hard at work, awaiting the merging of
the Gaieties components.
But back in the green room, the onstage as
pects of the show are on everyone's mind
as auditionees mull around, some talking
excitedly, others singing and even a few pretend
ing to be deeply absorbed in course readers.
Participants and staff agree that Gaieties au
ditions differ from those of most other produc
tions because, true to the fun nature of the show,
aspiring performers are chosen for their spirit
rather than ability.
"The main thing I'm looking for — and it's
almost a cliche — is energy and enthusiasm.
That's more important than whether you've
played Hamlet 35 times on Broadway," says Di
rector Dan Goldman, a senior. He further ex
plains that Gaieties is probably the best oppor

hand on her hip and one knee slightly bent.
"Ooze with schmarm," Evans says as he
launches into the opening chords of "The Love
Boat" once again. Elder effortlessly warbles the
tune and doesn't even flinch when singing, "I
aaaaam an innocent ttiaaan" in the acting part of
her audition.
Later, as the lounge singers prepare to depart,
Elder reflects on competing for a stereotypically
male role. "Lounge lizards can be women. I think
women can be just as schmarmy as men," she
says.
While Elder says it was impossible to ignore
the competitive aspects of the audition with eight
others vying for the same part, she used a little ra
tionality to bring perspective to the experience.
"When you think about it, it's kind of ridiculous
that there's nine of us who are dying to be lounge
lizards," she says, laughing.
That night, when all the auditionees have
gone home, the Gaieties production staff begin
the painstaking process of deciding who will
claim the coveted parts. Goldman says this year a
decision was made not to post a cast list until a
full day after callbacks, so the staff wouldn't have
to stay up all night to make their announcements
by morning.
Not only does the staff have to decide who will
play all the main roles in a day, but they must also
choose the chorus members and decide which
ones will appear in which scenes, Goldman says.
The night after callbacks, Barlin, in his rounds
of congratulating roll -outs, rudely awakens
sophomore Brennan Carlson up in his Car
denal room at "about three in the morning."

(Carlson, who had been recently rolled out by an
a cappella group, apologizes profusely to his
"very understanding" roommate.
Carlson recalls feeling "excited, scared and
confused" as he found out the good news
through a sleepy haze.
The exuberant group overcomes their grog
giness, congregating at Lyon's for the first of
many cast-bonding experiences.
Stage manager Alison Duxbury, a junior,
said that in order to make cast members feel
they were a "part of an ensemble," the perform
ers were not told that morning what parts they
were assigned.
It isn't until the first rehearsal that the roles
are revealed. Carlson remembers being handed
a script, and "on the first page, left-justified,
there was the character name" — he had been
cast as the lead, "David."
"1 was really happy," Carlson says. "1 didn't
expect the part."
As rehearsals launch into full swing, auditions
— and roll-outs — are a distant memory. In one
of the Drama Department classrooms, Elder,
now officially a female lounge lizard, croons "I
aaam an innocent maaan" for real this time.

Ingrid Hoffman, a junior, calls out,
leading a dance with enthusiasm ap
proaching aerobics-instructor level. Assistant
choreographer Barbra Tibbies, a junior, backs
her up. A group of about 20 struggles to keep up
with them, kicking, jumping and posing.
T-minus 14 days and counting to opening
night. It's midterms week and the cast, attired in
T-shirts, sweats and jeans, is practicing at Elliot
Program Center, on a polished hardwood floor
and in front of a full-wall mirror — a scene rem
iniscent of "Fame."
"Does everyone remember the knee-jump?"
Hoffman asks, eliciting groans. She demon
strates the ballet-inspired move, "See, you lift
one knee up and ... jump. No problem. Every
one got it?"
Thuds echo and chaos ensues as everyone prac
tices on their own, with varying degrees of success.
"But where do the arms go?" someone asks.
While rehearsals are hard work — "you act,
dance, sing and sweat a lot" — Carlson says they
also are "a bonding experience" for the cast.
Having just transferred from the University of
Pennsylvania, Gaieties provides the perfect in
troduction to Big Game tradition and rivalry, he
adds.
Other cast members are Stanford veterans,
like third-year Law School student Rob Gor
man, one of only two graduate students in the
show. "It sounded like fun, like a good way to
meet people," he says.
Waiting their turn, a small group of cast
members sits in a back room and laments their
lack of dancing expertise.
"When I'm trying to learn a dance, I always
try to sneak to the back row so no one will see
me," junior Ryan Holland says. "Hopefully by
opening night I won't have to stay back there
and copy the tall women who can dance— I'm
always half a step late."
Egged on by concurring remarks, Holland
says,"And another thing. Singing and dancing
at the same time — I guess some people are able
to do that, but I can't seem to get that."
"I can sing. 1 can dance. But I can't do it at the
same time," Freshman John Chakan says,
laughing.
Sophomore Adam Fingerhut says he prac
tices the dances in his dorm room. So what does
his roommate think? "I don't practice when he's
there," Fingerhut says.
"I did it until my roommate found out,"
Chakan adds.
Back in the studio, Hoffman and Tibbies
are leading the dancers as they polish up
their routine. The movements are syn
chronized now, but the wear and tear of an hour

and a half of rehearsing are starting to show as
the jumps and kicks become less enthusiastic.
"Let's add the arm here. It looks better,"
Hoffman says, demonstrating the impromptu
revision. "Okay, now let's try the dance with the
music."
She turns on a tape recorder and an upbeat,
playful song filled with the usual Stanford-life
allusions comes on. The cast members sing
along. "Okay, ready? 5,6,7,8 ..Hoffman calls
out.
Suddenly, the moves that the dancers have
been practicing come together and the energy
level shoots up. The recharged performers are
smiling and bouncy once again, as the jumps are
higher and the arm movements snappier. Once
in a while, a stray arm or leg misfires, but with
the group's exuberance, nobody notices.
After they complete the number, cast mem
bers jump around, laugh and exchange high
fives. "That was so cool," one performer says,
hugging the dancer next to her.
"There's a totally different energy level when
we practice with the music," sophomore Chi
Chi Liang says. "It's when we start to feel like
everything's starting to come together."
Because the practices are segmented into
"read-throughs, sing-throughs" and dance
practices, cast members often don't see how a
certain song or routine fits into the bigger pic
ture until toward the end of the process, Liang
explains. "It's great to see it start to take form."
Sophomore Alice Feng echoes Liang's senti
ments, saying, "Sometimes practice is a drag,
but today it was really fun."
So when is practice not fun? "When you have
midterms," Fingerhut groans, lamenting the
fact that he has an exam the next day. He is not
among the few who have toted along books to

practice and sit in corners reading. Does anyone
get work done during practice? "What a joke,"
Fingerhut says.
"I've basically given up studying until De
cember," Chakan says, shrugging his shoulders.
As the cast enters into "Tech Week," members
are expecting to spend 45 hours in rehearsals.
As opening night draws closer, the practices
increasingly begin to resemble the final
product. Soon, the cast will move to Mem
Aud, so they can familiarize themselves with the
stage. Sets, costumes and the orchestra will fol
low shortly thereafter.
Sophomore Lori Ginsburg says the amount
of energy created by finally practicing on stage
with the orchestra is "incredible." A second
time Gaieties performer, she says, "Last year 1
was so tired after it was all done. I said, 'No way
am I trying out again.' "
But it was the feeling of the practices coming
together into a performance that drove her to
return. "I thought about that, and when audi
tions came around again, it was like, 'I gotta do
it,' " she says.
Opening night, when the final component
— the audience — falls into place, marks the
culmination of six weeks of rehearsals and a
year of planning and preparations. Ginsburg
says, "The only way I can describe it is as a
rush." ■

Ram's Head presents the annual Rig Game Gai
eties in Memorial Auditorium Nov. 17 through

nergy not talent!" Producer Dave Bar-
lin, a junior, calls out the mantra of
Ik Big Game Gaieties auditions as a herd
of aspiring performers, heads down in deep
concentration, march out Memorial Auditori
um's green-room door.

They don't call this a "cattle call" audition for
nothing. The large groups of auditionees stam
peding to and from the Mem Aud stage attest to
that.
Minutes after the first bunch marches
through the door, another group bursts in, still
wired from their audition. "I sang and acted
well, but boy did I dance horribly!" one hopeful
says to no one in particular, popping handfuls of
M&M's into his mouth. "That was fun. Can 1
audition again?"
Not far away, the tentative, nervous singing
of another would-be cast member on stage
slowly grows into a full-out operatic bellow as
he relaxes and gains confidence. As he finishes
his song, the enthusiastic applause of the staff
and peers echoes through the auditorium.
Thus begins another year of an age-old Stan
ford tradition, as yet another group of stu
dents — ranging from freshmen to trans
fers to Law School students — vie for a spot in
the cast of Gaieties.
Actually, the pieces of the Gaieties puzzle re
ally started falling into place right after the close
of last year's Gaieties, when the outgoing pro
ducer hired Barlin as the new producer. The
producer selected the rest of the staff. Then the
team of writers, headed this year by senior Jason

Mayland got to work.
The writing process is a culmination of indi
vidual and group efforts, ranging from "scenes
that are split up and written by two people to
everyone sitting around stone drunk all night and
writing," says Ram's Head Executive Producer
and Gaieties veteran Melissa Wilson, a senior.
Two months before last school year ended,
Mayland started to tie up the various compo
nents of the script, and worked on consolidating
it over the summer, Wilson says. However, the
script is always subject to revisions depending
on current events, at Stanford or elsewhere.
Meanwhile the technical crew — led by ju
nior Mark Brandt — orchestra and set directors
are also hard at work, awaiting the merging of
the Gaieties components.
But back in the green room, the onstage as
pects of the show are on everyone's mind
as auditionees mull around, some talking
excitedly, others singing and even a few pretend
ing to be deeply absorbed in course readers.
Participants and staff agree that Gaieties au
ditions differ from those of most other produc
tions because, true to the fun nature of the show,
aspiring performers are chosen for their spirit
rather than ability.
"The main thing I'm looking for — and it's
almost a cliche — is energy and enthusiasm.
That's more important than whether you've
played Hamlet 35 times on Broadway," says Di
rector Dan Goldman, a senior. He further ex
plains that Gaieties is probably the best oppor
tunity for "shower singers" to get involved in

the performing arts at Stanford.
Yet with over 75 people vying for only 30 to
35 cast positions, it does help to be able to sing
on-key, and maybe even dance.
"I've just got to make sure I don't get a danc
ing part," fifth-year senior Kyle Miller says em
phatically before his audition.
Almost an age-old tradition, dread of the
dancing is to Gaieties auditions what the show
itself is to Big Game. In a two-hour process, all
auditionees sing prepared or given songs, do
cold readings, and learn and perform a dance.
Another four auditionees sit down in the
green room, relieved but fidgety, and reflect on
their experiences.
"I was so psyched-out. The whole time I was
on cruise control," freshman Elliot Brown says,
leaning forward in his chair.
"It was pretty non-stressful," senior Tom
Russell comments, his feet propped up.
"Totally," junior John Lucero agrees.
"Everyone was really supportive," freshman
Heidi Schweiker says.
"Anything goes," Lucero says.
"It was great how everyone else was out there
cheering for you," Schweiker says."And the
staff wasn't sitting there with stern faces when
you were up."
"It's less of a competition and more group
oriented," Russell adds.
The next night, Memorial Auditorium is abuzz
once again, this time with callbacks for major
roles and dancers. Now, auditionees wander
around in smaller groups, more relaxed and con

fidenL They have made the first cut.
Onstage, actor-singers are competing for a
character simply referred to as "Lounge Singer."
Senior Ben Evans, the musical director, sits at the
piano and plays the chords of "The Love Boat"

for freshman George Lin.
Lin — who is dancing in place nonstop —<
hums the tune, then asks, "What if we don't
know the verses for the Love Boat?"
"Make them up. Now/ee/theschmarm you're
about to exude," Evans says, starting the opening
chords.
"The Love Boat ..Lin croons in his best
Wayne Newton imitation. Halfway through the
verse, he pauses in consternation, then belts out a
made-up verse that falls in perfectly with the
rhythm. "Maybe I'll be the lucky oooone." Fel
low auditionees and staff applaud and laugh as
Lin grins and dances offstage.
"It was different from what I expected," Lin
says after his audition. "The competition was
there, but I didn't feel it because it was fun."
Sue aspiring lounge singers later, sophomore
Lori Elder is up. Everyone notices her — she is the
only woman called back for the part. Confident,
she strikes a distinctly feminine pose on stage, one
hand on her hip and one knee slightly bent.
"Ooze with schmarm," Evans says as he
launches into the opening chords of "The Love

tune and doesn't even flinch when singing, "I

leading a dance with enthusiasm ap
proaching aerobics-instructor level. Assistant
choreographer Barbra Tibbies, a junior, backs
her up. A group of about 20 struggles to keep up
with them, kicking, jumping and posing.
T-minus 14 days and counting to opening
night. It's midterms week and the cast, attired in
T-shirts, sweats and jeans, is practicing at Elliot
Program Center, on a polished hardwood floor
and in front of a full-wall mirror — a scene rem
iniscent of "Fame."
"Does everyone remember the knee-jump?"
Hoffman asks, eliciting groans. She demon
strates the ballet-inspired move, "See, you lift
one knee up and ... jump. No problem. Every
one got it?"
Thuds echo and chaos ensues as everyone prac
tices on their own, with varying degrees of success.
"But where do the arms go?" someone asks.
While rehearsals are hard work — "you act,
dance, sing and sweat a lot" — Carlson says they
also are "a bonding experience" for the cast.
Having just transferred from the University of
Pennsylvania, Gaieties provides the perfect in
troduction to Big Game tradition and rivalry, he
adds.
Other cast members are Stanford veterans,
like third-year Law School student Rob Gor
man, one of only two graduate students in the
show. "It sounded like fun, like a good way to
meet people," he says.
Waiting their turn, a small group of cast
members sits in a back room and laments their
lack of dancing expertise.
"When I'm trying to learn a dance, I always
try to sneak to the back row so no one will see
me," junior Ryan Holland says. "Hopefully by
opening night I won't have to stay back there
and copy the tall women who can dance— I'm
always half a step late."
Egged on by concurring remarks, Holland
says,"And another thing. Singing and dancing
at the same time — I guess some people are able
to do that, but I can't seem to get that."
"I can sing. 1 can dance. But I can't do it at the
same time," Freshman John Chakan says,
laughing.
Sophomore Adam Fingerhut says he prac
tices the dances in his dorm room. So what does
his roommate think? "I don't practice when he's
there," Fingerhut says.
"I did it until my roommate found out,"
Chakan adds.
Back in the studio, Hoffman and Tibbies
are leading the dancers as they polish up
their routine. The movements are syn
chronized now, but the wear and tear of an hour

and a half of rehearsing are starting to show as
the jumps and kicks become less enthusiastic.
"Let's add the arm here. It looks better,"
Hoffman says, demonstrating the impromptu
revision. "Okay, now let's try the dance with the
music."
She turns on a tape recorder and an upbeat,
playful song filled with the usual Stanford-life
allusions comes on. The cast members sing
along. "Okay, ready? 5,6,7,8 ..Hoffman calls
out.
Suddenly, the moves that the dancers have
been practicing come together and the energy
level shoots up. The recharged performers are
smiling and bouncy once again, as the jumps are
higher and the arm movements snappier. Once
in a while, a stray arm or leg misfires, but with
the group's exuberance, nobody notices.
After they complete the number, cast mem
bers jump around, laugh and exchange high
fives. "That was so cool," one performer says,
hugging the dancer next to her.
"There's a totally different energy level when
we practice with the music," sophomore Chi
Chi Liang says. "It's when we start to feel like
everything's starting to come together."
Because the practices are segmented into
"read-throughs, sing-throughs" and dance
practices, cast members often don't see how a
certain song or routine fits into the bigger pic
ture until toward the end of the process, Liang
explains. "It's great to see it start to take form."
Sophomore Alice Feng echoes Liang's senti
ments, saying, "Sometimes practice is a drag,
but today it was really fun."
So when is practice not fun? "When you have
midterms," Fingerhut groans, lamenting the
fact that he has an exam the next day. He is not
among the few who have toted along books to

practice and sit in corners reading. Does anyone
get work done during practice? "What a joke,"
Fingerhut says.
"I've basically given up studying until De
cember," Chakan says, shrugging his shoulders.
As the cast enters into "Tech Week," members
are expecting to spend 45 hours in rehearsals.
As opening night draws closer, the practices
increasingly begin to resemble the final
product. Soon, the cast will move to Mem
Aud, so they can familiarize themselves with the
stage. Sets, costumes and the orchestra will fol
low shortly thereafter.
Sophomore Lori Ginsburg says the amount
of energy created by finally practicing on stage
with the orchestra is "incredible." A second
time Gaieties performer, she says, "Last year 1
was so tired after it was all done. I said, 'No way
am I trying out again.' "
But it was the feeling of the practices coming
together into a performance that drove her to
return. "I thought about that, and when audi
tions came around again, it was like, 'I gotta do
it,' " she says.
Opening night, when the final component
— the audience — falls into place, marks the
culmination of six weeks of rehearsals and a
year of planning and preparations. Ginsburg
says, "The only way I can describe it is as a
rush." ■

Ram's Head presents the annual Rig Game Gai
eties in Memorial Auditorium Nov. 17 through

nergy not talent!" Producer Dave Bar-
lin, a junior, calls out the mantra of
Ik Big Game Gaieties auditions as a herd
of aspiring performers, heads down in deep
concentration, march out Memorial Auditori
um's green-room door.

They don't call this a "cattle call" audition for
nothing. The large groups of auditionees stam
peding to and from the Mem Aud stage attest to
that.
Minutes after the first bunch marches
through the door, another group bursts in, still
wired from their audition. "I sang and acted
well, but boy did I dance horribly!" one hopeful
says to no one in particular, popping handfuls of
M&M's into his mouth. "That was fun. Can 1
audition again?"
Not far away, the tentative, nervous singing
of another would-be cast member on stage
slowly grows into a full-out operatic bellow as
he relaxes and gains confidence. As he finishes
his song, the enthusiastic applause of the staff
and peers echoes through the auditorium.
Thus begins another year of an age-old Stan
ford tradition, as yet another group of stu
dents — ranging from freshmen to trans
fers to Law School students — vie for a spot in
the cast of Gaieties.
Actually, the pieces of the Gaieties puzzle re
ally started falling into place right after the close
of last year's Gaieties, when the outgoing pro
ducer hired Barlin as the new producer. The
producer selected the rest of the staff. Then the
team of writers, headed this year by senior Jason

Mayland got to work.
The writing process is a culmination of indi
vidual and group efforts, ranging from "scenes
that are split up and written by two people to
everyone sitting around stone drunk all night and
writing," says Ram's Head Executive Producer
and Gaieties veteran Melissa Wilson, a senior.
Two months before last school year ended,
Mayland started to tie up the various compo
nents of the script, and worked on consolidating
it over the summer, Wilson says. However, the
script is always subject to revisions depending
on current events, at Stanford or elsewhere.
Meanwhile the technical crew — led by ju
nior Mark Brandt — orchestra and set directors
are also hard at work, awaiting the merging of
the Gaieties components.
But back in the green room, the onstage as
pects of the show are on everyone's mind
as auditionees mull around, some talking
excitedly, others singing and even a few pretend
ing to be deeply absorbed in course readers.
Participants and staff agree that Gaieties au
ditions differ from those of most other produc
tions because, true to the fun nature of the show,
aspiring performers are chosen for their spirit
rather than ability.
"The main thing I'm looking for — and it's
almost a cliche — is energy and enthusiasm.
That's more important than whether you've
played Hamlet 35 times on Broadway," says Di
rector Dan Goldman, a senior. He further ex
plains that Gaieties is probably the best oppor
tunity for "shower singers" to get involved in

the performing arts at Stanford.
Yet with over 75 people vying for only 30 to
35 cast positions, it does help to be able to sing
on-key, and maybe even dance.
"I've just got to make sure I don't get a danc
ing part," fifth-year senior Kyle Miller says em
phatically before his audition.
Almost an age-old tradition, dread of the
dancing is to Gaieties auditions what the show
itself is to Big Game. In a two-hour process, all
auditionees sing prepared or given songs, do
cold readings, and learn and perform a dance.
Another four auditionees sit down in the
green room, relieved but fidgety, and reflect on
their experiences.
"I was so psyched-out. The whole time I was
on cruise control," freshman Elliot Brown says,
leaning forward in his chair.
"It was pretty non-stressful," senior Tom
Russell comments, his feet propped up.
"Totally," junior John Lucero agrees.
"Everyone was really supportive," freshman
Heidi Schweiker says.
"Anything goes," Lucero says.
"It was great how everyone else was out there
cheering for you," Schweiker says."And the
staff wasn't sitting there with stern faces when
you were up."
"It's less of a competition and more group
oriented," Russell adds.
The next night, Memorial Auditorium is abuzz
once again, this time with callbacks for major
roles and dancers. Now, auditionees wander
around in smaller groups, more relaxed and con

fidenL They have made the first cut.
Onstage, actor-singers are competing for a
character simply referred to as "Lounge Singer."
Senior Ben Evans, the musical director, sits at the
piano and plays the chords of "The Love Boat"

for freshman George Lin.
Lin — who is dancing in place nonstop —<
hums the tune, then asks, "What if we don't
know the verses for the Love Boat?"
"Make them up. Now/ee/theschmarm you're
about to exude," Evans says, starting the opening
chords.
"The Love Boat ..Lin croons in his best
Wayne Newton imitation. Halfway through the
verse, he pauses in consternation, then belts out a
made-up verse that falls in perfectly with the
rhythm. "Maybe I'll be the lucky oooone." Fel
low auditionees and staff applaud and laugh as
Lin grins and dances offstage.
"It was different from what I expected," Lin
says after his audition. "The competition was
there, but I didn't feel it because it was fun."
Sue aspiring lounge singers later, sophomore
Lori Elder is up. Everyone notices her — she is the
only woman called back for the part. Confident,
she strikes a distinctly feminine pose on stage, one
hand on her hip and one knee slightly bent.
"Ooze with schmarm," Evans says as he
launches into the opening chords of "The Love
Boat" once again. Elder effortlessly warbles the
tune and doesn't even flinch when singing, "I
aaaaam an innocent ttiaaan" in the acting part of
her audition.
Later, as the lounge singers prepare to depart,
Elder reflects on competing for a stereotypically
male role. "Lounge lizards can be women. I think
women can be just as schmarmy as men," she
says.
While Elder says it was impossible to ignore
the competitive aspects of the audition with eight
others vying for the same part, she used a little ra
tionality to bring perspective to the experience.
"When you think about it, it's kind of ridiculous
that there's nine of us who are dying to be lounge
lizards," she says, laughing.
That night, when all the auditionees have
gone home, the Gaieties production staff begin
the painstaking process of deciding who will
claim the coveted parts. Goldman says this year a
decision was made not to post a cast list until a
full day after callbacks, so the staff wouldn't have
to stay up all night to make their announcements
by morning.
Not only does the staff have to decide who will
play all the main roles in a day, but they must also
choose the chorus members and decide which
ones will appear in which scenes, Goldman says.
The night after callbacks, Barlin, in his rounds
of congratulating roll -outs, rudely awakens
sophomore Brennan Carlson up in his Car
denal room at "about three in the morning."

(Carlson, who had been recently rolled out by an
a cappella group, apologizes profusely to his
"very understanding" roommate.
Carlson recalls feeling "excited, scared and
confused" as he found out the good news
through a sleepy haze.
The exuberant group overcomes their grog
giness, congregating at Lyon's for the first of
many cast-bonding experiences.
Stage manager Alison Duxbury, a junior,
said that in order to make cast members feel
they were a "part of an ensemble," the perform
ers were not told that morning what parts they
were assigned.
It isn't until the first rehearsal that the roles
are revealed. Carlson remembers being handed
a script, and "on the first page, left-justified,
there was the character name" — he had been
cast as the lead, "David."
"1 was really happy," Carlson says. "1 didn't
expect the part."
As rehearsals launch into full swing, auditions
— and roll-outs — are a distant memory. In one
of the Drama Department classrooms, Elder,
now officially a female lounge lizard, croons "I
aaam an innocent maaan" for real this time.
