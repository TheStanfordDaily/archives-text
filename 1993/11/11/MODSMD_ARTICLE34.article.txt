# Right paradise, wrong time
## Ashley Judd shines in Director Nunez's dull gem 
### 
Ruby Lee Gissing Heads to Panama City,
Fla., because "there's more to life than work
ing in Uncle Jack's store and taking crap from
men." While it's not exactly perfect, the sea
side resort is the closest thing to Shangri-La
the young heroine knows — a serene escape
from the miseries she's running from.
But all too soon, there's trouble in par
adise. For starters, Ruby has come at the

wrong time — all the tourists have left. ("It
was now or never," she mutters to herself.)
Ruby finally finds work in a deserted
beach-front store, selling the occasional sou
venir and halfheartedly fending off the boss'
son, a shallow rake complete with a red hot
rod and Elvis Presley pompadour.
Though Ruby finds Ricky "as appealing as
day-old road kill," we know, as does she, that

sex is inevitable. After all, there's nothing else to
do. As Ricky says, "We might as well get this out
of the way." Their first date is ingeniously inter
cut with shots of the couple later on, in bed.
After a few false starts, Panama City —
and the movie — start to groove. Busloads of
Canadians arrive for the winter and Ruby
meets a sensitive, trombone-playing, motor
cycle-riding, Jane Austen-reading, self-de
scribed "good guy" named Mike.
When he's not whipping up omelets and
stroking his goatee, Mike shows Ruby the soft
underside of plastic Panama City. Soon, she's
comparing him to an old sweater, "so perfect
1 wanted to wear it all the time, even when it
got hot."
But when Ricky confronts her about their
relationship, Ruby won't admit that she's see
ing someone else. As perfect as Mike is, she
doesn't want to belong to him — or to anyone.
As written and directed by Florida native
and indie veteran Victor Nunez, "Ruby in
Paradise" is more impressive for its restraint
than its revelations. Quick zooms and quirky
camera angles just barely break up the list
lessness of the off-season.
The real action takes place in Ruby's
stream-of-consciousness, as recorded in her
spiral-bound journal of observations and
epiphanies. Nunez is blessed with the quietly
spectacular performance of Ashley Judd, a
Ruby worthy of his lyrical and painfully hon
est script.
With her sleepy eyes and heavy cheeks,
Judd projects wisdom and serenity even in

the nastiest of situations. She's living proof
that a woman doesn't have to be tough to be
strong. And, surrounded by obnoxious
tourists and tacky souvenirs, Judd is a fresh
face and a soothing presence, totally uninhib
ited and unpretentious.
In one scene, she explores Ricky's beach
front apartment while he sleeps, opening
windows and drawers with perfectly disinter
ested curiosity. Another finds her home
alone, feet propped against the TV screen,
wrapped in a blanket.
As the men in Ruby's life, Bentley
Mitchum and Todd Field transcend their
types (pit bull and puppy dog, respectively)
to make Ruby's choice a difficult and com
pelling one. Field wisely keeps Mike just shy
of too-good-to-be-true, while Mitchum
drops his gigolo act frequently enough that
we see the neuroses behind the swagger.
Most of the film finds Ruby trying to de
cide "who's it gonna be and when and why,"
and then putting off that decision — she
didn't come all this way just to be someone's
girlfriend. But the film ultimately steers clear
of deep emotional waters to dwell on Ruby's
financial troubles — the least interesting and
unoriginal aspect of the plot.
The stage is set for a Hollywood ending as
debts are paid, bonds are renewed and spring
break descends on Panama City. But Nunez
refuses to sell his heroine short. "Ruby in Par
adise" ultimately suggests that the only par
adise is the one we create for ourselves.

and then putting off that decision — she
didn't come all this way just to be someone's
girlfriend. But the film ultimately steers clear
of deep emotional waters to dwell on Ruby's
financial troubles — the least interesting and
unoriginal aspect of the plot.
The stage is set for a Hollywood ending as
debts are paid, bonds are renewed and spring
break descends on Panama City. But Nunez
refuses to sell his heroine short. "Ruby in Par
adise" ultimately suggests that the only par
adise is the one we create for ourselves.
