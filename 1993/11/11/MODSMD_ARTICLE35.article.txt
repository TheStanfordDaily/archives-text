## A 						Home of Our Own 
### 
A film about a single mother and her six
kids packing it up in Los Angeles and haul
ing out to Idaho in 1962 in search of their
own house has great potential to be merely
an exercise in heavy nostalgia and schlock.
Fortunately "A Home of Our Own" manages
to avoid this all-too-common cinematic pit
fall.
Kathy Bates is ideal as Frances, the sin
gle working mother trying to provide for
her family, get along with her oldest son
and build the house that she has promised
her children. As a mother, Frances is no
Carol Brady — she whips her son, gives her
kids hardware for Christmas and won't ac
cept charity on their behalf. But she loves
her "tribe" (three boys, three girls) with-

out reservation, and
manages to get
through each obsta
cle, although not al
ways unscathed,
with witty deter
minedness.
She's no Julia
Roberts and this is no
fairy tale — no prince
is going to come and
whisk her away from
all her troubles. But
with the help of her

kids and benevolent next-door neighbor Mr.
Munimura (Soon-Teck Oh), maybe she can
pull through.
The central conflict is between Frances
and Shayne (Edward Furlong), a 15-year
old who, not surprisingly, resents being
poor and has had to grow up too fast for his
own liking after being appointed "man of
the family."
The helplessness and confusion of ado
lescence is powerfully depicted as Shayne
attempts to cope with his circumstances
and his complex relationship with his
mother.
Director Tony Bill is a miracle worker with
his actors, especially the children. With the
exception of the youngest daughter Annie
(Amy Sakasitz) who personifies cute overkill,
the rest of the children are naturals, and be
cause of them there are countless funny, gross
and touching moments.
Unfortunately, the film is narrated by a
grown-up Shayne, looking back and telling
you the story of his childhood. Usually narra
tion signals that the movie can't stand alone,
but since "A Home of Our Own" works so
well on its own, the voiceover came across as
a redundant distraction.
Without succumbing to sentimentality, "A
Home of Our Own" manages to spotlight the
process of learning to live with the family
you've got and the cards you've been dealt,
and doggone it, making the best of it.
