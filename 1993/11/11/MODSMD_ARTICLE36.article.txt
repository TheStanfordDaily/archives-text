# Robocop 3

There is really no point in giving "Robo
cop 3" a bad review. If you have seen the com
mercials, you probably have a good idea of
just how bad a film can be. But if you ab
solutely loved the previous "Robocops" and
enjoy bad acting, bad directing and bad one
liners, go ahead and see the movie.
The basic premise is simple. Omni Con
sumer Products, the vile super-corporation,
is ready to launch its next major project —
Delta City, a decaying Detroit reborn as the
vanguard of tomorrow's metropolis. Unfor
tunately, the construction area is currently
inhabited by thousands of helpless families.
Omni's solution: bring in mercenaries led by
the nefarious General McDaggett (John Cas
tle), "who has seen his share of carnage and
suffering, and thoroughly enjoyed every mo
ment of it."
Robocop (Robert Burke) starts off as a re
luctant ally in their efforts, but after a couple
of heart-wrenching forcible relocation scenes
— bzzzt! — he short circuits, disobeys his or
ders and joins the rebels.
Unfortunately, all you find in "Robocop 3"
is a mishmash of scenes from other films. Mix
Darth Vader and any "Lethal Weapon" villain
and you have McDaggett, and then add in
scenes of "Alien" s cute little girl crawling
through air ducts and a twist of "Star Trek; The
Next Generation" s Beverly Crusher (bril

liant, beautiful scientist with a heart of gold).
In the latest (and hopefully last) Robocop
saga, writer Frank Miller (of "Batman" fame)
tries to make his story take on the epic themes
of the conflicts of man vs. machine, good and
evil, raw and cooked, but he just ripped off
the plot from the original "Robocop." Only
(some of) the names have been changed to
fool the short-memoried.
It is not all bad, however: the sequel has
managed to capture some of the dark humor
that made the original entertaining. The fake
newscasts and commercials provide a gleam
of hope for this otherwise qualitatively chal
lenged movie. And Murphy / Robocop does
manage to get some good zingers in as he
proceeds to thrash the villains at the end.
But you have to wait way too long to get
there.... If you can see "Robocop 3" for free,
pull up a chair. Otherwise wait until it comes
out on Channel 44. It shouldn't take long.
