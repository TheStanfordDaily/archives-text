# The 						Quest continues
## 'Midnight Marauders' pushes a Tribe along

If we ever produce something you've heard
before, we no longer need to be around.

Even in an unstable, constantly evolving
art form like hip-hop, some truths are self
evident. Run-DMC are the kings of the "mid
dle" school; Rakim is the most gracefully
menacing emcee to ever hold a microphone;
freestyling is what truly separates the men
from the boys; and A Tribe Called Quest al
ways brings lucid, hypnotic, bass-heavy jams
to the Hi-Fi that are perfect for any situation.
Blame it on the luck of Lucien, but Tribe's
tight combination of jazz sensibilities and
ass-whuppin' funk is one of the few bright
beacons in a genre of dying light bulbs. Their
soulful music, like a pungent dose of Ben
Gay, has a power that soothes while it pene
trates.
Just mouth the phrase "new Tribe album"
and the average hip-hop fan will stop dead in
his tracks — his mouth watering like one of
Pavlov's dogs — and ask "When is it drop
ping!?" and "Where can 1 get it!?"
Their brilliant debut "Peoples Instinctive
Travels and the Paths of Rhythm" was the Na
tive bomb of '90 with the do-anything
grooves "Bonita Applebum," "Push It Along"
and "El Segundo." Then the group did the
unspeakable with "The Low End Theory,"
their sophomore effort: they produced an
album so devilishly rugged that upon release
it was immediately elevated to hip-hop clas
sicdom, a funky benchmark for all would-be
contenders to emulate. And now "Midnight
Marauders," Tribe's third installment in what
seems like an endless jazz-funk continuum,
does not disappoint.
But do we really need an encore? Like
Snoop Doggy Dog needs a plea bargain.
Reminiscent of Dr. Dre, the Questers strip

tracks down to their sparsest elements —
simple bass-lines, ponderous kick drums,
and little hits of melody. Like an East Coast,
Hard-bop version of "The Chronic," the
music makes you feel like you're rolling in a
car with the system booming and the top
down even when you're sitting still with the
lights out.
But "Midnight Marauders" 's real
strength, believe it or not, comes not from
the mesmerizing grooves or thought-pro
voking, easy-styled lyrics, but from its subtle
intensity. Devoid of screaming, bald-headed,
wanna-be hard MC's too preoccupied with
thrusting their burgeoning masculinity
down our eardrums, Q-Tip, Phife and Ali
Shaheed Muhammad have concocted a mod
ern-day "Bitches Brew" that, without warn
ing, snuffs us from behind.
"Award Tour" — with its strolling beat
and pleasing mixture of distorted "low-end"
and vibraphone arpeggios — gets the ball
rolling convincingly at Quest standards. But
the first of the album's bombs isn't detonated
until "Sucka Nigga." A captivating restruc
turing of the Freddie Hubbard blue-light
classic "Red Clay," the track's groove forcibly
occupies the listener's mind long after it ends.
And Tip's first verse buzzes with so much
acrobatic flavor that you almost don't realize
that he repeats the whole thing over again, in
verse two. (A couple of repetitions of this
jammie, and you can forget about going any
where for the next half an hour.) Still, with
"Midnight," "Electric Relaxation," "Oh My
God" and "Lyrics To Go" waiting in the
wings, the album's best is yet to come.
But music is the real showstopper in this
funk / rhythm extravaganza. The Questers
prove that jazz can come hard, soft, smooth
and sultry simultaneously. Even fickle hip
hop audiences, who were quick to jump on

the "Cool Like Dat" bandwagon, won't be
able to deny who the true jazz-rap masters
are.
"Midnight Marauders" loots for ears,
grooves with stylish verve and robs silly
suckas of their mainstream sensibilities. Like

its predecessors, "Marauders" is a schooling
of characteristically slick proportions 4 la
Grant Green's "Alive" and Lou Donaldson's
"Pretty Things."
Don't be late.

So what if Eddie Vedder and company are mainstream. Pearl Jam's latest effort "Vs."
proves that integrity doesn't have to get lost in the Top 40 shuffle.
