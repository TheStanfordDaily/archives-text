## "Live at Missouri U." Big Star 
### 
Although the Chicago Tribune can be ac
cused of hyperbole in claiming Big Star to be
"the most influential group in pop music ...
outside the Beatles," the band's latest recording,
"Columbia: Live at Missouri University,"
proves to be a definitive document both for the
band and of modern music
The early 70s power-pop band is certainly
the most important force in alternative music
nobody knows. Yet anybody who's heard the
folk-rock sound of R.E.M. or the punk-pop of

the now-defunct Re
placements has heard
a Big Star melody.
The band provides
the necessary link be
tween the "Fab Four"
and groups like
Teenage Fandub.
Putting aside their
historical signifi
cance and musical al
lusions, the group
plays pretty music.
Big Star shines in the

live recording made last April — just as it must
have two decades ago.
Two of the original members, legendary
front man Alex Chilton and drummer Jody
Stephens, are joined by Posies' Jon Auer and
Ken Stringfellow, filling the void left by de
ceased guitarist Chris Bell and AWOL bassist
Andy Hummel.
Despite the lineup change and the long lay
off, the band puts forth a remarkably smooth ef
fort. The sing-song vocals and the grinding gui
tar work linger long after the performance ends.
The album oozes with catchy mid-tempo
songs, evoking both melodies of the '60s and
modern pop standards. Chilton starts it off
with a bang, effortlessly laying his sweet voice
over the crunch of guitars in "On the Street,"
the album's first selection.
It's difficult to pick a favorite track; one
memorable tune follows another, drowning
out the one before. And while it is hard to
imagine any song more appealing than the
band's signature "I Am the Cosmos," Chilton's
crisp and sincere delivery of tunes like "The
Ballad of El Goodo" prove to be just as attrac
tive, if not more so.
While it's easy to get caught up in Big Star's
place in the progression of pop music, try not
to. Enjoy the delicious music for itself.
