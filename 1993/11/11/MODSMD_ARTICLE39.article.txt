# "No Alternative" Various Artists
## 
### 
At first glance, it's easy to be cynical about
"No Alternative," the third AJDS-benefit com
pilation produced by the Red Hot Organiza
tion. For one, though these types of endeavors
are attractive conceptually, they tend to ex
haust their shelf and disc-changer life quickly.
Moreover, the assemblage of musicians on
"No Alternative" is a veritable who's who of
the latest, hippest college radio darlings. You
could hardly be blamed for shying away from
a disc that appears to be little more than 74
straight minutes ofKZSU.
But give it a chance. "No Alternative" is a
splendid, cohesive collection that treats its
subject matter with the proper amounts of
sympathy and humor, and in doing so makes
believers out of a few skeptics.
Beginning with Buffalo Tom's jaunty "For
All to See," an exuberant celebration of youth
fill innocence, the album establishes an engag
ing melodic and lyrical quality. Other out
standing tracks include Urge Overkill's
poignant and lovely "Take a Walk" and Smash

ing Pumpkins' "Glynis," which demonstrates
the Pumpkins' pop craftsmanship buried
within swirling guitar and Billy Corgan's soar
ing falsetto.
While not every act's effort resounds con
vincingly (Sarah MacLachlan and Bob
Mould), their shortcomings are eclipsed by
surprising gems like Uncle Tupelo's remake of
Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Effigy" and
"Joed Out," a folksy ditty by Barbara Manning.
What is most impressive about "No Alter
native" is its thematic continuity, alternately
celebrating sexuality's whims while con
fronting the tragic reality of AIDS. Appropri
ately the album closes with Patti Smith's a cap
pella elegy for Robert Mapplethorpe, followed
by a tuneful, almost giddy track by Nirvana
not advertised on the disc jacket.
The only reason not to buy "No Alternative"
is that the cassette version contains additional
songs by Sonic Youth and Jonathan Richman.
At any rate, and in any form, the compilation is
the attempt of a restless generation of artists to
seize moral responsibility and discover the
depth of their musical possibilities. The results,
at least this once, are inspiring.
