# Salamander rescue
## Migrating amphibians saved from traffic during first rain 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Biologists demonstrated last
night that November rain is more
than just a song — it's a signal for
Stanford's tiger salamander popu
lation to begin its yearly migra
tion.
A group of five scientists —
headed by Mike Westphal, a re
search associate at the Coyote
Creek Riparian Station — started
working at 6:30 p.m. to transport
the endangered salamanders
across Junipero Serra Boulevard,
protecting them from traffic as
they trek across the street to lay
their eggs in Lake Lagunita.
"Almost all of the ones we've
seen are crossing over," Westphal
said. "My belief is that these are
the animals that have just come
out of (Lake Lagunita) this year."

The group is trying to preserve
the salamanders and also learn
more about their behavioral pat
terns.
According to Fraser Smith, a
post-doctoral student in ecology
and economics, the group's main
goal is to "move the salamanders
across the street, avoiding the
danger posed by passing automo
biles."
The workers, clad in orange
vests to make themselves visible
to passing cars, had found 48 live
and 45 dead salamanders by 11:00
p.m. Most of the dead amphibians
had been killed by passing cars.
"We look like the dweeb patrol
out here," admitted Westphal, re
ferring to the group's clothing.
But he stressed the importance of
the project. "Along this stretch of

road, we believe the salamanders
concentrate on the road above
ditches formed by culverts which
channel rain water," he said.
"That's another of the rea
sons we're doing this. ... so we
can decide whether tunnels
should be built under the road,"
he said.
In addition to searching along
the roadside for the amphibians,
junior Ted Lee examined cracks
in the sandbag wall across the
street from the lake for signs of
salamanders.
"So far, I've found 10," he said,
after searching the area for an
hour and a half. "In past years,
we've found 150 to 200 in this
area."

"There could be many reasons
why there aren't as many sala
manders (in the wall) this year,"
Lee said, adding that more of the
amphibians are likely to appear
later in the season.
Westphal explained that fami
lies of salamanders live in the
wall. "They feel safe in there
even though predators can still
get at them," he said, noting that
other animals also live in the
wall.
Last night will not be the
group's only effort at protecting
the salamanders. "Today is really
just a kind of look-see," Smith
said. "This is only the first real
rainfall of the season."
"If it continues to rain, we'll be
out here working tomorrow,"
Westphal said, adding that the
group'B study is far from com
plete.
