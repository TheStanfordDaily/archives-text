# Salamander rescue
## Migrating amphibians saved from traffic during first rain 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Biologists demonstrated last
night that November rain is more
than just a song — it's a signal for
Stanford's tiger salamander popu
lation to begin its yearly migra
tion.
A group of five scientists —
headed by Mike Westphal, a re
search associate at the Coyote
Creek Riparian Station — started
working at 6:30 p.m. to transport
the endangered salamanders
across Junipero Serra Boulevard,
protecting them from traffic as
they trek across the street to lay
their eggs in Lake Lagunita.
"Almost all of the ones we've
seen are crossing over," Westphal
said. "My belief is that these are
the animals that have just come
out of (Lake Lagunita) this year."

The group is trying to preserve
the salamanders and also learn
more about their behavioral pat
terns.
According to Fraser Smith, a
post-doctoral student in ecology
and economics, the group's main
goal is to "move the salamanders
across the street, avoiding the
danger posed by passing automo
biles."
The workers, clad in orange
vests to make themselves visible
to passing cars, had found 48 live
and 45 dead salamanders by 11:00
p.m. Most of the dead amphibians
had been killed by passing cars.
"We look like the dweeb patrol
out here," admitted Westphal, re
ferring to the group's clothing.
But he stressed the importance of
the project. "Along this stretch of
