# Tainted Love? Paul Rudnick's comic portrait 'Jeffrey'
## 
### Kimberly Chrisman 
surprisingly romantic and riotously
funny play, "Jeffrey" focuses on the
decidedly unromantic and unfunny
subject of AIDS. Paul Rudnick's reluctant
hero is an engaging young gay man — hand
some, promiscuous (he prefers the term
"cheap") and scared.
And it's no wonder. A kind of freelance
waiter, Jeffrey finds himself working more and
more AIDS fundraisers and memorial ser
vices. Frustrated and depressed, he swears off
sex and begins searching for a substitute ("Sex
Lite? Sex Helper? I Can't Believe It's Not Sex?").
Jeffrey's quest takes us on a sort of guided
tour of New York's gay community, from the
gym to a gay pride parade to the "Lower
Manhattan Gentlemen's Masturbation Soci
ety," and also through a series of cartoonish
fantasies, in which our hero competes on a
gay game show and has phone sex with his
parents.
What Jeffrey needs, according to his pal
Sterling, is a boyfriend — "like a wonderful
pet that can feed and walk itself."
Sterling should know — he's very happy
with his boyfriend Darius despite the latter's
HIV-positive status. Jeffrey remains skepti
cal — and celibate — until he meets Steve, a
charming bartender who might just be his

dream man, or his worst nightmare.
Steve is HIV-positive. He's come to terms
with death but can't handle ostracism — es
pecially from Jeffrey. "Don't admire me," he
finally snaps. "Fuck me."
As Jeffrey, Morgan Strickland is sweet and
bewildered, the perfect foil for Stephen Caf-

frey's aggressive, irresistible Steve. Peter
Bartlett is both dignified and bitchy as Ster
ling, while John Zic is touchingly vacant as
Darius. Darlene Popovic, in all the female
roles, is uniformly solid.
Rudnick's racy one-liners provide sharp
contrast to the horror of planning one's own
funeral and the injustice of homophobia.
"In a better world," Steve wistfully tells Jef

frey, "1 could ask you to square dance." After
being beat up by some teenage boys, Jeffrey
quips, "at least it was physical contact."
No subject is safe from Rudnick's searing
wit. "How dare you give up sex when there
are children in Europe who can't get a date?"
asks a priest. One suspects that the play-

wright is excusing his own levity as well as
that of his characters' with lines like, "Even
Brecht wrote musicals."
Rudnick exploits stereotypes — both gay
and straight — to comment on the universal
ity of love, sex and AIDS. His lineup includes
a swishy decorator, a zany self-help guru and
a ditzy dancer "too young for 'A Chorus Line'
and too happy for " 'Les Miz' " Jeffrey is, of

course, an aspiring actor. While these carica
tures usually push the limits of propriety
without overstepping them, one or two are so
overdone that even our hero is offended.
Director Christopher Ashley keeps the
action moving as fast as the dialogue, whip
ping up a relentless whirlwind of movement
and imagery. "Jeffrey" is at heart a series of
skits, loosely linked in the mind of the title
character, and audience participation is en
couraged. James Youmans's colorful sets
and clever slide projections add to the fun.
The play jumps from fantasy to reality
and back so often that by the time Jeffrey
runs into Mother Teresa — at Blockbuster
Video, no less — it's hard to tell whether or
not he's dreaming. And it doesn't matter.
"Jeffrey" ends on a happy note of com
promise, with an ultra-romantic finale atop
the Empire State Building. When it comes to
AIDS, Jeffrey realizes, "I am not an innocent
bystander."
Rudnick reminds us that these days, no
one is. ■
