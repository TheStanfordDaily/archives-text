The Beverly Hillbillies
While definitely in the stupid genre
of filmmaking, the nostalgia value of
the "Hillbillies" and several inspired
performances (Cloris Leachman,
Lily Tomlin, Diedrich Bader) save
the movie from utter unacceptability.
Despite its flaws, "The Beverly Hill
billies" remains a fun trip through
the time-warp machine. PG
Farewell My Concubine
The directorial method of shooting
through objects such as fire and
gauze aptly reflects the confusion of
China's ever-changing political situ
ation over the film's 32 years. Histo
ry is the dominant character, contin
ually interrupting and changing the
lives of the three main characters
and the Peking Opera of which they
are both a portion and a reflection. R
Fatal Instinct
Although it seems like it would be
just another parody of a tired film
genre, "Fatal Instinct" manages to
pull itself into the level of superior,
silly and sophomoric humor that is

always appreciated — given the
right state of mind. Featuring a
strong cast and references to almost
every big '80s blockbuster, it almost
makes you want to see "Jurassic
Fugitive." PG-13
Fearless
In a suspended moment when dis
aster strikes, when the end is un
avoidable, it is then that one can
say, "This is it — this is the moment
of death — I have no fear." Jeff
Bridges and Rosie Perez are justi
fied in fearlessness because their
superb portrayals of grief comple
ment a strong script and remarkable
directing to produce a film that flies
high. R
The Joy Luck Club
Grandiose, epic, tear-jerking and
gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous ...
this adaptation of Amy Tan's best
seller is all of the above. Moving de
spite its blatant commercialism,
"The Joy Luck Club" does a splen
did job of bringing the novel to life
and marks a monumental first for

Asian-Americans in Hollywood R
M. Butterfly
This adaptation of David Henry
Hwang's play could have been por
trayed as a pop-culture look at a naive
French diplomat deceived into kinky
sex by a conniving Chinese freak or a
thoughtful, if scathing, criticism of
popular perceptions of Asian women
and men. Fortunately, Hwang's col
laboration, the mgenius decision to
cast John Lone as Song Uling pre
serve the intended societal critique. R
Nightmare Before Christmas
Tim Burton's and the Walt Disney
Corporation's different management
styles lead to a remarkably uneven
film — the combination of Burton's
brilliant stop-action and Disney's
corporate caution. Despite potential
ly intriguing characters, the film is
cold, dry and unmoving — plotless
and heartless PG
Remains of the Oay
Possessed with ineluctable British
reserve, Anthony Hopkins plays a

manservant who suddenly finds his
code of loyalty no longer tenable In
1930s Britain. Hopkins gives an in
credible performance that is re
strained in word and deed, but nev
ertheless packed with the kind of
raw emotion that demands no less
than the finest acting performance.
More riveting than "Howard's End,"
"The Remains of the Day" is a
wrenching love story, a war movie
and above all a sympathetic portrait
of a decent though flawed human
being seeking to better his life. PG
Short Cuts
Unfortunately genius does not always
produce quality work, and Robert Alt
man's latest three-hour epic is proof
of that principle. A bittersweet ode to
life in a decaying Los Angeles based
on the writings of writer Raymond
Carver, Altman's series of vignettes
neglects its main character — the city
of Los Angeles. What remains is a
cutaway diagram of AJtman's director
ial prowess and a bunch of stories
and a poem more entertainingly busy
then poignantly literary. R
