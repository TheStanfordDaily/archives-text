The Tibetan Monks of the
Drepung Loseling Monastery bring
their performance of "Sacred Music /
Sacred Dance" to Stanford Memorial
Church on Friday, Nov. 12 at 8 p.m.
The Drepung Loseling ensemble
consists of nine performers, playing
instruments such as the long-horn
trumpet, cymbals, gyaling and
drums. The music sets the frame
work for multiphonic singing and
traditional dancing forms created
centuries ago. Each performance
stems from the mystical visionary of
a great sage or saint.
Tickets for the performance are
priced at $18, with a $3 discount for
students, and are available at the
Tresidder Ticket Office and through
any BASS outlet.
