# The 						last word on...
## "Phantom" 
### 
Okay, I confess.
I am one of the zillions of peo
ple who haven't yet seen "Phan
tom of the Opera." 1 own the
soundtrack and know every word
by heart. But when talking with
my fellow theater cohorts, I hang
my head in shame and wait silent
ly for the subject of our conversa
tions to head back to "Les Mis" or

some other Broadway epic
I've actually witnessed live.
But the fact is that 1 just

don't have eight gazillion dollars
to spare right in the middle of
midterms to splurge on a ticket
that won't really do me any good
until a decade from now — if
the show stays around that long.
So I exaggerate a wee bit. But
giving BASS $65 for an orchestra
seat for a matinee sometime next

quarter is a bit more than my
bank book can afford and my
pride can justify. I have no doubt
the show's good, but this is one
"Opera" nut who'll be hoarding
her CD and waiting for the next
time the show comes to town.
Of course, it'll cost $300 for
each balcony seat by then.
