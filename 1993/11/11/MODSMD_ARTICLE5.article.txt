A heated car chase involving several col
lisions ended early Tuesday morning with
the arrest of a Stanford medical student.
Stanford Police arrested Deron Paul
Johnson, 24, at 1:20 a.m. Tuesday, after he
pursued a Berkeley man down Palm Drive
and Arboretum Road, rear-ending his vehi
cle several times and eventually forcing him
off the road. Johnson was charged yester

day with one count of assault with a deadly
weapon.
Johnson is a graduate student at the
School of Medicine, according to University
records.
Li Yu, 30, a part-time student at UC-
Berkeley, was on campus visiting his girl
friend, a graduate student here. Yu said he
was driving his girlfriend, who asked that
her name not be released, to the Statistics
Department when the altercation with
Johnson began.

Yu was traveling north on Palm Drive
when he accidentally signaled and began to
turn left on the eastbound half of Campus
Drive. He saw Johnson's truck facing east
on Campus, about to turn right onto Palm.
Yu said that he then realized he was turning
the wrong way, and turned his car back onto
Palm Drive.
But Johnson stopped his pick-up truck,
getting out and motioning to Yu to roll down
his window, Yu said. Yu, wondering if there
was a problem, stopped his own car and

rolled the window down.
"He yelled, 'Did you see that's a one way
street?' " Yu said. "He was very angry."
Yu said he apologized to Johnson, telling
him that he had corrected his mistake. He
told Johnson that, since both were turning,
they had not even come close to hitting. This
only angered Johnson more, Yu said.
"Then he approached me," Yu said. "He
tried to take me out of the vehicle,
and then I left."
Yu fled down Palm Drive,
turning left on Arboretum. John
son got back in his truck and
began to chase him, Yu said.
According to Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, Johnson
first rammed into Yu's car on
Arboretum, near Quarry Road.
"Fortunately, one of our
deputies was parked near that
intersection and saw the whole

thing," Niemeyer said.
The officer clocked the chase in
excess of 75 miles per hour,
Niemeyer added.
Yu said Johnson impacted his
car at least 10 times during the
bumper-to-bumper chase. It
ended when Yu, about to enter
the intersection of Arboretum
and Sand Hill Road, slammed on
his brakes and spun out of control
and off the road. Johnson, still
colliding with him, skidded past
Yu and off the road as well, Yu
said.
Johnson, who has no prior
criminal record, was then arrest
ed with no problem, Niemeyer

said.
The victims were shaken, but
suffered no injuries.
"I wasn't hurt, but I was really
scared," Yu's girlfriend said.
Yu said his car, a 1989 Toyota
Celica, was rendered practically
inoperable.
"The brake system is gone and
all the tires need to be replaced,"
Yu said. "The mechanic said it's
best not to drive it."
Still, the outcome could have
been much worse, according to
Niemeyer.
"It's a bad case," Niemeyer
said. "They could have been
killed."
