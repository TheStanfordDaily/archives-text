The rumor has become reality.
Golfing sensation Tiger Woods
signed a letter of intent yesterday to
continue his athletic and academic
career at Stanford next year, fulfill
ing the rampant speculation that
has circulated the Farm for the past
two years. The native of Cypress,
Calif., chose Stanford over UNLV
and Arizona State.
The only three-time winner of
the national junior tournament,
Woods is also the youngest player
ever to compete in a PGA Tour
event â€” the Los Angeles Open in
1992 at age 16.
"He's amazing," said Cardinal
men's golf coach Wally Goodwin,
who added that Woods is "the best
junior player who has ever lived."
Goodwin looks forward to a
1994-95 golf team that will see
Woods combine with three return
ing Stanford All-Americans.
Woods, who carries a 3.7 grade
point average at Western High
School, made academics a top pri
ority in his college choice.
"School has always come first,
and that meant Stanford," he said
at a press conference. "I know my
golf won't improve as much at Stan
ford because of the (academics]."
Stanford will allow Woods to play
several PGA Tour events during the
collegiate golf season.
