No-u)te payments denied
TIENTON, N.J. (AP) — Gov.-elect
Chriftine Todd Whitman's campaign man
ager Baid yesterday he "went too far" in
claiming that the campaign paid black min
isters and Democratic workers to suppress
voter turnout. Whitman denied that such
payments were made.
"1 don't campaign that way. I urge peo
ple to vote, I don't suppress votes," Whit
man said.
Democratic officials, black clergy and
civil rights groups called for investigations
of the activities campaign manager Ed
Rollins had described.
Rollins said black ministers who had
endorsed Gov. Jim Florio were asked not to
extort their congregations to vote for the
governor. In return, he said, "We made con
tributions to their favorite charity." Rollins
said the campaign also paid some Demo

cratic political workers in urban areas to
stay home.
The Democratic State Committee will
seek a federal court order Monday allowing
it to take depositions from Rollins and oth
ers in the Whitman campaign.
House passes Brady bill
WASHINGTON (AP) - Responding to
public fear of street crime, the House
approved the Brady bill yesterday that will
require a five-day wait and a background
check on people who want to buy handguns.
The House voted 238-189 for the bill and
sent it to the Senate.
The Senate, meanwhile, continued slog
ging through its crime bill — temporarily
stalled over an amendment that would ban
assault-style weapons. Late Tuesday,
Republicans threatened to filibuster the
amendment.
