## Severed penis man walks free Jury acquits Bobbitt of sexual assault charge 
### 
MANASSAS, Va. (AP) - John Bob
bitt was acquitted yesterday of sexually
assaulting his wife after a jury rejected
her argument that she sliced off his
penis to retaliate "at the very thing that
harmed her."
"I'm thankful to the jury. They
believed me," Bobbitt said. "I just
want to get on with my life."
Bobbitt's wife, Lorena, will be tried
on Nov. 29 on a malicious wounding
charge. She faces up to 20 years in
prison if convicted, as her husband had
on a charge of marital sexual assault.
In closing arguments, both sides
focused on inconsistencies in the cou
ple's stories of what happened the
night of June 23.
"Why did she cut his penis off?
Something happened and I submit to

you something sexual happened that
offended her and drove her over the
edge," prosecutor Paul B. Ebert said.
Mrs. Bobbitt testified that her hus
band woke her, pinned her to their
bed, yanked off her underwear and
raped her.
Bobbitt testified that he initiated
sex and his wife didn't resist. His
lawyer, Gregory Murphy, said Mrs.
Bobbitt concocted a story of sexual
abuse because she was angry over the
dissolution of their four-year mar
riage.
"The prosecution tells you that two
wrongs don't make a right. Well, that's
right," Murphy told the jury. "The
emasculation of John Bobbitt is the
First wrong. The second wrong is the
fabrication of facts in this case."

Mrs. Bobbitt testified that after cut
ting off her husband's penis, she fled
their apartment and threw the severed
organ out her car window. Police found
it in the grass, and it was reattached in
a nine-hour operation. Bobbitt is recov
ering but has not yet regained sexual
function, doctors said.
Murphy listed a half-dozen points
where Mrs. Bobbitt's testimony contra
dicted other witnesses' or her previous
statements. He said she gave conflicting
statements about where she was on sev
eral days preceding the alleged attack,
and took scissors to her underwear to
make it appear they were ripped off her
body. A crime lab scientist testified the
tear appeared to come from force, but
an expert witness for Bobbitt said the
panties were cut.
