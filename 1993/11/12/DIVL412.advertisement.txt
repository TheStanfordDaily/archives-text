Sometimes autumn gets lost
in the shuffle. But it's a wonderful time
of year, especially at Mac Arthur Park.
We have warm fires burning in our
fireplaces, and special hearty seasonal
dishes. We'll even be serving
Thanksgiving dinner complete
with all the trimmings.
(Just give us a call if you're interested.)
Hurry in, though, in no time we'll all be
hearing about the number of shopping days
till Christmas.
