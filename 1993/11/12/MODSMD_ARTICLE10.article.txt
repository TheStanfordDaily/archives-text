New state on horizon
BAYAMON, Puerto Rico (AP) â€” Tens
of thousands of Puerto Ricans sang,
cheered and waved flags yesterday in the
final rallies before they cast votes for
statehood, continued commonwealth
status or independence.
Sunday's plebiscite is non-binding,
but Gov. Pedro Rossello told a pro-state
hood rally that if that options wins, he
will start working the next day to obtain
approval from Congress for the island to
become the 51st U.S. state.
"We're going to look for equality,"
Rossello said. "We're going to look for
the star of statehood."
Former Presidents Bush, Reagan and
Ford and Sen. Paul Simon, D-lU., have
backed statehood in recent ad cam
paigns; Sen. Edward Kennedy has urged
votes for commonwealth status.

As a commonwealth, Puerto Ricans
are U.S. citizens but do not have voting
representation in Congress. They also
get special tax breaks designed to attract
manufacturers to the poor island.
Jailbreak hunt revived
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Prompted
by new information from an ex-convict,
the U.S. Marshal's Service is reviving its
hunt for three bank robbers who escaped
Alcatraz Island three decades ago in one
of history's most celebrated jailbreaks.
Former inmate Thomas Kent recently
revealed new keads in the escape of
Franke Lee Morris and brothers Clarence
and John Anglin from the maximum
security prison known as "The Rock."
In light of Kent's story, "we think
there is a possibility they are alive," offi
cials said.
