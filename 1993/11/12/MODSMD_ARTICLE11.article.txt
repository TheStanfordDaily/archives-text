# U.N. tightens sanctions on Libya
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
Despite complaints it was doing too lit
tle too late, the Security Council voted
yesterday to tighten sanctions against
Libya for refusing to turn over sus
pects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am
jetliner.
The Security Council shied away
from hitting Libya where it would hurt
most: its oil exports of 1.5 million bar
rels a day, which generate $9 billion a
year in revenue. And U.S. Ambassador
Madeleine Albright was noncommittal
about whether Washington would try
again for an oil embargo. "We'll have to
see on that," she said.
Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over
Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988.
The vote was 11-0 with four absten
tions.
Susan Cohen, whose daughter was
among the bombing's 270 victims, com
plained the sanctions are inadequate
and unlikely to force Libyan leader

Moammar Gadhafi to surrender the
suspects to the United States and
Britain, where they are charged.
"The only thing likely to do the job is
a full oil embargo. This endless diplo
matic game at the U.N. is nothing but
an avoidance of action," Mrs. Cohen
told The Associated Press.
Dressed in black, Albright walked
over to speak with victims' families
after the vote. Later, she told the Secu
rity Council"the Libyan people will pay
a greater price" for each day their gov
ernment refuses to cooperate.
Despite initial U.S. support, Euro
pean nations heavily dependent on
Libyan oil blocked adoption of a
petroleum embargo.
The limited sanctions are scheduled
to take effect Dec. 1 unless Libya coop
erates.
Libya says it has urged the suspects
— Abdul Basset Ali al-Megrahi and
Lamen Khalifa Fhimah — to surrender

but cannot legally force them to do so.
The suspects say they want assur
ances of a fair trial in a neutral country.
The Libyan ambassador, Ali Elhouderi,
suggested the United States would not
be appropriate because of "areas of defi
ciency in the American judicial system,
which were revealed by the Rodney
King trial in Los Angeles."
It took a tussle with the Russians,
weeks of arduous negotiations and
intervention by President Clinton to
expand the sanctions. The United
States, Britain and France let an Oct. 1
deadline pass in an effort to win Russian
support and give Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali more time to
press the Libyans.
Although the sanctions include a
freeze on Libya's financial assets in for
eign bank accounts, diplomats believe
Tripoli already has withdrawn its liquid
assets in the four months it has known
the penalties were coming.
