## Editorial An influential voice The
						provost must listen to Stanford community in budget restructuring 
### 
WHAT HAVE the first few
years of the '90s taught
America? For one thing,
we must work more efficiently to
compete in lean times. Provost
Condoleezza Rice's plan for anoth
er $20 million in University budget
cuts has been framed in such pro
ductivity-minded terms.
But the '90s have taught us
something else, too: In an efficient
organization, the folks in the
trenches need to be involved in
decision-making. After all, they
often know better than the CEO
what administrative reforms will
work in practice, and they're the
ones who will have to implement
management's decisions.
Provost Rice must work to con
vince members of the Stanford
community, who have everything
to gain from a more efficient Uni
versity, that their role in the budget
cuts will be influential, rather than
ornamental. For her reforms to be
successfully implemented, faculty,
students and staff must feel confi
dent that their advice will affect
the outcome.
Rice's announcements have
emphasized that there will be less
faculty and student consultation
than in previous rounds of budget
cuts, ostensibly because this round
will focus on long-term restructur
ing rather than immediate budget
shortfalls.
But good reforms in administra
tion must be derived from the fun
damental missions of the Universi
ty — teaching and research.
Changing administrative support
for teaching and research will
inevitably affect University mem
bers' abilities to carry out their
part in its mission.
Students, faculty and staff
understand this fact, and many
believe they should participate in

budget planning for a nobler goal
than self-interest — they can sug
gest practical ways to pursue effi
ciency.
It's true that Stanford has some
times used inefficient methods to
enlist community expertise. In the
$43 million deficit reduction two
years ago, there were too many
committees and too many players
orchestrating the direction of the
process. The result was to de
emphasize a main goal — to identi
fy weak areas in academics and
administration and eliminate them.
The committee process, which
often focused on defending areas,
proved incapable of identifying spe
cific programs that should be cut,
and finally shared reductions across
a wide spectrum of units.
Rice is correct that we need more
direction for the restructuring
effort, and it is her responsibility to
provide that guidance. However,
faculty, students and staff need to
feel confident that they have the
ear of the provost, and that their
concerns will not be completely
ignored.
Suggestions for input into the
process through e-mail or campus
forums are completely appropriate,
but they have the dangerous poten
tial of becoming completely unidi
rectional. True involvement re
quires dialogue, and the provost
should specify how that will be car
ried out.
The debate over the sexual
harassment policy demonstrated
what happens when University
members are not confident that
they are being taken seriously.
While faculty and students were
not entirely opposed to the policy, it
seems likely there would have been
less reworking if the Faculty Sen
ate and student groups had been
more closely involved throughout
the process, especially in the cru
cial, final months.
To avoid such dangerous opposi
tion to her difficult restructuring
effort, Rice should provide a clear
definition of the way she will incor
porate University members' exper
tise into the new administrative
system.
