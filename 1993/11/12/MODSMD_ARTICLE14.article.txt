## What real life at Stanford? 
### 
THE Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter was trying to be helpful. When
they sponsored the Pacific Pre-Law
conference in Tresidder on Wednesday,
they thought that Stanford students
could have an early look at schools and
get inspired to apply. The only thing I
was inspired to do was to go back to my
room and huddle in the corner, waiting
for the overwhelming sense of fear to
subside.
The message from the cheerfully con
descending admissions officers from all
the "best" law schools was the same; get
ting in is no problem so long as you score
around the 99th percentile on the LSAT,
have a 4.0 in your triple major (in engi
neering, economics, and drama), and are
a world-class tuba player from Saska
toon. Ooops. Maybe I shouldn't have
dropped those accordion lessons in the
third grade.
This is a typical dilemma for many
Stanford students no matter what disci
pline they come from. Grad schools want
"people people," but more than that, they
want "well-rounded, diverse people peo
ple with life experience."
Now, if there's one thing we don't
have at Stanford, it's lives, so where does
that leave us?
McDonald's. Sad but true. The fact is,
that in spite of our improved minds,
most Stanford students other than those
in engineering, computer science or

chemistry will have no marketable skills
when (and if) they graduate. This does
not disturb me too much. I knew coming
into it that I would not receive a techni
cal, skills-oriented education in the
English major.
I figured that I could always bury my
head in the academic sand and go
straight on to graduate school. But now,
in a sick twist of fate, post-graduate
institutions are demanding impressive,
real-world experience of their appli
cants.
Now, I ask you, does this make sense?
If I wanted "real-world," would I have
come to Stanford in the first place? I
don't think so.
Yet, the admissions committees think
that we should leave school and waltz
into impressive, society-altering jobs. We
are then to ditch the careers we have
carved for ourselves in order to start all
over again at the bottom of somebody
else's totem pole. Go figure.
It all comes down to this; I never
should have dropped Chemistry 35. At
the end of my frosh year, I woke up one
morning, having slept through lecture,
and realized that pre-med was not what I
wanted to be doing with my time. Ah, the
foolish, heady days of youth! At least as a
pre-med, I could've gotten a job as a lab
technician after I was rejected every
where. Now I'm left checking out fast
food uniforms to pick out which ones I'd

look best in.
Not that I don't respect people who
work at "non-prestige" jobs. All labor is
dignified and vital. But, 1 did not drain
my parents' retirement savings to spend
my life asking, "Did you want fries with
that?"
Time was, that undirected youths like
yours truly could "join the Navy and see
the world." Unfortunately, thanks to
defense cutbacks, that's no longer an
option either.
When did they change the rules on us?
All through high school and most of col
lege, we've been told that hard work and
a single-minded sense of purpose were
good things. I don't mind that experi
mentation and mature self-evaluation
are now "in"; I just wish they'd told me
that earlier.
Fortunately though, my reality check
was a little premature. I've got another
year to worry about it, or that is, ignore
it. I'll take some more obscure literature
classes and work anywhere that'll pay me
this summer. Maybe by next year
grumpy, white, female, do-nothings will
be the ideal law school applicants. It
could happen.

Kathleen is now trying to figure out how
to make grumpiness a marketable skill.

Fortunately though, my reality check
was a little premature. I've got another
year to worry about it, or that is, ignore
it. I'll take some more obscure literature
classes and work anywhere that'll pay me
this summer. Maybe by next year
grumpy, white, female, do-nothings will
be the ideal law school applicants. It
could happen.

Kathleen is now trying to figure out how
to make grumpiness a marketable skill.
