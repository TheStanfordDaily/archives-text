## Student input is necessary in budget-cutting process 
### 
I WAS dismayed but not exactly sur
prised to read of Stanford's plans to
cut $20 million over'the next three
years by trimming administration and
eliminating outright so-called "weak"
academic areas.
The proposal to eliminate academic
programs is regrettable, and the fact
that Provost Condoleezza Rice does not
plan on broad, community-wide consul
tation is inexcusable.
The logic seems to be that this cut is
only $20 million, not $43 million, so no
one should get upset about it. Just
remain "calm" (and quiet), they advise
us, and it will only hurt a little bit.
I'm not excited about the cuts, but I

am even more displeased at the Univer
sity's gross disregard of student con
cerns and well-being.
The message Stanford sends to its
students is to be seen and not heard.
Smile inanely on "Good Morning Amer
ica"and then docilely accept tuition
increases for reduced academic offer
ings.
The so-called "weak" programs which
we will lose are those which don't bring
in big dollars from the federal govern
ment. That means Drama, that means
Creative Writing, that means "esoteric"
pursuits like art, which enliven the intel
lectual and cultural life of this otherwise
barren campus.

Somehow, I can't see the Athletics,
Engineering or Economic Departments
quaking in their boots for fear of losing
their funding; they are too busy con
structing ostentatious, multi-million dol
lar buildings.
It is of course a step in the right
direction to reduce administrative costs,
but before cutting integral academic pro
grams, Stanford should take a close look
at unnecessary expenses like the massive
waste in University Food Service. There
is simply too much money and waste on
this campus for the University to claim
poverty.
Furthermore, if Stanford allows
shrinking Defense Department dollars to

determine its post-Cold War educational
vision, we will be left with a bizarre and
deformed institution: a kind of Califor
nia Institute of Technology of the north
with a top-rated football team.
The sad thing is, the University
knows that it can pull this maneuver off
without too much difficulty. Stanford
students, no matter how high our SAT
scores, have shown ourselves to be
amazingly passive.
Our noses are so close to either the
grindstone or the beer keg that we can't
even see, let alone protest, what is going
on right in front of our eyes.
