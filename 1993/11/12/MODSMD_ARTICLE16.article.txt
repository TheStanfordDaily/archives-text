# Taco Bell in Tresidder shows a willingness to heed student requests
## 
### 
In his Nov. 10 letter to The Daily,
Michael Brylawski claims the Universi
ty's position on student-operated food
service hinders student initiative. Con
sequently, he thinks Taco Bell is a bad
idea. Yes, the University needs to sup
port self-ops, semi-self-ops, and co-ops.
And yes, the loss of businesses like
Nick's Diner hurts the student popula
tion. Student-managed residences and
food service are an integral part of Resi
dential Education.
I would like nothing more than to see
Housing and Dining Services remove
some of the bureaucratic hassles facing
students who attempt to provide for
themselves. However, the $70,000
Tresidder spent improving its facilities
in preparation for Taco Bell has abso
lutely no chance of going to support stu
dent-operated food service. The money
comes from a reserve account specifical

ly created for projects of this nature.
Associate Director of Tresidder
Union and Associate Dean of Students
Paul Szczesiul and the other Tresidder
Board members for bringing
us "greasy, heart-clogging tacos" have
done a tremendous job in responding to
the interests of students. As an under
graduate senator and row resident assis
tant, I am very much aware of the gen
eral lack of concern administrators have
for student input. Taco Bell is here
because a number of students want it.
This leads me to believe that adminis
trators in other departments (perhaps
even academic ones) will listen to stu
dent input.
With regard to Brylawski's doubts
about the popularity of bean burritos,
Taco Bell ranks right up there with Bill
Walsh. Currently, Tresidder Union has
no fast-food dining service with proven
appeal and an inexpensive menu. Taco
Bell puts out the ideal college food: fast,
cheap and popular. Undoubtedly, a large
percentage of Stanford students will reap
the benefits of Taco Bell at Tresidder.
Any student who has taken Eco
nomics 1 understands that having a
variety of dining options to choose from

only raises the quality of food and low
ers the price. Instead of complaining
about the lack of representation in
Tresidder's decision-making process and
attacking a group of very receptive
administrators, Brylawski and other
skeptics should explore ways to voice
their opinions and concerns about stu
dent eating needs.
