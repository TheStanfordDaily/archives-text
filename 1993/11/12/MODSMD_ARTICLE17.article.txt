# Daily headline shows stereotype that women must have thin thighs
## 
### 
We would like to thank The Daily for
informing us in its Nov. 11 edition that
large thighs are considered an affliction
in need of a cure. The title of the article
on the fat-reducing lotion ran, "Fat
lotion cures large thighs." Thoughtless
headlines such as this one reflect and
perpetuate the prevalent attitude in
today's society that not being skinny is
a disease. Obesity is a disease; large
thighs are not.

As alarming as this headline is, the fact
that a fat-reducing lotion may be market
ed to the general public is even more dis
turbing. Unfortunately, for many
women, body image is closely linked to
self-esteem, and products such as this
one signal to women that they can buy
their self-esteem in little plastic tubes.
Although we feel that most Stanford
students are particularly sensitive to
body-image issues, both the headline
and the "scientific breakthrough" tone
of the article indicate that we have a
long way to go before we begin to accept
our bodies as they are.
