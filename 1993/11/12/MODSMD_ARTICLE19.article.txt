## Finding a miracle cure for Saturday night fever 
### 
1;M NOT WORTHY. There I sat, star
ing at the e-mail S.O.S. before me. It
was Bob (names not changed to pro
tect the innocent; you've gotta lay your
balls on the line at some point in this
life). Bob, a young, nubile frosh from
East Lag reaching out for guidance. Bob
was bored. Bob wanted to have fun. Bob
figured this could not be such a difficult
thing. Bob asked me for help.
Me, a raucous, rebellious upper
classpersyn looking to pat his tuckus in
the right direction. Me, just the one who
could nestle him in my bosom and offer
a few breathy words of wisdom, a glim
mer of hope, my phone number.
Bob had come to the right place.
Me, a whiny, jaded senior, Buffering
along with Bob through fraternity-road
trip weekend. Me, who'd be suffering the
same fate during the endless fraternity
formal weekends to come. Me, patheti
cally checking my e-mail messages on a
solitary Saturday night — passing
minute after minute of the best years of
my life writing mechanical engineers on
study breaks.

Bob had come to the wrong place.
I panicked, trying to think what in
the hell kind of suggestions I could offer
Bob. Perhaps a few entries from my
own, outrageously jam-packed Satur
day-night schedule. Noooo problem.
What to do on campus? Where's the
challenge? Think. Think. There had to
be something.
You could, say, rent a video and have a
movie marathon. Disney flicks are
always great. Find phallic imagery in
"The Little Mermaid." Pick out racist
undertones in "Aladdin." Imitate the lit
tle girl's annoying speech impediment in
"Escape from Witch Mountain." This is
barrels o' fun for the whole family,
bound to keep you and your dormmates
wallowing in ecstatic glee for hours on
end, wondering how life could be so good.
When you wish upon a star.
Or you could go for the alternative
party scene. After spending 15 minutes
with my nose pressed against the front
window of the Phi Delt house, wishing
my two breasts would be exchangeable
currency worth my name on the guest

list, I usually head over to the obscure
Row houses to find out what the weird
and wonderful are up to.
Settling onto a nasty, mildewed couch
at some co-op, this is a unique opportu
nity to watch people you don't know play
pool/bake bread/gyrate to psychedelic
disco beats. Be just a little friendly and
soon you'll find yourself discussing the
attractiveness of human buttocks with
total strangers and comparing stomach
hair with members of the opposite sex.
You could do a comparative butt testing,
analyzing your friends' butts, your
friends' girlfriends' butts, rating them
on a scale of gross to tolerable.
It doesn't get any better than this.
Or you could do the Eurotrash thing
and head on over to see what wacky,
eclectic masses are gathered at the Coffee
House, that bastion of secular campus
coolness. I like to watch the guys playing
chess at the outside tables, with the fate
of transitional Eastern European coun
tries on the line — running over and lick
ing their ears so they lose valuable sec
onds and concentration ability.

For living-on-the-edge rebelliousness,
I like to pilfer strangers' double mochas,
snatching them from servers and quick
ly stirring them with my cootie-laced
index finger like a dog staking its claim
with urine. Or wave to lots of people I
don't really know to confirm my mean
ingless existence. If I get bored, I spend
a good 15 minutes with the people out
back debating the nature of god, scratch
ing my chin artfully and pretending
cigarette smoke doesn't bother me.
Now's the time on Sprockets when we
dance.
Around 11 p.m., I wander back to the
dorm, hoping someone else has
painstakingly planned a spontaneous
progressive where dorm funds will ille
gally be spent concocting vomitory alco
holic mixtures named after sexual acts
ruled illegal in Virginia. Hoping maybe a
back-rub session has busted out. Hoping
maybe one or two doors will be open so I
can talk to someone, anyone.
Is there anybody out there?
See, there's a bucket-full of stuff to do
at Stanford. It just never lives up to the

mythical image I have of college life —
Bacchanalian orgies, fun with candle
wax, monster truck shows in the Quad.
It's time for those two blue-polyester
clad beefcakes from "Emergency" to
give the social scene a de-fib, exposing
its flabby mid-section to god and every
body, for the greater good of the choles
terol-clogged student body. Time to
bring it back from the depths of lame
ness. Time to bring it up to par with the
lifestyle of state schools described by
exaggerating pathological liars from my
high school. Thy kingdom come, it will
be done.
Bob, give it the old college try.

Tish apologizes to Bob for making a col
umn at his expense. Hopefully his dorm
mates won't shun him. Hopefully he will
learn to forgive her somewhere along the
line. He should be grateful she didn't
put his full name.
