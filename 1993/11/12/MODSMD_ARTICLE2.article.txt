# It's a small world after all
## IIS council discusses population, conflicts 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Dignitaries from around the world warned
of the dangers presented by population explo
sion and the changing world power structure
as the Institute for International Studies Advi
sory Council convened its third conference yes
terday.
In an afternoon session titled "Science in
Space," members were introduced to an exam
ple of Stanford's involvement in international
scientific research — the Gravity Probe B pro
ject — to engender discussion of the role the
University should play in that area.

The advisory council is composed of 39 in
ternational leaders in politics, business and
academia who meet about every 18 months to
look at and comment on Stanford's programs
related to global affairs.
Aeronautics and Astronautics Prof. Brad
Parkinson and Physics Prof. Francis Everitt
tried to describe the concepts behind Gravity
Probe B — which will study Einstein's Gener
al Theory of Relativity — in layman's terms,
passing around models of the key part of the
satellite to council members.
Discussion after the introduction centered
around questions from council members on
the appropriations process for scientific pro

jects and the involvement of other countries in
Stanford research.
About 140 faculty members and guests —
including Provost Condoleezza Rice and for
mer University President Richard Lyman —
joined 20 council members earlier in the day to
lunch on chicken salad and listen to comments
by several dignitaries on the problems the
world will face in the future.
We "must recognize the centrality of the
issue of population explosion" declared former
Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke in a
brief speech. Quoting from a statement made
by Jacques Cousteau at last
year's environmental conference
in Rio de Janeiro, Hawke said
"surviving like rats is not the
[life] we should bequeath to our
children."
Former Soviet Foreign Minis
ter Alexander Bessmertnykh
focused on the dangers of nuclear
weapons in the post-Cold War
era. "The world is over-milita
rized. .. . Even if we wanted to
[dispose of all nuclear weapons],
we don't have the resources to do
it entirely," he said.
However, Bessmertnykh added
that he believes that "the scien
tists of the world will be able to
meet the challenge" of cleaning
up nuclear waste and avoiding
ecological disaster.
Former West German Chan
cellor Helmut Schmidt said that
the West must pay attention to
developments in Asia, especially
the strong growth in China.
"Within 20 or 25 years, China will
have overtaken by far" the size of
the Japanese and U.S. economies,
he said.

During discussion of Stan
ford's work in science, Parkinson
focused on the value of the "unex
pected spin-offs" that research
engenders. "The unexpected
almost becomes expected," he
said.
The scientists stressed the sig
nificance of a recent innovation
made by a member of the Gravity
Probe B team that could make it
easier and cheaper to operate air
ports in nations that might not
be able to afford them otherwise.
"There are a lot of opportuni
ties now for joint efforts ....
[Russian scientists! want to use
their potential but they don't
know how" because of budget
cuts, Bessmertnykh said.
"If Stanford is interested, per
haps we could do something" to
involve them, he added.
Walter Falcon, the institute's
director, said he was pleased
with the issues raised in the
meetings yesterday."The council
members seemed impressed with
the global implications of our
research and the number of
international students in
volved," he said. "We're delight
ed with the large turnout, and we
were very stimulated by the lun
cheon conversation."
