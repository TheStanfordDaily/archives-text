## Booters to face Cal at home in NCAA playoff action 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
For the die-hard soccer fan, this week
end's action will be heaven on earth as
the Stanford women's squad hosts the
1993 NCAA Western Regionals, bringing
four of the top 13 teams in the nation to
fight it out for a trip to the Final Four.

The first round of action, taking place
tomorrow, features two rematches from
earlier this season. No. 2 Stanford (16-2-
1) faces No. 13 California (10-3-4) in the
first game at 11 a.m. Previously this
year, Stanford upset then second-ranked
Cal 4-0 at Berkeley on Oct. 23, behind the

foot of Sarah Rafanelli, who scored two
goals.
The second game pits fourth-ranked
Santa Clara (14-4-1) against No. 7 Port
land (15-3-1), whom the Broncos defeat
ed 3-1 in overtime on Oct. 8, knocking
the Pilots from their then-No. 2 ranking.
The Santa Clara-Portland game is sched
uled to start at 1:30 p.m.
The winners of Saturday's two games
will face off Sunday at 1 p.m. with the
Western Region's bid to the Final Four at
stake, the site of which will be deter
mined Sunday or Monday.
While Cardinal head coach lan
Sawyers would like a similar result to the

first Cal game, he doesn't want a replay
of the game itself.
"Obviously, that wasn't the greatest
game we ever played, because the I Call
field didn't really allow us to play the way
we wanted to play," Sawyers said. "I'm
not sure how we're going to approach the
Cal game. We're not exactly sure whether
we'll play with three or four up front."
Fortunately for Stanford, the game
will be held in the friendly confines of
Maloney Field, where the Cardinal is 7-0
this year, outscoring the opponents 27-2.
In Stanford's win over the Golden
Bears earlier this season, the Cardinal
were paced by Rafanelli's two goals,

adding to her team-high total of 18 for
the season, along with eight assists. Her
44 points are tops for Stanford, followed
closely by freshman Erin Martin's 14
goals and 10 assists for 38 points.
While Cal's offense does not boast one
or two dominant players, several Bears
have put together consistent seasons.
Erika Hinton leads Cal with nine goals
and five assists, with Alexia Thompson
(eight goals, five assists) and Stacey Juhl
(four goals, two assists) rounding out the
Bears' top scorers.
The Berkeley defense is anchored by
goalkeeper Kyla Schmedding, who has
allowed only 14 goals this year for a .97

goals-against-average.
Although a win Saturday would put
the Cardinal into the Regional Finals,
head coach lan Sawyers is not looking
past the Golden Bears.
"The most important thing is that we
have to win on Saturday," Sawyers said.
"If we win and then play Santa Clara,
fine. If we play Portland, it's an unknown
team [this yearl but we played them last
year, so we basically know the way they
play. Our kids have been really good this
year being able to adjust on the fly."
In Saturday's second game, West
Coast Conference rivals Santa
Clara and Portland face off for a
rematch of a very close game ear
lier this year. Although the Bron
cos won 3-1 in overtime, the
Pilots have played consistent soc
cer all season and should give
Santa Clara plenty of problems.
The Bronco offense, led by
freshmen forwards Mikka
Hansen and Erin Martinez, is

triggered by sophomore midfield
er Jennifer Lalor, who has assist
ed on a remarkable 15 goals this
year.
Foremost among areas of con
cern for the Broncos should be the
need to shut down sophomore
Shannon MacMillan, the nation's
top scorer. Recording 22 goals and
12 assists this year, MacMillan's
scoring ability looms large on the
minds of Santa Clara coaches,
who have seen their team victim
ized by top goal-scoring threats
like Rafanelli. The Stanford pow
erhouse scored two goals in less

than two minutes against the
Broncos in Stanford's 2-0 win at
Santa Clara on Nov. 4.
With its 15-3-1 record, Port
land has quietly put together an
exceptional season. Removing the
Santa Clara overtime loss and
another overtime setback, a 4-1
loss to Colorado College, the
Pilots have a virtually unblem
ished record, with their only other
loss inflicted by top-ranked North
Carolina by a narrow 2-0 margin.
Although weather reports pre
dict clear skies for Saturday, the
past few days have hinted at dark

er conditions. Regardless,
Sawyers is not worried about rain
hurting Stanford's chances.
If it does rain, however, the
Cardinal will most likely depend
on its excellent defense to set the
tempo. For the year, Stanford has
allowed only seven goals, with
goalkeeper Leslie Garrard record
ing a 0.37 goals-against-average
and 15 shutouts.
"I'm really happy with the way
we've finished up the season,"
Sawyers said. I feel we've devel
oped a rhythm and some momen
tum going into postseason. Hope-

Carolina by a narrow 2-0 margin.
Although weather reports pre
dict clear skies for Saturday, the
past few days have hinted at dark

er conditions. Regardless,
Sawyers is not worried about rain
hurting Stanford's chances.
If it does rain, however, the
Cardinal will most likely depend
on its excellent defense to set the
tempo. For the year, Stanford has
allowed only seven goals, with
goalkeeper Leslie Garrard record
ing a 0.37 goals-against-average
and 15 shutouts.
"I'm really happy with the way
we've finished up the season,"
Sawyers said. I feel we've devel

For the die-hard soccer fan, this week
end's action will be heaven on earth as
the Stanford women's squad hosts the
1993 NCAA Western Regionals, bringing
four of the top 13 teams in the nation to
fight it out for a trip to the Final Four.

The first round of action, taking place
tomorrow, features two rematches from
earlier this season. No. 2 Stanford (16-2-
1) faces No. 13 California (10-3-4) in the
first game at 11 a.m. Previously this
year, Stanford upset then second-ranked
Cal 4-0 at Berkeley on Oct. 23, behind the

foot of Sarah Rafanelli, who scored two
goals.
The second game pits fourth-ranked
Santa Clara (14-4-1) against No. 7 Port
land (15-3-1), whom the Broncos defeat
ed 3-1 in overtime on Oct. 8, knocking
the Pilots from their then-No. 2 ranking.
The Santa Clara-Portland game is sched
uled to start at 1:30 p.m.
The winners of Saturday's two games
will face off Sunday at 1 p.m. with the
Western Region's bid to the Final Four at
stake, the site of which will be deter
mined Sunday or Monday.
While Cardinal head coach lan
Sawyers would like a similar result to the

first Cal game, he doesn't want a replay
of the game itself.
"Obviously, that wasn't the greatest
game we ever played, because the I Call
field didn't really allow us to play the way
we wanted to play," Sawyers said. "I'm
not sure how we're going to approach the
Cal game. We're not exactly sure whether
we'll play with three or four up front."
Fortunately for Stanford, the game
will be held in the friendly confines of
Maloney Field, where the Cardinal is 7-0
this year, outscoring the opponents 27-2.
In Stanford's win over the Golden
Bears earlier this season, the Cardinal
were paced by Rafanelli's two goals,

adding to her team-high total of 18 for
the season, along with eight assists. Her
44 points are tops for Stanford, followed
closely by freshman Erin Martin's 14
goals and 10 assists for 38 points.
While Cal's offense does not boast one
or two dominant players, several Bears
have put together consistent seasons.
Erika Hinton leads Cal with nine goals
and five assists, with Alexia Thompson
(eight goals, five assists) and Stacey Juhl
(four goals, two assists) rounding out the
Bears' top scorers.
The Berkeley defense is anchored by
goalkeeper Kyla Schmedding, who has
allowed only 14 goals this year for a .97

goals-against-average.
Although a win Saturday would put
the Cardinal into the Regional Finals,
head coach lan Sawyers is not looking
past the Golden Bears.
"The most important thing is that we
have to win on Saturday," Sawyers said.
"If we win and then play Santa Clara,
fine. If we play Portland, it's an unknown
team [this yearl but we played them last
year, so we basically know the way they
play. Our kids have been really good this
year being able to adjust on the fly."
In Saturday's second game, West
Coast Conference rivals Santa
Clara and Portland face off for a
rematch of a very close game ear
lier this year. Although the Bron
cos won 3-1 in overtime, the
Pilots have played consistent soc
cer all season and should give
Santa Clara plenty of problems.
The Bronco offense, led by
freshmen forwards Mikka
Hansen and Erin Martinez, is

triggered by sophomore midfield
er Jennifer Lalor, who has assist
ed on a remarkable 15 goals this
year.
Foremost among areas of con
cern for the Broncos should be the
need to shut down sophomore
Shannon MacMillan, the nation's
top scorer. Recording 22 goals and
12 assists this year, MacMillan's
scoring ability looms large on the
minds of Santa Clara coaches,
who have seen their team victim
ized by top goal-scoring threats
like Rafanelli. The Stanford pow
erhouse scored two goals in less

than two minutes against the
Broncos in Stanford's 2-0 win at
Santa Clara on Nov. 4.
With its 15-3-1 record, Port
land has quietly put together an
exceptional season. Removing the
Santa Clara overtime loss and
another overtime setback, a 4-1
loss to Colorado College, the
Pilots have a virtually unblem
ished record, with their only other
loss inflicted by top-ranked North
Carolina by a narrow 2-0 margin.
