Stanford's cross-country season has come down
to one race, the District-8 Championships, to be held
at Portland University tomorrow. Both Cardinal
teams must shine in a field consisting of every Pacif
ic 10 Conference school as well as all other Division
I California, Oregon, Washington and Nevada
teams, or else Saturday's meet in Oregon will be its
last of the year.
The country is divided into eight districts, all of
which will conduct their championships tomorrow.
Regardless of team records, all Division I squads will
compete, but only the top two teams in each district
will automatically advance to the NCAA Champi
onships on Nov. 22. However, on Monday, six third
place schools will also be named as at-large squads
on the basis of their full-season performance.
"You've got to produce on the day," said head
coach Vin Lananna. "It's an unforgiving system.
Everything you've done prior to this means almost
nothing." i
Pressure won't be the only obstacle confronting
the No. 6 Stanford women and the No. 23 Cardinal
men. On the men's side, sixth-ranked Portland
heads a list of formidable opponents, which includes
Pac-10 champion Washington, No. 15 Washington
State and No. 16 Oregon. Meanwhile, the Stanford
women will run against the likes of No. 10 Arizona,
No. 14 UCLA and the No. 16 Ducks.
However, Lananna has his teams focused only on
their own strengths and weaknesses, an approach
that has secured success for the Cardinal all year.
"We have to group together in the first half of the
race and move up," said All-American senior captain
Gary Stolz. "This'll be different from Pac-10's. The
course is much flatter, and there's an additional
2,000 meters, which gives us more time to move up."
Lananna is also confident, despite the men's
squad's youth.
"With a young men's team, it's difficult to per
form at will. That's an ability which comes with age
and maturity," Lananna said. "But our success has
come with tenacity, hard work and Gaiy Stolz's
leadership. I don't think we can beat Portland, but if
we can maintain composure and execute what we've
done all season, we can come in anywhere from fifth
to second."
Lananna also believes that a "business as usual"
approach will give the women a very good shot at
qualifying for NCAAs. For the women, "business as
usual" simply means running as a tight pack. The
Cardinal women won the Pac-10 title two weeks ago
using this strategy. While other Pac-10 schools such
as then-No. 6 Oregon had one or two of their top
runners place high in the conference meet, their
remaining runners finished well behind, dragging
team standings down with them. Stanford's top five
women finished within 12 seconds of one another,
placing from eighth to 14th.
Cardinal runners have also ignore their personal
concerns to fulfill their season-long quest to get to
the NCAA competition.
"Every race this year has gotten more and more
exciting for me," said senior captain Sarah Truitt.
"The team's doing well and I'm improving. There's
only incentive to run well. Louise [Watson, the
defending District-8 champion] and I have talked so
much about the team that we haven't even talked
about ourselves and about the fact that this could be
our last race."
