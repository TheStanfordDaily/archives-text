# He's no hot dog
## Armour keeps his success in perspective 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Justin Armour never intended to be a great college
receiver. He never even intended to play that position.
In fact, he never really intended to play college foot
ball.
"I'd been planning on playing college basketball
since I was in seventh grade," said Armour. "Football
was just kind of something else I did. Basketball was
always my first love."
Playing in statewide tournaments since the age of
12, Armour found early success. By the time he grad
uated from high school, he had made First-Team All-
State twice, and was named Colorado state Player of
the Year after his senior season.
But Armour had a problem. After three years of
playing quarterback for Manitou Springs High
School, he had amassed 8,119 yards and 124 touch
downs. In his 13-game senior season alone he threw
for 2,103 yards and 27 touchdowns, ran for 1,320
yards and found the endzone 25 more times, returned
a kickoff for a score, kicked 37 extra points and inter
cepted 8 passes while playing safety. Small wonder
colleges began to look at the consensus All-Amencan
more for for his football prowess than for his abilities
on the basketball court.
However, Stanford recruited Armour and offered
him the chance to play for both football coach Denny
Green and basketball coach Mike Montgomery.
"The opportunity came to come here and play both
(sports)," Armour said. "The NCAA rules work it out
where you have to sign a football scholarship, so
that's why in fact I did that. Since I've come here,
obviously things have changed."
"But I still totally like basketball."
During his freshman year at Stanford, Armour
encountered another change of plans. Although he
was a top recruit as a quarterback, a young quarter
back named Steve Stenstrom showed promise as the
heir apparent to the signal-caller position, and the
coaching staff re-evaluated Armour.
Before the season began, Armour was converted to
wide receiver. He saw limited playing time, mostly in
blocking situations, and never caught a pass. A foot
injury limited his contributions, and kept him from
playing basketball that year as well.
However, Armour became the starting flanker his
sophomore year and showed he could do more than
just block. He caught 36 passes that season, and led
the team with seven touchdown receptions and a

17.4-yard average per catch His 52.2 receiving yards
per game was seventh in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Armour also suited up for basketball last year, and
saw a limited amount of playing time for the Stanford
basektball team. But his mark had already been
made; Justin Armour had become known as a bud
ding receiving star.
Nevertheless, few expected the numbers that
Armour has put up this year Through the first seven

games of the season, Armour had averaged seven
catches and 96.8 yards a game, the former statistic
ranking him fourth in the nation, the latter, 11th. If
he had been able to continue that pace, Armour
would have vied for school records in both categories.
The tremendous success came as little surprise to
Armour, though.

healthy, Armour has been Stanford's most prolific receiver, averaging seven catches per game.
"I guess I've always known that
I'm in the right place to do I well],"
Armour said "I spent a lot of time in
the off-season getting ready. I was
really excited about the season, and I
felt like I was starting to get really
comfortable with knowing what I
was doing."

However, the biggest surprise
arrived at the middle of this season.
Against Arizona, after catching a

customarily long pass, Armour was
tackled roughly and he seperated his
shoulder, taking him out for two
games.
"It's been frustrating since I've
been hurt," Armour said. "I went
from really looking forward to each
week and now I'm just trying to
wake up in the morning and turn off
my alarm clock without pain."
There could be another slightly
unexpected twist in Armour's foot
ball future. Last year coaches talked
of moving the 6-6, 215-pounder to
tight end. The move was waylaid by
the development of current Cardinal

tight end Tony Cline, but there are
those who insist that Armour must
make the change if he is to play at
the next level.
But Armour claims that he's fine
right where he is.
"The only reason I play football is
because I like it," Armour said. "I'm
having fun, and to be real honest,
I'm not sure I'd be having fun as a
tight end. Eveiyone always tells me,
Tou can never play pro if you don't
play tight end because you're too
slow, or too big or just not good
enough. You can make millions and
millions of dollars in the pros.' What,

and be miserable, and go week to
week depending on the ibuprofin?
"If I get the opportunity to go to
the next level, you can bet I'll be
grateful, and you can bet I'll go for it.
But if I don't go, that just means the
Lord's got bigger and better plans
for me."
Despite his tremendous success
es, and promising future, the story
of Armour's exploits on the football
field do not do enough in painting a
picture of the junior public policy
major. Football is a big part of his
life, but Armour insists that there is
more to his time here at Stanford.

"I don't want to act like football
isn't a big deal, because it is a big
deal," Armour said "It's given me an
opportunity to go to school here,
because without it I just wouldn't be
able to fit the bill. And I love the
game, I love the guys and I love play
ing on Saturdays.
"But I think probably the rela
tionships with people I've gained
here have been the biggest asset to
me for the future. They've taught
me a lot about ways I needed to
change, ways maybe I needed to look
at things differently, and ways that I
could just be strengthened. I never

would have thought that would
mean so much — not because I'm a
big macho tough guy, but just
because I've never experienced
something like that until now.
"I feel pretty lucky."
Everybody in the world is blessed
with different gifts, and sometimes
we are given abilities and opportuni
ties that we didn't expect. Some
times the things that are of the
greatest value are the things we
didn't see coming, the things we just
happen upon.

grateful, and you can bet I'll go for it.
But if I don't go, that just means the
Lord's got bigger and better plans
for me."
Despite his tremendous success
es, and promising future, the story
of Armour's exploits on the football
field do not do enough in painting a
picture of the junior public policy
major. Football is a big part of his
life, but Armour insists that there is
more to his time here at Stanford.

"I don't want to act like football
isn't a big deal, because it is a big
deal," Armour said "It's given me an
opportunity to go to school here,
because without it I just wouldn't be
able to fit the bill. And I love the
game, I love the guys and I love play
ing on Saturdays.
"But I think probably the rela
tionships with people I've gained
here have been the biggest asset to
me for the future. They've taught
me a lot about ways I needed to
change, ways maybe I needed to look
at things differently, and ways that I
could just be strengthened. I never

would have thought that would
mean so much — not because I'm a
big macho tough guy, but just
because I've never experienced
something like that until now.
"I feel pretty lucky."
Everybody in the world is blessed
with different gifts, and sometimes
we are given abilities and opportuni
ties that we didn't expect. Some
times the things that are of the
greatest value are the things we
didn't see coming, the things we just
happen upon.
What makes Justin Armour so
special is that he understands that.
Justin Armour never intended to be a great college
receiver. He never even intended to play that position.
In fact, he never really intended to play college foot
ball.
"I'd been planning on playing college basketball
since I was in seventh grade," said Armour. "Football
was just kind of something else I did. Basketball was
always my first love."
Playing in statewide tournaments since the age of
12, Armour found early success. By the time he grad
uated from high school, he had made First-Team All-
State twice, and was named Colorado state Player of
the Year after his senior season.
But Armour had a problem. After three years of
playing quarterback for Manitou Springs High
School, he had amassed 8,119 yards and 124 touch
downs. In his 13-game senior season alone he threw
for 2,103 yards and 27 touchdowns, ran for 1,320
yards and found the endzone 25 more times, returned
a kickoff for a score, kicked 37 extra points and inter
cepted 8 passes while playing safety. Small wonder
colleges began to look at the consensus All-Amencan
more for for his football prowess than for his abilities
on the basketball court.
However, Stanford recruited Armour and offered
him the chance to play for both football coach Denny
Green and basketball coach Mike Montgomery.
"The opportunity came to come here and play both
(sports)," Armour said. "The NCAA rules work it out
where you have to sign a football scholarship, so
that's why in fact I did that. Since I've come here,
obviously things have changed."
"But I still totally like basketball."
During his freshman year at Stanford, Armour
encountered another change of plans. Although he
was a top recruit as a quarterback, a young quarter
back named Steve Stenstrom showed promise as the
heir apparent to the signal-caller position, and the
coaching staff re-evaluated Armour.
Before the season began, Armour was converted to
wide receiver. He saw limited playing time, mostly in
blocking situations, and never caught a pass. A foot
injury limited his contributions, and kept him from
playing basketball that year as well.
However, Armour became the starting flanker his
sophomore year and showed he could do more than
just block. He caught 36 passes that season, and led
the team with seven touchdown receptions and a

17.4-yard average per catch His 52.2 receiving yards
per game was seventh in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Armour also suited up for basketball last year, and
saw a limited amount of playing time for the Stanford
basektball team. But his mark had already been
made; Justin Armour had become known as a bud
ding receiving star.
Nevertheless, few expected the numbers that
Armour has put up this year Through the first seven

games of the season, Armour had averaged seven
catches and 96.8 yards a game, the former statistic
ranking him fourth in the nation, the latter, 11th. If
he had been able to continue that pace, Armour
would have vied for school records in both categories.
The tremendous success came as little surprise to
Armour, though.

healthy, Armour has been Stanford's most prolific receiver, averaging seven catches per game.
"I guess I've always known that
I'm in the right place to do I well],"
Armour said "I spent a lot of time in
the off-season getting ready. I was
really excited about the season, and I
felt like I was starting to get really
comfortable with knowing what I
was doing."

However, the biggest surprise
arrived at the middle of this season.
Against Arizona, after catching a

customarily long pass, Armour was
tackled roughly and he seperated his
shoulder, taking him out for two
games.
"It's been frustrating since I've
been hurt," Armour said. "I went
from really looking forward to each
week and now I'm just trying to
wake up in the morning and turn off
my alarm clock without pain."
There could be another slightly
unexpected twist in Armour's foot
ball future. Last year coaches talked
of moving the 6-6, 215-pounder to
tight end. The move was waylaid by
the development of current Cardinal

tight end Tony Cline, but there are
those who insist that Armour must
make the change if he is to play at
the next level.
But Armour claims that he's fine
right where he is.
"The only reason I play football is
because I like it," Armour said. "I'm
having fun, and to be real honest,
I'm not sure I'd be having fun as a
tight end. Eveiyone always tells me,
Tou can never play pro if you don't
play tight end because you're too
slow, or too big or just not good
enough. You can make millions and
millions of dollars in the pros.' What,

and be miserable, and go week to
week depending on the ibuprofin?
"If I get the opportunity to go to
the next level, you can bet I'll be
grateful, and you can bet I'll go for it.

for me."
