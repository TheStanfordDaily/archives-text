# He's no hot dog
## Armour keeps his success in perspective 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Justin Armour never intended to be a great college
receiver. He never even intended to play that position.
In fact, he never really intended to play college foot
ball.
"I'd been planning on playing college basketball
since I was in seventh grade," said Armour. "Football
was just kind of something else I did. Basketball was
always my first love."
Playing in statewide tournaments since the age of
12, Armour found early success. By the time he grad
uated from high school, he had made First-Team All-
State twice, and was named Colorado state Player of
the Year after his senior season.
But Armour had a problem. After three years of
playing quarterback for Manitou Springs High
School, he had amassed 8,119 yards and 124 touch
downs. In his 13-game senior season alone he threw
for 2,103 yards and 27 touchdowns, ran for 1,320
yards and found the endzone 25 more times, returned
a kickoff for a score, kicked 37 extra points and inter
cepted 8 passes while playing safety. Small wonder
colleges began to look at the consensus All-Amencan
more for for his football prowess than for his abilities
on the basketball court.
However, Stanford recruited Armour and offered
him the chance to play for both football coach Denny
Green and basketball coach Mike Montgomery.
"The opportunity came to come here and play both
(sports)," Armour said. "The NCAA rules work it out
where you have to sign a football scholarship, so
that's why in fact I did that. Since I've come here,
obviously things have changed."
"But I still totally like basketball."
During his freshman year at Stanford, Armour
encountered another change of plans. Although he
was a top recruit as a quarterback, a young quarter
back named Steve Stenstrom showed promise as the
heir apparent to the signal-caller position, and the
coaching staff re-evaluated Armour.
Before the season began, Armour was converted to
wide receiver. He saw limited playing time, mostly in
blocking situations, and never caught a pass. A foot
injury limited his contributions, and kept him from
playing basketball that year as well.
However, Armour became the starting flanker his
sophomore year and showed he could do more than
just block. He caught 36 passes that season, and led
the team with seven touchdown receptions and a

17.4-yard average per catch His 52.2 receiving yards
per game was seventh in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Armour also suited up for basketball last year, and
saw a limited amount of playing time for the Stanford
basektball team. But his mark had already been
made; Justin Armour had become known as a bud
ding receiving star.
Nevertheless, few expected the numbers that
Armour has put up this year Through the first seven

games of the season, Armour had averaged seven
catches and 96.8 yards a game, the former statistic
ranking him fourth in the nation, the latter, 11th. If
he had been able to continue that pace, Armour
would have vied for school records in both categories.
The tremendous success came as little surprise to
Armour, though.
