With only four more Pacific 10 Con
ference matches to go, many teams
would be concentrating on fine-tuning
their game and focusing on making
minor adjustments. The Stanford
women's volleyball team, however, is
taking quite a different approach.
Instead of zeroing in on one area, the
No. 6 Cardinal (17-5, 10-4 in the Pac-10)

While those losses did not have a pos

did serve as a reality check for a Cardinal
team which has become more aware of
its strengths â€” and weaknesses.
"We were not necessarily beaten by
superior teams; we had a big hand in our
