With only four more Pacific 10 Con
ference matches to go, many teams
would be concentrating on fine-tuning
their game and focusing on making
minor adjustments. The Stanford
women's volleyball team, however, is
taking quite a different approach.
Instead of zeroing in on one area, the
No. 6 Cardinal (17-5, 10-4 in the Pac-10)
spent the last week and a half concen
trating on the basics. The team hopes

the extra practice will strengthen all
aspects of its game as it faces Oregon
tonight (4-19, 1-14 in the Pac-10) fol
lowed by No. 23 Oregon State (15-10, 7-
8 in the Pac-10) on Saturday to complete
its last regular-season road trip.
"We've been concentrating on funda
mentals, having all players execute all
skills instead of specializing," said senior
tri-captain Piper Hahn. "Better ball con
trol is going to help us in any situation."
Ball control has not been a problem
for Stanford in its last three matches.
The Cardinal swept California last Tues

day after delivering the same punish
ment to both Washington and No. 21
Washington State the previous week
end.
These victories redeemed the Stan
ford squad after embarrassing losses to
Arizona and Arizona State. These
defeats convinced coach Don Shaw to
start a new combination of players in
hopes of turning the tide for the Cardi
nal.
"We've definitely played better in the
past three matches," said coach Don
Shaw. "The lineup change had some

thing to do with it; we needed to do
something a little different afler our two
losses in Arizona."
While those losses did not have a pos
itive effect on the squad's record, they
did serve as a reality check for a Cardinal
team which has become more aware of
its strengths — and weaknesses.
"We were not necessarily beaten by
superior teams; we had a big hand in our
downfall," Shaw said. "We were playing
to prevent mistakes rather than playing
to win. Now we just have to go out
there and let it fly."
Sitting in second place in the Pac
-10, Stanford will soon meet UCLA
While Stanford's main focus this
weekend will be on the Oregon
teams, thoughts of its second meet
ing with the No. 1 Bruins will linger
close to the surface.
"It's hard when we know our
biggest rival is coming up the fol
lowing weekend," Hahn said.
"UCLA is always in the back of our
heads."
At the opposite end of the Pac
-10, last-place Oregon will look to
redeem itself against the Cardinal
after a 14-16, 12-15, 10-15 loss in
Maples Pavilion earlier in the sea
son. Stanford also downed Oregon
State in four games the last time

the teams met, 15-11, 17-15,16-14,
15-4. After dropping six of its last
nine matches, Oregon State des
perately needs a victory this week
end in order to enter postseason
play.
The Cardinal drive has proven
steady in the past few weeks with
sophomores Marnie Triefenbach
and Cary Wendell at the helm.
Triefenbach's dangerous left-side
smash has produced a team-high
295 kills for a .256 hitting percent
age on the season while Wendell is
hitting .263 with 292 kills and a
team-high 261 digs.
The squad remains optimistic
about the team's improvement as
well as its prospects for the postsea
son.
"We've had a couple of good prac
tices," Hahn said. "As the Pac-10 is
winding down, we've been working
really hard and getting geared up.
Hopefully we'll climax at the right
time."
