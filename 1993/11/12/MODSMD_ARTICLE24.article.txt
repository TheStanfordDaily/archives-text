Nine water polo teams will compete in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation Tournament this weekend at
Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach, Calif. All nine
squads are ranked in the nation's top 10, including the
No. 1 through No. 8 teams. Top-ranked Stanford (20-
3) heads the field as the country's premier collegiate
competition gets underway.
"This tournament is tougher than NCAAs," said
coach Dante Dettamanti. "This tournament has the
top nine teams in it, while the NCAAs only have the top
five. We are in by far the strongest conference in the
nation."
The MPSF has proved its strength every year at the
NCAA Championships, producing every titlist since
the tournament began in 1969.
"We've played well at this tournament in the past,"
Dettamanti said. "Last vear we lost to Cal in overtime
in the finals. We'd like to win our conference, (but) our
primary goal is to win NCAAs. This is a good dress
rehersal for NCAAs."
The top-seeded Cardinal received a first-round bye
and will open the tourney with a matchup against
either No. 5 UC-Irvine or No. 6 UCLA. Their second
match will most likely be against the defending MPSF
champion, No. 4 Cal. Stanford will wrap up on Sunday
with a probable matchup against either No. 2 USC or
No. 3 Pacific.
"This is a big weekend," said sophomore Jeremy

Laster, the team's leading scorer. "We'll probably play
Cal for sure and we lost to them last time. It would be
good to beat them going into the Big Splash and
NCAAs We've had a good week of practice. If we play
defense and control the counterattack both offensively
and defensively, if should be a good weekend."
Senior Larry Bercutt agreed that the key to Stan
ford's success lies in its defensive performance.
"If we play good defense, we're definitely going to
win," said Bercutt, who gained first-team all tourna
ment honors last year. "We've worked mostly on com
munication and playing as a team. We've been playing
too much one-on-one, we need to play as a team."
Both Dettamanti and Bercutt stress that the impor
tance of this weekend's play is keeping the No. 1 rank
ing heading into the final two weeks of the season
"We've proved that we are the No. 1 team," Detta
manti said. "The problem is we have to keep proving it.
That's what these next two weekends are all about."
"We just want to keep our ranking," Bercutt added.
"It would be hard to lose our ranking but we don't
want anyone to think we're not the No. 1 team. We
don't want to put it in the voters' hands It's in our
hands. This weekend is big for a lot of the teams
because it's their last chance to make the NCAAs.
Everyone will be gunning to upset us."
With three games against top five teams this week
end and a weekend homestand against UOP and Cal
next weekend, Dettamanti is happy to have his team
relatively healthy and training well.
"The key thing is that we are
peaking at the right time," he said.
"We're playing very well and we
want to keep it up. The guys have to
keep aware of our goals and every
weekend is important towards
that."
Three games. Top-ranked teams.
