# Eiser vs. Erickson: Trying to bankrupt Stanford's bursar
## 
### 
There I was, returning to Stan
ford from my weekend at home.
Then, somewhere over the Atlantic
Ocean between Espana and His
pariola, the flight attendant on my
Olympus Airways charter awak
ened me from my traditional Greek
siesta, er, catnap.
"How are you going to get back
to .500 with your football picks?"
she asked, referring to my 24-27
mark after a 3-4 week in which
James Montoya and the undergrad
uate admissions staff closed the gap
between myself and my guests.
They posted a 4-3 mark that raised
my opponents' tally to 22-29.
"Good question," I replied. "I'll
have to consult my muses on that
one."
After much thought, and a cou
ple of Daily headlines about $20
million budget cuts, I came up with
two strategies: 1) to trim the
"fatty," hard-to-predict games from
my weekly slate, and 2) to get a
guest who would be distracted by
the sound of Stanford's administra
tive chainsaw.
So 1 called the office of Provost

Condoleezza Rice. Not finding any
luck there, I dialed up Bursar Jon
Erickson, my good friend and Axe
Committee adviser. Yes, the perfect
victim — the man responsible for
the tuition bills that just can't seem
to cover University costs these
days.
Erickson agreed to be my guest,
and felt that Rice would defeat the
budget crisis by eight points using
the home-field advantage. Why,
then, did she pull the old "baklava"
on me? While I ponder, here come
the picks, with lines from Wednes
day's Chronicle and home teams in
CAPS:

OREGON —6 vs. Stanford
Andy: Stanford +6. Don't tell Bill
Walsh, but I know this pre-Big
Game contest means more to the
Ducks than it does to our Cardinal;
after all, how can anyone look for
ward to Oregon State? Still, we
could use a victory to get us back on
our feet before next week's Axe
defense, and if anyone can keep
Stanford focused, it's Walsh.
Bursar: Stanford -1-6. "Rubber

duckies in a bathtub? You've got to
be kidding!" Erickson said. I'm not,
Jon, but I still wonder where you
got the "bathtub" from.

WASHINGTON - 2 vs. Use
Andy: USC +2. The Trojans need a
win to keep their outside shot at the
Rose Bowl alive. The Huskies have
been erratic and could have their
sights set on next week's revenge
opportunity against archrival
Washington State. Translation: so
help me John Robinson, the Tro
jans will hold.
Bursar: Washington —2. Entering
the realm of the superficial, Erick
son cited the comparative appear
ances of Washington Athletic Direc

tor Barbara Hedges and Trojan
A.D. Mike Garrett as reasons for
his selection. "When have you seen
Mike Garrett in a skirt?" Erickson

asked.
UCLA —11 vs. Arizona State
Andy: UCLA -11. OK, OK, I'm a
believer. The Bruins hold their
Rose Bowl destiny in their hands,
and the Sun Devils simply cannot
pry it loose. Some things are better
left for the Trojans, I guess.
Bursar: UCLA —11. "They're on
their way," Erickson said of the
Bruins. You're right, Jon, they are
on their way ... to being upset by
USC next week.

Florida State —7 vs. NOTRE
DAME
Andy: Florida State —7. The Semi
noles are the most solid college foot
ball team to come along in a while,
and should remove all doubts about
that by ambushing a Fighting Irish
squad that has too many holes in its
passing and defense to win this
year's "Game of the Century."
Bursar: Notre Dame +7. Erickson,
obviously still laughing at the
thought of He is man Trophy win
ners in skirts, picked the Irish
based on the Holtz factor. Well,
Jon, Bobby Bowden's not so bad
himself, and how does the thought
of Charlie Ward in a "mini" strike
you?
GEORGIA — 1 vs. Auburn
Andy: Auburn +1. Still undefeated
and still looking to keep the Bow
den name unblemished, Tigers
coach Terry will tame the Bulldogs
and conquer Athens. Couldn't they
play in Rome instead?
Bursar: Auburn +1. The Bursar
mumbled something about "proba
tion paying." I thought it best not to

ask for a clarification, though, lest I
get stuck with the bill.
DENVER —7 vs. Minnesota
Andy: Denver —7. Once again, two
Cardinal alumni are better than
one. Last week, I called the Bron
cos' John and Glyn over Touch
down Tommy; this week, Dave Gar
nett and Denny Green's other
Vikingß charges will be dropped
from Mile Heights.
Bursar: Minnesota +7. "Elway's
wheels are too old to run the Bron
cos' machine," Erickson said.
Hmmmm.
PITTSBURGH -3 vs. Buffalo
Andy: Buffalo +3. The Bills are
pulling their annual dominance
trip, one that they could carry
through the American Football
Conference championship game
(and only through that game)
again. The Steelers should be easy
Monday prey.
Bursar: Pittsburgh —3. "Rumbles
of the days of old," Erickson said.
Well, you would be the one to
remember, Jon.

obviously still laughing at the
thought of He is man Trophy win
ners in skirts, picked the Irish
based on the Holtz factor. Well,
Jon, Bobby Bowden's not so bad
himself, and how does the thought
of Charlie Ward in a "mini" strike
you?
GEORGIA — 1 vs. Auburn
Andy: Auburn +1. Still undefeated
and still looking to keep the Bow
den name unblemished, Tigers
coach Terry will tame the Bulldogs
and conquer Athens. Couldn't they
play in Rome instead?
Bursar: Auburn +1. The Bursar
mumbled something about "proba
tion paying." I thought it best not to

ask for a clarification, though, lest I
get stuck with the bill.
DENVER —7 vs. Minnesota
Andy: Denver —7. Once again, two
Cardinal alumni are better than
one. Last week, I called the Bron
cos' John and Glyn over Touch
down Tommy; this week, Dave Gar
nett and Denny Green's other
Vikingß charges will be dropped
from Mile Heights.
Bursar: Minnesota +7. "Elway's
wheels are too old to run the Bron
cos' machine," Erickson said.
Hmmmm.
PITTSBURGH -3 vs. Buffalo
Andy: Buffalo +3. The Bills are
pulling their annual dominance
trip, one that they could carry
through the American Football
Conference championship game
(and only through that game)
again. The Steelers should be easy
Monday prey.
Bursar: Pittsburgh —3. "Rumbles
of the days of old," Erickson said.
Well, you would be the one to
remember, Jon.

There I was, returning to Stan
ford from my weekend at home.
Then, somewhere over the Atlantic
Ocean between Espana and His
pariola, the flight attendant on my
Olympus Airways charter awak
ened me from my traditional Greek
siesta, er, catnap.
"How are you going to get back
to .500 with your football picks?"
she asked, referring to my 24-27
mark after a 3-4 week in which
James Montoya and the undergrad
uate admissions staff closed the gap
between myself and my guests.
They posted a 4-3 mark that raised
my opponents' tally to 22-29.
"Good question," I replied. "I'll
have to consult my muses on that
one."
After much thought, and a cou
ple of Daily headlines about $20
million budget cuts, I came up with
two strategies: 1) to trim the
"fatty," hard-to-predict games from
my weekly slate, and 2) to get a
guest who would be distracted by
the sound of Stanford's administra
tive chainsaw.
So 1 called the office of Provost

Condoleezza Rice. Not finding any
luck there, I dialed up Bursar Jon
Erickson, my good friend and Axe
Committee adviser. Yes, the perfect
victim — the man responsible for
the tuition bills that just can't seem
to cover University costs these
days.
Erickson agreed to be my guest,
and felt that Rice would defeat the
budget crisis by eight points using
the home-field advantage. Why,
then, did she pull the old "baklava"
on me? While I ponder, here come
the picks, with lines from Wednes
day's Chronicle and home teams in
CAPS:

OREGON —6 vs. Stanford
Andy: Stanford +6. Don't tell Bill
Walsh, but I know this pre-Big
Game contest means more to the
Ducks than it does to our Cardinal;
after all, how can anyone look for
ward to Oregon State? Still, we
could use a victory to get us back on
our feet before next week's Axe
defense, and if anyone can keep
Stanford focused, it's Walsh.
Bursar: Stanford -1-6. "Rubber

duckies in a bathtub? You've got to
be kidding!" Erickson said. I'm not,
Jon, but I still wonder where you
got the "bathtub" from.

WASHINGTON - 2 vs. Use
Andy: USC +2. The Trojans need a
win to keep their outside shot at the
Rose Bowl alive. The Huskies have
been erratic and could have their
sights set on next week's revenge
opportunity against archrival
Washington State. Translation: so
help me John Robinson, the Tro
jans will hold.
Bursar: Washington —2. Entering
the realm of the superficial, Erick
son cited the comparative appear
ances of Washington Athletic Direc

tor Barbara Hedges and Trojan
A.D. Mike Garrett as reasons for
his selection. "When have you seen
Mike Garrett in a skirt?" Erickson

asked.
UCLA —11 vs. Arizona State
Andy: UCLA -11. OK, OK, I'm a
believer. The Bruins hold their
Rose Bowl destiny in their hands,
and the Sun Devils simply cannot
pry it loose. Some things are better
left for the Trojans, I guess.
Bursar: UCLA —11. "They're on
their way," Erickson said of the
Bruins. You're right, Jon, they are
on their way ... to being upset by
USC next week.

Florida State —7 vs. NOTRE
DAME
Andy: Florida State —7. The Semi
noles are the most solid college foot
ball team to come along in a while,
and should remove all doubts about
that by ambushing a Fighting Irish
squad that has too many holes in its
passing and defense to win this
year's "Game of the Century."
Bursar: Notre Dame +7. Erickson,
obviously still laughing at the
thought of He is man Trophy win
ners in skirts, picked the Irish
based on the Holtz factor. Well,
