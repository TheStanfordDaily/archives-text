# Crew rows for glory at Newport Regatta
## 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
Oarsmen from all over California are going
to be at the Newport Regatta this weekend, but
Stanford will have its eyes on only one creature:
a small, furry bear.
The race, slated for Sunday morning in New
port Beach, Calif., should bring the California
Golden Bears and the Cardinal shoulder to
shoulder at the finish line.
As the fall crew season approaches its cli
mactic meet — the Stanford Regatta, to be held
in San Mateo Nov. 21 — a keen rivalry is
mounting among last year's top three Pacific 10
Conference schools: the University of Washing
ton, Stanford and Cal.
"All three (schools) have a chance at the Pac
-10 championship, and the differences among
them is minimal," said Cardinal men's head
coach Wieslaw Kujda.
Though most major California universities

will be at Newport, Kujda believes only Cal will
provide competition for Stanford's first boat,
which consists of eight varsity members.
Furthermore, the Cardinal's second boat is
expected to rival the varsity teams of all other
schools.
The women's crew team, which will race for
the first time this season, faces unknown
prospects against the other teams.
"I think we'll do a decent job. It'll be good
measure of our [abilities] since our new coach,
Jocelyn McCandless, started training us," said
sophomore Bianca Perla, a member of the Stan
ford first boat.
Last weekend's Portland Loop race gave the
entire men's team a taste of the upcoming com
petition. In the head race, a style of competing
in which each boat starts in 15-second intervals,
the Cardinal varsity boat started in last place
and was unable to catch Washington.
Stanford managed to ride the waves and
catch Washington State, which was placed one

slot ahead of the Cardinal, within the first 500
meters of the 4.5-mile race. The next team
ahead, Oregon State, fell victim to the Cardinal
onslaught soon afterwards.
But as Stanford prepared to overtake the
Bears, a referee's boat mistakenly passed over
the race course, causing waves that slowed the
Cardinal significantly and prevented them from
moving past Cal.
Nonetheless, the Stanford time of 21 min
utes and 29 seconds surpassed that of the
Bears' by a close three seconds.
The Huskies' varsity squad clocked in 10 sec
onds faster than the Cardinal.
The University of Victoria, whose speed
rivals that of top-ranked Harvard, took first
place with a time of 20 minutes and 49 seconds.
Stanford's second boat, which only competed
with Washington and Victoria, ended up in the
same third spot in which they started the race.
"We could have given them a good fight if we
were up front," Kujda said.
