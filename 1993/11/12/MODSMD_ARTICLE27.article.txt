among Southwest Bay Area

Fifth-year coach Farnck

the season's prospects, "We
will be very strong. But the
season will be very long and
we must tackle like idiots all
year to win."
Women's Rugby:
The Stanford women's
rugby team won their first
rugby game, yesterday, in the
Sacramento Tournament.
Their 12-0 defeat of an Ore
gon team was a learning expe
rience for the young squad, as
the match was their first game
of the year. In fact, 80 percent
of the team had never before
competed in a rugby game.
