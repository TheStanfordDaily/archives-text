# Swimming tries to rustle Longhorns tomorrow
## 
### Rob Ross Editorial staff 
The defending NCAA champion men's
swim team kicks off its home dual meet sea
son tomorrow against perennial powerhouse
Texas. The event will begin at noon at
deGuerre Pool.
There is no love lost between these two
dominating squads. The Cardinal is the two
time defending NCAA champion, but the
Longhorn squad won the four previous
titles. Expect to see these two teams in the
thick of things again come NCAA Champi
onships in March.
"Texas continues to recruit and put forth
quality athletes that remain a threat to the
reign of Stanford swiming," said sophomore
Scott Gagner.
"I love this meet because it gives us a
chance to race fast early in the season and

measure up and swim tough against our
biggest rival," junior Ray Carey added.
The Cardinal returns a slate of quality
swimmers from last year's squad. Carey and
seniors Derek Weatherford and Tyler May
field all won NCAA individual titles last
March in the 100-yard backstroke, the 100-
yard breaststroke and the 200-yard butter
fly, respectively. Additionally, redshirt
junior Brian Retterer, senior J.J. Freitag,
senior Bill Schell, junior Dan Kanner, junior
Kurt Groate, sophomore Joe Hudepohl and
senior Trip Zedlitz all rank in the top 25 in
the country in their respective strokes.
Texas has no shortage of world-class
swimmers either. They are led by senior
Josh Davis, who won the NCAA 200-yard
freestyle individual championship last
spring. Other top returnees include back
stroker Brad Bridgewater and breaststroker
Jeff Cummings, both NCAA finalists. As a

team, the Longhorns placed third at the
1993 NCAAs.
The most exciting event on tomorrow's
slate may be the 200-freestyle, which pits
Davis against 1992 Olympian Hudepohl. At
last year's NCAAs Davis touched out Hude
pohl at the wall, winning the championship
by .11 seconds.
"Due to him beating me last year, it gets
me psyched up for tomorrow's race," Hude
pohl said.
Cardinal head coach Skip Kenney, who
coached the Pan Pacific U.S. Men's Team
this summer, decided not to rest his squad at
all for tomorrows showdown. Thus it is a
worn-down and tired Stanford team that will
take the blocks tomorrow.
"The focus of our season is NCAAs in
March. Dual meets are a stepping stone to
this championship," said breastroker
Groate. "Physically, this is a detriment, but

not resting sets us up for a big psychological
boost if we can beat them while tired."
Tomorrow's meet will mark the first time
Retterer has swum competitvely in
deGuerre pool for almost a year. This tal
ented back and breaststroker dislocated his
shoulder last November and was forced to
sit out the year. After extensive rehabilita
tion Retterer was able to compete in the Pan
Pac Games this summer and looks forward
to donning the Cardinal and white tomor
row.
"It will be a really exciting experience to
be able to stand up on the blocks again to
represent Stanford University," he said.
The Cardinal's season began last week
with a win at the University of the Pacific
Invitational. First-place finishers at the meet
included junior Clay Tippins, Retterer,
Hudepohl, Mayfield, Weatherford and
Carey.
