## The 						Daily columnist style guide Andy Dworkin It's the cool thing to do (really) 
### 
u You work for The Daily? Do you know Joel
Stein?"
So you want to be a Daily columnist. Next to
sex, a columnist position at The Daily is
the most widely wanted and least widely
attained thing on campus.
And like sex, the writing of Daily columns
suffers from two main problems:
1) Doing it in public only entertains the doer,
not the audience.
2) You're not as good as you think you are.
That's where I come in. Maybe I've taken one
to many drags at the withered tit of human
kindness, or maybe I'm tired of reading crappy
sample columns. Maybe I just wanted the $20
(yeah, that's right, two-zero) I'll get for writing
this. At any rate, for those of you desperate to
get in on the action, desperate to get the fame,
money, respect — desperate to be a player —
here's the difinitive style guide on How to Write
a Stanford Daily Column.
• Use big words Everyone at Stanford burned
up their SAT-Verbal, so to make your prose
stand out you need to use big words and use 'em
indiscriminately.
Take this sorry sentence: "He had a
headache."
Yawn. Sure, it's got a little alliteration, and it
gets the point across succinctly, but it's missing
that style, that zip, that certain pinot noir.
Now pull out a dictionary and try this on for
size: "His head exploded in a priapism of pain."
Sure, It's a little longer and harder for the
average guy to understand, but it makes you
stand up and take notice, and that's what
counts.
•Be self-conscious Hey, it's a post-modern
world. Everybody wants to hear about you, and
better yet, wants to hear what you think about
you and read what you write about what you
think about you. As Tish would say:
Stop and smell the cafe latte.
But don't take my word for it, take a page
from Joel Stein's dime-store book. He's the last,
best columnist we had here at The Daily, and
just look at this excerpt from one of his
columns:
I'm great. I'm just great. I'm soooooo fuckin'
great. I'm worshipped the world around. I'm
the überauthor. All I require is the perfect read
er. I'm God. God is dead, and I got the job.
That's why I masturbate so much.

I think we can all see the humor in this, as
well as its almost poignant relevancy. And Joel's
making $1,500 a week now writing home deco
ration tips for Martha Stewart. I think you see,
what I'm saying. J
• Get a little photo of yourself Like this —'
• Be marginalized Have you ever noticed how
many Daily columns stress the writer's mem
bership in a marginalized group? Just coinci
dence? I think not.
Being different always equals being interest
ing, and everyone can find something different
about them. Are you short? Tall? Rich? Poor?
AfTlicted with chronic halitosis? Just find what
makes you marginalized, and plug it in to this
simple template:
I'll never forget the day I found out I was
1 was on the playground, playing kickball,
and I dropped a fly ball. This other kid on my
team said, "Nice catch, !"
Later that day, I asked my mom what that
meant, and she explained that it was a mean
way of saying . I cried myself to sleep that
night.
Don't think it'll work? Just take a gander at
this beauty, expressing the pain of being in a
group that "polite society" disdains:
I'll never forget the day I found out I was an
asshole.
I was on the playground, playing kickball,
and I dropped a fly ball. This other kid on my
team said, "Nice catch, asshole!"
Later that day, I asked my mom what that
meant, and she explained that it was a mean
way of saying sphincter. I cried myself to sleep
that night.
Now there's something lots of Stanford stu
dents can relate to.
• Criticize things you don't know about If
The Review can do it...
• Pick hip topics When you apply to be an
Opinions page columnist, you have to submit
five to 10 ideas for future columns. This is what
separates the Virginia Tsais from the rejects (If
you don't know who Virginia Tsai is, ask a
senior, they'll tell you.)
When you submit your ideas, think of what
all the columnists for the past few years have
been writing — remember, if they're columnists
they must be doing something right, especially if
they do it over and over again.
For example, look at this poor soul who had

the wrong idea for column topics:
1) Studying for grades vs. studying for
knowledge
2) The benefits of committing to an extracur
ricular activity
3) Weighing teaching and research
4) What is our moral duty at Webb Ranch
5) Answer that Virginia girl's Christmas letter
Morality? Balance? Get me the Vivarin. This is
not what the Zooropa, severed penis, clear malt
beverage generation wants. Now this is a list of
column topics that will be sure to get you hired:
1) Hug therapy/Teddy bear strangulation
2) A purple-prose paean to the lost art of let
ter writing
3) Obscene vagina poetry
4) What it's like to be a Daily columnist
5) Why police suck
Now that's worth reading about.
• Misspell things on purpose Even occas
sional readers of Intermission know how much
intentional misspellings can spice up columns,
especially music reviews. Words like "phrat,"
and "badd" — or better yet the digits 2 and 4 for
"to" and "for" — let all your readers know "I'm
cool — I can't spell."
Music columnists Jim Haljun and Pat Dote
introduced the word "phat" to Stanford's lexi
con. Look how hip it can be:
I'll never forget the day I found out I was
phat.
I was on the playground, playing kickball,
and I dropped a fly ball. This other kid on my
team said, "Nice catch, phat so!"
Later that day, I asked my mom what that
meant, and she explained that it was another
way of spelling faL. 1 cried myself to sleep that
night.
So if you really want to be a Daily columnist,
quit whining and start writing, keeping these
few hints in mind. And remember, there's still
one sure way to get your column in The Daily —
just drop a sample column in my box at The
Daily with a $20 bill attached to it.
TVust me, it's the best way.

Andy Dworkin is a junior majoring in history.
He is willing to shave if you can tell him where
the pro fros go to hook up.

Ever wonder wtly this space s always empty'' Me too

group that "polite society" disdains:
I'll never forget the day I found out I was an
asshole.
I was on the playground, playing kickball,
and I dropped a fly ball. This other kid on my
team said, "Nice catch, asshole!"
Later that day, I asked my mom what that
meant, and she explained that it was a mean
way of saying sphincter. I cried myself to sleep
that night.
Now there's something lots of Stanford stu
dents can relate to.
• Criticize things you don't know about If
The Review can do it...
• Pick hip topics When you apply to be an
Opinions page columnist, you have to submit
five to 10 ideas for future columns. This is what
separates the Virginia Tsais from the rejects (If
you don't know who Virginia Tsai is, ask a
senior, they'll tell you.)
When you submit your ideas, think of what
all the columnists for the past few years have
been writing — remember, if they're columnists
they must be doing something right, especially if
they do it over and over again.
For example, look at this poor soul who had

the wrong idea for column topics:
1) Studying for grades vs. studying for
knowledge
2) The benefits of committing to an extracur
ricular activity
3) Weighing teaching and research
4) What is our moral duty at Webb Ranch
5) Answer that Virginia girl's Christmas letter
Morality? Balance? Get me the Vivarin. This is
not what the Zooropa, severed penis, clear malt
beverage generation wants. Now this is a list of
column topics that will be sure to get you hired:
1) Hug therapy/Teddy bear strangulation
2) A purple-prose paean to the lost art of let
ter writing
3) Obscene vagina poetry
4) What it's like to be a Daily columnist
5) Why police suck
Now that's worth reading about.
• Misspell things on purpose Even occas
sional readers of Intermission know how much
intentional misspellings can spice up columns,
especially music reviews. Words like "phrat,"
and "badd" — or better yet the digits 2 and 4 for
"to" and "for" — let all your readers know "I'm
cool — I can't spell."
Music columnists Jim Haljun and Pat Dote
introduced the word "phat" to Stanford's lexi
con. Look how hip it can be:
I'll never forget the day I found out I was
phat.
I was on the playground, playing kickball,
and I dropped a fly ball. This other kid on my
team said, "Nice catch, phat so!"
Later that day, I asked my mom what that
meant, and she explained that it was another
way of spelling faL. 1 cried myself to sleep that
night.
So if you really want to be a Daily columnist,
quit whining and start writing, keeping these
few hints in mind. And remember, there's still
one sure way to get your column in The Daily —
just drop a sample column in my box at The
Daily with a $20 bill attached to it.
TVust me, it's the best way.

Andy Dworkin is a junior majoring in history.
He is willing to shave if you can tell him where

u You work for The Daily? Do you know Joel
Stein?"
So you want to be a Daily columnist. Next to
sex, a columnist position at The Daily is
the most widely wanted and least widely
attained thing on campus.
And like sex, the writing of Daily columns
suffers from two main problems:
1) Doing it in public only entertains the doer,
not the audience.
2) You're not as good as you think you are.
That's where I come in. Maybe I've taken one
to many drags at the withered tit of human
kindness, or maybe I'm tired of reading crappy
sample columns. Maybe I just wanted the $20
(yeah, that's right, two-zero) I'll get for writing
this. At any rate, for those of you desperate to
get in on the action, desperate to get the fame,
money, respect — desperate to be a player —
here's the difinitive style guide on How to Write
a Stanford Daily Column.
• Use big words Everyone at Stanford burned
up their SAT-Verbal, so to make your prose
stand out you need to use big words and use 'em
indiscriminately.
Take this sorry sentence: "He had a
headache."
Yawn. Sure, it's got a little alliteration, and it
gets the point across succinctly, but it's missing
that style, that zip, that certain pinot noir.
Now pull out a dictionary and try this on for
size: "His head exploded in a priapism of pain."
Sure, It's a little longer and harder for the
average guy to understand, but it makes you
stand up and take notice, and that's what
counts.
•Be self-conscious Hey, it's a post-modern
world. Everybody wants to hear about you, and
better yet, wants to hear what you think about
you and read what you write about what you
think about you. As Tish would say:
Stop and smell the cafe latte.
But don't take my word for it, take a page
from Joel Stein's dime-store book. He's the last,
best columnist we had here at The Daily, and
just look at this excerpt from one of his
columns:
I'm great. I'm just great. I'm soooooo fuckin'
great. I'm worshipped the world around. I'm
the überauthor. All I require is the perfect read
er. I'm God. God is dead, and I got the job.
That's why I masturbate so much.

I think we can all see the humor in this, as
well as its almost poignant relevancy. And Joel's
making $1,500 a week now writing home deco
ration tips for Martha Stewart. I think you see,
what I'm saying. J
• Get a little photo of yourself Like this —'
• Be marginalized Have you ever noticed how
many Daily columns stress the writer's mem
bership in a marginalized group? Just coinci
dence? I think not.
Being different always equals being interest
ing, and everyone can find something different
about them. Are you short? Tall? Rich? Poor?
AfTlicted with chronic halitosis? Just find what
makes you marginalized, and plug it in to this
simple template:
I'll never forget the day I found out I was
1 was on the playground, playing kickball,
and I dropped a fly ball. This other kid on my
team said, "Nice catch, !"
Later that day, I asked my mom what that
meant, and she explained that it was a mean
way of saying . I cried myself to sleep that
