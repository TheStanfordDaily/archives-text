# University failing to meet minority grad student goal
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
The University has fallen 70
percent short in its five-year goal
of increasing enrollment of minor
ity graduate students, the Faculty
Senate's Committee on Graduate
Studies reported yesterday.
In presenting the committee's
annual report to the senate, chair
Judith Goldstein, professor of po
litical science, said it was "naive"
to expect a doubling of minority
graduate students from 1987-
1992, the target set by the com
mittee in February 1989.
"Unfortunately, the data will
show we have fallen quite short,"
she said. "[The data) I'm present
ing is nowhere near as comforting
as it is on the undergraduate
side."
Since 1987, the total number
of new enrollments of targeted

minorities in master's and Ph.D.
programs has increased from 125
to 163, a rise of just 30.4 percent.
Even more disquieting, Gold
stein said, was 10 percent decline
in minority Ph.D. enrollments
since 1988.
The report's findings raised
numerous questions and com
ments from the senate members.
Linguistics Prof. Elizabeth
Traugott called the decline in
Ph.D. students "very revealing
and very disturbing" and asked
what current plans are for dis
cerning why the University has
fallen short of its goal.
English Prof. George Dekker,
associate dean of graduate stud
ies, said he is currently assem
bling a committee of faculty and
students to "look at the reality be
hind the statistics."
