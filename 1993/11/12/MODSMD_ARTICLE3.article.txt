# University failing to meet minority grad student goal
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
The University has fallen 70
percent short in its five-year goal
of increasing enrollment of minor
ity graduate students, the Faculty
Senate's Committee on Graduate
Studies reported yesterday.
In presenting the committee's
annual report to the senate, chair
Judith Goldstein, professor of po
litical science, said it was "naive"
to expect a doubling of minority
graduate students from 1987-
1992, the target set by the com
mittee in February 1989.
"Unfortunately, the data will
show we have fallen quite short,"
she said. "[The data) I'm present
ing is nowhere near as comforting
as it is on the undergraduate
side."
Since 1987, the total number
of new enrollments of targeted

minorities in master's and Ph.D.
programs has increased from 125
to 163, a rise of just 30.4 percent.
Even more disquieting, Gold
stein said, was 10 percent decline
in minority Ph.D. enrollments
since 1988.
The report's findings raised
numerous questions and com
ments from the senate members.
Linguistics Prof. Elizabeth
Traugott called the decline in
Ph.D. students "very revealing
and very disturbing" and asked
what current plans are for dis
cerning why the University has
fallen short of its goal.
English Prof. George Dekker,
associate dean of graduate stud
ies, said he is currently assem
bling a committee of faculty and
students to "look at the reality be
hind the statistics."
"Lots of these numbers go back
10 years or more," Dekker said.
"What's disturbing is that we seem
to on a kind of plateau that . ..
essentially doesn't really go up
with any significant trajectory."
He also said that Stanford's
aggressiveness in recruiting stu
dents of color has been mirrored by
similar efforts at other institu
tions, making it difficult to matric
ulate accepted students. "While
the pool of applicants has
increased a little bit, we have more
people actively fishing in that
pool," he said.
Other senators said the Univer
sity needed further information on
the causes for low minority matric
ulation and the nature of the expe
rience of minority graduate stu
dents once they get to Stanford.
Political Science Prof. Stephen
Krasner suggested that one expla
nation for the low number of

minority graduate students might
be found in data on academic per
formance, such as "the percentage
of Phi Beta Kappas by ethnic
group." He added that the Univer
sity should compile information on
minority graduate student attri
tion, partly to discern whether stu
dent satisfaction correlates to
minority faculty representation.
Provost Condoleezza Rice
called Krasner's call for attrition
information an "important one,
because I have a suspicion we
have people on the rolls who have
long since dropped off the pro
gram."
Rice responded to Economics
Prof. Donald Brown's skepticism
about the availability of funding
for minority post-graduates in the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, emphasizing that the
schools still have supplemental
money to aid minorities, but that
the University's failure to matricu
late accepted minorities — even
with the promise of funding — sig
naled that "something else is going
w
on.

Part of the problem, according
to Medical Prof. Ed Harris and
Biology Prof. Robert Simoni, is the
attractiveness of professional
schools, which quite simply,
promise more lucrative futures to
their students.
After the meeting, Dekker said
that there are "a number of differ
ent factors" contributing to the
current paucity of minorities in
graduate school, but stressed that
the issue extends far beyond Stan
ford.
"We have to say that we want to
do better, and we can do better,"
he said. "But it's not as if we're
talking about the success this year
of our football team and the suc
cess of Notre Dame. We're doing
about as well as other institu
tions. ... This debate is going on a
national level."
The lengthy discussion on Gold
stein's report reflected the wide
ranging character of yesterday's
session, which featured abstract
exchanges on educational philoso
phy as much as on concrete policy
action.

Though Rice deferred elabora
tion on the $20 million round of
budget cuts she announced
Wednesday, she fielded concerns
voiced by English Prof. Ron Reb
holz about the level of faculty
involvement in the process.
"I would welcome the chance to
come to the senate several times,"
she said. "There is plenty of time
and room for consultation."
She also informed ASSU repre
sentative Derek Miyahara, who
asked about student input into the
effort, that she will meet with the
Council of Presidents monthly,
and pledged that though the new
cuts "may mean we have to get out
of some [University] services, the
services that remain will be of the
highest possible quality."
Meanwhile, a rather innocuous
proposal in the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies' annual
report to certify a course's satisfac
tion of two distribution require
ments turned into a much larger
discussion on the very logic and
effectiveness of the entire DR sys
tem.

The fireworks began when Reb
holz questioned how the course,
Classics 169: Ancient Greek
Ethics, could meet both the Area 7
and Area 8 requirement. Dekker
also said "it is difficult to imagine a
course that would satisfy both"
and said senate approval of such
recommendations should not be
mere "rituals."
But when Physics Prof.
Alexander Fetter asked commit
tee chair David Brady how many
courses satisfied more than one
DR, Brady pointed out that more
than 80 courses between the His
tory and English departments
alone satisfy more than one
requirement.
Education Prof. Myra Strober
said that fact displayed the need to
reconsider the whole DR system, a
suggestion that seemed to win
agreement from the entire senate,
in particular History Prof. James
Sheehan, chair of the Commission
on Undergraduate Education.
"It has not escaped our atten
tion that there are aspects of the
system that are not ideal, and cer

tainly any changes we might sug
gest ought to include guidance (on
this issue]," he said. "A little
patience will be worth the senate's
time." The senate subsequently
approved the recommendation.
In other business, the senate
unanimously approved discontinu
ation of the bachelor of science
program in Microbiology and
Immunology, citing a decline in
interest among students and facul
ty. They also approved a second
five-year authorization of the grad
uate programs in Scientific Com
puting and Computational Mathe
matics.
In addition, Biology Prof. Craig
Heller, chair of the senate Com
mittee on Research, released a
summary of the 10 proposed
guidelines of a new University pol
icy on conflict of interest, warning
the senate of potentially controver
sial rules on intellectual property
rights. Heller said the final draft of
the policy will be presented for
senate approval early next quarter.
The policy was not discussed by
the senate yesterday.

money to aid minorities, but that
the University's failure to matricu
late accepted minorities — even
with the promise of funding — sig
naled that "something else is going
w
on.

Part of the problem, according
to Medical Prof. Ed Harris and
Biology Prof. Robert Simoni, is the
attractiveness of professional
schools, which quite simply,
promise more lucrative futures to
their students.
After the meeting, Dekker said
that there are "a number of differ
ent factors" contributing to the
current paucity of minorities in
graduate school, but stressed that
the issue extends far beyond Stan
ford.
"We have to say that we want to
do better, and we can do better,"
he said. "But it's not as if we're
talking about the success this year
of our football team and the suc
cess of Notre Dame. We're doing
about as well as other institu
tions. ... This debate is going on a
national level."
The lengthy discussion on Gold
stein's report reflected the wide
ranging character of yesterday's
session, which featured abstract
exchanges on educational philoso
phy as much as on concrete policy
action.

Though Rice deferred elabora
tion on the $20 million round of
budget cuts she announced
Wednesday, she fielded concerns
voiced by English Prof. Ron Reb
holz about the level of faculty
involvement in the process.
"I would welcome the chance to
come to the senate several times,"
she said. "There is plenty of time
and room for consultation."
She also informed ASSU repre
sentative Derek Miyahara, who
asked about student input into the
effort, that she will meet with the
Council of Presidents monthly,
and pledged that though the new
cuts "may mean we have to get out
of some [University] services, the
services that remain will be of the
highest possible quality."
Meanwhile, a rather innocuous
proposal in the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies' annual
report to certify a course's satisfac
tion of two distribution require
ments turned into a much larger
discussion on the very logic and
effectiveness of the entire DR sys
tem.

The fireworks began when Reb
holz questioned how the course,
Classics 169: Ancient Greek
Ethics, could meet both the Area 7
and Area 8 requirement. Dekker
also said "it is difficult to imagine a
course that would satisfy both"
and said senate approval of such
recommendations should not be
mere "rituals."
But when Physics Prof.
Alexander Fetter asked commit
tee chair David Brady how many
courses satisfied more than one
DR, Brady pointed out that more
than 80 courses between the His
tory and English departments
alone satisfy more than one
requirement.
Education Prof. Myra Strober
said that fact displayed the need to
reconsider the whole DR system, a
suggestion that seemed to win
agreement from the entire senate,
in particular History Prof. James
Sheehan, chair of the Commission
on Undergraduate Education.
"It has not escaped our atten
tion that there are aspects of the
system that are not ideal, and cer

tainly any changes we might sug
gest ought to include guidance (on
this issue]," he said. "A little
patience will be worth the senate's
time." The senate subsequently
approved the recommendation.
In other business, the senate
unanimously approved discontinu
ation of the bachelor of science
program in Microbiology and
Immunology, citing a decline in
interest among students and facul
ty. They also approved a second
five-year authorization of the grad
uate programs in Scientific Com
puting and Computational Mathe
matics.
In addition, Biology Prof. Craig
Heller, chair of the senate Com
mittee on Research, released a
summary of the 10 proposed
guidelines of a new University pol
icy on conflict of interest, warning
the senate of potentially controver
sial rules on intellectual property
rights. Heller said the final draft of
the policy will be presented for
senate approval early next quarter.
The policy was not discussed by
the senate yesterday.
The University has fallen 70
percent short in its five-year goal
of increasing enrollment of minor
ity graduate students, the Faculty
Senate's Committee on Graduate
Studies reported yesterday.
In presenting the committee's
annual report to the senate, chair
Judith Goldstein, professor of po
litical science, said it was "naive"
to expect a doubling of minority
graduate students from 1987-
1992, the target set by the com
mittee in February 1989.
"Unfortunately, the data will
show we have fallen quite short,"
she said. "[The data) I'm present
ing is nowhere near as comforting
as it is on the undergraduate
side."
Since 1987, the total number
of new enrollments of targeted

minorities in master's and Ph.D.
programs has increased from 125
to 163, a rise of just 30.4 percent.
Even more disquieting, Gold
stein said, was 10 percent decline
in minority Ph.D. enrollments
since 1988.
The report's findings raised
numerous questions and com
ments from the senate members.
Linguistics Prof. Elizabeth
Traugott called the decline in
Ph.D. students "very revealing
and very disturbing" and asked
what current plans are for dis
cerning why the University has
fallen short of its goal.
English Prof. George Dekker,
associate dean of graduate stud
ies, said he is currently assem
bling a committee of faculty and
students to "look at the reality be
hind the statistics."
"Lots of these numbers go back
10 years or more," Dekker said.
"What's disturbing is that we seem
to on a kind of plateau that . ..
essentially doesn't really go up
with any significant trajectory."
He also said that Stanford's
aggressiveness in recruiting stu
dents of color has been mirrored by
similar efforts at other institu
tions, making it difficult to matric
ulate accepted students. "While
the pool of applicants has
increased a little bit, we have more
people actively fishing in that
pool," he said.
Other senators said the Univer
sity needed further information on
the causes for low minority matric
ulation and the nature of the expe
rience of minority graduate stu
dents once they get to Stanford.
Political Science Prof. Stephen
Krasner suggested that one expla
nation for the low number of

minority graduate students might
be found in data on academic per
formance, such as "the percentage
of Phi Beta Kappas by ethnic
group." He added that the Univer
sity should compile information on
minority graduate student attri
tion, partly to discern whether stu
dent satisfaction correlates to
minority faculty representation.
Provost Condoleezza Rice
called Krasner's call for attrition
information an "important one,
because I have a suspicion we
have people on the rolls who have
long since dropped off the pro
gram."
Rice responded to Economics
Prof. Donald Brown's skepticism
about the availability of funding
for minority post-graduates in the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, emphasizing that the
schools still have supplemental
money to aid minorities, but that
the University's failure to matricu
late accepted minorities — even
with the promise of funding — sig
naled that "something else is going
