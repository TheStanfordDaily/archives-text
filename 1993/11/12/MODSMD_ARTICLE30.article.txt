# Lingering toons: That ain't all, folks
## 
### Andrea Chartock 
You grab a cup of chocolate milk
and a handful of Oreos and run and
jump onto the couch in front of the
television just as "Looney Toons"
explodes onto the screen.
"Nah-nat-neh-nah-nett-nett
nett-nea ..."
You know the opening song as
well as Daffy and scream out as
you shoot your younger brother
with an imaginary shotgun,
yelling, "I'm hunting wabbits."
Some might think this a
description of a child at age 10. But
not you.
"Hey, that sounds like me nowl"
you exclaim. Some people carry the
wonderful world of cartoons with
them for their whole lives. There is
something special about the world
where Wile E. Coyote falls off a
1,000-foot gorge, gets blown up bya
six-pack of dynamite and survives,
only to be tormented by the imper
vious Road Runner some more.
Many hold that cartoons have
helped create the American imagi
nation. The cartoons children

grow up watching mold their sense
of humor, as well as their tolerance
for explosions.
Thus, in order to gain a new,
more pop-culture-icon kind of per
spective on the Stanford campus,
we strove to find which cartoons
various Stanford personalities
grew up watching, and whether
they had any obvious effects on
what type of people they became.
Call it a post-modern reading of
campus sentiment.
Football star Justin Armour
provides an excellent example of
how the toons children watch have
an effect on who they become. He
said that his favorite character was
Erik in "Dungeons and Dragons."
Commented Armour, "He was
sweet because he had this bow and
arrow. He was the coolest because
he had an unlimited supply of
arrows. I'm similar because I have
an unlimited supply of hyperness."
Yabba Dabba Quarterback Steve
Stenstrom says that his favorite
cartoon character was Fred Flint
stone, because "the Flintstones

were sweet." Stenstrom's identifi
cation with the modern stone-ager
is understandable seeing how often
Fred got sacked by Dino.
Beloved Stanford post office
Manager Ed Nava was so enthusi
astic about his cartoon of choice
that he waved his arms in the air
and yelled out "Popeye the Sailor
Man!" He attributes the lopsided
sailor's charm to his being so
"funny and exciting, you know?"
This leads us to wonder whether
the lines at the post office would
move just a wee bit faster if only its
employees began taking spinach
breaks every so often.
Okay, maybe not.
And how about the mother of
Ugly Kid Joe, Lina Crane (a.k.a.
The Nicest Person Alive Lady),
who works at Wells Fargo? "I
didn't watch cartoons on TV," she
said, "but my favorite cartoon strip
character was Dagwood Bumstead.
He was so messy and it made me
feel more comfortable with my own
inadequacy to be neat and orderly."
Thus, ol' Dagwood just may have
been the model of permissiveness
which helped create Ugly Kid Joe's
unshowered, disheveled look. Ah,
how the wheel of pop-culture spins
round and round.
Stanford's accomplished New
Age piano player Mike Halaas said
that the most influential toonhead
of his youth was the mutant-pow
ered Iceman, from the noontime
Saturday classic "Spider-Man and
his Amazing Friends." Even
though the cartoon bled into col
lege-football TV time, "Iceman
shot this really cool shit out of his
fingers and rode on it. I could never
be that cool." Words to live by.
Student, Sarah Cranston states
that "Dungeons and Dragons" was
her favorite cartoon when she was
growing up because "all the girls
kicked butt!" Today, Sarah — well
known by her peers as an avid fem
inist — is often to be heard in class
defending her independence,
remarking "Uh, excuse me, but a
woman doesn't need a man to be
complete."
One might wonder about the

favorite animated adventures of
the Stanford administrators.
Unfortunately, President Casper,
Provost Rice, and Dean Montoya
weren't available for comment,
though rumor has it that the three
get together at Casper's house
every Saturday morning and reli
giously watch "The Mighty Mor
phin' Power Rangers."
But being lucky enough to grow
up with cartoons is a more recent
generational development, accord
ing to Norma, one of the famous
"Bookstore Ladies" from the cus
tomer service department. "Honey,
when I was growing up it was long
before TV. We read a lot of books
and the Compton's Encyclopedia,"
she exclaimed. "We were a little dif
ferent than the other kids."
But Norma wasn't the only one
who was, ahem, a little different.
Almost all of the successful female
athletes interviewed had never
really watched cartoons when they
were younger. Volleyball star
Piper Hahn said, "It sounds like I
grew up in an authoritarian house
hold, but my parents didn't let me
watch them."
Field hockey power-scorer
Sarah Hallock states, "I didn't
really watch TV. I liked Popeye's
forceps, though."
And stellar soccer star Sarah
Rafanelli simply stated, "You
know, I didn't even watch car
toons. I can't think of any."
Even Olympic swimmer Allison
Higson hadn't been a cartoon fan
growing up.
One begins to wonder if the time
these stars spent on athletics,
rather than the Wondertwins and
Gleek, is the secret to their success.
Nah.
And so we see a cacophony of
cartoons — from Snorks, to
Smurfs to Scooby to Superman —
each shaping the Saturday morn
ing and schoolday afternoons of
anyone who ever had a TV.
But with all this, will we ever
answer the eternal question: Cap
tain Caveman vs. Grape Ape,
who'd be left standing?
