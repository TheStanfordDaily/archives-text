# Wynter speaks on inner city, race relations
## 
### Cametra Thompson Staff writer 
Just as black men and women were lynched
in the past, young black men and women are
being lynched every day in the United States,
Prof. Sylvia Wynter said last night in a discus
sion with more than 60 students in Roble Hall.
Wynter, a professor in the Spanish, Por
tuguese and African and Afro-American Stud
ies Departments, said America is lynching
black people by destroying the stability of the
inner city and negating the existence of black
people in society.
She said this lynching parallels the physical
hanging that is used to verify a belief system

that validates the superiority of white society.
"Through the negation of black, they can imag
ine themselves as white, as a sacred body of
people," she said.
Wynter said joblessness and the so-called
"war on drugs" and crime is destroying the
inner city. "I am so afraid of an Auschwitz hap
pening in America," she said, noting that talk
of purging America of the problems of the inner
city is frighteningly similar to Hitler's talk of
purging Germany of inferior races.
She said joblessness is the result of the eco
nomic organization of society that values prof
itability over the well-being of the worker. "No
crisis we face — NAFTA, world poverty — is
not the direct result of the economic organiza

tion of society," she said.
Education — another crisis — is also the
result of what she termed "homo economi
cus." Because the importance of profitability
is taught in our educational system, people
are de-emphasized and, in the process,
marginalized.
Race, Wynter added, is seen as a biological
phenomenon and a fundamental organizing
principle of civilization. But, she said, race is
actually the combination of culture and biology,
and this is how people see themselves. Race,
therefore, must be seen as a cultural, systemic
phenomenon.
Wynter spoke as part of Sigma Gamma Rho
sorority's Founder's Week activities.
