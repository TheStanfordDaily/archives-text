Entrepreneurship explained
About 90 people gathered at the Law School last night to
hear David Liddle, the CEO of Interval Research Corporation,
speak about how to design and develop products for the future.
"I'm going to talk about where the ideas that let you make
new business and industries come from. Of course, I'm not
going to tell you what the actual ideas are," Liddle said.
Using videos and overheads, Liddle explained the history
of computing, how and why it changed and where it's going.
"In the future we will see portable, wearable, embedded,
environmental devices of many kinds," he said. The enter
tainment market, not the business market will set the foun
dational technologies in place, he added.
"All of the best opportunities in going forward are in provid
ing products for the individual. What we're trying to do is under
stand what people want to lay down their money for," he said.
The program was presented by Stanford Ventures Forum,
an interdisciplinary graduate school organization.

Fellini remembered at Casa Italiana
More than 50 Stanford students and faculty members
packed La Casa Italiana's lounge last night to honor Federico
Fellini, the acclaimed Italian director who passed away Oct. 31.
Fellini, who was born in 1920, spent much of his life under
the shadow of fascism and the restrictive papal authority,
both of which he ridiculed in his films.
Yesterday's event consisted of clips from five of Fellini's
films and speakers who commented on the humor, symbol
ism and autobiographical nature of his films.
Speakers included students, faculty members and Walter
Murch, picture editor for the "Godfather" series and "Apoca
lypse Now." "When I watched 'La Dolce Vita,' I was power
fully struck that this was a film by someone. I had a sense of
his personality," Murch said.
French and Italian Prof. Anna Maria Napolitano said that
after watching the film "8 1/2," she better understood her hus
band's wistful gazings. In "8 1/2," a married Italian man who
cannot forget the women of his life banishes them to the attic,
which symbolizes his memory, by brandishing a whip.
