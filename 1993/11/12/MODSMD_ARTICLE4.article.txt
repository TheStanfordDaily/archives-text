# New themes to help bolster fund raising

Two years after completing a
$1.2 billion Centennial fund-rais
ing campaign, University officials
are trying to find new ways to keep
money flowing into Stanford's
piggy bank.
University President Gerhard
Casper has suggested the use of
three new "themes" as a way to
give shape to — and hopefully
boost — future alumni donations.
Casper said the three themes,
"restoration, preservation and in
novation," which he first dis
cussed with volunteers during
Alumni Weekend in October, are
not part of another fund-raising
campaign, but a way to provide
more focus to ongoing solicita
tions.
"We cannot stop raising funds,
because the need is great, perhaps

greater than last year's," Casper
said. "But we're not ready to begin
another campaign — that would
be preposterous."
He said the new fund-raising
themes have "not really (been)
publicly announced in any form
because we do not want to suggest
that this is a campaign." However,
he continued, "We do have to give
some shape to our fund raising as
a whole."
Assoc. Vice President of Devel
opment Stephen Peeps stressed
that the money raised from the
restoration, preservation and in
novation themes will not be allo
cated into three separate funds.
The labels are to serve only as
marketing tools, he said.
According to Casper, "restora
tion" entails repairing buildings,
architecture and infrastructure
