## Forum to address women's health issues 
### Nami Kim Staff writer 
Women's health issues — including
AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases and
the underrepresentation of wonien in med
ical research — will be featured at forum
today in Tresidder Union, marking Gov.
Pete Wilson's official proclamation of the
first California Women's Health Day.
Organized by the Stanford Institute for
Research on Women and Gender, the pro
gram will address topics many believe have
been ignored for years. The event, which
was originally intended to take place
statewide, was limited to Stanford due to
lack of funding and the small size of the in
stitute's staff.
The program will bring together 10
women's health groups from on- and ofT
campus and present three speakers to ad

dress the declining state of women's health
care, according to Sherri Matteo, deputy di
rector of the institute.
"There is an absolute paucity of infor
mation on women's issues," she said, not
ing that women have traditionally been ig
nored in both research and funding con
cerning health care.
Matteo said that women, as consumers,
spend more on medical care than men but
that only a fraction of federal health funds
are allocated for women.
In addition, she said, women have been
excluded as a research population when
testing for diseases and preventive medi
cine. "Results have been generalized to in
clude women," said Matteo, who explained
that even when testing medicine for breast
cancer, men were used as subjects.
Today's programming will
include booths from such organiza
tions as Women Organized
Responding to Life Threatening
Diseases (WORLD), Planned Par
enthood, the National Asian
Women's Health Organization, the
Stanford Women's Center and
Cowell Student Health Center's
Health Promotion Program.
According to Dr. Iris Litt, direc
tor of the institute and one of the
speakers, the program is a long
awaited one. "There is an igno
rance of the wide range of health
needs for women," said Litt, who
suggested the state health day to
Gov. Wilson.
Wilson's declaration follows a
"good deal of pressure in Califor
nia," Litt said — the same kind of
pressure that forced the establish
ment of the Office of Women's
Health in the state Department of
Health recently.
She noted that many people
either believe women are healthier
than men or pay attention only to
reproduction-related health issues.
Litt will address the traditional
practice of applying research based
on male subjects to women, with

out taking into account their dif
ferences. "We don't have enough
information to provide preventive
services for women," she said.
The program will also place an
emphasis on the growing needs of
minority women, who can face
greater financial and cultural obsta
cles in receiving medical care.
Carol Pertofsky, director of the
Cowell Health Promotion Program
said the women's health day is a
"marvelous opportunity for
women to look at current and criti
cal health issues."
"Women of all ages need to
become empowered in their health
care, and know what it takes to be
a healthy woman today," she said.
The event will also feature a
film on AIDS, called "AIDS and
Women, the Greatest Gamble,"
which follows the lives of five HlV
positive women.
Rebecca Dennision, director of
WORLD, who will follow the movie
with an in-depth discussion of
AIDS, said, "We hope to take away
some of the fear and anxiety asso
ciated with health concerns, and
replace it with information."
She added, though, that she
hopes an attitude of awareness will
transcend the program, and that
Wilson will realize it's "not enough
to just declare a health day. We
need a lot of action."
