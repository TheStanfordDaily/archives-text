# New directories hit campus

It's finally here.
The Directory, that is. Student issues of
the phone book were hand delivered to dor
mitories yesterday — five days ahead of
schedule — by the Directory's 12 staff
members. Delivery to graduate students
will be next, and faculty and staff copies
will follow by Dec. 3.
Stanford veterans will recognize the
basic layout of the book, which remains
similar from year to year. The minor
changes which have been made are more
"fine-tuning than anything else," said
1993-94 Directory Project Director Mimi

Kuo. This year, section dividers are two
and four-color glossies, and the "Farm
Index" is now called the "Index."
The Directory staff has almost complet
ed its mission, taken up more than eight
months ago. "It takes unfailing dedication,
but it definitely pays off," Kuo said. "We
have an exceptionally talented group this
year."
The aim of the staff, Kuo said, was to
produce a user-friendly book that meets
the needs of the many campus groups and
with which the community can become fa
miliar, rather than a radically new format
each year.
She said this year has been
very successful for the Directory,
with advertising sales breaking
records. The Directory — which
has a circulation of about 31,000
— works with a budget of
$300,000; this year they sold
$305,000 worth of ads, beating
previous records by $25,000.
The staff also had new com
puter equipment this year, an
added bonus which is reflected in
its graphically oriented theme —
especially on the cover, which is a
departure from the typical archi
tecture-inspired covers of past
years, Kuo said.
However, despite its technical
progress, the Directory is still
stuck in past tax problems. Last
year, the Directory — a non-prof
it organization which raised
money through advertising —
confronted problems regarding
whether it would have to pay
back taxes on several years of
advertising revenue.
"Nothing has been resolved,"
according to Kuo. "We still don't
know for sure if there is a prob
lem."
