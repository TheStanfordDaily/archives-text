# New directories hit campus

It's finally here.
The Directory, that is. Student issues of
the phone book were hand delivered to dor
mitories yesterday — five days ahead of
schedule — by the Directory's 12 staff
members. Delivery to graduate students
will be next, and faculty and staff copies
will follow by Dec. 3.
Stanford veterans will recognize the
basic layout of the book, which remains
similar from year to year. The minor
changes which have been made are more
"fine-tuning than anything else," said
1993-94 Directory Project Director Mimi

Kuo. This year, section dividers are two
and four-color glossies, and the "Farm
Index" is now called the "Index."
The Directory staff has almost complet
ed its mission, taken up more than eight
months ago. "It takes unfailing dedication,
but it definitely pays off," Kuo said. "We
have an exceptionally talented group this
year."
The aim of the staff, Kuo said, was to
produce a user-friendly book that meets
the needs of the many campus groups and
with which the community can become fa
miliar, rather than a radically new format
