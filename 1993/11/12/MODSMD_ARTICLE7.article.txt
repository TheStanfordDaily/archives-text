# Students plant tree for Mid East peace
## Arabs, Israelis join in show of support 
### Cametra Thompson Staff writer 
More than 30 students, faculty and staff
came together yesterday to express their sup
port and desire for peace in the Middle East by
planting an olive tree in Old Union Courtyard.
"The olive tree has always been a symbol for
peace," said junior Shelley Valdes, who helped
organize the effort to unite Israeli and Arabic
groups on campus.
Valdes lived in the Israel for two years and
served in the Israeli Army before coming to
Stanford. Before placing the tree in the ground,
she quoted Israeli President Yitzak Rabin and
Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yass
er Arafat's statements on the Sept. 13 peace
agreement between Israel and the PLO. Arabs
and Israelis alike then grabbed shovels and ce
mented the planting.
The tree had been placed in a pot during the
Gulf War, in hopes that the war would end and
result in peace. Valdes said that she and others
thought it would be appropriate to put the tree
into the ground now to show their support for
the peace agreement.
Although she is a member of the Israeli Stu
dent Organization, Valdes said that she and se
nior Tariq Bujsaim deliberately kept the efforts

the peace efforts.

groups, but we wanted to show
that we support the agreement
and hope for peace," she said.
Freshman Gil Rabinovici
found the gathering tense, yet
hopeful. After three years in the
Israeli Army, he said he has come
to realize that the peace agree
ment is the only logical alterna
tive, although he still remembers
the tensions before the agree

ment.
"As a child, you are taught not
to pick up something on the street
because it may be a bomb," he
said. Rabinovici had his first dis
cussions with an Arab only this
year, talking to a Jordanian in his
dorm. He doubts such talks with
Arabs would have been possible
before. "These were people who
were trying to shoot me six
months ago."
"As difficult as this may be for
me, I realize that we have to make
concessions, and it is the only way
we can make a future," he said.
