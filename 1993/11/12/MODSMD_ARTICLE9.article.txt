# New group protects animal rights
## 
### Jim Luh 
White rats and black squirrels got a boost
yesterday afternoon as a new student group
committed to eventually ending all animal
research at Stanford took to White Plaza, sign
ing up new members and handing out informa
tion packets.
The Stanford Animal Protection and Education
Society, founded by six Law School students, aims
to educate the Stanford community about issues in
animal research at Stanford and beyond. Second
year law student Nathan Winograd, president and
founder of the organization, said the group's pri
mary purpose is raising consciousness of animal
research issues at Stanford.
While pleased with the response from passers
by, Winograd expressed frustration that the Stan
ford community seems largely unaware of the
extensive amount of animal research and alleged
abuse that goes on at the University.
One student who stopped at the table, graduate
student Paris Karasso, said that although he was
unaware of animal treatment at Stanford in par
ticular, he was generally "for treating animals
right."
According to Winograd, Stanford receives
about $90 million in federal research funds for
studies involving animals every year. Between
55,000 and 85,000 animals are involved each year,
he said.
"Something this important should be a matter
for public discussion and not shrouded in secrecy,"
he said.

The group has also committed itself to challeng
ing the notion that animal research benefits
human health.
Winograd pointed out that despite vast amounts
of animal research poured into AIDS, cancer, and
heart disease research, more people continue to die
of these diseases every year. "I think it's time to
look at new avenues (for medical research!," he
said.
Winograd said the group would also like to see
a reduction in the number of animals used in
Stanford laboratories and an end to experiments
he described as "redundant or trivial." For exam
ple, he said Stanford primate studies on maternal
deprivation demonstrate effects "any mother
could tell you."
In addition, the group would like to see outside
humane organizations involved in departmental
animal research committees, which Winograd said
are currently internally reviewed and function as
"a rubber stamp."
Biological Sciences Prof. Craig Heller said that
he saw little validity in the group's concerns. He
pointed out that a University oversight committee
composed of faculty, staff and outside parties
approves all animal research at Stanford, and that
ending animal research would be a major blow to
biomedical science.
Heller said that the group's impact on the Stan
ford community would depend on their methods.
He deplored the random acts of vandalism with
which animal rights activists are often connected.
"On the other hand," Heller said, "if they stimu
late debate, that's probably useful."
