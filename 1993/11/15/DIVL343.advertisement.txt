When Considering Your Career
Opportunities,
Consider One More Thing.
Consider the investment bank where
a variety of opportunities are available
for undergraduates from a wide range
of backgrounds. Where investment
banking, sales, trading, information
technology, finance, asset management,
research, operations and consulting
are integral to the firm's success. And
where finding the area that is right
for you is as simple as joining us at
our upcoming information sessions.
In short, consider Goldman Sachs.
