Israel urges action from Arafat
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel accepted the PLO's condemnation of
the killing of a Jewish settler, but pressed Yasser Arafat yesterday to
exert more control over the occupied territories before the implemen
tation of autonomy.
A day before peace talks were to resume, Israeli Police Minister
Moshe Shahal said Arafat must rein in radicals, especially those from
the extremist Hamas and the Islamic Jihad groups, which oppose
Israel-PLO peacemaking.
"This is what we expect from him, and this is his test. This is how
we will know how the agreement will progress and what will be the
extent of his validation on the ground," Shahal told reporters after the
weekly Cabinet meeting.
Yesterday, a group calling itself the Black 13th of September
Brigade claimed responsibility for Mizrachi's death and pledged to
launch similar attacks to disrupt the peace process.
Israel said Arafat's condemnation, the first time he denounced a
Palestinian attack in Israel or the occupied lands, would enable peace
talks to resume.
Israel hunts for more Dead Sea scrolls
WADIMAKUK, Occupied West Bank (AP) — Amid charges of last
minute plundering, Israel sent 16 teams of archaeologists fanning out
across the occupied West Bank in a massive search for more Dead Sea
scrolls yesterday.
Ancient documents, including poetry, legal texts and the earliest
known sections of the Bible, were found in Judean desert caves near
the Dead Sea over a 10-year period starting in 1947.
Scholars believe further scrolls could shed light on ancient Jewish
sects and groups that may have influenced early Christian thought.
"We hope that there are other scrolls, and if there are none then our
consciences will be clear. No one can say we never looked for them,"
said Efrat Orbach, spokeswoman for Israel's Antiquities Authority.
