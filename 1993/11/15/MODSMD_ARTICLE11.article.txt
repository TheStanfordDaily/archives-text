# NAFTA supporters warn of bill's defeat

WASHINGTON (AP) - NAFTA support
ers warned yesterday of dire consequences for
the president and the nation if Congress this
week rejects the free trade agreement with
Canada and Mexico.
Vice President A 1 Gore said a defeat for the
North American Free Trade Agreement would
be "really catastrophic" for President Clinton's
foreign policy agenda. Sen. Bill Bradley, D-
N.J., said a loss on NAFTA "endangers this
presidency."
Advocates on both sides of the trade issue
appeared on news programs yesterday to make
emotional pitches before the scheduled House
vote on Wednesday.
Gore, appearing on CBS' "Face the Nation,"
said Clinton is to attend an Asian-Pacific trade
summit in Seattle the day after the vote, and a
defeat "would be a terrible thing to do to the
president, to do to the country."

He said trading partners around the world
are "waiting to see whether or not we have the
courage of our convictions, whether we are
willing to walk the walk, to talk the talk."
On the other side, House Majority Whip
David Bonior, D-Mich. 112 said NAFTA was "in
the worst interests of working people" in the
three nations, and would result in lower wages
for American workers and the loss of 500,000
jobs to Mexico.
An Associated Press survey of the House
found that foes of the trade deal have the
upper hand. With opponents of the agreement
needing 217 votes to prevail, 203 representa
tives said they would vote against the measure
or were likely to do so. Arrayed against them
were 180 legislators who said they would vote
for the agreement or are likely to do so. That
left 51 undecided lawmakers.
Clinton invited about 15 of the undecided to

the White House for dinner last night, hoping
to press his case. About 20 representatives of
the AFL-CIO, a staunch NAFTA opponent,
stood outside a White House gate as the law
makers arrived, holding candles in silent
protest of the agreement.
"As representatives of the working people,
we want the legislators sitting down to eat with
the president to remember that this will cost
jobs," said Mark Anderson, trade director for
the labor federation.
Clinton last Wednesday played down the
effect of a defeat on his foreign policy authori
ty but expressed concern that "it would limit
my ability to argue that the Asians should open
their markets more."
The administration is worried that Clin
ton's efforts in Seattle to move Japan, China
and other Asian countries toward more open
trade will be undermined if NAFTA is rejected.
