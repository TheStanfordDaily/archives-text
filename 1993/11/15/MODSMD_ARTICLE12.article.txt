SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP>
— Supporters of continued com
monwealth status for Puerto Rico
defeated those who wanted state
hood in a vote yesterday that
turned back the strongest move
ment this century for full union
with Washington.
"The people spoke and I will
obey them," said Gov. Pedro
Rossello, who spearheaded the
statehood campaign, in acknowl
edging defeat to a speech of thou

sands of supporters.
But he added: "This is a strug
gle that will go on."
With votes counted from 99.7
percent of the precincts — 1,779
of 1,784 — official results showed
continuing commonwealth status
receiving 821,235 votes, or 48.4
percent; statehood 783,843, or
46.2 percent; and independence
75,034, or 4.4 percent.
The remaining ballots either
were left blank or were disqualified.

Ethnic pride and economic con
cerns were among the main issues
in the non-binding referendum.
Statehood supporters said it
would bring billions of additional
dollars in federal aid and played to
Puerto Ricans' fears by saying
their U.S. citizenship might be
lost if they stayed a common
wealth.
But commonwealth supporters
contended that the island's cul
ture and language might be lost in

statehood and noted that becom
ing a state would mean Puerto
Ricans would have to pay federal
taxes.
Although the margin of victory
for commonwealth status was less
than 3 percentage points, "this
was a clear repudiation of state
hood," said Miguel Hernandez
Agosto, leader of the pro-com
monwealth Popular Democratic
Party, at a celebration following
the vote.
