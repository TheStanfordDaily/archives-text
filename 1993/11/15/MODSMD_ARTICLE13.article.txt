### 
Stanford athletes should
now allow themselves to
be tested for use of drugs

WINNERS NEVER quit and
quitters never win. Not
wanting to be losers, the
University is now engaged in what
appears to be a hopeless battle
against the NCAA in the California
Supreme Court over a 1986 drug
testing suit.
The drug testing system used
by the NCAA in the mid-1980s
was clearly not an optimal one —
it involved monitored urination,
the completion of a questionnaire
which asked the applicant to
report birth-control pill use and
an inability to ensure a fail-proof
sample.
In 1986, the University got
behind the two Stanford athletes
who were spearheading a case
against the NCAA, and, along with
the ACLU, fought for the students'
right to privacy and questioned the
propriety of some of the NCAA
techniques.
This was an appropriate action
on the part of Stanford and its
Department of Athletics; it is the
duty of both institutions to pro
tect their athletes from harm,
not just to exploit their athletic
abilities.
By making a statement about
the NCAA drug-testing practices,
the University was attempting to
improve the environment for its
athletes.
Since then, however, the NCAA
has changed its drug-testing poli
cies. These alterations have of
fered the nation's athletes fairer
and less disagreeable testing.
First, the organization has been
able to guarantee fail-proof sam
ples via the process of taking two
samples and a back-up. They have
also recognized the invasiveness of
their methods.
Administrative improvements
such as these are a clear indication

that Stanford pursued a commend
able course of action which ulti
mately benefited the entirety of col
legiate athletics.
In fact, Stanford athletics has
emphatically affirmed its support
of nationwide drug testing,
opposing only the 1986 regula
tions.
However, this commitment to
the level playing field brought
about by drug testing is useless
when the rest of the NCAA's
members participate in such
tests while Stanford's athletes
exercise their option to decline,
as is their right under a court
injunction.
Unfortunately, due to this dis
crepancy, what was once a struggle
for the right to privacy and a call
for more accurate testing has
turned Stanford into a potential
cheat.
Drug testing is a lamentable
necessity in the high-powered
realm of college athletics. Howev
er, at this stage the Athletics
Department has its hands tied,
unable to mandate testing for its
athletes.
The time has come for student
athletes to take credibility and
equity into their own hands and
voluntarily undergo drug testing.
Teams and individual athletes
need to coordinate efforts to com
ply to drug testing standards, in
order to legitimize their perfor
mances, times and championships.
This action would uphold the
standards of justice and fair play
that the University has striven to
support.
In the meantime, the University
♦should not drop its case; it is best
served to have a concrete ruling in
case a similar case might arise in
the future.
Stanford has always had many
individuals participating in drug
testing, but the time has come for
all the University's programs to
follow suit.
Athletes should exercise their
option to willfully undergo drug
testing, sending a message to the
members of the NCAA that we
have nothing to hide.
