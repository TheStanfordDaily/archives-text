## Looking for life's meaning 
### 
I MET SOMEONE earlier this year
(who shall remain nameless for rea
sons soon to become apparent) who
had never heard of Monty Python. So
when he found out that there was a movie
called "The Meaning of Life," he was
intrigued by the idea of the explanation of
the meaning of life in just two hours.
And he still hasn't found what he's
looking for.
Webster took a different approach to
it, trying the infamous one-liner (directly
from "Webster's New World Dictionary,"
paperback edition):
"That property of plants and animals
(ending in death) which makes it possible
for them to take in food, get energy from
it, grow, etc."
I like the parenthetical note for those
of us clueless enough to look up "life" and
those of us who are immortal.
If those explanations didn't satisfy
your thirsting curiosity, it's my turn to
take a shot at explaining it. What are we
supposed to do in life? Why are we here?
Many of us live what I call a "contem
plative" life style, valuing the growth of
the mind or spirit. You know these people
as the ones who sit around much of the
day or night, contemplating tough philo
sophical questions, or at least seeming
that they do. But these conscientious
thinkers often hide their pensiveness in
other actions like reading, eating, social
izing, making mixes and, if advanced,

sleeping in class. To them, everyone else
is superficial, pretentious and prone to be
annoyingly, excessively cheerful all the
time.
Then there are other people that look
down on these thinkers, calling them
lazy, sluggish, sedentary, lifeless, lethar
gic and inert. You can recognize these
people by the frequent use of running
shoes, mountain bikes, Stairmasters and
spirulina, wheat germ or tofu in their
smoothies.
Which of course leaves room for the
people who look down on these two
groups for looking down on each other.
But there's more: other people think
we should live our lives for other people,
catering to the public need, working to
improve the world. These people can
often be found improving the world ("We
need NAFTA! Enough with the status
quo!"), inadvertently (or not) making
you feel guilty for not improving the
world ("What? You don't know what
NAFTA is?"), or discussing about
improving the world ("Oh, you mean the
North African Frisbee Throwers' Associ
ation. I guess somebody made the con
nection between Frisbees and a really big
beach.")
So with these varied views of the cor
rect way to live, what could be the reason
that we're here?
Well, that doesn't seem too hard:
we're here to be happy.

Stop! Before you go off and start ful
filling your wildest fantasies (no
description necessary here) in an
unadulterated, undiluted, uninterrupt
ed hedonistic frenzy of phenomena, pro
portions, there is a catch. You have to
do what makes you truly happy in the
long run. And whatever makes you
happy is up to you.
But this doesn't apply to just to people
but to everything.
Earth: "I wonder what it would be like
to suddenly stop and spin in the other
direction."
Governments: "Gee, I wish we had
peace."
Cars: "Wow, I think taking my owner
to the store would be so exciting."
Zoo animals: "I really wish I could
smack that kid."
Plants: "Grow, grow, grow, grow,
grow, reproduce, grow. ..."
Jelly fish: (Where are the brains on
those things anyway? You can see right
through them.)
And if a big group of lemmings wants
to commit mass suicide, hey, who am I to
make a moral judgment?

Thai is busy trying to figure out what
would happen if the earth had its wish
and is trying to talk the earth out of it.
