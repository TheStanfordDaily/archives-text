## Researchers must treat laboratory animals humanely 
### 
THE YEAR 1993 marks the 10th
anniversary of the "Snowball"
case. Ten years ago, a Stanford
medical student found Snowball, a large
white Samoyed dog, collapsed across the
threshold of a door in a research labora
tory located in the Palo Alto Veterans
Administration Hospital. Snowball had
multiple ulcerated open wounds on all of
his legs and an open incision on his
groin. He was in a great deal of pain and
could barely walk.
The medical student took Snowball to
an emergency clinic where, after deter
mining that Snowball had little chance
of recovering, he was humanely eutha
nized. Two necropsy reports determined
that Snowball was also suffering from

advanced pneumonia, chronic emacia
tion and dehydration. His wounds were
open, infected and festering.
The dog was part of cardiovascular
research under the auspices of Stanford
University. But Snowball's wounds were
unrelated to the subject of the research.
How could this have happened at one of
America's elite universities? Three
humane societies filed suit charging
abuse in the Snowball case. Unfortunate
ly, the laws designed to protect animals
like Snowball are weak and often unen
forced. They lost. But the real price was
paid by Snowball and others like him.
Ten years later, how much has
changed? Last year, Stanford once again
became the subject of investigation for

mistreatment of animals in the lab. Dr.
Thomas Hamm, then Chairman of the
Department of Comparative Medicine
and the person responsible for the facili
ty, conceded that "once or twice a year
we have a matter that's serious enough
that we close [a researcher] down. ..."
Other sources say the number is higher.
The use of animals in medical
research is very controversial. But wher
ever one stands on the issue, one thing
is clear: all animals deserve to be treated
as humanely as possible. Even one or
two animals a year being abused is far
too many. And what of the other mis
treatment that some do not deem "seri
ous"? This number is kept quiet.
There should be no cases of abuse or

mistreatment at Stanford or anywhere
else. If a wealthy elite institution like
Stanford cannot keep animals from
being mistreated, one wonders what it is
like at other labs.
Snowball strayed from his home in
Stockton, Calif. After being impounded
by animal control officers, he was sold to
the lab for research purposes. Although
pressed into the "service" of humanity,
he was ill-treated and suffered needless
ly. For the sake of the many others
beyond the laboratory door, Snowball
should not be forgotten.
