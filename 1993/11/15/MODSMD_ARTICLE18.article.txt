# It is helpful to see the 'other side' of many controversies

££ NLY CONNECT." E.M.
I lForster's wistful epigraph to
"Howard's End" echoes a pas
sage in Proust's "A la Recherche" where
the narrator observes that the more you
go on, the likelier you are to see the
"other side" of a controversy.
Four current affairs strike me as par
allel in this regard:
1. The doctors who began to clone
human embryos were, no doubt, not
thinking very much, at the time of the
"unintended consequences." They were
mostly concerned with the task and the
needs of the childless. The enormous
"other side" is coming out later, in an
on-going debate: the effect on the whole
fabric of ethics and society. On "Night
line," one of the involved doctors showed
an admirable openness to this maturing
process.
2. In the Memorial Church affair,
those who chided Angel Puerta saw only
one side of religion (e.g. Christianity):
the universal love and forgiveness. But
religion, like a good individual parent,

establishes limits ("Thou shalt not"),
the transgression of which entails
painful consequences. The forgiveness
comes later.
Homosexuality en masse threatens
the institution which Janet Reno, as she
stated on the "MacNeil/Lehrer News
Hour," sees as the bulwark against the
horrendous social disorders of our time,
especially juvenile crime (she recom
mends the "old-fashioned way" of bring
ing up children). Hence the churches
tend not to condone it through official
acts (such as a ceremony of mock mar
riage), even though they forgive. A
mature mind grasps both sides.
3. In the Webb Ranch controversy,
youthful morals do not always see the
"other side" involved in advanced
achievement. All of us who survived past
adolescence were aghast at the amount
of dirt we had to swallow to get along.
Not only did the Utopian aspiration to
raise everybody to prosperity, through
Communism or socialism, blow up in
front of our faces, but even in our indi

vidual lives we discovered our "feet of
clay": we sinned and erred in our turn.
But we discovered too that you could try
to atone, variously, by working hard,
raising our families well, suffering
through achievement and forgiveness: a
sort of "muddling through" between our
juvenile ideals and our later realism. If
the tone is modest enough, one might
call it "wisdom." It is not wise to call our
president "callous and even immoral"
for trying to deal with the double exigen
cy of decency and survival of his institu
tion in a very real world.
4. Finally, there is the blockbuster
issue of health care. The Clintons are
"hung up" on one side of the question:
universal security. They tend to ignore,
massively, childishly, and demagogically,
the whole other side: individual respon
sibility. They say they will not even dis
cuss ("negotiate") the aim of universal
coverage at a quite high level of quality.
But just as a good parent teaches his
or her child that if you take certain risks
— whether courting mere pleasure or

glory — you must pay if you fail and not
expect your ant-like neighbors to pick up
your grasshopper's extravagant tab —
though in a civilized order they will help
you get up and comfort you, somewhat
reproachfully — so, in a huge nation like
ours, it is wrong to expect the taxpayer
to foot the main bill for the disorders of
smokers, other gamblers with their
health and general improvidents. For
give and comfort them, yes: particularly
for those who suffer undeservedly, there
should be assistance. And even for the
profligate, there are and will be safety
nets: perhaps new community clinics to
take the pressure off emergency rooms,
staffed at a somewhat lower level of
quality, with some interns or paramedics
(there must be some encouragement to
shape up).
The biggest danger of the Clinton
plan is the near monopoly of power, in
this mqjor realm, a new form of socialist
statism. Is that wise?
