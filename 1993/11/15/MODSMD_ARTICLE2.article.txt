# Domino's to take Tresidder Dollars
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Editorial staff 
Tresidder Union completed a verbal
agreement Friday with a local Domino's
Pizza franchise that will allow students
to purchase pizza with Tresidder Dol
lars, according to Tresidder Assoc. Direc
tor Paul Szczesiul.
"We just have to figure out how the
hardware and the equipment will be
worked out," Szczesiul said of the agree
ment, which goes into efTect Jan. 3.
The franchise, which is in Palo Alto,
will lease from Tresidder the electronic

equipment necessary to run the system.
Szczesiul said Tresidder would get "a
small percentage" of the profits — taken
when Domino's comes once a week to col
lect the money debited by the Tresidder
Dollar system — but only enough to op
erate the computer system.
Szczesiul said the agreement should
not cost Tresidder any money because its
Tresidder Dollar system is already set
up, and most of the work will come from
Domino's side.
"I think it will be a good service for
students," he said. "In addition to Taco
Bell, students will have another late

night option." Tresidder recently com
pleted a deal with Taco Bell for an in
house franchise that may be set up as
early as winter quarter.
Also, since Tresidder does not deliver
pizza, the Domino's service will not di
rectly compete with Tresidder.
Szczesiul said he approached Domi
no's management several weeks ago
with the idea. "It's worked at other
schools like George Washington (Uni
versity) and Arizona State, which has a
Pizza Hut in-house," he said. However,
he said probably less than 10 uni
versities around the country have
such an agreement.
David Midlik, who owns the
local Domino's, said it will cost
about $1,000 to $1,200 total to
lease the equipment, but the agree
ment is worth the investment.
"I've looked at it from all angles,
and it's a real plus," he said.
However, he added that he did
not expect Domino's pizza sales
— which are currently 35 percent
to 40 percent from Stanford — to
increase significantly as a result
of the new system.

"I don't think we're going to
have a big sales boom, maybe just
a little increase," Midlik said.
"The main thing is the conve
nience."
And why not Pizza Hut? Szcze
siul said he just picked the pizza
chain that was most popular
among students. Last spring, he
said, several business school stu
dents conducted a survey that
looked at pizza delivery in the
area, and "Domino's was the No.
1 choice."
Szczesiul said Tresidder has a
number of similar projects —
potential deals with other nation
al or regional franchises — in the
works, but he declined to identify
any of them.
