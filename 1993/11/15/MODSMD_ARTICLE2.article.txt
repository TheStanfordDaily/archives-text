# Domino's to take Tresidder Dollars
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Editorial staff 
Tresidder Union completed a verbal
agreement Friday with a local Domino's
Pizza franchise that will allow students
to purchase pizza with Tresidder Dol
lars, according to Tresidder Assoc. Direc
tor Paul Szczesiul.
"We just have to figure out how the
hardware and the equipment will be
worked out," Szczesiul said of the agree
ment, which goes into efTect Jan. 3.
The franchise, which is in Palo Alto,
will lease from Tresidder the electronic

equipment necessary to run the system.
Szczesiul said Tresidder would get "a
small percentage" of the profits — taken
when Domino's comes once a week to col
lect the money debited by the Tresidder
Dollar system — but only enough to op
erate the computer system.
Szczesiul said the agreement should
not cost Tresidder any money because its
Tresidder Dollar system is already set
up, and most of the work will come from
Domino's side.
"I think it will be a good service for
students," he said. "In addition to Taco
Bell, students will have another late

night option." Tresidder recently com
pleted a deal with Taco Bell for an in
house franchise that may be set up as
early as winter quarter.
Also, since Tresidder does not deliver
pizza, the Domino's service will not di
rectly compete with Tresidder.
Szczesiul said he approached Domi
no's management several weeks ago
with the idea. "It's worked at other
schools like George Washington (Uni
versity) and Arizona State, which has a
Pizza Hut in-house," he said. However,
