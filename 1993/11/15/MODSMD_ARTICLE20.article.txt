## Women's cross country off to Penn. tournament 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
They ran hard all year, and now they've final
ly reached Pennsylvania.
The sixth-ranked Stanford women's cross
country team captured second place in the Dis
trict-8 Championships at Portland University on
Saturday. The performance gave the Cardinal an
automatic berth in the NCAA Championships at
Lehigh University, to be held on Nov. 22.
Only the top two teams from each of the
nation's eight districts qualify automatically for
the NCAAs. While the women met this require
ment, the 23rd-ranked Stanford men did not, fin
ishing fifth in their competition. Nonetheless,
Cardinal cross country had much to be excited
about this weekend.
Although the women's District-8 race fea
tured 17 Division I teams from Hawaii, Washing
ton, Oregon and California, it boiled down to a
close Pacific 10 Conference meet. District cham
pion Arizona barely edged Stanford 59-65, while
No. 16 Oregon, No. 14 UCLA and Washington
rounded out the top five with scores of 74, 88 and
112 respectively.
Individually, Bruins junior Karen Hecox, the
Pac-10 champion, was again the first to cross the
finish line. As in the Pac-10 race, UCLA had high
finishes from Hecox and senior teammate Beth
Bartholomew, who came in second
Saturday. However, as always, the
Cardinal obtained their success
through team running. Stanford's
top five women all finished within
18 seconds of one another. Senior
Louise Watson led the way with an
eighth-place performance, while
senior captain Sarah Truitt, fresh
man Monal Chokshi, junior
Stephanie Jensen and freshman
Ann Sheehy came in at 11th, 13th,
15th and 18th respectively.
"We ran brilliantly," said head
coach Vin Lananna. "Our pack
moved up throughout the race. We
came to Portland to qualify for
NCAAs and accomplished that
goal. I couldn't be more proud of
these great athletes."
Truitt and Watson expressed
excitement about going to NCAAs,
but like their coach, they too felt
that the real story was the team's

composure and focus.
"It was a tough race," Truitt
said. "From the sidelines, the Stan
ford fans thought we were winning,
but we knew we weren't. There
were Arizona and Oregon women
everywhere. So everyone tried to
make a difference in the end of the
race. Monal made up about seven
points in the last 800 meters or so."
"The race started out kind of
slow and then a pack of runners
broke off into the front," Watson
said. "I went with them and was
able to stay with them for a while.
But I slipped off after two miles and
thought, 'Oh no, there goes nation
als.' But then I saw the team
behind me and that kept me going."
On the men's side, except for the
No. 6 Portland Pilots, whose 56-
point total secured the district
crown among a 14-team field, the
Pac-10 teams likewise dominated.
Conference champion Washington
captured second place with 71
points, while the No. 16 Ducks, No.
15 Washington State and the Car
dinal followed with respective

scores of 76, 97 and 119.
For the men, Washington State
essentially mirrored the UCLA
women's strong-individual-but
poor-team showing. Cougar senior
and Pac-10 champion Josephat
Kapkory captured the district title,
while his teammate, sophomore
Pat Muturi, came in third, only to
see their team place fourth.
The Stanford men's perfor
mance also resembled that of the
Bruin women. All-American cap
tain Gary Stolz, achilles tendonitis
and all, summoned up a lOth-place
performance, while freshman
standout Greg Jimmerson followed
right behind him in 11th place.
Unfortunately, Stanford's next
three runners placed well behind.
Freshman J.J. White, senior Todd
Lewis and freshman Andy Cowgill
came in 28th, 30th and 43rd respec
tively.
"By and large, the men ran as
well as they could have," Lananna
said. "We were out conservatively
and moved up throughout. I am
very proud of this team."
