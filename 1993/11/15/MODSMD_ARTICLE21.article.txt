# Spikers sweep Oregon teams

### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
With the end of its regular season now in clear
view, the Stanford women's volleyball team picked
up an added boost of confidence this weekend â€” not
to mention two more Pacific 10 Conference wins.
The No. 6 Cardinal (19-5, 12-4 in the Pac-10)
completed its final contests against the Oregon
teams this weekend, racking up two more matches'
worth of competitive experience before the postsea
son. After sweeping Oregon (4-21, 1-16 in the Pac
-10) on Friday night, the Cardinal overpowered Ore
gon State (15-12, 7-10 in the Pac-10) in four games
the following evening.
"I'm very happy with the way we played," said
sophomore Cary Wendell. "We were loose and
aggressive for the most part. It was fun going out
there and playing with confidence."
The Cardinal's confident attitude contributed to
a speedy match in Eugene. While the Ducks took the
first two points, that proved to be the extent of their
lead as Stanford tied at 2-2, then powered ahead to
an eventual 15-6 win.
While the Ducks managed to keep pace with Stan
ford for a little longer in game two, Stanford pulled
out of a 4-4 tie, scoring four straight points. Virtual
ly unstoppable for the rest of the game, the Cardinal
secured game two by a 15-8 margin. Stanford fin
ished off the match with a 15-12 game-three victory.
"We played very solidly and were pretty much in
control all the way through," said coach Don Shaw.
One of the keys to the Cardinal's solid play was its
effective coverage at the net. Stanford racked up 16
team blocks in 129 Oregon attacks to surpass its goal
of one block for every ten opponent attacks. Fresh
man Nikki Otto led the effort with a season- and
match-high nine blocks while Wendell added six
stuffs.
Sophomore outside hitter Marnie Triefenbach
spearheaded the Cardinal offensive effort, slamming
down a match-high 14 kills. Wendell was also a
mj\jor contributor to the Stanford attack, adding 11
kills. Staging a much more consistent effort com
pared to their matches earlier in the season, Stan
ford finished with 14 attack errors to Oregon's 29.
"We came out with very few unforced hitting
errors," Shaw said. "I think that's been characteris
tic of this team over the past six or so matches, it's
something we've gotten going
pretty well."
While Cardinal's offensive
onslaught was challenged the next
night by a more formidable oppo
nent, Stanford withstood the pres
sure. After an easy 15-3 victory in
game one, the Cardinal slipped
behind in the second game to fall
to a narrow 14-16 defeat.
"We went out and pretty much
blew them away in the first game,"
Wendell said. "We slowed down at
the start of the second game and
by the time we turned it back on it
was a little late."
The Cardinal reasserted itself
in the final two games, however,
taking the third contest 15-11 and
finishing the weekend with a 15-5
game-four victory.
"We did a good job of coming

back and getting the momentum
going again," Shaw said.
Once again, Wendell and
Triefenbach led the Cardinal
offense, while sophomore Wendy
Hromadka entered the contest to
boost the attack. Otto and junior
Anne Wicks maintained the pres
sure in the middle with eight and
nine kills, respectively. Wicks also
led the Stanford defense with nine
blocks.
"We sided out really well and
fought hard so we didn't give up
any long strings of points," said
senior tri-captain Heidi Eick. "We
had one rotation that really broke
down in game two but after that,
we concentrated on what we need
ed to do."
Siding-out, and thereby regain
ing service of the ball, has been a
skill which the Cardinal has spent
much of the season trying to
improve.
"We're getting a lot better at
not digging ourselves in a hole and

letting the other team get six or
seven points," Wendell said. "Now
we're siding-out before that hap
pens."
After more than a week of rest
since its last matches, the quality
of the Cardinal's game did not slip.
Instead, the respite served to reju
venate the team.
"We didn't have any ill-effects
from not playing," Shaw said. "We
had so many matches that we real
ly needed a rest, but it wasn't such
a long break that we suffered any."
The Cardinal will be gearing up
for its two final Pac-10 matches
against No. 13 USC and No. 1
UCLA on Thursday and Friday
nights in Maples Pavilion. Stan
ford looks to avenge earlier losses
to both teams. The USC match
will also be an important factor in
determining the Cardinal's final
rankings going into the NCAA
tournament, as both teams are
vying for a top-four seed in the
Western region.
