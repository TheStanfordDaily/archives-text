With the end of its regular season now in clear
view, the Stanford women's volleyball team picked
up an added boost of confidence this weekend â€” not
to mention two more Pacific 10 Conference wins.
The No. 6 Cardinal (19-5, 12-4 in the Pac-10)
completed its final contests against the Oregon
teams this weekend, racking up two more matches'
worth of competitive experience before the postsea
son. After sweeping Oregon (4-21, 1-16 in the Pac
-10) on Friday night, the Cardinal overpowered Ore
gon State (15-12, 7-10 in the Pac-10) in four games
the following evening.
"I'm very happy with the way we played," said
sophomore Cary Wendell. "We were loose and
aggressive for the most part. It was fun going out
there and playing with confidence."
The Cardinal's confident attitude contributed to
a speedy match in Eugene. While the Ducks took the
first two points, that proved to be the extent of their
lead as Stanford tied at 2-2, then powered ahead to
an eventual 15-6 win.
While the Ducks managed to keep pace with Stan
ford for a little longer in game two, Stanford pulled
out of a 4-4 tie, scoring four straight points. Virtual
ly unstoppable for the rest of the game, the Cardinal
secured game two by a 15-8 margin. Stanford fin
ished off the match with a 15-12 game-three victory.
"We played very solidly and were pretty much in
control all the way through," said coach Don Shaw.
One of the keys to the Cardinal's solid play was its
effective coverage at the net. Stanford racked up 16
team blocks in 129 Oregon attacks to surpass its goal
of one block for every ten opponent attacks. Fresh
man Nikki Otto led the effort with a season- and
match-high nine blocks while Wendell added six
stuffs.
Sophomore outside hitter Marnie Triefenbach
spearheaded the Cardinal offensive effort, slamming
down a match-high 14 kills. Wendell was also a
mj\jor contributor to the Stanford attack, adding 11
kills. Staging a much more consistent effort com
pared to their matches earlier in the season, Stan
ford finished with 14 attack errors to Oregon's 29.
"We came out with very few unforced hitting
errors," Shaw said. "I think that's been characteris
tic of this team over the past six or so matches, it's
