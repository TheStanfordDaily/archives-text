# Finally: it's the Final Four
## Women's soccer ends frustration, wins Regional 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
And then there were four.
No. 2 Stanford (18-2-1) ad
vanced to the NCAA Women's Soc
cer Final Four by knocking off Cal
ifornia 2-0 in the Western Regional
semifinals on Saturday and the
University of Portland 1-0 in the
final on Sunday at Maloney Field.
After being held scoreless in the
first halves of both games, the Car
dinal's fortunes turned in second
half action, as Stanford successful
ly converted three goal-scoring op
portunities. Sarah Rafanelli sc
ored both goals against the Bears,
with Carmel Murphy finding the
net against the Pilots.
"It's a great feeling knowing
that we're going to the Final
Four," Rafanelli said. "I'm ecstatic.
This is a huge step for us. We made
history by winning this [Portland)
game, and I'm excited that (we
were) able to do it while I was still
here, because this was my last
chance."
After losing in the Western
Regional final for two consecutive
years, Stanford finally broke

through to victory and will be
going to its first Final Four.
"I'm numb," said head coach
lan Sawyers. "I spent all my emo
tional energy on the field."
Murphy, a sophomore midfield
er, scored the lone goal against
Portland 11 minutes into the sec
ond half. Capitalizing on a Pilot
defensive breakdown, Erin Martin
stole the ball from a Portland
defender and passed the ball to
Emily Burt. After a Pilot defender
failed to clear the ball, Burt found
an onrushing Murphy with a cen
tering pass. Murphy then lofted
the ball into the top of the net.
"The defender tried to clear it,
but I got in front of her," Burt said.
"Smurf IMurphyl was coming in,
and I let her take the shot."
After being outhustled in the
first half by the Pilots (16-4-1),
Stanford turned the momentum of
the game around in the second half
by pounding the ball downfield, let
ting Martin and Rafanelli collect
the passes and get into scoring
position.
"They ICardinal defenders] just
kicked the ball clear as soon as they
got it," said Portland forward

Shannon MacMillan. "It doesn't
give our forwards a chance to chase
it down. It's frustrating every time
you're chasing it down, and each
time you get within a foot of it, it
goes flying by your head."
Although the "kick and run"
defense was unplanned, Sawyers
was certainly happy with the way it
turned out. "We planned to possess
the ball defensively a little longer,
but sometimes when the ball's
dangerous you have to get rid of it
quicker than you wanted to,"
Sawyers said.
Overall, the Stanford defense
did an exceptional job shutting
down MacMillan, the nation's top
scorer. Assigned to mark MacMil
lan for the game, freshman Suzie
Boots limited her to only two shots
on goal.
"Suzie did a tremendous job on
one of the best players in the coun
try, Shannon MacMillan," Sawyers
said. "All our defensive line did a
great job. When we were struggling
during the first half, they were the
rock that kept us together."
In the first half, Portland played
more aggressively than the Cardi
nal, chasing down loose balls in the
midfield and out-muscling the
smaller Stanford team. The Pilots
mustered seven shots on goal in the
first half, almost twice as many as
Stanford allowed Cal during the
entire game Saturday. However,
the Cardinal defense clamped
down in the second half, limiting
the Pilots to three shots on goal.
"We needed to increase the
tempo of the game and the speed of
play and increase our defensive
intensity because they were over
matching us," Sawyers said. "I had
to be on the refs more than I nor
mally am to protect our players,
because Portland is so physical."
Despite the occasional question
able pushing and shoving, Stanford
kept its intensity throughout the
game. A cornerstone of the Cardi
nal defense, goalkeper Leslie Gar
rard recorded two more shutouts,
giving her 17 for the year and drop
ping her goals-against average to a
miniscule .33.
In Saturday's game, a focused
Cardinal team used precision pass
ing and suffocating defense to dom
inate the Golden Bears (10-4-4).
Rafanelli, a senior forward, used

her excellent positioning and blind
ing speed to pace the Stanford
attack. Her two goals against Cai
gave her 20 for the season, bringing
her season point total to 48. Her
first goal came four minutes into
the second half when Kyla
Schmedding, the Cal goalkeeper,
deflected a shot by Carmel Mur
phy. Erin Martin collected the
errant ball and found Rafanelli,
who fired the ball into an open net.
"My role there was to get the
ball back in near the goal," Murphy
said. "If the ball is coming out, I
just need to get anything on it so it
gets back in there. If it ricochets off
someone and goes in, that's great."
The second goal of the game was
vintage Rafanelli. With just seven
minutes left in the game, Stan
ford's high pressure paid off, as
Rafanelli stole the ball from a Cal
defender near midfield and raced
toward the goal. Luring Schmed
ding out of the goal, Rafanelli fired
the ball into the net for the score.
Cal's offense faced adversity
from both the Stanford defensive
line and from the loss of top-scor
ing forward Erika Hinton, who
went down with a knee injury early
in the first half. Although she
returned to the lineup in the sec
ond half, she left after only seven
minutes of play and did not return.
The Golden Bear offense never got
on track, mustering only four shots

on goal for the game compared to
Stanford's 17 shots.
"I think our concept of team
defense is the key," Sawyers said.
"It starts from up front, and hope
fully they do a great job, which
makes the midfielders' job easier.
Eventually, if the ball gets to the
back line, it's such a difficult
chance that they may not be able to
take the shot. "
Joining Stanford in the Final
Four are No. 1 North Carolina (21-
0), No. 5 Massachusetts (17-2-3)
and No. 13 George Mason (18-2-1).
The Cardinal will face George
Mason in the national semifinals,
with the Tar Heels playing the
Minutemen. The semifinals will
take place Friday, Nov. 19, with the
championship game on Sunday,
Nov. 21. One of the four participat
ing schools will host the Final
Four, with the site to be deter
mined Monday.
"I spoke to ISenior Assistant
Athletic Director] Cheryl ILevickJ
and she said she's going to make a
strong bid for it, but obviously
there are a lot of things going
against us," Sawyers said.
Working aginst the Cardinal's
bid is Big Game, which takes place
at Stanford next Saturday. The
NCAA may not want to have the
Final Four at the site of such a
large athletic spectacle as the Cal-
Stanford rivalry.

time you get within a foot of it, it
goes flying by your head."
Although the "kick and run"
defense was unplanned, Sawyers
was certainly happy with the way it
turned out. "We planned to possess
the ball defensively a little longer,
but sometimes when the ball's
dangerous you have to get rid of it
quicker than you wanted to,"
Sawyers said.
Overall, the Stanford defense
did an exceptional job shutting
down MacMillan, the nation's top
scorer. Assigned to mark MacMil
lan for the game, freshman Suzie
Boots limited her to only two shots
on goal.
"Suzie did a tremendous job on
one of the best players in the coun
try, Shannon MacMillan," Sawyers
said. "All our defensive line did a
great job. When we were struggling
during the first half, they were the
rock that kept us together."
In the first half, Portland played
more aggressively than the Cardi
nal, chasing down loose balls in the
midfield and out-muscling the
smaller Stanford team. The Pilots
mustered seven shots on goal in the
first half, almost twice as many as
Stanford allowed Cal during the
entire game Saturday. However,
the Cardinal defense clamped
down in the second half, limiting
the Pilots to three shots on goal.
"We needed to increase the
tempo of the game and the speed of
play and increase our defensive
intensity because they were over
matching us," Sawyers said. "I had
to be on the refs more than I nor
mally am to protect our players,
because Portland is so physical."
Despite the occasional question
able pushing and shoving, Stanford
kept its intensity throughout the
game. A cornerstone of the Cardi
nal defense, goalkeper Leslie Gar
rard recorded two more shutouts,
giving her 17 for the year and drop
ping her goals-against average to a
miniscule .33.
In Saturday's game, a focused
Cardinal team used precision pass
ing and suffocating defense to dom
inate the Golden Bears (10-4-4).
Rafanelli, a senior forward, used

her excellent positioning and blind
ing speed to pace the Stanford
attack. Her two goals against Cai
gave her 20 for the season, bringing
her season point total to 48. Her
first goal came four minutes into
the second half when Kyla
Schmedding, the Cal goalkeeper,
deflected a shot by Carmel Mur
phy. Erin Martin collected the
errant ball and found Rafanelli,
who fired the ball into an open net.
"My role there was to get the
ball back in near the goal," Murphy
said. "If the ball is coming out, I
just need to get anything on it so it
gets back in there. If it ricochets off
someone and goes in, that's great."
The second goal of the game was
vintage Rafanelli. With just seven
minutes left in the game, Stan
ford's high pressure paid off, as
Rafanelli stole the ball from a Cal
defender near midfield and raced
toward the goal. Luring Schmed
ding out of the goal, Rafanelli fired
the ball into the net for the score.
Cal's offense faced adversity
from both the Stanford defensive
line and from the loss of top-scor
ing forward Erika Hinton, who
went down with a knee injury early
in the first half. Although she
returned to the lineup in the sec
ond half, she left after only seven
minutes of play and did not return.
The Golden Bear offense never got
on track, mustering only four shots

on goal for the game compared to
Stanford's 17 shots.
"I think our concept of team
defense is the key," Sawyers said.
"It starts from up front, and hope
fully they do a great job, which
makes the midfielders' job easier.
Eventually, if the ball gets to the
back line, it's such a difficult
chance that they may not be able to
take the shot. "
Joining Stanford in the Final
Four are No. 1 North Carolina (21-
0), No. 5 Massachusetts (17-2-3)
and No. 13 George Mason (18-2-1).
The Cardinal will face George
Mason in the national semifinals,
with the Tar Heels playing the
Minutemen. The semifinals will
take place Friday, Nov. 19, with the
championship game on Sunday,
Nov. 21. One of the four participat
ing schools will host the Final
Four, with the site to be deter
mined Monday.
"I spoke to ISenior Assistant
Athletic Director] Cheryl ILevickJ
and she said she's going to make a
strong bid for it, but obviously
there are a lot of things going
against us," Sawyers said.
Working aginst the Cardinal's
bid is Big Game, which takes place
at Stanford next Saturday. The
NCAA may not want to have the
Final Four at the site of such a
large athletic spectacle as the Cal-
Stanford rivalry.
And then there were four.
No. 2 Stanford (18-2-1) ad
vanced to the NCAA Women's Soc
cer Final Four by knocking off Cal
ifornia 2-0 in the Western Regional
semifinals on Saturday and the
University of Portland 1-0 in the
final on Sunday at Maloney Field.
After being held scoreless in the
first halves of both games, the Car
dinal's fortunes turned in second
half action, as Stanford successful
ly converted three goal-scoring op
portunities. Sarah Rafanelli sc
ored both goals against the Bears,
with Carmel Murphy finding the
net against the Pilots.
"It's a great feeling knowing
that we're going to the Final
Four," Rafanelli said. "I'm ecstatic.
This is a huge step for us. We made
history by winning this [Portland)
game, and I'm excited that (we
were) able to do it while I was still
here, because this was my last
chance."
After losing in the Western
Regional final for two consecutive
years, Stanford finally broke

through to victory and will be
going to its first Final Four.
"I'm numb," said head coach
lan Sawyers. "I spent all my emo
tional energy on the field."
Murphy, a sophomore midfield
er, scored the lone goal against
Portland 11 minutes into the sec
ond half. Capitalizing on a Pilot
defensive breakdown, Erin Martin
stole the ball from a Portland
defender and passed the ball to
Emily Burt. After a Pilot defender
failed to clear the ball, Burt found
an onrushing Murphy with a cen
tering pass. Murphy then lofted
the ball into the top of the net.
"The defender tried to clear it,
but I got in front of her," Burt said.
"Smurf IMurphyl was coming in,
and I let her take the shot."
After being outhustled in the
first half by the Pilots (16-4-1),
Stanford turned the momentum of
the game around in the second half
by pounding the ball downfield, let
ting Martin and Rafanelli collect
the passes and get into scoring
position.
"They ICardinal defenders] just
kicked the ball clear as soon as they
got it," said Portland forward

Shannon MacMillan. "It doesn't
give our forwards a chance to chase
it down. It's frustrating every time
you're chasing it down, and each
