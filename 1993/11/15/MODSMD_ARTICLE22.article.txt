And then there were four.
No. 2 Stanford (18-2-1) ad
vanced to the NCAA Women's Soc
cer Final Four by knocking off Cal
ifornia 2-0 in the Western Regional
semifinals on Saturday and the
University of Portland 1-0 in the
final on Sunday at Maloney Field.
After being held scoreless in the
first halves of both games, the Car
dinal's fortunes turned in second
half action, as Stanford successful
ly converted three goal-scoring op
portunities. Sarah Rafanelli sc
ored both goals against the Bears,
with Carmel Murphy finding the
net against the Pilots.
"It's a great feeling knowing
that we're going to the Final
Four," Rafanelli said. "I'm ecstatic.
This is a huge step for us. We made
history by winning this [Portland)
game, and I'm excited that (we
were) able to do it while I was still
here, because this was my last
chance."
After losing in the Western
Regional final for two consecutive
years, Stanford finally broke

through to victory and will be
going to its first Final Four.
"I'm numb," said head coach
lan Sawyers. "I spent all my emo
tional energy on the field."
Murphy, a sophomore midfield
er, scored the lone goal against
Portland 11 minutes into the sec
ond half. Capitalizing on a Pilot
defensive breakdown, Erin Martin
stole the ball from a Portland
defender and passed the ball to
Emily Burt. After a Pilot defender
failed to clear the ball, Burt found
an onrushing Murphy with a cen
tering pass. Murphy then lofted
the ball into the top of the net.
"The defender tried to clear it,
but I got in front of her," Burt said.
"Smurf IMurphyl was coming in,
and I let her take the shot."
After being outhustled in the
first half by the Pilots (16-4-1),
Stanford turned the momentum of
the game around in the second half
by pounding the ball downfield, let
ting Martin and Rafanelli collect
the passes and get into scoring
position.
"They ICardinal defenders] just
kicked the ball clear as soon as they
got it," said Portland forward

Shannon MacMillan. "It doesn't
give our forwards a chance to chase
it down. It's frustrating every time
you're chasing it down, and each
time you get within a foot of it, it
goes flying by your head."
Although the "kick and run"
defense was unplanned, Sawyers
was certainly happy with the way it
turned out. "We planned to possess
the ball defensively a little longer,
but sometimes when the ball's
dangerous you have to get rid of it
quicker than you wanted to,"
Sawyers said.
Overall, the Stanford defense
did an exceptional job shutting
down MacMillan, the nation's top
scorer. Assigned to mark MacMil
lan for the game, freshman Suzie
Boots limited her to only two shots
on goal.
"Suzie did a tremendous job on
one of the best players in the coun
try, Shannon MacMillan," Sawyers
said. "All our defensive line did a
great job. When we were struggling
during the first half, they were the
rock that kept us together."
In the first half, Portland played
