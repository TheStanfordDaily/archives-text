# Stanford and Stenstrom down Ducks, 38-34
## Quarterback passes Elway as the Pac-10 yardage king in Cardinal victory

EUGENE, Ore. — As the fans piled out of chilly
Autzen Stadium late Saturday afternoon, Oregon pub
lic address announcer Don Essig commented into the
loudspeaker, "Well, it wasn't boring."
It certainly wasn't.
A record-setting day by Stanford quarterback Steve
Stenstrom was nearly overshadowed as the Cardinal
squandered a 38-16 lead in the fourth quarter, but

hung on to beat the Ducks, 38-34.
Oregon (5-5, 2-5 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
scored three touchdowns in the final 8:33, but three
missed two-point conversion attempts and two failed
onsides kicks proved to be the slim margin that
allowed Stanford (5-4, 2-4) to escape.
"We just can't win the game the natural way," said
Stanford head coach Bill Walsh. "It has to be a crazy
way. We stopped the two-point plays somehow and
that kept us going."
For most of the day, it was Stenstrom's passing

that kept the Cardinal going — and the Oregon sec
ondary perplexed. The quarterback completed 28 of
37 passes for 407 yards and three touchdowns with
out an interception. The numbers brought his sea
son passing yardage total to 3,281, breaking the Pac
-10 and school record of 3,242 set by John Elway in
1982. Stenstrom also set a new school mark for sea
son completions (273), and is on a pace to shatter
several additional records in the upcoming Big Game
against California.
"It's a great honor," Stenstrom said. "John Elway is
a guy who I grew up watching play. When I came to
Stanford, his numbers seemed so impressive and
insurmountable."
Stenstrom got help, for a change, from the Cardinal
running game. Ethan Allen started at tailback and,
despite a hip-pointer, gained 82 yards. From the full
back slot, freshman Greg Cornelia ran for a touchdown
and caught another in his first collegiate start.
"It seemed like we were really moving the ball well,"
Allen said.
In a spurt that started with the five-yard touch
down pass to Cornelia at the beginning of the second
quarter and ended with a 40-yard strike to receiver
Mark Harris with four minutes left in the third quar
ter, Stenstrom completed 16 straight passes, including
all three of his touchdown throws.
"He was so accurate today," said Stanford offensive
coordinator Terry Shea. "On a lot of his passes he had
progressed to his second or third wide receiver. You
don't see that very often at the college level."
"It's tough to cover guys when he's that precise
with his passes," commented Oregon strong safety
Chad Cota, who spoke from first-hand experience.
In that time span, Stenstrom had his way with the
Ducks' secondary. With Oregon's defensive front
inclined to blitz, Stanford's receivers enjoyed one-on
one coverage. Harris was Stenstrom's favorite target
(catching 12 passes for 189 yards), and for the first
time this season, was used in the game at the same
time as receiver Justin Armour (four catches for 84
yards).
"I felt like I got into a pretty good rhythm there, and
Steve was throwing it right on the money," Harris
said. "The play-calling today was incredible. It felt like
we were exploiting their weaknesses on every play."
lin the second half, Oregon began its comeback
from a 17-3 halftime deficit. Behind the arm of junior
quarterback Danny O'Neil, who hit 31 of 44 passes for
386 yards and four touchdowns, the Ducks closed the

Quarterback Steve Stenstrom sets up to fire another pass. On the season, Stenstrom has thrown for
3,281 yards, including a 407-yard performance against Oregon on Saturday.
