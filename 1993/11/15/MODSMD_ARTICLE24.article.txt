# Men's swimming team dunks Longhorn squad
## Battle of the two top-ranked teams no contest as Stanford cruises, 160-83 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
The highly-touted men's swim
ming battle pitting the nation's
top two teams against each other
turned out to be a mere shellack
ing, as No. 1 Stanford drowned
No. 2 Texas Saturday 160-83 in a
deluge of downed deGuerre pool
records.
Someone should tell the swim
squad that it is only November —
they are already performing like a
typical February Stanford men's
swimming team. In the Cardinal's
first dual meet of the year, back
stroker Derek Weatherford, the
defending NCAA champion in the
100 meter backstroke, qualified
for the NCAA tournament in the
200 back and set a new pool record
with a time of 1:43.82.
As if that was not enough to
start ofT the season with a bang,
Weatherford also broke the
deGuerre record in the 200 IM by
completing the medley in 1:48.48.
"I wasn't expecting to do this
well," Weatherford said. "We were
just excited to swim against Texas.
We wanted to set the tone early
and make sure that no other team
thinks that they can beat us."
The Longhorns could barely
keep their heads above water, as

the Cardinal won all but two of the
13 events and the Longhorns
managed to gain more points than
Stanford in only the 1,000 free
style.
"We had a great day," said Car
dinal coach Skip Kenney. "I don't
think that we've ever swum this
fast in November. I couldn't be
more excited about this team and
where we are right now."
The first event of the afternoon
set the tone for the entire meet.
Stanford's top 400 medley relay
team left Texas' number-one four
some in its wake, defeating the
Longhorns by more than three
seconds. The team of Weather
ford, Tyler Mayfield, Clay Tippins
and Brian Retterer helped the
Cardinal jump out to a quick 15-2
lead.
Stanford sophomore freestyler
Joe Hudepohl placed first in all
three of his events. He squeaked
by with a win in the 100 free, and
then flushed his opponents in the
200 free by nearly two seconds.
"This was really what I was
looking for," said Hudepohl, who
is ranked second in the 100 m free,
seventh in the 200 m free and
eighth in the 50 free nationally. "I
had high expectations, and we
