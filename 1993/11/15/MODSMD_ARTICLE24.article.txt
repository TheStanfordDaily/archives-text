# Men's swimming team dunks Longhorn squad
## Battle of the two top-ranked teams no contest as Stanford cruises, 160-83 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
The highly-touted men's swim
ming battle pitting the nation's
top two teams against each other
turned out to be a mere shellack
ing, as No. 1 Stanford drowned
No. 2 Texas Saturday 160-83 in a
deluge of downed deGuerre pool
records.
Someone should tell the swim
squad that it is only November —
they are already performing like a
typical February Stanford men's
swimming team. In the Cardinal's
first dual meet of the year, back
stroker Derek Weatherford, the
defending NCAA champion in the
100 meter backstroke, qualified
for the NCAA tournament in the
200 back and set a new pool record
with a time of 1:43.82.
As if that was not enough to
start ofT the season with a bang,
Weatherford also broke the
deGuerre record in the 200 IM by
completing the medley in 1:48.48.
"I wasn't expecting to do this
well," Weatherford said. "We were
just excited to swim against Texas.
We wanted to set the tone early
and make sure that no other team
thinks that they can beat us."
The Longhorns could barely
keep their heads above water, as

the Cardinal won all but two of the
13 events and the Longhorns
managed to gain more points than
Stanford in only the 1,000 free
style.
"We had a great day," said Car
dinal coach Skip Kenney. "I don't
think that we've ever swum this
fast in November. I couldn't be
more excited about this team and
where we are right now."
The first event of the afternoon
set the tone for the entire meet.
Stanford's top 400 medley relay
team left Texas' number-one four
some in its wake, defeating the
Longhorns by more than three
seconds. The team of Weather
ford, Tyler Mayfield, Clay Tippins
and Brian Retterer helped the
Cardinal jump out to a quick 15-2
lead.
Stanford sophomore freestyler
Joe Hudepohl placed first in all
three of his events. He squeaked
by with a win in the 100 free, and
then flushed his opponents in the
200 free by nearly two seconds.
"This was really what I was
looking for," said Hudepohl, who
is ranked second in the 100 m free,
seventh in the 200 m free and
eighth in the 50 free nationally. "I
had high expectations, and we

really wanted to prove something
in the preseason."
There is little more evidence
that the Cardinal can produce that
would more persuasively get their
point across.
"If we can handle No. 2 this easy
we're going to be able to handle any
other college team beneath us,"
said Weatherford.
In winning the 200 back,
Weatherford defeated Texas' Brad

Bridgewater, who finished fourth
in both the 100 and 200 backs a
year ago.
In the 200 free, a race that pit
ted defending Texas' NCAA cham
pion Josh Davis against Hudepohl,
last year's runner-up, Hudepohl
was avenged as he blew by Davis
and won easily.
Stanford led 147-79 when the final
event of the day rolled around — the
400 free relay, a race that would serve
only as bragging rights to the winning
team. The Cardinal's A squad (Retter
er, Hudepohl, Tippins and Bill Schell)
beat the Longhorns' top team to wrap
up what was certainty an all-Stanford

affair.
"This is the best team effort I've
ever seen," said Hudepohl. "They
are talking about this being one of
the best teams ever, and we just
took a big step in proving that."
The high quality of Stanford's
swimming is a pleasant surprise to
Kenney, who had made some
adjustments in the Cardinal train
ing philosophy.
"We're not sprinting as much
yet so our pyramid can be higher
when March rolls around," said
Kenney. "We've come back to the
basics in training. We wanted to
build that base back up."

The Cardinal continued their dom
inance in the pool on Sunday, soundly
defeating Fresno State in Southern
California 123-68. Tippins won both
the 200 free and the 100 fly to lead
Stanford in winning nine of the 11
events. The 400 m relay team won
again, while freshman Phillip
TVinidad won the 200IM.
Stanford's swimmers now top
the early season charts in all of
nine swimming events that it won
on Saturday. Those swimmers
include Schell, Hudepohl, Weath
erford, Mayfield and Carey — the
400 medley relay team and the 400
free relay foursome.

swimming team. In the Cardinal's
first dual meet of the year, back
stroker Derek Weatherford, the
defending NCAA champion in the
100 meter backstroke, qualified
for the NCAA tournament in the
200 back and set a new pool record
with a time of 1:43.82.
As if that was not enough to
start ofT the season with a bang,
Weatherford also broke the
deGuerre record in the 200 IM by
completing the medley in 1:48.48.
"I wasn't expecting to do this
well," Weatherford said. "We were
just excited to swim against Texas.
We wanted to set the tone early
and make sure that no other team
thinks that they can beat us."
The Longhorns could barely
keep their heads above water, as

the Cardinal won all but two of the
13 events and the Longhorns
managed to gain more points than
Stanford in only the 1,000 free
style.
"We had a great day," said Car
dinal coach Skip Kenney. "I don't
think that we've ever swum this
fast in November. I couldn't be
more excited about this team and
where we are right now."
The first event of the afternoon
set the tone for the entire meet.
Stanford's top 400 medley relay
team left Texas' number-one four
some in its wake, defeating the
Longhorns by more than three
seconds. The team of Weather
ford, Tyler Mayfield, Clay Tippins
and Brian Retterer helped the
Cardinal jump out to a quick 15-2
lead.
Stanford sophomore freestyler
Joe Hudepohl placed first in all
three of his events. He squeaked
by with a win in the 100 free, and
then flushed his opponents in the
200 free by nearly two seconds.
"This was really what I was
looking for," said Hudepohl, who
is ranked second in the 100 m free,
seventh in the 200 m free and
eighth in the 50 free nationally. "I
had high expectations, and we

really wanted to prove something
in the preseason."
There is little more evidence
that the Cardinal can produce that
would more persuasively get their
point across.
"If we can handle No. 2 this easy
we're going to be able to handle any
other college team beneath us,"
said Weatherford.
In winning the 200 back,
Weatherford defeated Texas' Brad

Bridgewater, who finished fourth
in both the 100 and 200 backs a
year ago.
In the 200 free, a race that pit
ted defending Texas' NCAA cham
pion Josh Davis against Hudepohl,
last year's runner-up, Hudepohl
was avenged as he blew by Davis
and won easily.
Stanford led 147-79 when the final
event of the day rolled around — the
400 free relay, a race that would serve
only as bragging rights to the winning
team. The Cardinal's A squad (Retter
er, Hudepohl, Tippins and Bill Schell)
beat the Longhorns' top team to wrap
up what was certainty an all-Stanford

affair.
"This is the best team effort I've
ever seen," said Hudepohl. "They
are talking about this being one of
the best teams ever, and we just
took a big step in proving that."
The high quality of Stanford's
swimming is a pleasant surprise to
Kenney, who had made some
adjustments in the Cardinal train
ing philosophy.
"We're not sprinting as much
yet so our pyramid can be higher
when March rolls around," said
Kenney. "We've come back to the
basics in training. We wanted to
build that base back up."

The Cardinal continued their dom
inance in the pool on Sunday, soundly
defeating Fresno State in Southern
California 123-68. Tippins won both
the 200 free and the 100 fly to lead
Stanford in winning nine of the 11
events. The 400 m relay team won
again, while freshman Phillip
TVinidad won the 200IM.
Stanford's swimmers now top
the early season charts in all of
nine swimming events that it won
on Saturday. Those swimmers
include Schell, Hudepohl, Weath
erford, Mayfield and Carey — the
400 medley relay team and the 400
free relay foursome.
The highly-touted men's swim
ming battle pitting the nation's
top two teams against each other
turned out to be a mere shellack
ing, as No. 1 Stanford drowned
No. 2 Texas Saturday 160-83 in a
deluge of downed deGuerre pool
records.
Someone should tell the swim
squad that it is only November —
they are already performing like a
typical February Stanford men's
swimming team. In the Cardinal's
first dual meet of the year, back
stroker Derek Weatherford, the
defending NCAA champion in the
100 meter backstroke, qualified
for the NCAA tournament in the
