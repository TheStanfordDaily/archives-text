## Water polo falls in MSPF Tournament 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
No one expected two losses.
Coach Dante Dettamanti and
the top-ranked Stanford water
polo team didn't expect two losses.
The directors of the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation Tour
nament didn't expect the No. 1
team to lose twice, either.
However, despite all expecta
tions to the contrary, the Cardi
nal (20-5) lost both of its Satur
day matches, first to No. 5 UC-
Irvine, 9-8, then in overtime to
No. 4 Cal, 10-8. The two defeats
left Stanford without a game to
play on Sunday, although they
finished the tournament in fifth
place.
"The way this tournament
was set up was really screwy,"
Dettamanti said. "They didn't
count on the No. 1 team losing
twice, so while most teams were
guaranteed three games, we only
played twice."
While the early departure
from Long Beach, Calif., was
unexpected, the team is still in
the hunt for the national title.
The Cardinal has the fewest loss
es among the title contenders
and doesn't have a losing record
against any team.
UC-Irvine opened the tourna
ment with an 8-7 win over
UCLA, advancing to a matchup
with Stanford. Despite Anteater
star Marc Hunt's absence from
the game due to a broken hand,
the Cardinal failed to capitalize
on their opportunities, playing
uninspired water polo for the
first three quarters.
"We were just flat," Detta
manti said. "It was their second
game of the day, and they were
missing their best player. We just
didn't play well at all."
The Cardinal trailed for the
majority of the game, but the
clinching shot came with six min
utes left in the game. With Irvine
leading 7-5, Kurt Edler's two
point attempt was deflected by a
Stanford defender. The misdirec

tion allowed the shot to get by
Cardinal goalie Larry Bercutt
and into the net.
"I thought we had a chance to
come back," Dettamanti said.
"When we were down four with
six minutes left, we started press
ing, fouling and stealing. We got
several steals and goals from
Antonio (Busquets), Wolf (Wigo)
and Jeremy (Laster)."
After Stanford pulled to with
in one, senior offensive captain
Chris Wallin made a steal and
pulled away from the defense for
a fast break. Working for a shot
in front of the goal, Wallin did
not receive a call from the official
and the Cardinal rally was extin
guished.
"He was facing the goal inside
four meters," Dettamanti said.
"We thought it should have been
a penalty shot, but the ref didn't
blow the whistle. He didn't call a
regular foul or anything."
Although the Cardinal missed
out on a chance to tie the game
with the referee's non-call, Stan
ford players did not blame the
officiating for their loss.
"We basically didn't execute
our game plan," Busquets said.
"We just didn't play very well."
"We were looking ahead to Cal
and didn't respect Irvine
enough," Dettamanti said.
"What hurt us most was when we
found out Hunt wasn't playing.
We thought we could waltz
through the game."
In the afternoon, the Cardinal
put their earlier setback behind
them and took on the defending
MPSF-champion Golden Bears.
Once again, Stanford came up
just short, losing in overtime.
"Against Cal, we played a very
good game," Dettamanti said.
"The game was marred by a lot of
penalties (Stanford was called for
eight ejection fouls and three
penalty shots, while Cal amassed
10 and two respectively). We
played well for pretty much the
whole game."
The contest was close throug
hout, with the score tied six times
over the course of the match.
"They got a lot of small breaks
and some calls just didn't go our
way," Busquets added.
With the NCAA Champion-ships
just two weeks away and weekend
home games against Pacific and Cal
this weekend, defense is the Cardi
nal's main concern.
"We need to start doing things
we were doing in the first half of
the season," Dettamanti said.
"We're scoring the same amount
of goals now, but we need to play
better defense. We're making too
many mistakes, and teams are
scoring because of that.
"In the first half of the season,
Larry was making spectacular
saves to cover up some mistakes.
The goalies are still making good
saves, (but) the other teams are
capitalizing more often."
Bercutt tallied 20 saves in
the two games, including 15
against Cal.
Team members admitted that
Stanford's defense was not up to
par. "Defensively, we weren't
concentrating very much," Bus
quets said. "Against Cal we did,
but we still lost. We basically lost
because of the defense."
Although being knocked out
of the tournament early was
tough on Dettamanti and his
team, the team's focus is on
NCAAs.
"Even though we lost at this
tournament, we know that all
that matters is NCAAs," Bus
quets said. "All we have to do is
win our last three games."
Dettamanti agreed that the Cardi
nal's chances of bringing home a
national title were not hurt in the
least by last weekend's disappointing
performances.
"The situation now is that
we'll probably still get the No. 1
or No. 2 seed at NCAAs," he
said. "Any one of five teams
could win (the NCAA Tourna
ment) — it's that close. This is
the closest I can remember in
the past 20 years."
When the time comes, the
Cardinal is ready to prove them
selves by claiming the NCAA
trophy.

manti said. "It was their second
game of the day, and they were
missing their best player. We just
didn't play well at all."
The Cardinal trailed for the
majority of the game, but the
clinching shot came with six min
utes left in the game. With Irvine
leading 7-5, Kurt Edler's two
point attempt was deflected by a
Stanford defender. The misdirec

tion allowed the shot to get by
Cardinal goalie Larry Bercutt
and into the net.
"I thought we had a chance to
come back," Dettamanti said.
"When we were down four with
six minutes left, we started press
ing, fouling and stealing. We got
several steals and goals from
Antonio (Busquets), Wolf (Wigo)
and Jeremy (Laster)."
After Stanford pulled to with
in one, senior offensive captain
Chris Wallin made a steal and
pulled away from the defense for
a fast break. Working for a shot
in front of the goal, Wallin did
not receive a call from the official
and the Cardinal rally was extin
guished.
"He was facing the goal inside
four meters," Dettamanti said.
"We thought it should have been
a penalty shot, but the ref didn't
blow the whistle. He didn't call a
regular foul or anything."
Although the Cardinal missed
out on a chance to tie the game
with the referee's non-call, Stan
ford players did not blame the
officiating for their loss.
"We basically didn't execute
our game plan," Busquets said.
"We just didn't play very well."
"We were looking ahead to Cal
and didn't respect Irvine
enough," Dettamanti said.
"What hurt us most was when we
found out Hunt wasn't playing.
We thought we could waltz
through the game."
In the afternoon, the Cardinal
put their earlier setback behind
them and took on the defending
MPSF-champion Golden Bears.
Once again, Stanford came up
just short, losing in overtime.
"Against Cal, we played a very
good game," Dettamanti said.
"The game was marred by a lot of
penalties (Stanford was called for
eight ejection fouls and three
penalty shots, while Cal amassed
10 and two respectively). We
played well for pretty much the
whole game."
The contest was close throug
hout, with the score tied six times
over the course of the match.
"They got a lot of small breaks
and some calls just didn't go our
way," Busquets added.
With the NCAA Champion-ships
just two weeks away and weekend
home games against Pacific and Cal
this weekend, defense is the Cardi
nal's main concern.
"We need to start doing things
we were doing in the first half of
the season," Dettamanti said.
"We're scoring the same amount
of goals now, but we need to play
better defense. We're making too
many mistakes, and teams are
scoring because of that.
"In the first half of the season,
Larry was making spectacular
saves to cover up some mistakes.
The goalies are still making good
saves, (but) the other teams are
capitalizing more often."
Bercutt tallied 20 saves in
the two games, including 15
against Cal.
Team members admitted that
Stanford's defense was not up to
par. "Defensively, we weren't
concentrating very much," Bus
quets said. "Against Cal we did,
but we still lost. We basically lost
because of the defense."
Although being knocked out
of the tournament early was
tough on Dettamanti and his
team, the team's focus is on
NCAAs.
"Even though we lost at this
tournament, we know that all
that matters is NCAAs," Bus
quets said. "All we have to do is
win our last three games."
Dettamanti agreed that the Cardi
nal's chances of bringing home a
national title were not hurt in the
least by last weekend's disappointing
performances.
"The situation now is that
we'll probably still get the No. 1
or No. 2 seed at NCAAs," he
said. "Any one of five teams
could win (the NCAA Tourna
ment) — it's that close. This is
the closest I can remember in
the past 20 years."
When the time comes, the
Cardinal is ready to prove them
selves by claiming the NCAA
trophy.
No one on the Farm expects
anything less.
No one expected two losses.
Coach Dante Dettamanti and
the top-ranked Stanford water
polo team didn't expect two losses.
The directors of the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation Tour
nament didn't expect the No. 1
team to lose twice, either.
However, despite all expecta
tions to the contrary, the Cardi
nal (20-5) lost both of its Satur
day matches, first to No. 5 UC-
Irvine, 9-8, then in overtime to
No. 4 Cal, 10-8. The two defeats
left Stanford without a game to
play on Sunday, although they
finished the tournament in fifth
place.
"The way this tournament
was set up was really screwy,"
Dettamanti said. "They didn't
count on the No. 1 team losing
twice, so while most teams were
guaranteed three games, we only
played twice."
While the early departure
from Long Beach, Calif., was
unexpected, the team is still in
the hunt for the national title.
The Cardinal has the fewest loss
es among the title contenders
and doesn't have a losing record
against any team.
UC-Irvine opened the tourna
ment with an 8-7 win over
UCLA, advancing to a matchup
with Stanford. Despite Anteater
star Marc Hunt's absence from
the game due to a broken hand,
the Cardinal failed to capitalize
on their opportunities, playing
uninspired water polo for the
first three quarters.
"We were just flat," Detta
manti said. "It was their second
game of the day, and they were
missing their best player. We just
didn't play well at all."
