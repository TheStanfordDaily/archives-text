Cycling
On Sunday, the Stanford

tain Biking Tournament, held at
a ranch seven miles from the
Chico campus. Racing in the C, or
novice category, the cyclists fin
ished 11th, 12th, 21st and 22nd in
a field of 30 competitors.

The race was the only moun
tain bike competition to be held in
Northern California this year and
was a departure from road-based
competitions, said team member
Mark Prior.
"The course was very difficult.
It had a lot of steep climbing and
descending, a lot of rocks, and was
very skill intensive," said Prior.
Other schools competing at
the event included California,
Chico State and UC-Davis. The
event will not count toward the
team standings, which are based
upon road races.
