# Learning about 'simple things'
## New program teaches med students about everyday care 
### Cametra Thompson Staff writer 
Seven students at the School of Medicine complet
ed a new program in ambulatory care Friday, mark
ing the beginning of the Medical School's new com
mitment to providing the country with more family
doctors and exposing future physicians to the every
day aspects of treating patients.
Although the Medical School requires students to
complete clerkships in medicine, surgery, pediatrics,
gynecology-obstetrics and psychiatry, no program in
ambulatory medicine was required, or even offered,
until this year.
"It is unusual for Stanford to take that big a step,"
said Dr. Samuel Leßaron, the clerkship's coordina
tor. The new clerkship, which began in October, is a
month-long program that involves seven to 10 stu
dents at a time.
Leßaron said the Medical School has recognized
the shortage of primary-care physicians and the
abundance of specialists, and is attempting to alter
the trend. In the past, Leßaron said, medical schools
"taught a lot about how to be doctors in the hospital.
[Students] learn about the complicated things, but
they don't learn about the simple things."

He said the clerkship teaches basic skills, such as
treating patients with colds, stiff backs and sore
knees, as well as appropriate bedside manner.
While the program includes classroom teaching
and workshops in the mornings, afternoons are filled
with hands-on experience. Besides working in family
physicians' offices in Palo Alto, San Jose, and other
locations in the Bay Area, students visit local agen
cies such as hospices, Planned Parenthood clinics and
homes for the elderly.
Fourth-year student John Chen, one of the seven
students who completed the course, said problems in
ambulatory medicine are different from those in a
hospital.
"You see what it's like to function in a community
without the resources of a hospital or a medical
school," he said.
Fifth-year student Daniel Mathalon said his expe
riences in the hospice taught him about the human
element of treating terminally ill patients. "I learned
how people can die with dignity in their homes," he
said.
Both Mathalon and ('hen said the course was more
organized than other clerkships they had completed,
