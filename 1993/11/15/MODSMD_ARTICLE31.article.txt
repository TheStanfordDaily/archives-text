# Classes help new parents learn about babies
##

A new father holds his daughter's hand
with one finger, staring with wonder into
blue eyes that mirror the shade of his own.
"She's so tiny," he coos in amazement. "I
can't believe that she's really part of me."
Later that day, pregnant mothers chat casu
ally about the pros and cons of Fisher-Price
baby walkie-talkies, while their toddlers
tumble around the room.
Both groups are a part of the Stanford
Mother and Baby Center, which provides —
along with basic health care — a compre
hensive program of classes dealing with
everything from prenatal care to child-rear
ing education.
Marilyn Swarts, manager of nurses for
labor and delivery at the center, developed
the idea of combining the child development
and prenatal services in 1986 as part of her
graduate school thesis.
"I saw a real need to have childbirth edu
cation at Stanford," says Swarts.
The Mother and Baby Center, operated
by Stanford Hospital and the Children's
Hospital, offers a wide variety of prenatal
and health services, including a perinatal
diagnosis center, which deals with the often
neglected area of unusual pregnancies and
fertility cases.
"It's a good place for mothers at a high
risk," says Nancy Sanchez, coordinator of
the community education programs. The
clinic also offers an intensive-care infant
nursery for babies with serious illnesses.
Among others, the Center offers classes
in maternal fitness and infant care, as well
as classes offering new parents an opportu

nity to discuss their fears and goals in rais
ing a child — everything from finding the
right diaper to control a persistent rash to
managing the delicate ground of sibling
rivalry.
"The Mother and Baby Center is looked
at as an educational center since we're locat
ed at Stanford," says Sanchez.
For the most part, educational classes are
funded by the hospital and free of charge to
participants. All classes are taught by nurses
certified in childbirth education, and classes
are held every day of the week.
The most popular programs, "Mother
and Baby Morning" and "Father and Baby
Evening", provide education and support for
new parents. About 80 mothers and babies
come to the class three mornings a week,
while "Father and Baby Evening" is held
two nights per week.
"Services for men are new and very popu
lar," says Sanchez, adding that many new
fathers feel lost in the preparation and
excitement of pregnancy.
While Swaiis maintains the center's pop
ularity is due "mainly to word of mouth,"
the Center has taken out ads in several
national publications, hoping to draw new
families to the program.
The center is also looking to expand its
services to include more family members in
the childbirth and child-rearing process. The
community has expressed "a lot of interest"
in the creation of a grandparents program,
which the center plans to introduce next
year, Sanchez says. Future plans also
include a healthy pregnancy seminar and a
women's wellness program, including pre
menopausal education.
