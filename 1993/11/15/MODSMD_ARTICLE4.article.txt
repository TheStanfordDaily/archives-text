# Security to be tight at Big Game
## 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
While Stanford's firefighters
won't be putting in any overtime
during Big Game week, the police
will be out in force, hoping to ap
prehend mischief-makers and pre
vent the violence that scarred last
year's event.
The Axe Committee, Athletics
Department and Police Depart
ment have been working together
to prevent the myriad security
problems that arose at last year's
game, when the "Flag Boy" and the

Stanford Tree were attacked by
UC-Berkeley fans who leaped out
of the stands onto the field.
"Huge amounts of fruit were
thrown at the Band, at the cheer
leaders and anyone else within
striking distance," said senior
Steve Zika, chair of the Axe Com
mittee.
One change in this year's securi
ty involves the exchanging of the
axe. Should Stanford lose Big
Game, the axe won't be exchanged
"in the middle of the field like it tra
ditionally has been, but instead it
will happen out of the line of sight

of the crowd, said senior Zika.
"The presence of the axe is a pro
voking device. It can be the cause of
a riot.
"Basically, they're going to be a
lot stricter about security than
they have been in the past," he said
"They're doing all they can to pre
vent a riot."
Students will be inspected more
carefully for fruit and alcohol upon
entering Stanford Stadium on Sat
urday. In addition, anyone who
rushes the field after the game will
face stiff penalties, including the
possibility of arrest, Zika said.
Big Game week activities kick
off tonight at 8 p.m. with the
eighth annual Big Game Sing-Off
in Burnham Pavilion.
Big Game Gaieties, the annual
musical spoof of the Cal-Stanford
rivalry, will be performed Wednes
day through Friday at 7 p.m. in
Memorial Auditorium.
A "nonflre" pre-Big Game rally
will follow Thursday night's Gai
eties performance. Zika said the
rally will be "accompanied by lasers,

lighting effects, pyrotechnics, and
some other surprises," and will be
held in front of Mem Aud.
Seniors from the football team,
the Stanford Band, cheerleaders,
and two a cappella groups will be
at the rally. Head football coach
Bill Walsh and University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper are also
expected to make appearances.
Zika is optimistic about turnout
for the rally, which is replacing the
traditional Big Game Bonfire.
The Axe Committee canceled
the bonfire last month when it was
discovered that Lake Lagunita,
the bonfire's traditional site, is
home to the threatened California
tiger salamander.
