# Coping with the end of tuition remission
## University drafts plans to fund grad students 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
University officials this week will finalize
plans for dealing with new federal regula
tions that end tuition remission, the govern
ment practice of reimbursing universities
for graduate student tuition.
Dean of Research Charles Kruger recent
ly submitted a proposal to Provost Con
doleezza Rice suggesting tactics for dealing
with new regulations, including the use of a
special fund to assist needy students.
Kruger refused to comment on his proposal.
The revoking of tuition remission has
been troubling the University since July,
when changes were made in Federal Circu
lar A-21, the regulations that control how in
direct costs are determined.
Previously, tuition remission was consid
ered an indirect cost of research, which is the
amount the University is reimbursed by the
federal government for expenses that can-

not be charged to any specific research pro
ject, such as utilities or building deprecia
tion.
In the past, indirect costs have covered up
to 60 percent of tuition — or nine units of
classes — for graduate students who are
working half-time as a resident assistant or
teaching assistant.
When the new regulations take effect in
1997, the University stands to lose about
$12 million — a loss that could jeopardize
about a quarter of the graduate students
currently involved in federally funded re
search programs — if it does not find anoth
er way to pay for their tuition.
But Kruger believes the revoking of tu
ition remission will be less serious than pre
dicted.
"I believe, contrary to stories last year,
that we will be able to accommodate the
changes in A-21 without a massive impact
