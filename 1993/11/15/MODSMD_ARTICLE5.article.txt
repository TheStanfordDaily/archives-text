# Coping with the end of tuition remission
## University drafts plans to fund grad students 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
University officials this week will finalize
plans for dealing with new federal regula
tions that end tuition remission, the govern
ment practice of reimbursing universities
for graduate student tuition.
Dean of Research Charles Kruger recent
ly submitted a proposal to Provost Con
doleezza Rice suggesting tactics for dealing
with new regulations, including the use of a
special fund to assist needy students.
Kruger refused to comment on his proposal.
The revoking of tuition remission has
been troubling the University since July,
when changes were made in Federal Circu
lar A-21, the regulations that control how in
direct costs are determined.
Previously, tuition remission was consid
ered an indirect cost of research, which is the
amount the University is reimbursed by the
federal government for expenses that can-

not be charged to any specific research pro
ject, such as utilities or building deprecia
tion.
In the past, indirect costs have covered up
to 60 percent of tuition — or nine units of
classes — for graduate students who are
working half-time as a resident assistant or
teaching assistant.
When the new regulations take effect in
1997, the University stands to lose about
$12 million — a loss that could jeopardize
about a quarter of the graduate students
currently involved in federally funded re
search programs — if it does not find anoth
er way to pay for their tuition.
But Kruger believes the revoking of tu
ition remission will be less serious than pre
dicted.
"I believe, contrary to stories last year,
that we will be able to accommodate the
changes in A-21 without a massive impact
on the number of graduate stu
dents and without a major finan
cial loss to the University," he said.
However, there will undoubted
ly be some negative effects from
the changes, said Derek Miyahara,
a graduate student who has been
working with Kruger on this issue.
Miyahara said Kruger is com
mitted to "making every effort" to
identify those students who will be
most negatively affected, so the
University can find some way to
help them cover the extra costs.
"Kruger is thinking about hav
ing a fund of money that he con
trols to cover those students who
need it," Miyahara said, adding
that he did not know where

Kruger would get this money.
Regardless of its precise policy,
Stanford will continue to cover
some of the costs of tuition, said
Patricia Devaney, associate dean of
research. The question facing the
University, though, is how to cover
the expenses previously paid
through indirect costs.
"We will pay it, but it has to be
charged as a direct cost . .. We're
trying to come up with direct ways
of charging it," Devaney said.
By charging the costs directly to
individual projects, for example,
the University will still be able to
cover some portion of the tuition
with funding from the specific
grant or contract that supports the
research.
"A question we have right now
is what effect this will have on the
behavior of the people giving the
grants. Will we lose any of them?"

Miyahara said.
The University has already
adjusted its grant-writing proce
dures to deal with the new regula
tions when they go into effect. All
new grants written in the last year
require that after 1997, the grant
is committed to funding half of
graduate tuition, Miyahara said.
However, Miyahara said it is
uncertain what will happen afler
1997 to graduate students who are
working under grants written
before last year, when the Univer
sity assumed that tuition remis
sion would last indefinitely.
In formulating his proposal,
Kruger has met with several differ
ent departments that are affected by
the changes in A-21, he said. In
addition, he is advised by a commit
tee comprised of Miyahara, Devaney
and various representatives from
different graduate schools.

According to Chief Financial
Officer Peter Van Etten, the Uni
versity will finalize its response to
the changes "within a week."
"We've focused on making sure
that the various areas affected in
the University are involved in the
discussion," Kruger said. "Tuition
remission is used differently in
each department; we need to
understand each one separately."
For example, the amount of time
that it takes for graduate students
to reach terminal graduate registra
tion status — after which they only
have to pay $600 per quarter as
compared to $3,500 before reaching
this status — varies among schools,
Miyahara said.
However, once the changes take
effect, all of the graduate schools
will probably try to get their stu
dents to this status as soon as pos
sible, Miyahara said.
