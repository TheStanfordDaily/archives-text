The Commission on Undergraduate Ed

and weaknesses of undergraduate majors
on Friday, deciding that a subcommittee

meeting was to determine some of the is
sues they would like the subcommittee to
examine.
"We're just going to encourage depart
ment programs to think about what they're
doing and suggest mechanisms by which
majors could be reviewed," he said.
Members talked about "the ingredients"
of strong majors, which they agreed were a
core experience and direction, he said. The

Mathematics Prof. Brad Osgood. Interdis

marks for being well structured, according
to junior Luz Herrera, the commission's
undergraduate member.
