# CUE examines majors
## Commission probes weak, strong areas; subcommittee likely to investigate further 
### Juthymas Harntha Editorial staff 
The Commission on Undergraduate Ed
ucation took a hard look at the strengths
and weaknesses of undergraduate majors
on Friday, deciding that a subcommittee
should be established to investigate the is
sues further.
Commission members were each given
descriptions of three to four majors to re
view and discuss at the meeting.
"We collected information from differ
ent departments and | inter-departmental
programs] and then talked about what a
major should involve," said History Prof.
James Sheehan, the commission's chair.
He said the discussion focused on why
certain majors were particularly strong or
weak, but in a very general way. "It was
clear to us that we were not going to evalu
ate each major program," he said.
Besides, Sheehan added, "It's not our job
to come up with a list of majors that should

be closed." Instead, he said, the point of the
meeting was to determine some of the is
sues they would like the subcommittee to
examine.
"We're just going to encourage depart
ment programs to think about what they're
doing and suggest mechanisms by which
majors could be reviewed," he said.
Members talked about "the ingredients"
of strong majors, which they agreed were a
core experience and direction, he said. The
weak programs, on the other hand, tended
to be ones that "were not particularly well
articulated."
Well-laid out majors, such as psycholo
gy, were praised by the committee, said
Mathematics Prof. Brad Osgood. Interdis
ciplinary programs were also given good
marks for being well structured, according
to junior Luz Herrera, the commission's
undergraduate member.
In examining the factors that deter-
mined a major's strength, com
mittee members also looked at
the number of units each major
requires — especially at the value
of 60-unit majors.
"Some people do double majors
(in 60-unit majors) and that
might be because 60 units is too
superficial," Herrera said.
Lowell said that while no
agreement was made on what —
if anything — should be done
about the great difference in units
between certain majors, members
agreed there was a "disparity"
that warranted closer review by
the subcommittee.
The committee also ques
tioned whether all majors should

have some sort of "culminating
experience," such as a thesis or
an exam, which is required at
Harvard and Princeton, Lowell
said.
Members also had strong feel
ings about departmental guide
lines on teaching and professor
accountability.
Some members expressed "dis
belief that there were not more
firmly established procedures in
each department" outlining
requirements and guidelines for
teaching, Lowell said. "The whole
issue of faculty incentives in
undergraduate education needs
to be addressed."
Lowell said promotion, tenure
and hiring practices need to be
investigated in terms of how they
work as incentives for professors
to teach more undergraduate
classes.
