## IIS advisers meet students, discuss future 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
University President Gerhard Casper warned
Friday that as technology and education become
intertwined, universities will face challenges that
"will raise fundamental questions" on their future
role in the world.
Casper made his comments at a session on "Ed
ucation in a Global Cnnt.exf'at the Institute for In
ternational Studies Advisory Council's third meet
ing, which concluded Friday afternoon.
"In the university of the 21st century there will
be no justification for large lecture courses any
more. I think they will disappear," Casper said.

He pointed to the technological advances that
universities enjoy today, such as Stanford's on-line
library catalog system, which can be accessed from
around the world.
"The way to adapt to technological challenges is
for the university to return" to smaller classes,
Casper said.
He added that universities must begin to focus
on imparting a broader education that will enable
graduates to continue the learning process
throughout their lives.
About 20 members of the advisory council —

ment on Stanford's role in global
affairs — attended Friday's events,
which included discussion sessions
on Russia, the environment, edu
cation and "Thinking Beyond Year
2000."
Between sessions, council mem
bers — who are international lead
ers in business, politics and
academia — were bused to Man
zanita Dining Commons to lunch
with students on upscale food-ser
vice fare with names like "Exotic
Mushroom Strudel" and "Cold
Lemon Souffle."
The morning and afternoon dis
cussions were initiated by experts
on each topic drawn from the
Stanford faculty and administra
tion. After introducing aspects of
the University's involvement in
the area, presenters took questions
or allowed council members to
begin discussing the topic.
The system didn't always work
smoothly — a Thursday session on
the Gravity Probe B project

appeared to baffle most of the par
ticipants, who deftly moved the
discussion toward more tangible
real-world applications of the
research.
Friday's topics, however, stimu
lated far more engaging debate
from the council, which included
former Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Paul Volcker, Law Prof,
and state Senator-elect Tom
Campbell, and former Soviet For
eign Minister Alexander Bessmert
nykh.
Seated at tables decked out with
miniature country flags denoting
the nationality of each member,
the council took on Friday's first
topic — prospects for reform in
Russia — with so much gusto that
Distinguished Hoover Fellow
George Shultz, the council's chair,
decided to continue discussion
later in the afternoon.
While former West German
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt
argued that countries involved in
the former Soviet Union must be
informed of the culture and histo
ry of the region, lawyer Max Kam
pelman — a former State Depart
ment counsel — stressed that

"there is a great deal that someone
that knows nothing about the Rus
sian culture" can advise on eco
nomic and financial issues.
Bessmertnykh said that both
sides could be correct, and stressed
that Russia will develop a political
structure that is "completely dif
ferent from any system in the U.S.
or Europe."
At the second session, former
Environmental Protection Agency
chief William Reilly and former
University President Donald
Kennedy focused their introduc
tions on the relationship between
economic and environmental
issues.
Free-traders and environmen
talists "actually have a fair
amount in common," Reilly said,
pointing to the shared fear of the
power of special interests. "Never
theless, they regard each other
warily."
Kennedy, a biology professor,
said that the developed world was
going to have to adjust its con
sumption habits to preserve the
environment in the future.
Casper's comments at the coun
cil's third session drew a quick

response from Campbell, who pre
dicted that schools in the future
"will be defined by the ability of
teaching assistants" and of stu
dents, not by the research of pro
fessors.
"In the end, it won't matter
where the scholars are," Campbell
said.
Casper countered by saying
that he felt "the link between
research and teaching will remain.
. . . The best students will want to
be at the frontier."
"There should be less reliance
on teaching assistants in the
future," he added.
Much of the rest of the day's
discussion gravitated toward the
challenges that the current gener
ation of children and young adults
face. Schmidt — lamenting the
growing influence of television on
young people — argued that pri
mary and secondary education
must also be improved.
It is "much more effective to
learn ethical behavior in practical
everyday life within the family"
than from television, Schmidt said.
"I must say I'm deeply worried
about this."

The system didn't always work
smoothly — a Thursday session on
the Gravity Probe B project

appeared to baffle most of the par
ticipants, who deftly moved the
discussion toward more tangible
real-world applications of the
research.
Friday's topics, however, stimu
lated far more engaging debate
from the council, which included
former Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Paul Volcker, Law Prof,
and state Senator-elect Tom
Campbell, and former Soviet For
eign Minister Alexander Bessmert
nykh.
Seated at tables decked out with
miniature country flags denoting
the nationality of each member,
the council took on Friday's first
topic — prospects for reform in
Russia — with so much gusto that
Distinguished Hoover Fellow
George Shultz, the council's chair,
decided to continue discussion
later in the afternoon.
While former West German
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt
argued that countries involved in
the former Soviet Union must be
informed of the culture and histo
ry of the region, lawyer Max Kam
pelman — a former State Depart
ment counsel — stressed that

"there is a great deal that someone
that knows nothing about the Rus
sian culture" can advise on eco
nomic and financial issues.
Bessmertnykh said that both
sides could be correct, and stressed
that Russia will develop a political
structure that is "completely dif
ferent from any system in the U.S.
or Europe."
At the second session, former
Environmental Protection Agency
chief William Reilly and former
University President Donald
Kennedy focused their introduc
tions on the relationship between
economic and environmental
issues.
Free-traders and environmen
talists "actually have a fair
amount in common," Reilly said,
pointing to the shared fear of the
power of special interests. "Never
theless, they regard each other
warily."
Kennedy, a biology professor,
said that the developed world was
going to have to adjust its con
sumption habits to preserve the
environment in the future.
Casper's comments at the coun
cil's third session drew a quick

response from Campbell, who pre
dicted that schools in the future
"will be defined by the ability of
teaching assistants" and of stu
dents, not by the research of pro
fessors.
"In the end, it won't matter
where the scholars are," Campbell
said.
Casper countered by saying
that he felt "the link between
research and teaching will remain.
. . . The best students will want to
be at the frontier."
"There should be less reliance
on teaching assistants in the
future," he added.
Much of the rest of the day's
discussion gravitated toward the
challenges that the current gener
ation of children and young adults
face. Schmidt — lamenting the
growing influence of television on
young people — argued that pri
mary and secondary education
must also be improved.
It is "much more effective to
learn ethical behavior in practical
everyday life within the family"
than from television, Schmidt said.
"I must say I'm deeply worried
about this."
University President Gerhard Casper warned
Friday that as technology and education become
intertwined, universities will face challenges that
"will raise fundamental questions" on their future
role in the world.
Casper made his comments at a session on "Ed
ucation in a Global Cnnt.exf'at the Institute for In
ternational Studies Advisory Council's third meet
ing, which concluded Friday afternoon.
"In the university of the 21st century there will
be no justification for large lecture courses any
more. I think they will disappear," Casper said.

He pointed to the technological advances that
universities enjoy today, such as Stanford's on-line
library catalog system, which can be accessed from
around the world.
"The way to adapt to technological challenges is
for the university to return" to smaller classes,
Casper said.
He added that universities must begin to focus
on imparting a broader education that will enable
graduates to continue the learning process
throughout their lives.

affairs — attended Friday's events,
which included discussion sessions
on Russia, the environment, edu

2000."
Between sessions, council mem

ers in business, politics and
academia — were bused to Man
zanita Dining Commons to lunch
with students on upscale food-ser
vice fare with names like "Exotic

Lemon Souffle."
The morning and afternoon dis
cussions were initiated by experts
on each topic drawn from the
Stanford faculty and administra
tion. After introducing aspects of
the University's involvement in
the area, presenters took questions
or allowed council members to
begin discussing the topic.
