# Chicano pre-meds preview future profession

Chicano pre-medical students
from all over northern California
gathered at Stanford on Saturday
to study cadavers firsthand and
attend motivational workshops at
a day-long conference designed to
promote Chicano interest in
medicine.
More than 160 students from
six different universities attended
the Stanford-sponsored Dia de los
Muertos Anatomy Day, held at
the Medical School as part of the
first conference of the northern
California Chicanos in Health
Education (CHE) groups.
At the conference, sponsored
by Stanford CHE, students
attended study workshops in
which current medical school stu
dents urged them to adopt better
study habits to meet the medical
school competition.
The day's activities concluded
with a 3-D slide show of the
human body, followed by an
anatomy lab and a hands-on
examination of cadavers.

"It was really nice to see in real
life what's in books," said Stan
ford freshman Arturo Pacheco.
Anatomy Day was organized in
part to encourage Chicano pre
medical students to continue
their studies in spite of various
obstacles they may face.

'Most of us come
from schools with
poor science back
grounds.'

Many minority students are
discouraged from the premedical
curriculum because of poor high
school preparation, said junior
Angel Fabian. "Most of us [Chi
canos] come from schools with
poor science backgrounds. Start
ing from scratch once we get to
college is a struggle in itself,"

she said.
Other students at the confer
ence commented on discrimina
tion in the academic setting. "I
feel like I have to prove that I am
not filling a quota and that I actu
ally deserve to be here," Pacheco
said.
"People say you have things
easy because you're a minority,"
said junior Marisa Echaniz.
Underrepresented groups also
suffer from a lack of role models
and poor advising, particularly
during the medical school applica
tion process, said Hugo Mora, a
counselor at UC-Davis.
He said there is a growing dis
parity between the general popu
lation and minorities in
medicine. Mora cited a recent
article in the Journal of the
American Medical Association,
which reported that Mexican-
Americans constitute only 2 per
cent of medical school enroll
ments nationwide.
"If a pre-med has a 2.4 or 2.5
(GPA), their adviser will immedi
ately say they won't get into med

ical school because you need a 3.5
to get in," said Hugo. "They don't
even mention MCATs and outside
things."
Chicanos "are not always
given attention because they're
not taken seriously," said Clau
dia Soto, a sophomore at Santa
Clara University. "We're always
reminded |by our advisersl about
what we can do if we don't get
into med school."
The Mexican holiday, Dia de
los Muertos, traditionally honors
the deceased. Respect for the dead
is particularly important in the
medical application of cadavers,
said Dr. Gilberto Lucero of UC-
Davis.
The Mexican tradition vener
ates "all that we've been and all
that we are part of," said Lucero.
"It has helped [us] overcome the
fear of death, the loneliness we feel
when one of our loved ones dies."
Other schools in attendance at
the conference were UC-Berkeley,
Santa Clara University, San Jose
State, Cal State Hayward and
UC-Davis.
