# COP may help fix postal problems

### Charles Katz Staff writer 
Complaints of slow mail deliv
ery and notoriously long lines at
the post office may soon be put to
rest, as the ASSU Council of Pres
idents and the Stanford post office
begin working together to offer
the campus more convenient and
efficient mail services.
As one of their projects for the
year, the COP is trying to elimi
nate problems many students
have had with the post office.
"The two biggest criticisms from
students about the post office
have been the wait in line and the
layover of mail," said Claudia
Gonzalez, a member of the execu
tive cabinet of the COP.
The post office is using input
from the COP to help them come up
with ways to alleviate the long lines,
said Jim Ruiz, the station manager
of the Stanford branch office.
Some options under considera
tion include opening the post office
on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 2
p.m., and selling stamps at other
campus locations such as the
Tresidder Union ticket office,
Tresidder Express and the Book
store, Ruiz said.
He said he is also trying to set up
a 24-hour kiosk outside the office
with a vending machine and a scale
so students can weigh their pack
ages and purchase the right
amount of postage. Ruiz said a
drop-off box for the packages would
also be included by the kiosk.
"The kiosk will make it so stu
dents do not have to come into the
office for most transactions,"
Ruiz said.
Another problem the post of
fice and COP hope to solve is slow
