# COP may help fix postal problems
## 
### Charles Katz Staff writer 
Complaints of slow mail deliv
ery and notoriously long lines at
the post office may soon be put to
rest, as the ASSU Council of Pres
idents and the Stanford post office
begin working together to offer
the campus more convenient and
efficient mail services.
As one of their projects for the
year, the COP is trying to elimi
nate problems many students
have had with the post office.
"The two biggest criticisms from
students about the post office
have been the wait in line and the
layover of mail," said Claudia
Gonzalez, a member of the execu
tive cabinet of the COP.
The post office is using input
from the COP to help them come up
with ways to alleviate the long lines,
said Jim Ruiz, the station manager
of the Stanford branch office.
Some options under considera
tion include opening the post office
on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 2
p.m., and selling stamps at other
campus locations such as the
Tresidder Union ticket office,
Tresidder Express and the Book
store, Ruiz said.
He said he is also trying to set up
a 24-hour kiosk outside the office
with a vending machine and a scale
so students can weigh their pack
ages and purchase the right
amount of postage. Ruiz said a
drop-off box for the packages would
also be included by the kiosk.
"The kiosk will make it so stu
dents do not have to come into the
office for most transactions,"
Ruiz said.
Another problem the post of
fice and COP hope to solve is slow
mail delivery. "There is an inher
ent problem in the way this branch
delivers its mail," Ruiz said. The
present system routes all mail
through the San Francisco office
where it is sorted by post office box
section. Then, it is trucked in to
the Stanford office, said Ruiz.
Ruiz said the re-routing, cou
pled with the large number of
post office boxes contributes to a
one- to two-day delay for most
mail. "The Stanford branch has
9,164 post office boxes. That's
about 8,000 more than a normal
post office."
However, Ruiz said there is a
solution to the problem. The post
office purchased delivery bar code
sorters that will automatically sort
the mail by post office box section.

But, the bar code sorters only
work if the mail includes the zip
code plus the last four digits of the
student's post office box number.
Right now, only 15 percent of mail
uses the four digit add-on, Ruiz
said, but he hopes to increase that
percentage to 85 to 90 percent.
That's where the COP comes
in, Gonzalez said. The COP plans
to publicize the "zip code plus
four" system in the dormitories,
she said.
The COP contacted the post
office in order to address student
concerns regarding the mail ser
vice. "The post office has been the
brunt of many jokes. But it still
holds a monopoly on campus. It is
something that affects everyone,"
Gonzalez said.
Gonzalez is optimistic about
the possibilities for change.
"Things will be done. Not that it
has been bad in the past, but there
is lots of room for improvement."
