Abortion law upheld
WASHINGTON (AP) — A Mississip
pi abortion law requiring unmarried
girls to get both parents' consent or a
judge's permission before ending their
pregnancies survived a Supreme Court
challenge yesterday.
The court rejected a constitutional
attack on the law, which opponents
called "devastating" and"the most
burdensome of its kind."
Yesterday's action was not a ruling
but an unexplained refusal to review
the law, which was enacted in 1986 but
had been tied up in court since a feder
al judge barred its enforcement that
year.
The law requires doctors to obtain
written permission from both parents
before performing an abortion on a girl
who is unmarried, under 18 and not

supporting herself.
A judicial-bypass provision allows
such a girl to avoid telling either par
ent if the girl gets a judge's permission.
PLO senior aide murdered
SIDON, Lebanon (AP) — Gunmen
assassinated a senior aide of Yasser
Arafat's yesterday, the fifth PLO offi
cial killed since the Israeli-Palestinian
peace accord was signed.
It was unclear, however, whether
the assassination was linked to the
accord or to infighting between factions
of the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion.
Two assailants firing submachine
guns equipped with silencers shot out
the tires on Lt. Col. Moueen Shabaita's
Volkswagen as he was being driven to a
southern suburb, police said.
