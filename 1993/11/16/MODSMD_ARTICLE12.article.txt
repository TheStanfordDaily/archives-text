# Clinton counts NAFTA votes
## White House makes deals, concedes to farm-state legislators 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Struggling
for votes with time running out, Presi
dent Clinton leaned on Democrats
opposing a trade agreement with Mexico
yesterday and tried to hold Republican
supporters. The White House attempt
ed to pick up farm-state votes with a
wheat deal.
Two days before the showdown, 40
House members said they were still
undecided — 20 Republicans and 20
Democrats. Both sides contended they
would have the votes to win.
Clinton argued there was nothing to
lose by giving the agreement a chance.
"If all the nay sayers turn out to be (cor
rect), the treaty gives us a right to with
draw in six months," he said, imploring
citizens to increase pressure on fence
sitting lawmakers.
An Associated Press count found 205

lawmakers saying they were likely to
vote against the agreement. On the
other side, 189 lawmakers said they
would vote for it; 40 were undecided.
Clinton needs 218 votes to win. Vote
announcements yesterday were heavily
in Clinton's favor.
Congressional sources said the admin
istration struck a deal with several con
gressmen from Oklahoma and Texas to
take action against Canadian wheat
imports in exchange for their votes.
The administration agreed to impose
quotas on durum wheat if Canada does
not change its pricing policies within 60
days, the sources said. Rep. Larry
Combest, R-Texas, cited that agreement
in announcing his support for Clinton
yesterday.
"They've done a deal with everybody
but working people," charged House

Whip David Bonior, D-Mich., a leader of
the anti-NAFTA forces. But he added,
"I think we're going to win."
Undecided lawmakers who dined
with Clinton Sunday night told him
that public opinion is moving toward
support of the agreement, White House
press secretary Dee Dee Myers said.
Outside the Capitol, NAFTA foe Ross
Perot kept up the pressure. He called for
a federal investigation of "billions of
dollars" in projects that he said Clinton
had offered lawmakers Sunday for their
votes. Perot declined to provide exam
ples.
"I think it will be a narrow victory for
NAFTA," said House Speaker Thomas
Foley, D-Wash. "It's based on evidence
of things moving in that direction. . . .
We are not there yet, but we're moving
in that direction, very clearly."
