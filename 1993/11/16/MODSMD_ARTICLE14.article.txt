JUDGING BY THE guest list
— which included a former
Israeli president, a recent
Soviet foreign minister, a former
Australian prime minister and a
former U.S. secretary of state —
one might have thought that Stan
ford had suddenly become the new
home of the United Nations.
Well, maybe not. But if last
week's meeting of Stanford's
Institute for International Stud
ies Advisory Council accomplished
anything, it was to prove that the
group boasts an impressive array
of international leaders in politics,
business and academia.
These luminaries gathered to
discuss Stanford's role in chang
ing world affairs and advise the
University on its programs and
research related to international
security, political economy and
the global environment.
Usually such meetings are
closed, high-level discussions,
open only to a select few faculty

members and administrators.
This year, however, the institute's
directors elected to engage in a bit
of glasnost, allowing students a
chance to interact with dignitaries
who, until now, were mere names
in textbooks and faces on televi
sion.
Wednesday's Middle East
forum and a lunch with students
on Friday were two excellent ways
for council members to share
their experiences with students
and other members of the Stan
ford community. By scheduling
these events, the institute made
clear its support of interconnected
teaching and research.
When planning future high
profile events, the University
should follow the institute's
example. There is no better
method to pursue Stanford's mis
sion than to bring students into
personal contact with those at the
forefront of research and policy
making.
