# Needed: new mascot
## 
### 
STANFORD SPIRIT has been
under the weather for quite
some time and the day has
come to give the University an obvi
ous cure. Recent clamorings for the
adoption of the tiger salamander as
the Stanford mascot highlight a
widely felt sentiment: the "Stan
ford Cardinal" just doesn't cut it.
Granted, a tiger salamander may
not be the best thing to motivate
students and ignite campus unity —
not to mention the problematic and
costly nature of changing school col
ors to yellow and black — but a new,
improved mascot might be just the
thing to give students a boost.
Last year the Office of Technolo
gy and Licensing ran a campaign
soliciting suggestions and samples
for a new logo, in order to pump
new life into the Cardinal. This
effort proving fruitless, it is time to
face the facts and accept the fact
that a color is not an inspiring, ani
mated mascot.

A great proportion of alumni
cling earnestly to the former Indi
an mascot, partly out of nostalgia,
but partly based on the inherent
difficulties of cheering for such a
nebulous concept. The student
body, alumni and University
would be well-served to ditch the
passive color for a more vibrant
image.
True, it is difficult to embody the
spirit of the institution in a member
of the animal kingdom or mythical
figure.
However, any improvements on
the mascot would be a big boost for
morale, whether potentially mar
ketable or not.

The Daily will be accepting sub
missions for mascot ideas and
designs until Dec. 1, we'll print the
best entries at a later date. Members
of the Stanford community are
invited to submit a sketch and an
explanation of the idea's pertinence
at the Daily's offices.
