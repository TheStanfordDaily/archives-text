## Good morning, Stanford 
### 
IT USUALLY TAKES some supernat
ural force to get me out of bed before
10 a.m. I am definitely not a morning
person. Last Tuesday, however, I awoke
at the crack of dawn to view the filming of
"Good Morning America" on the Stan
ford campus.
Joan Lunden and Charlie Gibson were
the hosts of a two-hour superficial exam
ination of what makes this University so
great. The hosts interviewed George
Shultz, Bill Walsh and Summer Sanders.
While they discussed the advanced
research and teaching at Stanford, a
blimp overhead transmitted beautiful
pictures of the sun-drenched Spanish
architecture.
The closest the show came to contro
versy was when Lunden interviewed an
alumna who became Miss America after
leaving the Farm. Did this woman sell
her soul to the chauvinist media world
which objectifies women's bodies and
ignores their brains? As the debate earli
er this year concerning the "Girls of the
Pac-10" issue of Playboy illustrates, this
is a lively and controversial issue on cam
pus.
The smiling anchors ignored other
controversial issues such as race rela
tions, indirect-cost recovery and curricu
lar reform. Surprisingly, the word "mul
ticulturalism" was not mentioned once.
Was the early hour to blame for this col
lective amnesia on the part of the student
body?

Well, while the hour was early, I do
not think that the minds in the audience
were malfunctioning. In fact, I believe
that the show provoked a personal
reassessment by the audience of what
Stanford is all about. When all is safid and
done, the enthusiasm of the students on
that early Tuesday morning conveyed a
sense of how special this University is.
There are those who will argue that
this is a simple-minded analysis of the
circumstances. The environment was
structured by the program for positive
comments, and the audience was a self
selected group of individuals who were
willing to play by these rules. Then of
course, there are the megalomaniacal
tendencies we all harbor; we like seeing
ourselves on camera and in the newspa
per. Why else would one write a weekly
column for The Daily, for instance?
There is some truth in these cynical
observations. The student reaction may
have been very different if the questions
and the respondents were changed. How
ever, the superficial nature of the pro
gram should not mask the more profound
feelings evinced by the audience. Many of
the audience members were resident
assistants from ethnic theme houses,
leaders from voluntary student organiza
tions, and candidates from the People's
Platform. It would take a lot more than
Lunden and Gibson to make these people
forget the University's shortcomings.
The daily criticism which these groups

and others voice is healthy in that it
pushes Stanford to become a better place.
The problem is that criticism is different
from unsubstantiated cynicism and mili
tancy. There is a vocal minority of stu
dents on campus which, when discussing
gender, race and most recently curricular
reform, seems to view Stanford as an
institution rotten to the core. People are
accused of taking "shots" at theme hous
es, and there is even talk of occupying the
president's office to protest curricular
reforms which haven't even been pro
posed yet.
This exaggerated negativism simplisti
cally and unfairly camouflages what
Tuesday morning made evident to me.
While Stanford can and should improve
in many ways, it still is a special place.
When jaded, sleep-deprived upperclass
people are willing to yell "beat Cal" for
Lunden and Gibson at the crack of dawn,
the University is definitely doing some
thing right. Student morale is often over
looked as a means of grading the Univer
sity's actions. Let's criticize, but let's also
avoid the temptation to always assume
the very worst of the University and its
administrators.

Jeremi just loves his new "Good Morn
ing America " frisbee.
