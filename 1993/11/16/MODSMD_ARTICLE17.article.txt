# N'Gai Croal: notes of a non-native son
## Jolly good horrorshow, '90s droog-style 
### 
We produce the film by killing people.
That's the main metaphor.
—Andre Bonzel, cinematographer for
"Man Bites Dog"
TWO SUNDAYS AGO, Flicksgoers
were treated to an unnerving expe
rience. Nearly a hundred people
walked out, many just a few minutes into
the film. A good number of those who sat
through of the film were either shaken up
or disgusted with themselves for staying.
And a vocal portion of the audience
applauded at the end.
The object of their love and loathing? A
Belgian film called "Man Bites Dog." The
plot is simple. A hammy serial killer
named Ben (Benoit Poolverde) agrees to
let struggling documentary filmmakers
Remy and Andre (Remy Belvaux and
Andre Bonzel) make a movie about his
life. Before the opening credits roll, Ben
strangles a woman to death. After the
credits, he treats us to a lesson in corpse
disposal, using the aforementioned victim
as a learning aid.
Ben's activities go from bad to worse.
He charms his way into an elderly
woman's house, then shouts at her,
"Have you ever been snuffed, Granny."
She convulses on the couch — he explains
that he noticed her heart medicine on the
way in, saving himself a bullet.
He subsequently murders a black
night watchman to see if "that rumor
about their size is true." He invades a sub
urban home on a dare from the filmmak
ers, kills the father and mother and then
with the help of the crew, smothers their
eight-year old son.
But the kicker is an extended sequence
where the drunken cast and crew breaks
into an apartment, where the happen
upon a young couple having sex on their
kitchen table. They set up the camera on
a tripod, then gang rape the woman one
after another as the husband watches
helplessly at gunpoint. We then cut to the
aftermath, where the blood of the now
disemboweled couple is splattered all over

the room — and on Ben and filmmakers,
fast asleep on the floor.
Welcome to the terrordome.
Was that as good for you as it was for me?
—Mr. Blonde, after hacking off a police
man 's ear in "Reservoir Dogs"
Why, as the director of ASSU Sunday
Flicks, did I choose to show the film?
My freshman year, Flicks showed
Peter Greenaway's cause celebre, "The
Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover."
People poured out en masse. Sophomore
year, they showed David Lynch's first
film after "Blue Velvet," "Wild at Heart."
Same result: mass exodus. Last year, all
of the films were simply inoffensive.
Nothing to make me joyous, upset, angry,
sad, pensive or just plain turn my stom
ach — the visceral experiences that art
ought to provide.
In the best Flicks tradition, "Man Bites
Dog" was my heartfelt gift to Stanford. A
celluloid time bomb designed not only to
create an explosive controversy, but to
make us think about our obsession with
serial killers, reality television and the
relentless aestheticization of violence.
The film is especially disturbing
because it's shot in 16mm black-and
white film with a single hand-held camera
— a cross between those old science docu
mentaries we used to watch in elementary
school and MTV shaky-cam. Blown up to
35mm, it looks like someone's nightmar
ishly perverse home snuff movie. The low
budget works in the Belgian trio's favor
— everything looks like it's real.
But what's the difference between
watching that and watching an hour of
"Rescue 911," "Cops" or even "America's
Funniest Home Videos"? The media con
stantly packages "reality" as entertain
ment — see Dick get swept away by a
flash flood, watch Jane get picked up in a
prostitution sting and laugh as Spot falls
ofT the roof — and we consume it safely
from the comforts of our cozy homes.
Even the nightly news finds some way

to tell the day's tragedies, crises or sex
scandals in two to three minutes so that
they don't interfere with the increasingly
necessary advertising dollar. "Man Bites
Dog" lies along the same continuum as
much of our current entirement — it just
chooses to rub our face in it.
/ would make it lyrical. / would put
Mahler over it.
—director Peter Medak ("The Krays,"
"Romeo is Bleeding") on how he portrays
of violence differently than in "True
Romance."
A fellow columnist and Stanley
Kubrick's Number One Fan (primarily
for "A Clockwork Orange"), was especial
ly put off by "Man Bites Dog." They didn't
need to kill the little boy, she said. They
didn't have to show the woman being
raped and Ben cracking jokes all the
while. It was real .. . more than real ...
you know, really real.
But Kubrick, presumably, didn't need to
show a woman being gang-raped ... while
classical music played in the background.
He didn't have to show a woman being
bludgeoned to death with an enormous
porcelain penis ... to the tunes of
Beethoven — good old Ludwig Van. Vertig
inous low angles, gliding steadicam work,
seductive slow-motion shots: Kubrick dis
tances his audience from the violence he
shows by constantly aestheticizing it.
How sweet.
And he isn't alone. Steven Seagal,
Jean-Claude Van Damme and Mel Gibson
wouldn't have careers without the
panache of their trademark cartoon vio
lence. But does that truly make it less
offensive? How many of us walked out of
"Total Recall," one of the most mind
numbingly violent films ever made, sup
posedly leavened by Arnie's one-line witti
cisms? Did we walk out of "Untamed
Heart," where the near-rape of Marisa
Tomei takes place only so Christian Slater
can save her? Or most recently, "Malice,"
where the serial rapist has nothing to do

with the plot except to prove that one of
the main characters is sterile?
Even a brilliantly crafted movie like
"Silence of the Lambs" can be faulted for
making a serial killer sympathetic — all of
us cheered when Hannibal "The Canni
bal" Lecter told Clarice Starling that he
was "having an old friend for dinner."
Films like "Man Bites Dog" and "Henry:
Portrait of a Serial Killer" are often
attacked for the graphic nature of their
material or for a complete absence of
morality. But contemporary commercial
cinema is by definition amoral.
They're just the only ones willing to
say it.

N 'Gai Croal's advice for the day? Look for
the Proteus ad on page 5 and follow the
instructions. His column appears here
Tuesdays.

you know, really real.
But Kubrick, presumably, didn't need to
show a woman being gang-raped ... while
classical music played in the background.
He didn't have to show a woman being
bludgeoned to death with an enormous
porcelain penis ... to the tunes of
Beethoven — good old Ludwig Van. Vertig
inous low angles, gliding steadicam work,
seductive slow-motion shots: Kubrick dis
tances his audience from the violence he
shows by constantly aestheticizing it.
How sweet.
And he isn't alone. Steven Seagal,
Jean-Claude Van Damme and Mel Gibson
wouldn't have careers without the
panache of their trademark cartoon vio
lence. But does that truly make it less
offensive? How many of us walked out of
"Total Recall," one of the most mind
numbingly violent films ever made, sup
posedly leavened by Arnie's one-line witti
cisms? Did we walk out of "Untamed
Heart," where the near-rape of Marisa
Tomei takes place only so Christian Slater
can save her? Or most recently, "Malice,"
where the serial rapist has nothing to do

with the plot except to prove that one of
the main characters is sterile?
Even a brilliantly crafted movie like
"Silence of the Lambs" can be faulted for
making a serial killer sympathetic — all of
us cheered when Hannibal "The Canni
bal" Lecter told Clarice Starling that he
was "having an old friend for dinner."
Films like "Man Bites Dog" and "Henry:
Portrait of a Serial Killer" are often
attacked for the graphic nature of their
material or for a complete absence of
morality. But contemporary commercial
cinema is by definition amoral.
They're just the only ones willing to
say it.

N 'Gai Croal's advice for the day? Look for
the Proteus ad on page 5 and follow the
instructions. His column appears here
Tuesdays.

We produce the film by killing people.
That's the main metaphor.
—Andre Bonzel, cinematographer for
"Man Bites Dog"
TWO SUNDAYS AGO, Flicksgoers
were treated to an unnerving expe
rience. Nearly a hundred people
walked out, many just a few minutes into
the film. A good number of those who sat
through of the film were either shaken up
or disgusted with themselves for staying.
And a vocal portion of the audience
applauded at the end.
The object of their love and loathing? A
Belgian film called "Man Bites Dog." The
plot is simple. A hammy serial killer
named Ben (Benoit Poolverde) agrees to
let struggling documentary filmmakers
Remy and Andre (Remy Belvaux and
Andre Bonzel) make a movie about his
life. Before the opening credits roll, Ben
strangles a woman to death. After the
credits, he treats us to a lesson in corpse
disposal, using the aforementioned victim
as a learning aid.
Ben's activities go from bad to worse.
He charms his way into an elderly
woman's house, then shouts at her,
"Have you ever been snuffed, Granny."
She convulses on the couch — he explains
that he noticed her heart medicine on the
way in, saving himself a bullet.
He subsequently murders a black
night watchman to see if "that rumor
about their size is true." He invades a sub
urban home on a dare from the filmmak
ers, kills the father and mother and then
with the help of the crew, smothers their
eight-year old son.
But the kicker is an extended sequence
where the drunken cast and crew breaks
into an apartment, where the happen
upon a young couple having sex on their
kitchen table. They set up the camera on
a tripod, then gang rape the woman one
after another as the husband watches
helplessly at gunpoint. We then cut to the
aftermath, where the blood of the now
disemboweled couple is splattered all over

the room — and on Ben and filmmakers,
fast asleep on the floor.
Welcome to the terrordome.
Was that as good for you as it was for me?
—Mr. Blonde, after hacking off a police
man 's ear in "Reservoir Dogs"
Why, as the director of ASSU Sunday
Flicks, did I choose to show the film?
My freshman year, Flicks showed
Peter Greenaway's cause celebre, "The
Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover."
People poured out en masse. Sophomore
year, they showed David Lynch's first
film after "Blue Velvet," "Wild at Heart."
Same result: mass exodus. Last year, all
of the films were simply inoffensive.
Nothing to make me joyous, upset, angry,
sad, pensive or just plain turn my stom
ach — the visceral experiences that art
ought to provide.
In the best Flicks tradition, "Man Bites
Dog" was my heartfelt gift to Stanford. A
celluloid time bomb designed not only to
create an explosive controversy, but to
make us think about our obsession with
serial killers, reality television and the
relentless aestheticization of violence.
The film is especially disturbing
because it's shot in 16mm black-and
white film with a single hand-held camera
— a cross between those old science docu
mentaries we used to watch in elementary
school and MTV shaky-cam. Blown up to
35mm, it looks like someone's nightmar
ishly perverse home snuff movie. The low
budget works in the Belgian trio's favor
— everything looks like it's real.
But what's the difference between
watching that and watching an hour of
"Rescue 911," "Cops" or even "America's
Funniest Home Videos"? The media con
stantly packages "reality" as entertain
ment — see Dick get swept away by a
flash flood, watch Jane get picked up in a
prostitution sting and laugh as Spot falls
ofT the roof — and we consume it safely
from the comforts of our cozy homes.
Even the nightly news finds some way

to tell the day's tragedies, crises or sex
scandals in two to three minutes so that
they don't interfere with the increasingly
necessary advertising dollar. "Man Bites
Dog" lies along the same continuum as
much of our current entirement — it just
chooses to rub our face in it.
/ would make it lyrical. / would put
Mahler over it.
—director Peter Medak ("The Krays,"
"Romeo is Bleeding") on how he portrays
of violence differently than in "True
Romance."
A fellow columnist and Stanley
Kubrick's Number One Fan (primarily
for "A Clockwork Orange"), was especial
ly put off by "Man Bites Dog." They didn't
need to kill the little boy, she said. They
