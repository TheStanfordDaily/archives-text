## Goldman more than Peanuts 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
He arrives at Stanford football games
at 8 a.m. for a 12:30 p.m. kickoff, but it's
not to get in some extended tailgating
time. Sam Goldman comes to work.
Goldman is a senior citizen who has
been a volunteer assistant to the Stanford
Sports Information office since 1989,
when he retired as the Sports Informa
tion director at San Francisco State.
"I am now 67 years of age and I'm still
doing what I've done all my life," Gold
man said proudly. "When I was a young
ster my mother said that going into the
journalism field would make me smoke
cigarettes, become a drinker and alco
holic, and it would be a miserable life.
"I wasn't going to be a doctor or lawyer
like so many of the parents from Europe
wanted their children to be. But I was for
tunate enough to become successful in my
field and my parents did see the success
and they enjoyed it."
A native of San Francisco, Goldman
was one of the pioneers in the sports
information field. Following a stint in the
U.S. Navy as a yeoman during World War
II and the completion of his bachelor's
degree at San Jose State, Goldman was
offered the position of Sports Information
director (SID) at San Francisco State in
1957 while working on a master's degree
in history.
"I'm a very lucky man because I found
my niche early and pursued it," Goldman
said. "I knew the person who had the
sports publicist job, which was only a Sat
urday job, and they offered the position to
me. It gave a challenge for me to make the
position into a professional-type position,
where you do things day-in and day-out to
let the public know what your program
has to offer."
A recent inductee into S.F. State's Ath
letic Hall of Fame, Goldman stayed at the
school until 1972, while at the same time
devoting himself to his other passion —
teaching. A firm believer in education,
Goldman has taught journalism, political
science and U.S. history at both the high
school and collegiate levels.
In 1979, Goldman became the SID of

the West Coast Athletic Conference,
where he stayed until he returned to be
the SID at S.F. State in 1984. Following
his retirement, Goldman found that he
could not stay away from college athletics,
and given his penchant for education,
Stanford's program provided the perfect
balance.
"Stanford has a first-class program,"
Goldman said. "The academics come first.
The athletics are essential to the aca
demics, but it's the kind of program that
you can enjoy with people who think in
those type of terms."

If there's a more outgo
ing, nicer guy in college
athletics, I've never met
him. Plus, he does won
ders for your breath.'

"He's just here because he loves to be
here," said Bob Murphy, the longtime
voice of Stanford football and basketball.
"He loves the association, he loves compe
titions — he is a living monument to
intercollegiate athletics because he really
believes it's an educational process."
Among those getting an education are
Stanford's three Sports Information
directors, who are constantly learning
from Goldman.
"He's been an SID longer than I've
been alive, so I can glean a lot of knowl
edge from him," said Senior Director
Gary Migdol. "I'm picking his brain all
the time and respect what he has to say."
"He helps us in handling so many dif
ferent events, from football press confer
ences to basketball press conferences to
game management at a basketball game,"
said Director Steve Raczynski. "Even
though I've been an SID for 18 years
doesn't mean I can't learn more from an
old master like Sam."
"Sam is invaluable," added Director
Bob Vazquez. "It's amazing how we can

always ask Sam to do one more thing in
this office — and he does it cheerfully and
professionally. You would think that a
man of his age would be slowing down,
but it seems like as he gets older he
becomes more enthusiastic about this
profession of sports information, and just
helping people in general. He is a volun
teer in this office, yet he is a Most Valu
able Person in this office."
Media who attend Stanford football
and basketball games cannot help but
notice Goldman's energy. He pleasantly
greets everyone who comes into the press
box and rushes to service any requests the
journalists may have.
"He's a lover of college sports," said
John Platz, Stanford basketball color
commentator. "He is unbelievably helpful
to the writers and announcers. He senses
what we need before you even ask."
"He's bigger than life," said Mark
Soltau, who has covered Stanford football
for the San Francisco Examiner the past
ten years. "If there's a more outgoing,
nicer guy in college athletics, I've never
met him. He's helpful, he's accurate, and
he's willing to go the extra step for you
and I'm very appreciative of him. Plus, he
does wonders for your breath."
Goldman's trademark is the Snoopy
Mint Box. Goldman brings a box plastered
with Peanuts stickers and filled with can
dies whenever he works at a Stanford
sporting event.
"When I became the Sports Informa
tion director at San Francisco State in
1957, I used to give away Doublemint
chewing gum to our athletes," Goldman
said. "In those days, athletes chewed
chewing gum, so whenever we went on
the road or whenever we had a game I
used to buy boxes of chewing gum, and
that went on for many years until about
the 1970s when the chewing gum fad
faded.
"When I became the West Coast Ath
letic Conference Sports Information
director in the 19705, I decided to act as a
host, and what you do when you act as a
host is to always give something to the
people who are your guests. I developed
this idea with the little box with the pep
permints and the butterscotches.

"In a way, it represents my philosophy
about the role of the Sports Information
director — and that is we are a host to
whomever we compete against. At times,
in this business of competition, we treat
our guests oftentimes as an enemy that
we want to defeat, and we sports informa

tion directors should not get ourselves
involved in that kind of a syndrome. In
many respects that sweetness that comes
with the butterscotch and the peppermint
symbolizes 'We're glad to have you here,

we want you to do a good job, we'll
try to help you and service you the
best we can.' That's why I have that
little box of candy. It symbolizes to
me that there is a comradeship."
Nowhere is that comradeship
more evident than at the Big
Game, and Goldman has seen
more than his share of the cross-
Bay rivalry.

"If you want to talk about a
famous event, it had to be when
Cal beat Stanford 16-0 with the
famous Frankie Albert team (in
1941)," Goldman observed. "But I
also saw the famous Stanford
game (in 1974) where Mike Lang
ford kicked a field goal with no
time left at Berkeley. I was sitting
in the endzone and I thought the
ball was coming right at me."
Instead, Goldman gravitated to
the press box, leaving the ball
behind but taking his enthusiasm
for college sports with him.
