# Men's golfers fine in Carolina while women slip in the South
## Gents finish third behind Begay's record-breaking 14-under-par total 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
If the Stanford men's golf
team continues to shoot as well
as they did in Hilton Head this
weekend, other collegiate golf
squads might as well switch to
playing mah-jongg next year.
Less than a week after signing
junior golf phenom Tiger Woods,
the seventh-ranked Cardinal
traveled to South Carolina and
placed third in the Golf World
Championship, in which 15 of
the top 17 teams in the country
competed.
Although Stanford fell nine
strokes short of Oklahoma State
for the team title, the Cardinal's
Notah Begay 111 shot a five
under-par 67 in Sunday's final
round to win the individual title.
Begay, who finished at 14-under
par, fell just one stroke shy of
setting the tournament record.
The redshirt junior's three-day
combined score of 202 was the
lowest such total for any Stan

ford player in history.
"The hole looked really big and
I felt that I could make every putt
I looked at," said Begay. "I think
our performance as a team is
really encouraging and it's a good
indication of how we stand with
the top teams in the nation."
The win comes on the heels of
Begay's second-place finish in the
Stanford Shootout Oct. 31. "I've
taken a new mental approach,"
said the junior. "I've been playing
within myself and it's really
made a difference these past two
tournaments."
Eldrick "Tiger" Woods, who
signed a letter of intent to attend
Stanford last week, won the
USGA Junior Championships a
record three times. The 17-year
old from Cypress, Calif., the
youngest golfer ever to partici
pate in a PGA Tour event, will
join Begay, Brad Lanning, Steve
Burdick, Casey Martin and
William Yanagisawa to create
what many consider the team to
beat in 1994.

"It's a win-win-win situa
tion," said coach Wally Goodwin,-
referring to the recruitment of
Woods.
"He wins, the team wins and I
win. Things turned out perfect.
I'm excited that we're not just
getting a great player, we're get
ting a great kid that can help us
reach our goal of a national
championship."
But many don't think they
need to wait until next year to
see Stanford win a national title.
"What we need to do is focus
on what we have in front of us,"
said Begay. "I still feel that we
haven't played as well as we can
play. It's something for the team
to work for and I think we have
as good a chance as anyone in the
NCAAs this spring."
"We've had a really terrific fall
season," said Goodwin. "We've
gotten better as the season has
gone along. When you're throw
ing away a worst score of 74 than
you know you're playing some
great golf."
The team is now off until
February when they travel to
Hawaii to compete in the Big
island Invitational and the John
F. Burns Invitational.
