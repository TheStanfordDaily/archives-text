# Ladies stall in opening round but rally to finish fifth
## 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
There's an old saying that his
tory does not repeat itself. The
Stanford women's golf team
found out history doesn't care
much for old sayings.
This weekend at the Golf-
World Championship in Hilton
Head, S.C., held at the Palmetto
Dunes Golf Course, the Cardinal
squad once again fell behind early
and once again had to rally to fin
ish respectably. After the first
round, fourth-ranked Stanford
was ninth in a field consisting of
the top 10 teams in the nation.
An excellent second-round score
of 292 shots pulled them into
sixth place, before Sunday's final
round left them in the fifth posi
tion.
Second-ranked Arizona State
captured first place with a three
day total of 870 strokes. N0.7
Texas finished 20 strokes behind
for second, No. 6 Duke was 21
back for third, while No. 1 San
Jose State finished 33 shots off
the lead for fourth. The Cardi

nal's final shot total was 906, 36
behind the winner.
Just three weeks ago at the
Stanford Collegiate Invitational,
the team also got off to bad start
before regrouping and climbing
to a position more in synch with
their lofty national ranking.
"We have to learn how to come
out of the chute a little bit quick
er," said head coach Tim Bald
win. "But it was a real good finish
considering where we were after
the first round."
Freshman golfer Mhairi
McKay felt the poor start was due
to the unfamiliar surroundings.
"We took a while to get used to
the course," she said. "It really
set us back."
However, the team would not
be discouraged.
"We knew we could play a
whole lot better," continued
McKay. "And we didn't much like
being in ninth, either."
Baldwin was satisfied, if not
thrilled with the performance.
"It was a good effort and outing
for the whole team," he said.
"Saturday's round was out

standing and so were the front
nine holes on Sunday. We let
things get away on the last nine
or we might have done even bet
ter."
Emilee Klein of Arizona State
led all individuals with 214
strokes. McKay paced Stanford
with a score of 223, good for 11th
overall. Fellow freshman Andrea
Baxter finished 15th with 226.
"We really got outstanding
performances from the two fresh
man," said Baldwin.
He was especially pleased with
McKay's performance.
"She is going to be one of the
top college players by the end of
this year," he continued.
Other Stanford competitors
included Melinda Daniels and
Amy Lawrence, who both fin
ished 33rd in the 60-player field
with a total of 232, and Jamille
Jose, who finished three strokes
behind in 39th place.
The team had great weather
for the tournament. Rain and
colder temperatures had been
expected earlier in the week, but
sunny conditions prevailed.
