# Athletes of the Week

NCAAs. For most collegiate varsity
teams, the goal of the season is just to
reach this hallowed championship. In
some sports, the successful team attends
en masse, while in others the qualifying
individuals pull the squad along behind
them.
This week's Athletes of the Week,
Leslie Garrard and Derek Weatherford,
are being recognized for their outstanding

efforts last weekend in helping their
respective teams qualify for their season
ending championships.
In women's soccer, one thing is certain
â€” you can't win if you can't score. Seven
teen times this season Cardinal goal
tender Leslie Garrard has assured Stan
ford of victory by not allowing an opposing
shot through the net.
And the higher the stakes, the more
stingy she becomes. In last weekend's
Western Regional victories against Califor
nia and Portland, Leslie posted two
shutouts.
She rejected a total of 14 shots on goal,
lowering her goals-against average to a
miniscule .33.

In the collegiate swimming world,
teams do not qualify for the NCAA Cham
pionships. Rather, individuals qualify in
specific events by racing faster than pre
set times. The more individuals that qual
ify, the better chance the squad has of tak
ing home the team trophy.
That trophy has resided at deGuerre
Pool for the past two years, due in no
small part to the efforts of senior standout
Derek Weatherford, the defending NCAA
champion in the 100-meter backstroke. In
Saturday's battle with Texas, Derek set a
new deGuerre Pool record in the 200-
backstroke with a time of one minute,
43.82 seconds.

Perhaps more impressively, with this
blazing time Weatherford became the first
Stanford swimmer to qualify for NCAAs
this year. Unrested and unshaved, Weath
erford was still able to beat the preset
mark, a feat most top-notch swimmers
must wait until later in the season to
accomplish. Derek also broke the pool
record in the 200 IM with a time of 1:48.48.
