There's always Big Game.
Despite winning a doubles
championship yesterday at Stan
ford Tennis Stadium, the top
ranked Cardinal women were
shut out in singles by a pack of
Golden Bears who were less con
cerned about an Axe than they
were about a Rolex Tennis Cham
pionship.
An all-California singles final
was set up when Stanford's lone
semifinalist, No. 1-seeded Kim
Shasby, was upset by Cal's No. 3-
seeded Vera Vitels, 5-7, 7-6 (8-6),
6-2.
Vitels fought off two match
points before subduing Shasby,
who is ranked sixth overall in the
Rolex preseason poll.
"I feel like I had my opportuni
ties. She [Vitels] hung in there,"
Shasby said.
Cal's Jennifer Poulos defeated
Vitels in the finals, 6-2, 6-4. She
had beaten another teammate,
Nicole Elliot, in the semifinals.
Stanford's only consolation was
that it sent two teams to the final
round in doubles. The team of
Shasby and Beth Berris prevailed
over the tandem of Wendy Sacks

and Sandra De Silva, 6-3, 6-2.
De Silva, a freshman, per
formed impressively in her first
tournament at Stanford, reaching
the quarterfinals in singles before
losing to Elliot in three sets. She
and Sacks also upset the second
seeded Cal tandem of Elliot and
Pam Nelson in the semifinals, 4-
6, 6-4, 7-5.
Stanford head coach Frank
Brennan said, "Sandra has
impressed me all fall. She's been a
bright spot."
Despite the fact that Stanford
was missing two of its top players
— top-ranked Laxmi Poruri had
already qualified for the Rolex
National Tourney, and highly
touted freshman Katie Schluke
bir had strained a hip flexor last
week — Stanford head coach
Frank Brennan said he was "dis
appointed" with the team's show
ing.
"We've got a lot of work to do,"
said Brennan.
Brennan indicated that the
strong showing from the school
from across the Bay could spell
trouble.
"Cal's ranked third in the pre
season poll - and they look at
least that good this year," Bren
nan said.
