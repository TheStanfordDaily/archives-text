# Crew finishes third in Newport Regatta
## 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
First their bus broke down.
Then the men's second boat hit
a water marker and split in half
while warming up, leaving the
boat useless and its oarsmen
grounded.
Such painful setbacks left
the entire crew team rather
unnerved at Sunday's Newport
Regatta in Newport, Calif.
The men's first boat finished
in third place out of 18 partici
pating teams, clocking in at 16
minutes, 10 seconds. The
National Rowing Center, a club
of national team members,
came in first with a time of
15:38, followed by California
and then Stanford, who fin
ished six seconds behind the
Golden Bears.
The men's third boat, which
felt the pressure to make up for
the second boat's untimely
mishap, finished in 12th place
among the varsity boats.
In their first race of the sea
son, the women fared somewhat
better by coming in third place

with their first boat, behind Cal
and University of San Diego.
The women's team further
proved its worth by bringing its
second boat into the upper
ranks of the competing teams
with their sixth-place finish,
behind UCLA and Cal State-
Long Beach.
"We had good rhythm and
were powerful," said first-boat
coxswain Michelle Gail.
This Sunday will pit the Car
dinal against Cal for the final
time this season. The Stanford
Regatta, to be held in San
Mateo, will also feature the Uni
versity of Victoria, whose speed
rivals that of top-ranked Brown.
"There's no question we
want to win first place," men's
crew coach Wieslaw Kujda said.
His strategy for this weekend is
for the boats to keep an even
pace throughout the race, even
at the expense of initial speed.
Ten Cardinal boats will par
ticipate in the Stanford Regatta
this year, and, for the first
time, freshman boats will par
ticipate in a head race alongside
varsity boats.
