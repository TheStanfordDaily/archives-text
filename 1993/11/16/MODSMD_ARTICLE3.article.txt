# More stadium fixes for World Cup?

### Diane Chen 
In preparation for the 1994 World
Cup soccer tournament, Athletics De
partment and World Cup officials are dis
cussing a plan to cover the rocks and de
bris beneath the seats at Stanford Stadi
um with a fresh layer of concrete.
World Cup officials have expressed
concern about the loose rocks beneath
the bleachers, which are not only un
sightly, but could be thrown around by
rowdy spectators.
According to John Davis, director of
facilities and operations of the Athletics
Department, "to shoot the whole area
with concrete" would be the ideal solu
tion because it would make the stadium
much easier to keep clean. The rock and
debris beneath the seats is biodegrad

able, Davis said, and a new layer of con
crete would simply blanket the stadium
floor.
However, paving the stadium also car
ries a hefty price tag, which is "well up in
the six figures," Davis said. But he feels
the price would be worth it, considering
the economic benefit the soccer tourna
ment would have on Stanford and the
community.
Athletic Director Ted Leland said that
because the plan to pave the stadium is
still under consideration, a source of
funding has not yet been determined.
But he added that the Board of Trustees
recently approved a $12.5 million fund
raising drive for the stadium.
A variety of stadium renovations for
the upcoming tournament are already
under way, said Jim Brown, director of

operations at the World Cup office in
Santa Clara. These are being paid for by
World Cup soccer.
The wooden bleachers have been re
placed with metal ones, which are "stur
dier, safer and nicer-looking," Brown
said. In addition, a balcony has been
added to the first level of the press box,
locker rooms are being renovated, and
the floor in the concourse below the press
box is being replaced.
Students from Palo Alto high schools
also participated recently in a more im
mediate solution to the problem of rocks
and debris at the stadium.
Ron Cooper, a teacher at Gunn High
School and a former soccer coach, coordi
nated an effort in which local high school
students came to help clean Stan
ford Stadium one day in October.
About 40 students from Palo Alto
high schools donned gloves, grabbed
shovels and rakes, and spent 4
hours combing under the press box
for "everything from peanut shells
to rocks," Cooper said.
Cooper estimated that about 5
tons of debris were deposited in

dumpsters supplied by the Uni
versity.
For their efforts, the student
volunteers received T-shirts from
the World Cup organization, lunch
from McDonald's and free dinner
tickets from Hobee's restaurant.
"We may be back, we may not
— but it's an experiment that def
initely worked," Cooper said.
Brown said that even though the
project "took a lot of man power," it
was still "very successful," and
World Cup officials are considering
doing it again in the spring.
