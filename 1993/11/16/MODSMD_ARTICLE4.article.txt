# Student education group defines goals
## Leaders plan campus polls, discussions 
### Tish Williams Senior staff writer 
Agreeing to be "both proactive and reac
tive" in its activities, the Student Advisory
Group on Undergraduate Education set
forth its statement of purpose last night at
its second formal meeting of the year.
About 15 students gathered at Mariposa
House to discuss the group's goals and other
issues that the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education will address this week. The
student advisory group will formally pre
sent its goals to the commission tomorrow.
The group's objectives include raising
student awareness, stimulating discussion
on issues concerning undergraduate educa
tion and officially presenting student input
in the form of quantitative studies and on
going reports of student discussions.

COP member Ying-Ying Goh, one of the
group's leaders, said the student advisory
group has decided both to initiate their own
projects and respond to the commission's
work.
"We're trying to make SAGUE both
proactive and reactive," she said. "It's going
to be necessary to react to the ideas and pro
posals the commission throws out, but we
don't want to limit our function during the
review process. We'll also take student
opinion and present it to the commission."
According to senior Eddie Garcia, the
group's other leader, the only goal which
met with logistical concerns was the quan
titative study of student opinion.
Garcia and Goh have decided to ask Prof.
James Sheehan, the commission's chair,
for additional funds to hire an out
side individual to conduct polls.
"We're out of our league to under
take the survey part," Garcia said.
The group also defined an
administrative structure for itself
last night. In order to be more

effective, it will be sectioned off
into three subgroups: a general
assembly, a steering committee
and an administrative group.
The general assembly will
include those members of the stu
dent body who attend the open
community meetings.
The steering committee, headed
by Goh and Garcia, will include the
commission's student representa
tives along with student members

of any subcommittees — which
will be announced after the com
mission decides which issues it will
study. A "historian," who will
serve as a secretary for the group,
will also be on the steering com
mittee.
The group also announced that
it is developing an application for
students interested in serving on
the University commission's sub
committees. The application is

being developed with the help of
the ASSU nominations committee.
In contrast to last week's meet
ing, in which students expressed
serious concerns about the effec
tiveness and purpose of the group,
last night's participants got past
abstract discussions and touched on
a number of the issues the commis
sion will address on Friday, includ
ing faculty advising, Residential
Education and teaching evaluation.
