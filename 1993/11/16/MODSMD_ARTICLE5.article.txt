# Grad student increase stretches resources
## Rise in admissions crowds housing, classes 
### Michael Slemmer Staff Writer 
While an increased enrollment of master's
students helped University graduate schools
mitigate the budget shortfalls of two years
ago, this move has also resulted in the crowd
ing of both graduate housing and classes.
"The most visible effect has been in grad
student housing," said George Dekker, as
sociate dean of graduate policy. "I've also
heard rumors of increased numbers of stu
dents affecting class size."
According to Jim Plummer, associate
dean for academic affairs in the School of
Engineering, cutbacks were necessary dur
ing the previous budget-cutting process.
Seeking to enhance their income in the
face of the University's $43 million deficit
reduction process, the graduate schools
chose to increase their admission of mas

ter's students by about 10 percent.
"Basically, you can either reduce your
expenses or increase your income," Plum
mer said. "We made significant reductions,
and increased the income side by increasing
the number of admitted students."
The schools received between $1 million
and $3 million in tuition from the extra stu
dents admitted under the policy which
went into effect last fall.
Dekker said that in some cases, it was impos
sible for departments to cut spending. "They
just didn't have faculty that could be eliminated.
"It was difficult for some departments to
meet their budget targets in any other way"
than by adding students, he added.
Though the increase brings only about
250 more students to campus each year,
both students and faculty agreed that the
increased enrollment has been
accompanied by its share of prob
lems.
"Clearly there is a continuing
impact that can't be ignored in
graduate housing," Dekker said.
"The main problem is that we
have a policy of providing housing
to all new grad students."
Since most master's programs
last only one year, all of the new stu
dents must be guaranteed housing
under current University policy.
In addition, "there are more
graduate students who want to
live on campus than there were a
few years ago," Dekker said.

"The addition of a couple hun
dred new first-year grad students
has unquestionably made the prob
lem more acutely felt," he said,
adding that the University has been
forced to convert housing initially
intended for families to accommo
date the flux in first-year students.
This decline in housing avail
ability led some students to seek
off-campus options. Krista Jacob
sen, a third-year electrical engi
neering student, said that since
she was assigned to a less desirable
housing option — the Manzanita
trailers — she moved off campus.
Dekker admitted that such
sentiments may lead the adminis
tration to change its first-year
housing policy.
But housing isn't the only area
that's been affected by the increase

in students. The policy "makes it
even harder for students to per
form academically," Jacobsen said.
While Plummer agreed that
"there's no question that it's had
some impact on the depart
ments," he argued that students
should not feel impacts.
"I would say we've always had
people saying, 'Gee, my class is too
big,' " said Ronald Hanson, chair
of the Mechanical Engineering
Department. "There have always
been those types of comments.
"What's more noticeable Ithan
an overall increase in students] is
when students rapidly decide they
like one area of engineering," he
added.
But Jeffrey Ullman, chair of
the Computer Science Depart
ment, felt the policy "has had

some negative impacts."
"This year there were more
master's students who couldn't
get (teaching assistant] positions
than in past years," he said.
The increased enrollment has
also created difficulties for stu
dents interested in pursuing doc
torates after receiving their mas
ter's degrees.
"I know several people who
passed the (doctorate] qualifying
exams but couldn't continue
because they couldn't get an
adviser or funding," Jacobsen
said. "Because there are more stu
dents, it lessens the chances of
getting a Ph.D."
Jacobsen said, "I just hope
they think carefully before
(increasing the number of stu
dents] again."
