# Med School researchers develop lupus treatment

### Gina Lee Staff writer 
Researchers at the School of Medicine ap
pear to have developed a revolutionary hor
mone treatment that alleviates symptoms of
the autoimmune disorder lupus erythemato
sus without causing serious side effects.
Dr. Ronald van Vollenhoven, a clinical
instructor in the Department of Medicine,
presented the preliminary results of the
lupus treatment last week at a meeting of
the American College of Rheumatology in
San Antonio, Texas.
"The reaction of the audience, many of
them lupus experts, was encouraging and
we plan to continue research on the treat
ment," van Vollenhoven said.

During the three-month preliminary
study, sponsored by the Northern Califor
nia Arthritis Foundation and the Bay Area
Lupus Foundation, researchers produced
capsules containing high levels of the hor
mone, dehydroepiandrosterone, or DHEA,
that were taken by 30 infected patients.
This hormone is normally produced by a
healthy person's adrenal glands.
"We know that many people with lupus
have unusually low levels of this hormone, so
we thought that boosting the levels of the hor
mone might alleviate some of the symptoms
of the disease," van Vollenhoven said.
Common lupus symptoms — including
breathing difficulty, fever, joint pain and
rashes — improved in at least 25
percent of the patients taking DHEA
capsules, van Vollenhoven said.
Lupus results when a person's
immune system attacks the
body's connective tissues, includ
ing the skin, muscles, joints and
sometimes internal organs. The

intensity of the disease varies
depending on the patient.
Lupus targets nine times as
many women as men and usually
strikes during child-bearing years.
It is prevalent among African
Americans, Asian Americans,
Latinos and Native Americans. In
these groups, as many as one in
250 women contracts the disease.
Previously fatal, lupus is cur
rently treated with corticosteroid
drugs. While the drugs increase a

patient's life expectancy, they have
severe side effects, causing the
patient to become more susceptible
to infections, weight gain, high
blood pressure and bone thinning.
"Right now, the DHEA treat
ment looks a lot safer than corti
costeroids in terms of side
effects," van Vollenhoven said.
"Our treatment may not affect
mortality, but we are optimistic it
will enhance the quality of life."
The only negative side effect of

the DHEA treatment was acne,
which approximately 60 percent of
the patients reported. Although it
is treatable with topical ointments,
researchers also suspect that lower
doses of DHEA might still combat
the disease but eliminate the acne.
Van Vollenhoven said the
researchers are planning to con
duct a broad, year-long study of
the treatment before submitting
their findings to the Food and
Drug Administration.
