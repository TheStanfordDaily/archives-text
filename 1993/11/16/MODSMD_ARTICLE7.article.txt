# Beware of falling rocks
## 'Random acts of violence' strike residences 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
A few campus residents and the
Stanford police may be asking
themselves, "Who was that
masked man?" after rocks were
thrown through student dormito
ry windows in two separate inci
dents this weekend.
Two rocks simultaneously
crashed through windows in the
common room of senior Pete
Blum's second-floor suite in Grif
fin House around midnight on
Sunday, while he was studying
there with three other students.
Blum said the bizarre incident
began when a man dressed in
black and wearing a "Lone Ranger
bandanna" around his head
knocked on his door around 10:30
Sunday night.
Blum said the man asked for se
nior Ken Baerenklau, president of
the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity,

who does not live in the Suites.
When Blum asked the man why he
was looking for Baerenklau, the
man replied, "It's a prank."
Rocks also crashed through the
lobby window of Roth House early
Sunday morning, according to Stan
ford Police Sgt. John McMullen.
McMullen was reluctant to at
tribute the incidents to any partic
ular person or to assume the inci
dents were related.
No one was injured in either in
cident and police have been unable
to locate a suspect.
Blum said the incident took
everyone completely by surprise.
"At first we thought maybe the
radio was on too loud," he said. "It
was kind of scary. ... It was a ran
dom act of violence."
McMullen said that such occur
rences are "kind of seasonal,"
oflen increasing around finals or
other times when "pressure here
at school" increases.
