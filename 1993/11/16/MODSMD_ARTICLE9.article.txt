A little surprise greeted EAST House residents
early Sunday morning.
Stanford Police evacuated the dormitory at 2:30
a.m. after a suspicious-looking object — initially be
lieved to be a bomb — was found under a stairwell.
According to senior Joanna Lin, the phony bomb
consisted of a piece of clay-like material attached to a
digital timer. The device was placed inconspicuously
on a bar under the stairs.
Lin had first noticed the object on Friday as she was
leaving the residence. "It looked weird. It looked like
something out of 'MacGvver,'" she said. Saturday
night, she notified house manager John Hwang, who
then called police.
The "hoax device consisted of inert materials," and
was quickly discarded by Stanford Police, said Sgt.
Richard Tipton. He believes the poorly constructed
decoy was meant to be a prank, but police have no sus
pects.
Students were allowed to re-enter EAST House at
3:40 a.m.
