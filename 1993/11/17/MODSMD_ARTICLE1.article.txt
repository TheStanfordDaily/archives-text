# Edited version of women faculty study causes concern
## 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Several faculty members are upset
over a decision made by Provost Con
doleezza Rice to remove descriptive quo
tations from a recently completed report
on the status of female faculty.
The original report of the Provost's
Committee on the Recruitment and Re
tention of Women Faculty, which was
produced for Rice, contained both posi
tive and negative quotes from anony
mous male and female faculty members
in several departments describing their
experiences as faculty at Stanford.
But in a later version of the report
designated for the public, about 20 per
cent of the original text was cut. The de
cision — made by the provost and sup
ported by half of the committee — is a
move that some critics claim was made

solely to protect the
University's image.
But supporters counter
that it was done to en
sure the anonymity of
many sources whose
quotes would identify
them.
The issue was
brought to light earlier
this week when a

Hoover Institution fellow wrote an op-ed
piece in a local newspaper criticizing the
decision to edit the quotations. Several
committee members have also voiced
displeasure at the editing, saying that
without the actual words of the faculty
who were interviewed, the report will
not receive the kind of attention it de
serves.
John Bunzel, a Hoover fellow and for
mer president of San Jose State, wrote a

piece titled "Are Women Faculty Wel
come at Stanford?" for Monday's edition
of the San Francisco Chronicle, after ac
cidentally receiving a copy of the unedit
ed report from a temporary worker in
the provost's office.
The committee found that junior fac
ulty — both men and women — were
not well cared for in several of the Uni
versity's departments. This had an espe
cially negative effect on the number of
women faculty Stanford could attract
and retain. Sexual harassment, gender
based salary inequities and the difficul
ties of holding a strenuous job while rais
ing a family also contributed to the prob
lem, the report stated.
Although the bulk of Bunzel's article
focused on the findings of the commit
tee's report, controversy has arisen over


Rice
the last few paragraphs of his piece.
"The committee's 82-page report
exemplifies the members' sense of
fairness and proportion. It deserves
wide distribution and careful study
— which is why it is discouraging to
learn that the provost's office
intends to release only an edited ver
sion. Yet in late September, the deci
sion was made to release the full
document. That decision has now
been reversed," Bunzel wrote.
Bunzel said the decision to
release only the edited version was
"foolish and counterproductive."
He added that he believed it was
impossible for a reader to identify
the speakers.
According to the report, the
quotes included everything from
common complaints about low
salaries to explicit descriptions of
sexual harassment and other prob
lems that faculty members of both
sexes have faced at Stanford.
For example, one woman
recounted how she was made to feel
uncomfortable by her department
chair, who kept pornographic mag
azines in plain view.
Another said she did not have
any sense that "Stanford cared
about me as a person" after she was
forced to wait a full day before she
was informed of a tenure commit
tee's decision.
There is no dispute among com
mittee members that — because the
report was originally intended for
the provost — it was her prerogative
to edit it and to ask the committee to
help her make the cuts. Many com
mittee members feel that the rea

sons for editing the report are legiti
mate. But others believe that an
edited report will not do the job.
Rice said that, in fact, she has
the right not to release the report to
the public at all. However, Rice said
she felt the findings were "of suffi
cient import" that she went "to
great lengths to make sure they
were available to be discussed."
The main problem with the orig
inal report, Rice said, was that
many committee members had
operated with the belief that the
findings would only be seen by the
provost's office and would not be
released to the public. Although
every attempt was made to disguise
the identities of the faculty mem
bers interviewed, speakers are still
identifiable in some cases.
Rice said that after the report was
submitted to her, she and Education
Prof. Myra Strober, the chair of the
committee and an academic associate
dean in the School of Education,
agreed to make the findings available
to the Faculty Women's Caucus.
But when the University Cabinet
examined the original report, several
deans pointed out that the sources of
some of the quotes, though anony
mous, were identifiable.
Rice said she went back to the
committee members to discuss this
matter with them.
"[Rice] felt she would have the
final say, but she genuinely wanted
the committee's advice," said
Strober.
The committee was divided over
whether or not to excise the quotes.
"There are some members who
thought that the entire document
should be made public. But about
half felt that if this had been the orig
inal intent, things would have been
done differently," said Physics Prof.

Steve Chu, a committee member.
Law School Dean Paul Brest,
another member of the committee,
explained that, because the report
was intended only for the provost,
"the committee had never thought
to ask the people being interviewed
if their statements could be used."
But anonymity had already been
promised, Chu said. "During inter
views, we promised people we
would not identify them, and
ensured confidentiality," he said.
"We didn't use names, but it came
to our attention that some people
could be recognized."
In addition, Chu said that com
mittee members were concerned
that the quotes made the report too
negative, and didn't provide enough
representation of all opinions.
On the other hand, Strober said
that even without quotes, the
report remains effective. "I feel that
some things [in the University! will
be changed, because the report is
well balanced and concrete," she
said. "No doubt a vividness is lost
with the quotes, but weighed
against the possibility that some
body who didn't want to be identi
fied could be identified, the
poignancy takes a back seat."
Still, many feel that the report
loses its power without the quotes.
"We argued that the Faculty
Senate and the department chairs
would not really understand the
nature of the problem unless they
really heard what was said," said
English Prof. Regenia Gagnier,
another committee member.
Gagnier said she believes that
the editing had less to do with the
danger of identifying specific speak
ers than with a concern for the Uni
versity's image.
"[The question of identity]

wasn't a problem when we spent
several months talking about the
methodology of interviewing. I
don't think most people were wor
ried," she said, adding that many of
the faculty interviewed really want
ed their voices to be heard.
Instead, Gagnier said she
believes the editing "probably has
as much to do with a concern for
Stanford's image — what can be
known internally to Stanford
should not be known publicly."
As a result of the editing, Gag
nier said that the report probably
will not be as powerful or effective.
"If you really want a sense of
what it's like for men and women
faculty here, you need the report in
total. Since we're talking about peo
ple's experience, having their words
is crucial. Statistics won't show you
[the same thing]," she said.
Gagnier's sentiments were
echoed by other people who had
seen the unedited report.
"The quotes are an important
part of the report; they make it
more human. There is a tremen
dous amount of denial that there is
any problem. If we don't give emo
tionality to the report, the 'deniers'
will continue to deny," said Frances
Conley, a professor of neurosurgery
who gained national attention after
she exposed incidents of sexual
harassment at the Medical School
two years ago.
Conley added that she believed
the quotes were "inattributable."
Bunzel said that he may still
take further steps to ensure that
others see the unedited version of
the report.
"If this foolishness persists, I
may have to consider making this
document available — in a brown
paper bag," he said jokingly.
