# Edited version of women faculty study causes concern
## 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Several faculty members are upset
over a decision made by Provost Con
doleezza Rice to remove descriptive quo
tations from a recently completed report
on the status of female faculty.
The original report of the Provost's
Committee on the Recruitment and Re
tention of Women Faculty, which was
produced for Rice, contained both posi
tive and negative quotes from anony
mous male and female faculty members
in several departments describing their
experiences as faculty at Stanford.
But in a later version of the report
designated for the public, about 20 per
cent of the original text was cut. The de
cision — made by the provost and sup
ported by half of the committee — is a
move that some critics claim was made

solely to protect the
University's image.
But supporters counter
that it was done to en
sure the anonymity of
many sources whose
quotes would identify
them.
The issue was
brought to light earlier
this week when a

Hoover Institution fellow wrote an op-ed
piece in a local newspaper criticizing the
decision to edit the quotations. Several
committee members have also voiced
displeasure at the editing, saying that
without the actual words of the faculty
who were interviewed, the report will
not receive the kind of attention it de
serves.
John Bunzel, a Hoover fellow and for
mer president of San Jose State, wrote a

piece titled "Are Women Faculty Wel
come at Stanford?" for Monday's edition
of the San Francisco Chronicle, after ac
cidentally receiving a copy of the unedit
ed report from a temporary worker in
the provost's office.
The committee found that junior fac
ulty — both men and women — were
not well cared for in several of the Uni
versity's departments. This had an espe
cially negative effect on the number of
women faculty Stanford could attract
and retain. Sexual harassment, gender
based salary inequities and the difficul
ties of holding a strenuous job while rais
ing a family also contributed to the prob
lem, the report stated.
Although the bulk of Bunzel's article
focused on the findings of the commit
tee's report, controversy has arisen over


Rice
