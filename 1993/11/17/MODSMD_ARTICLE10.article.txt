The Stanford Solar Car Project
blazed to a respectable 14th- place
finish Saturday in the World Solar
Challenge, an 1,800-mile race of
solar-powered vehicles in Australia.
The 12-person team competed
against 50 other teams, and man
aged to finish fifth out of the colle
giate entries in what Jason
Garoutte, a junior in mechanical
engineering who worked on the
project, called "the Super Bowl of
solar car races."
According to junior Charles
Nickel, another project member,
the team had hoped to finish far
ther ahead but was generally
pleased with their performance.

Despite setbacks — including a
fire that damaged the car last
spring — the group managed to
complete their entry, the Sunburn
er, in time for the race, which
began Nov. 7 in Darwin and ended
in Adelaide.

The team consisted of four
drivers and a support crew that
included students and Electrical
Engineering Prof. Emeritus
William Kinchloe. Team members
paid for most of their own trans
portation costs, with funds from
their ASSU special fee request tak
ing care of shipping the car itself to
Australia.

According to Garoutte, the
rules were relatively uncomplicat
ed; the race ran every day from 9

a.m. until 5 p.m., when the team
would have 10 minutes to find a
campsite for the night. The first
to reach Adelaide would win.
An entry from the Honda Cor
poration won the race, devastating
records previously held by General
Motors' Sunraycer vehicle.
Garoutte noted that several of the
entries beat the record times by six
to nine hours.
"The technology is really
improving race by race," he said.
With this year's race behind
them, the group is already looking
to the future. As its older members
graduate, Garoutte said, the project
expects its younger members to pre
pare a new entry for the 1995 Sun
rayce from Texas to Minnesota.
