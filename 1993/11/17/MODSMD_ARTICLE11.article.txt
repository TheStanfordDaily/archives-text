Rower's time runs short
LONDON (AP) â€” British adventurer Peter
Bird thought he could row from Russia to San
Francisco in six months. But he's still in the mid
dle of the Pacific Ocean and he's running out of
food.
The 46-year-old solo rower, plagued by terrible
weather and adverse winds, has wasted weeks
going in circles and even backwards since he left
Vladivostok in Russia's Far East on May 12.
Over the past six months he has capsized five
times and traveled more than 3,000 miles in his
28-foot rowboat, Sector Two. But he's only made
1,300 miles of progress.
Bird, who had supplies for 200 days, told his
English support team in a satellite phone call
Nov. 1 that he would run out of food on Nov. 20.
At his current pace, Bird should arrive in the
United States in March or April. He would be the
first person to row solo across the Pacific in both
directions.
