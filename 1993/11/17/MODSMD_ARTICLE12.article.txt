# Clinton rallies last-minute NAFTA support
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Seizing the
momentum on the eve of a House show
down, President Clinton won a rush of
converts yesterday for the North Ameri
can Free Trade Agreement while oppo
nents accused the White House of doling
out billions to line up support.
An Associated Press survey showed
209 House members supporting the pact
or likely to do so — a one-day gain of 18.
In contrast, opponents' numbers dwin
dled by three, and stood at 199.
"NAFTA is something the United
States must do to retain economic leader
ship in the world, and I am concerned that
if we reject NAFTA, this country will not
have smother opportunity," said Rep. Jan
Meyers, R-Kan., one of four lawmakers
who switched from opposition to support
during the day.
Clinton's lobbying campaign was
prodigious, from one-on-one meetings
and phone calls with Democrats to sooth
ing words for Republicans nervous about

backing the agreement.
"Congress has simply got to vote for
hope over fear, for the future over the
past. They've got to vote for confidence in
the ability of the American people to com
pete and win," he*told the nation's gover
nors yesterday, summoned to the White
House to provide evidence of widespread
support for the pact.
But opponents were biting in their
criticism of such tactics. Rep. Gerald
Solomon, R-N.Y., distributed a two-page
List of deals the administration was said to
have made, ranging from protection for
the textile and asparagus industries to a
new center for Western Hemispheric
Trade in Texas.
An administration official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said all the deal
making hadn't cost the Treasury any
money. But Ross Perot, the pact's most
vocal critic, called it the "biggest purchase
of votes in our country's history with tax
payer money."

Giving political cover to Republicans,
Clinton wrote to GOP House leader Bob
Michel that it would be inappropriate to
campaign against candidates in 1994 on
the basis of their support for the agree
ment.
The accord is designed to create a free
trade zone for Mexico, Canada and the
United States by reducing tariffs over 15
years.
Supporters say the pact would open a
vast new Mexican market for American
industries and serve as a linchpin for
broader agreements involving other coun
tries in the hemisphere and Asia and
Europe as well.
Opponents, from Perot to organized
labor, say thousands of jobs will be lost as
American firms move factories south to
take advantage of lower wages and less
strict environmental standards in Mexi
co.
Several members of United We Stand,
a Perot-backed organization that opposes

the pact, complained after being denied
admission to a closed-door session where
Florida lawmakers met with the state's
major agriculture interests.
Asked if a majority of the House yet
supported the accord, Clinton said,
"We're getting there."
His optimism was echoed by leading
congressional supporters.
"I'm confident and I'm not in it to
lose," said GOP leader Michel, part of an
unlikely coalition of Democrats and
Republicans working to surmount still
opposition from labor-backed Democrats.
The AP survey showed 182 lawmakers
counted as firmly opposed and 17 leaning
against. The remaining 24 were undecid
ed in the House, where the White House
needs 218 votes to prevail.
Some opponents conceded the slip
page. Solomon said 210 were firm against
the treaty — more than the AP count but
well short of the 220 or so the opposition
had claimed earlier in the week.
