riors." While this name
JL may conjure images of
an expensive sci-fi NBC series, it is
actually what one member of the
Council of Presidents labeled the
ASSU senators after last week's
senate walkout.
Only 11 of 37 senators re
mained at the meeting after a
debate turned into a shouting
match, complete with profanity.
Some senators said they left
because the debate had lost its
focus.
The walkout may have been jus
tifiable — there is no reason to
participate in a debate which has
lost its purpose.
However, if the meetings were
run more effectively to begin with,
senators would have no reason to
leave. Furthermore, meeting lead
ers must give every senator a
chance to speak.
But the fault does not lie solely

in the leadership of the meetings;
the senators themselves must
realize that if they want to com
municate student concerns to the
administration and be taken seri
ously, they must handle them
selves maturely.
COP member Ron Brown said
senators are frustrated with deal
ing with trivial issues. But react
ing to frustration via walkouts
hurts the senate's reputation and
gives it less credibility.
Perhaps the senators them
selves need to take a greater role
in shaping the legislation that
they discuss. How many have
actually authored a bill that met
their criteria of non-triviality?
Antics like those witnessed
Tuesday night may be entertain
ing for some, but they certainly do
not receive good ratings from the
students nor the University
administrators the senators are
trying to influence.
