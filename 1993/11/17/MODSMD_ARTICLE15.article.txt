# Calling all cultures

NON-denominational ethnic
ity. It is a welcome addition
to the campus' multicultur
al community, and the new student
group Cross Cultures should be
applauded for their efforts in pro
moting this idea.
While there is certainly a need
for distinct ethnic organizations,
there is also room for groups such
as Cross Cultures which advocate
interaction among these different
communities. This interaction
encourages campus unity, some
thing that is always beneficial to
Stanford.
Members of Cross Cultures
founded the group in order to
bring students from different
backgrounds together to so that
they could learn about each other's
history, society and culture. Each
event they coordinate accentuates
a different community, but
remains open to all.
For example, Cross Cultures
recently held a mask-making ses

sion to celebrate the Chicano holi
day Di'a de los Muertos and orga
nized an event to commemorate
the Japanese internment camps of
World War 11.
These types of activities are not
new in themselves — indeed, each
ethnic community has always
strived to teach others about
themselves through such events.
But as a self-proclaimed non
denominational ethnic group,
Cross Cultures necessarily offers
participants a different perspec
tive than what they would get
through a culture-specific organi
zation.
In this way, groups such as
Cross Cultures serve a valuable
purpose in the campus community,
bridging the divide among stu
dents from different ethnic back
grounds and helping them to
understand and view cultures in a
variety of ways.
Perhaps this is what multicul
turalism is all about.
