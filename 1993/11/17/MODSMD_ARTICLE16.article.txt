## Words can limit meanings 
### 
THE FIRST present I'll give my
child will be the largest dictionary
that I can find, and I'll say Here.
Here is the English language. Do with it
what you can. And though I'll be giving
her one of the greatest possible gifts, I
will also be aware of how inadequate it
really is — that those words, no matter
how well she chooses and combines
them, will never sufficiently communi
cate the intricacies and breadth of her
mind.
As she gets older, I will give her my
library of books — I'll introduce her to
the Greeks, the Russians, a few of the
French. She will become well acquainted
with the greatest minds of this century,
which by then will have passed, as sound
lessly and effortlessly as the rest.
Arid of course, I will give her all of the
poets. I'll watch as she burns her reading
lamp late into the night, learning the
tricks of those who came before.
Soon, when her ideas play themselves
into symphonies and her emotions
crescendo towards delirium, she'll sit
down to write. It's then she'll realize
that there are only tricks: even the
sharpest metaphor will not capture for
others that precise thing which she
needs to say.
If I know all of this it's because I am
telling you my story, perhaps your
story too. For while language enables
us to share in and of each other's lives,

it is also leads to estrangement. Unfor
tunately, it is one of the only tools we
have to assist us in the communication
of thought. Expressing emotion is
made only slightly easier by the use of
expressions and gestures; but even
these fail us.
Imagine a scene which must have
played itself out in your own life, perhaps
countless times: you are alone with
another, separated by only a foot of
space. More than anything, you want to
drag them into the pit of your being,
inside your exterior shell so that for a
moment they might feel the deluge of
images, memories and emotions which
pour through your mind and body.
Yet, all that you can do is form words
that you've heard spoken before, that you
think might express something of what is
happening within you. You become
acutely aware of the chasm of space
which separates you, a gap so infinitely
wide that no bridge of words can ever be
built to cross it.
Think of the misunderstandings
you've had with people over words one
of you spoke — times when your inten
tions were misinterpreted once
expressed, times when you thought
someone was saying one thing when
really they were saying just the opposite.
Or remember how you wanted to com
fort a grieving friend, but all the words
you chose sounded flat and useless.

Recall an idea which came to you in such
a brilliant and complex light that you
were unable to articulate it, feeling it
catch in your throat when you opened
your mouth.
This is what I mean by estrangement:
the words are just too few, too used and
too simple to describe what goes on in the
human heart and mind. Even those
words we do have hold such very differ
ent meanings for each of us that it is
amazing that we can communicate any
thing at all.
Borges wrote "any noun — man,
money, Thursday, Wednesday, rain —
has only metaphorical value." Our per
sonal experiences are so varied. Who is to
say if we are speaking about the same
thing when we utter the word rain?
Try as I might, I can't tie this column
up with a contented little bow as is so
often required. Even now, I am aware
that the words I choose will hardly cap
ture and communicate to you all that is
spinning through my mind. My words are
only the empty symbols of the blood and
voice and breath of my inner world. They
are simply metaphors for what I am real
ly trying to say.

Nicole Krauss hopes to have lots of poetic
children.
