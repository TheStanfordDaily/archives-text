## WCT lecturers explain freshman program's importance 
### 
IT IS difficult for those of us who
teach courses in Writing and Critical
Thinking to recognize our work as
described in the pejorative terms of a
recent Daily article: impractical and
redundant. Defining our goals and meth
ods can make clear why the embarrass
ingly uninformed advice about restruc
turing the program is irrelevant to what
is actually being accomplished.
First-year English is not designed sole
ly to prepare Stanford students to per
form well in their meyor fields of study;
many of them have not decided what that
specialization may be. Our purpose is far
reaching: we concentrate on teaching
Stanford's intelligent and ambitious stu
dents to read and think critically, to
observe, to search and discover (both in
the complex systems of our libraries and
outside of them), to evaluate, to compare,
to speculate, to gather and test the credi
bility and sufficiency of evidence, to
argue, to detect fallacies in the reasoning
of others and in their own, to examine
other points of view, to give and take
objective criticism and to publish their
findings persuasively in lucid, lively,
uncluttered and logical writing free of the

mechanical errors which would distract
the reader. They write and rewrite in var
ied styles for varied purposes.
We encourage them to be skeptical
and imaginative, cautious and bold. We
help them to cultivate in themselves the
best talents of good detectives and
lawyers. And, as they develop such
skills, we show them how to become
their own editor-critics and to begin to
enjoy using the power of language to
accomplish whatever intellectual tasks
they assume, both in university life and
afterwards. (One of our colleagues has
been hired to teach similar classes to
decision makers outside the University.)
We believe that WCT is one of the
most important courses in the Universi
ty. Mastering its principles and the men
tal habits it requires is obviously practi
cal, but, more importantly, mastering
them is obligatory if students are to grow
intellectually and to join the community
of writers in every Stanford department
and to go on to another creative life.
What are the dynamics of these
courses at their best? By writing and
rewriting students discover what they
think and feel and believe; they explore a

variety of interests. I think of the pre
med student who, to begin his research,
voluntarily experienced a grueling 36
hours accompanying an emergency car
diology team at Stanford Hospital. He
then went on to consult medical jour
nals, to interview doctors and medical
students and to write, with fair-minded
balance, a layman's essay considering
the controversial question: What is the
value of long and stressed duty hours for
interns? I think of the student who con
sulted both primary and secondary
sources to write the life story of her
Indian grandfather whom she never
knew; he had been a headmaster in
India in the historic last days of the Raj.
Her paper was translated into Hindi and
published in a large Indian newspaper. I
think of a student who is currently fasci
nated by what he is discovering about
his self-chosen research topic — Ameri
can Vigilantes. Predictably, he is consid
ering studying law. I could make a long
list of equally interesting papers which
taught students the pleasures and frus
trations of research.
Encouraging and supervising such
projects and teaching reading, thinking,

and writing at a college entry level is
technical and professional work; it is
also a human and humane activity. My
colleagues and I are aware of individual
student potential as well as of what stu
dents need to learn; we exercise pressure
and provide support. We encourage
them by the positive reminder that they
were accepted at Stanford, a research
institution, because the Office of Admis
sions believed that they (out of many
bright applicants) would make discover
ies — perhaps significant ones — and
that they will need to be able to present
these in effective ways.
No other program has the time or the
specialists for such, highly personal
teaching of thinking and writing.
Because of our intensive methods we
know our students. We receive constant
proof of this; they keep in touch. And
year after year the best of them return
for the references they need for admis
sion to law, medical or graduate school
or for job applications. "Because," they
often say, "you know my name. And you
can tell them how my mind works."
