# Suggestions made for keeping Big Game safe
## 
### 
Since last spring, a Big Game Commit
tee composed of students and staff from
UC-Berkeley and Stanford have met to
plan for the 1993 Big Game. The Commit
tee is asking the members of both univer
sity communities and their supporters to
work to ensure that our historic rivalry
remains fun, friendly, and full of the spirit
of competition that has marked this event
since 1892. By taking the following simple
steps, you can go a long way to achieving
this goal:

• enter Stanford Stadium early to er\joy
the new pre-game activity
planned by both universities;
• please do not bring alcohol into the
stadium and, if you do drink before the
game, please drink moderately;
• please do not throw objects during
the game;
• remain in the stands throughout the
game; and
• root with enthusiasm and good will
for the Golden Bears and the Cardinal.
By following these procedures we can
maintain one of the most distinguished
rivalries in Division I athletic competi
tion, between two great academic insti
tutions.
The Big Game Committee has met

under the auspices of Chancellor Chang-
Lin Tien of the UC-Berkeley and Presi
dent Gerhard Casper of Stanford Uni
versity. Both are committed to preserv
ing the character of undergraduate com
petition that has marked the history of
the Big Game. In recent years, competi
tion has been so intense that on occasion
we have seen fans lose some of the spirit
of mutual respect that is appropriate for
these institutions.
This year at our tailgates, rallies,
reunions, and other Big Game activities,
let's dedicate ourselves to the friendly
rivalry and competition which has lifted
the Big Game into the lore of college ath
letics. We do not want to see, by chance
or circumstance, the kind of tragedy

which recently occurred at the Universi
ty of Wisconsin at a moment when there
should have been celebration. On behalf
of both universities, we join you in hop
ing for a memorable day of good cheer
for the Blue and Gold and Cardinal and
White.
