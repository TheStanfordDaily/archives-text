# Rare animals call the Farm home

Move over, tiger salamander. Now
there's something even slimier. The
red-legged frog, for instance. Or the
western pond turtle. Or the vernal
pool fairy shrimp. Or the ground
cricket.
While Lake Lagunita's most fa
mous resident has hogged the head
lines for its role in the cancellation of
the Big Game Bonfire, other endan
gered, threatened or protected species
that make Stanford their home are
also making their presence felt.
"There is a tremendous diversity of
itty-bitty species that nobody's ever
seen before," said Alan Launer of
Stanford's Center for Conservation
Biology.
Although none of these other ani
mals immediately threatens to create
as large a furor as that surrounding
the tiger salamander, those which are
officially listed as endangered, threat
ened or possibly in need of special
protection could affect land usage at
the University.
Launer said that the species likeli
est to cause changes in Stanford's
land-use policy is the red-legged frog,
a tiny, federally-protected amphibian
which makes its home on the banks of
San Francisquito and Matadero
Creeks and in nearby woods and
grasslands. Currently, the frog is list
ed as a "candidate one" subspecies,
which means that it has been deter
mined to warrant protection. But the
paperwork required for further con
servatory steps is incomplete.
"The frogs will have very little
effect on the main campus, but
instead (will affect) leaseholders,
near Webb Ranch," Launer said.
"They'll probably have to do little
things like move away from the creek
and instruct their workers not to do

anything (to the frogs)."
Another species which may require
future conservation planning is the
fairy shrimp, which inhabits Lake
Lagunita. Because very little is
known about the organism, it has
been given a "candidate two" status,
denoting that the animal likely needs
protection but must be researched
further before any decisions are
made.

'There is a tremendous
diversity of itty-bitty
species that nobody's
ever seen before'
— Alan Launer

Measuring only a centimeter in
length, the shrimp species was first
discovered in Lake Lagunita in 1923.
Little is known about the organism,
which has been overshadowed by the
recent flap involving its "neighbor,"
the salamander. But scientists at the
Center for Conservation Biology
believe the fairy shrimp will someday
get its due. Referring to the recent
drive to name the tiger salamander
Stanford's mascot, a Center for Con
servation Biology staffer said, "If peo
ple don't want to be called tiger sala
manders, they could be called the
fairy shrimp."
Among these threatened species, the
"wild card" is the ground cricket, cur
rently found only in three localities:
the corner of Campus and Palm Drives,
the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve
and the corner of Junipero Serra and
Stanford Avenue. It had also been
found in Berkeley, but that population
is now believed to be extinct.

A petition has been filed by a for
mer Stanford graduate student to
determine the cricket's conservation
status. If granted, protection mea
sures could wreak enormous havoc at
Stanford.
"Imagine the spotted owl living at
the corner of Campus and Palm
Drives," Launer said. Since the insect
had earlier been found in UC-Berke
ley's stomping grounds, Launer de
scribes its potentially disruptive pres
ence here as "Oski's revenge."
Other animals which are not listed
as endangered or threatened but
rather as "special cases" — rare and
unusual — are also believed to make
Stanford their home. For example,
mountain lions have been sighted at
Jasper Ridge, most recently in
September 1989.
The infrequency of mountain-lion
sightings is largely due to the felines'
great range, according to Monica
Bjorkman, program coordinator for
Jasper Ridge. "They roam up and
down the Peninsula . . . this is not a
very large area for mountain lions."
Perhaps the most numerous visi
tors to campus are 5,000 Mexican
free-tailed bats, a species which is
also considered a "special case." The
bats make their home under the eaves
outside Green Library during the
summer and spring. Northern Cali
fornia's cool winters drive the bats
south once the leaves start to fall.
Generally, the library staff appre
ciates the flying visitors. "There have
been complaints about the guano
smell, but not about the bats them
selves," said Sarah Williamson, the
head of library facilities.
Unfortunately, the upcoming reno
vation of the library may leave the
bats homeless. "At this time the plan
is to make the eaves smaller and hope
that the bats find a new home,"
Williamson said.
