# Blood shortage; O negative needed
## 
### Jim Morris Editorial staff 
The School of Medicine's Blood Cen
ter has issued an urgent call for blood
type O negative donors to replenish
waning reserves.
"O neg is not in great supply, but it's
in great demand.... This is one of the
lowest levels (of O negative) I can
remember," said Rhoda Bums, the asso
ciate director of the Blood Center.
O negative blood is of particular con
cern because of its use as a "universal
donor." It is the only blood type that can

be used for any person.
Often, it is given to pati-ents who
need immediate transfusions and can
not wait for a blood typing process. How
ever, the problem with finding 0 nega
tive blood is that only one out of every 15
people carry it.
Burns encouraged those with O nega
tive to donate within the next week to
help alleviate the shortage. Currently,
the blood center has about 50 units,
which is about 100 below the acceptable
level.
Blood drives have been held recently
at various dormitories across campus,

most recently at Wilbur Hall last Thurs
day.
"Stanford students are excellent
donors. Last year there were over 4,000
donors," Burns said.
Burns encourages students to come
and donate blood this week because the
O negative shortage could be problemat
ic for those in need of this blood.
The Blood Center, located at 800
Welch Rd., is open this week, including
weeknights and Saturday morning.
In addition, there will be a blood drive
in White Plaza on Monday, Nov. 21. The
drive will be held from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
