# Piercing parts perfectly proper
## Nipple rings don't have to pose health problems 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
I've heard that getting her nipples
vlkpierced can interfere with a woman's
ability to lactate later in life. Is this true?
— A long-winded person whose ques
tion I had to edit
A: When aliens finally get enough guts
to appear on Earth as something other
than Elvis, they're not going to stop a
passerby and ask her to direct them to our
leader.
The first thing out of their mouths
when they step off the saucer will be,
"Mrs. President, why did you punch holes
in the flesh of your auditory organs?"
Piercing is a funny practice, probably

dating back to the
days of ritual scarifi
cation when men
were men, women
were women and an
especially large bone
through the nose of
the tribal priest
meant a good hunt
was just around the
corner.
Over the course of
eons, it's gone in and

out of fashion. It's been a religious practice
here, an abomination there, a simultane
ously bold and trite symbol of rebellion
over there. It fades in some cultures for
centuries, but — like bellbottoms — it
always seems to keep coming back.
Since most people in our culture are hip
to the concepts of daily hygiene and the
use of disinfectant, the senseless punctur
ing of body parts tends not to be a great
health risk in modern times. With care,
piercings of even the most sensitive body
parts — the ear lobes, eyebrows, nose,
navel, penis, lips (both upper and nether)
— can be kept infection-free for as long as
the proud owner cares to.
There are, however, rumors that cer
tain body parts don't hold up to piercing
very well, and that piercing can interfere
with the long-term maintenance of these
organs and appendages.
Subject to certain qualifications, these
rumors are true.
As I said, with a bit of effort it is easy to
keep a piercing free of infection. Use of
sterile tools for the operation, daily (or
more frequent) disinfection for four to six

weeks following the procedure, and a
sound regimen of hygiene thereafter pret
ty much guarantees a healthy pierce.
However, people who don't observe
these simple precautions sometimes find
themselves heavy with regret.
Mild infections can usually be treated
with disinfectant. More severe ones can
oflen be cured with antibiotics. But once
these approaches have been tried and seen to
fail, more drastic measures must be taken.
The medical literature contains a few
reports of piercings gone horribly awry, in
which infection advanced so far as to
destroy organ function. The worst cases
required amputation. You might be inter
ested (or repulsed) to learn that these
reports did not involve ear lobes.
But I digress. Back to nipples, the sub-

ject of this week's
question.
Chronic infec
tion of a pierced
nipple can indeed
result in blockage of
the ducts through
which milk might
eventually flow. In
such cases, a fairly
simple reconstruc
tive operation is

indicated and usu
ally results in return of function (although
there is an increased risk of recurrent
infection at the same site).
The operation is nonelective: Late in
pregnancy and for a while thereafter, lac
tation occurs whether the milk's point of
egress is open or not. Although a tasteless
cartoonist could make quite a few humor
ous attempts at depicting the result of an
untreated blockage, I understand from my
reading of the literature that the ensuing
discomfort and serious infection is not at
all amusing to the victim.
But this is really only a problem if you
don t keep the hole clean. Properly cared
for, a nipple piercing can provide you and
your friends with hours and hours of
wholesome fun. Just remember to take it
out before nursing.
