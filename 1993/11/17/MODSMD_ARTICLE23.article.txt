## The
						end of an era — Rafanelli bids the Farm adieu 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
All great players have some sig
nature characteristic, be it a sky
hook, a stiff-arm or a towering
home run. For women's soccer
standout Sarah Rafanelli, it is a

red ribbon.
Over the past four years,
Rafanelli and her ribbon have
danced across Stanford's Maloney
Field, dazzling fans and sending
opposing defenders into fits as
they watch a red blur blaze past
them on its way to scoring yet

another goal.
"My mom loves when I wear
ribbons," Rafanelli said. "When I
got into Stanford, she gave me
tons of red ribbons. It started the
first game my freshman year, and
it's become a superstition."
Looking back on her soccer his-

Tory, it would not seem like the
All-American forward was des
tined to become the world-class
player she is today. Starting on an
under-10 boys' team coached by
her father, a Stanford graduate,
because there were no girls'
teams, Rafanelli can't trace back
to the turning point in picking
soccer over numerous other activ
ities.
"All my sisters and I started
when we were all about eight
years old, just because it was
offered in our community along
with other sports," she said. "I
don't know why I ended up stick
ing with soccer rather than volley
ball or tennis, but I'm glad I did
because I love it."'
Growing up in Piedmont,
Calif., Rafanelli attended the Col
lege Preparatory School, a private
high school of about 260 students.
Unlike most other schools, CPS's
soccer season was in the spring,
which led to very low-key high
school seasons.
"You played all your games and
then that was it," Rafanelli said.
"There weren't any champi
onships. It was more of a social
thing rather than a serious one."
Making up for a less competi
tive high-school career with exten
sive national experience prepared
Rafanelli for the rigors of the
more physical college game. A
member of the Under-19 National
Team in high school, she is now a
member of the defending World
Champion U.S. National Team.
"It's incredible playing in
international tournaments," she
said. "I've developed a strong
sense of patriotism when playing
in foreign countries. There's real
ly nothing more incredible then
standing on the field and hearing
your national anthem being
played."

Although not a starter on the
national team, Rafanelli is usually
one of the first players off the
bench. As one of the younger play
ers on the team, she is aware of
the amount of learning necessary
to excel at the World Cup level.
"Every training session I feel
like I develop more and toore,"
Rafanelli said. "I think especially
this year, I've been able to bring a
lot of that back to my college
game. I'm becoming more of a
complete player, and I think my
experience with the national team
has contributed to that."
Nevertheless, Rafanelli still
sees several deficiencies in her
playing ability. Citing a lack of a
clean technical game, she knows
that her speed has allowed her to
get away with not developing her
other skills. However, as she
moves into international competi
tion, she knows she must flesh
out her game.
"I play with a lot of passion,
which leads to aggression," she
said. "When I get out there, I go
after it. I'm physical and I want to
win. I try to do what it takes to get
the job done. That helps me a lot,
especially with my technical diffi
culties."
Stanford head coach lan Saw
yers, who has watched Rafanelli
develop over the past three years,
sees her as a tremendous example
for the team.
"She's great because she
doesn't demand preferential
treatment," Sawyers said. "If
we're demanding something out
of the players during practice as
far as technical or tactical
changes, she's just as liable to
make a mistake and just as willing
listen to the advice as anybody
else. She doesn't put herself on a
pedestal."
A self-proclaimed leader by

example, Rafanelli remains fairly
quiet on the field while retaining
an intense attitude. Off the field,
a more vocal, playful Rafanelli
emerges. "I have that Italian
chatting thing — I love to talk,"
she said.
As the offensive trigger to an
explosive team, Rafanelli's main
role is to score goals — something
at which she is very accomplished.
Along with freshman forward
Erin Martin, the two high-scoring
forwards "scheme together to fig
ure out ways to score," Rafanelli
said jokingly.
Amassing 59 goals and 34
assists going into this weekend,
her 152 total points place her first
on the all-time Stanford scoring
list. Her 20 goals this season are
also a Cardinal record, breaking
her old record of 16 which she set
during the 1991 season. Like
other star players, Rafanelli's
play tends to lift the team.
"I think everybody's adrenaline
starts going when Raf is on,"
Carmel Murphy said. "She just
gets everyone else going."
Despite these lofty achieve
ments, Rafanelli is content just to
have the opportunity to experi
ence everything soccer has given
her the chance to accomplish.
"I like the competitive arena,"
said Rafanelli. "I think I thrive on
that. Any type of athletics is a way
to express your emotion, and its a
great release to step on the field
and leave everything there."
Soccer has also given Rafanelli
exposure to foreign countries
other than the normal tourist des
tinations, journeying to such
places as Bulgaria, Norway and
Cyprus with various national
teams. Although plans to study
abroad in Florence, Italy, this
