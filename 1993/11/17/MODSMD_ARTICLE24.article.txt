# We've got the Axe! But for how long?
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Throw out the statistics and
disregard the records. The Axe is
at stake.
Stanford (4-6, 2-5 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) plays
host to California (6-4, 3-4) this
Saturday as the Golden Bears
make the trek from Berkeley to
renew the West Coast's oldest
college football rivalry in the
96th edition of the Big Game.
As of late, the series has been
one-sided. Stanford has retained
possession of the Axe — the tro
phy awarded to the winner of
the Big Game — since 1986.
But this pattern will not
translate into complacency.
None of the players on the Stan
ford roster has ever lost to Cal, a
habit that the Cardinal squad
does not want to break.
"If we lose I'm going to feel a
lot worse than I will feel good if
we win," said senior cornerback
Vaughn Bryant. "If I lose this
game, I'll always remember that
I lost in my senior year, and I
don't want to go out like that."
"The Big Game is college
football at its best," said senior
left end Tyrone Parker. "It's
why you lift all those weights
and do all that running. It's the
pinnacle. The teams have been
playing each other for over 100
years. They're our rivals, and
they're the team you wish the

best for during the rest of the
season, but when you play them
you just want to beat the hell out
of them."
This year, both schools have
expressed concern that the beat
ings are confined to the teams on
the playing field during the foot
ball game. At halflime of last
year's 41-21 Cardinal victory,
several Cal students attacked
Flag Boy and the Stanford Tree.
Additionally, there was a near
brawl at the end of the game
between the teams and between
Cal and Stanford students who
rushed the Memorial Stadium
field.
"I'm hoping really seriously
there aren't any altercations,"
said Stanford head coach Bill
Walsh. "I'm hopeful this year
that people will behave them
selves. "
There will be plenty of fire
works on the field. Stanford
ranks first in the Pac-10 in pass
ing offense, and Cal rates second
in the league in scoring offense.
Given those traits, the Big Game
should be a game of big num
bers.
"We're going to have to score
35 points to win," Walsh said,
knowing that Stanford is giving
up an average of 34 points per
game. "Defense is what concerns
me the most."
Equally worried is California
