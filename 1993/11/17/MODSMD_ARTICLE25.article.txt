# Swimmers to face Cal
## Unscored meet wall be relaxed event 
### Regan Demas Staff writer 
The first dual meet of the sea
son for the Stanford women's
swim team will be held today at
deGuerre pool. The event will
not be scored, but instead will be
a relaxed and laid-back affair
which will not affect the team's
season standings.
So what's the purpose of the 1
p.m. meet?
The Cardinal's opponent is
California, and that's the only
incentive Stanford needs to
show up and give it their all.
"We're kind of excited just
because it's Cal," said Cardinal
junior standout Jenny Thomp
son.
The meet will serve as a pre
cursor to the bigger matchups
coming later in the season, and
will give the team some needed
training and competitive experi

ence.
"This will be a good meet for
us to help us get ready for our
meet in December," said coach
Richard Quick. "Right now it's
more important to train than to
compete, but you still have to
race every once in a while."
The meet will be a relaxed
matchup. Cal did not want to
keep score in the meet, and also
decided against racing in relays
with the Cardinal. And although
the meet itself will not be a seri
ous affair, Stanford is approach
ing the matchup with a serious
outlook.
"We will race seriously with
everybody," said Quick. "Every
time we race it's serious. It's
important to compete well, and
that's what we intend to do."
The meet's lineup will also
differ from the norm. Most of
the athletes will be competing
in one of their forte events and

one "off-beat" event, adding to
the competition's relaxed at
mosphere.
"I'm swimming some off
events that I'm really not very
good at," said Thompson. "A
lot of people are. But we're just

looking to have fun and treat
ing it as a training situation."
In a week at Stanford full of
festering animosity toward the
Bears across the Bay, this meet
serves as another way to vent
building frustrations against

the Cardinal's archrival.
"We think that they [Cal]
are weenies because they don't
want to do relays or the longer
events," said Thompson. "We
are really down on them.
They're wimps."
