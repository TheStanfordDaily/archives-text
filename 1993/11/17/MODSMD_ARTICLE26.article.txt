# An All-Big Game Team for the ages
## 
### 
The games remain etched in our memory,
but the names fade over the years. Let's wake
up the echoes with the official 1993 All-Big
Game all-time roster.
Quarterback: Dick Norman, 1959. Nor
man, a junior, went 34-for-39 in throwing for a
then-NCAA-record 401 yards in the 1959 contest.
Norman's career provides a perfect case
study for adherents to the "passing doesn't
pay" school of football theory. By the numbers,
Norman, who started for the Cardinal (actual
ly, he started for the Indians) from 1958-60,
was a success. He held the Stanford career
passing yardage record for almost a decade. In
the standings, however, Norman's teams broke
no records, compiling a woeful 5-25 record.
Kicker: Mike Langford, 1974. Big, red
headed and friendly, Langford never looked the
part of a placekicker. In fact, he doubled as a
reserve linebacker for most of his career. But
none of that mattered in the 1974 Big Game.
With Stanford down 20-19 and three ticks left
on the clock, Langford stepped onto the field to
attempt a 50-yard field goal.
The distance wasn't a problem — he had
booted a 52-yarder against Michigan earlier in
the year. Nor was the game itself — Langford
had connected on two kicks earlier in the after
noon. The problem? His nerves. "I had never
felt like that before," he said after the game. "I
just kept saying, 'Oh my God, here I am.'"
God and Langford came through, as the kick
wobbled through the right side of the uprights
and led the Cardinal (actually, they were the
Cardinals at the time) to a 22-20 win.
Special Teams: Tuan Van Le, 1988.
Some might say that Le's career was disap
pointing. A hard-hitting defensive back, Le got

most of his collegiate playing time with the Car
dinal special-teams squads. But in 1988, Le
capped an otherwise undistinguished 3-6-2
Stanford season with his Big Game heroics.

Four seconds remained in the '88 game, a
19-19 deadlock, when Cal's Robbie Keen lined
up to attempt his fourth field goal of the game.
The kick, a 20-yard chip shot, appeared to be
automatic, until Le raced around the right end
of the Cal line to block it and seal the tie.
Flag Boy: Seye Ewedemi, 1992. It takes
quite a personality to command respect while run
ning around the stadium in red crotch-huggers
waving an eight-foot school flag after Cardinal
touchdowns. But the 6-foot-3, 220-pound Ewede
mi earned that respect, and for good reason.
With Cal hopelessly out of the game in the
second half of last year's battle, a Bear
prankster grabbed Ewedemi's red "S" flag and
raced towards the Cal student section.
Enraged, Ewedemi hurdled the moat around
the field at Memorial Stadium and caught the
cowardly flag-nabber. No punches were
thrown, and no arrests were made.
Said Ewedemi later, "That guy should either
be arrested or they should let me go at him for

half an hour." It all makes me think twice
about mocking the yell leaders.
Band: Gary Tyrell, 1982. Tyrell played
trombone in the Band. He might have played
his instrument very well. He might have played
his instrument very poorly. No one cares.
Tyrell was playing "All Right Now" in the end
zone at the end of the 1982 Big Game when he
was blasted by a charging Bear, Kevin Moen.
Moen, a Cal senior, was on the scoring end of
a highly-improbable, probably-illegal, five-lat
eral, 57-yard game-ending kickoff return that
gave Cal a 25-20 win in the '82 contest. Tyrell
got bowled over . . . and continued playing. The
game and The Play received national recogni
tion — for once, the Bears had the last laugh.
Until 1990, which brings me to. . ..
Defensive line: John Belli, 1990.
"Please clear the field. The game is not
over." With the Cardinal down 25-24 and five
seconds on the clock, Stanford quarterback
Jason Palumbis threw what appeared to be a
game-ending incomplete pass. Stanford stood
37 yards from the Cal end zone. Adding 17
yards for ball placement, kicker John Hopkins
was facing a 54-yard field goal attempt.
Enter Belli. A senior nose guard at Cal, Belli
showed that four years at Berkeley had done
wonders for his intelligence and maturity. His
late hit on Palumbis resulted in a 15-yard
roughing-the-passer penalty, which made a 54-
yard attempt a 39-yard attempt, which made a
Cal win a Stanford win.
Granted, the victory was a bit cheesy. But
like that old proverb says, all is fair in war and
Big Game.
Or is it that all is dumb in war and Berkeley?
Big Game 1993. This Saturday. Go Cardinal.

The games remain etched in our memory,
but the names fade over the years. Let's wake
up the echoes with the official 1993 All-Big
Game all-time roster.
Quarterback: Dick Norman, 1959. Nor
man, a junior, went 34-for-39 in throwing for a
then-NCAA-record 401 yards in the 1959 contest.
Norman's career provides a perfect case
study for adherents to the "passing doesn't
pay" school of football theory. By the numbers,
Norman, who started for the Cardinal (actual
ly, he started for the Indians) from 1958-60,
was a success. He held the Stanford career
passing yardage record for almost a decade. In
the standings, however, Norman's teams broke
no records, compiling a woeful 5-25 record.
Kicker: Mike Langford, 1974. Big, red
headed and friendly, Langford never looked the
part of a placekicker. In fact, he doubled as a
reserve linebacker for most of his career. But
none of that mattered in the 1974 Big Game.
With Stanford down 20-19 and three ticks left
on the clock, Langford stepped onto the field to
attempt a 50-yard field goal.
The distance wasn't a problem — he had
booted a 52-yarder against Michigan earlier in
the year. Nor was the game itself — Langford
had connected on two kicks earlier in the after
noon. The problem? His nerves. "I had never
felt like that before," he said after the game. "I
just kept saying, 'Oh my God, here I am.'"
God and Langford came through, as the kick
wobbled through the right side of the uprights
and led the Cardinal (actually, they were the
Cardinals at the time) to a 22-20 win.
Special Teams: Tuan Van Le, 1988.
Some might say that Le's career was disap
pointing. A hard-hitting defensive back, Le got

most of his collegiate playing time with the Car
dinal special-teams squads. But in 1988, Le
capped an otherwise undistinguished 3-6-2
Stanford season with his Big Game heroics.

Four seconds remained in the '88 game, a
19-19 deadlock, when Cal's Robbie Keen lined
up to attempt his fourth field goal of the game.
The kick, a 20-yard chip shot, appeared to be
automatic, until Le raced around the right end
of the Cal line to block it and seal the tie.
Flag Boy: Seye Ewedemi, 1992. It takes
quite a personality to command respect while run
ning around the stadium in red crotch-huggers
waving an eight-foot school flag after Cardinal
touchdowns. But the 6-foot-3, 220-pound Ewede
mi earned that respect, and for good reason.
With Cal hopelessly out of the game in the
second half of last year's battle, a Bear
prankster grabbed Ewedemi's red "S" flag and
raced towards the Cal student section.
Enraged, Ewedemi hurdled the moat around
the field at Memorial Stadium and caught the
cowardly flag-nabber. No punches were
thrown, and no arrests were made.
Said Ewedemi later, "That guy should either
be arrested or they should let me go at him for

half an hour." It all makes me think twice
about mocking the yell leaders.
Band: Gary Tyrell, 1982. Tyrell played
trombone in the Band. He might have played
his instrument very well. He might have played
his instrument very poorly. No one cares.
Tyrell was playing "All Right Now" in the end
zone at the end of the 1982 Big Game when he
was blasted by a charging Bear, Kevin Moen.
Moen, a Cal senior, was on the scoring end of
a highly-improbable, probably-illegal, five-lat
eral, 57-yard game-ending kickoff return that
gave Cal a 25-20 win in the '82 contest. Tyrell
got bowled over . . . and continued playing. The
game and The Play received national recogni
tion — for once, the Bears had the last laugh.
Until 1990, which brings me to. . ..
Defensive line: John Belli, 1990.
"Please clear the field. The game is not
over." With the Cardinal down 25-24 and five
seconds on the clock, Stanford quarterback
Jason Palumbis threw what appeared to be a
game-ending incomplete pass. Stanford stood
37 yards from the Cal end zone. Adding 17
yards for ball placement, kicker John Hopkins
was facing a 54-yard field goal attempt.
Enter Belli. A senior nose guard at Cal, Belli
showed that four years at Berkeley had done
wonders for his intelligence and maturity. His
late hit on Palumbis resulted in a 15-yard
roughing-the-passer penalty, which made a 54-
yard attempt a 39-yard attempt, which made a
Cal win a Stanford win.
Granted, the victory was a bit cheesy. But
like that old proverb says, all is fair in war and
Big Game.
Or is it that all is dumb in war and Berkeley?
Big Game 1993. This Saturday. Go Cardinal.
