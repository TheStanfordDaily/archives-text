# Getting off on the right foot
## Men's hoops takes on Blue & Gold Fleet 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
As the Stanford men's basket
ball teams opens its exhibition sea
son tonight at 7:30 p.m. against
the Blue & Gold Fleet, head coach
Mike Montgomery can point to one
big change from the start of last
year's loss-laden campaign
"I am encouraged because we
have stayed away from injuries,"
Montgomery said. "Last year, we
had five guys injured for the first
game, and we never got three of
them back. It really makes a
tremendous difference."
After just 18 days of practice,
the Cardinal gets its first chance to
show the Maples Pavilion home
crowd that it has no intention of
repeating last season's lOth-place
finish in the Pacific 10 Conference.
"Somewhere, down at the end
of the tunnel, I can see some light
peeking through. Last year, it was
total darkness," Montgomery said.
Montgomery described the
game against the Blue & Gold
Fleet — an Amateur Athletic
Union team based in San Francis
co — as little more than an "orga
nized scrimmage," but he said it is
still "real timely."
"We get to play against someone

who doesn't know our plays and
know where we are going to go,
and we can see how we execute,"
he said.
Montgomery said he is still
searching for the right combina
tions of players, and he plans to be
flexible about whom he will start
each game.
"I don't want to have a starting
five for every game. It wouldn't be
fair to the seven or eight players
who you could make a strong case
for starting," Montgomery said
"There are many who are pretty
level in their ability."
In fact, David Harbour and
Andy Poppink — both of whom sat
out all of last season with injuries
— have returned and played well
enough in practices and scrim
mages to battle for starting roles.
Shooting guards Harbour and
Dion Cross are "the two kids who
are closest to being even," Mont
gomery said. "Each of them do
some things really well, and it is
hard to say that either one is not a
starter ... That is the toughest
spot "
At the power forward position,
Montgomery said that Poppink
has "played extremely well," and

hopes to start their exhibition season with a win tonight.
