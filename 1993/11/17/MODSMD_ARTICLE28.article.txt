## Hockey trounced by Wildcats 
### Kyle Graham Editorial staff 
It may be November, but the
Stanford's men's hockey team
still felt the heat in Arizona.
The University of Arizona,
that is. Last Friday and Satur
day, the men's squad fell to the
Wildcats by the scores of 13-2
and 13-3 in games where the
Cardinal started well, but quick
ly succumbed to Arizona's ice
melting attack.
"Arizona is a team that is
three or four goals better than
us, not 10 or 11. We just need
to play three periods of strong
hockey each game," said senior
right-winger Cory Sammons.
On Friday, the Cardinal
fought the Wildcats to a near
standstill in the first period,

trailing Arizona by only 2-1 at
the session's close. Then, the
Wildcats opened up a scoring
blitz, scoring 11 of the game's
12 goals to finish the contest.
Saturday's game was re
markably similar to the first duel.
Arizona held a fragile 2-1 lead
early in the second period, but
then the Wildcats pounced and
rattled off seven straight goals to
effectively end the match.
The Cardinal was hampered in
the weekend's contests by the
injury-induced absences of defense
man Vince Georges, wing Brian
Browder and center Evan Singer.
While Browder is expected to
return for this Thursday and Fri
day's games against California,
Georges and Singer will likely be
sidelined for the remainder of the
season.
