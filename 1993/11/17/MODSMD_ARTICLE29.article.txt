# Sailing team capsizes Hawaii in upset
## 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
Turbulent conditions and unpredictable
winds made last weekend's North / South
Intersectional at San Luis Obispo an adven
ture for the 15 universities present.
While the winds baffled many schools,
the Stanford team found only smooth sail
ing as they cruised to an upset victory.
Third-ranked Hawaii came in to the
competition as the mild favorite, but many
thought the No. 9 Stanford sailing team
would have a shot to overtake the Rain
bows. It was the Cardinal's overwhelming
margin of victory that shocked sailing
insiders.
Stanford won the regatta by the amazing
margin of approximately 50 points. Hawaii
placed a distant second.
Stanford's victory was even more
impressive due to the conditions.
"We sailed on a lake that was extremely
small. It was pretty hard to believe we were
even going to have an event there when we
got there," said Cardinal sailing coach
Steve Bourdow.
"The sailing on the lake down there is
just crazy," said senior Jeremy Hinman.

"The wind comes from every different
direction. You'll be sailing along on one
track and the wind will switch around 180
degrees. The ability of our top sailors to
deal with that and keep their concentration
was a huge factor."
Another huge factor was the success of
Stanford's lasers. While Stanford finished a
respectable third in both the A and B
dinghy divisions, they were the class of the
C and D laser divisions. The single-handed
lasers are operated by one person rather
than skipper-crew teams.
The focus in regattas is usually on the
dinghy divisions, and the lasers are often
relatively overlooked. In this regatta, how
ever, Charles Meade and Adam Lowry, win
ners of the C and D divisions, respectively,
paced Stanford to victory.
Bourdow was quick to praise Meade and
Lowry.
"Two weeks ago, they both said they
knew that I sailing lasers] was going to be
their job. The team let them know we were
really going to be counting on them, and
they basically went out and just took care of
business."
Bourdow was not the only person to note
the success of Meade and Lowry. Don Chen

navasin, who placed third in the B division
with skipper Jeremy Mclntyre, also
attributed the win to the lasers' dominance
and the overall depth of Stanford's team.
"We have a really deep team, especially
with the laser sailors. They helped out so
much. Adam Lowry came in first by about
20 points, and Charles (Meadel did a great
job," Chennavasin said.
Meade was not surprised by the team's
showing.
"We knew we were a strong team going
in. We have a bunch of good sailors, while
others teams have maybe two or three.
Hawaii has two All-Americans in the
dinghy divisions, but we stayed pretty
close. We put a lot of points on them in the
laser divisions. It was our best showing of
the year."
The win was a great climax to Stanford's
fall season. More importantly, it allows the
Cardinal to attend the regattas of their
choice in the more consequential spring
season. Before then, the Cardinal will send
a few members to Chicago for the Timme
Angsten Intersectional this weekend and
will participate in the Rose Bowl Intersec
tional in Long Beach, Calif, in early Jan
uary.
