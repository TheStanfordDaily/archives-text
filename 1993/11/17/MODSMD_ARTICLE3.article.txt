# Report: Stanford not faring well in recruiting, retaining female faculty
## 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Although much controversy has arisen
over the editing of the report from the
Provost's Committee on the Recruitment
and Retention of Women Faculty, the
findings are undisputed.
The committee spent eight months ex
amining data from Stanford and other
schools on the number, percentage and
salaries of women faculty. Committee
members also talked to both male and fe
male Stanford faculty — particularly ju

mor and young senior protessors — as
well as their department chairs.
From this research, the committee
produced an unedited 82-page report.
Committee members found that the Uni
versity still needs to improve its recruit
ment and retention of female faculty.
Stanford is third from the bottom in its
percentage of women faculty, compared
to schools like the University of Chicago,
MIT, Ivy League and Pacific-10 Confer
ence universities.
