# Report: Stanford not faring well in recruiting, retaining female faculty
##

Although much controversy has arisen
over the editing of the report from the
Provost's Committee on the Recruitment
and Retention of Women Faculty, the
findings are undisputed.
The committee spent eight months ex
amining data from Stanford and other
schools on the number, percentage and
salaries of women faculty. Committee
members also talked to both male and fe
male Stanford faculty — particularly ju

mor and young senior protessors — as
well as their department chairs.
From this research, the committee
produced an unedited 82-page report.
Committee members found that the Uni
versity still needs to improve its recruit
ment and retention of female faculty.
Stanford is third from the bottom in its
percentage of women faculty, compared
to schools like the University of Chicago,
MIT, Ivy League and Pacific-10 Confer
ence universities.
For the most part, the commit
tee's 16 recommendations fall into
four categories:
• create a culture of faculty sup
port;
• increase the number and per
centage of women faculty;
• promote salary equity and use
benefits to enhance recruitment and
retention; and
• assist faculty to combine work
and family.
Compared to other similar insti
tutions, "Stanford is not faring
well," said Physics Prof. Steve Chu,
a committee member. "You could
say that it's because we have an
engineering school — which is male
dominated and something other
Ivies don't have — but that's a cop
out. Regardless, we need more
female faculty here."
The committee's study found
that there were a number of issues
related to the treatment of junior
faculty — both male and female —
that led to a lower rate of retention

and recruitment of women at Stan
ford.
Among its findings, the report
states that the culture in many
departments at Stanford is not sup
portive of junior faculty, as mea
sured by indicators such as mentor
ing programs and the tenure pro
cess. Sexual harassment is also part
of the "culture of non-support at
Stanford," the report said.
In addition, the committee found
evidence of gender-based salary
inequities and learned that both
male and female faculty often find it
difficult to balance the strenuous
demands of their jobs with raising a
family.
"Junior members of the faculty
are under tremendous pressure.
The bottom line is: take good care of
your junior faculty — both men and
women — and the women will ben
efit greatly," Chu said, adding that
some departments, like biology, do
assist younger members.
The committee was initially
appointed by then-Provost Gerald
Laeberman in October 1992. It fin
ished the report in September, and its
findings are scheduled to be present
ed to the Faculty Senate on Dec. 2.
