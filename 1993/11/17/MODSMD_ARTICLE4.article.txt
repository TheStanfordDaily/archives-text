# Campus conservatives start group for curriculum debate
## 
### Jim Ho 
A group of conservative students, alumni and fac
ulty have recently joined together to try to address
what they say are increasing alumni concerns over
political correctness, the end of the Western Civiliza
tion requirement and the quality of undergraduate
education.
The new group, "Winds of Freedom," aims to im
prove communication between alumni and the ad
ministration and to provide alumni with an opportu
nity to participate in the ongoing debate over the cur
riculum, according to senior Christopher Grey, the
group's executive director.
The group's kickofT event, scheduled for Nov. 19
at the Stanford Park Hotel, will feature two panel

discussions and a keynote address from Lynne Ch
eney, a former chair of the National Endowment for
the Humanities who has studied Stanford's under
graduate curriculum.
Panel members include Hoover Fellow Martin An
derson, Stanford alumnus and Wall Street Journal
business editor Tim Ferguson, and Political Science
Prof. David Brady. Jean Fetter, special assistant to
University President Gerhard Casper, will moderate
one of the panels.
"Undergraduate education could certainly benefit
from a discussion," Fetter said, adding that she rec
ognizes "the need to maintain better ties with our
alumni.
"I'd never miss an opportunity
to inform the uninformed, and
there are certainly a lot of unin
formed alumni out there, unfortu
nately," Fetter said. But she said
she questions the group's con
tention that undergraduate educa
tion has suffered in recent years.
Winds of Freedom is a joint project
of the Stanford Review and the Inter
collegiate Studies Institute, deriving
its name from the Stanford motto,
"The Wind of Freedom Blows."
Grey said he believes that the
revival of the motto is symbolic of
the change that Casper's adminis
tration has brought to Stanford.
"Along with the motto, we hope
to revive some of the principles
behind it," Grey said.

The group, which is made up of
concerned alumni, a dozen stu
dents and a few faculty members,
will focus on the 1988 curriculum
change, in which the Cultures,

Ideas and Values course replaced
the controversial Western Civiliza
tion requirement, Grey said.
He said the group will address
what many alumni perceive is an
undergraduate curriculum held cap
tive by a politically correct agenda.
"The fact that alumni still don't
understand what exactly happened
with Western Civilization shows
that there is a serious communica
tion problem, and that there is
room for improvement," Grey said.
"Our ultimate goal is to increase
alumni support for the University.
"The University is very good at
(organizing) social events for the
alumni," he added, pointing to the
success of the recent alumni week
end. "But it did not really provide
an opportunity to directly engage
in a substantive discussion over
curriculum issues."
The new administration has
"made a lot of progress, especially
in regard to free speech and aca
demic issues, but there are still
some serious alumni concerns left
to be addressed. ... It is our hope
that Winds of Freedom can rebuild

burnt bridges," Grey said.
The group also plans to issue a
student-produced quarterly
newsletter beginning in January
targeted at alumni from the Class
of *40 to the Class of '70, which
make up the majority of the con
cerned alumni.
Winds of Freedom hopes to offer
another alumni conference in the
spring and co-sponsor debates on
campus with other student groups
on issues concerning undergradu
ate education and University poli
cy, Grey said. In addition, the
group will release proposals regard
ing a new Western Civilization
requirement, as well as a policy on
political correctness and its proper
role in the curriculum.
While the group is supported by
the Review and other prominent
conservative Stanford alumni,
Grey said "the goals are not neces
sarily conservative. ... We want to
bring everyone into the debate."

dents, faculty and staff are invited
