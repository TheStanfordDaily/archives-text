## 
### Jim Ho 
A group of conservative students, alumni and fac
ulty have recently joined together to try to address
what they say are increasing alumni concerns over
political correctness, the end of the Western Civiliza
tion requirement and the quality of undergraduate
education.
The new group, "Winds of Freedom," aims to im
prove communication between alumni and the ad
ministration and to provide alumni with an opportu
nity to participate in the ongoing debate over the cur
riculum, according to senior Christopher Grey, the
group's executive director.
The group's kickofT event, scheduled for Nov. 19
at the Stanford Park Hotel, will feature two panel

discussions and a keynote address from Lynne Ch
eney, a former chair of the National Endowment for
the Humanities who has studied Stanford's under
graduate curriculum.
Panel members include Hoover Fellow Martin An
derson, Stanford alumnus and Wall Street Journal
business editor Tim Ferguson, and Political Science
Prof. David Brady. Jean Fetter, special assistant to
University President Gerhard Casper, will moderate
one of the panels.
"Undergraduate education could certainly benefit
from a discussion," Fetter said, adding that she rec
ognizes "the need to maintain better ties with our
alumni.
