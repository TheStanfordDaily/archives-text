## Stats expert predicts Big Loss 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
An audience of about 20 students groaned and
squirmed with discomfort last night as Psychology
Prof. Ewart Thomas told them right to their faces
that Stanford will lose the Big Game on Saturday.
Students in the Kimball Hall lounge listened at
tentively while the former dean of Humanities and
Sciences threw football statistics, ratios and equa
tions at them. Staring quizzically at handouts detail
ing Big Game numbers on graphs and charts, they
followed Ewart's mathematical logic carefully.
Then their jaws dropped in disbelief as Thomas
concluded the impossible.
"The prediction I'm going to stick with is that we'll
lose by one touchdown," Thomas said.
On Thomas's side were his accurate prediction of
last year's Big Game, his doctorate in statistics, and
something he calls the "WRD," or "win-ratio differ
ence." This statistic, which plays a vital role in
Thomas' calculations, is obtained by subtracting UC-
Berkeley's ratio of wins to total games in the regular
season from Stanford's.
For those of you keeping score, Thomas counts a
tie as a "half-win."
Thomas outlined four categories of past seasons
based on Stanford's WRD. The Cardinal's current
record of 4-6, combined with the Bears' record of 6-4,
produces a dismal WRD of -0.2. This puts Stanford
well into the bottom quarter of the 96 Big Games and
into the category which Thomas labeled "much worse
than Cal."

In this category, Stanford has won only one out of
eight games, and the average spread was 14 points in
Cal's favor.
Using these indicators, Thomas said, "not only
can we predict that Stanford will lose, we could say
the point spread will be two touchdowns."
