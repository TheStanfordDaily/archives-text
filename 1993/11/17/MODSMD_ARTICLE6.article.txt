# Gays gaining social acceptance
## Despite changes, scholar says legal hurdles remain 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
It is the best of times and the
worst of times for gays and les
bians right now, Rockefeller Fel
low Morris Kaplan said in an ad
dress at the Law School last night.
While gay and lesbian rights
are currently under fire in the
courts, gay and lesbian groups are
making headway in getting their
issues into public discussion, Ka
plan explained.
"There's an asymmetry be
tween social acceptance of the
'closet,' and a pervasive legal dis
ability (for gays)," Kaplan told the

audience of about 40 in the speech
titled "Intimacy & Equality â€”
The Question of Lesbian and Gay
Marriage." In other words, legal
acceptance of gays has lagged be
hind social acceptance of them.
Kaplan, a Yale Law School
graduate who teaches philosophy
at the State University of New
York at Purchase, stressed the im
portance of sexuality and choice in
one's everyday life, quoting re
tired Supreme Court Justice
Harry Blackmun. "The self, our
identification, is with one's capac
ity of making intimate relation
ships," he said.
Addressing issues of privacy,

sexuality, marriage and the rela
tionship between family and law,
Kaplan traced the development of
constitutional interpretations of
sexuality and privacy through key
cases like Roe vs. Wade and Bow
ers vs. Hardwick, which ruled that
Georgia's laws prohibiting con
sensual sodomy were not viola
tions of privacy.
"The criminalization of what
adults do to each other in the pri
vacy of their own homes" has long
been debated, Kaplan said.
Kaplan also said he saw the gay
movement transform from being
strictly defined in a negative
manner, as a defensive fight for
survival, to an active position of
flourishing in the current contro
versies of gay and lesbian mar
riages and parenthood.
"The state is there not sim
ply to leave us alone or protect
against discrimination, but it's
also a positive agency to real
ize personal aspirations," he
said.
At stake in the issue of gay
and lesbian marriage is "the
moral legitimacy of shared

lives," Kaplan said. "Marriage
is a legal and social construc
tion."
Part of the scrutiny into gay
marriage, he said, is caused by
the perception that the position
of the family is in trouble, and
that "family values are under
siege."
Kaplan, who is currently writ
ing a book of the same title as his
speech, will teach a course this
winter at the Law School about
the history and politics of sexual
ity in law.
He came to Stanford on a
Rockefeller Fellowship, a one
year fellowship to promote the
intersection of law and the
humanities.
