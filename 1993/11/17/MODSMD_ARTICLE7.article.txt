# Well-seasoned hasher waltzes up food chain

Stanford graduate Peter
Goebel is as much a fixture in
Wilbur food service as whipped
topping on jello and round raisin
loaves.
The veteran hasher has spent
five solid years in the kitchen and
behind the cash register of Wilbur
Dining Hall — even during sum
mers, while stopped out, and now
as an alumnus.
Goebel's "love affair" with food
service began his freshman year at
the fateful moment he checked the
hasher box on his financial aid
form, he said. He climbed to the top
of the food service ladder relatively
quickly, and became head hasher
by the end of his freshman year.

While Goebel has continued to
hash all year and every summer
since then, his real dedication
emerged when he stopped out
after his junior year but still con
tinued to hash.
Though his abiding allegiance
to food service played a part,
Goebel said his decision to hash
while he stopped out came down
to two reasons: "It was conve
nient, and they wanted me."
Meanwhile, he took classes at
Foothill ( x)llege, tiying to figure out
his mi\jor, and finally decided on
Values, Technology, Science, and
Society.

ing, noticed sophomore Tim
Paaske, a fellow hasher. "I asked
Pete about the cash register, and
he answered by talking about mag
netic flux," Paaske said.
Goebel, who graduated last
June, now stands at the peak of
power — as a food service manager
in charge of the Wilbur kitchen
and University catering.
"I didn't plan on this," Goebel
said. "It just happened."
Spending five years hashing
has made Goebel somewhat of an
"old-timer," who has seen his
share of finer moments behind the

red apron.
During his freshman year, a fel
low hasher put an "Out of Order"
sign on the juice machine, filling it
with Southern Comfort and
lemonade.
Even his memories of the Loma
Prieta Earthquake can be linked to
food service. Goebel remembers
bowls full of jello juggling and tsuna
mi-like waves of steaming water
splashing out of the food servery
when the earthquake struck.
Even more amazing than the
earthquake, Goebel beat the leg
endary Stanford odds, meeting a
girlfriend through hashing.
"Hashers get more dates," he said.
After their eyes met over the food
service line one day, fate took its
course.

Goebel's fellow hashers say
they've learned a lot from working
with the long-time hasher.
"Peter's taught me everything I
know about hashing, women, and
life," said freshman hasher Josh
Gergeley.
Goebel plans on hashing until
June, at which time he hopes to be
accepted in to the Teach for Amer
ica program, he said.
"The best way to become a
teacher is through hands-on expe
rience, not sitting in a classroom
for another year," Goebel said,
adding that his five years hashing
have taught him something he
never would have learned in class.
"There's no rush," Goebel said.
"Take your time. Ei\joy it while
you can."
