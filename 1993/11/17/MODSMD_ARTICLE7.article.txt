# Well-seasoned hasher waltzes up food chain

Stanford graduate Peter
Goebel is as much a fixture in
Wilbur food service as whipped
topping on jello and round raisin
loaves.
The veteran hasher has spent
five solid years in the kitchen and
behind the cash register of Wilbur
Dining Hall — even during sum
mers, while stopped out, and now
as an alumnus.
Goebel's "love affair" with food
service began his freshman year at
the fateful moment he checked the
hasher box on his financial aid
form, he said. He climbed to the top
of the food service ladder relatively
quickly, and became head hasher
by the end of his freshman year.

While Goebel has continued to
hash all year and every summer
since then, his real dedication
emerged when he stopped out
after his junior year but still con
tinued to hash.
Though his abiding allegiance
to food service played a part,
Goebel said his decision to hash
while he stopped out came down
to two reasons: "It was conve
nient, and they wanted me."
Meanwhile, he took classes at
Foothill ( x)llege, tiying to figure out
his mi\jor, and finally decided on
Values, Technology, Science, and
Society.
Goebel's science background
has served him well in his hash
