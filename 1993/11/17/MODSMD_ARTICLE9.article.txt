# Res Ed prepares for California quake
## 3-day watch in home stretch 
### Sandy Lee Staff writer 
In the wake of the recent earthquake watch in
central California, the Office of Residential Educa
tion has advised the Stanford community to re-ex
amine its earthquake preparedness, in a memo sent
to all resident fellows this week.
Though Stanford lies outside of the area affected
bv the 72-hour watch, which ends today, "we felt it
was a good time to check in, to see if each residence
has a plan" in the event of an earthquake, said Ann
Porteus, acting co-director of Res Ed.
However, Porteus said the memo that she sent
was merely a reminder and not meant to indicate any
specific change in plans by Res Ed to promote earth
quake awareness
She said earthquake preparedness is handled
mostly on the residence level. "Each house comes up
with its own plan. We leave it to the
residences to take whatever earth
quake preparedness measures they
feel they want or need," she said.
But the reminder from Res Ed
— as well as increased news cover
age about quake preparedness —
has caused little concern among
the residence staffs.
Linguistics Prof. John Rick
ford, the RF at Kimball Hall, said
that there has been no recent
dorm-based activity to increase
earthquake preparedness.
"We don't want to create unnec
essary panic within the dorm," he
said.
"There's always the chance of
something. We always need to be
on watch," said Rickford, who
believes that the residence staff is
already "relatively well prepared,"
due in part to the resident assis
tant and RF earthquake training
in September.
Jenny Wash, an RA in Branner,
said that there has been increased
dorm discussion about earth
quakes this week, though it is
unrelated to the watch in central
California.
"We were planning to talk

about learthquake preparedness]
at a house meeting because we
weren't sure how much the frosh
know about what to do when an
earthquake hits," Wash said.
Although residential education is
using the watch as an opportunity to
spread the word about the threat
posed by earthquakes, Stanford
earthquake experts are more skepti
cal about the prediction's benefits.
Civil Engineering Prof. Anne
Kiremidjian, co-director of the
Blume Earthquake Engineering
Center, was hesitant about com
menting on the reliability of the
prediction, citing "too many
parameters" that have a high
degree of uncertainty.
"Earthquake predictions must
be taken with caution.... Even a
prediction for a quake 10 years
from now can't be made without a
qualification of confidence,"
Kiremidjian said.
"The [U.S. Geological Survey]
said there was a 35 percent chance
[of an earthquake occurring Mon
day], but the chances of one not
happening are even greater," said
Civil Engineering Prof. Helmut
Krawinkler, the other director of
the Blume Center.
Kiremidjian said these kinds of
predictions are very dangerous
because each prediction's failure
reduces the next watch's credibility.
