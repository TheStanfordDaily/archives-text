When You're Considering
An Analyst Position in Investment Banking,
Consider One More Thing.
Consider the investment hank
that is uniquely in tune with the
abilities and aspirations of the
people who comprise it. Where
high professional standards are
reflected in principled every day
practices. Where the talent of
each individual is an integral part
of the team effort. And where
those who choose to accept the
challenges set before them grow
both personally and professionally.
In short, consider the
Investment Banking Division
at Goldman Sachs.
