ply double-click on it and then click on the "Get Available Topics" button to access the new articles.
If you're going to use Proteus from a public computer cluster (Tresidder or Meyer), follow these steps::
1. Choose "Get Proteus" from the Apple menu.
2. The Proteus server will appear on the left hand side of your screen. Open it and drag the folder named **COPY ME** to the hard drive. Copying this folder
could take as long as 15 minutes, and will use approximately 6MB of hard disk space.
3. Drag the Proteus server to the Trash. This disconnects you and makes it easier for other people to use the server.
4. Choose "Get HyperCard" from the Apple menu. Proteus needs HyperCard to run.
5. Choose "Clean System" from the Apple menu. This installs extensions that Proteus needs.
6. Open the **COPY ME** folder on your hard drive and double-dick on Proteus. You're ready to go!
For those with in-rootn connections and a color Macintosh running System 7: Use the Chooser (in the Apple menu) to connect to the Proteus server in the D
Graphics zone. Read the README file for instructions on how to get Proteus up and running on your personal computer.
