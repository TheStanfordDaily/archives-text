— Black and white leaders endorsed a
sweeping new constitution yesterday that
gives equal rights to the black majority,
ends three centuries of white domination
and buries the hated apartheid system.
Culminating two years of painful
negotiations, President F.W. de Klerk,
African National Congress leader Nelson
Mandela and other senior political lead
ers ratified in a penstroke a new South
African system committed to equality.
Along with a color-blind constitution,
the negotiators approved a bill of rights
and electoral laws that eliminate the sys
tem that denied its black majority of basic
human rights and sent Mandela to jail for
27 years.
"We have reached the end of an era,"
Mandela told the signing ceremony
attended by political leaders, other dele

gates and international observers. "We
are at the beginning of a new era.
"We can build a society grounded on
friendship and our common humanity —
a society founded on tolerance. That is
the only road open to us. ... Let us join
hands and march to the future," he said.
The government and ANC, which
dominated the frantic last-minute bar
gaining that brought the long negotia
tions to a dramatic close, hope the step
will abolish their country's notoriety as a
racist pariah.
But opponents who boycotted the
talks, including white extremists seeking
to avoid black rule, contend the constitu
tion's ideals of justice, equality and
humanity will be ignored by a future
ANC government and its Communist
Party allies.
The boycotting groups, known as the

Freedom Alliance, want greater autono
my in a post-apartheid South Africa.
The alliance, which groups well-armed
white, right-wing organizations, the pow
erful Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party
and the two conservative homelands of
Ciskei and Bophuthatswana, has warned
the government and ANC against con
cluding any constitution without its con
sent.
De Klerk aides said negotiating doors
would remain open to the alliance and the
president would meet with its leaders
tomorrow.
The new constitution grants the right
to vote to all South Africans, guarantees
restitution for land expropriated from
blacks and attempts to give each of the
country's diverse ethnic groups a propor
tionate say in how their country will be
run.
