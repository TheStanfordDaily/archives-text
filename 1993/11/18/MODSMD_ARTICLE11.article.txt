Senate bans assault weapons
WASHINGTON (AP) - Heeding the
nation's rising concern over street vio
lence, the Senate voted yesterday to ban
the manufacture or sale of 19 types of
assault-style weapons.
The ban, stiffer than any previously
passed by either house of Congress, was
approved despite the opposition of the
National Rifle Association. The action came
as the Senate neared passage of a $22.3 bil
lion anti-crime bill that would put more
police on the streets and build new prisons.
The assault-style weapons ban was
among the final amendments to be consid
ered before the Senate votes on the full crime
bill, which would then go to the House.
"Fear has escalated in this country to a
level I never thought possible," said Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the author of

the gun ban. She said the provision
"addresses a fundamental right of all
Americans to feel safe."
Nigerian leader ousted
LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) â€” A general with
a history of engineering military coups
forced out Nigeria's civilian leader yester
day and took control of Africa's most pop
ulous nation.
Gen. Sani Abacha, the defense minister
and the man considered to be the real
power behind the government, forced out
the titular head of state, Ernest Shonekan,
a former corporate executive.

tion of anonymity, said Shonekan's ouster
resulted from a meeting of military leaders
last week about the political turmoil grip
