University cannot afford
to subsidize off-campus
student-adviser dinners

THERE IS NO such thing as a
free lunch. As anyone who
has taken Econ 1 knows, a
decision to have more of something
is simultaneously a decision to
have less of something else.
And, in this time of University
wide budget reductions, a decision
to keep one program undoubtedly
means that something else will
face the budgetary ax.
Those items which have ap
peared on the chopping block have
been multifarious â€” from cut
backs that have gutted many of
Meyer Library's services to cam
pus-wide food service reductions.
And at the Center for Teaching
and Learning, the general tutor
ing budget has been cut by 25 per
cent in the last two years. Budget
cuts have halved the number of
hours of general tutoring each
student may receive, from 16 to
eight per quarter. Furthermore,
CTL can expect further revenue
reductions in the next three years
on the scale of 15 percent to 30
percent.
There may be no easy answers
to this budgetary morass, but all
concede that programs of ques
tionable benefit should be elimi
nated, especially when there may
be cheaper ways to provide the
same service.
A clear example of such an
extravagant program is the
Undergraduate Advising Center's
system of paying for academic
advising dinners. The UAC reim
burses freshman advisers $8 per
advisee for dinners at a restaurant
or at the home of the adviser.
This program is an opulence
that's responsible for thousands of
dollars of University expendi
tures.
How much more is it worth to
have adviser dinners at someone's

house than in a student's own res
idence? Several are held in dorms
each year, and they are quite suc
cessful. Is Residential Education
really that ineffective at providing
a "home" for students to feel com
fortable discussing their futures
that it is necessary to subsidize
these culinary field trips?
The question is whether the
University should spend scarce
resources on adviser dinners off
campus. Clearly, they should not,
especially when other valuable
programs are being eliminated. A
freshman adviser's worth is a
function of what they do, not the
particular environment in which
they meet with students one night
of the year.
One could contend that the
prospect of a free lunch will entice
normally reticent students to seek
good advice about their academic
future. But the University should
not be forced to bribe students to
seek advice. If the UAC feels it
needs to pay students, maybe it's a
reflection of the interest students
have in being advised or the quali
ty of advice they feel they're get
ting from their assigned advisers.
Although $8 per head may
appear to be an insignificant sum
of money, it is equal to the cost of a
student ticket to the Stanford-
Notre Dame football game, or a
new volume for Meyer or Green
Library. Furthermore, when multi
plied by the legions of students who
are advised every year, it is clear
that the thousands of dollars spent
on these dinners present a signifi
cant burden to the University.
Finally, one must remember
that these are only freshman
advisers, passively assigned from
pre-freshman questionnaires. If
the UAC really wants to facilitate
good academic advice, it would
foot the bill for dinners held
between students within a partic
ular department and their advis
ers.
Although an off-campus meal
may be a tasty break from Food
Service, the University can no
longer afford to provide free
lunches.
