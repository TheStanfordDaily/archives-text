## Cutting the ties that bind 
### 
I REMEMBER when my best friend
was jilted, early in her junior year.
She retreated into herself, sleeping 12
hours a night and bursting into tears at
unexpected moments. She stopped eating
or exercising. She looked like hell.
In the long run, of course, she was
better off without him. She is happily
married to a better person. In the short
run, though, it made her bitter, unpro
ductive and difficult to be around.
Last week, when Stanford announced
another round of budget cutting, it
seemed a lot like the end of a relation
ship. Just as my friend was told "Sorry,
I guess it isn't going to work out," as a
man she loved walked out of her life,
Stanford seems equally cavalier about
severing relationships with longtime
employees.
These cuts, of up to 30 percent over
three years, will likely lead to many per
sonnel reductions in administrative
areas such as Human Resources, Stu
dent Affairs, Public Affairs and Finance.
The question is not whether reduc
tions should take place. In the long run
Stanford will be better off for balancing
its budget.
However, as any good therapist will
tell you about the end of a relationship,
it is healthier and more honest to
acknowledge the feelings that a break
up creates.
Apparently Stanford lacks a good
therapist. Instead of acknowledging the

extent of individual and collective suf
fering we are about to undergo, the offi
cial language being used to talk about
budget and personnel cuts attempts to
smooth over the seething pain and con
flict which exists in the Stanford com
munity.
The comments which accompanied
the announcement of the cuts were mat
ter-of-fact and benign: "Don't panic.
This is business as usual in the '90s.
People shouldn't think of this as a major
budget-cutting exercise. We want the
community to be calm about this." A fel
low grad student said it reminded him of
civil defense warnings: "Return to your
homes and no one will be hurt."
This rhetoric doesn't match the expe
rience of many people in the areas slated
for cuts. When aspirin bottles are being
passed around at 8 a.m. staff meetings,
this is not business as usual. Staff mem
bers are exhibiting classic stress symp
toms.
We like to think that the University is
a place where the education of students
and the pursuit of knowledge are the
paramount goals. We like to think that
we are all committed to the same vision
and work to the same ends. From that
perspective we may forget that the Uni
versity is also a workplace.
Like any workplace undergoing that
quintessentially '90s exercise known as
"retrenchment," it is now a place of con
flict, pain and fear. With cuts pending it

is a place where workers fear they will be
laid off. Staff members feel jealousy and
are suddenly in competition for survival
with colleagues they have liked, respect
ed and cooperated with for years. There
should be an acceptable way to talk open-!
ly and honestly about these issues.
Instead people are told not to panic.
This is more than a problem for indi
viduals; it is an organizational dysfunc
tion. Soothing rhetoric serves to further
disconnect the leadership from the peo
ple whose support they most need now.
Presenting the benign facade of a trou
ble-free environment does not mitigate
the pain of the people in the trenches. It
only serves to further alienate them.
Wouldn't we be a better University if
we acknowledged the reality of people's
experiences? Wouldn't it be more honest
to say: "We will be radically cutting bud
gets in some areas. It will hurt us all. It
will mean that people we like and care
about will not be with us any more." We
must be honest about the complicated
feelings that this process engenders. To
do anything less does a disservice to
truth. And truth is what a university
must stand for.

Chris thanks Brian for helping her
deconstruct the University.
