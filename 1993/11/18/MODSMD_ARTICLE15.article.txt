## Religious studies classes can add to campus discussion 
### 
1 WOULD LIKE to echo the senti
ments expressed in Jeremi Suri's
Nov. 9 column, "Rare Discussion of
Religion." In it, he notes that while
there has been a healthy and vigorous
discussion on issues of culture on cam
pus, there has not been a similar conver
sation regarding religious issues.
It is a truism that the fastest way to
bring polite conversation to a dead halt
is to bring up the subject of religion.
Suri points out a couple of problems
with this attitude.
First, reflective people will ultimate
ly confront certain problems and ques
tions that have often received the most
thoughtful and profound treatment by
religious thinkers and traditions.
Issues such as the problem of evil, the
nature of the self, the confrontation
with death, the foundation of values,
the problem of relativism and (the one
that gives Suri sleepless nights and
headaches) the meaning of life are at
the heart of religious exploration.
Second, what is implicit in Suri's

discussion is that we simply cannot
understand human beings, cultures
and societies without grappling with
religious issues, for religion has always
and everywhere been a defining part of
human life.
In our so-called "secular" society, by
just about any way of measuring,
Americans are becoming more and
more religious. The American mosaic is
composed not only of different ethnic
and racial groups, but (although it is
often neglected in conversation) every
major religious denomination and
belief system. While this can lead to
conflict and strife, it also provides us
with a remarkable opportunity.
Here at Stanford, we probably have
representatives of most of the world
religions, yet dialogue among these
groups is lamentably rare. Suri's rec
ommendation that we talk more about
religion and religious issues is an
admirable one. Let me add one sugges
tion to his discussion — that students
who are interested in these issues take

some classes in the Religious Studies
department.
Suri's complaint that "with the
exception of the religious groups on
campus, most Stanford students do not
voice these frustrating questions out
loud" is only partially true. They may
not do it often in the dorms, but I have
witnessed students struggling with
these vexing questions in section discus
sions that have proven to be remarkable
venues for increased understanding and
appreciation of rich traditions (both
their own and others'), greater self
understanding and even personal trans
formation (it was one such class that
inspired me to apply to the graduate
program in Religious Studies).
While these classes may not provide
the answers, they can help us think in
more sophisticated ways about the
problems and expose us to the attempts
of other thinkers and traditions (as
well as fellow students) to solve them.
The reason these section discussions
have been some of the best I have ever

had is because the issues matter so
much to all of us.
I am glad that Suri recognizes that,
although he has "never been a very
religious person," he can learn a lot
from the study of religion. In fact, the
best classes often combine fervent
believers and non-believers.
So my suggestion (admittedly a
biased one) is this: take a class that
allows you to either encounter a new
religious tradition, re-encounter your
own tradition, or deal with issues in
the theory and philosophy of religion.
Classes such as these can help you
engage, appreciate and evaluate the
varieties of forms of religious expres
sion and the differing conceptions of
human flourishing the world has pro
duced. At the very least, it can lead to
the kinds of reflection and conversa
tions that produce better understand
ing of self and others. And it could
change your life.
