# Stanford masses do not need exposure to ASSU Flicks' "Bites"
## 
### 
I had the misfortune, two weeks ago,
of seeing "Man Bites Dog" at Sunday
Flicks. However, even more than the
film itself, it disturbed me that the man
agers of Flicks would choose to show it
at all.
In my opinion, "Man Bites Dog" was
everything that a Flick should NOT be:
1. In a foreign language.
2. In black and white.
3. Unnecessarily vulgar and offensive.
Additionally, the mfiyority of the audi
ence was given no warning as to the
film's content, other than being told that
it would be in French. And this informa

tion came only a few minutes before the
movie started.
My usual idea of Sunday Flicks is not
as some revelatory, deeply philosophical,
sociopolitical racquetball match. I will
not try to debate the significance of
"Man Bites Dog" as a film, but I will
argue that Sunday Flicks was not the
proper forum in which to present such a
thing.
I believe that most people go to Flicks
expecting to be entertained, by the car
toon if nothing else, and to take their
mind off the pressures of life for an hour
or three. Flicks has never been adver
tised as an "artsy" event — I doubt it
ever could be, with its legacy of paper
fights and other such frivolity — and if
the managers are revising the idea, they
could at least let the rest of us know
first.
Personally, I was rather insulted by

the judgment implicit in how the film
was presented, and by N'Gai Croal's
subsequent Daily article on why it was
presented. There seems to be a group of
people who regard the Stanford masses
as dumb, sheltered brutes, who know
nothing of the "real world" and need to
be disturbed once in a while. Most of us
are very worldly; we've seen and heard
plenty before and since we got to Stan
ford. That's part of the reason we're
here at all. We don't need to be exposed
to an explicit gang rape scene any more
than we need to have our bicycles stolen,
or our houses shot up in a drive-by.
We're big enough to know better, and we
could do without any more of these
"heartfelt gifts," thank you very much.
There is more to cinema and art than
being able to disturb people. I can dis
turb people by kicking them in the stom
ach. It's much harder to move people,

emotionally and spiritually. I've seen
very few films that have been able to do
that, and I respect them highly. "Man
Bites Dog" was NOT one of them.
Let joy and innocence prevail.
