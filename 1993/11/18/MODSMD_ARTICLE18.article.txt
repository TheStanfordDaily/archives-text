## Spikers seek cold revenge 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volleyball team will not
only test the postseason waters this weekend, it is
hoping to dunk two of its biggest rivals.
In its final two Pacific 10 Conference matches of
the season, the sixth-ranked Cardinal (19-5, 12-4 in
the Pac-10) hopes to avenge early season defeats as it
faces off against No. 13 USC (18-7,10-6) tonight, fol
lowed by a match with No. 1 UCLA (24-1, 15-1) Fri
day evening. Both matches start at 7 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.
"What makes these matches important is that
these are playoff teams — highly ranked playoff
teams," said coach Don Shaw. "Now is a chance to
find out how well we've really been playing when we
start playing the upper part of the Pac-10 and start
getting into the NCAA tournament."
After winning both its matches in Oregon last
weekend, the Cardinal holds second place in the Pac
-10 and is thereby guaranteed a spot in the NCAA
tournament. The Cardinal's performance over the
next two nights will determine the team's final rank
ing, not to mention its confidence level going into the
postseason.
"Where we're seeded will be determined by how
well we play," Shaw said. "I don't want to go into a
match against USC or UCLA in the playoffs having
lost both times — it would be nice to get a little confi
dence before we go in."
While a victory over the top-ranked team in the
nation would please any team, the Cardinal is pri
marily focusing on its contest against USC, as the
Trojans are one of Stanford's biggest competitors for
a top spot in the Western region.
"We really want to go in and play well," said
junior tri-captain Anne Wicks. "Winning would be a
good boost of confidence."
After falling in its September meeting with USC 14-
16,17-19,8-15 and dropping a close match to UCLA 15-
7, 15-2, 8-15, 10-15, 12-15, the Cardinal will have the
chance to measure its progress over the season as well
as preview teams it is likely to see again in December.
While much of the Cardinal's success will rely on
the play of the starting six, Shaw also considers Stan
ford's traditionally strong effort off the bench as a key
factor.
"Neither of these teams have changed very much,"
Shaw said. "They're basically the same lineup and the
same personnel as they were earlier. Our depth has
been a factor over the course of the year in that we
have a lot of people and a lot of combinations of things
we can do."
The Cardinal will have plenty of opportunities to
display its improvement against the Trojans' tough
outside attack and their strong middle game. Senior
outside hitter Katie Haller not only leads the USC
offense with 369 kills, she has also proven herself one
of the nations top defensive players, averaging 4.3 digs
per game.
"We're going to have to be able to win rallies the
long way instead of the easy way — pass, set, hit,
boom, rally over," Shaw said. "It's going to be more of
a case of how long the rallies last and how organized
we can stay."
Stanford will face a further challenge from a tough
Trojan middle attack headed by blockers Meika Wag
ner and Lauri Yust. Wagner stands out as one of Pac
10's top middle blockers with 357 kills, 111 blocks and
170 digs. Yust boosts the USC net game with 138
blocks.
"I expect USC to be veiy tough in the middle,"
Shaw said. "Their middle attack is tremendous."
