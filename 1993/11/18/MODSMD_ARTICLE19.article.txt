# Tigers and bears, oh my
## Polo must find courage to beat UOP, Cal 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
After a pair of losses last Saturday at
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
Tournament, the Cardinal water polo
team will look to reverse their fortunes
this weekend at deGuerre Pool against
No. 5 Pacific on Friday at 3 p.m. and No. 2
California Saturday at 10 a.m.
Although Stanford (20-5) retained its
No. 1 ranking in the national coaches poll,
Cal, USC, UC-Irvine and Pacific are all
breathing down the necks of coach Dante
Dettamanti and his squad.
"The top five has been established.

These are the teams who will be going to
NCAAs," Dettamanti said. "The seeding
has not yet been established. The NCAA
committee meeting for seeding will be
Sunday after this weekend's play."
The weekend will feature the final
home appearances for Stanford's seniors.
"For a lot of us, these will be our last
games here," said senior Chris Wallin.
"The Big Splash will be the last time. With
all the people watching, we want to win for
them and for ourselves."
Fellow senior Antonio Busquets added,
"I'm looking forward to these games. I
won't be very happy unless we
win."
Ail-American goal tender Larry
Bercutt, a four-year starter, will
also be making his final appearance
in deGuerre Pool. Bercutt, who has
amassed 184 saves this year, has
participated in two NCAA finals, as
a freshman and a junior.
Aside from the spotlight on the
seniors, Stanford will be looking to
regain the confidence and execution
it displayed in starting the season
15-1, before falling to UOP in
Stockton.
"We have a big incentive to
knock off UOP," Dettamanti said.
"This is the best team they've ever
had. They started us out on this los
ing streak. We kind of owe them."
Since being upset by the Tigers

in mid-October, Stanford has a
record of 5-4, including wins over
No. 15 UC-Davis and unranked
Loyola Marymount.
On Saturday at the Big Splash,
the Cardinal will meet the Golden
Bears, who beat Stanford 10-8 in
overtime on their way to winning
the MPSF Tourney.
"Cal is an excellent team," Detta
manti said. "1 always thought they'd
be our toughest competition. Early
in the season, they were struggling
to find their team identity."
Busquets pointed out that two
losses this week would also extend
the Cardinal's losing streak.
"If we lose two, we'd be on a
four-game losing streak," he said.
"It wouldn't be good for our confi
dence or for our ranking.
"This weekend, it's really impor
tant that we play like the No. 1
team," Bercutt said. "We have to
win to show that we are ready to be
the NCAA Champions."
