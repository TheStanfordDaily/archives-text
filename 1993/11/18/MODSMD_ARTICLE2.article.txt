## Government may impose testing in contract

workers are concerned that the Depart
ment of Energy may impose mandatory
drug testing — a potentially precedent-set
ting policy that could affect all University
departments with government contracts.
According to Lon Warneke, a union
steward at SLAC, the United Stanford
Workers fear the DOE will implement
mandatory drug testing under a new con
tract, which he said the union would find
"intrusive . . . and an invasion of privacy."
"IWorkers| are appalled at the idea," he
said.
SLAC workers are currently under a
one-year contract extension with the DOE

and will begin negotiations for a new five
year contract within the next year, said
DOE spokesperson John Belluardo.
According to Assoc. University Counsel
Rachel Howard, the Drug-Free Workplace
Act of 1988 requires all federal facilities to
have anti-drug and alcohol programming
and education. In addition, workers who
fall into certain categories — including
those who work with hazardous materials
— are subject to mandatory testing.
Howard said SLAC is preparing a state
ment for the DOE — to be submitted by
Nov. 30 — which explains the center's posi
tion on drug testing. She said the center be
lieves that no positions there qualify for
mandatory testing.
