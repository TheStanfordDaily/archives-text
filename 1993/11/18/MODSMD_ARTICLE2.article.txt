# SLAC workers wary of possible drug tests
## Government may impose testing in contract 
### Elise Wolfgram Editorial staff 
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
workers are concerned that the Depart
ment of Energy may impose mandatory
drug testing — a potentially precedent-set
ting policy that could affect all University
departments with government contracts.
According to Lon Warneke, a union
steward at SLAC, the United Stanford
Workers fear the DOE will implement
mandatory drug testing under a new con
tract, which he said the union would find
"intrusive . . . and an invasion of privacy."
"IWorkers| are appalled at the idea," he
said.
SLAC workers are currently under a
one-year contract extension with the DOE

and will begin negotiations for a new five
year contract within the next year, said
DOE spokesperson John Belluardo.
According to Assoc. University Counsel
Rachel Howard, the Drug-Free Workplace
Act of 1988 requires all federal facilities to
have anti-drug and alcohol programming
and education. In addition, workers who
fall into certain categories — including
those who work with hazardous materials
— are subject to mandatory testing.
Howard said SLAC is preparing a state
ment for the DOE — to be submitted by
Nov. 30 — which explains the center's posi
tion on drug testing. She said the center be
lieves that no positions there qualify for
mandatory testing.
However, Howard admitted,
"They hold all the cards here. It's a
delicate issue."
"They have the option of accept
ing [SLAC's proposall or they could
just impose their own orders,"
Warneke said.
In the event that the DOE man
dates drug testing at SLAC,
Howard said it could affect the rest
of the University.
"The University is a federal con
tractor ... this is truly [the govern
ment's! call," she said, explaining
that the federal government might
try to apply the Drug Free Work
place Act to all future projects it
helps fund. However, she said she
does not think such action is likely.
Howard said there is no set
timetable for a DOE response. She
added that the University does have
the option of refusing their man
date, but would then risk the loss of
funding.
"The University can refuse to do
any of this," she said. "But what
we're trying to do is to follow the
law."
The DOE has negotiated several
contracts in the past with universi
ties similar to Stanford. Howard
said the decisions have ranged from
no mandatory testing at UC-Berke
ley to stringent testing at Lawrence
Livermort* Laboratories.

Warn eke said there are two pos
sible types of drug testing the DOE
could impose — random and "for
reasonable suspicion," which occurs
when a worker appears to be under
the influence of a drug.
SLAC engineering physicist Jack
Truher said workers have many
specific complaints about DOE
drug-testing policies as listed in the
DOE Federal Register, including
the use of a monitor at the collec
tion site to determine if a sufficient
amount of urine has been collected.
"The individual may be given rea
sonable amount of liquid and a rea
sonable amount of time in which to
provide the specimen required," the
register states. If the worker does
not provide the urine, disciplinary
measures may be taken.
Truher said he is also worried
that, under the DOE proposal,
workers who refused to be tested
are considered guilty, yet no expla
nation of the circumstances is made
in their records.
Truher and other concerned
workers have been discussing drug
testing at weekly employee-rights
meetings at SLAC and plan to issue
a statement on drug testing in the
next few weeks.
Warneke said the union is not
against all DOE-imposed programs.
For example, he said the union sup
ports DOE-imposed anti-drug and
alcohol education and program
ming.
"We appreciate that and think
it's good for our workers," he said.
