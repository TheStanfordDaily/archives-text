# Exhibition game a sloppy win for Cardinal
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
It wasn't pretty, and it was only
an exhibition — but at least it was
a win.
The Stanford men's basketball
team opened its season with a BO
SS win over the Blue & Gold Fleet
last night in Maples Pavilion, and
the Cardinal may have discovered
its new starting point guard in
freshman Brevin Knight.
With nine assists, four steals
and only one turnover in 23 min
utes, Knight sparkled before foul
ing out with 1:51 to play in the sec
ond half.
"Brevin played well. We're
excited about him," said head
coach Mike Montgomery. "He did a
nice job of distributing the ball."
Among Knight's brightest
moments were a full-court outlet
pass to Andy Poppink for an easy
lay-up, followed minutes later by a
three-quarters court pass to Dion
Cross for another uncontested
bucket.
The Cardinal was in control for
most of the game, as its lead
against the Blue & Gold Fleet —
an Amateur Athletic Union team
based in San Francisco — hovered
around 10 points. The Fleet never
got any closer than three points
with about five minutes left in the
first half, and Stanford actually

jumped out to an 18-point lead
midway through the second half.
Leading the Stanford scorers
were junior forward Poppink
with 20 points, junior guard
David Harbour with 16 points,
and 18 points each by senior for
ward Brent Williams and sopho
more guard Cross.
Williams and Poppink helped
the Cardinal to a 54-34 rebound
ing advantage with 11 and 8
rebounds, respectively.
Stanford shot 44.9 percent
from the field, compared to 47.6
percent for the Fleet. The Fleet
was paced by 22 points from for
mer University of San Francisco
guard Kevin Weatherby, including
5 of 7 from behind the three-point
line.
Montgomery said he saw both
positives and negatives after the
game, noting that the Cardinal
defense allowed the Fleet to shoot
much better than he had hoped.
"The most disappointing two
things about this game were our
defense at the point of attack
that allowed them to get a lot of
shots, and our picking up people
in transition. We weren't locating
people and that let them get open
shots," Montgomery said.
"We're a long ways from being
where we want to be, and we
need to keep pushing to do the
things we need to do to win."
