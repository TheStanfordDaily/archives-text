# Voice of Cardinal is fixture on Farm
## Murphy recounts 29 years behind mike 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
In 1964, Bob Murphy sat down at
a microphone in South Bend, Ind., to
call the Stanford-Notre Dame foot
ball game.
Twenty-nine years later, Murphy
hasn't left his seat.
Murphy, 62, has announced at
least one Stanford football game each
year since 1964, when Don Klien,
who had announced Stanford foot
ball since the mid-'sos, asked Mur
phy to join him in the booth. At the
time, Murphy was directing a season
ticket promotion and marketing pro
gram for Stanford football, and was
invited by the Department of Athlet
ics to go on the road trip.
Murphy was so successful coordi
nating the ticket sales that athletic
director Chuck Taylor hired him full
time as the manager of Athletic Rela
tions in 1965. That same year, Klien
invited Murphy to be his color com
mentator, and until 1974 neither of
them ever missed a game.
Though he moved among various
positions within collegiate and pro
fessional athletics before settling
down permanently as Stanford's
announcer in 1983, Murphy man
aged to keep the consecutive-atten
dance streak alive in the intervening
years when he was not employed by
Stanford.
"I went to work with Jack Nick
alus in 1975 on the Memorial (pro
fessional golf) Tournament in
Columbus, Ohio," Murphy said. "But
Stanford's first two games that year
were Penn State and Michigan, both
back there, so I did the games."
San Jose State hired Murphy to be
its athletic director in 1976, and he

announced Spartan football until
1979. In each of those two seasons,
Stanford and San Jose State clashed
on tho field. Murphy then became
general manager of a local cable
channel until 1982, broadcasting a
few Stanford games on television
each year, before becoming a fixture
on Cardinal broadcasts — both foot
ball and basketball — in 1983.
Murphy's ties to Stanford are
deeper than calling touchdowns,
however. He was a pitcher on the
Stanford baseball team as an under
graduate, posting an 8-1 record in his
senior year on Stanford's first-ever
College World Series team. After
graduating in 1953, Murphy tried his
hand at the ranks and
then worked for U.S. Steel. It was his
love for Stanford that brought him
back to collegiate athletics.
"At Stanford athletics are truly
part of the educational process,"
Murphy said. "It was for me when I
was an athlete. I didn't pretend to be
a great student — the biggest deci
sion I had was if it was raining we
went to the races, if it wasn't we
played golf.
"But I have always felt that coach
es will leave young people with many
more lessons in life much more
impressionably than teachers in the
classroom. Stanford does it better
than any school in the country and
certainly at the highest level."
Since he has watched Stanford
sports closely for 40 years, Murphy
feels an obligation to share his
knowledge and observations with his
listeners.
"I'm a great believer in linkage,"
Murphy said. "It's very important at
Stanford to maintain linkage with
the past. You don't want to ever
lose the connection with the Vow
Boys, and Frankie Albert and the
wow boys, Hank Luisetti, all the
great Olympians... you don't want
to forget who those people are and
how great they were, because there
are still people alive who built the
foundation on which we operate
today."
Announcers who have worked
with Murphy are awed both by his
knowledge and his skill.
"He's a walking encyclopedia on
Stanford," said Hal Ramey, who
was Murphy's broadcast partner
during the 1980s on KCBS Radio.
"His recall of events and names is
mind-boggling. I've never seen any
one like him."
"Unlike a lot of color com menta

tors, I can just sort of throw any
thing up there and I know he can
hit it back," said current Stanford
football play-by-play announcer
Barry Tompkins. "And of course,
he knows where every bone at
Stanford is buried."
As both an alumnus and a
broadcaster, Murphy has a special
place in his heart reserved for the
Big Game with California.
"It's an absolutely treasured
rivalry," Murphy said. "It's been
passed along from one generation
to another. The Big Game as it will
be played this week will be fab
ulous — there will be 80,000 people
there — but it's no different than in
1921 when Stanford Stadium first
opened. No two schools celebrate a
game of football the way these two
schools do. They share the game
and everything leading up to it."
As well as the general aspects of
the cross-Bay showdown, Murphy
has particular Big Games that he
recalls with fondness.

By far Murphy's most memo
rable Big Game — and perhaps
that of the majority of Stanford
fans alive today — was the 27-25
Stanford victory at Berkeley in
1990.
"That was really funny because I
do a locker room show and I went
down (to the field) with every
prospect of doing a losing locker
room show," Murphy said. "That
press box is hard to get out of there
and here comes the onsides kick
and all that stuff.
"I am exactly now 10 yards from
the spot where Kevin Moen ran
into the end zone in 1982 (on the
famous five-lateral play) eight years
before.
"The Stanford band is standing
exactly in the same place it was in
1982. I made it my personal chal
lenge and assignment to advise
every member of the band that they
would keep their toes behind the
line.
"He (John Hopkins) kicked the

field goal right over my head."
Along with certain games and
plays, what Murphy treasures most
about Stanford is its people.
"I think the notion of the Stan
ford family is important," Mur
phy said. "One of the great joys in
life is your friends and associa
tions and the people you know
and have experiences with — and
with Stanford football there are
just so many."
And many consider Murphy the
head of the household.
"A number of Stanford athletes
that I've noticed over the years
sort of regard him as the unofficial
father figure of Stanford athlet
ics," said former Stanford basket
ball player John Platz, now Mur
phy's sidekick on Stanford basket
ball broadcasts. "He seems to
know everybody personally, and
that's real remarkable as a college
announcer."

the job.

be played this week will be fab
ulous — there will be 80,000 people
there — but it's no different than in
1921 when Stanford Stadium first
opened. No two schools celebrate a
game of football the way these two
schools do. They share the game
and everything leading up to it."
As well as the general aspects of
the cross-Bay showdown, Murphy
has particular Big Games that he
recalls with fondness.

By far Murphy's most memo
rable Big Game — and perhaps
that of the majority of Stanford
fans alive today — was the 27-25
Stanford victory at Berkeley in
1990.
"That was really funny because I
do a locker room show and I went
down (to the field) with every
prospect of doing a losing locker
room show," Murphy said. "That
press box is hard to get out of there
and here comes the onsides kick
and all that stuff.
"I am exactly now 10 yards from
the spot where Kevin Moen ran
into the end zone in 1982 (on the
famous five-lateral play) eight years
before.
"The Stanford band is standing
exactly in the same place it was in
1982. I made it my personal chal
lenge and assignment to advise
every member of the band that they
would keep their toes behind the
line.
"He (John Hopkins) kicked the

field goal right over my head."
Along with certain games and
plays, what Murphy treasures most
about Stanford is its people.
"I think the notion of the Stan
ford family is important," Mur
phy said. "One of the great joys in
life is your friends and associa
tions and the people you know
and have experiences with — and
with Stanford football there are
just so many."
And many consider Murphy the
head of the household.
"A number of Stanford athletes
that I've noticed over the years
sort of regard him as the unofficial
father figure of Stanford athlet
ics," said former Stanford basket
ball player John Platz, now Mur
phy's sidekick on Stanford basket
ball broadcasts. "He seems to
know everybody personally, and
that's real remarkable as a college
announcer."
For Bob Murphy, it comes with
the job.
In 1964, Bob Murphy sat down at
a microphone in South Bend, Ind., to
call the Stanford-Notre Dame foot
ball game.
Twenty-nine years later, Murphy
hasn't left his seat.
Murphy, 62, has announced at
least one Stanford football game each
year since 1964, when Don Klien,
who had announced Stanford foot
ball since the mid-'sos, asked Mur
phy to join him in the booth. At the
time, Murphy was directing a season
ticket promotion and marketing pro
gram for Stanford football, and was
invited by the Department of Athlet
ics to go on the road trip.
Murphy was so successful coordi
nating the ticket sales that athletic
director Chuck Taylor hired him full
time as the manager of Athletic Rela
tions in 1965. That same year, Klien
invited Murphy to be his color com
mentator, and until 1974 neither of
them ever missed a game.
Though he moved among various
positions within collegiate and pro
fessional athletics before settling
down permanently as Stanford's
announcer in 1983, Murphy man
aged to keep the consecutive-atten
dance streak alive in the intervening
years when he was not employed by
Stanford.
"I went to work with Jack Nick
alus in 1975 on the Memorial (pro
fessional golf) Tournament in
Columbus, Ohio," Murphy said. "But
Stanford's first two games that year
were Penn State and Michigan, both
back there, so I did the games."
San Jose State hired Murphy to be
its athletic director in 1976, and he

announced Spartan football until
1979. In each of those two seasons,
Stanford and San Jose State clashed
on tho field. Murphy then became
general manager of a local cable
channel until 1982, broadcasting a
few Stanford games on television
each year, before becoming a fixture
on Cardinal broadcasts — both foot
ball and basketball — in 1983.
Murphy's ties to Stanford are
deeper than calling touchdowns,
however. He was a pitcher on the
Stanford baseball team as an under
graduate, posting an 8-1 record in his
senior year on Stanford's first-ever
College World Series team. After
graduating in 1953, Murphy tried his
hand at the ranks and
then worked for U.S. Steel. It was his
love for Stanford that brought him
back to collegiate athletics.
"At Stanford athletics are truly
part of the educational process,"
Murphy said. "It was for me when I
was an athlete. I didn't pretend to be
a great student — the biggest deci
sion I had was if it was raining we
went to the races, if it wasn't we
played golf.
"But I have always felt that coach
es will leave young people with many
more lessons in life much more
impressionably than teachers in the
classroom. Stanford does it better
than any school in the country and
certainly at the highest level."
Since he has watched Stanford
sports closely for 40 years, Murphy
feels an obligation to share his
knowledge and observations with his
listeners.
"I'm a great believer in linkage,"
Murphy said. "It's very important at
Stanford to maintain linkage with
the past. You don't want to ever
lose the connection with the Vow
Boys, and Frankie Albert and the
wow boys, Hank Luisetti, all the
great Olympians... you don't want
to forget who those people are and
how great they were, because there
are still people alive who built the
foundation on which we operate
today."
Announcers who have worked
with Murphy are awed both by his
knowledge and his skill.
"He's a walking encyclopedia on
Stanford," said Hal Ramey, who
was Murphy's broadcast partner
during the 1980s on KCBS Radio.
"His recall of events and names is
mind-boggling. I've never seen any
one like him."
"Unlike a lot of color com menta

tors, I can just sort of throw any
thing up there and I know he can
hit it back," said current Stanford
football play-by-play announcer
Barry Tompkins. "And of course,
he knows where every bone at
Stanford is buried."
As both an alumnus and a
broadcaster, Murphy has a special
place in his heart reserved for the
Big Game with California.
"It's an absolutely treasured
rivalry," Murphy said. "It's been
passed along from one generation
to another. The Big Game as it will
be played this week will be fab
ulous — there will be 80,000 people
there — but it's no different than in
1921 when Stanford Stadium first
