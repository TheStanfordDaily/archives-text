## Murphy recounts 29 years behind mike

In 1964, Bob Murphy sat down at
a microphone in South Bend, Ind., to
call the Stanford-Notre Dame foot
ball game.
Twenty-nine years later, Murphy
hasn't left his seat.
Murphy, 62, has announced at
least one Stanford football game each
year since 1964, when Don Klien,
who had announced Stanford foot
ball since the mid-'sos, asked Mur
phy to join him in the booth. At the
time, Murphy was directing a season
ticket promotion and marketing pro
gram for Stanford football, and was
invited by the Department of Athlet
ics to go on the road trip.
Murphy was so successful coordi
nating the ticket sales that athletic
director Chuck Taylor hired him full
time as the manager of Athletic Rela
tions in 1965. That same year, Klien
invited Murphy to be his color com
mentator, and until 1974 neither of
them ever missed a game.
Though he moved among various
positions within collegiate and pro
fessional athletics before settling
down permanently as Stanford's
announcer in 1983, Murphy man
aged to keep the consecutive-atten
dance streak alive in the intervening
years when he was not employed by
Stanford.
"I went to work with Jack Nick
alus in 1975 on the Memorial (pro
fessional golf) Tournament in
Columbus, Ohio," Murphy said. "But
Stanford's first two games that year
were Penn State and Michigan, both
back there, so I did the games."
San Jose State hired Murphy to be
its athletic director in 1976, and he

announced Spartan football until
1979. In each of those two seasons,
Stanford and San Jose State clashed
on tho field. Murphy then became
general manager of a local cable
channel until 1982, broadcasting a
few Stanford games on television
each year, before becoming a fixture
on Cardinal broadcasts — both foot
ball and basketball — in 1983.
Murphy's ties to Stanford are
deeper than calling touchdowns,
however. He was a pitcher on the
Stanford baseball team as an under
graduate, posting an 8-1 record in his
senior year on Stanford's first-ever
College World Series team. After
graduating in 1953, Murphy tried his
hand at the ranks and
then worked for U.S. Steel. It was his
love for Stanford that brought him
back to collegiate athletics.
"At Stanford athletics are truly
part of the educational process,"
Murphy said. "It was for me when I
was an athlete. I didn't pretend to be
a great student — the biggest deci
sion I had was if it was raining we
went to the races, if it wasn't we
played golf.
"But I have always felt that coach
es will leave young people with many
more lessons in life much more
impressionably than teachers in the
classroom. Stanford does it better
than any school in the country and
certainly at the highest level."
Since he has watched Stanford
sports closely for 40 years, Murphy
feels an obligation to share his
knowledge and observations with his
listeners.
"I'm a great believer in linkage,"
Murphy said. "It's very important at
