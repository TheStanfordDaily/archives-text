# Phil and Bob's excellent adventure
## A
						Big Game lesson 
### 
It's a college football fanatic's
wet dream.
Four months. Sixteen games.
Thirty-two of the best collegiate
football teams in the country.
Michigan vs. Notre Dame. Florida
vs. Florida State. Army vs. Navy.
The Orange Bowl!
Excuse me while I wipe my sali
va off the keyboard.
And this weekend they're here
for the big one. The Mother of all
rivalries. The one that's got it all.
Big Game.
Hmm, some of you East Coast-

ers might won
der. So it's a nice
little West Coast
rivalry. A fun
way to pass a
week or so. But
it's no Alabama-
Auburn. Doesn't
come close to a
USC-UCLA.
In terms of
tradition, sus-

tained excellence and rabid fan
devotion, it's certainly no Harvard-
Yale.
The experts beg to differ.
"Stanford-Cal is the greatest
rivalry in all of college football,"
Bob or Phil said. "It's Harvard-
Yale, but with personality and atti
tude."
OK, let me back-track. Their
names are Bob Waldstein and Phil
Silverman (as indistinguishable a
pair as I've ever met). They're both
graduates of prestigious universi
ties with crappy football teams.
After stints at equally prestigious
grad schools with equally crappy
football teams, Bob and Phil had
enough.
So they bought a funeral limo
(okay, so they're a little strange),
wrote an itinerary, and ofT they
went. Under some trumped-up
excuse of writing a book (probably
to please their mothers), this MBA
/ JD pair have dropped their stuffy,
tie-wearing, 9-to-5, Brooks Broth
ers jobs to drive around the coun
try this football season, watching
the best games the collegiate venue
has to offer.
They started in Happy Valley
on Sept. 4, with Penn State-Min

nesota, and have zig-zagged across
the country ever since. It was
Baton Rogue in mid-September for
LSU-Auburn and Tallahassee two
weeks later for the Miami-FSU
blowout. Sept. 25 saw them in
South Carolina for Clemson-Geor
gia Tech and it was Athens the
next week for Georgia-Arkansas.
Over the past couple months
they've visited almost all of the hal
lowed collegiate gridirons. From
Tuscaloosa to South Bend, they've
packed in as much football trivia
and tradition as humanly possible

into a black stretch
limo. The mice
were let loose in the
cheese factory, and
they're gorging
themselves silly.
But they ran into
a problem. The
problem of Oct. 20.
Where to go, where
to go? L.A., for

USC-UCLA? Of
back to Alabama for 'Bama-
Auburn? Perhaps even a little Big
10 action with Ohio State-Michi
gan?
Nope, Phil and Bob said, "Screw
that.' Screw Rose Bowl implica
tions, national recognition and
high-level collegiate football.
They were ofT to the Farm, for a
game that goes beyond all that.
Beyond the scores and the rank
ings. Beyond bowl bids and nation
al championship implications.
Our dynamic duo were looking
for tradition. They were looking
for atmosphere. They were looking
for legends, lore and pranks. They
were looking for the Big Game.
There was a little trepidation at
first from these two authors-in
training. "We heard it everywhere,
from everybody â€” you're going
where?" one of them said. "I mean,
we could have made FSU-Notre
Dame, then gone to Alabama-
Auburn. We wondered if perhaps
we were making a grave mistake."
They arrived in Palo Alto Sun
day night, and, after checking out
of the Motel Six because it was too
expensive (limos don't get too
