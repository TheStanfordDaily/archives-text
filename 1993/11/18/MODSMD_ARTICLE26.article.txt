# It didn't matter, but Cal still lost
## 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
Forget about statistical prob
ability, predictions or common
sense. If the Stanford vs. Cali
fornia women's swim meet was
a foreshadowing of Big Game's
outcome, Saturday's contest is
going to be a 50-0 Cardinal
romp.
In their first dual meet of the
season, the Stanford women
nabbed the first-place spot in all
but one of the 12 events against
arch rival California in yester
day's unscored, unexciting
affair at deGuerre pool. Cardi
nal athletes turned in good
times, and both coach and team
are happy with the status quo.
For now, at least. As time
goes on, the status quo will defi
nitely improve, as Stanford pre
pares to defend its national
championship in Indianapolis
next spring.
"I'm pretty pleased," said
coach Richard Quick. "I thought
we swam well for where we are
in our conditioning. I'm pleased
with the effort."
Not lofty praise, but then
again the meet was hardly a
competitive event that was
going to bring out the absolute
best in these swimmers in mid-
November.
"It's just the beginning
point," said Lea Loveless, who
made big waves by winning the
200 free in one minute, 51.50
seconds and the 200 back in
1:58.70.

Perhaps junior Jenny
Thompson forgot that this was
only the first dual meet of the
year. She wasted no time in
qualifying for NCAAs in the 100
fly, white-washing her competi
tion by nearly three seconds and
turning in a time of :54.57.
"I was really happy with my
fly," said Thompson. "I hadn't
been swimming it much in prac
tice because my shoulder's been
bothering me."
Shoulder or no shoulder,
Thompson competed well and
even chalked up a new first in
her already sterling swimming
career. She finished third in the
100 breast, less than one second
behind teammate and first
place finisher Mary Ellen Blan
chard. Sounds only mediocre in
Thompson's list of achieve
ments, but the fact that she had
not competed in the breast
stroke in years adds to the sig
nificance of the accomplish
ment.
Stanford freshman Sarah
Anderson smoked the field in
the 500 free, whipping the sec
ond-place finisher by over four
seconds. Sophomore Jessica
Tong sunk her opponents in the
50 free with a time of :24.22,
and finished only .05 second
behind Cal's first-place finisher
in the 200 I.M.
These swimmers won't be on
Stanford Stadium's grass Satur
day afternoon, but you can bet
that they have already done
their part in mauling the Bears
this week.
