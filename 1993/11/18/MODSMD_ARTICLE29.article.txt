# Instinctive paths revisited By Cheo F. Ooker A Tribe Called Quest
## 
### 
By no means is
the presence of jazz
music new to the

hip-hop essence of A
Tribe Called Quest.
Back in the late '80s they

became one of the first
groups to actively push jazz
rhythms to the forefront of their
music.

"Luck Of Lucien" and "Youthful
Expression," two wondrous excursions,

along their album "People's Instinctive
Travels and The Paths of Rhythm," blazed new
trails for the genre, in the same way that bop pi
oneers Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Thelo
nius Monk, etc redefined jazz with small com
bos and improvisations built on the chordal
structures of pop melodies like "I Got Rhythm"
and "How High the Moon."
Knuckleheads and ruffnecks unmoved by
the subtleties of the first album simply could not
resist the hard-core funk of their second effort,
"The Low End Theory." The album proved,
once and for all, that jazz didn't have to come off
like dinner music The upright bass was re-es
tablished as a tool of revolution, an envelope —
much like rap music today—to convey the feel
ings and concerns of a people from one planta
tion to another (i.e. from "Illtown," N.J., to
"Oaktown," Calif.).
The head-knockin' thump of "Excursions,"
the fancy, free flowing verbal kinetics of "Verses
from the Abstract" and the somber, downright
hypnotic aura surrounding "Vibes and Stuff"
caused a renaissance period for the older art
form. Hip-hop kids not only rediscovered Bob
James, but also got their fingers dusty thumbing
through records by Freddie Hubbard, Grant
Green and Lou Donaldson.
Long before myriad gases combined to form
a Planet dubbed "Digable" by the masses, A
Tribe Called Quest was an entire Solar System in
a galaxy called hip-hop. "Midnight Marauders,"
A Tribe Called Quest's third LP, is the "hard
bop" response to Digable — a lyrically smooth,
rhythmically rugged masterpiece of jazz/rap fu
sion that pushes the genre away from the "Cool
Like Dat" mainstream.
But "Marauders" is also one of the most ea
gerly anticipated albums of 1993. After the suc
cesses of their past efforts, the challenge for the
Questers is to make a commercially viable
album that pushes the edge without weirding
out the fans who put them on top in the first
place.
"We just did what we always do," admits Ali
Shaheed Muhammad, the Quester's primary
deejay and producer of the new album. "Our
only focus was toward making a dope album.
We ain't got shit to prove to the public 'cause
what we're doing is natural to us, a formula that
works because it developed years before we even
came out.
"We're not gonna allow each other to come
off wack. If Phife says something I don't like, I'm
gonna say something, or if Tip doesn't like a cer
tain beat or cut of mine, he'll tell me. We're a
group of perfectionists."
"We're not going to bring out anything that
we're not happy with," pipes a newly arrived
Phife, the normally jocular half of Tribe's verbal
component "If it has to be done over nine times
to get it done, we'll do it until all three of us agree
on it.
"What you have to understand," reminds Ali,
"is that going Gold doesn't mean nothing." For
the first time his voice rises above a whisper. "We
treat every project like we're rookies, like we
starvin' and thirsty. This shit is scary. You can't
start acting like, 'Yo, my shit is def? 'cause then

you're
gonna fall

the fuck off" Fhife
silently nods in agreement.

Ali is the pragmatic organizer, or "the foun
dation," Phife is the laid-back, joke-crackin' B
boy and then there's "the top of the pyramid, the
leader," Q-Tip. With his quirky personality, he's
the final leg of any "Quest" for truth.

But once the spotlight is extinguished, the
"Abstract Poetic" becomes mild-mannered, 23-

year-old Jonathan Davis from St. Albans,
Queens.
At one point, Ali refers to him as the group's
perfectionist. "Yep, that would be me," he af
firms in a somber tone." But he continues, "1
haven't perfected my craft yet. I'm far away from
where 1 want to be. I'm not there yet."
1 was dumbfounded when he asked me the
night before, with the sincerity of a new jack,
"Did you like our album? You didn't feel let
down and shit, did you? M
"I get scared," he says, slightly louder than be
fore, "because 1 don't have any control over the
music ... I feel it so much that it just takes me
somewhere else, and I become an instrument. 1
get very afraid of what I put forth through it, be
cause I'm not sure if people will understand the
shit. I myself can only understand it only to a de
gree, so I'm like, 'Damn, if I don't know what's

up,
how can I

expect anybody else

to really understand it?' "

Surely this isn't the same brother who, with
his crew, rocked a Palladium show filled to ca
pacity a week before. Long before their ears were
bombarded by the thunderous midrange of "Oh
My God," and "Lyrics To Go," the crowd had
gone crazy with anticipation, hands thrown in
the air like sinners at a Jimmy Swaggart revival,

waiting to receive the gospel truth.
"Oh yeah, I felt that shit that night," he replies,
his eyes opening up a bit "I feed off all that ener
gy from everybody else and just be zonin' out."
So what does it feel like up in front of all those
people?
"Like sex," he replies in a heartbeat. "Better
than sex. Like playing ball around our way, like
buggfo' out, like a whole bunch of vices. It just
feels real good (Hip-hop) is soul music," he sug
gests assertively, "and soul music can be whatev
er you want it to be. 1 feel (it] is the new soul. It's
real That's all the band and T try to do, is keep it
real What else can you do?"
"You ought to check this record out on a real sys
tem," Muhammad says with a grin as he wheels his
forest-green BMW 325i toward the Holland Tun
neL With "Marauder" bumping from his stereo, it

feels like we're
floating on a
cloud.
But this

plaything suits me
just fine, I reply,
slightly befuddled.
The booming bass

of "8 Million Stories"
lingers just long enough to re-

assure me that the record is more
than jeep-ready. But then "Sucka

Nigga" drops, and the track's horn riffs
damn nearly decapitate me. 1 close my eyes

and settle back in my seat, completely trans
fixed by the sound. Yeaaaaaaah.
"Sucka Niggas," I remember Tip telling me,
"is my noting my addiction to that word. 1 know
that in some contexts, it's very foul, but then
we've taken a word that was given to us out of
foul meaning, flipping it, and using it as a term
of endearment among each other."
Visions of black nigger things dance in my
head: Jazz, The Last Poets ("I love niggers be
cause niggers are me....") hanging out with my
niggas in East Orange, N.J., and comedian Paul
Mooney's album, "Race" ("Nigger-nigga-nigga
nigga-nigger! Makes my teeth white"). "Mid
night" snaps me out of my trance. So many
questions, so little time.
After nine months of listening to this stuff,
doesn't it ever get tiring?
"We don't take tapes home," Ali confides, as
we emerge from the tunnel and onto the crowd
ed streets of "Chilltown" J.C. "We didn't actual
ly take it home until we put it back together for
the album. I took the album home a couple of
days ago, pushed play and was like 'damn, this
shit is deep.'"
I see the whole album in my mind as some
thing akin to driving around after midnight, I
tell Ali. The beats and the rhymes make you feel
like you're in a moving car, and the digitized fe
male voice interludes feel like public-service an
nouncements on the radio. It sticks in your
memory, just like that billboard we passed be
fore going underground.
It occurs to me suddenly that I'm rambling.
Am I over-analyzing things a bit?
He postpones an answer long enough to pull
into the Hoboken Path train station. He clicks
the ignition to "accessories," killing the engine
without snuffing the product of his labor.
"It's always kinda bugged when people ask
questions like 'what did you mean when you did
this here,' " he replies with nonchalance. "Hon
estly, there are certain things that we want for
people to get out of our shit, but at the same
time, it only means whatever it makes you feel. If
it makes you happy, cool. If it makes you want to
jump off a building," he chuckles "then that's
cool too.
"That's what art is. And that's how it's sup
posed to be. I hate when people make you sit
down and break your shit down song for song,
sometimes word for word. I'm like 'Chill, man!'
It's whatever the fuck you want it to be."
Shutting my tape recorder ofl", my "quest"
comes to an end. After all, too many questions
can mess up a good thing. Sometimes a phe
nomena's complexity evades even the broadest
definitions. A Tribe Called Quest is, without a
doubt, one of those things. ■
A Tribe Called Quest will appear along with De La
Soul fur fHt> Bay .Area performance*—on Nov. 26

structures of pop melodies like "I Got Rhythm"
and "How High the Moon."
Knuckleheads and ruffnecks unmoved by
the subtleties of the first album simply could not
resist the hard-core funk of their second effort,
"The Low End Theory." The album proved,
once and for all, that jazz didn't have to come off
like dinner music The upright bass was re-es
tablished as a tool of revolution, an envelope —
much like rap music today—to convey the feel
ings and concerns of a people from one planta
tion to another (i.e. from "Illtown," N.J., to
"Oaktown," Calif.).
The head-knockin' thump of "Excursions,"
the fancy, free flowing verbal kinetics of "Verses
from the Abstract" and the somber, downright
hypnotic aura surrounding "Vibes and Stuff"
caused a renaissance period for the older art
form. Hip-hop kids not only rediscovered Bob
James, but also got their fingers dusty thumbing
through records by Freddie Hubbard, Grant
Green and Lou Donaldson.
Long before myriad gases combined to form
a Planet dubbed "Digable" by the masses, A
Tribe Called Quest was an entire Solar System in
a galaxy called hip-hop. "Midnight Marauders,"
A Tribe Called Quest's third LP, is the "hard
bop" response to Digable — a lyrically smooth,
rhythmically rugged masterpiece of jazz/rap fu
sion that pushes the genre away from the "Cool
Like Dat" mainstream.
But "Marauders" is also one of the most ea
gerly anticipated albums of 1993. After the suc
cesses of their past efforts, the challenge for the
Questers is to make a commercially viable
album that pushes the edge without weirding
out the fans who put them on top in the first
place.
"We just did what we always do," admits Ali
Shaheed Muhammad, the Quester's primary
deejay and producer of the new album. "Our
only focus was toward making a dope album.
We ain't got shit to prove to the public 'cause
what we're doing is natural to us, a formula that
works because it developed years before we even
came out.
"We're not gonna allow each other to come
off wack. If Phife says something I don't like, I'm
gonna say something, or if Tip doesn't like a cer
tain beat or cut of mine, he'll tell me. We're a
group of perfectionists."
"We're not going to bring out anything that
we're not happy with," pipes a newly arrived
Phife, the normally jocular half of Tribe's verbal
component "If it has to be done over nine times
to get it done, we'll do it until all three of us agree
on it.
"What you have to understand," reminds Ali,
"is that going Gold doesn't mean nothing." For
the first time his voice rises above a whisper. "We
treat every project like we're rookies, like we
starvin' and thirsty. This shit is scary. You can't
start acting like, 'Yo, my shit is def? 'cause then

you're
gonna fall

the fuck off" Fhife
silently nods in agreement.

Ali is the pragmatic organizer, or "the foun
dation," Phife is the laid-back, joke-crackin' B
boy and then there's "the top of the pyramid, the
leader," Q-Tip. With his quirky personality, he's
the final leg of any "Quest" for truth.

But once the spotlight is extinguished, the
"Abstract Poetic" becomes mild-mannered, 23-

year-old Jonathan Davis from St. Albans,
Queens.
At one point, Ali refers to him as the group's
perfectionist. "Yep, that would be me," he af
firms in a somber tone." But he continues, "1
haven't perfected my craft yet. I'm far away from
where 1 want to be. I'm not there yet."
1 was dumbfounded when he asked me the
night before, with the sincerity of a new jack,
"Did you like our album? You didn't feel let
down and shit, did you? M
"I get scared," he says, slightly louder than be
fore, "because 1 don't have any control over the
music ... I feel it so much that it just takes me
somewhere else, and I become an instrument. 1
get very afraid of what I put forth through it, be
cause I'm not sure if people will understand the
shit. I myself can only understand it only to a de
gree, so I'm like, 'Damn, if I don't know what's

up,
how can I

expect anybody else

to really understand it?' "

Surely this isn't the same brother who, with
his crew, rocked a Palladium show filled to ca
pacity a week before. Long before their ears were
bombarded by the thunderous midrange of "Oh
My God," and "Lyrics To Go," the crowd had
gone crazy with anticipation, hands thrown in
the air like sinners at a Jimmy Swaggart revival,

waiting to receive the gospel truth.
"Oh yeah, I felt that shit that night," he replies,
his eyes opening up a bit "I feed off all that ener
gy from everybody else and just be zonin' out."
So what does it feel like up in front of all those
people?
"Like sex," he replies in a heartbeat. "Better
than sex. Like playing ball around our way, like
buggfo' out, like a whole bunch of vices. It just
feels real good (Hip-hop) is soul music," he sug
gests assertively, "and soul music can be whatev
er you want it to be. 1 feel (it] is the new soul. It's
real That's all the band and T try to do, is keep it
real What else can you do?"
"You ought to check this record out on a real sys
tem," Muhammad says with a grin as he wheels his
forest-green BMW 325i toward the Holland Tun
neL With "Marauder" bumping from his stereo, it

feels like we're
floating on a
cloud.
But this

plaything suits me
just fine, I reply,
slightly befuddled.
The booming bass

of "8 Million Stories"
lingers just long enough to re-

assure me that the record is more
than jeep-ready. But then "Sucka

Nigga" drops, and the track's horn riffs
damn nearly decapitate me. 1 close my eyes

and settle back in my seat, completely trans
fixed by the sound. Yeaaaaaaah.
"Sucka Niggas," I remember Tip telling me,
"is my noting my addiction to that word. 1 know
that in some contexts, it's very foul, but then
we've taken a word that was given to us out of
foul meaning, flipping it, and using it as a term
of endearment among each other."
Visions of black nigger things dance in my
head: Jazz, The Last Poets ("I love niggers be
cause niggers are me....") hanging out with my
niggas in East Orange, N.J., and comedian Paul
Mooney's album, "Race" ("Nigger-nigga-nigga
nigga-nigger! Makes my teeth white"). "Mid
night" snaps me out of my trance. So many
questions, so little time.
After nine months of listening to this stuff,
doesn't it ever get tiring?
"We don't take tapes home," Ali confides, as
we emerge from the tunnel and onto the crowd
ed streets of "Chilltown" J.C. "We didn't actual
ly take it home until we put it back together for
the album. I took the album home a couple of
days ago, pushed play and was like 'damn, this
shit is deep.'"
I see the whole album in my mind as some
thing akin to driving around after midnight, I
tell Ali. The beats and the rhymes make you feel
like you're in a moving car, and the digitized fe
male voice interludes feel like public-service an
nouncements on the radio. It sticks in your
memory, just like that billboard we passed be
fore going underground.
It occurs to me suddenly that I'm rambling.
Am I over-analyzing things a bit?
He postpones an answer long enough to pull
into the Hoboken Path train station. He clicks
the ignition to "accessories," killing the engine
without snuffing the product of his labor.
"It's always kinda bugged when people ask
questions like 'what did you mean when you did
this here,' " he replies with nonchalance. "Hon
estly, there are certain things that we want for
people to get out of our shit, but at the same
time, it only means whatever it makes you feel. If
it makes you happy, cool. If it makes you want to
jump off a building," he chuckles "then that's
cool too.
"That's what art is. And that's how it's sup
posed to be. I hate when people make you sit
down and break your shit down song for song,
sometimes word for word. I'm like 'Chill, man!'
It's whatever the fuck you want it to be."
Shutting my tape recorder ofl", my "quest"
comes to an end. After all, too many questions
can mess up a good thing. Sometimes a phe
nomena's complexity evades even the broadest
definitions. A Tribe Called Quest is, without a
doubt, one of those things. ■

The head-knockin' thump of "Excursions,"
the fancy, free flowing verbal kinetics of "Verses
from the Abstract" and the somber, downright
hypnotic aura surrounding "Vibes and Stuff"
caused a renaissance period for the older art
form. Hip-hop kids not only rediscovered Bob
James, but also got their fingers dusty thumbing
through records by Freddie Hubbard, Grant
Green and Lou Donaldson.
Long before myriad gases combined to form
a Planet dubbed "Digable" by the masses, A
Tribe Called Quest was an entire Solar System in
a galaxy called hip-hop. "Midnight Marauders,"
A Tribe Called Quest's third LP, is the "hard
bop" response to Digable — a lyrically smooth,
rhythmically rugged masterpiece of jazz/rap fu
sion that pushes the genre away from the "Cool
Like Dat" mainstream.
But "Marauders" is also one of the most ea
gerly anticipated albums of 1993. After the suc
cesses of their past efforts, the challenge for the
Questers is to make a commercially viable
album that pushes the edge without weirding
out the fans who put them on top in the first
place.
"We just did what we always do," admits Ali
Shaheed Muhammad, the Quester's primary
deejay and producer of the new album. "Our
only focus was toward making a dope album.
We ain't got shit to prove to the public 'cause
what we're doing is natural to us, a formula that
works because it developed years before we even
came out.
"We're not gonna allow each other to come
off wack. If Phife says something I don't like, I'm
gonna say something, or if Tip doesn't like a cer
tain beat or cut of mine, he'll tell me. We're a
group of perfectionists."
"We're not going to bring out anything that
we're not happy with," pipes a newly arrived
Phife, the normally jocular half of Tribe's verbal
component "If it has to be done over nine times
to get it done, we'll do it until all three of us agree
on it.
"What you have to understand," reminds Ali,
"is that going Gold doesn't mean nothing." For
the first time his voice rises above a whisper. "We
treat every project like we're rookies, like we
starvin' and thirsty. This shit is scary. You can't
start acting like, 'Yo, my shit is def? 'cause then

you're
gonna fall

the fuck off" Fhife
silently nods in agreement.

Ali is the pragmatic organizer, or "the foun
dation," Phife is the laid-back, joke-crackin' B
boy and then there's "the top of the pyramid, the
leader," Q-Tip. With his quirky personality, he's
the final leg of any "Quest" for truth.

But once the spotlight is extinguished, the
"Abstract Poetic" becomes mild-mannered, 23-

year-old Jonathan Davis from St. Albans,
Queens.
At one point, Ali refers to him as the group's
perfectionist. "Yep, that would be me," he af
firms in a somber tone." But he continues, "1
haven't perfected my craft yet. I'm far away from
where 1 want to be. I'm not there yet."
1 was dumbfounded when he asked me the
night before, with the sincerity of a new jack,
"Did you like our album? You didn't feel let
down and shit, did you? M
"I get scared," he says, slightly louder than be
fore, "because 1 don't have any control over the
music ... I feel it so much that it just takes me
somewhere else, and I become an instrument. 1
get very afraid of what I put forth through it, be
cause I'm not sure if people will understand the
shit. I myself can only understand it only to a de
gree, so I'm like, 'Damn, if I don't know what's

up,
how can I

expect anybody else

to really understand it?' "

Surely this isn't the same brother who, with
his crew, rocked a Palladium show filled to ca
pacity a week before. Long before their ears were
bombarded by the thunderous midrange of "Oh
My God," and "Lyrics To Go," the crowd had
gone crazy with anticipation, hands thrown in
the air like sinners at a Jimmy Swaggart revival,

waiting to receive the gospel truth.
"Oh yeah, I felt that shit that night," he replies,
his eyes opening up a bit "I feed off all that ener
gy from everybody else and just be zonin' out."
So what does it feel like up in front of all those
people?
"Like sex," he replies in a heartbeat. "Better
than sex. Like playing ball around our way, like
buggfo' out, like a whole bunch of vices. It just
feels real good (Hip-hop) is soul music," he sug
gests assertively, "and soul music can be whatev
er you want it to be. 1 feel (it] is the new soul. It's
real That's all the band and T try to do, is keep it
real What else can you do?"
"You ought to check this record out on a real sys
tem," Muhammad says with a grin as he wheels his
forest-green BMW 325i toward the Holland Tun
neL With "Marauder" bumping from his stereo, it

feels like we're
floating on a
cloud.
But this

plaything suits me
just fine, I reply,
slightly befuddled.
The booming bass

of "8 Million Stories"
lingers just long enough to re-

assure me that the record is more
than jeep-ready. But then "Sucka

Nigga" drops, and the track's horn riffs
damn nearly decapitate me. 1 close my eyes

and settle back in my seat, completely trans
fixed by the sound. Yeaaaaaaah.
"Sucka Niggas," I remember Tip telling me,
"is my noting my addiction to that word. 1 know
that in some contexts, it's very foul, but then
we've taken a word that was given to us out of
foul meaning, flipping it, and using it as a term
of endearment among each other."
Visions of black nigger things dance in my
head: Jazz, The Last Poets ("I love niggers be
cause niggers are me....") hanging out with my
niggas in East Orange, N.J., and comedian Paul
Mooney's album, "Race" ("Nigger-nigga-nigga
nigga-nigger! Makes my teeth white"). "Mid
night" snaps me out of my trance. So many
questions, so little time.
After nine months of listening to this stuff,
doesn't it ever get tiring?
"We don't take tapes home," Ali confides, as
we emerge from the tunnel and onto the crowd
ed streets of "Chilltown" J.C. "We didn't actual
ly take it home until we put it back together for
the album. I took the album home a couple of
days ago, pushed play and was like 'damn, this
shit is deep.'"
I see the whole album in my mind as some
thing akin to driving around after midnight, I
tell Ali. The beats and the rhymes make you feel
like you're in a moving car, and the digitized fe
male voice interludes feel like public-service an
nouncements on the radio. It sticks in your
memory, just like that billboard we passed be
fore going underground.
It occurs to me suddenly that I'm rambling.
Am I over-analyzing things a bit?
He postpones an answer long enough to pull
into the Hoboken Path train station. He clicks
the ignition to "accessories," killing the engine
without snuffing the product of his labor.
"It's always kinda bugged when people ask
questions like 'what did you mean when you did
this here,' " he replies with nonchalance. "Hon
estly, there are certain things that we want for
people to get out of our shit, but at the same
time, it only means whatever it makes you feel. If
it makes you happy, cool. If it makes you want to
jump off a building," he chuckles "then that's
cool too.
"That's what art is. And that's how it's sup
posed to be. I hate when people make you sit
down and break your shit down song for song,
sometimes word for word. I'm like 'Chill, man!'
It's whatever the fuck you want it to be."
Shutting my tape recorder ofl", my "quest"
comes to an end. After all, too many questions
can mess up a good thing. Sometimes a phe
nomena's complexity evades even the broadest
definitions. A Tribe Called Quest is, without a
doubt, one of those things. ■

By no means is
the presence of jazz
music new to the

hip-hop essence of A
Tribe Called Quest.
Back in the late '80s they

became one of the first
groups to actively push jazz
rhythms to the forefront of their
music.

"Luck Of Lucien" and "Youthful
Expression," two wondrous excursions,

along their album "People's Instinctive
Travels and The Paths of Rhythm," blazed new
trails for the genre, in the same way that bop pi
oneers Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Thelo
nius Monk, etc redefined jazz with small com
bos and improvisations built on the chordal
structures of pop melodies like "I Got Rhythm"
and "How High the Moon."
Knuckleheads and ruffnecks unmoved by
the subtleties of the first album simply could not
resist the hard-core funk of their second effort,
"The Low End Theory." The album proved,
once and for all, that jazz didn't have to come off
like dinner music The upright bass was re-es
tablished as a tool of revolution, an envelope —
much like rap music today—to convey the feel
ings and concerns of a people from one planta
tion to another (i.e. from "Illtown," N.J., to
"Oaktown," Calif.).
The head-knockin' thump of "Excursions,"
the fancy, free flowing verbal kinetics of "Verses
from the Abstract" and the somber, downright
hypnotic aura surrounding "Vibes and Stuff"

form. Hip-hop kids not only rediscovered Bob
