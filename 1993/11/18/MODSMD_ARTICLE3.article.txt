# Experts: NAFTA win boosts Clinton, U.S.
## 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
While the sentiment was by no means
unanimous, Stanford faculty and students
expressed happiness over yesterday's 234-
200 House vote to approve the North Amer
ican Free Trade Agreement.
Economics Prof. John Taylor said
NAFTA "will be good for economic growth
and for living standards in the U.S. The
main effect is going to be to raise income
and wages in the long run."
"I was pleased for the president," said
Political Science Prof. Luis Fraga, although
he said the deal is "far from a panacea."
Fraga added that provisions need to be
made for economic development in Mexico
as well as job re-training in the United
States.
However, junior Mike Brylawski, co
coordinator of the Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford, called NAFTA
"a very short-sighted plan."
"In essence it seems more like a corpo
rate bill of rights," Brylawski said. "It will
bring exploitation of both American and
Mexican workers."
The 34-vote margin, much wider than
expected, sent NAFTA to the Senate, where
approval is almost assured. The House vie-
Tory was interpreted as a major
triumph for President Clinton,
who campaigned vigorously dur
ing the last few weeks for the
agreement.
Senior Samantha Halem,
chair of the Stanford Democrats,
said, "NAFTA means that the
president will have more credi
bility. That's the most important
thing right now for a president
who got only 43 percent of the
vote."
Food Research Prof. Clark
Reynolds agreed, saying, "Com
ing back late and coming with
the full-court press showed
[Clinton] can win" a polit
ical battle.
Reynolds added that the
president's international image
will be greatly enhanced by the
victory, while the impact at
home will be more mixed. He
said labor and environmental
groups will be upset with the
president.
Fraga added that the presi
dent's victory with NAFTA will
not help with other important
upcoming votes. "He'll have to

put together coalitions on each of
those," he said.
But Political Science Prof.
Judith Goldstein said a loss on
NAFTA "would have been devas
tating for what he wants to push
next, which is health care."
NAFTA's impact on unem
ployment was the focus of
most of the NAFTA debate,
and Stanford experts contin
ued to talk about jobs after the
vote.
Most agreed that short-term
job losses will have to be
absorbed in order to reap long
term economic benefits.
Goldstein acknowledged that
jobs will be lost, but added,
"We're losing jobs anyway.
"It's far better than the sta
tus quo," she continued, "but
it's not that we couldn't have
negotiated a better deal. It will
help our export market, [and]
it's going to be a big invest
ment boost for the United
States."
agreed, saying,
"There'll be dislocations in the
short term. A lot of it depends on
how the U.S. decides to meet the
challenge."
Taylor, however, disagreed. "I
don't think there will be any
short-term [job loss]," he said.

"Some industries are going to
benefit more than others,
though."
While Ross Perot and other
opponents of the agreement have
accused the administration of
buying votes, Stanford experts
said there was nothing unusual
about the political techniques
Clinton used to build his pro-
NAFTA coalition.
"That's good old-fashioned
American politics," said Fraga.
"It's not anything surprising, it's
not anything new."
Goldstein said the conces
sions made by Clinton were
"not unusual," saying the same
types of deals have been made
on every trade agreement that
has passed Congress since
1962.
Environmental issues were a
point of contention in the
NAFTA debate.
While Brylawski said envi
ronmental side agreements
Clinton supported are going to
make the environmental situa
tion worse in both the United
States and Mexico, Reynolds
disagreed.
"You can't lever with Mexico
on the environment unless you
have leverage," Reynolds ex
plained.

But Political Science Prof.
Judith Goldstein said a loss on
NAFTA "would have been devas
tating for what he wants to push
next, which is health care."
NAFTA's impact on unem
ployment was the focus of
most of the NAFTA debate,
and Stanford experts contin
ued to talk about jobs after the
vote.
Most agreed that short-term
job losses will have to be
absorbed in order to reap long
term economic benefits.
Goldstein acknowledged that
jobs will be lost, but added,
"We're losing jobs anyway.
"It's far better than the sta
tus quo," she continued, "but
it's not that we couldn't have
negotiated a better deal. It will
help our export market, [and]
it's going to be a big invest
ment boost for the United
States."
agreed, saying,
"There'll be dislocations in the
short term. A lot of it depends on
how the U.S. decides to meet the
challenge."
Taylor, however, disagreed. "I
don't think there will be any
short-term [job loss]," he said.

"Some industries are going to
benefit more than others,
though."
While Ross Perot and other
opponents of the agreement have
accused the administration of
buying votes, Stanford experts
said there was nothing unusual
about the political techniques
Clinton used to build his pro-
NAFTA coalition.
"That's good old-fashioned
American politics," said Fraga.
"It's not anything surprising, it's
not anything new."
Goldstein said the conces
sions made by Clinton were
"not unusual," saying the same
types of deals have been made
on every trade agreement that
has passed Congress since
1962.
Environmental issues were a
point of contention in the
NAFTA debate.
While Brylawski said envi
ronmental side agreements
Clinton supported are going to
make the environmental situa
tion worse in both the United
States and Mexico, Reynolds
disagreed.
"You can't lever with Mexico
on the environment unless you
have leverage," Reynolds ex
plained.
