# Don't tell him how to play the blues
## Branford Marsalis 
### Kyle Graham 
It's hard to imagine Branford Marsalis hating
anyone. In his years as a premier jazz musi
cian, actor and more recently "Tonight
Show" bandleader, Marsalis has earned a rep
utation as one of the nicest men in show busi
ness. But a small group of people have earned
the saxophonist's everlasting enmity.
"(Being a) music critic is one of the most
meaningless jobs in the world. I guess they were
like, '1 want to be a rocket scientist.' '1 want to be
an astronaut.' 'I want to be a music critic.'
"It's one of those gigs that you get as a last
resort. No one ever grows up wanting to be a
critic. As all the other windows of opportuni
ty close, it becomes available to you, so you

take it. (They)
come to New
York, try to play,
realize the only
place they're
going to play is in
their garage, and
then be-

come a critic.
"And then, you know, they start to judge
other people's merits. Almost all the jazz critics
I know are musicians. Former musicians, cur
rent musicians, and would sell their right arm
to be in a band and make a record."
However, critics do not necessarily recipro
cate Marsalis' distaste. In fact, ever since his 1984
debut "Scenes in the City," Marsalis has been
hailed as a member of the vanguard of young
jazz musicians who are taking the art to new lev
els of excellence while paying homage to the bop
and hard bop pioneers of the 1940s and '50s.
Maybe it's in the genes. Most of the public
has heard of Branford's younger brother Wyn
ton, but the Marsalis clan's jazz roots extend far
deeper into the soul of New Orleans. Bran
ford's father, Ellis, was and still remains a jazz
legend in the Big Easy. Ellis instructed the
Marsalis children, teaching them the value of
classical technique and the importance of envi
ronmental influences on music. Then Bran
ford began his stint at the New Orleans Center
for the Performing Arts and Southern Univer
sity, refining and experimenting with his

sound on the alto sax along the way.
In 1980, he joined Art Blakey's Jazz
Messengers, the premier stomping
grounds for jazz musicians such as
Marsalis' brother Wynton, Freddie Hub
bard and Clifford Brown. After his tenure
with Blakey, Bran ford joined Wynton's
first ensemble and played tenor sax (for
the first time) on the 1981 debut album
"Wynton Marsalis."
Marsalis remembers his years with
the Jazz Messengers and Wynton's band
fondly. "Art Blakey was a lot different than
Wynton is. Art Blakey was a wild man. Each
night was an adventure, musically, and in
every other sense of the word,
k "With Wynton's band, we had a lot of
I youthful exuberance, and we spent a lot
■ of time trying to push music past a cer

tain limit. Pushing the envelope. We had a lot
of fun doing that There was a certain kind
of camaraderie. It was like that in Blakey's
hand, as well, but it was just different, because
we were playing Art's music, or the type of
music Art liked to play. But when we were with
Wynton, we were wild."
In the last decade, the saxophonist has col
laborated with pop artists such as Sting and
Shanice on their albums, bold moves that have
been regarded as just short of blasphemy by
many in the jazz community. Nevertheless,
Marsalis believes that labels such as "jazz" and
"pop" are less significant than the artist's skill
and intent in judging music's worth.
"It comes back to the same thing — you
have those people who spend a lot of time
working on their craft, researching the music,
and they have the ability to make melody."
Yet Marsalis is not sparing in his criticism of
those pop artists whom he considers to have
settled for mediocrity, nor of their fans.
"People like pop music for a different rea
son. They don't seem to care if the music
sounds good. They don't seem to give a damn
about that. Pop music is based on familiarity or
a warped American equality. It's like, when you
talk to most Americans, when you talk to our
people, and you talk to them about their lives,
academics, athletics or beauty, we have rede
fined the preamble to the Constitution so that
'All men are created equal' no longer applies to
the quality of the human spirit. It deals with
physical reality.
"And a lot of pop groups that seem to be
successful are pop groups where the guys who
play the instruments are those guys who play
one degree better than the people who buy the
records."
Furthermore, he is quick to note that there
are many jazz artists who fail to realize the in
trospective importance of their music.
"There are a lot of jazz musicians who don't
even realize that. They talk about the music
being in the present tense, but they learn music
just like people learn anything else. In school,
they go back and memorize a lot of licks, and
then they come in the gig and play the stuff
they learned the night before," he states.
Nor does Marsalis view mere technical pre
cision as a measure of grandeur; true jazz artists
must have an intrinsic, ineffable bond with
their music. "There are three types of writers:
there are bad writers, and there are good writ
ers and then there are beautiful writers," he says.
"If you take someone who knows far less and if
he has the ability or she has the ability, what he
or she writes will have far more impact than
someone with a much larger vocabulary."
While words such as these have a great im
pact upon the jazz community, until two years

ago few others would have recognized the
speaker's identity. But all that changed when
Marsalis was asked by Jay Leno to be his band
leader and cohort on the "Tonight Show."
The selection of Marsalis surprised many,
who felt that audiences would not appreciate
the jazz artist's intricate, articulate music in an
age when late-night bands most frequently
play pop-dominated repertoires. However,
Marsalis and his all-star band have earned
rave reviews for the eclectic, intriguing licks
which they present in the short time afforded.
Eighteen months after his debut, Marsalis
states that he is still having a good time in his
"Tonight Show" role. However, he also admits
that he does not have the free hand he would like.
"I knew it was going to be a restrictive gig
musically. It's the nature of the beast. If jazz was
that popular, then they'd have jazz bands,
they'd have a jazz show and it would be (high
ly) rated. We knew what we were getting our
selves into. It's a business, and the company's in
the business to make money and we have to
play the music that they feel will give them the
most opportunities to sell their products.
When asked why he chose to accept a job he
knew would possess such inherent limits,
Marsalis adds, "Because I was tired of the road,
and it was something I'd never done. I have this
thing about doing things I've never done, and
it was cute working on a TV show. We can
sneak a few tunes in here and there, and give
exposure to a few musicians who wouldn't
necessarily be given the chance to be exposed,
and it worked in the early stages of the game.
"It worked for me, but things are just differ
ent now. I mean, it's a business. It's a corpora
tion. I understand that."
Marsalis has also seen the other corporate
face of the entertainment industry while acting
in movies like Spike Lee's "School Daze."
Regarding the future of an acting career,
Marsalis states, "Anything's a possibility.
There's infinite possibilities. I mean if some
body were to come to me and offer me a role in
something I liked, I'd do it if I thought I could
do it. But nobody offers me anything anymore.
"But I'm having a good time. I have a lot of
work to do. 1 have a lot of records to work on, a
lot of music to work on."
Did Marsalis predict that he'd be an inter
nationally famous entertainer 15 years ago,
when he was performing in the Southern Uni
versity marching band? "Hell, no. I said that (1
didn't) in 1984 and 1985 when they asked me,
'What are your future plans?' Who the hell
knows? That's one of the things I enjoy about
my life. That's one of the few things I enjoy
about my life. I don't know."
However, there is at least one other thing —
something about Stanford, in fact — that
Marsalis appreciates. "I did enjoy Stanford's
Band at USC (two weeks ago). They were ...
hilarious." ■
