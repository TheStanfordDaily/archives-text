Fresh-faced. Radiant. Beautiful. Ordinary.
Feisty. Reflective. Cute. Southern belle. Fem
inist. Ingenue. You can call Ashley |udd any
of these things. What she wants you to know
is that she is a strong woman. Period.
Everyone loves Ashley. The directors she's
worked with, the critics who have reviewed
her films and the studios who are now falling
all over themselves to sign her name on the
dotted line â€” they all sing her praises. Cam
eras love her most of all because she's a nat
ural.
We journalists aren't immune either. A
San Francisco Chronicle interviewer fawned
over her so much that another paper
ridiculed him for it. So caveat lector. This is
not an objective story. This is my list of rea
sons why I love Ashley Judd.
Read at your own peril.
