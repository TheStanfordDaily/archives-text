# She doesn't take Any crap. So Step correctly, or don't Step At all.

1 show up with a photographer to inter
view her at her godmother's house in Pacific
Heights. There's no entourage of publicists,
handlers, make-up artists or hairstylists —
just Ashley and her godmother Piper Evans, a
San Francisco socialite. It's the perfect oppor
tunity for an honest, uncoached interview.
The first words out of her mouth are,
"You're out of luck." Visions of my torture at
the hands of my editors flash before my eyes
until she tells me that she's just referring to
the photographer. "I'm not allowing any pic
tures," she says with a slight Southern drawl.
"I don't know what the publicist told you, but
he made a mistake." Her tone is completely
without rancor, but it's already clear who's in
control.
We move to the living room of Piper's spa
cious but cozy brownstone. Ashley sits down
in a sofa and pulls her feet to her body, almost
in a relaxed fetal position. According to
Celebrity Interview 101, you should warm up
the subject with easy questions.
How did Ashley decide to become an ac
tress?
"Do you think that this is a standard ques
tion?" she says evenly. "Or do you ask this
particularly because your paper is read by a
lot of young people?"
Ouch. Back to the drawing board.
I assure her that there will be questions
specific to the movie. Somewhat mollified,
she responds, "It picked me, I didn't pick it. It
was something that I knew, and for quite a
while, I suppressed it I wasn't denying my
self, it was simply that I felt it necessary to

pursue an education and the well-rounded
life of a healthy young person. And when it
came time for me to actually begin a vocation
upon completing school, 1 had plans to go in
the Peace Corps. But finally my spirit re
belled."
Whew.
