# She's very confident about her abilities

Before making her feature film debut in
"Ruby in Paradise," Ashley worked in series
television, with recurring roles on "Sisters"
and "Star Trek: The Next Generation."
"It gave me confidence. I had a knack for
hitting a mark on an unmarked floor. Mean
ing, if we're filming something in a ballroom,
there can't be a piece of orange tape on the
parquet to indicate where I need to stop in
order to be lit so that the performance shows
up on film. That is somehow or another
something one innately senses."
Ashley's sixth sense also extends to her se
lection of material. She desperately wanted
the lead role in "Ruby in Paradise," not be
cause she thought it would become a block
buster, but because its mythic quality
touched something within her.
"I wish that I could say I responded with
all of my keen literary observations about the
script. But it was a strictly emotional gut en
counter. My passion was based on an unar
ticulable emotional relationship with the
material."
She's starting to warm up. 1 hope.
