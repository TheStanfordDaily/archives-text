Ashley's about to explain how she went
after the part when the phone rings; it's her
father. Her Malibu house burned down in the
recent fires, but you would never be able to
tell from their jovial conversation. "He's al
ready talking to the independent adjuster
who's going out to the house," she says upon
hanging up, "which is pretty neat. As you can
tell, I'm rather weary, and it would be hard
for me to do it by myself"
Fortunately, everyone she knows and loves
in Malibu is safe. "Not only are they okay,
they emerged with valor. My neighbors,
while evacuating with two infants, busted
down my front door and saved one of my
cats."
For a moment, Ashley seems lost in the
memories of her feline friend. She lowers her
voice to a whisper and leans forward. "I can't

wait to see her."
Then she sits back and perks up. "My
friend who has her said, 'Well what does she
eat?' And I said, 'Honey, she can eat whatever
she wants. You can take her to a sushi bar,
bless her little heart.' "
