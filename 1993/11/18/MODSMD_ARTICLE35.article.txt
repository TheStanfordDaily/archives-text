Ruby, the character Ashley plays in "Ruby
in Paradise," leaves Tennessee for a small
town in Florida. On the way there, she rejoic
es over the fact that she escaped Tennessee
"without getting pregnant or beat up." The
line rings true in the film, but it could also be
director Victor Nunez' stereotype of the lives
of Southern women.
Ashley doesn't agree. "This is my 16th city
talking about 'Ruby,' and it is only in San
Francisco that I have been asked if that line
were perhaps a stereotype. And it was by you
and another college student.
"I wonder if we're slightly uninformed.
That as young people, we assume it's a stereo
type, when in reality, older people simply
know that in any community to a certain ex
tent — not just relegated to the South — that
is unfortunately the defining parameter of a
woman's existence. Ultimately the defining
parameter."
She pauses to reflect on what she's just
said. "I have to preface any further answer by
saying I don't pontificate and I dislike it when
actors do. So many actors are like a dinner
party guest at 3 a.m. after too much red wine.
They like the sound of their own voice. And I
don't have a problem saying 'I don't know' or
'1 don't have an answer.' "
Ashley looks at me impishly. "I'll even say
'I don't care.' So if 1 launch into some tirade,
1 don't propose that it's complete. Know what
I mean?"
Gotcha.
