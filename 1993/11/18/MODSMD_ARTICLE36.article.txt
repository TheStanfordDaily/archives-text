# She's s tired of so-called 'sensitive guys.'

Ruby seems to settle down with Mike Mc-
Caslin (Todd Field) for a while, but she ends
up dumping him, saying that "he's too good
to be true." When asked to explain Ruby's ac
tions, Ashley says:
" 'I cannot endure at all times even the
confinement of a beautiful cage' â€” Amelia
Earhart, on the day she got married. How's
that for an answer?"
Still, many critics disagree. Some have said
that when Ruby rejects her seemingly perfect
boyfriend, it's a metaphor for her deliberate
rejection of happiness. Ashley laughs out

loud at the thought.
"Were they men or women? 1 bet they were
men." She's right, of course. "They had to be
men If Mike, who's seemingly such a
good guy, is rejected, there's no hope for men.
How could they get the rest of the movie and
blindly not see that Mike was wrong for
Ruby."
Josh Charles, who played one of the angst
ridden preppies in "Dead Poets' Society,"
calls Ashley while we're talking. She immedi
ately enlists him to find out which shelter her
cat has been taken to. But Josh has another
reason for calling besides signing up for re
connaissance work. Apparently he just saw
the film, and Ruby's dumping of Mike
tripped him out, so he called her to get the
411.
Ashley happily explains it to him. "Every
body's wrong for Ruby right now. She's still
exploring her identity and she's trying to be
independent. Maybe it would have become
an issue of his being too nice or too aesthetic
or whatever. Maybe it'd become an issue of
him oppressing me. But whatever he was
gonna do, at some point it would be wrong.
Josh isn't buying, so Ashley turns up the
heat. "Men are like, 'Mike was so cool. Why
doesn't she like him?' Isn't that a response of
a '90s politically correct male to be sensitive
to another person's observations and to abdi
cate his stridency in favor of...When Josh
asks her about the film's abrupt ending, she
replies sarcastically, "No, I'm sorry, you're
right. We just didn't have the location for two
more days." But Ashley reassures Josh that
she's only joking before hanging up.
Her godmother's been laughing the whole
time. "Honey, it never occurred to me that
anybody would object to your breaking up.
You didn't want to date him anymore. At least
he didn't shoot you."
Still, Ashley understands Josh's reaction.
"He fancies himself on a very good day as ap
proaching the sensibility and sensitivity of
someone like Mike, so he's worried." Both
women laugh.
