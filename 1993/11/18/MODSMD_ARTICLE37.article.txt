Her reflective performance in "Ruby"
might lead some to typecast her. That is, until
they see her in Oliver Stone's upcoming "Nat
ural Born Killers." Filmed from a savagely
funny script by Quentin Tarantino ("Reser
voir Dogs," "True Romance"), the story cen
ters on Mickey and Mallory Knox, husband
and wife serial killers who become folk he
roes.
Ashley has the small but pivotal role of the
sole survivor of a teenage slumber party that
the Knoxes massacred. She bravely takes the
witness stand to testify against them — only
to face a blistering cross-examination by
Mickey, who's decided to handle his own de
fense.
"Isn't that an awesome scene?" She's excit
ed to find out that I've read the screenplay.
When she finds out that I've also read Taran
tino's latest script, "Pulp Fiction," currently
shooting in L.A., she turns glum for a second.
"I wanted that part. The one at the start, be
fore the credits...."
You mean Honeybunny?
"Yeah. I really wanted that part. He didn't
even meet people, he just gave it to Uma
(Thurman)." As usual, Tarantino cast a
group of talented, offbeat actors — John Tra
volta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis and
Harvey Keitel — whom Ashley would have
loved to work with. "That Honeybunny part
was good, where they go out to eat and she
just talks and talks."
And then Honeybunny and her boyfriend
hold up the restaurant. What about the scene
where two skinny hillbillies rape a burly black
man as the Judds play in the background?
"I have to have a little talk with Quentin.
You want to talk about stereotyper?" She's fired
up now. "A couple of' Deliverance' boys just
plop down in the middle of Los Angeles just
lurking behind storefronts waiting to com
mit sodomy? Now that is a stereotype."
