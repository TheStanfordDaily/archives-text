The media loves to say that it discovered

the next big thing. Unsurprisingly, in its rush
to proclaim Ashley Judd the new Jodie Foster
/ Julia Roberts / Winona Ryder, they have em
phasized her looks over her acting talent.
Ashley doesn't believe her own hype,
though. "Publications like Cosmopolitan
choose to accentuate the way I look and my
sexuality, saying 'Live, and she's no virgin.' A
piece of trash. But I honestly don't believe
what they say."
She seems almost defensive, like a Naomi
Wolf feminist apologizing for her beauty.
"The Los Angeles Times said that people de
clared me this amazing country girl and were
knocked out by my drop-dead looks. But he
was talking about how fashion magazines
have picked up on me.
"And the Mademoiselle thing just hap
pened through a friend a former editor of
Vogue who now does little stories for the new
editorial staff at Mademoiselle. And she said,
'Can we just take some pictures of you out in
the country with your dogs and stuff?' Even
that wasn't glamour-girl beauty. I didn't wear
any make-up."
