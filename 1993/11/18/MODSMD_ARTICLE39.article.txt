"Ruby" is Ashley's breakthrough film, but
if a few breaks had gone her way, she would
have been the hardest-working cowgirl in
Hollywood.
"It was between Nina Ziemasko ("Wild
Orchid II') and me for 'Geronimo.' Both of us
read with Jason Patric. They cast her, she goes
to the set, they write the part out and send her
back home without having worked a day.
"There's the Kevin Jarre movie, 'Tomb
stone.' I'm the studio's first pick. For some
reason he goes with someone older: Dana

Delany. Later, he gets fired. The picture is a
disaster.
"Next, there was 'Bad Girls' — Madeline
Stowe, Drew Barrymore, Mary Stuart Mas
terson, etc. 1 got a part. All of a sudden, Mary
Stuart wants the part I auditioned for, which
is fine. She gets it. Now Andie MacDowell
calls and she wants a part because these other
actresses are in it, so she gets a part. And
eventually there's nothing left for me.
"Three days into shooting, the director
gets fired, the production gets closed down"
She leans forward and whispers, "It's like if
you don't cast me, you are jinxed." Everyone
laughs.
"Doing a little witch dance," Piper chimes
in.
"But like Wynonna says, time after time of
not winning Female Vocalist of the Year just
makes people love her more. Now people at
20th Century Fox on a weekly basis fax to my
agent everything they have in development,
begging me to be interested in some piece of
crap they've got."
