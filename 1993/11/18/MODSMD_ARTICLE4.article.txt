# ASSU reviewing fee-refund system
## Possible measure will make refunds more difficult 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
A bill before the ASSU Senate's Ad
ministration and Rules Committee could
put a new obstacle in the path of students
seeking special-fee refunds.
The bill, submitted by undergraduate
senator Gabe Lucas, would require stu
dents to reapply for fee refunds each
quarter. Currently, refunds requested
during fall and winter quarters carry
through the rest of the year.
"Hopefully, students will reassess the
situation each quarter," said Lucas, who
submitted the bill at the committee's
meeting on Tuesday. "It would encour
age student groups to reach out to stu
dents."
Earlier this quarter, after a group of
graduate students spearheaded a fee-re
fund drive to express their dissatisfac
tion with the ASSU, fee-refund requests

jumped by 71 percent.
"The way it works now, getting a re
fund is so convenient that I think that
sends the wrong message," said Lucas,
who crafted his proposal on the idea that
groups should have the opportunity to
work to change students' opinions from
quarter to quarter.
But committee member Neil Crellin, a
graduate senator, said this bill is an inef
fective solution â€” "a measure which is a
band-aid trying to patch a hemorrhaging
artery."
Crellin argued that the problem
"needs to be solved by sitting down and
trying to find a solution that is mutually
acceptable to both student groups and
the students themselves."
Undergraduate senator Anthony
Westerfield, the committee's chair, said
he hopes the committee will pursue such
a solution.
"We plan to study student feelings

about the refund process," he said. "The
committee wants to restructure the
whole student refund process. . . . We're
going to improve on Senator Lucas'
plan."
Because the refund issue tends to di
vide graduate and undergraduate stu
dents, Westerfield said the committee
"might try to have a joint bill established
with input from grads and undergradu
ates."
"We want to be fair to both student
bodies," he added.
While the committee may propose
sweeping changes to the current process,
this is not the first time in recent years
the senate has considered measures to
reform the special-fee system.
"If you go back four or five years, the
process was very convoluted," said
Crellin. "You had to stand in a long line
