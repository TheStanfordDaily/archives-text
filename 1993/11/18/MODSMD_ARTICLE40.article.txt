Another phone call interrupts the inter
view; Piper tells her that it's a guy that she
met last night at a private screening of her

Ashley forgets about the interview, gossip

wins the prize, man. 10:15. 10:15. That's
early."

"Oh, you mean for calling? Well there's
probably about eight of 'em who are sitting
there going 'I'll be cool. I'll wait 'til noon,' "
Piper laughs.
"Okay, slightly before noon — that's good,
but whoa!" Her Cheshire cat grin doesn't go
away for another 15 minutes.
