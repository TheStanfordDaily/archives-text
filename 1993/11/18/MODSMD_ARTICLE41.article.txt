Explaining how she made it through a dif
ficult play she worked on, Ashley says, "It's
like Brady Anderson, who plays for the Balti
more Orioles â€” sports analogies are very
good for acting.
"In one session of spring training where it
looked like he was going to be farmed out
permanently, he said to his batting coach,
'May I do it my way?' He is now an All-Star.
All because he threw out all of their advice
and just went with what came naturally. He
sent me his press kit to ask me out on a date."
Didn't she say that she hasn't had a date in
four years?
"He also evidently asked out Gabriela
Sabatini, the tennis player, and I wrote him
back, saying 'I find this terribly flattering.
And by the way, for those less easily
amused, you might want to omit the piece
about him soliciting dates from well-built
millionairesses on the pro tennis circuit.
Some people might be intimidated by
that.' "
