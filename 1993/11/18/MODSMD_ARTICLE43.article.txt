## Campion's 'Piano' goes where Disney's 'Beauty' won't 
### 
At the beginning of "The Piano," a mute
Scottish woman named Ada (Holly Hunter)
and her young daughter Flora (Anna Paquin)
are lifted from a boat and carried to the New
Zealand shore by several sailors, followed by

all of their possessions.
They're supposed to meet Stewart (Sam
Neill), a wealthy local landowner Ada's never
met, but who will soon be her new husband.
But he's not there. Ada doesn't worry. She

breaks open the crate that contains her piano
and begins to play, lulling her daughter to
sleep before taking shelter under a tent made
from Adas hoops and underskirts. Silhouet
ted by the backdrop of a gorgeous sunset, these
pristine images are like a rare crystal vase wait
ing to be shattered.
By sunrise, they have been shattered. Stew
art shows up and refuses to take the piano with
them because he doesn't have enough servants
to carry it. He subsequently gives the piano to
his neighbor Baines (Harvey Keitel), a crude
settler gone native, in exchange for a desirable
plot of land, throwing in lessons from Ada for
free. But Baines doesn't want to learn how to
play the piano; he wants the piano player. So
Baines and Ada strike a bargain. One lesson
for every black key, and after all the keys are ex
changed, he will return her piano — as long as
he is allowed to touch her while she plays.
Tale as old as time....
"The Piano" is a masterpiece of gothic ro
mance that most closely resembles "Beauty
and the Beast." Unconstrained by a G rating,
it's free to explore the sexual undertones that
the Disney film only hints at, without carica
turizing Stewart as a Gaston-esque simpleton.
Stewart wants to understand Ada, but his re
pressive Victorian sense of propriety gets in
the way. So he waits patiently for her to come
around, while the passionate Baines captures
her heart. Only the sight of Ada and Baines in
bed as he spies on them spurs him to action —
but by then his only recourse is violence.
Writer-director Jane Campion, whose
debut film "Sweetie" was booed out of
Cannes, returned there triumphantly this
year, becoming the first woman to win the
Grand Prize (shared with Chen Kaige's
"Farewell My Concubine"). And deservedly
so. Every frame of "The Piano" shows her

complete mastery of the medium. She lulls us
in with the beauty of her images, only to suck
er-punch us with their content. As Ada goes to
visit Baines, a jealous Stewart pops out from
behind a tree and chases her through the mist
obscured woods in an attempt to take by force
what he couldn't by what he considers kind
ness — in agonizing slow-motion.
Merchant-Ivory, it's not.
The work of the cast matches the high qual
ity of Campion's material. Keitel — surely no
one's idea of a romantic hero — rises to the oc
casion, baring himself before the camera as he
did in "Bad Lieutenant." Neill shows that his
bland performance in "Jurassic Park" was
purely Spielberg-induced, capturing Stewart's
shift from bewilderment to blind fury. Neither
actor tries to paper over their characters'
rough edges. Instead they use those edges to
find the fundamental humanity within them
selves.
But the truly astonishing performance comes
from Hunter. For an actress who wields words as
weapons — "Broadcast News," "Raising Ari
zona" — she draws on her considerable expres
siveness to portray a character who cannot
speak. Her gestures, the way she writes on paper
and signs with her daughter — all reflect Ada's
mood: slow and graceful when she's happy,
quick and violent when she Isn't. Hunter's word
less performance is at such a high caliber that she
may never have to speak again, except to accept
her Academy Award come March.
The past is prologue. "Orlando," "Age of In
nocence," "Short Cuts," "Remains of the Day"
— all will have to kneel and acknowledge Jane
Campion as Mistress of the Art House. So
don't be put off by the hype surrounding her
newest film, "The Piano." It sings.
