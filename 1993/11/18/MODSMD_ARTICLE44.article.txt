# The 						Three Musketeers
## screens 
### 
Less epic adventure than PG coming-of-age
tale, "The Three Musketeers" shares the same
pseudo-historical sensibility that fueled "Robin
Hood: Prince of Thieves." It also shares a Bryan
Adams theme song and a cast member. Alas,
this teen angsf-ploitation flick makes "Robin
Hood" look like "Masterpiece Theater."
When Disney crosses swords with a liter
ary classic, heads are sure to roll. Only Alexan
dre Dumas' basic premise remains intact:
D'Artagnan (Chris O'Donnell) makes his way
to "Musketeer headquarters" in Paris, only to

find the swashbuck
ling troupe disbanded
by the wicked Cardi
nal Richelieu.
Before you can say
"en garde," D'Artagnan
happens upon Athos,
Porthos and Aramis,
the only Musketeers
still loyal to the crown
(Kiefer Sutherland,
Oliver Piatt and Charlie
Sheen). Together, they
uncover the Cardinal's

plot to unseat feckless King Louis XIII.
The four principals bring lusty enthusiasm
to their task and, thankfully, no phony ac
cents. But their blow-dried good looks can't
compensate for the fact that not one has
enough talent to bring any depth to his role.
Mostly to blame is David Loughery's screen
play, a series of unfunny one-liners punctuated
by gratuitous sex and violence. What little plot
exists is frequently interrupted so our heroes can
show off their fencing skills and indulge in "the
manly art of wenching."
Worth watching is Tim Curry as Richelieu,
holding his own against the whole host of ani
mated Disney villains. One can't help but think
of Cruella De Vil when he screams: "I want
those Musketeers!"
Director Stephen Herek and crew create a vi
brant facsimile of Ye Olde France. Although the
fencing scenes lose some of their vim once we
realize that no one actually bleeds, a few hun
dred barrels of gunpowder go surprisingly far.
It's a gorgeous picture of what might have
been. An opportunity to make a technically
perfect, historically accurate "Musketeers" is
turned into a four-way buddy movie. It's
enough to make one re-read the novel, which
is what the filmmakers should have done.
