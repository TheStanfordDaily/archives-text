# Carlito's Way
## 
### 
As Martin Scorsese leaves New York's mean
streets in search of a more innocent age, any
one daring to challenge his trademark territo
ry of accented machismo and operatic shoot
fests had better come forth well-armed.
Certainly, A 1 Pacino and Brian De Palma
have equipped themselves well; Pacino's great
est moments came with the Corleones, and De
Palma... well, he had to trudge across Harlem
to attend film school at Columbia.
With the duo's first teaming, "Scarface," they
could not be accused of euphemizing the vio
lent reality of 1970s Miami. "Carlito's Way"
thankfully turns out to be a great deal more
than just a "Scarface" reunion.
The film is set in 1975 New York City, at the
height of disco mayhem. Pacino's Carlito
Brigante is an ex-con determined to keep it
that way. His increasingly substance-depen
dent lawyer David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn) is no
help to his cause — save for the single time he
got Carlito released from prison. An old flame
appears, the darkened back-alleys of crime
begin to beckon menacingly once more, and
soon there are some tough choices between
loyalty, love and perhaps life itself.

Granted, the premise is hardly innovative
and the female love interest remains under
developed, but the movie succeeds simply be
cause it accepts the limitations of its genre.
The payoff is plentiful. Penn should receive
an Oscar nomination for his chilling turn as
Kleinfeld. His chemistry with Pacino forms the
fertile ground for De Palma to maneuver his
camera around: the black-and-white-shot se
quence accompanying the opening credits is an
example of the director's technical brilliance.
Assembling virtuoso work from an appar
ently effortless Pacino, David Koepp's skillful
layering of the screenplay's brimming tension
and De Palma's stylish camera angles, "Carli
to's Way" swings, swoops and ultimately soars.
