# A 						'4-track' alternative
## PJ Harvey avoids the mainstream morass 
### 
There it was. Smack-dab amid Tower
Records' "Alternative Picks" was PJ Harvey's
"4-Track Demos." Polly Jean's skinny, un
shaven, black-angora-lingerie-clad self had
been reduced to a one-square-inch CD-case
replica, right next to James' "Laid." The pic
ture seemed bleak.
For artists like Polly Jean Harvey and her
self-titled band, the music business presents a
catch-22. They define themselves by veering
away from the mainstream, but eventually fall
victim to the "U2 syndrome." The price of
success often entails embracing the very
things they tried to avoid — and touting the
"alternative" label all the way, deluding them
selves into thinking they haven't sold out.
So far, the British trio PJ Harvey has avoid
ed the trap, being named "Pop Music Face of
'93" by the Los Angeles Times and USA
Today, but nevertheless remaining part of the
underground — both in sound and spirit.
If PJ Harvey can survive "Pop Music Face
of '93," I figure they can weather their way
through Tower's "Alternative Picks." And "4
Track Demos," the original demo recordings
of the band's latest album "Rid of Me," re
confirms my hopes.
"4-Track Demos" — like "Rid of Me" —
maintains PJ Harvey's satirical, hard-edged
and defiant spirit, as we see Harvey herself
grow into the angst-riddcn yet comical per
sona that her U.S. debut "Dry" conceived.
1 ler emotional utterances evolve into cathar
tic, ear-splitting wails in songs like "Legs"
and "Snake."
As the title indicates, the songs on
"Demos" are recorded as 4-tracks, meaning
that four layers of recorded sound are com
bined to create, in this case, a distinctive re
verberating, raw sound with plenty of amp
feedback.
The paring down of the music to its bare

bones allows us to relish Harvey's throaty,
just-woke-up-in morning-with-a-hangover
voice in all its indomitable sarcasm and spir
it. Despite its roughness, the strength and
gravity of her voice, coupled with her trade
mark short, irregular verses, demands noth
ing less than our undivided attention.
But the real beauty of 1 larvey — and what
has saved her from her own success — is that
she never, ever takes herself too seriously. We
can almost see her wry grin after she belts out
lyrics like, "1 want to bathe in milk / Eat
grapes / Robert DeNiro sit on my face"
("Reeling"), or "You come and measure me /
I'm 20 inches long." ("50 ft. Queenie").
I hesitate to proclaim that Harvey defies
everything for fear of lumping her with the
over-present bands so intensely dedicated to
their quest to rebel that they end up wallow
ing in their own self-important angst. But
Harvey does defy nearly everything, while
laughing at everyone — especially herself—
along the way.
Most apparent in "4 Track Demos" is
Harvey's scorn for conventional sensuality.
Just when we thought music had exhausted
every sexual cliche, she not only jolts us out
of aesthetic complacency, but also conveys a
sort of asexual sexuality that exists outside of
the bounds of gender and sexual orientation:
"You sleep / You crawl / Between / My legs /..
. I'll make / You queen / of everything / No
need / For God / No need / For Him / Just take
/ My hand / You'll be / My bride / Just take /
That fruit / Put it / Inside" ("Snake").
While we might be taken back by the
bizarreness of it all, Harvey's brand of sensu
al mockery does have a certain primal ur
gency to it that seems to reassure us that sex
can still be sexy even if we choose to laugh at
it:"I can hardly wait / It's been so long / I've
lost my taste / Say angel come / say lick my

face / let fall your drapes / 1 play the part / I
open this mouth wide / Eat your heart"
("Hardly Wait").
So not only is there a glimmer of hope for
sex in popular music (see you later, Janet

Jackson), wc can take heart that even when PJ
Harvey is up there in Billboard's Top 10, they
will remain the true alternative to the many
pseudo-irreverent bands who have sold out.

PJ Harvey's "4-Track Demos" demonstrates that her status as an "alternative pick"
hasn't caused her to sell out to the commercial mainstream.
There it was. Smack-dab amid Tower
Records' "Alternative Picks" was PJ Harvey's
"4-Track Demos." Polly Jean's skinny, un
shaven, black-angora-lingerie-clad self had
been reduced to a one-square-inch CD-case
replica, right next to James' "Laid." The pic
ture seemed bleak.
For artists like Polly Jean Harvey and her
self-titled band, the music business presents a
catch-22. They define themselves by veering
away from the mainstream, but eventually fall
victim to the "U2 syndrome." The price of
success often entails embracing the very
things they tried to avoid — and touting the
"alternative" label all the way, deluding them
selves into thinking they haven't sold out.
So far, the British trio PJ Harvey has avoid
ed the trap, being named "Pop Music Face of
'93" by the Los Angeles Times and USA
Today, but nevertheless remaining part of the
underground — both in sound and spirit.
If PJ Harvey can survive "Pop Music Face
of '93," I figure they can weather their way
through Tower's "Alternative Picks." And "4
Track Demos," the original demo recordings
of the band's latest album "Rid of Me," re
confirms my hopes.
"4-Track Demos" — like "Rid of Me" —
maintains PJ Harvey's satirical, hard-edged
and defiant spirit, as we see Harvey herself
grow into the angst-riddcn yet comical per
sona that her U.S. debut "Dry" conceived.
1 ler emotional utterances evolve into cathar
tic, ear-splitting wails in songs like "Legs"
and "Snake."
As the title indicates, the songs on
"Demos" are recorded as 4-tracks, meaning
that four layers of recorded sound are com
bined to create, in this case, a distinctive re
verberating, raw sound with plenty of amp
feedback.
The paring down of the music to its bare

bones allows us to relish Harvey's throaty,
just-woke-up-in morning-with-a-hangover
voice in all its indomitable sarcasm and spir
it. Despite its roughness, the strength and
gravity of her voice, coupled with her trade
mark short, irregular verses, demands noth
ing less than our undivided attention.
But the real beauty of 1 larvey — and what
has saved her from her own success — is that
she never, ever takes herself too seriously. We
can almost see her wry grin after she belts out
lyrics like, "1 want to bathe in milk / Eat
grapes / Robert DeNiro sit on my face"
("Reeling"), or "You come and measure me /
I'm 20 inches long." ("50 ft. Queenie").
I hesitate to proclaim that Harvey defies
everything for fear of lumping her with the
over-present bands so intensely dedicated to
their quest to rebel that they end up wallow
ing in their own self-important angst. But
Harvey does defy nearly everything, while
laughing at everyone — especially herself—
along the way.
Most apparent in "4 Track Demos" is
Harvey's scorn for conventional sensuality.
Just when we thought music had exhausted
every sexual cliche, she not only jolts us out
of aesthetic complacency, but also conveys a
sort of asexual sexuality that exists outside of
the bounds of gender and sexual orientation:
"You sleep / You crawl / Between / My legs /..
. I'll make / You queen / of everything / No
need / For God / No need / For Him / Just take
/ My hand / You'll be / My bride / Just take /
That fruit / Put it / Inside" ("Snake").
While we might be taken back by the
bizarreness of it all, Harvey's brand of sensu
al mockery does have a certain primal ur
gency to it that seems to reassure us that sex
can still be sexy even if we choose to laugh at
it:"I can hardly wait / It's been so long / I've
lost my taste / Say angel come / say lick my

face / let fall your drapes / 1 play the part / I
open this mouth wide / Eat your heart"
("Hardly Wait").
So not only is there a glimmer of hope for
sex in popular music (see you later, Janet

Jackson), wc can take heart that even when PJ
Harvey is up there in Billboard's Top 10, they
will remain the true alternative to the many
pseudo-irreverent bands who have sold out.
