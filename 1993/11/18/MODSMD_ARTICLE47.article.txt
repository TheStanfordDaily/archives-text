# "Shaq Diesel" Shaquille O'Neal
## spins 
### 
Can Shaq both rap and play ball?
After hearing "What's Up Doc? (Can We
Rock)," Shaquille O'Neal's debut with the FU-
Schnickens, I was optimistic. 1 thought Shaq
had skills. I thought wrong. Even with some of
the best producers in the industry laying the
tracks, his second effort, "Shaq Diesel," proved
to be a Shaq-sized disappointment.
With titles like "(1 Know I Got) Skill/.,"
"I'm Outstanding" and"I Hate 2

Brag," Shaq's style
proves too "brag
gadocious." I lis rhy
mes are so slow that
he sounds like a tape
when the batteries
run down. Weak
lyrics such as those
in "(I Know I Got)
Skillz" — "Don't
need to drink cro
oked eye juice to get
loose / My favorite

cartoon is Bullwinkle the Moose" — can be
found throughout the album. 1 had to stop lis
tening after 1 heard the chorus of "Let Me In,
Let Me In" which goes "Not by the hairs on my
chinny chin chin."
If you look hard, you can find the few
bright spots on this album, but Shaq usually
isn't in them.
Guest appearances arc made by Def Jef,
Phife (from A Tribe Called Quest), Erick Ser
mon (formerly of EPMD) and the FU-
Schnickens. These spots uplift Shaq's weak
performance and make the album mediocre
at best.
The producers are not at fault for Shaq's
feeble attempt to enter the world of hip-hop.
The beats and bass lines on this record are phat
and funky. Def Jef, Krick Sermon, Ali Shaheed,
Colin Wolfe and K-Cut (of Main Source) lay
down beats that do not disappoint.
If you could take out Shaq's rhymes and
leave the music and guest appearances, this
could be one of the best albums of the year.
But as is, I'm about as likely to buy "Shaq
Diesel" as the Three Little Pigs were to let the
wolf in the door — "Not by the hair of my
chinny chin chin."
