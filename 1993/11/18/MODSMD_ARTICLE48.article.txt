# "CUCKOO" Curve
## 
### 
The overlapping, melded sounds of
Curve, a female-fronted quintet from Eng
land, are similar to those you might unex
pectedly overhear from a hand jamming in
the darkness behind the Knoll late at night.
On their second full-length album, "CUCK
CX)," the band has a spacy, electric, modern
(jothic sound, much like a less dreamy, more in
tense version of Ixish. On the surface, their
tonality has a droning quality that is dearer than
the blended sounds Ixish uses, but the band's
sound remains tediously unvarying throughout
"CUCKOO." Under the surface, they resemble a
modernized version of old Jesas and Mary
Chain with their diversity in guitar styles and
overlays of otherworldly effects.
The first song, "Missing Link," exemplifies
their motley guitar styles, beginning with an
intense feel reminiscent of Sonic Youth that is
eerily matched by equally vibrant lyrics. The
guitars eventually haze over, as if pulled by
the intensity of the singer's voice into a more
surreal style.

And it is definitely evident from the lyrics
that singer Toni Halliday is very opinionated
on a myriad of issues. Man-woman relation
ships are a prominent theme, exemplified in
the title of the fine song "Men are from Mars,
Women are from Venus." Detailing how rela
tionships falter, she sings, "Turn it up / Turn
it down: Switch it on: Switch it off."
She continues in the same vein in the tol
erable "Turkey Crossing" by examining a re
lationship and scornfully proclaiming to an
ex-lover, "I'm finished with you / Please be
finished with me: I've had it with you." And
this feeling culminates in the only acoustic
song, "l.eft of Mother."
Even if you do not appreciate "CUCKOO"
's lyrics, you can easily lose track of them in
its swirling sounds. This is most appealing
when you are in the right mood — lying on
your moldy couch in the dark, preparing for
a big night of drinking by listening to an
album that requires minimal exertion to
enjoy. After an alcoholic binge and a hang
over headache, you'll wake up the next
morning and probably realize that about half
of the songs on "CUCKOO" are good, and
half just become tedious in their similarity.
