# "God Shuffled His Feet" Crash Test Dummies
## 
### 
The Crash Test Dummies? Where has that
name come up before? Oh, yeah, it hasn t.
But where have I heard that voice boom in
the past? Pearl Jam? Nah, these guys are from
Canada....
There's a certain je ne sais quoi to Brad
Roberts' voice that this reviewer has en
countered in only one other place (Eddie
Vedder), a certain throaty huskiness that
harmonizes well with backup vocalist Ellen
Reid. But it's also a voice that grates on the
ears if you listen to it enough. Still, its a nice
treat for the listener on "God Shuffled His
Feet," the Crash Test Dummies' second
record.
"God Shuffled His Feet" is in much the
same line as their first effort, "The Ghosts
That Haunt Me," only this time they've come
through with something that's a bit folksier
and a lot more serious.
While licks such as "Superman's Song"
and "Androgynous"— which made the first
album a lot of fun — are not present on this
production, the overall music quality is very
high. "God Shuffled His Feet" is the Crash
Test Dummies' attempt to get on the 90s
bandwagon of artsiness and religious ques
tioning.

Two of the songs, the title track and
"Swimming in Your Ocean," wonder about
God's motives for creating this crazy, crazy
world — or even if he knew what he was
doing at all.
Other songs delve into a more artistic
domain, dealing with T.S. Eliot, I itian, cof
fee and how a duck knows which way is
south. Altogether, the album's tracks are
very amusing, but in a more distant way
than the group's interactive, enveloping
first album.
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of
"God Shuffled his Feet" is the fear that shines
through on a number of tracks. Painted on
this canvas of dim misdirection is a portrait
of a man who's quite afraid of death — a par
ticular mode of death, even.
Brad sings about the cancer he feels is
coming to claim him years down the line ("x
-ray" is used in three different songs, which is
2.7 usages above the accepted average for a
rock 'n' roll album these days). And what's
more, he feels his skin drying out, his hair
thinning, and his liver slowly rotting away,
which makes for several interesting tunes, to
be sure.
All in all, the Crash Test Dummies has
filled an hour with blaring accordions, nice
acoustic gee-tars and wry witticisms. Which
is just what we expected.
