# NAFTA approved by 34-vote margin

WASHINGTON (AP) - In a hard*
earned triumph for President Clinton,
the House approved the North Ameri
can Free Trade Agreement last night
to fuse the United States, Mexico and
Canada into the world's largest trad
ing bloc.
The 234-200 vote sent the measure
to the Senate, where leaders predicted
approval within a few days. "NAFTA
is a lock," predicted GOP Leader Bob
Dole in a written statement.
Clinton, beaming, lauded the bipar
tisan House vote. "Tonight I am proud
to say we have not flinched," he said.
"We had to come from a long way back
to win this fight." NAFTA will "ex
pand our exports, create new jobs and
help us assert America's leadership in
the global economy," said the presi
dent, who leaves today for a trade
meeting in Seattle with leaders of 15
Asian nations.
The House rendered its verdict
after a daylong debate that reflected
high-minded disagreements over
America's role in the world econo
my and bare-knuckled politics.
Scores of labor-backed Democrats
abandoned their president, but
132 Republicans signed on to
assure passage.
The 34-vote margin was far
wider than anticipated, the result
of a furious last-minute lobbying
blitz that blended presidential
phone calls with concessions to
key lawmakers concerned about
the pact's impact on a variety of
domestic industries.
A cheer went up in the crowded
chamber when the vote count
passed the 218 needed to approve
the pact. Opponents stood in
clumps, shaking their heads and
grimacing at the result.
"A vote for NAFTA is in the
great tradition of our party,"
House GOP Leader Bob Michel of
Illinois said in a ringing speech of
support. "So let it be said on this
crucial vote tonight, that we
Republicans did not sacrifice the
jobs of tomorrow to the fears of

today."
Democratic Leader Richard
Gephardt summed up for the
opponents who fear the pact will
throw thousands of Americans
out of work. "Deficient and
flawed," he said of NAFTA. "We
cannot and must not expose our
workers and our corporations to
unfair competition."
The accord would take effect
on Jan 1. It would create a conti
nental free-trade zone by gradual
ly eliminating tariffs over 15
years. All industries would be
affected, from fruits and vegeta
bles to banking and automobiles.
Administration officials and
some lawmakers also said a favor
able vote would strengthen Clin
ton's hand as he departs for the
Seattle trade talks — and lead to
freer trade with Europe and all of
South America, as well.
For his part, Clinton said he
hoped he and Congress could
build on the bipartisan coopera
tion that carried NAFTA to pas
sage. "Tonight the leaders of both
parties found common ground in
voting for the common good," he

said. Clinton also reached out to
those who had opposed him.
"They have my respect," he said.
The vote count showed 102
Democrats and 132 Republicans
voting for the pact. There were 43
Republican votes against and 156
Democratic votes. The House's
lone independent, Rep. Bernie
Sanders of Vermont, voted
against the agreement.
A total of 245 lawmakers spoke
in 13 hours of debate — more
than half the House.
Opponents vented their anger
over concessions the administra
tion made to line up votes. "If this is
such a good deal why did we almost
have to give the portico away on the
White House to get it?" said Rep.
Butler Derrick, D-S.C.
House Speaker Thomas Foley,
D-Wash., who spoke last, conced
ed the pact wasn't perfect. "One
can always find defects and defi
ciencies. But this is for this
moment an opportunity to
expand our trade, to reach out
beyond our borders, to continue
our leadership, to seize the
future."
