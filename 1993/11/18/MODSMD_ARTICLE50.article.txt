# "BUHLooNE MINDSTATE" De La Soul
## 
### 
It was 1988: the curtains were pulled and
hip-hop rhythms boomed from the sound
system. Then a wiry, dark-skinned brother
with horn-rimmed glasses and a high-top
fade followed by a stocky light-skinned broth
er with a dread-locked fade "skipped" to the
audience while their chubby deejay adeptly
manipulated the vinyl on the turntables.
As the emcees started delivering Long Is
land-accented lyrics about "potholes in their
lawn" I looked around as the predominantly
white audience improvised new dance moves
straight from the suburbs. And then as the
excitement of the crowd washed over me, 1
thought, "Boy ain't rap changed."
The hip-hop group was De La Soul —
Posdnuos, Trugoy and deejay Mase — and
their latest release "BUHLooNE MIND
STATE" continues a brand of innovative
beats and rhymes that helped to broaden the
definition of hip-hop today.
Their mellow sound is a combination of
smooth lyrics, creative pop, R&B and jazz
loops and bass-kicks from the street.
"BUHLooNE MINDSTATE" sounds like it's
straight from the 1960s with a folksy, hyp
notic "hippie" flavor.
Continuously experimenting with past

sounds, "Area" sounds like a cut from a mid
-1970s funk band. Its opening drum beat
drops like an impromptu jam at a rock con
cert. Then a funky guitar line, reminiscent of
old Aerosmith solos, slithers in on top, mak
ing us want to shake our rumps.
But it ain't over yet. Like a crew of freestyle
bandits, "Plugs" One and Two ambush the
arrangement with a laid-back lyrical flow
that kicks the track to even greater heights.
Posdnuos and Trugoy rap about the diffi
culty of defining themselves in an exploitive
white America in "I Am 1 Be." The emcees de
liver thoughtful lyrics over a jazzy piano and
an occasional trumpet and harmonica. L)e La
describes the "new generation of slaves" —
hip-hop artists, whose individuality is de
fined by the corporate hierarchy.
Furthermore, the songs are supposed to
make audiences reminiscence about the past
and present experiences that define what
their goals are for the future.
Helped by samples from Michael Jackson,
Smolcey Robinson and the Bar-Kays, Delis
first single "Breakadawn" has a hypnotic sound
reminiscent of late 70s soul. The combination
of samples creates a quiet storm of soft vocals,
sweet harmonies and mellow drum beats.
De La Soul definitely isn't dead. They con
tinue to push the hip-hop envelope with in
novative music.
