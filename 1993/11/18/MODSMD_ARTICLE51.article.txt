The Beverly Hillbillies
While definitely in the stupid genre
of filmmaking, the nostalgia value of
the "Hillbillies" and several comical
ly inspired performances (Cloris
Leachman, Lily Tomlin, Diedrich
Bader) save the movie from utter un
acceptability. Despite its flaws, "The
Beverly Hillbillies" remains a fun trip
through the time-warp machine. PG
Farewell My Concubine
The directorial method of filming
shots through objects such as fire
and smoke aptly reflects the confu
sion of China's ever-changing politi
cal situation over the many years the
film depicts. History is the dominant
character, continually interrupting
and changing the lives of the three
main characters and the Peking
Opera of which they are both a por
tion and a reflection R
Fatal Instinct
Although it seems like it would be
just another parody of a tired film
genre, "Fatal Instinct" manages to
pull itself into the level of superior,
silly and sophomoric humor that is
always appreciated — given the
right state of mind. Featuring a
strong cast and references to almost
every '80s blockbuster, it almost
makes you want to see "Jurassic
Fugitive " PG-13

Fearless
In a suspended moment when dis
aster strikes, when the end is un
avoidable, it is then that one can say.
"This is it — this is the moment of
death — I have no fear." Jeff Bridges
and Rosie Perez are justified in fear
lessness because their superb por
trayals of grief complement a strong
script and remarkable directing to
produce a film that flies high. R
A Home of Our Own
A plot focused on a single mother and
her six kids hauling out to Idaho in
1962 in search of their own house has
great potential to be merely an exercise
in heavy schlock. Fortunately, the in
spiring performance of Kathy Bates,
the realistic looks and acting of the kids
and the absence of fairy-tale endings
help the film avoid this cinematic pitfall
and create a real family picture. PG
M. Butterfly
This adaptation of David Henry
Hwang's play could have been por
trayed as a look at a naive French diplo
mat deceived into kinky sex by a con
niving Chinese freak or a thoughtful, if
scathing, criticism of popular percep
tions of Asiarf women and men. Fortu
nately, Hwang's collaboration on the
screenplay and the ingenious decision
to cast John Lone as Song Liling pre
serve the intended societal critique R

Nightmare Before Christmas
Tim Burton's and the Walt Disney
Corporation's different management
styles lead to a remarkably uneven
film — the combination of Burton's
brilliant stop-action and Disney's
corporate caution. Despite potential
ly intriguing characters, the film is
cold, dry and unmoving — plotless
and heartless PG
Remains of the Day
Possessed with ineluctable British
reserve, Anthony Hopkins plays a
manservant who suddenly finds his
code of loyalty no longer tenable in
1930s Britain. Hopkins gives an in
credible performance that is self-re
strained in word and deed, but nev
ertheless packed with painfully raw
emotions. More riveting than
"Howard's End," "The Remains of
the Day" is a wrenching love story, a
war movie, and above all a sympa
thetic portrait of a decent though
flawed human being seeking to bet
ter his life. PG
Robocop 3
Same plot, same director, worse act
ing, worse script, worse star This time
around, Robocop is programmed to
work for an evil corporation, short-cir
cuits and begins to help the victims
Numerous scenes copied directly
from other films and a script too shal

low for any real theme leads to the
hope that Robocop will short-circuit
again and turn on his producers R
Ruby in Paradise
The feature-film debut of Ashley
Judd as Ruby Lee Gissing — a
woman who escapes Tennessee to
avoid getting stuck in the same old
rut Although the action is slow, the
real evolution comes in Ruby's
stream of consciousness as materi
alized by her journal writings and
portrayed through Judd's strong
performance. However, the film
loses some of its charm by veering
away from psychological drama and
focusing on the heroine's financial
troubles — the least interesting and
original aspect of the plot. R
Short Cuts
Unfortunately genius does not al
ways produce quality work, and
Robert Altman's latest three-hour
epic is proof of that principle. A bit
tersweet ode to life in decaying Los
Angeles based on Raymond Carv
er's writings, Altman's series of vi
gnettes sporting 22 characters ne
glects its main character — the city
of Los Angeles. What remains is a
cutaway diagram of Altman's direc
torial prowess and a bunch of sto
ries more entertainingly busy then
poignantly literary. R
