### 
Singer Toni Halliday and her
band Curve bring their darkly
tinged, electric alternative
sounds to San Francisco on Nov.
26 as part of a nationwide tour.
The British quintet will be per
forming the slightly cosmic, but
mesmerizing songs off their
newest release, "CUCKOO," as
well as tunes from their U.S.
debut "Doppelganger." Curve
will perform at Slim's, 333 11th
St. in San Francisco. For more
information, call 621-3330.
