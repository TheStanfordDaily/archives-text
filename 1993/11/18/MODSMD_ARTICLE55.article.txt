# The
						last word on...
## stupid sequels 
### 
"Look Who's Talking Tomor
row" is the seventh film in the
"Look Who's Talking" series star
ring Kirstie Alley and John Travol
ta as the couple whose children,
dogs and cats provide commen
tary about their lives audible only
to the audience. This newest film
features the thoughts — and
sound effects—of their furniture.

"Month at Bernie's" —
the producers of "Weekend
at Bernie's" decided one

weekend wasn't long enough for
all the fun of the eighth sequel.
Did you ever wonder why the
movie sequels are made? For the
most part, movie execs must
think we have really short mem
ories because most sequels are
pale imitations of the first fea
ture — with more stupid jokes,

worse plots, worse scripts, lesser
known and less-talented stars.
Personally, 1 just can't wait until
they make a movie out of "Scar
lett" — the absolutely horrid,
happy-ending sequel to "Gone
With the Wind." It wasn't even
written by Margaret Mitchell.
How bad can the film version be?
