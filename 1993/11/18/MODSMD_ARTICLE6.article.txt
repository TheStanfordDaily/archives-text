# Students launch gay frat
## Colony formed with social, not political, motive 
### Megan Himan Staff writer 
Though just a week old, the Delta Lamb
da Phi fraternity's first "colony" at Stan
ford has already established itself as a
unique addition to the Greek community.
But the four recently initiated pledges of
the nation's only gay fraternity would
rather just be a regular part of the gang.
They've already begun surrounding them
selves with the traditional trappings of
Greek life — including a motto, a song, a
crest and even initiation ceremonies, which
junior John Moore would describe only as a
"fraternity secret."
Part of the reason for emphasizing the

fraternity's social aspects is that the
pledges want to differentiate the fraternity
from the lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Com
munity Center.
"The LGBCC is a very wonderful re
source, but it is very politically active, and
for someone who |may have| just come out,
it can be very daunting," said senior Pierre
Rivera, one of the four men inducted in a
ceremony last Wednesday with Delta
Lambda Phi brothers from San Francisco
State and San Jose State.
"The fraternity is an alternative for men
to meet each other in an environment that
is less politically charged," Rivera said.
"You can socialize with other gay
men without the pressure of being
out."
Senior Ken Dunn, another
pledge, also emphasized the fra
ternity's social draw. "The combat
boots of activism can get too heavy
— that's why I want to put on my
tennis shoes, play a football game,
and kick back and be social."
Rivera said he once considered
rushing one of the already estab

lished fraternities, but changed
his mind. "I didn't think that the
frats would be very gay-friendly,
or at least I've heard," he said.
Interest in starting a new fra
ternity was first sparked during
last year's Bisexual, Gay and Les
bian Awareness Days, when a
panel of Delta Lambda Phi mem
bers from San Francisco State dis
cussed their fraternity.
The founding members also felt
a fraternity would be more united.
"In a fraternity, the membership
is very stable, whereas with just a
regular student group, member
ship tends to flow. You have more

of a commitment from your fra
ternity brothers," Moore said.
The pledges will be initiated —
promoted to full brotherhood —
in the first week of December, and
will then apply to the national
chapter to become a fraternity.
Delta Lambda Phi's rush
events are planned to coincide
with the events from established
fraternities, and the pledges hope
that they will be a regular part of
Greek life by the end of this year.
Dunn said Delta Lambda Phi
has not encountered any problems
with other fraternities — probably
"due to the political correctness on

campus." He did, however,
express doubts about the open
ness of the Greek system to their
fraternity. "Not to say that there
aren't homosexuals in the Greek
system, but as a whole [the Greek
system is] not exactly conducive to
them," he said.
According to LGBCC adviser
Troy Gilbert, reaction from the
gay community has been varied.
"Some people believe we should
not perpetuate old paradigms
[involving gay membership in fra
ternities], but others believe we
should transform old paradigms
to be open to all people — includ

ing our community."
Although Delta Lambda Phi
currently only has four inducted
members, the fraternity expects to
grow in the future. "From the feel
ings I'm gathering, as a communi
ty a lot of frosh have expressed
interest in the fraternity, but
they're not allowed to rush until
spring. A lot of upperclassmen are
also watching to see how our first
couple of months go," Dunn said.
However, he said he had ques
tions about Delta Lambda Phi's
rush process. "One concern of mine
is that Delta Lambda Phi will
become a dumping group for guys

trying to pledge other fraternities. I
just want Delta Lambda Phi to be
another option," Dunn said. "If
they feel more comfortable at
another fraternity, I would certain
ly hope that the fraternity would
feel comfortable rushing them in."
Although Delta Lambda Phi
was started by gay men, heterosex
uals are also allowed in the frater
nity. "The national policy is that
the fraternity is founded by gay
men for all men," Dunn said. "The
fraternity is geared toward gay
men, so it's more of a self-selection
process, although there are hetero
sexual members nationally."

for someone who |may have| just come out,
it can be very daunting," said senior Pierre
Rivera, one of the four men inducted in a
ceremony last Wednesday with Delta
Lambda Phi brothers from San Francisco
State and San Jose State.
"The fraternity is an alternative for men
to meet each other in an environment that
is less politically charged," Rivera said.
"You can socialize with other gay
men without the pressure of being
out."
Senior Ken Dunn, another
pledge, also emphasized the fra
ternity's social draw. "The combat
boots of activism can get too heavy
— that's why I want to put on my
tennis shoes, play a football game,
and kick back and be social."
Rivera said he once considered
rushing one of the already estab

lished fraternities, but changed
his mind. "I didn't think that the
frats would be very gay-friendly,
or at least I've heard," he said.
Interest in starting a new fra
ternity was first sparked during
last year's Bisexual, Gay and Les
bian Awareness Days, when a
panel of Delta Lambda Phi mem
bers from San Francisco State dis
cussed their fraternity.
The founding members also felt
a fraternity would be more united.
"In a fraternity, the membership
is very stable, whereas with just a
regular student group, member
ship tends to flow. You have more

of a commitment from your fra
ternity brothers," Moore said.
The pledges will be initiated —
promoted to full brotherhood —
in the first week of December, and
will then apply to the national
chapter to become a fraternity.
Delta Lambda Phi's rush
events are planned to coincide
with the events from established
fraternities, and the pledges hope
that they will be a regular part of
Greek life by the end of this year.
Dunn said Delta Lambda Phi
has not encountered any problems
with other fraternities — probably
"due to the political correctness on

campus." He did, however,
express doubts about the open
ness of the Greek system to their
fraternity. "Not to say that there
aren't homosexuals in the Greek
system, but as a whole [the Greek
system is] not exactly conducive to
them," he said.
According to LGBCC adviser
Troy Gilbert, reaction from the
gay community has been varied.
"Some people believe we should
not perpetuate old paradigms
[involving gay membership in fra
ternities], but others believe we
should transform old paradigms
to be open to all people — includ

ing our community."
Although Delta Lambda Phi
currently only has four inducted
members, the fraternity expects to
grow in the future. "From the feel
ings I'm gathering, as a communi
ty a lot of frosh have expressed
interest in the fraternity, but
they're not allowed to rush until
spring. A lot of upperclassmen are
also watching to see how our first
couple of months go," Dunn said.
However, he said he had ques
tions about Delta Lambda Phi's
rush process. "One concern of mine
is that Delta Lambda Phi will
become a dumping group for guys

trying to pledge other fraternities. I
just want Delta Lambda Phi to be
another option," Dunn said. "If
they feel more comfortable at
another fraternity, I would certain
ly hope that the fraternity would
feel comfortable rushing them in."
Although Delta Lambda Phi
was started by gay men, heterosex
uals are also allowed in the frater
nity. "The national policy is that
the fraternity is founded by gay
men for all men," Dunn said. "The
fraternity is geared toward gay
men, so it's more of a self-selection
process, although there are hetero
sexual members nationally."
