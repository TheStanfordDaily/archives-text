# Students launch gay frat
## Colony formed with social, not political, motive 
### Megan Himan Staff writer 
Though just a week old, the Delta Lamb
da Phi fraternity's first "colony" at Stan
ford has already established itself as a
unique addition to the Greek community.
But the four recently initiated pledges of
the nation's only gay fraternity would
rather just be a regular part of the gang.
They've already begun surrounding them
selves with the traditional trappings of
Greek life â€” including a motto, a song, a
crest and even initiation ceremonies, which
junior John Moore would describe only as a
"fraternity secret."
Part of the reason for emphasizing the

fraternity's social aspects is that the
pledges want to differentiate the fraternity
from the lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Com
munity Center.
"The LGBCC is a very wonderful re
source, but it is very politically active, and
for someone who |may have| just come out,
it can be very daunting," said senior Pierre
Rivera, one of the four men inducted in a
ceremony last Wednesday with Delta
Lambda Phi brothers from San Francisco
State and San Jose State.
"The fraternity is an alternative for men
to meet each other in an environment that
is less politically charged," Rivera said.
