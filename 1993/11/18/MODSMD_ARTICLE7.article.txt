# Challenging the University
## Prof. Manley criticizes policies lacking principles 
### Jin W. Jung Staff writer 
If Stanford is to be a great university,
administrators must uphold moral values
and be more responsive to criticism from
students and faculty, Political Science Prof.
John Manley said in a speech last night.
In an event titled "A Challenge to the
University — We Can Do Better," Manley
addressed a gathering of more than 20 peo
ple at Old Union's Clubhouse Auditorium,
and later answered questions from the au
dience.
Manley said Stanford administrators, in
their quest for increased revenue, have sac
rificed the underlying moral principles

which should guide a university.
Manley decried the University's recent
decision to distance itself from Webb
Ranch, whose workers receive slightly
above minimum wage and are unable to af
ford health insurance, as "impossible and
wrong. The University is supposed to be a
special place. People expect more from us.
"To become a glittering success, we have
lost our purpose. Sold it,"he said.
Manley also said he believes that admin
istrators are tightening their connections
with the Hoover Institution, which he calls
the "leading conservative think-tank in the
country," so that donors continue to con-
tribute.
"Although the administration
may cite many reasons for the
closening of ties, the clearest one
is money," he said.
Another example Manley cited
of revenue fraught with politics
was Stanford's slow, case-by-case
divestment several years ago
from companies that did business
in South Africa. According to
Manley, the University should
not make any investments that
have "political strings" attached
because in so doing the Universi
ty may compromise its role as a
"moral beacon" for students and
the community at large.
Manley said he believes that in
order for Stanford to be great,
administrators must adequately
respond to criticism from stu
dents and faculty so that deci
sions are made more collectively.
"In the past 10 years, I have
been engaging in open subversion. I
have been constantly stonewalled..
.. Debate is offered and not accept
ed (by administrators). Nothing
happens. This is what I think is
troublesome," he said.
Manley said that those stu
dents who actively criticize admin
istrative policy generally become
frustrated by its unresponsive
ness. But Manley contended that

students have a responsibility to
challenge decisions that they
believe to be immoral.
"I don't want to defer to
Casper, Kennedy or some gray
bearded professor. I'd place my
bets with the students' sense of
moral correctness," Manley said.
Jeaneah Paik, a junior major
ing in human biology, said she
believes that factors other than
an unresponsive university may
account for student apathy with
administrative issues.

She said admissions officers
may have selected students who
are too goal-oriented to venture
in fields outside of their immedi
ate academic interests!
In addition, members of the
audience were curious how deci
sions could be made by the Stan
ford community. Manley said he
had not devised a method but
suggested that there be a quar
terly forum, in which faculty and
students would influence admin
istrative policy.
