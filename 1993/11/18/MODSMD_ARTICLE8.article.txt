## Sullivan drawn to family-like atmosphere

Sunlight streams in
through the large picture win
dows in Kathleen Sullivan's
third-floor office in the Law
School.
"I wonder what the weath
er's like in Boston right now,"
the eminent constitutional and
criminal law scholar muses
with a smile.
Sullivan rocked the legal
world last year when, after
spending a year at Stanford as
a visiting professor, she left
Harvard Law School and
moved west.
"Back in the spring of '92
when I was visiting ... I came
into my last class and it was
very quiet," Sullivan remem
bers. "I scribbled all over the
top chalkboard until I finally
ran out of space and rolled the
board up from the bottom posi
tion to the top, and underneath
they had scrawled in giant let
ters 'Defect to Stanford.'


Burl Herman — Daily
First-year Law School Prof. Kathleen Sullivan, who recently left Harvard Law School,
was drawn to Stanford by the school's family-like atmosphere and its paradise-like
setting.
"It was a message that I eventu
ally obeyed," she adds. "This place
was too good to be true. I mean,
who could resist a world-class law
school in paradise?"
Now, after spending the sum
mer settling in, Sullivan still seems
delighted with her decision.
"There are so many colleagues
here with which I can have wonder
ful conversations walking in the
Foothills," Sullivan says."The fac
ulty is not only not war-torn like
the Harvard faculty, but it's gener
ally full of lots of wonderful schol
ars who have become inspirations
and friends to me."
She leans back in her seat, casu
ally admiring the roomy view of
East campus and the space
beyond.
"Scale is the biggest difference
between the places," she observes
matter-of-factly. "California is
much vaster in its spaces than
Boston is, but the law school here
is more intimate ... more of a
family-like atmosphere."
Sullivan's termination of her
12-year relationship with Harvard
Law School — three as a student

and nine as a faculty member —
prompted many to question her
motivations. While many speculat
ed that Sullivan found Harvard a
hostile environment for women,
she continues to stress that she
was drawn to Stanford and not
pushed from Harvard.
Nonetheless, Sullivan remains
impressed by the Stanford Law
School's commitment to creating a
comfortable atmosphere for
female faculty and students.
"Since Barbara Babcock pio
neered the advent of women to the
faculty, Stanford has done extraor
dinarily well attracting women to
the faculty," Sullivan says. "Here I
don't feel like I'm the one woman
on 10 committees. Tokenism is just
not an issue here."
Though Sullivan has spent her
career being hailed as "the top
female scholar in her field" and
"the future of women in the legal
profession," she hopes people can
note her accomplishments apart
from her gender.
"I'm happy about whatever I
can do as a role model, but I furi
ously resist any notion of being
typecast as someone who only
advocates women's issues," Sulli
van says."I want people to know
me for my work — I don't want
being a woman to be the first thing

they notice about my work."
Sullivan's work can certainly
stand by itself. After graduating
from Cornell in 1976, she spent
two years at Oxford as a Marshall
Scholar before heading to Harvard.
After joining the Harvard law
faculty, Sullivan proceeded to take
the legal world by storm with her
frank legal insight, rocketing to
the top of her field. In the brief
time since she burst onto legal
scene, Sullivan has been called
"the rising star of the legal world"
and was picked by USA Today as a
possible Supreme Court nominee.
While some see a spot on the
bench in her future, Sullivan said
she is perfectly content at Stanford
for the moment — writing a book
on First-Amendment rights, teach
ing and hopefully finding time to
explore the Bay Area.
"Down the line I might want to
work inside the government, but
right now I'm very happy doing
what I'm doing," Sullivan says.
"People have asked me if I'd like to
be a judge, and maybe down the line
somewhere but not immediately. In
the near future, I look forward to
spending more time walking
around here and being outdoors."
"And the sun ... make sure you
mention spending time in the
sun," she adds, laughing.
