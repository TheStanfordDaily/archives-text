Would\fju like to be one of
The Happy Few?
Are you young and college-educated?
Arc you seriously searching for love?
We offer self-descriptive essays
written by people who are, like you,
looking for true love and
companionship. You decide whom
to contact. Why rely on chance alone
to find the person that is right for you
when you can try a more thoughtful
approach? (Also open to gays.) For
free information, write to:
