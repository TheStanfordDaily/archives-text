# Bloated DR system dilutes education, some say

The University's system of distribu
tion requirements has grown too large
for its own good and sapped intellectual
strength from the undergraduate cur

maintain.
Critics claim that while originally de

the Faculty Senate's Committee on Un

"The ways you can fulfill them are so
frivolous," said senior Alan Berube. "The
fact that I've taken classes [solely to ful

hours of work for each unit shows some

improvement — not abolition — is the
answer. And they placed that burden on
the Commission on Undergraduate Edu

Among students, the most common
gripe concerning DRs is, predictably,
that there are too many. Current fresh
