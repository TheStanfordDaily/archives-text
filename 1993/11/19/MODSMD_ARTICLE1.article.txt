# Bloated DR system dilutes education, some say
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
The University's system of distribu
tion requirements has grown too large
for its own good and sapped intellectual
strength from the undergraduate cur
riculum, some faculty and students
maintain.
Critics claim that while originally de
signed to enhance undergraduate educa
tion by exposing students to a wide array
of disciplines, the DR system is suffering

from declines in student interest and aca
demic rigor.
That kind of development has led
many members of the community to
question the viability and coherence of
the system, and whether it serves any
role for students other than to gobble
units on their study lists.
"The DR system is broken," said Po
litical Science Prof. David Brady, chair of
the Faculty Senate's Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies. "The present sys
tem is not achieving its goal — students

aren't coming away with breadth or
depth."
"When you get past the first three
areas (Cultures, Ideas and Values, World
Cultures and American Cultures) to the
other DRs, I doubt very much their over
all value," said English Prof. Ron Reb
holz.
Students also have questioned the ef
fectiveness of distribution requirements.
"The ways you can fulfill them are so
frivolous," said senior Alan Berube. "The
fact that I've taken classes [solely to ful

fill requirements! that require very few
hours of work for each unit shows some
thing's wrong."

Yet most agree that while there are de
ficiencies in the existing DR structure,
improvement — not abolition — is the
answer. And they placed that burden on
the Commission on Undergraduate Edu
cation, which has already pledged to ex
amine the issue and propose reforms.
Among students, the most common
gripe concerning DRs is, predictably,
that there are too many. Current fresh
men are expected to satisfy 10 distribu-

tion requirements by graduation,
one of which must also fulfill the
gender studies requirement.
Sophia Whyte, a sophomore
mqjoring in international rela
tions, questioned the necessity of
fulfilling three quantitative DRs.
"I'm a fuzzy," she said, "and it's
really annoying that I have to take
classes in math, natural science,
and technology and applied sci
ence, when there aren't a lot of
those classes that interest me."
She said such technical classes
should be "structured in a way
that is more relevant" to students
not specializing in the sciences.
On the other side of the fence is
a student like Be rube, a chemical
engineering But he, too,
feels that DRs in the humanities
have lost their intended value for
techie students like himself.
"The most important thing the
University should do is to make sure
the [humanities] classes engineers
are taking are writing intensive," he
said. "It would be of greater value to
engineers to take fewer classes in
the social sciences and humanities,
but with greater writing and discus
sion components."
For Ken Lin, a senior majoring
in biology who is scrambling to
meet the Area 8 requirement —
Philosophical, Social and Religious
Thought — this year has brought
on a sense of deja vu.
"I'm taking a class that I really
hate," he said, although he declined
to name it. "I've already read a lot
of the books, because of CIV. I
don't see what the point of the
requirement is, since I studied a lot
of literature and philosophy in CIV.
"Area 8 is a waste of time," he
concluded.
The result of such a long list of
requirements, some faculty mem
bers contend, is an abdication of
intellectual rigor among the cours
es that fulfill DRs.
"There are so many that, in
order to meet all the DRs, people
go through and pick the easiest
ones," Brady said. "That's what
they'll do bemuse they're rational.
Students look at the DRs as stuff
to be got out of the way."
"Not all the classes are very rig
orous," Rebholz said. "If the sys
tem is kept, there should be fewer
but more rigorous classes to
ensure that the purpose of DRs is
being met."
Rebholz said he doubts whether
many courses certified to meet
DRs even satisfy basic expectations
of what such classes should teach.
For example, the Faculty Sen
ate last Thursday approved a

course on ancient Greek ethics to
satisfy both the Literature and the
Arts and the Philosophical, Social
and Religious Thought DRs.
"Greek Ethics satisfying the lit
erature area?" Rebholz asked.
"Come on. People should satisfy
the literature requirement by
reading literature in the original
language."
Ironically, the most widely
hailed attribute of the DR system
— the vast amount of choices in
each area — is also cited as a con
tributor to the dilution of course
strength.
Currently, 114 courses satisfy
the Literature and the Fine Arts
DR, while 140 meet the Social and
Behavioral Sciences requirement
— a selection so wide that it
inevitably prompts some students
to seek out less-than-challenging
classes, faculty members said.
"If you get lists that are so long
they start to look like 'Courses and
Degrees,' that isn't good," said
Engineering Prof. James Adams,
who sat on the senate's subcom
mittee on distribution require
ments last year.
Even so, most faculty members
believe that the concept of distri
bution requirements is sound in
principle, offering Stanford under
graduates a unique, varied educa
tion.
Dean of the School of Earth Sci
ences Gary Ernst said the courses
in his school that satisfy DRs "are
doing the job. We get lots of stu
dents passing through these hal
lowed halls, and that's good for the
University."
Adams said he "believes in dis
tribution — people have different
intellectual approaches to life, and
it's good to sample them."
Civil Engineering Prof. Gil Mas
ters, who teaches one of the most
popular of the archetypal DR-satis
fying courses, CE 170, said that he
is not concerned with the motiva
tions students have for taking his
course, as long as they learn some
thing from it.
"I like the fact that it's on the
list — I don't care if students are
there to fulfill DRs or not," he said.
"If this is one way to round people
up, put them in class and give
them exposure to the topic, then
I'm all for it."
What faculty members like
Brady fear, though, is that not
enough courses combine accessibil
ity and substance. Therefore, the
undergraduate education commis
sion's task of coming up with bet
ter alternatives is urgent, Brady
said.
"The question the commission
is dealing with is, how do we get
the right mix of breadth and
depth?" he said. "How do we fix
the system?"

"Greek Ethics satisfying the lit
erature area?" Rebholz asked.
"Come on. People should satisfy
the literature requirement by
reading literature in the original
language."
Ironically, the most widely
hailed attribute of the DR system
— the vast amount of choices in
each area — is also cited as a con
tributor to the dilution of course
strength.
Currently, 114 courses satisfy
the Literature and the Fine Arts
DR, while 140 meet the Social and
Behavioral Sciences requirement
— a selection so wide that it
inevitably prompts some students
to seek out less-than-challenging
classes, faculty members said.
"If you get lists that are so long
they start to look like 'Courses and
Degrees,' that isn't good," said
Engineering Prof. James Adams,
who sat on the senate's subcom
mittee on distribution require
ments last year.
Even so, most faculty members
believe that the concept of distri
bution requirements is sound in
principle, offering Stanford under
graduates a unique, varied educa
tion.
Dean of the School of Earth Sci
ences Gary Ernst said the courses
in his school that satisfy DRs "are
doing the job. We get lots of stu
dents passing through these hal
lowed halls, and that's good for the
University."
Adams said he "believes in dis
tribution — people have different
intellectual approaches to life, and
it's good to sample them."
Civil Engineering Prof. Gil Mas
ters, who teaches one of the most
popular of the archetypal DR-satis
fying courses, CE 170, said that he
is not concerned with the motiva
tions students have for taking his
course, as long as they learn some
thing from it.
"I like the fact that it's on the
list — I don't care if students are
there to fulfill DRs or not," he said.
"If this is one way to round people
up, put them in class and give
them exposure to the topic, then
I'm all for it."
What faculty members like
Brady fear, though, is that not
enough courses combine accessibil
ity and substance. Therefore, the
undergraduate education commis
sion's task of coming up with bet
ter alternatives is urgent, Brady
said.
"The question the commission
is dealing with is, how do we get
the right mix of breadth and
depth?" he said. "How do we fix
the system?"
The University's system of distribu
tion requirements has grown too large
for its own good and sapped intellectual
strength from the undergraduate cur
riculum, some faculty and students
maintain.
Critics claim that while originally de
signed to enhance undergraduate educa
tion by exposing students to a wide array
of disciplines, the DR system is suffering

from declines in student interest and aca
demic rigor.
That kind of development has led
many members of the community to
question the viability and coherence of
the system, and whether it serves any
role for students other than to gobble
units on their study lists.
"The DR system is broken," said Po
litical Science Prof. David Brady, chair of
the Faculty Senate's Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies. "The present sys
tem is not achieving its goal — students

aren't coming away with breadth or
depth."
"When you get past the first three
areas (Cultures, Ideas and Values, World
Cultures and American Cultures) to the
other DRs, I doubt very much their over
all value," said English Prof. Ron Reb
holz.
Students also have questioned the ef
fectiveness of distribution requirements.
"The ways you can fulfill them are so
frivolous," said senior Alan Berube. "The
fact that I've taken classes [solely to ful

fill requirements! that require very few
hours of work for each unit shows some
thing's wrong."

Yet most agree that while there are de
ficiencies in the existing DR structure,
improvement — not abolition — is the
answer. And they placed that burden on
the Commission on Undergraduate Edu
cation, which has already pledged to ex
amine the issue and propose reforms.
Among students, the most common
gripe concerning DRs is, predictably,
that there are too many. Current fresh
men are expected to satisfy 10 distribu-

tion requirements by graduation,
one of which must also fulfill the
gender studies requirement.
Sophia Whyte, a sophomore
mqjoring in international rela
tions, questioned the necessity of
fulfilling three quantitative DRs.
"I'm a fuzzy," she said, "and it's
really annoying that I have to take
classes in math, natural science,
and technology and applied sci
ence, when there aren't a lot of
those classes that interest me."
She said such technical classes
should be "structured in a way
that is more relevant" to students
not specializing in the sciences.
On the other side of the fence is
a student like Be rube, a chemical
engineering But he, too,
feels that DRs in the humanities
have lost their intended value for
techie students like himself.
"The most important thing the
University should do is to make sure
the [humanities] classes engineers
are taking are writing intensive," he
said. "It would be of greater value to
engineers to take fewer classes in
the social sciences and humanities,
but with greater writing and discus
sion components."
For Ken Lin, a senior majoring
in biology who is scrambling to
meet the Area 8 requirement —
Philosophical, Social and Religious
Thought — this year has brought
on a sense of deja vu.
"I'm taking a class that I really
hate," he said, although he declined
to name it. "I've already read a lot
of the books, because of CIV. I
don't see what the point of the
requirement is, since I studied a lot
of literature and philosophy in CIV.
"Area 8 is a waste of time," he
concluded.
The result of such a long list of
requirements, some faculty mem
bers contend, is an abdication of
intellectual rigor among the cours
es that fulfill DRs.
"There are so many that, in
order to meet all the DRs, people
go through and pick the easiest
ones," Brady said. "That's what
they'll do bemuse they're rational.
Students look at the DRs as stuff
to be got out of the way."
"Not all the classes are very rig
orous," Rebholz said. "If the sys
tem is kept, there should be fewer
but more rigorous classes to
ensure that the purpose of DRs is
being met."
Rebholz said he doubts whether
many courses certified to meet
DRs even satisfy basic expectations
of what such classes should teach.
For example, the Faculty Sen
ate last Thursday approved a

course on ancient Greek ethics to
satisfy both the Literature and the
Arts and the Philosophical, Social
and Religious Thought DRs.

erature area?" Rebholz asked.
