# ASSU's first open house — finger lickin' good

### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
About 50 ASSU workers and
15 students met, mingled and ate
spicy chicken drumsticks at the
ASSU's first open house of the
year yesterday in its Tresidder
Union offices.
The open house was "an inter
nal event to allow different areas
of the ASSU to get to know each
other," giving senators, business
managers, service project man

agers, the permanent staff and
regular students the opportunity
to socialize, said senior Jason
Snyder, a member of the Council
of Presidents.
The event allowed senators to
"really find out" what a project
manager does, and vice versa. It
also gave students a chance to
find out more about what projects
the ASSU does.
"I think a lot of students don't
know what the ASSU is... This is
a chance for them to find out what

we're here for," said ASSU admin
istrative manager senior Larry Jen.
"I hope it makes students more
aware of what the ASSU has to
offer," said ASSU project manag
er David Schnabel. "So many
things that the ASSU does go
unseen."
Undergraduate senator Mork
Murdock added, "I thinks it's a
good idea for there to be a forum
where people can discuss issues,
whether it be senators with other
senators, or just any student who

comes by."
However, not all the students
who attended the open house
were motivated by such politically
idealistic reasons. "I just came tQ
eat the food. I knew I was going to
miss dinner, so I thought I'd stop
by," said senior Qasim Jami, who
works for ASSU Lecture Notes.
Snyder said the event was
"positive for both the internal
relations of the ASSU and for let
ting some people get to know th£
ASSU better."
