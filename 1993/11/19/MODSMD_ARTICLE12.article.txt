Airline attendants strike
Thousands of American Airlines passen
gers were shuffled to other carriers or later
flights yesterday when flight attendants
began the biggest airline strike in nearly five
years.
American wouldn't say how many flights it
was able to operate, but sources at another
major carrier familiar with American's opera
tion estimated 30 to 50 percent of American's
flights were disrupted.
The union, which struck yesterday at 7 a.m.
EST over wage and other contract issues,
claimed the walkout was 90 percent effective.
The union had demanded what it called a 16.9
percent pay hike by July 1995, saying members
have been building the carrier for a decade with
out getting anything in return.
The airline maintains that it needs to down
size and cut labor costs to be competitive with
other carriers.
