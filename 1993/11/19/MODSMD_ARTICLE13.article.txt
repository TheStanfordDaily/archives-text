# A 						day later, labor still bitter with Clinton
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Organized
labor responded frostily to an olive
branch from President Clinton yester
day after a bruising House struggle
over the North American Free Trade
Agreement. The Senate labored to
complete passage by week's end.
Departing for an international
trade conference in Seattle, Clinton
said NAFTA's House passage
Wednesday night would help him
fight for open markets throughout
the world.
He said Vice President A 1 Gore and
Chief of Staff Mack McLarty would fly
to Mexico City soon to work out imple
mentation of the pact designed to blend
the United States, Mexico and Canada
into the world's largest free-trade zone.
Clinton also called for cooperation
by both labor and management to
make sure the accord benefits "all the
working people of our country."

The beginning of Senate debate
duplicated arguments that ricocheted
throughout the House on Wednesday,
where a 234-200 vote showed more
Republicans than Democrats support
ing the legislation.
Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., com
plained that NAFTA would place "60
million Mexican workers in our work
force," costing Americans their jobs in
the process. But Sen. Max Baucus, D-
Mont., said the accord would open the
way to more markets for American
goods. A vote was expected tomorrow
at the earliest.
Clinton followed up on a midnight
phone call to AFL-CIO President Lane
Kirkland by expressing respect for the
"opinions and convictions of those who
did not" embrace NAFTA.
But neither Kirkland nor other
labor leaders seemed ready to forgive
the actions taken by the White House

to secure passage in the House.
"We won't forget what happened
here," Teamsters President Ron Carey
said in an interview with The Associat
ed Press. "We're the folks who went
out there and worked for a president
who talked repeatedly about jobs, and
here what we've done is export jobs."
Kirkland's remarks about Clinton
were less pointed, and he said organized
labor would do "everything that we can"
to advance health care legislation, Clin
ton's top legislative priority for 1994.
The AFL-CIO leader's voice broke
with emotion at times as he attacked
the House vote, saying American plants
would be moved to Mexico and Ameri
can workers "sold down the river."
Asked how labor would react to
Democratic lawmakers who voted for
the accord, Kirkland said, "The voting
list on this issue will be examined very,
very carefully." But he said he was

making no threats.
"It is not a threat to suggest to a
member of Congress . . . that this is an
issue of burning importance . . . and
that will weigh heavily on our response
to their appeals," he said.
If labor was slow to forgive, House
Democrats stressed unity after the
vote. "It's a big happy family," said
Democratic leader Richard Gephardt,
a Missouri Democrat who opposed the
agreement.
NAFTA would remake the econom
ic relationships among the United
States, Canada and Mexico, gradually
reducing tariffs over 15 years. Sup
porters say that would open the way to
vast new markets for American goods.
Opponents say U.S. firms would move
to Mexico for access to cheap labor and
laxer environmental standards, and
thousands of American workers would
lose their jobs.
