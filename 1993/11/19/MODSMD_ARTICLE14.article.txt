## Editorials All fans: play it safe

AFTER LAST year's Big
Game, the lead story in
many newspapers did not
highlight the Cardinal's 41-21 dis
mantling of the California Golden
Bears.
Instead, the story discussed the
violence and disorderliness of stu
dents from both Stanford and Cal.
During the game, Berkeley fans
attacked the Tree and Flag Boy,
and even after the match conclud
ed students from both schools
continued to hurl invectives, fruit
and paint at their respective
rivals.
While last year's altercations
merely had the unfortunate affect
of overshadowing yet another Car
dinal triumph, they easily could
have escalated into the type of
mob violence which remains a
danger to patrons of any large
sporting event.
Keeping this in mind, it would
be foolhardy for both students and

other attendees at tomorrow's Big
Game to ignore the importance of
personal restraint, even in the
heated atmosphere of the Stan
ford-Cal clash.
Cheering for the team of your
choice is perfectly acceptable. But
when cheering turns into violence,
the line between enthusiasm and
fanaticism is breached.
In addition, Stanford students
should realize that even if there is
no confrontation between them
selves and Berkeley denizens, the
students themselves may also pose
a risk to their own well-being.
The recent catastrophe in
which several University of Wis
consin students were injured
rushing onto the field after a victo
ry serves as a reminder that even
when the game is over, the need
for restraint is not.
Have fun at Big Game. But
leave the tackling, charging and
abuse to the football players.
