MOST VIDEO rental stores
require the imprint of your
credit card before they will
allow you to join.
But at the nearest video rental
location, not even a membership
card will get you a movie for the
night.
The Media Center at Meyer
Library has 6,500 movies, but the
only students who can borrow
them are the employees of Resi
dential Education.
Admittedly, the movies in the
Media Center are there for educa
tional purposes. But the same is
true for the books in the libraries,
and with the books there is a key
difference: when you check out a
book, you are allowed to read it for
pleasure.
Why shouldn't the same be true
for movies?
Moreover, loan privileges for
this collection should not be lim
ited to only a few select groups of
people. The video collection

should be made equally available
to all Stanford faculty and stu
dents, regardless of their rea
sons for wanting to borrow the
film.
The Meyer Media Center is a
great resource, and all students
should be entitled to use it — for
both educational purposes and
entertainment.
Obviously, Meyer is not a
video store. But with so many
movies on campus, students
should not have to rent from a
private company in Palo Alto or
elsewhere.
Residence staff members should
not have preferential treatment;
their uses for movies are not inher
ently better than anyone else's,
nor are they innately more respon
sible.
So the next time you go to
Meyer, you'd better bring your res
idence staff identification card —
because they don't take American
Express.
