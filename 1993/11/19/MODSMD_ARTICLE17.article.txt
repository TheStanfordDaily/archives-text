## Weenies: hold the relish 
### 
Sometimes it's a little hard to
"get psyched" (as our sorority
friends would say) for Big Game.
You just got shredded by midterms, finals
are looming on the horizon, you're broke,
it's raining and you had to do a problem
set during the Simpsons, AGAIN. The
last thing you feel like doing is slathering
red paint all over yourself and yelling
your head off in the stands. Celebrating
Stanford at this time of the quarter and
year seems like a stupid thing to suggest
until you think of one thing; you could be
at Cal.
Gloating is what gets me into the party
spirit. Just think about it. Those poor
Weenies have been in class since August,
biking up ferocious Berkeley hills past
ugly cement architecture, grinding away
in "small" classes with 800 students and
wishing they were here. I'm not saying
that we are inherently superior just
because we go to Stanford; I'm saying
that we were born superior and the Stan
ford admissions people simply had the
good sense to recognize it.
I'll admit that the "We got in" cheer is
a bit tasteless. No need to rub salt in the
wound, you know. We, in the upper eche
lons of humanity, can afford to be gener
ous to those slaving away under the yoke
of mediocrity.
Perhaps I'm being harsh because nine
out of 10 people in my family went to UC-

Berkeley. I narrowly escaped such a fate
myself. My friends from high school are
currently wallowing in the muck of that
"trade school to the North" (as Prof.
Waymouth put it). I have to be careful to
reinforce my distance from that odious
institution.
Every Stanfordite, though, should rel
ish Big Game season. It's the one time of
the year when we can emerge from the
bowels of Terman and Green to give our
selves a campus-wide pat on the back and
remember that we did, in fact, want to be
here at one point.
For those souls who are too charitable
to enjoy the gloating and who aren't look
ing for a party, there are still reasons to
get into the spirit. Numero uno is the
god-like Bill Walsh himself. How many
college teams can boast of a coach with
such a career? Besides, we're paying
through the nose for the guy. Personally,
I think he's worth it and I'm not just say
ing this because I think he's cute. The
alumni go nuts over him and that means
more moolah for us. (It always comes
down to money, doesn't it?) Since we're
all Bill Walsh share-holders, we should
pay attention to our investment.
Another big draw for repressed Stan
ford students is the chance to observe the
gender of your choice at their most ani
malistic. I guarantee that no matter how
cold it is, there will be plenty of young,

hair-flipping women in cut-ofTs and biki
ni tops showing off their store-bought
tans, among other things. The Dollies
promise to be bouncy as always, as long
as you don't mind an Ace bandage here or
there.
As for the men, the stands tend to be
less fruitful. The beer-gutted, high-fiv
ing guys and the "body by Green" grad
students will be out in full force. The
football players themselves are the best.
All those strong young men in tight
pants bashing into each other. How pri
mal! You don't have to be a fan to be
thrilled by it.
The best reason to go to Big Game is
that you are a part of the Stanford com
munity. Why pay eight thousand big ones
a quarter or work for the school if you
don't want to have anything to do with
Stanford tradition?
At the risk of sounding drippingly sen
timental, the football players (and every
other team) play their hearts out for us
and deserve our support. At least do the
school this favor â€” if you choose not to go
to the game, do something useful like
knitting salamander cozies for the win
ter.

Kathleen (rah!) likes her Weenies eovered
in mustard. How about you ?
