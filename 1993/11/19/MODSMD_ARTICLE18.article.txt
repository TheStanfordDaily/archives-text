## Animal rights activist expresses anger at Daily comic 
### 
ON NOV. 18 a letter I wrote to
The Daily was made the subject
of a joke in Mike Duh's comic
"Wilbur Hall." Duh showed three
scenes, all offensive: a drug addict dog
begging for a fix, a dog drinking his
own urine, and a dog being sodomized
by another dog.
Besides Duh's amateurism, the
comic underscores what is a very real
problem: the abuse animals face behind
laboratory doors is either ignored or
trivialized.
At Stanford, tens of thousands of
animals are experimented on for the
most trivial reasons in experiments
of dubious worth to the tune of tens

of millions of tax payer dollars per
year.
Our illustrious researchers can't
even keep from mistreating the ani
mals, let alone contribute to the pub
lic good.
In the last few weeks, The Daily
printed two front-page stories about the
"breakthroughs" at Stanford's animal
research facilities. One was for diabetes,
the other for lupus. But beneath the
exciting headlines, buried in the text are
two predictable qualifiers: the results
are preliminary and we must continue
research.
This ensures that more animals are
experimented on and money continues

to come in. In the meantime, those that
.-.ufTer from these and other diseases are
led to believe that continued use of ani
mals in research is necessary so that, if
they become ill, they have hope for a
cure; and if they survive, they have relief
and gratitude.
What you won't find in the text is a
warning that over 50 percent of drugs
in the past decade that have passed ani
mal tests were subsequently withdrawn
for adverse effects on humans. You
won't find the testaments of young
women suffering from vaginal cancer
because their mothers were prescribed
a drug that was proved "safe" on ani
mals, as battles in our nation's court-

rooms currently attest. You won't find
the eulogies of the grieving families
whose loved ones died after taking a
hepatitis drug this last summer that
cured dogs but killed people.
To these, and to thousands of others
like them, the researchers maxim that
"animal research saves lives" is not only
empty, but heartless.
Duh turns all of this into a joke. But
it is not funny.
I wonder if Duh and his readers are
laughing now.
