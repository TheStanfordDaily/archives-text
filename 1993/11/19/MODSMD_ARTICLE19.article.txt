# Emotional talk slows search for solutions to troubles of inner city
## 
### 
Regarding the Nov. 12 story about
Prof. Sylvia Wynter's speech in Roble
Hall, her talk of "lynching black people"
and fear of "Auschwitz happening in
America" is emotional hyperbole more
appropriate for third-world revolutionar
ies than Stanford professors. This kind
of rhetoric grossly distorts critically
important issues and impedes pursuit of
concrete solutions.
If she indeed blames pursuit of prof
it and the American business system
for the problems of black inner cities, I
gather that Prof. Wynter has been
reading Marx instead of the Harvard
Business Review. Current manage
ment theory holds that creating opti
mal work environments, empowering
employees and cultivating a serve-the
customer mentality — hardly exploita
tive strategies — are key elements of
profitability. Tested in the market
place, these attitudes have been very
successful for workers, companies and

the economy. Marx was tested in the
marketplace for 70 years and shown to
lead to social and economic disaster.
Much more insightful commentaries
by four blacks on the inner-city crisis
were presented on the "MacNeil/Lehrer
Hews Hour" Nov. 15. One of them, the
journalist Stanley Crouch, recalled that
during the 1950s black communities
enjoyed a level of civilization and safety
as high as anywhere in the world and
pointed out that the standards to
which blacks held themselves were far
higher than now. In 1959 under 10
percent of black women had children
out of wedlock, for example. Now the
inner-city figure is six times as high.
Two interviewees, Protestant minis
ters, spoke of the need for spiritual
renewal. In other words, a large part of
the problem lies within the black com
munity and individuals. Admitting this
does not absolve other elements of soci
ety from sharing responsibility.
All four interviewees agreed that only
holistic approaches could yield viable
solutions. Denial and wild accusations
cannot lead either to enlightenment or
improvement.
