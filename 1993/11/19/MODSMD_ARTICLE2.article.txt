# Sparks without a fire
## Beat Cal! Laser-light show, non-fire rally ignite Big Game spirit 
### Josh Green Staff writer 
A large crowd of cheering
Stanford students and alumni
watched Hoover Tower become
a movie screen for a spectacular
laser show at last night's non
fire Big Game rally. But only
those keen enough to know
when it started actually saw the
whole show.
Many were disappointed
after showing up at the Tanner
Fountain circle at 10 p.m., the
traditional starting time for pre

vious Big Game Bonfire rallies.
This year, the rally started at
about 9:15 p.m., immediately
after Gaieties finished.
Puzzled students who hadn't
gone to Gaieties milled around
the area afterward, wondering
why the rally was over before it
was supposed to start. Appar
ently, no starting time was given
on a flier distributed by the Axe
Committee, so many assumed
the starting time to be the same
as last year's.

Although some said the festivi
ties were too reminiscent of a high
school pep rally, reaction to the
event by those who did see it was
mostly positive.
"I really liked it, but a bonfire
would have been warmer," said
freshman Ross Evans. "The lights
were really spectacular, even phan
tasmagorical. I was excited to be a
part of it. But it was a little too stiff."
The traditional Big Game Bon
fire was canceled last month when
it was learned that the endangered

California tiger salamander inhab
ited Lake Lagunita's dry lake bed,
where the bonfire is usually held.
Last night's laser show consisted
of bright green lights projecting on
Hoover Tower, which was sur
rounded in red lights and artificial
fog. Various messages — including
"Beat Cal," "Cal Sucks," and a large
Stanford "S" complete with tree —
turned and twisted on the tower.
The rally kicked off with popu
lar former Band announcer Hal
Mickelson, Class of '71.
University President Gerhard
Casper, sporting Blockbuster Bowl
sweats and a patch over his eye,
then took to the stage set up in
front of Hoover Tower and

recounted a rather strange parable
about a bear he once saw in the
woods who ran from him. He held
up a picture to prove it. The moral
of the story was that the Cal Bears
would run from the Cardinal in
tomorrow's Big Game.
Afterwards, the crowd finally
came to life as they chanted the Axe
Cheer, screaming "Give 'em the
Axe! Where? Right in the neck!"
Football players and head coach
Bill Walsh were introduced as
their names flashed in green on
Hoover Tower and made short
speeches to rally the crowd.
Then, as tradition would have
it, Dollies danced on stage as the
Band played "All Right Now."

The rally ended without too
much fanfare at about 10 p.m.,
most people streaming out while
some were just showing up.
Steve Zika, chair of the Axe
Committee, said he thought the
rally was a success.
"We're going to try to have a
bonfire next year. But if we can't,
we'll just do this again. A new tra
dition may have been started
here."
Though he had no estimates on
the crowd, Zika said he was
pleased with the turnout for the
laser show, even if it wasn't quite
as large as that at last year's bon
fire. The crowd filled the entire cir
cle in front of Hoover Tower.
