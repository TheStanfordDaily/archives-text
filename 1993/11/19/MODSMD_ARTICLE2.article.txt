# Sparks without a fire
## Beat Cal! Laser-light show, non-fire rally ignite Big Game spirit 
### Josh Green Staff writer 
A large crowd of cheering
Stanford students and alumni
watched Hoover Tower become
a movie screen for a spectacular
laser show at last night's non
fire Big Game rally. But only
those keen enough to know
when it started actually saw the
whole show.
Many were disappointed
after showing up at the Tanner
Fountain circle at 10 p.m., the
traditional starting time for pre

vious Big Game Bonfire rallies.
This year, the rally started at
about 9:15 p.m., immediately
after Gaieties finished.
Puzzled students who hadn't
gone to Gaieties milled around
the area afterward, wondering
why the rally was over before it
was supposed to start. Appar
ently, no starting time was given
on a flier distributed by the Axe
Committee, so many assumed
the starting time to be the same
as last year's.



Stanford begins
a new Big Game
tradition as the
Tree and the
Band rock in
front of Hoover
Tower last
night. Lake
Lag's salaman
ders were
spared by a
laser-light show
that illuminated
the night sky.
