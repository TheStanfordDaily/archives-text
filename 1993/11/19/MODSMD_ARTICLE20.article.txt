# Daily and University ignore report of salary inequity based on race
## 
### 
It is commendable that The Daily is
giving attention to the report regarding
the problems facing women on the facul
ty at Stanford. On the other hand, Daily
reporters have completely ignored or not
given comparable attention to reports on
salary inequity based on race for staff of
color (and women) here, as the Campus
Report has rightfully done. Neverthe
less, it is somewhat comforting that stu
dents at other universities are a bit more
concerned about staff at their respective
institutions.
There are similarities between the
two unfortunate women faculty and
staff of color episodes. Many staff of
color are also working in unfriendly
environments at Stanford (and there is
still no policy against racial harassment
for staff in the University's Administra
tive Guide). And certain officers of the
University are attempting to ignore or
dispute the institution's own report on
salary equity based on race.

Finally, I am not impressed with
Stanford's own version of Senator Pack
wood, who threatens to release the
unabridged report. This is truly a great
exhibition of scholarly research and dis
semination of knowledge, but what do
you you expect from Hoover?
