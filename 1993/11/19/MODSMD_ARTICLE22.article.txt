## Putting Slip 'N' Slides behind for Olympic-pool city 
### 
Someday my prince will come. I've
spent my entire existence waiting for
lady luck to pat me on the butt and
call me up to the big leagues. My whole
life shooting for modest goals. My most
extravagant wish a cherry-red, jacked-up
Toyota 4x4 with an extra cab and a sliding
back window. No Deloreans. No Lam
bourghinis. No Nitro-burning, engine
revving, asphalt-scorching funny cars.
Justification for higher education.
My playing time on this earth has been
good. Enjoyable, content years spent wal
lowing in the mire of middle-classdom.
Happy, oblivious days of game shows and
Hoover vacuums — Dad at work and
Mom conquering the PTA harlots. It
wasn't Dallas, but who was I to complain.
Back when I was just a Who back in Who
ville, dear old Dad used to pat me gently on
the head whenever I asked why we didn't
have a VCR, a microwave, one of those
Debbie Gibson crimping irons to make my
hair look like rare forms of pasta.
"Delayed gratification is the plight of
the middle class, my fuzzy-crested lap sit
ter," he would console, turning back to

help me as I agonized over the Sunday
crossword puzzle.
Thanks, I needed that.
It was true. All true. We were right
above Velveeta, right below Beluga. Social
members at the golf club, but not full
fledged golf-cart packing, stogey-sucking
old money. The Slip 'N' Slide kids —
envied by their hose-wielding buddies but
in awe of the pool and hot-tub-taunting
lucky-ducks.
We didn't do the nouveau riche thing
like the neighbors. They bought their kids
Teddy Ruxpins so they didn't have to take
time out of their mountain-biking sched
ules. I sat down with their kids like my
mom sat down with me a few years before
and taught them to read. They were the
young and the restless. We were the smart
and the well-adjusted.
Thank you sir, may I have another?
But there's more separating us from
them then our sucker-punched tax brack
et. It's their living-large attitude. The con
spicuous consumption. The idea that
tomorrow is another day, another million
dollars so why not kick butt and take

social security numbers today.
A different breed of people who go 75
mph through speed traps because they
know god's given them a special immunity
to life's basic annoyances. People who can
flip their pens over their thumbs without
shooting them across the room. People
who get the big jobs, because they force
destiny to give them their due.
Cough it up.
I've never had that stuff. I consider
myself lucky for everything I get, every
achievement that falls my way. Yeah, I've
won stuff. Yeah, I got better grades than
the slut-o-ramas back in high school.
Yeah, I go to Stanford. But I thank my
Lucky Charms I had a lap for it to fall in.
I need to assume a resume-packer ego.
A change of pace. A vicious streak to fill
my sails and speed me across the seas of
the mismatched linen blazer and skirt to
the Bermuda triangle of the red Chanel
suit I've embarrassedly flipped past in
magazines so many times, not wanting to
overstep my spot on the food chain.
Will that be cash or charge?
I've spent enough years as a medium

sized fish in a big pond. It's marlin time,
baby. Time to kick this "first-generation
not-to-live-better-than-their-parents"
bandini and go for the gold card. I want
more. I want it all. Bring on the rat race.
Give me the fast track. I'm a contender, I
can go all 15 rounds. Give me the time and
the place and I'll beat any chump Don
King throws my way.
The cham-peen of the world.
Small elves have been whispering in my
ears lately. Don't settle back on your heels,
little one. Throw humility to the wind —
go forth into the world with godspeed and
make it your own.
Stop holding back references to Freud
in small seminar classes. Stop assuming
your professors don't want to get near
your chronic halitosis to give you a gleam
ing personal recommendation. Stop refus
ing to demand your $25,000 worth.
Can I have that to go?
Until now, I always assumed there was
someone out there who could better use
the oxygen I was taking up on this Earth.
Someone who'd have a more intense, reve
lational talk in the Coffee House booth I

was occupying. Someone who would be
receiving sound-barrier-busting love let
ters in my P.O. Box, if only I wasn't wast
ing the space. Someone who would be
doing Nobel-prizeworthy research if only
my student I.D. had their name on it.
But finally my yellow brick road has led
me to the Emerald City and somewhat
obvious personal revelations. I have just as
good a shot at the title as anyone. I have
the skills to pay the bills, all that's missing
is the drive. The will. The desire.
When I grew up I was gonna be the
president of the United States, but some
where along the line I sold that dream out
for an American car and a two-story stuc
coed house in the Pacific Northwest.
Madison Avenue nixed, Beverly Hills bye
bye, my chateau in Switzerland, kaput.
But I can feel it coming back. It's rising
again. The time has come to go for
baroque.
Don't touch that dial.

Someday my prince will come. I've
spent my entire existence waiting for

not-to-live-better-than-their-parents"
bandini and go for the gold card. I want
more. I want it all. Bring on the rat race.
Give me the fast track. I'm a contender, I
can go all 15 rounds. Give me the time and
the place and I'll beat any chump Don
King throws my way.
The cham-peen of the world.
Small elves have been whispering in my
ears lately. Don't settle back on your heels,
little one. Throw humility to the wind —
go forth into the world with godspeed and
make it your own.
Stop holding back references to Freud
in small seminar classes. Stop assuming
your professors don't want to get near
your chronic halitosis to give you a gleam
ing personal recommendation. Stop refus
ing to demand your $25,000 worth.
Can I have that to go?
Until now, I always assumed there was
someone out there who could better use
the oxygen I was taking up on this Earth.
Someone who'd have a more intense, reve
lational talk in the Coffee House booth I

was occupying. Someone who would be
receiving sound-barrier-busting love let
ters in my P.O. Box, if only I wasn't wast
ing the space. Someone who would be
doing Nobel-prizeworthy research if only
my student I.D. had their name on it.
But finally my yellow brick road has led
me to the Emerald City and somewhat
obvious personal revelations. I have just as
good a shot at the title as anyone. I have
the skills to pay the bills, all that's missing
is the drive. The will. The desire.
When I grew up I was gonna be the
president of the United States, but some
where along the line I sold that dream out
for an American car and a two-story stuc
coed house in the Pacific Northwest.
Madison Avenue nixed, Beverly Hills bye
bye, my chateau in Switzerland, kaput.
But I can feel it coming back. It's rising
again. The time has come to go for
baroque.
Don't touch that dial.

Someday my prince will come. I've
spent my entire existence waiting for
lady luck to pat me on the butt and
call me up to the big leagues. My whole
life shooting for modest goals. My most
extravagant wish a cherry-red, jacked-up
Toyota 4x4 with an extra cab and a sliding
back window. No Deloreans. No Lam
bourghinis. No Nitro-burning, engine
revving, asphalt-scorching funny cars.
Justification for higher education.
My playing time on this earth has been
good. Enjoyable, content years spent wal
lowing in the mire of middle-classdom.
Happy, oblivious days of game shows and
Hoover vacuums — Dad at work and
Mom conquering the PTA harlots. It
wasn't Dallas, but who was I to complain.
Back when I was just a Who back in Who
ville, dear old Dad used to pat me gently on
the head whenever I asked why we didn't
have a VCR, a microwave, one of those
Debbie Gibson crimping irons to make my
hair look like rare forms of pasta.
"Delayed gratification is the plight of
the middle class, my fuzzy-crested lap sit
ter," he would console, turning back to

help me as I agonized over the Sunday
crossword puzzle.
Thanks, I needed that.
It was true. All true. We were right
above Velveeta, right below Beluga. Social
members at the golf club, but not full
fledged golf-cart packing, stogey-sucking
old money. The Slip 'N' Slide kids —
envied by their hose-wielding buddies but
in awe of the pool and hot-tub-taunting
lucky-ducks.
We didn't do the nouveau riche thing
like the neighbors. They bought their kids
Teddy Ruxpins so they didn't have to take
time out of their mountain-biking sched
ules. I sat down with their kids like my
mom sat down with me a few years before
and taught them to read. They were the
young and the restless. We were the smart
and the well-adjusted.
Thank you sir, may I have another?
But there's more separating us from
them then our sucker-punched tax brack
et. It's their living-large attitude. The con
spicuous consumption. The idea that
tomorrow is another day, another million
dollars so why not kick butt and take

social security numbers today.
A different breed of people who go 75
mph through speed traps because they
know god's given them a special immunity
to life's basic annoyances. People who can
flip their pens over their thumbs without
shooting them across the room. People
who get the big jobs, because they force
destiny to give them their due.
Cough it up.
I've never had that stuff. I consider
myself lucky for everything I get, every
achievement that falls my way. Yeah, I've
won stuff. Yeah, I got better grades than
the slut-o-ramas back in high school.
Yeah, I go to Stanford. But I thank my
Lucky Charms I had a lap for it to fall in.
I need to assume a resume-packer ego.
A change of pace. A vicious streak to fill
my sails and speed me across the seas of
the mismatched linen blazer and skirt to
the Bermuda triangle of the red Chanel
suit I've embarrassedly flipped past in
magazines so many times, not wanting to
overstep my spot on the food chain.
Will that be cash or charge?
I've spent enough years as a medium

sized fish in a big pond. It's marlin time,
baby. Time to kick this "first-generation
not-to-live-better-than-their-parents"
