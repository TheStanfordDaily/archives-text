Firmly believing that talent ultimately offsets the
inexperience of youth, the Stanford wrestling team has
set its sights high this year â€” as high as the NCAA top
10.
The Cardinal will test this philosophy tonight in a
dual meet at UC-Davis. The meet starts at 7:30 p.m.
The team finished eighth in the Pacific 10 Conference
last year with a dual meet record of 3-6. In NCAA Cham
pionships the team finished 64th, carried by then-fresh
man Jimmy Aguirre and then-junior Lance Johnson,
wrestling at 134 and 142 pounds, respectively.
Aguirre and Johnson return this year, only both have
moved up a weight division to free a spot for junior Jay
Jackson at 134 pounds. Add freshman Scott Chapman
(158), a three-time California state champion, to the pic

"We have a minimum of four outstanding wrestlers
that could take us to the top," said head coach Chris
Horpel, entering his 15th year with the Cardinal. "Bar
ring further injuries, we're going to look great."
Injuries have had a significant impact on the team.
Several starters have been hurt in the preseason, most
recently sophomore Ed Medina, who dislocated his
elbow in practice last Thursday. Roger Liu and Tod Sur

Despite these early setbacks, the team looks opti
mistically to the future. Horpel believes that strong lead
ership is a distinctive characteristic of this year's team.
