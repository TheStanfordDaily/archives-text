## The 						season begins Wrestlers to meet Aggies 
### Allyson Mizoguchi 
Firmly believing that talent ultimately offsets the
inexperience of youth, the Stanford wrestling team has
set its sights high this year — as high as the NCAA top
10.
The Cardinal will test this philosophy tonight in a
dual meet at UC-Davis. The meet starts at 7:30 p.m.
The team finished eighth in the Pacific 10 Conference
last year with a dual meet record of 3-6. In NCAA Cham
pionships the team finished 64th, carried by then-fresh
man Jimmy Aguirre and then-junior Lance Johnson,
wrestling at 134 and 142 pounds, respectively.
Aguirre and Johnson return this year, only both have
moved up a weight division to free a spot for junior Jay
Jackson at 134 pounds. Add freshman Scott Chapman
(158), a three-time California state champion, to the pic
ture, and the year looks like a bright one.
"We have a minimum of four outstanding wrestlers
that could take us to the top," said head coach Chris
Horpel, entering his 15th year with the Cardinal. "Bar
ring further injuries, we're going to look great."
Injuries have had a significant impact on the team.
Several starters have been hurt in the preseason, most
recently sophomore Ed Medina, who dislocated his
elbow in practice last Thursday. Roger Liu and Tod Sur
mon are also recovering from injuries and will most like
ly be out for a few weeks.
Despite these early setbacks, the team looks opti
mistically to the future. Horpel believes that strong lead
ership is a distinctive characteristic of this year's team.
Co-captains Jackson and Johnson view the team's
talent and improvement since last
year as sure indicators of success.
"Everybody who did well is
returning," Johnson said. "We've
upped our intensity and we'll be
better this year."
"This is the best team we've
had in a while. We'll definitely be
competitive," Jackson added,
Between 134 and 158 pounds,
the team is exceptionally strong.
Horpel believes that all four
starters in these divisions are
potential All-Americans (the top
eight in the NCAA): Johnson
(150), who has placed in the top
six every year in the Pac-10;
Jackson (134), who placed
fourth in the Pac-10 last year;
Chapman (158); and Aguirre
(142), who Horpel says "without
question" will be successful this
year.

However, other weights do not
share this depth, which Horpel
sees as a major weakness. The
team is especially thin at the lower
weights and at the heavyweight
division.
"It is difficult to have a
wrestling team strong at every
division. We're close, but not quite
there yet," Horpel said.
Inexperience is a concern as
well. Of the 10 starters, only Jack
son and Johnson are upperclass
men. Horpel, however, does not
view this as a major downfall.
"They'll take their licks, but
they'll respond positively and
make some great progress," he
said.
Remaining starters are tenta
tively freshman By Pham (118),
sophomore Matt Cano (126),
freshman Ryan Barnes (167),
sophomore Mark Ryzewicz
(177), freshman Bryan Vaniman
(190) and freshman Chris Ser
jack in the heavyweight divi
sion.
