# The
						Cardinal wins second Trojan War
## Stanford spikers sweep USC, secure second place in Pac-10 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
The victors of what coach Don
Shaw called "the most important
match of the season," the Stan
ford women's volleyball team
swept No. 13 USC last night in
Maples Pavilion to secure second
place in the Pacific 10 Conference.
The sixth-ranked Cardinal (18-
8, 10-7 in the Pac-10) took
revenge on USC (18-8, 10-7 in the
Pac-10) for an early season defeat
by pounding the Trojans to secure
the match by a score of 15-12, 15-
9, 15-8. The victory is likely to
secure a top-four Western Region
ranking for the Stanford, as well
as a first-round bye in the NCAA
tournament.
"I thought that we played real
ly well," said sophomore Marnie
Triefenbach. "We went into this
weekend knowing that this was
our most important game. We
knew that we could beat them and
just needed to come out and have
fun — I think that we did that."
Matched up against the fourth
place USC squad, Stanford's
attack managed to stay a half step
ahead of the Trojans and pulled
out three victories. By no stretch,

however, were the wins guaran
teed, as each team sided out many
times, only to give up the serve on
the next play.
"This is a team which is going
to make their plays, they're going
to get their kills, especially
(Missy) McCaw and (Katie)
Haller, they're great players,"
Shaw said. "We just needed to
keep plugging away and keep sid
ing out. We took advantage of
point-scoring opportunities when
we had them. Even though there
were times when we didn't get
any for a while, I thought we were
very steady."
While the Cardinal started out
slowly in game one, sophomore
outside hitter Gary Wendell pro
vided the impetus Stanford need
ed to jump ahead.
Battling back from a 8-5
deficit, the Cardinal's balanced
offensive attack came through to
even the score at 10-10. At that
point Stanford pushed out ahead
of the Trojans, when sophomore
Wendy Hromadka reached for the
solo block against USC hitter
Meika Wagner to secure the cru
cial first game.
