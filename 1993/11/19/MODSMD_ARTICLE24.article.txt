# The 						Cardinal wins second Trojan War
## Stanford spikers sweep USC, secure second place in Pac-10 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
The victors of what coach Don
Shaw called "the most important
match of the season," the Stan
ford women's volleyball team
swept No. 13 USC last night in
Maples Pavilion to secure second
place in the Pacific 10 Conference.
The sixth-ranked Cardinal (18-
8, 10-7 in the Pac-10) took
revenge on USC (18-8, 10-7 in the
Pac-10) for an early season defeat
by pounding the Trojans to secure
the match by a score of 15-12, 15-
9, 15-8. The victory is likely to
secure a top-four Western Region
ranking for the Stanford, as well
as a first-round bye in the NCAA
tournament.
"I thought that we played real
ly well," said sophomore Marnie
Triefenbach. "We went into this
weekend knowing that this was
our most important game. We
knew that we could beat them and
just needed to come out and have
fun — I think that we did that."
Matched up against the fourth
place USC squad, Stanford's
attack managed to stay a half step
ahead of the Trojans and pulled
out three victories. By no stretch,

however, were the wins guaran
teed, as each team sided out many
times, only to give up the serve on
the next play.
"This is a team which is going
to make their plays, they're going
to get their kills, especially
(Missy) McCaw and (Katie)
Haller, they're great players,"
Shaw said. "We just needed to
keep plugging away and keep sid
ing out. We took advantage of
point-scoring opportunities when
we had them. Even though there
were times when we didn't get
any for a while, I thought we were
very steady."
While the Cardinal started out
slowly in game one, sophomore
outside hitter Gary Wendell pro
vided the impetus Stanford need
ed to jump ahead.
Battling back from a 8-5
deficit, the Cardinal's balanced
offensive attack came through to
even the score at 10-10. At that
point Stanford pushed out ahead
of the Trojans, when sophomore
Wendy Hromadka reached for the
solo block against USC hitter
Meika Wagner to secure the cru
cial first game.

three-game demolition of USC last night.
"Our offense was pretty con
sistent all the way around,"
Triefenbach said. "There wasn't
just one person who was putting
balls away; it was a whole bunch
of different people. They didn't
know who to camp on, because
they didn't have one person to
focus on which makes it
tougher."
Battling through an equally
close second game, the Cardinal
eventually punched enough
holes in the Trojan's front line
to slam down the kills needed
for a 10-6 lead. After junior mid
dle blocker Anne Wicks powered
the Stanford offense with a
cross-court smash, the Cardinal
stayed out of reach for the rest
of the contest.
"I think we played well
together, everything seemed to

click," said junior Denise Rotert.
"Our blocking was pretty good,
and we were hitting the right
spots of the court. Being really
scrappy was another key, we
were able to pick up a lot of balls
that had gone down — everyone
was really going for it."
Riding a wave of momentum,
the Trojans surged to a 7-1 lead
at the beginning of game three
— challenging the Cardinal to
dig itself out of the hole. Stan
ford proved up to the task, as it
ran off 10 straight points for the
11-7 lead. After four separate
attempts at match point, sopho
more Cary Wendell finally
swung for the winning kill.
Wendell led the Cardinal
effort both offensively with 20
kills for a .469 hitting percent
age and also spearheaded the
defensive effort with a season
high 22 digs. Triefenbach and
Hromadka also boosted the
offensive surge with 14 kills
apiece.

cial first game.


Curtis Chen — Daily
Sophomore Wendy Hromadka bumps to set up a Cardinal spike in Stanford's
three-game demolition of USC last night.
"Our offense was pretty con
sistent all the way around,"
Triefenbach said. "There wasn't
just one person who was putting
balls away; it was a whole bunch
of different people. They didn't
know who to camp on, because
they didn't have one person to
focus on which makes it
tougher."
Battling through an equally
close second game, the Cardinal
eventually punched enough
holes in the Trojan's front line
to slam down the kills needed
for a 10-6 lead. After junior mid
dle blocker Anne Wicks powered
the Stanford offense with a
cross-court smash, the Cardinal
stayed out of reach for the rest
of the contest.
"I think we played well
together, everything seemed to

click," said junior Denise Rotert.
"Our blocking was pretty good,
and we were hitting the right
spots of the court. Being really
scrappy was another key, we
were able to pick up a lot of balls
that had gone down — everyone
was really going for it."
Riding a wave of momentum,
the Trojans surged to a 7-1 lead
at the beginning of game three
— challenging the Cardinal to
dig itself out of the hole. Stan
ford proved up to the task, as it
ran off 10 straight points for the
11-7 lead. After four separate
attempts at match point, sopho
more Cary Wendell finally
swung for the winning kill.
Wendell led the Cardinal
effort both offensively with 20
kills for a .469 hitting percent
age and also spearheaded the
defensive effort with a season
high 22 digs. Triefenbach and
Hromadka also boosted the
offensive surge with 14 kills
apiece.
