# Armed and dangerous
## Stanford's Stenstrom a lethal weapon 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
As Pacific 10 Conference and Stanford
school passing records continue to fall
with every stretch of his arm, Cardinal
quarterback Steve Stenstrom is content,
but not satisfied.
"I'm pretty much a perfectionist,"
Stenstrom said. "I keep working on things
until I get it right. That's why I keep ask
ing the coaches what I need to improve on
so I can refine my skills more and more."
For opposing coaches, that's a fright
ening thought. Stenstrom currently
ranks first in the Pac-10 and sixth nation
ally in total offense, averaging 307 yards
per game. He has 3,281 yards passing this
season — a new Pac-10 record — and
could set new league marks in season
total offense and season touchdown pass
es on Saturday in the Big Game. Plus,
because he redshirted in his freshman
year, he still has another year of elegibili
ty left.
"Steve is a guy that's improved, and
last year I thought he was a great player,"
said California head coach Keith Gilbert
son, whose team faces Stenstrom this
week. "He's a huge weapon."
And that weapon is loaded. Last week
against Oregon, the senior signalcaller

completed 76 percent of his passes in
throwing for a career-best 407 yards. In
one stretch, he connected on 16 consecu
tive passes against the Ducks.
"It was like clockwork," said Stanford
offensive coordinator Terry Shea of Sten
strom's performance. "He's so accurate
and he throws such a catchable ball that it
didn't matter who we put in at the wide
receiver position."
"He puts it right on you," said receiver
Justin Armour. "Whoever is out there
with Steve is fortunate because he makes
our job easier."
Part of the reason for Stenstrom's suc
cess has been the play of the offensive
line. In contrast to last season, Stenstrom
has not been rushed in the pocket, and as
a result has been more deliberate with his
passes.
"I've been able to get set, and it's been
nice to step into some throws," Stenstrom
said. "I've been able to look at second and
third receivers. I feel very comfortable
with the (offensive) system."
"Now that he knows the system, he is
able concentrate on the things that distin
guish himself as a quarterback," Armour
said. "He has time to pick out the right
receivers."
At the same time, Stenstrom has
had to contend with a suspect run
ning game and a youthful defense,
placing a large burden on his shoul
ders. Yet he still posts impessive
numbers even though opposing
defenses know that Stanford lives
or dies by the pass.
"If you consider our competition
and his supporting cast, he's the
best passer in college football," said
Stanford head coach Bill Walsh.
"He's gotten his yardage the hard
way."
Along with that yardage has come
recognition — and talk of the NFL
draft. After two-and-a-half seasons
as Stanford's starting quarterback
and with his name etched in the Car
dinal record book, is Stenstrom
ready to proceed to the next level?
"It has to be an option for me,"
Stenstrom said of the draft. "The

fact that it's even a thought in my
head means I guess I have to spend
some time worrying about it. It's a
win-win situation, but I don't want
to ever question my decision."
Walsh, who has seen his share of
NFL quarterbacks, has high praise
for his current protege.
"In my mind, he's ahead of at
least two-thirds of the NFL quar
terbacks as to his knowledge, his
mechanics, his decision-making,
and his command of the game."
But while professional scouts
loom, Stenstrom emphasizes that
he still has much to accomplish on
The Farm.
"I want to come back and play in
the Rose Bowl," Stenstrom said.
"The nucleus of the team is coming
back. We have a chance to do some
really big things next year, and I
want to be a part of that."
But first, the El Toro, Calif.,
native is faced with the challenge of
engineering his third consecutive
Big Game victory.
Golden Bears beware.
