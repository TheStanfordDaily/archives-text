# Armed and dangerous
## Stanford's Stenstrom a lethal weapon 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
As Pacific 10 Conference and Stanford
school passing records continue to fall
with every stretch of his arm, Cardinal
quarterback Steve Stenstrom is content,
but not satisfied.
"I'm pretty much a perfectionist,"
Stenstrom said. "I keep working on things
until I get it right. That's why I keep ask
ing the coaches what I need to improve on
so I can refine my skills more and more."
For opposing coaches, that's a fright
ening thought. Stenstrom currently
ranks first in the Pac-10 and sixth nation
ally in total offense, averaging 307 yards
per game. He has 3,281 yards passing this
season — a new Pac-10 record — and
could set new league marks in season
total offense and season touchdown pass
es on Saturday in the Big Game. Plus,
because he redshirted in his freshman
year, he still has another year of elegibili
ty left.
"Steve is a guy that's improved, and
last year I thought he was a great player,"
said California head coach Keith Gilbert
son, whose team faces Stenstrom this
week. "He's a huge weapon."
And that weapon is loaded. Last week
against Oregon, the senior signalcaller

completed 76 percent of his passes in
throwing for a career-best 407 yards. In
one stretch, he connected on 16 consecu
tive passes against the Ducks.
"It was like clockwork," said Stanford
offensive coordinator Terry Shea of Sten
strom's performance. "He's so accurate
and he throws such a catchable ball that it
didn't matter who we put in at the wide
receiver position."
"He puts it right on you," said receiver
Justin Armour. "Whoever is out there
with Steve is fortunate because he makes
our job easier."
Part of the reason for Stenstrom's suc
cess has been the play of the offensive
line. In contrast to last season, Stenstrom
has not been rushed in the pocket, and as
a result has been more deliberate with his
passes.
"I've been able to get set, and it's been
nice to step into some throws," Stenstrom
said. "I've been able to look at second and
third receivers. I feel very comfortable
with the (offensive) system."
"Now that he knows the system, he is
able concentrate on the things that distin
guish himself as a quarterback," Armour
said. "He has time to pick out the right
receivers."
