# The 						Hellenic Age ends: Big Game and the Last Axe Hero
## 
### 
Greeks may come and Greeks
may go, but one thing remains
the same — Beat Cal. No, seri
ously, we Greeks always love a
good tragedy. From Sophocles to
Euripides to Aristophanes, we
appreciate heroes that capitulate
under the weight of their own
hubris, only to learn fundamental
truths about their existence in
cathartic final scenes. Leave the
humor to Ross Perot and the
South San Francisco Police
Department, we say.
Which brings us to my teensie
Weenie (I mean weensie) place in
the Grand Scheme of Things —
or at least on the sports page of
The Daily. I swaggered into my
penultimate struggle of this little
exercise last week, carrying a
two-game lead and the weight of
the reading world on my shoul
ders. Pitted against University
Bursar Jon Erickson, I felt con
tent that I would salt this puppy
away before Big Game Week.
Boy, was I wrong. After the
bursar gave me an Oedipus com
plex by robbing me blind (he com
piled a 5-2 mark to my 3-4) my
tragic demise is just heating up
My guests and I stand tied at 27-
31 overall, leaving me with one

last chance to lend some credibil
ity to this gig before leaving for
the hard courts of women's
hoops.
So now I present the Hoote
nanny in Hamburg, the Brouha
ha in Berlin, the Melee in
Munich, the Donnybrook in Dres
den, the Free-for-all in Frankfurt
— that's right, yours truly versus
University President/Axe Hero
Gerhard Casper. In keeping with
Greek tradition, Casper is the
final hurdle in my race to
respectability. I respect his abili
ty, but if you think I'm going to
let him win, you're berserk.
With lines from Tuesday's
USA Today, home teams in CAPS
and some divine inspiration from
Zeus, then, let's spin this tune
one last time:
GOOD GUYS -2-1/2 vs. Weenies
Andy: Who do you think? -2-1/2.
In the immortal words of J.J.
Lasley, "Beat (sic) Cal. Beat (sic)
Cal. Cal? Beat (sic) 'em." Make it
a lucky seven AXE-ellent years
for the Cardinal.
Axe Hero: Stanford -—2-1/2. "I
pick Stanford because I believe it
and I have no choice," Casper
said. I think our "fearless" leader

should take confidence lessons
from Lasley.
use -2-1/2 vs. Ucla
Andy: Fight on -2-1/2. The Rose
Bowl is on the line, John Robin
son is up to his old tricks and Rob

Johnson and Johnnie Morton
have given the Trojans an alter
native to their bread-and-butter
"student body" arsenal. Transla
tion: US"C"you in Pasadena.
Axe Hero. USC -2-1/2. While
wisely selecting the Trojans,
Casper lamented the historic lack
of parity in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. "The Rose Bowl should be
reserved for non-L.A. teams," he
said. I say put the Weenies in liOS
Angeles, take the Men of Troy out
and you have a pretty good theory
going.

WASHINGTON -9 vs. Wash
ington State
Andy: Dawgs —9. Everything
here reeks of revenge (or is that
the Huskies' mascot I smell?).
Looking to finish their first year
of probation on a positive note,

the Purple and Gold take the
Apple Cup pretty seriously and
will vent their stockpiled frustra
tions on the archrival Cougars.
Axe Hero: Washington State +9.
"Just for the fun of it," Casper
said. Isn't that what Ix>rena Bob
bitt thought?
OREGON -9-1/2 vs. Oregon
State
Andy: Oregon -9-1/2. Playing
for nothing more than the pride
of the Spotted Owl State, the fair
ly mediocre Fighting Ducks

should prevent the still-very
mediocre Beavers from having
any delusions of grandeur about
their 1993 campaign.
Axe Hero: Oregon -9-1/2.
Casper had no comment here;
like the Übermensch he is, he just
went with common sense.
MICHIGAN -1 vs. Ohio State
Andy: Ohio State +1. Even the
Wolverines at home can't prevent
a return to the days of old —
Buckeyes and Trojans on New
Year's Day. Bring back Woody
Hayes!
Axe Hero: Ohio State +1. For no
apparent reason, Casper said,
"I'd like to see Ohio State in the
Rose Bowl." Could it be because
they are the best team in the Big
10 Conference?
Miami -5-1/2 vs. WEST VIR
GINIA
Andy: Miami -5-1/2. It's been a
great run, Mountaineers, but
Miami is about to show the
nation how Hurricanes can strike
in the Appalachians.
Axe Hero: Miami -5-1/2. "Even I
can pick that," the President
said. Could it be that Casper had
a friendly ghost make his other

picks? I asked politely, but got
neither a confirmation nor a
denial. If only he were eligible to
run for the White House. . . .
AUBURN -1-1/2 vs. Alabama
Andy: Auburn -1-1/2. Give me
an inspired, probation-driven
Tigers team at home over an
overrated Crimson Tide squad
with nothing to gain any day.
Axe Hero: Alabama +1-1/2. Obvi
ously still in need of United
States geography lessons, Casper
picked the Tide because "my
provost [Condoleezza Rice I was
born in Alabama." Hey, Gerhard,
pardon my interruption, but
Auburn is in Alabama too.
DENVER —3 vs. Pittsburgh
Andy: Pittsburgh +3. Last week, I
got burned both picking the Bron
cos and going against the Steelers.
So this should be a slam-dunk
pick — now watch me lose again.
Gerhard: Denver —3. "They have
a quarterback from Stanford,"
Casper said. That's right, Ger
hard, and so does — let me see
here — oh, veah, Stanford
1 hat s all, folks, and remember:
BEAT CALM


Andy
Eiser


Gerhard
Casper


Burt Herman — Daily file
Quarterback Steve Stenstrom scrambles out of the pocket. Stenstrom has been on the run all season, streaking past Cardinal
legends on his way to gridiron immortality on the Farm.

may go, but one thing remains
the same — Beat Cal. No, seri

AUBURN -1-1/2 vs. Alabama
Andy: Auburn -1-1/2. Give me
an inspired, probation-driven
Tigers team at home over an
overrated Crimson Tide squad
with nothing to gain any day.
Axe Hero: Alabama +1-1/2. Obvi
ously still in need of United
States geography lessons, Casper
picked the Tide because "my
provost [Condoleezza Rice I was
born in Alabama." Hey, Gerhard,
pardon my interruption, but
Auburn is in Alabama too.
DENVER —3 vs. Pittsburgh
Andy: Pittsburgh +3. Last week, I
got burned both picking the Bron
cos and going against the Steelers.
So this should be a slam-dunk
pick — now watch me lose again.
Gerhard: Denver —3. "They have
a quarterback from Stanford,"
Casper said. That's right, Ger
hard, and so does — let me see
here — oh, veah, Stanford
1 hat s all, folks, and remember:
BEAT CALM


Andy
Eiser


Gerhard
Casper


Burt Herman — Daily file
Quarterback Steve Stenstrom scrambles out of the pocket. Stenstrom has been on the run all season, streaking past Cardinal
legends on his way to gridiron immortality on the Farm.
Greeks may come and Greeks
may go, but one thing remains
the same — Beat Cal. No, seri
ously, we Greeks always love a
good tragedy. From Sophocles to
Euripides to Aristophanes, we
appreciate heroes that capitulate
under the weight of their own
hubris, only to learn fundamental
truths about their existence in
cathartic final scenes. Leave the
humor to Ross Perot and the
South San Francisco Police
Department, we say.
Which brings us to my teensie
Weenie (I mean weensie) place in
the Grand Scheme of Things —
or at least on the sports page of
The Daily. I swaggered into my
penultimate struggle of this little
exercise last week, carrying a
two-game lead and the weight of
the reading world on my shoul
ders. Pitted against University
Bursar Jon Erickson, I felt con
tent that I would salt this puppy
away before Big Game Week.
Boy, was I wrong. After the
bursar gave me an Oedipus com
plex by robbing me blind (he com
piled a 5-2 mark to my 3-4) my
tragic demise is just heating up
My guests and I stand tied at 27-
31 overall, leaving me with one

last chance to lend some credibil
ity to this gig before leaving for
the hard courts of women's
hoops.
So now I present the Hoote
nanny in Hamburg, the Brouha
ha in Berlin, the Melee in
Munich, the Donnybrook in Dres
den, the Free-for-all in Frankfurt
— that's right, yours truly versus
University President/Axe Hero
Gerhard Casper. In keeping with
Greek tradition, Casper is the
final hurdle in my race to
respectability. I respect his abili
ty, but if you think I'm going to
let him win, you're berserk.
With lines from Tuesday's
USA Today, home teams in CAPS
and some divine inspiration from
Zeus, then, let's spin this tune
one last time:
GOOD GUYS -2-1/2 vs. Weenies
Andy: Who do you think? -2-1/2.
In the immortal words of J.J.
Lasley, "Beat (sic) Cal. Beat (sic)
Cal. Cal? Beat (sic) 'em." Make it
a lucky seven AXE-ellent years
for the Cardinal.
Axe Hero: Stanford -—2-1/2. "I
pick Stanford because I believe it
and I have no choice," Casper
said. I think our "fearless" leader

should take confidence lessons
from Lasley.
use -2-1/2 vs. Ucla
Andy: Fight on -2-1/2. The Rose
Bowl is on the line, John Robin
son is up to his old tricks and Rob

Johnson and Johnnie Morton
have given the Trojans an alter
native to their bread-and-butter
"student body" arsenal. Transla
tion: US"C"you in Pasadena.
Axe Hero. USC -2-1/2. While
wisely selecting the Trojans,
Casper lamented the historic lack
of parity in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence. "The Rose Bowl should be
reserved for non-L.A. teams," he
said. I say put the Weenies in liOS
Angeles, take the Men of Troy out
and you have a pretty good theory
going.

WASHINGTON -9 vs. Wash
ington State
Andy: Dawgs —9. Everything
here reeks of revenge (or is that
the Huskies' mascot I smell?).
Looking to finish their first year
of probation on a positive note,

the Purple and Gold take the
Apple Cup pretty seriously and
will vent their stockpiled frustra
tions on the archrival Cougars.
Axe Hero: Washington State +9.
"Just for the fun of it," Casper
said. Isn't that what Ix>rena Bob
bitt thought?
OREGON -9-1/2 vs. Oregon
State
Andy: Oregon -9-1/2. Playing
for nothing more than the pride
of the Spotted Owl State, the fair
ly mediocre Fighting Ducks

should prevent the still-very
mediocre Beavers from having
any delusions of grandeur about
their 1993 campaign.
Axe Hero: Oregon -9-1/2.
Casper had no comment here;
like the Übermensch he is, he just
went with common sense.
MICHIGAN -1 vs. Ohio State
Andy: Ohio State +1. Even the
Wolverines at home can't prevent
a return to the days of old —
Buckeyes and Trojans on New
Year's Day. Bring back Woody
Hayes!
Axe Hero: Ohio State +1. For no
apparent reason, Casper said,
"I'd like to see Ohio State in the
Rose Bowl." Could it be because
they are the best team in the Big
10 Conference?
Miami -5-1/2 vs. WEST VIR
GINIA
Andy: Miami -5-1/2. It's been a
great run, Mountaineers, but
Miami is about to show the
nation how Hurricanes can strike
in the Appalachians.
Axe Hero: Miami -5-1/2. "Even I
can pick that," the President
said. Could it be that Casper had
a friendly ghost make his other

picks? I asked politely, but got
neither a confirmation nor a
denial. If only he were eligible to
run for the White House. . . .
AUBURN -1-1/2 vs. Alabama
Andy: Auburn -1-1/2. Give me
an inspired, probation-driven
Tigers team at home over an
overrated Crimson Tide squad
with nothing to gain any day.
