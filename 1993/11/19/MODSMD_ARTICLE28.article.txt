# Women's soccer aims to dethrone
## Three teams stand in Cardinal kickers' path 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
; A fallen champion regaining past glory,
a perennial top-10 team and a soccer
monolith.
In George Mason, Massachusetts and
North Carolina, the 1993 Final Four has
enough women's soccer history to fill
shelves of record books.
George Mason
Coming out of the Central Region, the
George Mason Patriots upset two higher
ranked teams to get to the Final Four.
Topping No. 3 Notre Dame 2-1 in the first
round, George Mason tamed No. 9 Wis
consin 3-1 in the final to gain a Final Four
bid.
Although the Patriots enter this week
end's tournament in Chapel Hill, N.C., as
;the lowest-ranked team of the four, they
do have history on their side as the only
team other than North Carolina to win a
women's soccer national championship.
George Mason defeated the Tar Heels 2-0
; in 1985, breaking the monotony of Caroli
na dominance.
The Patriots are led by a trio of high
scoring players. Freshman forward Jenn
Gross heads the list, with 16 goals and six
assists for a personal total of 38 points.
Tammy Pear man, a junior forward, has
scored 15 goals and tallied one assist for 31
points. Another junior forward, Sherry
Worsham, has eight goals and 10 assists
for 26 points.
Anchoring the team defensively is
senior goalkeeper Skye Eddy. Starting 20
of 21 games, Eddy has allowed only 10
goals for a .54 goals-against-average.
This year marks the end of a three-year
absence from the NCAA Tournament for
. the Patriots. Last competing in 1989,
George Mason lost to N.C. State 3-0.
Massachusetts
Shutting out both of their opponents in
Eastern Regional play, the Minutewomen
of Massachusetts ride a 12-game unbeaten
streak into Final Four action. In the
regionals, Massachusetts blanked un
ranked Providence 5-0 on "five of the best
goals we've scored all year," said head
coach Jim Rudy. The Minutewomen then
slipped past No. 11 Connecticut 1-0 in the
final.
The Massachusetts roster consists of

few star players, with the offense split
between four key contributors. Defense
remains the Minutewomen's strength, as
senior goalkeeper Briana Scurry leads the
nation with a .34 goals-against average.
Massachusetts posted a 1-4 career
record against the Tar Heels, with the
lone victory coming during the 1985
campaign in a 2-0 upset in Amherst,
Mass.
North Carolina
Defending champion North Carolina
looks to extend their dominance to eight
straight years as national champion.
Coming out of the Southern Region, the
Tar Heels eliminated Southern Meth
odist 4-1 in the first round and shut out
Florida International 3-0 in the final. For
the two-game regional tournament, Car
olina outshot the competition 47-3.
Playing in their 12th consecutive
NCAA Final Four, the Tar Heels post an

impressive list of accomplishments in
postseason play. Carolina (34-1 in tourna
ment play) currently has a 23-game tour
nament winning streak. The Tar Heels'
only tournament loss came in George
Mason's 1985 upset win.
Since the sport was elevated to the var
sity level in 1979, Carolina is 296-8-9.
They have been ranked No. 1 since the
beginning of the 1991 season.
All-American Mia Hamm leads the Tar
Heels' devastating offensive attack. The
Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the
Year for the third time in her career,
Hamm has scored 24 goals and assisted
on 13 others for a total of 61 points this
year, pushing her career marks to 101
goals and 69 assists.
Minding the goal for the Tar Heels is
experienced keeper Shelley Finger, a
junior. Finger has a .44 goals-against
average this year and has recorded 25.5
shutouts in her collegiate career.
