A shot at immortality
The No. 2 Stanford women's soccer
team (18-2-1) enters the history books this
weekend, playing in its first Final Four in
the 10-year existence of the sport on the
varsity level on the Farm. However, before
the Cardinal walk away with the trophy, it
must journey to the heart of enemy terri
tory - Chapel Hill, N.C.
The top-ranked North Carolina Tar
Heels (21-0), national champions for all
but one year in NCAA women's soccer's
11-year history, ride a 79-game winning
streak into the Final Four. UNC faces No.
5 Massachusetts (17-2-3) at 10 a.m. PST,
with Stanford scheduled to play No. 10
George Mason (18-2-1) at 12:30 PST. Both
games will be played at UNC's Fetzer
Field, where the Tar Heels are 132-0-2.
"As much as we'd like a shot at Caroli
na, the most important game of the season
for us is George Mason," said head coach
lan Sawyers. "Any energy spent on Caroli
na now would be a waste of energy."
Earlier this year, Stanford played the
Tar Heels in the Challenge Club College
Tournament in Houston, pushing Caroli
na before losing 3-1. Although the Cardinal
gave up two early goals, it fought back to
bring the score to 2-1 before giving up a
late goal. Hoping to score the tying goal,
Stanford pressed 10 attackers, which
allowed Carolina to score again on a break
away.
The Cardinal season has been one of
steady improvement. Despite an early sea
son loss to Washington State, Stanford
continued to build momentum toward the
postseason with a seven-game winning
streak through Western Regional play,
where it topped Cal 2-0 and Portland 1-0 to
earn the Final Four bid.
"Team chemistry has been so good this
year," said senior forward Sarah Rafanelli.
"Lan has had a lot to do with that."
Sawyers, an interim coach, has guided
Stanford to a school-record 18 wins this
season. The Department of Athletics will
continue its search for a permanent coach
later this year, according to Senior Assis
tant Athletic Director Sheryl Levick.
"We've worked very hard this season to
get where we are," Sawyers said.
"Although we'd like to sit back and be
rewarded for our efforts, there is still seri
ous work to be done."

Stanford's offense is symbolized by the
present and the future of Cardinal soccer.
Rafanelli and freshman Erin Martin come
together to form one of the country's most
potent scoring duos, combining for 34
goals and 19 assists this year.
For the year, Rafanelli has 20 goals, a
Stanford record. She has also recorded
eight assists for 48 points, pushing her
career marks to 59 goals and 34 assists.
Her 152 career points is also a Cardinal
record.
"My offense has been helped tremen
dously by Erin this year," Rafanelli said.
"Defenses can't just key on me, because
Erin will destroy them."
Proving Rafanelli's statement is not dif
ficult. The two forwards have teamed up
for 12 goals this year, and Martin has set
freshman records for goals (14), assists
(11) and points (39).
The key to the Cardinal playing style
lies in ball possession, which requires top
play from the midfield. Sophomore
Carmel Murphy (eight goals, four assists)
leads a steady corps of Stanford players.
Juniors Anna Patitucci and Jen Stephan
and freshmen Emily Burt and Wendy
Latimer have all had extensive playing
time this year.
Defensively, Stanford has one of the
most complete back lines in the country.
Sweeper Jessica Fischer, a sophomore, has
provided a surprise scoring threat as she
has found the net eight times this year,
adding five assists. Junior Melinda Min
strell and freshmen Suzie Boots and Stacy
Cook complete the defense, holding oppo
nents to 7.6 shots per game.
Backing up the Cardinal defense, senior
goalkeeper Leslie Garrard continues to
turn away opponents' shots with remark
able success. Boasting a .34 goals-against
average with 17 shutouts, Garrard has
only let seven shots escape her iron grip
this year.
Voted Pacific-10 champions by a deci
sion among conference coaches, Stanford
has dominated in nearly all its games. Out
shooting 20 of 21 opponents, the Cardinal
has outscored the competition 67-7. North
Carolina outshot Stanford 16-11 in their
Oct. 17 meeting.
