The Medical School Faculty
Senate will vote today on a mea
sure that would increase the re
quired period of students' clinical
training from 12 months to either
15 or 18 months â€” a prospect that
has medical students upset.
Many students, who find the 15-
month change easier to swallow,
are nervous that the potential six
month increase would substantial
ly change the nature of the Medical
School's relatively unstructured
program, which they say gives stu
dents the flexibility to do more in
depth, creative work. A group of
concerned students will present
their views to the senate today.
"The important question is

how much training does one need
to make a competent physician,"
said Dr. Charlotte Jacobs, the se
nior associate dean for education
and student affairs. "It's the most
difficult question, and no one can
answer it."
Despite this difficulty, the Med
ical School is trying to find the an
swer after Dr. Kenneth Vosti, the
associate dean for student affairs,
brought the issue of the clinical
training period to the attention of
the school's faculty. According to
Jacobs, requirements at compara
ble research institutions such as
Harvard, Yale and Duke range from
14 to 20 months, substantially
more than the 12 months Stanford
requires.
