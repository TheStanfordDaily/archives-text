# Medical students wary of plan to increase training

The Medical School Faculty
Senate will vote today on a mea
sure that would increase the re
quired period of students' clinical
training from 12 months to either
15 or 18 months — a prospect that
has medical students upset.
Many students, who find the 15-
month change easier to swallow,
are nervous that the potential six
month increase would substantial
ly change the nature of the Medical
School's relatively unstructured
program, which they say gives stu
dents the flexibility to do more in
depth, creative work. A group of
concerned students will present
their views to the senate today.
"The important question is

how much training does one need
to make a competent physician,"
said Dr. Charlotte Jacobs, the se
nior associate dean for education
and student affairs. "It's the most
difficult question, and no one can
answer it."
Despite this difficulty, the Med
ical School is trying to find the an
swer after Dr. Kenneth Vosti, the
associate dean for student affairs,
brought the issue of the clinical
training period to the attention of
the school's faculty. According to
Jacobs, requirements at compara
ble research institutions such as
Harvard, Yale and Duke range from
14 to 20 months, substantially
more than the 12 months Stanford
requires.
Medical students Sarah
Roberts and Wendy Todaro,
members of a group of students
concerned about the issue,
emphasized that both students
and faculty had the same goal: the
best possible medical education.
The faculty senate "should be a
meeting of the minds. We want
them to hear our arguments, but
we're all after what's best for
Stanford," Roberts said.
The students are concerned
that the movement in the faculty
for a vague 18-month policy will
gain support.
"There's overwhelming sup
port (among students) for the 15-
month proposal," Todaro said.
"But the students are worried
(that with more structure),
they're not going to be able to
spread their wings."

According to Dr. Willard Fee,
the Medical School Faculty Sen
ate chair, many faculty expressed
concern that while the students
walking in were extraordinarily
gifted, "they don't walk out gifted
— they walk out OK." Fee said
many of the faculty felt, through
observations of clinical perfor
mances, that the proportion of
extraordinary "products" of the
school was much less than it
should be.
He added that although many
students already exceeded the min
imum, a standard had to be set.
"Medicine has become more
complex, and students need more
experiential knowledge," Fee said.
"We want to set a minimum stan
dard that will drive the system to
the mean, not the exception."
When asked whether the 12-
month requirement is enough,
second-year student Anna Lem
bke said, "I sure as hell do. 1 used
to be a teacher, and I know you
can take education courses up the

wazoo, but you're not going to
know what it's like until you have
some experience," she said. "I
think it's the same thing with
being a doctor.
"Now, I'm not saying the
school should send us at half-kil
ter and end up killing people," she
qualified, "but a few months more
is not going to make it or break it."
Lembke said she feels that the
move "shows a lack of respect for
the students. . . . People in Stan
ford Medical School are not lazy
bums. They don't come here to do
the minimum."
Students and administrators
alike emphasized the student
body's high achievement level,
with students using the curricu
lum flexibility to write books, do
research and conduct projects in
underdeveloped countries. The
school is weighing these aspects
against its desire for a more rigor
ous clinical standard.
Medical students typically do
two to three years of non-clinical,

classroom training, and then do
two years of clinical work in
"clerkships." Jacobs said that,
most students already end up
doing 15-20 months of clinical
work, especially since they need
18 months of clinical work to
practice medicine in California.
That difference in clinical
requirements has distinguished
Stanford Medical School, for bet
ter or for worse, in flexibility and
attractiveness to potential medi
cal students as well as clinical rep
utation.
Jacobs added that Stanford's
less restrictive clinical require
ment is "one of the reasons [stu
dents] come here — they have a
lot of choice."
"I'm worried that 18 months
(of required clinical work) will
eventually hurt (the school),"
Todaro said. "When Stanford stu
dents enter residency, they usual
ly enter as much broader and
deeper physicians because they're
doing other stuff."
