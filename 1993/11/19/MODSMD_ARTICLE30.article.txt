Last week I decided that my life is too
boring. It's time to tell my story and
liven things up.
The full story — the manifesto of Josh
ness, the two-hour animated holiday special
in the cartoon that has become my life —
would probably fit more comfortably on a full
page. But I think you'll get the point.
I tell this to you on the one-year anniver
sary of the saga's beginning. And I swear it's
all true.
We begin somewhere in the E section
of Green Library. I was doing
research for a paper and I had my
backpack and books spread all over the
place. I'm plopped down on the floor reading
and she — no, She — appeared in the aisle.
Hiking boots, Umbro shorts, hair pulled up,
colorful backpack.
Now I've heard a bazillion times of some
one seeing someone attractive in the library
— the 27-second crush as you watch them
stare at the Socrates screen or shuffle
through the reference section — but I had
never actually experienced it. Now She shows
up, all cornflowery and shining and natural
and rural: the basic Josh archetype.
She squeezed by me, and I admit, I faked
like I was reading, watching Her from
behind my page. I frantically searched for
something to say, but (of course) I didn't
utter a word. I suppose that I really didn't
need to, though, because when I reached up
to grab a book from the top shelf, the whole
row crashed down on my head — "I'm a
dork. I'm a dork. I'm a dork," my body was
screaming for me.
After a little while — minutes? hours?
days? — She picked up Her stuff and left. I,
too, decided that I was done, and hurried to
find Her. By the time I got to the first floor,
She was already past the Green high-tech,
crotchety old man security system.
At that moment I promised myself that if
I ever saw Library Girl (as she soon came to
be called) again I would do something risky,
like, I dunno, say "Hi" or something.
A week later I was perched high up in Cal
ifornia Memorial Stadium watching Big
Game, and, one section and about three hun
dred people over was Library Girl, eating
yogurt. I wanted to approach her, but some
time during the third quarter she disap
peared. Gone again. | • ; j t ; j
Soon, it became my mission: find Library
Girl.
Days and weeks passed and the story of
Library Girl had reached mythic propor
tions and Sasquatchian levels of intrigue as
false Library Girl sightings popped up
everywhere among my friends. "If I only
had my Bat-a-rang, I would have captured
her," I was often told. My squad was on 24-
hour alert. I bought a package of candy
necklaces and constantly carried them
around with me, my gift to her if we ever
met.
But by Christmas break there was noth
ing and with winter quarter came its usual
early-sunset malaise. I had removed the
necklaces from my bag. There were only a
few more sightings, all hoaxes, and Deter
mined-Man struggled to hold onto the hope.
Then came Winter One-Acts. Before the
performance started, I was chatting
with Christine, one of my freshman
dorm RAs who was presently RAing in a
noteable freshman dorm. Among the group
So. if we lose the Axe does that mean we won t have an Axe Committee anymore''

of residents she brought with her, there was
a haunting familar back of a head. As the
lights dimmed for the first show, the head
turned around and I saw it was Hers.
Adrenaline secreted. Pulse increased.
During the plays I decided upon a strate
gy. After the show I had to go to a meeting
on their side of campus, so 1 would walk
with Christine and her flock and then casu
ally introduce myself to Her. But when the
show ended and we were filing out of the
Nitery it was already pouring rain. Library
Girl had decided to run home.

I found myself lamenting — I am not, nor
have ever been a Froshbook-scoping
frat-pud who prowls the halls of fresh
man dorms preying on innocents and I
never want to even be included in the same
neural transmission as one.
This was a quest, not a scam-job. What
was I to do? After a few days of convincing
myself of the nobility and necessity of my
actions, I gave up on subtlety and found out
Her name from the RA-friend.
Now I knew that I had to approach Her.
But I couldn't. I was scared to death —
trapped between wide-eyed potential and
my comfortable passivity.
Then one afternoon the Library Girl
zoomed by me on Her red bike. That was
my divine omen.
That evening, I hopped on my bike and
zipped over to her dorm, where I promptly
became gutless and rode around the dorm a
hundred times. By the time I worked up the
nerve to go inside, I realized that it was
Wednesday and there was a house meeting,
and so I parked my bike then walked around
the dorm a hundred times. Finally, long
after the meeting was over, I climbed up
those cement stairs and went to find Her.
Eventually, I found Her room and some
how got the nerve to knock on the door only
to find out from Her roommate that She
had just stepped out. I stammered some
thing about telling Her I stopped by but
that She didn't know who I was so it didn't
really matter. I confused the both of us and
left stomping stealthily.
The next evening, I found myself again
circling again. I managed to find Her win
dow and seeing Her silhouette (really),
pulled myself together and slowly crept to
Her door.
Knocked. No answer. She was out again!
This time, I wasn't going to leave. I sat
down on the steps across from Her room
and waited. She had to be back soon. A half
hour later I decided that I'd had enough
and left a note, asking Her to call me
because I wanted to tell Her a story.
When I got home, one of my roommates
was on the phone with his long-distance
honey-bunches of oats and two hours later
when he finally got off the sweaty phone, I
was about to burst. I told him what had
happened, and as we were talking I heard
the answering machine go off. It had to be

NAFTA. thmafU — I want my MTV. damnit
Her. I punched the playback button, and
sure enough, a voice came on saying that
She was responding to my note and She had
been trying to call for last couple hours.
I was off. This time, I had a Gonzo Pez
dispenser as a good luck totem from a
friend.
When I arrived, I did the circle-thing
once again, and finally took a deep breath
and made my way to the second floor. I
knocked on Her door and a muffled "Come
in" responded. I opened the door and there
She was, sitting at Her desk, in Her paja
mas, a fable in Her own right, Library Girl.
"Hi, I'm Josh," I said. "Want a Pez?"
She said yes and took it from me. Yes!
I told Her that I came to tell Her a story.
We went outside of Her room and sat on the
staircase (my old friend), and I somehow
started the conversation. I asked that She
be patient with me because I was scared to
death. I then started my story:
"Once upon a time, there was a boy who
went to the library to study. While he was
there, he saw a girl . .
I then proceded to tell Her the story of
this boy trying to find the girl, and ended
up with the boy finally finding out who she
was and going to meet her.
. . and then he knocked on her door."
I finished the story and I'm short of
words to describe the look on Her face. I
fumbled with my backpack, pulled out the
candy necklaces and gave them to Her.
Her first words were, "Hi, I'm
I was huge at that point.
We then embarked on one of the most
phenomenal, fulfilling conversations I ever
had. It was so unreal. Cheesy, fairy tale lan
guage could scarcely describe it. I felt so,
well . . . wonderful.
We wrapped up our talk on such a hope
ful, affirmative note that as I floated down
stairs to my trusty aluminum steed and
headed home, I was Knox Overstreet zoom
ing among the geese — only I was much
cooler.
When I opened the door to my dorm, the
house meeting was in progress and my
faithful roommie yelled out something like
"You're back!" The meeting paused, then
everyone burst out clapping and cheering. I
ducked into my room, and seconds later the
room was full. I told them all of it then told
it again and I was even more huge.
And that's my story. What?! That's it?
All that and it ends like this? Yep,
pretty much.
I mean, we did talk a bit and I did make
a complete fool out of myself one more
time, but nothing ever happened. Nada.
I don't really know why. There were a
few (dozen) unreturned phone calls and a
note or two left on doors, but when she
(yes, demoted to lower case) attempted
comunication during winter quarter dead
week it was clear my adventure was over.
Ka-put. Me the supreme idiot.
After all that dectective work and ulcer
build-up and bliss, it all fizzled out. No
more drama, nothing worthy of continuing
this column. What looked to be the most
amazing thing was actually a collossal flop.
Catharsis. Catharsis. Oh well, . . .
