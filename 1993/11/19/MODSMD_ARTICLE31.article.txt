# Plan your day with The Diversions Horoscope
## 
### 
Scorpio (Oct. 23—Nov. 21):
This is your day to gloat. An
ex-lover is going to get a really
bad haircut. You'll see Stock
dale during lunch. Look in
your jean-jacket pockets . . .
$20 awaits. Six messages on
your answering machine and a
standard deviation above the
mean on the Hum Bio A-side
mid-term. Enjoy!
Saggitarius (Nov. 22—Dec.
21): The perfect day to clean
house. Not only your room but
your life. Lose that dork who's
been bringing you down and
put some shelves up. That way
you'll be in a better mood and
will have more desk space.
Some new shades might perk
up the ol' single.
Capricornnuts (Dec. 22 —
Jan. 19): Keep an eye on your

wallet. Not that anyone is
going to steal it, it's just that
you're spending too much.
Duh. You don't need that new
Gap sweater. But if you must
buy it, return an unread text
book; don't overdraw your
account, otherwise Wells Fargo
will send you mean, nasty let
ters.
Aquarius (Jan. 20 —Feb.
18): Today's the day you've
been waiting for. Everyone
thinks you're adorable. Good
hair day. You lost two pounds
and your butt looks great. EPT
test negative!
Pisces (Feb. 19—March 20):
Don't wear red — pigeons aim
for bright colors. A partner
might surprise you with news
of an infection, so be prepared.
Also, while fiber helps you keep
regular, too much can make
you fart a whole lot. A good day
for laundry.
Aries (March 21—April 19):
This will not be a good day for
you. You might die. Seriously.
Exceptionally bad karma.
We're talking run over by a
Monster Truck here. Stay in
bed. If you're outside reading
this, RUN HOME! You'd bet
ter pray you don't have a mid
term today, and yes, everyone
is watching you.
Taurus (April 20 —May 20):
Predictions for the Bull.
Tonight you will go see Gai

eties. Tresidder frozen yogurt
flavor will be Bananna-berry
Crunch. If you have a midterm
today, the answer for number
17 is C, or Italy. Don't copy
from the guy to your left in the
hat — he didn't even buy the
lecture notes.
Gemini (May 21—June 20):
Time to stop kidding yourself.
You suck. No one really likes
you. The stars say that you
might be adopted (wonder why
you've never seen any pictures
of you mother pregnant?). Ever
hear of the freshman 15? Food
Service ain't that good.
Romance is just around the
corner, but then again, so is
Haagen Das. Find some Aquar
ians and try to be more like
them.
Cancer (June 21—July 22):
Don't take the advice of
strangers. They might mean
well, but they also might be try
ing to get you to break up with
someone just so they can go out
with you. Just like Keith tried
to do to Allison on Melrose.
Think long and hard about it,
that's why they call them
strange-rs.
Gringo (1492-present):
Everything should go great for
you. Life will continue to be as
smooth as cream cheese. The
world is yours, so take it from
anyone who thinks otherwise.
Leo (July 23—Aug. 22): Job

opportunities abound. Now
you won't have to co-term!
Told you the double major was
worth it. Plan for a busy week
end of celebration, but avoid
tequila at all cost.
Virgo (Aug. 23 —Sept. 22):
Today's the day. You're gunna
get some. None of this "feast or
famine" Virgo crap, you'll be
rolling in it. Love — exciting
and new. Come aboard, we're
expecting you. Take a shower
and drink lots of Gatorade,
you'll need it, baby.
Libra (Sept. 23 —Oct. 21):
Beware of strangers offering
gifts especially in exchange for
"services." Keep an eye out!
That weird guy from your sec
tion is planning on asking you
out. Hide. He won't take no for
an answer. Also, call home —
your mom misses you.
Anthrax (Oct. 21—Oct. 22):
Take care of yourself. A nasty
cold is going around and it's
your turn to get it. Plenty of
fluids are in store for you. A
good friend may turn out to be
an excellent source of free tis
sues. Put off dealing with that
big task hanging over your
head — you'll just screw it up if
you do it today.
If you were born on Novem
ber 19: Happy Birthday!

ex-lover is going to get a really
bad haircut. You'll see Stock
dale during lunch. Look in
your jean-jacket pockets . . .
$20 awaits. Six messages on
your answering machine and a
standard deviation above the
mean on the Hum Bio A-side
mid-term. Enjoy!
Saggitarius (Nov. 22—Dec.
21): The perfect day to clean
house. Not only your room but
your life. Lose that dork who's
been bringing you down and
put some shelves up. That way
you'll be in a better mood and
will have more desk space.
Some new shades might perk
up the ol' single.
Capricornnuts (Dec. 22 —
Jan. 19): Keep an eye on your

wallet. Not that anyone is
going to steal it, it's just that
you're spending too much.
Duh. You don't need that new
Gap sweater. But if you must
buy it, return an unread text
book; don't overdraw your
account, otherwise Wells Fargo
will send you mean, nasty let
ters.
Aquarius (Jan. 20 —Feb.
18): Today's the day you've
been waiting for. Everyone
thinks you're adorable. Good
hair day. You lost two pounds
and your butt looks great. EPT
test negative!
Pisces (Feb. 19—March 20):
Don't wear red — pigeons aim
for bright colors. A partner
might surprise you with news
of an infection, so be prepared.
Also, while fiber helps you keep
regular, too much can make
you fart a whole lot. A good day
for laundry.
Aries (March 21—April 19):
This will not be a good day for
you. You might die. Seriously.
Exceptionally bad karma.
We're talking run over by a
Monster Truck here. Stay in
bed. If you're outside reading
this, RUN HOME! You'd bet
ter pray you don't have a mid
term today, and yes, everyone
is watching you.
Taurus (April 20 —May 20):
Predictions for the Bull.
Tonight you will go see Gai

eties. Tresidder frozen yogurt
flavor will be Bananna-berry
Crunch. If you have a midterm
today, the answer for number
17 is C, or Italy. Don't copy
from the guy to your left in the
hat — he didn't even buy the
lecture notes.
Gemini (May 21—June 20):
Time to stop kidding yourself.
You suck. No one really likes
you. The stars say that you
might be adopted (wonder why
you've never seen any pictures
of you mother pregnant?). Ever
hear of the freshman 15? Food
Service ain't that good.
Romance is just around the
corner, but then again, so is
Haagen Das. Find some Aquar
ians and try to be more like
them.
Cancer (June 21—July 22):
Don't take the advice of
strangers. They might mean
well, but they also might be try
ing to get you to break up with
someone just so they can go out
with you. Just like Keith tried
to do to Allison on Melrose.
Think long and hard about it,
that's why they call them
strange-rs.
Gringo (1492-present):
Everything should go great for
you. Life will continue to be as
smooth as cream cheese. The
world is yours, so take it from
anyone who thinks otherwise.
Leo (July 23—Aug. 22): Job

opportunities abound. Now
you won't have to co-term!
Told you the double major was
worth it. Plan for a busy week
end of celebration, but avoid
tequila at all cost.
Virgo (Aug. 23 —Sept. 22):
Today's the day. You're gunna
get some. None of this "feast or
famine" Virgo crap, you'll be
rolling in it. Love — exciting
and new. Come aboard, we're
expecting you. Take a shower
and drink lots of Gatorade,
you'll need it, baby.
Libra (Sept. 23 —Oct. 21):
Beware of strangers offering
gifts especially in exchange for
"services." Keep an eye out!
That weird guy from your sec
tion is planning on asking you
out. Hide. He won't take no for
an answer. Also, call home —
your mom misses you.
Anthrax (Oct. 21—Oct. 22):
Take care of yourself. A nasty
cold is going around and it's
your turn to get it. Plenty of
fluids are in store for you. A
good friend may turn out to be
an excellent source of free tis
sues. Put off dealing with that
big task hanging over your
head — you'll just screw it up if
you do it today.
If you were born on Novem
ber 19: Happy Birthday!
