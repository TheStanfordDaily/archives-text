## American Indian Program director will step down in June after 9 years 
### Cametra Thompson Staff writer 
After nine years at Stanford,
James Larimore, assistant dean of
students and director of the Amer
ican Indian Program, is resigning
from his post, citing his desire to
continue his studies in the School
of Education. Larimore's resigna
tion will take effect in June.
"When I first came to Stanford
in the summer of 1985, I planned
to stay only three to five years to
build up and improve the Ameri
can Indian Program," he said.
"My work has been accomplished
here."
Expressing concern over what
he called the University's new
philosophies and priorities about
diversity in the student body, La
rimore said he did consider stay
ingon longer because he is worried
that the University's new budget
priorities may de-emphasize mul

ticulturalism. "It was one of the
last temptations to stick around,"
he said.
Nevertheless, Larimore feels
that now is the best time to leave
because the community is now
firmly established and has compe
tent leaders to find his replace
ment.
Since he arrived at Stanford,
Larimore has worked with the Ad
missions Office to increase enroll
ment of Native American students
at Stanford. "In 1985, Native
Americans were a targeted minor
ity, but the recruitment mailing
list had last been updated in 1974.
Many of the schools on the list had
closed by then," he said.
In the mid-1980s, Stanford was
recruiting only eight to 12 Native
American freshmen a year, with
the total of undergraduates and
graduates at 65. Now, the Univer
sity enrolls 20 to 25 Native Amer
ican freshmen each year, and
total enrollment has reached 200.
Andrew Lisac, resident fellow
of Muwekma-Tah-Ruk, the
Native American theme house,
said Larimore has had a "pro
found impact on the [Native
American] community â€” it's
incredible what he's done over
the last (ninel years."
Larimore also established the
American Indian Summer Pro
gram, which brings incoming

Native American freshmen to
campus during the summer to
help them get acquainted with
Stanford life.
In addition, he was instrumen
tal in establishing and naming
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk and served
as the house's first resident fel
low.
Larimore, who earned his un
dergraduate degree from East
Texas State University, served as
assistant director of admissions at
Dartmouth and worked with the
Federal Emergency Management
Agency before coming to Stanford.
He is pursuing a master's degree
in administration and policy anal
ysis at the School of Education.
