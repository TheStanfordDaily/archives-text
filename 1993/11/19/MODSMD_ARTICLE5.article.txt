# Fake tickets may make Big Game appearance
## 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
A new batch of Big Game tickets
not worth the paper they were
printed on may turn up in scalpers'
hands at the stadium tomorrow.
Police suspect an Asian female
between the ages of 20 and 30 used
a color copier to photocopy 200 to
250 fraudulent Big (lame tickets,
said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
The woman, who identified her
self as Linda Chau, went to a print
er in Campbell Nov. 5 asking to get
her football tickets perforated,
Niemeyer said. The printer noticed
that the general admission tickets
were cut irregularly, and that there
were only a few different ticket
numbers among the many tickets.
"He's 100 percent positive they
were photocopies," Niemeyer said.

The printer insisted on verifying
that the woman was from the Stan
ford ticket office as she claimed. She
told him that she was late getting
the tickets done and did not want
her employer to find out. The print
er did not perforate the tickets, and
the woman left the shop.
"He refused to do it because he
figured something was wrong,"
Niemeyer said.
The printer reported the
woman to the Campbell Police,
who notified Stanford officials.
Niemeyer said the Stanford Felice
have some "good leads" on the
woman, including the license plate
number of her silver 1984 Audi.
Niemeyer said the printer re
membered that many of the photo
copied tickets were numbered
2430.
General admission tickets for
the now-sold-out game cost $32.
