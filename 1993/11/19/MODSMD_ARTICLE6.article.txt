# Queerland comes out with Review
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
While it may not have been mud wrestling, the
noontime encounter between conservatives and pays
in White Plaza yesterday was a spectacle of sorts.
In fliers distributed around campus, Queerland, a
student group representing members of the gay, les
bian, and bisexual community, had promised to turn
the Stanford Review's "Conservative Coming-Out
Day" into the "Sexually Frustrated Conservative
Mud-Wrestling Day." The mud failed to materialize,
but each group brought about 20 people to White
Plaza with tongues planted firmly in their cheeks.
"We just wanted to let the Review know how
funny we think they are," said senior Natasha Iskan
der. "The only way to respond to something as offen
sive as this is with humor."
Members of Queerland took issue with the Re
view's use of the term "coming out," which they said
trivialized the experiences of gay people by implying
that conservatives face the same kind of obstacles as
gays do.
"I mean, we're here in the
shadow of the Fire Truck House
and you're here with Hoover
Tower behind you," senior Rachel
Maddow told the Review mem
bers present.
Conservatives, on the other
hand, defended their use of the
term "coming out." Lisa Koven,
the editor in chief of the Review,
downplayed the use of the term,
saying, "I don't think we'd ever
do anything to harm them or to
trivialize their cause."
She said the event was really a
chance for people to network with
conservatives and to see that
"we're real people too."
Members of the conservative
group also expressed a desire to
reach out to the gay community.
Koven added that she didn't
think "there should be a split
between gays and conservatives."
The mood of the dual event

was initially festive, with the
Review providing free food and
drink, while Queerland provided
the humor by holding a banner
which read, "We know it's hard.
Let our helping hands skillfully
tease you out of the closet."
Junior Aida Croal joked, "This is
multiculturalism at its zenith."
The mood turned more seri
ous, however, when members of
Queerland began calling for
speeches from members of the
Review. When senior Peter
Cousins, representing the conser
vative camp, approached the
group, Maddow asked him, "Why
aren't you doing what you said
you'd do? We were expecting
some voicing, and we figured the
point of doing this in a public
forum was so everyone can hear."
Cousins responded, "Choosing
the term 'coming out' emphasizes
the differences between conserva
tives and the rest of campus."
The event was originally intend
ed as a "mock protest" against the
cancellation of the Big Game Bon
fire, Koven said, but it was later
changed to "coming-out day."
