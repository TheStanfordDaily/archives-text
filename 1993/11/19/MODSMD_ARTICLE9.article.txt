# GSB trying to cure 'hiccup' in applications
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
After suffering a 20 percent decline in
applications last year, the Graduate School of
Business is working to renew enthusiasm for
its MBA program.
According to statistics released by the
Office of MBA Admissions, the Business
School received about 800 fewer applications
last year than it has in previous years. Even
so, the school admitted 353 students, only six
fewer than in 1992.
Though some administrators view the
applicant drop simply as part of national trend
that is affecting all schools, the Business
School is taking concrete steps to ensure that
its numbers are better this year.
"We've tried to be more responsive in get
ting out applications materials to students
who have made inquiries," said Assoc. Dean
David Baron. "We've also held more recep
tions than in previous years."
He said attendance at these receptions "has
been up substantially this year," and an

increase in interest has come "particularly
from Europe."
In the United States, though, fewer and
fewer students are applying to business
schools across the nation.
"There is a dimension of'fashion' in grad
uate education," said George Parker, another
associate dean of the Business School. "Har
vard and Wharton were both affected along
with us."
While officials at the Business School were
hesitant to give specific explanations for the
decline, both Parker and Baron were willing
to speculate on its causes.
"I think a large part of it is just statistical
noise," said Parker. "Basically the trend is up
for business schools. ... I would call it a hic
cup."
But Baron said the decrease may be indica
tive of other problems. "My belief is that I the
decline] is, in part, recession-driven," he said,
adding that a similar decline occurred in the
early 1980s because of the economy.
"There may (also) be some decrease in
demand for MBA educations," he said.

Michael Kolman, a first-year Business
School student, said the costs of education
might also be playing a role in the decline.
"The cost of business school is just out of
hand," he said. "The two years will cost you
about $65,000."
But other than the price tag on education,
Kolman said he "can't see that it was any dif
ferent this year from any other years."
Even if there was a considerable decrease
in interest in MBA programs last year, Parker
said the Business School may already be back
on track.
"So far we have more applications this year
than previous years," he said. "Only one other
year in history did we have so many first:
round applications."
However, because the applications come in
two waves — November and January —
Baron said the increase in early applications
may not signal a return to the status quo.
"We're optimistic that the number of
applications will return to historical levels,''
he said. "But right now it's just too early to
tell."
