"When times turn bad, they're made
worse by hesitation, halfway meas
ures, and panicky decisions. Such as
the decision to reduce or eliminate
advertising. The fact is, companies
that maintain or increase their
advertising spending during reces
sions get ahead. A less crowded field
allows messages to be seen more
clearly, and that increased visibility
results in higher sales both during
and after a recession." The Wall Street Journal
