Doing business with banks is too expensive.
Sure, they might waive a couple of fees—for a
while— but too soon, you'll pay too much for
routine services. Like $45 a year for
checking—no matter how much you have in
your account. An outrageous 19.8% to finance
your Visa bill. Even $5 for going to a teller!

banking hassles.

Union, and see how easily you get what you
need.
Truly low-cost checking
Wells Fargo charges a $4.50 basic monthly
service fee and BofA charges $5 —for their
cheapest accounts with unlimited checkwriting.
And no matter how much you keep in your
account, you still pay that fee.

An ATM card gives you quick, easy access to
your accounts. So why wait days for your
card? Instead, get your Credit Union ATM
card at Tresidder Union the same day.

A Visa should do more than help you build a
credit history. It should be easy to afford.
And start you with a generous
credit line.
Plan to stretch out some payments? The
Credit Union's finance rate is a reasonable
15%—less than Wells or BofA charges.

Strange but true, the banks charge some
customers $4 to $5 to go to a teller! But not at
the Credit Union.
And Wells Fargo has fees for calling customer
service! We'll never do that.

Volunteers are needed to help test
"CUOnline," Stanford Federal Credit
Union's Home Computer Banking Service.
SFCU will be introducing "CUOnline" in
early 1994. This new service will allow
Credit Union members to access their
account information and transact financial
business with SFCU. Members will be able
to log on via FOLIO or via a Macintosh or
PC., providing they have modems.
To make certain we produce the best
possible product, the Credit Union would
like to have 200 to 300 SFCU members test it
thoroughly before it is offered to the
membership at large. The testing will take
place in December.
If you are a member of the Credit Union and
are interested in participating, please phone
(415) 694-1000 or send an EM to SFCU
Marketing Department at mailbox
R.R.ACT@Forsythe.
Or for more information, read about us on
FOLIO. Or call 694-1000.
