# Body armor replaces pompons at Big Game

Picture this: a group of Stanford fans
huddle together and unsheath a mortar.
They slowly load a round projectile into the
small cannon's mouth and aim it at the Cal
ifornia rooting section. Fire! The bomb ex
plodes, filling the air with paper figures and
pennants.

Times have changed since 1905 when
"stunts" such as these were a common fea
ture at Big Game, and so have the students'
choice of ammunition. In last year's contest
at Berkeley, Stanford Band members
dodged apples, oranges and other healthy
snacks that rained down on them from the
Cal student section dur-

ing the
halftime
show.

Cardinal

supporters

have also

demonstrated a
knack for

guerilla war
fare at Big

Game. The
truth is

that Big
Game
has

turned
into a battle
in the trenches both on and off the gridiron.
In fact, often what happens on the sidelines

and in the cheering sections rivals the on
field action.
Emotions ran high for players and fans
alike in 1992.
Traditionally, the Tree has been a
marked target by Cal fans at Big Game. But
last year, one of the fans who attempted to
defoliate the mascot was subjected to a mer
ciless beating by tuba and trombone players
until police and security personnel pulled
him away.
Then yell leader Seye Ewedemi, also
known as "Flag Boy," had his Stanford
cheering flag snatched from him as he pa
raded past the Cal student section. Ewede
mi caught one of the thieves and was pre
pared to take an eye for an eye.
"Some of (the pranks) are good-natured,
but when they destroy property, it's un
called for," he said. "That guy should either

be arrested or
they should let
me go at him for
about half an
hour."

It's hard to tell
when Big Game
became as hotly
contested among
fans as among
players, but to look
at the earliest
games between
Stanford and Cal is
to go back to a

kindler, gentler era.
Back in the early

1900s, fan support
was actually fan sup-

port, not fan warfare or
fan interference, and

both sides attempted to
beat each other's "stunts"
rather than each other.
The 1914 contest included

some of the biggest "stunts" in Big Game
history. At the start of the game, a small air

plane flown by Lincoln Beachey sped to
ward the field. Beachey, said to be Pete Mav
erick's grandfather, traced a Stanford "S"
in the air with four loop-to-loops. The Car
dinal aviator also had the good sense to

chuck a Cardinal-covered football into the
California rooting section. This was big
stuff back when Dan Dierdorf wasn't greet-

ing the Goodyear blimp every five minutes.
In the cheering sections, Stanford and
California continued to one-up each other.
Three cowled, black-robed monkish figures
with huge red megaphones led Stanford in
the dirge "California's Burial Song." On the

Cal side, two bears tugged at blue and gold
leashes just below the rooting section.
Berkeley fans also released pigeons into the
air with fluttering gold and blue streamers
attached to them. At one point, the Cal sec-

tion transformed into a sheet of mosaic as
the fans formed a California "C" from plac
ards.

Stunts, cheers and student decorum
were equally important in 1933. A Stan
ford Daily article advised men to wear
white shirts and women to wear white
dresses, bleach optional, in order for the
stunts to be effective. In addition, men
