were required to purchase rooters caps
from Wideman's in Palo Alto for 15 cents,
while women needed to buy pompons from
the ASSU office for 25 cents. This, of
course, was before women's lib. The article
also made some other motherly sugges
tions, including:
1. Know the yells thoroughly.
2. Don't boo, or shout cat calls at ANY
BODY!

3. KNOW THE HYMN! It will be sung
after the game and every rooter is expected
to stay in his place until after the Hymn has
been sung.

In 1971, armor rather than rooter's
caps might have been more appropriate at-

tire for fans. After Stanford
shut out the Golden Bears

14-0, a Cal
cheerleader
took his
team's loss a

little too per
sonally and de-

cided to take
things into his

own hands or
teeth, as the case
may have been. He
attempted to steal
the hat of Bob

Kurland, drum major of
the Stanford Band. Kur
land and several other
bandmembers pursued

the fleeing cheerleader and a
pileup ensued.

An officer broke up the fra
cas, but not before the cheer
leader sank his teeth into Kur
land's leg. The Stanford Daily
reported that Kurland's skin
was broken but he was not seri
ously injured. The newspaper
did not say whether Kurland
required rabies shots.
The band was looking into

possible legal action against the perpetra
tor, whose name was withheld. Presumably
Kurland recovered.

Be it 1971 or 1991, fans have sometimes
confused Big Game with target practice.
Take the case of Rod Meyer, a current se
nior and member of the Stanford baseball
team.

Prior to Big Game 1991, Meyer and a
couple friends devised a "funnelator," basi
cally a scaled-down catapult, made of two 6-
foot surgical tubes, lacrosse strings and
duct tape.
Midway through Big Game, Meyer and
his cohorts unleashed their funnelator and
loaded it with an apple. Two of them
kneeled down, while Meyer, spread-eagled,
pulled the pouch toward his crotch, five
seats back.

Unfortunately, when he released

le pouch, it turned
over on itself, swung
out about 20 feet and
flung the apple direct
ly into his family jew
els. The surrounding
student section gazed
over at the Cal root
ing section to admire

the shot, but the
apple lay in tiny

pieces at Meyer's
feet. He and his

friends esti
mate the

apple was
traveling
at 90 to

100

miles-per-hour
on impact.
"I was OK for
the first five sec
onds and I said
all right, let's fire
another one,"
Meyer recalled.
"Then it hit me."

He broke into a
cold sweat and top-

pled to the
ground in
agony.

Meanwhile,
as word of the
fiasco spread,
pained cringes
were said to
have flashed
across the
faces of the
entire male
population in
the cheering
section.
Needless to
say, Meyer
walked home
from the game
bow-legged and
didn't get

much sleep that night.
"We still don't know if
I'm sterile or not," he said
recently.

After the fiascos of the past several years,
the universities have decided to lay down
the law. In an open letter addressed to the
communities of Berkeley and Stanford, the
newly created Big Game Committee said:
"In recent years, competition has been so
intense that on occasion we have seen fans
lose some of the spirit of mutual respect
that is appropriate for these institutions."
The direction Big Game has taken since
1933 is evident when one considers the com

mittee's requests:
1. Please do not bring alchohol into the
stadium and, if you drink before the game,
please drink moderately
2. Please do not throw objects during the
game
3. Remain in the stands throughout the
game
It remains to be seen whether the Big
Game Committee's measures will prove ef
fective. Did they ever consider releasing
doves into the sky?

Kurland, drum major of
the Stanford Band. Kur
land and several other
bandmembers pursued

the fleeing cheerleader and a
pileup ensued.

An officer broke up the fra
cas, but not before the cheer
leader sank his teeth into Kur
land's leg. The Stanford Daily
reported that Kurland's skin
was broken but he was not seri
ously injured. The newspaper
did not say whether Kurland
required rabies shots.
The band was looking into

possible legal action against the perpetra
tor, whose name was withheld. Presumably
Kurland recovered.

Be it 1971 or 1991, fans have sometimes
confused Big Game with target practice.
Take the case of Rod Meyer, a current se
nior and member of the Stanford baseball
team.

Prior to Big Game 1991, Meyer and a
couple friends devised a "funnelator," basi
cally a scaled-down catapult, made of two 6-
foot surgical tubes, lacrosse strings and
duct tape.
Midway through Big Game, Meyer and
his cohorts unleashed their funnelator and
loaded it with an apple. Two of them
kneeled down, while Meyer, spread-eagled,
pulled the pouch toward his crotch, five
seats back.

Unfortunately, when he released

le pouch, it turned
over on itself, swung
out about 20 feet and
flung the apple direct
ly into his family jew
els. The surrounding
student section gazed
over at the Cal root
ing section to admire

the shot, but the
apple lay in tiny

pieces at Meyer's
feet. He and his

friends esti
mate the

apple was
traveling
at 90 to

100

miles-per-hour
on impact.
"I was OK for
the first five sec
onds and I said
all right, let's fire
another one,"
Meyer recalled.
"Then it hit me."

He broke into a
cold sweat and top-

pled to the
ground in
agony.

Meanwhile,
as word of the
fiasco spread,
pained cringes
were said to
have flashed
across the
faces of the
entire male
population in
the cheering
section.
Needless to
say, Meyer
walked home
from the game
bow-legged and
didn't get

much sleep that night.
"We still don't know if
I'm sterile or not," he said
recently.

After the fiascos of the past several years,
the universities have decided to lay down
the law. In an open letter addressed to the
communities of Berkeley and Stanford, the
newly created Big Game Committee said:
"In recent years, competition has been so
intense that on occasion we have seen fans
lose some of the spirit of mutual respect
that is appropriate for these institutions."
The direction Big Game has taken since
1933 is evident when one considers the com

mittee's requests:
1. Please do not bring alchohol into the
stadium and, if you drink before the game,
please drink moderately
2. Please do not throw objects during the
game
3. Remain in the stands throughout the
game
It remains to be seen whether the Big
Game Committee's measures will prove ef
fective. Did they ever consider releasing
doves into the sky?
