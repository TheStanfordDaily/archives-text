# Give 'em the Axe? Relic's history full of thefts

The Big Game. The most im
portant game of the season for the
Stanford Cardinal.

All of the glamour surrounding
the event magnifies its signifi
cance. But to understand Big
Game's importance, you must
comprehend the tradition that
surrounds it. And to understand
Big Game's tradition, you must
grasp the Axe.
At first glance, it appears to be
no more than a piece of metal at
tached to a wooden plaque. But,
like Excalibur, the Axe is said to
have driven men insane when
they held its power in their
hands. It is a symbol of one of the
longest and most fiercely con
tested rivalries in college foot
ball. It is the coveted prize of Big
Game.

The awe-inspiring blade is cur
rently mounted upon a plaque
bearing the scores of past Big
Games. The plaque's heading
reads: "The Stanford Axe
Forged March 1899. Captured by
California April 15, 1899. Recap
tured by Stanford April 13, 1930.
To be awarded annually to the
winner of the Big Game."
Originally, the Axe was viewed
not merely as a trophy, but as a
mascot, a concrete depiction of the
pride and spirit of all Stanfordites.
It was the tree without the mulch.
The Axe has its origins in a
cheer devised in 1986. Will Irwin
and Chris Bradley, both of the
Stanford Class of 1898, coined the
still-chanted "Give 'em the Axe"
battle cry.
However, the idea of the Axe it
self didn't come until April 1899.
At the time, the Stanford baseball
team needed a morale boost. Play
ing for the intercollegiate champi
onship in a best-of-three series
against Cal, Stanford took a hard
first loss, and many fans felt that
the players needed special inspira
tion to bounce back.

Yell leader Billy Erb led a few

others in the purchase of a $4.50
rusty broad axe. He painted the
14-inch blade red and added a
four-foot-long handle. They un
veiled it at the huge bonfire rally
two nights before the second
game.
The crowd roared its approval,
and the Axe was brought to the

game two days later, with Erb
leading the Axe yell. He proceed
ed to hack a bear effigy into
shreds. However, the Axe had did
not alter the game's outcome.
The Bears went on to a 9-7 victo
ry and wrapped up the champi
onship.
The loss was so devastating

that Stanford fans paid little at
tention to safeguarding their new
symbol, and a group of Berke
leyans seized it. A wild chase en
sued through the streets of San
Francisco, but somehow the
thieves managed to board a ferry
to safety across the Bay.
Stanford was outraged by the

incident. Riots erupted between
the two schools, prompting Stan
ford President David starr Jordan
to publicly admonish the Stanford
student body. Eventually, both
schools agreed that the Axe now
belonged to Cal "by right of con-

Cardinal's rivalry with its East Bay counterparts.
