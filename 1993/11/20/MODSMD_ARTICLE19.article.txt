# Give 'em the Axe? Relic's history full of thefts
## 
### Kevin Wang 
The Big Game. The most im
portant game of the season for the
Stanford Cardinal.

All of the glamour surrounding
the event magnifies its signifi
cance. But to understand Big
Game's importance, you must
comprehend the tradition that
surrounds it. And to understand
Big Game's tradition, you must
grasp the Axe.
At first glance, it appears to be
no more than a piece of metal at
tached to a wooden plaque. But,
like Excalibur, the Axe is said to
have driven men insane when
they held its power in their
hands. It is a symbol of one of the
longest and most fiercely con
tested rivalries in college foot
ball. It is the coveted prize of Big
Game.

The awe-inspiring blade is cur
rently mounted upon a plaque
bearing the scores of past Big
Games. The plaque's heading
reads: "The Stanford Axe
Forged March 1899. Captured by
California April 15, 1899. Recap
tured by Stanford April 13, 1930.
To be awarded annually to the
winner of the Big Game."
Originally, the Axe was viewed
not merely as a trophy, but as a
mascot, a concrete depiction of the
pride and spirit of all Stanfordites.
It was the tree without the mulch.
The Axe has its origins in a
cheer devised in 1986. Will Irwin
and Chris Bradley, both of the
Stanford Class of 1898, coined the
still-chanted "Give 'em the Axe"
battle cry.
However, the idea of the Axe it
self didn't come until April 1899.
At the time, the Stanford baseball
team needed a morale boost. Play
ing for the intercollegiate champi
onship in a best-of-three series
against Cal, Stanford took a hard
first loss, and many fans felt that
the players needed special inspira
tion to bounce back.

Yell leader Billy Erb led a few

others in the purchase of a $4.50
rusty broad axe. He painted the
14-inch blade red and added a
four-foot-long handle. They un
veiled it at the huge bonfire rally
two nights before the second
game.
The crowd roared its approval,
and the Axe was brought to the

game two days later, with Erb
leading the Axe yell. He proceed
ed to hack a bear effigy into
shreds. However, the Axe had did
not alter the game's outcome.
The Bears went on to a 9-7 victo
ry and wrapped up the champi
onship.
The loss was so devastating

that Stanford fans paid little at
tention to safeguarding their new
symbol, and a group of Berke
leyans seized it. A wild chase en
sued through the streets of San
Francisco, but somehow the
thieves managed to board a ferry
to safety across the Bay.
Stanford was outraged by the

incident. Riots erupted between
the two schools, prompting Stan
ford President David starr Jordan
to publicly admonish the Stanford
student body. Eventually, both
schools agreed that the Axe now
belonged to Cal "by right of con-

Stanford was outraged by the inci
dent. Riots erupted between the two
schools, prompting Stanford Presi
dent David starr Jordan to publicly ad
monish the Stanford student body.
Eventually, both schools agreed that
the Axe now belonged to Cal "by right

ofconquest." Further raids of any kind
were prohibited. Nevertheless, recov
ery of the Axe remained an ardent pas
sion on the Farm, and plans for its
reacquisition were well underway.
However, Stanford's task was a
daunting one. Cal locked the Axe
in a bank vault at the American
Trust and displayed it only at an
nual rallies. Through such careful
safeguarding, Cal held onto the
precious hatchet for 31 long years.
In 1930, however, Stanford
fans decided it was time for the
Axe to return to its rightful owner.
"(The Axe is) estranged from the
Farm, its birth place, and subject
ed to the crazed gloating of its
malefactors," lamented a publica

tion known as the Stanford Quad.
A group of 21 Stanford stu
dents devised a scheme to wrest
back the holy relic.
On April 13, 1930, the night of
Cal's big rally, the "Immortal 21"
drove to the Berkeley campus
dressed as newspaper reporters
and Cal freshmen. As the rally
wound down, a group of the 21 ac
companied the Axe back to the
Jbank, where the others waited
with fake cameras and a home
made tear-gas bomb. The bogus
newsmen dazed the Axe's custodi
an with their cameras' blinding
flashes and, amid the fumes from
the exploding bomb, whisked
away the precious implement. The

Axe was back home on the Farm.
The Stanford Daily's headline
spread the joyous news the next
day. Its banner screamed "AXE
REGAINED" in enormous letters,
while across the Bay, the Daily Cal
ifornian cried "AXE STOLEN."
The "Immortal 21" were heroes.
As for the Axe, it spent the night in
Roble Hall and was later placed in
a steel vault at the Palo Alto Amer
ican Trust Bank.
After the heist, Cal students
bashed Stanford in The Californ
ian. They proposed making the Axe
the official trophy of the annual Big
Game, awarded to the victor. Stan
ford did not greet this idea enthusi
astically. A Daily editorial stated:

"The Axe is not and never was a tro
phy to be passed from hand to hand.
It is a symbol of Stanford. ... It is
not and never was California's."
The editorial went unheeded, and
the student body presidents of the
two schools signed the agreement in
1933, one that the two schools have
obeyed for the past 60 years.
Though the Axe may be 94
years old, the shiny blade remains
the ultimate symbol of a grand ri
valry. As the editor of the Stanford
Illustrated Review reflected on the
1930 capture of the Axe: "Just a
sharp piece of metal! But it repre
sents a unifying object a force
that holds us together .. . against
a friendly rival."

wound down, a group of the 21 ac
companied the Axe back to the
Jbank, where the others waited
with fake cameras and a home
made tear-gas bomb. The bogus
newsmen dazed the Axe's custodi
an with their cameras' blinding
flashes and, amid the fumes from
the exploding bomb, whisked
away the precious implement. The

Axe was back home on the Farm.
The Stanford Daily's headline
spread the joyous news the next
day. Its banner screamed "AXE
REGAINED" in enormous letters,
while across the Bay, the Daily Cal
ifornian cried "AXE STOLEN."
The "Immortal 21" were heroes.
As for the Axe, it spent the night in
Roble Hall and was later placed in
a steel vault at the Palo Alto Amer
ican Trust Bank.
After the heist, Cal students
bashed Stanford in The Californ
ian. They proposed making the Axe
the official trophy of the annual Big
Game, awarded to the victor. Stan
ford did not greet this idea enthusi
astically. A Daily editorial stated:

"The Axe is not and never was a tro
phy to be passed from hand to hand.
It is a symbol of Stanford. ... It is
not and never was California's."
The editorial went unheeded, and
the student body presidents of the
two schools signed the agreement in
1933, one that the two schools have
obeyed for the past 60 years.
Though the Axe may be 94
years old, the shiny blade remains
the ultimate symbol of a grand ri
valry. As the editor of the Stanford
Illustrated Review reflected on the
1930 capture of the Axe: "Just a
sharp piece of metal! But it repre
sents a unifying object a force
that holds us together .. . against
a friendly rival."
The Big Game. The most im
portant game of the season for the
Stanford Cardinal.

All of the glamour surrounding
the event magnifies its signifi
cance. But to understand Big
Game's importance, you must
comprehend the tradition that
surrounds it. And to understand
Big Game's tradition, you must
grasp the Axe.
At first glance, it appears to be
no more than a piece of metal at
tached to a wooden plaque. But,
like Excalibur, the Axe is said to
have driven men insane when
they held its power in their
hands. It is a symbol of one of the
longest and most fiercely con
tested rivalries in college foot
ball. It is the coveted prize of Big
Game.

The awe-inspiring blade is cur
rently mounted upon a plaque
bearing the scores of past Big
Games. The plaque's heading
reads: "The Stanford Axe
Forged March 1899. Captured by
California April 15, 1899. Recap
tured by Stanford April 13, 1930.
To be awarded annually to the
winner of the Big Game."
Originally, the Axe was viewed
not merely as a trophy, but as a
mascot, a concrete depiction of the
pride and spirit of all Stanfordites.
It was the tree without the mulch.
The Axe has its origins in a
cheer devised in 1986. Will Irwin
and Chris Bradley, both of the
Stanford Class of 1898, coined the
still-chanted "Give 'em the Axe"
battle cry.
However, the idea of the Axe it
self didn't come until April 1899.
At the time, the Stanford baseball
team needed a morale boost. Play
ing for the intercollegiate champi
onship in a best-of-three series
against Cal, Stanford took a hard
first loss, and many fans felt that
the players needed special inspira
tion to bounce back.

Yell leader Billy Erb led a few

others in the purchase of a $4.50
rusty broad axe. He painted the
14-inch blade red and added a
four-foot-long handle. They un
veiled it at the huge bonfire rally
two nights before the second
game.
The crowd roared its approval,
and the Axe was brought to the

game two days later, with Erb
leading the Axe yell. He proceed
ed to hack a bear effigy into
shreds. However, the Axe had did
not alter the game's outcome.
The Bears went on to a 9-7 victo
ry and wrapped up the champi
onship.
The loss was so devastating

that Stanford fans paid little at
tention to safeguarding their new
symbol, and a group of Berke
leyans seized it. A wild chase en
sued through the streets of San
Francisco, but somehow the
thieves managed to board a ferry
to safety across the Bay.
Stanford was outraged by the

incident. Riots erupted between
the two schools, prompting Stan
ford President David starr Jordan
to publicly admonish the Stanford
student body. Eventually, both
schools agreed that the Axe now
belonged to Cal "by right of con-

Eventually, both schools agreed that

were prohibited. Nevertheless, recov
ery of the Axe remained an ardent pas

reacquisition were well underway.
However, Stanford's task was a
daunting one. Cal locked the Axe
in a bank vault at the American
Trust and displayed it only at an
nual rallies. Through such careful
safeguarding, Cal held onto the
precious hatchet for 31 long years.
In 1930, however, Stanford
fans decided it was time for the
Axe to return to its rightful owner.
"(The Axe is) estranged from the
Farm, its birth place, and subject
ed to the crazed gloating of its
malefactors," lamented a publica

tion known as the Stanford Quad.
A group of 21 Stanford stu
dents devised a scheme to wrest
back the holy relic.
On April 13, 1930, the night of
Cal's big rally, the "Immortal 21"
drove to the Berkeley campus
