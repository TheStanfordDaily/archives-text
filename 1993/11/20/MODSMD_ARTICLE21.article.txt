## For 16 seniors, the Big Game is their last game 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
With experience a precious commodity
on the 1993 Cardinal football squad, a solid
core of seniors has stepped forward to lead
the young team through a season of adver
sity.
These seniors have never lost the Axe,
and today, for the last time in their careers,
they will take the field against the Golden
Bears.
"We've had so few experienced players
that the leadership of the seniors has really
been important," said head coach Bill
Walsh. "They've represented Stanford well
against the best teams in the country."
Every game and practice has been a
learning experience for the team, which
fields an incredible 20 true freshmen in
today's Big Game. But the dedicated group
of upperclassmen has been intent not only

on savoring their four years at Stanford, but
also in ensuring a successful future for the
program.
One such senior is cornerback Vaughn
Bryant, who began the season as the only
returning starter in the defensive backfield.
Coming into this year Bryant had started in
an impressive 25 straight games for the
Cardinal, teaming up with Darrien Gordon
last year to comprise one of the top safety
tandems in college football. Now, surround
ed by freshmen in the secondary, he has
taken on the role of teacher.
"This season's definitely had its ups and
downs, but I look at it as a positive experi
ence," said Bryant. "I've learned a lot of
lessons that I hope to take with me to the
next level." For Bryant, in all likelihood,
that next level will be the National Football
League.
Toby Norwood, who teams with Mark
Hatzenbuhler at inside linebacker, did not

get a chance to start on defense until last
season, playing his entire freshman and
sophomore years on special teams. A walk
on in 1990, Norwood impressed the coach
ing staff with his punishing hits and has de
veloped into one of the Cardinal's top defen
sive players.
"Obviously we've been looking forward
to [today]," said Norwood. "But we're just
treating it like any other game."
Defensive end Tyrone Parker, a fifth
year senior from Brooklyn, N.Y., has been a
solid player on defense for Stanford in the
past two seasons. The 6-foot-4-inch, 290-
pound defensive end recovered from a leg
injury in the offseason to return to the
starting lineup.
"[The Big Game] is why you lift all those
weights and do all that running," said Park
er. "It's the pinnacle. The teams have been
playing each other for over 100 years.
They're our rivals, and they're the team you

wish the best for during the season, but
when you play them you just want to beat
the hell out of them."
Coming into the season, the offensive
line was one of the most solid aspects of the
squad, with four starters returning. Fifth
year seniors Brian Cassidy, Glen Ca
vanaugh, Steve Hoyem and Jeff Bailey all
stepped forth to become on-and off-the-field
leaders.
Cavanaugh, who many expected to have
a career in professional football, was side
lined over a month ago with a back injury.
Many skeptics deemed the center's career
over, but after surgery to remove a disk
three weeks ago, Cavanaugh retains hope
that football will be in his future.
"I should be able to start lifting again in
a few weeks and I've had no real pain from
the injury," said the fifth-year senior. "I'm
