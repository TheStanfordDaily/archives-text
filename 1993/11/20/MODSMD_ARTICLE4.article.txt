# Stanford prepared to bait the Bears
## Offenses will duke it out for bragging rights and the Axe 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Editorial staff 
The game of the year has arrived for the
1993 Stanford Cardinal. Stanford will try to
make it five in a row against their adversaries
from the East Bay as the Cardinal and the
Golden Bears of California face off in the 96th
annual Big Game.
The game pits two of the finest quarter
backs in college football against one another.
Stanford senior Steve Stenstrom, who last
week eclipsed former Cardinal John Elway's
single-season passing and receptions records,
is ranked 16th in the nation with a 151.1 pass
ing efficiency rating, while Cal's Dave Barr is
ranked ninth with a 156.3 rating.
Both quarterbacks are coming off excellent
performances in their teams' victories a week
ago. Last week against Oregon, Stenstrom
completed 28 of his 37 passes for 407 yards and
three touchdowns in the Cardinal's 38-34 vic
tory over the Ducks in Eugene, while Barr com
pleted 20 of his 33 passes for 263 yards and one
touchdown in the Bears' huge win over Ari
zona in Berkeley.
Barr will lead a California team that has
been relatively successful this season. The
Golden Bears rolled out to an impressive 5-0
start and a No. 16 national ranking behind col
lege football's fourth-ranked scoring offense,
averaging 43.6 points a game. Included in that
start was one of the three most dramatic come
backs in college history, in which the Bears ral
lied from a 30-0 deficit to defeat Oregon 42-41.
The next part of Cal's season was an entire
ly different story. After Barr went down with a
separated shoulder in their game against
Washington, Cal proceeded to lose their next
four games by a combined 141-44 score.
After the first half of their game against the
Huskies, the Bears scored only 24 points over
the next 16 quarters. During that streak, the
Bears averaged only 207 yards of total offense
per game and gave up an average of 39.5 points
and 528 yards.
Cal coach Keith Gilbertson believes that
after last week's upset victory over Arizona,
the Bears' losing ways are behind them.
"[The losing streak] was tough on all of us. I
think it was more frustrating, since we felt that
we were a pretty good football team that had
had a lot of bad things happen," Gilbertson
said. "But I think this team has stayed togeth

er there wasn't any finger-pointing and
there wasn't any dissension."
Cardinal coach Bill Walsh had nothing but
positive remarks about the Golden Bears' per
formance this season.
"They could be a bowl team this year, and
wherever they went, I think they would repre
sent the Pac-10 very well," Walsh said.
Stanford has enjoyed possession of the Axe
for six years running after last year's 41-21
rout in Berkeley. In fact, the last time the Wee
nies had the Axe, Jack Elway was the Cardinal
coach and Ronald Reagan was the president of
the United States. No player on the Stanford
roster has ever lost to Cal, and conversely, no
Cal player on their current roster has ever
beaten Stanford.
If you like a high-scoring game, then get
your Big Game offensive record books out.
Today's game features two teams with offens
es that have lit up their respective school's
record books, and defenses that bring up the
rear in the Pac-10.
Stanford currently leads the Pac-10 in pass
ing offense, is second in total offense and third
in scoring offense, while Cal is second in scor
ing offense, seventh in total offense and fifth in
pass offense.
Similarly, both teams have struggled defen
sively. The Cardinal is dead last in the Pac-10
in scoring, passing and total defense, while the
Golden Bears are No. 8 in scoring defense, No.
9 in passing defense and No. 9 in total defense.
"We've had some problems with the forward
pass," Gilbertson said jokingly at a press con
ference.
The Cal coaching staff is aware of the Cardi
nal's passing prowess. "I have big respect for
[Stenstrom] as a leader and competitor,"
Gilbertson said. "He's a weapon, and I think
he's the top offensive player in our league, and
maybe in college football right now with his
numbers and the way he's producing for his
team."
Stenstrom has had one of the finest seasons
ever by a Cardinal quarterback. In addition to
breaking two of Elway's records last week,
Stenstrom needs only two pass attempts, two
touchdown passes and 34 yards of total offense
to break three more Cardinal records.
Stenstrom has been able to put up consis
tent numbers despite a rash of injuries to his
receivers and running backs. During the Ari
zona game five weeks ago, the Cardinal lost

split end Justin Armour, the Cardinal's leading
receiver, for two games with a separated shoul
der.
In addition, standout freshman wide receiv
er Brian Manning has been hobbled by a ham
string injury which he suffered in the same
game. He has still not fully recovered from the
injury and has missed the past four games.
Nagging injuries have also plagued Ellery
Roberts, Mike Mitchell and Vaughn Bryant,
but Cardinal coach Bill Walsh believes his play
ers will be well prepared to face Cal today.
"[Greg Cornelia] just played a marvelous
game last week [against Oregon], Mike
Mitchell appears to be healthy and played well
in practice yesterday, and Ellery Roberts is
100 percent now, and he just wasn't able to
play very much at all last week," Walsh said.
"So that part of [our injury situation] looks
good." Roberts, however, will back up the
healthier Greg Cornelia at fullback, with
Ethan Allen taking over at tailback.
Despite the team's disappointing 4-6 record,
Walsh believes many outstanding players have
developed throughout the 1993 season. He
says the freshmen that played extensively this
year gained valuable experience from playing
in the ten games on Stanford's difficult sched
ule, and expressed optimism about their
progress in 1994.
"Our entire freshman class will come back
as experienced players next spring, and that's
what we're looking forward to," Walsh said,
"They will certainly have command of what
they do, and they'll be veterans since many of
them have played in every game. That will be
something we can really build on."
"I am especially proud of Tony Cline. I think
he, in my opinion, is the finest tight end in the
Pac-10 he's the best blocking tight end and
also a fine receiver," Walsh said. "I think a year
from now, he'll be considered among the top
tight ends in the country."
The stage is set. Two teams that struggled
earlier in the season will battle it out today to
see who has improved more. This game will
be a litmus test for both Stanford and Cal.
For Cal, a victory would show that their first
five victories before their four-game losing
streak weren't just a result of scheduling
luck, and for Stanford, a victory would vindi
cate a disappointing season and lay a strong
foundation for 1994. They don't call it Big
Game for nothing.
