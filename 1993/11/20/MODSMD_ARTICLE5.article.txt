## Stenstrom shatters records, leads Cardinal into Big Game 
### Peter Marks Editorial staff 
Steve Stenstrom, Stanford's
best quarterback since John
Elway, walked off the field at Los
Angeles Coliseum after a long
evening's work two Saturdays
ago. His team had just suffered a
crushing 45-20 defeat at the
hands of USC, and Stenstrom
headed toward the locker room
with his high-school chum, Rob
Johnson, the Trojan quarterback.
Stenstrom and Johnson had
both put forth remarkable passing
games, racking up 263 and 372
yards, respectively. Now the two
players discussed each other's sea
sons and whether they'd enter the
NFL draft in June.
The NFL? It's been only four
years since Stenstrom was throw
ing touchdowns to Johnson, then
a receiver, at El Toro High School
in Orange County. Rob's father,
Bob, was their coach.
"I'm excited for both of us,"
said Stenstrom after the game.
"Things have worked out for us."
He talked about timing, about
how he and Johnson were lucky to
have been in the right place at the
right time in order to become their
team's starting quarterbacks,
both with a shot at the big time.
For a quarterback, timing is of
the essence. As the offensive
leader on the field, the quarter
back must know at all times how
much time he has to operate in
the quarter, in the game and in the
huddle. When he snaps the ball,
the quarterback again relies on
timing, using different cadences
to set his teammates in motion
and the play into action. And, of
course, when the quarterback
drops back to pass, he times his re
lease with his receiver's pattern.
This season, Stenstrom's tim
ing has been near-perfect. In last
week's game against the Oregon
Ducks, Stenstrom recorded his
eighth game of the season in
which he has passed for more than
300 yards, the benchmark at

which all QB's shoot. His 407
yards passing against the Ducks
lifted him past Stanford great
John Elway as the Pacific 10 Con
ference's leading passer for a sea
son. And with 3,281 cumulative
yards in '93 and today's game yet
to play, Stenstrom, like the Ener
gizer bunny, is still going.
Lest you ask, Stenstrom's
yardage hasn't come easily. There
haven't been any late, fourth
quarter assaults on the record
books once a game has been decid
ed. And he's done it against oppo
nents who knew he had to throw
the ball due to the Cardinal's lack
of a running game.
"Steve is one of the finest
passers in college football. If you
consider our competition and his
supporting cast, I'm sure he's the
best passer in college football,"
gushed Stanford coach Bill Walsh.
"Steve is able to function without
a real strong running game and
without a team that is playing
very strong defense."
Things weren't always this
promising for Stenstrom. When
he came to Stanford, the team al
ready had an established quarter
back in Jason Palumbis. There
were other highly touted quarter
back recruits competing for the
back-up job as well, including
John Lynch and Tommy Knecht.
While those two players eventual
ly changed positions, Stenstrom
stuck to quarterback and redshirt
ed his freshman year.
Riding the pine wasn't a posi
tion Stenstrom was used to. In
high school, he had been his
team's MVP, named to the Area
First Teams by the Orange Coun
ty Register and the Los Angeles
Times. Now, he was forced to
watch from the sidelines. But the
waiting period worked to Sten
strom's advantage, giving him
time to develop his skills.
"My parents have always
talked to me about it (timing.)
They stressed that to me. Don't

tiy to control things too much on
your own," said Stenstrom. "Things
happen for a reason and if the tim
ing is not right, it doesn't matter
who you are or what you're doing,
it's not going to work out right."
When the Cardinal stumbled
early on in the 1991-92 season,
however, coach Denny Green felt
it was time to make a change at
quarterback, and Stenstrom got
the call. Starting with Cornell, he
led the Cardinal to seven straight
victories in its final seven games.
Remarkably, Stenstrom had
begun the season ranked third on
the quarterback depth chart and
emerged as the top-ranked passer
in the Pac-10, and the 10th
ranked quarterback in the nation.
Good timing? You bet.
Stenstrom got another good
break when Bill Walsh, a quarter
back's coach, returned to the

Farm. Walsh replaced Green's
more conservative, run-oriented
offensive scheme with the multi
ple-set offense that made the San
Francisco 49ers Superbowl Cham
pions and Joe Montana a house
hold name.
"Being in Bill's system and
being around Bill really paid some
big dividends for Steve," said Cali
fornia coach, Keith Gilbertson.
"Coach Walsh has an incredible
knack for letting me know why
we're doing a certain play, what
my role is on that play and how to
help the offense be more success
ful, not only telling me but also ex
plaining why," said Stenstrom.
To say Stenstrom has flour
ished in Walsh's system is to make
an understatement. He went from
a tentative quarterback with good
mechanics to a leader who could
throw to the second and third re
ceivers on a play when the first
target was covered.
"In my mind (Steve is) ahead of
two-thirds of the NFL quarter
backs as to his knowledge, and his

mechanics and his decision mak
ing, and his command of the
game," said Walsh. "Now I'm not
comparing him as a better player
than two-thirds of the NFL quar
terbacks, but he certainly is far
ahead of many of them in his
knowledge and command and exe
cution."
Which brings up an interesting
question: Will Stenstrom, who has
one year of college eligibility re
maining, enter the NFL draft?
Stenstrom says he won't con
sider the idea until the season
ends today against Cal. In the
past, he has said he wanted to re
turn for one more season. And he
still thirsts to play in the Rose
Bowl.
But if scouts tell Stenstrom he
might be snatched up by a team in
the first 10 picks of the draft,
would he leave Stanford for NFL
dollars and glory?
"You never know what's going
to happen," he is fond of saying.
For Steve Stenstrom, the tim
ing will have to be perfect.

tiy to control things too much on
your own," said Stenstrom. "Things
happen for a reason and if the tim
ing is not right, it doesn't matter
who you are or what you're doing,
it's not going to work out right."
When the Cardinal stumbled
early on in the 1991-92 season,
however, coach Denny Green felt
it was time to make a change at
quarterback, and Stenstrom got
the call. Starting with Cornell, he
led the Cardinal to seven straight
victories in its final seven games.
Remarkably, Stenstrom had
begun the season ranked third on
the quarterback depth chart and
emerged as the top-ranked passer
in the Pac-10, and the 10th
ranked quarterback in the nation.
Good timing? You bet.
Stenstrom got another good
break when Bill Walsh, a quarter
back's coach, returned to the

Farm. Walsh replaced Green's
more conservative, run-oriented
offensive scheme with the multi
ple-set offense that made the San
Francisco 49ers Superbowl Cham
pions and Joe Montana a house
hold name.
"Being in Bill's system and
being around Bill really paid some
big dividends for Steve," said Cali
fornia coach, Keith Gilbertson.
"Coach Walsh has an incredible
knack for letting me know why
we're doing a certain play, what
my role is on that play and how to
help the offense be more success
ful, not only telling me but also ex
plaining why," said Stenstrom.
To say Stenstrom has flour
ished in Walsh's system is to make
an understatement. He went from
a tentative quarterback with good
mechanics to a leader who could
throw to the second and third re
ceivers on a play when the first
target was covered.
"In my mind (Steve is) ahead of
two-thirds of the NFL quarter
backs as to his knowledge, and his

mechanics and his decision mak
ing, and his command of the
game," said Walsh. "Now I'm not
comparing him as a better player
than two-thirds of the NFL quar
terbacks, but he certainly is far
ahead of many of them in his
knowledge and command and exe
cution."
Which brings up an interesting
question: Will Stenstrom, who has
one year of college eligibility re
maining, enter the NFL draft?
Stenstrom says he won't con
sider the idea until the season
ends today against Cal. In the
past, he has said he wanted to re
turn for one more season. And he
still thirsts to play in the Rose
Bowl.
But if scouts tell Stenstrom he
might be snatched up by a team in
the first 10 picks of the draft,
would he leave Stanford for NFL
dollars and glory?
"You never know what's going
to happen," he is fond of saying.
For Steve Stenstrom, the tim
ing will have to be perfect.
Steve Stenstrom, Stanford's
best quarterback since John
Elway, walked off the field at Los
Angeles Coliseum after a long
evening's work two Saturdays
ago. His team had just suffered a
crushing 45-20 defeat at the
hands of USC, and Stenstrom
headed toward the locker room
with his high-school chum, Rob
Johnson, the Trojan quarterback.
Stenstrom and Johnson had
both put forth remarkable passing
games, racking up 263 and 372
yards, respectively. Now the two
players discussed each other's sea
sons and whether they'd enter the
NFL draft in June.
The NFL? It's been only four
years since Stenstrom was throw
ing touchdowns to Johnson, then
a receiver, at El Toro High School
in Orange County. Rob's father,
Bob, was their coach.
"I'm excited for both of us,"
said Stenstrom after the game.
"Things have worked out for us."
He talked about timing, about
how he and Johnson were lucky to
have been in the right place at the
right time in order to become their
team's starting quarterbacks,
both with a shot at the big time.
For a quarterback, timing is of
the essence. As the offensive
leader on the field, the quarter
back must know at all times how
much time he has to operate in
the quarter, in the game and in the
huddle. When he snaps the ball,
the quarterback again relies on
timing, using different cadences
to set his teammates in motion
and the play into action. And, of
course, when the quarterback
drops back to pass, he times his re
lease with his receiver's pattern.
This season, Stenstrom's tim
ing has been near-perfect. In last
week's game against the Oregon
Ducks, Stenstrom recorded his
eighth game of the season in
which he has passed for more than
300 yards, the benchmark at

which all QB's shoot. His 407
yards passing against the Ducks
lifted him past Stanford great
John Elway as the Pacific 10 Con
ference's leading passer for a sea
son. And with 3,281 cumulative
yards in '93 and today's game yet
to play, Stenstrom, like the Ener
gizer bunny, is still going.
Lest you ask, Stenstrom's
yardage hasn't come easily. There
haven't been any late, fourth
quarter assaults on the record
books once a game has been decid
ed. And he's done it against oppo
nents who knew he had to throw
the ball due to the Cardinal's lack
of a running game.
"Steve is one of the finest
passers in college football. If you
consider our competition and his
supporting cast, I'm sure he's the
best passer in college football,"
gushed Stanford coach Bill Walsh.
"Steve is able to function without
a real strong running game and
without a team that is playing
very strong defense."
Things weren't always this
promising for Stenstrom. When
he came to Stanford, the team al
ready had an established quarter
back in Jason Palumbis. There
were other highly touted quarter
back recruits competing for the
back-up job as well, including
John Lynch and Tommy Knecht.
While those two players eventual
ly changed positions, Stenstrom
stuck to quarterback and redshirt
ed his freshman year.
Riding the pine wasn't a posi
tion Stenstrom was used to. In
high school, he had been his
team's MVP, named to the Area
First Teams by the Orange Coun
ty Register and the Los Angeles
Times. Now, he was forced to
watch from the sidelines. But the
waiting period worked to Sten
strom's advantage, giving him
time to develop his skills.
