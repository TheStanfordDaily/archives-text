# Beware of the Bear
## Barr steps out of shadows to spark California 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
At home on the Farm we have
been inundated with information
about the exploits of our outstand
ing quarterback, Steve Stenstrom.
Almost every week we hear about
which Pacific 10 Conference and
Stanford records the prolific pass
er has broken in his most recent

adventure. Therefore it should
come as no surprise that at today's
Big Game, many more long-stand
ing marks are in danger of falling.
However, Stenstrom will not be
the only highly-touted passer in
Stanford Stadium today. His Cali
fornia counterpart, Dave Barr, is
an accomplished quarterback in
his own right, and, if overlooked,
mav lead Cal to its first win over

the Cardinal since 1986.
Barr, an East Bay native, be
came the Bears' starter in the
midst of last season after previous
starter Perry Klein was lost to in
jury. When California head coach
Keith Gilbertson did not reinstate
Klein as quickly as the quarter
back would have liked, Klein quit
the team, giving Barr the job by
default.

Before last season, Barr had
never thrown a college pass, but he
stepped in and set a record for
yards thrown in a season by a
sophomore with 2,343. By shred
ding a stingy Arizona defense, he
earned an ironclad grip on the
starting quarterback position for
this season.
Barr has only improved since
last season. He, not Stenstrom,
leads the Pac-10 in passing effi
ciency with a lofty 156.31 rating.
The junior ranks fourth in total of
fense in the conference despite
having missed one game and large
parts of three others. All told this
year, Barr has amassed 1,975
yards and 16 touchdowns in the
air on a 66.2 completion percent
age.
Barr was the main ingredient in
Cal's fast start this season, leading
the team to a 5-0 record. He played
especially well in a 42-41 win over
Oregon, a game in which Cal at
one point trailed by 30 points. In
that contest, one of the greatest
comebacks in college football his
tory, Barr rallied his team with
368 yards and three touchdowns.
The dream season was not to
last, though. In the year's sixth
game against Washington, Barr
injured his shoulder early in the
second half and left the game. In
his absence, the team fell apart,
blowing a big lead and eventually
losing the game to the Huskies.
After sitting out a 34-7 loss to
Washington State, Barr saw limit
ed action in the next two games,
both defeats, before being pulled
because of a combination of inef
fectiveness and shoulder pain.
"When we lost Barr, we weren't
the same football team," said
Gilbertson.
Stanford head coach Bill Walsh
agreed. "He is the very essence of
their game," said Walsh. "He's the
key to the whole football team."
Luckily for Cal, Barr returned
in last week's game against Ari
zona. Still not at 100 percent, he
struggled initially against the
Wildcats' vaunted defense, so
much so that Cal offensive coordi
nator Denny Schuler almost
pulled him.
But Barr and the Bears rallied

in the second period, overcoming a
20-point deficit to win 24-20.
First, Barr completed a 10-yard
touchdown pass to spark the Cali
fornia scoring spurt. Then, in the
drive that would bring Cal its sec
ond touchdown, Barr connected
on three long passes for first
downs to keep the pivotal drive
alive.
"I don't know that he felt too
good about his shoulder going into
last week (against Arizona), but I
think he made a decision at half
time that I'm going to compete
and throw it and lead my team,"
said Gilbertson.
Hopefully for the Bears, it will
be this Dave Barr, the inspired
Dave Barr, that shows up Satur
day.
Walsh, for one, is wary of the
Cal junior. "He's very quick on his
feet a lot more mobile than I ex
pected him to be," said the Cardi
nal coach. "He can evade and make
people miss. He's got a fine arm
and he's a winner no question
about it. I think he has a pro fu
ture ahead of him."
The Cardinal will have to con
tend with this Golden Bear's abili
ty to claw though opponents' sec
ondaries, and must realize that
with Dave Barr at the helm, no
lead is safe.

'He can evade
and make people
miss. He's got a
fine arm and he's
a winner no
question about it.
I think he has a
pro future ahead
of him.'

Cal quarterback Dave Barr scrambles to get free from a Cardinal defender in last year's Big Game at
Berkeley. After suffering a shoulder injury that kept him out of action for four weeks, Barr returned to his
early season form in Cat's victory over Arizona last week.
