## Cardinal falters, but lays a foundation for next-season success 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
This is it. The moment the Bay Area has
been waiting for since the beginning of the
season. It's Stanford vs. California, Big
Game, and bragging rights are up for grabs.
After this contest, everyone who attends
California will either remain silent until
next November or forever remind passers
by of how they took the Axe back in 1993.
Before we jump into today's matchup be
tween the Cardinal and the Golden Bears,
let's take a look back at the Cardinal's 1993
season and then peer into the mythical car
dinal-and-white-striped crystal ball and
look ahead to 1994.
Stanford's season to date could best be
described as disappointing. Picked by many
college football analysts to win the Pacific
10 Conference after Washington's suspen
sion, Stanford has not lived up to expecta
tions. The Cardinal is currently 4-6, and
possesses a dismal 3-5 record in the Pac-10.
This sub-.500 conference mark is a signifi
cant reversal from last year's Pac-10 co-
Championship.
There have been several causes of the
downturn in Stanford's fortunes this year.
Perhaps the greatest change from last sea
son's Blockbuster-Bowl squad was the grad
uation of one of the finest classes of football
players Stanford has ever produced. This
exodus included outside linebackers Ron
George and Dave Garnett, defensive backs
Darrien Gordon and John Lynch and run
ning back Glyn Milburn, all of whom are
having exceptional rookie seasons in the
NFL.
As a result of these losses, a defensive
unit that had been ranked second in the
Pac-10 last season has struggled consider
ably, placing dead last in every defensive

category while giving up an average 0f455.9
yards of total offense and 34.3 points per
game.
This year, freshmen are being asked to
fill the positions formerly held by All-Amer
ican and All-Pac-10 linebackers and defen

sive backs. However, to their credit, the
freshmen have made significant strides
since the beginning of the season and have
had 10 games' worth of experience against
some of the best teams in college football.
Another significant problem the Cardi

nal has faced is the lack of a dominant run
ning attack. Just two years ago, the Cardi
nal led the conference in rushing, with star
backs Tommy Vardell and Glyn Milburn

Stanford defenders Jason Fisk and Mark Hatzenbuhler stop Oregon State's J.J. Young in his tracks
carrying the bulk of the load. Even
last season, the Cardinal had one
of the best rushing offenses in the
Pac-10, with Milburn as well as
Ellery Roberts making significant
contributions.
This season has been an alto
gether different story. Stanford is
last in the Pac-10 in rushing of
fense, averaging a paltry 70.5
yards per game. No running back
for the Cardinal has rushed for
over 100 yards in a single game
this season. Roberts has been
slowed by injuries and freshman
Mike Mitchell has struggled due to
inexperience, forcing Stanford to
go to the air more than Bill Walsh
would prefer.
However, airing it out has not
been such a bad idea this year, with
quarterback Steve Stenstrom as
the offense's pilot. Stenstrom has
had a monumental season; he has
already passed John Elway as the
Pac-10 single-season passing
yardage leader and will build upon
his total in today's game. An even
more amazing fact is that Sten
strom still has another year of eli
gibility, and plans to use it.
Even with Stenstrom, before
Cardinal fans start reserving Rose
Bowl tickets for next season they
should consider what constitutes
a Pac-10 champion. An explosive
offense can only take a team so far;
defense is what wins champi

onships just ask Heisman Tro
phy winner Ty Detmer or David
Klingler. Indeed, it has been the
Cardinal's defense which has lift
ed it to its greatest successes. For
example, it was no coincidence
that the last two seasons each
culminating in a bowl appearance
have featured the strongest de
fenses proffered by the Cardinal in
decades.
And, after the defense fiascoes
of 1993, it is safe to say that there
is only room for improvement for
Stanford. Stanford coach Bill
Walsh has repeatedly emphasized
that the talent level on defense is
still extremely high, but the expe
rience is lacking. With a year of ex
perience against some of college
football's best teams, the young
Cardinal defense will soon mature
and perhaps even adopt an intimi
dating personality of its own.
Along with Stenstrom, the
1994 Cardinal has a recipe for suc
cess. First, start with a rejuvenat
ed running attack led by sopho
mores-to-be Mitchell and Greg
Cornelia. Then add an explosive
wide receiving corps which in
cludes Justin Armour, Brian Man
ning, Andre Kirwan and Mark
Harris. Sift in a quarterback that
knows how to utilize these offen
sive weapons. Blend in a defense
markedly improved by a pinch of
seasoning. Then, allow coach/chef
Walsh to mix these ingredients
and form a treat for Cardinal play
ers and fans alike. In fact, a cer
tain bakery in Pasadena may place
an order for Jan. 1.

fenses proffered by the Cardinal in
decades.
And, after the defense fiascoes
of 1993, it is safe to say that there
is only room for improvement for
Stanford. Stanford coach Bill
Walsh has repeatedly emphasized
that the talent level on defense is
still extremely high, but the expe
rience is lacking. With a year of ex
perience against some of college
football's best teams, the young
Cardinal defense will soon mature
and perhaps even adopt an intimi
dating personality of its own.
Along with Stenstrom, the
1994 Cardinal has a recipe for suc
cess. First, start with a rejuvenat
ed running attack led by sopho
mores-to-be Mitchell and Greg
Cornelia. Then add an explosive
wide receiving corps which in
cludes Justin Armour, Brian Man
ning, Andre Kirwan and Mark
Harris. Sift in a quarterback that
knows how to utilize these offen
sive weapons. Blend in a defense
markedly improved by a pinch of
seasoning. Then, allow coach/chef
Walsh to mix these ingredients
and form a treat for Cardinal play
ers and fans alike. In fact, a cer
tain bakery in Pasadena may place
an order for Jan. 1.

Freshman wide receiver Brian Manning breaks away from pursuing Notre Dame defenders. Manning has
established himself as a potent deep threat and will see significant action in 1994.
This is it. The moment the Bay Area has
been waiting for since the beginning of the
season. It's Stanford vs. California, Big
Game, and bragging rights are up for grabs.
After this contest, everyone who attends
California will either remain silent until
next November or forever remind passers
by of how they took the Axe back in 1993.
Before we jump into today's matchup be
tween the Cardinal and the Golden Bears,
let's take a look back at the Cardinal's 1993
season and then peer into the mythical car
dinal-and-white-striped crystal ball and
look ahead to 1994.
Stanford's season to date could best be
described as disappointing. Picked by many
college football analysts to win the Pacific
10 Conference after Washington's suspen
sion, Stanford has not lived up to expecta
tions. The Cardinal is currently 4-6, and
possesses a dismal 3-5 record in the Pac-10.
This sub-.500 conference mark is a signifi
cant reversal from last year's Pac-10 co-
Championship.
There have been several causes of the
downturn in Stanford's fortunes this year.
Perhaps the greatest change from last sea
son's Blockbuster-Bowl squad was the grad
uation of one of the finest classes of football
players Stanford has ever produced. This
exodus included outside linebackers Ron
George and Dave Garnett, defensive backs
Darrien Gordon and John Lynch and run
ning back Glyn Milburn, all of whom are
having exceptional rookie seasons in the
NFL.
As a result of these losses, a defensive
unit that had been ranked second in the
Pac-10 last season has struggled consider
ably, placing dead last in every defensive

category while giving up an average 0f455.9
yards of total offense and 34.3 points per
game.
This year, freshmen are being asked to
fill the positions formerly held by All-Amer
ican and All-Pac-10 linebackers and defen

sive backs. However, to their credit, the
freshmen have made significant strides
since the beginning of the season and have
had 10 games' worth of experience against
some of the best teams in college football.
Another significant problem the Cardi

nal has faced is the lack of a dominant run
ning attack. Just two years ago, the Cardi
nal led the conference in rushing, with star
backs Tommy Vardell and Glyn Milburn

Stanford defenders Jason Fisk and Mark Hatzenbuhler stop Oregon State's J.J. Young in his tracks
carrying the bulk of the load. Even
last season, the Cardinal had one
of the best rushing offenses in the
Pac-10, with Milburn as well as
Ellery Roberts making significant
contributions.
This season has been an alto
gether different story. Stanford is
last in the Pac-10 in rushing of
fense, averaging a paltry 70.5
yards per game. No running back
for the Cardinal has rushed for
over 100 yards in a single game
this season. Roberts has been
slowed by injuries and freshman
Mike Mitchell has struggled due to
inexperience, forcing Stanford to
go to the air more than Bill Walsh
would prefer.
However, airing it out has not
been such a bad idea this year, with
quarterback Steve Stenstrom as
the offense's pilot. Stenstrom has
had a monumental season; he has
already passed John Elway as the
Pac-10 single-season passing
yardage leader and will build upon
his total in today's game. An even
more amazing fact is that Sten
strom still has another year of eli
gibility, and plans to use it.
Even with Stenstrom, before
Cardinal fans start reserving Rose
Bowl tickets for next season they
should consider what constitutes
a Pac-10 champion. An explosive
offense can only take a team so far;
defense is what wins champi

onships just ask Heisman Tro
phy winner Ty Detmer or David
Klingler. Indeed, it has been the
Cardinal's defense which has lift
ed it to its greatest successes. For
example, it was no coincidence
that the last two seasons each
culminating in a bowl appearance
have featured the strongest de
fenses proffered by the Cardinal in
decades.
