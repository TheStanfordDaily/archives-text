## Cardinal falters, but lays a foundation for next-season success 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
This is it. The moment the Bay Area has
been waiting for since the beginning of the
season. It's Stanford vs. California, Big
Game, and bragging rights are up for grabs.
After this contest, everyone who attends
California will either remain silent until
next November or forever remind passers
by of how they took the Axe back in 1993.
Before we jump into today's matchup be
tween the Cardinal and the Golden Bears,
let's take a look back at the Cardinal's 1993
season and then peer into the mythical car
dinal-and-white-striped crystal ball and
look ahead to 1994.
Stanford's season to date could best be
described as disappointing. Picked by many
college football analysts to win the Pacific
10 Conference after Washington's suspen
sion, Stanford has not lived up to expecta
tions. The Cardinal is currently 4-6, and
possesses a dismal 3-5 record in the Pac-10.
This sub-.500 conference mark is a signifi
cant reversal from last year's Pac-10 co-
Championship.
There have been several causes of the
downturn in Stanford's fortunes this year.
Perhaps the greatest change from last sea
son's Blockbuster-Bowl squad was the grad
uation of one of the finest classes of football
players Stanford has ever produced. This
exodus included outside linebackers Ron
George and Dave Garnett, defensive backs
Darrien Gordon and John Lynch and run
ning back Glyn Milburn, all of whom are
having exceptional rookie seasons in the
NFL.
As a result of these losses, a defensive
unit that had been ranked second in the
Pac-10 last season has struggled consider
ably, placing dead last in every defensive

category while giving up an average 0f455.9
yards of total offense and 34.3 points per
game.
This year, freshmen are being asked to
fill the positions formerly held by All-Amer
ican and All-Pac-10 linebackers and defen

sive backs. However, to their credit, the
freshmen have made significant strides
since the beginning of the season and have
had 10 games' worth of experience against
some of the best teams in college football.
Another significant problem the Cardi

nal has faced is the lack of a dominant run
ning attack. Just two years ago, the Cardi
nal led the conference in rushing, with star
backs Tommy Vardell and Glyn Milburn
