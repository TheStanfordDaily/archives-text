# Surprise! Big Game ain't over until the...
## From 'Super-Cal' to The Play, dramatic finishes abound in Cal-Stanford contests

They don't call it Big Game for
nothin', baby.
Whatever expectations you
bring with you today for the 96th
Big Game, prepare to leave them
at the gate. Once you step inside
Stanford Stadium, you've entered
a world Rod Serling and O. Henry
would be proud of. Since 1892,
Stanford and California have
clashed on the gridiron almost
every November. In those hun
dred-odd matchups, there have
been endings that have trans
formed would-be heroes into
goats, made legends and, at times,
baffled the imaginations of play
ers, fans and coaches alike.
Indians Blast 'Super-Cal'
Myth
1950: Stanford 7, California 7
Cal's 1950 team was touted at
the time as perhaps its greatest
ever. Coached by. Lynn "Pappy"
Waldorf and led by standout full
back Johnny Olszewski, who aver
aged 9.7 yards a carry, the unde
feated Golden Bears were headed
to the Rose Bowl and were highly

favored over Stanford.
But in the true manner of Stan
ford teams past and those yet to
come, the then-named Indians, led
by quarterback Gary Kerkorkian,
nullified the Golden Bears' offense
and mustered some of their own.
Down 7-0, Kerkorkian ran the
flea-flicker to perfection, hitting
Boyd Benson to tie the game and
spoil Cal's perfect season.
Jim Marinos, the Cal quarter
back, told it like it was: "Stanford
simply played the game it was capa
ble of. And that was pretty good."
One, two, three, kick!
1974: Stanford 22, California
20
Cal seemed headed for victory.
Despite its best efforts, the Cardi
nal could not stop Cal's standout
quarterback Steve Bartowski
from leading the Bears the length
of the field and hitting Steve
Rivera for the go-ahead touch
down with only 33 seconds to play.
Down 20-19, the Cardinal could
only pray for a miracle.
Fortunately, they had quarter
back Guy Benjamin. With only 23
seconds remaining and deep in its

own territory, Benjamin pushed
the Cardinal upfield to the Cal 33-
yard line. Somehow, the Cardinal
had given themselves a chance at
victory.
The destiny of an entire team
came to rest on the foot of place
kicker Mike Langford. Langford
had hit two field goals already, but
this final attempt was a 50-yarder,
and there were only seconds left
on the clock.
Of course, he hit it, and Stan
ford had won.
*Was Langford ecstatic? What
did he think of his game—winning
field goal?
"I just saw people running at
me," he said.
"What the hell was going on?"
The Play.
1982: California 25, Stanford
20
It was another classic game
that came down to the final
minute. The Cardinal was down
19-17, deep in their own territory.
But from the Stanford 20, John
Elway engineered one of the most
sensational drives in Cardinal his
tory. The surge culminated in a

35-yard field goal with four sec
onds left, sending the Stanford
contingent into ecstasy.

With only four seconds left,
most games are over.
Harmon squib-kicked the ensu
ing kickoff, and it was fielded at
the 43 by Cal's Kevin Moen. Moen
immediately pitched to Richard
Rodgers, who was hit almost in
stantaneously but somehow man
aged to lateral to Dwight Garner.
Garner was swarmed by Cardinal
players and thrown to the ground.
Stanford fans, coaches, and play
ers thought Garner had been tack
led.
"I saw one official do this, im
plying he was down," said nose
guard Terry Jackson, moving his
arms back and forth like an um
pire signaling safe. "Then I see
this guy running with the ball. I
didn't know what the hell was
going on."
A few players began to move
onto the field to celebrate. The band
moved into the far end zone. But
the play wasn't over. Rodgers had
gotten the ball back from Garner
and was streaking downfield. The
Cardinal had stopped pursuing for a

moment but then desperately
sprinted after Rodgers. They
caught him, but not before he
pitched to Marion Ford, who raced
to the 20 and then blindly flipped
the ball over his head. It was caught
by Moen, who ran straight over one
of the band members into the end
zone and collegiate football history.
The greatest ever? 'Til the fat
lady sings. ..
1990: Stanford 27, California
25
Twelve seconds isn't much
time, but that was all it took for
the Cardinal to change defeat into
victory in perhaps the most dra
matic Big Game in the 100-year ri
valry.
Cal looked impressive early on,
building a 25-17 lead with minutes
left in the game. But in the man
ner of Kerkorkian and Elway,
Stanford quarterback Jason
Palumbis rose to the occasion.

In 1:25, Palumbis moved the
Cardinal 87 yards, finally hitting
All-American Ed McCaffrey in the
corner of the end zone on a beauti
fully thrown timing pattern. Stan
ford was down by one. The Cardi
nal then went for the two-point
conversion.
Palumbis dropped back and
launched the pass into the end
zone, but Cal cornerback John
Hardy intercepted. With twelve
seconds on the clock thousands of
California students mobbed the
field. In the stands, the Stanford
fans were stunned. Victory had
been only a point away.
But twelve seconds still re
mained, and the officials cleared the
Bear boosters from the field. Cal
was penalized 15 yards for delay of
game, which was imposed on the
kickoff. While Cal celebrated, Stan
ford lined up for the onside kick.
Hopkins' kickoff was perfect,
bouncing in and out of the arms of
Cal's standout running back Rus
sell White. Stanford recovered at
the Cal 37 and had another chance
at victory.

Palumbis tried to pass to Mc-
Caffrey, but his throw was incom
plete. But Cal's John Belli was
called for roughing the passer, and
the Cardinal moved to the Cal 22.
After another incompletion, it was
time for John Hopkins.
Hopkins had already kicked
four field goals in the game. And
with five seconds remaining, he
hit his fifth, a 39-yarder that
sailed straight through. Cal's fans
were shocked into silence while
Stanford fans exploded onto the
field, celebrating the most dramat
ic finish of any Big Game.

Rodgers, who was hit almost in
stantaneously but somehow man
aged to lateral to Dwight Garner.
Garner was swarmed by Cardinal
players and thrown to the ground.
Stanford fans, coaches, and play
ers thought Garner had been tack
led.
"I saw one official do this, im
plying he was down," said nose
guard Terry Jackson, moving his
arms back and forth like an um
pire signaling safe. "Then I see
this guy running with the ball. I
didn't know what the hell was
going on."
A few players began to move
onto the field to celebrate. The band
moved into the far end zone. But
the play wasn't over. Rodgers had
gotten the ball back from Garner
and was streaking downfield. The
Cardinal had stopped pursuing for a

moment but then desperately
sprinted after Rodgers. They
caught him, but not before he
pitched to Marion Ford, who raced
to the 20 and then blindly flipped
the ball over his head. It was caught
by Moen, who ran straight over one
of the band members into the end
zone and collegiate football history.
The greatest ever? 'Til the fat
lady sings. ..
1990: Stanford 27, California
25
Twelve seconds isn't much
time, but that was all it took for
the Cardinal to change defeat into
victory in perhaps the most dra
matic Big Game in the 100-year ri
valry.
Cal looked impressive early on,
building a 25-17 lead with minutes
left in the game. But in the man
ner of Kerkorkian and Elway,
Stanford quarterback Jason
Palumbis rose to the occasion.

In 1:25, Palumbis moved the
Cardinal 87 yards, finally hitting
All-American Ed McCaffrey in the
corner of the end zone on a beauti
fully thrown timing pattern. Stan
ford was down by one. The Cardi
nal then went for the two-point
conversion.
Palumbis dropped back and
launched the pass into the end
zone, but Cal cornerback John
Hardy intercepted. With twelve
seconds on the clock thousands of
California students mobbed the
field. In the stands, the Stanford
fans were stunned. Victory had
been only a point away.
But twelve seconds still re
mained, and the officials cleared the
Bear boosters from the field. Cal
was penalized 15 yards for delay of
game, which was imposed on the
kickoff. While Cal celebrated, Stan
ford lined up for the onside kick.
Hopkins' kickoff was perfect,
bouncing in and out of the arms of
Cal's standout running back Rus
sell White. Stanford recovered at
the Cal 37 and had another chance
at victory.

Palumbis tried to pass to Mc-
Caffrey, but his throw was incom
plete. But Cal's John Belli was
called for roughing the passer, and
the Cardinal moved to the Cal 22.
After another incompletion, it was
time for John Hopkins.
Hopkins had already kicked
four field goals in the game. And
with five seconds remaining, he
hit his fifth, a 39-yarder that
sailed straight through. Cal's fans
were shocked into silence while
Stanford fans exploded onto the
field, celebrating the most dramat
ic finish of any Big Game.

They don't call it Big Game for
nothin', baby.
Whatever expectations you
bring with you today for the 96th
Big Game, prepare to leave them
at the gate. Once you step inside
Stanford Stadium, you've entered
a world Rod Serling and O. Henry
would be proud of. Since 1892,
Stanford and California have
clashed on the gridiron almost
every November. In those hun
dred-odd matchups, there have
been endings that have trans
formed would-be heroes into
goats, made legends and, at times,
baffled the imaginations of play
ers, fans and coaches alike.
Indians Blast 'Super-Cal'
Myth
1950: Stanford 7, California 7
Cal's 1950 team was touted at
the time as perhaps its greatest
ever. Coached by. Lynn "Pappy"
Waldorf and led by standout full
back Johnny Olszewski, who aver
aged 9.7 yards a carry, the unde
feated Golden Bears were headed
to the Rose Bowl and were highly

favored over Stanford.
But in the true manner of Stan
ford teams past and those yet to
come, the then-named Indians, led
by quarterback Gary Kerkorkian,
nullified the Golden Bears' offense
and mustered some of their own.
Down 7-0, Kerkorkian ran the
flea-flicker to perfection, hitting
Boyd Benson to tie the game and
spoil Cal's perfect season.
Jim Marinos, the Cal quarter
back, told it like it was: "Stanford
simply played the game it was capa
ble of. And that was pretty good."
One, two, three, kick!
1974: Stanford 22, California
20
Cal seemed headed for victory.
Despite its best efforts, the Cardi
nal could not stop Cal's standout
quarterback Steve Bartowski
from leading the Bears the length
of the field and hitting Steve
Rivera for the go-ahead touch
down with only 33 seconds to play.
Down 20-19, the Cardinal could
only pray for a miracle.
Fortunately, they had quarter
back Guy Benjamin. With only 23
seconds remaining and deep in its

own territory, Benjamin pushed
the Cardinal upfield to the Cal 33-
yard line. Somehow, the Cardinal
had given themselves a chance at
victory.
The destiny of an entire team
came to rest on the foot of place
kicker Mike Langford. Langford
had hit two field goals already, but
this final attempt was a 50-yarder,
and there were only seconds left
on the clock.
Of course, he hit it, and Stan
ford had won.
*Was Langford ecstatic? What
did he think of his game—winning
field goal?
"I just saw people running at
me," he said.
"What the hell was going on?"
The Play.
1982: California 25, Stanford
20
It was another classic game
that came down to the final
minute. The Cardinal was down
19-17, deep in their own territory.
But from the Stanford 20, John
Elway engineered one of the most
sensational drives in Cardinal his
tory. The surge culminated in a

35-yard field goal with four sec
onds left, sending the Stanford
contingent into ecstasy.

With only four seconds left,
most games are over.
Harmon squib-kicked the ensu
ing kickoff, and it was fielded at
the 43 by Cal's Kevin Moen. Moen
immediately pitched to Richard
Rodgers, who was hit almost in
stantaneously but somehow man
aged to lateral to Dwight Garner.
