Semien has been the Golden
Bears' big-play receiver this sea
son, leading the team with an av
erage of 15.9 yards per reception.
A deep threat, he hooked up with
quarterback Dave Barr on a 72-
yard touchdown pass in the Bears'
victory over Oregon, Cal's longest
pass play from scrimmage.
Bryant, a senior, sparks an inex
perienced yet rapidly improving
Cardinal secondary. He leads the
team with two interceptions and
is fourth on the team with 60 tack
les.

Chapman has successfully filled
the shoes of Cal's graduated phe
nom, Russell White. Chapman
leads the Golden Bears in rushing
and is second on the team in scoring
with nine touchdowns. His light
ning-quick speed has netted him a
healthy five yards per carry, includ
ing a 61-yard touchdown run
against Oregon. Due to injuries to
starting tailback Ellery Roberts
and backup Mike Mitchell, Allen
was forced into a starting role at
tailback last week in Eugene. He re
sponded by rushing for 82 yards on
18 carries, the second-best rushing
output by a Cardinal running back
this year.

Steussie, an All-America candi
date, has been a phenomenal run
and-pass blocker at weakside
tackle for the Golden Bears. The
6-6, 305-pound senior will be
quite an obstacle to the Cardinal's
pass rush. Last week, Steussie
made his 44th consecutive start at
offensive tackle, a testament to
his durability. Parker, a 6-4, 290-
pound, fifth-year senior, will duel
with Steussie in the trenches and
try to shake up the Cal offense.
Parker is second on the Cardinal
in fumble recoveries, and will look
to force more turnovers in his last
college game.

Willard captains a blitzing and ag
gressive Cal defense. He is one of
11 Dick Butkus Award semi-final
ists, presented annually to the top
linebacker in the nation. Willard
has recorded 90 tackles, 55 of
them unassisted, over the last six
games, a phenomenal average of
15 tackles a game. Armour has
been nothing short of phenome
nal himself this season, leading
the Cardinal in receptions, receiv
ing yardage, and touchdowns. He
was slowed by a shoulder injury
that forced him to miss two
games, but has caught seven pases
for 130 yards since returning to
the starting lineup against USC.

In its 96-year history, Big Game
has often been decided by a field
goal or less, and Brien and
Abrams are two of the best in the
business. Brien, a senior, leads
Cal in scoring with 66 points, and
has connected on 11 of 14 field
goal attempts, including a 52-
yarder against Washington.
Abrams, in his second year as the
Cardinal placekicker, has made 10
of 16 field goals, including a 47-
yarder against USC, and leads the
Cardinal in scoring with 62
points.

As revealed in this year's Play
boy's Girls of the Pac-10 issue,
Cal's Jennie Jouett writes fantasy
novels for children. She lists rid
ing mountain bikes, weightlifting
and jet-skiing as her hobbies. In
her four years at Stanford, Jus
tine Mattera taught aerobics,
rowed varsity crew and was on the
synchronized swimming team.
She listed scandals as her hobby.
But who looks at this immoral
filth, anyway?
