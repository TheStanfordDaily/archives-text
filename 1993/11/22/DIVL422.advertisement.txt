"Breast cancer patients need
someone to touch base with ...
someone who'll listen to them,
understand what they are talking
about medically, and take the
time to answer their questions.
I shcnv them things that are part
of their treatment. I provide the
information in a less stressful
situation and tr\/ to take all the
mystique out of it.
"I don't mind putting myself on
the line each time. Having
patients feel they've got a handle
on what's going on gives me a
great deal of satisfaction. They're
not taking from me. They 're
giving me a whole lot."
