Lincoln Caplan
ifilf- author of
SKADDEN: Power,
| Wand and the Rise of a
Legal Empire
(Published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux)
"Illuminating, extraordinarily candid history of the mega-law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &
Flom—one of a handful of firms that, within the last 20 years, have fundamentally changed the
American law business...A convincing portrait in microcosm of the transformation of a once-sleepy
profession into a giant, though troubled, global industry."
—Kirkus Reviews
"In the 1980's, Skadden Arps led the pack of law firms into the entrepreneurial, hardball, exhausting,
meritocratic but money-hungry culture of corporate practice that now prevails. Lincoln Caplan tells
that story superbly. Better than anyone else, he has seen through to the craziness at the core of
today's law practice. Satirical and sympathetic, critical and fair-minded, Skadden is probably the
most illuminating book ever written about a law firm."
—Robert W. Gordon, Stanford Law School
Co-sponsored by the Harvard Club of the Peninsula.
Refreshments will be served.
This event will be held at the Bookstore on campus.
