# Cal clobbers Cardinal 46-17, takes back Axe
## Bears decimate defense; 1st Big Game loss since '86 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
After six long years, the Cali
fornia football team finally got its
Axe together.
The Golden Bears scored the
second-highest number of points
in Big Game history, thoroughly
demolishing Stanford 46-17 on
Saturday at Stanford Stadium in
the 96th meeting between the two
schools.
And to complete the destruc
tion, Cal fans stormed the field
soon after the game's conclusion,
tearing down the south-end goal
post and ripping up huge chunks
of turf.
With the win, Cal improved its
record to 7-4 overall, 4-4 in the Pa
cific 10 Conference and took the
Axe trophy back across the Bay to
Berkeley for the first time since
1986. Stanford ended its season
with a 4-7 mark, 2-6 in the Pac-10,
for its worst finish since 1989.
"It was really a disastrous day
for Stanford," said Cardinal head
coach Bill Walsh. "We were just
out-hit, out-manned and out
matched."
Such was the case throughout
the season for the Stanford de
fense. But this time, the Cardinal
offense fell into the same category,
resulting in a Cal scoring on
slaught that was never answered.
The Cal defense stifled Stan
ford's Pac-10 leading passing of

fense with a stacked front line
that constantly pressured Cardi
nal quarterback Steve Stenstrom.
"They played a very risky de
fense and it paid off," said Sten
strom, who completed 27 of 51
passes for 346 yards and one
touchdown. "CaJ sold out on the
blitz, and we just did not re
spond."
"Cal did a great job of disguis
ing what they were doing on de
fense," said Stanford receiver
Justin Armour. "They were send
ing guys early on every play, so our
routes took a little bit too long to
develop in the amount of time
Steve had to throw it."
But that was exactly how Cal
defensive coordinator Artie Gi
gantino planned it. Gigantino was
not concerned with the less-than
potent Stanford running game,
knowing that the key to shutting
down the Cardinal was to shut
down Stenstrom.
"I'd like to call it more calculat
ing than risky," Gigantino said of
his defensive game plan. "You
have to take chances once in a
while. That kid (Stenstrom) is too
good — if you let him, he'll sit back
there and pick you apart."
Instead, it was the Bears who
did the picking, sacking Sten
strom three times and intercept
ing him twice. Cal held Stanford to
minus-five yards rushing on the

day, the second-worst total in Walsh's
four years as Stanford coach. Further,
the Cardinal offense did not set foot in
the Cal end zone until 4:37 was left in
the game, when Stenstrom connected
with freshman fullback Greg Cornelia on
a 23-yard swing pass.
"That's kind of like its been all year
long," Stenstrom said. "We won't be in a
rhythm and all of a sudden things click,
and we just start going. It didn't happen
today."
Cornerback Vaughn Bryant tried to
get the Cardinal in a rhythm at the out
set, giving Stanford an early 7-3 lead on
a 32-yard interception return for a
touchdown in the first quarter. But that
was the first and only time Stanford
would lead all day. Cal kicker Doug
Brien added three more field goals, while
running back Lindsey Chapman caught
one touchdown and ran for another to
give the Bears a 25-7 halftime advan
tage.
"When you run and see the end zone,
I saw money signs," Chapman said of his
17-yard touchdown reception from quar
terback Dave Barr. "I saw those red
Stanford letters and I just tried to get
there as fast as I could. I was oblivious to
anyone around me."
Especially the Stanford defense,
which again made an opposing running
back look like an All-American. Chap
man finished the afternoon with 149
yards on 28 carries, running for two
additional touchdowns in the second
half.
"They ran the flex draw to the weak
side and we couldn't stop it," said Stan

ford left end Tyrone Parker. "That
opened everything up."
Much like Stanford, Cal depended
heavily this season on the passing game,
but Chapman's big day made Barr's job
that much easier. Barr completed 17 of
25 attempts for 265 yards and two
touchdowns.
"The thing that makes a difference is
that we were running the ball so effec
tively, so we're not totally relying on the
passing game," said Cal head coach
Keith Gilbertson.
"It was a matter of being focused,"
added Cal receiver Iheanyi Uwaezuoke,
who caught the Bears' final touchdown.
"We knew that if we came out and made
the big plays, nothing was going to stop
us."
Nothing did. The Bears picked apart
the Pac-10's worst-rated defense, amass
ing 560 yards in total offense. Cal had 30
first downs to Stanford's 17, and con
trolled the ball for nearly 39 of the
game's 60 minutes.
Indeed, while safety Eliel Swinton,
safety Kevin Garnett and inside
linebacker Coy Gibbs each had 12 tack
les to lead the Cardinal, the best tackles
on the day were made by the Stanford
Band.
Last year, a Cal student tried to
attack the Stanford Tree during half
time without success. This year, at least
five members of a Cal fraternity hopped
the fence during the Band's halftime
show with hopes of dismantling the
Stanford mascot. Several Band mem
bers, though, paused in mid-tune, put
down their instruments to capture the
imposters and roughed them up until
the police arrived to handcuff them.

Perhaps the only other thing Cardi
nal rooters had to cheer about was that
Stenstrom's numbers allowed him to
break two more Pac-10 records, three
school records and tie another school
mark. Stenstrom set Pac-10 marks for
total offense (3,398 yards) and pass com
pletions (300) and established a Stanford
record for pass attempts (454), while
tying John Elway's school record of 27
touchdown passes in a season. He also
extended his Pac-10 and school record
for season passing yards (3,627).
Despite Stenstrom's records, things
got so desperate for Stanford that Walsh
had to resort to trick plays in an attempt
to breathe life into what was a Cal Bear
ial. One of those saw Stenstrom walk
toward the sidelines, apparently to call a
timeout, while cornerback Jami Webb,
an option quarterback in high school,
took the snap — and was stuffed by Cal
safety Ricky Spears for a 7-yard loss.
As for the entire squad, the game
served as a hammer that nailed down a
season of disappointment and unreal
ized goals, a sharp contrast to the team's
top-10 finish and Blockbuster Bowl vic
tory of a year ago.
"We just were not a good team this
year, period," Walsh said. "It's tough
sometimes to have to bite your lip and
take it. Obviously, we've fallen off pretty
badly. We're going to have to build
around this freshman group."
A group that gained valuable experi
ence against top-flight opponents.
"We're just going to have to look back
and see if we can find a bright spot from
this season to focus in on," Stenstrom
said. "We'll come back and make '94 a
big year."
