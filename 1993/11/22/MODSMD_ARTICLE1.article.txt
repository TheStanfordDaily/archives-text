# Cal clobbers Cardinal 46-17, takes back Axe
## Bears decimate defense; 1st Big Game loss since '86 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
After six long years, the Cali
fornia football team finally got its
Axe together.
The Golden Bears scored the
second-highest number of points
in Big Game history, thoroughly
demolishing Stanford 46-17 on
Saturday at Stanford Stadium in
the 96th meeting between the two
schools.
And to complete the destruc
tion, Cal fans stormed the field
soon after the game's conclusion,
tearing down the south-end goal
post and ripping up huge chunks
of turf.
With the win, Cal improved its
record to 7-4 overall, 4-4 in the Pa
cific 10 Conference and took the
Axe trophy back across the Bay to
Berkeley for the first time since
1986. Stanford ended its season
with a 4-7 mark, 2-6 in the Pac-10,
for its worst finish since 1989.
"It was really a disastrous day
for Stanford," said Cardinal head
coach Bill Walsh. "We were just
out-hit, out-manned and out
matched."
Such was the case throughout
the season for the Stanford de
fense. But this time, the Cardinal
offense fell into the same category,
resulting in a Cal scoring on
slaught that was never answered.
The Cal defense stifled Stan
ford's Pac-10 leading passing of

fense with a stacked front line
that constantly pressured Cardi
nal quarterback Steve Stenstrom.
"They played a very risky de
fense and it paid off," said Sten
strom, who completed 27 of 51
passes for 346 yards and one
touchdown. "CaJ sold out on the
blitz, and we just did not re
spond."
"Cal did a great job of disguis
ing what they were doing on de
fense," said Stanford receiver
Justin Armour. "They were send
ing guys early on every play, so our
routes took a little bit too long to
develop in the amount of time
Steve had to throw it."
But that was exactly how Cal
defensive coordinator Artie Gi
gantino planned it. Gigantino was
not concerned with the less-than
potent Stanford running game,
knowing that the key to shutting
down the Cardinal was to shut
down Stenstrom.
"I'd like to call it more calculat
ing than risky," Gigantino said of
his defensive game plan. "You
have to take chances once in a
while. That kid (Stenstrom) is too
good — if you let him, he'll sit back
there and pick you apart."
Instead, it was the Bears who
did the picking, sacking Sten
strom three times and intercept
ing him twice. Cal held Stanford to
minus-five yards rushing on the
