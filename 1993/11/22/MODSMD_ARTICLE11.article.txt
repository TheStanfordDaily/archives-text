# Packwood wavers on resignation

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen. Bob
Packwood had decided to resign, but
changed his mind after congressional
staffers leaked his intentions to the Jus
tice Department, prompting a subpoena
for his diaries, a leading Republican
lawmaker said yesterday.
"He was ready to resign, he wanted
out," Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming
said on CBS' "Face the Nation." Simp
son accused staffers of the Senate
Ethics Committee of thwarting the res
ignation by leaking word of it to Justice
Department lawyers.

When informed of Packwood's plans,
Justice Department lawyers scrambled
to issue a formal request for the Oregon
Republican's diaries, guarding against
their possible destruction once Pack
wood left the Senate.
Simpson, a friend of Packwood's,
said after Packwood was served with the
subpoena Friday, he "had no choice but
to stay in the Senate" where he could
better defend himself against possible
criminal charges.
After the subpoena was issued, any
attempt to destroy the diaries would

leave Packwood open to charges of
obstructing justice.
The diaries are central to a Senate
investigation into sexual harassment
allegations involving complaints from
more than two dozen women who said
that the Oregon Republican had made
unwelcome sexual advances to them
over the years.
Simpson said he would seek an
investigation into what role ethics
panel staffers might have played in the
timing of the Justice Department sub
poena.
