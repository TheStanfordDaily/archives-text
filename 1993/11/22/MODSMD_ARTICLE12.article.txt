# Clinton pursues trade victories
## Turns attention to Europe after success in the Pacific Rim 
### 
SEATTLE (AP) - The Clinton
administration is claiming a huge psy
chological boost as it turns its atten
tion from Asia-Pacific summitry to
winning completion in Geneva of a
long-stalled set of new global trading
rules.
Leaders who participated in the
three-day conference of Pacific Rim
nations said the meetings in Seattle
would help bring pressure to bear on
reluctant Europeans to complete a
round of trade liberalization moves by a
Dec. 15 deadline.
"The president has had a terrific
week," Secretary of State Warren
Christopher said yesterday."He has
completed two parts of this triple play"
with the successful Asian summit and
the passage last week of the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
"I don't think our partners in Gene
va have missed the significance of
what's happened here," U.S. Trade
Representative Mickey Kantor said in
Seattle.
Kantor is expected to press the point
today in talks in Washington with Leon
Brittain, trade commissioner for the 12-
nation European Community.
Participants in the 17-nation Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation confer
ence — ranging from close U.S. allies to
Chinese President and Communist
Party leader Jiang Zemin — were quick
to pronounce the summit a success.

"One must not exaggerate. There are
still great differences among the mem
bers. But a start has been made," said
Hamish Macleod, Hong Kong's finan
cial secretary.
And Jiang, while refusing to yield on
President Clinton's demands that
China do more on human rights and in
other trade areas, was upbeat about the
meeting itself — particularly the infor
mal heads-of-state session that Clinton
hosted Saturday at a lodge on Blake
Island in Puget Sound.
"APEC should be open, flexible and
loose," Jiang said. "The meeting was
successful and it will have a positive
impact."
Christopher said he was proud of the
way Clinton handled the human rights
issue with Jiang, and that while there
were no great accomplishments, "the
meeting was the message."
Administration officials were jubi
lant over what they saw as one of the
best few days of Clinton's presidency:
an enormous congressional victory in
passing NAFTA, followed by a warm
reception in Seattle — even from Asian
leaders who had eyed him suspiciously
at first.
"I think we will look back in 10 or 20
years and consider this leaders' confer
ence a turning point in the Asia-Pacific
history in terms of symbolism and in
terms of the beginning to move toward
a genuine community," said Winston

Lord, assistant secretary of state of
East Asian affairs.
The leaders liked the idea of the con
ference — the largest gathering of
Asian leaders ever — so much that they
even agreed to do it again next year in
Indonesia. Participants said annual
summit sessions — rivaling the annual
economic summits of the Group of
Seven Western industrialized democra
cies — was a distinct possibility.
The leaders promised at the confer
ence to work more closely in the future
to promote trade and economic growth
in the region. They also directed their
finance ministers to meet in March in
the United States to discuss economic
trends and flows of capital across bor
ders.
And leaders issued an appeal aimed
at Europe to help end a logjam that is
holding up a new set of liberalized trade
rules being negotiated by 108 nations
under the auspices of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Most participants in the conference
also agreed to cut tariffs on many goods
traded among themselves, adding up to
a lot of pressure on Europe.
U.S. officials said Clinton's next
major project in international eco
nomics is trying to wrap up the GATT
trade talks by the Dec. 15 deadline so
they can be submitted to Congress. The
talks have been going on in Geneva for
seven years.
