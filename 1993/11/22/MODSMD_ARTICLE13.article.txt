Airline strike continues
FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) - The
chairman of American Airlines dug his
heels in yesterday, turning down a call
from striking flight attendants for a pres
idential mediation board while announc
ing that up to two-thirds of this week's
flights would be canceled.
Speaking on the fourth day of the
planned 11-day strike by the Association
of Professional Flight Attendants, air
line Chairman Robert Crandall acknowl

edged that American fell short in notify
ing passengers about canceled flights,
but said it has been impossible to know
which flight attendants would report for
work and thus which flights would be
affected.
In hopes of placating thousands of
inconvenienced travelers, Crandall said
holders of unused, non-refundable tick
ets could get their money back. In addi
tion to a refund, displaced passengers
also will get a $100 voucher toward an
American ticket in the coming year.
