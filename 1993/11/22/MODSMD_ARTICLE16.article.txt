## Humanities Center fellow clarifies gay-marriage lecture 
### 
SINCE ARRIVING at Stanford in
September, I have been impressed
with the amount and quality of The
Daily's coverage of lesbian and gay issues.
I was especially pleased that The Daily
saw fit to report on the lecture, "Intimacy
and Equality: The Question of Lesbian
and Gay Marriage," which I presented at
the Law School on Tuesday night. Of
course, I referred to the first same-sex
commitment ceremony at Memorial
Church, which The Daily featured on the
front page earlier this fall. The Daily's
reporter did a fine job of summarizing
points from a complex argument that
took over an hour to present.
However, two errors require correc
tion. First, fortunately for supporters of
civil rights and liberties, Justice Harry
Blackmun has not yet retired from the
Supreme Court.

More substantively, the account
quotes me as contrasting "social accep
tance of the 'closet' and a pervasive legal
disability (for gays)." The contrast that I
highlighted was between social accep
tance and equality in the exercise of the
rights of citizenship. These matters are
now being publicly debated only because
lesbian and gay citizens in large num
bers have rejected the confines of the
'closet' and publicly organized to press
for equal citizenship. The wholesale dis
mantling of the closet has been the con
dition for the emergence of a movement
for lesbian and gay rights and liberation.
The fact that lesbians and gays are
accepted, tolerated really, in some
aspects of our society does not compen
sate for our legal subordination: in half
the states, same-sex activities, even
between adults in private, are crimes;

only eight states protect lesbian and gay
citizens against discrimination; efforts
are made, as in Oregon and Colorado, to
rescind what protections there are;
nowhere in the United States may les
bians and gays marry their partners;
and openly lesbian and gay citizens may
lose custody of their children and are
routinely denied the opportunity to
adopt. Because of the lack of civil rights
protections in most places, lesbians and
gays who become politically active risk
retaliation by employers, landlords and
others free to discriminate against them.
My focus was on the denial to lesbian
and gay citizens of the right to marry. I
stressed that this inequity was an aspect
of these "pervasive disabilities," amount
ing to a condition of second-class citizen
ship that is no longer tolerated for any
other minority in our complex democrat

ic society, at least in theory. Indeed, this
discrimination is defended on the
grounds of "traditional morality" and
"family values." Imagine the response if
such an argument were advanced today
to defend racial discrimination or exclu
sions of Jews, Muslims or Catholics.
The desire to establish long-lasting inti
mate relationships, to bear and raise chil
dren, to live lives uncontaminated by
secrecy or stigma, is shared by many citi
zens, gay or straight alike. Such aspira
tions require recognition by the state and
its agencies. The denial of this recognition
to lesbian and gay citizens is a violation of
democratic equality which the movement
for lesbian and gay rights seeks to remedy.
