# Otero AA defends funds for off-campus dinners
## 
### 
Before The Daily reveals the gospel
on where the budget-cutting axe should
fall, it should consider the effects on
students and not the "Daily" model of
a perfect Stanford. Revoking the much
appreciated privilege freshmen enjoy
by having dinner off-campus with their
advisers constitutes an irresponsible
and short-sighted position on the part
of the Daily's editorial staff. These off
campus dinners, far from a "free
lunch" away from Stern dining, give
freshmen an opportunity to get away
from their busy and often overwhelm
ing schedules during the first few
weeks of the year. They provide a
chance for new students to sit and
relax for a few hours and get to know
their advising group.
Hardly a bribe, these dinners, often

at the home of the adviser, help lay the
foundation for freshmen to feel comfort
able in their new environment. Every
one has a chance to talk to one another
undisturbed by the poor acoustics of
Stanford dining halls and beckoning
homework, athletics and meetings that
are ever the plague of later adviser din
ners in the residences. %
In fact, contrary to The Daily's bril
liant investigative findings, adviser din
ners in the residences are not a success.
Fewer people attend, and those who do
depart quickly after devouring the feast,
leaving those beautiful tablecloths bar
ren by 6 p.m.
Only the off-campus dinners can hold
the attention of freshmen for any mean
ingful amount of time, and this is not
because they are a payment for seeking
advice.
The rushed atmosphere Stanford
imposes on people's lives prevents this
from happening in the dining halls, so
these dinners set a tone for the rest of
the quarter more conducive to making

freshmen feel comfortable seeking
advice. Indeed, the adviser's worth must
be more important than the environ
ment, but dinner on campus holds many
impediments to creating an adviser
advisee relationship.
These special dinners are more than a
break from food service for freshmen,
who appreciate the time and effort the
adviser takes to get to know his advisees
and the opportunity to take a short rest
from the unrelenting changes arriving at
Stanford imposes on their lives.
