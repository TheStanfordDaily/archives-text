# Grad student criticizes fee-refund request bill
## 
### 
ASSU Senator Gabe Lucas' proposal
to make fee refunds more difficult to
obtain fails to consider several points.

Changing a refund request is exactly
as simple as obtaining a refund. The
same program is used.
This simple program can be run at
any time. Merely type "feerefund" on
any elaine.
All students who requested refunds
were told their request would stay in
effect all year.
To change the rules now is retroactive
and unfair.
Obviously SURE Escort is a group
that deserves funding, and it is used by
graduates and undergraduates alike. It
is, however, a conflict of interest for
the director of this special fee-funded
group, Gabe Lucas, to use his position
as ASSU senator to appropriate more
money.
Special fee groups need to convince
more students to support them. More
awareness will lead to lower refunds.
Changing the refund process is not the
answer.
