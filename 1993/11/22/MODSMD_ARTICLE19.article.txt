						mind meld with Freud

CAPTAIN'S LOG, Stardate:
49857.2. I had a dream like that
once. I was watching an episode of
"Star Trek" while standing on the
bridge. Captain Kirk had just saved a
newly discovered civilization from com
plete annihilation from delirium-induced
mass suicide by making them believe he
was God. Now, he was caught in a moral
dilemma between saving the universe
and spending a night with a beautiful,
four-armed alien who fell in love with
him because of his charming wit, his
dashing good looks and his slightly dis
tended belly. And of course, I woke up
thinking, "Hey! I have a slightly distend
ed belly." Then, I wished I could fall back
asleep so I could take advantage of my
newly discovered asset.
What does all this mean? Am I uncon
sciously in love with Captain Kirk? With
four-armed aliens? Can we read into our
dreams and find out about ourselves?
These questions may never be answered
absolutely but the theories abound.
I've heard a lot of different ideas:
Dreams are your way of subcon
sciously trying to solve questions or con
cerns you had during the day. Dreams
are the dumping ground for thoughts
that you thought you thought, but theo
retically, they were never thought
because your subconscious thinking
didn't think they were thoughtful

enough to be thought.
And then there's Freud: dreams are
sex. Then again, with Freud, food is sex.
Work is sex. Life is sex. Death is sex.
Lampshades, blowfish, exploding cows,
Franz Kafka and Big Game are sex
(except Big Game wasn't as fun).
(I never thought I could use "sex" so
many times in one paragraph and get
away with it. I bet you never thought you
would see "exploding cows" and "sex" in
the same sentence and not be surprised
in the least.)
As probable as that may sound, there
is no reason to believe that everything we
dream about involves hidden sexual
desires. But Freud claims that these
dreams tap into our id, the unconscious
mind that harbors our most basic needs.
Even if we ignore the intellectual urges
we've acquired from society and civiliza
tion and only consider our true primal
instincts, dreams are still not necessarily
the language of the libido.
We have only two truly basic primal
instincts: to survive and to reproduce.
And, arguably, the survival instinct is
stronger. So where is the psychologist
claiming that all dreams are really hidden
desires of food and shelter? Why are
these images seen as sexual frustrations?
I know. Freud was a pervert.
Freud may be right, but people lis
tened to him and considered it because it

was so shocking and sensationalist.
There might have been a theory that
everything was a symbol of hunger, but it
was completely ignored and dismissed
because, well, it was as boring. At least
people laughed at Freud.
Imagine what psychoanalysis would
be like if Freud were raised in a kitchen.
Just think: dreaming about going
through a tunnel would be a desire to eat
a Twinkie, smoking a cigar would be
smelling a chocolate eclair, watching the
performance of an opera would be watch
ing two people intimately, sensually sea
soning a stew.
Wow. Is it hot in here?
And with this new theory, I can finally
analyze my "Star Trek" dream and make
some sense of it. Images of saving the
universe and authority figures are my
desire to be in control of and overpower
food, i.e. eat it. All multi-limbed creatures
are symbols of gluttony. And dreaming of
"Star Trek" is an insatiable desire to eat
a bowl of "Star Trek" cereal as part of
this complete breakfast. Hey, this may
just work.

Thai still finds it hard to see how "Star
Trek" can relate to any basic desires he
has. Maybe it's his primal instinct to try
actinometry.
