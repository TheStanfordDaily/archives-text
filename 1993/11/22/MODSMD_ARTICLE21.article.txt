Before a near-sellout crowd at Stanford
Stadium on Saturday, 15 seniors played their
final games in a Cardinal uniform.
But after the 96th Big Game ended, those
seniors were left with a feeling they had not
experienced in their entire Stanford careers
— contemplating a loss to archrival Califor
nia and bidding farewell to the Axe trophy for
the first time.
"It leaves a bad taste," said senior co-cap
tain Scott Lange. "It was a rough day for us."
After being part of a Pacific 10 Conference
co-championship last season and playing in
bowl games in each of the past two seasons,
the Cardinal's 4-7 finish did not sit well with
the Class of' 94, who could not contain their
disappointment.
"I'm a little hurt right now," said corner
back Vaughn Bryant, who had two intercep
tions. "Sometimes the defense has to carry
the team, and we weren't able to do that

today or this season."
Others tried to block out Stanford's 46-17
loss and reminisce about their time on the
Farm.
"The past five years are going through my
mind," said teary-eyed left end Ty rone Park
er. "This game means nothing to me right
now. It's going to be the last game, but I'm
just going to think about the good times."
Which is exactly what head coach Bill
Walsh stressed when asked about this year's
senior class.
"This game was a tough one, but they
were on a co-championship team last year
and won a bowl game against Penn State,
and the year before that they had some big
wins over USC, UCLA and Cal," Walsh said.
"They've had their great days, so I don't
think there's anything for our seniors to feel
regrettable about."
Meanwhile, underclassmen, who, like the
seniors, had never suffered defeat at the
hands of the Golden Bears, tried to
empathize.

"I have a frustrating feeling inside right
now," said quarterback Steve Stenstrom, an
academic senior who has one year of eligibili
ty remaining. "It's tough to end the season
on a note like this."
"That was probably the hardest part — to
come in here (the lockerroom), look those
guys in the eyes, and tell them they're leav
ing here with a loss," added receiver Justin
Armour.
"It's tough. We're going to miss those
guys. They're kind of members of the old
school — they're just hard-nosed tough guys.
I hope we don't lose touch with that,"
Armour said.
Stanford's football class of '94 includes:
offensive linemen Jeff Bailey, Parker Bailey,
Glen Cavanaugh, Brian Cassidy and Steve
Hoyem; running backs Lange and co-captain
Ellery Roberts; tight end Paul Nickel; defen
sive linemen Mark Hatzenbuhler, co-captain
Toby Norwood and Parker; cornerbacks
Roger Boden, Bryant and Josh Wright; and
punter Matt Vaughn.
