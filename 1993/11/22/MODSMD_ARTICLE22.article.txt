# By definition, truly a Big Game
## The
						sights and sounds of the Stanford-California clash 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Football, flaring tempers, screaming
fans wearing blue and some Hying fruit —
all the makings of a Big Game. The outra
geous sights, sounds and stats of Satur
day's Stanford-California matchup have
come to be expected of the November clas
sic.
Trick plays. On fourth-and-one in the
third quarter, Stenstrom lined up behind
center, but then ran toward the sideline as
if responding to a command from coach
Bill Walsh. Tailback Jami Webb jumped
behind center and tried to run the option
on an unsuspecting Cal. The play went for
minus-seven yards.
Cal fans. A small bevy of Cal fans amaz
ingly eluded the game's airtight security
to take the field during the halftime show.
The fans were typically stomped by the
Stanford Band, who made some tackles
that probably made the Cardinal defense
jealous.
Seniors' "last walk." Stanford captains
Toby Norwood, Ellery Roberts and Scott
Lange and the rest of the senior class
going out with a loss. An even greater
number of Cal seniors rejoiced over the
long-awaited last-chance possession of the
Axe.
Stanford's play was so normal that it
became a caricature of itself Quarterback
Steve Stenstrom again had a big day with
346 passing yards, setting new Pacific 10
Conference records for single-season pass
ing yards, total yards and completions.
The running game was again nonexistent
— this time literally — netting minus-five
yards on the day against Cal's defense,
rated second-lowest in the conference
Again, the Stanford defense made an

opposing running back look like the
league's best. Cal's Lindsey Chapman ran
for 141 yards on 28 carries. In all, the
Bears rushed for 295 yards. The pass
defense was slightly less normal, allowing
only 265 yards through the air.
But the sights continued after the
game. The promised security turned out to
be lax, sparse and ineffective, allowing the
Cal students to gain the field.
Immediately, a large group of Cal fans
ran over to the Stanford student section,
taunting the Cardinal fans and throwing
things at the Band. Stanford fans were
ordered to leave the stadium. The Cal fans
continued with their "Bear territory"
cheer.
And then, suddenly, everything around
happening all at once seemed to be defined
only by remembering that it was Big
Game.
For the first time in recent memory,
one of the goal posts was being torn down.
Numerous people clad in blue and gold
were tearing up pieces of the Stanford sod
in commemoration of the win.
Media members were surrounding
Walsh, asking questions and trying,
unsuccessfully, to illicit a "we'll improve
and be ready next year" response.
"It was really a disastrous day for Stan
ford," Widish said. "We can't do much for a
while We're disappointed in some of our
guys, and I'm hopeful that they'll
improve, I really am, for them and for
Stanford."
"We finally won!" yelled one Cal stu
dent, joyfully hugging a friend. "It's been
so long!"
"It's like getting a monkey off my
back," said Cal senior wide receiver
Damien Semien, who then added, "I don't
think thev really took us seriously, and it

showed in their play. They came out flat
and we came out with a workman-like atti
tude."
A Cal fan was unzipping his pants,
withdrawing his, uh, Calness and relieving
himself in the center of the field.
Police were chasing down certain select
ed Cal fans and carting them off while the
rest of the fans threw fruit at the officers.
A mob of too-happy fans descended
upon quarterback Dave Barr, knocking
down the victorious quarterback and the
members of the media surrounding him.
A Stanford fan was sitting in the stands
for more than an hour after the game,
watching the celebration below.
Cal fans were jumping and dancing on
top of a portable outhouse. A group of
refugees-from-the-1960s Cal fans simply
sat quietly, unshoed, at the 15-yard line.
A group of Bear fans passing by the
point-belching cannon suggested they try
to steal it, too. Another few fans laughed
that the Alamo Bowl won't want Cal
because their fans are so destructive.
An inebriated Stanford alum was rush
ing to the Cal busses so that he could offer
an obscene gesture.
A Cal student being golf-carted off the
field in handcuffs, yelling "Go Bears!" A
14-year-old Stanford fan in the stands
yelling "Go Stanford" before scampering
to the security of his friends.
"This is the biggest game I've ever
won," said defensive tackle Stafford
Evans. "Ain't no other feeling in the world
like this."
"We've been living high at Stanford
against Cal in recent years," Walsh said.
"This was bound to happen sooner or
later."
Players cheered. Players cried. Records
fell. Fans taunted. The Axe left.
