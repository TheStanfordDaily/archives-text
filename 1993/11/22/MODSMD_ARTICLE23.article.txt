## Patriots rocket by Stanford Cardinal soccer's NCAA hopes dashed by penalty kicks 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. - Shocked.
Afler two 45-minute halves, four 15-
minute overtimes and four penalty
kicks, that is the only word to describe
the Stanford women's soccer team.
Stanford's Final Four dream of
unseating No. 1 North Carolina came to
a crashing halt as No. 10 George Mason
upset the second-ranked Cardinal Fri
day in a game decided by penalty kicks
on the dark, rain-soaked pitch of North
Carolina's Fetzer Field.
After playing to a 1-1 tie through reg
ulation, the Stanford-George Mason
semifinal was extended by the four over
time periods, the last two being sudden
death sessions. However, the score was
still knotted after the extra hour of play.
The Patriots then topped the Cardinal 3-
1 on penalty kicks, and thereby ad
vanced to the championship game
against North Carolina. In the final, the
Tar Heels' blistering attack over
whelmed George Mason, 6-0, giving Car
olina their eighth consecutive NCAA
title.
But the Patriots' loss gave the Cardi
nal little solace. "I'm devastated," said
head coach lan Sawyers. "It's a weird
feeling. It's more of a feeling of the play
ers having worked so hard all season to
get in this position, and right when it's
in their grasp, it's stolen away. There's a
sense of being burgled."
After a first half in which the Cardi
nal controlled the ball but couldn't find
the net, Stanford took a 1-0 lead in the
64th minute when sophomore midfield
er Carmel Murphy put in an errant
rebound off freshman Erin Martin's
shot. It was Murphy's ninth goal of the
year and her second in the last two
games.
Stanford remained in control
throughout the second half, and almost
extended its lead to 2-0 with less than 20
minutes left in the game when Martin
raced ahead of two defenders, setting up
a one-on-one play against Mason's goal
keeper. However, Martin was whistled
for being offsides and play was halted
before she could get off a shot.
Then, with 9:11 left in the game,

Patriot forward Jenn Gross slipped
behind the Stanford defense and put a
shot past a diving Leslie Garrard, knot
ting the score at 1-1. During regulation
play, the Cardinal defense limited
Mason to seven shots on goal, compared
to the 11 shots Stanford took.
"I was just in the right place at the
right time," said Gross.
After four scoreless overtime periods,
penalty kicks made the decision of who
was to advance to the championship
game. Normally, a tie game is decided on
penalty kicks afler two overtime periods.
For the Final Four, however, officials
added the two sudden-death overtimes
in hopes of avoiding the awkward proce
dure of reducing the game to five one-on
one matchups.
"It's such a crapshoot," Sawyers said
of the kicks. "You just have to tell your
kids 'whatever happens, happens. I
believe in you — just do what you can.'
When it gets to that stage, we've done all
we can, basically, and we just have to
take our chances."
Stanford won the coin toss and elect
ed to kick first, with each team alternat
ing shots. Sarah Rafanelli's shot was
stopped by Patriot keeper Skye Eddy,
and Gross's shot sailed over Garrard's
diving body. Jessica Fischer's blast rico
chetted off the right post, and George
Mason midfielder Amanda Mitchell
pushed the Patriot lead to 2-0 with her
goal.
Next up for the Cardinal was Martin,
who faked right and put the shot in the
left corner for the goal. However, George
Mason also found the back of the net as
Sherry Worsham fired another shot into
the Stanford goal. Needing to make the
next shot for the Cardinal to stay alive,
Murphy's shot was turned away by
Eddy, ending the game three hours and
15 minutes afler it started.
"You create your own luck, and
maybe today wasn't our day," Sawyers
said. "I just feel a lot of pain for our play
ers, because they are tremendous people
to work with, and I want them to feel
elation instead of how they feel now."
Stanford ends the season with an 18-
2-2 record, with the Final Four semifinal
not considered a loss. Officially, the
game is recorded as a 1-1 tie, with

George Mason advancing on penalty
shots.
The Cardinal dominated play for
nearly every minute of the two-and-a
half hour marathon. Although the first
half was mostly an adjustment period
for both teams, Stanford began to assert
its power in the second half. Rafanelli
regularly took on and beat two players
on her way to the goal, but the Cardinal
couldn't finish its scoring chances.
"In the attacking third of the field, we
just couldn't seem to convert our great
chances," Sawyers said. "She IRafanellil
was getting the crosses in, but unfortu
nately we didn't get into scoring posi
tion. We just didn't put away our
chances, and at this level, if you don't
put away your chances, it's hard to win."
In the first two overtimes, despite the
loss of Rafanelli for several minutes to a
rib injury, Stanford had several chances
which they couldn't convert. Two min
utes into the first extra period, Murphy
sent a shot off the crossbar. In the sec
ond overtime, a crossing pass from Dena
Dey, who replaced Rafanelli, scooted
past both Martin and Murphy in front of
the Patriot goal. After 30 minutes of
overtime, Stanford outshot George
Mason 15-8, but still couldn't get the
ball past Eddy, who made 10 saves in the
game.
The skies opened up just as the first
sudden-death overtime began. However,
the rains did not slow the Cardinal down
as it sent several more excellent serves
into the box. Freshman Wendy Latimer
had a free kick and a corner kick, which
were both turned away by opportunistic
Patriot defense.
During the second sudden-death
overtime, the adrenaline and excitement
of the game began to wear down, as both
teams seemed a step slower. Stanford
had one final chance to pull out a dra
matic victory with 30 seconds left in the
period, as a pass from Latimer to Dey
skipped over the cross bar. The game
then ended in a tie, with the decision left
to the penalty kicks. For the game, Stan
ford outshot George Mason 19-9, limit
ing the Patriots to just two shots in the
entire hour of overtime action.
