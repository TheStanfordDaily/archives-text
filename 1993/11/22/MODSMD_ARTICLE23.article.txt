## Patriots rocket by Stanford Cardinal soccer's NCAA hopes dashed by penalty kicks 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. - Shocked.
Afler two 45-minute halves, four 15-
minute overtimes and four penalty
kicks, that is the only word to describe
the Stanford women's soccer team.
Stanford's Final Four dream of
unseating No. 1 North Carolina came to
a crashing halt as No. 10 George Mason
upset the second-ranked Cardinal Fri
day in a game decided by penalty kicks
on the dark, rain-soaked pitch of North
Carolina's Fetzer Field.
After playing to a 1-1 tie through reg
ulation, the Stanford-George Mason
semifinal was extended by the four over
time periods, the last two being sudden
death sessions. However, the score was
still knotted after the extra hour of play.
The Patriots then topped the Cardinal 3-
1 on penalty kicks, and thereby ad
vanced to the championship game
against North Carolina. In the final, the
Tar Heels' blistering attack over
whelmed George Mason, 6-0, giving Car
olina their eighth consecutive NCAA
title.
But the Patriots' loss gave the Cardi
nal little solace. "I'm devastated," said
head coach lan Sawyers. "It's a weird
feeling. It's more of a feeling of the play
ers having worked so hard all season to
get in this position, and right when it's
in their grasp, it's stolen away. There's a
sense of being burgled."
After a first half in which the Cardi
nal controlled the ball but couldn't find
the net, Stanford took a 1-0 lead in the
64th minute when sophomore midfield
er Carmel Murphy put in an errant
rebound off freshman Erin Martin's
shot. It was Murphy's ninth goal of the
year and her second in the last two
games.
Stanford remained in control
throughout the second half, and almost
extended its lead to 2-0 with less than 20
minutes left in the game when Martin
raced ahead of two defenders, setting up
a one-on-one play against Mason's goal
keeper. However, Martin was whistled
for being offsides and play was halted
before she could get off a shot.
Then, with 9:11 left in the game,

Patriot forward Jenn Gross slipped
behind the Stanford defense and put a
shot past a diving Leslie Garrard, knot
ting the score at 1-1. During regulation
play, the Cardinal defense limited
Mason to seven shots on goal, compared
to the 11 shots Stanford took.
"I was just in the right place at the
right time," said Gross.
After four scoreless overtime periods,
penalty kicks made the decision of who
was to advance to the championship
game. Normally, a tie game is decided on
penalty kicks afler two overtime periods.
For the Final Four, however, officials
added the two sudden-death overtimes
in hopes of avoiding the awkward proce
dure of reducing the game to five one-on
one matchups.
"It's such a crapshoot," Sawyers said
of the kicks. "You just have to tell your
kids 'whatever happens, happens. I
believe in you — just do what you can.'
When it gets to that stage, we've done all
we can, basically, and we just have to
take our chances."
Stanford won the coin toss and elect
ed to kick first, with each team alternat
ing shots. Sarah Rafanelli's shot was
stopped by Patriot keeper Skye Eddy,
and Gross's shot sailed over Garrard's
diving body. Jessica Fischer's blast rico
chetted off the right post, and George
Mason midfielder Amanda Mitchell
pushed the Patriot lead to 2-0 with her
goal.
Next up for the Cardinal was Martin,
who faked right and put the shot in the
left corner for the goal. However, George
Mason also found the back of the net as
Sherry Worsham fired another shot into
the Stanford goal. Needing to make the
next shot for the Cardinal to stay alive,
Murphy's shot was turned away by
Eddy, ending the game three hours and
15 minutes afler it started.
"You create your own luck, and
maybe today wasn't our day," Sawyers
said. "I just feel a lot of pain for our play
ers, because they are tremendous people
to work with, and I want them to feel
elation instead of how they feel now."
Stanford ends the season with an 18-
2-2 record, with the Final Four semifinal
not considered a loss. Officially, the
game is recorded as a 1-1 tie, with

George Mason advancing on penalty
shots.
The Cardinal dominated play for
nearly every minute of the two-and-a
half hour marathon. Although the first
half was mostly an adjustment period
for both teams, Stanford began to assert
its power in the second half. Rafanelli
regularly took on and beat two players
on her way to the goal, but the Cardinal
couldn't finish its scoring chances.
"In the attacking third of the field, we
just couldn't seem to convert our great
chances," Sawyers said. "She IRafanellil
was getting the crosses in, but unfortu
nately we didn't get into scoring posi
tion. We just didn't put away our
chances, and at this level, if you don't
put away your chances, it's hard to win."
In the first two overtimes, despite the
loss of Rafanelli for several minutes to a
rib injury, Stanford had several chances
which they couldn't convert. Two min
utes into the first extra period, Murphy
sent a shot off the crossbar. In the sec
ond overtime, a crossing pass from Dena
Dey, who replaced Rafanelli, scooted
past both Martin and Murphy in front of
the Patriot goal. After 30 minutes of
overtime, Stanford outshot George
Mason 15-8, but still couldn't get the
ball past Eddy, who made 10 saves in the
game.
The skies opened up just as the first
sudden-death overtime began. However,
the rains did not slow the Cardinal down
as it sent several more excellent serves
into the box. Freshman Wendy Latimer
had a free kick and a corner kick, which
were both turned away by opportunistic
Patriot defense.
During the second sudden-death
overtime, the adrenaline and excitement
of the game began to wear down, as both
teams seemed a step slower. Stanford
had one final chance to pull out a dra
matic victory with 30 seconds left in the
period, as a pass from Latimer to Dey
skipped over the cross bar. The game
then ended in a tie, with the decision left
to the penalty kicks. For the game, Stan
ford outshot George Mason 19-9, limit
ing the Patriots to just two shots in the
entire hour of overtime action.

Senior Sarah Rafanelli makes a run for NCAA glory. However, the Cardinal fell a little
short over the weekend in a 3-1 upset at the hands of George Mason.
"We've been working on penal
ty kicks for the last two weeks,
getting ready for the tourna
ment," said George Mason coach
Jac Cicala. "We've been working
not only on the execution but the
psychological attitude of taking a
PK."
In all, George Mason defeated
three higher-ranked teams to get
to the championship game. Top
ping No. 3 Notre Dame and No. 9
Wisconsin in the Central Regional
Tournament, the Patriots added
No. 2 Stanford to their list of
upsets.
Eddy turned the momentum of
the game around several times
with acrobatic saves. The Patriot
defense was giving up the side
lines, but whenever a ball was
served into the box, Eddy or
sweeper Christine Ho fired the
ball out of danger.
"Our defense today just played
great," said Eddy. "Christine Ho
just came up with some amazing
saves. That's what it's all about."
Part of the difficulty Stanford
had in the game revolved around
George Mason's style of play.
Rather than have a game-plan
involving complex schemes and
passes, the Patriots attempt to
disrupt the other team's rhythm,
kicking balls out of the opponent's
attacking zone instead of trying to
take possession and work the ball
through the midfield.
Described as a very direct style,
George Mason works almost
entirely from fullback straight to
forward, bypassing the midfield
altogether.
That specific style countered
Stanford's ball-possession style
nearly perfectly. Although Mur
phy played an excellent game,
much of the Cardinal's offense
couldn't be started because the
ball was going all over the field.
"I thought Carmel was out
standing, unbelievable," Sawyers
said. "She was up and down that
field, she never stopped. She was
like our engine room, when people
were dying, she was there. She
was such a force out there."
However, playing the extra
hour did not take its toll as much
as expected. Having stressed a
strong fitness base for the entire

season, Sawyers felt his players
were in top shape to withstand a
150-minute onslaught.
"I think everyone had a lot of
adrenaline going," Rafanelli said.
"It was a very exciting game. Each
successive overtime we realized
we had to kick it up that much
more. Fatigue in our minds
wasn't a factor."
In Sunday's matchup, North
Carolina throttled George Mason
6-0. The Tar Heels scored three
goals in each half and outshot the
Patriots 38-2. Carolina defeated
Massachusetts 4-1 in their semifi
nal game to earn the champi
onship bid.
Although Sawyers would have
enjoyed a rematch with the Tar
Heels in the finals, just the chance
to play in the Final Four was a
great accomplishment for this
team.
"Early on in the season we
were struggling to find a system
and a rhythm that would fit our
players," Sawyers said. "We were
living off individual brilliance and
team chemistry was helping a lot
during those times. In the second
half of the season we really found
a system which worked for us and
did a great job executing game
plans. We had everybody totally
fit and then came into the Final
Four, where you roll the dice.
"We're a young team — we
only lose one playing senior, we'll
bounce back. The first thing I've
got to tell them is how proud I am
of them."
One of the most important
parts to come out of Stanford's
Final Four experience was the
chance for Rafanelli to play in the
collegiate spotlight for once in her
career.
"I'm so glad that she got to
appear in a Final Four before she
graduated," Sawyers said. "She's
been a huge factor this year for
us."
Although Rafanelli saw her col
lege career come to an end on Fri
day, she will look back on this year
with fond memories.
"I'm very proud of the team,
and very happy with the year,"
she said. "This is definitely the
best year I've had personally, in
terms of team chemistry and
coaching. I couldn't have asked
for a better year. I would love to
congratulate each of my team
mates — they played awesomely
this year."

Carolina throttled George Mason
6-0. The Tar Heels scored three
goals in each half and outshot the
Patriots 38-2. Carolina defeated
Massachusetts 4-1 in their semifi

Although Sawyers would have
enjoyed a rematch with the Tar

to play in the Final Four was a
great accomplishment for this
team.
"Early on in the season we
were struggling to find a system
and a rhythm that would fit our
players," Sawyers said. "We were
living off individual brilliance and
team chemistry was helping a lot
during those times. In the second
half of the season we really found
a system which worked for us and
did a great job executing game
plans. We had everybody totally
fit and then came into the Final

Final Four experience was the
chance for Rafanelli to play in the

"I'm so glad that she got to

graduated," Sawyers said. "She's
been a huge factor this year for
us."
Although Rafanelli saw her col

day, she will look back on this year
with fond memories.
"I'm very proud of the team,
and very happy with the year,"
she said. "This is definitely the

for a better year. I would love to

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. - Shocked.
Afler two 45-minute halves, four 15-
minute overtimes and four penalty
kicks, that is the only word to describe
the Stanford women's soccer team.
Stanford's Final Four dream of
unseating No. 1 North Carolina came to
a crashing halt as No. 10 George Mason
upset the second-ranked Cardinal Fri
day in a game decided by penalty kicks
on the dark, rain-soaked pitch of North
Carolina's Fetzer Field.
After playing to a 1-1 tie through reg
ulation, the Stanford-George Mason
semifinal was extended by the four over
time periods, the last two being sudden
death sessions. However, the score was
still knotted after the extra hour of play.
The Patriots then topped the Cardinal 3-
1 on penalty kicks, and thereby ad
vanced to the championship game
against North Carolina. In the final, the
Tar Heels' blistering attack over
whelmed George Mason, 6-0, giving Car
olina their eighth consecutive NCAA
title.
But the Patriots' loss gave the Cardi
nal little solace. "I'm devastated," said
head coach lan Sawyers. "It's a weird
feeling. It's more of a feeling of the play
ers having worked so hard all season to
get in this position, and right when it's
in their grasp, it's stolen away. There's a
sense of being burgled."
After a first half in which the Cardi
nal controlled the ball but couldn't find
the net, Stanford took a 1-0 lead in the
64th minute when sophomore midfield
er Carmel Murphy put in an errant
rebound off freshman Erin Martin's
shot. It was Murphy's ninth goal of the
year and her second in the last two
games.
Stanford remained in control
throughout the second half, and almost
extended its lead to 2-0 with less than 20
minutes left in the game when Martin
raced ahead of two defenders, setting up
a one-on-one play against Mason's goal
keeper. However, Martin was whistled
for being offsides and play was halted
before she could get off a shot.
Then, with 9:11 left in the game,

Patriot forward Jenn Gross slipped
behind the Stanford defense and put a
shot past a diving Leslie Garrard, knot
ting the score at 1-1. During regulation
play, the Cardinal defense limited
Mason to seven shots on goal, compared
to the 11 shots Stanford took.
"I was just in the right place at the
right time," said Gross.
After four scoreless overtime periods,
penalty kicks made the decision of who
was to advance to the championship
game. Normally, a tie game is decided on
penalty kicks afler two overtime periods.
For the Final Four, however, officials
added the two sudden-death overtimes
in hopes of avoiding the awkward proce
dure of reducing the game to five one-on
one matchups.
"It's such a crapshoot," Sawyers said
of the kicks. "You just have to tell your
kids 'whatever happens, happens. I
believe in you — just do what you can.'
When it gets to that stage, we've done all
we can, basically, and we just have to
take our chances."
Stanford won the coin toss and elect
ed to kick first, with each team alternat
ing shots. Sarah Rafanelli's shot was
stopped by Patriot keeper Skye Eddy,
and Gross's shot sailed over Garrard's
diving body. Jessica Fischer's blast rico
chetted off the right post, and George
Mason midfielder Amanda Mitchell
pushed the Patriot lead to 2-0 with her
goal.
Next up for the Cardinal was Martin,
who faked right and put the shot in the
left corner for the goal. However, George
Mason also found the back of the net as
Sherry Worsham fired another shot into
the Stanford goal. Needing to make the
next shot for the Cardinal to stay alive,
Murphy's shot was turned away by
Eddy, ending the game three hours and
15 minutes afler it started.
"You create your own luck, and
maybe today wasn't our day," Sawyers
said. "I just feel a lot of pain for our play
ers, because they are tremendous people
to work with, and I want them to feel
elation instead of how they feel now."
Stanford ends the season with an 18-
2-2 record, with the Final Four semifinal
not considered a loss. Officially, the
game is recorded as a 1-1 tie, with

George Mason advancing on penalty
shots.
The Cardinal dominated play for
nearly every minute of the two-and-a
half hour marathon. Although the first
half was mostly an adjustment period
for both teams, Stanford began to assert
its power in the second half. Rafanelli
regularly took on and beat two players
on her way to the goal, but the Cardinal
couldn't finish its scoring chances.
"In the attacking third of the field, we
just couldn't seem to convert our great
chances," Sawyers said. "She IRafanellil
was getting the crosses in, but unfortu
nately we didn't get into scoring posi
tion. We just didn't put away our
chances, and at this level, if you don't
put away your chances, it's hard to win."
In the first two overtimes, despite the
loss of Rafanelli for several minutes to a
rib injury, Stanford had several chances
which they couldn't convert. Two min
utes into the first extra period, Murphy
sent a shot off the crossbar. In the sec
ond overtime, a crossing pass from Dena
Dey, who replaced Rafanelli, scooted
past both Martin and Murphy in front of
the Patriot goal. After 30 minutes of
overtime, Stanford outshot George
Mason 15-8, but still couldn't get the
ball past Eddy, who made 10 saves in the
game.
The skies opened up just as the first
sudden-death overtime began. However,
the rains did not slow the Cardinal down
as it sent several more excellent serves
into the box. Freshman Wendy Latimer
had a free kick and a corner kick, which
were both turned away by opportunistic
Patriot defense.
During the second sudden-death
overtime, the adrenaline and excitement
of the game began to wear down, as both
teams seemed a step slower. Stanford
had one final chance to pull out a dra
matic victory with 30 seconds left in the
period, as a pass from Latimer to Dey
skipped over the cross bar. The game
then ended in a tie, with the decision left
to the penalty kicks. For the game, Stan
ford outshot George Mason 19-9, limit
ing the Patriots to just two shots in the
entire hour of overtime action.


Sasha Mitelman — Daily file
Senior Sarah Rafanelli makes a run for NCAA glory. However, the Cardinal fell a little
short over the weekend in a 3-1 upset at the hands of George Mason.
"We've been working on penal
ty kicks for the last two weeks,
getting ready for the tourna
ment," said George Mason coach
Jac Cicala. "We've been working
not only on the execution but the
psychological attitude of taking a
PK."
In all, George Mason defeated
three higher-ranked teams to get
to the championship game. Top
ping No. 3 Notre Dame and No. 9
Wisconsin in the Central Regional
Tournament, the Patriots added
No. 2 Stanford to their list of
upsets.
Eddy turned the momentum of
the game around several times
with acrobatic saves. The Patriot
defense was giving up the side
lines, but whenever a ball was
served into the box, Eddy or
sweeper Christine Ho fired the
ball out of danger.
"Our defense today just played
great," said Eddy. "Christine Ho
just came up with some amazing
saves. That's what it's all about."
Part of the difficulty Stanford
had in the game revolved around
George Mason's style of play.
Rather than have a game-plan
involving complex schemes and
passes, the Patriots attempt to
disrupt the other team's rhythm,
kicking balls out of the opponent's
attacking zone instead of trying to
take possession and work the ball
through the midfield.
Described as a very direct style,
George Mason works almost
entirely from fullback straight to
forward, bypassing the midfield
altogether.
That specific style countered
Stanford's ball-possession style
nearly perfectly. Although Mur
phy played an excellent game,
much of the Cardinal's offense
couldn't be started because the
ball was going all over the field.
"I thought Carmel was out
standing, unbelievable," Sawyers
said. "She was up and down that
field, she never stopped. She was
like our engine room, when people
were dying, she was there. She
was such a force out there."
However, playing the extra
hour did not take its toll as much
as expected. Having stressed a
strong fitness base for the entire

season, Sawyers felt his players
were in top shape to withstand a
150-minute onslaught.
"I think everyone had a lot of
adrenaline going," Rafanelli said.
"It was a very exciting game. Each
successive overtime we realized
we had to kick it up that much
more. Fatigue in our minds
wasn't a factor."

the game around several times
with acrobatic saves. The Patriot
defense was giving up the side
lines, but whenever a ball was
served into the box, Eddy or
sweeper Christine Ho fired the
ball out of danger.
"Our defense today just played
great," said Eddy. "Christine Ho
just came up with some amazing
saves. That's what it's all about."
Part of the difficulty Stanford
had in the game revolved around
George Mason's style of play.
Rather than have a game-plan
involving complex schemes and
passes, the Patriots attempt to
disrupt the other team's rhythm,
kicking balls out of the opponent's
attacking zone instead of trying to
take possession and work the ball
through the midfield.
Described as a very direct style,
George Mason works almost
entirely from fullback straight to
forward, bypassing the midfield
altogether.
That specific style countered
Stanford's ball-possession style
nearly perfectly. Although Mur
phy played an excellent game,
much of the Cardinal's offense
couldn't be started because the
ball was going all over the field.
"I thought Carmel was out
standing, unbelievable," Sawyers
said. "She was up and down that
field, she never stopped. She was
like our engine room, when people
were dying, she was there. She
was such a force out there."
However, playing the extra
hour did not take its toll as much
as expected. Having stressed a
strong fitness base for the entire

season, Sawyers felt his players
were in top shape to withstand a
150-minute onslaught.
"I think everyone had a lot of
adrenaline going," Rafanelli said.
"It was a very exciting game. Each
successive overtime we realized
we had to kick it up that much
more. Fatigue in our minds
wasn't a factor."
In Sunday's matchup, North
Carolina throttled George Mason
6-0. The Tar Heels scored three
goals in each half and outshot the
Patriots 38-2. Carolina defeated
Massachusetts 4-1 in their semifi
nal game to earn the champi
onship bid.
Although Sawyers would have
enjoyed a rematch with the Tar
Heels in the finals, just the chance
to play in the Final Four was a
great accomplishment for this
team.
"Early on in the season we
were struggling to find a system
and a rhythm that would fit our
players," Sawyers said. "We were
living off individual brilliance and
team chemistry was helping a lot
during those times. In the second
half of the season we really found
a system which worked for us and
did a great job executing game
plans. We had everybody totally
fit and then came into the Final
Four, where you roll the dice.
"We're a young team — we
only lose one playing senior, we'll
bounce back. The first thing I've
got to tell them is how proud I am
of them."
One of the most important
parts to come out of Stanford's
Final Four experience was the
chance for Rafanelli to play in the
collegiate spotlight for once in her
career.
"I'm so glad that she got to
appear in a Final Four before she
graduated," Sawyers said. "She's
been a huge factor this year for
us."
Although Rafanelli saw her col
lege career come to an end on Fri
day, she will look back on this year
with fond memories.
"I'm very proud of the team,
and very happy with the year,"
she said. "This is definitely the
best year I've had personally, in
terms of team chemistry and
coaching. I couldn't have asked
for a better year. I would love to
congratulate each of my team
mates — they played awesomely
this year."
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. - Shocked.
Afler two 45-minute halves, four 15-
minute overtimes and four penalty
kicks, that is the only word to describe
the Stanford women's soccer team.
Stanford's Final Four dream of
unseating No. 1 North Carolina came to
a crashing halt as No. 10 George Mason
upset the second-ranked Cardinal Fri
day in a game decided by penalty kicks
on the dark, rain-soaked pitch of North
Carolina's Fetzer Field.
After playing to a 1-1 tie through reg
ulation, the Stanford-George Mason
semifinal was extended by the four over
time periods, the last two being sudden
death sessions. However, the score was
still knotted after the extra hour of play.
The Patriots then topped the Cardinal 3-
1 on penalty kicks, and thereby ad
vanced to the championship game
against North Carolina. In the final, the
Tar Heels' blistering attack over
whelmed George Mason, 6-0, giving Car
olina their eighth consecutive NCAA
title.
But the Patriots' loss gave the Cardi
nal little solace. "I'm devastated," said
head coach lan Sawyers. "It's a weird
feeling. It's more of a feeling of the play
ers having worked so hard all season to
get in this position, and right when it's
in their grasp, it's stolen away. There's a
sense of being burgled."
After a first half in which the Cardi
nal controlled the ball but couldn't find
the net, Stanford took a 1-0 lead in the
64th minute when sophomore midfield
er Carmel Murphy put in an errant
rebound off freshman Erin Martin's
shot. It was Murphy's ninth goal of the
year and her second in the last two
games.
Stanford remained in control
throughout the second half, and almost
extended its lead to 2-0 with less than 20
minutes left in the game when Martin
raced ahead of two defenders, setting up
a one-on-one play against Mason's goal
keeper. However, Martin was whistled
for being offsides and play was halted
before she could get off a shot.
Then, with 9:11 left in the game,

Patriot forward Jenn Gross slipped
behind the Stanford defense and put a
shot past a diving Leslie Garrard, knot
ting the score at 1-1. During regulation
play, the Cardinal defense limited
Mason to seven shots on goal, compared
to the 11 shots Stanford took.
"I was just in the right place at the
right time," said Gross.
After four scoreless overtime periods,
penalty kicks made the decision of who
was to advance to the championship
game. Normally, a tie game is decided on
penalty kicks afler two overtime periods.
For the Final Four, however, officials
added the two sudden-death overtimes
in hopes of avoiding the awkward proce
dure of reducing the game to five one-on
one matchups.
"It's such a crapshoot," Sawyers said
of the kicks. "You just have to tell your
kids 'whatever happens, happens. I
believe in you — just do what you can.'
When it gets to that stage, we've done all
we can, basically, and we just have to
take our chances."
Stanford won the coin toss and elect
ed to kick first, with each team alternat
ing shots. Sarah Rafanelli's shot was
stopped by Patriot keeper Skye Eddy,
and Gross's shot sailed over Garrard's
diving body. Jessica Fischer's blast rico
chetted off the right post, and George
Mason midfielder Amanda Mitchell
pushed the Patriot lead to 2-0 with her
goal.
Next up for the Cardinal was Martin,
who faked right and put the shot in the
left corner for the goal. However, George
Mason also found the back of the net as
Sherry Worsham fired another shot into
the Stanford goal. Needing to make the
next shot for the Cardinal to stay alive,
Murphy's shot was turned away by
Eddy, ending the game three hours and
15 minutes afler it started.
"You create your own luck, and
maybe today wasn't our day," Sawyers
said. "I just feel a lot of pain for our play
ers, because they are tremendous people
to work with, and I want them to feel
elation instead of how they feel now."
Stanford ends the season with an 18-
2-2 record, with the Final Four semifinal
not considered a loss. Officially, the
game is recorded as a 1-1 tie, with

George Mason advancing on penalty
shots.
The Cardinal dominated play for
nearly every minute of the two-and-a
half hour marathon. Although the first
half was mostly an adjustment period
for both teams, Stanford began to assert
its power in the second half. Rafanelli
regularly took on and beat two players
on her way to the goal, but the Cardinal
couldn't finish its scoring chances.
"In the attacking third of the field, we
just couldn't seem to convert our great
chances," Sawyers said. "She IRafanellil
was getting the crosses in, but unfortu
nately we didn't get into scoring posi
tion. We just didn't put away our
chances, and at this level, if you don't
put away your chances, it's hard to win."
In the first two overtimes, despite the
loss of Rafanelli for several minutes to a
rib injury, Stanford had several chances
which they couldn't convert. Two min
utes into the first extra period, Murphy
sent a shot off the crossbar. In the sec
ond overtime, a crossing pass from Dena
Dey, who replaced Rafanelli, scooted
past both Martin and Murphy in front of
the Patriot goal. After 30 minutes of
overtime, Stanford outshot George
Mason 15-8, but still couldn't get the
ball past Eddy, who made 10 saves in the
game.
The skies opened up just as the first
sudden-death overtime began. However,
the rains did not slow the Cardinal down
as it sent several more excellent serves
into the box. Freshman Wendy Latimer
had a free kick and a corner kick, which
were both turned away by opportunistic
Patriot defense.
During the second sudden-death
overtime, the adrenaline and excitement
of the game began to wear down, as both
teams seemed a step slower. Stanford
had one final chance to pull out a dra
matic victory with 30 seconds left in the
period, as a pass from Latimer to Dey
skipped over the cross bar. The game
then ended in a tie, with the decision left
to the penalty kicks. For the game, Stan
ford outshot George Mason 19-9, limit
ing the Patriots to just two shots in the
entire hour of overtime action.


Sasha Mitelman — Daily file
Senior Sarah Rafanelli makes a run for NCAA glory. However, the Cardinal fell a little
short over the weekend in a 3-1 upset at the hands of George Mason.
"We've been working on penal
ty kicks for the last two weeks,
getting ready for the tourna
ment," said George Mason coach
Jac Cicala. "We've been working
not only on the execution but the
psychological attitude of taking a
PK."
In all, George Mason defeated
three higher-ranked teams to get
to the championship game. Top
ping No. 3 Notre Dame and No. 9
Wisconsin in the Central Regional
Tournament, the Patriots added
No. 2 Stanford to their list of
upsets.
