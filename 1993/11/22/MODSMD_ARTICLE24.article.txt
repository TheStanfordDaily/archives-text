# Polo drowns in Big Splash
## Stanford slips by Pacific, loses to California 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
It's showtime.
With the NCAA Tournament
less than a week away, the Stan
ford water polo team wrapped
up its regular-season play with
two of its most exciting games of
the year. The Cardinal (21-6)
downed No. 5 Pacific 5-4 Friday
before being stung by No. 2 Cal
ifornia Saturday by a score of
10-9.
The weekend split had little
effect on the rankings, as the
NCAA seeding committee an
nounced its awarding of the No.
1 seed to Stanford yesterday

morning. Cal will be seeded sec
ond, followed by USC, UC-
Irvine and UOP.
Stanford showed all of its
weapons last weekend, begin
ning with the tough team
defense which led the squad to a
15-1 record halfway through the
season. The Cardinal smothered
the Tigers' counterattack, allow
ing just one goal in transition.
Senior goaltender Larry Bercutt
blocked a career-high 16 shots,
including 10 in the first half.
"It was a great defensive
effort," Bercutt said. "We shut
down their counterattack which
is one of their prime weapons.
The offense was getting open

shots and the defense really
stepped up.
"We're back to the point now
where I know what we're doing
on defense," he said. "There are
not as many individual break
downs. I knew where to expect
their shots from."
While Bercutt consistently
denied UOP defensively, the key
to the Cardinal's home-pool win
was the offensive play of junior
holeman Frank Schneider.
"Frank pretty much won the
game for us," said coach Dante
Dettamanti. "He drew ejections,
drew penalty shots and scored."
It was so close that a turn move
by Schneider with 1:03 remaining
proved to be the difference. Schnei
der was rewarded for his efforts
with a penalty shot, which Antonio
Busqets scored to give the Cardi
nal its first lead of the day at 5-4.
"We got their main hole defend
er in foul trouble early," Schneider
said. "I kept working for foul after
foul. I knew sooner or later I'd get
paid off with a kick out or four
meter (penalty shot). The main
thing was the consecutive fouls.
They had to adjust defensively."
On Saturday, the Big Splash,
held in deGuerre pool, was also
decided with just more than a
minute to play, but the winning
goal was tossed in by Cal's Mike
Sparling to lift the Bears to a 10-9
win.
The Cardinal found themselves
down 4-0 at the end of the first
quarter after two-point shots by
Sparling and Ted Lilligren. Stan
ford regrouped at the break and
came roaring back, outscoring the
Bears 6-2 in the second quarter to
go into halftime tied at six.
"I'm really pleased with the way
we played," Dettamanti said. "It
was a great effort on our part. A lot
of teams would have folded after
two early two-point shots. It really
takes the wind out of your sails."

The Stanford rally was a team
effort, as seven players scored
goals, including the starting six.
Quick passing in man-advantage
situations led to scoring opportuni
ties, as Brian Clemens found
Schneider and Chris Wallin open
inside for goals.
After Cal broke the halftime tie
with a point early in the third,
Stanford rallied back, scoring the
next three goals to take a 9-7 lead.
The Golden Bears scored first in
the fourth on a roll-out shot by Ail-
American holeman Troy Barn hart,
but the Cardinal clung to its slim 9-
8 lead for the next five minutes.
Then Sparling struck. With 1:03
showing on the game-clock, the
left-hander, left unguarded eight
meters from the cage, fired the ball
past Bercutt for two points and a
10-9 Cardinal lead.
"The last (two-pointer) should
have been mine," Bercutt said. "We
should have been pressing in that
situation, but it's a shot I should
have."
Even in defeat, Dettamanti and
assistant coach Ben Quittner were
pleased with the team's play.
"We had a good performance
from everyone," Dettamanti said.
"I liked how we were still aggres
sive in the fourth quarter with a
two-point lead. We weren't just
playing to protect the lead. We had
opportunities to score in the fourth
quarter."
Quittner pointed to the team's
outstanding second quarter as evi

dence that Stanford is ready to
compete at the NCAA Champi
onships.
"After being down by four in the
first quarter, we scored six goals — no
two-pointers, we scored six times in

the second quarter," Quittner said.
"That shows that we have balls."
Stanford will travel to Belmont
Plaza Olympic Pool in Long
Beach, Calif., this week for the
NCAAs.

1 seed to Stanford yesterday

morning. Cal will be seeded sec
ond, followed by USC, UC-
Irvine and UOP.
Stanford showed all of its
weapons last weekend, begin
ning with the tough team
defense which led the squad to a
15-1 record halfway through the
season. The Cardinal smothered
the Tigers' counterattack, allow
ing just one goal in transition.
Senior goaltender Larry Bercutt
blocked a career-high 16 shots,
including 10 in the first half.
"It was a great defensive
effort," Bercutt said. "We shut
down their counterattack which
is one of their prime weapons.
The offense was getting open

shots and the defense really
stepped up.
"We're back to the point now
where I know what we're doing
on defense," he said. "There are
not as many individual break
downs. I knew where to expect
their shots from."
While Bercutt consistently
denied UOP defensively, the key
to the Cardinal's home-pool win
was the offensive play of junior
holeman Frank Schneider.
"Frank pretty much won the
game for us," said coach Dante
Dettamanti. "He drew ejections,
drew penalty shots and scored."
It was so close that a turn move
by Schneider with 1:03 remaining
proved to be the difference. Schnei
der was rewarded for his efforts
with a penalty shot, which Antonio
Busqets scored to give the Cardi
nal its first lead of the day at 5-4.
"We got their main hole defend
er in foul trouble early," Schneider
said. "I kept working for foul after
foul. I knew sooner or later I'd get
paid off with a kick out or four
meter (penalty shot). The main
thing was the consecutive fouls.
They had to adjust defensively."
On Saturday, the Big Splash,
held in deGuerre pool, was also
decided with just more than a
minute to play, but the winning
goal was tossed in by Cal's Mike
Sparling to lift the Bears to a 10-9
win.
The Cardinal found themselves
down 4-0 at the end of the first
quarter after two-point shots by
Sparling and Ted Lilligren. Stan
ford regrouped at the break and
came roaring back, outscoring the
Bears 6-2 in the second quarter to
go into halftime tied at six.
"I'm really pleased with the way
we played," Dettamanti said. "It
was a great effort on our part. A lot
of teams would have folded after
two early two-point shots. It really
takes the wind out of your sails."

The Stanford rally was a team
effort, as seven players scored
goals, including the starting six.
Quick passing in man-advantage
situations led to scoring opportuni
ties, as Brian Clemens found
Schneider and Chris Wallin open
inside for goals.
After Cal broke the halftime tie
with a point early in the third,
Stanford rallied back, scoring the
next three goals to take a 9-7 lead.
The Golden Bears scored first in
the fourth on a roll-out shot by Ail-
American holeman Troy Barn hart,
but the Cardinal clung to its slim 9-
8 lead for the next five minutes.
Then Sparling struck. With 1:03
showing on the game-clock, the
left-hander, left unguarded eight
meters from the cage, fired the ball
past Bercutt for two points and a
10-9 Cardinal lead.
"The last (two-pointer) should
have been mine," Bercutt said. "We
should have been pressing in that
situation, but it's a shot I should
have."
Even in defeat, Dettamanti and
assistant coach Ben Quittner were
pleased with the team's play.
"We had a good performance
from everyone," Dettamanti said.
"I liked how we were still aggres
sive in the fourth quarter with a
two-point lead. We weren't just
playing to protect the lead. We had
opportunities to score in the fourth
quarter."
Quittner pointed to the team's
outstanding second quarter as evi

dence that Stanford is ready to
compete at the NCAA Champi
onships.
"After being down by four in the
first quarter, we scored six goals — no
two-pointers, we scored six times in

the second quarter," Quittner said.
"That shows that we have balls."
Stanford will travel to Belmont
Plaza Olympic Pool in Long
Beach, Calif., this week for the
NCAAs.
