It's showtime.
With the NCAA Tournament
less than a week away, the Stan
ford water polo team wrapped
up its regular-season play with
two of its most exciting games of
the year. The Cardinal (21-6)
downed No. 5 Pacific 5-4 Friday
before being stung by No. 2 Cal
ifornia Saturday by a score of
10-9.
The weekend split had little
effect on the rankings, as the
NCAA seeding committee an
nounced its awarding of the No.
1 seed to Stanford yesterday

morning. Cal will be seeded sec
ond, followed by USC, UC-
Irvine and UOP.
Stanford showed all of its
weapons last weekend, begin
ning with the tough team
defense which led the squad to a
15-1 record halfway through the
season. The Cardinal smothered
the Tigers' counterattack, allow
ing just one goal in transition.
Senior goaltender Larry Bercutt
blocked a career-high 16 shots,
including 10 in the first half.
"It was a great defensive
effort," Bercutt said. "We shut
down their counterattack which
is one of their prime weapons.
The offense was getting open

shots and the defense really
stepped up.
"We're back to the point now
where I know what we're doing
on defense," he said. "There are
not as many individual break
downs. I knew where to expect
their shots from."
While Bercutt consistently
denied UOP defensively, the key
to the Cardinal's home-pool win
was the offensive play of junior
holeman Frank Schneider.
"Frank pretty much won the
game for us," said coach Dante
Dettamanti. "He drew ejections,
drew penalty shots and scored."
