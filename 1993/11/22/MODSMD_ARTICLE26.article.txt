# Runners race toward
## NCAA Championship 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
All year long, the eighth-ranked
Stanford women's cross-country
team has risen to the challenge,
finishing either first or second in
eveiy meet in which they have par
ticipated.
Even when the Cardinal did not
win, it took teams such as No. 1
Arkansas, No. 3 Michigan and No.
4 Brigham Young to outpace
them. And with its victories over
perennial powers such as Oregon
and Arizona at the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships, Stanford
has clearly staked a place for itself
among the nation's elite teams. No
matter how fierce the competition,
Stanford has been ready to run â€”
anywhere, anytime.
And today, the Cardinal's sea
son-long race will end at the
NCAA Championships at Lehigh
University in Pennsylvania.
The NCAAs will feature only
the best the country has to offer.
All 22 squads present are ranked
in the nation's top 25. Among
these teams are the top 18 squads
in the nation, along with No. 20
Rice, No. 21 Nebraska and No. 25
North Carolina.
But as head coach Vin Lananna
pointed out, the Cardinal is no
stranger to high-caliber opposi
tion. Earlier in the season, Stan
ford raced against the likes of
sixth-ranked Arizona, 11th
ranked Alabama and co-No. 14's

Oregon and Notre Dame, and the
Cardinal has beaten them all. So,
as far as Stanford is concerned, the
NCAAs will be business as usual.
"We just have to do what we've
been doing," said senior captain
Sarah Truitt. "It's really crowded
at nationals and we don't want our
runners getting displaced. We just
have to pack up as a team."
All season, Lananna has con
centrated on what Stanford can do
itself, not what Stanford can do in
comparison to whomever it races.
So far, that mindset has enabled
the Cardinal to not only compete
with squads ranked higher than
itself, but also beat schools that
were supposedly better.
"At NCAAs, it's just a matter of
running with confidence," Lanan
na said. "We've competed with a
lot of these teams already, and
we've beaten several of them. We
should be able to beat those teams,
and also beat some teams we
aren't supposed to beat."
Senior Louise Watson will pro
vide some of that confidence, as
well as experience. Last year, Wat
son qualified for NCAAs as an
individual by winning the District
-8 race. And while the team will
look for her guidance, Watson will
look toward her team to help her
obtain her personal goals.
"I want to be Ail-American,"
Watson said. "Every race this year
I tried to get better. I hope to use
