# Close, but no cigar
## Bruins top Cardinal spikers 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
While Big Game may have
ended with a lopsided defeat, the
Stanford women's volleyball team
challenged its own archrival to a
much closer contest this weekend.
Unfortunately, the extra effort
was not quite enough to scrape
out a win.

Closing out its Pacific 10 Con
ference season, the sixth-ranked
Cardinal (20-6, 13-5 in the Pacific
10 Conference) fell to No. 1 UCLA
(26-1, 17-1 in the Pac-10) on Fri
day night by a score of 9-15, 15-
12, 10-15, 15-5, 14-16 in a match
which literally came down to the
last point.
"These are two good teams
going at each other," said Stan

ford coach Don Shaw. "Both
teams played hard, this rivalry is
like that â€” they managed to get
two points more than we did in
the end, and that was the differ
ence."
After an impressive start in
game one, Stanford's blocks could
not withstand a UCLA offense
that was quickly warming up. The
visiting Bruins ran off five
straight points for a 3-8 lead and
then outlasted an error-plagued
Cardinal to extend the lead to 4-
12. Sophomore Marnie Triefen
bach's left-side smash led a Stan
ford resurgence near the end of
the game but the effort proved too
little, too late, as the Cardinal fell
9-15.
In an extremely hard-fought
second game, Stanford was able
to widen its offensive options,
opening its attack to include both
the middle as well as the sides.
Freshman middle blocker Nikki
Otto played a key role in the Car
dinal onslaught, slamming down
a crucial smash for a 6-3 lead. The
Bruins battled back to even the
score at 9-9 before Stanford final
ly pulled out the win.
"Sometimes we're so good and
do so many great things, we just
need to work on staying focused
for the whole match and not have
as many lulls," said junior tri-cap
tain Anne Wicks.
Unfortunately, one of these
moments of weakness came in the
end of game three. After junior
Denise Rotert and freshman
Katherine Juillard both entered
the match to provide key digs for
Stanford, the Cardinal led during
the first half of the game. A string
of Stanford errors, however,
opened up the way for a second
UCLA victory.
The momentum rapidly shift
ed in Stanford s favor in game
four as Wicks s float serve spark
ed the Cardinal to a 9-0 lead.
Later, Senior Heidi Eick and
freshman middle blocker Eileen
Murfee reached for the stuff
which solidified the win.
"We changed the rotation a lit*
f.li 7 -' n K ame four," Shaw said.
We tried to get some new match
ups and got a couple of different
people in there We used all 12
people tonight pretty extensively
and that was the kind of match
we wanted."
