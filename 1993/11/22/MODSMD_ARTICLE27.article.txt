# Close, but no cigar
## Bruins top Cardinal spikers 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
While Big Game may have
ended with a lopsided defeat, the
Stanford women's volleyball team
challenged its own archrival to a
much closer contest this weekend.
Unfortunately, the extra effort
was not quite enough to scrape
out a win.

Closing out its Pacific 10 Con
ference season, the sixth-ranked
Cardinal (20-6, 13-5 in the Pacific
10 Conference) fell to No. 1 UCLA
(26-1, 17-1 in the Pac-10) on Fri
day night by a score of 9-15, 15-
12, 10-15, 15-5, 14-16 in a match
which literally came down to the
last point.
"These are two good teams
going at each other," said Stan

ford coach Don Shaw. "Both
teams played hard, this rivalry is
like that — they managed to get
two points more than we did in
the end, and that was the differ
ence."
After an impressive start in
game one, Stanford's blocks could
not withstand a UCLA offense
that was quickly warming up. The
visiting Bruins ran off five
straight points for a 3-8 lead and
then outlasted an error-plagued
Cardinal to extend the lead to 4-
12. Sophomore Marnie Triefen
bach's left-side smash led a Stan
ford resurgence near the end of
the game but the effort proved too
little, too late, as the Cardinal fell
9-15.
In an extremely hard-fought
second game, Stanford was able
to widen its offensive options,
opening its attack to include both
the middle as well as the sides.
Freshman middle blocker Nikki
Otto played a key role in the Car
dinal onslaught, slamming down
a crucial smash for a 6-3 lead. The
Bruins battled back to even the
score at 9-9 before Stanford final
ly pulled out the win.
"Sometimes we're so good and
do so many great things, we just
need to work on staying focused
for the whole match and not have
as many lulls," said junior tri-cap
tain Anne Wicks.
Unfortunately, one of these
moments of weakness came in the
end of game three. After junior
Denise Rotert and freshman
Katherine Juillard both entered
the match to provide key digs for
Stanford, the Cardinal led during
the first half of the game. A string
of Stanford errors, however,
opened up the way for a second
UCLA victory.
The momentum rapidly shift
ed in Stanford s favor in game
four as Wicks s float serve spark
ed the Cardinal to a 9-0 lead.
Later, Senior Heidi Eick and
freshman middle blocker Eileen
Murfee reached for the stuff
which solidified the win.
"We changed the rotation a lit*
f.li 7 -' n K ame four," Shaw said.
We tried to get some new match
ups and got a couple of different
people in there We used all 12
people tonight pretty extensively
and that was the kind of match
we wanted."

proved they were up to the final
challenge. Slipping behind 5-8, the
Cardinal found itself playing a
frantic game of catch-up through
out the rest of the game. Sopho
more Wendy Hromadka swung for
two key kills, as Stanford battled
back to tie the game at 14-14. But
then the Bruins took the last two
points for the game and the match.
"When you get that far behind
in rally scoring, it's a real credit to
our players to come back and tie at
14 all," Shaw said. "We were con

stantly trying to claw back tonight,
as opposed to starting out well,
being in charge and letting them do
the catching up. Instead, we were
always catching up and that's not
easy to do against a good team."
As Stanford's offensive power
house throughout the match,
Triefenbach swung for a career
high 28 kills while also leading the
Cardinal defense with a match-high
23 digs. Sophomore Cary Wendell
slammed down 12 kills and 16 digs
while Wicks and Hromadka came
though for 10 kills apiece.
Leading the Bruin attack, junior
outside hitter Annett Buckner
proved her Pac-10 Player of Week
recognition was well deserved, as

she swung for 21 kills and added 15
digs. Freshman middle blocker Kim
Krull registered 18 kills, followed by
senior middle blocker Irene Rente
ria and junior outside hitter Alyson
Randick with 13 and 14 kills, respec
tively.
While Friday night's match was
decided by a narrow, two-point
margin, the loss was somewhat off
set by the Cardinal's firm sweep of
No. 13 USC at Maples Pavilion on
Thursday night. Clinching what
Shaw considered the most impor
tant match of the week and possibly
of the season, Stanford secured sec
ond place in the conference and
most likely will receive a first-round
bye in the NCAA tournament.

With its Pac-10 standings and
postseason rankings fairly well
decided, the UCLA match meant
little to Stanford with regard to
numbers, but was vitally impor
tant to the team's spirit. After los
ing to the Bruins in September, the
Cardinal had hoped to gain revenge
this weekend — a pay-back that
will now have to wait until the
NCAA tournament.
Coach Shaw is confident that
the Cardinal will have the opportu
nity to avenge Friday's defeat.
"Usually, Stanford or UCLA has a
major hand in whoever wins the
national championship, it usually
comes down to one of the two of us
— we'll probably see them again."

need to work on staying focused

Unfortunately, one of these
moments of weakness came in the

proved they were up to the final
challenge. Slipping behind 5-8, the
Cardinal found itself playing a
frantic game of catch-up through
out the rest of the game. Sopho
more Wendy Hromadka swung for
two key kills, as Stanford battled
back to tie the game at 14-14. But
then the Bruins took the last two
points for the game and the match.
"When you get that far behind
in rally scoring, it's a real credit to
our players to come back and tie at
14 all," Shaw said. "We were con

stantly trying to claw back tonight,
as opposed to starting out well,
being in charge and letting them do
the catching up. Instead, we were
always catching up and that's not
easy to do against a good team."
As Stanford's offensive power
house throughout the match,
Triefenbach swung for a career
high 28 kills while also leading the
Cardinal defense with a match-high
23 digs. Sophomore Cary Wendell
slammed down 12 kills and 16 digs
while Wicks and Hromadka came
though for 10 kills apiece.
Leading the Bruin attack, junior
outside hitter Annett Buckner
proved her Pac-10 Player of Week
recognition was well deserved, as

she swung for 21 kills and added 15
digs. Freshman middle blocker Kim
Krull registered 18 kills, followed by
senior middle blocker Irene Rente
ria and junior outside hitter Alyson
Randick with 13 and 14 kills, respec
tively.
While Friday night's match was
decided by a narrow, two-point
margin, the loss was somewhat off
set by the Cardinal's firm sweep of
No. 13 USC at Maples Pavilion on
Thursday night. Clinching what
Shaw considered the most impor
tant match of the week and possibly
of the season, Stanford secured sec
ond place in the conference and
most likely will receive a first-round
bye in the NCAA tournament.

With its Pac-10 standings and
postseason rankings fairly well
decided, the UCLA match meant
little to Stanford with regard to
numbers, but was vitally impor
tant to the team's spirit. After los
ing to the Bruins in September, the
Cardinal had hoped to gain revenge
this weekend — a pay-back that
will now have to wait until the
NCAA tournament.
Coach Shaw is confident that
the Cardinal will have the opportu
nity to avenge Friday's defeat.
"Usually, Stanford or UCLA has a
major hand in whoever wins the
national championship, it usually
comes down to one of the two of us
— we'll probably see them again."
While Big Game may have
ended with a lopsided defeat, the
Stanford women's volleyball team
challenged its own archrival to a
much closer contest this weekend.
Unfortunately, the extra effort
was not quite enough to scrape
out a win.

Closing out its Pacific 10 Con
ference season, the sixth-ranked
Cardinal (20-6, 13-5 in the Pacific
10 Conference) fell to No. 1 UCLA
(26-1, 17-1 in the Pac-10) on Fri
day night by a score of 9-15, 15-
12, 10-15, 15-5, 14-16 in a match
which literally came down to the
last point.
"These are two good teams
going at each other," said Stan

ford coach Don Shaw. "Both
teams played hard, this rivalry is
like that — they managed to get
two points more than we did in
the end, and that was the differ
ence."
After an impressive start in
game one, Stanford's blocks could
not withstand a UCLA offense
that was quickly warming up. The
visiting Bruins ran off five
straight points for a 3-8 lead and
then outlasted an error-plagued
Cardinal to extend the lead to 4-
12. Sophomore Marnie Triefen
bach's left-side smash led a Stan
ford resurgence near the end of
the game but the effort proved too
little, too late, as the Cardinal fell
9-15.
In an extremely hard-fought
second game, Stanford was able
to widen its offensive options,
opening its attack to include both
the middle as well as the sides.
Freshman middle blocker Nikki
Otto played a key role in the Car
dinal onslaught, slamming down
a crucial smash for a 6-3 lead. The
Bruins battled back to even the
score at 9-9 before Stanford final
ly pulled out the win.
