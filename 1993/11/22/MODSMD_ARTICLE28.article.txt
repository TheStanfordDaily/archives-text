# Greg slaps a yellow card on penalty kicks
## 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
The feeling hasn't gotten better with time.
After following a team for a season, seeing
it end is never easy. Seeing it end after four
overtimes and five penalty kicks is just about
the worst way imaginable. For the Cardinal
women's soccer team, it definitely deserved
more, as did George Mason. After achieving
so much in a season, neither team should go
home from the Final Four because they
couldn't make their penalty shots.
Part of the allure of soccer (and part of
what turns people off) is that a single goal is
so important. A game is turned around in
just a single moment, propelling one team to
victory and the other to the showers.
Holding teams scoreless was the norm for
Stanford in 1993. Goalkeeper Leslie Garrard
allowed seven goals all year heading into
Final Four play. She and the rest of the Car
dinal team shut out 17 opponents this year.
They held fast for 81 minutes against George
Mason, let in one goal, and then were impen
etrable for another 68 minutes through four
overtimes. Unfortunately, Mason was equal
to the task, shutting down just enough of
Stanford's chances to push the game to a
shootout.
A season of 22 games, with two going into
overtime and the eternity of this Final Four
semifinal, comes out to 2,100 minutes. Thir
ty-five hours of play throughout the season
with each game won or lost on the strength of
the team, and it all comes down to five penal
ty kicks. A crapshoot, according to head
coach lan Sawyers, and Stanford just came
up snake-eyes.
Probably the hardest job for any
sportswriter is interviewing a team which
has just lost a game of the magnitude found
in the Final Four. Watching sports my entire

life did not prepare me for this. No amount of
preparation can get you ready for the emo
tions surrounding a loss of this type.
Take Sarah Rafanelli, for example. The
smile was still there in the post-game press
conference, but you know that the All-Ameri
can would like just one more chance to race
down the sideline in a Stanford uniform, to be
part of the team to which she has devoted the
last four years of her life. The end was not
supposed to come this soon, this suddenly.

Although somewhere in the back of my
mind I already knew this, my experience this
year showed how little a team cares about
individual statistics or giving a good sound
bite. Sports journalism stresses these easily
identified aspects too much. What should be
brought to life is the camaraderie, the emo
tions tied to the team and the real people who
are involved.
These are not mindless automatons carted
out every weekend for a game, then shoved
back into the closet. These are individuals
who have put their lives into the sport. One
player commented that this will be the first
Thanksgiving she'll be home for in five or six
years. She's been devoting her life to soccer,
and there are always games or camps or
something taking place during the holidays.
That is part of a team — giving up individual
needs.

"We're all different, but I think we'd just
about do anything for each other," Rafanelli
said.
It may sound trite, but after spending
time with this team, I know it's true. Every
thing the team says about valuing the time
and friendships made, I now understand.
Teams put too much effort into a season to
see it end on something as arbitrary as
penalty kicks. It deserves a solid, tangible
end to the season based on the merits of the
team as a whole.
Few real soccer fans believe penalty kicks
are the right way to end a game. Unfortu
nately, it is the "American" sports mentality,
the one-on-one confrontation so rare in regu
lation soccer play, that ultimately decides
these unbelievably close games.
Maybe a replay of the game, scheduled the
next day, would help settle the dispute.
Unfortunately, neither the time nor the
money exists for the NCAA to respect the
wishes of a relatively few number of fans and
players and settle this cleanly. Regardless,
no soccer team's season should be reduced to
five shots.
Part of the brilliance of this team, and any
team in general, is the way the individual
personalities blend together to form the
team. Team chemistry requires a difficult
balance of coaching intervention and players'
initiative. If you just think that a team is a
unit without individuals, you take credit
away from each member of the team and you
forget the individual hearts and desires
which are hidden behind the shield of the
"team." You are left with just a shell, aban
doning the real reason so many people play
sports — for the team.
Team chemistry got this team to the Final
Four, and it should have left North Carolina
knowing that it was the team which deter
mined its fate, not five individual shots.
