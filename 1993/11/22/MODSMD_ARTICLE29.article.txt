On Thursday, six Stanford
athletic legends were inducted
into the school's Hall of Fame
at the annual Red and White

The inductees were John
Elway (football), Dick Gould
(head coach, women's tennis),
Marybeth Linzmeier (Dorst)
(swimming), Pablo Morales
(swimming), Darrin Nelson
(football) and John Ralston
(head coach, football).
The Stanford Athletic Hall
of Fame now includes 241
members, though it was sus

demic year.
To be eligible for the Hall,
athletes must have finished

their Stanford careers at least
five years ago, while coaches
must have completed five years
as a head coach at Stanford or
have left Stanford at least five
years ago.
"The six people inducted
into the hall of Fame this year
symbolizes the quality of ath
letic excellence that is a very
important part of the heritage
of Stanford University," said
Athletic Director Ted Leland.
"The entire Stanford commu
nity can be proud that our Uni
versity produces athletes and
coaches of this caliber."
The new members of the
Hall will be formally inducted
in June of 1994.
