# Violence mars Berkeley victory Bear fans attack Band,-Tree, goalpost
## 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
Although most Stanford fans didn't stay
long enough to see it, the aftermath of Sat
urday's Big Game was even uglier than the
game itself.
Hundreds of UC-Berkeley students
rushed the field after the Bears' 46-17 tri
umph over the Cardinal, bringing down the
goalpost in the south end zone and tearing
up the grass in Stanford Stadium.
The Cal students stayed in the stands for
about 20 minutes after the game before
moving toward the blockade police had
made around the Cal sections. Eventually,
police let down the fence separating the
stands and the playing field — and the
melee began.

Cal fans tore off chunks of grass and
hurled them at the Stanford Band. Other
fans, chanting "We want the Axe," ripped
up portions of the midfield turf, which had
the Axe painted on it.
After tearing down the south goal post, a
group of fans converged on the other side of
the field. A circle of police officers clad in
riot gear kept fans away from the north
goal post.
Axe Committee member Andrew Nevins
said he was a "little surprised because the
cops weren't doing anything" to stop the
post-game fracas.
But Nevins added that he was more dis
appointed in the Cal students than in the
police. "If they lose they handle it poorly,

and if they win they handle it poor
ly," he said.
Stanford Athletic Director Ted
Leland agreed. "It was hooligan
ism. It was ridiculous. It was the
third year in a row Cal students
haven't been able to control them
selves. They seem to feel they now
have a tradition of thuggery, and
we're going to have to find a way to
stop it."
Leland, however, added that he
"thought the police did as good a
job as they possibly could."
Several fans were apprehended
for game-related disruptions, but
the exact number of arrests and
citations will not be compiled until
today, Stanford Police officer Mark
Swineford said.
At last year's game, held at
Berkeley, Cal fans hurled fruit and
other objects at the Band and the
cheerleaders, and also attacked
?Flag Boy" and the Tree. These
incidents led officials from both
schools to make more concerted
efforts to increase goodwill

between the schools, such as hav
ing the University heads shake
hands before the game and
exchanging the Axe off the field.
In addition, Leland said he had
hoped tensions would be lessened
this year by having the two bands
play the national anthem together.
But that didn't happen.
Asst. Athletic Director Tom
Beckett, chair of the 1994 Big
Game Committee, refused to blame
any particular group. "The enthu
siasm in celebration of a victory
brought about the action. I just
think we need to do some things
differently to tiy to protect the
safety of all concerned," he said.
"We couldn't go down [on the
field to playl because it was too
dangerous," said freshman Katie
Beman, a drummer in the Band.
"There was such an incredible mob
of people throwing things at us. A
lot of [band members| were saying
they don't even want to go to
Berkeley next year if the crowd
control is that bad. The rivalry is
just getting completely out of con
trol."
"It was scary," said junior Jeff
Allison, another Band member.
"About 30 people got down on the

field and started ripping down the
goalposts. [Then | more people just
kept coming down. I thought they
were going to come after us. The
cops didn't do anything except pro
tect the other goalposts."
During the halftime show, a few
Cal fans tried to tackle the Tree,
sophomore Charles Good an. The
Band broke formation and went
after the attackers.
"I was frolicking around, and all
of a sudden the crowd started
screaming. One guy touches me
and another pulled me down. I got
in a couple of hits," Goodan said.
"One guy actually got to the
Tree and wrapped him up," Allison
said, "but he paid the price."
Leland commended the Band on
their display of discipline amid the
chaos. "I thought our band [mem
bers] were the real superstars, and
I realize the irony of an athletic
official saying" that, Leland said,
referring to the Stanford Band's
reputation for being rowdy and
often out of control.
He added that it was too early to
determine the extent of damages to
the stadium's field. A report esti
mating the cost of damages will be
filed with Leland today.

Although most Stanford fans didn't stay
long enough to see it, the aftermath of Sat
urday's Big Game was even uglier than the
game itself.
Hundreds of UC-Berkeley students
rushed the field after the Bears' 46-17 tri
umph over the Cardinal, bringing down the
goalpost in the south end zone and tearing
up the grass in Stanford Stadium.
The Cal students stayed in the stands for
about 20 minutes after the game before
moving toward the blockade police had
made around the Cal sections. Eventually,
police let down the fence separating the
stands and the playing field — and the
melee began.

Cal fans tore off chunks of grass and
hurled them at the Stanford Band. Other
fans, chanting "We want the Axe," ripped
up portions of the midfield turf, which had
the Axe painted on it.
After tearing down the south goal post, a
group of fans converged on the other side of
the field. A circle of police officers clad in
riot gear kept fans away from the north
goal post.
Axe Committee member Andrew Nevins
said he was a "little surprised because the
cops weren't doing anything" to stop the
post-game fracas.
But Nevins added that he was more dis
appointed in the Cal students than in the
police. "If they lose they handle it poorly,

and if they win they handle it poor
ly," he said.
Stanford Athletic Director Ted
Leland agreed. "It was hooligan
ism. It was ridiculous. It was the
third year in a row Cal students
haven't been able to control them
selves. They seem to feel they now
have a tradition of thuggery, and
we're going to have to find a way to
stop it."
Leland, however, added that he
"thought the police did as good a
job as they possibly could."
Several fans were apprehended
for game-related disruptions, but
the exact number of arrests and
citations will not be compiled until
today, Stanford Police officer Mark
Swineford said.
At last year's game, held at
Berkeley, Cal fans hurled fruit and
other objects at the Band and the
cheerleaders, and also attacked
?Flag Boy" and the Tree. These
incidents led officials from both
schools to make more concerted
efforts to increase goodwill

between the schools, such as hav
ing the University heads shake
hands before the game and
exchanging the Axe off the field.
In addition, Leland said he had
hoped tensions would be lessened
this year by having the two bands
play the national anthem together.
But that didn't happen.
Asst. Athletic Director Tom
Beckett, chair of the 1994 Big
Game Committee, refused to blame
any particular group. "The enthu
siasm in celebration of a victory
brought about the action. I just
think we need to do some things
differently to tiy to protect the
safety of all concerned," he said.
"We couldn't go down [on the
field to playl because it was too
dangerous," said freshman Katie
Beman, a drummer in the Band.
"There was such an incredible mob
of people throwing things at us. A
lot of [band members| were saying
they don't even want to go to
Berkeley next year if the crowd
control is that bad. The rivalry is
just getting completely out of con
trol."
"It was scary," said junior Jeff
Allison, another Band member.
"About 30 people got down on the

field and started ripping down the
goalposts. [Then | more people just
kept coming down. I thought they
were going to come after us. The
cops didn't do anything except pro
tect the other goalposts."
During the halftime show, a few
Cal fans tried to tackle the Tree,
sophomore Charles Good an. The
Band broke formation and went
after the attackers.
"I was frolicking around, and all
of a sudden the crowd started
screaming. One guy touches me
and another pulled me down. I got
in a couple of hits," Goodan said.
"One guy actually got to the
Tree and wrapped him up," Allison
said, "but he paid the price."
Leland commended the Band on
their display of discipline amid the
chaos. "I thought our band [mem
bers] were the real superstars, and
I realize the irony of an athletic
official saying" that, Leland said,
referring to the Stanford Band's
reputation for being rowdy and
often out of control.
He added that it was too early to
determine the extent of damages to
the stadium's field. A report esti
mating the cost of damages will be
filed with Leland today.
