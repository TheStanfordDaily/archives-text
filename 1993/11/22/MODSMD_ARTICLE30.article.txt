# Daily conquers 'Daily' Cal, 12-6

There was Big Game. But first, there was the
game before Big Game.
In what seems to be an inverse relationship with
Big Game victories, The Daily broke a multi-year los
ing streak Saturday, beating the Daily Californian 12-
6 in the annual Ink Bowl, a touch-football game
between the Stanford and Cal student newspapers.
Behind the arm of Brian "Southpaw from Sports"
Egan, The Daily broke a 6-6 tie with 23 seconds left on
a touchdown pass from Egan to Advertising Manager
Brad "I would have run to the parking lot if I had
dropped it" Cleveringa.
The Daily started strong, stopping the Daily Cal's
first possession with an interception. However, The
Daily had trouble offensively: after a touchdown pass
to Elise "Bring It" Wolfgram was called back, The
Daily gave up the ball on downs.
On the next possession, a 40-yard touchdown run
and a thwarted point-afler attempt gave the Daily Cal
a 6-0 lead.
Still behind at halflime, The Daily was inspired by a
speech from Rob "Cornerback turned IM ref' Ross and
a dancing halftime show from Colleen "Kit-Kat"
Krueger.
The Daily came out strong in the second half, scor
ing on a quarterback keeper by Egan. The point-afler
attempt failed.

The Daily continued to play tough defense, behind
the inspiring play of leaders Grace "I buy nice shoes"
Lee and Jim "Special Play" Morris. In addition, The
Daily was helped by the distracting good looks of Tish
"They all want to date me" Williams, Sarah "Fro Yo"
Nagae and Megan "Nice Haircut" Himan.
The Daily Cal was forced to punt afler a couple of
bad snaps, and an American Gladiator-like sack by
Krueger. However, The Daily failed to capitalize on its
next possession, despite strong offense performances
from Ed "Man, am I fast" Yoon, Romesh "Racecar"
Ratnesar and Skip "I have an uncanny resemblance to
Fabio" Schwartz.
After a switch of possessions during which neither
team scored, it was down to the final two minutes.
With tight man-to-man coverage and the fierce pass
rush of Andy "Bob" Dworkin, the Daily Cal was forced
to throw a desperation pass that was intercepted by
Ross.
The next play was the bomb to Cleveringa. The
Daily Cal's last-ditch efforts failed and ensured The
Daily victory.
Nick Perlmuter, editor in chief of the Daily Cal,
which comes out only two days a week, said the loss
was "a small sacrifice for a greater victory |in Big
Game]."
Rajiv "Big Cheese" Chandrasekaran, editor in
chief of The Daily, said, "I thought it would be hard
to field a quality team while working five days a
week, but we're Stanford. Need I say more? Plus,
with such a fine coaching staff, how could we lose?"
