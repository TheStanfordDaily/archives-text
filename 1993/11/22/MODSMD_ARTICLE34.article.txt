### Elissa Lee Staff writer 
Frederic O. Glover, assistant to four Univer
sity presidents and founder of the Stanford
News Service, died Thursday of lung cancer at
age 81.
Glover played a key role in Stanford's trans
formation into a world-renowned institution
under former University President J.E. Wal
lace Sterling during the 1950s and '60s, and
was a central staff member who carried out
Sterling's decisions.
Glover held other positions, including secre
tary to the Board of Trustees and a charter
member of the Stanford Historical Society.
"Fred devoted his whole life to Stanford.
His happiness and unhappiness coincided
with the progress or problems of the Univer
sity," said former University President
Richard Lyman.
In addition, Glover always kept in touch
with many of his Stanford friends, according to
Lyman. "Fred became a one-man communica
tions service. He kept in touch with people who
retired or left and knew their successes and fail-

ures," he said.
After retiring from his
position as secretary to the
University in 1977, Glover
started the historical society's
oral history project, a joint
venture with University
Archives to add to the Univer
sity's historical records
through interviews with
retired faculty members,

administrators and older alumni

During his retirement, he also visited Stan
ford's overseas campuses and sent back articles
to the Stanford"Observer.
Glover, who was born in Washington, D.C.
in 1912, but grew up in Europe, where his
parents enrolled him in boarding schools so
that he could become fluent in other lan
guages.
He first arrived at Stanford as an under
graduate student. He graduated cum laude in
1933 with a degree in economics, then contin
ued his education with post-graduate work at
the University of Hamburg in Germany. How
ever, after selling Esquire magazine an article

about how the government of Adolf Hitler
encouraged the revival of dueling, he was
forced out of the country.
From Germany, Glover traveled the world
and wrote articles about many of the places
he visited for the San Francisco Argonaut.
Glover returned to California to write for the
Redwood Tribune and the Burlingame
Advance.
In 1941, however, he was called to active
duty in the Navy, after spending two years in
the reserves. The Navy, taking advantage of
his proficiency in many languages, assigned
him to work in counterintelligence in San
Francisco.
He was later sent to London and Berlin,
where he served as chief of Naval intelli
gence for Navy forces in Germany. He
attained the rank of commander before
being discharged.
Glover accepted the job of Stanford's first
full-time director of information in November
1946. In 1952, Sterling requested that Glover
work for him as one of his assistants. He left his
job and served Sterling, who later named him
executive assistant.
