# Foreign student enrollment up 27% since '90
## 
### Cindy Yu Staff writer 
The number of foreign students enrolled at
Stanford has increased by 27 percent since
1990, according to statistics compiled by Bech
tel International Center.
Director John Pearson attributed the rise
in foreign students to Stanford's reputation of
academic excellence.
"It has a lot to do with the increasing repu
tation of Stanford around the world. We have
many very rapidly developing countries that
encourage students to go to school overseas,"
he said.
Currently, there are 3,227 non-U.S. citi
zens from 97 different countries registered at
Stanford, which include 677 permanent U.S.
residents and 2,550 students on non-immi
grant visas. Of the students on nonimmi
grant visas, 1,830, or 72 percent are graduate
students.
The School of Engineering has the largest

number of foreign students, with 979. Second
is the School of Humanities and Sciences, with
569, followed by the School of Business, which
has 196 foreign graduate students.
The broad geographic and academic distri
bution, however, is completely random, Pear
son said.
"Stanford has never recruited internation
al students," he said. The increase in foreign
students "is more due to word of mouth and
general knowledge of Stanford, rather than a
planned thing."
As in previous years, the largest number of
students, 1294, came from Asia, and account
for 40 percent of foreign students. Students
from Europe constitute 20 percent (638 stu
dents); from the Americas, 12 percent (398
students); from the Middle East and North
Africa, less than five percent (142 students);
from the Pacific Basin, less than two percent
(48 students); and from Africa, about one per
cent (29 students).
Of the Asian countries, those with the

largest number of students enrolled at Stan
ford are China, with 268 students; Taiwan,
with 223 students; and Japan, with 198 stu
dents.
Pearson said that there are a number of
factors that contribute to the large increase in
foreign students.
"To some small degree, there has been a
rise in students from China and other Asian
countries and also in the number of fee
paying master's students. It's when you
add up all the small factors that you see a
steady growth over the years." Pearson
said.
In addition, while foreign undergraduate
students are admitted through the same pro
cess as all undergraduates, foreign graduate
students are admitted through departmental
admissions committees, overseen by the Grad
uate Admissions Office.
Pearson said the overall trend of increasing
numbers of foreign students is characteristic
throughout the United States.
