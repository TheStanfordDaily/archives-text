## 'Winds of Freedom' critiques curriculum 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
"Winds of Freedom," a new
conservative Stanford group,
roared to life Friday as it hosted
two discussion panels on the
perceived threat that political
correctness and multicultural
ism present to undergraduate
education.
Pointing to the low rate of
annual giving, senior Christo
pher Grey, the project's execu
tive director, opened the confer
ence by calling on Stanford to
"rebuild burnt bridges" and
"re-establish alumni trust" to
improve its financial standing.
About 80 people — mostly
alumni over the age of 50 — at
tended the event at the Stan
ford Park Hotel.
The group was created re
cently to galvanize alumni sup
port for curriculum reform.
To increase alumni support,
Grey said, the University should
refocus its priorities on high aca
demic standards and free dis
course. Though he said that Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper is " moving in the right di

rection" by creating the Com
mission on Undergraduate Edu
cation, Grey added that his
group hopes "to assist the Uni
versity in the process of engaging
alumni" in the process of reform.
"Winds of Freedom is a
mechanism to allow alumni to
feel comfortable with giving
money to the University," he
said. "The group is intended to
be here for the long-term."
Approximately a dozen
Stanford students are involved
with Winds of Freedom, which
is a joint project of the Stan
ford Review and the Intercolle
giate Studies Institute. Grey
said about 1,400 alumni have
expressed interest in the pro
ject.
The first panel discussion,
moderated by Jean Fetter, spe
cial assistant to the president,
focused on qualms conserva
tives have with Stanford's cur
rent education system.
"I think the most urgent
problem ... is the integrity of
undergraduate education," said
