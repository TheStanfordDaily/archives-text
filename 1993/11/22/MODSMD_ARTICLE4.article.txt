## 'Winds of Freedom' critiques curriculum 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
"Winds of Freedom," a new
conservative Stanford group,
roared to life Friday as it hosted
two discussion panels on the
perceived threat that political
correctness and multicultural
ism present to undergraduate
education.
Pointing to the low rate of
annual giving, senior Christo
pher Grey, the project's execu
tive director, opened the confer
ence by calling on Stanford to
"rebuild burnt bridges" and
"re-establish alumni trust" to
improve its financial standing.
About 80 people — mostly
alumni over the age of 50 — at
tended the event at the Stan
ford Park Hotel.
The group was created re
cently to galvanize alumni sup
port for curriculum reform.
To increase alumni support,
Grey said, the University should
refocus its priorities on high aca
demic standards and free dis
course. Though he said that Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper is " moving in the right di

rection" by creating the Com
mission on Undergraduate Edu
cation, Grey added that his
group hopes "to assist the Uni
versity in the process of engaging
alumni" in the process of reform.
"Winds of Freedom is a
mechanism to allow alumni to
feel comfortable with giving
money to the University," he
said. "The group is intended to
be here for the long-term."
Approximately a dozen
Stanford students are involved
with Winds of Freedom, which
is a joint project of the Stan
ford Review and the Intercolle
giate Studies Institute. Grey
said about 1,400 alumni have
expressed interest in the pro
ject.
The first panel discussion,
moderated by Jean Fetter, spe
cial assistant to the president,
focused on qualms conserva
tives have with Stanford's cur
rent education system.
"I think the most urgent
problem ... is the integrity of
undergraduate education," said
Senior Hoover Fellow Martin
Anderson, the author of "Impos
tors in the Temple," which
sharply criticized the establish
ment of higher education.
Political correctness and free
speech "are all important
issues," Anderson added, "but
unless you have high academic
standards, it doesn't matter
what you teach."
Anderson concluded his
remarks by offering several spe
cific recommendations for Stan
ford, including making it more
difficult to drop classes and elim
inating grade inflation.
Claiming that 89 percent of
grades at Stanford are A's or B's,
Anderson said that the current
system "makes a mockery of the
grading process."
Political Science Prof. David
Brady, a member of the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Educa
tion, used his remarks to criti
cize the current advising system
and distribution requirements.
"The [DR system is] essentially
broken in the sense that they've

been added on [continuously!,"
he said.
He also ridiculed Stanford's
lax grading — and drew laughs
and hisses from the audience —
by pointing out that although
the faculty can give failing
grades, F's don't appear on offi
cial transcripts.
Brady added that Stanford
must somehow "combine our
greatness as a research universi
ty with teaching" to take advan
tage of a very capable student
body.
The second panel — com
posed of Grey and two Stanford
alumni — discussed ways the
University community can press
for reform.
"Concern about the quality
of education ... is not confined
to conservatives or any political
party," said alumnus Doug
Bandow, a senior fellow at the
Cato Institute, a conservative
think-tank in Washington, D.C.
"We have to recognize that
we're in for the long haul," he
added, stressing the need to
organize "like-minded groups" to
effectively lobby for changes.
Bandow called Casper "a
breath of fresh air" for his open

ness to all sides of the debate.
The panel then moved toward
more general discussion of Stan
ford's problems.
Alumnus Tim Ferguson, an
editor at the Wall Street Journal,
criticized the proliferation of
ethnic theme houses, which were
just taking hold when he was an
undergraduate in the 19705.
"I have to wonder if. . . multi
culturalism at Stanford has suc
ceeded," Ferguson said, adding
that Stanford still feels com
pelled to "nurture" students of
color, even with a minority popu
lation approaching 50 percent.
Grey said that though the
University has said that it is
"disinclined" to hold students to
its speech code, "the fact that the
speech code is still there means
something."
He stressed the importance of
requiring undergraduates to
take classes on American civi
lization and free-market eco
nomics.
Questions and discussion
among the panel and alumni pre
sent gravitated toward address
ing the most effective way alum
ni should donate money to influ
ence Stanford.

"I wouldn't give money unre
stricted," said Bill Evers, who
graduated in 1970. "It's tough
enough to give a restricted gift"
that does what you want.
Grey agreed, recommending
that alumni not give unre
stricted donations to Stanford
at this time. However, he
warned that Stanford will need
money in some form to be able
to survive.
Bill Sandt, Class of '51, sug
gested that alumni lobby Stan
ford's Board of Trustees to take
action, a comment which
prompted suggestions from oth
ers that they should band togeth
er to nominate their own repre
sentative to the board.
Though some scoffed at the
idea, Anderson said that trustees
have the power to involve them
selves in the curriculum. "Unfor
tunately, [in the past] they have
abrogated that power."
After the conference, Grey
said that his group was pleased
with the turnout. "We were defi
nitely satisfied with the enthusi
asm of the crowd," he said. The
next step for the group is to gen
erate and mail out its first
newsletter this winter, he said.

rent education system.
"I think the most urgent
problem ... is the integrity of
undergraduate education," said
Senior Hoover Fellow Martin
Anderson, the author of "Impos
tors in the Temple," which
sharply criticized the establish
ment of higher education.
Political correctness and free
speech "are all important
issues," Anderson added, "but
unless you have high academic
standards, it doesn't matter
what you teach."
Anderson concluded his
remarks by offering several spe
cific recommendations for Stan
ford, including making it more
difficult to drop classes and elim
inating grade inflation.
Claiming that 89 percent of
grades at Stanford are A's or B's,
Anderson said that the current
system "makes a mockery of the
grading process."
Political Science Prof. David
Brady, a member of the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Educa
tion, used his remarks to criti
cize the current advising system
and distribution requirements.
"The [DR system is] essentially
broken in the sense that they've

been added on [continuously!,"
he said.
He also ridiculed Stanford's
lax grading — and drew laughs
and hisses from the audience —
by pointing out that although
the faculty can give failing
grades, F's don't appear on offi
cial transcripts.
Brady added that Stanford
must somehow "combine our
greatness as a research universi
ty with teaching" to take advan
tage of a very capable student
body.
The second panel — com
posed of Grey and two Stanford
alumni — discussed ways the
University community can press
for reform.
"Concern about the quality
of education ... is not confined
to conservatives or any political
party," said alumnus Doug
Bandow, a senior fellow at the
Cato Institute, a conservative
think-tank in Washington, D.C.
"We have to recognize that
we're in for the long haul," he
added, stressing the need to
organize "like-minded groups" to
effectively lobby for changes.
Bandow called Casper "a
breath of fresh air" for his open

ness to all sides of the debate.
The panel then moved toward
more general discussion of Stan
ford's problems.
Alumnus Tim Ferguson, an
editor at the Wall Street Journal,
criticized the proliferation of
ethnic theme houses, which were
just taking hold when he was an
undergraduate in the 19705.
"I have to wonder if. . . multi
culturalism at Stanford has suc
ceeded," Ferguson said, adding
that Stanford still feels com
pelled to "nurture" students of
color, even with a minority popu
lation approaching 50 percent.
Grey said that though the
University has said that it is
"disinclined" to hold students to
its speech code, "the fact that the
speech code is still there means
something."
He stressed the importance of
requiring undergraduates to
take classes on American civi
lization and free-market eco
nomics.
Questions and discussion
among the panel and alumni pre
sent gravitated toward address
ing the most effective way alum
ni should donate money to influ
ence Stanford.

"I wouldn't give money unre
stricted," said Bill Evers, who
graduated in 1970. "It's tough
enough to give a restricted gift"
that does what you want.
Grey agreed, recommending
that alumni not give unre
stricted donations to Stanford
at this time. However, he
warned that Stanford will need
money in some form to be able
to survive.
Bill Sandt, Class of '51, sug
gested that alumni lobby Stan
ford's Board of Trustees to take
action, a comment which
prompted suggestions from oth
ers that they should band togeth
er to nominate their own repre
sentative to the board.
Though some scoffed at the
idea, Anderson said that trustees
have the power to involve them
selves in the curriculum. "Unfor
tunately, [in the past] they have
abrogated that power."
After the conference, Grey
said that his group was pleased
with the turnout. "We were defi
nitely satisfied with the enthusi
asm of the crowd," he said. The
next step for the group is to gen
erate and mail out its first
newsletter this winter, he said.
"Winds of Freedom," a new
conservative Stanford group,
roared to life Friday as it hosted
two discussion panels on the
perceived threat that political
correctness and multicultural
ism present to undergraduate
education.
Pointing to the low rate of
annual giving, senior Christo
pher Grey, the project's execu
tive director, opened the confer
ence by calling on Stanford to
"rebuild burnt bridges" and
"re-establish alumni trust" to
improve its financial standing.
About 80 people — mostly
alumni over the age of 50 — at
tended the event at the Stan
ford Park Hotel.
The group was created re
cently to galvanize alumni sup
port for curriculum reform.
To increase alumni support,
Grey said, the University should
refocus its priorities on high aca
demic standards and free dis
course. Though he said that Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper is " moving in the right di

rection" by creating the Com
mission on Undergraduate Edu
cation, Grey added that his
group hopes "to assist the Uni
versity in the process of engaging
alumni" in the process of reform.
"Winds of Freedom is a
mechanism to allow alumni to
feel comfortable with giving
money to the University," he
said. "The group is intended to
be here for the long-term."
Approximately a dozen
Stanford students are involved
with Winds of Freedom, which
is a joint project of the Stan
ford Review and the Intercolle
giate Studies Institute. Grey
said about 1,400 alumni have
expressed interest in the pro
ject.
The first panel discussion,
moderated by Jean Fetter, spe
cial assistant to the president,
focused on qualms conserva
