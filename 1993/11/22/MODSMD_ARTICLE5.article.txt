# CUE examines advising system, Res Ed

### Skip Schwartz Senior staff writer 
With just two more meetings left this quar
ter, the Commission on Undergraduate Educa
tion discussed undergraduate advising and
Residential Education on Friday.
The commission decided that advising is an
important topic to study further, while Res Ed
is something that should be deferred in favor of
discussion of new initiatives within the under
graduate curriculum.
James Sheehan, chairman of the commis
sion, said that while there is "a general consen
sus among commission members that we need
to think more about advising," it will be diffi
cult to come to a specific recommendation
about advising since there are different expec
tations of the system.
Sheehan said some of the discussion was

spent examining alterna
tive advising methods at
other schools. For instance,
Sheehan said that while
commission members did
not feel the University of
Chicago's system of using
professionals, rather than
faculty, for general advising
was practical, it still provid
ed "an interesting thought
experiment."

Lorraine Fox, one of the two alumni on the
commission, said she is "enthusiastic about the
re-evaluation of the role and purpose of advis
ing." Fox, Class of' 79, added that while she has
been "very pleased" with the discussions so far,
the commission is far from making any recom
mendations at this point. It has been "opening
up thinking on topics â€” from general to more

specific areas," she said.
Law School Prof. Robert Weisberg said an
other question tossed around during the com
mission meeting was "whether every faculty
member should be required to advise a certain
number of students."
Although this "is on the table as an option,"
Weisberg said some commission members felt
this would be a bad idea. There was some con
sensus that faculty members who do not want
to advise make bad advisers.
Luz Herrera, the undergraduate on the
commission, said the members also looked at
what are considered the three distinct areas of
advising: freshman year, sophomore year and
within a major.
While a lot of the discussion focused on
freshman year, Sheehan said that it is difficult
