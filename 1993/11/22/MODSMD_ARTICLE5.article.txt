# CUE examines advising system, Res Ed
## 
### Skip Schwartz Senior staff writer 
With just two more meetings left this quar
ter, the Commission on Undergraduate Educa
tion discussed undergraduate advising and
Residential Education on Friday.
The commission decided that advising is an
important topic to study further, while Res Ed
is something that should be deferred in favor of
discussion of new initiatives within the under
graduate curriculum.
James Sheehan, chairman of the commis
sion, said that while there is "a general consen
sus among commission members that we need
to think more about advising," it will be diffi
cult to come to a specific recommendation
about advising since there are different expec
tations of the system.
Sheehan said some of the discussion was

spent examining alterna
tive advising methods at
other schools. For instance,
Sheehan said that while
commission members did
not feel the University of
Chicago's system of using
professionals, rather than
faculty, for general advising
was practical, it still provid
ed "an interesting thought
experiment."

Lorraine Fox, one of the two alumni on the
commission, said she is "enthusiastic about the
re-evaluation of the role and purpose of advis
ing." Fox, Class of' 79, added that while she has
been "very pleased" with the discussions so far,
the commission is far from making any recom
mendations at this point. It has been "opening
up thinking on topics â€” from general to more

specific areas," she said.
Law School Prof. Robert Weisberg said an
other question tossed around during the com
mission meeting was "whether every faculty
member should be required to advise a certain
number of students."
Although this "is on the table as an option,"
Weisberg said some commission members felt
this would be a bad idea. There was some con
sensus that faculty members who do not want
to advise make bad advisers.
Luz Herrera, the undergraduate on the
commission, said the members also looked at
what are considered the three distinct areas of
advising: freshman year, sophomore year and
within a major.
While a lot of the discussion focused on
freshman year, Sheehan said that it is difficult


Sheehan
to reach a consensus on the role
of advisers since there are con
flicting expectations about
what they should do, from help
ing select courses to more spe
cific functions. Sheehan added
that commission members all
recognized the important role
advising associates play within
the residences.
Herrera added that members
also discussed the ambiguity of
sophomore year and who stu
dents can turn to for advice.
She said that discussion on
advising within the major
looked especially closely at the
models presented by the Biolo
gy Department and Human
Biology Program and their use
of peer advisers.
Sheehan said Thursday that
he considers undergraduate
advising "the single most diffi
cult issue the commission has
to face. . . . It's clear it's not
working well, but it's not clear
how it will work when it does
work well."
He added that while there
will "most likely" be a subcom
mittee formed to look more
deeply into the area of advising,
the commission is "getting to

the point where our plate is
pretty full and we haven't even
begun to think about new
things."
When classes resumes winter
quarter, Sheehan said he
expects the commission to have
"about a half dozen" subcom
mittees formed and ready to
look into specific areas of
undergraduate education, but
added that more subcommittees
will probably be created as the
process continues.
A subcommittee, however,
will probably not study Resi
dential Education. Sheehan
said that while this topic led to
an interesting discussion, there
was some question as to how
much the commission should be
involved. He added that the
general feeling was that the
commission should "wait and
think about it," especially since
a new director of Res Ed is cur
rently being selected.
According to Herrera, the
commission did talk about the
current function and necessity
of theme houses, as well as
classes that are held in dorms
"and making sure that they are
worth two units."
But, "in the overall priority,"
regarding the commission and
its goal, Fox added, "there are
more important topics than
Residential Education."
