# Med School OKs 15 months clinical training

### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
After hearing arguments and testimony from
students, alumni and administrators, the Med
ical School Faculty Senate voted on Friday to in
crease mandatory clinical training from 12
months to 15 months.
In approving the three-month increase, the
senate defeated a motion to require 18 months of
clinical training.
"It's extremely positive," said second-year
medical student Sarah Roberts. "With NAFTA
and the Brady bill in the same week, it's very up
lifting because it shows that politics can still

work."
While placing the clinical requirement in the
same category with national legislation may be a
stretch, many medical students feared that
changing the requirement to 18 months would
remove any vestige of the Medical School's char
acteristic flexibility.
In a short address to the senate, third-year
medical student .James Chu said the school's
flexibility "is the essence of Stanford Medical
School education. |A change to 18 months of
clinical work) may very well change the spirit of
the school."
Dr VVillard Fee, the senate chair, said flexibil
ity should not he defined strictly by a matter of

months.
"The number of months has nothing to do
with the rigidity," Fee said. "What I hope the
senate will do ... is to have the months divided "
According to Roberts, after all the entreaties
made by members of the Medical School com
munity, the Faculty Senate vote was "quite lop
sided" in favor of requiring 15 months of clinical
training.
Roberts said the vote was approximately two
to-one against the 18-month amendment mo
tion, while the 15-month clinical training was
passed by a much wider margin.
"If they had jumped it to 18
(months), there's a very unclear
effect on the entering student
body," Roberts said. "It would
change the types of students that
come here, and I don't know if
that's what they want."
Roberts was one of several key
people, including Chu, who sought
to mobilize medical students on
the issue. Roberts said that in the
last couple of weeks, she and oth
ers met, distributed fliers, made
phone calls and asked students to
personally lobby professors.
"I think the key was that stu
dents needed to show they cared,"
she said.
Chu, who is vice president of
the Stanford Medical Students
Association, summed up the feel
ings of many in the school that the
15-month requirement would be a
boon to the broad ambitions of
many of the students.
"We cherish the singularity
that lets the students choose what
types of experiences they want.
Please choose to keep the program

uniquely flexible, and please
choose to strengthen the curricu
lum," Chu said, urging the Medical
School faculty to vote for the 15-
month proposal.
The Medical School clinical
requirement became a top concern
to the senate when, last spring, it
was noted that comparable institu
tions' requirements ranged from
14-20 months.
Also forcing the issue was a sur
vey of graduating Stanford medical
students which showed that 40
percent evaluated clinical sciences
information at the Medical School
as "inadequate," the bottom rat
ing. Only 15.8 percent of students
at other schools rated their clinical
training "inadequate."
Finally, students knew that
action on the clinical-training
requirement would be made quick
ly since the Medical School admin
istration already had a keen inter
est in vitalizing the school's clinical
reputation, which is relatively
weak compared to its top-notch
standing in research.
Fee also said medical students
needed the benefit of adequate
time to develop clinical skills.
The date the proposal will take
effect has not been decided yet.
