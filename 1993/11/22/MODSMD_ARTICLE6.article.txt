After hearing arguments and testimony from
students, alumni and administrators, the Med
ical School Faculty Senate voted on Friday to in
crease mandatory clinical training from 12
months to 15 months.
In approving the three-month increase, the
senate defeated a motion to require 18 months of
clinical training.
"It's extremely positive," said second-year
medical student Sarah Roberts. "With NAFTA
and the Brady bill in the same week, it's very up
lifting because it shows that politics can still

work."
While placing the clinical requirement in the
same category with national legislation may be a
stretch, many medical students feared that
changing the requirement to 18 months would
remove any vestige of the Medical School's char
acteristic flexibility.
In a short address to the senate, third-year
medical student .James Chu said the school's
flexibility "is the essence of Stanford Medical
School education. |A change to 18 months of
clinical work) may very well change the spirit of
the school."
Dr VVillard Fee, the senate chair, said flexibil
ity should not he defined strictly by a matter of

months.
"The number of months has nothing to do
with the rigidity," Fee said. "What I hope the
senate will do ... is to have the months divided "
According to Roberts, after all the entreaties
made by members of the Medical School com
munity, the Faculty Senate vote was "quite lop
sided" in favor of requiring 15 months of clinical
training.
Roberts said the vote was approximately two
to-one against the 18-month amendment mo
tion, while the 15-month clinical training was
passed by a much wider margin.
