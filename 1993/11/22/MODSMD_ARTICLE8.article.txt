# Lexis-Nexis now available via Folio

In an effort to increase the research
materials available to students, the
University library system recently
made Lexis-Nexis, one of the most com
prehensive research databases, avail
able to the Stanford community
through the campus computer net
work.
The on-line database, which can now
be accessed campus-wide via Folio, con
sists primarily of full-text articles from
more than 500 newspapers, magazines,
trade publications and wire services as
well as annual reports.
"It's a wonderfully rich set of
resources in support of information.
Basically, we're trying to build up the
databases available to the entire cam
pus . . . to allow students access to more
information," said Karen Nagy, director
of academic information services at
Green Library.
Lexis-Nexis also provides access to
legal material, including court deci
sions, federal and state statutes and law
review articles.
The database was previously avail
able only through the law and business

libraries.
The database offered in the business
library and over the campus network,
however, contains "a dozen or so" fewer
sources than does the law library, said
Kathy Kerns, reference librarian and
head of the librarian instruction pro
gram at Green Library.
"Law students have the full service,"
she explained.
"We just have the educational pro
gram," which is less expensive and is
geared toward more student usage. But,
she said, "Compared to what is there,
what isn't there is minuscule."

In addition, the campus-wide version
of Lexis-Nexis can only be used by nine
students at a time.
If the demand becomes greater, a
queue is established and current users
are limited to 30 minutes, with a warn
ing of this limit.
"We didn't know quite how much of a
load there will be. We had to make a
guess based on (factors like] how many
disciplines will use it and how easy the
interface is to use," Nagy said.
However, she added that the libraries
would "look at it again a few months
(later) and adapt" to the demands.
The frequency at which the infor
mation in Lexis-Nexis is updated
depends on the source of information.
But many of the newspapers and finan
cial sources are updated daily.
Access to Lexis-Nexis is limited to
current Stanford students, faculty, and
librarians for educational use only.
The money used to obtain the
database for campus-wide use came
from the funds allotted for library
resource materials, according to Nagy.
University Libraries also received
the database at a discount because it
applied for the educational, and not the
full-service, program. -
