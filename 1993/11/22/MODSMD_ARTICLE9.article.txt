# Bonnets, hoop skirts and condoms
## 'Stanford Belles' plug safe sex 
### Gina Lee Staff writer 
Amid all the Big Game hoopla, eight
southern belles usually wouldn't attract
much attentiop. Unless they were hand
ing out condoms.
The Stanford Belles for Safer Sex,
dressed in taffeta ball gowns and bon
nets, distributed colorful condoms to
spectators entering the Stanford Stadi
um on Saturday.
"Our purpose is to encourage safer sex
in an age where there has been a huge
increase in sexually-transmitted dis
eases, such as AIDS, chlamydia and gon
orrhea," said Tina Hester, the organizer
of the group.
Hester, a former Planned Parenthood
worker who is on a one-year fellowship at
Stanford, first passed out condoms and
information on safe sex at the 1992 Ken
tucky Derby. Since then, she has organized
campaigns at the Republican National
Convention and plans to attend the San
Francisco Bay to Breakers race in May.

Most of Hester's volunteer recruits
were human biology or feminist studies
majors interested in current health
issues and having a little fun. Neverthe
less, the belles took their work seriously.
"We were very aware of the symbolism
of using the negative stereotype of a pure
and chaste Southern belle seen as a slave
to agrarian society while focusing on an
important issue today," said senior Carla
Winston, an anthropology and feminist
studies major.
Hester, who admits she got off to a
late start for the event, ended up pur
chasing the 1,000 red, blue, gold and
green condoms herself.
Student reaction to the complimenta
ry condoms was mostly positive.
"I thought the girls passing out con
doms were really cute. I couldn't wait to
use them," freshman Daniel Saketkhoo
said.
Unfortunately, many of the condoms
ended up in the stands and on the football
field, only to be picked up the next day by
the clean-up crews.
