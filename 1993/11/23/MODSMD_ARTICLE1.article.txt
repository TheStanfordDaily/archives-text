# Difficult times ahead
## Rice tells staff cuts are a must 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
Using language both ominous
and inspiring, Provost Con
doleezza Rice yesterday told a
gathering of University staff that
Stanford's future capacity for in
novation will depend on the suc

cuts.
Speaking before a standing
room-only audience of Stanford
employees at Fairchild Auditori

University gets its financial

"We should take as our central

emerge [from budget restructur

essence of Stanford — its ability
to create and innovate," she said.

details but for Rice's candid and
sympathetic rhetoric. At times,
Rice sounded as if she were

"I understand people are tired
and weary," she said, late in her
speech. "I know these are tough
times, but you don't know how
strong you are until you go
through adversity. Institutions
that go through adversity have
the right to have faith in their
own resilience."
But the provost also stressed
that the current cuts — which
aim to recover $18 million to $20
million by 1997 through reduc

some academic restructuring —
