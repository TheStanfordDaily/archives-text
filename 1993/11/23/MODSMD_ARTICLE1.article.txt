# Difficult times ahead
## Rice tells staff cuts are a must 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
Using language both ominous
and inspiring, Provost Con
doleezza Rice yesterday told a
gathering of University staff that
Stanford's future capacity for in
novation will depend on the suc
cess of the latest wave of budget
cuts.
Speaking before a standing
room-only audience of Stanford
employees at Fairchild Auditori
um, Rice warned that unless the
University gets its financial
house in order, "we will not be
the Stanford that we are now in
10 years."
"It does not take long to de
cline," she said. "Great universi
ties can get better or get worse."
Rice exhorted the 250-plus
crowd of University manage
ment to "reconnect . . . with the
mission of Stanford, the excel
lence of Stanford, the excitement
of Stanford, so that when you are
asked to do what seems impossi
ble, you keep looking at what you
are trying to support and see it's
all worth it.
"We should take as our central
preoccupation that when we
emerge [from budget restructur
ing] we will have preserved the
essence of Stanford — its ability
to create and innovate," she said.
The provost's 30-minute ad
dress was in many ways a re
markable one, not so much for its
discussion of the current plan's
details but for Rice's candid and
sympathetic rhetoric. At times,
Rice sounded as if she were
stumping for a political cam
paign.
"I understand people are tired
and weary," she said, late in her
speech. "I know these are tough
times, but you don't know how
strong you are until you go
through adversity. Institutions
that go through adversity have
the right to have faith in their
own resilience."
But the provost also stressed
that the current cuts — which
aim to recover $18 million to $20
million by 1997 through reduc
tions in administrative costs and
some academic restructuring —
will not be without tough choices.
"We have to make decisions
about which services we are pre
pared to give up, and which we will
keep," Rice said. Across-the-board
cuts, an oflen-criticized hallmark
of previous budgeting efforts, con
stitute "bad management," she
added.
"It is popular to talk about
shared pain, but that doesn't
make sense when you are budget
ing," she said. "Some (administra
tive) units will take more."
Rice attempted to allay any
fears concerning the potential for
a 30 percent hit to administrative
units based on her budget propos
al, reassuring employees that they
will not be asked "to do the same
things with less money."
She suggested that Byzantine,
cross-unit ventures such as
research administration should be
examined and streamlined.
"There are some processes that
make your eyes spin," she lament
ed.
Rice said cuts in the academic
schools' budgets are logistically
more difficult because of the close
relationship of administrative ser
vices and actual teaching and
research. As a result, she said, aca

demic units will be called upon to
reconsider the very viability of
some programs.
"Stanford can not afford to
have anything that is mediocre,"
she said. "We do not have to toler
ate (mediocrityl. The University's
scarce resources should go to pro
grams that are outstanding."
Rice also called on the audience
to have "the willingness to work
very hard" at changing its process
of doing business, invoking her
personal childhood experiences in
the segregated South, where
blacks needed to "run twice as
hard to get half as far."
"Sometimes," she said, "some
one was willing to run eight times
as hard to get ahead."
At the close of her speech, Rice
encouraged the crowd to recapture
the University's "frontier spirit
.. . so that Stanford in 20 years is
the Stanford we know and love."
After her speech, Rice, along
with Chief Financial Officer Peter
Van Etten and Vice Provost for
Faculty and Staff Affairs Barbara
Butterfield, fielded audience mem
bers' questions, ranging from
inquiries on the role of the Com
mission on Undergraduate Educa
tion to that of multiculturalism
and affirmative action in the bud
get-cutting effort.
Reflecting the grittiness she
intends to bring to the process,
Rice responded to a complaint

about lengthening employee work
weeks with typical frankness.
"1 would hope that after we've
restructured, people will be able to
do things in [fewer hoursl," she
said. "But I can't promise."
Staff members in attendance
praised the provost's approach,
though they maintained the dirty
work still remains to be done.
"There are still a lot of ques
tions in the air," said Carl
Stempin, business manager for
Stanford University Press. "But I
was impressed by Condi — she did
an excellent job of presenting the
issues and explaining them."
Rich Baldwin, an administra
tive services manager in the pro
curement department, said Rice's
"spirit and conviction reminds me
of (former University President
Donald I Kennedy.
"She has a vision that people
can interpret in the way they want
to," he said. However, he suggest
ed that such an effect can be detri
mental to progress, mainly
because it may be difficult to
"align" the differing interpreta
tions of Rice's message.
But Frank Topper, business
practice coordinator in the con
troller's office, said the provost's
ideas resounded with "more clari
ty" than previous ones. "She has
given more people an idea of where
we're going, and what it will take
to get there," he said.

"Stanford can not afford to
have anything that is mediocre,"
she said. "We do not have to toler
ate (mediocrityl. The University's
scarce resources should go to pro
grams that are outstanding."
Rice also called on the audience
to have "the willingness to work
very hard" at changing its process
of doing business, invoking her
personal childhood experiences in
the segregated South, where
blacks needed to "run twice as
hard to get half as far."
"Sometimes," she said, "some
one was willing to run eight times
as hard to get ahead."
At the close of her speech, Rice
encouraged the crowd to recapture
the University's "frontier spirit
.. . so that Stanford in 20 years is
the Stanford we know and love."
After her speech, Rice, along
with Chief Financial Officer Peter
Van Etten and Vice Provost for
Faculty and Staff Affairs Barbara
Butterfield, fielded audience mem
bers' questions, ranging from
inquiries on the role of the Com
mission on Undergraduate Educa
tion to that of multiculturalism
and affirmative action in the bud
get-cutting effort.
Reflecting the grittiness she
intends to bring to the process,
Rice responded to a complaint

about lengthening employee work
weeks with typical frankness.
"1 would hope that after we've
restructured, people will be able to
do things in [fewer hoursl," she
said. "But I can't promise."
Staff members in attendance
praised the provost's approach,
though they maintained the dirty
work still remains to be done.
"There are still a lot of ques
tions in the air," said Carl
Stempin, business manager for
Stanford University Press. "But I
was impressed by Condi — she did
an excellent job of presenting the
issues and explaining them."
Rich Baldwin, an administra
tive services manager in the pro
curement department, said Rice's
"spirit and conviction reminds me
of (former University President
Donald I Kennedy.
"She has a vision that people
can interpret in the way they want
to," he said. However, he suggest
ed that such an effect can be detri
mental to progress, mainly
because it may be difficult to
"align" the differing interpreta
tions of Rice's message.
But Frank Topper, business
practice coordinator in the con
troller's office, said the provost's
ideas resounded with "more clari
ty" than previous ones. "She has
given more people an idea of where
we're going, and what it will take
to get there," he said.
Using language both ominous
and inspiring, Provost Con
doleezza Rice yesterday told a
gathering of University staff that
Stanford's future capacity for in
novation will depend on the suc
cess of the latest wave of budget
cuts.
Speaking before a standing
room-only audience of Stanford
employees at Fairchild Auditori
um, Rice warned that unless the
University gets its financial
house in order, "we will not be
the Stanford that we are now in
10 years."
"It does not take long to de
cline," she said. "Great universi
ties can get better or get worse."
Rice exhorted the 250-plus
crowd of University manage
ment to "reconnect . . . with the
mission of Stanford, the excel
lence of Stanford, the excitement
of Stanford, so that when you are
asked to do what seems impossi
ble, you keep looking at what you
are trying to support and see it's
all worth it.
"We should take as our central
preoccupation that when we
emerge [from budget restructur
ing] we will have preserved the
essence of Stanford — its ability
to create and innovate," she said.
The provost's 30-minute ad
dress was in many ways a re
markable one, not so much for its
discussion of the current plan's
details but for Rice's candid and
sympathetic rhetoric. At times,
Rice sounded as if she were
stumping for a political cam
paign.
"I understand people are tired
and weary," she said, late in her
speech. "I know these are tough
times, but you don't know how
strong you are until you go
through adversity. Institutions
that go through adversity have
the right to have faith in their
own resilience."
But the provost also stressed
that the current cuts — which
aim to recover $18 million to $20
million by 1997 through reduc
tions in administrative costs and
some academic restructuring —
will not be without tough choices.
"We have to make decisions
about which services we are pre
pared to give up, and which we will
keep," Rice said. Across-the-board
cuts, an oflen-criticized hallmark
of previous budgeting efforts, con
stitute "bad management," she
added.
"It is popular to talk about
shared pain, but that doesn't
make sense when you are budget
ing," she said. "Some (administra
tive) units will take more."
Rice attempted to allay any
fears concerning the potential for
a 30 percent hit to administrative
units based on her budget propos
al, reassuring employees that they
will not be asked "to do the same
things with less money."
She suggested that Byzantine,
cross-unit ventures such as
research administration should be
examined and streamlined.
"There are some processes that
make your eyes spin," she lament
ed.
Rice said cuts in the academic
schools' budgets are logistically
more difficult because of the close
relationship of administrative ser
vices and actual teaching and
research. As a result, she said, aca

demic units will be called upon to
reconsider the very viability of
some programs.
"Stanford can not afford to
have anything that is mediocre,"

ate (mediocrityl. The University's

grams that are outstanding."
