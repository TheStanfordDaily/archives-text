Three go free in Biehl trial
('APE TOWN, South Africa (AP) â€”
Jubilant black militants celebrated the
release yesterday of three men charged
in the murder of American student and
Stanford graduate Amy Biehl after a wit
ness refused to testify against the sus
pects.
Biehl, 27, a white Fulbright scholar
from Newport Beach, Calif., was driving
friends home to the black township of
Guguletu on Aug. 25, when a mob of
youths stoned her car. When the car was
forced to stop and Biehl ran for help, she
was stabbed to death.
Prosecutor Nollie Niehaus said he had
to withdraw charges against the three
because witness Charles Benjamin said
he would not testify. Niehaus said Ben
jamin had given a sworn statement link
ing the three freed defendants to the

crime but changed his mind about testi
fying for political reasons.
Sistine Chapel makeover
VATICAN CITY (AP) - The eyes of
angels stared out in wonder, devils
gnashed their teeth and small cherubs
clustered about the capitals of columns.
Restorers pulled back a curtain yester
day to show reporters their progress in
cleaning the last of Michelangelo's fres
coes in the Sistine Chapel.
The 60-by-30-foot fresco is the last
section of Michelangelo's frescoes in the
chapel to be cleaned. The ceiling was
completed in 1990, when work on the
"Judgment" was started.
About 5 percent remains to be done,
and then restorers must doublecheck
their work inch by inch, chief restorer
Gianluigi Colalucci said.
