# Clinton helps end airline strike

### 
FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) - With a
nudge from President Clinton, American
Airlines and striking flight attendants
agreed yesterday to end a 4-day-old walk
out that crippled one of the nation's
largest airlines and inconvenienced thou
sands of Thanksgiving travelers.
Union members agreed to go back to
work immediately, and the airline agreed
not to fire them. American said it hoped
to fly 70 percent of its schedule today and
85 percent tomorrow.
The walkout, which began Thursday,
was costing the airline more than $10
million a day, disrupting travel for thou
sands and threatening to bring chaos to
airports during the upcoming Thanks
giving weekend.

Clinton said at a White House news
conference, "I have spoken with both
parties involved. Both have agreed in
principle to end the strike and return to
the bargaining table immediately."

The president's involvement, while
unusual, comes as Clinton tries to mend
rifts with organized labor over the North
American Free Trade Agreement and as
American chairman Robert L. Crandall
seeks federal help gaining access to more
foreign airports.
"Passengers who hold American Air
line tickets, if they come to the airport
tomorrow, can do so with some confi
dence," Crandall said after Clinton's
announcement. "I have no doubt we'll
get everybody where they're going in
time for Thanksgiving."
The president's announcement came
one day after Crandall said he was
opposed to arbitration, believing it would
cost the airline too much money. Howev
er, Clinton, who called the airline chair
man just after noon yesterday, persuad
ed Crandall to change his mind.
Clinton said the two sides agreed that
the flight attendants would return with

out any loss of jobs. American had
threatened to fire the strikers The union
represents 21,000 American employees.
The union walked out Thursday in a
contract dispute over pay, medical bene
fits, staffing and work rules. The strike
was to extend through Sunday, the end
of the busy holiday travel period.
It was the first walkout by flight
attendants at American and the biggest
against a U.S. airline since 1989.
Many of American's flights have
flown without passengers since the
strike began because they have not had
the federally required number of flight
attendants.
Crandall had rejected the suggestion
by Denise Hedges, president of the flight
attendants' union, that he join her in
asking the National Mediation Board to
recommend that Clinton create a presi
dential emergency board to referee the
dispute.
