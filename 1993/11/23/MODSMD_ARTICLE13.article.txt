CUE should recommend
ways for RFs to support
the improved curriculum

SMALL CLASSES, Faculty
student contact, intellectual
engagement — these are
some fundamental ideals of
undergraduate education, partic
ularly at Stanford.
Unfortunately, as the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education
considers how to achieve these
goals, it has chosen to ignore a
major support structure that
could prove invaluable in imple
menting academic reforms: Resi
dential Education. '
While heavy criticism has been
levied at Res Ed in recent years
for "multicultural indoctrina
tion," few would criticize its
essential conviction: that living
and learning should be integrated,
not separate. Resident fellows can
facilitate this link.
RFs have the ability to serve as
intellectual leaders and educators
to their residents. They can bring
the excitement of scholarship to
students through formal and
informal programming, and they
can facilitate discussion of impor
tant issues.
On a personal level, they can be
mentors and promote faculty-stu
dent interaction, minus the intim
idation.
Some RFs live up to this poten
tial — by teaching or coordinating
classes in their dormitory, holding
special programs in their apart
ment, inviting faculty to speak
and meeting one-on-one with stu
dents. When this is done, students
reflect the RFs' enthusiasm. They
no longer have to be dragged,
kicking and screaming, to pro
grams. Talking about academic
issues becomes important — even
critical — to them.
But when RFs fail to lead,
when they hibernate in their
apartments and venture out only

for free Food Service meals and
the occasional house meeting,
learning falls by the wayside.
Substantive discussions give way
to Tetris fests, the opportunity
for student-faculty interaction
goes unrealized, and residents are
disappointed with the lost chance
for learning outside the class
room.
Because of RFs' unique ability
to implement academic reforms,
the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education should suggest
changes in the RF program that
would allow it to support the
final recommendations for aca
demics.
First, Res Ed should require,
not simply encourage, teaching in
the dorms. Because not all RFs
are faculty members, this require
ment should be flexible — RFs
could, for instance, teach a class,
coordinate a course or hold a
speakers series. Students could be
involved in planning courses, and
they should have the option of
taking such classes for credit.
Second, in order to encourage
resident fellows from a variety of
University departments and make
the program more appealing to
faculty, RFs should be granted a
one-course reduction per year in
exchange for being a resident fel
low. Currently, only untenured
faculty members from the School
of Humanities and Sciences are
granted such an incentive.
Third, education — not parent
ing, politicking or policing —
should remain the top priority of
RFs.
While RFs can and should pro
vide critical counseling for stu
dents, students must take respon
sibility for their actions as advised
in the Fundamental Standard.
The forte of RF is education, not
law enforcement.
Formal teaching, informal
learning and personal support in
residences are integral to educa
tion — particularly a Stanford edu
cation. The commission must rec
ognize that while educational
reform may begin in the class
room, it cannot end there.
