## Tyranny of salamanders 
### 
I AM PISSED. After basking in the
glory of three consecutive Big Game
triumphs, I had a right to a victory
over Cal this weekend. Coach Bill Walsh,
the great teacher, did not teach the
defense how to play.
It is not that Walsh could not teach
the defense. Instead, like the rest of us,
he was too busy worrying about slithery
salamanders. Did you notice that group
of seats in the student section which was
sealed off? Those were for the tiger sala
manders. Between quarters special
escorts would bring the creatures from
their luxury boxes to the seats where
they could get some sun.
These sneaky salamanders have
taken over our University' They
wrecked the annual Big Game Bonfire.
Students could never kill University
investment in South Africa or the
cigarette industry like those calculating
creatures killed one of the school's most
hallowed traditions.
Last winter, the University canceled
plans to construct two undergraduate
residences, including an environmental
ly sensitive "eco-house" on the Knoll,
thanks to our creature companions.
Paradoxically, the environmental
activists on campus seem to think that
environmental studies should be sacri
ficed to serve the interests of one
amphibian. What about all of those rats,
squirrels, foxes and skunks who died
during the construction of every struc

ture on campus? Should we create artifi
cial drought conditions in order to pre
vent the sopping salamanders from flee
ing in the rain?
Early this month it was reported that
the California Tiger Salamander Rescue
and Research Project was organizing
escorts to help the susceptible salaman
ders cross Junipero Serra Boulevard.
Like doctors, the salamander saviors
will be on call at night. Fences will be
assembled to channel the fleeing crea
tures to locations where specialists will
place them into buckets and safely carry
them across the road. Hoy, I'd love to be
carried safely home from Green Library
on a dark, cold night.
Ever since 1 can remember students
have been demanding, to no avail, better
street lighting and more plentiful escort
services around the campus at night. It
seems people would rather escort these
silking serpents than their fellow class
mates.
It is extraordinary how much better
than students the celebrated salaman
ders are treated on campus. There are
hundreds of students graduating each
year without jobs. This subject is
ignored while salamanders grab atten
tion. While more proposals are being
made for expenditures on the costly
creatures, llniversity departments of all
sorts are facing massive budget cuts.
Hey, the Drama Department might be
cut, but at least we'll have salamanders.

Sorry, you will have to do with inade
quate computers in your residence,
we're busy working on salamander solu
tions.
What's next? Of course, the salaman
der theme house. After all, they have a
culture which has long been oppressed
by the more socially beneficial animals
— the cow, the chicken and the pig.
Salamanders should not be assimilated
with other animals.
I am all for preserving endangered
species. However, I am not willing to go
to extremes to invigorate all amphib
ians. It is not hubris to say that certain
human needs come before those of other
animals. In fact, to think any other way
would be counter-intuitive and counter
evolutionary. When it comes to safety,
education and — yes — winning Big
Game, Stanford students must take pri
ority. The University was built for stu
dents, not salamanders.
In retrospect, Walsh neglected the
most beneficial potential use for the
salamanders. Maybe they could have
played effective defense against Cal. We
need a salamander coach with a smaller
salary.

Jeremi is initiating a McCarthyite witch
hunt for all salamander sympathizers.
