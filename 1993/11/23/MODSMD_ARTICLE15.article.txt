## How will choice of benefits package affect future amenities? 
### 
HAVING finally received the ulti
mate handbook of the new Stan
ford benefits plan "Educated
Choices" and having examined it, I
would like to share with the Stanford
community my conclusion that we are
in fact being asked to make highly une
ducated choices: We have no informa
tion whatsoever on how these choices
will affect anyone's standing in the
benefits program in the future. The
purpose of this letter is to ask for a pub
lic clarification of the University's
intentions for the future administra
tion of this benefits plan. The plan
bears all the earmarks of a program for
an insidious curtailment of benefits
masked by highly misleading public
relations verbiage.
Because the benefits program has
been undergoing a steady evolution,
each year's plan has to be examined in
historical perspective. Some of us can
remember when the Stanford benefits
package was simple and clear: The Uni
versity paid fully for its members' med
ical insurance, dental insurance, LTD
insurance for two-thirds of one's
salary, life insurance (originally at the
level of an annual salary, but then in
gradually decreasing amounts) and
made a fixed percentage contribution to

the pension fund. For your family you
paid yourself.
Gradually, this has changed. In the
last year everyone had to contribute
something to medical insurance and
more coverage was offered to family
members. It is arguable that this makes
for a more "fair" distribution of the
University's contribution — but then it
is arguable that the University has no
responsibility whatsoever for the pri
vate family circumstances of its mem
bers. The fact is, however, that the ben
efits to the individual member of the
University (if he has no family) have
been decreased.
The new plan brings new decreases,
even though they are hidden. The elim
ination of the HMO supplement, we are
told, can be compensated fully by the
Triple Choice plan. In fact, if one makes
a detailed comparison, the 1993 supple
ment plan and the Triple Choice plan
are not equivalent and under the 1994
choices HMO subscribers lose all bene
fits of the supplementary plan. This is a
substantial loss of benefits to all who
wish to retain their present coverage,
noting that the Triple Choice plan
allows a much narrower choice of pri
mary physicians, an extremely narrow
choice of pharmacies in the area and

has very nebulous provisions for out of
the area — notably out of the country
— coverage, where there is no HMO
USA.
The implications of the choice dollar
system for further losses of benefits are
not clear, and should be clarified. Will
there be choice dollars in the future
and how will they be determined? The
choice dollar system provides an excel
lent mechanism for reducing benefits
in the future — by simply decreasing
the choice dollar amount in each suc
cessive year, or by tying the number of
choice dollars offered to the benefits
chosen this year.
The current official statement is
that there is no change in the Universi
ty's contribution for the sum of medi
cal, dental and LTD coverage, and for
this year the statement is true. The
University is proposing to cover 90 per
cent of the lowest rate medical insur
ance costs for individuals and 75 per
cent for individuals with one depen
dent. But what consequences will the
choices we make now have on our
future benefits?
To give a concrete example: This
year the University contributes in
choice dollars $37.50 for medical cover
age, $7.50 for dental coverage and (in

my case) $11.55 to account for the dif
ference between the 50 percent salary
LTD insurance which is now becoming
standard and the two-thirds salary
LTD coverage covered by the Universi
ty before.
Now, I can easily envision a scenario
in which if I choose to leave all coverage
as it is, I will receive a comparable
number of choice dollars for each type
of insurance next year, but if I choose
to apply all of the choice dollars to med
ical coverage, I will not, and receive
only the 1995 equivalent of $37.50 on
the grounds that the University will
only continue to cover 90 percent of
individual and 75 percent of small fam
ily medical insurance, and I didn't want
anything else anyway. I can also easily
envision that this will happen anyway
and that next year everyone will be
required to pay for dental and LTD
insurance. Which will it be? All of us
deserve an open, public statement of
the consequences our choices will have
on our future benefits — and if none, it
should be clearly stated that there will
be none.
