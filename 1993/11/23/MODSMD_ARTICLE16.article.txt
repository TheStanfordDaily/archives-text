# Organizer of Coming Out Dag criticizes its coverage
## 
### 
The Daily should get its coverage
straight.
Last Thursday was designated "Con
servative Coming Out Day." The Stanford
Review marked it with a festive celebra
tion in White Plaza, a celebration at which
the student group Queerland conducted a
demonstration. On Friday, The Daily ran
a front-page article on the event; the cov
erage was, if you'll pardon the wordplay, a
little queer, to say the least.

The 12-paragraph article ran two
quotes from homosexual protesters with
in the first four paragraphs, and then it
got around to explaining why conserva
tives were in White Plaza in the first
place. Since the Review had organized
the event in White Plaza, and Queerland
was just reacting to it, it seems logical
that The Daily should have begun its
article with coverage of the conservatives
and then progressed to the reaction of the
homosexual students.
Furthermore, the only picture that
ran with the story was not of the conser
vative organizers but of two lesbians kiss

ing. Perhaps if the Review had sponsored
a bisexual orgy in White Plaza, instead of
a sober discussion, we could have attract
ed the attention of The Daily's wannabe
sensationalistic photographer.
Finally, the title began with "Queer
land ..." and not "The Review ..." or
"Conservatives ..." — this despite the
fact that the presence of homosexual stu
dents was only incidental to the conser
vatives' event — and the jump from page
one read "See GAY, page 2." Now, in an
article on a conservative-sponsored
event, the writer shouldn't have jumped
the gays — again, pardon the verbal frol

ic — hut the conservatives.
A responsible journalist covers first a
newsworthy event, and then explores
reactions to and spins on that event. The
Daily has long been in bed with homosex
ual students, and I understand the desire
to slant coverage of events in favor of
groups The Daily is partisan toward. But
unbiased coverage means that if a group
doesn't initiate the event, they shouldn't
receive the title, the lone picture, and the
jump.
