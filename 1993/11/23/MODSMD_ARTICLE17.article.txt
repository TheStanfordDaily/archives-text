# N'Gai Croal: Notes of non-native son
## Blowing a breeze of freedom — or just breaking wind? 
### 
IT WAS A SCENE straight out of a
Tim Robbins' political satire. But life
doesn't always imitate art — the fic
tional conservative in "Bob Roberts" got
much more support than the live ones
that showed up to hear the Winds of
Freedom blow a tune of academic reform.
What came out instead was the off-key
sound of hot air. An ill wind of rhetoric,
poorly conceived proposals and blustering
bravado. A fearful, angry bitch session
that whined — not roared — to half-life.
Their party line was simple. The '60s
screwed up this country and its educa
tional institutions along with it. The '80s
attack on the traditional curriculum
worsened the problem. But all could be
solved if only we returned to the past. A
time where speech was free, civilization
was Western, and politics weren't correct.
Unfortunately, this past is as real as
"Jurassic Park" and just as dangerous for
those who didn't fit Winds of Freedom's
main demographic: white men over the
age of 50. So the afternoon was a com
plete waste of time as a history and cur

rent events seminar
But it was a valuable lesson in reac
tionary politics masquerading as apoliti
cal and the cover-your-ass mentality of
the administration. .Jean Fetter, special
assistant to President Casper, was billed
as the first panel's moderator. This
turned out to be doublespeak for damage
control; she spent a good deal of time try
ing to reassure alumni that the curricu
lum wasn't that different from when they
were students, that the University still
respected free speech, etc.
Fetter's time would have been better
spent driving a Mack truck through the
holes in their arguments. When I asked
the panelists and other attendees ques
tions about their proposals, our
exchanges went as follows:
The Stanford Review Opinions Editor
Shahid Zaidi complained that political
pressure prompts "ideas of creating
frivolous departments" such as Asian-
American Studies. But just last week, the
Review's editorial urged Asian-Ameri
cans to embrace their "model minority"

status, based on their hard work and
strong values. Shouldn't we then have an
Asian studies program so that we can all
learn from this "model minority"?
Well. . . .
To improve undergraduate education,
you suggest having more professors teach
classes. How many teach classes now?
Are they good teachers? Do you have any
plans to improve their teaching skills?
Actually. . . .
You accuse theme houses of coddling
minority students, even though Stan
ford's minority population approaches 50
percent. Why do we continue to coddle
men at Stanford in housed fraternities
even though Stanford's male population
hovers around 50 percent? And why is it
that a fraternity like Sigma Chi is over 80
percent white, but you don't call that sep
aratist?
Because. . . .
According to your panelists, political
correctness was born in the '60s and
raised to adulthood in the '80s, when its
strict definition describes the dominant

mode of thought. Wasn't it politically cor
rect to own slaves? Wasn't it politically
correct to murder Native Americans to
take their land and to lynch black people?
And wasn't it politically incorrect to be a
communist under McCarthy? Wasn't it
politically incorrect to integrate black
and white military units?
But. .. .
You argue that more rigorous grading
is necessary to give students an incentive
to learn. Aren't the astronomical costs of
a Stanford education enough incentive?
And doesn't it bother you that at an insti
tution of higher education, people need
further incentive to learn?
Hmm. . ..
You claim that CIV gives professors
too much leeway to choose the books for
their CIV tracks. Are these the same pro
fessors that you want more of in the
classroom?
Uh....
And most importantly, if today's lead
ers, who were raised on the pre-1960s
traditional curriculum, have led us to the

many problems of today — violence,
homelessness, chronic unemployment,
pollution, racial tensions — how can
returning to the curriculum that trained
them solve those problems?
Boy, it's getting late — gotta run.
A few questions in the best Socratic
tradition reduced grown men to a series
of pregnant pauses. What's sad is that
their arguments were easily destroyed
without the benefit of facts and figures
that Jean Fetter, President Casper and
other University officials have at their
disposal.
But the administration wasn't inter
ested in exposing Winds of Freedom's
charade. Nor did it want to engage the
attendees in substantial discussion about
Stanford's ever-changing curriculum or
the very real problem of how the univer
sity will adapt to the challenges of the
21st century.
They just wanted the smell to blow
away.
