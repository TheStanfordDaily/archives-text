## Water polo's save-ior leads the Cardinal into NCAAs 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
What does a person do if he likes water
polo but dislikes swimming?
Stanford senior Larry Bercutt f~ced this
situation and found a solution. He olved his
problem by becoming a goalie. Since then,
Bercutt has been a thorn in the side of great
shooters at all levels of play.
"I first saw water polo in P.E. class in
junior high," Bercutt said. "I thought it
looked pretty cool. We had a new coach (cur
rent U.S. National Team coach Rich Corso)

who was intense. I went out for the team
and really loved it."
It didn't take long for Bercutt, who hails
from Beverly Hills, Calif., to find his place in
the pool — between the crossbars, minding
the net.
"I didn't really like to swim," he said. "I
could tread water well, but I just didn't like
to swim. I really liked playing goalie because
I could watch things unfold in front of me. I
like the pressure of playing the goalie posi
tion."
He has felt the pressure on numerous
occasions this season, as the Cardinal has

been involved in 13 games decided by one or
two goals, including seven of its past eight
matches.
"I'd rather just win and not have them be
so close," Bercutt said. "But that's what you
play for, to be in the close games and make
the key block. The close games make them
all worthwhile."
Coach Dante Dettamanti has been
impressed many times by the clutch play of
his four-year starting goaltender.
"Larry has had some tremendous saves,"
Dettamanti said. "He's been our starter
since his first game here at Stanford. When

he's psyched and on top of his game, he's the
best in the country."
Few coaches or players can argue with
that statement, especially this year, as
Bercutt has amassed a career-high 211
saves heading into the final three matches
of his collegiate career. He has reached dou
ble figures in saves 11 times this season,
including a career-best 16 in a 5-4 victory
last week against Pacific.
While Bercutt has had great success in
the pool, he is also an outstanding student.
Last year he was named Block "S" Junior
Athlete of the Year at Stanford as well as to
the All Pacific 10 Conference Academic
First Team.
"He's done so well on the team and aca
demically," Dettamanti said. "He's our sec
ond Rhodes Scholar candidate in the past
three years and he's been nominated for the
NCAA's post-graduate scholarship award."
One of the most tremendous saves of
Bercutt's collegiate career sparked perhaps
the most emotional rally in Stanford history
In last year's NCAA championship
match against rival California, Stanford fell
behind by six goals just two minutes into the
third quarter.
The Cardinal mounted a comeback juid
pulled to within three with about three min
utes remaining in the contest, when Cal's
Dirk Zeien was awarded a penalty shot.
"When the referee blew his whistle and
called the four-meter, people got up to
leave," Dettamanti said. "It would have put
Cal up by four with three minutes left. But
Larry blocked the shot, we went down and
scored and were only down by two."
"Before the game, (Chris) Dorst, a for
mer Stanford goalie who was announcing
the game, came up to me and told me that
Dirk always shoots four-meters to the lower
right," Bercutt said. "I waited until just
before he released the ball and dove to the
lower right. I got two hands on it and con
trolled it."
After the block, even the thwarted shoot
er appreciated the exchange.
"Dirk just sat and smiled at Larry," Car
dinal assistant coach Ben Quittner said
"He acknowledged the good save."

Although the Cardinal eventually fell to
the Golden Bears 12-11 in sudden-death
overtime, Bercutt lists the furious come
back and the penalty shot rejection among
his best memories of his career.
'Iwo years earlier, Bercutt had been in
almost the same situation, playing the the
national championship game as a freshman.
Stanford was defeated by Cal in that game
as well.
Driven by his quest to claim the NCAA
trophy in his final season, Bercutt led the
top-ranked Cardinal to a blistering 15-1
start. The two-time Ail-American was
named Outstanding Flayer at the USC
Tournament in September and Outstand
ing Goalie at the NorCal Tournament.
And after finishing the regular season at
21-6, Bercutt is looking forward to the
NCAAs Liter this week and a final chance to
contend for the elusive title.
When asked what is missing from his
career, Bercutt answers without hesitation,
"It Ls NCAAs. I've gotten all I've wanted
from travelling with the national team. I've
won a high-school championship. To play
here on such great teams and not win an
NCAA championship leaves something
unfulfilled.
"I'm going to semi-retire from water polo
in a week," Bercutt said. "I'm not going to
play for the national team, but I may show
up for spring and summer club tourna
ments. Everything will be lower key."
Both Dettamanti and Quittner know
they don't need to give their goaltender
extra incentive at the NCAA champi
onships.
"He's been a leader mid our defensive
captain," Quittner said. "He's known for
being at his best at NCAAs. All he's missing
is the championship ring."
"The NCAAs are a big pressure cooker,"
Bercutt said. "It's intense but it's a lot of
fun. The whole season comes down to three
days. I'm not going in with the attitude that
I'm going to let down."
Larry Bercutt has been there before. The
pressure. The intensity. The competition.
What else could he want?
The ring.
