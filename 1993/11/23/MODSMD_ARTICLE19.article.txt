# Cross country takes 11th spot in NCAAs
## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
For the first time since 1984,
the eighth-ranked Stanford
women's cross country team
competed in the NCAA Champi
onships at Lehigh University in
Pennsylvania yesterday, placing
11th out of 22 schools participat
ing.
Consistent team running
secured the NCAA berth for the
Cardinal. Stanford captured the
Pacific 10 Conference crown
three weeks ago by having its top
five runners finish within 12 sec
onds of one another. And, earlier
in the year, at the Stanford Invi
tational — the largest meet in
the western United States — the
Cardinal came in second to
fourth-ranked Brigham Young
because a mere 26 seconds sepa
rated Stanford runners.
However, yesterday in Penn
sylvania Stanford's top five run
ners completed the race a full 50
seconds apart. As a result, the
Cardinal placed 11th, just one
position shy of their top-10 goal.
Stanford finished with 286
points, 19 short of lOth-place
Brigham Young.
Although the NCAA Champi
onships' 22 competitors were all
ranked among the nation's top
25, the meet was essentially a

dual meet between No. 1
Arkansas and No. 2 Villanova.
For the second year in a row, Vil
lanova edged the Razorbacks for
the national title, 66-71. The
rest of the field followed well
behind, with Georgetown com
ing in third with 199 points.
"I thought we performed
well, but it could have been bet
ter," said head coach Vin Lanan
na. "This was a race where all
184 runners are good. A lack of
NCAA Championship experi
ence was the biggest drawback."
Indeed, Stanford had shown
all season long that it possessed
the talent to beat top-10 teams
such as Oregon, which placed
eighth at NCAAs. The Cardinal
ran over the Ducks on its way to
the Pac-10 crown and on its way
to a second-place finish at the
District-8 regional champi
onships. However, Oregon re
turned almost its entire NCAA
squad from last year, while the
only runner for Stanford with
NCAA experience was senior
Louise Watson.
Watson qualified for the
national meet last year as an
individual by winning the Dis
trict-8 individual title. She
showed her experience yester
day, finishing 27th among the
