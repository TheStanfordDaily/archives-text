# Cross country takes 11th spot in NCAAs
## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
For the first time since 1984,
the eighth-ranked Stanford
women's cross country team
competed in the NCAA Champi
onships at Lehigh University in
Pennsylvania yesterday, placing
11th out of 22 schools participat
ing.
Consistent team running
secured the NCAA berth for the
Cardinal. Stanford captured the
Pacific 10 Conference crown
three weeks ago by having its top
five runners finish within 12 sec
onds of one another. And, earlier
in the year, at the Stanford Invi
tational — the largest meet in
the western United States — the
Cardinal came in second to
fourth-ranked Brigham Young
because a mere 26 seconds sepa
rated Stanford runners.
However, yesterday in Penn
sylvania Stanford's top five run
ners completed the race a full 50
seconds apart. As a result, the
Cardinal placed 11th, just one
position shy of their top-10 goal.
Stanford finished with 286
points, 19 short of lOth-place
Brigham Young.
Although the NCAA Champi
onships' 22 competitors were all
ranked among the nation's top
25, the meet was essentially a

dual meet between No. 1
Arkansas and No. 2 Villanova.
For the second year in a row, Vil
lanova edged the Razorbacks for
the national title, 66-71. The
rest of the field followed well
behind, with Georgetown com
ing in third with 199 points.
"I thought we performed
well, but it could have been bet
ter," said head coach Vin Lanan
na. "This was a race where all
184 runners are good. A lack of
NCAA Championship experi
ence was the biggest drawback."
Indeed, Stanford had shown
all season long that it possessed
the talent to beat top-10 teams
such as Oregon, which placed
eighth at NCAAs. The Cardinal
ran over the Ducks on its way to
the Pac-10 crown and on its way
to a second-place finish at the
District-8 regional champi
onships. However, Oregon re
turned almost its entire NCAA
squad from last year, while the
only runner for Stanford with
NCAA experience was senior
Louise Watson.
Watson qualified for the
national meet last year as an
individual by winning the Dis
trict-8 individual title. She
showed her experience yester
day, finishing 27th among the
country's best with a time of 17
minutes and 14.4 seconds. Howev
er, her teammates ran well behind.
The Cardinal's second-best perfor
mance came from senior captain
Sarah Truitt, who placed 62nd
with a time of 17:39. Other Cardi
nal runners finshed in 89th, 99th,
102 nd, 114 th and 145 th places.
Despite falling short of its goal
to finish in the top-10, the Cardinal
has nonetheless met all the objec
tives it set for itself in the begin
ning of the season.

The women wanted to challenge
traditional frontrunner Oregon for
the Pac-10 championship and
ended up winning the title.
They hoped to place at least
second at the district meet to qual
ify for NCAAs, and they did just
that. Merely getting to the nation
al championship was Stanford's
goal, and the meet itself was just
the celebration of a season's hard
work.
"To go from fourth place at Pac
10's last year to the league title this
year and a trip to the NCAAs has
established Stanford as a legiti
mate power on the NCAA level,"
Lananna said. "I think the women
did a great job this year."
