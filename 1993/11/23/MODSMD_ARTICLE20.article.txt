## Are there alternatives to penalty kicks in deciding soccer matches? 
### 
There's got to be a better way than this. The
Cardinal, umesi's -
two games all year, a fluke early-season
defeat at the hands of Washington State and a
hotly-contested match against perennial power
house North Carolina. They end the year with a
school-record 18 wins and an undisputed No. 2
national ranking, a notch below those same Tar
Heels.
They face an overmatched, lower-ranked club
from George Mason in the NCAA semifinals,
outshooting the Patriots 11-7 in regulation play
and 8-2 in 60 minutes of overtime.
Their season is ended by three penalty-kick
saves made by a goalkeeper whose legal name is
"Skye."
Is a victory via penalty kicks really a victory?
Even the official NCAA record books aren't sure
— the Stanford loss is recorded as a 1-1 tie fol
lowed by an asterisk. Fine print at the bottom of
the page is the only indicator that George Mason
won the game 3-1 on penalty kicks.
Deciding tie games by penalty kicks is an
American innovation, a phenomenon invented
by the North American Soccer League in 1974.
This rule change not highly valued in the
international soccer community. Outlawed by
every official international soccer organization,
the NASL was reduced to infidel status, fading
out of existence less than two decades after its
inception.
The penalty kick idea doesn't make much
sense. Can you imagine a basketball game being
decided by a foul-shooting exhibition? Or ending

a football game with a field-goal kicking contest?
J&eart begins palpitating at the thought of
such atrocities.
NCAA soccer officials argue that without

some sort of an illogical, unsatisfying ending,
playoff soccer games could continue ad infini
tum. But penalty kicks aren't the only possible
tie-game resolvers, as a quick trip through soccer
history will demonstrate. ...
The shoot-out. In response to tremendous
dissatisfaction with its tiebreaking methods, the
NASL changed its penalty-kick formula to one
involving shootouts in 1977. In shootouts, a
player goes one-on-one with the opposing teams'
goaltender. S/he has five seconds to score. Move
ment is permitted by both goaler and goalie.
So where's the big innovation here? Using the
penalty kick method, players are given unob
structed, undefended shots at the net. But with
the new-and-improved shootout system ... play
ers are given unobstructed, undefended shots at
a net. Some change.

Less-is-better. Some American amateur
organizations reduce the number of players on
the field from 11 to eight in overtime periods to
facilitate scoring.
But why stop there? Reduce the game to a
four-person match. Or cut the distance of the
field in half, and limit each side to two players.
You could make it one-on-one — what could be a
better scoring facilitator? But one-on-one
smacks hauntingly of a shootout. We need a
more radical change than this.
The $ factor, go back earlier in the
annals of soccer history. In 1871, Queen's Park
and the Wanderers squared off in the semifinals
of the Challenge Cup, a competition which
crowned the amateur soccer kings of the British
Isles. The two squads battled to a tie. But
Queen's Park, facing a budget crisis with
thoughts of additional expenses from additional
play, conceded victory to the Wanderers.
In one sense, this system is as equitable as
any. The line between the haves and the have
nots must be drawn somewhere. With 31 inter
collegiate varsity sports, Stanford is a have.
George Mason ain't even field a football team.
Advantage: Stanford.
The Darwinian factor. But a victory by
economics is as unsatisfying as a victory by
penalty kicks. To win at any sport necessarily
involves a degree of physical exertion absent
from both formats.
So we take one final step back, a trip to the


Brian
Egan
Middle Ages. Before the invention
of tht printing press, soccer was
played by the masses ... in a sense.
"Its only resemblance to the mod
ern game was that a large ball was
used," wrote George Keeton in The
Football Revolution.
Keeton described the old-style
game as an attempt of men of duel
ing villages to with the goal of tak
ing the ball to the other town. But
he added an footnote to this concep
tion. "When this was achieved, the
game ended," he wrote. "But by that
time the list of casualties was high
and some of them were even fatal."
Maybe there aren't any better
ways to decide a tie in soccer. But
penalty kicks are not the solution.
What do we do in the meantime?

"Its only resemblance to the mod

used," wrote George Keeton in The
Football Revolution.
Keeton described the old-style
game as an attempt of men of duel

he added an footnote to this concep
tion. "When this was achieved, the
game ended," he wrote. "But by that
time the list of casualties was high
and some of them were even fatal."
Maybe there aren't any better
ways to decide a tie in soccer. But
penalty kicks are not the solution.

Stanford 1, George Mason 1.
There's got to be a better way than this. The
Cardinal, umesi's -
two games all year, a fluke early-season
defeat at the hands of Washington State and a
hotly-contested match against perennial power
house North Carolina. They end the year with a
school-record 18 wins and an undisputed No. 2
national ranking, a notch below those same Tar
Heels.
They face an overmatched, lower-ranked club
from George Mason in the NCAA semifinals,
outshooting the Patriots 11-7 in regulation play
and 8-2 in 60 minutes of overtime.
Their season is ended by three penalty-kick
saves made by a goalkeeper whose legal name is
"Skye."
Is a victory via penalty kicks really a victory?
Even the official NCAA record books aren't sure
— the Stanford loss is recorded as a 1-1 tie fol
lowed by an asterisk. Fine print at the bottom of
the page is the only indicator that George Mason
won the game 3-1 on penalty kicks.
Deciding tie games by penalty kicks is an
American innovation, a phenomenon invented
by the North American Soccer League in 1974.
This rule change not highly valued in the
international soccer community. Outlawed by
every official international soccer organization,
the NASL was reduced to infidel status, fading
out of existence less than two decades after its
inception.
The penalty kick idea doesn't make much
sense. Can you imagine a basketball game being
decided by a foul-shooting exhibition? Or ending

a football game with a field-goal kicking contest?
J&eart begins palpitating at the thought of
such atrocities.
NCAA soccer officials argue that without

some sort of an illogical, unsatisfying ending,
playoff soccer games could continue ad infini
tum. But penalty kicks aren't the only possible
tie-game resolvers, as a quick trip through soccer
history will demonstrate. ...
The shoot-out. In response to tremendous
dissatisfaction with its tiebreaking methods, the
NASL changed its penalty-kick formula to one
involving shootouts in 1977. In shootouts, a
player goes one-on-one with the opposing teams'
goaltender. S/he has five seconds to score. Move
ment is permitted by both goaler and goalie.
So where's the big innovation here? Using the
penalty kick method, players are given unob
structed, undefended shots at the net. But with
the new-and-improved shootout system ... play
ers are given unobstructed, undefended shots at
a net. Some change.

Less-is-better. Some American amateur
organizations reduce the number of players on
the field from 11 to eight in overtime periods to
facilitate scoring.
But why stop there? Reduce the game to a
four-person match. Or cut the distance of the
field in half, and limit each side to two players.
You could make it one-on-one — what could be a
better scoring facilitator? But one-on-one
smacks hauntingly of a shootout. We need a
more radical change than this.
The $ factor, go back earlier in the
annals of soccer history. In 1871, Queen's Park
and the Wanderers squared off in the semifinals
of the Challenge Cup, a competition which
crowned the amateur soccer kings of the British
Isles. The two squads battled to a tie. But
Queen's Park, facing a budget crisis with
thoughts of additional expenses from additional
play, conceded victory to the Wanderers.
In one sense, this system is as equitable as
any. The line between the haves and the have
nots must be drawn somewhere. With 31 inter
collegiate varsity sports, Stanford is a have.
