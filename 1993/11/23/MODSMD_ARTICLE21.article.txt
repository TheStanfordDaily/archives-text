# Athletes of the Week

### 
Athletes of the Week — By and large, it
was a dark, dark week for Stanford athletics.
Due to the setbacks encountered by the foot
ball, volleyball and water polo teams, The
Daily has been forced to look elsewhere for
this week's heroes and heroines. But the
search for those men and women who repre
sent all that is noble at Stanford soon met with
success.
Though the Axe was consigned to a Berke

ley dungeon as a result of Saturday's disaster,
two groups of valiant warriors emerged from
the smoke, the destruction, the mace, to claim
their roles as The Daily's Athletes of the
Week. These groups are the Stanford Police
and the Stanford Band, both of whom were
able to place California fans in their proper
position — prone.

When Cal fans attempted to defoliate the
Tree for a second consecutive year, the Band
knew that it was time to stop the madness.
Breaking formation, the Band administered a
majority of the solid hits given to California
over the course of the afternoon.
After a few Berkeley hooligans, displaying a
typical amount of originality, rushed the field
during the Band's halflime show and tackled
the Tree, Band members demonstrated that
even the hallucinatory fervor of the interlop
ers was not enough to snap their resolve.
Approximately half the Band, including
almost all of the trumpet section, taught the
trespassers a much-needed lesson. And, in the
spirit of personal sacrifice, the Band was
unable to perform their last formation because
of their public-service activity.

But, after the game was over, hundreds of
Cal fans ignored the fate of their earlier
cronies and felt that they needed to add insult
to injury and ravage the sacred Elysian field
that is Stanford Stadium. The only group

standing in their way was the plucky hand of
public servant* known as the Stanford Police.
Although the C-ul fanatics were able to tear
down the south goalpost, a circle of police offi
cers formed a Magi not line around the north
post and prevented its demolition. Further
more, although the police were hamstrung by
their need to avoid further tensions and possi
ble juries, their orderly dismantling of the
Berserkeley not surely made Leland proud
