# Crew avenges football defeat, tops California
## 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
Maybe we lost to them in throw
ing around a pigskin, but we sure
were not about to lose to them in
pulling the oars.
The Cardinal men's crew team
defeated California while placing
second in the Stanford Fall Regat
ta, this fall season's final race, held
Sunday in San Mateo.
The first men's boat came in at
17 minutes, 30 seconds, four sec--
onds ahead of Cal's first boat in the
6,000-meter head race, a style of
competition in which boats start in
15-second intervals.
The University of Victoria came
in first place with a time of 16:58,
followed by Stanford and then Cal.
Stanford's second men's boat
also performed well, coming in
fifth place in the same head race,
behind UC-Irvine.
In only their second race of the
season, the women's first boat
rowed markedly better than last

week, closing the gap on Cal, which
has been racing for most of the sea
son, from 33 seconds to 46 seconds.
The women came in third with a
time of 20:52, behind Victoria's
19:13 finish and Cal's 20:19 mark .
With the final race of the fall
complete, the entire crew team will
begin a long winter's season of
training in preparation for spring.
In Sunday's climactic meet, the
men's race started off smoothly,
with Stanford in the starting slot,
Cal in second place and Victoria
rowing third.
Unfortunately, the men's first
boat was among the few boats that
were slowed down by traffic from
an earlier race that had not yet fin
ished, a result of poor race plan
ning, according to men's head
coach Wieslaw Kujda.
By the time the boats ahead of
Stanford made room for the men's
race, the Cardinal had lost eight
seconds, and the other teams had
closed the gap between Stanford.
Nonetheless, the men's first
boat stayed ahead and managed to
beat Cal.
The second boat's progress was
also temporarily halted because of
the traffic from the race ahead of it.
"The second boat was going for
fourth place by the 3-mile marker,
but with 1,000 meters to go, it hit
a whaler boat and had to stop for
45 seconds," Kujda said.
The time lost would have
allowed the second boat to beat
Irvine, but Kujda is content in
believing its oarsmen have become
competition for the Cal first boat
whether or not they had not lost
time to the traffic jam.
In addition to the first and sec
ond boats, the crew team also
brought in a number of freshman

boats for the first time this year.
In the freshman race, Stan
ford's first boat came in second at
20:44, losing to Cal's first boat by a
narrow three seconds.
"Our freshmen extreme
ly well," said Kujda. noting that
Cardinal freshmen have been row
ing for a mere six weeks while Cal
has been on the water for six fort
nights.
He was also quick to point out
that Cal recruits high-school oars
men in large numbers, whereas
Stanford mostly trains its novices
from scratch.
"We're putting our freshman,
along with experienced rowers,
through hell to make sure they
make it in the spring (season),"
Kudja said.
And indeed, Kujda believes the
entire crew team is being worked
harder than ever this year to pre
pare for spring, which is when the
Pacific 10 Conference champions
will be determined.
