# Men's hoops tops Illawara
## Knight in shining armor leads Cardinal, 101-90 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
In the first exhibition game, freshman point
guard Brevin Knight showed he could pass. Last
night he proved he can shoot, too.
Scoring 18 points on eight of 10 shooting,
Knight led the Stanford men's basketball team
to a 101-90 win over the Illawara Hawks in the
Cardinal's final exhibition game in Maples Pavil
ion.
The game was not as close as the 11-point
margin of victory suggests. After being down by

as many as 36 points in the second half, the
Hawks outscored the Cardinal reserves 37-10 in
the final 9:08 to make the final score appear to
be less of a rout.
But in the first eight minutes of the second
half, Knight simply took over, scoring 14 points
— including two of two from the three-point
line — to allow the Cardinal to put the Hawks
away after leading by only 10 points at half
time.
"Brevin had his guy backed off and on his
heels because of his quickness, and he had room
to shoot," said head coach Mike Montgomery.
"He's not a bad shooter. He's not a pure shoot
er, but he's a good shooter."
Knight also led the team with three steals and
five assists, while committing only one turnover.
The Cardinal shot an impressive 57.4 percent
from the field overall, and 11 of the 12 players
got into the scoring column.
Other leading Stanford scorers were Brent
Williams and Dion Cross — both of whom had
15 points — and Andy Poppink with 13 points.
Melvin Thomas led the Hawks with a game-high
20 points on six of eight shooting and eight of 11
from the free throw line.
Rebounding from his lackluster performance
in last Wednesday's exhibition was forward
Darren Allaway, who scored 11 points on five of
five shooting and one of two free throws.
The lack of any big men in the two exhibi
tions has hurt the performances of the Cardi
nal big men, Montgomery said, because there is
no one for players such as 6-foot-11-inch center
Jim Morgan and Allaway and match up against.
Montgomery said he was pleased with the
improvements the Cardinal has made in its first
three weeks of practice, saying he believes the
team is almost prepared for its regular-season
opener Friday night against Cal State-North
ridge.
"We've got a number of people who have
shown they can play," Montgomery said. "We've
made progress, but we got a lot of things still left
to do. We're close to being getting ready to play
for real."
Montgomery said his main concern remains
the team's transition defense, as the Hawks were
often able to run down the floor and find an open
shot. "We're having a hard time locating people
in transition," he said.
After trying a number of lineups in the first
30 minutes of the contest, Montgomery let the
reserves play the final portion of the game, and
he attributed the Hawks' late resurgence to that
fact.
"We had a combination of guys who haven't
played a lot of minutes, and they needed the oppor
tunity," Montgomery said. "This was not necessar
ily a combination I would want to have during a
regular game, but we have to be developing depth.
"We need to have each of them individually
able to come in and play, because individually
they are all capable of helping us. They needed
the confidence," he said.
