# Roping them in
## Wrestling corrals Aggies

In wrestling, winning isn't
everything. It's how big the win
is that's important.
At their first dual meet last
Friday at UC-Davis, the Cardi
nal wrestlers allowed big wins
and narrow losses in their indi
vidual matches to propel them
to victory. Although just five of
the ten starters won their
matches, all contributed critical
team points toward the 22-15
win.
"All ten earned real points,
such as takedowns and rever
sals, which are points the oppo
nent never wants to give up,"
said head coach Chris Horpel.
The Cardinal's solid nucleus
of Matt Cano (126 lbs.), Jay
Jackson (134), Jimmy Aguirre
(142), Lance Johnson (150) and
Scott Chapman (158) defeated
their match opponents. Both
Aguirre and Johnson won by a
fall, each giving the team six
points. Because Aguirre is not
normally a pinner, it was his

first pin as a college wrestler.
"It was important to me
because it helped the team,"
said Aguirre. "I was glad to give
the team those extra points."
Cano's victory was less deci
sive but a pure demonstration of
perseverance. At the end of the
first period, he was behind 7-1.
After the referee missed a near
fall, Cano came back with a 5-
point headlock hip throw at the
end of the match for the win.
"(Canol kept his cool and
chipped away for that victory,"
Horpel said.
Horpel was also impressed by
the younger athletes. Freshman
Chapman, wrestling in his first
college meet, won his match by a
major decision, 20-7.
"He took his opponent apart
one step at a time. He had a very
smart match," Horpel said.
The 167- and 177-pound divi
sions were vital in the overall
outcome. Although freshman
Ryan Barnes (167) and sopho
more Mark Ryzewicz (177) did
not come away with a win in

their matches, they did not suc
cumb to a pin, technical fall or
major decision, which could
have sacrificed the team victory.
"Basically, we have three
158-pounders spread out to fill
167 and 177 pounds. Even
though they were outsized, they
wrestled with a lot of character,
and consequently they won us
the meet," Horpel said.
In another impressive debut,
freshman Bryan Vaniman lost
narrowly 7-5 to one of the
Aggies' most talented athletes,
Pat Maguire, in the 198 lbs.
weight class.
Co-captain Jackson said the
meet showed a lot of promise for
the coming season. "This is a
real cohesive group with a lot of
heart. Although the [match]
scores show some losses, we all
wrestled very well."
Over Thanksgiving weekend,
the Cardinal takes to the road to
face Oregon State and Oregon.
Oregon State, a potential top
five team, will likely give the
Cardinal stiff competition.
