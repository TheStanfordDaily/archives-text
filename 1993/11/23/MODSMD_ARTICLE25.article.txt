# Fencing flattens California
## 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
The Stanford fencing team showed they will be a
team to be reckoned with this year, as they romped
over a meek contingent from California last Friday at
Roble Gymnasium.
"We just tooled 'em," said Cardinal fencer Errol
Hunter, who led the epee squad with a 3-0 bout
record.
Stanford men and women combined to win 34 out
of 43 bouts, including a 16-0 showing by the women's
team.
The women were led by team captain Anna Cum
mins, who went 4-0 and remarkably allowed just one
touch against her. Also going undefeated were
Michelle Butler, Bethanie Deyine and Mika
Tsugiyana.
In men's epee and saber, undefeated fencers
included Adrian Klein, Douglas Vanderbilt and Shil
Sengupta.
The team's victory could have been even more
numerically impressive if not for extenuating circum
stances.
The women's foil squad was forced to send three
representatives into men's foil bouts and will do so for
the remainder of the year. Facing obvious size differ
ences (but not so obvious ability differences), the

Stanford "men's" foil squad went 3-6, with Morgan
Hoch, Chloe Sladden and Stephanie Wien securing
one victory apiece over their male opponents. Stan
ford women's head coach Sherry Posthumus was
credited by players for prudently distributing the
women between the men's and women's foil squads.
This curious situation resulted from the breakup
of last year's fifth-ranked men's foil team. Olympian
and back-to-back NCAA champion Nick Braven was
lost to graduation. Team captain Geoff Donaker will
be studying in Berlin for the last two quarters of the
year. And although Stanford head coach Zoran
Tulum successfully recruited one of the nation's top
young fencers, Sean McClain, the Olympic hopeful
opted to defer for a year so that he could train in Ger
many.
This left Hunter as the only returning fencer on
the foil squad. Not wishing to waste Hunter's abilities
on a thinned-out foil squad, Tulum has opted to have
Hunter make the switch to the epee squad and take
his chances with the women handling the men's foil
category.
The current scenario could cost the Cardinal some
match victories against tougher opponents than Cal.
"It's going to make it real tough. Overall, we may
end up losing a few matches," said Posthumus.
But the significance of match
defeats are minimal in the context
of how a team qualifies for the
NCAA championships in March.
"Your individual weapons
squads qualify separately," Post
humus said.
On the men's side, Hunter said
that they "have a decent shot at
NCAAs," but that this is really a
rebuilding year involving "prepa
ration for doing damage next
year."
According to Cummins, the
women's team "has a good shot at
doing well. Our strongest charac
teristic is our camaraderie."
The Stanford fencing team fin
ished last season ranked No. 11 in
the country in the combined
men's and women's standings.
