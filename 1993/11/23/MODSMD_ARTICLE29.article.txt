# How the poll was conducted
## 
### 
This Stanford Daily poll was
based on telephone interviews
with 320 registered Stanford
undergraduates.
Respondents were chosen at
random from The Stanford
Directory. The poll was con
ducted by paid interviewers
between the hours of 6 p.m.
and 10 p.m. on Nov. 15, Nov.
17 and Nov. 18.
The two multiple-choice
questions specifically about the
Commission on Undergraduate
Education and a question on
the importance of re-evaluating
undergraduate education were
answered by 320 students,
freshmen through seniors.
That means these questions
have a margin of error of 5.7
percent at a 95 percent level of
confidence. In other words, in
19 cases out of 20, the results of
this sample will differ by no
more than 5.7 percentage
points in either direction from
the answers that would have
been obtained by polling all reg
istered Stanford undergradu
ates.
Most of the rest of the ques
tions were posed to 248 sopho
mores, juniors and seniors, giv
ing these questions a 6.2 per
cent margin of error at a 95
percent level of confidence.
The question about teaching

quality was asked only on
Wednesday and Thursday
nights, so the respondent pool
was smaller — 147 upperclass
men answered that question.
The margin of error for the
question is 9.8 percent at a 95
percent level of confidence.
A difference between two
results is statistically signifi
cant only if it is greater than
twice the margin of error. In
other words, if 54 percent of
respondents answered "yes" on
a given question and 46 percent
answered "no," the difference
is not statistically significant.
This is because, with a 5 per
cent margin of error, the "yes"
answer could be as low as 49
percent in the overall popula
tion and the "no" answer as
high as 51 percent.
One of the questions posed
to the upperclassmen was
open-ended — respondents
were asked to name the three
areas of undergraduate educa
tion they feel are most impor
tant for the commission to
study. The percentages pre
sented with this question rep
resent the percent of the 248
students who named the area
as one of their choices. Because
students could name several
areas, the percentages do not
add up to 100 percent.
