# New ASSU bills address Pub Board inefficiencies
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
In response to complaints of inefficiency
and unresponsiveness to student needs, the
Publications Board introduced two bills
last week to the ASSU Senate which would
grant it more autonomy.
The legislation would place some of the
power to regulate the board, traditionally
held by the senate, in the hands of the pub
lications editors themselves.
"Essentially what the (first) bill does is
take all the ASSU Bylaws that are relevant
to the Pub Board and remove them," said
sophomore Steve Russell, chair of the
board.
"It basically says that the current ASSU
Bylaws will be transferred into another
document called the 'Policies of the Pub
Board,' " he added.
If enacted by the senate, the bill would
streamline the board's internal processes
and help eliminate some of the inefficien

cies which currently exist.
"This changes the month-long process
to one in which the Pub Board would actu
ally act to control its daily operation," Rus
sell said. The board's decisions would only
require a collective approval at a single sen
ate meeting.
Under the present system, the board
must submit each of its decisions to the sen
ate, a process which has caused the ASSU's
bureaucracy to take its toll on the success of
campus publications.
"The senate is very inefficient in re
sponding to the Pub Board requests," ad
mitted graduate senator Neil Crellin.
"There's no reason why the ASSU should
interfere in its business."
Because of the large number of service
and business projects under the senate's
auspices, Crellin said it is often beneficial to
grant some degree of autonomy.
Indeed, Russell said the bill "might be a


tie results are based on telephone interviews with 248 Stanford upperclassmen Dongmin Shim — Daily
model by which other service pro
jects can begin to be decentralized
from the ASSU."
"It's a sensible move and the
ASSU still retains funding over
sight," Crellin said. "It just allows
the board to get on with what it
needs to do without much inter
ference from the ASSU."
The second bill deals more
closely with specific provisions of
the bylaws which apply to the
board. "It essentially makes
minor changes to update an
archaic set of bylaws and makes
them more relevant to today's
publications," Russell said.
It will allow the board to
"function as it was intended," by
clarifying membership qualifica
tions and setting forward a pro

cess of official reform of board
policies, he added.

In addition, the bill clears up
several bylaw inconsistencies
which hamper the board's perfor
mance. "Currently there's an odd
provision in the bylaws that pre
vents the pub board from calling
itself' into existence, Russell
said. "We have to clarify issues
like these in order to function
efficiently."
The senate's administration
and rules committee passed both
bills unanimously, even though
Russell said he had expected
them to be contested. The senate
as a whole will discuss and vote
on the bills at its next meeting
after Thanksgiving break.
"The senate may not be willing
to give up its control over the
board," Russell said. "But hope
fully they will see the importance
of these bills to us and to campus
publications as a whole."
