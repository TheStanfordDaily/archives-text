# Undergrad poll: changes needed in DRs, majors
## 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
The Commission on Under
graduate Education should exam
ine distribution requirements,
Cultures, Ideas and Values and
how majors measure up to each
other, according to a poll of Stan
ford undergraduates.
A survey of about 250 sopho
mores, juniors and seniors con
ducted by The Daily also indicates
that students strongly oppose the
F grade and feel undergraduate ad
vising at the University is lacking.
A majority of respondents were
not familiar with the commission
— the University committee cur
rently looking at what and how
undergraduates learn at Stanford.
However, more than 90 percent of
respondents thought such a re
evaluation was important.
When asked what three areas
of undergraduate education are
most important for the commis
sion to study, the most popular
answer was DRs. Of the 248 up
perclassmen polled, 128 — or 51.6
percent — picked the require
ments as one of their three areas.
CIV was the second most popu
lar choice, named by 22.2 percent

as an area to examine. The third
most named area — with 14.9 per
cent — was majors, specifically
whether the amounts of work dif
ferent majors require are equal or
should be equal.
Other areas that at least 5 per
cent of students said the commis
sion should study are teaching, in
cluding the importance placed on
teaching vs. research, which was
named by 8.9 percent, and the
length of an education, including
whether Stanford should offer a
three-year degree, which was
mentioned by 6.9 percent of re
spondents.
Multiculturalism was men
tioned by 6 percent, while 5.2 per
cent said studying freshman Eng
lish (now called Writing and Criti
cal Thinking) should be a priority
for the commission.
The commission has already

stated that it will examine DRs
and undergraduate majors as part
of its overall re-evaluation.
Specific subjects
Polled about several specific
areas of undergraduate education,
the respondents reacted most
strongly to a possible return of the
F letter grade. Nearly four out of
five students answered "no" when
asked if the F should be reinstat
ed.
Seventy-one percent of students
polled said CIV should be changed,
although the yes-or-no question
did not give an indication of how
the program should be altered.
Respondents were split on ClV's
focus on non-western and female
authors: 35.1 percent said too little
time was spent studying such
authors, 22.2 percent said too
much time was spent and 39.5 per
cent said about the right amount
of time was spent on female and
non-western authors.
The upperclassmen polled said

academic advising for undergradu
ates is insufficient — when asked if
Stanford's advising was adequate,
65.4 percent answered "no." A
smaller number of students asked
about teaching were more positive
about this subject. Of the 147
upperclassmen asked to rate the
quality of teaching at Stanford, 50.3
percent said it was "good" while
39.5 percent said it was "satisfacto
ry." Only 6.8 percent of those polled
said the University's undergradu
ate teaching was "poor."
Stanford students seem to be
pleased with several areas of
undergraduate academics as they
stand now.
A majority of the 248 upperclass
respondents said both the amount
of writing and the amount of math
and science courses students must
complete is "about right" (61.3
percent for writing, 60.1 percent
for science and math). More
required writing was desired by
33.1 percent of students, and a
greater math and science require
ment by 31 percent of respondents.
Students also seem to think the
foreign language requirement is

adequate, if not too small. More
than half of the respondents (58.9
percent) said the foreign language
requirement should be "kept about
the same," while 30.6 percent said
it should be expanded.
Students also seem to think
freshman English is about right as
it stands: 53.6 percent said the pro
gram should be "kept about the
same," 15.3 percent said it should
be "made smaller" and 9.3 percent
wanted to see freshman English
"done away with." Expansion of
the program was favored by 18.5
percent of respondents.
While many students think the
length of some requirements are
about right as they stand, a large
portion of students seem to think
there are too many DRs altogeth
er. According to 42.3 percent of
those polled, the number of DRs is
"too great," while only 2 percent
thought the number was "too lit
tle." Fifty-four percent of students
polled thought the number of DRs
is "about right."
Low profile
The Daily poll also found that a

large percentage of students have
little familiarity with the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education,
although most students think a re
evaluation like the one the commis
sion is undertaking is important.
Of 320 freshmen and upper
classmen asked, 57.5 percent said
they were "not familiar" with the
commission, and 39.7 percent said
they were "somewhat familiar"
with the commission. Only 2.8
percent of respondents called
themselves "very familiar" with
the commission.
More than 90 percent of the
320 students said a re-evaluation
of undergraduate education is
important. However 41.3 per
cent said a re-evaluation was
"very important" and 51.9 per
cent said it was "somewhat
important.
Once the commission's work is
done, students seem to think it
will have a little influence on the
course of a Stanford education.
Sixty percent of respondents said
they think the commission will
have "a minor impact," while
22.8 percent thought it would
have "a major impact" and 4.4
percent thought there would be
"no impact" on Stanford educa
tion.
The commission was formed
last year by University President
Gerhard Casper. The group is re
examining undergraduate educa
tion and will come up with ways
to change areas they single out
for revision. By the end of the
current quarter, the commission
will have picked specific areas to
examine in more depth. A final
report, including suggestions for
changes, will be issued in fall
quarter 1994.

The commission has been meet
ing since October, and is comprised
of 14 faculty members, two alum
ni, two students and Vice Provost

for Institutional Planning Geof
frey Cox. An ASSU-sponsored stu
dent group has also sprung up to
advise the commission.

it stands: 53.6 percent said the pro
gram should be "kept about the
same," 15.3 percent said it should
be "made smaller" and 9.3 percent
wanted to see freshman English
"done away with." Expansion of
the program was favored by 18.5
percent of respondents.
While many students think the
length of some requirements are
about right as they stand, a large
portion of students seem to think
there are too many DRs altogeth
er. According to 42.3 percent of
those polled, the number of DRs is
"too great," while only 2 percent
thought the number was "too lit
tle." Fifty-four percent of students
polled thought the number of DRs
is "about right."
Low profile
The Daily poll also found that a

large percentage of students have
little familiarity with the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education,
although most students think a re
evaluation like the one the commis
sion is undertaking is important.
Of 320 freshmen and upper
classmen asked, 57.5 percent said
they were "not familiar" with the
commission, and 39.7 percent said
they were "somewhat familiar"
with the commission. Only 2.8
percent of respondents called
themselves "very familiar" with
the commission.
More than 90 percent of the
320 students said a re-evaluation
of undergraduate education is
important. However 41.3 per
cent said a re-evaluation was
"very important" and 51.9 per
cent said it was "somewhat
important.
Once the commission's work is
done, students seem to think it
will have a little influence on the
course of a Stanford education.
Sixty percent of respondents said
they think the commission will
have "a minor impact," while
22.8 percent thought it would
have "a major impact" and 4.4
percent thought there would be
"no impact" on Stanford educa
tion.
The commission was formed
last year by University President
Gerhard Casper. The group is re
examining undergraduate educa
tion and will come up with ways
to change areas they single out
for revision. By the end of the
current quarter, the commission
will have picked specific areas to
examine in more depth. A final
report, including suggestions for
changes, will be issued in fall
quarter 1994.

The commission has been meet
ing since October, and is comprised
of 14 faculty members, two alum
ni, two students and Vice Provost

for Institutional Planning Geof
frey Cox. An ASSU-sponsored stu
dent group has also sprung up to
advise the commission.

The Commission on Under
graduate Education should exam
ine distribution requirements,
Cultures, Ideas and Values and
how majors measure up to each
other, according to a poll of Stan
ford undergraduates.
A survey of about 250 sopho
mores, juniors and seniors con
ducted by The Daily also indicates
that students strongly oppose the
F grade and feel undergraduate ad
vising at the University is lacking.
A majority of respondents were
not familiar with the commission
— the University committee cur
rently looking at what and how
undergraduates learn at Stanford.
However, more than 90 percent of
respondents thought such a re
evaluation was important.
When asked what three areas
of undergraduate education are
most important for the commis
sion to study, the most popular
answer was DRs. Of the 248 up
perclassmen polled, 128 — or 51.6
percent — picked the require
ments as one of their three areas.
CIV was the second most popu
lar choice, named by 22.2 percent

as an area to examine. The third
most named area — with 14.9 per
cent — was majors, specifically
whether the amounts of work dif
ferent majors require are equal or
should be equal.
Other areas that at least 5 per
cent of students said the commis
sion should study are teaching, in
cluding the importance placed on
teaching vs. research, which was
named by 8.9 percent, and the
length of an education, including
whether Stanford should offer a
three-year degree, which was
mentioned by 6.9 percent of re
spondents.
Multiculturalism was men
tioned by 6 percent, while 5.2 per
cent said studying freshman Eng
lish (now called Writing and Criti
cal Thinking) should be a priority
for the commission.
The commission has already

stated that it will examine DRs
and undergraduate majors as part
of its overall re-evaluation.
Specific subjects
Polled about several specific
areas of undergraduate education,
the respondents reacted most
strongly to a possible return of the
F letter grade. Nearly four out of
five students answered "no" when
asked if the F should be reinstat
ed.
Seventy-one percent of students
polled said CIV should be changed,
although the yes-or-no question
did not give an indication of how
the program should be altered.
Respondents were split on ClV's
focus on non-western and female
authors: 35.1 percent said too little
time was spent studying such
authors, 22.2 percent said too
much time was spent and 39.5 per
cent said about the right amount
of time was spent on female and
non-western authors.
The upperclassmen polled said

academic advising for undergradu
ates is insufficient — when asked if
Stanford's advising was adequate,
65.4 percent answered "no." A
smaller number of students asked
about teaching were more positive
about this subject. Of the 147
upperclassmen asked to rate the
quality of teaching at Stanford, 50.3
percent said it was "good" while
39.5 percent said it was "satisfacto
ry." Only 6.8 percent of those polled
said the University's undergradu
ate teaching was "poor."
Stanford students seem to be
pleased with several areas of
undergraduate academics as they
stand now.
A majority of the 248 upperclass
respondents said both the amount
of writing and the amount of math
and science courses students must
complete is "about right" (61.3
percent for writing, 60.1 percent
for science and math). More
required writing was desired by
33.1 percent of students, and a
greater math and science require
ment by 31 percent of respondents.
Students also seem to think the
foreign language requirement is

adequate, if not too small. More
than half of the respondents (58.9
percent) said the foreign language
requirement should be "kept about
the same," while 30.6 percent said
it should be expanded.
Students also seem to think
freshman English is about right as
it stands: 53.6 percent said the pro
gram should be "kept about the
same," 15.3 percent said it should
be "made smaller" and 9.3 percent
wanted to see freshman English
"done away with." Expansion of
the program was favored by 18.5
