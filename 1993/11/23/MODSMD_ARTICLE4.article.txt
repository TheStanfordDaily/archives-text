# Undergrad poll: changes needed in DRs, majors

### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
The Commission on Under
graduate Education should exam
ine distribution requirements,
Cultures, Ideas and Values and
how majors measure up to each

A survey of about 250 sopho

cent — was majors, specifically
whether the amounts of work dif
ferent majors require are equal or
should be equal.
Other areas that at least 5 per

teaching vs. research, which was
named by 8.9 percent, and the
length of an education, including
whether Stanford should offer a
three-year degree, which was
mentioned by 6.9 percent of re
spondents.
Multiculturalism was men
tioned by 6 percent, while 5.2 per
cent said studying freshman Eng

for the commission.
