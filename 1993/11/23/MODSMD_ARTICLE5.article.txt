# Burying Big Game
## Officials total damages 
### Tish Williams Senior staff writer 
As Saturday's Big Game embarrass
ment settled into its place in the record
book yesterday, Stanford officials were left
to deal with its aftermath, which includes
15 arrests and $4,000 in damage to Stan
ford Stadium.
At the end of Stanford's 46-17 loss, hun
dreds of UC-Berkeley fans rushed out of
the stands — tearing down one goalpost,
destroying fences, tearing up the field and
damaging a University Facilities van.
Fifteen people were arrested by the
Stanford Police in events related to the
game, including several participants in the
post-game melee as well as those involved
in an attack on the Stanford Band during
its halftime show.
Five individuals were booked for public

drunkenness, and three were cited for
fence-jumping, according to Stanford Po
lice Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Two other unrelated incidents of bat
tery were reported, one involving an irate
fan behind the wheel of a car who bumped
a traffic controller, causing the victim
minor injuries, Niemeyer said, as well as
an altercation in which an usher assaulted
an older fan.
Niemeyer also noted the arrest, citation
and release of a group he called the "Berke
ley five" — five fans who attacked the
Band, disrupting its mid-game perfor
mance.
"I was disappointed that some Cal fans
chose to disrupt the Stanford Band's half
time show," said Berkeley Police Chief Vic
toria Harrison. "I'm just happy there was
no one injured in the celebration
after the game. I appreciate the
enthusiasm of students, but get
ting rid of the destructive part of
that celebration is something
we're striving for."
In response to last year's near
riot scenario, both the UC-Berkeley
and Stanford administrations, the

Rally and Axe Committees and each
school's band had tried to curtail
violence this year. Their planning
was not entirely successful, as vio
lence still plagued the event.
"To see everything fall apart is
a terrible disappointment, after the
pre-game show and President
Casper and Chancellor Tien
exchanging game balls — all that
was done to take the violence away.
It was all for nothing," said Steve
Zika, chairman of the Axe Commit
tee. "The Axe Committee may or

may not go (to Big Game) next
year. In the past it's been an auto
matic decision — next year it'll be a
conscious, tough decision."
Despite the problems involved in
the game, Niemeyer felt things
could have been considerably
worse. "Given the number of people
and the intensity of the game, over
all we were pretty fortunate," he
said. "Fifteen to 20 arrests used to
be run-of-the-mill back when there
was alcohol served at the games."
Damage to the field and stadi

um were estimated to be in the
ballpark of $4,000, according to
John Davis, director of Facilities
and Operations. Davis noted that
the figure includes costs of the
torn-down goalpost, a vandalized
Facilities truck, some destroyed
fencing and future labor hours.
Grass and field damages were
minor, Davis said, adding that the
sod can be easily replaced before a
soccer game that will be played at
Stanford on Dec. 18.
Both Zika and Brian Tsai, head

of Berkeley's Rally Committee
agreed that the absence of the Axe
on the field might have caused
Golden Bear fans to storm the field
in frustration. The two students
had reached an accord with the
Stanford Police that the Axe would
be exchanged off the field and the
victor would observe a minimum
five-minute "cooling off" period —
which was ultimately lengthened
by the police — before heading
onto the field, according to Zika.
"The exchanging of the Axe was

done with class on both sides, with
a gentlemanly handshake," Zika
said. "I don't want to second
guess the police . . . the plan just
backfired. I think it was ridiculous
that it was our home stadium, for
the Band to have been chased out
of their own stadium."
"I think it would've been better
if we could've taken the Axe out
earlier," Tsai said. "We wouldn't
have had so (many) people on the
field. It was a madhouse, it was
pretty crammed in there."
