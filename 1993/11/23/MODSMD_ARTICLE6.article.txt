# Play it again, Bill
## New athletic building's video network puts coaches on top 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Bill Walsh may soon be a com
puter expert as well as a football
genius when the new Department
of Athletics building — wired with
the latest in computer technology
— opens in mid-December, allow
ing him to watch tapes on comput
ers instead of VCRs.
According to Chip Haven, a net
working consultant with Net
working and Communications
Systems, a digitalized video sys

tem will be phased in to the Daper
(Department of Athletics, Physi
cal Education and Recreation)
Building beginning in January.
"No one in the country will
have a video network of this mag
nitude," said John Driver, general
manager of Home Team Advan
tage, the company developing the
software for the system. "Stanford
will be way ahead of everyone else,
as usual . . . they will be at the
forefront of technology."
Driver said a Stanford alumnus
donated the equipment. He did not

disclose the cost, but said it was
very affordable.
The system, which is user
friendly, will allow coaches to
watch videos on a computer sim
ply by touching the computer
screen. Coaches will also be able to
manipulate the video to watch spe
cific plays.
Since most of what the coaches
do "depends on reviewing tapes of
games and practices to improve
performance . . . we're substitut
ing a system that digitalizes the
video so that computers can use
it," Haven said. The system will
eventually be networked to 48
terminals in the building, includ
ing terminals in coaches' offices.
The Hall of Fame room in
Daper will also "take advantage
of the digitalized system in the
building to distribute highlights
of Stanford athletic events,"
Haven said.
Kiosks with "touch-sensitive
screens" in the Hall of Fame room
will allow people to instantly view
a variety of videos, ranging from
biographies to season highlights.
Videos will be able to be projected
onto either the kiosk's screen or
onto the large screen in the
room's theater. The room will
open to the public in February.
Haven added that eight
schools in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence have expressed interest in
the high-tech system. "There has

been a tremendous amount of
interest from colleges, as well as
from the pros," he said.
In addition to this new digital
ized video system, the rest of the
building's wiring "will be brought
up to today's University stan
dards," Haven said. This includes
installing ethernet connections at
every telephone outlet.
Daper will also be equipped
with "special jacks around the
building to assist camera crews
who come in to film," Haven said.
These jacks will eliminate the
long cables that camera crews
currently use when interviewing
coaches or players.
Networking and Communi
cation Systems and Home
Team Advantage are working
together to install these sys
tems and ensure that they
work properly.
Daper, which is located
between the Tennis Stadium and
Maples Pavilion, includes locker
rooms, meeting rooms, training
rooms and a basketball court, as
well as coaches' offices and the
Hall of Fame room.
