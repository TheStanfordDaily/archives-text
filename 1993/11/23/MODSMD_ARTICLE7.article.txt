# Intentionally missing meals
## Students plan to fast for charity 
### Jamie Taylor 
Try as they might to eat all 19 meals, despite
scheduling conflicts and red snapper nights, most
Stanford students miss their fair share of food ser
vice breakfasts, lunches and dinners.
Tomorrow, however, skipping meals at Stanford
may do more than simply contribute to the waste, as
more than 600 students give up their food for an an
nual campus-wide fast sponsored by the Stanford In
ternational Development Organization.
The money saved goes to SIDO, which works to
aid developing countries both by offering direct as
sistance and by increasing campus awareness.
"The fast promotes awareness of underdevelop

ment in other countries and helps students to do
something simple in order to help," said sophomore
SIDO member Meg Hagenah.
Students can forfeit their meal cards to hashers in
their dining halls any time until tomorrow morning,
donating two or three meals or up to 12 points to the
organization.
Students who live off campus or in a co-operative
or self-operative house are still invited to fast and do
nate money personally or through their house gov
ernment, said senior Amy Sah, co-chair of SIDO.
Though organizers can project numbers of stu
dents participating, predicting monetary results is a
bit trickier, senior co-chair Rani
Deshpande said.
The first year that University
Food Service instituted points on
campus, "We had people giving 50
and 100 points," Deshpande said.
Food Service then capped dona
tions at 12 points, at a dollar to
each point. Now, however, SIDO
receives only 50 cents for every
point-dollar donated, meaning
that it can only receive a maxi
mum of $6 per student, Desh
pande said.
While some students actually
participate in the fast, others sim
ply donate their meals and eat at
alternative locations.
"Most people just donate their
meals and eat elsewhere," Desh
pande said. "Tomorrow will be the
first time I'll actually be fasting.
The idea is to donate some of your
food budget to alleviate hunger

elsewhere â€” it's a symbolic ges
ture as well as a practical one."
The main portion of profits will
benefit the Kitale Tronznoia Inte
grated Farming Project in Kenya,
chosen because of its stability and
high level of organization.
Secondary proceeds will go to
the Chandrugunda Mandal
Sheep-Rearing Cooperative in
India and the Shadika Halfway
House for Women in Calcutta,
Sah said.
"This fast is a good thing
because so many students don't
have time to get involved in grass
roots projects," Sah said. "Since
this is easy and takes no time, it
gives hundreds of students an
opportunity to give something to
charity."
As part of the fast, SIDO is
sponsoring an educational event
at 6 p.m. in Roble lounge, with a
film and discussion focusing on
hunger issues led by Walter Fal
con, an agricultural economist
and director of Stanford's Insti
tute for International Studies.
