The American Indian Science and Engineer
ing Society recognized its Stanford chapter with
the "Chapter of the Year" award last weekend,
choosing the chapter from among more than a
hundred others.
Fifth-year senior Nicky Michael, vice-presi
dent of the chapter last year, said the Stanford
group's successful tutoring program for Native
American students at the University may have
distinguished it from other chapters.
"Last year was really a milestone for us
because it was the first time we kept all the
freshmen off academic probation for the autumn
quarter," she said, explaining that the organiza
tion has had trouble keeping its tutees off proba
tion in the past.
In addition, the Stanford chapter emphasized
outreach activities last year, including a regional
AISES conference for California, Washington,
Oregon and Hawaii chapters last spring.
The chapter also worked to make Stanford one
of five sites for an AISES summer camp program
for high school students. Because of last sum
mer's success, Stanford will become a permanent
site for the five-week camp in the future, accord
ing to Paula Dybdahl, who served as one of four
resident assistants for the 30 participants.
The award, based on 12 criteria, including pre
college programs and chapter advisers, was pre

sented at last weekend's national AISES confer
ence in Spokane, Wash.
Michael believes the Stanford chapter's three
advisers are a major contribution to its strength.
The advisers include two faculty members, Jim
Larimore and Cheryll Hawthorne-Searight, and
one outside member, Paul Kabotie.
Larimore, assistant dean of students and
director for the American Indian Program Office,
said, "This award is a great recognition for the
hard work that current and past students have
put in to the chapter."
He added that Stanford's AISES chapter is
unique among the other engineering organiza
tions on campus because of its small size. "Even
such a small group can have such a great impact
across the country. It's a pretty terrific feeling,"
Larimore said.
Dybdahl agreed that the strength of the chap
ter is unique for its size. "We have a pretty small
Native American population at Stanford anyway,
but within that, we have about 20 active mem
bers in the chapter. There are only a few of us
but we seem to do a lot."
The AISES organization strongly promotes
the need for people to give back to their tribal
and university communities, according to Lari
more. He said that the national organization
offers college student leadership programs and
provided $550,000 in student scholarships last
year.
