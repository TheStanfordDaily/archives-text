"Breast cancer patients need
someone to touch base with ...
someone who'll listen to them,
understand what they are talking
about medically, and take the
time to answer their questions.
I shone them things that are part
of their treatment. I provide the
information in a less stressful
situation and try to take all the
mystique out of it.
"I don't mind putting myself on
the line each time. Having
patients feel they've got a hat idle
on what's going on gives me a
great deal of satisfaction. They're
not taking from me. They're
giving me a whole lot."
