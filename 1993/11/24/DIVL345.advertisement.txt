When You're Considering a
Career in Sales and Trading,
Consider One More Thing.
Consider the investment banking firm where
sales and trading professionals are responsible
for monitoring the developments that impact
international markets on behalf of its clients
worldwide. Where professional
standards are reflected in principled everyday
practices. Where the talent of each individual
is an integral part of the team effort. And
consider the firm where those individuals
who choose to accept the challenges set
before them are given the opportunity to
excel both professionally and personally.
In short, consider
Sales and Trading
at Goldman Sachs.
