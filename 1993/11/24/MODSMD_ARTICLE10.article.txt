Indecent TV ban struck clown
WASHINGTON (AP) — Government regula
tions banning indecent programming on broad
cast and cable I V channels were declared uncon
stitutional yesterday in separate ftxleral appeals
court rulings.
I he court set aside an Federal Communica
tions Commission regulation that bans indecent
rV and radio broadcasts between 6 a.m. and mid
night, holding that the rule was an unconstitu
tionally broad encroachment on free speech.
In another ruling, the same three-judge panel
struck down FCC regulations that allowed cable
operators to ban what they deemed indecent pro
gramming from leased-access channels. Such a
regulation amounted to letting the cable operator
stand in place of the government as a censor, the
court held.
The panel also struck down a related regula
tion barring material that is obscene, sexually
explicit or promotes unlawful conduct on cable
channels set aside for public, educational or gov
ernment use.
Jackson trial date set
SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) — Witnesses
have been subpoenaed to testify before a grand
jury investigating child molestation charges
against Michael Jackson, the singer's lawyer said
yesterday.
And the judge presiding over a civil lawsuit
filed by the boy who alleges he was molested by
Jackson set a March 21 trial date.
Jackson also was ordered to submit to a depo
sition before Jan. 31, when he is expected to have
completed what his doctor has called a rehabili
tation for addiction to painkillers.
The judge made it clear that the civil trial
could be delayed if criminal charges are filed
against Jackson.
