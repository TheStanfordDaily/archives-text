# Senate fails to pass revised Brady bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate
negotiators tried to break the impasse
over the Brady handgun-control bill
yesterday — but gave up in disagree
ment and uncertainty over when dis
cussions will resume.
Republicans said they would contin
ue talks today. But Nancy Coffey,
spokeswoman for Sen. Howard Met
zenbaum, D-Ohio, the Senate's chief
sponsor of the bill, said "we've gone the
last mile. If they want to change their
mind overnight, we're still open to it."
On the other side, Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole's spokesman Clark
son Hine said, "We're still trying to
work it out. We were within an eyelash
of an agreement."
Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell called on the Senate to return
next Tuesday to try to salvage Brady

— which calls for a five-business-day
waiting period and background check
on handgun customers.
Earlier, Metzenbaum had outlined
how a compromise might work: "What
we can do, if Republicans agree, is pass
the conference report, as is, with an
understanding we would have a sup
plemental piece of legislation when we
come back," that would resolve some
Republican concerns.
Dole outlined an alternative he
planned to offer next week that could
possibly lead to ending the waiting
period before the five-year period in
the pending legislation.
"I think there is a sincere effort, by
Democrats and Republicans, who
think we can make this a better bill,"
Dole said.
However, such changes would

require House assent as well, and
Speaker Thomas Foley said he had told
legislators he would not call them back.
Mitchell told the Senate to return
next Tuesday afternoon to deal with
Dole's offer and with the bill as it
emerged Monday from a conference of
House and Senate negotiators.
"We will try again on next Tuesday,
and in all likelihood again on next
Wednesday," he said, reflecting the
difficulty that Brady bill supporters
have had in putting together the 60
votes needed to move past the Republi
can blockade to a final vote.
A version of the bill passed the Sen
ate late Saturday, 63-36. That bill said
the waiting period would phase out
after four years, unless the attorney
general extended it to five years. The
House passed a five-year provision.

Then came a fractious House-Sen
ate conference that chose the five-year
House version on Monday.
Mitchell called the five-year versus
four-plus-one-year provision "a dis
tinction without a difference in practi
cal terms."
Also dropped in conference was a
Senate provision that would have
allowed the waiting period to phase
out before five years if the attorney
general, using specified standards,
deemed a national instant background
check system sufficiently operational.
The House passed the conference ver
sion by a 238-187 vote early Tuesday.
If the "people on the other side real
ly want the Brady bill, it can be gotten
very quickly," Dole said. "We were
quite flexible on Saturday, and for
being flexible, we got shafted."
