# Clinton seeks new relations with North Korea

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The United States is
ready for a broad new relationship with North Korea
if the communist nation reopens talks with the South
and allows outside inspections of its suspect nuclear
program, President Clinton said yesterday.
"The door will be open," he said. Clinton also said
he was not eager to ask the United Nations for eco
nomic sanctions against North Korea if it continues
stalling on nuclear inspections. The administration
has said sanctions are a viable option.
North Korea insists that its nuclear program is
designed to produce electric power not weapons, but it
has balked at permitting outside inspections.
Clinton said he and South Korean President Kim
Young Sam have agreed to "re-examine our security
approach" to North Korea, but only if the North met

two demands: resume a dialogue with the South and
permit nuclear inspections by the International
Atomic Energy Agency.
"I don't consider that weakening our position or
changing it or rewarding aggression," Clinton said in
response to a question about his statement on Mon
day that he planned to announce a new approach to
the nuclear problem.
Both Clinton and Kim used the same phrase to
describe their approach to settling the North Korea
nuclear issue: "thorough and broad" â€” an apparent
reference to a willingness to offer incentives and
rewards for North Korean behavior.
One possible reward could be U.S. diplomatic
recognition of Pyongyang. But Clinton was vague
about what North Korea could expect if it met the

U.S. conditions.
"In fact, what we want to do is to diminish the mil
itary tensions in the area, but that has to begin by the
willingness on the part of North Korea to allow the
inspections and to resume the dialogue," Clinton
said.
A senior administration official had said shortly
before Clinton's meeting with Kim that the United
States was willing to drop the 1994 joint U.S.-South
Korean military exercise called Team Spirit if the
North met Clinton's demands. The official, who spoke
on condition he not be identified, had said Washing
ton would reserve the right to revive Team Spirit later
if talks faltered.
Asked about dropping Team Spirit, Clinton denied
there had been any decision.
