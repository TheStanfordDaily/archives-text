## Editorial Qualitative impacts The 						report on women faculty displays need to have personal accounts 
### 
WHEN researching an issue,
one of the best ways to
unearth insightful infor
mation is to put aside voluminous
reports and stacks of quantitative
data and talk to the people in
volved. Often, personal accounts
can have a greater impact and
explain a situation far better than
charts or tables.
In looking at the recruitment
and retention of women faculty at
Stanford, a provost's committee
did just that. In addition to their
number crunching, they went out
and talked to women faculty, some
times hearing harrowing accounts
of what it's like to work here.
One woman recounted how she
was made to feel uncomfortable by
her department chair, who kept
pornographic magazines in plain
view. Another said she felt the Uni
versity did not "care about me as a
person" after being forced to wait a
full day before she was informed of
a tenure committee's decision.
While an internal report was
compiled including all the quotes,
Provost Condpleezza Rice and half
the committee decided to remove
some descriptive quotations before
releasing the report to the public.
Rice and other University officials
felt that many of the women, who
were promised anonymity during
the committee's research process,
could be identified by their quotes.
While the editing caused concern
among some faculty members,
Rice's decision was warranted.
When people are promised an
onymity, the committee has a
responsibility to honor that pact.
The careers of younger faculty who
spoke out could have been jeopar
dized if their comments had been
made public.
This controversy, however, raises
two important points. First, future

University committees should care
fully plan their research methods,
allowing interviewees multiple
options, including: anonymous
comments for committee use only,
anonymous comments that may be
distributed publicly, and at
tributable public comments. In fact,
some women interviewed may have
wanted their quotes published —
but by granting all interviewees
anonymity, the committee was pre
cluded from including them in the
public report.
Qualitative interview-based re
search is an integral part of such
reports, and this incident should
not discourage committees from
using this method.
And such statements should
never be expunged from a report
just because they portray Stanford
in an unflattering light. Bringing
the University's problems out into
the open will do more to find solu
tions than hiding them behind
closed doors. It will also reassure
the public that the administration
isn't afraid to recognize and con
front Stanford's flaws.
Secondly, the report's alarm bell
should not be drowned out in the
to-edit-or-not controversy. Stan
ford is third from the bottom in its
percentage of women faculty am
ong Ivy League and Pacific 10 Con
ference schools. Furthermore, the
report also cites that the culture in
many departments is not support
ive of younger faculty, especially
women.
After crunching such sobering
data for eight months and talking
to faculty members, the committee
came up with 16 recommendations.
For example, the report declared
that the University should create a
culture of faculty support, increase
the number of women faculty and
promote salary equity.
Administrators should heed
these suggestions and make some
concrete changes. This report
deserves more than a just a spot on
administrators' bookshelves.
For an institution that prides
itself on being a top-notch universi
ty, ranking third from the bottom
in anything is pitiful.
