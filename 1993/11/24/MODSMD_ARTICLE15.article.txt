## Reaching out to infinity 
### 
IT IS A SHAME Columbus had to
shatter our illusions of a flat earth.
Return to a time when people truly
believed that if you walked far enough
you would eventually reach the ends of
the earth.
Imagine the possibilities of this view.
Standing there on the precipice of land
and space, humanity would finally be
allowed a glimpse of infinity itself.
However, we've been cheated out of
such a view by our own intelligence.
Now, we know that if you walk far en
ough you will eventually end up where
you started from. The only suggestion of
infinity we can get is found in mathe
matical equations and a few brilliant
poems.
When I think about this, I remember
the childhood desire many of us had to be
rocketed off this earth and into the uni
verse. Who among us can forget the
image of the astronaut, free-floating in
an endless expanse of blackness? Who
hasn't wished that it was him or herself
inside that white suit, reporting across
the static of millions of miles: Yes, I am
looking into infinity. It is amazing.
Do you recall when you were first
told about infinity? My father explained
that the universe stretched on forever,
without end.
In my mind, an expanse of sheer
darkness grew and grew and then

knocked into the limits of my 5-year-old
mind. Try as I might, squeezing my eyes
closed and imagining boundless space, I
could not grasp an image of the infinite.
Everything I had ever known had ends.
I could conceive of infinity only as the
greatest amount possible. When my
father asked me how much I loved him, I
threw out my arms as far as possible and
said "As much as infinity." I was saying
my love for you is as big as this infinite
that you told me about. It is boundless
because I cannot see its end.
My mother bought me Shel Silver
stein's "Where The Sidewalk Ends," and
though I thought I knew wherever one
sidewalk ended, another began, I
couldn't help but wonder.
What if there were a place where the
roads, land, and earth simply came to a
halt, where I could lean over the edge
and look out. What would I see? If I fell
off, would I simply tumble forever
through boundless space? Or would I
eventually hit a limit, land, and like the
Roadrunner's coyote, simply get up and
go back to the drawing board? This
drawing board of my mind where I
worked and worked over this idea of
infinity.
It wasn't until years later that I began
to conceive of an infinite as it related to
my own life. It occurred to me that I
would never be able to view a physical

infinity, one of boundless absence, from
the prospective of a presence.
I came to understand that two sorts
of infinites existed: The first began with
my skin and radiated outward, in all
directions, forever.
The second also began at my flesh, but
collapsed inwards, into the infinity of my
mind. The latter is the one I've been able
to glimpse.
At night, on the brink of conscious
ness, my mind expands into its own uni
verse of imagination. The limits of com
prehension dissolve and I am every
where at once, filling all space and all
time with my boundlessness. I do not
bump into any ends.
This is the infinity of presence, rather
than of absence, fulfilling mathematical
laws of positive and negative.
I realized that our thoughts are con
stant and without end, unceasing in our
lifetime; until death.
Finally, I understood: each human
death is the death of an infinite. A
moment where infinite presence crosses
over into infinite absence.
Two parallel lines finally converging,
in time.

Nicole now realizes the limit of infinity
we thought we'd have the Axe forever
