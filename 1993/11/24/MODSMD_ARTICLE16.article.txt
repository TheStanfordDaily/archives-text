## ASSU Pub Board bills help to support student voices 
### 
THE TEN-FOOT pile of paper and
garbage barricading the door to
the Storke Publications Building
might not have been Stanford's student
publications' most troublesome obstacle
this year. Instead, the current ASSU by
laws may prove to be a much more obsti
nate pile of paper. Two recently intro
duced bills in the ASSU Senate, howev
er, may hold the solution to Stanford's
publication woes.
If passed, the bills, co-sponsored by
Council of Presidents member Ron
Brown and graduate senator Neil
Crellin, will help reshape student publi
cations' relationship with the ASSU.
The bills amend current by-laws to allow
student publications much-needed flexi
bility and support.
Unlike The Stanford Daily, which
became independent in 1971, the majori
ty of Stanford student publications rely
on the ASSU's Publications Board for
administrative and financial support.
Sadly, in recent years student publica
tions have fallen on hard times, and Pub
Board hasn't been there to pick up the
slack. Even more tragic, the Board, or
lack thereof, may have denied many
publications their ability to help them
selves and each other.
Pub Board incongruities have created
a "flash-in-the-pan" syndrome in which
publications publish a few times and
then disappear. This year's freshmen
may never know what campus publica
tions like The Release, Newspeak, and
G-Spot offered to campus information
and debate. And next year's freshmen
may not have the opportunity to read
this year's crop of newcomers, like The
Element, The Daily Planet and Loose
Ends, either. Stanford may be left with a
publishing community as ineffective as
it is ephemeral despite the involvement
of dedicated and hard-working students.
Many publishing problems are rooted
in the ASSU bylaws themselves. Cur
rently, if Pub Board desires to make

changes in its operation or governance,
it must entertain a month-long process
of prior notice and senatorial voting. If
publications fail to receive the two
thirds vote needed for by-laws changes,
they either give up or start again. Creat
ing a student publication is tough
enough without having to play ASSU
politics as well.
Faced with these bureaucratic obsta
cles, publications abandoned the Pub
Board and regressed into an informal
organization. The absence of a working
Pub Board has denied many publications
the benefits of long-term support and
consistency. Without the presence of
active members, the Board itself
becomes nothing more than a money
conduit for shrinking publications with
escalating costs.
Today student publications find
themselves perched on an administrative
house of cards thrown together by past
editors and Pub Board directors. Few
publications can remember, let alone
benefit, from these unenforceable agree
ments lost in old file cabinets.
The portion of Pub Board cannon
that is codified in the ASSU bylaws can
hardly be said to benefit publications,
either. Among other things, current by
laws provide guaranteed space for orga
nizations that no longer publish, and a
curious provision that prevents current
publications from creating a board,
because a board has not yet been creat
ed. The cumulative result being that the
unofficial organization of publications
cannot make the concrete and official
changes to the Pub Board needed to
ensure publication longevity.
Last spring, the senate resoundingly
supported the Pub Board through a
$17,000 computer bill. Until that time,
student publications competed with one
another for use of two dust-clogged Mac
intosh computers and a hodge-podge of
pirated software. This fall, the senate
will be asked to go one step further in its

diagnosis. And Doctors Brown and
Crellin may have come up with the per
fect prescription for what ails Stanford's
publications.
The answer seems surprisingly sim
ple. Allow student publications the
power to fix themselves. As one might
guess, that's currently rather difficult
for a Board that doesn't exist, and one
whose regulations lack any enforceable
impact. Brown and Crellin's bill would
allow the Pub Board to function as it
was intended — as a governing and sup
port group for Stanford's publications.
The reform comes in two steps and
two bills, both of which have come out
the senate's Administration and Rules
Committee with unanimously favorable
recommendations. The first bill corrects
some of the by-laws' inconsistencies as
they now stand. It updates facility guide
lines to deal with existing publications,
ensures publications secure access to
Pub Board equipment and facilities, and
most importantly allows for the creation
of a working Board. The cumulative
impact of these changes would make an
archaic set of by-laws relevant to today's
student publications.
The second bill, though more contro
versial, would make a much more sweep
ing and important change to the by
laws. Umpteen pages of by law text
would be replaced with a single para
graph. The current "Polices of the Publi
cation Board" would cease to be part of
the ASSU's by-laws and would become a
separate governing document more flexi
ble and responsive to the needs of publi
cations.
Instead of four weeks of administra
tive hassle, one Pub Board meeting
would suffice in creating working solu
tions to publications concerns. Those
policies would then only require a major
ity of the Senate to enact, rather than
the present two-thirds vote. The bill
would enable student publications to
begin working together to form a more

responsive, cohesive, and long lasting
publishing community.
The bill strikes the perfect balance of
senate and Pub Board power. While pub
lications are responsible for the daily
operational concerns of the Board and
its long term plan of action, the senate
retains a negative check on Pub Board
guidelines. Senators desiring to make
changes to "The Policies of the Publica
tions Board" also retain their power to
modify the document. The same two
thirds vote required now for modifica
tion would suffice after the bill's passage
as well.
Brown and Crellin's bill sends a
strong message of support for Stanford's
struggling Pub Board. The combined
impact of the two bills about to come
before the Senate would be a stronger,
more vibrant publishing community. It
won't take long before that vibrancy
translates into more and better campus
publications. Hopefully then, the only
giant pile of papers worth mentioning
will be the one in front of Stanford's
post office.

this year. Instead, the current ASSU by
laws may prove to be a much more obsti
nate pile of paper. Two recently intro
duced bills in the ASSU Senate, howev
er, may hold the solution to Stanford's
publication woes.
If passed, the bills, co-sponsored by
Council of Presidents member Ron
Brown and graduate senator Neil
Crellin, will help reshape student publi
cations' relationship with the ASSU.
The bills amend current by-laws to allow
student publications much-needed flexi
bility and support.
Unlike The Stanford Daily, which
became independent in 1971, the majori
ty of Stanford student publications rely
on the ASSU's Publications Board for
administrative and financial support.
Sadly, in recent years student publica
tions have fallen on hard times, and Pub
Board hasn't been there to pick up the
slack. Even more tragic, the Board, or
lack thereof, may have denied many
publications their ability to help them
selves and each other.
Pub Board incongruities have created
a "flash-in-the-pan" syndrome in which
publications publish a few times and
then disappear. This year's freshmen
may never know what campus publica
tions like The Release, Newspeak, and
G-Spot offered to campus information
and debate. And next year's freshmen
may not have the opportunity to read
this year's crop of newcomers, like The
Element, The Daily Planet and Loose
Ends, either. Stanford may be left with a
publishing community as ineffective as
it is ephemeral despite the involvement
of dedicated and hard-working students.
Many publishing problems are rooted
in the ASSU bylaws themselves. Cur
rently, if Pub Board desires to make

changes in its operation or governance,
it must entertain a month-long process
of prior notice and senatorial voting. If
publications fail to receive the two
thirds vote needed for by-laws changes,
they either give up or start again. Creat
ing a student publication is tough
enough without having to play ASSU
politics as well.
Faced with these bureaucratic obsta
cles, publications abandoned the Pub
Board and regressed into an informal
organization. The absence of a working
Pub Board has denied many publications
the benefits of long-term support and
consistency. Without the presence of
active members, the Board itself
becomes nothing more than a money
conduit for shrinking publications with
escalating costs.
Today student publications find
themselves perched on an administrative
house of cards thrown together by past
editors and Pub Board directors. Few
publications can remember, let alone
benefit, from these unenforceable agree
ments lost in old file cabinets.
The portion of Pub Board cannon
that is codified in the ASSU bylaws can
hardly be said to benefit publications,
either. Among other things, current by
laws provide guaranteed space for orga
nizations that no longer publish, and a
curious provision that prevents current
publications from creating a board,
because a board has not yet been creat
ed. The cumulative result being that the
unofficial organization of publications
cannot make the concrete and official
changes to the Pub Board needed to
ensure publication longevity.
Last spring, the senate resoundingly
supported the Pub Board through a
$17,000 computer bill. Until that time,
student publications competed with one
another for use of two dust-clogged Mac
intosh computers and a hodge-podge of
pirated software. This fall, the senate
will be asked to go one step further in its

diagnosis. And Doctors Brown and
Crellin may have come up with the per
fect prescription for what ails Stanford's
publications.
The answer seems surprisingly sim
ple. Allow student publications the
power to fix themselves. As one might
guess, that's currently rather difficult
for a Board that doesn't exist, and one
whose regulations lack any enforceable
impact. Brown and Crellin's bill would
allow the Pub Board to function as it
was intended — as a governing and sup
port group for Stanford's publications.
The reform comes in two steps and
two bills, both of which have come out
the senate's Administration and Rules
Committee with unanimously favorable
recommendations. The first bill corrects
some of the by-laws' inconsistencies as
they now stand. It updates facility guide
lines to deal with existing publications,
ensures publications secure access to
Pub Board equipment and facilities, and
most importantly allows for the creation
of a working Board. The cumulative
impact of these changes would make an
archaic set of by-laws relevant to today's
student publications.
The second bill, though more contro
versial, would make a much more sweep
ing and important change to the by
laws. Umpteen pages of by law text
would be replaced with a single para
graph. The current "Polices of the Publi
cation Board" would cease to be part of
the ASSU's by-laws and would become a
separate governing document more flexi
ble and responsive to the needs of publi
cations.
Instead of four weeks of administra
tive hassle, one Pub Board meeting
would suffice in creating working solu
tions to publications concerns. Those
policies would then only require a major
ity of the Senate to enact, rather than
the present two-thirds vote. The bill
would enable student publications to
begin working together to form a more

responsive, cohesive, and long lasting
publishing community.
The bill strikes the perfect balance of
senate and Pub Board power. While pub
lications are responsible for the daily
operational concerns of the Board and
its long term plan of action, the senate
retains a negative check on Pub Board
guidelines. Senators desiring to make
changes to "The Policies of the Publica
tions Board" also retain their power to
modify the document. The same two
thirds vote required now for modifica
tion would suffice after the bill's passage
as well.
Brown and Crellin's bill sends a
strong message of support for Stanford's
struggling Pub Board. The combined
impact of the two bills about to come
before the Senate would be a stronger,
more vibrant publishing community. It
won't take long before that vibrancy
translates into more and better campus
publications. Hopefully then, the only
giant pile of papers worth mentioning
will be the one in front of Stanford's
post office.
