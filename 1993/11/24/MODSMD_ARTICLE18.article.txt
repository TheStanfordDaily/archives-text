## Yeast genome to yield info on human genes State-of-the-art process reveals DNA code 
### Corinna Wu 
It may not be obvious what
humans have in common with
an organism that makes bread
rise, but to Stanford researchers
involved in the Human Genome
Project, studying yeast is a key
to mapping the gene sequence of
human DNA.
Many of the proteins in yeast
are identical to those in humans,
and these similarities make
yeast a valuable "model organ
ism," according to David Bot
stein, chairman of the School of
Medicine's Department of Ge
netics.
The Human Genome Project
is aimed at mapping the entire
human genome, and may even
tually enable scientists to alter
genes as well as clone new organ
isms.
The yeast genome can be used
as a sort of decoder ring for the
human genome: if a code se
quence is found in human DNA
that is also found in yeast,
there's a better chance that the
protein the sequence codes will
be known or can be easily
learned.
One example of a gene-coded
ed protein found in both yeast
and humans is actin, which is
involved in moving muscles, for
humans, and in other "internal

cell business." And mutations of
ras oncogene, a gene found in
yeast DNA, can cause cancer in
humans.
Since yeast has been studied
extensively in the past, human
genome researchers can benefit
from all of the existing work
done on the microorganism.
The yeast genome is also rela
tively simple. According to Bot
stein, the three billion base pairs
in the human genome would cor
respond to about 750 megabytes
of information in a computer. By
contrast, the yeast genome con
tains only 12.5 million base pairs
— just 0.4 percent of the number
in human DNA, about three
megabytes.
Botstein anticipates that the
entire yeast genome sequence
should be known in a few years.
However, without major
improvements in technology, it
would take "100 people about
10,000 years to sequence the
entire human genome."
And while the yeast-sequenc
ing project is aiming at such
technological advancements, it
has not yet developed "any new
revolutionary technique," Bot
stein said.
However, he said researchers
have "achieved a fair amount of
automation in the process.
Instead of doing it tube by tube,

it can be done 96 (tubes) at a
time, for example." Botstein said
his labs have "extensively modi
fied" commercially-bought
equipment "both in hardware
and software."
The method used to deter
mine the DNA code is straight
forward. But once the code is
determined, the remaining task
is "like translating Usbek into
Urdu," Botstein said. Scientists
must still match up those gene
codes with the specific proteins
they code.
The first step in sequencing
DNA is to make enough of it to
work with in the first place. To
do this, scientists exploit the
natural machinery of one-celled
organisms such as bacteria or
animal cells in a culture to syn
thesize huge amounts of the par
ticular DNA.
Long strands of the DNA to be
sequenced are cut into smaller
segments with molecules called
restriction enzymes.
The enzymes cut the strands
at known sites along the DNA
chain.
Each segment is then inserted
into its own plasmid vector, a
circular piece of DNA with spe
cial coding sequences.
These vectors are placed in the
cultures, which make millions of
copies of each DNA segment.

Now, with enough DNA to do
the actual sequencing, the dou
ble-stranded segments are sepa
rated into single strands and
divided into four separate test
tubes.
DNA-synthesizing enzymes
and four bases that make up
the DNA are added to each
tube. More DNA chains of vari
ous lengths are then made
using the single strands as tem
plates.
A different terminator — a

molecule that stops the DNA
synthesis process at a specific
base — is added to each tube.
This ensures that all of the syn
thesized chains in a tube end
with that particular base.
In addition, each test tube
contains fluorescently-labeled
primer molecules which identify
the contents of each tube with a
different color.
Finally, the chains from all
four tubes are separated accord
ing to their length by a tech

nique called gel electrophoresis.
The genetic code can be read
directly from the results of the
electrophoresis by knowing how
long the chain is and which base
is on the end of the chain.
The sequencing process is
repeated using different restric
tion enzymes which cut the DNA
at different sites. Noting the
overlapping bases from the two
experiments, the code of the
entire strand can be pieced
together.
