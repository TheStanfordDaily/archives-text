# Drug combo increases transplant success
## New treatment may reduce rejection rate of bone marrow grafts 
### Julie Sauer Staff writer 
The success rate of bone marrow trans
plants could be increased by a new drug reg
imen which reduces the incidence of graft
versus-host disease.
Medical School Prof. Nelson Chao led a
study of 150 bone marrow recipients to
explore ways to combat this disease, which
causes the body to reject transplanted mar
row.
The disease occurs when immune cells of
the transplanted bone marrow respond to
foreign substances, called antigens, in the
host tissues.
The drug regimen discovered by
researchers at Stanford and at City of New
Hope National Medical Center in Duarte,
Calif., does not cure graft-versus-host dis
ease. Instead, it prevents the disease from
occurring.
Graft-versus-host disease can arise if the
transplanted marrow is incorrectly
matched to the patient's marrow.
Donor tissue often comes from the recip
ient's siblings because they have the same
antigens.
The presence of like antigens in patients
with like genetic codes increases the chance
that family members will be more success
ful donors.
Marrow cells from unrelated donors
often have different antigens that induce an

unfavorable immune response in the trans
planted tissue.
But in cases in which the transplanted
marrow has the same antigens as the host
tissue, it still has a different DNA.
"It's like a tree where the leaves are the
same, but the trunk is very different," Chao
explained.
The immune response only looks at the
"leaves," which are the antigens, even if
there is a difference in their DNA.
After testing for matching antigens, the
donor and recipient cells are mixed. If the
donor and recipient cells are from true sib
lings, there should not be any response. If
the donor is unrelated, the antigens in the
recipient cells will cause a response in the
donor cells.
Presently, there is no effective way to
treat graft-versus-host disease.
"The best way to treat is to prevent it by
matching (marrow tissues) correctly, then
giving the patient drugs to prevent it,"
Chao said.
The new chemical treatment includes the
drugs cyclosporine and methotrexate,
which suppress the immune response, and
the drug prednisone.
In the study, researchers added three
doses of methotrexate to the standard
treatment of cyclosporine and prednisone
to see if the addition would hamper the
development of graft-versus-host disease.
The results showed that 23 percent of

patients receiving only cyclosporine and
prednisone developed the disease. Only 9
percent of those who received the three
drug treatment, which included methotrex
ate, developed the disease.
Chao explained that methotrexate
reduces the incidence of the disease
because the drug suppresses the immune
response.
The drug kills the graft tissue's "T"
immune cells, which induce the immune
response that causes the graft cells to
attack the host tissue. Once the T cells are
dead, the transplanted tissue will accept the
host marrow tissue.
One problem with methotrexate, howev
er, is that it keeps blood count low in a time
when the transplanted bone marrow is very
new.
The low blood count can cause problems
with bleeding, infection, and can also dam
age the patient's liver, kidneys and lungs.
Methotrexate is a chemotherapy drug;
administering it causes oral burns.
The three-drug combination decreased by
more than 50 percent the incidence of graft
versus-host disease when compared to the
standard cyclosporine and prednisone treat
ment.
However, patients who received the
three-drug treatment and did not develop
graft-versus-host disease had similar sur
vival rates as those who remained disease
free on the standard treatment.
