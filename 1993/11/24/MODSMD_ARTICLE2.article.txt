## University applies to retain links to national computer network 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
A Stanford-affiliated computer group
has submitted a proposal to the National
Science Foundation to ensure that the
University can remain connected to the
national computer network that allows
e-mail communication.
At the same time, the University is
participating in the national network's
evolution into a larger "national infor
mation infrastructure," which greatly
increases the amount of digital informa
tion students can obtain.

The University is currently linked di
rectly to Internet, which is part of the
single NSF backbone system that con
nects computers nationwide. The system
is managed by the phone company MCI
and connects to regional networks at 18
different locations across the country.
But in response to pressure from
other phone companies and service
providers who "want a piece of the ac
tion," the NSF plans to replace the single
backbone with a number of "intercon
nected parts operated by separate enti
ties" by April 30, said Bill Yundt, the di
rector of Networking and Communica

tion Systems at the University.
Yundt said that regional networks
across the country have submitted sepa
rate proposals to the NSF "to get connec
tivity {to the new network) which will
give us the same functionality that we
currently have."
Stanford is covered by a proposal
submitted jointly in August by the Bay
Area Regional Research Network (BAR
NET), the California State University
and College Network, and Los NET
