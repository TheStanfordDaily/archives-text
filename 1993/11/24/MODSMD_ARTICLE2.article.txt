## University applies to retain links to national computer network 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
A Stanford-affiliated computer group
has submitted a proposal to the National
Science Foundation to ensure that the
University can remain connected to the
national computer network that allows
e-mail communication.
At the same time, the University is
participating in the national network's
evolution into a larger "national infor
mation infrastructure," which greatly
increases the amount of digital informa
tion students can obtain.

The University is currently linked di
rectly to Internet, which is part of the
single NSF backbone system that con
nects computers nationwide. The system
is managed by the phone company MCI
and connects to regional networks at 18
different locations across the country.
But in response to pressure from
other phone companies and service
providers who "want a piece of the ac
tion," the NSF plans to replace the single
backbone with a number of "intercon
nected parts operated by separate enti
ties" by April 30, said Bill Yundt, the di
rector of Networking and Communica

tion Systems at the University.
Yundt said that regional networks
across the country have submitted sepa
rate proposals to the NSF "to get connec
tivity {to the new network) which will
give us the same functionality that we
currently have."
Stanford is covered by a proposal
submitted jointly in August by the Bay
Area Regional Research Network (BAR
NET), the California State University
and College Network, and Los NET
TOS, which covers the Los Angeles re-
gion. BARNET was created by a
number of Stanford-affiliated
researchers who use the network.
If the proposal is not approved,
the University faces losing con
nections to many of the places
Internet currently links it to.
"In the best case, no one will
know that (the transition) hap
pened," Yundt said. "In the worst
case, we will lose connectivity. We
won't be able to send e-mail to many
of the places we currently can."
In the meantime, the network
is also evolving into a greater
"superhighway" of information.
In the future, Yundt said, the
public will be able to retrieve
everything from the Supreme
Court's judicial record to a
description of "how to weave a
basket from pine needles"
through their computers.
Internet will also be made
accessible to a greater number of
users with the installation of
more computers and networks in
public places such as libraries,
high schools and county offices.
Although the evolution is

already in progress, the rate of
new developments will depend on
the amount of investment, since
the expansion will be largely
funded through private corpora
tions, Yundt said, adding that the
speed of technological progress
will also have an influence.
As an example, Yundt cited a
riecent announcement by Pacific
Bell to invest $15 billion in devel
oping the system in California.
He said that Stanford will not
need to overhaul of its computer
equipment in the near future.
"We have a long way to go
before [our infrastructure) runs
out of steam. We're upgrading
continuously," he said, adding
that the University is also experi
menting with the kind of new
technology that will underlie the
larger information infrastructure
in the future.
The rate at which Stanford can
invest in any new equipment and
technology that may be necessary
is a question of priorities and
resource allocation, Yundt said.
"The president, provost and
vice provost of libraries and infor
mation resources are all extremely
supportive of us, but this institu
tion is faced with serious financial
constraints," he said.
