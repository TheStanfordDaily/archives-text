# Multiple sclerosis relapses may be treatable
## 
### Lisa Goldman Staff writer 
Neurologists have long sus
pected that infectious diseases
can induce relapses in multiple
sclerosis, a condition in which
the body attacks its own nerve
coating and impairs nerve func
tion.
Now for the first time,
researchers at the School of
Medicine have shown that a bac
terial product in mice can induce
relapses in a disease similar to
multiple sclerosis.
This research may help sci
entists to prevent bacterial
infections from causing relapses
in multiple sclerosis patients,
and may ultimately lead to bet
ter control over the debilitating
disease.
The research was directed
under the labs of Neurology
Prof. Lawrence Steinman and
Immunology and Rheumatology
Prof. C. Garrison Fathman, but
was predominantly carried out
by postdoctoral fellows Stefan
Brocke and Amitabh Gaur.
Scientists first began working
with a bacterial product, also
called a superantigen, known as
staphylococcal enterotoxin B
(SEB) in an attempt to combat
autoimmune diseases, which
cause the immune system to
attack itself.
These diseases strike when
protective "T" immune cells in
the immune system react to
native substances in the body as

if they were foreign, attacking
them and causing damage.
Researchers injected the mice
with SEB after exposing them to
a protein known as myelin basic
protein, which can cause an
autoimmune disease known as
experimental autoimmune en
cephalomyelitis (EAE).

Researchers con
cluded that super
antigens could inten
sify a pre-existing
autoimmune disease
such as multiple
sclerosis.

The superantigen triggers
the growth of cells involved in
the disease's harmful autoim
mune response. These cells
eventually die off or become
inactive.
Although this attempt to
combat autoimmune disease
resulting from exposure to the
protein was moderately success
ful, the real breakthrough came
when researchers decided to
view superantigens in a differ
ent way.
Instead of injecting the
superantigen as a therapeutic
agent, they examined its effects
on two groups of mice which
had been exposed to myelin

basic protein.
One group of mice involved
those in remission after display
ing clinical signs of the disease.
The second group included
mice which, unlike the first,
had never shown overt signs of
EAE.
Scientists discovered that the
superantigen SEB strongly
exacerbated EAE symptoms in
both groups of mice because it
was able to bind to the receptors
of T cells responsible for the
disease, activating those cells.
Researchers concluded that
superantigens could intensify a
pre-existing autoimmune dis
ease such as multiple sclerosis.
They also realized that the tim
ing of SEB intervention was
crucial, Gaur said.
"The effect of superantigens
is dependent on the timing —
we can protect against disease if
they are given before infection.
But that's a very experimental
situation," Brocke explained.
"It is not relevant to humans
because we must know that
they already have multiple scle
rosis."
However, because people do
possess autoreactive T cells, the
findn js suggest that superanti
gens produced by bacterial
infections such as food poison
ing and toxic shock syndrome
could trigger symptoms in indi
viduals who were already
exposed to a disease.
This is where the genetic fac
tor comes in, Gaur noted. Indi

viduals with a genetic predispo
sition toward certain diseases
would be at greater risk.
However, bacterial super
antigens will not cause autoim
mune disease by themselves.
People with a genetic predispo
sition "must have an autoim
mune trigger event" to display
disease symptoms after bacteri
al infections, Fathman said.
The next step for scientists is
to identify chemicals within the
superantigen that can block its
interaction with the T cells.
They have started lab tests with
human cells and plan to test
their findings on multiple-scle
rosis patients as well.
"The aim is to find certain
compounds, either synthetic
peptides or antibodies, which
can block the activation of
autoreactive disease-mediating
lymphocytes during multiple
sclerosis relapses," Blocke said.
However, researchers will
need to examine all possible
bacterial superantigens which
will activate T cells.
"That's the trouble," Gaur
cautioned. "In most cases, you
don't know a specific antigen to
work with."
"It's a tremendous amount of
work," Brocke admitted.
Nevertheless, researchers
are hopeful. "I think very much
that we will find the potential
superantigens which play a role
in multiple sclerosis," Brocke
predicted. "We have a research
program for the next 10 years."

al infections, Fathman said.
The next step for scientists is
to identify chemicals within the
superantigen that can block its
interaction with the T cells.
They have started lab tests with
human cells and plan to test
their findings on multiple-scle
rosis patients as well.
"The aim is to find certain
compounds, either synthetic
peptides or antibodies, which
can block the activation of
autoreactive disease-mediating
lymphocytes during multiple
sclerosis relapses," Blocke said.
However, researchers will
need to examine all possible
bacterial superantigens which
will activate T cells.
"That's the trouble," Gaur
cautioned. "In most cases, you
don't know a specific antigen to
work with."
"It's a tremendous amount of
work," Brocke admitted.
Nevertheless, researchers
are hopeful. "I think very much
that we will find the potential
superantigens which play a role
in multiple sclerosis," Brocke
predicted. "We have a research
program for the next 10 years."
Neurologists have long sus
pected that infectious diseases
can induce relapses in multiple
sclerosis, a condition in which
the body attacks its own nerve
coating and impairs nerve func
tion.
Now for the first time,
researchers at the School of
Medicine have shown that a bac
terial product in mice can induce
relapses in a disease similar to
multiple sclerosis.
This research may help sci
entists to prevent bacterial
infections from causing relapses
in multiple sclerosis patients,
and may ultimately lead to bet
ter control over the debilitating
disease.
The research was directed
under the labs of Neurology
Prof. Lawrence Steinman and
Immunology and Rheumatology
Prof. C. Garrison Fathman, but
was predominantly carried out
by postdoctoral fellows Stefan
Brocke and Amitabh Gaur.
Scientists first began working
with a bacterial product, also
called a superantigen, known as
staphylococcal enterotoxin B
(SEB) in an attempt to combat
autoimmune diseases, which
cause the immune system to
attack itself.
These diseases strike when
protective "T" immune cells in
the immune system react to
native substances in the body as

if they were foreign, attacking
them and causing damage.
Researchers injected the mice
with SEB after exposing them to
a protein known as myelin basic
protein, which can cause an
autoimmune disease known as
experimental autoimmune en
cephalomyelitis (EAE).

Researchers con
cluded that super
antigens could inten
sify a pre-existing
autoimmune disease
such as multiple
sclerosis.

The superantigen triggers
the growth of cells involved in
the disease's harmful autoim
mune response. These cells
eventually die off or become
inactive.
Although this attempt to
combat autoimmune disease
resulting from exposure to the
protein was moderately success
ful, the real breakthrough came
when researchers decided to
view superantigens in a differ
ent way.
Instead of injecting the
superantigen as a therapeutic
agent, they examined its effects
on two groups of mice which
had been exposed to myelin

basic protein.
One group of mice involved
those in remission after display
ing clinical signs of the disease.
The second group included
mice which, unlike the first,
had never shown overt signs of
EAE.
Scientists discovered that the
superantigen SEB strongly
exacerbated EAE symptoms in
both groups of mice because it
was able to bind to the receptors
of T cells responsible for the
disease, activating those cells.
Researchers concluded that
superantigens could intensify a
pre-existing autoimmune dis
ease such as multiple sclerosis.
They also realized that the tim
ing of SEB intervention was
crucial, Gaur said.
"The effect of superantigens
is dependent on the timing —
we can protect against disease if
they are given before infection.
But that's a very experimental
situation," Brocke explained.
"It is not relevant to humans
because we must know that
they already have multiple scle
rosis."
However, because people do
possess autoreactive T cells, the
findn js suggest that superanti
gens produced by bacterial
infections such as food poison
ing and toxic shock syndrome
could trigger symptoms in indi
viduals who were already
exposed to a disease.
This is where the genetic fac
tor comes in, Gaur noted. Indi

viduals with a genetic predispo
sition toward certain diseases
would be at greater risk.
However, bacterial super
antigens will not cause autoim
mune disease by themselves.
People with a genetic predispo
sition "must have an autoim
mune trigger event" to display
disease symptoms after bacteri
al infections, Fathman said.
The next step for scientists is
to identify chemicals within the
superantigen that can block its
interaction with the T cells.
They have started lab tests with
human cells and plan to test
their findings on multiple-scle
rosis patients as well.
