Q: Why do I get morning
wood'
— Jump down, turn around,
pick a head of lettuce
A: For those of you who
are wondering just exact
ly what percentage of the

questions I an
swer in this
humble space
every week ha
ve some kind of
sexual connota
tion, the an
swer is: "All of
them."
Complaints?
Remember that
I am at the

mercy of my readers. You want to
see a question an-swered in this
space, you send it to me.
1 should probably define the
key term in this week's ques
tion. More than half the read
ers will have never experienced
the delightful phenomenon so
poetically described above as
"morning wood." The term,
synonymous with "bat" and
"morning glory," refers to the
common male experience of
waking up with an erection.
To understand why this hap
pens so frequently, we'll have
to take a close look at the neu
rological underpinnings of erec
tion itself.
The nervous systems of
higher animals (including the
msyority of Stanford students)
are divided into two main
branches: the voluntary, and
the involuntary or autonomic.
The autonomic nervous sys
tem (ANS) takes care of things
that you don't want to have to
think about all the time: heart
beat, breathing, digestion, etc.
The ANS is itself divided into
two branches: the parasympa
thetic (PNS) and sympathetic
(SNS).
The SNS controls the so
called "fight-or-flight" re
sponse: When an animal is sur
prised or threatened, certain
physical changes will take place
which prepare said beast for
either combat or hasty retreat.
The PNS dominates over
more peaceful activities: eating,
digesting, rest and so forth.
Back to male sexual respons
es: In the early stages of sexual
arousal, a man's penis becomes
engorged with blood and grows
erect. If you didn't know this
already, I think you should stop

reading and call your parents 1-
800-COLLECT™.
Since a penis has no brain of
its own (owner's behavior
notwithstanding), it must be
told to behave in this expansive
manner by signals from the
brain. These signals are trans
mitted via neurons of the PNS.
As the sexual encounter pro
gresses and the man grows clos
er to orgasm, the SNS gradual
ly takes over. At the peak of

SNS control,
he enters the
blessed state
of high physi
cal and emo
tional pitch
known as
orgasm. His
heart rate
skyrockets,
his skin
flushes, and

he ejaculates. Ahhhhhh. . . .
Because the PNS and SNS
have such well- de-fined roles in
sex (dominating erection and ejac
ulation, respectively) certain witty
behavioral psychologists have
referred to them as the "point"
and "shoot" systems. Heh.
PNS control over erection
explains the phenomenon of
morning glory: During sleep, a
man is very deeply relaxed, and
the parasympathetic nervous
system is active. By simple syllo
gism (of the kind that usually
doesn't work in biology, but does
in this case), since PNS control
results in erection, and the PNS
is active during relaxation in gen
eral and sleep in particular, men
oflen wake up with erections.
An interesting corollary of the
little picture I've painted is this:
The SNS, which dominates dur
ing ejaculation, is also associated
with feelings of nervousness or
trepidation. Men who are ner
vous or insecure about sex oflen
have inappropriate levels of SNS
activity during the blessed event.
If the SNS takes over from the
PNS too soon, premature ejacu
lation can result.
A final note: Although
women do not have penises
(penii?), and cannot have morn
ing erections, their sexual
arousal is also governed by the
PNS. Ergo, they are just as like
ly to be mildly aroused when
they awaken as men.
Heck, it makes you want to
keep a bottle of Scope™ under
the bed.
