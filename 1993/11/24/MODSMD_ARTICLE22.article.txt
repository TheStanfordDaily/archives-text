## Cardinal spikers break the Broncos 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
While it may not have ended
with fireworks, or even sparks, the
Stanford women's volleyball team
managed to close out its regular
season with a win.
Despite a somewhat lackluster
performance, the Cardinal downed
No. 22 Santa Clara (22-9, 12-2 in
the West Coast Conference) in
three games last night by a score of
15-12, 15-2, 15-9.
Although Stanford improved to
21-6 overall and 13-5 in the Pacific
10 Conference, coach Don Shaw
expressed disappointment over the
Cardinal's relatively weak showing
at Maples Pavilion.
"It was one of those matches
that I really hate," Shaw said. "I
knew we were in for a let-down but
there was nothing that I could real
ly do about it. I had a feeling we
weren't going to be ready to play
tonight."
The Cardinal entered last
night's match attempting to recov
er from a narrow defeat at the
hands of No. 1 UCLA last Friday.
In contast to the crispness which
characterized last weekend's play,
Stanford displayed a rather slug
gish effort last night.
"Matches like that are pretty
tough," said sophomore Cary Wen
dell. "Coming out, neither team
had a lot of outside motivation for
winning this game. It was a transi
tion match before the NCAAs."
While Stanford was able to stay
in front of Santa Clara for the first
half of game one, it quickly saw its
lead evaporate as the Bronco
defense easily answered the Cardi
nal attack.
"They played real good de

fense," Shaw said. "That's what is
going to keep them in every match
they play, no matter how good the
other team is — they dig a lot of
balls and keep the ball in play and
make you earn all your points."
Boosted by this impressive dig
ging effort, Santa Clara clawed its

way back into the contest to tie the
score at 12-12 before sophomore
Marnie Triefenbach revived Stan
ford with two unanswered smash
es. The Cardinal finally established
itself at the net, blocking a Bronco
quick set to secure game one.
"They were with us the whole

way in the first game," Wendell
said. "It's hard to stay up at a cer
tain level when you're not up in
the beginning. We were able to
stick it out though to pull out the
win."
