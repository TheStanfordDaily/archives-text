## Cardinal spikers break the Broncos 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
While it may not have ended
with fireworks, or even sparks, the
Stanford women's volleyball team
managed to close out its regular
season with a win.
Despite a somewhat lackluster
performance, the Cardinal downed
No. 22 Santa Clara (22-9, 12-2 in
the West Coast Conference) in
three games last night by a score of
15-12, 15-2, 15-9.
Although Stanford improved to
21-6 overall and 13-5 in the Pacific
10 Conference, coach Don Shaw
expressed disappointment over the
Cardinal's relatively weak showing
at Maples Pavilion.
"It was one of those matches
that I really hate," Shaw said. "I
knew we were in for a let-down but
there was nothing that I could real
ly do about it. I had a feeling we
weren't going to be ready to play
tonight."
The Cardinal entered last
night's match attempting to recov
er from a narrow defeat at the
hands of No. 1 UCLA last Friday.
In contast to the crispness which
characterized last weekend's play,
Stanford displayed a rather slug
gish effort last night.
"Matches like that are pretty
tough," said sophomore Cary Wen
dell. "Coming out, neither team
had a lot of outside motivation for
winning this game. It was a transi
tion match before the NCAAs."
While Stanford was able to stay
in front of Santa Clara for the first
half of game one, it quickly saw its
lead evaporate as the Bronco
defense easily answered the Cardi
nal attack.
"They played real good de

fense," Shaw said. "That's what is
going to keep them in every match
they play, no matter how good the
other team is — they dig a lot of
balls and keep the ball in play and
make you earn all your points."
Boosted by this impressive dig
ging effort, Santa Clara clawed its

way back into the contest to tie the
score at 12-12 before sophomore
Marnie Triefenbach revived Stan
ford with two unanswered smash
es. The Cardinal finally established
itself at the net, blocking a Bronco
quick set to secure game one.
"They were with us the whole

way in the first game," Wendell
said. "It's hard to stay up at a cer
tain level when you're not up in
the beginning. We were able to
stick it out though to pull out the
win."

Junior tri-captain Anne Wicks dashes for one of her match-high 12 digs, saving the ball from the Maples
Pavilion parquet.
The Stanford offense gained
momentum in the second contest,
as the Cardinal pulled out of a 2-2
tie to score 13 unanswered points.
Wendell's right-side smash pro
vided the power Stanford lacked
in game one, as Triefenbach
added to the drive with two ser
vice aces.
The Cardinal got off to another
sluggish start in game three and
quickly fell behind 0-5. Plagued by
an ineffective blocking effort, Stan
ford finally put itself on the board
once its net game improved. Fresh
man Eileen Murfee's middle attack
boosted the Cardinal, as it man
aged a 7-7 tie before a Wendell-
Wicks stuff pulled Stanford ahead.
Sophomore Wendy Hromadka
then slammed down two left-side
kills to secure the match for the
Cardinal.
Both Wendell and Triefenbach
registered 11 kills apiece while
Wendell added 12 digs to lead the
Cardinal defense. Junior tri-cap
tain Anne Wicks also contributed
12 digs and senior setter Piper
Hahn orchestrated the Stanford

offense with 28 sets.
While the final score indicated
an easy Cardinal victory, Stanford
played down to the level of its oppo
nent instead of maintaining the
high-caliber volleyball which mark
ed the USC and UCLA matches,
according to Shaw.
"We just played well enough to
win," Shaw said. "These things can
happen, I'm not going to get all
upset about it or bent out of shape
— we just had to get through it and
not get anyone hurt. Now we'll
have a nice Thanksgiving and get
ourselves ready to play for the
NCAAs."
Stanford awaits the NCAA
Tournament pairings, which will
be announced Sunday night. By
virtue of its No. 4 ranking in the
Western Region, the Cardinal will
most likey recieve a first-round
bye; in which case it would make
its tournament debut in a second
round match on Dec. 4.
"We're now entering the phase
of the season that we play for and
prepare for," Shaw said. "It's just a
case of trying to make sure we're
playing our best volleyball at the
right time, and I think we've been
playing our best this past month —
I can't ask for a whole lot more."

way in the first game," Wendell
said. "It's hard to stay up at a cer
tain level when you're not up in
the beginning. We were able to
stick it out though to pull out the
win."

Junior tri-captain Anne Wicks dashes for one of her match-high 12 digs, saving the ball from the Maples
Pavilion parquet.
The Stanford offense gained
momentum in the second contest,
as the Cardinal pulled out of a 2-2
tie to score 13 unanswered points.
Wendell's right-side smash pro
vided the power Stanford lacked
in game one, as Triefenbach
added to the drive with two ser
vice aces.
The Cardinal got off to another
sluggish start in game three and
quickly fell behind 0-5. Plagued by
an ineffective blocking effort, Stan
ford finally put itself on the board
once its net game improved. Fresh
man Eileen Murfee's middle attack
boosted the Cardinal, as it man
aged a 7-7 tie before a Wendell-
Wicks stuff pulled Stanford ahead.
Sophomore Wendy Hromadka
then slammed down two left-side
kills to secure the match for the
Cardinal.
Both Wendell and Triefenbach
registered 11 kills apiece while
Wendell added 12 digs to lead the
Cardinal defense. Junior tri-cap
tain Anne Wicks also contributed
12 digs and senior setter Piper
Hahn orchestrated the Stanford

offense with 28 sets.
While the final score indicated
an easy Cardinal victory, Stanford
played down to the level of its oppo
nent instead of maintaining the
high-caliber volleyball which mark
ed the USC and UCLA matches,
according to Shaw.
"We just played well enough to
win," Shaw said. "These things can
happen, I'm not going to get all
upset about it or bent out of shape
— we just had to get through it and
not get anyone hurt. Now we'll
have a nice Thanksgiving and get
ourselves ready to play for the
NCAAs."
Stanford awaits the NCAA
Tournament pairings, which will
be announced Sunday night. By
virtue of its No. 4 ranking in the
Western Region, the Cardinal will
most likey recieve a first-round
bye; in which case it would make
its tournament debut in a second
round match on Dec. 4.
"We're now entering the phase
of the season that we play for and
prepare for," Shaw said. "It's just a
case of trying to make sure we're
playing our best volleyball at the
right time, and I think we've been
playing our best this past month —
I can't ask for a whole lot more."
While it may not have ended
with fireworks, or even sparks, the
Stanford women's volleyball team
managed to close out its regular
season with a win.
Despite a somewhat lackluster
performance, the Cardinal downed
No. 22 Santa Clara (22-9, 12-2 in
the West Coast Conference) in
three games last night by a score of
15-12, 15-2, 15-9.
Although Stanford improved to
21-6 overall and 13-5 in the Pacific
10 Conference, coach Don Shaw
expressed disappointment over the
Cardinal's relatively weak showing
at Maples Pavilion.
"It was one of those matches
that I really hate," Shaw said. "I
knew we were in for a let-down but
there was nothing that I could real
ly do about it. I had a feeling we
weren't going to be ready to play
tonight."
The Cardinal entered last
night's match attempting to recov
er from a narrow defeat at the
hands of No. 1 UCLA last Friday.
In contast to the crispness which
characterized last weekend's play,
Stanford displayed a rather slug
gish effort last night.
"Matches like that are pretty
tough," said sophomore Cary Wen
dell. "Coming out, neither team
had a lot of outside motivation for
winning this game. It was a transi
tion match before the NCAAs."
While Stanford was able to stay
in front of Santa Clara for the first
half of game one, it quickly saw its
lead evaporate as the Bronco
defense easily answered the Cardi
nal attack.
"They played real good de

fense," Shaw said. "That's what is
going to keep them in every match
they play, no matter how good the
other team is — they dig a lot of
balls and keep the ball in play and
make you earn all your points."
Boosted by this impressive dig
ging effort, Santa Clara clawed its

way back into the contest to tie the
score at 12-12 before sophomore
Marnie Triefenbach revived Stan
ford with two unanswered smash
es. The Cardinal finally established
itself at the net, blocking a Bronco
quick set to secure game one.
"They were with us the whole

way in the first game," Wendell
said. "It's hard to stay up at a cer
tain level when you're not up in
the beginning. We were able to
stick it out though to pull out the
win."
