# They're off to the races
## Hoopsters kick off season at Fry's Invite 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
Stanford men's basketball coach Mike Mont
gomery has a suggestion for students stuck on
campus this Thanksgiving weekend with noth
ing to do — attend the Fry's Invitational.
In addition to getting an early look at the
revitalized team, the crowd will get a chance to
see a halftime performance by the Bud Light
Daredevils — the most unique slam dunk act in
the country.
The Cardinal opens its regular season Fri
day night at 6:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion
against Cal State-Northridge. San Jose State
and Gonzaga will play at about 8:30 p.m., and
the two winners and two losers will square off
Saturday night.
"These games are really important," Mont
gomery said yesterday. "These are teams we
should compete with, and we need to get
friends back.
"We have lost some (fans), and it is impor
tant that we get off to a good start . . . because
they have to be brought back out to watch us,"
he said.
Acknowledging that the weekend's games
are "not a tournament that will raise any hack
les across the nation," Montgomery empha

sized that the team is "looking for some
improvement and a chance to win."
"For some of these kids, it has been a while
since a win. . . . We are playing some West
Coast teams that are very well coached, and
frankly any of which can beat us," Mont
gomery said.

The Invite will feature a per
formance by the Bud Light
Daredevils — the most unique
slam dunk act in America.

In Northridge, the Cardinal will face a team
that was 10-17 last year and begins only its
fourth season in Division I. But with a starting
lineup of three seniors and two juniors, Mont
gomery said the experienced Matadors are sure
to be a competitive first opponent.
The potential Saturday-night opponent,
either Gonzaga or San Jose State, is likely to be
a bit more challenging for Stanford.
Gonzaga was 19-9 last season on its way to a
second-place finish in the West Coast Confer
ence, and San Jose State actually defeated the

Cardinal 56-52 last year.
But Stanford has looked impressive in its two
easy exhibition wins, and Montgomery said he
has been pleased by the efforts of many of his
players.
"We have had some very good performances
out of certain people, perhaps indicating that we
have a nucleus of seven or eight people," he said.
"But the two exhibitions were really just glori
fied scrimmages."
Montgomery confirmed that four of the
team's five starters are established for now.
Center Jim Morgan, freshman point guard
Brevin Knight and forwards Brent Williams and
Andy Poppink have locked up starting roles.
Shooting guards Dion Cross and David Har
bour each started one of the two exhibition
games, and Montgomery said both have played
well enough to be starters.
The other two players who will be part of the
regular rotation are forward Darren Allaway
and point guard Frank Harris, Montgomery
said.
Bart Lammersen and Todd Manley will also
play in some spots to provide depth at center
and power forward. "As I see it, you've got a
three-man rotation among the big men, but I
would like to get a four- or five-way rotation
eventually," Montgomery said.
