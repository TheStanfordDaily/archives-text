# False alarm
## Rumor of Walsh's retirement denied 
### David Schwartz Howard Libit Senior staff writers 
Bill Walsh remains the head
football coach at Stanford Uni
versity — at least for now.

Sources within the Depart
ment of Athletics and the foot
ball team denied a published
report yesterday that Walsh, 62,
was contemplating retirement
due to health reasons.
The story in yesterday after
noon's San Francisco Examiner
speculated that Walsh, dis
traught after suffering only his
fourth losing season in 14 years
as a football coach in both the
college and professional ranks,
is considering stepping down
due to the stain of defeat and
poor health conditions. Stanford
ended its season on Saturday
with a 46-17 loss to California in
the 96th Big Game, and finished
with a season record of 4-7.
In the story, titled "Walsh
may not return — Stanford
coach isn't feeling well, will lis
ten to doctors," Walsh was quot
ed as saying he was tired of the
"wear and tear" of the losing
season. But he also said that the
"only reason I wouldn't be back
is if a doctor told me he didn't

recommend it."
Gary Migdol, the senior
Sports Information director,
said last night that "we fully
expect coach Walsh to be back
next year."
"As far we we're concerned,
he is in excellent health," Mig
dol said. He expected Walsh
back in the office on Monday
after the holiday weekend.
A player on the Cardinal
squad, who requested anonymi
ty, said that Walsh was referring
to being weary after this particu
lar season, but has never made
any sign to the team that he
might not be back next season.
Further, an Athletics Depart
ment official said that Walsh
was not disenchanted with
Stanford or with coaching and
would only retire from his posi
tion if his doctors told him it
would not be in his best health
interests to continue coaching.
The rumors of Walsh's possi
ble departure, however, could
have an adverse affect on
recruiting. Other schools that
are competing with Stanford for
top prospects might use the per
ceived uncertainty in the Cardi
nal coaching ranks to gain lever
age in signing recruits to their
institutions.
