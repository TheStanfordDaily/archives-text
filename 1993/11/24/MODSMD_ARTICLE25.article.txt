# Women's basketball ready for a title run

At first glance, the 1992-93 Car
dinal women's basketball season,
bookended by a preseason No. 1
ranking and an early postseason
exit, appears to be long ago and far
away.
Could it have been just eight
months ago that Stanford fixtures
Val Whiting, Molly Goodenbour,
Chris MacMurdo and Angela Tay
lor played their final game before
the Maples Pavilion crowd? Just
two-thirds of a year since the Car
dinal's untimely elimination in the
NCAA Tournament's round of 16
ended a frustrating season that,
despite a 26-6 overall record and a
fifth consecutive Pacific 10 Con
ference title, never matched the
team's tremendous expectations?
Yes, that was last March, and
while much has changed in the
world of Stanford women's hoops,
Stanford's hopes for 1993-94 are
similar to last season's expecta
tions.
"We come to practice, and there
are five Pac-10 and two national
championship banners hanging

over our heads, so those are expec
tations we've come to expect," said
head coach Tara VanDerveer.
Armed with six returning roster
members, a No. 5 preseason rank
ing and the knowledge that it could
play at home in four postseason
games (the NCAA Western Region
al will be held at Maples), the Car
dinal has reloaded five new faces
into its arsenal and will attempt to
duplicate its national title runs of
1990 and 1992.
Stanford's mission begins
tonight at Maples with an exhibi
tion tune-up against the Aus
tralian Institute of Sport, but the
schedule begins in earnest on Sat
urday when the Cardinal travels to
Lubbock to take on No. 6 Texas
Tech, the defending NCAA cham
pion, before a national television
audience.
"Our players will be baptized bv
fire," Vanderveer said of the trip.
Yet Saturday's marquee match
up will not be the first trip into the
spotlight for potential starters
