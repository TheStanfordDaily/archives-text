# Water polo shooting for NCAA crown
## Cardinal set to face Midshipmen of Navy in first round 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
When the NCAA Championship
Tournament starts on Friday, the
scramble for No. 1 will begin. The Stan
ford water polo team grabbed the top
spot in the national polls early in the
year and hasn't relinquished it since. It
doesn't plan to be unseated now.
The Cardinal, named the top seed by
virtue of its 21-6 regular season record,
heads the eight-team competition in
Long Beach, Calif. Automatic bids were
given to the winners of the Eastern
Water Polo Association (Massachu
setts), the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration (California) and the Western
Water Polo Association (UC-San Diego).
The remainder of the field was selected
at large.
Stanford opens play at noon on Fri
day against eighth-seeded Navy. Other
first-round matchups include No. 2 Cal
vs. No. 7 Massachusetts, No. 3 USC vs.
No. 6 UCSD and No. 4 UC-Irvine vs. No.
5 Pacific.
The Cardinal will be led defensively
by senior All-American Larry Bercutt,
who has made 211 saves this year. At
the offensive end of the pool, Stanford
will feature a balanced attack. Sopho
more Jeremy Laster leads the team with
46 goals, followed by Antonio Busquets
(41), Wolf Wigo (38), Chris Wallin (37)
and Brian Wallin (29).
Navy, receivers of the second manda
tory bid to a team from the Eastern
region, will face Stanford for the first
time this season. The Midshipmen fin
ished third at the Eastern Champi
onships and were invited largely because

of their impressive 20-5 record.
"They don't have one superstar, but
they play very well as a team," said
junior driver Wigo. "They are well
coached. They play smart water polo and
are well-disciplined. That's how they
win games."
"It will be tough for them mentally to
come and play the No. 1 team in the
nation," said Cardinal assistant coach
Ben Quittner. "I'm sure they'll play
their best."
Navy is led by junior Doug Munz (68
goals, 33 assists) and senior Brian
Wineke (76 goals). Team captain John
McCuHough has tallied 166 saves in the
goal for the Middies.
Three-time defending national cham
pion Cal (19-8) will be looking for an
unprecedented fourth consecutive
NCAA trophy. After a rocky start, the
Bears proved they are still contenders by
winning the MPSF Tournament two
weeks ago, and topping No. 1 Stanford
last week in the Big Splash, 10-9.
Cal's offensive attack is led by three
seniors who have yet to lose a match at
the NCAA tournament — All-American
holeman Troy Barnhart (64 goals),
Gavin Arroyo (45) and Tony Barnes
(40). Junior Sean Nolan, formerly of
Palo Alto High School, has 200 saves for
the year.
The Golden Bears will play Mas
sachusetts Friday in their first meeting
of the season. The Minutemen (20-4) are
making their first appearance at the
NCAAs and are the top team from the
East after winning the Eastern Confer
ence Tournament by defeating Ar
kansas, Navy and Bucknell.
Much of the Minutemen's success can

be attributed to the play of two Puerto
Rican Junior National Team members
— holeman Tasan Engin (56 goals, 23
assists) and driver Javier Gonzales (58
goals).
Both were named, along with goalie
Alex Mujica, to the First-Team All-East.
USC will be in the thick of the title
hunt after spending the majority of the
season ranked No. 2 in the nation. The
Trojans (17-8) finished second at both
the USC Tournament in September and
at the MSPF Tourney.
USC is led on offense by Jose Santia
go (42 goals) and in the goal by Andrew
Tinseth.
Facing the Trojans in first-round
action will be UCSD. The Tritons
received an automatic bid to the NCAAs
by winning the Western Water Polo
Association Tournament last week.
UCSD defeated Air Force 15-13 in the
finals to advance to the National Cham
pionships.
Junior Michael Nalu has been a scor
ing force all year for the Tritons, racking
up 94 goals on the year. George Hegarty,
also a junior, has 41 goals.
In what could be the most exciting of
the opening-round matchups, UCI faces
UOP. The Tigers (17-8) are making
their first appearance at the NCAA
Championships.
Coach John Tanner, a former All-
American at Stanford, led UOP to as
high as No. 3 in the national rankings.
The Tigers are led by seniors Todd Hos
mer, Todd Hinders and goaltender Tom
Cheli.
UCI is led by its seniors — Rail

eration (California) and the Western
Water Polo Association (UC-San Diego).
The remainder of the field was selected
at large.
Stanford opens play at noon on Fri
day against eighth-seeded Navy. Other
first-round matchups include No. 2 Cal
vs. No. 7 Massachusetts, No. 3 USC vs.
No. 6 UCSD and No. 4 UC-Irvine vs. No.
5 Pacific.
The Cardinal will be led defensively
by senior All-American Larry Bercutt,
who has made 211 saves this year. At
the offensive end of the pool, Stanford
will feature a balanced attack. Sopho
more Jeremy Laster leads the team with
46 goals, followed by Antonio Busquets
(41), Wolf Wigo (38), Chris Wallin (37)
and Brian Wallin (29).
Navy, receivers of the second manda
tory bid to a team from the Eastern
region, will face Stanford for the first
time this season. The Midshipmen fin
ished third at the Eastern Champi
onships and were invited largely because

of their impressive 20-5 record.
"They don't have one superstar, but
they play very well as a team," said
junior driver Wigo. "They are well
coached. They play smart water polo and
are well-disciplined. That's how they
win games."
"It will be tough for them mentally to
come and play the No. 1 team in the
nation," said Cardinal assistant coach
Ben Quittner. "I'm sure they'll play
their best."
Navy is led by junior Doug Munz (68
goals, 33 assists) and senior Brian
Wineke (76 goals). Team captain John
McCuHough has tallied 166 saves in the
goal for the Middies.
Three-time defending national cham
pion Cal (19-8) will be looking for an
unprecedented fourth consecutive
NCAA trophy. After a rocky start, the
Bears proved they are still contenders by
winning the MPSF Tournament two
weeks ago, and topping No. 1 Stanford
last week in the Big Splash, 10-9.
Cal's offensive attack is led by three
seniors who have yet to lose a match at
the NCAA tournament — All-American
holeman Troy Barnhart (64 goals),
Gavin Arroyo (45) and Tony Barnes
(40). Junior Sean Nolan, formerly of
Palo Alto High School, has 200 saves for
the year.
The Golden Bears will play Mas
sachusetts Friday in their first meeting
of the season. The Minutemen (20-4) are
making their first appearance at the
NCAAs and are the top team from the
East after winning the Eastern Confer
ence Tournament by defeating Ar
kansas, Navy and Bucknell.
Much of the Minutemen's success can

be attributed to the play of two Puerto
Rican Junior National Team members
— holeman Tasan Engin (56 goals, 23
assists) and driver Javier Gonzales (58
goals).
Both were named, along with goalie
Alex Mujica, to the First-Team All-East.
USC will be in the thick of the title
hunt after spending the majority of the
season ranked No. 2 in the nation. The
Trojans (17-8) finished second at both
the USC Tournament in September and
at the MSPF Tourney.
USC is led on offense by Jose Santia
go (42 goals) and in the goal by Andrew
Tinseth.
Facing the Trojans in first-round
action will be UCSD. The Tritons
received an automatic bid to the NCAAs
by winning the Western Water Polo
Association Tournament last week.
UCSD defeated Air Force 15-13 in the
finals to advance to the National Cham
pionships.
Junior Michael Nalu has been a scor
ing force all year for the Tritons, racking
up 94 goals on the year. George Hegarty,
also a junior, has 41 goals.
In what could be the most exciting of
the opening-round matchups, UCI faces
UOP. The Tigers (17-8) are making
their first appearance at the NCAA
Championships.
Coach John Tanner, a former All-
American at Stanford, led UOP to as
high as No. 3 in the national rankings.
The Tigers are led by seniors Todd Hos
mer, Todd Hinders and goaltender Tom
Cheli.
UCI is led by its seniors — Rail

Despite this formidable field,

Stanford coach Dante Dettamanti
(407-95-6 in 16 years at Stanford)
is positive heading into NCAAs.
"I feel there are five teams that
have a legitimate chance at win

If we play well and get a couple of
breaks, we have a chance to win."
Dettamanti also noted that
every player on his current team

was part of Stanford's improbable
rally from six goals down in last
year's final against Cal.
"That experience should help
us," he said. "This team really
knows how to come back."
But before the members of the
Stanford water polo team come
back to the Farm, they plan to
throw quite a pool party in Long
Beach.
When the NCAA Championship
Tournament starts on Friday, the
scramble for No. 1 will begin. The Stan
ford water polo team grabbed the top
spot in the national polls early in the
year and hasn't relinquished it since. It
doesn't plan to be unseated now.
The Cardinal, named the top seed by
virtue of its 21-6 regular season record,
heads the eight-team competition in
