# Prof, updates voucher proposal
## Public school improvement added to Moe's initiative 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Political Science Prof. Terry
Moe — a vocal education-reform
advocate — has submitted a
proposition to improve public
schools for possible placement on
next November's ballot.
The nine-page proposal, which
Moe and four others formally sub
mitted to the state attorney gener
al's office Thursday, is actually an
amended version of a school
voucher initiative Moe introduced
on Nov. 3, the day after California
voters rejected Proposition 174,
another voucher initiative.
The updated version of the ini
tiative, which would amend Arti
cle IX of the California Constitu

tion, includes two new provisions
that would give much more con
trol to individual public schools
and would indirectly force public
schools to cut bureaucracy.
Moe, a supporter of Proposition
174, said that the revision reflect
ed concerns that vouchers alone
are not a panacea for public
schools. "Many voters simply
don't believe that market competi
tion will transform the public
schools," he said. "They want tan
gible reforms.
"It's important for a reform ini
tiative to have a separate public re
form | proposal]," Moe said.
The proposal also carries over
previously existing provisions that
encourage public school deregula
tion, choice between school dis

tricts, and the creation of charter
schools largely free from state reg
ulation.
"This proposal is ideally suited
to be wildly popular," Moe said.
"It's hard for me to understand
how someone could be opposed to
this."
However, Education Frof. Mar
tin Carnoy, who opposes school
vouchers, thinks that the amend
ed proposition is "still going to fos
ter a lot of opposition."
He said that the changes Moe
suggests are "all good things" but
lamented that the provisions were
all bundled together.
"You have to buy the whole
package," he said. "You have to |go
along with] the voucher ideas."
Carnoy added that he felt
Moe's initiative would be the best
of those proposed, but he warned
that national support for vouch
ers in California could be very
weak after the devastating defeat
of Proposition 174.
Once completely phased in,
Moe's initiative would give
school-age children scholarships
worth at least 50 percent of the
average per-pupil cost of public
education. Low-income students
under the proposal would
receive scholarships worth 80
percent.
As with Proposition 174, these
vouchers could be used at any
school willing to accept them,
including religious schools.
Moe stressed that aspects of
his proposal make it "radically
different" from the failed voucher
initiative. "We introduced
accountability standards for cur
riculum, teacher qualifications,
financial disclosure and testing,"
he said.
He added that his initiative
would not alienate 174 support
ers either, because voucher
redeeming private schools would
not have to hire certified teach
ers. "There's no evidence that
[having a] teaching certificate
helps," he said.
Teachers would, however, be
required to have a bachelor's
degree or equivalent and would
need to pass the CBEST standard
test required of all public school
teachers, Moe said.
The initiative would also guar
antee that funding per pupil in
public schools would not decline,

Moe said.
Possibly the most controver
sial aspect of Moe's proposal is a
provision that would require
voucher-redeeming private
schools to allocate 15 percent of
new admissions to "low-income"
students.
After the election, Moe initial
ly submitted two proposed initia
tives, one with the 15 percent
provision and one without it. He
said he kept the stipulation in the
revised document because most
people he spoke to liked it.
"People we've talked to say it
won't be much of a problem,"
Moe said.
However, backers of the initia
tive attempted to blunt its finan
cial impact by providing for up to
nine years to phase in provisions
of the proposal, he said. For
example, low-income children
would not receive the full scholar
ships until six years after the ini
tiative went into effect.
Moe said that the next step is
to seek financial and political sup
port for the initiative — which
must compete with two unrelated
proposals — while the state attor
ney general summarizes and
assesses the financial impact of
the proposal, a process which
could take up to 60 days.
When this is completed, sup
porters will begin to collect the
600,000 to 700,000 signatures
needed to place the proposal on
the ballot. If the initiative gets on
the November 1994 ballot and
passes, it would begin to be
phased in during the 1995-96
school year, Moe said.
In addition to Moe, the propos
al was signed by UC-Berkeley
Law Profs. John Coons and
Stephen Sugarman and Bay Area
doctors Alan Bonsteel and Carlos
Bonilla.

lamented that the provisions were
all bundled together.
"You have to buy the whole
package," he said. "You have to |go
along with] the voucher ideas."
Carnoy added that he felt
Moe's initiative would be the best
of those proposed, but he warned
that national support for vouch
ers in California could be very
weak after the devastating defeat
of Proposition 174.
Once completely phased in,
Moe's initiative would give
school-age children scholarships
worth at least 50 percent of the
average per-pupil cost of public
education. Low-income students
under the proposal would
receive scholarships worth 80
percent.
As with Proposition 174, these
vouchers could be used at any
school willing to accept them,
including religious schools.
Moe stressed that aspects of
his proposal make it "radically
different" from the failed voucher
initiative. "We introduced
accountability standards for cur
riculum, teacher qualifications,
financial disclosure and testing,"
he said.
He added that his initiative
would not alienate 174 support
ers either, because voucher
redeeming private schools would
not have to hire certified teach
ers. "There's no evidence that
[having a] teaching certificate
helps," he said.
Teachers would, however, be
required to have a bachelor's
degree or equivalent and would
need to pass the CBEST standard
test required of all public school
teachers, Moe said.
The initiative would also guar
antee that funding per pupil in
public schools would not decline,

Moe said.
Possibly the most controver
sial aspect of Moe's proposal is a
provision that would require
voucher-redeeming private
schools to allocate 15 percent of
new admissions to "low-income"
students.
After the election, Moe initial
ly submitted two proposed initia
tives, one with the 15 percent
provision and one without it. He
said he kept the stipulation in the
revised document because most
people he spoke to liked it.
"People we've talked to say it
won't be much of a problem,"
Moe said.
However, backers of the initia
tive attempted to blunt its finan
cial impact by providing for up to
nine years to phase in provisions
of the proposal, he said. For
example, low-income children
would not receive the full scholar
ships until six years after the ini
tiative went into effect.
Moe said that the next step is
to seek financial and political sup
port for the initiative — which
must compete with two unrelated
proposals — while the state attor
ney general summarizes and
assesses the financial impact of
the proposal, a process which
could take up to 60 days.
When this is completed, sup
porters will begin to collect the
600,000 to 700,000 signatures
needed to place the proposal on
the ballot. If the initiative gets on
the November 1994 ballot and
passes, it would begin to be
phased in during the 1995-96
school year, Moe said.
In addition to Moe, the propos
al was signed by UC-Berkeley
Law Profs. John Coons and
Stephen Sugarman and Bay Area
doctors Alan Bonsteel and Carlos
Bonilla.
Political Science Prof. Terry
Moe — a vocal education-reform
advocate — has submitted a
proposition to improve public
schools for possible placement on
next November's ballot.
The nine-page proposal, which
Moe and four others formally sub
mitted to the state attorney gener
al's office Thursday, is actually an
amended version of a school
voucher initiative Moe introduced
on Nov. 3, the day after California
voters rejected Proposition 174,
another voucher initiative.
The updated version of the ini
tiative, which would amend Arti
cle IX of the California Constitu

tion, includes two new provisions
that would give much more con
trol to individual public schools
and would indirectly force public
schools to cut bureaucracy.
Moe, a supporter of Proposition
174, said that the revision reflect
ed concerns that vouchers alone
are not a panacea for public
schools. "Many voters simply
don't believe that market competi
tion will transform the public
schools," he said. "They want tan
gible reforms.
"It's important for a reform ini
tiative to have a separate public re
form | proposal]," Moe said.
The proposal also carries over
previously existing provisions that
encourage public school deregula
tion, choice between school dis

tricts, and the creation of charter
schools largely free from state reg
ulation.
"This proposal is ideally suited
to be wildly popular," Moe said.
"It's hard for me to understand
how someone could be opposed to
this."
However, Education Frof. Mar
tin Carnoy, who opposes school
vouchers, thinks that the amend
ed proposition is "still going to fos
ter a lot of opposition."
He said that the changes Moe
suggests are "all good things" but
lamented that the provisions were
all bundled together.
"You have to buy the whole
package," he said. "You have to |go
