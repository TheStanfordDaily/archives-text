# Soaring number of complaints hits ombudsperson's office last year
## 
### Cametra Thompson Staff writer 
Complaints to the Ombudsperson's Office were
up by more than 25 percent this year, from 431 last
year to 551, Ombudsperson Leah Kaplan reported
last week.
By far, the largest increase was in staff com
plaints, which rose from 142 to 196. Kaplan attrib
uted this increase to University restructuring and
budget cuts. "People are becoming more anxious
about their jobs because they feel their job security is
threatened," she said.
In addition, much of the increase in reported com
plaints came from the complexity and severity of
some concerns, Kaplan said. For the first time, the

office was forced to double — and triple — count
some individual complaints.
"Manyofthemtookalot of time — they would |re
quirel several visits and phone calls," she said, and
the phone calls lasted as long as one and a half hours.
"Those types of complaints counted more."
The concerns, in general, were more serious this
year than in previous years. "Many of the people . . .
were angry, . . . litigious and sought reparation and
vindication," Kaplan said.
The largest number of student complaints were in
student affairs, followed by academics and housing.
Complaints ranged from grades and professors to
roommate assignments to penalties for Honor Code
