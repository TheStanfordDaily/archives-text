# Soaring number of complaints hits ombudsperson's office last year
## 
### Cametra Thompson Staff writer 
Complaints to the Ombudsperson's Office were
up by more than 25 percent this year, from 431 last
year to 551, Ombudsperson Leah Kaplan reported
last week.
By far, the largest increase was in staff com
plaints, which rose from 142 to 196. Kaplan attrib
uted this increase to University restructuring and
budget cuts. "People are becoming more anxious
about their jobs because they feel their job security is
threatened," she said.
In addition, much of the increase in reported com
plaints came from the complexity and severity of
some concerns, Kaplan said. For the first time, the

office was forced to double — and triple — count
some individual complaints.
"Manyofthemtookalot of time — they would |re
quirel several visits and phone calls," she said, and
the phone calls lasted as long as one and a half hours.
"Those types of complaints counted more."
The concerns, in general, were more serious this
year than in previous years. "Many of the people . . .
were angry, . . . litigious and sought reparation and
vindication," Kaplan said.
The largest number of student complaints were in
student affairs, followed by academics and housing.
Complaints ranged from grades and professors to
roommate assignments to penalties for Honor Code
violations. The office received
fewer complaints about food ser
vice this year, possibly because of
changes in the dining programs,
she said.
The Ombudsperson's Office
provides students, faculty and
staff a means of addressing com
plaints and resolving disputes.
"We encourage them to calmly sit

down and figure out what they
have done and what they can do
now," Kaplan said.
She emphasized that the office
does not provide legal services,
nor does it encourage legal action.
Kaplan, rather, helps com
plainants to pursue other options
in resolving disputes.
Officially, the ombudsperson
"receives complaints, pursues
inquiries into the issues involved
and makes recommendations for
suitable actions."
For students with academic

concerns, Kaplan said she tries to
"be sure they avail themselves of
every recourse they have — writ
ing, talking to the professor. If
they don't get a response them
selves, we may call [the professor]
and try to resolve the situation,"
she said.
The ombudsperson does not
serve as an advocate for a person
with a grievance, nor does it
"force changes in decisions made
by administrators in admissions,
housing assignments, parking
tickets, etcetera," Kaplan said.
