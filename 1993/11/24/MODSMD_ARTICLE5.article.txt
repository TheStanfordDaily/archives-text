# Self-defense course may return next fall
## Class leaders say format won't change; University administrators are skeptical 
### Nami Kim Staff writer 
Despite legal problems that caused the
cancellation of a women's self-defense
course earlier this year, the Women De
fending Ourselves Collective says that the
class will be taught on campus again — with
its format unchanged — beginning next
fall.
However, collective spokesperson Kris
Carpenter would not specify how the group
would get around charges that the class, in
its original form, violated Title IX, a federal
gender-equity law.
In mid-August, an anonymous individ
ual filed a sex discrimination charge against
the class, causing its two sponsors — the
collective and the Feminist Studies Pro
gram — to cancel the course.
"We plan to be fully operational by next
fall, at the latest," Carpenter said She
added that the collective does not intend to
alter the format of the class, which recoverd

the complaint because it did not offer an
equal counterpart for men.
"We won't change the format," Carpen
ter said. "Rut we will be back on campus."
When asked about the feasibility of keep
ing the class in its original format, Carpen
ter simply replied that "the only way the
collective will offer the class (is in its origi
nal forml"
That course of action seems unlikely, ac
cording to University Assoc. General Coun
sel Iris Brest, who said she "doubts very
much" that the class could remain exactly
in its original format.
Until a resolution complying with Title
IX is reached, the Feminist Studies Pro
gram cannot provide funding for the course,
said Jeanne Alcouloumre, the program's co
ordinator.
In addition, further approval beyond the
department's would be needed to allocate
funding to the course again.
