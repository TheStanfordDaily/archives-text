# Self-defense course may return next fall
## Class leaders say format won't change; University administrators are skeptical 
### Nami Kim Staff writer 
Despite legal problems that caused the
cancellation of a women's self-defense
course earlier this year, the Women De
fending Ourselves Collective says that the
class will be taught on campus again — with
its format unchanged — beginning next
fall.
However, collective spokesperson Kris
Carpenter would not specify how the group
would get around charges that the class, in
its original form, violated Title IX, a federal
gender-equity law.
In mid-August, an anonymous individ
ual filed a sex discrimination charge against
the class, causing its two sponsors — the
collective and the Feminist Studies Pro
gram — to cancel the course.
"We plan to be fully operational by next
fall, at the latest," Carpenter said She
added that the collective does not intend to
alter the format of the class, which recoverd

the complaint because it did not offer an
equal counterpart for men.
"We won't change the format," Carpen
ter said. "Rut we will be back on campus."
When asked about the feasibility of keep
ing the class in its original format, Carpen
ter simply replied that "the only way the
collective will offer the class (is in its origi
nal forml"
That course of action seems unlikely, ac
cording to University Assoc. General Coun
sel Iris Brest, who said she "doubts very
much" that the class could remain exactly
in its original format.
Until a resolution complying with Title
IX is reached, the Feminist Studies Pro
gram cannot provide funding for the course,
said Jeanne Alcouloumre, the program's co
ordinator.
In addition, further approval beyond the
department's would be needed to allocate
funding to the course again.
"We're exploring all our
options," Carpenter said,
although she declined to com
ment on exactly what those
options are. The collective has
met extensively throughout the
quarter, but Carpenter said it is
not prepared to present their
plans yet.

"There are a lot of factors
that have a lot of influence," she
said, adding that the collective's
hope is to eventually regain
funding without altering their
program.
The course originally began as
a self-defense class exclusively
for women, until complaints
forced the collective to offer a
similar class for males. That still
drew the ire of the complainant,
who claimed that because men
and women were separated dur

ing both the physical and discus
sion aspects of the class, the
classes were still intrinsically
unequal.
Since the University's legal
office received notice of the com
plaint from the U.S. Department
of Education's Office for Civil
Rights at beginning of the quar
ter, the collective did not have
enough time to make a decision
about how to comply with the
law.
The decision was left to mem

bers of the 15-women collective,
which chose to offer a condensed
six-week version of the program
at the nearby University Luther
an Church for no credit.
"We teach workshops off-cam
pus anyway," Carpenter said.
"Our purpose as an organization
is to teach classes."
In addition, the collective has
decided to offer the class in its
original 10-week format for no
credit at the church during win
ter quarter.
