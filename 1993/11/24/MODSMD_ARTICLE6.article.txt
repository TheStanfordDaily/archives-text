# CoHo expansion plans delayed by budget woes

Caffeine-addicted students hoping for
more breathing room as they sip their
frothy double mochas will have to wait a lit
tle longer, as the recently announced $20-
million budget cuts have postponed — and
even threaten to cancel — plans announced
last year to renovate and expand the CofTee
House.
Schematic drawings and cost estimates
for the proposed expansion of the CofTee
House into the space currently occupied by
Tresidder Recreation Center have already
been completed, according to Paul Szcze
siul, associate director of Tresidder Union.
He said his office had hoped to produce
$800,000 of the estimated $1.2 million cost
of the project through fundraising and to
cover the rest with funds from Tresidder re
serves and the University's General Plant
Improvement Fund.
Rut when his office sought approval to

raise funds, the offices of the provost and
the vice provost for student affairs — which
have authority over Tresidder fundraising
efforts — indicated that the project was not
a "high priority" because of the impendihg
budget cuts, Szczesiul said.
The Tresidder office is "working fever
ishly" and "doing a little more homework"
to find ways of increasing revenue and cut
ting expenses, Szczesiul said. He said he
hopes to have a clearer picture of the pro
ject's future in about two months.
Szczesiul expressed disappointment
that the project would not proceed on
schedule, pointing out that the Coffee
House's facilities are already strained, as it
was built on an old recreation center and
lacks the amenities of a full kitchen.
"The Coffee House is a really popular
place [among students!," he said, "and it's
in dire need of strengthening."
The original plans included taking over
the space currently doubling the
coffee house's seating capacity
from 120 to 220 by the Tresidder
Recreation Center as well as
adding a new air-conditioning

and sound system. The renova
tion would also increase the
kitchen area and give it the capac
ity to serve hot foods such as
hamburgers and french fries.
Szczesiul had hoped to obtain
final approval to start fundraising
this fall, construction should begin
in the spring and finishing up by
the time school opens next year.
