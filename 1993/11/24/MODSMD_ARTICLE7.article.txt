# Current system mismatches groups, offers little help
## Advising woes plague students 
### Skip Schwartz Senior staff writer 
While a majority of under
graduates seem to feel that the
current undergraduate advising
system is unsatisfactory, there
is lack of agreement on campus
about how to solve the problem.

A recent poll conducted by
The Daily revealed the extent of
dissatisfaction, as 65 percent of
the undergraduates surveyed
said the current academic advis
ing system — in which freshmen
are assigned to an adviser based
on an interest survey filled out
before coming to school — is in
adequate.
Eor sophomore Danielle Flo
res, one of the main problems
lies in the fact that students are
assigned to advisers based on
generalities, but the advisers
often know little about specific
classes within the field.
For example, Flores said that
by indicating "natural sciences"
as her primary field of interest,
she was assigned to an alumnus
who works at Microdisc and only
"knew that the bio core was
hard."

"The advising system needs
serious renovation," she said.
Flores added that she subse
quently ended up having to go to
the Undergraduate Advising
Center for advice, a beneficial
move as her adviser there "knew
the classes and was really able to
help."
History Prof. James Shee
han, chair of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education, said
that it is important to gather as
much student input as possible
to find a way to improve advis

ing.
The information-gathering
process, he said, will also reveal
one of the main problems with
the current system — defining
exactly what an adviser should
do.
Freshman Travis Park, who
expressed disappointment with
the overall advising system, said
he had hoped his adviser would
be well-versed in the different
majors and courses.
