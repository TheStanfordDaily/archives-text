# Current system mismatches groups, offers little help
## Advising woes plague students 
### Skip Schwartz Senior staff writer 
While a majority of under
graduates seem to feel that the
current undergraduate advising
system is unsatisfactory, there
is lack of agreement on campus
about how to solve the problem.

A recent poll conducted by
The Daily revealed the extent of
dissatisfaction, as 65 percent of
the undergraduates surveyed
said the current academic advis
ing system — in which freshmen
are assigned to an adviser based
on an interest survey filled out
before coming to school — is in
adequate.
Eor sophomore Danielle Flo
res, one of the main problems
lies in the fact that students are
assigned to advisers based on
generalities, but the advisers
often know little about specific
classes within the field.
For example, Flores said that
by indicating "natural sciences"
as her primary field of interest,
she was assigned to an alumnus
who works at Microdisc and only
"knew that the bio core was
hard."

"The advising system needs
serious renovation," she said.
Flores added that she subse
quently ended up having to go to
the Undergraduate Advising
Center for advice, a beneficial
move as her adviser there "knew
the classes and was really able to
help."
History Prof. James Shee
han, chair of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education, said
that it is important to gather as
much student input as possible
to find a way to improve advis

ing.
The information-gathering
process, he said, will also reveal
one of the main problems with
the current system — defining
exactly what an adviser should
do.
Freshman Travis Park, who
expressed disappointment with
the overall advising system, said
he had hoped his adviser would
be well-versed in the different
majors and courses.

Undergraduate adviser Verity Powell and junior Jeremy Gaylord
discuss classes yesterday at the Undergraduate Advising Center.
The Commission on Undergraduate Education will study Stan
ford's current academic guidance system.
"My adviser doesn't really help
me that much. . . . My relation
ship with him is pretty distant,"
he said.
Lynne Yirchott, an adviser for
three years, said she has had the
opposite problem. She had indi
cated humanities and social sci
ences as her areas of interest, but
last year was given some "science
oriented" students to advise. Yir
chott, who directs local foreign
language and global education
projects, said that it was difficult
for her to advise these students
because she isn't an expert in the
sciences.
Sheehan said that since the
range of students' demands on
advisers include "taking them
through the requirements, being
a counselor, being an intellectual
mentor or guiding them through
research ... it is unlikely that
they will all be found in the same
person."
Part of the problem, according
to Hector Cuevas, the advising
center's director, is that there is
no firm standard for faculty and
staff to follow.
"Once we are all working from
the same set of expectations and
standards, we can compare them
with student expectations and
see where we meet them," he
added.
Cuevas said that the advising
center feels the adviser should
"be able to assist with personal
and intellectual needs. . . . They
should develop a rapport with the
students and serve as an intellec
tual mentor and be able to ask the
right questions."
He added that there is a debate
over whether advisers should "be
the nuts and bolts and know all
the academic stuff versus just
helping to make good decisions."
The latter serves more of the pur
pose of the faculty or staff advis
er, he said, while the student
advising associates in the dorms
are there to answer more detailed
questions.
However, Law Prof. Robert
Weisberg, another commission
member, said he feels that the
current advising system often
does not help students make good
decisions.
"My major concern is that stu
dents have not been encouraged

enough to be creative," he said.
Weisberg said that he sees a
discouraging trend among under
graduates to take "safer" courses
that look good on applications for
professional schools. Too often,
he said, students do not use Stan
ford's undergraduate education
to its potential, tracking them
selves into certain courses under
the"the misimpression" that
there is, for example, a pre-law
major.

'My major concern
is that students
have not been
encouraged enough
to be creative.'
— Robert Weisberg

Weisberg, who is also an advis
er, said he understands the signif
icant impact outside factors —
particularly economic ones —
have on a student's undergradu
ate career. Nevertheless, he said
he is discouraged by the fact that
more high-quality students do
not pursue post-graduate
degrees, but rather go to profes
sional schools.
He said that while the increase
of, for example, excellent English
and philosophy graduates to go
into law as "a default profession"
has led to an increase in excellent
law students, he still wishes stu
dents were advised "to have inter
esting undergraduate careers and
go to 'off-track' courses."
One way Weisberg said he
thinks this might be accom
plished is if more faculty were
advisers and could therefore
encourage more students to look
into careers in higher education.
Still, some feel that requiring
faculty to serve as advisers may
end up being counterproductive.
Forcing faculty to be advisers
when they are not interested in
that role "would not be a good
thing," Cuevas said.
Faculty members used to have
advising quotas before a volun
teer system was used, and many
"ended up as bad advisers," he
said.
In addition, it is not only facul
ty who can offer students sound

academic advice. Only about one
third of the current freshman
advisers are faculty, but Cuevas
said that response from students
has shown that staff members
"can do as good or a better job of
being advisers."
The range of advising demands
and situations, however, shows
the importance of having both an
advising center and student
advising associates, Cuevas said.
"There is a need to have a cen
tralized backup system — so stu
dents can come to a central office
to meet their additional needs"
that cannot be met through gen
eral advising, he said.
The center also serves a signif
icant function when students
change their field of interest.
Because there are not enough fac
ulty to allow students to switch
their freshman advisers, Cuevas
said students can go to the cen
tralized office for help before they
declare.
In addition, Cuevas said, AAs
serve a vital role by "filling in the
gaps since they know more about
the nuts and bolts and relate bet
ter to the students."
Park noted that his AA has
"been more helpful" than his
advisor and checked up on his
academic progress.
However, despite the benefits
of the AA system, some feel even
that part of the system could use
a boost.
"There is not enough incen
tive to do a good job," said junior
Mark Kanok, an AA in Branner
Hall. He added that there needs
to be more accountability for the
AAs so that all consistently do a
good job and do not just use
their position "as a resume
filler."
Cuevas agreed, saying that he
would support any way to
strengthen the AA position to
give more incentives to students
to get involved in advising.
Sheehan said that keeping in
mind all of the different opinions
and suggestions for advising will
be an arduous task for the sub
committee formed to look into
this area of undergraduate educa
tion.
While Sheehan said he does
not want to predict how the sys
tem might be changed, Cuevas
said he feels a new system "may
not need a radical change — just
fine-tuning and a commitment to
faculty roles and expectations to
measure future success."

Eor sophomore Danielle Flo

lies in the fact that students are
assigned to advisers based on
generalities, but the advisers
often know little about specific
classes within the field.
For example, Flores said that
by indicating "natural sciences"
as her primary field of interest,
she was assigned to an alumnus
who works at Microdisc and only
"knew that the bio core was
hard."

"The advising system needs
serious renovation," she said.
Flores added that she subse
quently ended up having to go to
the Undergraduate Advising
Center for advice, a beneficial
move as her adviser there "knew
the classes and was really able to
help."
History Prof. James Shee

Undergraduate Education, said
that it is important to gather as
much student input as possible
to find a way to improve advis

ing.
The information-gathering
process, he said, will also reveal

Undergraduate adviser Verity Powell and junior Jeremy Gaylord
discuss classes yesterday at the Undergraduate Advising Center.
The Commission on Undergraduate Education will study Stan
ford's current academic guidance system.
"My adviser doesn't really help
me that much. . . . My relation
ship with him is pretty distant,"
he said.
Lynne Yirchott, an adviser for
three years, said she has had the
opposite problem. She had indi
cated humanities and social sci
ences as her areas of interest, but
last year was given some "science
oriented" students to advise. Yir
chott, who directs local foreign
language and global education
projects, said that it was difficult
for her to advise these students
because she isn't an expert in the
sciences.
Sheehan said that since the
range of students' demands on
advisers include "taking them
through the requirements, being
a counselor, being an intellectual
mentor or guiding them through
research ... it is unlikely that
they will all be found in the same
person."
Part of the problem, according
to Hector Cuevas, the advising
center's director, is that there is
no firm standard for faculty and
staff to follow.
"Once we are all working from
the same set of expectations and
standards, we can compare them
with student expectations and
see where we meet them," he
added.
Cuevas said that the advising
center feels the adviser should
"be able to assist with personal
and intellectual needs. . . . They
should develop a rapport with the
students and serve as an intellec
tual mentor and be able to ask the
right questions."
He added that there is a debate
over whether advisers should "be
the nuts and bolts and know all
the academic stuff versus just
helping to make good decisions."
The latter serves more of the pur
pose of the faculty or staff advis
er, he said, while the student
advising associates in the dorms
are there to answer more detailed
questions.
However, Law Prof. Robert
Weisberg, another commission
member, said he feels that the
current advising system often
does not help students make good
decisions.
"My major concern is that stu
dents have not been encouraged

enough to be creative," he said.
Weisberg said that he sees a
discouraging trend among under
graduates to take "safer" courses
that look good on applications for
professional schools. Too often,
he said, students do not use Stan
ford's undergraduate education
to its potential, tracking them
selves into certain courses under
the"the misimpression" that
there is, for example, a pre-law
major.

'My major concern
is that students
have not been
encouraged enough
to be creative.'
— Robert Weisberg

Weisberg, who is also an advis
er, said he understands the signif
icant impact outside factors —
particularly economic ones —
have on a student's undergradu
ate career. Nevertheless, he said
he is discouraged by the fact that
more high-quality students do
not pursue post-graduate
degrees, but rather go to profes
sional schools.
He said that while the increase
of, for example, excellent English
and philosophy graduates to go
into law as "a default profession"
has led to an increase in excellent
law students, he still wishes stu
dents were advised "to have inter
esting undergraduate careers and
go to 'off-track' courses."
One way Weisberg said he
thinks this might be accom
plished is if more faculty were
advisers and could therefore
encourage more students to look
into careers in higher education.
Still, some feel that requiring
faculty to serve as advisers may
end up being counterproductive.
Forcing faculty to be advisers
when they are not interested in
that role "would not be a good
thing," Cuevas said.
Faculty members used to have
advising quotas before a volun
teer system was used, and many
"ended up as bad advisers," he
said.
In addition, it is not only facul
ty who can offer students sound

academic advice. Only about one
third of the current freshman
advisers are faculty, but Cuevas
said that response from students
has shown that staff members
"can do as good or a better job of
being advisers."
The range of advising demands
and situations, however, shows
the importance of having both an
advising center and student
advising associates, Cuevas said.
"There is a need to have a cen
tralized backup system — so stu
dents can come to a central office
to meet their additional needs"
that cannot be met through gen
eral advising, he said.
The center also serves a signif
icant function when students
change their field of interest.
Because there are not enough fac
ulty to allow students to switch
their freshman advisers, Cuevas
said students can go to the cen
tralized office for help before they
declare.
In addition, Cuevas said, AAs
serve a vital role by "filling in the
gaps since they know more about
the nuts and bolts and relate bet
ter to the students."
Park noted that his AA has
"been more helpful" than his
advisor and checked up on his
academic progress.
However, despite the benefits
of the AA system, some feel even
that part of the system could use
a boost.
"There is not enough incen
tive to do a good job," said junior
Mark Kanok, an AA in Branner
Hall. He added that there needs
to be more accountability for the
AAs so that all consistently do a
good job and do not just use
their position "as a resume
filler."
Cuevas agreed, saying that he
would support any way to
strengthen the AA position to
give more incentives to students
to get involved in advising.
Sheehan said that keeping in
mind all of the different opinions
and suggestions for advising will
be an arduous task for the sub
committee formed to look into
this area of undergraduate educa
tion.
While Sheehan said he does
not want to predict how the sys
tem might be changed, Cuevas
said he feels a new system "may
not need a radical change — just
fine-tuning and a commitment to
faculty roles and expectations to
measure future success."
While a majority of under
graduates seem to feel that the
current undergraduate advising
system is unsatisfactory, there
is lack of agreement on campus
about how to solve the problem.

A recent poll conducted by
The Daily revealed the extent of
dissatisfaction, as 65 percent of
the undergraduates surveyed
said the current academic advis
ing system — in which freshmen
are assigned to an adviser based
on an interest survey filled out
before coming to school — is in
adequate.
