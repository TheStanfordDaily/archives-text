A story in yesterday's Daily
about Provost Condoleezza Rice's
speech to staff members wrongly
attributed three quotations.
Frank Topper, not Rich Bald
win as reported, said Rice's "spir
it and conviction reminds me of
[former University President
Donald] Kennedy."
"She has a vision that people
can interpret in the way they

want to," Topper said. However,
he suggested that such an effect
can be detrimental to progress,
mainly because it may be difficult
to "align" the differing interpre
tations of Rice's message.
Baldwin, not Topper as report
ed, said the provost's ideas
resounded with "more clarity"
than previous ones. "She has given
more people an idea of where we're
going, and what it will take to get
there," Baldwin said.
