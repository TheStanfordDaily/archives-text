## Water polo team sinks USC 11-9, nets NCAA title 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
LONG BEACH - No one
questions them now.
The Stanford men's water
polo team held down the top spot
in the national polls throughout
the season, but after dropping
three of their final four games
heading into the NCAA Champi
onships, many questioned
whether the Cardinal deserved
their lofty ranking.
Last night, the team answered
its critics by trouncing No. 3 USC
11-9 for the national champi
onship in Long Beach's Belmont
Olympic Pool. In defeating the
Trojans, the polo team garnered
its seventh NCAA title, and the
Cardinal's first since 1986.
It's also the sixth title earned
by head coach Dante Dettamanti

in his 16 years at Stanford. "It
gets sweeter every time," Detta
manti said. "It's the greatest
feeling in the world to win
NCAAs."
Against the Trojans, the Car
dinal turned a 4-4 halftime tie
into a comfortable lead by
outscoring USC 5-1 in the third
quarter. The offensive outburst
was started with a man-advan
tage goal by senior Chris Wallin,
set up by junior Brian Clemens.
The game was virtually sealed
later in the same quarter as both
sophomore Jeremy Laster and
junior Wolf Wigo netted two
point goals.
Although the Trojans tried to
rally in the fourth quarter, the
championship was assured when
senior holeman Frank Schneider

scored from directly in front of the
goal as time wound down on the
shot clock.
"I knew I had no chance of draw
ing a foul and kicking the ball back
out," Schneider said. "I knew I
needed a shot and Jose (Santiago)
was trying to get an offensive foul
called. I stepped away from him and
got a good turn for the shot."
The victory was especially sweet
for Stanford's seniors, who have
been turned away twice in the
NCAA finals, both times at the
hands of UC-Berkeley. This year,
USC stepped in the way of a third
Stanford-Cal final in four years by
bouncing the Bears in Saturday's

semifinals in a 12-11 overtime
match.
"As freshmen, when we came in,
we said we were going to win
NCAAs, and now we've done it,"
said senior Antonio Busquets, a
first-team all-tournament pick.
Cardinal senior goaltender Lar
ry Bercutt was named co-MVP of
the tournament, along with USC's
Uzi Hadar.
The road to the title began Fri
day, when Stanford and Navy met
for the first time this season. It
didn't take long for the Cardinal to
prove they were ready for a champi
onship run as nine players scored
goals in a 16-1 pounding of the Mid
shipmen. Josh Leachman and Tom
Mitchell led the barrage, scoring

three times apiece. Bercutt and
Jack Bowen split time in the goal
and combined to turn away all but
one of the Middies' attempts.
In the semifinals, Stanford faced
UC-Irvine, which had defeated
Pacific 12-10 in the first round.
While the Cardinal was well-rested
afler their opener, the Anteaters
showed physical fatigue, especially
in the second half of play. The two
teams fought evenly throughout
the first half, but the difference in
depth began to show late in the sec
ond period when Stanford's Wolf
Wigo raced away from the Irvine
defense to score a breakaway goal.

Afler the half ended tied at six,
Stanford shut down the Anteaters'
offense for the entire third quarter.

"We came out attacking," said
Clemens, who scored two goals in
the match. "It seemed like we had a
lot of speed. Our team is deeper and
we could substitute more often. We
were able to keep up our counter for
the whole game."
Busquets led the team in scoring
with three goals, but the offensive
effort was well balanced, as all six
starters put the ball in the net.
Most noteworthy was the perfor
mance of Schneider, who drew four
ejections and a penalty shot against
the Anteaters.
"I think I matched up really well
with their hole defenders," Schnei
der said. "I had two or three turns
where I didn't get ejections called. I
matched up well against their per
sonnel. 1 don't do a lot of scoring,
but I add stability to the offense. It
was just a matter of time before we
were able to wear them out."
On top of being fatigued, the
Anteaters were further frustrated
by the defensive efforts of Stan
ford's hole defender Jeremy Laster.
Laster, the team's leading scorer on
the year, contributed five steals and
forced several other turnovers.
UCI coach Ted Newland, whose
team defeated the Cardinal two
weeks ago at the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Tournament,
noted the change in Stanford's per
formance, "The difference between
today and two weeks ago was that
Stanford was mentally prepared to
play today."
Dettamanti was pleased with his
team's execution of its game plan of
shutting down UCl's outside
threats.
"The key was our tight defense
in the second half and holding them
to eight goals," Dettamanti said.
"Our strategy was to force them to
shoot one-point shots and not give
up the two-pointer. They are a very
good two-point shooting team."
While the Cardinal relaxed afler
their match, they watched another

very good two-point shooting team,
USC, come from behind to defeat
Cal, the three-time defending
NCAA champions.
Hadar fired a two-pointer late in
regulation to give the Trojans a 9-8
lead and struck again from beyond
the line as the overtime wound
down. That shot gave USC their
decisive 12-11 margin and excluded
the Golden Bears from the finals for
the first time in seven years.
The overtime thriller may have
taken its toll on the Trojans, how
ever, as the Cardinal came out
strongly and let up in Sun
day's final. I ,r the second straight

day, Stanford took a tie into half
time and grabbed control of the
game in the third quarter.
"This season, we have not had
good third quarters," Dettamanti
said. "We've gone into halftime
ahead and seen leads evaporate.
Yesterday it was defense, today it
was offense that was the key in the
third quarter."
Stanford enjoyed success on
their man-advantage situations,
converting five of seven opportuni
ties. Clemens assisted on three of
Stanford's goals, finding Schneider
and Wallin open, and later tossing a
perfect crossing pass to Busquets.
"We have such a strong team,"
Clemens said. "We've got threats
from both sides on the six-on-five.
I'm looking for my shot but also
looking at the posts for openings.
Tonight it was easy pickings."
Wigo, one of the best outside
shooters in the nation, netted his
two-pointer with 41 seconds re
maining in the third period to put
Stanford up by four. Wigo was
Stanford's top scorer in the NCAAs
with six goals and was named first
team all-tournament.
"Wolfs goal really sealed the
game for us," Dettamanti said. "A
four-goal lead is hard to come back
from. They almost did it."
Schneider ensured the Cardinal
victory, scoring his goal with just 41
seconds left.
USC's last attempt failed when
Laster stole the ball from Trojan
holeman Drew Netherton with 36
ticks left on the clock.
For Bercutt, last night's game
finally snared the title he has been
seeking since he arrived at Stan
ford.
"We dominated that game all the
way through," he said. "We dominat
ed all the way. This makes four years
of training hard wort hwhile."
