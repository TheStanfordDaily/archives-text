questions them now.

polo team held down the top spot
in the national polls throughout
the season, but after dropping
three of their final four games
heading into the NCAA Champi

whether the Cardinal deserved
their lofty ranking.
Last night, the team answered
its critics by trouncing No. 3 USC
11-9 for the national champi
onship in Long Beach's Belmont
Olympic Pool. In defeating the
Trojans, the polo team garnered
its seventh NCAA title, and the
Cardinal's first since 1986.
It's also the sixth title earned
by head coach Dante Dettamanti

in his 16 years at Stanford. "It
gets sweeter every time," Detta
manti said. "It's the greatest
feeling in the world to win
NCAAs."

into a comfortable lead by
outscoring USC 5-1 in the third
quarter. The offensive outburst
was started with a man-advan

set up by junior Brian Clemens.
The game was virtually sealed
later in the same quarter as both
sophomore Jeremy Laster and
junior Wolf Wigo netted two
point goals.

rally in the fourth quarter, the
championship was assured when
