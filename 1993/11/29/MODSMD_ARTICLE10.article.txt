## Learn the language CUE should look at link between overseas study, language requirements 
### 
The overseas studies
program is truly one of the
most distinctive aspects of a
Stanford undergraduate educa
tion.
With eight campuses around
the globe, from Moscow to Santia
go, a substantial number of stu
dents each year indulge in the
opportunity to broaden their per
spectives beyond the confines of
the Farm.
But the chance to immerse one
self in another culture, to question
and examine values and norms
through the comparison of cul
tures, to make new friends — in
short, to broaden one's horizon —
is ultimately dependent on an abil
ity to communicate with people of
the host nation.
As a result, when the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education
re-evaluates Stanford's foreign lan
guage requirement, they shouldn't
neglect to examine the Overseas
Studies program.
The examination should address
several questions about the inter
play between the requirement and
students' academic and cultural
experiences overseas.
In the course of discussing
whether foreign language prepara
tion at Stanford helps to immerse
students in other cultures, the
CUE should address how stringent
£he language requirement should
be for admission to overseas pro
grams.
Currently, the language re
quirements for the programs vary
dramatically. Some require no
study of a foreign language — the
Oxford program, for obvious rea
sons — while others require virtu
al fluency, such as the Paris 1 pro
gram.
Between these two extremes lie
programs, like the one in Berlin,

that require only two quarters of
college-level language instruction.
In recommending changes in
foreign language requirements for
the overseas programs, the CUE
would be well-served if they erred
on the side of more language pre
requisites for admission to over
seas programs.
Inevitably, there are tradeoffs
which will ensue if the requirement
is increased.
For example, students who
major in the sciences or engineer
ing may have schedules that pre
vent them from taking additional
language classes.
But adding prerequisites will
undoubtedly raise the average lan
guage ability of the students par
ticipating in the program. Stu
dents with higher ability are more
likely to be comfortable in the day
to-day culture of the host nation.
Overseas campuses offer cultural
resources that no Stanford quar
ter could match, especially when
students are linguistically pre
pared to immerse themselves in
the society.
Recognizing this, it would be
best to strengthen the foreign-lan
guage criteria for admittance into
the overseas programs.
Such a course would not unduly
attenuate the number of student
applicants if provisions were made
for technical students at the vari
ous programs to fulfill major
requirements during their study
abroad.
Furthermore, the stiffer stan
dards would have the additional
benefit of ensuring that all partici
pating students would have a truly
worthwhile term abroad.
Accordingly, a priority of our
Overseas Studies program should
be to encourage the maximum
amount of cultural immersion by
students.
While internship programs and
field trips coordinated by the cam
puses themselves can further this
goal, it is essential that students
achieve a working level of ability in
foreign languages before they begin
their journey.
Bon voyage.
