## A 						prescription for peace

An open letter to Daily News Projects Edi
tor Andy Dworkin:
IN THE Nov. 12 issue of The Daily, you
wrote an article explaining how to be a
successful Daily columnist. I would
like to thank you for this public service.
There is no place that has a more innate,
interwoven sense of community than
Stanford, allowing us to share the vast
multitude of knowledge that we possess
collectively. In that spirit of altruism, I
would like to offer my own how-to
instruction set.
How To Achieve World Peace: A quick
and easy 10-step process.
1. Develop a gene that will make humans
photosynthetic.
This should take, depending on luck,
anywhere from half an hour to 13 million
years. If you're having trouble with this,
consult someone who won't consider you
crazy, or doesn't care if you are.
2. Attach that gene to an inhalant.
While you're at it, you can put some
thing in to plug up ozone holes and pre
vent bad hair days.
3. Develop a viral treatment to allow
human DNA to splice in foreign strands of
DNA taken from inhalants.
4. Bind a sample of the viral treatment to
each existing nuclear warhead.
5. You now have two choices. Either bind
the human-photosynthetic-gene inhalant
to the same nuclear warheads, or sell it in

little bottles labeled Evian Mineral Air.
I suggest the former for efficiency, the
latter will just make you impossibly rich.
6. Call the leaders of all the nations of the
world together.
To persuade them to come, you must
only send them the following:
"Dear Great and Powerful Leader,
You are cordially invited to the first
and last conference to achieve world
peace, to be held on Monday, November
29, 1993, in Terman Auditorium, Stan
ford University, soon to be renowned as
the birthdate of peace, joy and worldwide
happiness. If you choose not to attend
this conference, we will not be responsi
ble for what your people will do to you
when we inform them of this opportuni
ty." (Insert picture of Mussolini hanging
from his toes.)
To those who still choose not to come,
send this:
"Dear Great and Powerful Leader,
You are cordially invited to the first
and last conference to achieve world peace
under your total dominance. \ .
7. Encourage these leaders to bomb any
country that they've ever wanted to, has
ever insulted them or has ever annoyed
them.
You may need to limit the number of
countries who get to bomb the United
States.
8. Assure and convince the world's popu
lation that these bombing raids are actu

ally for a very good cause â€” world peace.
This may be difficult. 1 would consult
"Starting Your Own World Religion in
Just Five Easy Steps." Proceed to the chap
ter on making people believe whatever you
want, titled "Have Fun, You 're a God."
9. Ravage every human concentration in
the world with your bombs.
This shouldn't be too hard. But try not
to have too much fun. Remember: World
peace.
10. Accept the Nobel Peace Prize with
gracc and humility.
Now you only need to wait 30 years for
a generation to pass, so that the gene can
take effect. People, now having their most
basic need fulfilled, won't need to declare
war. In wars for territory, the value of
land is its ability to produce food or to
receive food. In wars for sovereignty, the
oppressors want most to make their sur
vival as easy as possible; the oppressed
want the same, and those sets are no
longer exclusive. And with all the new
photosynthetic organisms, we could even
curb the greenhouse effect.
Again, Mr. Dworkin, thank you for
sharingyour knowledge with the commu
nity. I encourage the rest of the Stanford
community to do the same.
Sincerely,
Thai Bui
