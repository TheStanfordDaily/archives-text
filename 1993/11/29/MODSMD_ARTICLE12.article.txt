## Stadium events should implement recycling programs 
### 
Having recently had the
pleasure of cleaning the stadium
after Big Game as a fund raiser
for a club sports team, I'm writing to say
how disgusted I am at the amount of
trash produced by one football game.
My team cleaned half the stadium which
produced over 100 30-gallon bags of
trash consisting mostly of food wrap
pers, cups, and copies of Cardinal Today.
(Of course there were more exotic items
like styrofoam peanuts, diapers and con
doms.)

This load of trash only takes into
account the garbage people chose to
throw under their seats. This does not
include any garbage actually placed in
trash cans or the hundreds of bags filled
by the parking lot clean-up crews, or
that which made its way onto the play
ing field.
So beyond the problem of people litter
ing I find it outrageous that there has been
no attempt by concessionaires at the foot
ball games to reduce the amount of dispos
able, non-biodegradable, non-recyclable

waste which comes with their products.
Furthermore, I saw no signs of recy
cling bins or any attempt to recycle the
numerous cans and bottles from beer,
wine and soda (yes, our stadium is alco
hol-free) or the hundreds of plastic 12-
ounce Crystal Geyser water bottles. In
our half of the stadium alone I filled 10
bags with recyclable material, which we
voluntarily took to the recycling center
since no method for recycling had been
provided. 4
So I demand that the Department of

Athletics (or whoever controls these
things) look into avenues for waste
reduction and litter control as well as
working with the recycling center to pro
mote recycling at stadium events. Unfor
tunately, I have little hope that things
can change if people are still willing to
mindlessly throw tons of garbage to the
ground with no thought of how it gets
picked up or where it will spend the next
1,000 years.
