# Former staffer decries small Big Game spirit among Stanford's fans
## 
### 
As an emeritus staff member, moth
er of an alumnus and football season
ticket holder for a number of years, I
am writing to express the dismay I and
a lot of other Stanford football fans
seated around us at the Big Game felt
about the complete lack of spirit dis
played by the Stanford cheerleaders,
the band and the student body.
At every home game this season the
cheerleaders divided and led cheers
from both sides of the field â€” no cheer
leaders came to the press box side of
the field Saturday to lead even one
cheer! The band might just as well not
have been at the game. And the stadi
um announcer had to ask twice for the
card holders to put up their cards and
even then the response was little better
than mediocre. If organizers go to the
trouble to organize cards which every
one loves, then get behind them and
make a show
The Bears, on the other hand, were
really fired up. We may not have won
the game, but I think our team deserved

support from the fans and then perhaps
the score may not have been so lopsided.
The team certainly must have been pret
ty disheartened by the lack of fan sup
port.
