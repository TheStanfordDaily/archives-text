# Student proposes a new mascot in keeping with Stanford's unique past
## 
### 
Without a doubt, our new mascot
should be the "Robber Barons." Is there
really any other choice?
"Robber Barons" is a tough enough
name that the football team and the
Review won't endlessly preen about hav
ing to be the "Cardinal," or worse, the
"Salamanders."
"Robber Barons" won't offend anyone
(except a few capitalist pigs, who, at
least the last time I checked, are not on
the Politically Correct protected list).
"Robber Barons" is reminiscent of
our proud past, evoking images of our
school gloriously rising from the spoils of
Leland Stanford's economic conquest of
the West.
"Robber Barons" is telling of our pre
sent: a cool, irreverent symbol of a

school which, among other things,
throws a huge party on its founders'
graves.
And finally, if the Career Faire is any
indication, "Robber Barons" is appropri
ate for Stanford's future as well.
For a visual representation, some
thing like that guy from the Monopoly
game, with two big bags of money in his
clutches would be perfect. We could
probably buy the copyright from Parker
Brothers.
What are we waiting for?
GO ROBBER BARONS, GO!
