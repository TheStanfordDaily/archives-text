# Bikes blocking access ramps to buildings are inexcusable behavior
## 
### 
As a student at Stanford, I feel very
fortunate to be a TAB — a temporarily
able body. I look at campus buildings
and see an inadequate level of access for
the disabled. Access ramps are typically
afterthoughts in relatively inconvenient
locations.
Unfortunately, even this level of
access is denied students with disabil
ities by the inconsiderate behavior of

their peers. Often, when I pass by
these ramps, they are partially or
completely obstructed by bicycles of
students too lazy and thoughtless to
park them somewhere else. This is
inexcusable.
Yesterday, the access ramp serving
Meyer Library and the Disability
Resource Center was completely blocked
by shiny $400 mountain bikes. Another
student noticed this and became some
what incensed. He picked up several of
the offending bicycles and threw them
into the bushes.
I applaud his spirit and hope only to
do something slightly more constructive.
