## Home more hospitable than road to Cardinal Cross of gold leads men past San Jose State, Cal State Northridge in Fry's Invitational 
### Rob Ross Editorial staff 
On the strength of 43 points in two
games by shooting guard Dion Cross, the
Stanford men's basketball won its own
Fry's Invitational over the break, defeat
ing Cal State Northridge 89-58 on Friday,
then topping San Jose State 69-58 in Sat
urday's final.
However, the Cardinal-Spartan final
was not nearly as close as the 11-point
spread would indicate. With a stifling
man-to-man defense, Stanford (2-0) held
San Jose State (1 -1) to a meager 38.1 per
cent field goal percentage and took a 15-
point lead into halftime.
At the beginning of the second half on
the Maples Pavilion parquet the Cardinal
stretched its lead to 21 before the Spar
tans were able to climb back into the
game and pull to within 11 points. But

back-to-back three-pointers by Cross
sparked Stanford to an 11-2 run and held
the Spartans at bay.

'Brevin's playing great —
he's doing everything a
point guard should and
more'
— David Harbour

San Jose State had reached the finals
by virtue of a 98-87 defeat of the Gonzaga
Zags (1-1).
"We hit an offensive lull, but kept play
ing good defense," Cross said. "They were
getting tired and went to a zone 1 defense)
and then I was able to hit my
threes."
Cross was the high scorer in
both of the Cardinal's games,
with 21 points against San Jose
State and 22 against Northridge.
He pointed to Stanford's defen
sive effort as key to both wins.
"Our goal this year is to pick
up our defense," the sophomore
said. "We want to be more physi
cal and take pride in our defense."
Stanford's defensive success
forced 25 Spartan turnovers,
compared with the Cardinal's 19.
Playing a big part in Stanford's
turnover advantage was fresh
man guard Brevin Knight, who
added three steals to his four
assists and 11 points while run
ning the point.
Knight split time with junior
Frank Harris in both games. Har
ris, a transfer from Connors State
Junior College, was four for five
from the field against the Spartans.
He also contributed three assists
and a steal in 13 minutes of play.
"Brevin's playing great — he's
doing everything a point guard
should and more," said junior
guard David Harbour. "Harris
had his best game of the year
(against San Jose State)."
Stanford also received stellar
play from other bench players
over the weekend. Against
Northridge (0-2) on Friday night
Cardinal center, senior center
Jim Morgan got into foul trouble
early and would play only nine
minutes in the contest. But junior
forward Todd Manley was able to
sink four baskets and two foul
shots in the first half to bolster
Stanford's middle. Meanwhile,
Harbour added 14 points of his
own in the Cardinal's goring of
the Matadors.
