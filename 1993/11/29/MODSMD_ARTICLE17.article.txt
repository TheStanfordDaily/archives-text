## Home more hospitable than road to Cardinal Cross of gold leads men past San Jose State, Cal State Northridge in Fry's Invitational 
### Rob Ross Editorial staff 
On the strength of 43 points in two
games by shooting guard Dion Cross, the
Stanford men's basketball won its own
Fry's Invitational over the break, defeat
ing Cal State Northridge 89-58 on Friday,
then topping San Jose State 69-58 in Sat
urday's final.
However, the Cardinal-Spartan final
was not nearly as close as the 11-point
spread would indicate. With a stifling
man-to-man defense, Stanford (2-0) held
San Jose State (1 -1) to a meager 38.1 per
cent field goal percentage and took a 15-
point lead into halftime.
At the beginning of the second half on
the Maples Pavilion parquet the Cardinal
stretched its lead to 21 before the Spar
tans were able to climb back into the
game and pull to within 11 points. But

back-to-back three-pointers by Cross
sparked Stanford to an 11-2 run and held
the Spartans at bay.

'Brevin's playing great —
he's doing everything a
point guard should and
more'
— David Harbour

San Jose State had reached the finals
by virtue of a 98-87 defeat of the Gonzaga
Zags (1-1).
"We hit an offensive lull, but kept play
ing good defense," Cross said. "They were
getting tired and went to a zone 1 defense)
