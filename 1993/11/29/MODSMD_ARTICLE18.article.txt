In a contest that lived up to its billing as
a clash between two women's basketball
giants, the sixth-ranked Cardinal dropped a
72-68 decision to No. 7 Texas Tech in Lub
bock on Saturday.
Paced by a 29-point, 12-rebound perfor
mance by sophomore center Michi Atkins,
the Lady Raiders (2-0) held the lead for
much of the game, thwarting several Stan
ford comeback attempts and pulling away
in the final two minutes before a sellout
crowd of 8,174 at the Municipal Coliseum.
The loss, which spoiled the season debut
of the young Cardinal (0-1), marked Tech's
second victory in as many weeks over a
highly ranked opponent; the Lady Raiders
downed then-second ranked Vanderbilt in a
preseason tournament on Nov. 20.
"They played with a lot of emotion and a
lot of pride," Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer said of the defending national
champions.

Possibly inspired by the attendance of
1993 Naismith Award winner Sheryl
Swoopes and a halftime NCAA champi
onship ring ceremony, the Lady Raiders
raced to a 31-19 lead with three and a half
minutes remaining in the first period.
Despite shooting an abysmal 36 percent
from the field on the half, however, the Car
dinal embarked on a furious 10-2 run that
closed the gap to 33-29 at intermission.
Sophomore forward Bobbie Kelsey led
the way back for Stanford, contributing 12
of her team-high 23 points in the first 20
minutes and eight in the closing surge.
"I was very pleased with the play of Bob
bie Kelsey," Van Derveer said.
Junior guard Kate Paye also wreaked
havoc on the Lady Raiders before the break,
coming off the bench to kick in all nine of
her points, record most of her team-high
eight assists and create four Texas Tech
turnovers with her trademark tenacity on
defense.
