# Ladies fall to Texas Tech in Lubbock, 72-68
## 
### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
In a contest that lived up to its billing as
a clash between two women's basketball
giants, the sixth-ranked Cardinal dropped a
72-68 decision to No. 7 Texas Tech in Lub
bock on Saturday.
Paced by a 29-point, 12-rebound perfor
mance by sophomore center Michi Atkins,
the Lady Raiders (2-0) held the lead for
much of the game, thwarting several Stan
ford comeback attempts and pulling away
in the final two minutes before a sellout
crowd of 8,174 at the Municipal Coliseum.
The loss, which spoiled the season debut
of the young Cardinal (0-1), marked Tech's
second victory in as many weeks over a
highly ranked opponent; the Lady Raiders
downed then-second ranked Vanderbilt in a
preseason tournament on Nov. 20.
"They played with a lot of emotion and a
lot of pride," Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer said of the defending national
champions.

Possibly inspired by the attendance of
1993 Naismith Award winner Sheryl
Swoopes and a halftime NCAA champi
onship ring ceremony, the Lady Raiders
raced to a 31-19 lead with three and a half
minutes remaining in the first period.
Despite shooting an abysmal 36 percent
from the field on the half, however, the Car
dinal embarked on a furious 10-2 run that
closed the gap to 33-29 at intermission.
Sophomore forward Bobbie Kelsey led
the way back for Stanford, contributing 12
of her team-high 23 points in the first 20
minutes and eight in the closing surge.
"I was very pleased with the play of Bob
bie Kelsey," Van Derveer said.
Junior guard Kate Paye also wreaked
havoc on the Lady Raiders before the break,
coming off the bench to kick in all nine of
her points, record most of her team-high
eight assists and create four Texas Tech
turnovers with her trademark tenacity on
defense.
The Cardinal knotted the score
at 33 shortly after play resumed,
but the Lady Raiders regained
control on an Atkins lay-in and
extended their advantage to as
many as seven points and trailed
just once the rest of the way.
"I thought we came back well
in the first half, but then we had
some foul problems with our post
people in the second half," Van-
Derveer said.
Indeed, even though junior
center Anita Kaplan (18 points

and a team-high eight rebounds
on the afternoon) and junior for
ward Rachel Hemmer (eight
points, six rebounds) recorded 22
of Stanford's 39 second-half
points, both were whistled for
their fourth fouls early in the peri
od. This left the path to the basket
open for Atkins, a versatile 6-foot -
1 post player who tallied a stag
gering 18 points in the frame.
Yet the final nail in the Cardi
nal coffin was driven by Tech
guard Nikki Heath, who drilled a
pair of 18-foot jumpers to break
deadlocks at 63 and 65 in the clos
ing minutes.
"It came down to some clutch
shooting on Texas Tech's part,

and we made a few mistakes of
our own," VanDerveer concluded.
Stanford will try to work
through its mistakes tonight in
Salt City, when they face the
Runnin' Utes of Utah (0-1) at the
hallowed Huntsman Center. The
Utes, coming off a rout at the
hands of Western Kentucky last
week, return three starters to a
Western Athletic Conference run
ner-up squad, but suffer from the
loss of 1993 WAC Player of the
Year Mikke Kane-Burton to grad
uation.
