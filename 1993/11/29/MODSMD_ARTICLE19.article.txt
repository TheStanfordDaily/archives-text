### Greg Collins Staff writer 
lan Sawyers, who guided the
women's soccer team this sea
son to a No. 2 ranking, a school
record 18 wins and its first-ever
Final Four berth, has been pro
moted to head coach on a perma
nent basis, according to Senior
Athletic Director Cheryl Levick.
Sawyers, named interim
coach just a few weeks before

the start of the
1993 season,
had been the
assistant coach
for two years
under Berhane
Andeberhahn.
"Lan has earn
ed the respect of
the Athletics De
partment throu-

gh his hard work and dedication to
the Stanford women's soccer pro

gram," said Levick. "We are proud
to add him as the |women's soccer
head coach)."
Over Sawyers' three-year
span as a member of the Cardi
nal's coaching staff, Stanford
has posted a 52-6-3 record, rea
ching the Western Regional
Finals twice and the Final Four
once.
"This is the culmination of an
emotional week," said Sawyers.
"I want to thank the Stanford

Athletics Department for its
support of the players and
myself during the season We are
going to continue working hard
to sustain the continuity and
stability of our success of Stan
ford's women's soccer in future
years.
"This is a huge thrill to be a
permanent member of the Stan
ford coaching family."
Stanford's season ended
abruptly in the national semifi

nals last weekend, when the
Cardinal was upset by George
Mason in a quadruple-overtime
game decided by penalty kicks.
Although Stanford will lose
all-time school scoring leader
Sarah Rafanelli to graduation,
every other player who saw
action this year is expected to
return for next season. The Car
dinal also loses senior Anita
Koshy, who was out the entire
season with a knee injury.
