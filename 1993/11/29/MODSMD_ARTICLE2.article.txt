# Gould on hold
## Prof's nomination to labor board stalled by Republican filibuster 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
Law Prof. William Gould's
nomination to chair the National
Labor Relations Board stalled in
the Senate last week after a suc
cessful filibuster on the eve of Con
gress' adjournment.
Republicans and some south
ern Democrats caused the delay,
expressing strong opposition to
the nominee's apparent "pro
union" stance. But many of
Gould's supporters, brushing
aside the objections, are still confi
dent he will be confirmed when the
Senate meets again next year.
"Professor Gould is a person of
enormous stature, and my guess is
that, when the Senate reconvenes
in .January, there will be no prob
lems," said Hadley Roff, a
spokesperson for Sen. Dianne Fe
instein.
Roff attributed the delay to the
Senate's packed agenda, which in
cluded such measures as the Brady

gun-control bill and the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
Gould also remains confident of
his confirmation, despite the post
ponement. "When the majority is
allowed to make their decision, I
will be confirmed," he said. If con
firmed, Gould would be the first
African-American to head the
labor panel.
In explaining why he thought
the delay occurred, Gould ac
knowledged the staunch opposi
tion he faces. "There is a campaign
of character assassination and lies
from elements of the Republican
party as well as Washington busi
nesses. There is a tabloid press
saying I am trying to diminish em
ployer rights," he said. "But I am
an impartial, neutral labor [ar
biter!. "
In the closing hours of the Sen
ate, Republicans voiced strong ob
jections to (iould's nomination,
saying they wanted to consider
other candidates, according to
Bradley Cameron, director of gov

ernment relations for the Labor
Policy Association, a group of
human resource officers in For
tune 500 companies. When the
White House refused their re
quest, they launched a filibuster.
"If the White House continues
to be unwilling to negotiate, it will
kill the nomination," Cameron
added.
He predicts that "the dynamics
will be the same" regarding the
nomination when the Senate re


William Gould
convenes.
Throughout Gould's confirma
tion process, Republicans have
objected to his "union-friendly"
views, while Democrats have said
that his leadership would remain
even-handed. The recent publica
tion of Gould's book "Agenda for

Reform" has added to the debate.
The book, which sets forth
views that Cameron says are
"extreme and very much out of
the mainstream," has caused con
cern among some people about his
suitability for the chairmanship.
However, Law School Dean Paul
Brest, said Gould "is an extremely
fair-minded person and anything
but radical. The argument that he
will dominate the NLRB with one
sided views is wrong."

Gould also considers himself a
moderate. "How could I not be,
when I'm acceptable to both
laborers and management?"
Cameron recognized Gould's
assertion that he would remain
unbiased, but still doubts his
objectivity. "People have a lot of
respect for Gould, and he appears
to be very pleasant, but his appar
ent inability to remain objective
makes the stakes too big in a coun
try trying to remain competitive."
