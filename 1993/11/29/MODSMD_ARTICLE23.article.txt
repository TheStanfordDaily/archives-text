The 1993 Division I Women's
Volleyball Championship Brack
et was announced last night.
The sixth-ranked Stanford Car
dinal (21-6) was given the fourth
seed in the West Region, and was
thereby ensured of a first-round
bye and a second-round match at
Stanford.
The tournament was expand
ed from 32 to 48 teams this year,
and is organized into four regions

of 12 teams apiece.
The top-ranked UCLA Bruins
are the No. 1 seed in the West
Region. Meanwhile, other No.
l's include UC-Santa Barbara in
the Mideast, Long Beach State
in the Northwest and Texas in
the South.
The tournament's "Sweet Six
teen" (the third and fourth
rounds) will most likely be held at
UCLA, Nebraska, Long Beach and
Texas, with the regional winners
moving on to the Final Four at
Madison, Wis., on Dec. 16-18.

The defending NCAA champi
on Cardinal will play the winner
of the USC (21-8) / Radford (25-
10) match this Saturday at
Maples Pavilion.
While Radford is unranked in
the Coaches' Poll, the Trojans
hold down the 13th spot and are
heavily favored to defeat the
Highlanders in this Wednesday's
match.
A win on Saturday will proba
bly send the Cardinal to Pauley
Pavilion to face UCLA (28-1) on
Dec. 9th.
