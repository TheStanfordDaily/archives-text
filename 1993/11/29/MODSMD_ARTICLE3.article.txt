## Catgut Society gives Stanford archives on instrument-building 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
An obscure musical organi
zation called the Catgut Acousti
cal Society is serving up some
thing tasty to Stanford music re
searchers' appetites — the soci
ety's "enormously rich"
archives full of information and
history of the instrument crafts
man's art.
"Its value extends beyond the
obvious and beyond the current
lifetimes of us to many, many
people," said Music Prof. John
Chowning, the director of the
Stanford Center for Computer
Research in Music and
Acoustics.
The Catgut Acoustical Soci

New Jersey instrument maker
and researcher Carleen
Hutchins, is an organization
searching for scientific methods
to make instruments. Particu

mine the procedure for creating
an instrument equal or superior
to the one considered the pinna

cle of achievement in violins, the
Stradivarius.
The Catgut in the society's
name refers to the material used
to make the strings for instru
ments in the 1500s. Although
the catgut itself is now obsolete
— sheep and pigs' intestines
are now the materials of choice
— the name for the society
stuck.
The archive "has all sorts of
musical information interesting
to violin makers . . . and people
who want to understand how vi
olins work," said Max Mathews,
longtime friend of Hutchins and
engineer-musician at the com
puter music research center. "It
also has information on wind
and brass."
In addition, Chowning and
Mathews said the acquisition of
the instrument-making ar
chives to Stanford makes the
school more attractive as a site
for other archives.
"It absolutely draws more
archives to the school," Chown
