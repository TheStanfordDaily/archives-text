# Volumes on violins
## Catgut Society gives Stanford archives on instrument-building 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
An obscure musical organi
zation called the Catgut Acousti
cal Society is serving up some
thing tasty to Stanford music re
searchers' appetites — the soci
ety's "enormously rich"
archives full of information and
history of the instrument crafts
man's art.
"Its value extends beyond the
obvious and beyond the current
lifetimes of us to many, many
people," said Music Prof. John
Chowning, the director of the
Stanford Center for Computer
Research in Music and
Acoustics.
The Catgut Acoustical Soci
ety, founded 30 years ago by
New Jersey instrument maker
and researcher Carleen
Hutchins, is an organization
searching for scientific methods
to make instruments. Particu
larly, the society aims to deter
mine the procedure for creating
an instrument equal or superior
to the one considered the pinna

cle of achievement in violins, the
Stradivarius.
The Catgut in the society's
name refers to the material used
to make the strings for instru
ments in the 1500s. Although
the catgut itself is now obsolete
— sheep and pigs' intestines
are now the materials of choice
— the name for the society
stuck.
The archive "has all sorts of
musical information interesting
to violin makers . . . and people
who want to understand how vi
olins work," said Max Mathews,
longtime friend of Hutchins and
engineer-musician at the com
puter music research center. "It
also has information on wind
and brass."
In addition, Chowning and
Mathews said the acquisition of
the instrument-making ar
chives to Stanford makes the
school more attractive as a site
for other archives.
"It absolutely draws more
archives to the school," Chown
ing said. "We also have a network
that's available for the archives to
be on-line."
The archives, 10 filing cabinets
in all, will be brought here in
stages, at no cost to the Universi
ty, and will be catalogued on Stan
ford's computers.
The first installation arrived last
spring at The Knoll, the location of
the computer music center and the
archives' future home. The cata

loguing of the archives, a daunting
and time-consuming task, will be
done by graduate students in the
field. Hutchins is currently working
to establish a fellowship for the job.
According to Mathews,
Hutchins wanted to find a good
place to move the archives from
her New Jersey home so anybody
could use them. In addition, Math
ews said that for Hutchins, hous
ing her work at Stanford for pos
terity holds two real advantages.
"First there was [the center],
which has people with both musi
cal and scientific training," Math
ews said. "Also, we have a very

excellent collection of violins,
including some of hers, in the
Music Department."
The archives represent the life's
work of Hutchins, 82, a pioneer in
the field of research in instrument
making. They began as papers pre
sented at Catgut Acoustical Society
meetings and grew to include
clipped articles, correspondence,
journals and photographs.
Within the archives are
Hutchins' original research as well
as a focused and extensive collec
tion of articles on the making of
many different instruments.
Hutchins founded the society

some 30 years ago, after an article
she had written for Scientific
American relating the evolution of
the modern violin from its prede
cessor, the gamba, provoked
curiosity for her research.
Mathews added that Hutchins
and her research changed the way
violin-making was viewed.
"In the past, violin-making has
been from the heart, and she
wanted to find a scientific basis
that could be written down and
taught," Mathews said.
"She's the most important per
son in the world in making vio
lins," Mathews said.
