# Education programs merge
## Move to reduce administrative burden on faculty 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
The School of Education is
merging three academic area com
mittees, the school's equivalent of
departments, in an effort to in
crease course offerings in interna
tional education and streamline
administrative duties.
According to Assoc. Dean of
Academic Affairs Myra Strober,
the Social Sciences in Education
(SSE) area committee absorbed
the International Development
Education area committee (IDE)
at the beginning of fall quarter.
The remaining committee, Ad
ministration and Policy Analysis
(APA), will join with the combined
committees during winter quarter
to form one large committee,
which has not yet been named.
"The desire to bring interna
tional issues into other programs
I precipitated the merger),"
Strober said.
"We're a small faculty. . . .
We're divided into groups that
aren't optimal for our students —

particularly both APA and SSE
students want to be more involved
in international education," she
said. "Students outside these two
areas weren't able to take as many
international education courses as
they wanted to."
The School of Education needs
to "reconstitute the international
education courses so they involve
more people teaching them," said
Prof. Martin Carnoy, the chair of
the IDE area committee and mem
ber of the merger committee.
Combining different programs
could open up this possibility, he
said.
Carnoy said the consolidation
also stemmed from a desire to
downsize the school's administra
tion.
In addition, the move serves to
"provide an impetus for taking a
new look at all our curriculum,"
Strober said. It provides "an excit
ing time with new opportunities
for intellectual growth," she
added.
She said the consolidation will
probably not result in any signifi

cant financial benefit or loss to the
school.
An ad hoc committee, chaired
by Strober, consisting of 10 facul
ty members and students has met
three times to discuss the merger,
which involves two of the school's
largest areas — social sciences and
policy analysis.
When the transition is complet
ed, the academic programs that
are overseen by the area commit
tees "will function pretty much
the same way they do now, acade
mically speaking," Carnoy said.
But the merger "will reduce the
amount of time spent on adminis
tering these programs," he said.
For example, faculty members felt
they could not devote adequate
time to the committees on which
they serve. Each of the approxi
mately 40 education school faculty
members serves on two or three
area committees.
"There was a critical mass of
faculty members that weren't on
duty enough to staff three differ
