# Education programs merge
## Move to reduce administrative burden on faculty 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
The School of Education is
merging three academic area com
mittees, the school's equivalent of
departments, in an effort to in
crease course offerings in interna
tional education and streamline
administrative duties.
According to Assoc. Dean of
Academic Affairs Myra Strober,
the Social Sciences in Education
(SSE) area committee absorbed
the International Development
Education area committee (IDE)
at the beginning of fall quarter.
The remaining committee, Ad
ministration and Policy Analysis
(APA), will join with the combined
committees during winter quarter
to form one large committee,
which has not yet been named.
"The desire to bring interna
tional issues into other programs
I precipitated the merger),"
Strober said.
"We're a small faculty. . . .
We're divided into groups that
aren't optimal for our students —

particularly both APA and SSE
students want to be more involved
in international education," she
said. "Students outside these two
areas weren't able to take as many
international education courses as
they wanted to."
The School of Education needs
to "reconstitute the international
education courses so they involve
more people teaching them," said
Prof. Martin Carnoy, the chair of
the IDE area committee and mem
ber of the merger committee.
Combining different programs
could open up this possibility, he
said.
Carnoy said the consolidation
also stemmed from a desire to
downsize the school's administra
tion.
In addition, the move serves to
"provide an impetus for taking a
new look at all our curriculum,"
Strober said. It provides "an excit
ing time with new opportunities
for intellectual growth," she
added.
She said the consolidation will
probably not result in any signifi

cant financial benefit or loss to the
school.
An ad hoc committee, chaired
by Strober, consisting of 10 facul
ty members and students has met
three times to discuss the merger,
which involves two of the school's
largest areas — social sciences and
policy analysis.
When the transition is complet
ed, the academic programs that
are overseen by the area commit
tees "will function pretty much
the same way they do now, acade
mically speaking," Carnoy said.
But the merger "will reduce the
amount of time spent on adminis
tering these programs," he said.
For example, faculty members felt
they could not devote adequate
time to the committees on which
they serve. Each of the approxi
mately 40 education school faculty
members serves on two or three
area committees.
"There was a critical mass of
faculty members that weren't on
duty enough to staff three differ
ent committees," said doctoral
student Lee Anderson, a member
of the merger committee. "[They
wanted] an administrative unit
that is more efficient in use of the
members."
The loss of several faculty
members to leaves of absence also
left open many positions on the
committees, which became diffi
cult to fill.
In addition to increased aca
demic flexibility and reduced
administrative duties, the merger
will allow the programs to be
"more interactive with one
another," Strober said.
By combining the committees,
"we'll be able to do joint planning
and research preparation for our
students," Strober said. Offering
team-taught, issue-oriented
classes will also become a possi
bility because these kind of class
es deal with several areas.
Cassie Guarino — an APA stu
dent who is a member of the
Committee of Area Representa
tives, a committee of student rep
resentatives on the various area
committees — said the merger
"makes sense in what we all
study. There's a lot of overlap in
the content."

Some students, however, are
not as supportive of the move to

consolidate area committees. The
merger won't provide "any clear,
coherent direction and mentor
ship possibilities," said Seth Pol
lack, an IDE student and Com
mittee of Area Representatives
member.
"By merging the committees,
it blurs the distinction between
programs . . . You get a mush," he
said.
Admissions to the school will
probably not change very much
due to the merger, except that
applicants from the three areas
will now be in one pool, school
officials said.
"There will be further differ
entiation of student interests
later on [in the processl," Ander
son said.
Area committees, which
Strober says are "almost like
departments," function to over
see the various academic pro
grams. Six to 15 faculty mem
bers, along with a few student
representatives, sit on each com
mittee. Committees meet once a
month and deal with such issues
as curriculum, students' needs,
recruitment of faculty and other
issues.
The merger will bring the total
number of area committees from
six to four. The other committees
are: Language, Literacy and Cul
ture; Psychological Studies in
Education; and Curriculum and
Teacher Evaluation.

are overseen by the area commit
tees "will function pretty much
the same way they do now, acade
mically speaking," Carnoy said.
But the merger "will reduce the
amount of time spent on adminis
tering these programs," he said.
For example, faculty members felt
they could not devote adequate
time to the committees on which
they serve. Each of the approxi
mately 40 education school faculty
members serves on two or three
area committees.
"There was a critical mass of
faculty members that weren't on
duty enough to staff three differ
ent committees," said doctoral
student Lee Anderson, a member
of the merger committee. "[They
wanted] an administrative unit
that is more efficient in use of the
members."
The loss of several faculty
members to leaves of absence also
left open many positions on the
committees, which became diffi
cult to fill.
In addition to increased aca
demic flexibility and reduced
administrative duties, the merger
will allow the programs to be
"more interactive with one
another," Strober said.
By combining the committees,
"we'll be able to do joint planning
and research preparation for our
students," Strober said. Offering
team-taught, issue-oriented
classes will also become a possi
bility because these kind of class
es deal with several areas.
Cassie Guarino — an APA stu
dent who is a member of the
Committee of Area Representa
tives, a committee of student rep
resentatives on the various area
committees — said the merger
"makes sense in what we all
study. There's a lot of overlap in
the content."

Some students, however, are
not as supportive of the move to

consolidate area committees. The
merger won't provide "any clear,
coherent direction and mentor
ship possibilities," said Seth Pol
lack, an IDE student and Com
mittee of Area Representatives
member.
"By merging the committees,
it blurs the distinction between
programs . . . You get a mush," he
said.
Admissions to the school will
probably not change very much
due to the merger, except that
applicants from the three areas
will now be in one pool, school
officials said.
"There will be further differ
entiation of student interests
later on [in the processl," Ander
son said.
Area committees, which
Strober says are "almost like
departments," function to over
see the various academic pro
grams. Six to 15 faculty mem
bers, along with a few student
representatives, sit on each com
mittee. Committees meet once a
month and deal with such issues
as curriculum, students' needs,
recruitment of faculty and other
issues.
The merger will bring the total
number of area committees from
six to four. The other committees
are: Language, Literacy and Cul
ture; Psychological Studies in
Education; and Curriculum and
Teacher Evaluation.
The School of Education is
merging three academic area com
mittees, the school's equivalent of
departments, in an effort to in
crease course offerings in interna
tional education and streamline
administrative duties.
According to Assoc. Dean of
Academic Affairs Myra Strober,
the Social Sciences in Education
(SSE) area committee absorbed
the International Development
Education area committee (IDE)
at the beginning of fall quarter.
The remaining committee, Ad
ministration and Policy Analysis
(APA), will join with the combined
committees during winter quarter
to form one large committee,
which has not yet been named.
"The desire to bring interna
tional issues into other programs
I precipitated the merger),"
Strober said.
"We're a small faculty. . . .
We're divided into groups that
aren't optimal for our students —

particularly both APA and SSE
students want to be more involved
in international education," she
said. "Students outside these two
areas weren't able to take as many
international education courses as
they wanted to."
The School of Education needs
to "reconstitute the international
education courses so they involve
more people teaching them," said
Prof. Martin Carnoy, the chair of
the IDE area committee and mem
ber of the merger committee.
Combining different programs
could open up this possibility, he
said.
Carnoy said the consolidation
also stemmed from a desire to
downsize the school's administra
tion.
In addition, the move serves to
"provide an impetus for taking a
new look at all our curriculum,"
Strober said. It provides "an excit
ing time with new opportunities
for intellectual growth," she
added.
She said the consolidation will
probably not result in any signifi

cant financial benefit or loss to the
school.
An ad hoc committee, chaired
by Strober, consisting of 10 facul
ty members and students has met
three times to discuss the merger,
which involves two of the school's
largest areas — social sciences and
policy analysis.
When the transition is complet
ed, the academic programs that
are overseen by the area commit
tees "will function pretty much
the same way they do now, acade
mically speaking," Carnoy said.
But the merger "will reduce the
