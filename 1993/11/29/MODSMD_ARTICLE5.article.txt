# Good Samaritans help peers with laundry
## 
### Heather Carlson 
You've got three papers and five problem sets due
by noon tomorrow. You haven't showered in almost a
week. Classes and meetings lie forgotten, along with
the six or seven food service trays stacked by the door.
And just when things can't possibly get any worse, you
realize . . . you don't have any clean underwear.
Not to worry, seniors Valerie Chang and Erica Don
will do your laundry for you — for free. They'll even
fold it.
Chang and Don, with the help of others from the
Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship, started a free laun
dry service at Stern Hall this quarter in an effort to
tackle the issue of student stress.
"The point of the service is to get people's laundry
done so that they can do their work," Chang said.
Rather than making the rounds at local soup
kitchens and homeless shelters, the duo chose to take
their goodwill into the campus laundry rooms because
they wanted to perform public service specifically
within the Stanford community.
"It's humbling to serve your peers," Don said.
There is a certain freedom in doing something for
someone and requiring nothing in return, she added.
With the help of 17 other volunteers from the fel
lowship, the team has washed more than 40 loads of
laundry this quarter. They started advertising with
fliers in Stern Hall during the second week of classes,
and received calls promptly the next day, Chang said.
"I called because I thought it was a joke," said Olivia
Wang, a freshman in Donner who had her laundry
done by the service. "I was sure they'd ask for some
thing."
Although Wang felt somewhat guilty about having

other students do her dirty work,
she said she was impressed by the
service.
"I had a lot of respect for the
people who came," Wang said.
"They were happy to do it, and it
did help me get a lot of work done
that I couldn't have done sitting in
the laundry room."
When a student calls with laun
dry needs, Chang or Don dispatch
es one of their volunteer washing
crews, which are each scheduled to
be on call one day a week.
Volunteers work in pairs and
pay for the washer and dryer them
selves. Typically, each volunteer

spends about a dollar a. week —
plus the cost of detergent, Don said.
The service can handle about 18
loads a week, Chang said, but
demand has been irregular, rang
ing from as few as four requests to
as many as 14 — during midterms.
The service has also been more
popular among male students. For
every 11 men who call, there are
about three women, Don noted.
"Boxers are no problem, but
tighty-whiteys are amusing," said
seniQr Louisa Gomez, another pro
gram participant.
Despite the apparent simplicity
of the task, doing laundry has chal
lenged some of the volunteers in
unexpected ways.
"The hardest part is trying to
do all the special folds for different
clothing," explained sophomore

Joe Palmer. "Shirts are the hard
est." Palmer, who is used to fold
ing his shirts in half, had to learn
to fold shirts "the Gap way,"
because the laundry service wants
to enforce a standard of quality.
Volunteers say they do not par
ticipate in the program merely to
be "doers-of-good."
"I'm on a quest for spiritual
fulfillment," Chang said. "And I
think it's about doing people's
laundry when I have research to
do and papers to write." Both she
and Don said they felt that Jesus
served people in simple ways, and
they want to live out that example.
But after five weeks of doing
laundry, they also question the
impact they are having. Since the
service was created to alleviate
students' stress, "we don't want it

to be used by people who are just
being lazy," Don said.
Chang and Don are now
attracting fewer new callers and
more regulars.
The group is thinking about
expanding their laundry service to
other dorms like Wilbur Hall or
Florence Moore Hall next quarter.
Chang and Don have also initiat
ed other on-campus service projects.
For example, they recently
organized a "Garbage Collecting
Party" in which fellowship volun
teers walked through dorms with
large blue trash bags and offered
to empty students' trash cans.
Don said they are also planning
to set up a food table outside of
Green Library during Dead Week,
to offer students free snacks while
they are studying for finals.

served people in simple ways, and
they want to live out that example.
But after five weeks of doing
laundry, they also question the
impact they are having. Since the
service was created to alleviate
students' stress, "we don't want it

to be used by people who are just
being lazy," Don said.
Chang and Don are now
attracting fewer new callers and
more regulars.
The group is thinking about
expanding their laundry service to
other dorms like Wilbur Hall or
Florence Moore Hall next quarter.
Chang and Don have also initiat
ed other on-campus service projects.
For example, they recently
organized a "Garbage Collecting
Party" in which fellowship volun
teers walked through dorms with
large blue trash bags and offered
to empty students' trash cans.
Don said they are also planning
to set up a food table outside of
Green Library during Dead Week,
to offer students free snacks while
they are studying for finals.
You've got three papers and five problem sets due
by noon tomorrow. You haven't showered in almost a
week. Classes and meetings lie forgotten, along with
the six or seven food service trays stacked by the door.
And just when things can't possibly get any worse, you
realize . . . you don't have any clean underwear.
Not to worry, seniors Valerie Chang and Erica Don
will do your laundry for you — for free. They'll even
fold it.
Chang and Don, with the help of others from the
Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship, started a free laun
dry service at Stern Hall this quarter in an effort to
tackle the issue of student stress.
"The point of the service is to get people's laundry
done so that they can do their work," Chang said.
Rather than making the rounds at local soup
kitchens and homeless shelters, the duo chose to take
their goodwill into the campus laundry rooms because
they wanted to perform public service specifically
within the Stanford community.
"It's humbling to serve your peers," Don said.
There is a certain freedom in doing something for
someone and requiring nothing in return, she added.
With the help of 17 other volunteers from the fel
lowship, the team has washed more than 40 loads of
laundry this quarter. They started advertising with
fliers in Stern Hall during the second week of classes,
and received calls promptly the next day, Chang said.
"I called because I thought it was a joke," said Olivia
Wang, a freshman in Donner who had her laundry
done by the service. "I was sure they'd ask for some
thing."
Although Wang felt somewhat guilty about having

other students do her dirty work,
she said she was impressed by the
service.
"I had a lot of respect for the
people who came," Wang said.
"They were happy to do it, and it
did help me get a lot of work done
that I couldn't have done sitting in
the laundry room."
When a student calls with laun
dry needs, Chang or Don dispatch
es one of their volunteer washing
crews, which are each scheduled to
be on call one day a week.
Volunteers work in pairs and
pay for the washer and dryer them
selves. Typically, each volunteer

spends about a dollar a. week —
plus the cost of detergent, Don said.
The service can handle about 18
loads a week, Chang said, but
demand has been irregular, rang
ing from as few as four requests to
as many as 14 — during midterms.
The service has also been more
popular among male students. For
every 11 men who call, there are
about three women, Don noted.
"Boxers are no problem, but
tighty-whiteys are amusing," said
seniQr Louisa Gomez, another pro
gram participant.
Despite the apparent simplicity
of the task, doing laundry has chal
lenged some of the volunteers in
unexpected ways.
"The hardest part is trying to
do all the special folds for different
clothing," explained sophomore

Joe Palmer. "Shirts are the hard
est." Palmer, who is used to fold
ing his shirts in half, had to learn
to fold shirts "the Gap way,"
because the laundry service wants
to enforce a standard of quality.
Volunteers say they do not par
ticipate in the program merely to
be "doers-of-good."
"I'm on a quest for spiritual
fulfillment," Chang said. "And I
think it's about doing people's
laundry when I have research to
do and papers to write." Both she
and Don said they felt that Jesus
