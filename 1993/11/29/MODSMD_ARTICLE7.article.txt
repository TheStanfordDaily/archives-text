Jordan backs Hussein

AMMAN, Jordan (AP) â€” Jordan's
Parliament backed King Hussein's
efforts to make peace with Israel but said
yesterday that no settlement was possible
until the Palestinians regain their lost
territory.
A letter from parliament to Hussein
carefully avoided specifying the territo
ries that should be returned to the Pales
tin icins.
"We highly appreciate your majesty's
repeated calls for a just and comprehen
sive peace that cannot be achieved before
the Palestinian land returns to its own
ers," the letter said.
Most of the 16 deputies representing
Jordan's Muslim Brotherhood voted to
support the letter, the closest the funda

mentalists have ever come to endorsing
the Middle East peace process.
Workplace deaths studied
WASHINGTON (AP) - Murder was
the leading cause of workplace death in
five states and the District of Columbia
during the 1980s, according to the first
federal study to pinpoint workplace fatal
ities by state.
Of the 7,60,'i Americans slain on the job
in the last decade, 985 were murdered in
Alabama, Connecticut, Maryland, Michi
gan, South Carolina and Washington, I).C.
New York doesn't tabulate on-the-job
homicide, but the National Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health estimated
its toll at 867. If accurate, that would make
New York the capital of workplace murder.
