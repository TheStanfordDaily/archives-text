# Elders urges K-12 health education

WASHINGTON (AP) - Compre
hensive health education from kinder
garten through 12th grade is crucial to
reducing the numbers of children born
out of wedlock, Surgeon General Joyce
lyn Elders said yesterday.
Schools teach driver's education, "but
when we come to health education,
which includes sexuality education, we
refuse to teach (hem that," Elders said
on ABC's "This Week with David Brink
ley."
"A major cause of children dying is
really related to many of the social
problems impacting their health, so I
really feel we need to have a compre
hensive health education program in
our schools from kindergarten through
12th grade. This is the equalizer," she
said.
Elders said health education must
include the entire spectrum of social

issues including drugs, alcohol, sex and
violence. "It's not going in there and
giving them a plumbing lesson. I feel
that's a waste of time." She said only 5
percent of public schools now have com
prehensive programs.
Elders, who as the former top health
official in Arkansas was outspoken on
the need to provide condoms to sexually
active teenagers, said that while contra
ceptives should be made available, "if
you don't have the education I could go
out and throw condoms up in the air
and let them rain."
She noted that 85 percent of children
from upper and middle-income families
receive early childhood education, but
only 18 percent of children on welfare.
"They're the ones who absolutely need
it the most."
Charles Murray of the American
Enterprise Institute, appearing on the

same show, blamed the welfare system
for the sharp rise in single mothers.
"You lift the economic burden, social
stigma goes down," he said.
The Clinton administration has
promised welfare reform, and the New
York Times reported yesterday that one
plan being considered is to give corpora
tions up to $5,000 for every welfare
recipient they hire.
Donna Shalala, secretary of health
and human services, said no options on
welfare reform have been presented to
President Clinton.
Sixty-seven percent of black children
were born out of wedlock last year, up
from 49 percent a decade earlier. White
children with single mothers accounted
for 17 percent of the total, up from 10 per
cent in 1982, while the rate went up from
16 to 27 percent for Hispanics in that
period.
