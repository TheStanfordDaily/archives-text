BATMAN'S BEST FRIEND ISNT
ON THE STREETS TONIGHT
People said that Commissioner Gordon had heart. He was a tough cop, and proud of it.
Eating right, exercise, vacations—those things were for guys not so tough.
Tobacco was part of it. A smoke would jump-start the day, help
him get through a long night, mellow out the bad hours.
Then one day all the pain in the world collected in his chest and squeezed.
Jim Gordon's heart wasn't working right anymore. That made
it hard to be tough. And even harder to be proud.

A MESSAGE FROM PHI BETA KAPPA, STANFORD CHAPTER
Membership in Phi Beta Kappa, the nationwide honorary society, is open to Stanford
undergraduates from all majors. Election to the Stanford chapter is an honor conferred
upon students for their scholarship in the liberal arts.
To be elected to Phi Beta Kappa at Stanford, a student must achieve academic
distinction in the major as well as in courses across the broad range of fields. Normally, a
student will not be considered to have met the breadth standard if he or she has not
satisfied all the Distribution Requirements by the time elections to the Stanford chapter
are held, early in the spring quarter. In its evaluation of the breadth of a student's
program of study, the selection committee looks for achievement beyond the beginning
level in areas outside the major. A grade of "+" is not considered a sign of distinction.
The academic records of all students are automatically reviewed, so no special action is
required for students wishing to be considered for membership. Anonymity in the
election process is ensured by removal of students' names from their academic records
before consideration. Students who desire that their records not be made available for
consideration by the Stanford chapter of Phi Beta Kappa should inform the Registrar,
Room 133, Old Union.
