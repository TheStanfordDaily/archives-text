## Education school seeks new dean 
### Jennifer Rosen 
The School of Education is
launching a nationwide search for
a new dean to replace former dean
Marshall Smith, who joined the
Clinton administration earlier
this year.
A search committee composed
of eight faculty members and
three students will publicly an
nounce the job opening tomorrow.
They hope to finalize their deci
sion by the end of the academic
year, according to Prof. Michael
Kirst, a committee member. Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper, however, will make the
final selection.
Smith took a leave of absence
from the faculty and resigned as
dean in March when he was
named undersecretary of educa
tion in the Clinton administra
tion. Acting Dean Nel Noddings'
term expires August 1994.
Kirst said he foresees an "ag
gressive (recruitment) cam
paign," and committee members
expect a large applicant pool.
The committee, co-chaired by
Provost Condoleezza Rice and Ed
ucation Prof. Lee Schulman,
plans to advertise in local newspa
pers and actively nominate indi
viduals.
It also plans to invite deans
from reputable universities, as
well as federal and state officials
to apply for the job. In addition, it
will contact well-placed people to
recommend others who might be
interested in applying, Kirst said.
The committee will welcome
applicants from both inside and
outside Stanford. However, the
past two School of Education
deans have come from outside the
University. Myron Atkin had
been the education dean at the
University of Illinois, while Smith
had been the education dean at
the University of Wisconsin
before coming to Stanford.
Although the School of Educa
tion is functioning smoothly
under Noddings' leadership, she
said she does not yet know if she
wants to apply for the permanent
position.

Kirst said the search commit
tee has not yet specified exact
qualifications it is looking for in
the applicants. The committee
will first examine important
issues that the school will face in
the future, and then decide on the
attributes of the ideal candidate,
he said.
"We are sending out letters to
faculty soliciting their input [on
the important issues facing the
school]," said Assistant Provost
Ann Fletcher, who is assisting the
committee. From these com
ments and suggestions, the com
mittee will then determine the
qualities it is seeking in the
school's next dean.

Fletcher said the candidate
would have to have an "outstand
ing scholarly career" and demon
strate top academic leadership
abilities.
Once the attributes have been
compiled, the committee will then
recommend to Casper the candi
date or candidates who best
demonstrates the ability to fulfill
such requirements.
The committee includes facul
ty members Jon Baugh, Patricia
Gumport, Kenji Hakuta, Iris Litt,
Mike Kirst, Lee Schulman and
Richard Scott, Provost Con
doleezza Rice and students
Michael Keating, Judy Powell
and Maureen Porter.
