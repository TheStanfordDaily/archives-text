## Education school seeks new dean 
### Jennifer Rosen 
The School of Education is
launching a nationwide search for
a new dean to replace former dean
Marshall Smith, who joined the
Clinton administration earlier
this year.
A search committee composed
of eight faculty members and
three students will publicly an
nounce the job opening tomorrow.
They hope to finalize their deci
sion by the end of the academic
year, according to Prof. Michael
Kirst, a committee member. Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper, however, will make the
final selection.
Smith took a leave of absence
from the faculty and resigned as
dean in March when he was
named undersecretary of educa
tion in the Clinton administra
tion. Acting Dean Nel Noddings'
term expires August 1994.
Kirst said he foresees an "ag
gressive (recruitment) cam
paign," and committee members
expect a large applicant pool.
The committee, co-chaired by
Provost Condoleezza Rice and Ed
ucation Prof. Lee Schulman,
plans to advertise in local newspa
pers and actively nominate indi
viduals.
It also plans to invite deans
from reputable universities, as
well as federal and state officials
to apply for the job. In addition, it
will contact well-placed people to
recommend others who might be
interested in applying, Kirst said.
The committee will welcome
applicants from both inside and
