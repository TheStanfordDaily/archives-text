## Editorial The 						right medicine A 						three-month increase in clinical training aids Medical School students 
### 
WHILE medical students
may occasionally wage war
against increased curricu
lar demands, their support of a
recent lengthening of clinical train
ing time will prove fruitful in the
end.
The School of Medicine has
made the right decision to extend
clinical requirements to 15 mon
ths, three more than previously
required.
Although three more months of
clinical experience may not seem
substantial, the additional time will
permit Medical School students to
be more balanced graduates, lead
ing to more success in their post
graduate internships, residency and
practice.
Most importantly, the further
clinical experience that is part of
the new requirement will allow
Medical School graduates to better
cope with the greater demands of
internships and resident programs.
Furthermore, the Medical School's
pejorative reputation of being too
research-oriented could be counter
balanced by the addition of this larg
er requirement.
The more clinical experience
students have now, the more capa
ble physicians they will make in
the future. For it is only in clinical
settings that medical students
have the opportunity to experi
ence first-hand the ins-and-outs
of a particular field.
Three more months can only
offer more experiences and more
knowledge that an academic set
ting simply can't provide.
Medical students will also bene
fit from a more balanced educa
tion by learning in depth about a
specific clinical field. These expe
riences can often lead students to
make a more educated choice
among careers or, more common

ly, help them decide that a certain
career is not for them.
An additional benefit of the
lengthened training period is that
the added months of required
clinical experience will not trans
late into less flexibility, a marquee
of Stanford's medical education.
Since students aren't forced to
graduate in four years and can
spend five years or more at the
Medical School, new requirements
shouldn't be seen as a threat to
flexibility, but as a positive addi
tion to what was already an excel
lent program.
The Medical School faculty and
students should also look at this
change as a chance to critically
look at how the new requirements
impact individual students' cur
riculums.
If the impact is positive, there
should be consideration of
increasing the clinical require
ment to 18 months, as was pro
posed before the 15-month com
promise was settled upon.
The 18-month training period
may be unpopular at the moment.
But since the majority of Medical
School students go on to careers in
clinical practice, and the school's
mission, after all, is to train physi
cians, new and future increases in
clinical requirements should be
seen as a positive move, giving more
breadth for students to explore pos
sible career fields.
Moreover, the added months
merely bring Stanford in line with
the clinical training periods re
quired by other leading institu
tions, which generally range from
14-20 months.
There is no disadvantage by
adding more months, and in fact
some students already opt to take
a 15-month training period even
without the mandatory regula
tion.
Balancing the basic sciences
and the clinical sciences is diffi
cult task for a medical school.
Stanford is taking a step in the
right direction toward achieving
an equilibrium between these two
demands by requiring more clini
cal time.
