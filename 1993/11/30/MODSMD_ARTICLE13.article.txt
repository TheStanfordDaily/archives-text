## A 						flatly packaged identity? 
### 
MY STOMACH IS tight and my
palms are sweaty. I feel distinctly
light-headed. Am I sick? No. I am
going through that annual right of pas
sage — graduate school applications.
All quarter I have been laboring on
my personal statement. In 1,000 words
I have explained my life history, my
ambitions, my career goals and my rea
sons for applying to particular schools.
Now all of my work is neatly stacked in
seven large manila envelopes. It is nice
to see that the sum total of my life is so
square and flat.
That is the salient point. My identity
cannot be scribed on a two-page applica
tion and an essay of 1,000 words. I
might not be the most profound person
ality, but I do think that my biography
exceeds three pages. I have written
papers 10 times this length on far more
esoteric subjects. If a professor requires
a 20-page paper to assess my grade in a
class, how can a graduate program
make an intelligent admissions decision
from only three pages?
My feelings of anxiety are character
istic of many within the senior class.
Those applying to law school write an
essay similar in length. Medical sch
ools, in addition to the essay, conduct
short interviews. Not everyone, howev
er, gets invited to an interview. Medical
schools use the square, flat applications
to determine who merits an interview.
Then of course there are those who

plan to enter the work force next year.
These poor souls must fit their entire
personal histories on one-page resumes.
While I have only seen a few resumes, I
must admit that they have a tendency
to look alike. Everyone uses incredibly
small laser-written fonts to list the
names of educational institutions, sum
mer internships and honors received. A
premium seems to be placed upon
names, and not the quality of one's ex
perience.
Along with names, there are num
bers, of course. GRE, LSAT and MCAT
scores, as well as GPAs, are often cited
by applicants and schools. We all know
how subjective these pseudo-objective
standards are. Some people perform
better on fill-in-the-oval exams than
others, and certain classes are easier
than others. There is no uniform grad
ing standard employed by professors,
or the teaching assistants who often do
their grading.
In one respect we shouldn't worry.
By virtue of our admission to Stanford,
we have all proven that we can play this
game very well. This may be one reason
that Stanford graduates are successful
lawyers, doctors, business people and
academics — we have learned to win
the game of square, flat, 1,000-word
admissions.
While I may have filled in my last
GRE oval, I am sure I will have to com
plete many more abridged life histories

in the future. The future does not
sound very exciting.
So, how do we escape the oppression
of manila envelopes? Well, sadly, I
don't think we can. Recruiters and
admission officers do not have the time
and resources to get to know everyone's
complete life story. Instead one has no
choice but to rely upon that favorite
term of political scientists, low-infor
mation rationality. While the admis
sion forms and the standardized tests
may change, they will always provide
small amounts of information from
which thoughtful choices must be made
by schools and employers.
I guess this is one of the many ways
we have become a depersonalized, pack
aged culture. We not only must be qual
ified candidates, we also must be skilled
applicants.
When I mail my applications on
Monday I will breathe a slight sigh of
relief. But, I know, as the days pass, my
stomach will grow tight and my palms
will moisten again. While I have confi
dence in myself, I worry about what is
contained in the square, Hat envelope.
