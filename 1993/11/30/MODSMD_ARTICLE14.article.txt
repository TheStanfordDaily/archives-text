# N'Gai Croal: notes of a non-native son
## 1-8-7 on the mass media-gangsta rap

You can run but you can't hide . . .
from Snoop Doggy Dogg. Before
August, Snoop was known only to
the three million-plus fans who bought
Dr. Dre's album, "The Chronic," as the
man whose lyrics and flow held up Dre's
lack of skills. But cover stories in Rolling
Stone, Vibe and Spin, a solo debut
expected to hit the charts at Number
One with a bullet and a man who hit the
ground with a bullet — fired by Snoop's
bodyguard from a car that he was driving
— changed all that.
It was only after the alleged drive-by
shooting that Newsweek took notice of
Snoop. They jumped on the bandwagon
by putting him on last week's cover, try
ing to put a new spin on it with the title
"When Is Rap 2 Violent?" The accompa
nying article used the examples of
Snoop, Dre and fellow rapper Tupac
Shakur, whose recent encounters with
the law have caused some to speculate
about links between gangsta rap and vio
lent crime.
The article actually exposes the links
between gangsta rap and mainstream
media. Both groups have an interest in
promoting the belief that the music and
reality are connected — one to sell
records, the other to sell magazines.
First, the media. Always looking for a
way to spice up such mundane topics as
violence in the inner city and the new
crime bill, a rapper like Snoop affords th
em the perfect excuse to avoid the issues
and cast crime in solely black terms. In
fact, they kick off the article with an in

terview with a girl from Chicago's Henry
Horner projects, who supplies them with
the necessary quotes to prove that Snoop
is her role model.
Having done that, they can now gen
eralize Snoop as a role model for black
America. They describe his rap as a "cin
ematic deadpan depiction of a ghetto
world where the men sling dope and tote
firearms, and the women are bitches or
'hoes,'" as if this outlook is unique to
gangsta rap.
Sad to say, America views women as
bitches and hoes. Even the most conser
vative statistics show that one in eight
women will be sexually assaulted at least
once in her lifetime. This country also
admires the right kind of criminal — one
armed with a university degree instead
of a gun. How else to explain convicted
insider trader Michael Milken's teaching
assignment at UCLA?
Crime, like rhyme, indeed pays.
The Newsweek saga continues. Kids
love him because he's real, they say, the
perfect way to kick the facts about his
murder charge — and to introduce the
sad story of Tupac "Keep Ya Head Up"
— unless you're in my hotel suite —
Shakur. Having introduced the usual
suspects, they can now bring out those
fine, upstanding black Americans who
denounce gangsta rap: Jesse Jackson,
Rev. Calvin Butts and music critic Stan
ley Crouch. Only at the end of the article
do they drop a real insight, that it's
"shortsighted to hang all the blame on
music when trouble comes around."

That point could have been made
quickly and concisely at the beginning of
the article, leaving a lot of room for some
thing more substantial on violence in the
inner city.
Like why foreign-made AK-475, UZIs
and Glock automatic weapons end up on
the streets when black people don't own
the boats or planes that import them.
Like why we're even talking about gangs
ta rap when the CIA has admitted to
"accidentally" importing drugs that were
sold in our cities. Hut that would deny
them the sexy hook of Snoop Doggy Dogg
on the cover with his best "I don't give a
fuck" face on — the better to sell maga
zines with.
Let's not forget the rappers, whose
sole job once their album is released is to
prove how "hard" they are. Tupac
describes himself as "thuggin' against
the system." Other rappers, like Dre and
Snoop call themselves "real niggaz,"
which implies that they will never sell
out. And some hip-hop journalists claim
that gangsta rap at its best provides a
context for what's going on in the inner
city.
Well the context is this: black people
die every day, and those most at risk of
being killed already know it. Black rap
pers sing about it for an audience that's
75 percent white for their forty pieces of
silver. And a white owned or run media
conglomerate, a la Time-Warner, makes
the real money. All the while, the gov
ernment spends more money on prisons
to house criminals than it does to pre

vent criminality or the "accidental" flow
of drugs into the inner city. That's the
context.
There isn't anything inherently
wrong with gangsta rap; if all were right
with the world, it could just be entertain
ment, like "Goodfellas" or "Terminator
II." But to produce it when black Ameri
ca faces the apocalyptic scourge of drugs
and violence is not to thug against the
system or to be a real nigga. It's to sell
out and produce pornography.
If a handful of black Americans
choose to make money off the suffering
of others by rapping about it — without
intelligently calling the system that pro
duces the suffering into question — we
have to call them out for what they are:
house nigger minstrels. The people who
own the companies that let them pro
duce this music are plantation-owning
massas.
And a mainstream media that criti
cizes gangsta rap in a vacuum, using it to
fan white America's fear of black people,
is nothing but a modern-day overseer.
Now who's willing to write — or rap
— about that?

amoral entertainment industry when it's

denounce gangsta rap: Jesse Jackson,
Rev. Calvin Butts and music critic Stan
ley Crouch. Only at the end of the article
do they drop a real insight, that it's
"shortsighted to hang all the blame on
music when trouble comes around."

That point could have been made
quickly and concisely at the beginning of
the article, leaving a lot of room for some
thing more substantial on violence in the
inner city.
Like why foreign-made AK-475, UZIs
and Glock automatic weapons end up on
the streets when black people don't own
the boats or planes that import them.
Like why we're even talking about gangs
ta rap when the CIA has admitted to
"accidentally" importing drugs that were
sold in our cities. Hut that would deny
them the sexy hook of Snoop Doggy Dogg
on the cover with his best "I don't give a
fuck" face on — the better to sell maga
zines with.
Let's not forget the rappers, whose
sole job once their album is released is to
prove how "hard" they are. Tupac
describes himself as "thuggin' against
the system." Other rappers, like Dre and
Snoop call themselves "real niggaz,"
which implies that they will never sell
out. And some hip-hop journalists claim
that gangsta rap at its best provides a
context for what's going on in the inner
city.
Well the context is this: black people
die every day, and those most at risk of
being killed already know it. Black rap
pers sing about it for an audience that's
75 percent white for their forty pieces of
silver. And a white owned or run media
conglomerate, a la Time-Warner, makes
the real money. All the while, the gov
ernment spends more money on prisons
to house criminals than it does to pre

vent criminality or the "accidental" flow
of drugs into the inner city. That's the
context.
There isn't anything inherently
wrong with gangsta rap; if all were right
with the world, it could just be entertain
ment, like "Goodfellas" or "Terminator
II." But to produce it when black Ameri
ca faces the apocalyptic scourge of drugs
and violence is not to thug against the
system or to be a real nigga. It's to sell
out and produce pornography.
If a handful of black Americans
choose to make money off the suffering
of others by rapping about it — without
intelligently calling the system that pro
duces the suffering into question — we
have to call them out for what they are:
house nigger minstrels. The people who
own the companies that let them pro
duce this music are plantation-owning
massas.
And a mainstream media that criti
cizes gangsta rap in a vacuum, using it to
fan white America's fear of black people,
is nothing but a modern-day overseer.
Now who's willing to write — or rap
— about that?

from Snoop Doggy Dogg. Before
August, Snoop was known only to
the three million-plus fans who bought
Dr. Dre's album, "The Chronic," as the
man whose lyrics and flow held up Dre's
lack of skills. But cover stories in Rolling
Stone, Vibe and Spin, a solo debut
expected to hit the charts at Number
One with a bullet and a man who hit the
ground with a bullet — fired by Snoop's
bodyguard from a car that he was driving
— changed all that.
It was only after the alleged drive-by
shooting that Newsweek took notice of
Snoop. They jumped on the bandwagon
by putting him on last week's cover, try
ing to put a new spin on it with the title
"When Is Rap 2 Violent?" The accompa
nying article used the examples of
Snoop, Dre and fellow rapper Tupac
Shakur, whose recent encounters with
the law have caused some to speculate
about links between gangsta rap and vio
lent crime.
The article actually exposes the links
between gangsta rap and mainstream
media. Both groups have an interest in
promoting the belief that the music and
reality are connected — one to sell
records, the other to sell magazines.
First, the media. Always looking for a
way to spice up such mundane topics as
violence in the inner city and the new
crime bill, a rapper like Snoop affords th
em the perfect excuse to avoid the issues
and cast crime in solely black terms. In
fact, they kick off the article with an in

terview with a girl from Chicago's Henry
Horner projects, who supplies them with
the necessary quotes to prove that Snoop
is her role model.
Having done that, they can now gen
eralize Snoop as a role model for black
America. They describe his rap as a "cin
ematic deadpan depiction of a ghetto
world where the men sling dope and tote
firearms, and the women are bitches or
'hoes,'" as if this outlook is unique to
gangsta rap.
Sad to say, America views women as
bitches and hoes. Even the most conser
vative statistics show that one in eight
women will be sexually assaulted at least
once in her lifetime. This country also
admires the right kind of criminal — one
armed with a university degree instead
of a gun. How else to explain convicted
insider trader Michael Milken's teaching
assignment at UCLA?
Crime, like rhyme, indeed pays.
The Newsweek saga continues. Kids
love him because he's real, they say, the
perfect way to kick the facts about his
murder charge — and to introduce the
sad story of Tupac "Keep Ya Head Up"
— unless you're in my hotel suite —
Shakur. Having introduced the usual
suspects, they can now bring out those
fine, upstanding black Americans who
denounce gangsta rap: Jesse Jackson,
Rev. Calvin Butts and music critic Stan
ley Crouch. Only at the end of the article
