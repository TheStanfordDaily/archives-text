## Beyond the playing fields: rehab for injured athletes 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
It's every athlete's nightmare: a
major injury that will prevent him
or her from competing. Most Car
dinal athletes never have to deal
with injuries more serious than a
sprained ankle or a hip pointer;
yet, for the unfortunate few, a bad
landing or loud popping noise can
mean much more than just a cou
ple days without practicing.
A look at Stanford rosters will
confirm this point. Junior Katie
Clancy will be unable to compete in
gymnastics this season because of
injured cartilage and a torn anteri
or cruciate ligament (ACL). Junior
Brian Retterer will be swimming
with a shoulder that was dislocat
ed last fall and sophomore Dena
Dey will continue rehabilitating
her shin splints while competing in
soccer and track.
All athletes constantly face the
possibility of incurring a major
injury. And, after such an injury
occurs, rehabilitating to a state of
physical well-being can be an ardu
ous, challenging process.
Yet an athlete has the best atti
tude toward rehabilitation, accord
ing to Dr. Michael Fredericson, the
physiatrist for Stanford's men's and
women's track, cross country and
gymnastics and women's soccer.

"That is the fun of working with
Stanford athletes — they are
extremely motivated, will do what
ever it takes to get better and are
healthy, which makes rehabilita
tion easier," Fredericson said.

Overuse injuries, such as ten
donitis, stress fractures and shin
splints, are what Fredericson sees
most frequently. He also witnesses
amenorrhea, the absence of men
struation that can lead to osteo
porosis, and eating disorders.
About 20 percent of his patients
are Stanford athletes, whom he
treats either in the training room
or his sports medicine clinic at
Cowell Student Health Center.
Fredericson works closely with
the coaches and athletic trainers to

come up with a rehabilitation pro
gram for the athletes. Clancy, who
is recovering from recent surgery,
appreciates this team approach.
"This is the best place to reha
bilitate," Clancy said. "We have
really good facilities and support
systems."
Two days before Clancy left
Phoenix, Ariz., for Stanford this
fall, she fell off the uneven bars
and landed on her knee, tearing
the ACL and cartilage in her knee.
Within a few days her muscles
were atrophied, and she could
barely move. Before she could get
surgery, she needed to retrain her
muscles and get her range of
motion back — a process generally
taking four to eight weeks. Yet,
within two weeks, the determined
Clancy was partially bearing her
weight and doing exercises with
the trainers.
Surgery is often thought of as
the "second trauma." Since she
just had surgery, Clancy will be
non-weight bearing for a while and
then on crutches for about three
weeks. She is already doing exer
cises to strengthen her hamstring
and quadriceps and will start to
swim and bike on the aerodyn
when her stitches are removed.
It will take about six to nine
months for Clancy's ligament to
stabilize. In the meantime, she will

still condition and lift weights with
the gymnastics team and gradually
move into working on the bars and
on dance moves. As a junior, Clan
cy is confident she will be rehabili
tated and able to compete next
year.
"It is really hard and frustrat
ing," Clancy said. "Gymnastics is
one of the things I really like.
Besides it being my job, my physi
cal responsibility to compete, I also
have an emotional responsibility to
my team — I want to help them.
"Rehabilitation is painful; it's
not fun. Hut I can't mope and cry
for nine months, I just have to
realize my role on the team is dif
ferent. I can still help them, even if
it's not through competing."
Sport psychiatrists often work
with athletes undergoing rehabili
tation. Other doctors also help the
athletes deal with the emotional
effects of an injury.
Head trainer Standley Scott
said it is important to help injured
athletes set emotional and physical
goals and make sure they are not
doing too little or too much in
rehabilitating their bodies.
Rehabilitation starts within
minutes of an injury, according to
Scott. While recovering through
therapeutic exercise and condition
