## Stanford earns first victory, 59-48

It wasn't pretty, but they'll
take it.
The sixth-ranked Cardinal
women's basketball team, still
struggling to find an identity and
the killer instinct that guided it in
seasons past, found its bearings
last night, just in time to record a
59-48 triumph over Utah before a
sparse crowd of 797 at the Hunts
man Center in Salt Lake City.
With the victory, Stanford evened
its record at 1-1 and kept the
Runnin' Utes (0-2) winless in the
young season.
Sandwiched between Satur
day's narrow defeat at the hands
of defending national champion
Texas Tech and this Friday's
much-anticipated clash with top
ranked Tennessee, the contest
appeared to have less meaning for
the Cardinal than many of its
other early season games. Taking
advantage of Stanford's perceived
lack of motivation, Utah kept the
possibility of an upset alive for
much of the night, trailing only
44-40 with five minutes and 21
seconds remaining before a 15-8
Cardinal finish put matters to
rest.
Stanford grabbed the early
advantage and led by as many as
nine in the early going, but Utah
employed a deliberate offense and
solid defense to take the Cardinal
out of its traditional fast-paced
rhythm. Holding their opponents
to 30 percent shooting (9 of 30)
from the field, the Utes clawed to
a 28-25 halftime edge.
Sophomore forward Bobbie
Kelsey, who recorded 10 of her
game-high 17 points after the
break to go along with seven

rebounds, helped the Cardinal
pick up the pace and hit at a .462
(12 of 26) clip after the intermis
sion. But the squad's overall .375
showing marked the second time
in as many games that it failed to
reach the semi-respectable 40
percent plateau.
"Right now, our field goal per
centage is killing us," said Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer. "And
we're not getting any second shots.
Without rebounding, we can't get
our transition game going."
Indeed, as it had to a lesser
extent on Saturday, rebounding
continued to be the Cardinal's
achilles heel. Stanford overcame a
55-39 Utah advantage in that cat
egory on the night, including an
astounding 27-12 Utes edge on
the offensive boards.
However, whatever the Cardi
nal lacked in shooting success and
second chances on offense, it
made up with a stifling defense
that held Utah to a catastrophic
.297 (19 of 64) shooting percent
age and forced 21 Utes turnovers.
"We tried to step up the defen
sive pressure in the second half, and
we succeeded," VanDerveer said.
While no outlandish statistics
were put up by any individual, the
Cardinal benefitted from an
eight-point, 10-rebound effort
from junior center Anita Kaplan,
as well as a 10-point, seven
rebound night from junior for
ward Rachel Hemmer, who fouled
out with three and a half minutes
remaining.
Junior forward Andrea Herold
paced the Runnin' Utes with a
double-double of 15 points and 15
re-bounds, while sophomore for
ward Angie Bandy added eight
points and 11 boards to the losing
effort.
