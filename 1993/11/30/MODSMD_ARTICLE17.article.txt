# Athletes of the Week

### 
How sweet it is. After suffering through a
six-year drought, the Stanford water polo
team is finally king of the mountain once
again, as it knocked off USC 11-9 on Sunday
for the NCAA Championship.
Also looking to make some waves on the
national scene is the Cardinal volleyball
squad, which will kick off NCAA tournament
action with a second-round match against
either USC or Radford on Saturday.

And in celebration of these Cardinal suc
cesses of the past and future, The Daily
names water polo's Frank Schneider and vol
leyball's Piper Hahn as this week's Athletes
of the Week.
In an act comparable to hitting a game
winning home run in the World Series, Stan
ford's junior holeman Schneider secured the
Cardinal's narrow victory over USC with a
bullet of a shot directly in front of the Trojan
box with 41 seconds remaining in Sunday's
match.
Wrapping up nine long months of polo,
starting with U.S. Junior National Team
action in Cairo, Egypt, and finishing with an
NCAA title in Long Beach, Calif., Schneider
considers this victory especially sweet.
After acting as California's best man for
two consecutive years, the Cardinal finally
emerged as the life of the party, bringing the
national crown back to the Farm for the first
time since 1986.
Schneider, who tallied 17 goals on the sea
son, single-handedly dismantled UC-Irvine's
defense in the semifinals on Saturday.
Schneider forced the Anteaters into four ejec
tion fouls and one penalty shot, while scoring
once and slipping in two steals as well.

Although they don't have an NCAA ban
ner to show for it yet, the reigning national
champion women's volleyball squad is
primed and ready for a title defense.
Led by tri-captain Hahn, one of two

seniors on this year's team, the Cardinal fin
ished the season with a 21-6 showing.
Tallying 1,063 sets to go with her 305 digs
on the year, Hahn has served as a pivotal
force on the Stanford offense. Against the
Santa Clara Broncos last Tuesday, Hahn
orchestrated the Cadinal offensive effort
with a team-high 28 sets to go along with her
six digs.
