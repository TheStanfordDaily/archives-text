# Cardinal grapplers let victory slip away
## 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
While the rest of us ate turkey
over Thanksgiving weekend, the
Stanford wrestling team swal
lowed two dual-meet losses, dished
out by Oregon State and Oregon.
Although the losses lower the
Cardinal's record to 1-2 early in
the season, head coach Chris Hor
pel views them as practice tests in
preparation for what truly mat
ters: the Pacific 10 Championships
and NCAAs. "Right now I am most
interested in making progress and
qualifying as many people as possi
ble to the NCAAs," Horpel said.
At fifth-ranked Oregon State
on Friday, Cardinal co-captains
junior Jay Jackson (134 lbs.) and
senior Lance Johnson (150) both
won their contests. Both wrestlers
are undefeated so far in the sea
son.
Jackson enjoyed sweet revenge
against the Beavers' Glenn Nier
adka, who beat Jackson two years
ago, in a 10-3 victory. Jackson had
two-point takedowns in the first
and second periods and wrapped
up the match with a three-point
near fall in the final session. He
scored an additional point for rid
ing time, indicating that he stayed
in the top position for at least one
minute longer than his opponent.
Johnson was ahead of his oppo
nent, Orly Johnson, in all three
periods. During the third period,
he scored 12 points in a tremen
dous surge of three near falls, one
takedown and an escape. The final
match score was 16-3.
The rest of the Cardinal squad
did not fare as well, although sev
eral wrestlers posted impressive
performances in defeat. Freshman
Scott Chapman (158) narrowly
lost his match, 11-7. According to
Horpel, Chapman was suffering
from a chest cold that caused a
premature burnout against a flur
ry of attacks by OSU's Stoney
Myers.
Additionally, junior Ramy Saad
started for the first time in his
career in the 118-pound division.
Saad, who has filled in for starters
in past seasons, earned the posi
tion prior to the meets.
The following day, the wrestlers
narrowly lost to the Oregon Ducks
by the final score of 20-28. Once
again, Jackson and Johnson
racked up wins for the Cardinal.
They were joined by Chapman,
who had a fall only one minute, 20
seconds into the match.

"[Chapman] was upset that he
lost that way [the day before], and
he reacted in the best way possible
— he rose to the occasion," Horpel
said.
Both Johnson and Jackson had
decisive wins in Eugene. Jackson
beat Tim Kitchen 14-5 with six
takedowns over the three periods.
Johnson dominated his entire
match, accruing three takedowns,
two escapes and one near fall to
end up with 12 points against his
opponent's two.
Sophomore Jimmy Aguirre
(142) suffered a very close defeat
to Oregon's Cory Sonnen, 4-5. At
the end of the third period they
were tied with four points apiece;
however, Sonnen was awarded rid
ing time at the end of the match.
Going into the 177-pound
match, the Cardinal was ahead 20-
12. A forfeit at 177 and then losses
in the 190 and heavyweight divi
sions, however, allowed the Ducks
to surpass Stanford at the end of
the meet.
"Oregon and Oregon State's
strength lie in the upper weights,
and that's where our inexperience
is," Horpel said.
Today the Cardinal wrestlers
face San Francisco State in their
first home meet of the season.
Because the Cardinal beat the
Gators by only two points last
year, Horpel anticipates a close
meet.
"We have to keep our wits," he
said. "We need to do what we're
capable of doing and take it one
match at a time."
Horpel believes that the match
to watch today will be in the 126-
pound division. Matt Cano will
wrestle against fellow sophomore
Frances Aquino, one of the
Gators' top wrestlers. Because
they both have the same amount
of experience, it promises to be a
tight match. Cardinal football
player Jason Gladden will wrestle
in the 177-pound division.
This will be San Francisco
State's first dual meet of the sea
son, although they have already
competed in the Southern Oregon
Open. Two tournament champi
ons, Aquino and Polo Ornelas
(177), will give the Cardinal
strong competition.
Of the Gators' 10 starters, only
three return as front-line wrest
lers from last year's squad. The
remaining seven are mostly
junior college transfers.
The meet begins at 7:30 p.m. in
Burnham Pavilion.

opponent's two.
Sophomore Jimmy Aguirre
(142) suffered a very close defeat
to Oregon's Cory Sonnen, 4-5. At
the end of the third period they
were tied with four points apiece;
however, Sonnen was awarded rid
ing time at the end of the match.
Going into the 177-pound
match, the Cardinal was ahead 20-
12. A forfeit at 177 and then losses
in the 190 and heavyweight divi
sions, however, allowed the Ducks
to surpass Stanford at the end of
the meet.
"Oregon and Oregon State's
strength lie in the upper weights,
and that's where our inexperience
is," Horpel said.
Today the Cardinal wrestlers
face San Francisco State in their
first home meet of the season.
Because the Cardinal beat the
Gators by only two points last
year, Horpel anticipates a close
meet.
"We have to keep our wits," he
said. "We need to do what we're
capable of doing and take it one
match at a time."
Horpel believes that the match
to watch today will be in the 126-
pound division. Matt Cano will
wrestle against fellow sophomore
Frances Aquino, one of the
Gators' top wrestlers. Because
they both have the same amount
of experience, it promises to be a
tight match. Cardinal football
player Jason Gladden will wrestle
in the 177-pound division.
This will be San Francisco
State's first dual meet of the sea
son, although they have already
competed in the Southern Oregon
Open. Two tournament champi
ons, Aquino and Polo Ornelas
(177), will give the Cardinal
strong competition.
Of the Gators' 10 starters, only
three return as front-line wrest
lers from last year's squad. The
remaining seven are mostly
junior college transfers.
The meet begins at 7:30 p.m. in
Burnham Pavilion.
While the rest of us ate turkey
over Thanksgiving weekend, the
Stanford wrestling team swal
lowed two dual-meet losses, dished
out by Oregon State and Oregon.
Although the losses lower the
Cardinal's record to 1-2 early in
the season, head coach Chris Hor
pel views them as practice tests in
preparation for what truly mat
ters: the Pacific 10 Championships
and NCAAs. "Right now I am most
interested in making progress and
qualifying as many people as possi
ble to the NCAAs," Horpel said.
At fifth-ranked Oregon State
on Friday, Cardinal co-captains
junior Jay Jackson (134 lbs.) and
senior Lance Johnson (150) both
won their contests. Both wrestlers
are undefeated so far in the sea
son.
Jackson enjoyed sweet revenge
against the Beavers' Glenn Nier
adka, who beat Jackson two years
ago, in a 10-3 victory. Jackson had
two-point takedowns in the first
and second periods and wrapped
up the match with a three-point
near fall in the final session. He
scored an additional point for rid
ing time, indicating that he stayed
in the top position for at least one
minute longer than his opponent.
Johnson was ahead of his oppo
nent, Orly Johnson, in all three
periods. During the third period,
he scored 12 points in a tremen
dous surge of three near falls, one
takedown and an escape. The final
match score was 16-3.
The rest of the Cardinal squad
did not fare as well, although sev
eral wrestlers posted impressive
performances in defeat. Freshman
Scott Chapman (158) narrowly
lost his match, 11-7. According to
Horpel, Chapman was suffering
from a chest cold that caused a
premature burnout against a flur
ry of attacks by OSU's Stoney
Myers.
Additionally, junior Ramy Saad
started for the first time in his
career in the 118-pound division.
Saad, who has filled in for starters
in past seasons, earned the posi
tion prior to the meets.
The following day, the wrestlers
narrowly lost to the Oregon Ducks
by the final score of 20-28. Once
again, Jackson and Johnson
racked up wins for the Cardinal.
They were joined by Chapman,
who had a fall only one minute, 20
seconds into the match.

"[Chapman] was upset that he
lost that way [the day before], and
he reacted in the best way possible
— he rose to the occasion," Horpel
said.
Both Johnson and Jackson had
decisive wins in Eugene. Jackson
beat Tim Kitchen 14-5 with six
takedowns over the three periods.
Johnson dominated his entire
match, accruing three takedowns,
two escapes and one near fall to
end up with 12 points against his
opponent's two.
