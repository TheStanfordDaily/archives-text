# Journal unites religious elements

### Ben Zaniello 
In an effort to increase discussion on
campus about religion and beliefs, senior
Brian Brennan is turning to unlikely cat
alyst — a printing press.
The Element — a non-profit, student
run publication started by Brennan —
will appear next quarter as an open forum
for religious issues, accepting student po
etry, photography, prose and artwork.
"It will serve as an outlet or communi
ty in which to explore such sensitive is
sues as people's beliefs and creeds,"
Brennan said. "One of Stanford's biggest
weaknesses is neglecting these personal
creeds — and this can be so important."
Bruce Huber, another founder of The
Element, agreed. "People don't take reli
gious things at Stanford very seriously,"
he said. "Everybody thinks if it works for

you it's good for you. And there seems to
be no objective truth."
Although The Element is still in its
preliminary stages, many students and
staff active in campus religious groups
say they are enthusiastic about an in
crease in religious discourse.
"[The Element] does sound like a good
idea. It seems to go along with Stanford's
tendency toward diversity and toler
ance," said Jun Lee, a senior and an ac
tive member in the Inter Varsity Christ
ian Fellowship. "But [the publishers)
would have to be careful. Many see their
religion as the only way, Christianity
being a good example. It would be diffi
cult to reconcile all the differences in
these beliefs."
Rabbi Ari Cartun of Stanford Hillel
says he thinks such a publication is a
good idea. "Before 1 can really say any

thing I'd have to see it; but, in principle,
I'm all for it. It would be a nice addition
on campus."
Although they don't have any money
yet, Brennan hopes that the first publica
tion will receive funding from the ASSU
Publications Board.
"We now have the six people necessary
to become a volunteer organization, but,
unfortunately, I didn't register us with
the [Office of Student Affairs] in time to
get funding for this quarter," he said.
"But I'm not worried about next quarter.
The Element is a fairly innovative idea
for Stanford and I think the Publications
Board will recognize that."
Brennan sees The Element as a way
for Stanford students to discuss key is
sues in religion, and perhaps show how
different religions view similar
concepts. "Ideally, I'd like a typi
cal section of The Element to
have, say, a poem by a Muslim on
one page and on the next page

have the same subject explored
by a Methodist."
Huber said The Element will
have educational value as well as
spiritual value.
"The Element won't just be a
place for you to read about reli
gious arguments. It will also be a
place for you to inform yourself
about religion," he said.
