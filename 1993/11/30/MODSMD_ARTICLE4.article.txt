## Group developing ways to change University's business practices 
### Gina Lee Staff writer 
With more budget cuts loom
ing, one University project has
started to suggest ways Stanford
can change its business practices
and save money.
The Transition to New Busi
ness Practices policy team has de
veloped nine preliminary recom
mendations regarding University
policy and practices that will be
sent to University President Ger
hard Casper and Provost Con
doleezza Rice next month, after
final revisions.
According to Frank Topper,
business practice coordinator in
the controller's office, the campus
wide project was approved by the
University Cabinet last year "with
an eye to reduce errors and time
and improve service to faculty,
students and staff."
"As a by-product we hope to
eventually to achieve lower costs
and higher productivity," Topper
said.

The project consisted of five
teams, each composed of faculty
and staff, that focused on different
business processes.
The areas the teams studied
were university policy forma
tion, approval and dissemina
tion; accounting for paid time
off; purchasing of and payment
for goods and services; spon
sored projects administration;
and the chart of accounts and
general ledger.
Forty people from academic
and administrative area were in
vited to participate in full-day re
treats in December 1992.
Participants were asked to sub
mit suggestions on business
processes needing attention
"Over 200 suggest ions were made,
and then we narrowed it down to
the top five," Topper said.
The idea of using a "team
method" to streamline adminis
tration was developed in Japan
and is currently used numerous
American corporations.
Specialists from Hewlett-
Packard and American President
Lines conducted training sessions
to educate Business Practices
members on how to work in
teams. "These programs were
very educational and rewarding,"
Assoc. Law School Dean Frank

Brucato said.
"To head up the teams, indi
viduals from each department
level were chosen so that the
teams represented a slice of
university staffing," Brucato
said.
The policy team, led by Susan
Schofield, was the first to submit
their draft recommendations.
The recommendations includ
ed placing university policies in a
computer system that is avail
able on demand to all students,

faculty and staff; creating and
maintaining flexible university
distribution lists usable for both
on-line and paper communica
tion; and expanding staff educa
tional materials and training to
include information about locat
ing and implementing university
policies.
The policy team will consider
input from the community before
submitting its final recommenda
tions to the president and provost
next month.
