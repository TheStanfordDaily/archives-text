# ASSU to give $10,000 grant for a new idea
## Program would solicit business project proposals from students, offer funding 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
The ASSU has announced that it may
offer up to $10,000 to enterprising stu
dents who come up with a proposal for its
next business project.
The new Entrepreneurial Grants pro
gram, which will go before the senate
tonight, would solicit ideas for a-business
project, and fund the best one with up to
$10,000 in startup capital. The ASSU
would then adopt the business project as its
own, and the student who submitted the
idea would become the project's manager.
"It's a great way for getting students
who wouldn't normally be involved in the
ASSU to work on a project," said Council of
Presidents member Jason Snyder.
According to graduate senator Steve
Abbott, the bill's author, funding will ini
tially be provided at the financial manag
er's discretion.
If the student-initiated project is suc
cessful, the ASSU will assume responsibil
ity for it next year, much like other busi
ness projects such as Sunday Flicks and
the Shirt Shak.
"A lot of the program's success is going
to depend on how many ideas are out
there," Snyder said. "I have a feeling there

will'be a wealth of them."
Abbott said the bill was written in an at
tempt to both reach out to more students
and fulfill student needs.
"We were concerned that the ASSU
isn't well known to students," he said.
"This bill would be an obvious way to pub
licize the ASSU â€” to give students an op
portunity to get real-life experience."
In addition, Snyder said, the projects
that come out of the bill will "fill voids in
the ASSU's student services."
Applications for possible projects will be
due Jan. 21, and selections will be made by
a group of students currently involved in
the ASSU.
"The idea is that we're going to set out
some broad criteria that students should
try to work within," Abbott said. "The pro
ject should be both profitable and fulfill
some need."
Though the bill authorizes a large sum
of money for the project, ASSU Financial
Manager Brian Hillger stressed that all of
the $10,000 need not be used for startup
costs.
In addition, the money "should not be
considered a loss (to the ASSU)," Hillger
said. "Our hope is that, if the project has
some success, the initial funding
will be returned to the ASSU.
"We have some very successful
business projects managed by the
ASSU," he said. "We are confident
that the students' ideas will be
profitable."
Abbott emphasized the impor
tance of allocating money for a

student-run business. "We're
assuming that a student wouldn't
have the money to start up the
business," he said.
"The ASSU is uniquely situat
ed to help students start a busi
ness," he said. "Students really
have nowhere else to go."
The senate will vote on the bill
tonight. If the bill passes, its pro
visions will go into effect this
year. It has already passed the
senate's Budget and Finance
Committee.
