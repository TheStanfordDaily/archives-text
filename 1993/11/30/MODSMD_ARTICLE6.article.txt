Staff at the Cowell Health Promotion
Program are expressing uncertainty
about their future as it loses four of its
nine staff members to resignations and
expiring employment terms.
Fran Gibson/director of the Sexual As
sault Information Resource Center, an
nounced her resignation Wednesday and
will leave the office Dec. 10. The center's
outreach educator and only other staff
member Caroline Mitchell is planning to
leave Dec. 17 as the position's traditional
one-year term comes to an end, according
to Health Promotion Program director
Carole Pertofsky.
Party Pro's program assistant Crystal
Chang turned in her resignation on
Wednesday as well, and program director
Stewart Kiner is currently on paid leave
until Jan. 31, when his grant ends. Party
Pro's was funded by a one-year grant
from the Office of Traffic Safety, which
paid for Kiner and Chang's positions.
The Health Promotion Program in
cludes the Sexual Assault Information
Resource Center, Party Pro's, the Alco
hol and Other Drugs Abuse Prevention
Program, HIV testing and education, the
Health Library and the Nutrition Pro
gram.

Pertofsky explained that all the
turnovers involve temporarily funded
personnel whose terms were coming to a
close. She said efforts will be made to
promptly fill the voids in some form.
Pertofsky said that although people
have already expressed an interest in tak
ing over both Mitchell'B and Gibson's jobs
at- the Sexual Assault Information Re
source Center for the year, the future of
these positions will depend on an avail
ability of funds.
Mitchell's full-time position is funded
by an ASSU special fee under the Coali
tion Against Sexual Assault, while Gib
son's half-time post falls under Cowell's
Health Promotion Program. The center
itself is part of the Cowell program, and
serves as a student sexual assault preven
tion and response resource.
The future of the outreach educator
position will depend on whether the
Coalition Against Sexual Assault decides
to fund it through a fee request, and
whether their request passes, Pertofsky
said. However, Mitchell had said when
she was first hired, that the coalition's
initial intent in setting up a fee request
was to encourage the University to take
over the funding.
It is still uncertain whether the Uni-
versity will provide enough fund
ing to allow the Health Promo
tion Program to continue the sex
ual assault prevention center's
director position, Pertofsky said.
"It will depend how the Universi
ty prioritizes sexual assault
issues," she said. "We're very pos
itive we can keep the position
through next year, but after that,
it's a question mark."
Alejandro Martinez, director of
student health services, empha
sized that Cowell's "commitment
to continuing education in sexual
assault will continue."
Martinez also said Kiner and
Chang's departures will not dras
tically affect operations, although

they did come somewhat unex
pectedly. "Their departure a few
weeks early is a surprise," he said.
But Kiner said the staff losses
will affect the student services
that Health Promotion provides.
"It will take time for new people
to start up again," he said. Fur
thermore, the uncertainty of the
future of the vacated positions
leaves them vulnerable to budget
cuts.
Martinez said the overall future
of the health promotion office
looks fine. The staff members'
departure "is going to mean that
not that much work will be done
this month," he said. "But overall
we're looking for continuity.
Whenever someone leaves, there
must be a transition period."
The Alcohol and Other Drug
Abuse Prevention Program will
continue with a new grant from

the national Fund for the
Improvement of Post-Secondary
Education.
Pertofsky said Party Pro's — a
program offering alcohol-free
alternatives to party planning —
will continue as a student-run
organization that "will still have
its home at Health Promotion,"
including use of office space and
phones.
A modified drug and alcohol
abuse prevention program
focused on "community-based
intervention" will be launched
with the new two-year grant,
which is "just getting going,"
Pertofsky said.
"In an era of budget cuts, we
are very pleased with the amount
funding we have received," she
said. "In terms of drugs and alco
hol (abuse prevention), we are in
good shape."
