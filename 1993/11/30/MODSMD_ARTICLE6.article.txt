Staff at the Cowell Health Promotion
Program are expressing uncertainty
about their future as it loses four of its
nine staff members to resignations and
expiring employment terms.
Fran Gibson/director of the Sexual As
sault Information Resource Center, an
nounced her resignation Wednesday and
will leave the office Dec. 10. The center's
outreach educator and only other staff
member Caroline Mitchell is planning to
leave Dec. 17 as the position's traditional
one-year term comes to an end, according
to Health Promotion Program director
Carole Pertofsky.
Party Pro's program assistant Crystal
Chang turned in her resignation on
Wednesday as well, and program director
Stewart Kiner is currently on paid leave
until Jan. 31, when his grant ends. Party

Mitchell's full-time position is funded
by an ASSU special fee under the Coali

son's half-time post falls under Cowell's
Health Promotion Program. The center
itself is part of the Cowell program, and
serves as a student sexual assault preven

The future of the outreach educator
position will depend on whether the
Coalition Against Sexual Assault decides
to fund it through a fee request, and
whether their request passes, Pertofsky
said. However, Mitchell had said when
she was first hired, that the coalition's
initial intent in setting up a fee request

over the funding.
It is still uncertain whether the Uni-
