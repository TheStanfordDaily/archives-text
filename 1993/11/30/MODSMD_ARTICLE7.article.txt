Drama Prof. Rush Rehm
spent last summer "trading
with the enemy."
Rehm risked a $250,000 fine
and a 10-year prison sentence
by traveling to Cuba with 300
other Americans to challenge
the legality of the U.S. trade
embargo and deliver humani
tarian aid.
And when U.S. Customs offi
cials unexpectedly seized a
school bus that had been donat
ed to the Cuban people, Rehm
and several others initiated a
'23-dav hunger strike in protest.
"As an academic, you can do
your research and change the
way people are writing about
things, but if you don't change
the way the world is, I don't
know if you've really done very
much," Rehm said. "Now, I'm
not saying that I've done very
much either, but at least one
has to try."

Drama Prof. Rush Rehm is back at Stanford after spending his summer in Cuba, delivering humanitar
ian aid and protesting the current U.S. embargo on the island nation.
While Rehm' has long opposed
U.S. policies in Central America,
he said his interest in Cuba stems
from an admiration for Cuban film
directors who produced several
"extraordinary films in the years
after the revolution."
"But more importantly," he
said, "I was attracted to this partic
ular caravan because I realized
that what Cuba was suffering from
was a direct result of a very specif
ic foreign policy decision."
The U.S. trade embargo against
Cuba, which was officially institut
ed in 1963 and tightened after the
collapse of the Soviet Union, is
strangling the Cuban people,
Rehm said.
Denouncing the embargo as a
"Cold War policy in a post-Cold
War world," Rehm said that it has
deprived the Cubans of everything
from "toilet paper to medicine to
petroleum."
"This wasn't like combating
Third World hunger," Rehm
added. "The embargo is something

that could be changed immediately
— all it would take would be Clin
ton to end it."
Last June, Rehm and 300 oth
ers began gathering basic supplies
like powdered milk, old computers,
medicine and school supplies for
the journey to Cuba. The caravan,
convening in Laredo, Texas,
brought with it 100 tons of human
itarian assistance as well as two old
school buses bound for a center for
handicapped and mentally retard
ed people in Havana. The relief
effort was to travel to Mexico and
then take a boat to Cuba.
Intending to violate both the
U.S. travel ban to Cuba and the
legality of the trade embargo, the
group refused to apply for an
export license which would have
made their actions legal.
The group anticipated resis
tance from border authorities, but
doubted they would impose the
maximum penalty of a $250,000
fine and a 10-year prison term,
Rehm said.
The officials removed several
boxes of medicine and a few com
puters from the caravan, but
allowed most of the goods to pass
through to Mexico, and did not

arrest a single group member.
The group's relief and jubila
tion, however, proved premature,
as the officials impounded one of
the school buses destined for Cuba,
refusing to classify it as humani
tarian aid. In protest, several group
members declared a hunger strike
and refused to leave the bus.
The authorities towed the bus
into the customs lot, flattened its
tires and removed its battery, but
14 people remained with the bus
despite the 107-degree heat, Rehm
said. Lacking toilet facilities, they
were forced to defecate in plastic
cups from McDonald's until the
authorities provided them with
portable bathrooms after two long
days.
While Rehm was not originally
on the bus, he stopped eating as
well, consuming only "a concoction
of lemon juice and maple syrup."
However, he and the majority of
the caravan left the bus and its pas
sengers in Laredo two days later to
continue on to Cuba with the aid.
Rehm continued his hunger
strike in Cuba, though, meeting a
host of political leaders including
Fidel Castro. "We were treated like
small-scale heroes, but I did not

feel very heroic when I saw what
my government was doing to the
Cuban people," he said.
Meanwhile, the story had bro
ken in several Texas newspapers
and The New York Times. After a
meeting in Washington, customs
officials released the bus after 23
days and the hunger strike ended.
The bus is now at a center for
handicapped and mentally retard
ed people in Cuba, Rehm said.
Despite the attention that the
caravan received, Rehm said he is
not optimistic about the chances of
ending the U.S. embargo against
Cuba. The United Nations has, on
two occasions, condemned the
embargo as illegal, but U.S. polity
has not changed, he said.
Rehm said he feels an obligation
to continue working to make
Cuba's plight known to the Ameri
can people.
"Americans generally don't
want to think that there's a rela
tionship between .. . the kind of
world they can live in and the fact
that other people can't," he said.
"They see it all as a kind of equal
playing field — but it is completely
unequal and is built to be
unequal."
