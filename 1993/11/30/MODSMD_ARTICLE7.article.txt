# Rehm braves fasts, fines for Cuban cause

Drama Prof. Rush Rehm
spent last summer "trading
with the enemy."
Rehm risked a $250,000 fine
and a 10-year prison sentence
by traveling to Cuba with 300
other Americans to challenge
the legality of the U.S. trade
embargo and deliver humani
tarian aid.
And when U.S. Customs offi
cials unexpectedly seized a
school bus that had been donat
ed to the Cuban people, Rehm
and several others initiated a
'23-dav hunger strike in protest.
"As an academic, you can do
your research and change the
way people are writing about
things, but if you don't change
the way the world is, I don't
know if you've really done very
much," Rehm said. "Now, I'm
not saying that I've done very
much either, but at least one
has to try."
