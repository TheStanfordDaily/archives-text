LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP ) — For years,
Jenninp> and Mitzi Osborne have caused
traffic jams as they've dazzled passersbys
with their vast and ever-growing Christ
mas displays, which twinkle with more
than a million lights.
But when they bought the houses next
door to expand, neighbors decided they
had had enough electrified holiday cheer.
Their lawsuit, demanding that the
Osbornes pull the plug on their holiday
display, went to trial yesterday.
The Osbornes say their light show is
their constitutionally protected way of
sharing the season's cheer.
The Osbornes' lawyer, Sam Perroni,
said shutting down the display would vio

late his clients' First Amendment rights to
freedom of speech and religion.
The trial is being held in a borrowed
federal courtroom to accommodate all the
spectators.
