# Court to review church-state divide
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme
Court agreed yesterday to consider revis
ing its 22-year-old rule for interpreting
the constitutionally required separation
of church and state.
The high court said it will use a case
involving a New York school district cre
ated for disabled children of a Hasidic
Jewish community to decide how far
government can go to accommodate reli
gious practices.
New York courts ruled that the cre
ation of the Kiryas Joel Village School
District was an unconstitutional govern
ment endorsement of religion.
The school district is asking the high
court to overturn the landmark 1971
ruling it has used in deciding many
church-state cases. The court has re
examined that ruling several times in
past years but each time stopped short of
replacing it.

"I'm not looking for a lower stan
dard," said school district lawyer George
Shebitz. "I'm looking for a more appro
priate standard, a workable standard."
But Steven Green of Americans Unit
ed for Separation of Church and State
said any decision dismantling the 1971
standard "could lead to wholesale tax
support for religious education."
The court's 1971 ruling in Lemon vs.
Kurtz man said laws or government prac
tices are unconstitutional if they have a
religious purpose, primarily advance or
promote religion, or excessively entangle
government and religion.
The high court in recent years has
decided several cases in which it had
been asked to overturn the 1971 deci
sion. The sternest test came in 1992,
when the court reaffirmed its 31-year
ban on officially sponsored prayers in
public schools. The court split 5-4 in

rejecting the Bush administration's
attempt to replace the 1971 standard
with one more accommodating to reli
gion.
Officials of the New York State School
Boards Association challenged state law
makers' 1989 creation of the Kiryas Joel
district, calling it an impermissible
accommodation of a Jewish sect's beliefs.
Most children in the village attend
private religious schools. Disabled chil
dren went to a public school until their
parents withdrew them, saying they
were traumatized by going to school out
side the Kiryas Joel village.
New York courts ruled that creation
of the district violated the Constitution
by yielding to the Jewish sect's beliefs.
Another public school district and state
Attorney General Robert Abrams joined
the Kiryas Joel school district in appeal
ing those rulings.
