Seated comfortably in the old play
room of the Hoover children, University
President Gerhard Casper held his first
ever student press conference yester
day, touching on topics from alumni dis
satisfaction to minority recruitment.
The interview, part of a day-long stu
dent-outreach campaign, lasted more
than 90 minutes, with the president
fielding questions from representatives
of The Daily, The Stanford Review and
KZSU.
But the session at the Lou Henry

Hoover House, which was broadcast live
by the campus radio station, unearthed
no significant new information about
University policy, as the questions —
and Casper's answers — tended to be
somewhat cautious.
"If there's one aspect of the presiden
tial functions that is very difficult to
warm up to ... it is what I call the
'Queen Elizabeth' aspect of the job,"
Casper said. "That is, cutting ribbons,
making tours, and appearing [hereand]
there.
"You just become a performer incar
nate. That's not my style — I hate it,"he
added.
Casper went on to say that, though

he is unconcerned about criticism that
he has been inaccessible to students, he
is nonetheless trying to increase his con
tact with them.
He pointed out that yesterday alone
— in addition to meeting with the stu
dent press — he had a scheduled
eveningdiscussion with 15 randomly se
lected graduate students at Hoover
House. He recently held a similar gath
ering for a group of undergraduates.
In another gesture of student out
reach, Casper read a bedtime story to
residents of Serra House last night. And
he confirmed that, to the astonishment

of his staff, he will teach an
advanced seminar in the spring on
constitutional law.
He also downplayed the signifi
cance of Stanford's slip in the most
recent U.S. News and World
Report college rankings, which
rated Stanford 77th in alumni sat
isfaction. "We have to follow our
own lights, not those of news mag
azines," Casper said.
However, he conceded that the
low level of alumni giving is "of
tremendous concern to me." Casper

attributed the shortfall to the Uni
versity's "laid-back" approach to
soliciting contributions.
But he also pointed to the fact
that the diversification of the stu
dent body over the past decade
"has brought a lot of conflict —
some of that conflict Stanford con
cerned itself openly with . . . some
of it Stanford has dealt with very
well, and some of it [Stanfordl has
not dealt with so well.
"In any event, it leaves lots of
alumni very unhappy," he said.
Casper also spoke about the
upcoming budget-cutting process,
which calls for a $20 million reduc
tion over the next five years. "We

are going about budget cutting in
very different ways," he said.
"I certainly hope that we will
generally evaluate what we are
doing, and drop some activities we
are now doing because they are not
affordable and not valuable enough
in the overall scheme of things, and
instead reform some areas or give
more money to some other areas."
Reiterating the fact that these
cuts aim to fundamentally redefine
University operations, Casper
unleashed his pet mantra: "Business
as usual is not business as usual."
"Thinking in this way does not
mean just being negative, it also
means ... to pursue and develop.

Much of the innovation will have
to come by substitution," he said.
"Will that be easy? No. Will a lot of
resistance build up? Yes."
Meanwhile, the president ack
nowledged that the University, as
evidenced by numerous reports
released this fall, may be lagging
behind in affirmative action matters,
particularly with minority graduate
students and women faculty.
"Stanford does not have a
record of which it should be
proud," he said. "(In regards to)
minority recruitment in Ph.D. pro
grams, what we have accomplished
is nothing to boast about."
Perhaps foreshadowing tomor

row's scheduled Faculty Senate
discussion on the recruitment and
retention of women faculty,
Casper surmised that "some
younger faculty of both genders do
not feel the environment is very
supportive once they're here."
Citing what he calls "the hustle
factor," he said the atmosphere at
modern research institutions saps
resources which could be used to
attract and support new faculty.
However, he said the Universi
ty is currently making efforts to
rectify such problems, mainly
through the appointment of a new
vice provost for faculty recruit
ment and retention.
