Seated comfortably in the old play
room of the Hoover children, University
President Gerhard Casper held his first
ever student press conference yester
day, touching on topics from alumni dis
satisfaction to minority recruitment.
The interview, part of a day-long stu
dent-outreach campaign, lasted more
than 90 minutes, with the president
fielding questions from representatives
of The Daily, The Stanford Review and
KZSU.
But the session at the Lou Henry

Hoover House, which was broadcast live
by the campus radio station, unearthed
no significant new information about
University policy, as the questions —
and Casper's answers — tended to be
somewhat cautious.
"If there's one aspect of the presiden
tial functions that is very difficult to
warm up to ... it is what I call the
'Queen Elizabeth' aspect of the job,"
Casper said. "That is, cutting ribbons,
making tours, and appearing [hereand]
there.
"You just become a performer incar
nate. That's not my style — I hate it,"he
added.
Casper went on to say that, though

he is unconcerned about criticism that
he has been inaccessible to students, he
is nonetheless trying to increase his con
tact with them.
He pointed out that yesterday alone
— in addition to meeting with the stu
dent press — he had a scheduled
eveningdiscussion with 15 randomly se
lected graduate students at Hoover
House. He recently held a similar gath
ering for a group of undergraduates.
In another gesture of student out
reach, Casper read a bedtime story to
residents of Serra House last night. And
he confirmed that, to the astonishment
