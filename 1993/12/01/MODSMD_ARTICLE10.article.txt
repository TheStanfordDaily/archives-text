REDWOOD VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -
An arrest has been made in connection
with the kidnapping of 12-year-old Polly
Klaas, a newspaper reported.
FBI agents and other law enforce
ment officials swarmed the Coyote Val
ley Indian Rancheria reservation north
of Ukiah yesterday and arrested a man
for questioning, the Santa Rosa Press
Democrat reported in today's editions.
A man who was living in a house on
the reservation was arrested for parole
violations, Petaluma Sgt. Mike Kerns
said. The man's name has not been
released.
Kerns said the suspect is not a rela
tive of Klaas "to my knowledge" and he
did not know if the man had any ties to
Petaluma, he told the paper.
"It's obvious we're looking at him as
a potential suspect," said Kerns. "He's a
look-alike in the Polly Klaas case."
Agents, Mendocino County sheriffs

deputies and Petaluma police searched
the woods in the area but did not find
the Petaluma girl. Officials were search
ing the house for clues late last night,
the paper reported.
Kerns refused to comment further.
"We still have not located Polly and
we won't do anything that might jeopar
dize her safety," he said.
Kerns refused to say whether police
had obtained any evidence that linked
the suspect to the kidnapping. "I can't
talk about any evidence," he said.
Polly was kidnapped at knife point
Oct. 1 from her Petaluma home by a
bearded man.
A neighbor told the Press Democrat
that dozens of FBI agents and law
enforcement officials descended on a
small house in her neighborhood at
about 3:30 p.m. and arrested a man she
did not know.
"There were eight or nine cars of FBI

agents and task force members. They
surrounded the house," she said.
"They had a sketch of the man that
kidnapped that little girl. They are
almost positive it was him," said the
woman, who declined to be identified.
"We were told not to talk about it by
the FBI," she said.
The FBI had been tipped off to the
suspect and had the house under
surveillance from nearby Highway 101
since morning, the woman told the
paper.
Under an almost full moon, sheriff s
deputies and lab technicians continued
to search the house, the yard and every
thing in it, tribal administrator Priscilla
Hunter said.
The people living in the house were
squatters who did not belong to the
tribe, Hunter said. Officials had been
trying to evict them for the past two
vears. she said.
