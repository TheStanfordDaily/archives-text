## Editorials Granted, a fine idea 
### 
IT IS AN economic truism that
investment spending generally
reaps great long- and short
term rewards. Therefore, last
night's ASSU Senate approval of a
bill that would bestow up to
$10,000 in start-up capital to the
best business project idea proposed
by Stanford students is a hopeful
sign of economic success for both
the ASSU and enterprising stu
dents.
The innovative Entrepreneurial
Grants program will solicit ideas
for projects; then the financial
manager will support the chosen
concept with the necessary operat
ing funds. If the project proves suc
cessful, the ASSU will incorporate
it into its array of other permanent
business programs, such as Sunday
Flicks and the Shirt Shak.
The $10,000 grant proposal is an
ingenious way to spark student
inventiveness and entrepreneurial
spirit. Hopefully, the assurance of

student government support will
convince those students who may
have had original ideas but were
uncertain if they would be left in
financial ruin if their plans went
awry to pursue their programs. If
successful, both they and the ASSU
will benefit.
Furthermore, the bill is certainly
good way to attract student atten
tion to other ASSU affairs. The
proposal signals that student gov
ernment is willing to come up with
original and innovative plans to
help their constituents, both now
and in the future.
Now it is up to students to justify
the confidence that the ASSU has
placed in them. There are only two
loose restrictions on proposed pro
grams: they must be potentially
profitable and fill a genuine commu
nity need. Otherwise, anything goes.
The bridge has been built. It only
remains to be seen if anyone will
use it.
