less complaints about
Stanford's undergraduate
experience — from Residential
Education to distribution require
ments to freshman English.
It's time for Stanford students
to put their money where their
mouths are.
In last week's Daily poll, 57.5
percent of students responding said
that they were not familiar with the
Commission on Undergraduate
Education, the body charged with
the re-evaluation of the very sub
jects of so many student gripes.
If more than half of students
remain in the dark about the com
mission, its function and the work
it will do to reform several yet-to
be-named areas of undergraduate
education, how can students expect
to get a fair shake in the process?
Students need to become actively
involved in the revamping of under
graduate education. The commis

sion will never know what students
want if they don't get involved.
What is imperative in this process,
with only two student members
participating on the body, is stu
dent-commission interaction.
At the same time, the commis
sion must take responsibility for
educating the students on its
progress. The commission must
realize that dorm meetings create
an ideal forum for students to feel
comfortable about asking ques
tions, an element sorely needed in
this process.
The commission provided the
funds for the Student Advisory
Group on Undergraduate Education,
but the low turn-out at the group's
meetings do not bode well for active
student input in the process.
Student-commission dialogue
needs to be more actively pursued
— both by faculty members on the
commission and by the student
body.
