## Woody's neurotic beauty 
### 
1T PAINS ME to read a comment like
James Collins' in the New York
Observer, which claims that "one of
the nicest things about New York at the
moment is that with the decline and fall
of Woody Allen, it is, for the time being,
free of any tiresome singer of its songs,
any master poet of the city's beat." Even
Adam Gopnik, of Allen's beloved New
Yorker, calls him "the Icarus of the Arts
& Leisure section." To some of us, how
ever, admittedly a dwindling number,
Woody Allen has already waxed his
wings into our canon, immortalized for
ever against the rainy, black and white
Manhattan skyline.
Recall the lobster scene in "Annie
Hall," the list of things that make life
worth living in "Manhattan," the psy
choanalyst scenes (He's done a great job
on you. Your self-esteem is like a notch
below Kafka's), even The Kugelmass
Episode. Between his early years as a
stand-up comedian and the recent "Man
hattan Murder Mystery," Woody Allen
has managed to construct a world to suit
his own tastes. His city — where people
argue about Dostoevsky over brandy,
duck out of the rain into the Pageant
Bookstore, where sex might be a
"Kafkaesque experience"; more plainly,
"a town that existed in black and white
and pulsated to the great tunes of George
Gershwin." Many of his critics have
chastised him for lionizing a lifestyle

which hardly exists — who, after all, has
time for art exhibits and matinees of
"The Sorrow and The Pity." Herein lies
the reason for our affection — when we
are watching "Hannah and Her Sisters,"
"Annie Hall" or "Crimes and Misde
meanors," we can't help but live it.
Allen's intellectual world was never
one of snooty-nosed tea drinkers. In
fact, his best works are intellectual par
odies. Who can forget Gabe walking
through an autumnal Central Park in
"Husbands and Wives," explaining to
Rain that "Tolstoy is a full meal. Tur
genev, I would say, is a fabulous desert.
That's how I'd characterize him And
Dostoevsky? Dostoevesky is a full meal
with a vitamin pill and extra wheat
germ." There is very little pretension in
an Allen film. His characters display a
humble uneasiness, each wracked with
his trademark litany of insecurities and
phobias.
Of course, one should not discuss
Woody Allen's humor without mention
ing his paranoia. Certainly, they are the
neuroses of a middle-aged, Upper West
Side Jewish man. Recall "Oedipus
Wrecks" from "New York Stories,"
where a classic Jewish mother's doling
of guilt is raised to mythic proportions.
Still, one needn't have grown up ladling
matzah ball soup to appreciate this hys
terical caricature. Underlying the specif
ic details of a lifestyle which Allen por

trays is a poignant commentary on rela
tionships among family, friends and
lovers. Ultimately, this what makes
Allen's films so universally popular
they deal with the confusion, bizarre
ness and wonder which occurs when
real, and therefore somewhat flawed,
people try to relate.
To speak of Allen's "decline and fall"
due to his personal affairs seems to me
preposterous. His only responsibilities
to the public are the movies he produces,
and if the separation of public and pri
vate is difficult, it is only because he has
done such a good job of creating and
playing such thoroughly realistic char
acters. Certainly, -he should'ncH be fin
ished for this. As for me, Allen's classic
films make any kind of Icarus plummet
impossible. Call me a romantic (as I'm
sure you do), but the beauty of Woody
Allen is that you can be a romantic and a
cynic at the same time: " 'Chapter One:
He was as tough and romantic as the
city he loved. Behind his black rimmed
glasses was the coi' d sexual power of a
jungle cat.' 1 love this. 'New York was
his town. And it always would be.' "

"Manhattan" may not accurately por
tray Manhattan if one has had too many
Manhattans.
