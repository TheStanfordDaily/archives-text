## Robber Baron mascot promotes stealing, not capitalism 
### 
ICAST MY vote with Rafe Sagarin
and others to name the new Stanford
mascot the Robber Baron, but not for
the same reasons.
Sagarin is wrong when he says the
name may only upset a few "capitalist
pigs." I say, not even the capitalist
"pigs" will be upset by making the mas
cot a Robber Baron, because Leland
Stanford had absolutely nothing to do
with capitalism.
Sagarin says a Robber Baron mascot
would evoke "images of our school glori
ously rising from the spoils of Leland
Stanford's economic conquest of the
West." The truth is, Leland Stanford
made no economic conquest of the West.
He made a political conquest of the
West.
Others are wrong, too, when they say

that because the impetus to find a new
mascot is supposedly financial, a Robber
Baron is the perfect choice. I think the
University wants to make money the
old-fashioned way, in a capitalist mar
ket; not by stealing it, like a Robber
Baron would.
Capitalism is, by definition, a system
where the government does not interfere
in nor regulate business practice. Clearly
a government that granted free land,
free money and freedom from competi
tion to companies like Stanford's Cen
tral Pacific Railroad is not a government
supportive of capitalism. Nor can any
individual (especially a U.S. Senator)
who took such a gift from the govern
ment rightly be called a capitalist.
A capitalist is someone like Cornelius
Vanderbilt, another university benefac

tor, who was an industrial entrepreneur
who never received favors from the gov
ernment. But our own Leland Stanford
was not like Vanderbilt. He was a politi
cal entrepreneur who built an inferior
railroad, used political power to keep out
competition, overcharged the public
treasury for supplies and thus achieved
the only title proper to such a person:
Robber Baron.
Don't bad-mouth the mechanism by
which food is put on your table, and a
roof over your head, by confusing Robber
Barons with capitalists and the winners
of economic (not political) conquest. Too
many people standing in line for bread in
the former Soviet Union have experi
enced Robber Baronism and they will be
left forever standing in line if they're told
that capitalism is the same thing.

Don't be afraid of offending capital
ists by making a mockery (I mean mas
cot) of the Robber Barons in lieu of mak
ing a mockery of Native Americans. If
Vanderbilt University had a Robber
Baron mascot, a capitalist could rightly
complain. But if the mascot of Stan
ford's legacy helps to expose the thieves
who history has dubbed capitalists, then
we'll rejoice.
Finally, let's not BUY the copyright
for the Monopoly guy from Parker
Brothers for our mascot. In the spirit of
the Robber Barons, let's elect Gerhard
Casper to the U.S. Senate and have him
pass a law that will GIVE us the rights
to the Monopoly guy!
GO ROBBER BARONS, GO!
