# Swimsuit Calendar ad allows sexism, racism against Asian females
## 
### 
I was very angered and offended that
The Daily printed the advertisement fea
turing the "California Asian Dreamgirls
1994 Color Swimsuit Calendar" with a
picture of oiled-up, bikini-clad "100% All
Asian Girls" posed exotically with flow
ers in their hair. Moreover, I am sur
prised that the first running of the ad
went unnoticed and no one else wrote to
The Daily.
Last year, The Daily printed an arti
cle about the so-called Asian female
fetish at Stanford and other campuses. I
cannot say whether this trend is the
result of a twisted stereotype of Asian
women or simply a preference among
certain men. However, in my own per
sonal experience, I have been the victim
of a disgusting kind of prejudice — a
combination of racism and sexism —
and seeing the ad in The Daily both

offended and infuriated me. An ad for a
girlie calendar would have been bad
enough, but when combined with a
racist tinge, it is beyond offensive.
Perhaps I am being oversensitive.
After all, this is a free country and The
Daily has a right to print whatever it
wants. But the message I get from see
ing the calendar ad is that it's okay to
objectify Asian women. And I can't help
taking it personally. Are the Asian
Dreamgirls and Mimi Miyagi the only
Asian women I am going to see regularly
in the newspaper?
The Daily has been getting several
complaints lately about material that
readers found offensive. I don't agree
that publishing a photograph of a homo
sexual wedding is a personal attack on
anyone. But I do think it is insensitive to
women to print an ad telling us that we*
need to get rid of our "unhealthy" and
unsightly fat thighs. And it is most cer
tainly insensitive to print an anti-
Semitic document which, even if pre
sented in a negative light, evokes the
hatred behind the Holocaust atrocities
and disregards the feelings of those

whose own relatives were murdered.
We are supposedly at an institution of
higher learning, and I cannot under
stand why The Daily would accept
money to print racist and sexist trash.
This not only tolerates but encourages
convoluted stereotypes. I suggest that
The Daily show a little more discretion
in choosing material to fill up its pages.
