# Resignation of Gibson from Cowell is a loss to University community
## 
### 
I read yesterday's Daily article, enti
tled "Cowell loses four staffers," with a
mixture of dismay and bewilderment. In
the second paragraph of the article The
Daily mentions that Fran Gibson, the
director of the Sexual Assault Informa
tion Resource Center, has resigned.
The few times I spoke with Fran Gib
son were sufficient to leave me with a

very positive impression of her charac
ter. I believe she is an individual of very
high caliber, both articulate and
resolved. I cannot possibly believe that I
am the only person who is left wonder
ing why she has resigned. At the very
least, I would have hoped The Daily
could have asked Fran herself why she
resigned.
In losing Fran Gibson, Stanford has
lost an extraordinary person.
