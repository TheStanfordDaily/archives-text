## Pen computers may ease Med School's red tape Computerization of paper medical records to offer flexibility, better info for physicians 
### Jim Morris Editorial Staff 
Thousands of miles of paper
medical records may soon meet
their demise if researchers at the
School of Medicine have their way.
Senior Research Scientist Tom
Rindfleisch and Senior Software
Engineer Richard Acuff are coor
dinating a project to develop
Hand-held pen computers and
other computerized gadgets for
physicians everywhere.
While Apple Computer Inc. has
the Newton Personal Digital
Assistant) and researchers else
where are working to develop sim
ilar instruments, Rindfleisch and
Acuff are designing the Digital
Medical Assistant,
Utilizing already developed
hardware such as the Newton and
the AT&T Eo, the main focus of
their research is to tallpr these
current products to physician
usage through improvements in
software.

Computerized hospital
A physician using a pen com
puter would be able "make two
taps in front of a patient's room"
to retrieve all the pertinent infor
mation about that patient — from
basic record to lab results to a
reading of vital signs, said Jay
Strain, a resident and researcher
at the Center for Advanced Medi
cal Informatics at Stanford.
According to Acuff, the taps
would transmit infrared beams to
the closest infrared receiver,
which would probably be as com
mon as fire sprinklers in the hos
pital.
The receiver would then send a
signal over a computer network to
a main computer on that particu
lar floor to retrieve the latest data
on the patient, and then go on to
the hospital's main computer to
get the permanent medical
record.
In a matter of seconds, the doc
tor could obtain all the inftirma

tion available about any patient
under his or her care.
"The multiple manual han
dling of records is very inefficient.
On-line records in an electronic
form facilitate physicians in get
ting (patient information)," Rind
fleisch said. "It's largely a mobile
profession."
The device will also be as
mobile as the doctors who use it.
Physicians will be able to access
information via radio waves "sit
ting in their car or from the golf
course through wireless commu
nications and make a decision in
an emergency," Rindfleisch said.
This technology beats the
usual mode of communication on
an electronic pager because it
allows the doctor to view all the
information firsthand rather
than just listen to it over the
phone.
Converting a paper dinosaur
However, this system faces
several obstacles at Stanford
Hospital.
For example, the hospital's pre
sent computer system only allows
liters to access limited informa
tion from immobile computers,
and patients' medical records are
still k£pt on hard copies.

In addition, most departments
have different computing systems
that aren't necessarily conducive
to information exchange.
And the technology to link
physicians in the hospital with
those who are away is still fairly
nascent and unreliable at best, as
is data security for the volumes of
information that would need to be
stored.
But other hindrances are fad
ing in light of recent research.
Since doctors are notorious for
their illegible handwriting, Rind
fleisch and Acuff have designed
their pen-computing system to
anticipate the data before it is en
tered.
Instead of handwriting the
symptoms and diagnoses, the doc
tor will circle and check off cer
tain items already listed. While
there is a section on the comput
erized record for handwritten
notes, it is only intended to be a
supplement.
This innovation will allow for
several changes, including less
dependence on doctors' handwrit
ings, and an increased ability to
organize patient information on a
large scale.
For instance, when a different
doctor looks at a patient's
records, the information will be in
a more readable form. There is
even a function that will convert
jargon into sentence format in the
cases when a doctor's note is
needed or a plain English version
of the record is requested.
This method of information
storage will also simplify the pro
cess of selecting patients for a
medical study. A clinician con
ducting a particular study would
be able to access a large amount of
patient information in an anony
mous manner through this orga
nization.
Many researchers feel the pre
sent process is inefficient and
ineffective in finding useful candi-
