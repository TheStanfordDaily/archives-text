## Work groups on Med Center restructuring scheduled to issue reports Dec. 15 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
A task force appointed last year by
University President Gerhard Casper
is expected to finalize its plans for the
reorganization of the Medical Center
bv early next quarter.

new Stanford Health System will
"combine the in-patient services of the
hospital with the out-patient services
of the Medical School," a change that
has become important as patients are

The organizations will also work to

proposed change, Casper appointed the
seven working groups, which cover a
wide range of topics, including Gover
nance and Legal Issues, Stanford
Physicians' Group and Physicians' Is
