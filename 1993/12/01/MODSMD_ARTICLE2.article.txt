## Work groups on Med Center restructuring scheduled to issue reports Dec. 15 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
A task force appointed last year by
University President Gerhard Casper
is expected to finalize its plans for the
reorganization of the Medical Center
bv early next quarter.
The task force, which Casper chairs,
will create a new health system that
will allow the University's medical or
ganizations to combine many of their
functions in order to keep up with the
changing face of national health care.

Its seven working groups, which
each focus on a different area within
the Medical Center, are expected to
submit their recommendations to the
task force by Dec. 15. The task force
will then use these reports to prepare
more concrete proposals to submit to
the Board of Trustees in February.
Currently, the three institutions
within the Medical Center — the
School of Medicine, the Stanford Clinic
and the Stanford Hospital — work sep
arately from each other
But the task force is proposing to

change this. "We hope to recombine
I these institutions] so as to cope with
the changes in terms of the way med
ical services are rendered," Casper
said.
Specifically, Casper said that the
new Stanford Health System will
"combine the in-patient services of the
hospital with the out-patient services
of the Medical School," a change that
has become important as patients are
increasingly shifted away from hospi
tals to ambulatory care.
The organizations will also work to

gether on such things as joint strategic
planning and contracts with outside
physicians, he said.
To examine the specific details of the
proposed change, Casper appointed the
seven working groups, which cover a
wide range of topics, including Gover
nance and Legal Issues, Stanford
Physicians' Group and Physicians' Is
sues, and Finance.
For example, some groups are exam
ining "new ways of looking at
town/gown relations when the
whole pattern of health care is
changing," as well as how private
practice will survive over the next
few years, said David Korn, dean
of the Medical School. Korn is
also a member of the task force
and the chair of one of the work
ing groups.
Another group, External Affili
ations, is examining the Medical
Center's relations with other
institutions outside the Universi
ty, such as health management
organizations and other hospitals
that provide teaching and resi
dency facilities for Stanford's
medical students, said Dr. James
McGuire, a member of the group.
He said that the group was
originally formed to determine
which of these institutional ties
were good affiliations for the Uni
versity.
However, "the market has not
defined itself well. Stanford is not
ready to affiliate itself with any
one yet. Instead, we are gathering

information on various HMOs,"
McGuire said.
Casper said that the changes in
the Medical Center's organization
are necessary to keep up with the
changes in health care that have
taken place under the Clinton
administration. He cited capita
tion — the policy by which people
pay a medical organization once
per year to take care of all their
health care needs - as well as the
movement toward managed care
as specific changes that will pro
foundly affect medical practice in
the future.
Since doctors will be paid only
for attending to people and not
for the services they render, uni
versity physicians — who often
treat diseases that are more com
plicated and expensive than the
basic problems seen by primary
care-givers — are likely to be dra
matically affected by the new
policies.
"How a [university] medical
center can survive in the new
environment is the great ques
tion," Casper said.
In addition, Casper said that
the Medical Center organizations
will have to work together to

ensure that they maintain a large
base of patients and that they are
in contact with a strong group of
primary care physicians who will
refer patients to Stanford's spe
cialists.
However, Casper said that the
ambiguity of future national
health care changes makes the
task force's job more difficult.
"I have never made decisions
under conditions of such extreme
uncertainty," he said.
Korn said more concrete devel
opments should take place once
the task force comes up with its
own general proposals out of the
details of the working group
plans.
Although Korn said he believes
that the working groups' reports
will be in on time, he added that
he was not sure whether they
would be complete or simply
nothing more than "a progress
report."
The task force's proposal will
go before the Board of Trustees in
February.
Korn said that the task force is
likely to meet the February dead
line. "The president is insistent
that it be done," he said.
