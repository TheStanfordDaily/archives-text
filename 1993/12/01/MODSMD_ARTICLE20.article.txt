## Depression: Product of genetics, not weakness 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
Q: I was having an argument with
someone who said depression is an ill
ness, usually with a biochemical factor,
but I think it's just what happens when
weak people can't deal with life and the
fact that they aren 7 the best anymore when
they come to Stanford. Who's right ?

x"\oughta let Darwinian selection weed
those sick puppies out. The race would
be better off without them.
Not.
After all, I get depressed too.
What's so special about some people
that their mood swings make it into the
Psych 001 textbooks?
Clinical depression is a tragically mis
understood illness. As more information
on the disorder comes to light, it is becom
ing clear that our society's failure to come
to grips with the truth about depression is
costing us dearly — and the currencies in
which we pay range from lost productivity
to human suffering to suicide.
Many if not most sufferers of clinical
depression owe their illness, not to weak
ness of will but rather, to a deficiency in
particular neurotransmitters (specifically,
as we will see below, serotonin or nore
pinephrine).
The brain is a machine, and just as an
engine needs gasoline to run, the brain
requires these chemicals in order to func
tion properly. When neurotransmitter lev
els are pathologically low, the symptoms
of depression result.
These symptoms include apathy, self
neglect, feelings of hopelessness and isola
tion, and — as the disease progresses — a
crippling emotional pain. Anecdotal evi
dence from those who are or have been
depressed suggests that this pain is far
worse than anything a healthy person can
imagine.
Many sufferers of clinical depression,
driven by this intense suffering, take their
own lives rather than continue to live un
der the hellish conditions of the disease.
Going from little molecules you can't
see to clinical depression is a big step, and
this is where a lot of people's credulity
breaks down (witness, the question this

week). Trust me when I say, however, that
although the big shots might bicker about
details, it is very well established that a
large proportion of depressives are suffer
ing from a disorder which is primarily bio
chemical.
In order to attempt to understand how
this might happen, let's look at the two
principal neurotransmitters which have
been found to be deficient in clinically
depressed people.
Serotonin is critically involved in a huge
list of brain functions. Sleep, temperature
control, pain sensitivity, appetite and
mood are all regulated in one way or
another by serotonergic neurons. When
serotonin levels are too low, these func
tions can become wildly erratic. Depres
sion can be the result.
Norepinephrine — originally identified
as a key mediator of the "fight-or-flight"
reaction, probably acts as a modulator of
other signals in the central nervous sys
tem, increasing the "signal-to-noise" ratio
of communications within the brain.
Although noradrenergic depression is
less well-understood them the serotoner
gic flavor, it is easy to imagine how a defi
ciency in norepinephrine levels might
paralyze those brain functions critical to
self-preservation and self-concern, re
sulting in the lethargy and apathy of clin
ical depression.
When these neurotransmitters are defi
cient, it becomes biologically impossible for
an individual to feel good. Our brains are
dependent on certain chemicals. Without
them, all hell breaks loose.
One in 10 of us will experience at least
temporary clinical depression at some stage
of our lives. Whether it started because of a
trauma or a genetic predisposition to low
neurotransmitter levels, it's not your fault
and it's not because you're weak.
