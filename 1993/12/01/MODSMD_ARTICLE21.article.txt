# Chaos more predictable than order
## Physics prof finds chaotic movements obey rules of math 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
The ultimate goal of physics is to
describe the intricacies of the universe
around us.
But the universe is not a simple sys
tem like those found in physics prob
lems — it is full of chaotic particles
moving in seemingly random direc
tions.
Despite these complexities involved
in describing the motion of such parti
cles, Charles Marcus, an assistant pro
fessor in the Physics Department, is
working on research that might
unravel the mysteries associated with
describing chaotic phenomena.
And his results have revealed a sur
prisingly simple answer to the ques
tion of chaos. "In some senses, it is
easier to predict the products of a
chaotic system than one which should
be orderly," he said.
Combined with advances in mathe
matical theory over the past two
decades, the physical realities underly
ing chaos have spawned a new science
— one that focuses on the disorder
inherent in processes that were once
thought to obey simple rules.
Marcus believes that such research
can increase our understanding of
physical processes. "If we really have
any hope of describing the real world,
we have to be able to understand how
macroscopic chaos can be put into a
framework with microscopic physics,"
he said.
In order to produce chaotic phe
nomena fit for study, Marcus is
employing quantum mechanics —
which produces effects that can be
very difficult to observe.
According to quantum theory, all
particles exhibit wave-like properties
similar to those in a beam of light. The
particles cannot be pinned down to
exact locations but are assigned proba
bilities of being found in a given spot
at a particular time.
And just like when two light rays
coincide so that their waves cancel
each other out, particles can actually
"interfere" with each other, producing
"dark spots" where matter cancels
itself out, leaving nothing.
"What you end up with is this weird
reality where objects as solid as rocks
really only have a probability of being

in a certain location," Marcus said.
"It's highly unlikely, but every once in
a while, an object might disappear
entirely for a moment."
Under controlled circumstances,
these interference patterns can be
observed in a beam of electrons, and
analyzing the patterns can reveal clues
about the particles' motion, Marcus
said.

In order to create the conditions
necessary for visible interference pat
terns, Marcus is using a one-micron
diameter — one-sixtieth the width of a
human hair — piece of almost-pure
semiconductor cooled to just one mil
lidegree Kelvin above absolute zero.
These conditions minimize the
amount of interaction that an electron
would experience in passing through
the material, he said.
"Basically it would only be bounc
ing off the sides of the semiconduc
tor," Marcus said, comparing the elec
tron to a puck moving along a friction
less hockey rink.
Altering the shape of the semicon

ductor surface on which the electron
moves offers a "controlled way to
introduce chaos," Marcus said.
In his research, Marcus tried two
different shapes: a circular disc and a
"stadium" shape — two semi-circles
joined by straight parallel lines.
When an electron enters the circu
lar semiconductor, it experiences
orderly reflections, while the stadium
shaped one produces chaotic motion.
By applying a magnetic field per
pendicular to the plane in which the
semiconductor lies and observing the
patterns produced by electrons as they
exit, Marcus found a mathematical
way to chart their paths.
After performing the experiment
twice, Marcus found that the patterns
emerging from the chaotic system obey
a mathematical equation, unlike those
produced by the circular disc.
In addition, while the paths in the
stadium-shaped system should be ran
dom, Marcus found that, on the whole,
the electron's behavior can be
expressed in mathematical terms.
Though his findings are currently
limited to very specific physical cir
cumstances, Marcus said he hopes
they will soon become more widely
applicable.
"We're going to be doing all kinds of
experiments that let us get a handle on
chaos," he said. "In reality, chaos is
sometimes 'smoother' than order."
So, while the universe doesn't
come in a shape as simple as a stadi
um, Marcus's results create a founda
tion for the study of real chaotic phe
nomena.
