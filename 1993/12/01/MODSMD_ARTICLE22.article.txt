## Anyone need some luggage? Grapplers gut Gators, 23-21 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
It was a match made in heaven.
In his first win as a college
wrestler, freshman Bryan Vani
man led the Cardinal wrestling
team (2-2) to a narrow 23-21 victo
ry last night over the San Francis
co State Gators (0-1) in Burnham
Pavilion.
When Vaniman entered the
190-pound division match, the
Cardinal team was behind, 17-18.
The impending loss added both
pressure and motivation to Vani
man's efforts.
"I was focused on what the
team needed," said Vaniman. "Put
in this situation, I had to do every
thing in my power to win the
match. We needed all the points we
could get."
After the Gators' Lee Lofton
shot unsuccessfully for Vaniman's
legs several times, Vaniman struck
with a front headlock and a pan
cake move to pin Lofton two min
utes, 19 seconds into the match.
The pin gave the Cardinal team six
points and a five-point advantage

going into the heavyweight match.
Chris Serjak, another freshman
wrestler, completed the comeback
for the Cardinal in the last match
of the night. Serjak needed to
avoid getting pinned in order to
preserve the win, and so wrestled a
conservative yet strong match.
Seijak scored one point by an
escape in the second period, but
the match ended in a tie when
opponent Tony Jones was awarded
riding time. In sudden-death over
time, Jones scored a two-point
takedown to end the match. How
ever, it scored only three points for
the Gators and secured the Cardi
nal victory.
"Vaniman did a great job of tak
ing the heat ofT," said Serjak. "I'm
a little disappointed I didn't win
the match, but I am really happy
for the team. It's important to
make sure the team wins first."
The meet began on a shakier
note when junior Ramy Saad (118
lbs.) was pinned by Gator Alex
Solano in 3:33. This was followed
by a strong performance by sopho
more Matt Cano (126), who beat
Frances Aquino 7-3. This win was

particularly significant, as Aquino
is one of the Gators' strongest
wrestlers and was the champion of
the Southern Oregon Open, held
last week.
One of Stanford's most decisive
wins was in the 134-pound match,
where junior Jay Jackson com
pletely dominated Gator Rubin
Tamayo. He garnered a total of six
two-point takedowns and two
three-point near falls.
Jackson was pleased with his
performance but believes the team
should have won the match by a
greater margin. He speculated
that the recent heavy schedule has
been rough on the wrestlers, as
they have competed in three dual
meets this past week.
In a disappointing loss, sopho
more Jimmy Aguirre (142) suc
cumbed to a fall by opponent Jorge
Montaro 6:05 into the match. Car
dinal head coach Chris Horpel was
puzzled by the loss, but believes
Aguirre will respond well to a more
intense training regimen.
"He's an incredibly fast, power

ful, smart wrestler normally,"
Horpel said. "In the past two
duals, his typical offense has been
taken away." According to Horpel,
Aguirre began last year's season
similarly, then rallied to finish
first in the Pacific 10 Conference.

Another surprising loss
occured in the 167-pound division,
as freshman Scott Chapman was
narrowly defeated by the Gators'
Carlos Salazar. The points were
distributed fairly evenly through
out the three periods. The match
ended with a close call by the offi
cial, who could not grant Chap
man a two-point takedown in the
final seconds because Chapman
was not fully in control.

Stanford freshman Jason Glad
den, having just finished the foot
ball season, wrestled after only
three practices in the 177-pound
division. He narrowly lost to one of
the Gators' top wrestlers, Polo
Ornelas. Gladden shot at
Ornelas's legs frequently to main
tain control. Ornelas, however,
managed to evade Gladden's
attacks and won the match by
decision, 3-1.
