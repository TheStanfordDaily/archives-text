Hold on to your saddles, the equestrian team
has done it again.
The Cardinal equestrian team galloped to
another set of victories at the Fresno State Invi
tational, held Nov. 20 and 21. The team, which
performed impressively in its previous competi
tion at Fresno, came away with six first-place
finishes while finishing second overall on both
days.
During Saturday's competition, the team
was lead by seniors Jenny Saubion and Quito
Pearlman. Saubion took first place in the Walk
Trot Canter, while Pearlman was tops in the
Intermediate Equetation Over Fences Division
Saturday's victories earned the Cardinal a
second-place finish, behind USC. The team con
tinued its winning ways on Sunday, capturing
three more first-place finishes.
Sophomore Kiran Pandea was the best of the
best in the Walk Trot Division, while Michella
Pina took top honors in the Walk Trot Canter.
Furthermore, in a tremendous upset, junior
Julia Iwamasa finished first in the Western
Stock Seat Division. Iwamasa, who had never
competed in this particular division, dethroned
the riders from UC-Davis and Cal-Poly San
Luis Obispo, two schools that have had a virtu
al stronghold on the Western Division.
Team captain Pearlman was ecstatic with
the weekend's results. "I was very happy with
the team's performance," she stated. "The fact
that we had so many different riders win their
divisions shows that we have depth," she said.
"I think we'll have a great season."
The team's next competition will take place
this weekend at Fresno. Then the Cardinal re
turns to perform in front of their home crowd
for two tournaments at Stanford. The home
tournaments will be held on Jan. 23 and Feb.
20.
