# Cory Sammons: Doing double duty
## 
### Todd Bernstein Staff writer 
Sure, Deion Sanders plays profes
sional football and baseball. And yes,
Babe Zaharias did play professional
golf while maintaining an impressive
track and field career.
Stanford's Cory Sammons tops
them both.
Sammons, a senior, handles the
hustle and bustle of office life as pres
ident of club sports, while skating
around the checks and slashes on the
ice rink as captain of the Cardinal ice
hockey team.
Originally from Chicago, Sammons
first laced up the skates at the age of
two. Two years later, after moving to
Maine, he was netting goals and skat
ing his way through the state's youth
hockey leagues.
As a junior league standout, Sam
mons took his gifltte iJ to North Yar
mouth Academy, a private school in
Maine, known primarily as a hockey
powerhouse. It was at Yarmouth that
Sammons began to solidify his game.
Though only 5-feet-5-inches and
145 pounds, Sammons gained reputa
tion in high school for being a tough
defensive forward. "1 was always the
guv to shadow the other team's top
scorer. My coaches knew that's what I
was good at," said Sammons.
After graduating from Yarmouth,
Sammons deferred his acceptance to
Stanford and traveled to Sweden to
play junior hockey. The Swedish
league is highly competitive, featuring
many Canadian and European players
who use the league as a stepping-stone
to the NHL.
His one-year stint in the league
proved a humbling experience for
Sammons. "1 started out playing on
the third line and really didn't get to
play much. It was rough, but, by the
end of the season, I was playing first
line and seeing a good deal of action."
So how does a high school and
international hockey player wind up at
the Farm? While Stanford is renown
for garnering multiple national cham
pionships and turning out crops of
Olympians every few years, the Cardi
nal has never been considered a hock
ey powerhouse. "I just fell in love with
the campus, and I knew that as long as
I could have a chance to play, I would
want to come to Stanford."
And play he did.
In his first year with the club, Sam
mons was leading scorer for the Cardi
nal and was named to the Pacific
Coast Hockey Association All-Star
Team. Despite these impressive

accomplishments, his game had to
undergo significant changes.
"Even though I was primarily a
defensive player in high school, I
always passed the puck well and tal
lied many assists. When I came (to
Stanford), though, coach [Ernie Fer
rarol told me, that he needed me to
score goals."
What sets Sammons apart from
many of the PCHA players he com
petes against is his uncanny "ice
sense." He states, "I've always felt
that my rink sense was one of my
biggest assets. Knowing where people
are and where they're going to be and
being able to anticipate what's going
to happen has always given me an
advantage on the ice."
Sammons' second year coincided
with Stanford's most successful sea
son, as the team captured the PCHA
regular and postseason* championship.
arnti finished the season ranked 10th in
the American College Hockey Associa
tion's national rankings.
Injuries hampered the team's sea
son last year, as the squad failed to
capture the PCHA title. It was a dis
appointing season for Sammons as
well, as the right-winger suffered a
shattered index finger and torn carti
lage in his knee. Though he tried to
play through both injuries during an
pivotal game against Arizona, Sam
mons was sidelined for the majority of
the year.
Antsy to get back on the ice for his
senior season, Sammons has returned
in fine fashion by relying upon his
tough defensive game and bv dishing
out assists. In only 12 games, Sam
mons has already accumulated 15
assists.
Sammons' other career involves his
role as president of club sports. Sam
mons became interested in the posi
tion during his sophomore and junior
years as the hockey team's representa
tive to the Club Sports Council.
During his years on the council,
Sammons observed that "the club
sports presidents always did their
jobs, but that was it. They never went
beyond their job descriptions to help
the club sports on campus."
During his presidency, Sammons
has tried to increase publicity for club
sports and organize the club sports
system on campus. "Club sports des
perately needed publicity, because
the athletes and the programs were
not receiving the respect they
deserved."
Sammons' goals, both as president
of club sports and as captain of the
hockey team, are very simple. For club

sports, Sammons wants to "continue
getting the fan support [club sportsl
needs to keep the program running
strong." As for hockey, Sammons' goal
is obvious: making it to the national
tournament in Albany.

So step aside Deion, and take your
gold necklaces and your 27 nicknames
with you. Until you take on a front
office position to go with your high
steppin' flashy game, you ain't got
nothing on Sammons.
