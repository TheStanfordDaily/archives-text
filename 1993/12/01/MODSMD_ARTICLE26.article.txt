# Eiser rescues slim win over guests
## 
### 
Thank Zeus for small favors.
As you may recall somewhere amid
the lonic architecture of your mind,
yours truly and the first seven Dukak
isian patsies I had lined up as guests in
this space possessed identical 27-31
records heading into Big Ciame week
and my ultimate showdown with Uni
versity President / Axe Hero Gerhard
Casper.
Like our beloved boys in cardinal and
white, I endured a long day Nov. 20,
compiling a 2-6 mark with picks from a

slate of archrival games. It's a good
thing I didn't call the Punic Wars ("I'll
take Carthage and the points, please"),
or we would all be a little crankier today
However, as the muses would have
it, Casper's day also turned saiierkraut,
reeking of bad cabbage and a 1-7 tally
that left our fearless leader shielding
his right eye and scrambling for the
kitchen. In an unparalleled gesture of
either surrender or cover-up (take your
pick), he served latkes (that's potato
pancakes, for all you Res Ed refugees)
to my fellow Serrans last night. I and
the remainder of the Athens Hillel con
tingent wish to thank Casper, but also
to remind him that Hanukkah starts
next Wednesday, and that he still came
up a pick short.
So there you have it: the mediocre
defeats the even-more-mediocre, and it
is not even a presidential election.
Nothing like backing into the title, I
say Which reminds me of that olive oil

incident with Jimmy (the Greek) Sny
der . . . oh, never mind.
On a serious note, I would like to
thank the eight hearty souls who put up
with my Friday tomfoolery — Ted
Leland, Michael Jackson, Dean Stotz,
Jean Fetter, Donald Kennedy, James
Montoya, Jon Erickson and Casper.
Each provided a unique perspective to
football and the contest, from Leland's
last-minute agreement to Montoya's
meticulous preparation to Casper's col
lapse and more. Their side may have
come up short, but all are winners in
my sportsbook.
From my end, I was glad I could
work the Daily's Greek tradition into a
more condensed format and keep it
alive. Look for the phenomenon to
return next fall with a new ringleader.
So long, my Hellenic friends. Once
again, your final score: Adonis (Andy)
Eiser 29-37, Visitors 28-38. My Nike
commercial will debut tonight.
