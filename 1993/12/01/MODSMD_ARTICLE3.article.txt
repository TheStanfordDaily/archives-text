# World AIDS Day commemorated across campus
## AIDS education highlighted 
### Josh Green Staff writer 
A stark, 7-foot wooden wall in White
Plaza dotted with black and red ribbons
gave curious onlookers something to think
about yesterday in preparation for today's
commemoration of World AIDS Day/Day
Without Art.
The wall, co-sponsored by the AIDS
Awareness Coalition and Stanford Hillel,
was erected as a monument to both victims
of AIDS and those who are now living with
it, and will remain in place today and tomor
row. Ribbonsand pamphletson AIDS will be
available at a nearby booth on both days
from 11:45 a.m. to 1:15 p.m.
By mid-afternoon yesterday, 38 black rib
bons in memory of AIDS victims and 23 red
ribbons for those living with the HIV virus
were pinned to the wall. Underneath some
of the black ribbons people had written the
names of those they knew who had died of
AIDS
"We miss you Randy," one message said
in small print under a black ribbon.

Michael A. Latz, the assistant program
director and outreach coordinator for I lillel,
said that the wall was inspired by a previous
"wall of mourning" for Yom Hashoa, the day
of mourning for the Holocaust.
"We wanted something to serve as a visi
ble reminder to people that AIDS affects
everyone, including the younger genera
tion," Latz said. "There's been a lot of peo
ple who have come by and asked questions.
Some people just stood and looked at it for a
while."
Latz said that Hillel wanted to co-sponsor
the wall to dispel the myth that religious or
ganizations are not responsive to gay issues.
The wall is the most visible of a number
of educational programs held during the
past two days that will culminate in today's
events.
At 12:30 p.m., the Stanford Performance
Workshop will stage a dance in White Plaza
designed to express "in feeling and contact"
the emotions of individuals who live with
AIDS. The dance will be performed while

conversations between people
with AIDS are played in the
background, according to junior
Alyson Feldman, the co-director
of the AIDS Awareness Coali
tion.
Senior Troy Erickson, a mem
ber of the coalition's steering
committee and director of the
Safer Sex Shoppe, said that this
year's World AIDS Day will con

centrate on reaching out to the
younger generation.
"In past years, we were using
older models for a younger gener
ation," Erickson said. "Now we're
making it more self-relevant, try
ing to get it to a college level."
"We're bringing in younger
people to demystify what an AIDS
patient looks like and show people
someone they can identify with,"
Erickson said. "We want to put a
human face on it, and let people
know that having HIV doesn't
mean your life is hopeless."
Other events marking the day

include the third annual tree
planting today at 10 a.m. outside
the Stanford Art Museum. The
Stanford Jazz Ensemble is sched
uled to play a memorial concert
tonight at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, and the Drama
Department will perform "The
Little Tommy Parker Celebrated
Colored Minstrel Show" tonight
in the Nitery Theater.
The week's events began with
screenings of the film "And The
Band Played On," an acclaimed
documentary on the myths of the
AIDS virus and its history.
