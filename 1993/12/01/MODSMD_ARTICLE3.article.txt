# World AIDS Day commemorated across campus
## AIDS education highlighted 
### Josh Green Staff writer 
A stark, 7-foot wooden wall in White
Plaza dotted with black and red ribbons
gave curious onlookers something to think
about yesterday in preparation for today's
commemoration of World AIDS Day/Day
Without Art.
The wall, co-sponsored by the AIDS
Awareness Coalition and Stanford Hillel,
was erected as a monument to both victims
of AIDS and those who are now living with
it, and will remain in place today and tomor
row. Ribbonsand pamphletson AIDS will be
available at a nearby booth on both days
from 11:45 a.m. to 1:15 p.m.
By mid-afternoon yesterday, 38 black rib
bons in memory of AIDS victims and 23 red
ribbons for those living with the HIV virus
were pinned to the wall. Underneath some
of the black ribbons people had written the
names of those they knew who had died of
AIDS
"We miss you Randy," one message said
in small print under a black ribbon.

Michael A. Latz, the assistant program
director and outreach coordinator for I lillel,
said that the wall was inspired by a previous
"wall of mourning" for Yom Hashoa, the day
of mourning for the Holocaust.
"We wanted something to serve as a visi
ble reminder to people that AIDS affects
everyone, including the younger genera
tion," Latz said. "There's been a lot of peo
ple who have come by and asked questions.
Some people just stood and looked at it for a
while."
Latz said that Hillel wanted to co-sponsor
the wall to dispel the myth that religious or
ganizations are not responsive to gay issues.
The wall is the most visible of a number
of educational programs held during the
past two days that will culminate in today's
events.
At 12:30 p.m., the Stanford Performance
Workshop will stage a dance in White Plaza
designed to express "in feeling and contact"
the emotions of individuals who live with
AIDS. The dance will be performed while
