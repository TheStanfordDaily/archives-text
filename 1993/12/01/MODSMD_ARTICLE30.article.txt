Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Allen Drury dis
cussed his writing career and his use of Stanford as a
setting in some of his books in a talk yesterday.
Speaking before 80 people in Tresidder Union,
Drury — who graduated from the University in 1939
— also answered questions about the two decades he
spent as a Washington correspondent covering the
U.S. Senate.
In the talk, which was co-sponsored by the Stan
ford Historical Society and the Associates of the Stan
ford University Libraries, Drury explained how he
formed the characters in his novels. Three characters
in his latest book, "Into What Far Harbor?" were
"based to some degree on fraternity brothers of
mine," he said.
Drury also discussed how certain real-life experi
ences, such as a car accident in college, appear in his
novels. "A major event in (your) life does carry over to
your writing," he said.
In 1959, after working as a journalist for 20 years,
Drury wrote his first novel, "Advise and Consent,"
for which he received the 1960 Pulitzer Prize.
His two most recent novels, "Toward What Bright
Glory?" and its sequel "Into What Far Harbor?", both
take place at Stanford. Drury has published 23 books,

five of which are non-fiction works.
Drury said that he tries "to be true to the spirit of
Stanford" in his novels.
After completing a 20-minute introductory speech
about his writing career, Drury answered questions
from the audience of mostly alumni for about 40 min
utes.
One audience member asked Drury's opinion on
recent presidents' relations with Congress. Drury
said former President Reagan had a good relationship
with Congress because "he's very likable, he speaks
their language." Former President Bush "didn't
think he had to cooperate with anyone because he
could always use the veto," and President Clinton is
"still learning how to deal with Congress," he said.
When asked how his Stanford education helped
him in his careers as a journalist and novelist, Drury
said, "It really contributed a great deal. It gave me a
certain way of looking at life. ... It does help to say
you're a Stanford graduate."
Although Drury said Stanford has changed a lot
since he graduated — "there are many more build
ings now" — he added that "the heart of Stanford is
still here — the church, the Quad, the Oval."
While he was an undergraduate at Stanford, Drury
wrote a column for The Daily, titled "Bull Session." In
his first column, published on Jan. 31, 1938, he
promised "to write honestly, to write constructively."
