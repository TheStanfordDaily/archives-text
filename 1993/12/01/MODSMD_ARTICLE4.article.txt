# Student Affairs could lose 50 employees in latest round of cuts
## Edmonds meets with students to solicit input 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Warning of the potentially drastic reper
cussions the current round of budget cuts
may have on student services, Vice Provost
for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds told the
ASSU Senate last night that her area could
lose up to 50 positions.
Edmonds, who attended the senate
meeting in an effort to elicit student input
about the cuts, expressed some disappoint
ment at the low turnout for the meeting,
which drew 25 senators and about 25 other
students.
"We have a sense of what the faculty
sees as important," she said. "I want to get
as much student input as we can get."
Speaking specifically about the extent of
the planned cuts, she pointed out that

areas under her auspices will most likely
feel a significant impact.
"We have been asked to come under a 5
to 10 percent budget cut each year for three
years," she said. "So we could lose as much
as 30 percent of our budget which could re
move up to 50 jobs."
Although the actual cuts may not be as
severe as 30 percent — which would repre
sent a $5.5 million cut from student affairs
— Edmonds said her departments will
most likely look very different in three
years.
After outlining the process and guide
lines which her departments will follow in
identifying areas that can be cut, Edmonds
responded to about two hours of questions
from senators and students.
