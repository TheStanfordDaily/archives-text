# Student Affairs could lose 50 employees in latest round of cuts
## Edmonds meets with students to solicit input 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Warning of the potentially drastic reper
cussions the current round of budget cuts
may have on student services, Vice Provost
for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds told the
ASSU Senate last night that her area could
lose up to 50 positions.
Edmonds, who attended the senate
meeting in an effort to elicit student input
about the cuts, expressed some disappoint
ment at the low turnout for the meeting,
which drew 25 senators and about 25 other
students.
"We have a sense of what the faculty
sees as important," she said. "I want to get
as much student input as we can get."
Speaking specifically about the extent of
the planned cuts, she pointed out that

areas under her auspices will most likely
feel a significant impact.
"We have been asked to come under a 5
to 10 percent budget cut each year for three
years," she said. "So we could lose as much
as 30 percent of our budget which could re
move up to 50 jobs."
Although the actual cuts may not be as
severe as 30 percent — which would repre
sent a $5.5 million cut from student affairs
— Edmonds said her departments will
most likely look very different in three
years.
After outlining the process and guide
lines which her departments will follow in
identifying areas that can be cut, Edmonds
responded to about two hours of questions
from senators and students.
Edmonds stressed the speed
with which the process must be
carried out. "By Jan. 15, we have
to submit information" on what
areas should be cut, she said. "By
Feb. 15, we will find out what has
been allocated to us. We're on a
very tight timeline."
The University is currently
seeking to cut $18 million to $'20

million from its budget by 1997,
and administrative areas may be
reduced by up to 30 percent.
In responding to the concerns
about student input, Edmonds
said that "this is only the first
step toward student input,"
adding that she hopes the ASSU
will also work to seek student
opinion.
However, Edmonds admitted
she was "hoping this place would
be packed tonight."
"Obviously it's not," she said.
"But we will still try to get that
input from the students in any

way we can."
Several students representing
campus ethnic centers ques
tioned the budget cuts' impacts
on their programs.
"I really just want to stress the
importance of these groups to
Stanford," said undergraduate
senator Anietie Ekanem, who
also heads the Black Student
Union. "Budget cuts will be dev
astating to the centers."
But Edmonds said that her
office is now considering all of its
options — including cutting fund
ing to ethnic centers.

"We need to look at every
thing before setting priorities,"
she said. "I know that ethnic
centers provide an important
educational function, but when
you look at restructuring and
organization, you have to look at
everything.
"Certainly the intent of eth
nic centers will be preserved,"
she said, attempting to allay
fears that large-scale cuts would
hamper ethnic centers' capaci
ties.
In addition, several students
expressed concerns about main

taining the University's academic
integrity throughout the budget
cutting process.
"I think that services that
actually benefit the student popu
lation should be preserved," said
Council of Presidents member
Jason Snyder, expressing his sup
port for the Center for Teaching
and Learning and the Haas Cen
ter for Public Service.
"I have tried to contact the
deans of various academic
schools to see what (areas) they
feel are most important to be pre
served," Edmonds said, adding

that she hopes students will also
offer suggestions as to which aca
demic services are most impor
tant.
Undergraduate senator Gabe
Lucas suggested the administra
tion poll students regarding their
interests, while other students
simply suggested holding meet
ings at residences.
"We are here to serve you as
students and try to make the Uni
versity as strong as possible aca
demically," said Pklmonds. "We
need your input to carry out that
mission."
