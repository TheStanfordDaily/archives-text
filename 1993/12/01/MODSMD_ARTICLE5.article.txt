# Non-senators can't chair committees, ASSU says
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Attempting to put an end to heated in
fighting, the ASSU Senate decided last
night that non-senators can no longer chair
senate standing committees.
The senate also overwhelmingly passed
two other bills: one granting more autono
my to the Publications Board and another
allowing the ASSU to give $10,000 to any
student who comes up with a proposal for a
new business project.
But the bulk of yesterday's meeting con
cerned the non-senator issue, which pro
voked several senators to walk out of the
last ASSU meeting.
"The point is that these are positions of
responsibility," said graduate senator
Nawwar Kasrawi, the bill's author. "The
chairs' . . . actions reflect on the actions of
the senate as a whole.
"To that end, because senators are elect
ed by popular vote, the chairs should be
elected senators," he added.

But graduate senator Neil Crellin said
the new policy will exclude interested stu
dents from participating in the senate. "It
says that involvement of non-elected stu
dents is not desired in the ASSU," he said.
But undergraduate senator Mork Mur
dock said he feels interested students can
still get involved. "People can still be on
committees, they just won't have a vote.
It's a reasonable requirement that a stu
dent who has not been chosen by the stu
dent body should not be a chair of a senate
committee," he said.
The bill is a result of attempts by Tom
Costello — a graduate student in computer
science — to serve as chair of the senate's
Administration and Rules Committee.
"We're all in the ASSU to make a differ
ence." said Crellin, who supported Costel
lo's right to act as a committee chair despite
his non-senator standing.
When the senate attempted to discuss
this issue three weeks ago, about a dozen
senators walked out of the meet
ing, angered by the intense debate.
So last night, senators agreed to a
timed debate to maintain order.
Even so, Costello disrupted the
meeting by shouting at senators

when he was given the opportuni
ty to speak about his appointment
as committee chair.
"I would like to see some vio
lence; I object to the running of
this meeting," Costello shouted as
Senate Chair Greg Waldorf strug
gled in vain to bring the meeting
back to order.
"I'm really upset at this dis
play of childish behavior by a stu

dent," said undergraduate sena
tor Vanessa Alvarado in a state
ment that drew applause.
"I don't feel that this was spon
taneous, but that it was planned,"
she said. "It's amazing to me that
a student would resort to these
tactics."
Despite the outburst, senators
managed to regain order and pass
the bill.
