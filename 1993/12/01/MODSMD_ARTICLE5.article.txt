# Non-senators can't chair committees, ASSU says

Attempting to put an end to heated in
fighting, the ASSU Senate decided last
night that non-senators can no longer chair

still get involved. "People can still be on
committees, they just won't have a vote.

science — to serve as chair of the senate's
Administration and Rules Committee.
"We're all in the ASSU to make a differ

his non-senator standing.

this issue three weeks ago, about a dozen
