# Concern raised about Cowell staff shake-up
## Sexual assault prevention to continue despite losses 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
While students and Cowell Student Health Center
staff members say that the Sexual Assault Preven
tion Program can weather the loss of its only two staff
members, they fear that the program may also be
more vulnerable to future budget cuts.
"It's certainly unfortunate that Caroline
(Mitchell) and Pran (Gibson) are leaving at the same
time. Obviously, it's not an ideal situation," said
graduate student Rebecca Bliss, director of the
Women's Center. "But most of the projects involve
students, and the students will be able to carry on."
Gibson, the director of the Sexual Assault Infor
mation Resource Center, and Mitchell, the center's
outreach educator, are two of four people who have
recently announced that they will leave the Cowell
Health Promotion Program's nine-member staff.
Gibson said she resigned because she had "philosoph
ical differences, different priorities with direct man
agement."
Isabel Traugott, a law student organizing a legal
advice group for sexual assault victims, also said that
the University's sexual assault awareness programs
can sustain themselves for a while.
"This is happening at a time when awareness
about sexual assault is so strong, you don't have to
worry about those issues disappearing," Traugott
said.
However, some worry* that without someone in
these positions, the duties will be left unfilled.
"What concerns me is that there are a lot of
changes, and there's a lot of student apathy about it,"
said sophomore Rachel Katz, co-project director for A
Woman's Guide to Stanford. "If somebody's not paid
to do it, it's not going to happen," she said, "and peo-
pie don't work to get it back."
Gibson's position is in question
due to the recent round of budget
cuts, while Mitchell's position
depends on funding from the year
to-year ASSU special-fee deci
sions.
"Nobody knows what's going to
happen, and that's the scary
part," Katz said.
She said programs such as
"Sex in the '905," which was orga
nized by Mitchell, had a signifi
cant impact on her. "I'm worried
that the things [Gibson and
Mitchell] worked so hard on will
disappear in a year. Students' pri
ority is getting through school,"
she added.
Cowell Health Promotion Pro
gram director Carole Pertofsky
said she aims to find a replace
ment as quickly as possible for the
outreach educator.
"We hope to get somebody on
board as soon as possible, by
Christmas hopefully," Pertofsky
said. The outreach director, the
position vacated by Mitchell, is
typically a one-year commitment,
and Mitchell's term officially ends

Dec. 17.
Pertofsky said that "options
are being explored" regarding the
filling of Gibson's half-time post
as manager of the assault preven
tion program. The position is not
guaranteed for any length of time,
and its renewal, like everything
else, is contingent on budget deci
sions.
"Not that we won't be seeing
the impact of (the loss of) their
skills and expertise," Pertofsky
said, "but we will be able to func
tion."
Gibson said that she had been
working on lowering the burden of
proof in sexual harassment and
sexual assault charges because
Stanford has "the highest burden
of proof among any college or uni
versity in the country. No student
would want to bring forth a
charge."
Despite concerns about the
effect of upcoming budget cuts on
the future of Gibson's former
position, many still expressed a
cautious optimism for the Univer
sity's commitment to the Sexual
Assault Prevention Program.
"I hope they are truly commit
ted to the cause," Bliss said. "I'm
not sure what that means, if it's in
principle or financially.
"In principle, I think (the

administration) is. . . . Financial
ly, I can only speculate; I have no
idea," she added.
Traugott said she thinks the
departure could have a positive
effect. "It could make people think
about how important it is for
those people to be there," she said.
Katz, though, is worried that
with cutbacks and the unpre
dictability of the ASSU special
fees, Mitchell's position may be in
jeopardy as well.
"If her position disappeared,
there would be no resources for
sexual assault," Katz said. "And
there are not that many resources
to begin with."
Sara Skinner, a junior who
was involved in last year's
protest against Playboy's "Girls
of the F J ac-10" issue, agreed that
the importance of the issue of
sexual assault should not be
diminished.
"When you see it on paper, it's
just another issue, and some will
say the University is supposed to
be academic," Skinner said. "But
how can a woman think about aca
demics if she's been raped?"
"These Ipeople in Gibson's and
Mitchell's positions] are things
you take for granted until some
thing may take it away," Skinner
said.
