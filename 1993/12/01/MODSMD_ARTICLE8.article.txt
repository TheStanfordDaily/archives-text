## Clinton signs Brady gun bill 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — As James
Brady turned in his wheelchair to
watch, President Clinton signed into
law the most sweeping handgun con
trol bill in a quarter century yesterday.
"Americans are finally fed up with vio
lence," the president declared.
Cheers and applause erupted in the
East Room as Clinton signed the long
fought bill before an audience of law
enforcement officials, mayors, gover
nors, members of Congress, and fami
lies who have lost relatives to gun vio
lence.
The new law will require a five-day
waiting period and background check
on handgun buyers when it takes
effect in 90 days. It was named for
Brady, the White House press secre
tary who was gravely wounded and left
disabled in the 1981 assassination
attempt against then-President
Ronald Reagan.
Reading slowly from notes as his
wife, Sarah, held a microphone for him,
Brady called the ceremony "the end of
unchecked madness and the commence
ment of a heartfelt crusade for a safer
and saner country."
The emotion-filled ceremony marked

the end of a nearly seven-year battle by
the Bradys and gun-control advocates
with the National Rifle Association and
its congressional supporters. Every
major law enforcement organization
had endorsed the bill.
It marks the first major gun bill since
1968 when Congress — in the after
math of the assassinations of Robert
Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. —
banned mail-order purchases of rifles,
shotguns, handguns and ammunition
and curbed out-of-state buying of those
firearms.
Clinton said the Brady bill finally
passed "because grassroots America
changed its mind and demanded that
this Congress not leave here without
doing something about this."
"America won this battle," he said.
"Americans are finally fed up with vio
lence that cuts down another citizen
with gunfire every 20 minutes."
However, Richard Gardiner, the
NRA's legislative counsel, said he
believes "the bill will not have the
slightest impact on violent crime." He
said that less than 1 percent of people
who attempt to buy guns from licensed
dealers have criminal records.

But the president said that signing
the Brady bill is "step one in taking our
streets back, taking our children back,
reclaiming our families and our future "
Critics contend the bill will have a
limited effect because criminals will
simply buy their weapons in illicit mar
kets.
But Clinton and Sarah Brady both
took note of a Washington Post story
that said background checks and wait
ing periods in California, Florida, Vir
ginia and Maryland have blocked more
than 47,000 attempted gun purchases
by people who at the time were banned
from buying firearms.
"Don't tell me this bill won't make a
difference," Clinton said. "It is not
true." He added that more than 150,000
people have been killed by handguns
since the Bradys began their crusade.
Brady, who has used a wheelchair
since his shooting, told the audience,
"Twelve years ago my life was changed
forever by a disturbed young man with
a gun. Until that time, I had not
thought about gun control or the need
for gun control. Maybe if I had done so,
I wouldn't be stuck with these damn
wheels."
