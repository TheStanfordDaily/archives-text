Kevorkian arrested again
ROYAL OAK, Mich. (AP) - For the
second time in a month, Dr. Jack
Kevorkian was sent to jail on charges of
violating Michigan's law against assisted
suicide. Kevorkian's attorney said the
retired pathologist was prepared to
starve to death.
Police declared Kevorkian a fugitive
after he failed to show up for arraign
ment on the charge filed late Monday.
But his lawyer, Michael Schwartz, said
he had promised Kevorkian would turn
himself in yesterday, which he did.
Schwartz said Kevorkian would
resume his hunger strike in the Oakland
County Jail. "He will do that until he is
released or unfortunately until he is
dead," the attorney said.

"They can't force him to take suste
nance," he said. "That will be a horrible
thing . . . people strapping him down,
putting tubes down his mouth, torturing
Dr. Kevorkian. That's a horrible
prospect."
