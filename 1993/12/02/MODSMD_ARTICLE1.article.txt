# Top prize for SITN
## Network honored as best in nation 
### Megan Himan Staff writer 
Stanford is known for its edu
cation and research â€” and now its
TV shows.
The Stanford Instructional
Television Network (SITN) was
recently named the "Most Out
standing Distance Education Net
work in the U.S. 1993," beating
out 160 other nominated net
works for the top spot.
SITN offers 250 televised
courses annually to 153 compa
nies worldwide and the Stanford
community. Subject areas include
foreign languages, math, science,
engineering, and Center for
leaching and learning offerings.
Andy DiPaolo, assistant dean
of the School of Engineering and
SITN director, said the award is a
reflection of the effort and skill of
faculty working with the network.
SITN is the largest single uni
versity provider of live, graduate
level engineering courses, yet Di-
Paolo said that one major distinc
tion of SITN is its course offer
ings.
"The key to what we're trying
to do at SITN and the School of
Engineering is to give companies
access to premier curriculum. We
think it will be a significant contri
bution to the economic prosperity
and intellectual vitality of Ameri
can industry," DiPaolo said.
SITN's contribution to indus
try is its work against obsolete
skills and deficient knowledge in
engineering, according to DiPao
lo. The average professional
trained in engineering or comput
er sciences needs to be retrained
within three to five years after
graduation, he said.
"Our program is based on the
idea of lifelong education, to train
professionals to be adaptable and
competitive in these markets,"
DiPaolo said.
DiPaolo said the award could
generate additional interest in the
program, which could translate
into increased revenue for the
University and the School of
Engineering. The award was pre

sented by the United States Dis
tance Learning Association at
their annual conference on Nov.
9.
SITN is discussing future pro
jects that include bringing live
engineering classes directly to
work stations as well as opening
sites where individuals not affiliat
ed with a company program could
take courses, said DiPaolo.
DiPaolo also mentioned the
possibility of a video-server that
would allow courses to be taken
year-round. The program of taped

courses would include handouts
and other classwork, as well as
papers which would be graded and
sent back to the student. The net
work is also discussing TV or com
puter interaction with teaching
assistants and faculty as part of
the video-server courses, said
DiPaolo.
Currently SITN offers six
courses on a two-way interactive
television system. Students taking
the courses at one of the six sites
are able to see faculty and students
in the classroom, and vice versa.
