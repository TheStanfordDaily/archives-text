The Stanford Instructional
Television Network (SITN) was

level engineering courses, yet Di-
Paolo said that one major distinc

"The key to what we're trying
to do at SITN and the School of
Engineering is to give companies
access to premier curriculum. We
think it will be a significant contri

and intellectual vitality of Ameri
can industry," DiPaolo said.

within three to five years after
graduation, he said.
