dollars in additional fees for landing in Los

helped negotiate the settlement between
the airlines and Ix)s Angeles International
Airport — promised to keep close tabs on
increasingly strained relations nationwide
between the airlines and airport managers.
The airlines, under protest, agreed to
pay increased landing fees Los Angeles
adopttKl July 1. The airlines will pay
between $16 million and $18 million imme
diately, including retroactive increases to
last July. The airport promised no further
increases before next July.
"It's a triple win" — for the traveling
public, the airport and the airline industry,
said Transportation Secretary Federico
Pena. "Today is a great day for the nation."
But he warned the hard bargaining
could foreshadow tough times ahead. Pena

said he will announce a new policy next
week spelling out the administration's
determination to ward off future crises as
financially pressed airlines and cities battle
over revenue.
Serbs may share Sarajevo
GENEVA (AP) — Bosnia's Muslim-led
government grudgingly said at peace talks
yesterday that it might agree to divide
Sarajevo with rival Serbs, a possible break
through in efforts to end the war.
Such a division, if carried out, would
mean a final abandoning of the multicul
tural character of Bosnia, where Serbs,
Croats and Muslims once lived together in
peace.
Serbs have relentlessly shelled Sarajevo
since the April 1992 start of the war, which
has claimed more than 200,000 lives.
Various peace proposals have proposed
ways of dividing up the land among the
three ethnic groups. Sources close to the
talks said the Serbs insist on about 40 per
cent of the Bosnian capital in exchange for
returning territory to the Muslims.
