## Klaas kidnapping suspect questioned 
### 
PETALUMA, Calif. (AP) — A con
victed kidnapper was questioned yester
day as the prime suspect in the abduc
tion of a 12-year-old girl from her bed
room during a slumber party, authori
ties said.
The whereabouts of Polly Klaas
remained a mystery.
Her Oct. 1 disappearance set off a
search involving hundreds of volun
teers. Hundreds of thousands of fliers
with a sketch of the bearded abductor
were distributed nationwide.
Richard Allen Davis, 39, was arrested
Tuesday in a house where he was squat
ting on the Coyote Valley Indian Reser
vation about 110 miles north of San
Francisco.
Tribal officials said he was not an
Indian and was living with other non
members they had been trying to evict
for two years.
Davis was jailed on parole violations
in the Mendocino County Jail in Ukiah,
a few miles south of the reservation,
while authorities worked to link him to
the abduction. By late yesterday, he had
not been charged.
Davis was convicted in 1985 of kid

nap, robbery, first-degree burglary and
assault and sentenced to 16 years in
prison, said State Department of Correc
tions spokesman Tip Kindel. He was
paroled in June.
There were no indications of any
problems with Davis' parole until he
failed to return Nov. 15 from a family
visit to Ukiah, Kindel said.
News of the arrest, the first major
break since the youngster was taken at
knifepoint from her bedroom, sent vol
unteers at the Polly Klaas Foundation
reeling.
Polly's parents were in seclusion.
Davis resembled a composite sketch
of the abductor and was considered the
prime suspect, said Police Sgt. Mike
Kerns. "We're in the process of develop
ing evidence that will link him to Polly's
abduction," he said, adding that author
ities were continuing to search for the
girl all over the region.
Kerns denied a KTVU-TV report that
human remains connected with the case
had been found. FBI Special Agent Rick
Smith said animal bones had been
uncovered during the search.
Kerns and Smith said authorities got

a tip Sunday that led them to the reser
vation. They declined to discuss the
information.
At a news conference yesterday, they
provided few details of the investigation.
"We'd rather have you speculate than
have Mike and I provide the information
that jeopardizes the case or hinders the
search for Polly — those are the two
most important things," Smith said.
Late Tuesday, sheriff s deputies and
lab technicians searched the house, the
yard and everything in it, Tribal Admin
istrator Priscilla Hunter said.
Coyote Valley Tribal Council denied
any connection to the suspect. The
reservation is home to around 200 Pomo
Indians.
Polly was kidnapped by a man armed
with a knife who tied and gagged her and
two friends. The girls had been playing a
board game in Polly's room when the
man entered. Polly's mother was sleep
ing in another bedroom.
Before he took Polly, the man asked,
"Who lives here?' and "Where are your
valuables?" Kerns said. The man also
threatened to slit the girls' throats if
they screamed.
