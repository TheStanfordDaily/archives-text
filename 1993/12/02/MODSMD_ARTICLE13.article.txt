## Editorials Nexis of information 
### 
AS ANYONE who has tried
to look for old newspaper
and magazine articles in
Green Library's Current Periodi
cals Division knows, searching for
even the simplest information is
usually not a quick and easy pro
cess.
Fortunately, help has arrived.
The University library system
recently made Lexis-Nexis, one of
the most comprehensive on-line
databases, available to the Stan
ford community through the
campus computer network. The
database consists of the full text
of articles from more than 500
newspapers, magazines and trade
publications as well as annual
reports and court decisions.
Lexis-Nexis is nothing new to
Stanford. Previously, law and
business students could access
the service at their libraries, but
the database was off-limits to oth
ers. The decision to make the ser
vice available to all students, fac

ulty and staff was a wise and gen
erous move on the part of library
officials.
Although the database is far
from cheap — it costs about
$10,000 a year — it's a smart use
of University funds. With reduced
hours at Current Periodicals and
an ever-expanding campus com
puter network, on-line research
services save money, labor and
time for the Stanford community.
But the service isn't guaran
teed. Stanford's contract with
Mead Data, the company that
provides the database to campus
users, ends in late February. It is
currently unclear if Mead will
renew the agreement.
Library administrators should
recognize the importance of the
Lexis-Nexis service, and work
closely with Mead to secure the
service for the future.
As information superhighways
grow, Stanford shouldn't be
forced to travel in the slow lane.
