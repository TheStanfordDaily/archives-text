# Education efficiency
## 
### 
Recently, two School of
Education committees —
the school's equivalent of
departments — decided to con
solidate their programs into one
entity, as Social Sciences in Edu
cation (SSE) absorbed Interna
tional Development Education
(IDE).
The move was intended to
reduce the time spent adminis
tering different programs and
add flexibility to students' cur
riculum. Although the size of the
faculty and staff was not reduced
by the merger, faculty will now be
less busy administering pro
grams, and will instead be able to
concentrate on teaching and
research.
Sometime before the end of
the quarter, this newly formed
committee and the Administra
tion and Policy Analysis (APA)
committee will vote on a measure
that would unite them, thereby

essentially incorporating three
committees into one.
These measures show fore
sight and practicality on the part
of the school. First, the merger of
the IDE with the other commit
tees demonstrates the School's
willingness to incorporate inter
national issues into its various
programs. With ever-increasing
globalization of communication,
economics and politics, there is
also a greater and greater need
for international perspectives in
education, a need that hopefully
will be met through the merger.
The measure also would allow
faculty and students of differing
interests greater interaction with
other students and varied cours
es. While the various programs
may lose some of their individu
ality, true learning is better
served through cooperative dis
cussion.
In this case, less really is more.
