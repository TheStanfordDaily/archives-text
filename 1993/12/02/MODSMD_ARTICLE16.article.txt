## Report on women faculty 
### 
ANY GRADUATE student consid
ering a career in academia should
get a copy of the recently pub
lished "Report of the Provost's Com
mittee on the Recruitment and Reten
tion of Women Faculty." This docu
ment outlines problems common to
most institutions. However, the report
makes clear that the culture and prac
tices of a new faculty member's home
department can be critical in determin
ing that member's personal happiness
and future academic success and satis
faction.
The report title is a reminder that for
women the issue is not just one of hir
ing. The key is retention: promoting and
integrating women into the academic
mainstream.
The under-representation of women
at the higher ranks is evidence of reten
tion problems. Nationally, women repre
sent half of the faculty at the rank of
instructor, one-third of the assistant
professors, one-fourth of the associate
professors and one-sixth of the full pro
fessors. At Stanford the picture is even
more dismal — only 11 percent of
tenured faculty are female.
The report suggests that departmen
tal culture is the key to retention. To
sketch out two ends of the spectrum,
some departments have an approach
toward young faculty which the report
calls "trial by fire." In short, the pre
tenure period is one of constant scrutiny

and probation. Only after the seven-year
testing, or hazing, period is over is the
successful candidate admitted as a full
member of the faculty guild.
The other model, which the report
calls "a climate of support," involves
including the new faculty member as a
fully supported and integrated member
of the department from the outset. The
job of nurturing the faculty member
and helping them to be successful is
perceived as the appropriate role for all
members of the department. The denial
of tenure is seen as largely a failure of
the department to select and appropri
ately train the person. The report also
makes it clear that fostering a climate of
support is not a abrogation of standards
of quality in scholarship or teaching.
The issue of departmental climate
deserves considerable attention, because
the problem is not a dearth of female
academics.
The proportion of women in the pro
fessoriate and women Ph.D.'s nationally
has been between 20 and 35 percent
since the turn of the century. Women
are not new to the academy. Their full
and equal participation is.
Currently 15.8 percent of the Stan
ford faculty are women. Some suggest
that women are under-represented in
the faculty because of past discriminato
ry hiring. However, the current hiring
picture is similar to the past. Only 23
percent of the faculty recently hired at

Stanford were women. This is at a time
when about 37 percent of doctorates
awarded nationally (and 27 percent at
Stanford) go to women.
The recently hired women are not
distributed evenly throughout the insti
tution. Twenty-six of the departments
to hire faculty in the last five years
hired no women. Only five departments,
Civil and Electrical Engineering, Phi
losophy, Religious Studies and Physics,
hired a higher proportion of women
than were available in the pool of earn
ed doctorates.
Both the numbers and the recom
mendations make sobering reading for
potential academics. It may also prepare
you for the misogynistic attitudes which
still exist. Recently a friend of mine dis
cussed a job opening with the depart
ment chair. She asked about connec
tions with other feminist colleagues,
such as the Women's Studies faculty.
"Yes, there are interesting gals over
there," was the response she got.
Copies of the report may be obtained
by calling the Provost's Office at 725-
4895. Availability may be limited, so
order before midnight tonight!

Chris can get you a great deal on a lovely
cubic zirconium tennis bracelet.
