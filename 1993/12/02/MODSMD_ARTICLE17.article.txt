## Mascot debate offends the evolutionarily disadvantaged 
### 
RAFE SAGARIN'S Nov. 29 letter
about choosing a new
mascot / name for the football
team contains a very disturbing phrase;
he refers blatantly and disparagingly to
the "Cardinal," or worse, the "Sala
manders."
As chairman of the Stanford chapter
of the Ept Efts and Articulate Axolotls
of America, I must bring to the public's
attention a particularly insidious kind
of prejudice that it has tried to ignore:
genome insensitivity. Sagarin has
attacked all of the members of my com
munity for something we had no con
trol over, namely, our chromosomes
and our genes. He is picking on us sim
ply because we are evolutionarily disad
vantaged.
We amphibians were here first, and
there is no call for human interlopers to
put us down with such rude remarks.

(Lest we be accused of human-bashing,
let us acknowledge here our deep appre
ciation for those kindly and sensitive
Stanford students who help us across
Junipero Serra after it rains.) Any
humans who don't like us here can just
go back to the primordial soup that
they came from.
Students must remember that,
unlike faculty, groundskeepers and
Food Service employees, students' First
Amendment rights protecting expres
sive speech have been superseded by
campus rules; those rights will be
restored on graduation day. Until then
students are forbidden from making
scurrilous remarks intended to be
insulting and incite disorder by refer
ence to race, religion, national origin,
gender and gender orientation, disabili
ties, body habitus or place on the phylo
genetic ladder.

It's bad enough to have put up with
centuries of contumely from reptiles,
who never cease to remind us that they
have sexier skins, can run faster and
get better SAT scores than we do
(though no one has ever tried to make a
belt out of one of us!),'but now a
human, who a few weeks after concep
tion looked exactly like one of us, puts
us down in the most influential news
paper in the Bay Area.
We would remind you humans that
every great being stands on the shoul
ders of those who preceded him, her or
it, and that we are sure that Bill Walsh
would graciously acknowledge his debt
to his mentor and our ancestor, Newt
Rockne. (We don't like to talk in public
about our southern cousin, Newt Gin
grich.) We would remind you, too, that
we are an endangered species, that we
all live in one ecosystem, and that sala

manders have feelings, too!
We ask those who would disparage
us to come down to Lake Lagunita and
commune with us (after mating season,
of course), unless they would prefer to
stay with their own kind and read
books by dead white males when there
is so much about life and evolution that
we have to teach. What is a Stanford
Friday beer bust when compared to the
activities of our Hellbenders? What
Dolly could compare with our Greater
Siren? What campus pet is so beguiling
as our Waterdogs and Mudpuppies?
We are vertebrates all; we shall
henceforth regard any human who
derides us a being without a backbone.
