# Cardinal Kestrels would complement Band's Tree
## 
### 
I propose that Stanford's new mas
cot be the Kestrel, more specifically the
"Cardinal Kestrel," as in: . . and now
entering the arena, Stanford's Cardinal
Kestrels! (Crowd roar. Band.)"
The Kestrel is a small falcon known
for fierceness, and the ability to hover
in midair until a rodent is stupid
enough to poke its head out of cover,
after which it rapidly becomes dinner.
Kestrels can be found around Stanford
(look up on Skyline) and kill prey larger
than themselves. Cardinal Kestrels
could augment this diet with small lep
rechauns, ducks and mercenary
huskies, and regularly team up to take
down larger rodent cousins such as
"golden bears."
The Cardinal Kestrels' fierce profile
and caricature are also easily embossed
on sweatshirts, t-shirts and coffee mugs

(to name a few) which should appeal to
the hard-core Stanford fan and budget
crunched administrator alike. I also see
Cardinal Kestrel-head hats and waves
of big cardinal-colored foam wings with
the tip feathers telling the world that
Stanford is "#l." Why should the
Cleveland Browns' dog pound have all
the fun?
Some might argue that to create
such a mascot would kill a tree, thus
harming the Stanford sporting environ
ment. However, being birds, Kestrels
couldn't possibly exist in this area with
out redwood trees.
Symbolically, the use of both the
Tree and the Cardinal Kestrel will indi
cate our ability to strike both through
the air and on the ground (a feat not
achieved on the gridiron this year). To
this end, I suggest that both mascots be
used at games to double the cheering,
and (just as importantly) to help even
the odds in the annual "Big Game wee
nie brawl" in which several clueless Cal
"students" drink enough courage to

attack our beloved mascot. Just imag
ine their shock when they finally figure
out that this second mascot is not a
product of alcohol or drug-induced dou
ble vision. Furthermore, sales of Cardi
nal Kestrel paraphernalia at typically
exorbitant prices might allow the
Department of Athletics to purchase a
truly adequate amount of security for
such events.
