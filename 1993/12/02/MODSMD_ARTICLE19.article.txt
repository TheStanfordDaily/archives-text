# Pre-packaged mascot means high revenues

With all this talk about new mascot
names, we're surprised we haven't
heard mention of the most obvious. A
mascot that comes pre-marketed: The
Velociraptor.
Think about it. We wouldn't have to
change colors — cardinal is close
enough to blood red. It's fearsome,

wrapping up its prey as the Stanford
defense may someday mimic. It has a
proven ability to sell t-shirts. In short,
it's perfect.
Go 'Raptors.
