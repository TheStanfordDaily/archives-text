## Jim Ho Rights to freedom of speech should not be selectively invoked 
### 
FOR THE THREE years I have
been a student on this campus, I
have watched different members of
the Stanford community stand up on
their soap boxes and preach their pet
social cause sermon without thinking
over what they were actually saying.
And, time and time again, I have wit
nessed the Stanford students' arrogance
and disrespect of those who would dare
to disagree with them.
The more I hear, the more I grow
tired of it.
But what sparked me to finally get up
on my own soap box of sorts and say
something was a letter that recently
appeared here in The Daily, criticizing
the decision to run an ad for an Asian
swimsuit calendar. The writer essential
ly called for the censorship of a non
obscene, everyday, common advertise
ment.

Let's put aside the fact that this total
ly flies in the face of obvious freedoms
we Americans hold dear. I would hope
that every Stanford student is at least
reasonably familiar with the First
Amendment. (But then again, maybe
that's asking too much of us.)
What does bother me is the arrogance
and "holier than thou" moralizing that
poisons this campus. It is not a question
of whether or not a certain attitude or
value system is moral or immoral. It is
whether or not we as a society are going
to be tolerant and accepting — which
any true sense of "freedom" really
requires — or if we are going to force a
certain code of personal values upon the
rest of society.
In the letter the student states that
"the message I get from seeing the cal
endar ad is that it's OK to objectify
Asian women." Well, quite frankly, it is

OK. I could not agree more that it is
morally objectionable and personally
offensive, but it is okay. What is your
alternative? To create prohibitions on
bad and objectionable thoughts?
Before Congress passed and President
Johnson signed the sweeping Civil
Rights Act of 1964, people were con
cerned about this very issue. The act
was carefully tailored to require that
those who held racist beliefs learn to tol
erate their fellow Americans in areas of
public accommodation. The act did not,
however, tell racists what they ought to
believe, and rightly so.
We as enlightened Stanford students
are offended by racism, and also rightly
so. But you cannot teach truth and good
by suppressing lies and evil. It may be a
difficult thing for us to allow extremists
to roam freely in the countryside, but
that is what it takes to have a truly open

forum for discussion, where the best
arguments win out because they are the
most valid, not because they are forced
upon us.
What bothers me most about the let
ter was the writer's statement on what
people are allowed to be offended by,
making reference to the recent gay com
mitment ceremony photo. "I don't agree
that publishing a photograph of a homo
sexual wedding is a personal attack on
anyone. But I do think it is insensitive to
women to print an ad. ..."
I had no problems with the coverage
of the ceremony. I do however recognize
and respect why some would be angry.
After all, Memorial Church is still a reli
gious institution, albeit non-denomina
tional, and no major denomination of
Christianity has as of yet accepted mar
riage between two of the same gender.
How can you say that people cannot be

offended by one display, and yet reserve
the right for yourself to be offended by
another?
Sadly, this attitude is present not
only on our campus but in our state and
national capitals as well. Liberals and
conservatives alike stand up for the free
dom to speak out, discuss issues and
debate, but then cower back on "pet"
issues under the guise of encouraging
morality.
It makes me wonder whether we will
ever learn what true freedom requires:
We must accept the unacceptable and
tolerate the intolerable if we hope to rec
ognize and distinguish that which is
right and good. When will people realize
that a necessary condition of freedom is
to allow imbeciles to think imbecile
thoughts?
