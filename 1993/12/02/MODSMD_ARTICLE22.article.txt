## Ad's invidious message especially inappropriate for The Daily to publish 
### 
We strongly object to The Daily's
decision to publish, in two recent issues,
an advertisement for the "California's
Asian Dreamgirls 1994 Color Swimsuit
Calendar!" The ad contains a photo of
two string-bikini-clad Asian women, and
boasts calendar features of 15 "GOR
GEOUS 100% All Asian Girls!"

This ad is both sexually and racially
exploitative: It objectifies women and
promotes a long-standing racist stereo
type of Asian women as submissive,
exotic sex objects. This stereotype has so
pervaded media treatment of Asian
females that even highly educated Daily
editors, who have demonstrated social
awareness and sound editorial judgment
on many other issues, were numb to the
exploitative nature of the "100% All
Asian Girls!" ad.
We do not seek to ban the ad or its
product from the American marketplace
Rather, we want to encourage the Daily

editors to exercise their right of editorial
discretion more responsibly.
The Daily prides itself on its central
role in the educational mission of our
campus community. Thus, in the mar
ketplace of ideas, The Daily is an espe
cially inappropriate forum for the invidi
ous message of the All Asian
Girls!" ad.
On numerous other occasions, Daily
editors have exercised their editorial dis
cretion to reject ads due to racist or oth
erwise exploitative content. On this same
basis, the editors should have found the
"100% All Asian Girls!" ad unacceptable

for publication in The Daily.
This ad both displays and feeds the
mentality that fuels the subjugation and
com modification of Asian women and
girls, through such dehumanizing insti
tutions as the mail-order bride trade and
the horrific sex industry in Asia. Such
exploitation of women's and children's
desperate poverty thrives largely on
Western male fantasies of Asian females
as submissive sex kittens and exotic pas
sion flowers â€” fantasies fed by precisely
such media as the "Asian Dreamgirls"
ad and calendar. This mentality also
subjects Asian-American women to

demeaning treatment and precludes
their full social and economic equality in
our society.
It is unfortunate that The Daily chose
to perpetuate a racist stereotype while
profiting from, and contributing to the
profits of, a racially and sexually
exploitative enterprise. We hope that
this letter raises the editors' awareness
in a way that will encourage more
responsible decisions in the future.
