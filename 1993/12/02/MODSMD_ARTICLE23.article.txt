## Swimming at Texas Tourney 
### Reagan Dem jus Staff writer 
It seems that the only way any other college
swimming squad can match up against the Stan
ford women's team is to culminate their training in
November, then shave and swim as fast on the first
of December as they will be swimming in March.
So that's exactly what several Pacific 10 Confer
ence schools will be doing when they meet the Car
dinal this weekend in the Texas Invitational.
The three-day long tourney, held in Austin, will
be run in the same format as the NCAAs. Ten
teams will be represented at the swimfest, but
Stanford need only worry about three or four of
them — if that many.
UCLA, California and Arizona are all shaving
for the event, meaning they've already made the
transition from training to full-blown competition
and hope to start qualifying swimmers for NCAAs
in March.
"Our plan is to swim fast in February and
March," said Stanford assistant coach Ross Gerry.
"But we like to get in and race these teams that are
shaving now as well as we can."
Texas, the invitational's host team, will not be
shaving along with the Cardinal. The Longhorns
are competitive with Stanford under normal cir
cumstances anyway, but by late season the Cardi
nal ladies plan on peaking their performance to
unparalleled heights.
"We just want to see how we look and get an idea
at where we are right now," Gerry said. "We have a
history of swimming well at the end of the season."
Senior backstroker Lea Loveless will continue a
personal rivalry with Texas' B.J. Bedford. The two
have traded off one-two finishes in the Pan-Pacific
Games this summer and in the U.S. Nationals.
