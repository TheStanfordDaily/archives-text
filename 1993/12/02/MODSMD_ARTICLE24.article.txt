# Men ready for Speedo Cup

### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
The Stanford men's swimming team is as strong as
ever. And, after back-to-back national championships,
the Cardinal is seeking to pave the road to number three.
This weekend, the squad will begin their trek at
the Speedo Cup in Long Beach, Calif.
The team will be swimming with different goals in
mind during the three-day event. Some will be look
ing to reach NCAA time standards, others will be
improving stroke and racing techniques and still oth
ers will be vying for a spot on the yet-to-be-decided
travel team, which will consist of 18 swimmers.
"This is the first time we'll travel with the whole
team," said coach Skip Kenney. "We want to find out
where we are. It's also a payback for their hard work."
Although the meet will not feature many of the
nation's top swimmers, the Cardinal squad will be
looking to gain valuable racing experience under
championship-like conditions.
"This meet will be a dress rehearsal for [The Pacif
ic 10 Conference meetl and NCAAs," Kenney said.
"Each swimmer will swim their specialties plus
another event each day. They'll swim two events in
the morning and then their specialty at night."
Two Stanford swimmers who will be watched
closely will be breaststrokers Kurt Grote and J.J.
Freitag. Both will be shaving down to aid in their
attempts to attain their NCAA qualifying standards.
"They both decided to shave now to make their
standards," Kenney said. "They feel if they make it
now they'll be better off for NCAAs."
Grote and Freitag's main competitors will likely
be each other and the clock, many of the nation's
strongest teams opted to compete at the Texas Invi
tational rather than in Long Beach.
Junior freestyler Dan Kanner will use the compe
tition as a chance to brush up on his racing tactics.
While other members of the squad, such as
returning individual NCAA champions Ray Carey
(200 butterfly), Tyler Mayfield (100 breaststroke)
and Derek Weatherford (100 backstroke) will be
attempting to qualify for this year's national champi
onships, the team did not rest specifically for this
meet.
