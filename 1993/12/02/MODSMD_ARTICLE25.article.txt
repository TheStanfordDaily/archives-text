## Senior tri-captain sets up Cardinal offense 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
Witnessing the ease with which Piper
Hahn sets the ball for an outside hitter or
delivers her extraordinarily powerful
jump serve, one thing becomes perfectly
clear — she belongs on the volleyball
court.
"I started playing volleyball long
before high school," Hahn said. "I'd
grown up on the beach where there are
volleyball courts about a block apart from
each other — they're pretty much every
where."
Hahn's volleyball training began on
the sand courts of Hermosa Beach, Calif.
In addition to the playing opportunities
that the town offered, Hahn's family was
also a major influence on her start, as well
as development as a player.
As a student at UCLA, Hahn's mother
played on beach club teams in the days
before women's volleyball became a colle
giate sport. While both Hahn and her
older sister Lindsay learned the game
from their mother, the future Cardinal's
career actually began quite humbly.
"I was the sidekick that would shag for
them," Hahn said. "If I was really lucky
they would play with me."
The former ball girl has come a long
way since those early years spent on the
beach. Hahn began playing club volleyball
in the fifth grade and later led her Mira
Costa High School team to the state title
her senior year, together with Stanford
teammate and best friend Heidi Eick.
As setter and tri-captain of the Stan
ford women's volleyball team, Hahn's on
court responsibilities include coordinat
ing and running the offense. In addition
to her offensive contribution of 1,063 sets
this season, Hahn has also proven herself
as one of the Cardinal's key defensive
players with 305 digs, while also register
ing 24 service aces.
"This year she's contributed in so
many ways," said coach Don Shaw.
"Much of what she does goes unnoticed —
she plays defense plus she's got a great
serve both when she uses her jump serve
and when she doesn't. She also has good
ball control and knowledge of the game."
Hahn has certainly earned her starting
position, after putting in her time as the

back-up setter behind current national
team member Kristen Klein. With less
playing time than she had hoped for, one
of Hahn's greatest challenges during her
first three years came in dealing with her
position as a substitute when she felt she
could contribute much more.
"It's interesting because I think that
the roles you are placed in come from out
side factors a lot of the time, and some
times you agree with those roles and
sometimes you don't," Hahn said. "This
year I agree with the role, but in past
years I think I've had some conflict."
Although Hahn was forced to deal with
the frustration that came with limited
playing time, she maintained a positive
outlook on her situation. However, she
never allowed herself to settle for less
than she knew she could accomplish.
"By keeping the attitude that she did
throughout those first three years, she
not only kept improving as a player, but
she made other players strive to become
better," Shaw said. "She wasn't always
happy with her back-up role, but she
accepted it only to the point where that's
what she had to do to help the team."
Throughout those three years, as well
as today, much of Hahn's motivation has
come from her commitment to the Stan
ford program. Another source of inspira
tion which has kept her on the court is a
constant thirst for improvement, both
physically as well as tactically.
"The thing that keeps me going is the
challenge," Hahn said. "When you're
competing and also learning new things
in practice, it may be hard, but you're
honing your skills and always striving to
make something better. When you stop
learning I think you lose that drive."
At times, however, any athlete can feel
the strain and pressure of competition.
While Hahn has always worked with the
goals of personal and team improvement
in mind, the support of her teammates
has been one of her main sources of
strength.
"Above all the volleyball, just having
the friendships and camaraderie of the
team is one of the most importnat things
which keeps you going, especially when
you don't have the desire," Hahn said.
