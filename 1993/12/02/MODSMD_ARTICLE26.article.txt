# Wait 'til next year
## Football looks toward '94 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
A year ago at this time, the Stanford foot
ball team, Pacific 10 Conference co-champi
ons, was in the midst of preparations for the
Blockbuster Bowl on New Year's Day.
But as bowl invitations were handed out
last weekend, Stanford was not among those
invited to the postseason party. The Cardi
nal, with a 4-7 overall record in 1993, did not
even make the guest list.
What went wrong?
Or perhaps the more appropriate ques
tion to ask about the season just completed
is, what didn't go right?
"We knew it would be tougher because we
graduated so many fine seniors," said Stan
ford head coach Bill Walsh. "They were the
heart of the team, it was their ballclub.
When they graduated, we just didn't have
the guys ready to step forward and play as
well.
"It was just two different teams. One was
a bowl team, and the other was just learn
ing."
And learn they did, especially on defense.
The Cardinal's defensive lineup was replete
with inexperienced players. In the season
opener against Washington, at one time

seven of the 11 players on the field were
either freshmen or upperclassmen who per
formed reserve roles in previous campaigns.
As the season progressed, injuries took their
toll on the team, forcing even more players
to be pressed into duty before readiness.
"We didn't have the manpower or experi
ence we needed on defense," Walsh said.
"We were small, and we weren't very quick.
Those that played well couldn't overcome
the fact that there were too many young
players on the field."
Senior defensive linemen Tyrone Parker,
Jason Fisk and Toby Norwood could only
grimace as the Cardinal defense fell from
being among the nation's best to the
league's worst. Stanford finished the season
ranked last in the Pac-10 in total defense,
yielding an average of 465 yards per game.
The defense was most vulnerable against
the run. In all but one of Stanford's 11
games, an opposing running back rushed for
over 100 yards.
"Our biggest negative surprise was that
defensively, we couldn't stop anyone at all,"
Walsh said.
After losing to Washington 31-14 on Sept.
4, the Cardinal came back to win its next two

games over San Jose State and
then-No. 8 Colorado. In both
games, the Cardinal narrowly pre
vailed in offensive shootouts. The
tone was set for the season: given
the vulnerability of the defense
and an ineffective running game,
for Stanford to win, the offense
would have to score a lot of points.
Quarterback Steve Stenstrom
— who Finished the season ranked
sixth nationally in total offense —
did everything he could to guide
Stanford to victory. With a core of
capable receivers, Stenstrom
broke three Pac-10 records and
four school records in pacing the
league's best passing offense.
But Stenstrom could only do so
much. The Cardinal suffered a
narrow three-point setback at
home against UCLA before endur
ing a 28-point blowout at the
hands of Notre Dame. Then, sue

cessive narrow losses at Arizona
and against Arizona State turned
Stanford's season for the worse.
Had Stanford won those
games, the Cardinal might very
well have been gearing up for a
bowl game at this time. Instead,
the Cardinal — owner of the
third-toughest schedule in the
nation according to the NCAA —
was banged-up and faced with a 2-
5 record, and more importantly,
an 0-3 mark in the Pac-10. Rather
than gaining a second wind head
ing into the "soft" portion of its
slate, Stanford broke down.
"When we should have started
winning after the tougher teams
were past us, we were worn out,"
Walsh said.
Though Stanford managed to
beat Oregon State, USC slaugh
tered the squad — and any
remaining hopes of postseason
play — 45-20 the following week.
The Cardinal played out the
remainder of its ledger with the
thought of salvaging the season
and building toward next year. But

after a road win against Oregon,
California cemented Stanford's
season of frustration with a 46-17
triumph in the 96th Big Game.
"We couldn't run the ball, and
we couldn't stop the run — that's
a deadly combination," said defen
sive coordinator Fred vonAppen
of the 1993 Cardinal. "It's like
trying to put a fire out with gas."
Meanwhile, Walsh is recruiting
to repair the damage.
"It looks very good," Walsh said
of the potential incoming class.
"We're pleased and hopeful."
With a multitude of receivers
returning, including Justin
Armour, Mark Harris, Tony
Cline, Brian Manning and Andre
Kirwan, plus a defense with a year
of experience under its belt and
Stenstrom at the helm, a repeat of
this season's performance is
unlikely to occur.
"We could very well have been
a bowl team, but we weren't
ready; we didn't deserve it,"
Walsh said. "I'm hopeful next
year we will be."
