# Wait 'til next year
## Football looks toward '94 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
A year ago at this time, the Stanford foot
ball team, Pacific 10 Conference co-champi
ons, was in the midst of preparations for the
Blockbuster Bowl on New Year's Day.
But as bowl invitations were handed out
last weekend, Stanford was not among those
invited to the postseason party. The Cardi
nal, with a 4-7 overall record in 1993, did not
even make the guest list.
What went wrong?
Or perhaps the more appropriate ques
tion to ask about the season just completed
is, what didn't go right?
"We knew it would be tougher because we
graduated so many fine seniors," said Stan
ford head coach Bill Walsh. "They were the
heart of the team, it was their ballclub.
When they graduated, we just didn't have
the guys ready to step forward and play as
well.
"It was just two different teams. One was
a bowl team, and the other was just learn
ing."
And learn they did, especially on defense.
The Cardinal's defensive lineup was replete
with inexperienced players. In the season
opener against Washington, at one time

seven of the 11 players on the field were
either freshmen or upperclassmen who per
formed reserve roles in previous campaigns.
As the season progressed, injuries took their
toll on the team, forcing even more players
to be pressed into duty before readiness.
"We didn't have the manpower or experi
ence we needed on defense," Walsh said.
"We were small, and we weren't very quick.
Those that played well couldn't overcome
the fact that there were too many young
players on the field."
Senior defensive linemen Tyrone Parker,
Jason Fisk and Toby Norwood could only
grimace as the Cardinal defense fell from
being among the nation's best to the
league's worst. Stanford finished the season
ranked last in the Pac-10 in total defense,
yielding an average of 465 yards per game.
The defense was most vulnerable against
the run. In all but one of Stanford's 11
games, an opposing running back rushed for
over 100 yards.
"Our biggest negative surprise was that
defensively, we couldn't stop anyone at all,"
Walsh said.
After losing to Washington 31-14 on Sept.
4, the Cardinal came back to win its next two
