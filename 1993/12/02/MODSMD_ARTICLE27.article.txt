## 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
The Cardinal wrestling team will
get its shot at the nation's best col
legiate wrestlers this weekend, as it
travels to the 12th annual Las
Vegas Invitational.
The tournament hosts approxi
mately 45 powerhouses from the
West and Midwest, including lowa,
lowa State, Nebraska and Okla
homa State. With this impressive
list, the Cardinal (2-2) expects to
face the intensity and skill level of
the NCAAs, only without the partic
ipation of East Coast teams.
year at lias Vegas, the Car
dinal team finished 30th out of 40

teams, afler several disappointing
losses to stiff competition. Because
the tournament occurs so early in
the season, head coach Chris Horpel
feels that most of the team is usual
ly not ready to perform at their opti
mal level.
Those teams that train early in
the year can expect to hit the jack
pot in Vegas; however, the Car
dinal team focuses on peaking their
skills around the time of the Pacific
10 Championships and NCAAs, the
latter of which is four months away.
"It's like having the national
championships now," Horpel said.
"(Although] we're never ready for
it, just by participating we gain a lot
of experience ."

Of the 10 starters, Horpel has
the highest hopes for co-captains
Jay Jackson (134 lbs.) and Lance
Johnson (150) Both are undefeated
this season afler four dual meets.
"Jay and lance are the only two
whose skills and conditioning are
ready," said Horpel. He also added
that Jackson and Johnson might be
seeded in the top eight of their
weight divisions
Horpel is unsure whether sopho
more Jimmy Aguirre (142) will be
seeded based upon his 2-2 record
this season Aguirre wrestled in Las
Vegas last year and suffered two
defeats.

Johnson also competed last
year, but was upset in the first
round. He expects a more
promising outing this time
around.
"It's a big tournament, but I
think some of us are really
ready," said Johnson. "A few of
us have a chance at winning."
The tournament is organized
with elaborate championship and
consolation brackets in which the
athletes are paired with a ran
dom opponent. Should a wrestler
lose his match, he is not elimi
nated unless his opponent fails to
reach the quarterfinals. The
tournament places eight wrest
lers in each division.
Freshman Bryan Vaniman
(190) views this weekend as a
chance to improve his skills and
experience. "I still have a lot of
things I need to learn, and this
will be something to build on."
