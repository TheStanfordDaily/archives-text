### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
Sunday will no longer be a day of rest
at the Stanford Bookstore.
Responding to both student demand
and the large number of campus visitors
on weekends, Bookstore managers de
cided to open the store on Sundays from
11 a.m. to 5 p.m. The new hours will
begin this Sunday, in conjunction with
the holiday shopping season.
Ken Shark, the Bookstore's manager

of retail services, said the decision to
open on Sundays was the result of a
number of factors. He noted that the iso
lation of the campus causes many stu
dents to rely on the Bookstore for sup
plies, and that Sunday hours should help
meet this demand.
Shark added that visitors often
come to the campus on weekends and
like to buy a souvenir from the Hook
store.
He was unsure how profitable the
new Sunday hours will be, but he said

the Bookstore conducted a study which
indicated it should at least be able to
cover the costs of operation.
Bookstore managers expect the
Christmas shopping season to bolster
sales in the beginning. "We felt this was
the right time (to extend our hours) with
the holidays coming," Shark said.
Freshman William Smith said he feels
the new hours will be a success. "I think
it's going to be a pretty nice hang-out be
cause Sundays are when students have
the most free time," he said
