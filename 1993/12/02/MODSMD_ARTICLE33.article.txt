# Electroshock for your finals blues
## Ed Yoon 
### 
Brrrrrrrrrrrr.... It's cold out there,
folks! Cold as a welldigger's ass in
January. The rain's pouring, your
rear end looks like an oil slick and it's pitch
dark by the time you shove that food service
product down your hatch. Now is the win
ter of our discontent: exams and lengthy pa
pers rear their ugly heads, and you and your
friends begin to look and act more like
shambling, mumbling hermits.
To revive your spirit, here's some somber,
brooding films to warm your hearts and re
lieve those blasted retinas. If you're especial
ly anal, you might want to catch these flicks
when you're more relaxed, back at home,
with your feet propped on a chair, your
heart rate returned to its pre-finals level and
your hand clutching a tall glass of egg nog.
But I strongly recommend viewing these
films prior or during finals as they are in
tended to draw attention away from the
supposed misery of your own life by view
ing the infinitely worse misery of others.
Let's get the therapy moving.
Pathfinder. You'll have no trouble relating
to the chilly temperatures found in this action
film, set in ancient Norway. Based on the leg
ends of the tough Laplander people, this mes
merizing film has a simple, primal quality

that races along — without the use of auto
matic weapons or steroid-augmented heroes.
A young boy who finds his parents and village
murdered by a vicious band of marauders
must survive to warn neighboring villages of
the coming danger. It's a sincere tale of a boy
facing the challenges of manhood. Don't be
surprised if you find yourself wanting to carve
your own cross-country skis and singing
Nordic ballads after watching this film.
Onibaba. Switching gears and countries,
this equally simple but psychologically dis
turbing film centers on the lives of an older
woman and her daughter-in-law who live
by scavenging items from the bodies of dead
soldiers in feudal war-torn Japan. Living
alone in a vast, reed-choked swamp, they do
what it takes to survive, until a soldier re
turning from battle takes a fancy to the
daughter-in-law. The older woman hits
upon an idea that will separate the two —
with horrifying results. Shot in black and
white, this eerie film is never boring as it tra
verses between the grittiness of a war-rav

aged country and the supernatural world
without faltering. It's a scary, erotic and
beautifully shot film that will keep you shiv
ering. After you watch this, you'll be able to
plunge into six cumulative back-to-back fi
nals with relish. Guaranteed.
Woman in the Dunes. With this film,
which was nominated for best foreign film in
1964, director Hiroshi Teshigahara was the
first Japanese director to be nominated for an
Academy Award. Also shot in black and
white, this classic story concerns an entomol
ogist who visits a village in the sand dunes,
meets an attractive woman and finds himself
the victim of a wicked trap. Amazing visual
artistry here, as you watch cascading streams
of sand descend like waterfalls or pound like
rain, with an erotic story that's rich with
symbolism. Definitely not a pick-me-up sort
of film, but your worst part-time job wasn't
as bad as what the guy in this film has to do.
Coup de Torchon. Ever wish you could
just blow away that annoying turd in your
section, the one that has that smart-aleck

smirk plastered on his face and who keeps
breaking the curve? Ever dream that one day
you could say, "There's something rotten in
my life, and it's time to take out the trash,"
and then hang back because you knew how
frightening that would be?
The hero of this film, a pot-bellied 50-ish
cop in some boondock village in North
Africa, has had enough. He's tired of his
shrewish wife, the criminals who laugh in
his face and all the hypocrites he deals with.
So he decides to hit back, with truly funny
results. Packed with genuinely hilarious
black humor, the film shows that our inhibi
tions might define us more clearly, might be
closer to who we really are, than our naked
desires. A complex film, you'll root for the
hero when he decides to clean up the town a
la Gary Cooper, but also makes us realize the
dread consequences when the elation is over.
So, though finals might be bad, try to re
member that the life of a Stanford stu
dent is not the worst existence imagin
able. That may be cold comfort while you stare
at page two of your 40-page research paper,
but for two hours, you can afford to pity the
troubles of a a distant person, and maybe, for
a moment, say that life's not too bad. ■

as bad as what the guy in this film has to do.
Coup de Torchon. Ever wish you could
just blow away that annoying turd in your
section, the one that has that smart-aleck

smirk plastered on his face and who keeps
breaking the curve? Ever dream that one day
you could say, "There's something rotten in
my life, and it's time to take out the trash,"
and then hang back because you knew how
frightening that would be?
The hero of this film, a pot-bellied 50-ish
cop in some boondock village in North
Africa, has had enough. He's tired of his
shrewish wife, the criminals who laugh in
his face and all the hypocrites he deals with.
So he decides to hit back, with truly funny
results. Packed with genuinely hilarious
black humor, the film shows that our inhibi
tions might define us more clearly, might be
closer to who we really are, than our naked
desires. A complex film, you'll root for the
hero when he decides to clean up the town a
la Gary Cooper, but also makes us realize the
dread consequences when the elation is over.
So, though finals might be bad, try to re
member that the life of a Stanford stu
dent is not the worst existence imagin
able. That may be cold comfort while you stare
at page two of your 40-page research paper,
but for two hours, you can afford to pity the
troubles of a a distant person, and maybe, for
a moment, say that life's not too bad. ■
