# Bright screen, dark theater
## Stanford grad Alex Kostich on how to be a 'Player' 
### Ed Maklouf 
What do you have to do these days to
become involved in the Holly
wood film industry? Head down
to L.A. with your script or talent, maybe work
at a restaurant in town and hope to serve a hot
shot?
If you're lucky, you pick up a job as a run
ner on the set of some obscure film and make
cups of coffee for ungrateful people for a year
or two. But what you do not count on is being
hired on the strength of a resume to be Roger
Gorman's personal assistant, and then im
pressing him so much that you end up pro
ducing a full-length feature within six months.
That was the route taken by Alex Kostich, a
1992 Stanford graduate. Kostich's "Burial of
the Rats," based on a little-known short story
by "Dracula" author Bram Stoker, will be re
leased in the spring by Universal Pictures.
The new producer is predictably satisfied
by his progress. Producing, he says, is the ideal
job. "You get to boss people around and spend
other people's money!"
Kostich has always wanted to be involved
with film. He decided to forego the last three
months of high school to do a video project
entitled "Full Circle," a "really depressing
movie" about two teenagers who end up
killing each other. "I don't know why 1 did that
as my kiss goodbye to high school. 1 can re
member screening it for the school and people
were just gasping, thinking, 'How could such a
nice young man make such a dark, depressing,
bloody movie.'"
While at Stanford he took communica
tions courses, but he believes that his best
preparation for Hollywood was "going to the
movies three or four times a week."
It is a major complement to have been cho
sen by Roger Corman to have a prominent
role in his film production company. Known
best as the high priest of low-budget schlock
movies such as "Death Race 2000" and "Little
Shop of Horrors," Gorman has broken in
more of Hollywood's big players than can be
accounted for by chance — Steven Spielberg,
Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola
head the list of directors alone.
Corman has been called exploitative, but
Kostich describes his relationship with his
mentor as "mutually exploitative." He states,
" I get experience that I would not be able to get
elsewhere and a major credit a year out of col-

lege. He gets a Stanford graduate," whom he
pays a "rather meager salary."
Kostich has been producing the film, which
is still shooting on location in Russia, from Los
Angeles. "The phone bill must be equivalent to
my year's salary!" Logistical and polit

ical problems (they have had
to contend with a cur

few, though most of
the film takes

place at
night) have

resulted
in

shooting

falling 10
days behind

schedule, but
fortunately it is on

budget. It seems that
there are some strict rules in

the Gorman camp. "No one works
for Roger if they can't bring a picture in on bud
get," which in this case is around $2 million.
Still, Gorman has let his youngest-ever
first-time producer run with the project as he
wishes. "1 le's really given me a lot of freedom
with ['Burial of the Rats']. It's my responsibil
ity to ... make sure that everything runs
smoothly.
"Every now and then when there's a problem,
111 ask him for advice... but it really has been up
to me. I've made a few mistakes but I've learned
from them."
It was Gorman's idea to film the story. After
seeing Goppola's "Dracula" he thought it would
be nice to do another homage to Bram Stoker.
Ironically, the first draft of "Burial" was written
by another Stanford alum, Terra McCann. After

several rewrites Kostich became involved with
the project and Corman let him produce.
Kostich describes the film as "a gothic horror
about a group of women who worship rats and
dance around naked and do all these horrible

things." In the film, the lead character,

Bram Stoker, is kidnapped by
rat women who force

him to be their
mascot. "They

take him
along to all

these
raids

where
they
rape

and
Pil
lage.
" To

him it's

horrifying
at first, but

then it does

have its benefits

. let's just say that
they're scantily clad and

he's falling in love with one of
them. Suffice it to say that there are lots of rats,
lots of blood and lots of explosions."
Although the story is set in England, the
film is being shot in Russia because of the
gothic locations available in the Eastern Euro
pean nation- Dan Golden directs, and the film
stars Adrienne Barbeau as the Queen of the
Rats. It is a joint production between Gor
man's company, Concorde, and Russia's Mos
film.
People familiar with Gorman's work will
still see some of his signature traits in the film.
It has an "ultra-feminist theme." These rat
women are "totally anti-men." And the male
fantasy-turned-nightmare scenario is also ap
parent. Even though the subordination of all
elements of film to the movie's visual nature,

which characterizes much of Gorman's work,
may not be so much in evidence, there is still a
highly choreographed ballet-like scene which
involves the playing of magical instruments.
Hollywood life seems to have exerted its
mesmerizing pull — even on a Stanford lad.
"It's actually quite fun. 1 think there's a big
fallacy, people outside of Hollywood tend to
think that everyone is shallow and glitzy and
materialistic and mean and back-stabbing,
but it's really not the case, at least not so far
for me. Perhaps I've just been lucky but I've
met some terrific people, and I've had fun at
some great parties, and I really can't com
plain."
Kostich has also rubbed shoulders with
many of Hollywood's elite. He attended the
premiere of "The Remains of the Day," where
he met Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thomp
son. Do we detect a hint of star-struckness in
his voice? "Emma Thompson is just probably
the most well read and wonderful human
being I've ever met." Watch out Kenneth!
However, socializing with the stars is not
preventing Kostich from getting to grips with
the nitty-gritty of Hollywood business. "It's a
very, very small town. Everyone knows every
one, and (although) it is very true that it is
"who you know,"it is also "who you know and
what time of day you choose to call them.
Things happen so quickly that projects get
green-lighted simply because of their timing.
I've seen that happen. It's exciting, but it can
get discouraging."
There are no signs that Kostich intends slow
ing down after his whirlwind start in the busi
ness. He hopes that, provided he does a good
job, Gorman will let him run with other pro
jects "more up his alley." Foremost in his mind
is a film production of a Stephen King short
story, "The Night Flier," which he describes as
"a project I'm really passionate about."
Another idea he is playing with is a fiction
alized account of the early years of the Marquis
de Sade. "My parents raise their eyebrows
when they hear me talk about that!"
Kn&ich's film interests do seem to lean to
wards the dark, erotic and horrific, but as he
puts it"I guess a nice suburban boy has these
dark fantasies and the Marquis de Sade is a
good place to start." We'll look forward to see
ing both that and "Burial of the Rats" at Sun
day Flicks. ■

1992 Stanford graduate. Kostich's "Burial of
the Rats," based on a little-known short story
by "Dracula" author Bram Stoker, will be re
leased in the spring by Universal Pictures.
The new producer is predictably satisfied
by his progress. Producing, he says, is the ideal
job. "You get to boss people around and spend
other people's money!"
Kostich has always wanted to be involved
with film. He decided to forego the last three
months of high school to do a video project
entitled "Full Circle," a "really depressing
movie" about two teenagers who end up
killing each other. "I don't know why 1 did that
as my kiss goodbye to high school. 1 can re
member screening it for the school and people
were just gasping, thinking, 'How could such a
nice young man make such a dark, depressing,
bloody movie.'"
While at Stanford he took communica
tions courses, but he believes that his best
preparation for Hollywood was "going to the
movies three or four times a week."
It is a major complement to have been cho
sen by Roger Corman to have a prominent
role in his film production company. Known
best as the high priest of low-budget schlock
movies such as "Death Race 2000" and "Little
Shop of Horrors," Gorman has broken in
more of Hollywood's big players than can be
accounted for by chance — Steven Spielberg,
Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola
head the list of directors alone.
Corman has been called exploitative, but
Kostich describes his relationship with his
mentor as "mutually exploitative." He states,
" I get experience that I would not be able to get
elsewhere and a major credit a year out of col-

lege. He gets a Stanford graduate," whom he
pays a "rather meager salary."
Kostich has been producing the film, which
is still shooting on location in Russia, from Los
Angeles. "The phone bill must be equivalent to
my year's salary!" Logistical and polit

ical problems (they have had
to contend with a cur

few, though most of
the film takes

place at
night) have

resulted
in

shooting

falling 10
days behind

schedule, but
fortunately it is on

budget. It seems that
there are some strict rules in

the Gorman camp. "No one works
for Roger if they can't bring a picture in on bud
get," which in this case is around $2 million.
Still, Gorman has let his youngest-ever
first-time producer run with the project as he
wishes. "1 le's really given me a lot of freedom
with ['Burial of the Rats']. It's my responsibil
ity to ... make sure that everything runs
smoothly.
"Every now and then when there's a problem,
111 ask him for advice... but it really has been up
to me. I've made a few mistakes but I've learned
from them."
It was Gorman's idea to film the story. After
seeing Goppola's "Dracula" he thought it would
be nice to do another homage to Bram Stoker.
Ironically, the first draft of "Burial" was written
by another Stanford alum, Terra McCann. After

several rewrites Kostich became involved with
the project and Corman let him produce.
Kostich describes the film as "a gothic horror
about a group of women who worship rats and
dance around naked and do all these horrible

things." In the film, the lead character,

Bram Stoker, is kidnapped by
rat women who force

him to be their
mascot. "They

take him
along to all

these
raids

where
they
rape

and
Pil
lage.
" To

him it's

horrifying
at first, but

then it does

have its benefits

. let's just say that
they're scantily clad and

he's falling in love with one of
them. Suffice it to say that there are lots of rats,
lots of blood and lots of explosions."
Although the story is set in England, the
film is being shot in Russia because of the
gothic locations available in the Eastern Euro
pean nation- Dan Golden directs, and the film
stars Adrienne Barbeau as the Queen of the
Rats. It is a joint production between Gor
man's company, Concorde, and Russia's Mos
film.
People familiar with Gorman's work will
still see some of his signature traits in the film.
It has an "ultra-feminist theme." These rat
women are "totally anti-men." And the male
fantasy-turned-nightmare scenario is also ap
parent. Even though the subordination of all
elements of film to the movie's visual nature,

which characterizes much of Gorman's work,
may not be so much in evidence, there is still a
highly choreographed ballet-like scene which
involves the playing of magical instruments.
Hollywood life seems to have exerted its
mesmerizing pull — even on a Stanford lad.
"It's actually quite fun. 1 think there's a big
fallacy, people outside of Hollywood tend to
think that everyone is shallow and glitzy and
materialistic and mean and back-stabbing,
but it's really not the case, at least not so far
for me. Perhaps I've just been lucky but I've
met some terrific people, and I've had fun at
some great parties, and I really can't com
plain."
Kostich has also rubbed shoulders with
many of Hollywood's elite. He attended the
premiere of "The Remains of the Day," where
he met Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thomp
son. Do we detect a hint of star-struckness in
his voice? "Emma Thompson is just probably
the most well read and wonderful human
being I've ever met." Watch out Kenneth!
However, socializing with the stars is not
preventing Kostich from getting to grips with
the nitty-gritty of Hollywood business. "It's a
very, very small town. Everyone knows every
one, and (although) it is very true that it is
"who you know,"it is also "who you know and
what time of day you choose to call them.
Things happen so quickly that projects get
green-lighted simply because of their timing.
I've seen that happen. It's exciting, but it can
get discouraging."
There are no signs that Kostich intends slow
ing down after his whirlwind start in the busi
ness. He hopes that, provided he does a good
job, Gorman will let him run with other pro
jects "more up his alley." Foremost in his mind
is a film production of a Stephen King short
story, "The Night Flier," which he describes as
"a project I'm really passionate about."
Another idea he is playing with is a fiction
alized account of the early years of the Marquis
de Sade. "My parents raise their eyebrows
when they hear me talk about that!"
Kn&ich's film interests do seem to lean to
wards the dark, erotic and horrific, but as he
puts it"I guess a nice suburban boy has these
dark fantasies and the Marquis de Sade is a
good place to start." We'll look forward to see
ing both that and "Burial of the Rats" at Sun
day Flicks. ■

What do you have to do these days to
become involved in the Holly
wood film industry? Head down
to L.A. with your script or talent, maybe work
at a restaurant in town and hope to serve a hot
shot?
If you're lucky, you pick up a job as a run
ner on the set of some obscure film and make
cups of coffee for ungrateful people for a year
or two. But what you do not count on is being
hired on the strength of a resume to be Roger
Gorman's personal assistant, and then im

ducing a full-length feature within six months.
