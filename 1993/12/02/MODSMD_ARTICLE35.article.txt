## The 						inkings of Amer Fearon Mathews Story by Allison Amend Photos by Burt Herman 
### 
Amey Fearon Mathews won't take
anything seriously. Not herself, not
her art, and certainly not the recep
tion showing her art on Dec. 3, between 4
and 6 p.m. "It's my first snotty show," she
says, referring to the series of drawings in
ink on display in the Cummings Art Build
ing this quarter. They are the result of the
U.R.O. Golden Grant she received last
summer.
"I devised my proposal the night before it
was due. Basically I wrote that I just wanted
to do a really big painting."
She's succeeded. The work she is finish
ing right now stands over 10 feet high; she
uses a ladder to paint. It is surrounded by
smaller versions of the same forms, in vary
ing stages of completion. It consists of the
abstract form of a woman? A path?
"1 guess it could be a figure," Mathews
says. "Originally, I was painting tree trunks
for a nature class last year, and this is what
grew out of that."
Spheres appear throughout the painting,
as well as small writing that seems a bizarre
combination of hieroglyphics and Arabic.
"It's not finished yet," Mathews explains.
Isn't she worried about being ready for the
opening reception?
"Yeah, I'm nervous," she says. "I'm not
good at public scenes."
This explains the language that is in prac
tically all her paintings, filling spaces be
tween textures, lines and changes in form. It
stems from Mathews' feelings of being un
able to express herself and her general "dis
comfort in English."
This discomfort is visible in her fidgety
body language. She waves hello, and a pup
pet drawn on the index finger and thumb of
her right hand smiles. The mention of a
deadline makes her run over to her bag and
take out a pen, writing a reminder on the
back of her hand.
When answering questions, she looks at
her art, as if searching for the responses
buried in its language.
The shapes are symbols, she says, and are
"onomatopoetic, but visual," where the
drawing or symbol of a bird represents a
bird. "I have phonetics for some of it, differ
ent tenses, formal and informal speech, but
it's basically a way of communicating with
myself, of explaining myself; it's a comfort
zone."
The words she includes, both in her in
vented language and in English, add tex-

ture and meaning to the work. The minute
details of the writing, often too small to re
ally see, draw the eye toward the changes in
style that the writing highlights. The
words, she says, say many things, from po
etry she's written, to quotes she's come
across, to funny anecdotes, to tongue
twisters, all of which point out both the in
adequacy and the importance of language.
The writing also forces the viewer to
more closely ex

amine the paint
ing. In a work of
the magnitude of
that which Math
ews has created, it
would be very
easy to stand back
and observe the
art as a whole. Al
though this is a
valid approach,
the writing en
courages the
viewer to move
closer to the
work, and really
shows the differ
ent lines and tex

tures that ink and charcoal allow.
Painting, Mathews says, is very personal.
She began painting in high school when her
drawing teacher tricked her into it by intro
ducing her to the painting teacher as a "fu
ture student."

In high school, Mathews mostly painted
with watercolors, a stage she views now as
necessary, but too easy. "1 did watercolors be
cause they were cinchy." Fainting mostly still
lifes, the subject was light-hearted "kitchen
art." She displayed them in coffee houses in
her hometown of Santa Cruz, and managed
to sell quite a few. "The chiles were popular; I
did chiles before the big Southwestern craze."
Continuing her art at Stanford, Math

ews took Painting
2 as a freshman. "It
was ridiculous,"
she remembers. "It
was all in oils. I'd
never painted with
oils before." She
took it twice,
achieving a level of
competency that
she considers ade
quate. "Even if I do
it badly, it's impor
tant to have ideas.
There's always
something really
professional about
oil paintings, the
permanency factor

or something."
Mathews took up ink, her current medi
um, after a drawing class spring quarter. The
natural lines of tree trunks, coupled with the
spheres of tree seeds inspired her, and pro
vided the impetus to apply for a U.R.O.

Grant. Mathews used the grant to "buy a
whole heck of materials: rule paper, a port
folio, lots of toys." She also rented a studio in
Santa Cruz.
It also spurred her to commit to painting.
She paints every day, often coming into the
studio at 9 or 10 at night and staying until 2
or 3 in the morning. "There needs to be a
reason, otherwise I'll come into the studio
and just eat. It's like homework, but more
personal."
The personal nature of her art shows
clearly in the subject matter. "It's the process
of being, how the mind reacts to it, stores it,
predicts it," Mathews says.
She includes writing, both in her invent
ed language and in English to "alleviate the
seriousness, because the paintings are about
being: memory, both restored and clouded
over."
What? Did she say seriousness? "Well, it's
funny that they're so serious." Though it is
not Mathews' intent to be "esoteric," she ad
mits that the dark shadows in her paintings
might be "intimidating, but not frightening.
First of all, they're my life, things that I'm
not trying to do. They're selfish, but func
tional."
Mathews uses blank ink and shades with
charcoal. The stripes of different shades of
darkness and varying lines give the abstrac
tion a ground. "It's less abstract," Mathews
says,"It has only one light source."
The spheres, then, are they seeds, only?
"Yes, but they're also eyeballs. I think the
idea of large eyeballs is fascinating. I mean,
these are so oversized." The appearance of
eyeballs emphasizes the visual nature of her
paintings, and also recall Dali and the surre
alists.
Mathews does not cite the surrealists as
her influences, but does declare herself an
abstract artist. "I like Pollack, Klimt,
Munch. Beatrix Potter did a lot of nice water
colors, Maurice Sendack. But I'm pretty
flexible; I like most art."
Mathews stresses the naturalness of her
painting, claiming that it's something in
stinctive that she does.
"1 guess Poli Sci majors read every night,"
Mathews makes a face, then smiles. "I paint
every night." ■

Amey Fearoti Mathews' art will be on display
downstairs in the Cummings Art Building
from Dee. 3-8. There will be an opening re
ception on Friday, Dec. 3 from 4-6 pm.
