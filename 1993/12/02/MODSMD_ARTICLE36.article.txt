All roles are dangerous. The world tends to
trap you in the role you play and it is always
extremely hard to maintain a watchful, mock
ing distance between oneself as one appears to
be and oneself as one actually is.
—James Baldwin
Ujamaa, mid-October. Two brothas
read a flyer about an audition for a
Stanford drama production that
calls for six African-American men. Since
few plays performed on campus are written
with black people in mind, we'd expect them
to be pleasantly surprised. But the words
"racism," "slavery" and "boycott" are all that
come out of their mouths. I shake my head in
disbelief — until I see the show's title:
"The Little Tommy Parker Celebrated
Colored Minstrel Show," by Carlyle Brown.
Fast-forward to yesterday. The Stanford
University Drama Department presents
"Tommy" with the following cast: Stanford
undergraduates Scott Smith, Tonka Cadoree
and Akin Salawu, graduate students Ray
O'Neal, William Franklin and Lawrence
Jackson.
According to legend, T.D. Rice began the
minstrel tradition. In 1832, Rice, who was
white, watched an old, crippled slave man sing
and dance an exaggerated Jim Crow dance —
"Wheel about and turn about just so, wheel
about and turn about and jump Jim Crow."
Wearing tattered clothes and blackening his
face, Rice imitated the man on stage. He be
came an instant success known as the
"Ethiopian Performer."
White America loved it.
Cadoree, the sophomore who plays
Soloman, had never seen a minstrel
show and was concerned about how
to do one of the dances: the Cakewalk. Grad
uate student director Judith Williams came
up with a simple suggestion that didn't in

volve hours of research or method acting.
"Dance like you're in a fraternity. Like a
Q-dog."
Williams has had to rely heavily on her
sense of humor — producing this show
hasn't been easy. As fellow actor Salawu says,
"Black people arc going to get upset," even
though the play isn't a minstrel show. In fact,
it explores the volatile relationship between
blacks and whites in the context of a touring

troupe of African-
American minstrels.
Williams' reply
to the potentially
negative response?
"Big deal."
Salawu, who
plays the naive,
young Archie, ini
tially had reserva
tions about per
forming in the
show. "1 had a seri
ous problem with
being in blackface. 1
did not like it at all.
The blackface shows
the humiliation and
degradation that
African-Americans
had to deal with in
order to be accepted
and survive."
He isn't alone;
most African-
Americans share his
feelings. They see
minstrelsy as a
stumbling block,
rather than a step
ping-stone to legiti
mate roles in enter
tainment for black
performers. How
ever, this attitude

springs from ignorance of an important
piece of African-American history.
"Minstrelsy is a real part of American his
tory," claims O'Neal, an eighth-year gradu
ate student who plays the role of Percy. "It
was a part of entertainment tradition in
America. Instead of trying to forget about it,
somebody has to write down the history as a
performance art with the consideration that
it was an art which was based on a racist por

trayal of a caricature of a group of people.
But still, it was a type of entertainment. The
blackface is just an integral part of telling this
story."
Minstrelsy was a form ofpopular entertain
ment for white performers until emancipa
tion, when black Americans rushed the stage
and joined in. The black man imitated the
white man imitating the black man, even
painting his face black and widening his
mouth. For the black performer, minstrelsy be
came the only way to put food on the table and
get the white man off his back, if just for a mo
ment. However, while entertaining whites,
black minstrels helped distort the image of the
A frican-American.
In the African-American community, the
blackface era is a part of popular entertain
ment history that is synonymous with a
painful past. When seen in films like "The
Jazz Singer" and television shows such as
"Amos and Andy," blackface recalls the bru
tal torment of slavery and ultimately the
denigration of an entire race.
"I think that a great deal of African
Americans are going to be very upset when
they see this show. Simply because 1 know
that I was very upset when I found out that 1
had to wear blackface in a show," remarks
Salawu.
"It symbolizes so many negative things
about African-Americans that I think that
it's going to upset a lot of people, at least at
first. Maybe, if we're lucky, they will walk out
of the theatre and on their way home, they
will think about it. They will see that it is
supposed to have some sort of greater mean
ing than what it seems like it stands for on
the surface."
The fictional events of the play are based
on an actual event documented by both
Thomas Fletcher, a former governor of Mis
souri, and American songwriter W.C.
I landy. In 1890, black minstrel Louis Wright
was insulted by a group of whites. Wright
stood up for himself and answered them in
kind. Since everyone in the troupe was in
blackface, the angry white mob couldn't
identify him. So they beat all of the men until
they recognized him. Then they lynched
Wright, cut out his tongue and sent his mu
tilated body home to his mother.
With a soot-covered face and enlarged,
whitened lips, the black actor became an icon
of ignorance, not talent. He was a buffoon who
broke verbs, only good for singing and dancing,

tomming and coo rung. Sincc the performers
seemed content, white Americans believed
that the entire black race liked their inferior
place in society. Eventually, the Jim Crow
character became a symbol of segregation in
the South and the image that white America
had of black America.
But to get angry at the play is to fire at
the wrong target. Instead, the pro
duction challenges audiences to un
derstand the lives and concerns of the six
black men, since "The Little Tommy Parker
Celebrated Colored Minstrel Show" depicts
the characters' relationships with one anoth
er with thoughtful insight.
If the play succeeds, it should raise aware
ness of past and present racism. "It's strange
because this is the first time that I have ever
actually really, really thought about what it is
like to be a slave and be like that. 1 found my
self getting very, very angry with the whole
thing about slavery and the way blacks were
treated and the way that they are still being
treated," explains Cadoree.
"In the black community, there are so
many things about the black man and what
has happened to him and how he has no dig
nity or respect and how they are all killing
each other. [The play] is like a commentary
on that, you know. It's about how they had to
behave and couldn't really be men. All the
anger... you can see it. It's made me aware
of that."
"The Little Tommy Parker Celebrated
Colored Minstrel Show" justifies the role of
the black male and gives him a place in soci
ety. I le is viewed not as an ignorant buffoon
with incorrect speech. Rather, we arc able to
see a real person with emotions, and one
fully capable of expressing his feelings. The
play allows us to focus in on the pain and
happiness experienced by the men of the
minstrel troupe.
Judith Williams chose to direct the show
because most people would rather avoid
minstrelsy than discuss it. People do not
want to look at the value of things they may
find unattractive or difficult to talk about.
I hey feel that it should be kept hidden be
cause of its negative connotation in society.
However, Williams feels that it is important
to look at it since it is such an important part
in the framing of African-American history.
"In order for people to understand the
play, they need to re-evaluate their unwill
ingness to look at blackface minstrelsy or
they will not be able to understand the per
formance. They must be willing to look at

history and sec what is there."
I'he image of Jim Crow did not go quietly
into the night. With the Compromise of 1877,
when the North let the South handle its own
matters, emancipation delivered few of its
promises. Later, Black Codes — laws that re
stricted the civil and political rights of blacks
— were passed.
/\s a result, racial hostilities continued to
Jester. Blacks lived at the whim of white South
erners. Even though they were free, the race re
lations between blacks and whites held their
boundaries. And as the image of the Negro re
mained that of an inferior animal, lynchmgs
became more and more commonplace.
For Williams, the images of blackface
shouldn't overwhelm the theme of the
play. In fact, she got the idea to do the
play in part from contemporary blackface:
the Rodney King trials.
"The treatment that the black men suf
fered then and how they are perceived now
was interesting to me. The defense manipu
lated the stereotype of the definition black
man in the (King and Reginald Denny) trials.
There was an interesting parallel between the
riots and the mob scene in the play."
According to Williams, the concept of so
cial death is crucial to understanding the
play. People who were powerless existed in
living death, e.g. slaves, because their master
had control over their lives. So to escape so
cial death, the slave must face his own mor
tality.
"For me as a director, there were mo
ments for me to reconcile. In the scene where
Percy faces the mob, I had problems under
standing it."
Hence her use of social death, which the
slave can escape in two ways. One is a sym
bolic death, where he survives and goes free,
willing to give up his life for his beliefs. The
other is when he is martyred and becomes an
inspiration for other people. This way the
master can no longer have power over him.
An when Percy goes out to face the angry
white mob, he dies a symbolic death. This
analysis helped Williams to understand that
particular moment in the play.
Many other moments in the show will
haunt the audience long after it shuffles out
into the night air. "The Little Tommy Parker
Colored Celebrated Minstrel Show" success
fully examines the power of an identity forged
by both blacks and whites in a racist society.
The blackface as an "other" to be ridiculed is
a logical extension of that racist legacy.

As Percy concludes, "We ain't the only
ones out here hidin' behind this face. Them,
out there, they hidin' too. For the price of
admission, for a nickel, some poor son of a
bitch who ain't got no more hope and future
than me, can laugh at this ugly, miserable,
stupid face and feel like he is somebody.
That's why there's a show.

"That's why it's a blackface show." ■
