## Dull, ghoulish chuckles maim 'Addams Family Values' 
### 
They're creepy and they're kooky, mysteri
ous and spooky, but only moderately funny:
they're the Addams Family. With "Addams
Family Values," the oddly macabre, formerly
televised clan rises from the grave to haunt
the silver screen with another merely semi
amusing tale.
All the old favorites are back. Morticia and
Gomez (Angelica Huston and Raul Julia)
have cemented their love with yet another
bundle of joy: morose little Pubert. Enter

Debbie (Joan Cusack) as the twisted nanny
known as the Black Widow — a serial killer
who mates and then murders to earn her in
heritances. This time around, she has her
mind set on sex-starved Fester (Christopher
Lloyd).
Cue the kids to save the day. But Wednes
day (Christina Ricci) and Pugsley (Jimmy
Workman) have been banished to summer
camp, suffering grimly among the whitest
of-the-white-bread. When a postcard in

forms them of Fester's refusal to see his fami
ly again, per Debbie's irrational orders, the
children escape from forced hilarity and head
home.
The funniest scenes arise from the chil
dren's situation. As the only brunette at
camp, Wednesday is ostracized. Deadpan ac
tress Ricci manages to pull off ghost stories
with such terrifying endings as "and when
they woke up, all the campers' old noses had
grown back!" For punishment, she is forced
to spend hours in the Harmony Hut watch
ing Disney movies, before emerging shell
shocked and dizzy.
But a lot of the film's jokes fall off the fence
on the side of bad taste. A camp Thanksgiv
ing pageant (during the summer, no less) in
which all the minorities are forced to play In
dians might be amusing if it wasn't so scary.
Wednesday's boyfriend is an allergic, four
eyed, hypochondriac Jew. Implication: like
birds of a feather, Jews and the Undead flock
together.
The few funny scenes are created not by
Paul Rudnick's much-anticipated screenplay,
but through strong acting. Though Huston
and Julia border on melodramatic, Julia's
charm carries their passionate dialogues.
"You're sure you're not tired of me? The old
ball and chain?" asks Morticia. "Should 1 get
them out?" Gomez flirts back. Their tango in
a French cave restaurant is perhaps the
movie's most innovative scene.
Christopher Lloyd also turns in a strong,
if manic, performance. His grimaces and at
tempts to woo Debbie (which include offer
ing her half-eaten bread, babbling incoher
ently in her presence and sticking bread sticks

up his nose) are hilarious.
The supporting cast members are also
skilled. Carol Kane plays Morticia's mother,
in a seeming reprisal of her role in " The
Princess Bride." She even wears the same cos
tume. Debbie asks her what she's doinf, and
Kane hands her a human skull, squeaking,
"Just a curse, have a nice day." As the camp di
rector, relative newcomer Christine Baranski
looks like Joan Rivers after yet another
surgery performed by a drunk doctor and
displays all of the saccharine sweetness camp
directors regularly exude.
The one real disappointment is Cusack.
After her hilarious character portrait in
"Working Girl," I expected a competent, if
not comedic, portrayal. But she falls into the
overacting trap in her portrayal of the mur
derous nanny.
However, director Barry Sonnenfeld cap
tures the macabre spirit, bringing a distinct
look to the film. A close-up of Morticia's
white, scaled finger and long red nail ringing
a doorbell sends shivers down the audience's
spine. The costumes are elaborate, and the
makeup believable. As in the first movie, the
special effects with Thing, the disembodied
but animate hand, are impressive.
"Addams Family Values" does not claim to
be anything but what it is, a silly, holiday gig
gler. If your pre-adolescent sensibilities are
not long gone, or if your dorm makes an out
ing, tag along, but don't go out of your way to
catch this flick. If you want to see warped
monsters posited as the ideal functional fam
ily, watch "90210" instead.
