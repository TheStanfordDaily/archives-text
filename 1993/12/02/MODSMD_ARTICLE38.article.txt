## Josh and S.A.M. 
### 
Did you ever tell your little brother that he
was adopted? Did your big sis ever tell you
that she possessed special magical powers
that would allow her do horrible things to
your body if you didn't stop bugging her? Di
rector Billy Weber's "Josh & S.A.M." brings
such happy childhood memories to mind as
it divulges the story of two troubled brothers,
shuttled back and forth between their moth
er's home in Florida and their father's new
household in California, complete with step
mom and two bullying stepbrothers.
Josh (Jacob Tierney) is an unathletic 12-
year-old computer whiz who can fast-talk his
way out of any scrape. Sam (Noah Fleiss) is an

athletically talented,
troubled 8-year-old
who can't control his
aggressive behavior —
or pass the second
grade. After a typical
sibling brawl, Josh
convinces Sam that he
is a "Strategically Al
tered Mutant," sold by
their parents to the
Pentagon to be turned
into a child warrior
and sent to fight in a

secret war in Africa. Sam falls for the tale, as
all younger sibs do at one time or another.
During a commute, the boys' plane is
grounded in Dallas and a call home to mom re
veals the increasingly permanent presence of
her slimy French boyfriend, so Josh decides to
run away. Through a series of convoluted cir
cumstances, Josh becomes convinced that he
has killed a drunk named Derek and heads for
Canada, where, Josh tells his little brother, the
Pentagon can't grab Sam.
The film's high points come with the boys'
adventures on the road, financed by copies of
the French boyfriend's credit cards. It is here
that they encounter such characters as Alison
(Martha Plimpton), who becomes their dri
ver and, to Josh's dismay, plays along with the
lie and tells Sam that she is the Liberty Maid,
an underground freedom fighter fighting to
save child warriors from the U.S. government.
The movie finally rolls to its happy Holly
wood ending, yet the journey surprisingly
doesn't make you too car-sick. In fact, the
scenery is great in and of itself. While the plot
wears thin at points, and the ineptitude of the
parents is downright unbelievable, the movie
is carried by the very creditable acting of
newcomers Tierney and Fleiss.
Yes, it is a cutesy road movie about the
troubled products of a broken home, but its
humor and terrific scenery make it well
worth the six bucks — if you're under 12.
