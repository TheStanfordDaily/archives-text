# Wild West
## 
### 
When most of us think of Nashville, we
think of bearded white men clad in plaid
shirts playing guitar or busty blonde
chanteuses in sequined dresses. We may even
recall Robert Altman's classic film of the same
name. What probably doesn't come to mind
is a trio of Pakistani brothers and a Sikh
drummer in West London trying to make it
to Nashville as a country and western band.
That's the premise of "Wild West," the
charming, funny, but ultimately insubstan
tial new film from British director David
Attwood. Naveen Andrews ("London Kills
Me") stars as Zaf, the oldest brother, for
whom Nashville is an obsession. By day he
struggles to hold down a job, much to his
mother's consternation. By night, he and his
bandmates take to the stage, pumping out
their Steve Earle-inspired tunes.
Zaf meets Rifat (Sarita Choudhury of
"Mississippi Masala"), who is abused by her
white husband, Tony. He convinces her to
leave Tony and join the band as their new lead
singer. The music takes off, but life only gets
harder as a violent group of neighborhood
boys threaten the trio and Zaf finds it even
more difficult to stay employed. It's a Pak
istani "Commitments" — with a darkly
comic edge.

Andrews and Choudhury are the best
thing about "Wild West." Both have such
charming personalities and appealing looks
that we know they'll get together — they're
the best-looking people in the film. Almost as
winning are Ronny Jhutti and Ravi Kapoor,
who play Zaf's zany brothers.
It's great to see a film that places East In
dian characters and dilemmas at its fore
front. Unfortunately, neither the script nor
the direction is up to the task. Hampered by
a low budget, the film isn't helped by direc
tor Attwood's penchant for motion sick
ness-inducing hand-held shots, amateurish
framing and clumsy editing. The result
leaves a strong cast in search of a good
movie. Still, once you've seen everything at
the local gogolplex or art house, there arc
worse fates than spending 85 minutes in the
"Wild West."
