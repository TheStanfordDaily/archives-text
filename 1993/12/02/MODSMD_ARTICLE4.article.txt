# Women faculty report sparks concern, draws several profs to senate
## Five female senators submit resolution urging University to follow up on report 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Approximately 20 faculty members who
are not senators are planning to attend
today's Faculty Senate meeting to show
their concern for a report that shows Stan
ford trailing behind its peers in the recruit
ment and retention of female faculty.
The Report of the Provost's Committee
on the Recruitment and Retention of
Women Faculty, which the senate will dis

senate's discussion will be like, and to see

the commitment that (Provost Condoleez

fessor and associate dean of education, who
is also a member of the senate and chair of
the committee.
The report on women faculty highlights
the specific areas where the University is
deficient in its female faculty retention and
recruitment practices and also makes a
number of recommendations for change,
including the creation of greater support
networks for all junior faculty and an in
crease in the number and percentage of
women faculty.
Although most of the additional faculty
members at the meeting will be there to lis
ten, a few are scheduled to speak as well.
"I want to be there to observe and sup
port the female faculty senators who have
to stand up for all of us. ... I may feel that
they have said it all, but I also feel like I
need to be there to monitor it," said
Katherine O'Hanlan, a professor of gyne
