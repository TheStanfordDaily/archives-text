# Women faculty report sparks concern, draws several profs to senate
## Five female senators submit resolution urging University to follow up on report 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Approximately 20 faculty members who
are not senators are planning to attend
today's Faculty Senate meeting to show
their concern for a report that shows Stan
ford trailing behind its peers in the recruit
ment and retention of female faculty.
The Report of the Provost's Committee
on the Recruitment and Retention of
Women Faculty, which the senate will dis
cuss this afternoon, finds that — when
compared to other Ivy League or Pac-10
schools — the University employs the
third-lowest percentage of women faculty.
The non-senators are attending this af
ternoon's meeting both to watch the sen
ate's deliberations and to lend support to a
resolution proposed by five of the female
senators that urges the University admin
istration to take the report seriously.
"They're coming because they are inter
ested in what happens. This affects them
enormously, so they want to hear what the
senate's discussion will be like, and to see

the commitment that (Provost Condoleez
za Rice] will make," said Myra Strober, pro
fessor and associate dean of education, who
is also a member of the senate and chair of
the committee.
The report on women faculty highlights
the specific areas where the University is
deficient in its female faculty retention and
recruitment practices and also makes a
number of recommendations for change,
including the creation of greater support
networks for all junior faculty and an in
crease in the number and percentage of
women faculty.
Although most of the additional faculty
members at the meeting will be there to lis
ten, a few are scheduled to speak as well.
"I want to be there to observe and sup
port the female faculty senators who have
to stand up for all of us. ... I may feel that
they have said it all, but I also feel like I
need to be there to monitor it," said
Katherine O'Hanlan, a professor of gyne
cology and obstetrics and one of the sched-
uled speakers.
For the most part, the faculty
spectators said they wish to
ensure that the senate take the
report's findings seriously.
"I am the chair of a depart
ment with five faculty members
who are women," said Anthro
pology Prof. George Collier,
another scheduled speaker. "I
want to underscore the impor
tance ... of having a critical
mass of women in the depart
ment."
It is not unusual for there to
be guests of the senate, said
Biology Prof. Patricia Jones,
who chairs the senate, adding
that the number of people
scheduled to show up to today's
meeting is "nowhere near how
many came to the Western Cul
ture and CIV debate a few years
ago."
However, Jones also said that
some time has passed since an
issue in the senate sparked this

much interest.
Although the report gives a
number of recommendations for
change, it does not make a specif
ic proposal for the implementa
tion of these changes. As a result,
five of the female faculty sena
tors have submitted a resolution
to the senate asking that "the
University administration treat
this report with the utmost seri
ousness."
"We are saying that we would
like the administration to follow
up on the report. It's a very good
report, with a lot of very good
information — now let's follow
up on it," said Industrial Engi
neering Prof. Elisabeth Pate-
Cornell, one of the five women
who drafted the resolution.
The other four senators who
submitted the resolution are
Pediatrics Prof. Ann Arvin, Lin
guistics and English Prof. Eliza
beth Traugott, Anthropology
Prof. Sylvia Yanagisako and
Assoc. Political Science Prof.
Terry Karl.
The resolution also includes
five recommendations that

approximate those of the report
itself. Jones and Pate-Cornell
both said they believe the resolu
tion will pass with no surprises.
"There is going to be a good
discussion, but there is a good
probability of it passing," said
Pate-Cornell, adding that the
presence of the faculty observers
will lend credibility to both the
report and the resolution.
Jones also said that the reso
lution gives the senate an oppor
tunity to indicate support for the
recommendations.
The committee's 16 recom
mendations fall under four cate
gories which are echoed in the
resolution to the senate. They
suggest that the University:
• create a culture of faculty
support,
• increase the number and
percentage of women faculty,
• promote salary equity and
use benefits to enhance recruit
ment and retention of women
faculty and
• assist faculty to combine
work and family.
The committee, which was

appointed by then-Provost Ger
ald Lieberman in 1992, spent
eight months examining num
bers and talking to male and
female junior faculty and depart
ment chairs.
From their research, commit
tee members found that lack of a
community of support for junior
faculty members of both sexes
led specifically to a decrease in
the recruitment and retention of
women.
In addition, the committee
found evidence of gender-based
salary inequities, and learned
that both male and female junior
faculty often found it difficult to
balance the demands of home
with a strenuous career.
The 73-page report originally
contained almost 10 pages
worth of quotes from junior fac
ulty interviewed by the commit
tee. However, those quotes were
cut from a later version of the
report when several people,
including a number of deans,
noted that the speakers — who
had been promised anonymity
— were potentially identifiable.
