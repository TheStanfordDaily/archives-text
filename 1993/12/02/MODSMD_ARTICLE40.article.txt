# 'Thirteen' and good
## Teenage Fanclub's latest soars above the norm 
### 
What's happened to Teenage Fanclub in
the last couple of years to transform them
from the darlings of alternative music into an
unrecognized, under appreciated talent?
The band hasn't lost its delightful style —
the Scottish pop quartet continues in its lat
est release "Thirteen" to work with the time
less combination of melodious lyrics and
blistering guitar work heard on the 1991 clas
sic "Bandwagonesque." Instead, the problem
lies with the ever-fickle world of modern
rock — it can't bear to admit that what was
good last year still might be.
Just last spring, anyone who was hip pro
claimed Teenage Fanclub to be the "Next Big
Thing." With a No. 1 album on college radio
and the "blessing" of Rolling Stone's "Hot
Band of 1992," the band got extensive airplay
on MTV, frighteningly favorable press and a
performance on "Saturday Night Live."
Everyone was jumping on the Teenage Fan
club bandwagon.
Now they've jumped off. For the most
part, critics have given condescending praise,
patting the band's back for achieving "mod
est" goals with their latest album. Or they've
been attacked for doing nothing "new."
There's little hope "Thirteen" will garner the
attention "Bandwagonesque" did.
That's a shame. While their angst-ridden
counterparts blindly struggle to find their
own groundbreaking sound, Teenage Fan
club continues to soar above them by per
fecting the classic melody. The Scots play
such sublime pop on "Thirteen" that they
don't need to blaze new trails.
In "Thirteen," Teenage Fanclub takes
standard rock elements and molds them into
something comfortable and refreshing. This
band of interchangeable songwriters takes
sing-along lyrics reminiscent of the Beatles
and adds them to the grungy guitar work

prevalent in today's post-punk movement.
Take the album's first single, "HangOn," as
a sterling example. The guitars grind like an
intro to a Dinosaur Jr. song, only to reach the
climax in bassist Gerard Love's harmonious
voice. A crunch of guitar, accompanied by the
humming of the other players, provides a nice
background to Love's pretty singing. As the
song reaches the inevitable chorus of "Hang
on, hang on," guitarist Norman Blake chimes
in with his support, enticing the listener to
join in. Throw in an instrumental at the end
and you have a Teenage Fanclub epic.
"Thirteen" 's three-minute pop songs
capture this synthesis of rock forms as well.
"Radio" epitomizes how appealing these pop
ditties are. While the band blasts with fierce
and furious guitar riffs, Love lays his tuneful
voice on top of the din of sound. The song
emanates an attractive intensity the mellow
Scots rarely demonstrate.
This outstanding song also showcases the
wit Teenage Fanclub is known for. Although
the lyrics seem sugary and trivial, there are
bits of cynicism and honesty which redeem
and elevate them above silly ear candy. The
band takes a shot at trendiness in verses like
"Did you when I was young / I'd paint my
face / With the latest craze." Love continues,
imploring his love to shun fashion and "Find
a phrase that fits / And stay there for a while."
Teenage Fanclub's appeal shines through
in the combination of personal lyrics and
smirking humor. They sing about everyday
emotional highs and lows, about being
"cool" in an honest and witty way. For in
stance, it's easier to smile than cringe when
Blake repeats the chorus of "I'm in love with
you" endlessly in "Norman 3." This attitude
makes Teenage Fanclub far more accessible
than their counterparts who bemoan the
"difficulties" of fame and fortune.

Sing-song melodies, solid musicianship, a
sense of humor tinged with truthful reflec
tion — these ingredients make "Thirteen"
one of the most underappreciated, yet excit

ing albums of 1993. Forget what's trendy and
enjoy what's good. Jump on the Teenage Fan
club bandwagon.

Though critical response would lead you to think otherwise, Teenage Fanclub is not
dead. In fact, their latest album "Thirteen," makes most of the competition look sopho
moric.
