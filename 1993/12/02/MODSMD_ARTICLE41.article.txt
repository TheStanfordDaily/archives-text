## "Body-Hat Syndrome" Digital Underground 
### 
If you believe in abstinence, then Digital
Underground's "The Body-Hat Syndrome"
may not be for you.
The album's cover sports a cartoon draw
ing of a giant condom, inside of which is the
whole Underground crew cowering within
their latex covering. And what could they be
scared of? The K.K.K., I.A.P. 1)., the govern
ment and AIDS, to name a few. But they
needn't be afraid of losing touch with the

vibes of the under
ground.
More innovative
than D.U.'s sopho
more release "Sons
of the I'," Shock (»
and company pack
"Syndrome" with a
zany blend of sexu
ally explicit lyrics
and George Clin
ton-derived tunk
that is so potent its

vapors rise from the album cover.
Rapping over samples from Parliament's
"Aqua Boogie," Humpty explains in "Return
of the Crazy One," that he's been "laughing
and fishing and camping / out renting boats
in the Hamptons." All by itself, "Return"
proves that Digital Underground can still
throw down original-sounding, boomin' sys
tem jam.
But wait — it gets better. The adventure
in funk continues as D. U. first explain how
they're "paving the way / saving the day" with
the innovative "Carry The Way (Along
Time)" and then comment on wearisome
groupies in "Bran Nu Swetta."
While the "Doowutchyalike" attitude of
" The Body-Hat Syndrome" makes the mis
chief in your soul come to life, the album has
a serious side as well. "Wussup Wit The l.uv"
offers a somber social commentary about the
situation of blacks in America, while the title
track "Body-Hats" warns against F.A.D.E.S.
(Falsely Acquired Diluted Educational Syn
drome), something that "all the funky young
minds" need protection against.
The Underground has delivered and it's
not the same old song.
