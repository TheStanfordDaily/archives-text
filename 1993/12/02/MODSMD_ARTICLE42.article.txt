# "The Black Rider" Tom Waits
## 
### 
Tom Waits' album, inspired by and titled
after the opera "The Black Rider," met with
hesitation from those who equated it with
reading a play before seeing it produced, the
composer-musician says in his press releases.
Although Waits wrote the music for the
critically acclaimed opera based on a Ger
manic folk tale, "The Black Rider" album is
not an original score. In fact, none of its
songs have any resemblance to the opera's
music except that they stemmed from the
same inspiration point. "I was hoping that
the record could just be a record," Waits ex
plains.
The album achieves this self-sufficiency,
so much so that in fact it is no longer "just a
record." Instead, it "reads" like a modernist
interpretation of the original opera and a
Grimm Brothers-esque story — channeled
through the haunting collaboration of Waits'
raspy crooner's voice and his band's distinc
tive instrumentation, ranging from the ever
present bass clarinet to a musical saw.

The result is a dark, eclectic but often
comical succession of musings that vaguely
sketch out a story that is as relevant to mod
ern times as it is anachronistic, or rather ana
chronistic. While the album is based in the
fairy-tale times of the original "Black Rider,"
Waits feels no obligation to remain consis
tent to one frame of reference.
Waits jumps from the medieval, lyrical
" The Briar and the Rose" to the avant-garde,
dissonant "Oily Night." However, he always
cycles back to reminders of the album's pre
sent-day significance, such as in the drug-al
lusions in "Just the Right Bullets": "Why be a
fool when you can chase away / our blind and
your gloom." In a comic, pop-culture mo
ment, the "Blazing Saddles" theme is inter
mittently interjected into the song.
But the true gem of the collection is the
unpretentious, one-minute-11-second
"That's the Way." The lyrics hint at its side
splitting ingenuity: "That's the way the nee
dle pricks / That's the way the glue sticks /
That's the way the potato mashes...." l.ike
much of the rest of "The Black Rider," this
song is just one of those "you've-got-to-hear
its."
