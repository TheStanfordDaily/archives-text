Carlito's Way
Reuniting for the first time since
"Scarface," Al Pacino and Brian De
Palma come well-equipped to suc
cessfully challenge Scorsese's
trademark territory of bullets and the
Bronx. Strong performances by Pa
cino as ex-con Carlo Brigante and
by Sean Penn as his lawyer provide
a chemistry that carries the movie
past the limits of predictability and
the mob genre. R
Farewell My Concubine
The directorial method of shooting
through objects such as fire and
smoke aptly reflects the confusion of
China's ever-changing political situ
ation over the film's 32 years Histo
ry is the dominant character, contin
uously interrupting and changing
the lives of the three main charac
ters and the Peking Opera of which
they are both a portion and a reflec
tion R
Fatal Instinct
Although it seems like it would be
just another parody of a tired film
genre, "Fatal Instinct" manages to
pull itself into the level of superior,
silly and sophomoric humor that is
always appreciated — given the
right state of mind Featuring a
strong cast and references to almost
every '80s blockbuster, it almost
makes you want to see "Jurassic
Fugitive " PG-13

A Home of Our Own
A plot focused on a single mother
and her six kids hauling out to Idaho
in 1962 in search of their own house
has the potential to be merely an ex
ercise in heavy schlock. Fortunately,
the inspiring performance of Kathy
Bates, the realistic looks and acting
of the children and the absence of
fairy-tale endings help the film avoid
this cinematic pitfall and, together,
create a real family picture. PG
Nightmare Before Christmas
Tim Burton's and the Walt Disney
Corporation's different management
styles lead to a remarkably uneven
film — the combination of Burton's
brilliant stop-action and Disney's
corporate caution. Despite potential
ly intriguing characters, the film is
cold, dry and unmoving — plotless
and heartless. PG
The Piano
The prize piece from Cannes sings
with the performances of Holly
Hunter, Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill
in a masterful tale of beauty and
beasts. Exploring the sexual under
tones to the myth that the Disney
film could only hint at, Jane Campi
on proves her worth as a writer and
director while coloring the rough
grays between good and evil. R
Remains of the Day
Possessed with ineluctable British

reserve, Anthony Hopkins plays a
manservant who suddenly finds his
code of loyalty no longer tenable in
1930s Britain. Hopkins gives an in
credible performance that is self-re
strained in word and deed, but nev
ertheless packed with painfully raw
emotions More riveting than
"Howard's End," "The Remains of
the Day" is a wrenching love story, a
war movie and above all a sympa
thetic portrait of a decent though
flawed human being seeking to bet
ter his life. PG
Robocop 3
Same plot, same director, worse
acting, worse script, worse star This
time around, Robocop is pro
grammed to work for an evil corpo
ration, short-circuits and begins to
help the victims. Numerous scenes
copied directly from other films and
a script too shallow for any real
theme leads to the hope that Robo
cop will short-circuit again and turn
on his producers R
Ruby in Paradise
The feature-film debut of Ashley
Judd as Ruby Lee Gissing — a
woman who escapes Tennessee to
avoid getting stuck in the same old
rut. Although the action is slow, the
real evolution comes in Ruby's
stream of consciousness as materi
alized through her journal writings
and through Judd's strong perfor-

mance. However, the film loses
some of its charm by veering away
from psychological drama and fo
cusing on the heroine's financial
troubles — the least interesting and
original aspect of the plot. R
Shortcuts
Unfortunately, genius does not al
ways produce quality work, and
Robert Altman's latest three-hour
epic is proof of that principle. A bit
tersweet ode to life in decaying Los
Angeles based on Raymond Carv
er's writings, Altman's series of vi
gnettes sporting 22 characters ne
glects its main character — the city
of Los Angeles. What remains is a
cutaway diagram of Altman's direc
torial prowess and a bunch of sto
ries more entertainingly busy then
poignantly literary. R
Three Musketeers
Retaining only the basic premise
from the literary version of "The
Three Musketeers," Disney's formu
la of cute actors and a Bryan Adams
theme song simply doesn't work. A
lack of talent and a horrible screen
play consisting of one-liners punctu
ated by sex and violence make us
wish the producers had bothered to
read the book — or that the deli
ciously devious Tim Curry, portray
ing Richelieu, would kill the Muske
teers and thereby end our misery
