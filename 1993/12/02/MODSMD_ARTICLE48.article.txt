# The 						last word on...
## parades 
### 
I love a good parade as much
as the next person. Clowns,
marching band, floats, antique
cars and the whole grand affair. I
love the jockeying for space that
goes on as short people like my
self try to find a way to see over
the six-foot-tall heads standing
right on the curb.
But somehow, something just

gets lost when the magic of
the parade is transformed
to the TV screen. It was

one thing when they started
broadcasting the Macy's Thanks
giving Day parade. And the Rose
Bowl Parade— that's just an ex
tension of football mania.
Then there's the Hollywood
Parade which was broadcast last
Sunday — with grand marshals
Bob and Dolores Hope. This is

not a real parade; there is no
community spirit. Is Hollywood
even a community?
When I said I loved clowns, 1
meant the ones in disguise — not
the ones desperately seeking to
entertain themselves (and maybe
get a job) by sprawling their face
across a million TV sets.
