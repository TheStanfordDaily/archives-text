# Cowell starts localized drug-abuse prevention
## New program will give student groups funds 
### Jos√© Jesus Gutierrez 
Stanford has formed a new community
partnership at Cowell Student Health Cen
ter that promotes substance-abuse preven
tion through the work of individual student
groups and ethnic communities.
The program replicates a nationwide
model of substance-abuse prevention creat
ed by the U.S. Department of Education that
"gives the power to the people," according to
Elise Lenox, director of alcohol and other
drug abuse prevention programs at Cowell.
Under the program, 10 campus organiza
tions will be given funds to employ alcohol
and drug prevention programs tailored to
the needs of their members and those they
deal with most. The money will come from a
federal grant set aside specifically for this
purpose, but the amount is still undeter
mined.
"Alcohol and other drugs have a unique
impact on different communities," Fleisher
said. "This program is a real commitment to

addressing the diversity on campus. We are
tremendously excited about this new ap
proach to health promotion. It gives stu
dents and their communities a unique voice
in making their Stanford experience a
healthy one."
Lenox noted that the redundant, "tradi
tional war on drugs" is becoming ineffective,
and stressed the need for fresh, innovative
methods to encourage the safety of students.
Furthermore, Lenox said the "lily-white
version" of social life on campus neglects
views of different communities.
"We need to step back and let the com
munities work out solutions on their own,"
she said.
And various universities across the na
tion have been funded by the Department of
Education to do just that.
"This is a whole new setup," stated Paula
Fleisher, project coordinator and doctoral
candidate in the School of Education.
