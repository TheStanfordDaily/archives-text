# Cowell starts localized drug-abuse prevention
## New program will give student groups funds 
### José Jesus Gutierrez 
Stanford has formed a new community
partnership at Cowell Student Health Cen
ter that promotes substance-abuse preven
tion through the work of individual student
groups and ethnic communities.
The program replicates a nationwide
model of substance-abuse prevention creat
ed by the U.S. Department of Education that
"gives the power to the people," according to
Elise Lenox, director of alcohol and other
drug abuse prevention programs at Cowell.
Under the program, 10 campus organiza
tions will be given funds to employ alcohol
and drug prevention programs tailored to
the needs of their members and those they
deal with most. The money will come from a
federal grant set aside specifically for this
purpose, but the amount is still undeter
mined.
"Alcohol and other drugs have a unique
impact on different communities," Fleisher
said. "This program is a real commitment to

addressing the diversity on campus. We are
tremendously excited about this new ap
proach to health promotion. It gives stu
dents and their communities a unique voice
in making their Stanford experience a
healthy one."
Lenox noted that the redundant, "tradi
tional war on drugs" is becoming ineffective,
and stressed the need for fresh, innovative
methods to encourage the safety of students.
Furthermore, Lenox said the "lily-white
version" of social life on campus neglects
views of different communities.
"We need to step back and let the com
munities work out solutions on their own,"
she said.
And various universities across the na
tion have been funded by the Department of
Education to do just that.
"This is a whole new setup," stated Paula
Fleisher, project coordinator and doctoral
candidate in the School of Education.
"Nothing like this has been done
[at the university level) — it's
unique."
The Stanford Community Part
nership has already designated 10
campus groups with which 10 stu
dent interns will work. The stu
dent groups are the Asian Ameri
can Activities Center; the Athletics
Department; Bechtel Internation
al Center; the Black Community
Services Center; the Disability
Resource Center; El Centro Chi
cano; the Lesbian, Gay and Bisex
ual Community Center; the
Native American Program Office;
sororities and fraternities and the
Women's Center.
Fleisher said that the partner
ship "will assist by providing both
funding and resources whereby
these communities can design an
(alcohol and other drug abuse)

prevention program that works for
them."
In addition to community
involvement, Fleisher stressed the
intricate role student interns will
play in the project. Working with
research guides, the students will
study the impact of alcohol and
other drugs on their community to
develop an appropriate prevention
program.
In doing this, both Fleisher and
Lenox said they hope the students
take advantage of the abundant
resources available on and off cam
pus, from professors to experts in
the Bay Area.
They also said the partnership
allows for creativity, and urged the
communities to expand from the
"plain old workshop model" into
theatrical performances, skits,
videos and other methods.
Cowell's present alcohol and
other drug abuse education con
sists of two parts, according to
Fleisher: core informational work
shops and grant-funded projects.

The new project is being started
because funding for an existing
program is running out.
Cowell's current Hospitality
Project — which is assisted by the
Party Pro's and funded by the
Office of Traffic Safety to promote
"safe partying" and discourage
drunk driving — has exhausted all
of its funds. Although this some
what hinders the project's produc
tivity, Fleisher added that even
though grant money has been
depleted, various students will
sustain the project's aims.
A study conducted by Party
Pro's, "A Snap Shot of the Parties
at Stanford 1991-92," of 22 stu
dent organizations, ranging from
housed fraternities to freshman
dorms, illustrates the importance
of such projects. Statistics show
that 88 percent of parties fall quar
ter, and 93 percent of those in the
spring had alcohol available. And
the 64 percent of students who
drank in the fall increased to 72
percent in the spring.
