						personal quest for AIDS awareness
## Education prof studies cultural biases Latino gay men face in fighting illness

When Education Prof. Rafael
Diaz felt that not enough work was
being done on AIDS research and
education at Stanford, he decided
to go home to work against the dis
ease.
Just over a year ago, Diaz took a
leave of absence to research why
AIDS has spread so quickly in the
Latino gay community in San
Francisco.
As a Latino gay man and an ed
ucator, Diaz said that the issue has
had a personal impact. "Living in
San Francisco, the epicenter of the
AIDS epidemic, I am surrounded
by the disease," he said.
About a year and a half ago,
Diaz received a fellowship from
the National Institute of Mental
Health to work at UC-San Fran
cisco's Center for AIDS Preven
tion Studies. He recently complet
ed a major project concerning the
cultural biases that Latino gay
men face that keep them from pre
venting AIDS.
"I believe that people have the

knowledge and intent to prevent
the spread of AIDS, but they find
that difficult to enact, to take pre
cautions," said Diaz, a member of
the planning board of Proyecto
Contra CIDA y Por Vida (Project
Against AIDS and For Life). "My
research involves the barriers they
encounter."
For his study, Diaz interviewed
60 Latino gay men, individually
and in groups, about their experi
ences with the illness.
"I asked about their sources of
social support — like family,
friends, community — and about
problems they have had with inte
grating (themselves) in the com
munity," he said. Diaz also ques
tioned his subjects about their sex
ual practices.
"The fact that this research is
so personal is challenging for me,"
Diaz said. "Since I'm a Latino gay
man, it's close to my heart, and it's
been hard to stay objective — how
do you integrate personal stories
into scientific data?"
