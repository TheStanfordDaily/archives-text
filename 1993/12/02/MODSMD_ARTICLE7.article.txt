# Activist argues for ecological renewal

### Jim Ho Staff writer 
Environmental activist David
Brower challenged conventional
economic wisdom and pressed for
"ecological restoration" before a
capacity crowd last night in Kres
ge Auditorium.
Brower reflected on a long and
distinguished career in the envi
ronmental movement. He is wide
ly recognized for being the first
executive director of the Sierra
Club and founder of various envi
ronmental coalitions, including
Friends of the Earth, the League
of Conservation Voters and the
Earth Island Institute.
Throughout his speech, spon
sored by Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford and
Synergy House, Brower ques
tioned the goals of economic
growth and free trade and argued
environmental concerns have
been largely ignored in national
policy debates.
"All of our leaders and admin
istrations think that we need to
get the economy going again to
survive," Brower said. "But no

one has ever done a cost-benefit
analysis on economic growth."
Brower spoke on a growing
school of thought within the envi
ronmental movement that argues
for new economic policies that
take into consideration costs of
the earth and the global limita
tion of resources.
"How much growth do we ac
tually need? That is just not
something that's ever even con
sidered," he said.
Population-control policy
needs to be at the center of eco
nomic analysis, he said noting
that he may be offending religious
leaders.
"Someone should really take
the Pope to lunch and explain
things to him," Brower joked "I'd
want to ask him, just how many
people can the earth support?"
He argued for a focus on
restoration in order to repair the
damage to the environment he
has witnessed over his lifetime.
"Sadly, all we've done is slowed
the rate at which things are get
ting worse," Brower said. "What

we need is an era of restoration, a
Green century, if you will. We
need to renew, restore, regenerate
— just about anything with a 're-'
in it is probably a good thing."
Brower also attacked the
recent passage of the North
American Free Trade Agreement
and ongoing discussions on the
General Agreement on Trade and
Tariffs, referring to these as "an
end run around all the environ
mental gains of the past 50
years." He also argued that the
media, which he claimed is
beholden to corporate interests
and dependent on advertising
revenue, has been forced to use
the term "free trade" instead of
"colonization."
"This is just colonization all

over again," Brower said.
Brower is often referred to by
his colleagues and followers as the
grandfather of the environmental
movement, something he jokingly
took issue with last night.
"This movement is much
older than that . . . John Muir
was 75 when I was two," he said.
"Maybe I should be called the
grandson of the environmental
movement."
Brower ended his discussion
by urging students to get involved
by dedicating themselves to the
environmental movement. He
then asked individuals to give
statements — rather than pose
questions — on the current sta
tus of the environment and the
environmental movement.
Before the speech, interested
students signed a petition outside
Kresge to Sen. Dianne Feinstein
supporting the Endangered
Species Act.
