# Faculty Senate urges University to act on female faculty report
## Committee's recommendations endorsed 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
In an exhaustive and compelling session
yesterday, the Faculty Senate grappled
with findings that Stanford is languishing
behind its competitors in attracting and
supporting women faculty.
Senate members generally endorsed the
provostial committee's recommendations,
which call for a University-wide effort to
increase female representation and achieve
gender-salary parity.
The senate passed a follow-up resolu
tion which "urges the administration to
treat this report with the utmost serious
ness" and to act upon its recommenda
tions.
The resolution also requested Provost
Condoleezza Rice to report twice a year for
the next five years on the University's
progress on female faculty issues. Howev
er, the senate also passed an amendment
introduced by Chemistry Prof. Richard

Zare to limit such reports to one per year
In discussing her response to the report,
Rice announced that, rather than publish
ing targets for departments' recruitment of
women — as the report recommends — she
would "work with the deans to establish a
reasonable set of objectives" for the hiring
of women and minority faculty and to in
corporate those aims into "the budget and
planning process."
Nevertheless, supporters of the study
were satisfied with the character and re
sults of the senate's discussion.
"I'm pleased," said Education Prof.
Myra Strober, who chaired the Provost's
Committee on the Recruitment and Reten
tion of Women Faculty, which authored
the report. "There seems to be a lot of sym
pathy to these issues."
"It was an excellent discussion — [the
senate members] made very good sugges
tions," Rice said.

Several women faculty members attend yesterday's Faculty Senate meeting to urge the implementation of measures to in
crease the recruitment and retention of women faculty.
Linguistics Prof. Elizabeth
Traugott said that "it is very
unusual to have senate members
as actively engaged."
"I didn't expect that level," she
said.
Debate on unedited version
The presentation of the 82-
page report to the senate came
two weeks after an unedited ver
sion was leaked to the press by
Hoover Fellow John Bunzel, who
was accidentally given the draft
by a temporary worker in the
provost's office.
In an op-ed piece in the San
Francisco Chronicle, Bunzel criti
cized Rice and the committee for
omitting personal testimony from
individual women professors in
public copies of the report. Mem
bers of the University Cabinet
reportedly felt the personal
accounts were too easily identifi
able.
The leak and subsequent con
troversy drew considerable atten
tion to the report, and more than
20 female non-senate members
sat in on the discussion yesterday.
Time constraints precluded any
from addressing the senate,
although prior to the meeting
some had been given permission
to speak.
Strober herself, in summariz
ing her committee's findings, said
that "although I was one of the
committee members in favor of
leaving the report in its entire
form, I have since come to a dif
ferent view." She cited a call from

a faculty member quoted in the
report who had been accosted by a
superior who had recognized him
self in Bunzel's article and was
"angry that she had complained
about him."
"In the interests of protecting
individuals, the provost's decision
. . . was correct," she said. The
issue was largely ignored for the
remainder of the debate.
Presenting the report
Instead, the senate focused on
the report's particular discover
ies, which show that among its
chief competitors, Stanford ranks
above only MIT and Caltech in
percentage of women faculty
members, at 14.2 percent of all
faculty. In addition, the report
reveals that 43 percent of Univer

sity departments have no tenured
women faculty.
Strober said the committee
also discovered that "in some
areas of the University, women
were over-represented in the
lower end of the salary scale. At
the same time in some fields,
women were underrepresented in
the top quartile." The report fur
ther questioned the University's
sympathy to the pressures of
combining an academic career
with a family life, in areas such as
child care, maternity leave and
employment opportunities for
spouses.
The report's recommendations
subsequently fall under four cate
gories: increasing the percentage
of women faculty, promoting
salary equity among the genders,
assisting faculty with managing
professional and domestic life,
and fostering a "culture of sup
port" to attract more junior facul
ty of both sexes and retain them
once they are hired.
"We must change the current
situation where women faculty
feel like oddities, and where
junior faculty receive little men
toring and virtually no emotional
support," Strober said.
Echoing the tone of Strober's
address, Rice said "clearly these
numbers are not good news." She
added that they are particularly
"disconcerting" because the avail
ability of potential women candi
dates is fairly large.
Even so, Rice rejected the com
mittee's proposal that she set
"targets and goals" for increasing
female hires. "While there may be
some merit to that approach,
there are also some drawbacks,"
she said. "I think it is well (that)

we avoid some of the more highly
publicized pitfalls, targets and
goals posed to other institutions
recently."
Instead, the provost disclosed
that recruitment of women would
be part of the academic-planning
process, and that she had already
included such instructions to
school deans in her most recent
budget letter, the most important
document she releases.
After the meeting, Strober said
Rice's plan may eventually prove
a strong incentive to hire —
"stronger than what we request
ed," she said.
"There are many ways to skin
that cat," Strober said. "I'd like to
give her a few years to try that
scheme."
Senators' concerns
Other senators delved into
varying ingredients of the report
throughout the session with
uncommon concern and persis
tence. Civil Engineering Prof. Jef
frey Koseff passionately adjured
the University administration to
improve its support of faculty
efforts to balance career and fam
ily, saying the two "are not incom
patible, and in many ways are
interconnected."
Anthropology Prof. Sylvia
Yanagisako pressed Rice for
answers on "how to make deans
accountable" for their hiring
records. The provost responded
by saying that by rejecting the
concept of published targets for
departments, she could not truly
act in any punitive sense against
deans or department chairs. She
maintained that improving Stan
ford's records on such matters
should be a University-wide con

cern.
In light of that response,
Yanagisako subsequently asked
Rice how her commitment dif
fered from those of previous
provosts. "I can't speak to the
policies of past presidents and
provosts," Rice said, adding that
accountability ultimately resides
with the deans themselves.
University President Gerhard
Casper backed the provost. "The
University is not the president
and the provost — the president
and the provost do not make (fac
ulty) appointments," he said.
"This responsibility (lies] at the
departmental level."
Subsequent concerns raised by
the senators ranged from the exi
gencies of the tenure process to
mechanisms for achieving salary
parity to adjudicating specific
departmental decisions.
Psychology Prof. Amos Tver
sky asked Strober why the com
mittee had not presented "com
parative data" in its exploration
of Stanford's perceived lack of a
culture of support, and called the
report's criticism of the Universi
ty in that area "not very construc
tive . . . Stanford seems to be
more supportive than other
schools."
But Strober brushed Tversky's
complaint aside, arguing that no
mechanism exists for quantifying
the matter.
One or two reports a year?
After approximately 90 min
utes of debate, Senate Chair Pat
Jones closed the discussion and
moved to the resolution pre
sented by Traugott, exhorting
the administration "not to get
sidetracked" and asking for two

progress reports per year from
Rice. But even that proposal
encountered relentless scruti
ny-
Casper first questioned the
reasons for calling on Rice two
times in one year, since the
appointment process lasts from
the fall until the spring quarter.
Later, Chemistry Prof. John
Brauman said he was "very con
cerned with this kind of propos
al," largely because it placed
undue burdens on the provost
and lacked specific language.
Though the bill's sponsors —
notably Political Science Prof.
Terry Karl and Industrial Engi
neering Prof. Elisabeth Pate-Cor
nell — stood by the resolution's
wording, Zare offered to amend
the bill to require the provost to
report just once, and despite
objections from a handful of sena
tors, his proposal was pushed
through.
The main bill was subsequent
ly passed unanimously, a result
that left Strober and Rice, among
others, in fine spirits.
"I think it may be better to do
it once a year," a relieved if ener
vated Strober, who voted against
the amendment, said later. "I
have a sense la second meeting)
would be repetitive."
The provost also said she was
"glad that it's once a year because
there will be a more natural
rhythm." And clearly the commit
ment the senate professed to tack
ling the report's misgivings
engendered her sense of opti
mism.
"I still think Stanford can be a
great place for a faculty member,"
she said. "But clearly we can do
better."
