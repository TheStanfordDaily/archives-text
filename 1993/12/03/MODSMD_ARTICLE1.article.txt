# Faculty Senate urges University to act on female faculty report
## Committee's recommendations endorsed 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
In an exhaustive and compelling session
yesterday, the Faculty Senate grappled
with findings that Stanford is languishing
behind its competitors in attracting and
supporting women faculty.
Senate members generally endorsed the
provostial committee's recommendations,
which call for a University-wide effort to
increase female representation and achieve
gender-salary parity.
The senate passed a follow-up resolu
tion which "urges the administration to
treat this report with the utmost serious
ness" and to act upon its recommenda
tions.
The resolution also requested Provost
Condoleezza Rice to report twice a year for
the next five years on the University's
progress on female faculty issues. Howev
er, the senate also passed an amendment
introduced by Chemistry Prof. Richard

Zare to limit such reports to one per year
In discussing her response to the report,
Rice announced that, rather than publish
ing targets for departments' recruitment of
women — as the report recommends — she
would "work with the deans to establish a
reasonable set of objectives" for the hiring
of women and minority faculty and to in
corporate those aims into "the budget and
planning process."
Nevertheless, supporters of the study
were satisfied with the character and re
sults of the senate's discussion.
"I'm pleased," said Education Prof.
Myra Strober, who chaired the Provost's
Committee on the Recruitment and Reten
tion of Women Faculty, which authored
the report. "There seems to be a lot of sym
pathy to these issues."
"It was an excellent discussion — [the
senate members] made very good sugges
tions," Rice said.
