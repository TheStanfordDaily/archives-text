Black homelands abolished
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP)
Negotiators agreed yesterday to abolish a cor
nerstone of the old apartheid system — South
Africa's nominally independent black home
lands, established in the 1960s to keep blacks
and whites apart.
In a decision reached after all-night negoti
ations, black and white leaders agreed that the
four homelands are to be dissolved before the
country's first multiracial elections in April.
No nation other than South Africa recog
nizes the homelands' sovereignty. Anti
apartheid groups long demanded their aboli
tion, saying the homeland leaders were pup
pets of the apartheid government who lived
lavishly off Pretoria's aid and used oppressive
means to silence political opponents.
The white government carved out 10 home
lands as part of a sweeping plan to keep blacks

and whites apart. Four eventually opted for
full independence. The other six chose to
remain under South African control and were
not affected by yesterday's vote.
Man goes on killing spree
OXNARI), Calif. (AP) — A man opened fire
with a shotgun in an unemployment office
yesterday, killing two people and injuring at
least eight. He killed a police officer as he fled
to a neighboring city, where he was shot to
death by police.
An Oxnard police officer was killed about
five miles from the unemployment office while
pursuing the gunman, authorities said.
The gunman fled the eight miles to Ventu
ra, where he was shot by police in front of the
state unemployment office there, said Ventura
police Lt. Don Arth.
The man's motive for the shootings was not

known, authorities said.
Colon cancer gene discovered
BOSTON (AP) — Scientists have tracked
down a flawed gene that causes about 10 per
cent of all colon cancer, one of the most com
mon inherited disorders, and say it should
quickly lead to the first broadly used genetic
screening test.
The vast majority of those who have the
flaw and are tested should be spared death,
one of the scientists says.
Doctors predict that within a few months,
or two years at most, there will be a simple
blood test to spot people with the defective
gene. Colon cancer is easily stopped if found
soon enough.
An estimated 152,000 Americans will be
diagnosed with colon and rectal cancer this
year, and 57,000 will die.
