### 
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) —
Security forces killed drug lord
Pablo Escobar in Medellin yester
day, ending an exhaustive and
sometimes bloody 16-month hunt
for one of the world's most wanted
men.
Police and soldiers shot Escobar
dead at a shopping mall in the
heart of the city that served as the
base for his cocaine empire, accord
ing to local radio reports. Colom
bia's prosecutor general, Gustavo
de Greiff, confirmed the death.
Escobar was killed by members
of a 3,000-man police and army
force that had hunted for him since
he escaped from prison in July
1992. The United States and
Colombia had offered $8.7 million
for his capture.
There were unconfirmed re
ports that another person was
slain in yesterday's operation by
security forces. No details were
available.
Andres Pastrana, a prominent
senator, expressed satisfaction
over the drug lord's death. "It's the
triumph of law over crime," he
said.
"Escobar ended up being a sym
bol of violence and narco-terror
ism," Pastrana said. "Now the
country can begin to live more
peacefully."
Escobar had been hunted not
only by the security force but by a
vigilante squad called People Per

secuted By Pablo Escobar
(PEPES), which had murdered
several of his associates and threat
ened his family.
Soldiers and police also killed
some of Escobar's top lieutenants
during the search.
Just three days ago, the drug
lord's wife and two children flew to
Germany seeking political asylum
after the government threatened
to stop protecting them. They were
turned away, had returned to
Bogota and were staying in a luxu
ry hotel under army protection.
The vigilante squad is believed
to be composed of members of the
rival Cali drug cartel, disenchanted
former Medellin cartel members
and police avenging the deaths of
officers slain by the cartel.
At one time, Escobar's drug
trafficking gang was the world's
biggest exporter of cocaine. But
after his escape from prison, his
empire was splintered by bloody
internal rivalries and attacks by
vigilantes and security forces.
The rival Cali cartel took over as
the world's main supplier of
cocaine.
The 44-year-old drug lord began
his criminal career as a car thief,
but rose to become one of the rich
est men in the world. He was
ranked 62nd in Forbes magazine's
1991 list of the world's richest peo
ple, with an estimated net worth of
more than $2.5 billion.
