# Clinton may boost U.S. forces in Korea
## Response to North Korean threat 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Pentagon is redrawing options for
bolstering U.S. forces in South
Korea, as President Clinton
weighs possible responses to
heightened tension with the
North. But administration officials
staunchly denied yesterday that
there was a crisis.
Defense Secretary Les Aspin
and Gen. John Shalikashvili, who
have been conducting a long-range
review of the U.S. military situa
tion in the region, went to the
White House for a national securi
ty meeting. Clinton did not attend.
White House spokeswoman Dee
Dee Myers called the matter of
North Korea's refusal to allow
international inspections of its
nuclear sites "a serious situation,"
and said Clinton was concerned.
"He wants North Korea to
know we take this very seriously
and we expect them to live up to
their obligations," Myers said.
But she emphasized the long
term nature of the Pentagon mili
tary review, saying "it's been an
incremental process."
The planning update is consid
ered "strictly preparatory" in
nature and would be put into
action only if the tensions over
North Korea's nuclear program

escalated, said Pentagon sources,
who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
The New York Times reported
yesterday that Gen. Gary Luck,
commander of the 37,000 U.S.
forces in South Korea, was prepar
ing a list of possible steps to
strengthen his troops.
They included stepping up the
alert status of U.S. forces; increas
ing the use of spy satellites; mov
ing an aircraft carrier closer to the
Korean Peninsula; deploying
Patriot air-defense missiles to
counter any North Korean Scud
missile threat and dispatching
more Air Force squadrons and
Army troops to South Korea.
A senior Pentagon official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity,
said such steps were part of "pru
dent planning" on Luck's part.
Meanwhile, a Pentagon spokes
man said no forces were on the
move.
"We are not sending any addi
tional equipment or people to aug
ment the 37,000 U.S. troops that
we already have over there," Navy
Capt. Mike Doubleday said at a
Pentagon briefing
But Doubleday said he could
not "rule anything out" for the
future.
