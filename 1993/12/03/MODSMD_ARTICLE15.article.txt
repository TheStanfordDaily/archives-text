IT CAN BE difficult to balance
thoughtful student activism and
a full academic schedule, especial
ly at this time of year.
But there is an urgent task at
hand, one that will involve plenty of
student participation if it is to be
done well: assessing student services
in the upcoming restructuring and
budget cutting in the Office of Stu
dent Affairs.
And students should take full
advantage of the opportunity to
speak and affect the process before
all is said and done.
By Jan. 15, Mary Edmonds, vice
provost and dean of Student Affairs,
will have to submit a list to the
provost of specific student-service
areas that can be cut as part of the
University's current $20 million
budget-cutting process. And this will
set the budget ax into motion, leav
ing little room for reconsideration
until it is too late.
By Feb. 15, Student Affairs will
find out what its budget will be — it

may lose up to 30 percent of its fund
ing over the next three years — and
will likely use its previous list of sug
gested area cuts as a starting point to
achieving its reductions.
Because Student Affairs has juris
diction over such a wide range of
areas affecting student life — Finan
cial Aids, Residential Education,
Housing and Dining Service and the
Haas Center for Public Service,
among others — students will
inevitably feel significant effects
from budget cuts and reorganization
of the office.
Students must get involved early
in the process, offering input about
these areas at meetings or through
written correspondence. The first
such forum for gathering this input
— Tuesday's ASSU Senate meeting
— drew a disappointing crowd of 25
students (or 50, if ASSU senators are
included).
And they must act quickly if their
concerns are to be considered in the
upcoming changes.
