# Laudable exchange

UNIVERSITY President
Gerhard Casper is getting
out more. And while he
admits he does not enjoy the PR.
role within his job, he should be
applauded for his recent exhibi
tion of camaraderie with students.
This week, he hosted his first
ever student press conference,
told bedtime stories to several
dorms and announced he would
teach a seminar for seniors in the
spring.
For someone who has previous
ly been criticized for his inaccessi
bility to students, these gestures
mark a significant step toward
more frequent and open
exchanges with students — which
will hopefully continue on other
occasions.
Last year, many students
expressed concern about not hav
ing the opportunity to get to know
the president. Although Casper's
schedule is still packed this year, it
seems he has penciled students
into his days more generously.

It must still be recognized,
however, that a bedtime story
does not equal a down-to-earth,
heart-to-heart talk on, for exam
ple, the way budget cuts will affect
student services and education.
And some may even say that
Casper is simply exchanging
pleasantries on a presidential
level.
Still, a cozy fireside storytelling
hour is an endearing gesture and
at least may signal more interac
tion with students in the future.
In addition, Casper promised
more stimulating discussion earli
er this year when he said he would
host a symposium on "culture and
cultures," and when he
announced this week his plans to
teach a class on constitutional law
this spring.
This adds up to what appears to
be a commendable and hopefully
continuing effort on Casper's part
to make himself accessible to stu
dents — an encouraging under
taking, all in all.
