## Forgetting political stigmas 
### 
I AM NOT now, nor have I ever been
a member of the Republican Party.
But just because I'm not a fan of the
G.O.P. doesn't mean I'm "pinko com
mie granola scum," either. I'm simply a
middle-of-the-road, apologetic yuppie
type like the rest of you.
There. I wanted to get that out of the
way in the beginning, so that you
wouldn't wonder about my political
bias. My political leanings shouldn't
matter, though. We have equal griping
rights in this country and we can learn
a lot from listening to each other
whine, even if we don't agree.
At this point, the conservatives out
there will be bellowing, "We don't whine!
The liberals are the whiners!" Fine, I'll
concede that conservatives don't whine
as much, but when they do they're com
plaining about the fact that liberals are
complaining. So we're all pathetic, OK?
It really is time to move on.
How about talking it out? Between
politically correct agendas and the new
conservative backlash, almost no one is
actually thinking anymore. Campus
politics are beginning to resemble
"American Gladiators." You root for
the well-groomed establishment (con
servatives) or for the underdog chal
lengers (liberals), but either way you do
nothing but yell like a beer-soused USC
fan.
It was cute at first: the knee-jerk
reactions, the name-calling, the fac

tionalization, the stigmatizing. I'm not
one to turn up my nose at a little whole
some mud-slinging. But believe me, the
charm wears off quickly.
First we had the rise of P.C. This
wasn't so bad in the beginning and it
was long overdue in many quarters.
Mandatory courtesy shouldn't be all
that threatening, but as Americans, I
guess we should fight for our right to
be rude.
Hence the conservative backlash. It
is now the chic thing on campus to be
reactionary and proud. It's really very
easy. If someone is bothering you, all
you have to do is get a superior sneer on
your face and say, "Ugh. You're just
being P.C." Then, you slap them with a
copy of the Review and ask them if
they're going to sue you. This tech
nique always works. After accusing
someone of being P.C., you don't ever
have to listen to them again, leaving
more time for hunting and baking apple
pies.
Liberals are just as guilty, of course.
I'd like to be able to say that we're
morally superior on this front, but
we're not. Label someone a bigot or
misogynist, whether earned or no, and
you have license not just to ignore what
they say but to persecute them as well.
A milder but very popular form of dis
missal is the famous, "You can't under
stand." This tidy little phrase has sev
eral advantages: it's easy to say (no big

words), it puts the blame on the other
person and you get to spit on them
when you enunciate the "t" in "can't."
What more could you ask for?
I think we should ask for more. This
is a university, after all, and even
though many of us stopped thinking in
classes years ago that doesn't mean
that our whole lives should be one big
rote response. 1 don't think we should
be able to dismiss our classmates and
faculty with pre-fabricated little accu
sations. Where's the challenge or the
sport in that? I want the opportunity to
trounce a friend in a debate. Victory is
so much sweeter than running away
from the fight, even if you are retreat
ing to what you see as the moral high
ground.
Rush Limbaugh is not your savior.
Maya Angelou is not that great a poet.
(I like her, but 1 shouldn't have to in
order to be considered a decent human
being.) We seem like little children: "I
bet my figurehead could beat up your
figurehead." It's time to find our own
voices and our own words, and to listen
to each other. It's not that hard and it's
what we're here for.

Kathleen would take Maya in three
rounds. She's giving five-to-one odds.
