## Band's appearance as 'Indians' offensive to member 
### 
AS A MEMBER of the Stanford
Band, I was shocked and hurt
when the alto saxophones
appeared for the Big Game dressed as
"Indians" â€” complete with feather
headdresses, bows, arrows, axes, and
facial war paint. Although I really had
been looking forward to playing in Big
Game, I left when I saw that someone
had painted his face totally red and the
altos started sounding "war whoops"
through their horns.
I think that many members of the
Band will pass off my objections as an
overdose of political correctness or
assert that the Band is an equal-oppor
tunity offender. However, I often feel
that the term "offend" is a term used to
overlook the fact that people am be gen
uinely hurt by such actions. I know that
hearing about the problems of Native
Americans on reservations and else-

where must sound very removed from
the Stanford community. As someone
who grew up on the Navajo reservation
in Arizona, I am not so emotionally
unaffected.
The fact that 30 percent of Native
Americans must battle with alcoholism
is just another statistic for many Stan
ford students. For me it meant seeing
people I honored and respected forced to
sell valuable items in order to buy alco
hol which allowed them to forget the
fact that their way of life was being
slowly destroyed. To know that the high
est suicide rates in the states can be
found on reservations may be disturbing
to you, but one of my boyfriends spent
week after week trying to keep himself
from giving into his urge to kill himself.
He felt he never fit in at Stanford. He
felt alienated because he was Native
American. He hated the way people

looked at him. He wished he was white.
Learning through an anthropology
class that Native Americans were and
are exploited can be easily forgotten
after a test but I don't remember my
grandfather without a emphezemic
cough caused by working in gold mines
to support his family when he was only
eight years old. He was one of the lucky
ones. Other Native Americans had to
work in uranium mines. It added insult
to injury that a people who have suf
fered so much through years of genoci
dal policy must also endure viewing oth
ers portray racist caricatures of them.
Not only do these images ignore the
diversity of cultures which make up the
Native American population but they
also make a mockery out of the system
atic dislocation, violence and killing
endured by Native Americans for over
500 years now.

I think that the Band picked on a
group that has the least access to the
resources to fight against the racist
images portrayed of them. While the
Band claims to "equally offend," I have
yet to see them dress up in black face.
Not only do they know that it is improp
er and racist, they know that neither the
African-American community nor the
Stanford community would stand for it.
The Band thought that no one would say
anything about their costumes and sadly
almost nobody did.
I think that the Native American
community has suffered enough. The
costumes were insensitive and hurtful. I
feel that the Band owes the Native
American community an apology. That
is the least that the Band owes them.
