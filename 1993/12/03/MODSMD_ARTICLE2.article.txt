## Faculty, students emphasize importance of service learning 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
As the Commission on Un
dergraduate Education exam
ines Stanford's academics,
some students and faculty say
they hope the role ofcomm un i -
ty service will not be over
looked.

Recent years have wit
nessed a growing interest in
the concept of "service learn
ing," the integration of com
munity service into academic
classes. Many faculty and stu
dents say that this type of
teaching — currently used in
some freshman English class
es, for example — can be a
valuable component of a Stan
ford education.
They also say, however,
that although service learning
should be encouraged, it
should not be forced on stu

dents.
"We've never taken a posi
tion that it should be re
quired," said Timothy Stan
ton, the director of the Haas
Center for Public Service. Tak
ing on such a task, Stanton
added, would strain the cen
ter's resources far beyond its
capabilities.
The Commission on Under
graduate Education has not
yet discussed service learning
in its meetings, but Assoc.
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences A 1 Camarillo, a commis
sion member, said that the
issue would be raised eventual
"l'm sure I'll bring it up at
some point. . .as we talk about
innovations in undergraduate
teaching," said Camarillo, a
history professor who is in
volved in a new initiative to
create or redesign classes to in
clude a service component.
"We're trying to get the word
out to faculty" that there are
resources to help create ser
vice-learning classes, he said.
At a panel discussion on ser
vice learning Wednesday

night, Camarillo called on students
to push their professors to take
advantage of the new program,
which will provide funds to help
develop new courses.
Though the initiative — which
is being funded by the School of
Humanities and Sciences — began
in October, Camarillo stressed that
the concepts behind it are not new
"It's something we've been trying
to push here for a number of
years," he said.
Camarillo also discussed a new
program under development that
may be launched next summer.
"We are committed to developing a
component of the summer (hon
ors) college for people dealing with
service learning or public service
honors theses," he said. The hon
ors college is a University program
to allow students who are working
on honors theses to get a head
start and also interact with one
another.

Service learning "is not some
thing that's going to go away —
the only prospect is that it's going
to grow," Camarillo added "It's an
I area | that got a lot of attention
under (former University Presi
dent] Donald Kennedy and
through the Haas Center."

Kennedy also
stressed the value
of service educa
tion, pointing to
the success of the
Stanford-in-
Washington pro
gram which
matches students
with public-ser
vice internships.

"lt's a much more intensive
way of engaging a subject. ... It
suddenly injects a heavy dose of
reality into the learning experi
ence," said Kennedy, who taught
in Washington last winter quarter.
"It would be a shame if [the
Commission on Undergraduate
Education 1 did not talk to faculty
involved with this," Kennedy
added. "The Haas Center and
some faculty have been working

quite hard to incorporate more ser
vice learning in the curriculum."
Stanton said that the Haas staff
has always encouraged students
"to get involved any way they can,"
pointing out that about 70 percent
of undergraduates participate in
community service while at Stan
ford.
He agreed that community ser
vice is most beneficial when it is
incorporated in the curriculum.
Stanton said that the Haas staff
has been trying to link study and
service for several years. "When
we can . .. incorporate 1 service) in
the curriculum, the yield is large,"
he said.
Jason Snyder, a member of the
Council of Presidents, also lauded
the value of service education.
"You can't get |a completel educa
tion by just sitting in a classroom,"
said Snyder, who has tutored stu
dents in East Palo Alto for three
years. "I've learned a lot from my
I service) experiences."
He added that students today
are demanding more "practical
knowledge" and are applying aca
demics toward greater social prob

lems.
Snyder said he supports the
trend at Stanford toward more
classes that "bring together service
and academics," but he didn't see
the need for required community
service.
"I hope the CUE will take a look
at this," he added. "It seems to me
that service learning experiences
will be even more important in the
future."
Courses that currently have
community service components
include offerings in the Writing
and Critical Thinking (the new
name for freshman English) and
Communication Departments. For
example, this year 17 Writing and
Critical Thinking courses out of
approximately 140 include com
munity service writing. According
to the department, more than
1,000 students have taken such
courses since the program was cre
ated in 1989.
Maijorie Ford, an English lec
turer who teaches one of the com
munity service courses, said that
incorporating community service
"in freshman English classes is a

good idea, but people should have
the right to choose ... it won't
work if you force a student to do
it."
Ford, who has co-developed a
writing text that includes commu
nity service projects, said that link
ing community service thematical
ly to the course is helpful in mak
ing the project successful.
Freshman Bess Kennedy, one of
Ford's students, said she enjoys
the class but is somewhat disap
pointed with the depth of the ser
vice aspect. "When I signed up, I
thought I was going to have a lot
more interaction with the 1 com
munity service] agency IbutJ that's
not the main focus of the class,"
she said.
She added that she wanted to
take more community-service ori
ented classes in the future.
Jeremy Cohen, an associate
professor in the Communication
Department, stressed that instruc
tors must be careful when incorpo
rating community service in cours
es.
"Service education is a very
valuable teaching tool," Cohen

said, but he added that it only
works well when directly linked to
the topic of the class. Pure commu
nity service — as opposed to ser
vice learning — should not be the
responsibility of the University, he
explained.
Cohen, resident fellow of Lan
tana House, which has a communi
ty service focus, added that stu
dents seem eager to participate in
service learning when offered the
option. Nearly all of the 220 stu
dents in his "Mass Communica
tion and Society" class last year
volunteered for the class's commu
nity service component, which
involved making Palo Alto stu
dents "better media consumers."
"I think service education
works to increase our effectiveness
in teaching substantive course
material," Cohen said, stressing
that it was not a replacement for
other aspects of the curriculum.
"You really get a different feel
ing for (the course's topic) out in
the field," he explained.

service learning or public service
honors theses," he said. The hon
ors college is a University program
to allow students who are working
on honors theses to get a head
start and also interact with one
another.

Service learning "is not some
thing that's going to go away —
the only prospect is that it's going
to grow," Camarillo added "It's an
I area | that got a lot of attention
under (former University Presi
dent] Donald Kennedy and
through the Haas Center."

Kennedy also
stressed the value
of service educa
tion, pointing to
the success of the
Stanford-in-
Washington pro
gram which
matches students
with public-ser
vice internships.

"lt's a much more intensive
way of engaging a subject. ... It
suddenly injects a heavy dose of
reality into the learning experi
ence," said Kennedy, who taught
in Washington last winter quarter.
"It would be a shame if [the
Commission on Undergraduate
Education 1 did not talk to faculty
involved with this," Kennedy
added. "The Haas Center and
some faculty have been working

quite hard to incorporate more ser
vice learning in the curriculum."
Stanton said that the Haas staff
has always encouraged students
"to get involved any way they can,"
pointing out that about 70 percent
of undergraduates participate in
community service while at Stan
ford.
He agreed that community ser
vice is most beneficial when it is
incorporated in the curriculum.
Stanton said that the Haas staff
has been trying to link study and
service for several years. "When
we can . .. incorporate 1 service) in
the curriculum, the yield is large,"
he said.
Jason Snyder, a member of the
Council of Presidents, also lauded
the value of service education.
"You can't get |a completel educa
tion by just sitting in a classroom,"
said Snyder, who has tutored stu
dents in East Palo Alto for three
years. "I've learned a lot from my
I service) experiences."
He added that students today
are demanding more "practical
knowledge" and are applying aca
demics toward greater social prob

lems.
Snyder said he supports the
trend at Stanford toward more
classes that "bring together service
and academics," but he didn't see
the need for required community
service.
"I hope the CUE will take a look
at this," he added. "It seems to me
that service learning experiences
will be even more important in the
future."
Courses that currently have
community service components
include offerings in the Writing
and Critical Thinking (the new
name for freshman English) and
Communication Departments. For
example, this year 17 Writing and
Critical Thinking courses out of
approximately 140 include com
munity service writing. According
to the department, more than
1,000 students have taken such
courses since the program was cre
ated in 1989.
Maijorie Ford, an English lec
turer who teaches one of the com
munity service courses, said that
incorporating community service
"in freshman English classes is a

good idea, but people should have
the right to choose ... it won't
work if you force a student to do
it."
Ford, who has co-developed a
writing text that includes commu
nity service projects, said that link
ing community service thematical
ly to the course is helpful in mak
ing the project successful.
Freshman Bess Kennedy, one of
Ford's students, said she enjoys
the class but is somewhat disap
pointed with the depth of the ser
vice aspect. "When I signed up, I
thought I was going to have a lot
more interaction with the 1 com
munity service] agency IbutJ that's
not the main focus of the class,"
she said.
She added that she wanted to
take more community-service ori
ented classes in the future.
Jeremy Cohen, an associate
professor in the Communication
Department, stressed that instruc
tors must be careful when incorpo
rating community service in cours
es.
"Service education is a very
valuable teaching tool," Cohen

said, but he added that it only
works well when directly linked to
the topic of the class. Pure commu
nity service — as opposed to ser
vice learning — should not be the
responsibility of the University, he
explained.
Cohen, resident fellow of Lan
tana House, which has a communi
ty service focus, added that stu
dents seem eager to participate in
service learning when offered the
option. Nearly all of the 220 stu
dents in his "Mass Communica
tion and Society" class last year
volunteered for the class's commu
nity service component, which
involved making Palo Alto stu
dents "better media consumers."
"I think service education
works to increase our effectiveness
in teaching substantive course
material," Cohen said, stressing
that it was not a replacement for
other aspects of the curriculum.
"You really get a different feel
ing for (the course's topic) out in
the field," he explained.

As the Commission on Un
dergraduate Education exam
ines Stanford's academics,
some students and faculty say
they hope the role ofcomm un i -
ty service will not be over
looked.

Recent years have wit
nessed a growing interest in
the concept of "service learn
ing," the integration of com
munity service into academic
classes. Many faculty and stu
dents say that this type of
teaching — currently used in
some freshman English class
es, for example — can be a
valuable component of a Stan
ford education.
They also say, however,
that although service learning
should be encouraged, it
should not be forced on stu

dents.
"We've never taken a posi
tion that it should be re
quired," said Timothy Stan
ton, the director of the Haas
Center for Public Service. Tak
ing on such a task, Stanton
added, would strain the cen
ter's resources far beyond its
capabilities.
The Commission on Under
graduate Education has not
yet discussed service learning
in its meetings, but Assoc.
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences A 1 Camarillo, a commis
sion member, said that the
issue would be raised eventual
"l'm sure I'll bring it up at
some point. . .as we talk about
innovations in undergraduate
teaching," said Camarillo, a
history professor who is in
volved in a new initiative to
create or redesign classes to in
clude a service component.
"We're trying to get the word
out to faculty" that there are
resources to help create ser
vice-learning classes, he said.
At a panel discussion on ser
vice learning Wednesday

night, Camarillo called on students
to push their professors to take
advantage of the new program,
which will provide funds to help
develop new courses.
Though the initiative — which
is being funded by the School of
Humanities and Sciences — began
in October, Camarillo stressed that
the concepts behind it are not new
"It's something we've been trying
to push here for a number of
years," he said.
Camarillo also discussed a new
program under development that
may be launched next summer.
"We are committed to developing a
component of the summer (hon
ors) college for people dealing with
service learning or public service
honors theses," he said. The hon
ors college is a University program
to allow students who are working
on honors theses to get a head
