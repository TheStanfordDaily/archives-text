# Learning by doing
## Faculty, students emphasize importance of service learning 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
As the Commission on Un
dergraduate Education exam
ines Stanford's academics,
some students and faculty say
they hope the role ofcomm un i -
ty service will not be over
looked.

Recent years have wit
nessed a growing interest in
the concept of "service learn
ing," the integration of com
munity service into academic
classes. Many faculty and stu
dents say that this type of
teaching — currently used in
some freshman English class
es, for example — can be a
valuable component of a Stan
ford education.
They also say, however,
that although service learning
should be encouraged, it
should not be forced on stu

dents.
"We've never taken a posi
tion that it should be re
quired," said Timothy Stan
ton, the director of the Haas
Center for Public Service. Tak
ing on such a task, Stanton
added, would strain the cen
ter's resources far beyond its
capabilities.
The Commission on Under
graduate Education has not
yet discussed service learning
in its meetings, but Assoc.
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences A 1 Camarillo, a commis
sion member, said that the
issue would be raised eventual
"l'm sure I'll bring it up at
some point. . .as we talk about
innovations in undergraduate
teaching," said Camarillo, a
history professor who is in
volved in a new initiative to
create or redesign classes to in
clude a service component.
"We're trying to get the word
out to faculty" that there are
resources to help create ser
vice-learning classes, he said.
