# Resignations of Gibson, Mitchell hurt Stanford
## 
### 
I am writing in response to two arti
cles written about the loss of Fran
Gibson and Caroline Mitchell from the
Sexual Assault Information Resource
Center. I have benefited from hearing
both of them speak â€” Gibson at last
year's Women's Leadership Confer
ence, and Mitchell during resident
assistant training this fall.
As the organizers of this year's
Women's Leadership Conference, I and
three other chairs were so impressed
by Gibson's informative presentation,
dynamic presence and commitment to
the issues of sexual discrimination and
assault on this campus at the confer
ence last year that she was the first
panelist we thought of re-engaging for
this spring's Conference. As Gibson is
now leaving Stanford, we face the loss

of one of the crucial presentations
directly relevant to the issue of
women's leadership, both on this cam
pus and beyond.
Nor is this loss confined to those
directly involved with Gibson and
Mitchell. To me, the issue is not the
awareness of these issues, as law stu
dent Isabel Traugott seems to imply in
Wednesday's article, but a question of
the University's commitment to these
issues.
Sexual harassment and assault are
issues women face on a daily basis on
this campus. I have many friends who
have experienced (and have myself
experienced) any combination of the
following: a teaching assistant's teas
ing going a little too far, a professor's
slightly inappropriate comments dur
ing office hours, sexual advances from
men we have considered our friends
and the resulting lack of confidence
and trust in our own judgment. The
fact that Stanford's attrition rate for

women students, particularly graduate
students, is so high (something I know
about only from Gibson's presentation)
attests to this fact. These statistics
don't show any signs of changing, and
are just as crucial to address in the era
of endless budget cuts as ever. I find it
difficult to believe that some funds
could not be made available to support
these positions if the underlying com
mitment to these issues were stronger.
I know a lot of people who are very
upset about these changes. I also real
ize that most of them will do very little
to vocalize their commitment to the
administration, having entered the
siege mentality of the last few weeks of
the quarter. I encourage us all to take
responsibility for ensuring that issues
relating to sexual harassment and
assault on this campus continue to be
a top priority for ourselves and for the
administration.
