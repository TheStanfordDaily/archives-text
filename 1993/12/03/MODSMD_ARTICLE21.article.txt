# World AIDS Day helps education, awareness
## 
### 
Thank you for the coverage of
World AIDS Day in the Dec. 1 Daily. I
would, however, like to clarify one
point.
The Hillel Foundation understands
that AIDS is not a gay disease. Howev
er, we recognize the impact that AIDS
has had upon the gay community. As
Jews we are bound by a prophetic tra
dition to pursue justice, welcome the
stranger, educate our community and
care for the sick. We participated in
the Wall of Hope to respond to those
who are affected by AIDS, as well as to
educate and increase awareness of the
epidemic.
