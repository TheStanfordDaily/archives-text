## Powder blue tuxedo dreams — my formal fantasies 
### 
Somewhere along the line I failed.
Didn't bat my freshly curled eyelash
es with that come-up-and-see-me
sometime look enough. Didn't drop letters
at the post office in a really short skirt and
bend down to pick them up enough. Didn't
show my bra straps enough.
For some reason I'd been hoping for it. I
wanted it. I lived it. It was so close I could
press my tongue against it. I began plotting
black velvet ensembles with plunging neck
lines. Started dusting off my three inch
heels and those nylons with the little
rhinestones on the back of the ankles. Sift
ed through putrid boutonniere catalogs for
my future knight in shining tuxedo shoes.
But I did not get asked to a fraternity
formal.
Every day for the last three weeks I have
tortured myself, fast-forwarding through
message after message from people trying
to reach the SAE who lived in my room last
year. Wondering if I could work out a date
for-message-taking swap with him. Every
day, walking through the Coffee House on
the way to the Post Office — dying to have

some luscious Greek god lock his sexy
brown eyes on my cleavage and recognize
what the fates had in store for us.
Running by the How in tiny little shorts
with my swinging ponytail, wishing that
someone, anyone would peer out his win
dow and realize he ached to share an
evening of bus rides and bad fashion with
me and only me.
Get the straight jacket.
1 admit it, I'm shallow. A tiny little child
in the midst of so many packed resumes. A
pre-pubescent among so many pre-profes
sionals. A fragile ego yearning to be free.
I want to be loved. I want to be popular.
I want to have actual photographic proof
to show my mom that I tasted the forbid
den fruit of a fraternity formal.
That's me, right next to all the beautiful
women.
In three years at Stanford I've made a
concerted effort to lose these repulsive
childish urges. To leave behind the mind set
of the scrawny seventh-grader hoping big,
bad Mr. Most Likely to Break the Statutory
Ilape would grab her hand, take her

out and press her close to his huge pecs
when the DJ played "Somebody." To stop
wishing for gyrating Chippendale dancers
with nice orthodontia and a fetish for medi
um-to-big noses, thin legs and good feet.
I tried to shake it. Tried so hard to be
non-judgmental. Tried with all my heart to
like people for their actions and personali
ties — not their quilted letters, their fami
ly's astronomical tobacco holdings or their
long, flowing dark hair
The road to hell is paved with good
intentions.
I stand before you a failure. I wanted to
get asked. I wanted to be someone's hood
ornament for the evening. I wanted people
to gossip about me and make jokes about
finding out if I was a real blonde. I wanted
the entire line-up of women with charming
pearl strands who actually belonged there
to scoff at me, to critique my table man
ners, to call my bluff.
Because I knew I could pull it off. I know
which forks and knives an* for what. I know
which bread plate is mine. I know that
women must always wear their hair down.

I know schmaltz from stunning. I have a lit
tle black dress, tasteful accessories and hold
my pinky finger out when I sip my Diet
Coke. They'd see. I'd see. I belonged at their
croquet-fest just as much as anyone.
Heather, it's your turn.
I never got asked to a Screw Your
Roommate dance. I never got asked to the
Flo Mo Boat Dance. I got asked to a formal
once before, but I had to work that night
and turn down my big chance. I will never
know if I could have gone lip gloss to lip
gloss with the young and the restless, the
well-bred and the J Crewed, the V-necked
and the Italian-shoed.
And that little nymph inside — the very
one who's been making me spread scan
dalous rumors about my flexibility on the
grapevine to make my chances better, the
one who's been making me put on extra
coats of mascara and black undergar
ments each day — she's relieved.
It's a woman's prerogative to change
her mind.
She's been screaming at me at the top
of her lungs hoping I could pull it off, too.

But she was never sure. For all she knew
I'd trip and fall when getting off the bus,
start chomping on ice at the dinner table,
slouch in my chair, dance like a big dork.
She had an inkling 1 could do it, but there
was no contract marked satisfaction guar
anteed or your self-pride back.
I am no debutante. I never learned how
to arrange flowers at finishing school. I
can walk in heels, but I wet my pants
when presented with menus in foreign
languages. I can hold my own, sure, but
when push comes to shove, I don't know
which wine goes best with which entrees.
Shame, shame.
I wanted the fairy tale. I wanted to
prove to the world that I could've been
Homecoming Queen. I could've been a
Kappa. I could've been the big man on
campus, had I only tried. Go out in a blaze
of glory, turning a few heads, raising a lit
tle ruckus, stealing a few dates.
I coulda been somebody.
