## Sellers: Stanford's stellar senior sailor Cardinal standout skipper shines on both campus and Goodwill Regatta 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
While other students were stuffing their faces
with turkey this past Thanksgiving, Scott Sellers
of the Stanford sailing team was dining on sushi.
Sellers was in Tokyo, Japan, helping the Ameri
cans pull out an impressive victory in thel993
USA-Japan Goodwill Regatta.
Along with other nationally-regarded sailors, all
20 of last season's All-Americans were invited as
the American contingent. Sellers, though not an
All-American last year, was selected as an alter
nate and received an all-expenses-paid trip to
Japan for a week. Then, when another sailor
injured his hand, Sellers stepped in and raced in
the entire regatta.
The American squad consisted of 24 two-mem
ber teams — a skipper and a crew. Sellers got the
opportunity to be a crewman rather than a skip
per, his role at Stanford. The fact that he was an
alternate did not lessen the experience for Sellers.
"The American team pretty much dominated,
but the Japanese were really good hosts," Sellers
said. "The hospitality was great. We had a good
time, and we saw some of Japan. It definitely lived
up to its name of Goodwill. Both teams got along
really well. It was really an incredible experience."
The boats used were of the 470 class (they have
a trapeze and spinnaker), a completely new experi
ence for Sellers and many of the Americans. The
470 class, while used in the Olympics, is not found
in collegiate regattas.
"The Japanese sail in those boats 14705| all the
time, so they sort of had an advantage," Sellers
said. "When it comes down to it, the best sailors
are going to win, and the Americans were just the
best sailors,"
Sellers' selection to the American team was one
high point in Sellers' 14 years of competitive sail
ing. He started racing competitively in Birming
ham, Mich., when he was about eight years old.
For Sellers, however, his relationship with sailing
was not love at first sight.
"My dad used to race, and he used to take me
sailing back when I was five or six years old," Sell
ers said. "I used to hate it; I'd kick and scream."
Eventually, he grew to enjoy sailing, especially
when he began to race competitively and win fre
quently. "I started sailing small boats, and I liked
the sailing part, but I really got excited about the
competition," Sellers said. "It's like anything.
When you start winning and you're doing well in

it, you tend to have a good time."
Sellers continued to sail throughout his child
hood and adolescence and was also an all-state
track star in high school. Still, sailing was his first
love; and like his sister, who sailed with Dart
mouth for four years, he wanted to sail at the col
legiate level. He credits the opportunity to sail
year-round as a major reason why he chose to
attend Stanford. In his freshman year, though, he
almost did not get that chance.
"I was the last person to make the team my
freshman year. I wasn't really recruited like a cou
ple of people in my freshman class," he said.
"(Being) from the Midwest, I didn't have the big
background like some of the people who were from
California or Florida, who had done junior regattas
all over the country. In Birmingham, it was too
cold to sail all the time except in the summer.
When I came here, others had been sailing all the

time all year round."
Three years later, the co-term industrial engi
neering student is the top skipper on the Cardi
nal's highly ranked team. Through hard work, he
has earned the honor of captain of the squad.
Leading by example and rigorous practice, he has
suppressed his own individual goals for the sake of
the team's.
"All the team goals are number one," Sellers
said. "(Individual) things like All-American will
come. If we're in the top five in the nationals,
Stanford's going to have a bunch of All-Americans
this year."
Sellers is quick to credit his crews for his suc
cess as a skipper. "I've had excellent relationships
with my crews. I had the same crew for my first
two years, Andi Guerrero. She was All-American
