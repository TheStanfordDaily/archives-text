# Playing with a hot hand
## Hoops meet Highlanders 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
For the first time in a while, the Stanford men's
basketball squad is on a roll.
Last weekend, the Cardinal (2-0, 0-0 in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference) opened its season on a positive
note by winning back-to-back games, a feat which it
accomplished only once during last year's 30-game
season.
On Friday, Stanford crushed Cal State North
ridge 89-58 in the first round of the Fry's Invita
tional at Maples Pavilion, and the team went on to
defeat San Jose State 69-58 in the championship
game on Saturday. What makes the victories espe
cially sweet is the fact that the Cardinal is showing
flashes of brilliance this early in the season.
"Defensively we played reasonably well both
nights," said Stanford coach Mike Montgomery.
"That allowed us to have a comfortable cushion for
the rest of the game."
Indeed, the Cardinal's tight man-to-man defense
stole the ball 19 times over the weekend and pres
sured its two opponents into making a total of 48
turnovers, enabling Stanford to enter halftime with
double-digit leads on both nights.
The Cardinal's solid performances in the Fry's
Invitational should give the squad plenty of
momentum when it faces UC-Riverside (3-0) Sun
day (1 p.m.) at Maples Pavilion. The Highlanders
are a top-notch Division II squad which cannot be
taken lightly.
"Riverside is one of the better Division II teams
in the country," Montgomery said. "They're a
threat to win a (Division II) national champi
onship."
Stanford's chances for success against the High
landers fare on how well it contains Riverside's 6-
foot-11 center Bob Fife. A senior transfer from the
University of Oregon, Fife has caused headaches for
his opponents by averaging 18.3 points and 7.3
rebounds per game.
"Fife adds height to the team," Montgomery
said. "He has really good offensive skills."
Stanford has an offensive weapon of its own in
sophomore guard Dion Cross. The 6-2 sharpshooter
racked up 43 points against Cal State Northridge
