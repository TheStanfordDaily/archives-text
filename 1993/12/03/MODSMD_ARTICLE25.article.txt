# Hoopsters to host No. 1 Volunteers
## 
### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
So much for a slow buildup.
In tonight's 1993-94 home
season opener, the ninth-ranked
Cardinal women's basketball
team (1-1) hits the Maples Pavil
ion hardwood running, as it chal
lenges No. 1 Tennessee (2-0)
before a national television audi
ence.
While it is far too early in the
campaign to call the contest a pos
sible Final Four preview, the
matchup of two powerhouses
offers a couple of milestones that
figure to provide a rich subplot for
the evening's proceedings. To wit:
the Cardinal puts a 34-game
home winning streak on the line
while attempting to give head
coach Tara VanDerveer her 350 th
career victory
Sporting an incredible 62-1
record over the last four seasons
in Maples' friendly confines, the
Cardinal has not dropped a home
contest since Washington stole a
last-second win in 1991. Ironical
ly, the Volunteers regained sole
possession of the nation's longest
home streak just last Sunday,
when Montana became its 35th
straight Thompson-Boling Arena
victim.
Knowing that Tennessee is

favored to end her squad's home
dominance, VanDerveer (349-105
overall, 197-54 in her ninth sea
son at Stanford) enjoys nothing
more than the prospect of reach
ing a personal coaching bench
mark against the Volunteers' Pat
Summitt, who won her 500 th
game in Tennessee's 80-45 sea
son-opening demolition of 1993
NCAA Tournament runner-up
Ohio State.
"There couldn't be a better
start to our home season," Van-
Derveer said.
Attempting to shake off a slow
start in its first two road games,
the Cardinal hopes to rally once
again around sophomore forward
Bobbie Kelsey, who has jumped
out of the blocks to average 20
points and 6.5 rebounds per
game. Junior Rachel Hemmer
(nine PPG, 6.5 RPG) will start at
the other forward spot, while
junior center Anita Kaplan (13
PPG, nine RPG) rounds out what
has been to this point a produc
tive Cardinal frontcourt.
Freshman Jamila Wideman
gets VanDerveer's nod at point
guard once again, while senior
Christy Hedgpeth hopes to over
come an early season 3-for-16
shooting slump in her return to
the starting lineup.
In fact, Stanford must better
its .380 field goal percentage if it
has any chance of derailing a Vol
unteers attack that is averaging
81 points per contest.
The Cardinal must also avoid
the foul trouble that has plagued
its post players, as the combina
tion of Tennessee's Vonda Ward,
a 6-foot-6 junior center, and
Nikki McCray, a 5-foot-11 junior
forward, poses a formidable
inside threat.
Yet VanDerveer feels that the
Cardinal is capable of perform
ing as a different team than the
one that pulled off an ugly 59-48
win at Utah on Monday. All it
has to do is execute in accor
dance with its tremendous
potential.
"We have been looking for
ward to Tennessee. They are a
team that challenges you to do the
right things," VanDerveer said.
If things go right tonight, both
Stanford and VanDerveer will
have something special to look
back on — hopefully after earn
ing another national champi
onship to go along with the one
they won during the 1991-92
campaign.
