# Stanford set to breach the Trojan wall
## Cardinal volleyball squad to face USC in second round of NCAA Tournament 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
A season of practice and prepa
ration behind it, the women's vol
leyball team has only one thing
left to do — go out there and play.
The Cardinal (21-6, 13-5 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) launches
into the NCAA tournament
tomorrow night, hosting a second
round match against No. 13 USC
(22-8, 11-7 in the Pac-10) at 7 p.m.
in Maples Pavilion.
In its meeting with USC just
two weeks ago, the Cardinal swept
the Trojans by a score of 15-12, 15-
9, 15-8 in Maples to secure its sec
ond-place spot in the Pac-10 as
well as its entry into the NCAA
tournament. USC went on to fin
ish fourth in the Pac-10, tied with
Arizona.
Stanford's victory also reven
ged a five-game loss in Los Angeles
earlier in the season, serving as an
indication of the squad's progress.
"I think it's been a successful
year because the players have
improved, and we've gotten better
from the beginning of the year to
the end," said coach Don Shaw.
"That has been our goal all along."
While team progress has been
one of Stanford's imyor aims, the
players have been focusing on
another, more concrete goal since
the first day of practice — to cap
ture the national title for the sec
ond straight year. Tomorrow
night's match will start the Cardi
nal out on a path which could in
two weeks end with a champi
onship match in Madison, Wis.
"Now it's just a question of
going out on any given night and
seeing how well we will play,"
Shaw said. "If we don't play well
enough, we're going to get beat
because we have the toughest road
of anybody."
Despite holding a ranking of
No. 6 or higher throughout the
season, Stanford was seeded
fourth in the Western Region
behind No. 1 UCLA, No. 4 Brig
ham Young and No. 10 Arizona
State. As the tournament was
expanded this year to 48 teams,
the Cardinal received a first-round
bye but will have to battle its way
through this extremely competi
tive bracket.
"It's obviously a tough draw,"
Shaw said. "The regional will real
ly be the toughest part If we can
make it to the Final Four, it will be
a lot like last year where we had
the toughest trip to get there, and
it really prepared us well."
While the Cardinal's route may

seem particularly treacherous, the
players recognize certain advan
tages which its spot in the West
ern region might offer.
"I think our bracket is stronger
than other regions, but these are
also very familiar teams," said
senior tri-captain Piper Hahn.
"USC and UCLA are teams that
we've played before, and I think
that both of them would be ner
vous to play us."
Although the Trojans might
experience some pre-game gitters
as they face the defending nation
al champions, their first-round
performance should give them a
b<x)st confidence of. As an unseed
ed team, USC played on Wednes
day night, easily downing Radford,
the Big South Conference champi
on by a score of 15-2, 15-6, 15-1.
"We are going to expect them to
play a lot better than the last
time," said senior tri-captain Heidi
Eick "We're mainly concentrat
ing on their middle attack since
their strongest hitters are their
middle hitters. They get most of
the team's kills so we're going to
try to stop them."
Junior middle blocker Meika
Wagner heads this fierce inside
attack, where she is joined by class
mate Yust. Wagner tops the
Trojans, as well as the league, with
a hitting percentage of .330 regis
tering 442 kills and 445 digs. Yust
follows closely with a .306 hitting
percentage, while senior outside
hitter Katie Haller leads the Pac
-10 with 445 digs and has smashed
down 442 kills on the season.
Although USC boasted a pow
erful middle attack in their last
tnp north, the Stanford defense
was clearly up to the challenge.
Sophomore outside hitter Cary
Wendell recorded a season-high 22
digs in the contest and also topped
the offense with 20 kills.
Sophomore Marnie Triefen
bach came through for 14 digs and
14 kills, while senior setter Hahn
played a key defensive role with 13
digs Both Wendell and Triefen
bach were named to the All-Pac
-10 team for their contributions to
the Cardinal outside attack
Although the Cardinal's main
focus will be on defeating the Tro
jans, knowing that it could face
archrival IJCIA in the next round
could provide Stanford with extra
incentive this weekend.
"We've been playing against
these teams all season long,"
Hahn said. "There's going to be a
lot of desire there to beat those
teams, especially UCLA."
While thoughts of retaliation

against the Bruins will be in the
back of Stanford's mind, this
weekend the team's main goal will
be to remain on the steady course
of progression it has followed
throughout the year.

"I really think we're playing
our best volleyball right now,"
Eick said. "We each have high
expectations of ourselves and of
the team — that's what is going to
take us far."
