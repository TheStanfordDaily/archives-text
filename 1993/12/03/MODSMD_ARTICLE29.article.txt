# Fencers hope to avoid sliming
## Banana Slugs of UC-Santa Cruz a difficult foe for Cardinal 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
The undefeated Stanford fenc
ing team faces its first test of the
year this Saturday when it heads
to UC-Santa Cruz for a dual match
against the Banana Slugs.
"This weekend will be a major
factor in determining who goes to
NCAAs in March," said Stanford
women's head coach Sherry
Posthumous. "The Santa Cruz
women's team is our strongest
competition on the West Coast."
Stanford won the Western Con
ference championships last year,
while the Banana Slugs finished
third, well within striking distance
of the the victorious Cardinal.
According to Stanford fencer
Errol Hunter, "With the loss of
their team leader to graduation,
we really don't know what to
expect from Santa Cruz this
year. But they will definitely be a
tougher opponent than Cal was."
Stanford administered a thor
ough trouncing of California two

weeks ago, tallying a final score of
34, compared to the Golden Bear's
nine points.
For this upcoming tournament,
the men's head coach, Zoran
Tulum, who has recently returned
from Europe where he was per
forming his duties as coach of the
men's National Foil Team, will be
on hand to personally coach a
depleted Cardinal men's team.
"Our (Stanford's) foil team is
the strongest in the country,
except they're not in the country
right now," said Tulum.
With Stanford's two top foil
fencers spending the year in
Europe (one studying and one
training), Zulum has placed his
other starting foil fencer, Hunter,
onto the epee squad.
Tulum explained that he is
building the saber and epee pro
grams for next year's team, which
will also feature a strong foil squad
with the return of Stanford's top
fencers from Europe.
Until next year, Tulum said,
Stanford's men's foil squad will

consist of three substitutes.
In effect conceding defeat in the
foil category, Tulum said that
Stanford fencers could still pull
out an overall match victory if
their other squads win by large
margins.
"We never acknowledge the
possibility of defeat before going
out there," Hunter said, adding,
"We never plan to lose. We have
one goal — to win."
On the women's side, the three
Stanford women who competed in
the men's foil category against the
Golden Bears two week ago will be
returning to the women's division
for this important upcoming
meet.
One of those fencers, Morgan
Hoch, said, "The experience was
interesting, but I'd rather fence
against women."
Even if the men's foil squad
does not win, it would not hurt the
other squads' chances of compet
ing in NCAAs, because individual
squads, not entire teams, qualify
for the year-end tournament.
