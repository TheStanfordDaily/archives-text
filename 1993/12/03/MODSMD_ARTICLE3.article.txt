# Colleges oppose new accrediting proposals
## 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
at Stanford and
other universities nationwide are
apprehensive that new Depart
ment of Education regulations
awaiting release may allow the
government to intervene in the in
ternal affairs of colleges and uni
versities.
The accreditation proposals —
intended to crack down on disrep
utable schools and student loan
abuses — may sanction govern
ment interference in everything
from admissions to curriculum
and tenure, some predict.
"We're extremely concerned.
We oppose any process to national
ize accreditation that would add
another layer of bureaucracy,"
said Geo (Trey Cox, vice provost for
institutional planning. "|The pro
posals! violate a long and extreme
ly successful tradition in schools."
The two most feared impacts of
the proposals are a marked in
crease in required paperwork and

the legitimization of government
control over private institutions.
The impending accreditation
proposals are intended to address
concerns over student loan abus
es. The issue was raised last year
in the course of reauthorizing the
Higher Education Act, with law
makers trying to stiffen the re
quirements schools must meet to
be eligible for federal aid. Original
ly slated for release earlier this
week, the proposals are being re
vised and postponed indefinitely,
though some anticipate their re
lease within a month
Educators said that the propos
als, as they now stand, would re
quire much more rigorous evalua
tions by accreditation agencies.
Consequently, schools would have
to spend much more money and
energy on data compilation.
"It would involve the govern
ment far beyond the level of the
law and turn (private) accrediting
agencies into a regulatory arm for
the government," said Peter
Smith of the Association of Amer
ican Universities.
The proposals also entail the
creation of State Post-secondary
Review Entities (SPRES), which
would be given authority beyond
that of regional accreditors and
state licensers to determine stan
dards for schools.
Though the original purpose of
the proposals was to prevent stu
dent loan abuses, the prospect of
more extensive change has creat
ed quite a flap within the educa
tion community.
"The state and federal entity
would undoubtedly take on a life
of its own over time," Cox said.
"There's no reason to replace the
whole system."
According to Smith, most uni
versities' concerns over the pro
posals are twofold. "It's partly the
hassle, and it's partly the notion
of the government inexorably
spreading control to these institu
tions," he said. "[These fearsl are

both quite real."
Smith said the Office of Man
agement and Budget has delayed
releasing the proposals in order to
investigate bureaucratic duplica
tion and complications in the
plans. Stanford educators and
university organizations hope to
have input into the revision pro
cess, though they are unsure how
receptive the Department of Edu
cation will be.
"What we hope is that this
prompts them to take a very thor
ough look at the proposals and
work with higher education on
this," said Dave Merkowitz, direc
tor of public affairs for the Amer
ican Council on Education.
"With these regulations, very
reputable institutions get caught
up in the process, something that
this was not meant to do,"
Merkowitz added.
Gail Raiman, the vice presi
dent of public affairs at the
National Association of Indepen
dent Colleges and Universities,
said it appears as if the govern
ment is trying to standardize
post-secondary institutions to
some extent.
"But where's the lowest com

mon denominator?" she asked.
"Would you want Stanford stan
dardized?
"There are many schools with
diversity in admissions, women's
schools, black schools. ... In
California there's a school for
single-parent women. How do
you judge these against Stan
ford, or University of Chicago or
Harvard?"
After national university
organizations got word of the
proposed regulations, David L.
Warren, the president of the
National Association of Indepen
dent Colleges and Universities,
sent a letter to college presidents
last month urging them to write
to the education department in
protest. Presidents of institu
tions such as Harvard, Duke and
Northeastern have all made
appeals.
Cox said Stanford is protesting
the proposals by endorsing the
common line of national higher
education associations.
Smith commented that the
current situation of the schools
opposing the proposals is "not
that unique. It's a common com
plaint at this stage of legislation."
