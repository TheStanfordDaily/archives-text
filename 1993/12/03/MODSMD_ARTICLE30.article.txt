Blomquist sentenced to six years
Daniel Blomquist, a former assistant manager in the con
troller's office, was spared a life sentence on Wednesday for beat
ing his son with a wooden spoon and forcing him to eat his own
vomit.
Swayed by the support of the Blomquist's fellow church mem
bers, Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge John F. Herlihy
gave Blomquist, 49, the much lighter sentence of six years and
four months in prison. His wife Ethel Mae Blomquist, 51, was
sentenced to a year in county jail and five years' probation.
The eight-day sentencing hearing was the end of a long trial
for the Blomquists that began in connection with the June 26,
1992 beating of their 12-year-old son, who is now in foster care
along with the Blomquists' other two children.
"The Blomquists are fortunate people who are lucky to have
the support of so many people in the community," Herlihy said.
