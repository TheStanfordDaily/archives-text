# The 						library overnight survival guide
## 
### Raj Raghavan Ed Maklouf 
It could've happened to anyone.
Ed was studying in Green Library, allowing
his tired eyes to drift from the page, reflecting
on his imminent academic doom, and slowly
but surely slipping into uneasy, sweaty
dreams.
Ed began dreaming of college as it was
shown in the glossy "Approaching Stanford"
booklets. Of relaxation, of good food — it all
seemed so real. He dreamed of a disembodied
voice announcing the closing of the library; of
people around him collecting their books; of a
sudden reduction in lighting.
A semi-conscious dialogue began within
Ed's frowsy mind.
Unconscious Ed: Hey dork, something's
wrong.
Conscious Ed: Big deal, something's always
wrong.
UE: Look, I don't do the logical analysis bit
— I'm just telling you that something
is wrong. You can work out the rest.
CE: Maybe if you stopped sending up such
weird dreams I'd be able to do my job a
little better.
UE: Dreams? I haven't sent dreams for a
while, the last ones I had a hand in
were those Approaching Stanford
ones.
CE: Oh Shit.
UE: Oh Shit. Start thinking!
CE: OK. The room I'm in is much bigger
than my bedroom, so I'm probably not
at home. I think I can hear myself
snoring. Hold on, I don't snore! And
I'm awake. Who the hell is that snoring?
{Ed opens his eyes to trace the snoring to his
sleeping friend, Raj.)
Raj: Uughgh, ooooohhh yehessss. . .
Ed: Wake up, you mad fool!
Raj: Wha? What? Where the hell am I?
Ed: We're in Green. It's after midnight.
We're locked in!
Raj: What are we going to do?
Ed: It looks grim, Raj, but we've gotta
fight for survival. We can't just keep
running all our lives! We've gotta
stand up and —
Raj: Yes! Never stop fighting 'til the fight is
done!
Ed: Right.
The nightmare had begun. We were alone.
Raj and Ed alone. We sat helpless, powerless,
staring into the blackness. Most men would
have been reduced to quivering puddles of Jell-
O in such a situation. But not only did we two
survive our unplanned sojourn in Green, we
came out better, and wiser — imbued with
knowledge which will help countless future
generations.
The first reaction of the average student
upon finding himself locked in the depths of a
Stanford library — the dark, majestic stacks
sapping one's already sleep deprived resolve —
is one of unrestrained panic.
Immediate anxieties include wondering
whether fire can be made by rubbing two books
together, and whether urine can be effectively
filtered by dripping it through many layers of

science periodicals.
A Shakespearean soliloquy stage often
follows: "From whence came I that 1 am
here 'mongst the stacks. Doth the fluffy

carpet stir me so that I am unable to think'.'
Hark! A sound. Should I steal away thither and

conceal myself thus, that whoever approacheth
will mark my presence not?"
One might experience feelings of angst,
guilt, anxiety, Oedipal loss and such. If you
experience any of this do not worry — it is
quite normal.
It is most important, however, to avoid
denial. Try repeating, "I am in Green. I can't
get out. No one can get in, but that's OK. I'm
good enough, strong enough, and doggone it,
I'm gonna make it out of here alive."
At this point, leaving the library is out of
the question. There are alarms on all the doors
that aren't already locked. The fences in the
corridor toward the South Stacks may very
well be electrified. Motion sensors, those
unattractive bulbous red growths affixed hith
er and thither on the walls, will detect any sud
den movement. The chairs are so mushy that
throwing them at the windows will simply
result in a quiet bounce.
Instead of all these futile attempts at
escape, all resources must be directed toward
making the best of your predicament.
If you have friends, they may be worried
about you. Do not worry that you have no
means of communication. Think of the cases
one hears about on the news — hostages, baby
Jessica — when asked, loved ones always say,
"Somehow, I just knew s/he was alive."
The trick here is to send out "I'm OK"
vibes. Take a moment or two to do this. We
know this works. When we got back to our
dorm, our dorm mates showed no signs of
undue stress or anxiety at our prolonged
absence. Indeed, it was as if we hadn't been
missed at all. (More experienced library sleep
ers might try sending out fun vibes, such as
"I'm getting laid" or "Tape '90210' for me.")
Having assuaged these concerns, boredom
may quickly set in. Of course, you can always
catch up on some research, but other interest
ing games include finding book call numbers
that are vaguely sexual. Take for example
8J69, which happens to be called Ethik der
Religionen (ein handbuch) by Carl Heinz
Ratschow.
The best opportunities for true enjoyment
lie in the fortuitous finding of another slum
berer. One can, for example, carefully slip rub
ber bands around the hapless victim's elbows
so as to cut off circulation. Wake the bebanded
one up some minutes later and proclaim, a la

Darth Vader, "Don't even try to move your
arms. You won't be able to." Experienced
"Greenies" might try laughing sadistically.
It is important to keep yourself occupied in
the relatively benign ways mentioned above.
Otherwise, extreme boredom may express
itself in antisocial acts such as tearing out the
last page of murder mysteries or exchanging
the contents of entire stacks. Some benighted
souls have been known to make Matisse-like
collages from 16th-century atlases.
Depending on what you have in your back
pack, ingenuity has no end of uses. A good
question to ask yourself is, "What would Mac-
Gyver do?" You may well find that, starting
with only a pen, a course reader and a stick of
Juicy Fruit, you leave the library in the morn
ing with a fully operational solar powered golf
cart (with stereo).
It is thus clear that certain things are vital
to a productive (or at least entertaining) spell
in the library. We therefore urge you to take
the precaution of keeping a Library Survival
Supply Kit® concealed somewhere convenient.
We recommend hollowing out an obscure book
that no one is likely to need. Books of choice
include Bophuthatswana: Statistics (1980, HA
4700.29866) or The Life of a Householder in
Stuart England (LJ 421.Q903).
Though most need only store a flashlight,
some food, and of course rubber bands, option
al items include "MacGyver" videos (if you're
in Meyer, you can use the VCR's), matches
(they turn down the heat at night), and
Twister in case you meet a special someone.
Note that the above "guide" was borne of
the tedious accidental experience of the
authors. One must recall that being trapped as
such within a University facility is not all fun
and games. Braving the Stanford Libraries at
night is not for the faint-hearted. People with
chronic lower back pain, expectant mothers,
and bibliophobes are advised to take extra pre
cautions.
Otherwise, keep clear of the

squeaky panting coming

from the South Stacks
and have your ID

ready.
