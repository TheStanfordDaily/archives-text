# The
						way we were... we think

A New York Times reporter recently
recounted an interview she had with
former Mayor Fd Koch. The mayor
had told her that he was on the boardwalk
at Coney Island when an elderly woman
took his hand and pleaded, "Mayor, make it
like it was."
I gather this familiar anecdote was one of
Fd's favorites, and it contains a lesson for all
Stanford alumni/ae (and those soon-to-be).
An invitation, a few weeks ago, prompted
me to think more about the ways things
were at Stanford. The Alumni Association
had organized a reunion weekend, attended
by over 6,000 nostalgic alums. My assign
ment was to talk to the Class of '48 about
the differences between them and the Class
of '93.
While they undoubtedly suffered
through the years of World War 11, the
Class of '48 had many things easier than
their '93 counterparts: It cost them $5 to
apply for admission to Stanford; over half of
those who applied were admitted; and those
who enrolled paid $429 a year tuition. Men
and women were considered separately in
the selection process because the number of
women admitted to Stanford was then lim
ited to one-third of the class.
The Class of '93 paid $45 to apply and
only 18 percent of the applicants gained
admission; those who enrolled paid close to
$13,000 in tuition. The limitations on the
number of women admitted to Stanford
were removed in 1972, and the Class of '93
was close to one-half female. In the '40s,
three-quarters of Stanford undergraduates
came from California — a very different
geographic distribution from the Class of
'93, in which only one-third were in-State.
The only evidence of ethnic diversity in
'48 came from The Quad, in which I could

count no more than 10 Asian faces. The
Class of '93 was 9 percent Afro-American, 8
percent Mexican-American, 1 percent
American Indian, and 18 percent Asian
American with another 4 percent from
international countries.

The Quad of '48 revealed more than eth
nic differences. Those were the days when
the Leland Stanford Junior Marching Band
wore (heaven forbid) uniforms; there was
an NROTC and ROTC along with the Scab
bard and Blade fraternity; Toyon and Knci
na (a.k.a. Encinasylum) were all-men's res
idences, Roble and Branner were all
women's residences, and the "Stanford Vil
lage" was a home for many veterans The
Stanford football team of 1948, The Indians
(a name of pride in '48 and of dismay in
'93), lost to Idaho, Michigan, Santa Clara,
UCLA, Washington, Oregon State, USC,
Oregon and California. Women's sports,
following Minor Sports, occupied a scant
four pages, the same number afforded
men's tennis and less than half the space
devoted to football.
On the academic front, only two women
undergraduates earned degrees in engineer
ing in 1948, and three women earned M.D.s.
Perhaps of more fundamental concern for
women (at least those of '93) was the six-

page section in the 1948 Quad entitled
"Stanford Royalty"; including a Betty
Grable (for those who remember her)-like
pose in carefully arranged hay, and a swim
suited coed, atop a rock, smiling dewy
lipped into the Pacific.
While it is not surprising that alumni of
45 years ago find Stanford today very dif
ferent, even more recent alumni lament
the changes. Although some alumni are
willing to concede that change is
inevitable and essential, they disapprove
nevertheless: A diverse student body (as
they see it) implies a reduction in admis
sion standards; a revised and diminished
(as they see it) curriculum responds to (as
they see it) pressures from radical groups;
ethnic theme houses (as they see it) were
established with a "politically correct"
motive. The common theme is that Stan
ford today is not the way it was, and the
way it is is not one they understand or
approve of.
I won't attempt to predict the Stanford
of 2030, but I can guarantee it will have
changed significantly from 1993, and I'm
optimistic the differences will be tor the bet
ter. The changes in Stanford from 1948 to
1993 inevitably reflect changes in American
society. The New York Times reporter con
cluded with Mr. Koch's coda to his Coney
Island story: 44 'It never was the way you
think it was.' And never will be." That's an
important, but difficult, lesson.

Jean Fetter is the former director of admis
sions and is currently special assistant to the
president of Stanford University. Incidental
ly, The Daily's managing editor (admitted by
James Montoya, transfer class of '92) is still
in shcx-k over seeing some of the numbnuts
Fetter & Co. chose oi<er him in 1991.
