# Moonlighting as a political satirist
## Poster artist alum plasters cities with works at night 
### Elissa Lee Staff writer 
Alumnus Robbie Conal is a street warrior, arid
his weapons are his posters.
Last night, Conal, a political satirist, spoke at
Kimball about his work illegally postering cities
with his art. Conal, whose art ranges from bill
boards ridiculing famous people "who abuse power"
to posters for non-profit groups, urged students to
use their own political power to stop abusive politics.
According to Conal, who has been putting up
posters across the nation three or four times a year
since the '80s, the Reagan administration's actions
outside of Congress — such as the Iran-Contra
affair — spurred him to leave abstract expression
behind and begin making satirical posters.
Using slides, Conal showed many of his posters
and works done by similar artists to the audience of
about 40.
Conal explained his posters throughout his two
hour program. In response to the "gag rule" passed
by the Supreme Court, which restricted doctors from
informing patients about abortions, Conal produced
a "Freedom from Choice" poster in cooperation with
the "Guerrilla Matrons," middle-aged women and
their teenage daughters angered by the law.
During the presentation, Conal spoke about the

intensity with which these women carried out the
project. According to Conal, 76 cities were covered
with 25,000 posters within three days.
Conal's work also includes "Men With No Lips"
and "Women With Teeth," which ridicule Joan
Rivers, Nancy Reagan and members of the Reagan
administration, along with anti-drug posters.
Conal produces the posters at a cost and places
them throughout major cities such as Los Angeles,
New York and Washington, D.C. Along with posters,
Conal printed a book last year of his work from 1986
to 1992 called Art Attack.
Conal covers the costs of his illegal postering
excursions — which occur during the middle of
night — through presentations, teaching positions
at various universities and donations he receives
while working with non-profit organizations.
Kimball Resident Assistant Elizabeth Riles
arranged Conal's visit after reading about the artist
in Stanford Magazine. After eight weeks of calling
and arrangements, Riles said, "Conal is more open
minded I expected. He isn't just Republican-bashing
— just satirizing the people who are abusing
power."
For Scott Gerber, a freshman, Conal wasn't as
humorous as he expected but had a strong message
that an individual "can't just be apathetic and sit
back and take it."
