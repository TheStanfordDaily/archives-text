# Stanford, FEMA settle on Green repairs
## 
### Skip Schwartz Senior staff writer 
After years of negotiating with the federal
government, Stanford has finally reached a
settlement that will allow the University to
begin repairing the earthquake damage to
Green Library.
University President Gerhard Casper an
nounced to the Faculty Senate yesterday that
this is "an extremely welcome development" in
the ongoing struggle between the University
and the Federal Emergency Management
Agency to repair damage from the 1989 Loma
Prieta Earthquake.
Without reaching an agreement with the
agency, Casper said the project to repair the li
brary would have been delayed indefinitely

Now, he added, "the Green Library issue is vir
tually resolved."
Casper announced to the Faculty Senate
earlier this year that total future costs to repair
damage would be around $158 million, includ
ing $35 million for Green.
Casper did not release the final settled cost
of repair since negotiations are still under way
to reach an agreement on funding for the other
buildings damaged by the earthquake, but he
did say that the federal agency will fund up to
75 percent of the costs.
In addition to Green, other buildings that
sustained serious damage are the Stanford
Museum, Geology and Language Corners in
the Quad and Terinan Annex.
The recent agreement does not cover these
areas, though, said Chief Financial Officer

Peter Van Etten, because the other structures
fall under different building codes. He said he
expects negotiations over these buildings to be
resolved within a few months.
Earlier in the year, Stanford and FEMA
agreed to let a neutral party help determine
how much federal aid would be given to the
University for the repairs, because negotia
tions have been at a stalemate for several
years.
In other senate business, SLAC Assoc. Di
rector Arthur Bienenstock, in the quarterly re
port of the Senate's Planning and Policy
Board, announced that the board will infor
mally advise the president and the provost on
financial and academic affairs.
In this role, Bienenstock said that the board
has decided to keep confidential
any issues brought to it by the
administration for discussion.
He said the board will not
supersede the official Advisory
Board, which is an elected body of
faculty that advises the president
and Board of Trustees on cases of
appointment and tenure.

After his report, Bienenstock
added a personal message, calling
on Stanford to use to its advan
tage "the overproduction of
Ph.D.'s in many fields."
Calling it "gambling for the
future," he said the University —
despite imminent budget cuts of
$20 million — should take advan
tage of the plethora of highly
qualified scholars now available
in many fields.
Bienenstock said these schol
ars represent Stanford's future

and would ensure that the Uni
versity is "a highly-qualified insti
tution" in 10 to 20 years.
After his address, Bienenstock
added that Stanford has to take
advantage of the financial con
straints of other universities and
laboratories to hire bright, new
and younger faculty.
The senate also unanimously
approved a five-year reauthoriza
tion of the Master's program in
Russian and East European Stud
ies, effective next September.
