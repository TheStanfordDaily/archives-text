# Stanford, FEMA settle on Green repairs

After years of negotiating with the federal
government, Stanford has finally reached a
settlement that will allow the University to
begin repairing the earthquake damage to
Green Library.
University President Gerhard Casper an
nounced to the Faculty Senate yesterday that
this is "an extremely welcome development" in
the ongoing struggle between the University
and the Federal Emergency Management
Agency to repair damage from the 1989 Loma
Prieta Earthquake.
Without reaching an agreement with the
agency, Casper said the project to repair the li

Now, he added, "the Green Library issue is vir
tually resolved."
Casper announced to the Faculty Senate
earlier this year that total future costs to repair
damage would be around $158 million, includ
ing $35 million for Green.
Casper did not release the final settled cost
of repair since negotiations are still under way
to reach an agreement on funding for the other
buildings damaged by the earthquake, but he
did say that the federal agency will fund up to
75 percent of the costs.
In addition to Green, other buildings that
sustained serious damage are the Stanford
Museum, Geology and Language Corners in
the Quad and Terinan Annex.
The recent agreement does not cover these
areas, though, said Chief Financial Officer

Peter Van Etten, because the other structures
fall under different building codes. He said he
expects negotiations over these buildings to be
resolved within a few months.
Earlier in the year, Stanford and FEMA
agreed to let a neutral party help determine
how much federal aid would be given to the
University for the repairs, because negotia
tions have been at a stalemate for several
years.
In other senate business, SLAC Assoc. Di
rector Arthur Bienenstock, in the quarterly re
port of the Senate's Planning and Policy
Board, announced that the board will infor
mally advise the president and the provost on
financial and academic affairs.
In this role, Bienenstock said that the board
