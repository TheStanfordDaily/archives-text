# Panel defends immigrant rights

Americans have a problem with racism, not
immigration, attorney Deborah Escobedo told a
forum on immigration last night. More than 60 stu
dents gathered in Kresge Auditorium to hear
Escobedo and three other panelists speak on "Immi
gration: Myths, Facts, and Fears."
Other panel members included Pulitzer Prize
winning journalist Frank del Olmo, Economics Prof.
Timothy Taylor and attorney Renee Maria Saucedo.
Panelists attacked myths about the economic and
social burdens immigrants create in American soci
ety. Gov. Pete Wilson was heavily criticized for his
treatment of the immigration issue, with Olmo
arguing that "desperate" politicians like Wilson
"latch onto an issue that will get the people riled
up."
The panel members agreed that undocumented
immigrants contribute more to society than they
demand.
"Very few people come here looking for welfare.
They come here looking for work," Olmo said.
Immigrants accept jobs that are unappealing to
most Americans, Saucedo said. "[Undocumented!
immigrants are taking those jobs which most Amer
icans don't take, because of severity and time con
straints."
Taylor explained that some state and local gov
ernments suffer the brunt of costs related to immi
gration because the taxes which undocumented
immigrants pay feed Washington. "Where overall
[costs] may balance out, they don't balance out in
the budget [of state and local government!," Taylor
said.
Taylor maintained that immigrants have not
worsened America's unemployment situation.
"Unemployment is more determined by whether or
not you're in a recession or in a boom, not by immi
gration," he said.
In addition, Taylor said that immigration creates
variety and opportunity: "[lt frees) people up to do
other things." He argued that many undocumented
immigrants obtain domestic positions, allowing
some women to pursue careers outside the home.
The panel members also argued that anti-immi
grant propaganda has worsened the plight of undoc
umented immigrants.
Fear of deportation prevents many undocument
ed immigrants from seeking economic and social
services, Saucedo said. "Sometimes they're paid $5
for an 18-hour day," she said. "Or sometimes
they're not paid at all because their contractors run
off."
Escobedo criticized those who want to deny
undocumented children an education. "What does it
mean when you start attacking children?" she said.
"What does it mean when you start referring to
immigrant children as a burden on our society?"

The panel members also suggested ways to stem
the flow of undocumented immigrants.
"What I would do is develop the economic policies
of the sending countries," Olmo said.
Taylor proposed a lottery system which removes
racist quotas, or a skills test to attract educated
immigrants.
Many students in attendance agreed with the
panel members.
"Immigration is what has made this country
what it is — both good and bad," said senior Victor
Madrigal. "There is no reason why we should have
borders to deny people the opportunity to live here,"
he said.
"The problem is in people's perceptions of immi
gration and using immigrants as a scapegoat to
other problems," said junior Luz Herrera.
Taylor said that immigration "is taking a lot of
the hit for the fact that Americans feel uncertain
about their place in the world. Immigrants are a sort
of face to put on that worry."
