"Black Holes and Baby Uni
verses" is Stephen Hawking's
second effort in a rather daunt
ing mission: to expose the gener
al public to the thrill and sensu
ality of theoretical physics —
hardly a subject that the average
reader takes pleasure in contem
plating.
Yet "A Brief History of Time,"
the 1988 tome by the Cambridge
cosmologist (who holds the same
faculty post that Isaac Newton
did) remained on the New YorL
Times' best seller list for 53
weeks. It may even have found
its way onto your coffee table.
Why should such an esoteric
subject attract enough readers to
warrant a second book?
One of the reasons has nothing
to do with science, but rather with
public fascination with Hawk
ing's physical condition. Stricken
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease),
Hawking has been confined to a
wheelchair, nearly paralyzed
from the neck down, since 1974.
A bout with pneumonia in
1985 led to a tracheotomy that

left him unable to speak. He now
communicates via a computer
and speech synthesizer.
A less patronizing explana
tion for Hawking's success,
however, is that his field — diffi
cult though it is — addresses
some of the central questions of
human existence. Why is the
universe the way it is? Where is
it going?
Hawking closed "A Brief His
tory of Time" by suggesting that
the discovery of a unified theory
of the laws of physics would per
mit us to "know the mind of
God." Surely, a scientific theory
that aspires to understand God
deserves popular attention.
Unfortunately, though, it
seems as if Hawking's science
has not progressed since "A Brief
History of Time." As a contribu
tion to the literature of theoreti
cal physics, "Black Holes and
Baby Universes" breaks no new
ground.
Instead, it is a collection of es
says and speeches written by
Hawking over the period be
tween 1976 and 1992, covering
many of the concepts presented
in "A Brief History of Time."
And, because the audiences
for these pieces have varied, the
essays repeat themselves, too.
For instance, the theories of gen
eral relativity and quantum me
chanics (as well as the need to

reconcile the two in a unified the
ory) are described in detail, sev
eral times over.
But the untrained reader will
most likely appreciate a second
(and, in some cases, third and
fourth) opportunity to grasp the
book's scientific intricacies.
Hawking's prose, further
more, is clear, deliberate and de
lightfully non-mathematical.
Readers can get by with spotty
recollections of high school alge
bra, as long as their minds are
not irretrievably locked in three
dimensions.
Take, for instance, Hawking's
distinction between real time
(which can have a beginning and
an end) and imaginary time
(which is continuous, like the
surface of a sphere). Calculators
and scratch paper are not only
unnecessary, they're obsolete.
While "Black Holes and Baby
Universes" contributes nothing
new from the standpoint of theo
retical physics, it does offer a re
vealing glimpse of Hawking's
personal life.
The book's introductory chap
ters repeat much of the biograph
ical information found in other
accounts of Hawking's life and
science, but it is refreshing to
read it in Hawking's words. The
final chapter is a transcript of a
cheery and candid BBC radio in
terview with the physicist.
