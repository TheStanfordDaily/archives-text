Looking for Class
By Bruce Feiler
Random House, $23, 330 pp.
Henry James was one. T.S. Eliot was,
too. And, deep down, most Americans are
Anglophiles at heart. Whether it be the
pedantic accent, the stiff upper lip that
Britons maintain even in the worst of cir
cumstances or the romance of glorious
castles bathed in the omnipresent Eng
lish fog and rain, the British Isles have
long captured the American imagination.
Bruce Feiler capitalizes on this obses
sion in his latest book, "Looking for
Class: Searching for Wisdom and Ro
mance at Oxford and Cambridge." In his
earlier effort, "Learning to Bow," Feiler
examined the cultural mores of Japan as
seen through the eyes of a gaijin, or for
eigner. Now, after one year as a graduate
student at Cambridge, Feiler turns his
microscope on Merrie England.
Or Gloomie England, as the case may
be. Feiler pulls no punches in describing
the soggy British weather, class tensions
and the all-encompassing state of ennui
among British students. It is the last sub
ject which provides the material for Feil

er's most extensive and insightful com
mentaries on the state of British culture.
The dichotomy between England's
regal past and its gray, unromantic pre
sent is unwittingly personified by the
students Feiler encounters during his
year abroad. For example, lan and
Simon, two classmates, are the perpetual
Romeos of Clare College, one of Cam
bridge's 30-plus institutions.
Lan, epitomizing Britain's love for
pomp and circumstance, is an incurable
romantic, who believes that love is the
most divine of human emotions, but es
chews the dirty and squalid mechanics of
sex. By contrast, the less-than-glam
orous reality of most Britishers' every
day lives is illustrated by Simon's endless
series of one-night affairs.
Feiler assesses this dichotomy in stat
ing, "it reminded me of my own under
graduate days: clever, sophomoric, and
tasteless jokes on one side compounded
by clever, radical, and trendy rage on the
other.
"One group of undergraduates so
craves sexual bliss that it develops a
childish obsession; the other so wants to
transcend the act that it descends into an
ideological temper tantrum." Clearly,
this categorization could also be applied
to Britain, which in this fin de siecle era

appears alternately hedonistic and sub
servient to its glorified past.
Of course, not every anecdote in
"Looking for Class" offers a profound
metaphor or revelation. It is not exactly
shocking that (gasp!) British students
drink and have sex just as frequently as
their American counterparts.
However, Feiler's account suggests
that, in England, drinking and connubial
affairs are more than merely hedonistic
joys. One senses that somehow the
weight and gravity of England's history
is a burden upon the shoulders of today's
youth — an unwelcome legacy replete
with ennobling deeds and acts of heroism
to which they can never aspire.
Underscoring this theme, Feiler re
peatedly refers to Cambridge's illustri
ous past, noting the scholars — from
Spenser to Milton to Wordsworth — who
matriculated along the banks of the Cam
and whose names are omnipresent in
students' conversations. Though he
never states as much, it is clear that Feil
er himself, for all his objectivity, feels op
pressed by the past which he and other
Cambridge students have inherited. In
stead of grand figures, prepared to leave
their mark upon world history, Feiler de
scribes himself and his classmates as
"bats .. . flocking to their caves,"

Despite Feiler's often intriguing in
sight into the British commonwealth,
"Looking for Class" has two grating
flaws. First, Feiler constantly complains
that he is treated as an "outsider," with
out acknowledging that his semi-journal
istic approach to British culture in
evitably makes him something of a pari
ah.
Furthermore, travelogues are per
haps the most difficult of all texts to
write. The author must, at all times, con
sider the importance of his or her subject
to both the present amusement and fu
ture necessity of his audience. Feiler, like
most writers, sometimes grows so enrap
tured with his own experiences that he
neglects his readers.
Luckily, there is far more kindling
than dead wood in "Looking for Class."
Many similar books have attempted to
distill the manifold images of a week, a
month or a year abroad into an easily ac
cessible message. But few readers pick up
a travelogue in search of an ambiguous
moral. Feiler generally allows the stu
dents and setting to speak for itself.
"Looking for Class" may not be a per
fect examination of life in Great Britain,
but it's much easier to swallow than
British food — even for Anglophile Amer
icans.

their American counterparts.
However, Feiler's account suggests
that, in England, drinking and connubial
affairs are more than merely hedonistic
joys. One senses that somehow the
weight and gravity of England's history
is a burden upon the shoulders of today's
youth — an unwelcome legacy replete
with ennobling deeds and acts of heroism
to which they can never aspire.
Underscoring this theme, Feiler re
peatedly refers to Cambridge's illustri
ous past, noting the scholars — from
Spenser to Milton to Wordsworth — who
matriculated along the banks of the Cam
and whose names are omnipresent in
students' conversations. Though he
never states as much, it is clear that Feil
er himself, for all his objectivity, feels op
pressed by the past which he and other
Cambridge students have inherited. In
stead of grand figures, prepared to leave
their mark upon world history, Feiler de
scribes himself and his classmates as
"bats .. . flocking to their caves,"

Despite Feiler's often intriguing in
sight into the British commonwealth,
"Looking for Class" has two grating
flaws. First, Feiler constantly complains
that he is treated as an "outsider," with
out acknowledging that his semi-journal
istic approach to British culture in
evitably makes him something of a pari
ah.
Furthermore, travelogues are per
haps the most difficult of all texts to
write. The author must, at all times, con
sider the importance of his or her subject
to both the present amusement and fu
ture necessity of his audience. Feiler, like
most writers, sometimes grows so enrap
tured with his own experiences that he
neglects his readers.
Luckily, there is far more kindling
than dead wood in "Looking for Class."
Many similar books have attempted to
distill the manifold images of a week, a
month or a year abroad into an easily ac
cessible message. But few readers pick up
a travelogue in search of an ambiguous
moral. Feiler generally allows the stu
dents and setting to speak for itself.
"Looking for Class" may not be a per
fect examination of life in Great Britain,
but it's much easier to swallow than
British food — even for Anglophile Amer
icans.
