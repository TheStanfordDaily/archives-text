It's a truth universally ac
knowledged that a literary clas
sic, in possession i>f a mass read
ership, must be in want of a se
quel.
Among the books that have
tried to cash in on the not-so-far
fetched notion that readers can't
get enough of Jane Austen are
John Coates' "The Watsons,"
Joan Aiken's "Mansfield Revis
ited" and "Jane Fairfax" and
two new sequels to Austen's
best-known and best-beloved
work, "Pride and Prejudice."
Released simultaneously (to
cash in on publicity about, as one
press release calls it, the "Jane
Wars"), the two novels —
Emma Tennant's "Pemberley"
and Julia Barrett's "Presump
tion: An Entertainment" —
both pick up at the end of the
original, chronicling the lives of
the Darcys, Bingleys and lien
nets shortly after the marriage
of Elizabeth Bennet and
Fitzwilliam Darcy.
That is where both make
their first mistake. Rather than
putting a new twist on the origi
nal — the way Jean Rhys'
"Wide Sargasso Sea" did with
"Jane Eyre" — the two sequels
simply add more and more of the
same to a novel that Jane Austen
was perfectly happy to end
where she did.
For unlike "Gone With the
Wind," whose climactic ending
cried out for a sequel, "Pride and

Prejudice" is an organic whole,
ending with all conflicts re
solved, Darcy's pride deflated
and Elizabeth's prejudice abat
ed. Austen's readers aren't
burning to know how Elizabeth
copes with married life (the plot
of "Pemberley") or who Darcy's
younger sister Georgiana mar
ries (the plot of "Presumption").
If the sequels had more sub
stance, perhaps readers would be
enticed to care about these new
plot developments. But both Bar
rett and Tennant try too hard to
emulate Austen's style, and their
respective novels suffer.
For example, the reader can
almost feel the authors strug
gling to capture the perfect 19th
century tone — choosing the ap
propriate look-it-up-in-the-dic
tionary word, changing all the
"she saids" to "said shes" and
mulling over just where another
"indeed" or "I dare say" could be
inserted in the dialogue.
The authors transform what
was light and entertaining in
Austen's hands into clumsy
prose that is difficult to follow
and often annoying to read —
fatal in what is supposed to be
gentle social satire.
Also, though we assume that
returning characters remain
their same selves in the sequels,
Barrett and Tennant keep the
main players so in character that
they become one-dimensional
and predictable.
Lady Catherine de Bourgh
becomes more and more super
cilious, Mrs. Bennet continues to
be an embarrassment to her
family, Jane Bingley takes on
marriage and motherhood with
her usual sweet, sacrificing na
ture and Mr. Darcy remains his
controlled, independent self.
The only new dimension that
the two sequels add to Austen's
portrayal of 19th-century upper-

class society is a clearer picture
of marriage in that era, particu
larly of marriage between two
people of unequal social rank.
Though the story lines in the
two books are different, both
show Elizabeth's difficulty ad
justing to her higher social sta
tus as Darcy's wife and as mis
tress of Pemberley, his family es
tate. Because of her family's low
rank, Elizabeth's happiness de
pends all too much on her hus-

The reader can almost feel the
authors struggling to capture
the perfect 19th-century tone —
choosing the appropriate look
it-up-in-the-dictionary word,
changing all the 'she saids' to
'said shes' and mulling over
just where another 'indeed' or
'I dare say' could be inserted
in the dialogue.

band's unpredictable moods.
The precariousness of her po
sition — both as a woman and
as a spouse of inferior rank — is
highlighted both in "Pember
ley," when Elizabeth can't con
front her husband about the
party he canceled without noti
fying her, and in "Presump
tion," when she again must rely
on Darcy to clear the Bennet
family name.
But even with a couple more
characters and conflicts thrown
in, neither novel is strong

enough to stand on its own.
In "Presumption," Barrett —
a pseudonym for the book's co
authors — shifts the focus from
Elizabeth to her sister-in-law,
Georgiana Darcy. But instead of
fleshing out a new character or a
new story line, Barrett makes
Georgiana an imitation of Eliza
beth: a smart and willful, but
sensible heroine.
Even in their weaknesses, the
two women are alike. As Eliza

beth does in the original, Geor
giana believes herself in love
with a slick, handsome young
soldier and misjudges the
strong-willed and proud man she
finally comes to love.
The novel has some nice mo
ments — such as when Geor
giana finally gives Lady de
Bourgh a piece of her mind —
but the recycled plot doesn't
quite satisfy. True, everyone
knew that Darcy and Elizabeth
would marry at the end of "Pride
and Prejudice," but the plot was

not the point of the novel.
But since Barrett gives only a
feeble imitation of Austen's
prose, she needs a well-conceived
plot in order to keep readers in
terested. Unfortunately, the plot
isn't there. In its place, Barrett
spins convoluted sentences such
as this:
"Imagine therefore, our
young lady's bafflement, upon
confronting her brother, with
case prepared and resolution
fixed, to find him, once he had re
covered from his astonishment,
welcoming the match with the
most unaffected of pleasure."
"Pemberley" is more accu
rately called a sequel, as Eliza
beth remains its central protago
nist. The novel follows her as she
deals with the formidable task of
running Pemberley while her
foolish mother and foolhardy
sister Lydia make their Christ
mas visit.
Tennant introduces Pember
ley's librarian, a nice, polite
young man whose careless com
ments lead Elizabeth to believe
that her husband is keeping se
crets from her about a former
lover and an illegitimate child.
The misunderstanding pro
gresses promisingly, highlight
ing Austen's themes of pride and
prejudice, this time within the
context of marriage. But Eliza
beth's realization that she has
again judged Darcy too quickly is
muted by the fact that the entire
conflict is completely resolved
within the last four pages of the
novel.
Both "Pemberley" and "Pre
sumption" are harmless contin
uations of Austen's novel, but
they are no more than that. Nei
ther dares to go beyond the con
fines of the themes Austen origi
nally set up, nor offers any new
insights into societal and human
weaknesses.

the perfect 19th-century tone —

band's unpredictable moods.
The precariousness of her po
sition — both as a woman and
as a spouse of inferior rank — is
highlighted both in "Pember
ley," when Elizabeth can't con
front her husband about the
party he canceled without noti
fying her, and in "Presump
tion," when she again must rely
on Darcy to clear the Bennet
family name.
But even with a couple more
characters and conflicts thrown
in, neither novel is strong

enough to stand on its own.
In "Presumption," Barrett —
a pseudonym for the book's co
authors — shifts the focus from
Elizabeth to her sister-in-law,
Georgiana Darcy. But instead of
fleshing out a new character or a
new story line, Barrett makes
Georgiana an imitation of Eliza
beth: a smart and willful, but
sensible heroine.
Even in their weaknesses, the
two women are alike. As Eliza

beth does in the original, Geor
giana believes herself in love
with a slick, handsome young
soldier and misjudges the
strong-willed and proud man she
finally comes to love.
The novel has some nice mo
ments — such as when Geor
giana finally gives Lady de
Bourgh a piece of her mind —
but the recycled plot doesn't
quite satisfy. True, everyone
knew that Darcy and Elizabeth
would marry at the end of "Pride
and Prejudice," but the plot was

not the point of the novel.
But since Barrett gives only a
feeble imitation of Austen's
prose, she needs a well-conceived
plot in order to keep readers in
terested. Unfortunately, the plot
isn't there. In its place, Barrett
spins convoluted sentences such
as this:
"Imagine therefore, our
young lady's bafflement, upon
confronting her brother, with
case prepared and resolution
fixed, to find him, once he had re
covered from his astonishment,
welcoming the match with the
most unaffected of pleasure."
"Pemberley" is more accu
rately called a sequel, as Eliza
beth remains its central protago
nist. The novel follows her as she
deals with the formidable task of
running Pemberley while her
foolish mother and foolhardy
sister Lydia make their Christ
mas visit.
Tennant introduces Pember
ley's librarian, a nice, polite
young man whose careless com
ments lead Elizabeth to believe
that her husband is keeping se
crets from her about a former
lover and an illegitimate child.
The misunderstanding pro
gresses promisingly, highlight
ing Austen's themes of pride and
prejudice, this time within the
context of marriage. But Eliza
beth's realization that she has
again judged Darcy too quickly is
muted by the fact that the entire
conflict is completely resolved
within the last four pages of the
novel.
Both "Pemberley" and "Pre
sumption" are harmless contin
uations of Austen's novel, but
they are no more than that. Nei
ther dares to go beyond the con
fines of the themes Austen origi
nally set up, nor offers any new
insights into societal and human
weaknesses.

An Entertainment
By Julia Barrett

It's a truth universally ac
knowledged that a literary clas
sic, in possession i>f a mass read
ership, must be in want of a se
quel.
Among the books that have
tried to cash in on the not-so-far
fetched notion that readers can't
get enough of Jane Austen are
John Coates' "The Watsons,"
Joan Aiken's "Mansfield Revis
ited" and "Jane Fairfax" and
two new sequels to Austen's
best-known and best-beloved
work, "Pride and Prejudice."
Released simultaneously (to
cash in on publicity about, as one
press release calls it, the "Jane
Wars"), the two novels —
Emma Tennant's "Pemberley"
and Julia Barrett's "Presump
tion: An Entertainment" —
both pick up at the end of the
original, chronicling the lives of
the Darcys, Bingleys and lien
nets shortly after the marriage
of Elizabeth Bennet and
Fitzwilliam Darcy.
That is where both make
their first mistake. Rather than
putting a new twist on the origi
nal — the way Jean Rhys'
"Wide Sargasso Sea" did with
"Jane Eyre" — the two sequels
simply add more and more of the
same to a novel that Jane Austen
was perfectly happy to end
where she did.
For unlike "Gone With the
Wind," whose climactic ending
cried out for a sequel, "Pride and

Prejudice" is an organic whole,
ending with all conflicts re
solved, Darcy's pride deflated
and Elizabeth's prejudice abat
ed. Austen's readers aren't
burning to know how Elizabeth
copes with married life (the plot
of "Pemberley") or who Darcy's
younger sister Georgiana mar
ries (the plot of "Presumption").
If the sequels had more sub
stance, perhaps readers would be
enticed to care about these new
plot developments. But both Bar
rett and Tennant try too hard to
emulate Austen's style, and their
respective novels suffer.
For example, the reader can
almost feel the authors strug
gling to capture the perfect 19th
century tone — choosing the ap

tionary word, changing all the
"she saids" to "said shes" and
