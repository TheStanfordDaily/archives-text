The First Time: Women Speuk Out
About "Losing Their Virginity"
By Karon Bouris
Conari Press, $18.95, 212 pp.
Reading "The First Time: Women
Speak Out About 'Losing Their Virgini
ty'" is like eavesdropping on hundreds of
conversations about sex; it gives you an
illicit thrill. But if you're looking for seri
ous erotica or a sexual instruction manu
al, skim page 148 (a juicy lesbian scene)
and check out another book.
"The First Time" is Karen Bouris' ad
mittedly unscientific survey of women's
first sexual experiences. Intended to fill a
long-neglected niche in the field of female
sexuality, the book interweaves 200
anonymous accounts with the author's
commentary. Women of diverse ages,
races and sexual orientations are repre
sented, but their stories are more com
pelling for their similarities than their
differences.
An unsurprising, if discouraging

theme is the extent to which sex becomes
an instrument of power and control.
Bouris devotes an entire chapter to
women who were violated in one way or
another — one woman at age 3. Another
lost her virginity the night she was raped
at her first sorority formal.
One woman candidly recalls her first
sexual experience with an abusive
boyfriend: "Because I was scared of him
and no one else was home, 1 gave in. I
didn't enjoy it at all. It hurt mostly and I
just lay there. . . . When I look back on it,
I hate myself for being so naive and I also
hate him."
Bouris presents this story and others
with minimal commentary, recognizing
the power of the women's words and al
lowing them to speak for themselves.
Very few women interviewed enjoyed
their "first time." One woman remembers
her first intercourse as feeling "like trying
to force something in a place that didn't
really fit — like your thumb up your
nose." Another says, " It's sort of the same
feeling one gets on birthdays: you know
you're a year older, but you don't feel it."

The most instructive part of the book
concerns what Bouris calls the "romantic
minority" — women who enjoyed losing
their virginity. These women have sound
advice for both novices and experienced
lovers about what makes sex good: love,
consent, emotional connection and phys
ical awareness.
Many of these women say they did not
expect fireworks their first time, so they
weren't disappointed. One woman re
members: "Although my body felt un
comfortable and sore, I felt emotionally
satisfied and closer to my partner than
ever before; it was his first time also."
An additional plus for these women
was what happened after lovemaking —
caresses and communication. Their part
ners were sensitive, understanding and
concerned; they were also willing to try
again.
Many of the women in this section ap
proached sex thoughtfully and deliber
ately. One woman, now middle aged, re
called the careful preparations her part
ner made: in addition to a hotel room and
birth control, "he had a savings account

set aside for an abortion and airfare out
side of the U.S. if all else failed. This was
good."
The most uplifting theme of the book
concerned what was gained when virgin
ity was lost. Even women who had been
raped often had a pleasurable sexual
awakening later — an initiation into a
world of sensual exploration.
Some women did not find this awak
ening until they had sex with other
women, but almost all found that sex got
better as they went along. From the
woman who "only had sex because I
heard it got better" to the woman who
can personally "verify the rumor that
women get more sexual as they get
older," patience and persistence seem to
pay off, according to the accounts.
Many of the women interviewed said
they felt the term "losing your virginity"
was misleading, because thev gained so
much from the experience: improved
body image and awareness, confidence
and self-knowledge. Bouris even puts the
phrase in quotes, identifying it as a social
construct rather than an actual loss.
