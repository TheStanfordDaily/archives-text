Daphne du Maurier: The Secret Life of the
Renowned Storyteller
By Margaret Forster
Doubleday, $25,457 pp.
Daphne du Maurier's suspenseful, highly at
mospheric romances (and the movies based on
them) earned her an enduring reputation as "the
world's most popular romantic novelist." In the
words of her longtime editor Norman Collins,
"no one ever imagined more than Daphne."
Perhaps her imagination was too powerful.
Upon her death in April, 1989, du Maurier's
imaginative works were praised, while her life
was judged privileged and productive, but large
ly uneventful.
Novelist, playwright, poet, closet lesbian,
muse to Hitchcock and Dame of the British Em
pire, recent research reveals that du Maurier's
life was anything but uneventful.
Perhaps that's why not one but two new
books celebrate her life and legacy — Susan

Hill's "Mrs. de Winter," a sequel to du Maurier's
most famous novel, "Rebecca," and Margaret
Forster's deft biography, "Daphne du Maurier:
The Secret Life of the Renowned Storyteller."
Daphne zuouCdhave approved
As its title suggests, Forster's biography is
surprising, and surprisingly frank, especially
considering that it was researched and written
with the full cooperation of du Maurier's heirs.
According to Forster, "Daphne" would have
wanted it that way — indeed, she was an out
spoken advocate of truthful, all-inclusive biogra
phies, as opposed to what she once described as
"stereotyped, dull-as-ditchwater, or very ful
some praising" ones.
But Forster's task cannot have been easy. An
intensely private person, du Maurier kept her
personal life a secret from even her children.
Solitude "not only made her happier but in some
strange way excited her," Forster writes.

But Daphne was a diligent correspondent —
indeed, much of the book feels as if it came
straight from the writer's own pen. Forster
draws on recently discovered letters to uncover
two lesbian love affairs — one unrequited pas
sion for Ellen Doubleday, the wife of her Ameri
can publisher, and a more reciprocal relationship
with actress Gertrude Ijawrence — and a life as
thrilling and complex as any of Daphne's novels.

Forster paints Daphne's pastel-colored past
so richly that it's hard to believe the tall, elegant
writer walked among us only a few years ago.
The daughter of the famous actor-manager
Gerald du Maurier and granddaughter of emi
nent Victorian artist-novelist George du Mauri
er, young Daphne was privileged and knew it.
But that knowledge only made her feel guilty for
being so unhappy.
Daphne wanted to be a boy. She longed for the

freedom boys enjoyed, and suspected (correctly)
that her father wished he'd had a son. She often
dressed as a boy and eventually convinced her
self that she was a boy.
"Her outward form was a mistake," Forster
writes. "Inside, she was a boy, with a boy's mind
and heart and ambitions. Everything she did,
she did as she judged a boy would do."
Rut with the onset of puberty, Daphne "had
to acknowledge that there was no escape from
being a girl" and "forced herself to lock up in a
box the boy she had at heart Daphnie thought
herself to be."
As a teenager, she pursued flirtations with a
charming older cousin and a revered
schoolmistress. (Though relentlessly homopho
bic, she suspected herself of "Venetian" — du
Maurier code for "lesbian" — tendencies and
experimented extensively, if guiltily.)
She despised the idea of marriage, but even
tually succumbed to Tommy Browning, a com
manding officer of the Grenadier Guards.
Their father had kept Daphne and her two sis
ters like doves in a cage, and, after her marriage,
"breaking out of that cage . . . hardly resulted in
her becoming any less protected." But Tommy's
military duties (and, later, World War II) intrud
ed on her charmed life and she dutifully followed
her husband to Alexandria, Egypt.
'Mrs. du 'Maurier and Mrs. de iVinter
In Egypt, her husband's men perceived her as
"a slip of a girl, blonde and pretty enough to
whistle at, always with a rather diffident air,
someone who blushed easily and had no air of au
thority whatsoever."
The description just fits the second Mrs. de
Winter, the reluctant heroine of "Rebecca."
Daphne wrote "Rebecca" while in Egypt, in
spired by her feelings of displacement and her
homesickness for her beloved Cornwall. (She
even used her house there, Menabilly, as the
model for Manderley, the novel's famous set
ting.)
"She herself felt an outcast, an outsider, some
onewhodid notfitinand was aware of it," Forster
writes. "More and more, her theme came to be not
simply one of how jealousy motivates people but
how feelings of isolation distort reality."
In addition to being bashful and anti-social.
Daphne was an incompetent housekeeper — a
fact that became obvious now that she had na
tive servants to command. Her lack of domestic
skills is not surprising considering that while
growing up, she never even had to make her own
bed. The author's feelings of inferiority and in
timidation went straight into the character of
the second Mrs. de Winter.
'The trappings of success
"Rebecca" turned out to be her best and best
beloved novel — contrary to the author's expec
tations. Daphne had no illusions about her early
success as a writer; her family, her connections
and her wholesome good looks all garnered her

publicity and special treatment.
But this knowledge and"the trappings of suc
cess — seeing the finished book, seeing the
cover with her name on it, receiving reviews,
notching up sales — meant little to her at the
time. What was important was that she had not
deluded herself: she could write."
Nevertheless, Daphnie was chronically inse
cure about her ability. She was genuinely sur
prised by the success of "Rebecca," of which she
had written to her publisher, "I only hope it's
not an awful flop." The ending, she felt, was "a
bit brief- and a bit grim" for the book to be "a
winner."
Hopeless when it came to spelling and gram
mar, Daphne relied on her editors extensively
and humbly accepted criticisms from publish
ers,when they dared to voice any.
Unfortunately, Daphne was incapable of
adapting to changing literary tastes and publish
ing practices. More accurately, she was unwill
ing.
"Her kind of novel, as she herself realized,
was no longer in sympathy with the trend to
ward the realistic fiction she hated. She had it in
her to change and produce something different,
but not the desire: she wanted to stay true to an
older tradition."
'fame, frustration and fear
But that older narrative tradition was also
problematic. A recurring theme in the book is
Daphne's frustrated desire to be taken seriously,
both by her publishers and her public. Despite
highly successful forays into history, biography
and nonfiction, she was (and is) typecast as a
writer of romances.
"Most common of all was the tag attached to
her name: 'the world's most popular romantic
novelist, ' " Forster writes. "This was a misinter
pretation only because the very word 'romantic'
has become so debased; in its original meaning,
as a teller of stories, it was perfectly accurate."
She also struggled with writer's block, always
fearing that her next novel, her next idea would
be her last. Forster points out that "everyone
who knew her was aware of her great fear that
she had dried up creatively — she talked about
it freely, constantly asking what she could do."
Daphne, with her many boats and houses,
lived in constant fear of bankruptcy, even when
drawing thousands of pounds in royalties. Per
haps some of her concerns were justified. Due to
heavy wartime taxation, Daphne "should have
been rich and yet she was not," according to
Forster. Remembering her father's flagrant
spending, she was generous but cautious with
her money.
One solution to both her financial and cre
ative bankruptcy was to delve into her own fam
ily history, either for inspiration or for ready
made plots that could be easily transcribed for
publication even that resource was quickly
exhausted, and, as Daphne grew older, new ideas
became increasingly few and far between.
'Pub(icity and performance
in Daphne's life, "journalists began to be
tolerated, and those who came were agreeably
surprised to find how affable and lively she could
be, not at all the cold, remote, aloof, reclusive
person of her public image."
But despite her vivacious and increasingly vis
ible public persona, Daphne was tired and dispir
ited. More than ever, life had become "a perfor
mance, and . . . the more convincingly casual she
had been, thegreater the fatigue." The only ques
tion was, how long could the show go on?
For comfort, Daphne turned to psychology and
philosophy. Writing was largely out of the ques
tion; her books "came from sources deep within
her and these were empty." Her last works were
recycled collections of notes and short stories.
She survived a halfhearted suicide attempt to
die in her sleep, a great-grandmother, at age 81.
