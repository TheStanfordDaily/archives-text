When we last saw Maxim de Winter and
his nameless second wife, they were reading
week-old newspapers on a sunny hotel bal
cony somewhere in Europe, quietly basking
in self-imposed exile.
Maxim had confessed to killing Rebecca,
his loathsome first wife. Manderley, his an
cestral manor, was in ashes. Mrs. Danvers,
the villainous housekeeper, had disap
peared into the woods. And our reluctant
young heroine was out of Rebecca's shadow
at last.
"Mrs. de Winter" — a satisfactory sequel
to Daphne du Maurier's 1938 suspense clas
sic, "Rebecca" — finds its title character liv
ing with the secret knowledge that her hus
band murdered his first wife, adrift in a
postwar Europe too battle-scarred to care.
The couple has been abroad an improbable
12 years, running from the past and gener
ally avoiding the present.
Mrs. de Winter (author Susan Hill does
not presume to give her a first name) wist
fully describes "the way we always seemed
to be in retreat, always carefully turning
away our faces." But they cannot run from
fate, which eventually calls the couple back
to England — back to Manderley.
This time around, the second Mrs. de
Winter is more narrator than heroine, and
spends most of the novel briefing the reader
on the events of "Rebecca" and posing
rhetorical questions — a combination that
makes for some awkward prose.
"What was I thinking of? What was I
planning to do? Why was I making this jour
ney, the journey I had said and believed I
could never make again? Why was I tempt
ing fate?"
Hill duly rounds up the usual suspects —
Jack Favell, Mrs. Van Hopper, Colonel
Julyan — plus a few new, forgettable faces.
Blackmail, false starts and false friends
abound. Inevitably, Mrs. Danvers shows up,
provoking another flurry of interrogations.
"How had she found us? Where had she
come from? Did she live nearby? If so, was
that chance? What did she know of our life
before this, and now, since we had come
here? . . . And how had she come here this
afternoon?"
Mrs. Danvers, once so formidable, so
chilling, is reduced to a spiteful, senile old

woman in Hill's hands. Nevertheless, Mrs.
de Winter cowers before her, just as she did
in "Rebecca."
"She always had power over me," she ad
mits. "I feared and hated her and she de
spised me and thought me of no account. I
withered to nothing in front of her. With
Favell and in every other respect now, I had
more strength, more confidence. But seeing
Mrs. Danvers, I had become the uncertain,
awkward, self-abasing creature who had
first arrived as a bride at Manderley and
dared to try to take Rebecca's place."
Indeed, the de Winters' marriage is as
dysfunctional as ever, held together by mu
tual insecurity and little else.
"We had had too close a brush with mor
tal danger, there had been too much misun
derstanding, we had almost lost one anoth
er as a result of it," Mrs. de Winter explains.
"We knew our luck, knew the value of what
we had too well to dare to take any risk, even
of the slightest angry word over something
trivial. When people have been through
what we had, they do not tempt fate."
But once Hill recreates du Maurier's
characters, she's unsure of what to do with
them. Her narrative often seems as aimless
as the couple's travels. We, too, wonder
"how long we would continue like this,
being in this place or that for no particular
reason, whether we would do it for the rest
of our lives." A theme — Mrs. de Winter's
search for stability — finally emerges, but
much of the remaining action seems inci
dental.
Hill's chief contribution to du Maurier's
legacy is a sense of accountability. She re
fuses to let the de Winters live out their lives
in comfortable anonymity. Instead, she
deftly delineates the consequences of their
actions — the burden of guilt, the monoto
ny of exile.
"The succession of hotels, the small pen
sions, the neat little houses in which we
took rooms, is a blur now," Mrs. de Winter
muses. "I will never remember any of those,
just the pattern on a curtain, the random
expression on a waiter's face, the sound of a
window creaking as it closed."
Hill comes close to capturing du Mauri
er's atmospheric style, although one can't
help thinking how much more interest
ing a wholly different style and perspective
— say, Mrs. Danvers' — would have
been. The book gets off to a slow start, but,
once begun, Hill knows how to sustain
the tension, building up to an ending as
shocking and perversely satisfying as that
of "Rebecca."
