The Nit picker'« Guide for
Next Generation Trek kern
By Phil Farrand
Dell, $12.95, 384 pp.
Impress your friends at the
next convention with "Star
Trek: The Next Generation"
trivia from Phil Farrand's "The
Nitpicker's Guide for Next Gen
eration Trekkers."
Bloopers and continuity er
rors as well as trivial facts are
meticulously recorded in this
unofficial, unauthorized guide
to the best and worst of the syn
dicated series' first five seasons.
For Farrand, what began as a
bonding experience with fellow
Trekkers has evolved into a full
fledged, full-time mania, as well
as this 384-page treatise.
Every single episode is loving
ly catalogued by title — includ

ing the classics "Skin of Evil,"
"The Naked Now," "A Fistful of
Datas" and "Menage a Troi" —
and star date, with a basic plot
summary and technical analysis
that only a nitpicker (a term that
encompasses most of the show's
fans) could appreciate.
Errors and inconsistencies
are classed as Plot Oversights,
Changed Premises, Equipment
Oddities, Continuity and Pro
duction Problems. Farrand also
includes his own ruminations
and favorite lines, including
such gems as, "It's difficult to
work in a group when you're
omnipotent" and "Things are
only impossible until they are
not."
And then there's the endur
ing philosophical resonance of
the observation: "Life is like
loading twice your cargo weight
onto your spacecraft. If it's ca
naries and you can keep half of
them flying all the time, you're

all right,"
Elaborate charts tally up
such statistics as the number of
women who have "intimate in
terludes" with Riker (4), the
number of times LaForge's
visor is knocked off (2) and the
number of times Picard is kid
napped (10).
NASA-quality graphs invite
readers to match the alien to the
planet to the physical character
istics to the . . . you get the pic
ture.
Farrand throws in his votes
for scenes he'd like to see, best
and worst episode ("When [the
third season finale] faded to
black, I knew it was going to be a
long summer") and some person
al peeves
"True, the Enterprise does a
lot of mapping missions, but
somehow I thought boldly going
would be a little more exciting
than this," she whines.
He also notes changes be

tween seasons, such as new cos
tumes, sets and characters.
Some of Farrand's deduc
tions are amazingly complex
and must have required multi
ple viewings and calculators.
While many of his quarrels are
quite valid, while others seem
just plain silly ("Why does Troi
get to wear the skin-tight bunny
suit?").
Only one episode, "The
Enemy," manages to pass Far
rand's strict scrutiny. "Perfect,"
he proclaims.
Farrand is especially — one
might say obsessively — con
cerned with Data's occasional
use of contractions, Dr. Crush
er's fluctuating hairstyles ("Ev
idently the humidity in sick bay
is murder on 'dos!) and certain
inconsistencies surrounding
care and use of the holodeck.
He waxes rhapsodic over es
pecially smoooth special effects
and Pactrick Stewart's thespian

genius, while ruthlessly mock
ing Worf s lousy aim.
While the time and effort be
hind the book is impressive,
Farrand betrays all the symp
toms of somebody who's spent
way too much time in the
holodeck.
A computer scientist and ad
mitted "Next Generation" fa
natic, he's the stereotypical
Trekkie. Even the most devoted
fan has to hope he's kidding
once in a while, such as in one
trivia quiz instructing the read
er to "answer using a star date
with one number following the
decimal point."
But confirmed nitpickers are
invited to point out any errors
Farrand might have missed. He
even includes a Nitpicker's
Guild Entrance Exam: "How
many crew members can you
name (0-1014)? What type of
VCR do you own? How are your
tapes cataloged?"
