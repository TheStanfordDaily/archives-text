Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend
By Robert James Waller
Warner Books, $16.95, 197 pp.
Robert James Waller's second book,
"Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend," doesn't
stray from the boy-meets-girl, boy-loses
girl formula that made "The Bridges of
Madison County" a runaway hit.
Michael Tillman, a college professor,
falls in love with Jellie Braden, the wife of
his newest colleague. They fight their
feelings for a while, jump into bed â€” er,
fall in love, then separate as Jellie runs
away to India to sort things out.
It isn't easy to write this kind of neo
camp classic. So we've created a handy
Pretentious Romance Construction 'N'
Conversion Kit, sprinkled liberally with
samples of Wallerian prose.
1. Establish the depth of the hero's pas
sion.
Your words: He loved her.
Waller's words: "Michael Tillman
wanted her. Wanted her more than his
next breath, wanted her enough to travel
the world."

2. Give the reader a profound, philosoph
ical reason to believe in this passion.
Your words: It was like magic.
Waller's words: "How does it all
begin? Who knows? And why? Same an
swer. The old Darwinian shuffle. Some
thing primal, something way back or far
down. Something whispering deep in the
bones or genes, 'That one.' "
3. Foreground the subtext whenever pos
sible.
Your words: They liked Judith
Krantz.
Waller's words: "The decline of ro
mance was one of their favorite sub
jects."
4. Go all out on that first declaration of
love.
Your words: I really, really love you.
Waller's words: "You walked through
the door and something started to hum
inside me. The hum has now escalated
into a symphonic scream I can't turn
off."
5. Don't let the hero's sensitive, romantic
side interfere with his libido.
Your words: He wanted to get busy.

Waller's words: "Close to (Jellie) like
this, gray eyes steady on his, he upgraded
his earlier idea about putting her on the
dean's kitchen table. The new plan in
volved stripping her naked, taking of his
own clothes, and flying in that shimmer
ing state of affairs all the way to the Sey
chelles, first class. Upon arrival it would
be a headlong and forever plunge into lu
bricious nirvana."
6. Stretch out that first love scene in a
single Faulknerian sentence.
Your words: They had sex all night
and all day and all night again.
Waller's words: "Michael looked down
at the pulse of blood in her throat, at her
eyes widening as she arched her breasts
and belly toward him, eyes looking first
at him and then straight upwards as
India rolled within her and time went
back to the high country of an older land
where dark hands had moved over those
same breasts and a voice had commanded
her, 'Wider now Jellie, wider still, every
thing, Jellie. Give me all of you, and I'll
give you back yourself when we have fin
ished.' "
7. Motor vehicles make perfect phallic
metaphors.

Your words: She wanted to ride him
like a Harley.
Waller's words: "She wanted to climb
on that black machine and feel the beat of
its engine between her legs and the roar
of wind in her ears."
8. Give the hero a conscience.
Your words: This is so wrong.
Waller's words: "Oh Jellie, Jellie . . .
don't say anything about your body. Give
a poor man space to breathe, space to be
less wicked than you already have made
him in his impure thoughts."
9. Throw in some conflict.
Your words: She turned out to be a he.
Waller's words: "She's gone to India."
10. Have a happy ending.
Your words: And they lived happily
ever after.
Waller's words: "She changed out of
her India clothing and walked down to
ward the stream in an old sweater, jeans
and hiking boot. . . . Water sprayed jew
ellike off Michael Tillman's fly line as he
reached back in the last sunlight of a
blue, mountain evening."
Satisfaction guaranteed. Or your
money back.
