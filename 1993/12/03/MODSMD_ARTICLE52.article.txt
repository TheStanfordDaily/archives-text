The Curious Eat Themselves
By John Straley
Soho Press, $19.95, 264 pp.
A revisionist Sam Spade gets
some northern exposure in
John Straley's second mystery
novel, "The Curious Eat Them
selves."
Straley — a Redwood City na
tive living in Alaska — first
penned the adventures of pri
vate investigator Cecil Younger
in "The Woman Who Married A
Bear." This time. Younger is
drawn into a messy string of
murders in evil, un-environ
mental corporate Alaska.
As the novel opens, Younger
and his ex-girlfriend Hannah
watch the body of Louise Root
— Younger's client and Han
nah's best friend — being fished
out of the ocean.

'My mind was
a dirty sponge
wrung out
tight, the last of
the smelly
water dripping
out.'

Before Hannah can recover
from the loss and Younger can
begin investigating any possible
connections to Root's earlier
rape in the Global gold mines,
more bodies turn up.
Even more suspiciously,
Global cronies approach
Younger with large sums of
money, asking him to ignore
Root's murder and instead in
vestigate eccentric environmen

mate Toddy enlists his help in
finding a lost dog, and tensions —
sexual and otherwise — flare up
between Younger and Hannah.
The story makes for a quick,
light read, highlighted by Stra
ley's colorful language. Gems
like "Mv mind was a dirty
sponge wrung out tight, the last
of the smelly water dripping
out" make up for the fairly facile
plot.
At his best, Straley is random
and quirky, reminiscent of an
other familiar conception of the
Alaskan wilderness, "Northern
Exposure."
Younger straddles the line be
tween emulating and satirizing
the classic Bogart-esque private
eye. While his voice often echoes
hard-boiled detectives of yore, his
sardonic half-witticisms make for
a unique brand of humor.
"I had been given a complex
assignment that involved not
doing anything and I thought I
had better get cracking on not
doing it,"he quips.
But "The Curious Eat Them
selves" suffers from a support
ing cast far more interesting
than the hero himself.
Younger's mother, for exam
ple, is a foul-mouthed, cigarette
smoking, tough-as-nails old lady
who, in just one chapter, establish
es herself as one of the most mem
orable characters of the book.
We can't help liking Hannah,
who seems a younger, sexier
version of Younger's in
domitable mother. Hannah is

tough, intelligent and fearless;
in one scene, she expertly resets
Younger's dislocated thumb
while delivering an unforget
table kiss, all in a split second.
We begin to wonder why she
ever dated — and is still attract
ed to — Younger who, by com
parison, seems like a loser.
The mystery itself unfolds in
a predictably unpredictable
fashion, following the classic
sleuth-story formula. Mislead
ing clues point to the wrong sus
pects until the very end, when
the person-least-expected is re
vealed as Root's murderer. For
mystery buffs, identifying the
real culprit should be as chal-

lenging as cracking a "Scooby
Doo" episode.
But "The Curious Eat Them
selves" isn't really about mys
tery, or murder for that matter.
We find ourselves rushing
through the main plot to the far
more inviting, tasty subplots
and subcharacters. Although
Straley's intentions were proba
bly quite the opposite, the actu
al mystery takes second stage to
Younger's relationships with
Hannah and Toddy.
Let's hope Younger gives up
the private investigation busi
ness so we can read more about
the less mysterious aspects of
his life.
