The Evolution Man:
Or How I Ate My Father
By Roy Lewis
Pantheon, $18, 224 pp.
In "The Evolution Man: Or How I Ate
My Father," Roy Lewis gives a wacky ac
count of man's discovery of fire.
When Father returns from a moun
tain brandishing a torch, Uncle Vanya
accuses him of eating the fruit of knowl
edge. Perhaps Father does transgress
"the established laws of nature" — or
maybe he just speeds up evolution by a
few million years.
In either case, the author satirizes

one family's attempt to organize and
advance their species.
Within one generation of cave dwellers,
Lewis compacts millions of years of evolu
tionary progress.
First Father discovers the use of fire.
Then Alexander gives birth to represen
tational art when he draws Uncle
Vanya's shadow. William brings home a
dog-cub and convinces his family not to
eat it, successfully domesticating the
first pet. Mother invents cooking when
she accidentally throws one of his pets
into the hearth. Ernest, ape-boy and
would-be philosopher, acts as narrator.
Lewis marches us through a cata
logue of mankind's earliest technologi
cal innovations. Father firmly believes

that "an ape-man can have but one
duty: to go on — to manhood, to history,
to civilization!" He trusts that the dis
covery of fire and flint tools will get
them there.
Uncle Vanya, on the other hand, ar
gues that they have "no right to speed
things up," for nature "makels] her
commandments absolutely explicit."
Insisting upon a return to nature, he
scuttles back up a tree.
"The Evolution Man" was first pub
lished in England in 1960, as a work of
science fiction. Last year, it was reissued
in Italy and became a runaway best sell
er. Now, this cheeky account of evolu
tion is once again available in English.
The author's satiric view of science

and social institutions encompasses
everything from the ideology of
courtship to the free-will-versus-deter
minism debate. But his sporadic humor
can't sustain itself for all 224 pages.
Because Lewis also fails to develop
three-dimensional characters, the ma
jority of the novel reads like an Anthro
1 reader. But not since the Flintstones
have we seen a more unconventional
family of cave dwellers.
When Father brought home fire from
the mountain, little did he know that a
can of hair spray and a lighter could pro
vide hours of amusement. Perhaps
Uncle Vanya was right when he insisted
that the stupidest thing apes ever did
was to come down from the trees.
