# a literary gift shopping list

### 
Compiled by the "On Books" staff
Books are easy to wrap and come in all
shapes, sizes and subjects. These selec
tions cost a little more and you probably
won't find them on any syllabi, but
that's what makes them perfect gifts.
Here's what's on our holiday shopping
lists:
Politically correct
Is there a wild woman in your life?
Give her Untamed Tongues: Wild
Words from Wild Women (Conari
Press, $8.95), Stanford grad Autumn
Stephens' follow-up to last year's aw
fully alliterative Wild Women: Cru
saders, Curmudgeons and Com
pletely Corsetless Ladies in the
Otherwise Virtuous Victorian
Era.
This collection of quotes — inspira
tional and otherwise — from 200
women ranging from Ayn to Zsa Zsa

is both wise and witty, punctuated by
Stephens' sassy editorial com
ments. One suspects that she

might agree with Katherine Anne
Porter's observation, "It's a
man's world, and you men can
have it."

Politically incorrect
This Book Sucks by
Beavis and Butt-head (Pock
et Books, $6.95) is exactly
what you would expect from

the reigning kings of masturba
tory humor. In fact, it is basically a
transcript of one (or several) of their
television episodes.
The book offers such personal infor
mation as the delinquent duo's family
trees and a map of their home town, all
related in the traditional Beavis and
Butt-head style that we have come to
know and love. It even includes pictures.
Lots of pictures.
On the negative side, the book is only
funny the first time you read it, and you
don't get any more out of the book by re
peat perusals. But "This Book Sucks"
will make a welcome addition to any per
sonal library, unless of course you have a
brain. Huh-huh.
Subvert the crass materialism of the
holidays with Saints Preserve Us:
Everything You Need to Know
About Every Saint You'll Ever Need
(Random House, $10), a handy and ir
reverent guide by "Saturday Night Live"
scripter Sean Kelly and Rosemary
Rogers.
Cross-referenced by birthdays, pro
fessions and ailments, the book is like a
spiritual yellow pages, offering divine in
tervention for every occasion.
Have yourself a scary little Christmas
Those who would rather suck on a
clove of garlic than see Tom Cruise as the
vampire Lestat (or read one more article
on the subject) can escape to 17th-centu
ry Venice with Anne Rice's 1982 novel
Cry to Heaven (Knopf, $25). Once
again available in hardcover, this
thrilling tale of castrated opera singers is
as exquisitely romantic as anything Rice

has done since.
Still howling over The Ultimate
Werewolf? Now there's The Ultimate
Witch and The Ultimate Zombie
(Dell Trade Paperback, $11.95 each),
two slick collections of short 'n' scary
stories by the likes of Rice, Dean Koontz
and Ray Bradbury.
Table-ready
Last summer's Fame in the 20th
Century was the hippest thing to hit
public television since Kermit did the ca
lypso. Now, Aussie impresario Clive
James has collected his insightful and
sardonic musings into a slick and color
ful treatise on a phenomenon that's as
American as a talking mouse (Random
House, $27).
The Illustrated Woody Allen

Reader (Alfred A. Knopf,
$30),

edited by I.inda Sunshine, is a some
times predictable, sometimes obscure
collection of writer / director / actor
Allen's work.
Although the use of "reader" in this
book's title conjures up images of nev
erending xeroxed pages of academic dri
vel, this slick, richly realized number
would be more at home on a coffee table
than a desk.
While less-than-avid Allen fans might
be put off by the book's incessant glorifi
cation of its subject, it provides engag
ing, colorful browsing all the same.
Sure bets
The smell of acid-free paper will fill the
air as lucky gift-givees unwrap all-pur
pose, no-nonsense, hardcover literary
classics with handsome cloth

bindings that won't
fall apart in

backpack.
Everyman's Library recently intro
duced a Pocket Poets series: tiny hard
cover volumes of the best of Baudelaire
and beyond with nifty signature silk rib
bon bookmarks sewn right in ($10.95
each).
Among Modern Library's new releas
es is Goethe's The Sorrows of Young
Werther ($13.50), the story of an angst
ridden romantic whose suicidal tenden
cies caused a sensational scandal in the
18th century .
For a lighter reading experience,
there's a new boxed set of Lewis Carroll's
Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
and Through the Looking Glass, fea
turing John Tenniel's original illustra
tions (Morrow Junior Books, $29.95).
Not just for kids
First published in 1955, A Bestiary
(Pantheon, $25) is an illustrated collec
tion of poems and prose excerpts on the
subject of animals, including Shake

speare on the dog, Jean de la

Fontaine on the grasshopper,
Homer on the wild boar and
Herman Melville on the ob
* vious.
Artist Celia King pops

.. in to the kid-lit scene with
. Seven Mysterious
Wonders: A Pop-Up

Book (Chronicle Books,
— $9.95). Part of a series
that includes Seven
Modern Wonders,
Seven Ancient Wonders

and Seven Natural Won
ders, this edition features
Stonehenge and Atlantis.

Worth a thousand words
Get enough reading in CIV?

Serve up a feast for the eyes with
picture books. My Day: A Tale of

Fear, Alienation and Despair
(Chronicle Books, $6.95) is Marvin
Heiferman and Carole Kismaric's
wordless photographic narrative
fraught with surreal menace and
dark humor. An empty wallet, a
/ pointed finger and a double-exposed
cat trace a long day's journey into
night.
For proof that almost everything
looks artistic in black and white, trip
through Snapshot Poetics (Chronicle
Books, $12.95), Allen Ginsberg's photo
graphic memoir of the Beat era and be
yond, now available in paperback.
This collection of 70 of Ginsberg's
own candid black and white snaps is a
veritable yearbook of the City Lights
Class of '60-something, capturing Timo
thy Leary, Jack Kerouac, Amiri Baraka,
William de Kooning, William Burroughs
and more. Ginsberg's handwritten cap
tions are practically superfluous under
these famous faces.
The photos range from the mudane,
"What if I took a picture of my reflection in
the mirror?" variety to the unintentional
ly sublime — a grainy still-life of the room
where Ginsberg wrote "Howl," a portrait
of photographer Richard Avedon holding
his own famous portrait of Ginsberg and
Peter Orlovsky, naked and entwined.

Century was the hippest thing to hit
public television since Kermit did the ca
lypso. Now, Aussie impresario Clive
James has collected his insightful and
sardonic musings into a slick and color
ful treatise on a phenomenon that's as
American as a talking mouse (Random
House, $27).
The Illustrated Woody Allen

Reader (Alfred A. Knopf,
$30),

edited by I.inda Sunshine, is a some
times predictable, sometimes obscure
collection of writer / director / actor
Allen's work.
Although the use of "reader" in this
book's title conjures up images of nev
erending xeroxed pages of academic dri
vel, this slick, richly realized number
would be more at home on a coffee table
than a desk.
While less-than-avid Allen fans might
be put off by the book's incessant glorifi
cation of its subject, it provides engag
ing, colorful browsing all the same.
Sure bets
The smell of acid-free paper will fill the
air as lucky gift-givees unwrap all-pur
pose, no-nonsense, hardcover literary
classics with handsome cloth

bindings that won't
fall apart in

backpack.
Everyman's Library recently intro
duced a Pocket Poets series: tiny hard
cover volumes of the best of Baudelaire
and beyond with nifty signature silk rib
bon bookmarks sewn right in ($10.95
each).
Among Modern Library's new releas
es is Goethe's The Sorrows of Young
Werther ($13.50), the story of an angst
ridden romantic whose suicidal tenden
cies caused a sensational scandal in the
18th century .
For a lighter reading experience,
there's a new boxed set of Lewis Carroll's
Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
and Through the Looking Glass, fea
turing John Tenniel's original illustra
tions (Morrow Junior Books, $29.95).
Not just for kids
First published in 1955, A Bestiary
(Pantheon, $25) is an illustrated collec
tion of poems and prose excerpts on the
subject of animals, including Shake

speare on the dog, Jean de la

Fontaine on the grasshopper,
Homer on the wild boar and
Herman Melville on the ob
* vious.
Artist Celia King pops

. Seven Mysterious
Wonders: A Pop-Up

Book (Chronicle Books,
— $9.95). Part of a series
that includes Seven
Modern Wonders,
Seven Ancient Wonders

and Seven Natural Won
ders, this edition features
Stonehenge and Atlantis.

Worth a thousand words
Get enough reading in CIV?

Serve up a feast for the eyes with
picture books. My Day: A Tale of

Fear, Alienation and Despair
(Chronicle Books, $6.95) is Marvin
Heiferman and Carole Kismaric's
wordless photographic narrative
fraught with surreal menace and
dark humor. An empty wallet, a
/ pointed finger and a double-exposed
cat trace a long day's journey into
night.
For proof that almost everything
looks artistic in black and white, trip
through Snapshot Poetics (Chronicle
Books, $12.95), Allen Ginsberg's photo
graphic memoir of the Beat era and be
yond, now available in paperback.
This collection of 70 of Ginsberg's
own candid black and white snaps is a
veritable yearbook of the City Lights
Class of '60-something, capturing Timo
thy Leary, Jack Kerouac, Amiri Baraka,
William de Kooning, William Burroughs
and more. Ginsberg's handwritten cap
tions are practically superfluous under
these famous faces.
The photos range from the mudane,
"What if I took a picture of my reflection in
the mirror?" variety to the unintentional
ly sublime — a grainy still-life of the room
where Ginsberg wrote "Howl," a portrait
of photographer Richard Avedon holding
his own famous portrait of Ginsberg and
Peter Orlovsky, naked and entwined.

Books are easy to wrap and come in all
shapes, sizes and subjects. These selec
tions cost a little more and you probably
won't find them on any syllabi, but
that's what makes them perfect gifts.
Here's what's on our holiday shopping
lists:
Politically correct
Is there a wild woman in your life?
Give her Untamed Tongues: Wild
Words from Wild Women (Conari
Press, $8.95), Stanford grad Autumn
Stephens' follow-up to last year's aw
fully alliterative Wild Women: Cru
saders, Curmudgeons and Com
pletely Corsetless Ladies in the
Otherwise Virtuous Victorian
Era.
This collection of quotes — inspira
tional and otherwise — from 200
women ranging from Ayn to Zsa Zsa

is both wise and witty, punctuated by
Stephens' sassy editorial com
ments. One suspects that she

might agree with Katherine Anne
Porter's observation, "It's a
man's world, and you men can
have it."

Politically incorrect
This Book Sucks by
Beavis and Butt-head (Pock
et Books, $6.95) is exactly
what you would expect from

the reigning kings of masturba
tory humor. In fact, it is basically a
transcript of one (or several) of their
television episodes.
The book offers such personal infor
mation as the delinquent duo's family
trees and a map of their home town, all
related in the traditional Beavis and
Butt-head style that we have come to
know and love. It even includes pictures.
Lots of pictures.
On the negative side, the book is only
funny the first time you read it, and you
don't get any more out of the book by re
peat perusals. But "This Book Sucks"
will make a welcome addition to any per
sonal library, unless of course you have a
brain. Huh-huh.
Subvert the crass materialism of the
holidays with Saints Preserve Us:
Everything You Need to Know
About Every Saint You'll Ever Need
(Random House, $10), a handy and ir
reverent guide by "Saturday Night Live"
scripter Sean Kelly and Rosemary
Rogers.
Cross-referenced by birthdays, pro
fessions and ailments, the book is like a
spiritual yellow pages, offering divine in
tervention for every occasion.
Have yourself a scary little Christmas
Those who would rather suck on a
clove of garlic than see Tom Cruise as the
vampire Lestat (or read one more article
on the subject) can escape to 17th-centu
ry Venice with Anne Rice's 1982 novel
Cry to Heaven (Knopf, $25). Once
again available in hardcover, this
thrilling tale of castrated opera singers is
as exquisitely romantic as anything Rice

has done since.
Still howling over The Ultimate
Werewolf? Now there's The Ultimate
Witch and The Ultimate Zombie
(Dell Trade Paperback, $11.95 each),
two slick collections of short 'n' scary
stories by the likes of Rice, Dean Koontz
and Ray Bradbury.
