# Summer storage may be salvaged
## Budget cuts fuel uncertainty about reinstatement of service 
### Josh Green Staff writer 
Students will be able to store their belongings on
campus this summer if negotiations between the
University and the ASSU Senate go as planned.
But University administrators and ASSU mem
bers still disagree on just how or if the University
should operate summer storage again. In lightof the
new $'20 million budget cuts, administrators say
that the entire cost of on-campus storage must be
borne by students through storage foes, while some
students maintain that the University should foot
part of the bill.
ASSU Senate Chair Greg Waldorf said an agree
ment to reinstate storage will likely be reached with
the Universitv bv the end of January.
