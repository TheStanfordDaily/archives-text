# Summer storage may be salvaged
## Budget cuts fuel uncertainty about reinstatement of service 
### Josh Green Staff writer 
Students will be able to store their belongings on
campus this summer if negotiations between the
University and the ASSU Senate go as planned.
But University administrators and ASSU mem
bers still disagree on just how or if the University
should operate summer storage again. In lightof the
new $'20 million budget cuts, administrators say
that the entire cost of on-campus storage must be
borne by students through storage foes, while some
students maintain that the University should foot
part of the bill.
ASSU Senate Chair Greg Waldorf said an agree
ment to reinstate storage will likely be reached with
the Universitv bv the end of January.
"Students made it quite clear
that they think summer storage
is an essential service," Waldorf
said. "This summer it won't be
as haphazard as it was before
. . . there will be some limita
tions."
Summer storage fell victim to
budget cuts last year, after the
University decided that it was a
"non-essential" student service.
But after significant student
protest, the ASSU Senate decided
to lobby the University to bring
back summer storage.
On Oct. '26, the senate passed a
bill that gave Waldorf power to
investigate the possibilities for
summer storage. Waldorf was
supposed to brief the senate on
storage during Tuesday's meet
ing, but the item was tabled
because of the meeting's tight
agenda.

Waldorf said that the ASSU is
asking the University to run stor
age again, unless the ASSU can
find some way to run it responsi
bly and at a profit. But he said he
"would have to be convinced by
the people who run it" that oper
ating something as large as sum
mer storage would not be a finan
cial drain on the ASSU.
"You don't just open a few
doors and drop a few boxes when
you do this," Waldorf said. "The
ASSU is not such a big organiza
tion, and we need to be selective
about what businesses we can
run."
Waldorf said the University
should cover the costs of the ser
vice that are not covered by stu
dent fees.
Assoc. Director of Housing
Rodger Whitney was somewhat
less optimistic than Waldorf,
though, saying that the Universi
ty is still reviewing a number of
options and will have a definite
plan by the end of winter quarter.
According to Whitney, the Uni

versity is deciding whether sum
mer storage should be handled by
the ASSU, the University or not
at all. He said the new rounds of
budget cuts have "put even more
pressure on everyone in the Uni
versity to cut corners."
"The money to do it is gone
from the last budget cuts," said
Mary Edmonds, the vice provost
for student affairs. "We have to
preserve those things most essen
tial to the University's academic
mission, and this type of service is
not."
And even if the University
decides that it can provide the ser
vice, Whitney said the fees "might
become too expensive 'for stu
dents)."
But Waldorf said that any pos
sible fee would be "modest,"
pointing out that it will not even
come close to expensive off-cam
pus storage facilities.
"I'd be very surprised if stu
dents had to pay anything more
than $20 for the summer," Wal
dorf said.
