# University taps water market
## 
### Tish Williams Senior staff writer 
Move over Evian, now there's something trendier.
Officially licensed "Stanford Spring Water,"
hearing the University seal, is now on sale at the
Bookstore and Tresidder Union, with Tresidder Ex
press and the Stanford Stadium sales still to come.
Not your average campus tap water, the product
— spring water marketed by the Private Label
Water Company — comes from Auburn, Calif., in
the Sierra Nevadas, according to Luins Williams,
founder of the company.
Williams has marketed similar water products for
a variety of organizations and individuals, ranging
from country Western singers to talk shows to large
corporations.
"1 picked Stanford because it's one of the most
prestigious schools in the country," Williams said.
Williams started selling his prod
uct as part of a deal with San Fran
cisco City College, his alma mater.
His operation has now spread to
Stanford, followed by Northern Cal
ifornia schools such as Sonoma
State, Chico State, Humboldt State
and Canada College.
The 16.9-ounce bottle sells for
85 cents and comes with an
unusual cap resembling those on
dishwashing liquid containers.
"People like the top. There's a
special top on the bottle so you
can refill it — so it's reusable —
instead of just throwing it away,"
said Nikki Jarvis, a part-time

employee at the Bookstore.
Part of the beauty of the busi
ness venture, according to
Williams, is the contribution his
company makes to the Stanford
Office of Financial Aids, which
receives about 5 percent of the
wholesale price.
In each of his projects,
Williams gives a percentage of the
wholesale price to a charitable
organization. As an example, he
cited the San Francisco Chinese
Chamber of Commerce. A portion
of the proceeds from his "Year of
the Dog" 12-month deal are
donated to the organization.
"I thought of the idea one day,
and being a minority business
man I wanted to give something
back, not just take," Williams
said. "I had to pay for everything

in college — books, clothes ... I
wanted to give something back to
not only the African-American
community, but the student body
at large through financial aid."
In addition to Williams' 5 per
cent donation, the Office of Finan
cial Aids receives a portion of
Stanford's licensing revenues,
according to Mary Morrison, an
assistant director of financial aids.
She said the office earned about
$164,500 last year from such
licensing. A representative in the
Office of Technology Licensing
added that all revenue from the
licensing program goes back into
undergraduate scholarships.
Over 500 colleges have con
tacted Williams, and he feels the
water has been "very well
received" by Stanford customers.
