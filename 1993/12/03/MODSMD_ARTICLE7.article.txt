Move over Evian, now there's something trendier.
Officially licensed "Stanford Spring Water,"
hearing the University seal, is now on sale at the
Bookstore and Tresidder Union, with Tresidder Ex
press and the Stanford Stadium sales still to come.
Not your average campus tap water, the product
— spring water marketed by the Private Label
Water Company — comes from Auburn, Calif., in
the Sierra Nevadas, according to Luins Williams,
founder of the company.
Williams has marketed similar water products for
a variety of organizations and individuals, ranging
from country Western singers to talk shows to large
corporations.
"1 picked Stanford because it's one of the most
prestigious schools in the country," Williams said.
