## Investigators search for Klaas in fields 
### 
PETALUMA, Calif. (AP) â€” The search for kid
nap victim Polly Klaas focused yesterday on the
spot where police unknowingly helped the prime
suspect pull his car from a ditch an hour after the
abduction and 15 miles from the girl's house.
In a bid to link Richard Allen Davis, 39, to the
Oct. 1 abduction, authorities used a helicopter
and dogs to comb the tree-studded hills and fields
near where he was interviewed by Sonoma Coun
ty Sheriffs deputies within hours of the kidnap
ping.
The search for evidence targeted a one-square
acre swath of wooded land near Santa Rosa, about
15 miles from where the 12-year-old girl was taken
at knifepoint by a bearded man.
Some 30 volunteers helped dozens of FBI
agents and local law enforcement officials who
were trying to tie Davis to the crime. Earlier this
week authorities found clothing and other person
al belongings that the FBI later linked to the kid
napping.
Meanwhile, Davis appeared briefly in Mount
Sanhedrin Municipal Court in Ukiah, where he
was sentenced to 30 days in jail after pleading
guilty to an unrelated drunken driving charge.
Security at the small courthouse was tight.
Davis was shackled and flanked by Mendocino
County Sheriff Jim Tuso and three detectives, who
then returned him to his jail cell.
Though Davis has not been charged with the
kidnapping, he remained the prime suspect, said
FBI spokesman Rick Smith.
"This case is being given the highest priority by
the FBI and the Petaluma P.D.," Smith said.
Davis, a parolee, was questioned and released
by sheriff s deputies early on Oct. 2, when he ran
his car into a ditch on the rural Santa Rosa road
and a woman living nearby reported him as a tres
passer.
At the time, deputies who helped pull the car
out of the ditch were unaware of the kidnapping
an hour before. Davis was arrested on parole vio
lations late Tuesday at an Indian reservation
about 70 miles north of Petaluma.
Psychiatric reports written before a 1977 con
viction said Davis heard voices telling him to
assault, rape and rob, according to San Mateo
County court records. But he was a model parolee
until he failed to report to his parole officer on
Nov. 15, authorities said.
Still, the fact that Davis was free at all incensed
Polly's father, Marc Klaas, who was incensed at
the idea that repeat offenders are released from
prison.
"We've had enough of this. We've had enough of
this as a country. It's time to make changes,"
Klaas said. "It's time to protect our children. It
has to happen, because if it doesn't happen we're
dead as a society."
