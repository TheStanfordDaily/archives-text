Randall E. Stross
author of
STEVE JOBS AND THE NeXT BIG THING
(Published by Atheneum)
Stross provides a revealing account of what happened when Steve
Jobs left Apple Computer and founded NeXT, whose mission was to
manufacture computers that were going to "change the world." In a
story of fabulous wealth and more than a few disasters, Stross
describes Jobs' clashes with Bill Gates and Ross Perot as well as
NeXT's involvement with Xerox, IBM, Canon and the William Morris
Agency. STEVE JOBS AND THE NeXT BIG THING is a tale of one
man's efforts to captivate and dominate an industry and a technology
that now affects all Americans.
STEVE JOBS AND THE NeXT BIG THING is the story of the per
sonal computer industry and one of its pioneers, a man who came to
believe in, more than anyone else, his own myth.
Randall E. Stross was born in 1954 and cut his computing teeth
while a Stanford graduate student. He received his Ph.D. in history in
1982. He lives with his wife and two children in Menlo Park, California.
This event will be held at the Bookstore on campus.
