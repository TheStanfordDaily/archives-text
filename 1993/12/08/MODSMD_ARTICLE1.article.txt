# Trying 'to do better'
## Group to re-evaluate minority grad student recruitment, retention 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Faced with statistics indicating inade
quate recruitment and retention of mi
nority graduate students, Provost Con
doleezza Rice has created a committee to
re-evaluate the current recruitment
process.
The 14 committee members will repre
sent the interests of all of the major grad
uate schools on campus and will report
their findings in April.

"I foresee changes in
the way we go about re
cruiting," said Assoc.
Dean of Graduate Policy
George Dekker, who will
head the task force.
"I think that we may
be able to get people to
collaborate more than
they do currently," he
said. "1 want to take it for

said. "I want to take it for

granted that we need to do better."
The provost launched the Committee
on the Recruitment, Retention and Grad
uation of Targeted Minority Graduate
Students in order to correct discrepancies
between the University's targets for mi
nority enrollment and the number of mi
nority students actually here. The three
targeted groups are African-Americans,
Native Americans and Mexican Ameri
can/Puerto Ricans.
Last month, the Faculty Senate's Com
mittee on Graduate Studies reported that
the University has fallen short of its five
year minority graduate student recruit
ment goal by 70 percent.
"I think the principle issue is how we
can increase the number of minority stu-


Dekker
dents not only admitted to our
programs but retained," said
committee member Elizabeth Fit
ting, student services officer at
the Graduate School of Business.
"Those admitted should be
given the support they need," she
added.
But, according to Dekker, the
problems are even more funda
mental, resulting from a decen
tralization of authority in the
graduate schools three years ago.
Previously, "minority recruit
ment was mostly done centrally
through the dean's office," he
said. "Some faculty also partici
pated on the side."
Today, however, the responsi
bility for recruiting minorities
lies with individual departments
— a move which has placed
increased burdens on already
strapped departmental budgets.
"The basic arrangement has
been that the provost provides
discretionary money for fellow
ships to schools as incentive
money," Dekker said. But other
than that funding, "most of the

schools have found this responsi
bility to be an additional burden
in terms of staff."
Though solutions to these
problems are not yet forthcom
ing, Dekker offered a suggestion.
"I doubt we will re-centralize
minority recruitment," he said.
"If anything, I hope there will be
more departmental responsibility
and hopefully more funding for
recruiting."
But both Dekker and Fitting
stressed that such ideas are provi
sional. "Part of the reason we're
forming this committee is to
brainstorm," Fitting explained.
In addition to trying to
strengthen recruiting efforts,
Dekker said the committee will
look at ways to make minority
students feel more at home while
at Stanford. Minorities are not
going to want to choose a school
which has difficulty retaining its
minority students, he said.
Dekker said the committee
also wants to get "more feedback
from minority graduate students
about how they feel about Stan
ford as a whole."
But he admitted that, in the
end, the campus' attitude toward
minorities is dictated by the stu
dents and faculty. "We can't push
a magic lever and make the cam

pus more receptive to minori
ties," Dekker said.
"I believe students and faculty
have a huge responsibility to
make people feel this is a welcom
ing community," he said, pointing
to ethnic centers as examples of
the University's commitment to
minority issues.
Dekker said he also wants to
find out when students shape
their attitudes about the Univer
sity. "If people drop out or
become disaffected, when does
that happen?" he asked.
He said he thinks the commit
tee "will emphasize recruitment
and retention about equally."
Though a wealth of ideas for
reform have been put on the
table, Dekker said the most
important thing to do is wait until
the committee completes its
review.
"This is a wonderful commit
tee and it's loaded with exper
tise," he said. "We have good rep
resentation from minority
groups. They know lots about
these issues ... far more than 1
do.
"It is our hope that together
we can come up with a coherent
way to confront these issues and
continue the success of our grad
uate departments," he said.
