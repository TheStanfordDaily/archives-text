## Hubble telescope half fixed 
### 
SPACE CENTER, Houston
(AP) — NASA's high-altitude
repair crew installed replacement
parts to fix half of the Hubble
Space Telescope's nearsighted
ness yesterday and then rested
before going out to complete the
job.
Even as they exulted that "we
won the division and we are now
in the playoffs," NASA officials
cautioned against taking success
for granted.
The result of the repairs by the
Endeavour's crew should be a
telescope that will live nearly up
to the original promise of getting
crisp images and detailed scientif
ic data from the faintest and old
est bodies in the universe.
But NASA was stung before.
The agency suffered its greatest
embarrassment not long after the
April 1990 launch of the Hubble
when it had to admit that the
main 94.5 inch-diameter lens had
been ground to the wrong specifi
cations, leaving the telescope
blurry-eyed.
So officials went to great

lengths, more than halfway thr
ough the repair mission, to lower
expectations.
"I have to keep emphasizing, it
will be six to eight weeks until we
have the ability to measure
whether we have total success,
partial success, or whatever," said
Hubble program scientist Edward
Weiler. "Let's not declare total
success."
With ease born of hours of

practice, two spacewalking astro
nauts on the space shuttle
installed a new camera whose
mirrors compensate for the flaws
created by the telescope's mis
shapen main mirror.
A second team, Kathy Thorn
ton and Tom Akers, was set to
install a tricky device that inter
cepts incoming light and corrects
it before it hits three other Hub
ble optical instruments.
