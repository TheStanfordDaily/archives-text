GARDEN CITY, N.Y. (AP) -
A gunman methodically walked
through a crowded commuter
train yesterday evening, random
ly firing at one person after
another. Five people were killed
and 11 wounded before passen
gers subdued him.
The man, a passenger on the
train, started shooting as it was
entering the Long Island Rail
Road's Merillon Avenue station in
Garden City, said Officer Andrew
DeSimone, a spokesman for the
Nassau County police Four of the
wounded were critically hurt,
DeSimone said.
"The guy just went berserk,"
passenger Diane McClarey told
WCBS-TV. "The shots just kept
going off. He would not stop
shooting."

Passengers said they saw the
man fire repeatedly, then reload
his 9-millimeter handgun and fire
again.
"The gunman was subdued by
other passengers on the train and
taken into custody," said Detec
tive Donna Fairweather of the
Nassau police.
Fairweather refused to release
the man's identity. He was taken
to Nassau County police head
quarters in Mineola.
"Right now, there doesn't
seem to be any thing as far as a
motive," DeSimone said. "It
seems like a random shooting."
Five gunshot victims were
taken to Long Island's Winthrop
Hospital for treatment, said hos
pital spokesman John Broder.
A woman identified only as

Erin told CNN the gunman
opened fire without a word.
"He did not say anything, just
started shooting," she said
"He looked a little wild, but he
wasn't screaming or flailing
around," passenger Mark Heaney
told CNN. "He was just randomly
pointing and shooting at peo
ple. ... He appeared fairly calm
for everything that was going on
around him."
Panic swept the train, Erin
said.
"No one pulled the emergency
brake, everyone just kept running.
We were screaming 'Pull the emer
gency brake' . . . The conductor
was telling us to lock the door
because we didn't know if the man
was still running after us," she
said.
