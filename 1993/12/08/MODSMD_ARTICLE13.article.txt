Polly's killer formally charged
SANTA ROSA (AP) — Richard Allen Davis was
formally charged yesterdaywith kidnapping and
murdering 12-year-old Polly Klaas.
Davis, 39, listened impassively as the charges
against him were read in Sonoma County Munici
pal Court.
The murder charge against Davis included the
special circumstance allegations that he killed
Polly while committing robbery, burglary and kid
napping. That means Davis, if convicted, could
face the death penalty or life in prison without
possibility of parole.
Prosecutors did not say in court whether they
would seek the death penalty and left the court
room immediately after the arraignment.
Davis did not enter a plea. He remains held
without bail in the Sonoma County Jail.
Prosecutors, in an affidavit supporting their
request that bail not be granted, said Davis told
investigators that he kidnapped Polly and that he
strangled her near Cloverdale.
After the hearing, Sonoma County Public
Defender Marteen Miller told reporters that Davis

would not plead guilty, because of the special cir
cumstance allegations.
Spill closes Bay Bridge
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — An asbestos spill
closed the five-lane lower deck of the Bay Bridge
during yesterday's commute rush. Three of the
lanes were still idle as the evening hours
approached.
About 20 bags of asbestos fell off a truck at 6:38
a.m., landing in the path of speeding cars that
crushed the bags and turned their contents into
powder. Two lanes of the section that carries traf
fic east reopened at 2:34 p.m.
The bags fell out the back door of the vehicle
near Treasure Island, said Richard Haas, who was
driving the truck for Pacific Rim Environmental
Services.
"I picked up what I could and put it back before
the cars started driving over them," he said.
The accident created a massive traffic jam. The
closing backed up freeway traffic to the Peninsula.
It created a traffic snarl in downtown San Fran
cisco, and added to traffic on other bridges.
