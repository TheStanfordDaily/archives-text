## Editorial Resurrect the Dead Dead Week inhumanely unenforced, should live up to University policy 
### 
IT'S TIME to put students out
of their misery. By killing Dead
Week, that is. Dead Week is
supposedly a time in which no new
material is introduced in classes
and students have a time to catch
up on the quarter's work. But
with each successive quarter, Dead
Week seems become more and
more lively.
Having fallen behind in their
lectures, professors routinely use
the week to cram in two weeks'
worth of material. Reading loads
seem to increase exponentially
and the week culminates in a flur
ry of papers, reports and projects.
Understandably, professors
want to spend as much time as
possible presenting new material
— 10 weeks is hardly enough time
to read and discuss Plato's
"Republic," let alone all the other
material on a CIV syllabus.
But the constraints of the
quarter system must not be used
as an excuse for a heavy work
load during Dead Week. A real
Dead Week is needed at Stanford
to give students a period in which
to "burn the midnight oil" — to
catch up on the work and reading
they haven't finished and to
study for upcoming finals. The
week before finals is dead in
name only, and its original intent
must be restored.
Other top universities, such as
Harvard and Yale, offer students
two-week reading periods with no
classes at the end of each semester
— four academic weeks a year with
no classes. Under Stanford's quar
ter system, two weeks for reading
each quarter would be unworkable
and unnecessary. But one reading
week per quarter — or three weeks
per year — would be comparable to
what other universities offer and
would give students a chance to

collect themselves before finals.
Currently, students are given
no such opportunity. Classes are
in session until the Friday before
finals, and a common due date for
papers is the last day of the quar
ter.
This situation leaves many stu
dents without a chance to review
the material that's been present
ed over the quarter. Instead of
having a chance to reflect on their
studies, students study fiendishly
only "what's going to be on the
test."
A real Dead Week — one in
which teachers didn't present
new material — would allow stu
dents time to thoroughly learn
and absorb material, rather than
cramming everything in during
one all-nighter and forgetting it
the next week.
Unfortunately, professors have
no incentive to follow the Dead
Week policy — it is neither clear
nor enforced. Professors, it
seems, have little knowledge — or
respect — for the policy, and the
lack of debate about the problem
only encourages such noncha
lance.
Students should encourage
University President Gerhard
Casper, the Commission on
Undergraduate Education, the
Faculty Senate and individual pro
fessors to craft a new, explicit
Dead Week policy and to make it
stick. This policy should forbid
professors to assign new readings
or present new material in lecture.
The only assignments due during
Dead Week should be long-term
projects and research papers that
students have been working on for
the entire quarter. Shorter papers
should be due before Dead Week
arrives.
Given the time constraints of
the quarter system, perhaps it's
only feasible to provide a five-day
Dead Week, lasting Wednesday
through Sunday. It may not be an
entire week, but it would go a long
way toward eliminating the mor
bid irony of the current Dead
Week, which drains life from stu
dents and kills intellectualism.
