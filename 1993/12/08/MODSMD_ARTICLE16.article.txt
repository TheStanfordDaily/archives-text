## And dawn comes slowly

OF MANIC-depressives Robert
Lowell wrote, "If we see a light at
the end of the tunnel it's the light
of an oncoming train." And, to be per
fectly frank, this is how I've been feel
ing of late.
Perhaps it can be blamed on the sea
son, cursed as it is with Daylight Savings,
where it begins to turn dark, oh, just
about as I've begun to wring the sleep
from my eyes.
With a lack of sunlight comes the
inevitable winter-green pallor of my skin,
which I catch sight of every time I pass a
reflective surface. And no matter how
many times a friend may lovingly praise
it as "olive," let me remind him that olive
is yet another shade of green. Am I cap
turing the mood?
Yesterday after class, I gladly ducked
indoors and out of the crisp, blue-skied
December day which seemed to mock
my brooding self-pity.
Climbing up the jail-like stairs of
Mirrielees, bent under the academic
weight of my knapsack, I reveled in
thoughts of my peaceful room; all I
ne/eded was my bed, a good book, and
maybe a little Frank. I ignored the mes
sages on the machine, knowing that if I
spoke to anyone now, I might acciden
tally terminate our friendship. Falling
face-down onto my bed, I thought dark
thoughts.
Then, like a train accelerating at full
speed, the sound of Primus, or some

band of equal musical disability, ripped
through the silence. Meet my upstairs
neighbors.
If you've never heard this noise,
imagine someone scraping their fingers
repeatedly across the blackboard in an
attempt to make music. Now imagine
this at a volume so loud that it feels as if
the drummer is playing from inside your
stomach. The only comfort this music
brought me is that there was someone
more distressed than I.
Well, no, it's not really distress. It's
more of just an invading sense of
weariness. I guess the only way to real
ly describe it is Winter Funk. It always
happens at about this time, as the days
grow colder and darker and the year
draws to a close.
Glancing back over the past year, all
the months, with their various nostal
gias or sadnesses, seem to topple in on
me. I suddenly have the desire to break
through this redundant rhythm of liv
ing with its days, months and years
into something wholly new.
What plane would I take, how far
would my car drive me, where would I
go if suddenly all the strings of respon
sibility were cut? What to do when sud
denly I feel as if I have nothing left to
say to the faces that surface before me?
Places, people and time seem to sim
ply meld in my mind, one day becoming
indistinguishable from the next. Philip
Levine captured it when he wrote:

Let me begin again as a speck
of dust caught in the night winds
sweeping out to sea. Let me begin
this time knowing the world is
salt water and dark clouds, the
world
is grinding and sighing all night,
and dawn
comes slowly and changes nothing.
But maybe there is some comfort in
constancy. After all, we are creatures of
habit who seem to structure our lives
around certainty. Perhaps some daily
repetition is not so bad: the molten
dawn, morning calm, late afternoon
shadows and 4 a.m. silence. And even
winter, with the frozen smell of char
coaled leaves on clear nights, has its
moments.
1 met someone who asked me what
this week's column was going to be
about. When I said "Winter Funk," he
looked at me questioningly. "You know,
when it starts to get dark really early
and . . my voice trailed off as I realized
the futility of my explanation at this
loud party to this presumably drunk
person. He paused and then asked, "You
mean when you feel like holding some
one you care about close to you and
watching a movie?" Yeah. Maybe winter
isn't half bad, after all.
