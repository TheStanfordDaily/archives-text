## Stanford Farm Animals speak to campus' mosaic 
### 
AWEEK AGO, we were flying on a
Thanksgiving trip and we had
quite a bit of time to contemplate
life at Stanford between pretzels and the
lavatory. Together we brainstormed sev
eral ideas.
We first debated about the Stanford
Squirrels and how they are everywhere
on campus. Their agility to dodge vehi
cles was also a plus. But we decided that
they are also too out-of-hand as a popu
lation on campus.
The Stanford Trekkers was a little
too sci-fi, but its theme did contain one
of the aspects we were looking for: Mul

ticulturalism. No, we wanted something
that would tell about the history of the
campus, would represent the multicul
tural outlook on campus, and be strong
enough as a mascot to withstand time.
We pondered over our little airplane
meal. Eventually, we turned our atten
tion to "The Farm." Hmmm. What
could be on a farm? The Stanford
Sheep? . . . No, too passive. The Stan
ford Cows? . . . Not! The Stanford Hors
es? . . .Well, it's a possibility. The Stan
ford Bulls? . . . Nah, Chicago imitation.
The Stanford Turkeys? . . . Hmmm . . .
We were getting too anxious for Thanks

giving!
But then the revelation hit us! Why
do we have to have just ONE mascot?
Heck, this is a multicultural university
on the cutting edge of society, right?
Since this is the FARM, and we have
people from all over the world, why not
have a bunch of animals that represents
us. The Stanford Farm Animals!
Every year, Stanford could adopt a
new farm animal — there could be a
huge celebration for the "unveiling" of
the year's farm-animal mascot. A "new"
animal could be added annually to the
Farm. Over the course of 10 years, there

would be 10 farm-animals altogether,
but the current animal chosen for the
10th year would be the star of the show.
Stanford students, faculty, staff and
affiliated members should take this idea
seriously. It satisfies our criteria com
pletely. But most importantly, it shows
how diversified Stanford is, and how the
campus grows in strength over time
with new changes. The Stanford Farm
Animals is the best choice!
