# Band manager makes apology for Big Game choice of Indian garb
## 
### 
In the Dec. 3 issue of The Daily,
Sharon Hernandez-Dorow requested an
apology to the Native American commu
nity for the "Indian" costumes donned
by individuals within a single section of
the Stanford Band during Big Game.
The Band apologizes for the actions of
the individual members of the alto saxo
phone section at Big Game 1993. Their
choice of dress was inappropriate and
insensitive.
Big Game costumes are selected and
organized by individual sections without
input or consent of Band management.
While the Band does not absolve the alto
section of creating an insensitive image,
we assert a total lack of malicious intent
in their insensitivity. For example, some
faces were painted with the block "S";
however, one unfortunate player painted
the "S" backwards and chose to paint
the rest of his face red to conceal the
error — insensitive only because he was
wearing a costume headdress.
The Band does not claim to be an
"equal opportunity offender," rather we

endeavor to maintain an irreverent image.
We attempt to entertain the entire com
munity in a unique manner while sup
porting Stanford athletics and promoting
school spirit. We invite all members of the
Stanford community who have musical
experience to join our ranks.
