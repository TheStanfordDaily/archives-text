# Warm, friendly mascot shows railroad history, can cavort with Band
## 
### 
I just celebrated my 30th reunion at
Stanford, and as I think about my Stan
ford experience, there are nothing but
good thoughts except for maybe one lit
tle nagging void â€” a good mascot!
I have pondered this minor void many
times because I have been besieged at
times by people wanting to bring back
the Indian. I have resolved in my own
mind that Stanford was right in elimi
nating the Indian mascot, but I have
never been able to argue as persuasively
as I'd like. I have now reached the con
clusion that the only way to argue per
suasively and eliminate the void at the
same time is to come up with the perfect

(or at least a really good) mascot.
I think that a really good mascot for
Stanford would be a Golden Retriever.
We could name him Spike and call Stan
ford the Golden Spikes.
This would recognize the railroad his
tory of Leland and would provide a
warm, friendly mascot that just about
everyone (except a few ducks and geese)
likes. We could train him to chase down
frisbees, and it would be a spectacular
and fun event to see Spike and a frisbee
leading the LSJUMB onto the field or
down Colorado Blvd.
