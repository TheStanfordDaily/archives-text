# Swimsuit calendar ad not what outside world should see of Stanford
## 
### 
I am in full agreement with Caroline
Kjm in that the advertisement for the
Asian Dreamgirl Calendar is in bad taste
and doesn't sit well in a magazine of this
standard. The Stanford Daily is the sole
voice and conscience-keeper of this cam
pus and, in addition, our face to the
world.
An advertisement of this sort just

doesn't gel and is cheap and demeaning
It negates with a few simple columns
and rows what all the previous pages
have been trying to say. Freedom of
expression, all right, but we do have to
draw the line somewhere. Though deci
sions are tough and views may differ it
is important that we keep sight of our
purpose and where we are going, at all
times.
The Stanford Daily is not a cheap
soft-porn magazine. Rather it is a news
paper that I can show with pride to my
parents and family as an indicator of
what this great institution is all about.
Do let it be that way.
