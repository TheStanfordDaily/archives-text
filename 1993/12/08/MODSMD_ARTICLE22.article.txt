## Some public displays of Christmas spirit are offensive 
### 
CALL ME Scrooge. Call me The
(Irinch. I hate to spoil your fun, but
I really resent Christmas.
More specifically, I resent the way peo
ple treat Christmas like it's everyone's
holiday. It's not.
I m not sure when I first knew being
Jewish was something unusual, but no
doubt it was in the month of December.
It was December when I asked my
Mom how come Charlie Brown had a TV
special about Halloween, Valentine's Day
and Christmas — but not Hanukkah.
It was December when all the other
kids in school were told to make Christ
mas ornaments in the shape of a green
tree — and I was told to make a Christmas
ornament in the shape of a blue dreidel.
For many American Jews (as well as
Muslims, atheists, and others who don't
celebrate Christmas) December is a time
of being constantly reminded that much
of America still hasn't figured out that
this isn't a Christian country.
"But Christmas is an American holi
day," many people protest, including
some Jews.
I don't agree. Christmas celebrates the

birth of Jesus of Nazareth. Fine, so they
close the post offices. Fine, so some Jews
celebrate it, too. That doesn't mean
Christmas trees, music and colors aren't
Christian symbols.
Here at Stanford, I've been subjected
to December alienation in both blatant
and subtle ways.
• There was a large Christmas tree in
the dining hall of my dormitory for three
weeks freshman year. For "balance,' the
Lagunita dining staff put a picture of a
menorah on the menus one night.
• While having lunch at Fresh Choice
last week, Christmas music piped in over
the speakers — not "Frosty the Snow
man," mind you, but "Joy to the World,
the Lord has Come." How can Christmas
be a secular holiday when its music
sounds like it's trying to convert me?
I recognize that the store clerk who
says "Merry Christmas" is probably not a
rabid anti-Semite. And I know her com
ments are certainly intended in the spirit
of "Peace on Earth" and whatnot.
But I'm stuck in an awkward situation.
By saying, "Thank you," or "Merry Christ
mas," I imply that it's okay to assume

everyone celebrates Christmas. On the
other hand, do I want to be rude by saying
nothing, or, even worse, making a fuss?
It's kind of like a lesbian who's told
she's welcome to bring her husband or
boyfriend to a party, or a blind person
who's asked what his favorite color is.
The comment is well-intentioned, but the
effect is awkward, at best.
Of course, some expressions of Christ
mas hegemony are more obnoxious, and
demand a response.
• At Stanford in Washington last fall,
where more than a third of the students
were non-Christian, Christmas lights
were placed in students' windows without
their permission.
• My Japanese professor used to point
at students, including me, and ask (in
Japanese): "What do you want for Christ
mas?" When I protested in private, he
said, "In Japan, we have no Jews. Every
one has Christmas. You must understand
cultural differences." I said that was
exactly the point, but he refused to
change his practice. As if to rub it in, the
first question on the final that year asked
us what we got last Christmas.

I know some people will wish I had
kept my mouth shut, as this is a touchy
subject for Christians and non-Christians
alike. Many Christians are offended at
the suggestion that there's "something
wrong" with the open celebration of their
holiday, and many Jews and others
protest that they simply love the lights,
music and spirit of the season.
On the other hand, there are lots of
religious Christians who agree with me
that Christmas should be taken out of
the shopping malls and put back into
church. And lots of people who celebrate
Hanukkah, Kwanzaa or nothing at all
would also like to see American religious
and cultural diversity respected.
So what am I asking for?
I certainly don't want anyone to hide
their pride in celebrating religious or cul
tural festivals that are important to
them. In some contexts, such as a dormi
tory, it makes sense for those students
who are observing a special day to recog
nize and honor it — whether it's Yom
Kippur, Cesar Chavez's birthday or
National Coming Out Day.
And if students were actually here on

Christmas Day, I would have no problem
with canceling classes on that day and
putting up a few decorations. But the
idea that "the Christmas Season" starts
the day after Thanksgiving comes from
Kmart, not the New Testament.
It's possible to share the joys of one's
religious and cultural traditions without
implying that everyone else is supposed
to join in. Sensitivity — that's what I'm
asking for.
Here's the irony: Hanukkah, which
starts tonight, is more than anything a
celebration of religious freedom, honor
ing the Maccabees. The Maccabees were
Jews who took up arms to resist being
forced to live as the majority culture —
Hellenism — would have them live.
I'm not prepared to go into battle, but
as the month continues, I know I'm going
to feel more and more like a Maccabee.
Bah, humbug.
