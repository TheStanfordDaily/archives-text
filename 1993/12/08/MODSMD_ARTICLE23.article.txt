# The 						ASSU and grads: diverse needs, demands
## Graduate student gives reasons for sparking Tea Party Karen Seta 
### 
IVVAS ASKED to write about the
Graduate Student Tea Party. Let
me begin by describing the situa
tion faced by graduate students. There
are more than 6,000 graduate students
at Stanford — half the student popula
tion. Many have spouses or domestic
partners; some have families. Many
held jobs in the "real world" before
returning to school; they owned

homes, had retirement plans, and filed
their own tax returns. Most graduate
students have needs and interests that
are far removed from those of the typi
cal undergraduate, and those needs
and interests are often overlooked.
Stipend levels do not reflect students'
cost of living (some students have
incomes that put them below the
poverty line and getting a second job is
often prohibited).
Housing — in both amount and type
— is inadequate to meet graduate stu
dent needs. Graduate housing spots
are taken whenever the University
needs space (e.g., to house undergradu
ates, or for the Pottery Club). The
Graduate Affairs Office was disbanded
during the budget cuts. Hundreds of
additional masters' students were
admitted to increase revenue, making
it difficult for many to get classes they
needed. It's little wonder most gradu
ate students feel the University does
not care about them.
Add to that last year's Daily
endorsement not to fund the Graduate
Student Association and Stanford
Wilderness Experience Active orienta
tion Trips, the only organizations tar
geted to graduate students. True, The
Daily endorsed not funding other orga
nizations, but those had extremely lim
ited scope. The GSA and S.W.E.A.T.
served large groups. When they were
voted out of existence, graduate stu
dents took it personally.
Comments such as "why should we
pay for grad student happy hours"
and the assumption that graduate
students got what they deserved
because they were apathetic only
fueled the fire. Graduate students
typically made up a small percentage
of fee refunds. Since they are half the
paying population, graduate student
dollars were disproportionately fund
ing undergraduate activity. This was
the immediate inequality that the
Graduate Student Tea Party hoped to
correct.
Undergraduates countered, "Rut
many organizations serve everybody.
It's not our fault grad students don't
participate." They are half correct.

Many
organi-

z a t i on s
are open to every
one, but graduate student involvement
is rarely actively recruited. Occasional
ly a flyer finds its way to the Escondido
Village or Rains Offices, but 60 percent
of graduate students live off campus
and many don't get to White Plaza
every day. Also, many organizations
and activities are undergraduate-ori
ented, so that while they may be open
to graduates, they don't serve graduate
student interests. Getting the ASSU to
address graduate student concerns was
a second goal of the Tea Party
The final goal of the Tea Party was
to make everyone — the ASSU and the
administration — aware that graduate
students would not tolerate being over
looked. We wanted to show that gradu
ate students are a significant group
and that they can have a large impact if
they unite. We want the University to
start listening to us and to start
addressing our concerns.
The Tea Party met the first goal
with overwhelming success. It was
obvious by the response that the Tea
Party had struck a nerve. We received
almost 200 responses, most of which
were supportive. A huge number of
graduate students didn't even know
the refund option existed, and many
thanked us for getting the informa
tion to them. This fact only reinforces
the feeling that the ASSU is not serv
ing the graduate students as best as it
can.
However, the ASSU is taking steps
to correct that situation, so we are
making progress on our second goal.
The proposal to split the voting for
funding between graduates and under
graduates is a good one. It will force
organizations to recruit graduate stu

dent awareness if
they want graduate student dollars.
The refund program should be made
available on Folio or AXESS instead of
Leland, because there are large groups
of students (both graduate and under
graduate) who never use e-mail. The
Tea Party will host a non-partisan vot
ing drive in the spring to try to
increase grad student voter participa
tion. The ability to vote through Folio
or AXESS would also increase partici
pation. Hopefully, we can work togeth
er to create an ASSU that will meet
everyone's needs — after all, they're
here to serve us, not the other way
around.
We are a long way from achieving
our ultimate goal. The University has
created two groups to address graduate
housing, but little tangible progress
has been made.
Problems of funding and program
overcrowding still need to be corrected.
We need an administration that recog
nizes the fundamental differences
between the two student populations,
and that can respond sensitively and
equally to the needs of both groups. It
is unfortunate that we had to hurt
some worthwhile organizations to get
our point across.
Unfortunately, the highest power at
this University (as at every) is the
power of the pocketbook But a little
pain now will be worth it in the long
run if we can effect a meaningful
change. Resides, if we had merely writ
ten a petition, would anyone have lis
tened?
