# Input improves the ASSU
## Greg Waldorf 
### 
THE RECENT movement among
graduate students to assert their
right to be better served by the
ASSU has been heard loud and clear. Many
graduate students were justifiably out
raged when the few special fees on the
spring ballot that most directly affected
graduate students were rejected by the
student body as a whole. Without a doubt,
graduate students give more than they get
from the ASSU and unless undergraduates
support the few graduate-oriented fees, it
is unreasonable to expect graduate stu
dents to continue supporting the ASSU
year after year.
Some students have seen the spring
election as a reason for graduate students

to leave the ASSU. A division of the ASSU
without first attempting to bring gradu
ates into the decision-making of the orga
nization would be unfortunate. Graduates
have so much to offer the ASSU because
their perspectives and experiences are dif
ferent than those of undergraduates.
Their participation will lead to a better
organization.

Graduate students now need to begin
participating in the ASSU so that more
graduate-oriented services can be devel
oped and their skills put to positive use.
Many students have complained on these
pages in recent months, but virtually none
have contacted me about how they can get
involved in changing the ASSU more to
their liking. The ASSU is not a zero-sum
organization: an ASSU that better serves
graduates does not inherently serve under
graduates less.

Graduate students have several
avenues for participation in the ASSU.
First, they can run for elective office.
Twenty of the 40 senators elected every

spring are graduates. Unfortunately,
few candidates ever appear on the bal
lot since most are unaware of the filing 1
deadline in the winter quarter. As a
result some graduate senators won
their seats with as few as three write-

in votes. Additionally, while no graduates
have served on the Council of Presidents in
recent memory, they would be welcome to
run for office. Students would be well
served by a COP that had some graduate
representation.
Second, all students are welcome to
attend committee meetings of the Sen-

ate. While students cannot

chair these commit-

tees, they

can par
ticipate
if they

are in
terest-
ed in

issues that these committees cover. Two
examples are the Student Affairs Commit
tee and the Education, Research and Resi
dences Committee. As one example, the
Student Affairs Committee will be work
ing with Vice Provost Mary Edmonds on
the budget-cutting process that will be
occurring in upcoming months. The Edu
cation, Research and Residences Commit
tee covers everything that its name indi
cates. While the ASSU may not directly
offer services in these areas, our standing
committees can help students to be heard
by the appropriate parts of the University
administration.
Last, graduate students can contact the
senate chair or any member of the senate
about any issues of concern including where
their ASSU fees go. We can try to introduce
you to others who share your views or
explain how the ASSU works and we are
willing to work with all students, graduate
or undergraduate. I am sympathetic to the
views of many students who believe that the
ASSU charges on their fee bills are too high.
This academic year, the student members
of the ASSU will hopefully make substan
tive changes in a special fee system that
works very badly at present.
Only through participation and voting,
however, will graduate students be able to
make the ASSU a better student organiza
tion. I welcome your inquiries on how you
can become involved.
