# Different attitudes, environments separate grads from undergrads
## Sanford Dickert 
### 
IN RECENT MONTHS, a number of people have
asked me asking why graduate students don't get
involved with issues on campus like undergradu
ates. After talking with various friends and col
leagues, I could only come up with two simple reasons
— differences in attitude and environment.
As an undergraduate, there often is an inherent
connection with life at .Stanford, fostered through a
myriad of experi-

ences in aca
demics, social

activities and
organizational activities During your four years of
maturing amongst your peers without the constant
oversight of Mom and I)ad, who wouldn't take advan
tage of the freedom to stretch your wings and tackle
issues that you normally might have? Why not take
advantage of the opportunity to "make a difference"
on the campus — make life better for people who
come to Stanford long after you've graduated? This
attitude — whether through selfless of self-serving
means — is what seems to drive many undergradu

ates. And why not? This is your alma mater and you
would like to look back and see that you made a dif
ference during your four years at the Farm But this
student activism usually tapers off just around the
time of graduation, when the decisions concerning the
real world begin to take shape.
But as graduate students, what motivation is
there to make a difference at the Farm? They just
left their four year undergraduate experience and
have been thrust amongst the creme de la creme of
colleges from across the world Their main goal is to
graduate with their degree — with minimal distrac
tion. Life at Stanford is essentially a deluge of
coursework, academic hurdles (like qualifying exams
and comprehensive exams) and long hours of
research and writing. What motivation is there for a
graduate student to have an interest in "getting
involved" when their time is severely limited? Why
should "getting involved" be considered a high pri
ority in their graduate life, when they are only here
for one purpose. And why would they want to make
a difference at the Farm? It isn't their alma mater.

This is what I mean by difference in attitude.
And then what does the University do to foster the
environment of life at Stanford? For undergraduates,
the University spends a tremendous proportion of its
student affairs resources guaranteeing a nurturing
environment for the four years of the undergraduate
experience. Consider the various orientation pro
grams, financial aid programs, dorm personnel, stu
dent groups and housing facilities that are available
for undergraduates.
And why shouldn't the University expend such
efforts? As future graduates, undergraduates are
potential income to the University in the long term —
especially as they grow older and more affluent But
as a graduate student, what is the motivation, mone
tarily, for the University to make life at Stanford eas
ier?
Graduate students are expected to be independent
adults — no need for special orientation or financial
aid programs It's "sink or swim" once you arrive at
Stanford And since a large number of the graduate
students who come in are short term masters' degree

students, the mam income generated by these stu
dents is only during their educational stay. As for
Ph.D. students, the income generated from them is
usually through grants and projects that they work
on during the course of their stay Rarely will the doc
torate feel an strong affinity toward Stanford after so
many long hours of research and frustration until
their final goal has been reached So why should the
University put any effort out to the graduate student
— whatever year they may be?
With such different attitudes and environments, it
is a wonder that any graduate student gets involved in
any of the issues on campus. But there are some of us
who enjoy getting involved — as much as others
enjoy volleyball and hiking and working out. There
are some of us who want to make a difference at the
University for future graduate students, but don't be
surprised at the majority's disinterest Would you
want to be involved given the disparity posed here 9
