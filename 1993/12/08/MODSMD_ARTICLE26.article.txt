## The 						joys of the season, giving the gift of guilt 
### 
}112 | better to give than to receive.
I Especially when you're giving to
.L someone with a really high limit
on their gold card. Someone whose guilt
quotient is so astronomical they will show
er you with platinum-plated affection.
Someone who'll really give 'til it hurts.
Ouch.
You have to love the holidays. The joy
that comes from making your Secret
Weasel show their love handles to the
dorm in a strip tease — all for a few nasty
candy canes. The holiday cheer spread by
giving generic cards to bazillions of your
most intimate friends, who you were
unwilling to walk across campus to see
over the last 11 months. The ecstasy of
receiving shipment after shipment of low
quality chocolate wrapped in toxic tinfoil.
You shouldn't have.

Gift giving should be banned. Cute lit
tle guinea pigs that die horrible deaths of
cruel intestinal maladies before the birth
day week is out. Light-up tulips in classy
glass vases on Valentine's Day. Green
and yellow Uncle Marty's Sneaker Barn
T-shirts from Aunt Lois bringing Christ
mas to new lows.
Late at night I wake up in a cold sweat
imagining the next vile hair accessory
coming my way. Another 6.4 ounces of
Tweed perfume for the olfactory
impaired? Another Bea Arthur, you're
fat-so-you'U-want-to-pull-it-over-your-
butt sweat-shirt in larger than life, disco
biscuit colors? Another damned reindeer
doll with the bean-Bag feet that everyone
and his Siamese twin seems to think is
"cute"?
It's the thought that counts.

Think again.
Receiving gifts as a child was always the
most traumatic experience. First, I had to
open them in front of everyone. Then, since
all a little girl could ever want was outdated,
oversized clothing, I had to try them on.
Lastly, I had to choke back the tears, utter
ing a heart-felt "It's lovely" — as visions of
being forced to wear this magenta mon
strosity to seventh grade shot down any
chance I had to maintain my sense of digni
ty during that awkward stage.
The gift that keeps giving.
And then came the whipped-cream
and-cherry-on-top ... I had to thank
them all. Two-sided thank you letters on
cat stationery which my mom rested her
coffee cup on for weeks after I put them
in her care. Painfully nice notes telling
Aunt Martha that I would forever cherish

the 10-pound votive candle she must've
painstakingly picked out with my history
of pyromania in mind.
Thank you's for every deformed
stuffed animal. Breast-pressing hugs for
every pair of underwear big enough for
me and my anvil collection. Appreciative
smiles for every five-dollar check from
Depression-era relatives who failed to
compensate for cost-of-living increases.
Really, it was nothing.
It's not that I don't love each and every
person who has given me a gift. Not that
I question their capacity for choosing just
the right Polska kielbasa and pungent
cheese basket. Not that I wouldn't give
them my first-born in return for their
mylar balloons, My-Grandparents-went
to-Nantucket-and-all- I-got-was-this
lousy-T-shirt shirts, and pig-nosed porce

lain dolls marking each of my last '21
birthdays.
I just hate the guilt. The guilt that
comes with getting something and sud
denly, out of the blue, owing someone.
Owing them a thank you. Owing them a
present in return. Owing them a night of
lustful passion before an important final.
No need for thanks.
Keep the $15 KMart gift certificates.
The rock-hard baked goods used to take
out my frustrations on innocent pedestri
ans two floors down. Even the wonderful
Kermit the Frog shoelace clips. Enough
guilt. Enough ulcers. How about a nice
phone call. A little bit of your spare time
A kiss on the cheek, perhaps.
Will that be cash or charge?
