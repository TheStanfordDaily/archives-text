# Bar codes replace checkout cards at Green
## 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Starting Dec. 13, students and faculty will
be able to check out books in Green Library
through an automated bar-code system that
will eliminate the necessity of filling out
checkout cards.
In an effort to finish bar-coding all the
books, the (ireen staff has set a mid-January
deadline for students and faculty to bring
their bar-codeless books to Green, according
to Virginia Miller, head of the loan division in
Green.
Students and faculty will receive notices
this month, asking them to bring their books
to the Green Loan Desk to be properly bar
coded. Pines will be charged to those students
and faculty who fail to meet this deadline.
"We would like everyone to make their best
effort to get it done within the month," Miller
said, adding that the library staff "will be
accommodating to special circumstances."
It is difficult to anticipate possible prob
lems that could arise from this large turnover

of books, Miller said, because "nothing of this
scope has occurred on campus, in terms of the
libraries."
"Tens of thousands of books are going to be
returned," she said.
The Green library staff is considering hir
ing extra workers to help with the bar-coding
during this one-month period.
Meyer Library, the Physics Library, the
Engineering Library, Falconer Biology
Library, the Swain Library of Chemistry and
Chemical Engineering, and the Math and
Computer Sciences Library have already
made the switch to the automated system.
But because these libraries have smaller col
lections, not as many books had to be turned
in for bar-coding.
The automated system at Green should
save time not only for the library patrons
checking out books, but also for the library
staff, Miller said. Many of the staff s routine
duties, such as manually typing overdue
notices, will be eliminated, leaving them free
to concentrate on completing the bar-coding.
The automated system will also allow stu

dents and faculty to check Socrates to find out
if a specific book has been checked out.
The bar-coding process began about four
years ago when the University purchased
Notis, a software program used for creating
this kind of automated system.
"Most of the major research libraries in the
country use Notis," said Catherine Tierney,
the manager of integrated library systems.
The foundation for the automated system was
built by creating a bibliographic file that
includes all the collections.
In the summer of 1992, the libraries began
the second stage of this process, by starting to
place a bar-code on every book. This was
accomplished by "existing staff who either
volunteered their time, or (did it as) part of
their existing tasks," said Joan Krasner, the
head of Green's access services.
Green conducted a survey early this quar
ter to determine if at least 80 percent of the
books that were being checked out had bar
codes. The positive results of this survey con
vinced the library staff to begin using the
automated bar-code system.
