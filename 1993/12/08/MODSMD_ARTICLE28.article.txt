# New sexual assault educator nearly selected
## 
### Nami Kim Staff writer 
Less than two weeks after losing its only
two staff members, the Cowell Sexual Assault
Information Resource Center is interviewing
candidates to fill the vacancy left by outreach
educator Caroline Mitchell.
According to Carol Pertofsky, director of
Cowell Student Health Center's Health Pro
motion Program, the outreach educator posi
tion — which is funded by an ASSU special-fee
request for the rest of this school year —
should be filled by the end of this week.
Mitchell, who chairs the search committee,
said she hopes the new replacement will be

ready to begin work in January.
The committee received 26 applications for
the position, five of which were chosen for
interviews Advertisements for the opening
were placed in both The Daily and the San
Francisco Chronicle.
Mitchell, who declined to name the five
finalists for the position, seemed satisfied with
the enthusiastic response, calling the appli
cant pool "diverse and really qualified."
Applicants include both men and women,
staff at other universities such as UC-Berke
ley, and people who are currently not affiliat
ed with any university, Mitchell said.
Responsibilities of the full-time position
include developing and coordinating educa

tional programs for the student community,
and managing the Sexual Assault Information
Resource Center.
The search committee is working quickly to
fill the vacant position despite speculation
about the program's vulnerability to budget
cuts.
"We're looking for someone who has quali
fications equal to [Mitchell'sl," Pertofsky said.
"She came in with a lot of experience with sex
ual assault and self-defense issues."
It is still uncertain how the vacancy left by
Fran Gibson, director of the Sexual Assault
Information Resource Center, will be filled.
Pertofsky has said that "options are being
explored."
