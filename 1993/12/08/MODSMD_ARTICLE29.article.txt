## 
### Nami Kim Staff writer 
The search committee for a
permanent director for the Office
of Multicultural Development has
finished accepting applications
from prospective candidates and
is well on its way to choosing a
director by January.
According to Political Science
Prof. Luis Fraga, the search
committee's chair, applications
for the post were accepted until
Nov. 19, after a widespread
search within the University.

The post was vacated by Sharon
Parker in May and is currently
being filled by Acting Director
Judith Little.
University President Gerhard
Casper and Provost Condoleezza
Rice will make the final decision
in naming the director, choosing
from a list of two to three top
applicants forwarded to them by
the committee.
In the interest of privacy,
Fraga was unwilling to divulge
the exact number of applicants for
the position.
Although the committee "did

not expect a very large amount of
applicants, the pool was very rich
in terms of both quality and num
ber," Fraga said.
The applicant pool will be nar
rowed down through two sets of
interviews, the first of which is
planned for sometime in the next
two weeks, he said.
Fraga said that news of the
open position was heavily circu
lated throughout campus. In addi
tion, possible questions and quali
fications for applicant interviews
were openly solicited in an
announcement in Campus

Report.
Using some of these sugges
tions, as well as the committee's
own criteria, Fraga said the group
has decided on several qualifica
tions for the post, including "what
the person's plans are for this
office, and how that fits in with
the current environment of fiscal
restructuring."
Little, who also submitted an
application, said she is seeking to
retain her current post because
"the position is challenging — it is
interesting, stimulating and
important."
