## Sheriff's office investigates unresponsiveness, misconduct 
### Andy Dworkin Julie Makinen Editorial staff 
The Santa Clara County Sheriffs De
partment is investigating charges that
the Stanford Department of Public Safe
ty is not responsive to complaints about
officer misconduct.
The county sheriffs Internal Affairs
division has launched two investiga
tions, one based on complaints brought
by Stanford Police officer James
Fitzhenry and one based on complaints
of Cindy Hensel, the wife of a former
Stanford officer.
"Basically, what they are investigat

ing is that the Stanford Police Depart
ment's not listening to the public," said
Sgt. Ken Kahn, a spokesman for the
Santa Clara County Sheriff.
Director of Public Safety Marvin Her
rington refused to comment on the
probes. "Personnel matters are confi
dential," Herrington said. "I can't dis
cuss them."
The Daily has obtained copies of a
complaint Hensel made to the Depart
ment of Public Safety and two grievance
letters Fitzhenry sent to the University.
The complaints stem from events that
happened last year and earlier this year.
Fitzhenry alleges that he was unfair
ly demoted, harassed by several superior

officers, treated unreasonably when he
requested sick leave and battered when
a sergeant poked his badge.
"I strongly protest the negative work
environment the (Stanford Department
of Public Safety I administration and su
pervision have created for me! I am tired
of being singled out, harassed, and dis
criminated against by incompetent and
malicious supervisory and administra
tive personnel" at the department,
Fitzhenry wrote in a Sept. 4 letter to
Keith Smith, the University's manager
of employee relations. Fitzhenry is seek
ing reinstatement and apologies.
