# County probes University police
## Sheriff's office investigates unresponsiveness, misconduct 
### Andy Dworkin Julie Makinen Editorial staff 
The Santa Clara County Sheriffs De
partment is investigating charges that
the Stanford Department of Public Safe
ty is not responsive to complaints about
officer misconduct.
The county sheriffs Internal Affairs
division has launched two investiga
tions, one based on complaints brought
by Stanford Police officer James
Fitzhenry and one based on complaints
of Cindy Hensel, the wife of a former
Stanford officer.
"Basically, what they are investigat

ing is that the Stanford Police Depart
ment's not listening to the public," said
Sgt. Ken Kahn, a spokesman for the
Santa Clara County Sheriff.
Director of Public Safety Marvin Her
rington refused to comment on the
probes. "Personnel matters are confi
dential," Herrington said. "I can't dis
cuss them."
The Daily has obtained copies of a
complaint Hensel made to the Depart
ment of Public Safety and two grievance
letters Fitzhenry sent to the University.
The complaints stem from events that
happened last year and earlier this year.
Fitzhenry alleges that he was unfair
ly demoted, harassed by several superior

officers, treated unreasonably when he
requested sick leave and battered when
a sergeant poked his badge.
"I strongly protest the negative work
environment the (Stanford Department
of Public Safety I administration and su
pervision have created for me! I am tired
of being singled out, harassed, and dis
criminated against by incompetent and
malicious supervisory and administra
tive personnel" at the department,
Fitzhenry wrote in a Sept. 4 letter to
Keith Smith, the University's manager
of employee relations. Fitzhenry is seek
ing reinstatement and apologies.
In the same letter, Fitzhenry
stated he believes that he was
demoted and harassed because he
testified on behalf of former Stan
ford Police officer Gregory
Hensel. Hensel was acquitted by
a jury in June of charges that he
stole a television set during a
police search in 1992.
Cindy Hensel, Gregory
Hensel's wife, has complained
that a Stanford Police officer
made inappropriate romantic
advances toward her, according
to the documents obtained by
The Daily. Hensel also charges, in
the documents, that an officer
improperly told members of her
family about the charges against
her husband and harassed her in
her campus workplace.
While she filed several com
plaints with Stanford Police
administrators, Hensel said she
feels they did not take her com
plaints seriously.
"The whole complaint was just
swept under the rug," Hensel
said. In the complaint currently
being reviewed, Hensel claims
she was discouraged from making
an initial complaint last year.
When she made a different com
plaint last spring, she says she
was told her complaint was
unfounded. She maintains that
her complaints were not properly
investigated.
In addition to the county
sheriffs investigation, the Uni
versity's Internal Audit Office
may investigate Hensel's com
plaints.
Hensel said she is refusing to
cooperate with the county inves
tigators because they are the
same officers who investigated
the charges of theft against her
husband. So, Hensel said, Direc

tor of Internal Audit Glen
Mueller told her that he might
open a University investigation,
since she was not cooperating
with the county investigation.
Mueller refused to comment
on his department's activities.
According to Sgt. Kahn, Inter
nal Affairs investigations usually
take about a month to complete.
University General Counsel
Michael Roster, who oversees the
Department of Public Safety, said
Stanford is awaiting the results of
the county investigation.
"We are using the Sheriffs
Department as an independent
source to investigate," said Ros
ter. "We thought an independent
review was appropriate."
Roster said the University has
been cooperating with the inves
tigation and stressed that such an
investigation was not out of the
ordinary.
"There is nothing unusual
about something like this occur
ring," said Roster. "Periodically,
there are problems in any depart
ment."
Fitzhenry has confirmed he
filed two grievances with the Uni
versity. He said yesterday that
the University has found against
one of his grievances, regarding
sick leave, "without ever inter
viewing me or other witnesses."
He said he has requested arbitra
tion for the matters presented in
the other grievance.
Fitzhenry said he has been
placed on paid administrative
leave and hasn't worked since
July 28. At that time, Fitzhenry
said, he was placed on disability
leave, although he said the medi
cal condition for which he was
put on leave was never explained
to him.
Fitzhenry said he has no idea
when his administrative leave
will end. "I was told it was pend
ing, but not what it was pending,"
he said.
