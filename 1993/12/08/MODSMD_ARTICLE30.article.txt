Soto, come home
Residents of Soto house are dismayed that, once again, their
precious concrete statue of a dog named Soto has disappeared.
According to Soto Resident Assistant Stacey Strong, residents
first noticed that the dog was gone Monday night.
Strong blamed the theft on the fact that the three-foot, 100-
pound statue had not been chained up this quarter, as it usually
is. The theft-deterring chains were not replaced after they were
removed during Wilbur's renovation this summer, she said.
Soto residents have "some prime suspects in mind," according
to Strong. But instead of going to the police for help, they plan to
get the dog back on their own terms. "Our plans are confidential,"
Strong said.
"Everybody is concerned about our dog," said freshman Mike
Hagen, a Soto resident who is heading up the group of determined
students on a mission to retrieve the hidden hound. He added that
many were upset and angry when they learned of the theft.

Cal student charged with Tree assault
Police will charge at least one UC-Berkeley student with
assault and battery for beating up Stanford's mascot during this
year's Big Game, Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said.
According to Niemeyer, there is enough photographic evidence
to accuse Leonard Michael Malo of Tree abuse when he appears in
court on Jan. 5, but not the four other UC-Berkeley students who
allegedly took part in the scuffle.
"We've got photos of him knocking the Tree down," Niemeyer
said "Other charges may be forthcoming."

New phone prefix on the way
Stanford will soon have a new phone prefix servicing the Med
ical Center, including patient telephone lines at Stanford Univer
sity Hospital and Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital.
The 498 prefix will be introduced in January by Communica
tion Services, which provides telephone service to the University,
Medical Center and on-campus student residences.
The new phone numbers will work the same as other campus
phone numbers that have the prefix 723, 725 or 497. When call
ing from a campus phone, the caller should dial the last five num
bers (8-0000). Off-campus caJlers should dial all seven numbers.
The new prefix may eventually serve phones outside the Medi
