## Evolving AIDS virus not so elusive to geneticists New technique allows researchers to keep track of changing HIV strains 
### Steve Balt Staff writer 
For humans, variety may be the spice
of life. However, for infectious viruses
and microorganisms, variety is more
than that — it's essential for survival.
In order to elude the immune systems
of their hosts, these invaders have
evolved into a diverse array of strains and
subtypes, which creates hefty obstacles
for the scientists who try to understand
their properties.
But researchers at Stanford now have
a tool to analyze that diversity quickly

and efficiently, simplifying the study of
agents such as HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS.
Eric Delwart, a postdoctoral fellow in
the laboratory of Microbiology and
Immunology Prof. James Mullins, devel
oped the technique as a way to measure
indirectly the genetic distance between
naturally occurring strains of HIV.
In the new procedure, known as het
eroduplex mobility analysis, or HMA,
researchers observe DNA molecules'
migration through a gel matrix under the
influence of an electric field.
The procedure relies on the ability of
two different strands of DNA to combine
with each other in a test tube, in a pro
cess resembling the closing of a zipper. If
the two pieces of DNA originate from dif
ferent sources, they will fit together
imperfectly, and the resulting "zipped
up" molecule will contain gaps and
imperfections.
Delwart found that the mismatched
pairs of DNA molecules acted in a curious
way.
Compared to their correctly paired
counterparts, these mismatched pairs or
"heteroduplexes" did not move through
the gel very swiftly.
The e;xtent of this "mobility shifting"
effect on a heteroduplex, Delwart found,
is directly related to the genetic differ
ence between the two molecules that
form it.
This analysis is performed with com
mon laboratory equipment and in most
instances eliminates the need for costly
and tedious processes such as DNA
sequencing of individual HIV subtypes.
And because it is a more rapid way to
characterize genetic variation, HMA may
assist scientists in designing vaccines
that are specific to viral subtypes found
in particular regions of the world.

Delwart and his colleagues have used
HMA to construct a genetic "family tree"
that maps the relationships between
samples of HIV obtained from around the
world. Their results correlate well with
the HIV subtypes that have been identi
fied through more extensive analysis.
"I HIV) is really quite a variable bag of
viruses that we just happen to call by the
same name," Delwart said.
The variation, however, is not as
extreme in regions such as Thailand and
India which have only recently experi

enced widespread HIV infection.
Vaccine therapy may be more promis
ing in these parts of the world. If success
ful, the vaccines could be modified for use
in populations with more varied HIV sub
types, such as the United States, western
Europe or Africa.
HMA is perfectly suited for the rapid
analysis of such diversity. "Strain varia
tion is really the most important problem
in vaccine design," Delwart said.
HMA may also be applied to examine
the course of HIV infection as it evolves

within a single individual.
"We want to know," Mullins said,
"whether early strains are more or less
important than later strains" in deter
mining the severity of infection.
Such queries into the progression of
AIDS benefit from the simplicity of the
HMA method. Eugene Shpaer, another
postdoctoral fellow working with Delwart
and Mullins, said he finds this clinical
application of the procedure particularly
