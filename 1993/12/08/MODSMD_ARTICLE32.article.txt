# 'Stacking' boosts TV channels, reception
## Wireless devices, cellular phones, pagers to improve in clarity 
### Christian Chabot 
A 200-channel cable TV con
nection may seem like all the
information transmission you'll
ever need. But two Stanford
researchers may change this idea
radically through their work in
broadcasting technology.
Representatives from several
major telecommunications and
venture capital firms gathered at
Stanford recently to hear Electri
cal Engineering Profs. Arogyswa
mi Paulraj and Thomas Kailath
explain the benefits of their new
broadcasting method, which
allows for clearer wireless recep
tion as well as a capacity to offer
more channels.
This development could hold a
significant impact on the way sig
nals are now delivered to anten
na-based TVs, radios, cellular
phones and other non-cabled,
"wireless" systems.
Currently, technologies such
as conventional phones, wired
paging systems and cable TV
which utilize direct cable connec
tions are considered superior to
wireless broadcasting — in both
the quality and quantity of infor
mation transmitted. In other
words, the older technology still
allows for more TV channels and
clearer reception than the wire
less versions, which constitutes
one main reason why cable TV
has reached roughly 60 percent
of the American TV audience and
continues to grow.
The researchers' innovations
in broadcasting technology may
both improve the information
density and quality of "wireless
systems," making them more
competitive with the directly
wired systems.
According to Paulraj, their
device, called a "decoding box,"
which would be located on the
receiver's roof next to the anten
na, would "expand bandwidth

delivered to a user within a ser
vice area by using multiple spa
tial channels."
This means that broadcasting
sources such as TV and radio sta
tions could fit many more trans
missions within the range of
available broadcasting frequen
cies.
In fact, several broadcast sig
nals can be "stacked" on top of
each other at a given point in the
broadcasting spectrum.
Paulraj demonstrated this by
broadcasting five different
sounds — two flat tones, two
music stat ions and a human voice
— from a single location, and
then listening to their reception
from five antennas clustered
together at a separate location.
Using conventional broadcasting
technologies, there was great
overlap between the sounds. All

five sounds were garbled and con
fused, and the reception was
dominated by the sound with the
greatest amplitude.
By using the decoding box,
however, Paulraj was able to
change the reception of each
antenna, enabling the five dis
tinct sounds that were initially
broadcast to be picked up. One by
one, each antennae may be tuned
to distinguish one of the original
sounds.
But in order for this new tech
nology to work, there would need
to be separate transmission tow
ers to send different signals, and
the home viewer would need a
special antenna to pick up and dif
ferentiate these signals.
This development would allow
the space between transmissions
in the broadcasting range to be
reduced, so that more channels

could fit into the VHF (Very High
Frequency) range, the clearer
end of the frequency spectrum.
It would also allow current
users in the lower quality UHF
(Ultra High Frequency) range to
shift to VHF broadcasts; the left
over "space" could then be sold
for new uses.
According to Donna Baranski-
VValker, an associate in the Office
of Technology Licensing who is
responsible for marketing the
technology, "One of the most
exciting and imaginative possibil
ities may be [this] relocation of
UHF transmissions into the VHF
range."
Increased broadcasting capaci
ty and quality will also prove crit
ical to the future of necessarily
handheld devices such as cellular
phones and wireless paging sys
tems in hospitals.
