# NASA to fund innovative aircraft research

NASA has recently announced that it will
give Stanford's Department of Aeronautics
and Astronautics $250,000 to support a new
graduate-level interdisciplinary program for
aircraft design.
The curriculum created by the grant will
be geared toward developing both civil and
military aeronautic applications. But the
emphasis will be placed on civil aeronautics
because of the declining military aviation
industry.
Aeronautics and Astronautics Prof. Ilan
Kroo said the grant will also work to help
maintain the United States' trade advantage
in the commercial aircraft industry. "Com
mercial aerospace is one of the few areas in

which this country has a net positive balance
of trade," he said.
Despite the industry's current success, he
said the theoretical base as well as the effi
cient integration of computers and other
technology could be improved by further
research.
"The research will focus primarily on . . .
how one designs an optimization of very
large, complex systems in an efficient way,"
Kroo said.
Stanford will receive an initial $50,000 to
develop a curriculum that integrates various
aspects of aircraft design, from aerodynamics
and electrical engineering to safety and regu
latory issues.
This will be followed by $'200,000 next
year to fund the research of several Ph.D.
students and four or five master's students

The program will expand on courses that
are already taught in the department. Design
in the areas of aerodynamics, controls and
structures will be integrated under one inter
disciplinary area.
The Mechanical Engineering and Opera
tions Research departments will also con
tribute to the program, which will be both
interdisciplinary and interdepartmental.
In addition, the program will also work
closely with the aircraft industry. The aircraft
design corporations Boeing and McDonnell
Douglas already fund some Stanford research
and are interested in the new program, even
though they do not fund it directly.
By working with the Stanford program,
Boeing and Douglas can offer advice about
practical industry applications for the
research.
