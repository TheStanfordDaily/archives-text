# Warp drive a Hollywood fantasy
## Star Trek Enterprise cannot defy Einstein 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
We were wondering about
Kythe feasibility of the techno
logical marvels on the "Star
Trek" show: warp drive, holo
decks, replicators and trans
porters. Are any of these things
possible ?
— Beams and Butt-head of Borg
A: We sure are eager little
Trek-beavers, aren't we?
Even were I endowed with the
intellectual gifts of Lieu-

tenant-Com
mander Data,
it would take
me 1.76 pages
of this publi-

cation to
address each
of these hypo
thetical mira
cles of tech
nology.

So, at the
risk of disappointing devoted
fans (as if. . .), I'm going to have
to limit my focus to just one:
warp drive.
For those of you whose TV
viewing hours have not been
graced by the voyages of the
starship Enterprise, my first
officer will briefly summarize
this imaginary innovation.
Number One — make it so.
Warp speed is portrayed in
the Star Trek series as being
faster than light. Devoted
Trekkers (as the convention
attending, live-long-and-pros
pering, parents'-basement
dwelling Trekkies of two
decades ago now prefer to be
called) can recite a polynomial
equation which converts warp
speeds into multiples of the
speed of light — making the
measure a sort of Mach to the
fourth-and-a-half power — but
that interests us very little.
Warp drive is what enables a
Star Trek ship to go Fast. Warp
settings usually vary between
One (which, relative to our
primitive trans-Atlantic aircraft
and orbital shuttles, is still Pret
ty Fast) to the rarely employed,
engine-rattling Nine Point
Something, which is Really,
Really Fast.
The question before the Klin
gon High Council, then, is this:
"Can one construct an engine
that would propel a ship faster
than the speed oflight?"
The answer? As the omni
scient and ever-sarcastic Q

might quip: "No, you puny pri
mate."
See, about a century ago, a
very smart man named A 1 Ein
stein produced a few very inter
esting results. For our purposes,
the most significant among
these was the observation that
light travels at the same velocity
with respect to any moving
body.
This means that if you are
traveling at 25 percent the
speed of light away from a star,
the light from the star reaches
you not at 75 percent of its
usual velocity, but with the
same velocity

j
as if you were
standing still.
This
counter-intu
itive observa
tion has some
important
corollaries.
For one, a
person in a
spaceship

travelling past you at an appre
ciable fraction of the speed of
light (a so-called "relativistic
velocity") experiences less time
in one of your seconds than you
do. His mass, were you able to
measure it, would be larger than
if he were at rest. And his ship
would seem shorter, along the
direction of travel, than it would
if it were sitting in some celes
tial parking lot.
These contractions and
expansions of space, time and
mass grow larger as Spaceman
Spiff increases his speed. For
example, his mass (as measured
by you) would approach infinity
as his ship's velocity approached
the speed of light.
A spaceship accelerates
according to the principle that
for every action, there is an
equal but opposite reaction.
Throw some hot gas out the
back of your ship at some veloc
ity, and your ship gets a com
mensurate shove in the other
direction
This means that as a ship's
speed approaches light speed
and its mass with respect to a
stationary observer grows
toward infinity, the amount of
fuel it would have to expel to
accelerate would also grow
toward infinity
Since no ship can carry an
infinite amount of fuel, no ship
can accelerate to (not to men
tion past) the speed of light.


The Science Bug
Even if it could, Einstein's special
theory of relativity predicts rnind
numbingly paradoxical results:
Bodies travelling faster than light
would seem to move backwards in
time — not exactly a plus if the
Enterprise is rushing across the
galaxy to once again save civiliza

tion as we know it.
Hence, warp drive isn't just a
technical challenge, but rather a
scientific impossibility.
I'm not ruling out the possibil
ity (indeed, the probability) that
our species may one day find that
a few of its time-honored equa
tions are Dead Wrong. I might
even hope that the particular
equations in question have a few
wormholes — ah, loopholes.
"Engage."

ciable fraction of the speed of
light (a so-called "relativistic
velocity") experiences less time
in one of your seconds than you
do. His mass, were you able to
measure it, would be larger than
if he were at rest. And his ship
would seem shorter, along the
direction of travel, than it would
if it were sitting in some celes
tial parking lot.
These contractions and
expansions of space, time and
mass grow larger as Spaceman
Spiff increases his speed. For
example, his mass (as measured
by you) would approach infinity
as his ship's velocity approached
the speed of light.
A spaceship accelerates
according to the principle that
for every action, there is an
equal but opposite reaction.
Throw some hot gas out the
back of your ship at some veloc
ity, and your ship gets a com
mensurate shove in the other
direction
This means that as a ship's
speed approaches light speed
and its mass with respect to a
stationary observer grows
toward infinity, the amount of
fuel it would have to expel to
accelerate would also grow
toward infinity
Since no ship can carry an
infinite amount of fuel, no ship
can accelerate to (not to men
tion past) the speed of light.


The Science Bug
Even if it could, Einstein's special
theory of relativity predicts rnind
numbingly paradoxical results:
Bodies travelling faster than light
would seem to move backwards in
time — not exactly a plus if the
Enterprise is rushing across the
galaxy to once again save civiliza

tion as we know it.
Hence, warp drive isn't just a
technical challenge, but rather a
scientific impossibility.
I'm not ruling out the possibil
ity (indeed, the probability) that
our species may one day find that
a few of its time-honored equa
tions are Dead Wrong. I might
even hope that the particular
equations in question have a few
wormholes — ah, loopholes.
"Engage."
