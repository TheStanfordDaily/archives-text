## USC falls; UCLA next on spikers' NCAA journey 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volleyball team
took care of business as usual this week
end, only this time there was a little more
at stake than usual — its national cham
pionship hopes.
The Cardinal (22-6, 13-5 in the Pacific
10 Conference) downed No. 13 USC (22-
9, 11-7 in the Pac-10) in four games last
Saturday night at Maples Pavilion to
advance to the West Regionals in Los
Angeles next weekend.
"I thought we played fairly well,"
Shaw said "Coming up against an oppo
nent like USC in this round was not
exactly a pleasant experience and I
thought we did a good job preparing for
it."
While the USC attack managed to
penetrate the Stanford defense at times
throughout the night, the Cardinal's
exceptionally strong serving game left
the Trojans searching for consistency.
"It was definitely their night," said
Trojan coach Lisa Love. "They were darn
impressive from start to finish and we
had trouble getting any kind of rhythm.
When we did, we were good, but unfortu

nately we weren't in that rhythm often
enough."
The Trojans matched every Stanford
point throughout the first half of game
one, relying on a quick middle attack as
their main offensive weapon. As the Car
dinal offense began to warm up, however,
its outside attack proved too hefty for the
USC defense.
Breaking an even score of 11-11,
freshman Catherine Julliard served four
straight points to boost Stanford to a 15-
11 victory.
"We knew we had to serve tough
against them," said sophomore Cary
Wendell. "Especially since their middle
attack is so tough, we tried to throw off
their passing so they don't have that
option."
Stanford's serving onslaught contin
ued to confound the Trojan passing effort
in game two as Marnie Triefenbach's ser
vice ace propelled the Cardinal to an early
3-1 lead. Stanford held on to that early
margin, posing a fierce multi-faceted
attack which it extended to a 15-7 win.
While sophomores Wendy Hromadka
and Marnie Triefenbach attacked from
the right and the left, junior Anne Wicks
pounded the middle to keep the Trojans

off balance.
"Our depth was definitely a factor
tonight," Shaw said. "We had 11 players
in there which allowed us to continue at a
high intensity level with the focus that
we needed to have an advantage over a
team like USC."
The Trojans gained momentum in
game three, as there was no more than a
three-point spread between the teams at
any point in the contest. USC middle
blocker Yust provided the force
behind the Trojan comeback, not only
pounding a hole in the Stanford block but
also putting up a key stuff of her own.
Despite freshman Nikki Otto's strong
middle blocking effort and Wendell's
right-side rocket, the Cardinal was
unable to gain the crucial side-out and
came out two points short, 15-13.
"Part of the reason we struggled in
game three was that we lost track of our
game plan," Shaw said.
The Cardinal searched to re-establish
its successful pattern in game four, but
continued to flounder as USC took an
early 3-0 lead. The Trojans witnessed
their advantage dissipate quickly, howev-

er, as Wicks' long float serve initiat
ed a five-point scoring drive which
the Cardinal eventually extended
for 12 unanswered points.
"We were confident; it felt
good," liove said of the (JSC emo
tional level as the Trojans held the
lead. "Then I think they scored five
points in one rotation with some
tough serving but we weren't really
cracking the ball."
Stanford clearly rediscovered its
game plan as it was able to
strengthen its blocking while main
taining a cunning offensive effort.
As freshman middle blocker Eileen
Murfee secured the middle from
Trojan attack, Wendell slammed
down a hidden right-handed kill to
the center of the court.
"It was really important for us to
just stay relaxed," Wendell said.
"We started working a lot better
with each other and having a good
time by celebrating after we made
our plays."
From 40 feet behind the back
line, Wicks headed the Cardinal
serving game while senior setter

Piper Hahn's jump serve also kept
the Trojans guessing. Senior oppo
site hitter Heidi Kick provided a key
block which boosted the Cardinal to
an eventual 15-5 win.
"I think that serving has been
one of our strengths all year long,"
Shaw said. "We've been able to
serve accurately and mix it up with
jump serves and long serves, we're
able to do a lot of different kinds."
While the Stanford victory
hinged on its serves, the Cardinal
also achieved its other goal —
shutting down USC's traditionally
powerful middle attack. Stanford
kept both Meika Wagner and Yust,
USC's two strongest forces in the
middle, to relatively low hitting
percentages. Wagner finished the
match at .138 with 12 kills while
Yust was contained at a .200 mark
with eight kills.
Sophomore outside hitter
Kelly Kuebler spearheaded the
Trojan offense with 21 kills for a
.318 percentage while senior out
side hitter Katie Haller came
through for 14 kills at a .239 per
centage.
Wendell and Triefenbach guided
the Cardinal offense with 21 and 19
kills for percentages of .415 and
.226. Hromadka also supplied fuel

for the attack with 14 kills for a
.343 percentage. Triefenbach and
Hahn led Stanford defensively with
21 digs apiece while Wendell fin
ished an impressive match by
adding 18 digs.
"She's such a complete player
that she provides a lot of floor sta
bility whether she's serving or pass
ing or hitting," l>ove said of Wen
dell "She's a floor leader that you
can lean on."

The Cardinal will not only lean
on the talents of Wendell but the
entire Stanford squad as it faces
UCI.A this Friday at 6 p.m. The
Bruins swept New Mexico on Sun
day by a score of 15-8, 15-3, 15-6 to
guarantee their entry into the
Western Regionals. The Cardinal
will seek revenge on its conference
rivals after narrowly losing the fifth
game of both of its Bruin meetings
this season.

also achieved its other goal —
shutting down USC's traditionally
powerful middle attack. Stanford
kept both Meika Wagner and Yust,
USC's two strongest forces in the
middle, to relatively low hitting
percentages. Wagner finished the
match at .138 with 12 kills while
Yust was contained at a .200 mark
with eight kills.
Sophomore outside hitter
Kelly Kuebler spearheaded the
Trojan offense with 21 kills for a
.318 percentage while senior out
side hitter Katie Haller came
through for 14 kills at a .239 per
centage.
Wendell and Triefenbach guided
the Cardinal offense with 21 and 19
kills for percentages of .415 and
.226. Hromadka also supplied fuel

for the attack with 14 kills for a
.343 percentage. Triefenbach and
Hahn led Stanford defensively with
21 digs apiece while Wendell fin
ished an impressive match by
adding 18 digs.
"She's such a complete player
that she provides a lot of floor sta
bility whether she's serving or pass

can lean on."

The Cardinal will not only lean
on the talents of Wendell but the
entire Stanford squad as it faces
UCI.A this Friday at 6 p.m. The
Bruins swept New Mexico on Sun
day by a score of 15-8, 15-3, 15-6 to
guarantee their entry into the
Western Regionals. The Cardinal
will seek revenge on its conference
rivals after narrowly losing the fifth
game of both of its Bruin meetings
this season.
The Stanford women's volleyball team
took care of business as usual this week
end, only this time there was a little more
at stake than usual — its national cham
pionship hopes.
The Cardinal (22-6, 13-5 in the Pacific
10 Conference) downed No. 13 USC (22-
9, 11-7 in the Pac-10) in four games last
Saturday night at Maples Pavilion to
advance to the West Regionals in Los
Angeles next weekend.
"I thought we played fairly well,"
Shaw said "Coming up against an oppo
nent like USC in this round was not
exactly a pleasant experience and I
thought we did a good job preparing for
it."
While the USC attack managed to
penetrate the Stanford defense at times
throughout the night, the Cardinal's
exceptionally strong serving game left
the Trojans searching for consistency.
"It was definitely their night," said
Trojan coach Lisa Love. "They were darn
impressive from start to finish and we
had trouble getting any kind of rhythm.
When we did, we were good, but unfortu

nately we weren't in that rhythm often
enough."
The Trojans matched every Stanford
point throughout the first half of game
one, relying on a quick middle attack as
their main offensive weapon. As the Car
dinal offense began to warm up, however,
its outside attack proved too hefty for the
USC defense.
Breaking an even score of 11-11,
freshman Catherine Julliard served four
straight points to boost Stanford to a 15-
11 victory.
"We knew we had to serve tough
against them," said sophomore Cary
Wendell. "Especially since their middle
attack is so tough, we tried to throw off
their passing so they don't have that
option."
Stanford's serving onslaught contin
ued to confound the Trojan passing effort
in game two as Marnie Triefenbach's ser
vice ace propelled the Cardinal to an early
3-1 lead. Stanford held on to that early
margin, posing a fierce multi-faceted
attack which it extended to a 15-7 win.
While sophomores Wendy Hromadka
and Marnie Triefenbach attacked from
the right and the left, junior Anne Wicks
pounded the middle to keep the Trojans

off balance.
"Our depth was definitely a factor
tonight," Shaw said. "We had 11 players
in there which allowed us to continue at a
high intensity level with the focus that
we needed to have an advantage over a
team like USC."
The Trojans gained momentum in
game three, as there was no more than a
three-point spread between the teams at
any point in the contest. USC middle
blocker Yust provided the force
behind the Trojan comeback, not only
pounding a hole in the Stanford block but
also putting up a key stuff of her own.
Despite freshman Nikki Otto's strong
middle blocking effort and Wendell's
right-side rocket, the Cardinal was
unable to gain the crucial side-out and
came out two points short, 15-13.
"Part of the reason we struggled in
game three was that we lost track of our
game plan," Shaw said.
The Cardinal searched to re-establish
its successful pattern in game four, but
continued to flounder as USC took an
early 3-0 lead. The Trojans witnessed
their advantage dissipate quickly, howev-

er, as Wicks' long float serve initiat
ed a five-point scoring drive which
the Cardinal eventually extended
for 12 unanswered points.
"We were confident; it felt
good," liove said of the (JSC emo
tional level as the Trojans held the
lead. "Then I think they scored five
points in one rotation with some
tough serving but we weren't really
cracking the ball."
Stanford clearly rediscovered its
game plan as it was able to
strengthen its blocking while main
taining a cunning offensive effort.
As freshman middle blocker Eileen
Murfee secured the middle from
Trojan attack, Wendell slammed
down a hidden right-handed kill to
the center of the court.
"It was really important for us to
just stay relaxed," Wendell said.
"We started working a lot better
with each other and having a good
time by celebrating after we made
our plays."
From 40 feet behind the back
line, Wicks headed the Cardinal
serving game while senior setter

Piper Hahn's jump serve also kept
the Trojans guessing. Senior oppo
site hitter Heidi Kick provided a key
block which boosted the Cardinal to
an eventual 15-5 win.
"I think that serving has been
one of our strengths all year long,"
Shaw said. "We've been able to
serve accurately and mix it up with
jump serves and long serves, we're
able to do a lot of different kinds."
