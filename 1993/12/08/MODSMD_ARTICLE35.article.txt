## USC falls; UCLA next on spikers' NCAA journey 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volleyball team
took care of business as usual this week
end, only this time there was a little more
at stake than usual — its national cham
pionship hopes.
The Cardinal (22-6, 13-5 in the Pacific
10 Conference) downed No. 13 USC (22-
9, 11-7 in the Pac-10) in four games last
Saturday night at Maples Pavilion to
advance to the West Regionals in Los
Angeles next weekend.
"I thought we played fairly well,"
Shaw said "Coming up against an oppo
nent like USC in this round was not
exactly a pleasant experience and I
thought we did a good job preparing for
it."
While the USC attack managed to
penetrate the Stanford defense at times
throughout the night, the Cardinal's
exceptionally strong serving game left
the Trojans searching for consistency.
"It was definitely their night," said
Trojan coach Lisa Love. "They were darn
impressive from start to finish and we
had trouble getting any kind of rhythm.
When we did, we were good, but unfortu

nately we weren't in that rhythm often
enough."
The Trojans matched every Stanford
point throughout the first half of game
one, relying on a quick middle attack as
their main offensive weapon. As the Car
dinal offense began to warm up, however,
its outside attack proved too hefty for the
USC defense.
Breaking an even score of 11-11,
freshman Catherine Julliard served four
straight points to boost Stanford to a 15-
11 victory.
"We knew we had to serve tough
against them," said sophomore Cary
Wendell. "Especially since their middle
attack is so tough, we tried to throw off
their passing so they don't have that
option."
Stanford's serving onslaught contin
ued to confound the Trojan passing effort
in game two as Marnie Triefenbach's ser
vice ace propelled the Cardinal to an early
3-1 lead. Stanford held on to that early
margin, posing a fierce multi-faceted
attack which it extended to a 15-7 win.
While sophomores Wendy Hromadka
and Marnie Triefenbach attacked from
the right and the left, junior Anne Wicks
pounded the middle to keep the Trojans

off balance.
"Our depth was definitely a factor
tonight," Shaw said. "We had 11 players
in there which allowed us to continue at a
high intensity level with the focus that
we needed to have an advantage over a
team like USC."
The Trojans gained momentum in
game three, as there was no more than a
three-point spread between the teams at
any point in the contest. USC middle
blocker Yust provided the force
behind the Trojan comeback, not only
pounding a hole in the Stanford block but
also putting up a key stuff of her own.
Despite freshman Nikki Otto's strong
middle blocking effort and Wendell's
right-side rocket, the Cardinal was
unable to gain the crucial side-out and
came out two points short, 15-13.
"Part of the reason we struggled in
game three was that we lost track of our
game plan," Shaw said.
The Cardinal searched to re-establish
its successful pattern in game four, but
continued to flounder as USC took an
early 3-0 lead. The Trojans witnessed
their advantage dissipate quickly, howev-

win on Saturday was a strong passing game, which set up most of the Cardinal's 76 kills.
