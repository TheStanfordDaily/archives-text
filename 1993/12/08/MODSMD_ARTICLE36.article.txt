# Vols' late spurt downs Cardinal hoopsters
## Tennessee's 81-75 victory snaps Maples win streak 
### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
In dropping an 81-75 decision to Tennessee last
Friday night, the Cardinal women's basketball team
demonstrated that a full six points currently separate
the nation's No. 1 find No. 9 squads. However, Stan
ford also served notice that its chances of winning a
possible March or April rematch stand firmlv at 50-
50.
Paced by junior forward Nikki McCray's game
high 18 points and five scorers in double figures, the
Volunteers (3-0) justified their role as preseason
national title favorites by snapping Stanford's 34-
game Maples Pavilion winning streak before the
6,427 in attendance and a national television audi
ence.
But the Cardinal (1-2) rose to the occasion, playing
its finest game to date behind team-highs of 16 points
and six rebounds apiece from junior center Anita
Kaplan and junior forward Rachel Hemmer. While
Stanford trailed the entire evening after snatching a
4-3 lead two minutes into the game, it captured a
glance at a possible victory when Hemmer completed
a three-point play and a 14-6 Cardinal run that knot
ted the score at 50 with 13:06 remaining.
Intimidated by frenzied Cardinal partisans,
McCray subsequently committed a turnover to give
Stanford a chance to pull ahead, forcing Tennessee
coach Pat Summitt to call a timeout. The brief respite
revitalized Summitt's troops, and as play resumed
the Volunteers forced three consecutive Cardinal
turnovers, reeled off nine unanswered points and
never let their lead get smaller than the final margin
of six.
"We scored the next two baskets off our defense,
and that really opened the game up," Summitt said of
the tiebreaking sequence.
Hemmer also saw Tennessee's response to the tie
game as a turning point, and blamed herself for the
Cardinal's letdown.
"We hit 50-50 and relaxed," Hemmer said. "I
should have taken care of the ball better "
The Volunteers led by as many as 11 in the first
half and held a 38-32 halftime edge on the wings of a
rejuvenated outside game. With the Cardinal packing
all five defenders into the key to stop Tennessee's
inside threats of 6-foot-6-inch junior center Vonda


Curtis Chen â€” Daily
Junior guard Kate Paye pounds into Tennessee's defense, knocking over a Volunteer on her way to the
hoop. Paye scored 12 points in Stanford's 80-74 loss.
Ward and 6-foot-2-inch junior for
ward Dana Johnson, the Vols
reversed a season-long, l-for-20
three-point skein with two treys
each from senior guard Nikki
Caldwell and sophomore reserve
Michelle Marciniak.
Responding to Tennessee's
61.5 percent shooting in the first
stanza, the Cardinal returned to

its normal man-to-man scheme
after intermission. Yet with Hem
mer playing the entire second half
with three fouls and Kaplan tied
up with Ward, Johnson enjoyed a
personal 7-0 run, bringing the
score to 59-50. She would tally
nine points on the period.
While the Cardinal may not yet
have the leadership or the experi
ence to beat a team like Ten
nessee, the game provided a
chance for Stanford's players to
learn what it will take to win
should the teams meet in postsea

son play.
The more immediate challenge
for the Cardinal, however, lies in
its five nonconference games tak
ing place over winter break. All
games will be broadcast on KZSU
(90.1 FM), with Marc Oppen
heimer on play-by-play and Scott
