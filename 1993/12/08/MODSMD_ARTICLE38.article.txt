### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
The Stanford wrestling team headed
to the Las Vegas Invitational this past
weekend looking for some experience.
They returned with what head coach
Chris Horpel called "two preseason All-
Americans" and increased promise for
the remaining season
The Cardinal (2-2 in dual meet com

petition) placed 23rd out of a very com
petitive array of 38 top-ranked schools,
such as No. 2 Oklahoma State, third
ranked lowa and No. 5 Oregon State.
The performance was the Cardinal's
first tournament outing after four dual
meets in the past month.
Out of the 10 starters who competed,
seven of them won at least one match in
their weight division. "This is a sign
that things are looking good," said Hor

pel.
Two of the Cardinal wrestlers, junior
Jay Jackson (134 lbs.) and sophomore
Jimmy Aguirre (142), placed in the top
eight in their weight divisions. Because
of the tremendous competition of the
tournament, Horpel believes placing at
this level equates to being an AU-Amer
ican at this stage of the season.
Jackson, seeded fifth in the field
of 35 wrestlers, began the tourna
ment by beating Dale Hanover of
Cal Poly by a fall in four minutes,
17 seconds. After another win, he
lost to fourth-seeded Derek Moun
tsier in the quarterfinals. In this
match he reaggravated a neck
injury that caused Horpel to forfeit
Jackson's final match. Jackson fin
ished sixth in his weight division.
Twelfth-seeded Aguirre was also
busy advancing through the tour
nament brackets. He won his first
match against Ryan Lord of Wis
consin, and then beat Brigham
Young's Don Vantessell to reach
the quarterfinals. He entered the
consolation bracket when he lost to
Kenny Liddell of Missouri, who
was fourth at NCAAs last year.

Aguirre finished seventh in his
division.

Five other Cardinal wrestlers
came away with at least one win.
Twelfth-seeded Lance Johnson
(150) won his match by technical fall
after accruing 18 points against his
scoreless opponent. He advanced to
wrestle defending Pacific 10 Confer
ence champion Jake Gaeir of Cal
Poly. He lost the match 4-1 after
attempting several takedowns.
Freshman Scott Chapman (158)
beat Mogan Robertson from BYU,
8-7. He went on to lose to second
seeded Sean Bormet of Michigan by
a fall in 6:38. Bormet went on to
win the weight division, while
Chapman had one victory and one
loss in the consolation bracket.
Finishing in the top three were
Oklahoma State, Oregon State and
lowa. The Cardinal, finishing 23rd,
beat three ranked teams.
The Cardinal will wrestle next
at the Oregon Classic on Dec. 29.
