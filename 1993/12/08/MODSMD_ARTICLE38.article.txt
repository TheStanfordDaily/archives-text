### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
The Stanford wrestling team headed
to the Las Vegas Invitational this past
weekend looking for some experience.
They returned with what head coach
Chris Horpel called "two preseason All-
Americans" and increased promise for
the remaining season
The Cardinal (2-2 in dual meet com

petition) placed 23rd out of a very com
petitive array of 38 top-ranked schools,
such as No. 2 Oklahoma State, third
ranked lowa and No. 5 Oregon State.
The performance was the Cardinal's
first tournament outing after four dual
meets in the past month.
Out of the 10 starters who competed,
seven of them won at least one match in
their weight division. "This is a sign
that things are looking good," said Hor

pel.
Two of the Cardinal wrestlers, junior
Jay Jackson (134 lbs.) and sophomore
Jimmy Aguirre (142), placed in the top
eight in their weight divisions. Because
of the tremendous competition of the
tournament, Horpel believes placing at
this level equates to being an AU-Amer
ican at this stage of the season.
