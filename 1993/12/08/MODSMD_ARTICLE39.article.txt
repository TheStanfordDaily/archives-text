at the three-day Sp<Â»edo Cup held

Beach, Calif.
And they did it without scoring
one women's point.
Competing against many non
conference schools, the Cardinal
men dominated the meet The
men scored 1,010 points, 600
more than runner-up UC-Santa
Barbara.
Coach Skip Kenney was happy
with his team's performances and
spiritedness at the championship
format meet
"I'm really pleased. We got

everything we wanted," Kenney
said "We had great team enthusi
asm and the upperclassmen did a
lot of teaching to the freshmen. It
was a great trip."
The top performance of the
meet was turned in by junior
Kurt Grote, who set a Stanford
record in winning the 200 breast
stroke in a time of one minute,
55.54 seconds. The time took
more than a second off his previ
ous best time and eclipsed the old
Stanford mark, held by Olympian
John Moffet.
Grote, who shaved for the
meet in an attempt to qualify for
the NCAA Championships in
March, said he was aware that he

was on a blistering pace.
"I was feeling like I was going
pretty fast," Grote said. "I was
racing my own race because the
field was about six seconds
behind. I knew I had broken the
record when I saw my time."
Grote, who also made his
NCAA cut in winning the 100
breaststroke, is looking for
ward to training with Stan
ford's outstanding breaststro
kers and scoring big points at
NCAAs.
"My goals are for the group
that I swim with," he said. "We
could have four people in the
finals (at NCAAs) and score huge
points for the team."
Other Cardinal swimmers who
qualified for NCAAs were Brian
Retterer in the 100 and 200 back
stroke and J.J. Freitag in the 100
and 200 breaststroke. Derek
Weatherford and Joe Hudepohl
each won two races.
