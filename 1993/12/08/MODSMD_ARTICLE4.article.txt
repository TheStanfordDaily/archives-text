# Vietnam revisited
## Stockdale to visit Hanoi for first time since 8-year imprisonment 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Retired Vice Adm. James
Stockdale, the highest ranking
prisoner of war during the Viet
nam War, will return to the
area later this month for the
first time since his eight-year
imprisonment.
Stockdale, a senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution, will ac
company about 70 alumni on a
boat tour of the region, giving
lectures on the origins of the
war and his own experiences in
Vietnam.
Billed as an educational ex
perience, the 18-day "Stan
ford Indochina College" —
which is being organized by
the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion — will also include lec
tures from Charles Hill, a for
mer official at the American
embassy in Saigon, and Clark
Neher, a Stanford alumnus

and expert on Southeast Asian
politics.
"Vietnam is a growing
tourist destination," said Dun
can Beardsley, the director of
travel/study programs at the
Alumni Association.
"This trip is a good way for

alumni to see
the area with
an education
al aspect."
Beardsley
said trip par
ticipants were
attracted by
the unique
nature of the
trip "Many

have expressed general interest
in the area las well| as the poli
tics of Southeast Asia," he ex
plained.
At least one of the partici
pants has identified himself as


Stockdale
a former Vietnam POW, Beards
ley said.
The trip, which begins in Sin
gapore on Dec. 28, will include
visits to Phnom Pehn, Cambodia
and Ho Chi Minh City (formerly
Saigon), as well as a stop in
Hanoi
While in Hanoi, Stockdale and
the other tour participants may
visit the so-called "Hanoi Hilton,"
the infamous prison where Stock
dale was held as a POW for eight
years, four of them in solitary
confinement. Although the group
has definite plans to drive by the
site, they may not be able to enter
the building, which has been pur
chased by a Japanese group that
is planning to construct a hotel
there.
Stockdale was unavailable for
comment yesterday, but Beards
ley said he thought the former
POW, who was also the vice pres
idential candidate on Ross Perot's
failed ticket last year, would enjoy
visiting the site. "He's a strong
individual," Beardsley said. "He's
not vindictive toward the Viet
namese at all."
Stockdale has said previously
that he would like to meet some of
his jailers if he could find them.
Beardsley said that although
Stockdale has received a number
of offers to return to Vietnam, he
chose Stanford's trip because it
allowed him to go back as more of
a tourist "with his friends from
Stanford" and not on any sort of
official visit.
Stockdale, Hill and Neher will
be joined on the trip by their
wives, all of whom also have
strong interests in regional
issues. Stockdale's wife Sybil was
a major figure in the POW move
ment and wrote a book with her
husband on their experiences. All
participants in the trip were given
a copy of the Stockdales' book,
called "In Love and War," to read
before leaving.
Participants are paying
between $6,895 and $11,945 to go
on the trip, which is one of the 40
or so excursions the Alumni Asso
ciation organizes each year.
