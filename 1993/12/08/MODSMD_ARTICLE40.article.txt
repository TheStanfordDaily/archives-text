# Still perfect
## Men's hoops slips by UCR 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
In the true spirit of the holiday season, the
Stanford men's basketball squad nearly handed
UC-Riverside an early Christmas present.
The Cardinal (3-0) narrowly escaped an early
season upset last Sunday by hitting clutch shots
in the game's closing moments, squeaking out a
69-64 victory over a stubborn Highlander team at
Maples Pavilion. The outcome stayed undecided
until the final three and a half minutes, when
David Harbour hit four free throws and Brent
Williams and Andy Poppink each sank a jump
shot to seal the victory.
"We were very vulnerable to be beaten," said
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery. "Had we not
made the plays at the end, that would have been
our fate."
Thanks to some poor shooting by the Cardinal
(38.3 field goal percentage) and 20 Stanford
turnovers, Riverside (4-1) kept the game much
closer than anyone would have expected.
"You've got to give a tremendous amount of
credit to Riverside," Montgomery said. "They did
a far better job than I thought they could."
Only when crunch time approached did the
Cardinal raise its intensity level above River
side's. Along with its accurate shooting down the
stretch, Stanford's defense also stepped up a
notch, forcing the Highlanders to take some ill
advised shots.
"In the end, we kind of felt a sense of urgency,"
Poppink said. "We were expecting the game to be
blown open, and it never really happened."
After controlling the tempo in the first min
utes of the contest, it looked early on as if the
game might turn out to be a laugher for Stanford.
Fueled by Brevin Knight's explosive fast
breaking style, the Cardinal sprung to an 8-0 lead
over Riverside. The freshman point guard scored
two buckets on driving lay-ups and his dish-pass
to Poppink set up another two points during
Stanford's early scoring run against its Division
II opponent.
The Highlanders, on the other hand, got ofF to
a rather sluggish start.
"You're a little tentative," said Riverside coach
John Masi about facing a Division I team. "You're
a little in awe. You don't know what to expect."
However, having quickly adjusted to the unfa
miliar scenario, the Highlanders fought back and
kept pace with the Cardinal. Neither team held
more than a five-point advantage for the duration
of the contest.
In the upcoming weeks, Stanford's schedule
increases in difficulty as the squad prepares itself
for Pacific 10 Conference play in games all to be
broadcast on KZSU-FM (90.1). But come Jan
uary, the Stanford squad should be in high gear,
ready to tangle with its conference opponents.
