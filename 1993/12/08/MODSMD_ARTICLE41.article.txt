# That's Stanford, California — not Connecticut
## Uncovering the Eastern bias 
### 
This column is dedicated to
Stanford fans from the East who
are returning home for the first
time. . .
We're a West Coast nation,
hands down, from a
demographic perspective.
The population center of the
country lies well west of the Mis
sissippi. Ninety percent of U.S.
cities that have experienced popu
lation upswings since 1950 are in
the Western region of the coun
try. California itself is a popula
tion mammoth, home to two of
the country's five largest
metropolises and approximately
20 percent of the nation's elec
toral votes.
But as the old saying goes,
what is true in demographics isn't
always true in sports.
Or so proponents of the East
ern Bias Theory in intercollegiate
athletics would have you think.
The theory is simple — the
national media focuses the brunt
of its energies on Eastern college
sports. As a consequence, the
average college sports fan holds
teams from the East Coast in
higher esteem than their West
Coast counterparts.
Granted, this isn't quite as rev
olutionary as the Big Bang or
Natural Selection. Nevertheless,
the Eastern Bias argument has
attracted opinionated critics on
both sides of the fence.
I grew up a fully indoctrinated
Easterner. I adored Joe Paterno. I
scanned through NCAA lacrosse
results in the daily newspapers.
The Big East Conference held a
special place in my heart.

In my formative years of my
athletic fandom, I considered
Stanford the essence of Western
athletic mediocrity. In the 1980s,
no Pacific 10 Conference teams
won football or men's basketball
national titles. In the same two
sports, the Cardinal posted a 198-
206-2 record for the decade.

Even the school's mascot
seemed mediocre — the Cardinal
was a rip-off on Harvard's Crim
son more than anything else.
But what looks mediocre to a
New Yorker often shines in the
eyes of a Californian. West Coast
ers tout the Pac-10 as "The Con
ference of Champions," and have
numbers to back this statement.
Where Easterners cite recent
weaknesses in football and men's
basketball, fans out here allude to
different stats. Combining
records from all varsity sports,
Pac-10 schools have won more
men's and women's national
team titles than any other confer
ence in the nation. Period.
Stanford supporters are quick
to point out their part in that tra
dition. No school has won more
team titles since 1980 than ours.
Indeed, arguments on athletic
supremacy out here center on

which Pac-10 school has the most
dominant sports program in the
country. Western athletic superi
ority is taken for granted.
UCLA touts itself "The Best in
Collegiate Athletics" in its foot
ball press guide, proclaiming "no
school wins NCAA champi
onships with more frequency
than UCLA." USC's media guide
carries a similar message: "Trojan
teams have won more national
championships . . . than any other
university in the nation." Our
own football guide humbly deems
Stanford the "NCAA's Champion
of Champions."
Even by more objective jour
nalistic standards, the West
appears superior to the East. Last
year, six Pac-10 schools placed in
the USA Today Men's and
Women's All-Sports top 25. In
1991-92, the state of California
was home to 18 NCAA champi
ons, more than double the num
ber claimed by any other state.
Every year, I head East armed
with reams of pages making simi
lar claims. This Thanksgiving, my
head was stuffed with West Coast
athletic propaganda. Stanford
had won the 1993 NCAA water
polo title. Our women's soccer
team lost an extremely close
NCAA semifinal match. The Car
dinal women's volleyball squad
had been flirting with a No. 1
national ranking most of the sea
son.
But Easterners care not for
such trivialities. The topic of the
day on Thanksgiving? The decline
of the Pac-10 and the rise of the

Big East — as football confer
ences.
For the fourth straight year, I
spent half my vacation establish
ing the fact that I attend Stan
ford, and not Stamford (Conn.)
University. Once again, I was con
soled for suffering through a
mediocre football season.
Are Easterners inherently
biased against the athletic accom
plishments of West Coast schools?
Or do they merely look at sports
with a different perspective?
It all depends on who you talk
to.
