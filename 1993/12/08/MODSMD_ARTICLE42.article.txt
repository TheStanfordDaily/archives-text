# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
The standard format for the Daily's Ath
letes of the Week feature is to include two out
standing athletes — one male and one female.
But last weekend there were three Cardinal

stars who posted such incredible numbers tiiat
including only two would be a grave injustice to
the third.
Middle-relievers. Pass-rushing defensive
ends. In an era where the key word is special
ization and the phrase "great all-around play
er" has diminishing weight, Caiy Wendell Is a
refreshing change. For the women's volleyball
team, this sophomore from Arroyo Grande,
Calif., excels in all aspects of the g<une. She
averages over 12 digs, assists and kills per
match, creating the need for a new term, the
"triple dozen." Last week she was rewarded
for her consistency by being named to the
Pacific 10 All Conference Team, joining team
mate Mamie Triefenbach.
On Saturday night against USC, Wendell
dominated. From her position opposite the set
ter she recorded 21 kills on 41 swings. With
only four errors, her attacking percentage on
the night was an unbelievable .415. She also
accumulated 18 digs, eight assists and tossed
in an ace for good measure.

A walk through the Stanford men's swim
ming record book Is like a w;dk through the
Swimming Hall of Fame. Such Olympic stars

as Pablo Morales, Jeff Rouse and John Mof
fet jump out with just a cursory glance down
the Cardinal all-time fastest record book. To
these names, go ahead and add Kurt Grote.

This mild-mannered junior went to last
weekends' meet at Long Beach with one goal
— to make his cuts for the NCAA Champi
onships. Because of his training regimen dic
tates, he was one of the few Stanford swimmers
to shave for the meet and thus was able to set
such a lofty goal for so earty in the season.
Well, he qualified.
In fact, in the 200-hreaststroke Kurt went
ballistic, finishing in a time of 1 minute, 55.54
seconds, winning the race by four full sec
onds. Moreover, Grote shattered the Stan
ford all-time record in this event, held by
Olympian Moffet.

So the mantle passes from John Elway to
Steve Stenstrom to John Middlekauff. Okay,
maybe not. Middlekauffs been at Stanford
longer than Stenstrom.
Regardless, this doctorate student led his
Intramural football team, Rains East I, to a
convincing 45-13 victory over the Lumbering
Elephants in the Division I Championship
game on Sunday. With the arm of an Aikman
and the savvy of a Kosar, John picked apart
the Elephants' zone defense, passing for six
touchdowns and running for another.

The Steve Deßergof EM football, John ha.s
been quarterbacking the Rains team for six
years, bringing home the overall trophy for
the past two seasons.
