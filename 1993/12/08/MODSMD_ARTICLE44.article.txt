# Women swimmers victorious in Texas
## 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
It's now becoming apparent,
much to the chagrin of their oppo
nents, that the Stanford women's
swimming squad can beat anybody
— even when they don't really
want to.
Sure, the team thrives on com
petition, but at last weekend's
Speedo Classic tournament in
Austin, Texas, the Cardinal was
swimming head-to-head against
several teams that were rested,
shaved and ready to swim as fast as
they will all year.
And Stanford, still training and
working toward next spring's
NCAAs, managed to decimate the
competition anyway.
"It was really a successful week
end," said junior Becky Crowe of
the three-day, unscored tourney.
"We were swimming against three
Pacific 10 Conference teams that
had shaved. They didn't score the

meet, but if they would have we
would definitely have won."
The meet, formulated and car
ried out much like the NCAA
Tournament, showcased Stanford
and Texas, another national pow
erhouse. Ten teams took part in
the festivities, including UCLA,
Arizona, Arizona State, California
and Rice. The events spanned a
three-day period.
"It kind of took us a day or so to
get our momentum going," said
Crowe. "On Saturday we started
taking control of the meet, and by
Sunday we were totally dominat
ing."
Cardinal swimmers qualified
for that blessed day next spring in
a handful of events, including
Jenny Thompson in the 50
freestyle, 100 free, and 200 butter
fly. Thompson also won the 200
free, 200 I.M. and 100 fly events.
"It was a super meet, to find
ourselves this dominant this early
in the season," said Crowe. "It was
especially good to see the way we
improved as the weekend pro
gressed."
Senior Loveless placed first

in the 200 and 100 backstroke
with respective times of 1 minute,
55.74 seconds and 54.57 seconds,
and thereby also qualified for
NCAAs in both events.
"I had been training hard, and I
didn't really know what to expect,"
said Loveless. "Actually, the whole
team didn't know what to expect.
"This gives us confidence mov
ing on to the next step."
