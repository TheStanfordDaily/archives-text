# Fencers peel Banana Slugs with epee

### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
In what may be a foreshadowing of future
events, the Stanford women's fencing team
rolled to victory last weekend at UC-Santa
Cruz, while the Cardinal men's win was con
tingent on sizeable margins of victory in the
saber and epee categories.
With National Foil Team and Stanford
men's head coach Zoran Tulum returning
from Europe for the team's first conference
meet, the Cardinal men (2-0) traveled to Santa
Cruz (0-1) expecting to pull out an overall vic
tory even though substitutes would be forced
into action on their depleted foil squad.
Things went as expected. At the start, the
foil and saber squads fenced simultaneously.
The foil squad performed better than expect
ed, losing many of their matches 5-4, and sub
stitute Clark Bailey even pulled out one match
to give the Cardinal a 1-8 showing in the cate
gory.

"They came close to a big surprise," said
Tulum of this year's makeshift foil team.
The saber squad, however, evened up the
overall score against the perennially tough
Banana Slugs. They were victorious by an 8-1
margin, with sophomores Ed Jen and Shil
Sengupta going undefeated.
The two schools' identical 9-2 records going
into the final round of epee action appeared to
give Santa Cruz the advantage.
"Santa Cruz traditionally has a very good
epee squad. Their coach's specialty is epee,"
Tulum said.
But the Cardinal epee team would not be
outdone. Adrian Klein, playing out his fourth
year of eligibility, turned in a 3-0 perfor
mance. Junior Douglas Vanderbilt went 2-1,
and sophomore Errol Hunter won two out of
his three matches — his only loss coming in
sudden-death overtime.
The Cardinal women had a much easier
time this weekend, securing a comfortable 12-
4 victory, even while fencing substitutes in the

last several matches.
"We should have won by a larger margin,"
said Stanford women's head coach Sherry
Posthumus.
Sophomore Morgan Hoch led the Cardinal
women with a 3-1 record, and Anna Cummins,
Chloe Sladden and Stephanie Wien all turned
in 2-1 showings. Hoch's suffered just one
touch against her during her victories, but
still was not entirely content.
"I shouldn't have lost that one match, but
our team did well overall," Hoch said.
Despite the four Cardinal losses, Posthu
mus was encouraged by her team's showing.
"I feel pretty good about it (considering! that
Santa Cruz is usually the toughest team we
have to face," she stated.
"Unless Air Force surprises us, we should
be able to win our regionals," she added.
According to Hoch, "We have a really
strong women's team. We've been practicing
together since last year, we're young, and
we're strong."
