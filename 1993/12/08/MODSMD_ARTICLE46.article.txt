## Spartans frosted 
### Todd Bernstein Staff writer 
The Cardinal ice hockey
team posted two impressive
wins this past weekend against
San Jose State to keep their
Pacific Coast Hockey Associa
tion conference record perfect
at 6-0.
The squad jumped on the
Spartan defense early in Fri
day's game at the Golden Gate
Ice Arena. Center Luke Winter
found the net just 58 seconds
into the game, then came back
18 seconds later and fed left
winger Brian Browder, who put
the second Cardinal goal in the
net.
That proved to be the only
offense the Cardinal needed, as
goalie Bill Sutherland turned
away 21 of the 22 shots he
faced en route to a 9-1 Stanford
victory. The team poured on

the scoring, though, with
Shawn Sarbacker leading the
way with two goals and one
assist.
The only negative aspect of
Friday night's game occurred
in the second period, when
team captain Corey Sammons
was forced to leave the game in
the second period with a knee
injury. Sammons tore the adhe
sion that holds the knee carti
lage in place. He was forced to
miss Saturday night's game,
but should not be absent from
any further action.
On Saturday, the Sammon
less Cardinal got off to a slow
start before pulling away from
the pesky Spartans in the third
period on their way to a 7-3 vic
tory. The team held a slim one
goal lead heading in to the third
session, but outscored San Jose
St. 4-1 in the final 19 minutes of
the game.
Shawn Sarbacker led Stanford
with a goal and three assists. Kent
Saylor and Sean Morrison also con
tributed, adding two goals and one
goal and two assists, respectively.

The team is brimming with confi
dence at this point in the season.
After losing eight of their first 11
games, the team finally showed signs
of life in taking two important games
from California two weeks ago. With
this weekend's wins, the team
extended their winning streak to
four games and their record to 7-8.
The team's next competition will
be on Jan. 14 and 15 against Ari
zona.
