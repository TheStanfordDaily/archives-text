# Outsiders wreak havoc at party
## 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
A broken window, belligerent outsiders, and at
least one scuffle brought the Stanford Police on
Saturday night to Toyon Hall, where they had to
tell the crowd the party was over.
The incident began when several adolescents —
apparently from Palo Alto High School — began
causing trouble at the front door because moni
tors, who were checking for Stanford IDs, would
not let them in, according to senior Christina
Hong, a resident assistant at Toyon.
1 he high school students had apparently been
drinking before the party, according to Kyle Utsu
mi, another Toyon RA.
"The kids didn't receive alcohol at our party,"
Utsumi said, maintaining that monitors marked
those who were not of legal drinking age.
One Toyon RA notified police of the distur
bance shortly after midnight, said Stanford
Police ('apt. Raoul Niemeyer. Meanwhile, the
confrontation at the door escalated when one of
the outsiders reportedly attacked a Stanford stu
dent and broke one of the door's window panes,
according to Bobby Yeh, a sophomore who was at
the party.

The scene in the lobby and outside was chaotic
when police arrived. One freshman complained
that police went after Stanford students because
the instigators of the fighting, the outsiders, had
dispersed.
"There were like seven students from Palo Alto
High School and the police grabbed a Stanford stu
dent, and the guy who broke the window just
walked," said the Toyon resident, who asked not to
be identified.
Police were distracted by an additional incident
at the party. Responding to the disturbance call,
they received a call en route about a youth at the
party who was "semi-comatose" from drinking,
Niemeyer said.
The young man who was sick was apparently
with another group of non-Stanford students from
Monterey. While police were trying to help him,
one of his friends began to interfere, Niemeyer
said. "This guy kept getting in their faces," he said.
Police arrested the man, Daniel Garret, 19,
from Monterey, for interfering with police. Garret
was also charged with resisting arrest, as police
had to chase him down in order to apprehend him.
Utsumi said police told him the party was "out
of hand" and had to be shut down. RAs and police
proceeded to break up the party.
