# Education committee designates subgroups
## DRs, majors, teaching and 'academic environment' to come under scrutiny 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
The Commission on Undergraduate Edu
cation began to formulate subcommittees
last Friday that will examine several facets of
academic life at Stanford in greater detail.
The commission has tentatively designat
ed four separate subcommittees and is sched
uled to finalize its list of committees at its
meeting this Friday.
So far, the group is planning for subcom
mittees to examine distribution require
ments, majors, teaching methods and "acad
emic environment," a category that covers
undergraduate advising and residential edu
cation, said graduate student David Lowell, a
commission member.
The subcommittees, which are scheduled
to begin their work winter quarter, will serve
as working groups for the commission, giving
attention to the details of specific issues that
the commission believes are in need of change
but does not have time to examine for itself,
said commission member Geoffrey Cox, the

vice provost for institution
al planning.
The committees will
meet and report back to the
commission throughout
winter quarter before they
issue their final reports in
the spring. The commission
will continue to meet as
well.
History Prof. James

Sheehan, the commission's chair, said that
the "rich and complicated set of issues" the
commission will examine next quarter in
cludes the role of technology in teaching,
class size and "problems of governance,"
such as how to best represent undergraduate
education in the administration.
In addition, commission members will
"talk about what we should do that's new,
and look for innovations," Sheehan said.
Although the group already has an idea of
other areas to be looked at by subcommittees,
