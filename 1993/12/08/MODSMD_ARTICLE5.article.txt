# Education committee designates subgroups
## DRs, majors, teaching and 'academic environment' to come under scrutiny 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
The Commission on Undergraduate Edu
cation began to formulate subcommittees
last Friday that will examine several facets of
academic life at Stanford in greater detail.
The commission has tentatively designat
ed four separate subcommittees and is sched
uled to finalize its list of committees at its
meeting this Friday.
So far, the group is planning for subcom
mittees to examine distribution require
ments, majors, teaching methods and "acad
emic environment," a category that covers
undergraduate advising and residential edu
cation, said graduate student David Lowell, a
commission member.
The subcommittees, which are scheduled
to begin their work winter quarter, will serve
as working groups for the commission, giving
attention to the details of specific issues that
the commission believes are in need of change
but does not have time to examine for itself,
said commission member Geoffrey Cox, the

vice provost for institution
al planning.
The committees will
meet and report back to the
commission throughout
winter quarter before they
issue their final reports in
the spring. The commission
will continue to meet as
well.
History Prof. James

Sheehan, the commission's chair, said that
the "rich and complicated set of issues" the
commission will examine next quarter in
cludes the role of technology in teaching,
class size and "problems of governance,"
such as how to best represent undergraduate
education in the administration.
In addition, commission members will
"talk about what we should do that's new,
and look for innovations," Sheehan said.
Although the group already has an idea of
other areas to be looked at by subcommittees,


Cox
it did not finalize these at its
most recent meeting, according
to Cox.
"We spent the meeting talking
about two things: how many sub
committees there should be and
their draft charges. We did not
come up with a final list," he
said.
The problem, he said, is that
commission members are not cer
tain which of these smaller issues
— such as quantitative skills and
the language requirement —

should have their own subcom
mittee and which should simply
fail under the broader heading of
another subcommittee. The issue
of quantitative skills, for example,
could fall under the subcommit
tee that examines distribution
requirements.
For the most part, Cox said,
commission members seem to
think that the sub-groups should
examine more general topics.
"There's a sense that we ought to
have broad charges, because so
many of these topics are linked to
other areas," he said.
But at the same time, Cox said,
"There is a concern that we not
adopt current structures and take

them as given." In other words,
just because certain structures —
such as the distribution require
ments — exist now, does not
mean they have to exist in the
future.
As a result, Cox said commis
sion members feel that they must
address the right topics in order
to get a look at undergraduate
education as it really is.
"The questions we ask will
determine the outcome of the
report. There's a very important
sense that we have to have the
right set of questions," he said.
Friday's final list of subcom
mittees will also hopefully include
the members of each subcommit

tee, Sheehan said. Each sub
group will be chaired by a mem
ber of the commission and will be
made up of faculty members
appointed by the commission and
students appointed through the
ASSU.
"I hope we'll appoint (the
members] next week so they can
be ready to start working by the
first of January. The object is to
avoid losing momentum over
Christmas," Sheehan said.
But others are not so opti
mistic. "It's going to take longer
than this quarter |to set up the
committees!," said junior Luz
Herrera, another commission
member. "It's hard to appoint

people to committees when they
are not defined. . . . The group is
working well, but we need to clear
up some things about our func
tion. We're still in the planning
stages."
However, as the end of the
quarter approaches, Sheehan said
he is pleased with the work the
commission has accomplished so
far.
"This quarter, we clarified the
ground and next quarter we'll
begin to explore that ground," he
said.
Taken together, the fall and
winter will set "an empirical basis
for the spring, as we put things
together," he added.
