# Community unites for Kwanzaa celebration
## Group event highlights multiple aspects of African-American culture 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
The holiday season arrived
early for several Stanford stu
dents who celebrated an abbrevi

ated version of Kwanzaa — a
seven-day celebration of African
and African-American culture —
through music and dance in Kres
ge Auditorium Friday night.
Kwanzaa was established and

popularized in the '60s and '70s
by the Los Angeles group United
Slaves as a holiday celebration
that both draws from African tra
ditions and celebrates African-
American culture. Appropriately,
the event reflected the holidays of
several traditions and faiths,
including elements of the African
culture and traditional Christmas
celebrations.
Kwanzaa usually begins the
day after Christmas and lasts
through New Year's Day. Each
day of the holiday is devoted to
one of seven principles deemed
integral to African and African-
American communities: unity,
self-determination, collective
work and responsibility, coopera
tive economics, purpose, creativi
ty and faith.
These seven principles were
integrated into Friday's show
case, as speakers from several
campus groups and East Palo
Alto's Shule Mandela Academy
presented skits, poems, songs
and dance celebrating each prin
ciple to a mostly African-Ameri
can audience of about 100 peo
ple.
The two-hour program, spon
sored by the Black Student
Union, began as 20 members of
the Mandela Academy, clad in
traditional yellow and black Gha
nian clothing, led the audience in
"Lift Every Voice and Sing," a
hymn of the U.S. civil-rights
movement.
Omonike Weusi-Puryear, a
professor of African Studies at
DeAnza College, then spoke about
how she celebrates Kwanzaa,
which she described as "a time for
gift-giving from the heart."
Weusi-Puryear also defined
some key symbols of the Kwanzaa
celebration, including the red,
green and black candles which are
lit on successive days of the festi
val. The colors of the candles
stand for the blood of those who
died for freedom, the land and the
people of Africa.
While many African-Ameri
cans are familiar with Kwanzaa,
few of the audience members had
celebrated the holiday at home.
When Weusi-Puryear asked how
many people in the audience had
celebrated Kwanzaa, only a few
hands were raised. Not discour

aged, she remarked, "Well now 1
know I'm not preaching to the
choir."
When asked how she felt about
non-African-Americans celebrat
ing Kwanzaa in its traditional for
mat, Weusi-Puryear responded
that while she had invited only
African-Americans to her home
celebrations, she thought it would
be all right if those celebrating
were "living a part of the African-
American experience," for exam
ple if they were married to an
African-American.
According to sophomore Court
ney Myers, who coordinated the
program for the BSU, one of the
goals of the program was to show
people that Kwanzaa was "not
something that's mystical" but is
something that "espouses princi
ples that can only benefit people."
Myers added that she wanted to
stress that Kwanzaa and Christ
mas could both be celebrated.
"This year we tried to include
more of the Stanford communi
ty," Myers said. The Society of
Black Scientists and Engineers,
the Caribbean Students Associa
tion, the Stanford African Stu
dents Association, the Stanford
Gospel Choir and Kuumba, an
African-American dance group,
all played a part in the celebra
tion.
The Caribbean students read
poems representing many of the
Caribbean islands, including a
depiction of Haiti's misery.
Kuumba, named for the
kiswahili word for creativity, per
formed a traditional African
dance of welcome, a funga, while
accompanied by bongo drums and
occasional cries from the audience
and group members. The group,
consisting of about 15 women and
one man, danced both together
and in separate groups for about
10 minutes before leaving the
stage.
The Gospel Choir "rocked the
house," as one participant said,
with three spirituals, culminating
with the rousing medley "Stand
Up For Jesus."
The program ended with the
Mandela Academy leading the
audience in the African pledge to
"think African, speak African,
buy African, live African, be
African."
