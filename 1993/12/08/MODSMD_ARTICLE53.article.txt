# Christmas special retreads – for the '90s Ed Yoon
## 
### 
Now I know it's been rough getting
reacquainted with the core cur
riculum of Christmas specials,
what with finals and all. But here are some
synopses of some popular Christmas spe
cials specially retooled for the '90s:
Frosty the Snowman: A couple urban kids
make a snowman which magically ani
mates into their friend. Years pass and the
kids, now adults, charge Frosty while un
dergoing "recall hypnosis" with sexual mo
lestation. Frosty's career as a Christmas
special figure is ruined, even as the truth of
the charges is debated and he's forced to
cancel his world tour and go into hiding at
a British clinic for drug addiction.
The Grinch Who Stole Christmas: Whoville
is thrown into chaos as the Grinch rips off
everybody's Christmas toys and roast beast.
Saying that the holiday is too "Who-centric,"
the Grinch successfully fends off court bat
tles by saying that giving gifts and singing of
fends his Grinch-based religion, and that
stealing public roast beast is legal and pro
tected under the First Amendment.
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer:
Rudolph is kicked out of Santa's sleigh

team, then starts a lobbying group saying
that "red-nosed" is offensive and that it
should be called "proboscisally chal
lenged." Santa relents in the face of a pro
tracted court battle, giving Rudolph the top
spot in the team, leading some of the rein
deer to walk out, charging reverse discrim
ination. As Christmas approaches, the
president calls Santa, says he's disappointed
in him and makes him agree to binding ar
bitration right before the holiday season.
The Charlie Brown Christmas Special:
Charlie Brown purchases a pathetic-look
ing Christmas tree and brings it home, to
the ridicule of his friends. Linus, tired of
sucking on his thumb and clutching his
blanket like the co-dependent that he is,
embarks on an empowering exploration
of manhood that delves deep into his
pagan past. Beating drums and painting
himself in Marin, Linus coaxes the wimpy
bush to grow into a massive druidic tree,
explaining the importance of the men's

movement to Charlie Brown after sacrific
ing Sally.
The Sesame Street Christmas Special: Big
Bird decides to go up on the roof of an
apartment building to see how Santa gets
into those small chimneys. Using a video
camera, Big Bird captures it all on tape and
sells the copy for $50,000 to "Hard
and "A Current Affair." "Prime Time Live"
stages the Santa landing, and this comes to
light in a storm of controversy after Santa
sues ABC.
The Twelve Days of Christmas: As a
prince attempts to fulfill the gifts of the 12
days of Christmas for his true love, animal
rights protesters burst into his holding
pens and set free the French hens, turtle
doves, calling birds and partridge in a
pear tree. Further, Whole Foods market
protests over whether the maids injected
any sort of growth hormone into the
cows. As the prince attempts to answer

charges that the swans were used in
Revlon experiments, his girlfriend skips
out of town.
The Beavis & Butt-head Christmas Special:
When Beavis and Butt-head find that Santa
left two lumps of coal in their stockings,
they trek to the North Pole while beating up
small animals and roughing up some of the
elves. They set fire to Santa's toy factory,
and shave "Santa sucks" into his head while
making off with most of his AC / DC and
Nirvana CDs.
Holiday Festival on Ice: With Rush Lim
baugh. Rush spouts conservative commen
tary on homosexuals, white males and fem
inazis in moving duets with Kristi Yam
aguchi and Debbie Thomas. In an all-star
performance, Rush reads excerpts from his
best-selling works, "The Way Things
Ought To Be," and "See, I Told You So,"
while showing off his triple twists.
Yes, you might remember those
Christmas specials as being more
innocent and carefree, but this is a
new age with new sensibilities. Keep your eyes
out for the Heat Miser when you go home for
Christmas. And to all a good night. ■
