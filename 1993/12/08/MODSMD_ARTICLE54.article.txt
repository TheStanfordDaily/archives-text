Y 1 wonder how that would have
made me feel if I were Darryl Jenifer or Is
rael Joseph-I from the first thrash / -
reggae / funk / punk band around. After 16
years in the music business and nine albums
you would think their underground cult
status would begin to wear thin, and that
they would start to have sugarplum dreams
of selling out. But they don't. For Bad
Brains, popularity is, and always has been,
secondary to writing and playing the kind of
music they want to play.
"Rise," their latest album, is no exception to
the rule. With songs that range from slow reg
gae ("Yes Jah") to harsh, ear-splitting thrash
("Unidentified"), they continue to do their
own thing. For most bands the stylistic variety
of Bad Brains would mean record-sales sui
cide, but the East Coast band has the talent and
history to make an album as varied as "Electric
Ladyland" and still get away with it.
Bad Brains has always resisted musical cate
gorization, a trait many critics are calling revo
lutionary a decade and a half after the fact. But
the musicians themselves downplay this criti
cal praise. Jenifer, the band's original bassist,
puts it simply: "We came together as a band
who wanted to invent our own music and play
whatever we wanted to play, and for whatever
reasons at that period of time if that was un
precedented or people didn't do that, that's
that — but it's not like we sat down and said,
'We want to be this way.' "
Oscillation of musical styles is more than
just a belief the band shares, it helps to keep
them going — "it's chemistry," says Jenifer.
So what do they sound like? Imagine Bob
Marley, Queensryche, Living Colour, Fish
bone, The Sex Pistols, Metallica and Faith No
More all converging to make a sound that's Bad
Brains' alone.
But if the group is older than most bands
they sound like, how come Bad Brains isn't a
dorm-room name? Why aren't they playing to
sold-out arenas or touring in Lollapalooza like
many of their counterparts —bands who seem
to have bitten off their sound?
Instability.
During the time where they produced some
of their most solid records, the band was suf
fering inner turmoil. Longtime vocalist FI.R.
had artistic differences with the rest of the
band, and eventually left. "We've always had a
lot of offers to sign with major labels... [but ]
to move on you have to have stability because
it's a God vibe," says Jenifer matter-of-facdy,
without a hint of remorse or regret in his voice.
But by the time they were on their feet again,
some other bands seemed to have filled their
shoes. When asked how he feels about other
groups' overnight success, bands who toured
with and were influenced by the Brains, the
bassist answers seriously but lightheartedly:
" I feel that that's great... and I don't conskl
er it somebody 'biting off* of our sound. We
don't own the sound, only Jah owns the sound.
If they're inspired to sound a certain way, more
power to them, and I'm happy for them."
Pensively adding that "it's respect and success
in a way," Jenifer makes a good point: Bad Brains

is not out to compete with anyone, just to make
the type of music they have made for years.
After lots of hard work, Bad Brains has be
come an exception to the musical rule, making
their latest release "Rise" an outstanding
album. "Rise" is great not simply for its stylis
tic variety, but also for its musical consistency.
Tracks flow smoothly despite their differences.
The funk-based sounds of the reggae tune
"Yes Jah" dissolve easily into the sweet guitar of
"Take Your Time," which in turn compliments
the next track, a rhythmically moving, thrash
song called "Peace of Mind."
Rather then detracting from the album, this
near paradox proves that "Rise" is a collabora
tive work with true vision. Although the band
wrote several songs before settling on new vo
calist Joseph-1, they scrapped them to create a
whole new set of works, a set that's as solid as it
is original.
Even if the music can't be classified, can the
musicians? What are Dr. Know (guitar), Mack
ie (drums), Jenifer and Joseph-1 like?
Are they Rastafarians? With Joseph-Is
opinions on herb — "put 10 people in a room
and give them alcohol, and put 10 people in the
next room and give them ganja you're going to

... [see that] ganja is a positive force [and alco
hol is not]" — it might seem so.
Are they punk rockers? Lyrics like "check
out the government inject the innocent with
subliminal criminal vibes," and "you should all
be aware that a leader who fooled you and told
you lies to get elected rejected a civil rights bill
with skill" make a strong case.
But maybe the members of Bad Brains are
just musicians.
Once again falling away from traditional
motifs, Bad Brains brings both musical and
lyrical originality to "Rise." With a spiritual
backbone that can only be matched by Reggae
bands like ASWAD, and an aggressive anti-es
tablishment message, Bad Brains once again
smashes stereotypes without a second
thought. Israel speaks of the album's goal as
teaching through Jah, rather then trying to
compose certain types of tracks, because what
is "spiritual is what gives you happiness."
With a message of personal growth, songs like
"Take Your Time" and " Love Is The Answer" teach
a "preservation of the self, preservation of the spir
it," suggests Israel. "That's where you'll find truth,"
he adds thoughtfully. But the message is not always
as sweet and polite.

Other tracks like
"Free," one of the album's

best songs, preach that differ-

ences "bring us to the ground in a

system built for fools then mastered

by politricks," arguing that "what's right
for you could never be right for me."

So, while Bad Brains believes in one
world, they don't think that the one we live in is
it. "Like Christ say in the Bible," notes Israel,
" 'Jah don't need a house of gold and silver to
worship in,' look in your heart, worship God in
your heart."
He has a good point.
But is this hard-core quartet of socially
aware vegetarians simply P.C.? No. Just as no
one tells them what to play, no one tells Bad
Brains who to support. While they have done
benefit concerts for organizations like
NORML, they are not part of the Black Music
Coalition.
While Joseph-I believes that the BMC helps
out a lot of artists who wouldn't get a fair
chance at exposure without the group he
seemed almost disappointed at the question of
their support.
"1 can't go around blaming nobody for any
thing ... 1 deal with reality and 1 understand
the plight of Africans in this society ... but I
deal with Jah and I deal with loving everybody.
We don't try to say 'We're black musicians and
we're going to stick with black rock,' music
mon, everybody music, no 'black rock' or
'white rock.'"
Joseph-I stands up and walks over to his
saxophone case and removes his second musi
cal love. He rubs it with a cloth and continues
his lingering thought: "People need to look in
side and stop being so external."
When asked how the latest release differs
from past works, Joseph-I replies that "Every
thing has grown.... A good word is different.
If you keep painting the same picture, you keep
singing the same song, you keep writing the
same book — all you have is the same thing,
right?"
Jenifer agrees. "You've got to have inventive
ness ... everybody naturally is going to adapt
themselves to the times, but there can be in
ventiveness on top of that."
And "Rise" is an album filled with ingenu
ity. Even where tracks can be musically catego
rized, they all sound fresh and new. As hip to
the times as Bad Brains are, there's no recycling
here. Jenifer puts it plainly, "I don't want to
write songs that people are used to hearing."
But is such an attitude a savvy move in the
music business? Jenifer doesn't seem to care.
Bad Brains has stuck it out since before most
Stanford students entered elementary school, a
stamina that proves Jenifer's point: "If we sell
records, (record companies are] going to keep
on letting us do what we want to do."
Joseph-I concurs, but points out that sales is
not their goal. "It is a positive message, it is a
gift from Jah."
When asked whether he thinks they'll get this
gift while being so musically creative, Jenifer
leans over, saying thoughtfully with a smile, "if
we so happen to invent something ... then it
may take some vision to preserve that."
So, have a little vision. Go out with an open
mind, and give "Rise" a listen.
You too may agree with Jenifer when he says
that "God gave [him] a mission to be a musi
cian. ■

tic variety, but also for its musical consistency.
Tracks flow smoothly despite their differences.
The funk-based sounds of the reggae tune
"Yes Jah" dissolve easily into the sweet guitar of
"Take Your Time," which in turn compliments
the next track, a rhythmically moving, thrash
song called "Peace of Mind."
Rather then detracting from the album, this
near paradox proves that "Rise" is a collabora
tive work with true vision. Although the band
wrote several songs before settling on new vo
calist Joseph-1, they scrapped them to create a
whole new set of works, a set that's as solid as it
is original.
Even if the music can't be classified, can the
musicians? What are Dr. Know (guitar), Mack
ie (drums), Jenifer and Joseph-1 like?
Are they Rastafarians? With Joseph-Is
opinions on herb — "put 10 people in a room
and give them alcohol, and put 10 people in the
next room and give them ganja you're going to

... [see that] ganja is a positive force [and alco
hol is not]" — it might seem so.
Are they punk rockers? Lyrics like "check
out the government inject the innocent with
subliminal criminal vibes," and "you should all
be aware that a leader who fooled you and told
you lies to get elected rejected a civil rights bill
with skill" make a strong case.
But maybe the members of Bad Brains are
just musicians.
Once again falling away from traditional
motifs, Bad Brains brings both musical and
lyrical originality to "Rise." With a spiritual
backbone that can only be matched by Reggae
bands like ASWAD, and an aggressive anti-es
tablishment message, Bad Brains once again
smashes stereotypes without a second
thought. Israel speaks of the album's goal as
teaching through Jah, rather then trying to
compose certain types of tracks, because what
is "spiritual is what gives you happiness."
With a message of personal growth, songs like
"Take Your Time" and " Love Is The Answer" teach
a "preservation of the self, preservation of the spir
it," suggests Israel. "That's where you'll find truth,"
he adds thoughtfully. But the message is not always
as sweet and polite.

Other tracks like
"Free," one of the album's

best songs, preach that differ-

ences "bring us to the ground in a

system built for fools then mastered

by politricks," arguing that "what's right
for you could never be right for me."

So, while Bad Brains believes in one
world, they don't think that the one we live in is
it. "Like Christ say in the Bible," notes Israel,
" 'Jah don't need a house of gold and silver to
worship in,' look in your heart, worship God in
your heart."
He has a good point.
But is this hard-core quartet of socially
aware vegetarians simply P.C.? No. Just as no
one tells them what to play, no one tells Bad
Brains who to support. While they have done
benefit concerts for organizations like
NORML, they are not part of the Black Music
Coalition.
While Joseph-I believes that the BMC helps
out a lot of artists who wouldn't get a fair
chance at exposure without the group he
seemed almost disappointed at the question of
their support.
"1 can't go around blaming nobody for any
thing ... 1 deal with reality and 1 understand
the plight of Africans in this society ... but I
deal with Jah and I deal with loving everybody.
We don't try to say 'We're black musicians and
we're going to stick with black rock,' music
mon, everybody music, no 'black rock' or
'white rock.'"
Joseph-I stands up and walks over to his
saxophone case and removes his second musi
cal love. He rubs it with a cloth and continues
his lingering thought: "People need to look in
side and stop being so external."
When asked how the latest release differs
from past works, Joseph-I replies that "Every
thing has grown.... A good word is different.
If you keep painting the same picture, you keep
singing the same song, you keep writing the
same book — all you have is the same thing,
right?"
Jenifer agrees. "You've got to have inventive
ness ... everybody naturally is going to adapt
themselves to the times, but there can be in
ventiveness on top of that."
And "Rise" is an album filled with ingenu
ity. Even where tracks can be musically catego
rized, they all sound fresh and new. As hip to
the times as Bad Brains are, there's no recycling
here. Jenifer puts it plainly, "I don't want to
write songs that people are used to hearing."
But is such an attitude a savvy move in the
music business? Jenifer doesn't seem to care.
Bad Brains has stuck it out since before most
Stanford students entered elementary school, a
stamina that proves Jenifer's point: "If we sell
records, (record companies are] going to keep
on letting us do what we want to do."
Joseph-I concurs, but points out that sales is
not their goal. "It is a positive message, it is a
gift from Jah."
When asked whether he thinks they'll get this
gift while being so musically creative, Jenifer
leans over, saying thoughtfully with a smile, "if
we so happen to invent something ... then it
may take some vision to preserve that."
So, have a little vision. Go out with an open
mind, and give "Rise" a listen.
You too may agree with Jenifer when he says
that "God gave [him] a mission to be a musi
cian. ■

Y 1 wonder how that would have
made me feel if I were Darryl Jenifer or Is
rael Joseph-I from the first thrash / -
reggae / funk / punk band around. After 16
years in the music business and nine albums
you would think their underground cult
status would begin to wear thin, and that
they would start to have sugarplum dreams
of selling out. But they don't. For Bad
Brains, popularity is, and always has been,
secondary to writing and playing the kind of
music they want to play.
"Rise," their latest album, is no exception to
the rule. With songs that range from slow reg
gae ("Yes Jah") to harsh, ear-splitting thrash
("Unidentified"), they continue to do their
own thing. For most bands the stylistic variety
of Bad Brains would mean record-sales sui
cide, but the East Coast band has the talent and
history to make an album as varied as "Electric
Ladyland" and still get away with it.
Bad Brains has always resisted musical cate
gorization, a trait many critics are calling revo
lutionary a decade and a half after the fact. But
the musicians themselves downplay this criti
cal praise. Jenifer, the band's original bassist,
puts it simply: "We came together as a band
who wanted to invent our own music and play
whatever we wanted to play, and for whatever
reasons at that period of time if that was un
precedented or people didn't do that, that's
that — but it's not like we sat down and said,
'We want to be this way.' "
Oscillation of musical styles is more than
just a belief the band shares, it helps to keep
them going — "it's chemistry," says Jenifer.
So what do they sound like? Imagine Bob
Marley, Queensryche, Living Colour, Fish
bone, The Sex Pistols, Metallica and Faith No
More all converging to make a sound that's Bad
Brains' alone.
But if the group is older than most bands
they sound like, how come Bad Brains isn't a
dorm-room name? Why aren't they playing to
sold-out arenas or touring in Lollapalooza like
many of their counterparts —bands who seem
to have bitten off their sound?
Instability.
During the time where they produced some
of their most solid records, the band was suf
fering inner turmoil. Longtime vocalist FI.R.
had artistic differences with the rest of the
band, and eventually left. "We've always had a
lot of offers to sign with major labels... [but ]
to move on you have to have stability because
it's a God vibe," says Jenifer matter-of-facdy,
without a hint of remorse or regret in his voice.
But by the time they were on their feet again,
some other bands seemed to have filled their
shoes. When asked how he feels about other
groups' overnight success, bands who toured
with and were influenced by the Brains, the
bassist answers seriously but lightheartedly:
" I feel that that's great... and I don't conskl
er it somebody 'biting off* of our sound. We
don't own the sound, only Jah owns the sound.
If they're inspired to sound a certain way, more
power to them, and I'm happy for them."
Pensively adding that "it's respect and success
in a way," Jenifer makes a good point: Bad Brains

is not out to compete with anyone, just to make
the type of music they have made for years.
After lots of hard work, Bad Brains has be
come an exception to the musical rule, making
their latest release "Rise" an outstanding

side and stop being so external."
When asked how the latest release differs
from past works, Joseph-I replies that "Every
thing has grown.... A good word is different.
If you keep painting the same picture, you keep
singing the same song, you keep writing the
same book — all you have is the same thing,
right?"
Jenifer agrees. "You've got to have inventive
ness ... everybody naturally is going to adapt
themselves to the times, but there can be in
ventiveness on top of that."
And "Rise" is an album filled with ingenu
ity. Even where tracks can be musically catego
rized, they all sound fresh and new. As hip to
the times as Bad Brains are, there's no recycling
here. Jenifer puts it plainly, "I don't want to
write songs that people are used to hearing."
But is such an attitude a savvy move in the
music business? Jenifer doesn't seem to care.
Bad Brains has stuck it out since before most
Stanford students entered elementary school, a
stamina that proves Jenifer's point: "If we sell
records, (record companies are] going to keep
on letting us do what we want to do."
Joseph-I concurs, but points out that sales is
not their goal. "It is a positive message, it is a
gift from Jah."
When asked whether he thinks they'll get this
gift while being so musically creative, Jenifer
leans over, saying thoughtfully with a smile, "if
we so happen to invent something ... then it
may take some vision to preserve that."
So, have a little vision. Go out with an open
mind, and give "Rise" a listen.
You too may agree with Jenifer when he says
that "God gave [him] a mission to be a musi
cian. ■
