(Jf / ovv many people dream of
// /playing Tchaikovsky and
1,/ Prokofiev before a packed sym
phony hall?
How many people dream of performing
with Robin Williams?
Five Stanford students have the opportu
nity to do both, through the San Francisco
Symphony Youth Orchestra (SFSYO). Robin
Williams will be narrating Prokofiev's "Peter
and the Wolf," the classic children's story set
to unforgettable music, at Davies Symphony
Hall on Dec. 11 and 12.
Many of us remember the Disney movie
of "The Boy Who Cried Wolf," based upon
Prokofiev's work. Even more familiar is
Williams' animated familiar, the Genie, in
"Aladdin." The combination of the two
promises both auditory and visual excite
ment for participants and audience mem
bers alike.
The Youth Orchestra will certainly hold
up their end. "Peter and the Wolf" is one of
the staples of their annual holiday concert,
along with Christmas carols and a "tradi
tional sing-along." Fun for the whole family.
But don't make plans to attend unless you al
ready have access to some tickets. The con
cert sold out within hours of the announce
ment of Williams' participation. In fact, a
Saturday performance was added — in addi
tion to the two scheduled Sunday shows —
because of the huge demand.
This isn't all due to Williams, however.
The SFSYO has had fantastic success in all of
their ventures, including sell-outs of many of
their regular season concerts. They tour
"every three years or so," according to music
director and conductor, Alasdair Neale. Re
cently, they have been to Asia (1989) and Eu
rope (1992).
j 112 he SFSYO is a full orchestra,
— / with 105 musicians ranging
x from 12 to 20 years old. Obvi
ously, the five Stanford students fit in to the
elderly part of this age range. With two fresh
men (who are both 18) and three juniors (all
20), the Stanford contingent lends experi
ence to the orchestra.
The students' involvement, for the most
part, is a continuation of their high school
tenures. They commuted from Berkeley,
Oakland, San Mateo and Novato to be in one
of the most prestigious youth orchestras in
the nation. Yasmin Craig, a freshman violin
ist, had been involved in other area youth or
chestras when her instructor urged her to
audition for the SFSYO. "It was just the next
logical step," she recalls.
Chi Zhang, a percussionist and the other
freshman, took a slightly more circuitous

route. Zhang had been involved in the Hong
Kong Youth Orchestra, and soon after mov
ing to San Francisco went to Davies Sym
phony Hall to see if there was a local equiva
lent. "1 asked a security guard, and he intro
duced me to someone who gave me an appli
cation. Actually, 1 went to a concert of the
Youth Orchestra in Hong Kong [during their
Asian tour in 1989], not knowing that 1
would later be a member," he remembers
with a laugh.
At least one current Stanford student,
Steve Chen, was on that tour. Chen, a junior
violinist, has been involved in the SFSYO for
the longest span of any Stanford member:
this is his seventh season. He was involved in
both the Asian and the European tours. How
did they compare?
"The Asian tour was less tiring — it was
more relaxed. We had better hotels and more
shopping time. The European tour had more
cultural activities, but also more concerts."
The Asian tour was originally scheduled
to make a stop in mainland China, but be
cause of recent political tensions (including
the Tiananmen Square incident), those
shows were canceled. Instead, they toured
Singapore, Malaysia and of course Hong
Kong.
There were some complications on the
European tour, as well. "It was jinxed," jokes
Craig. "Our conductor was ill, so we began
the tour with a guest conductor — we just
got off on the wrong foot." Neale recovered,
however, and so did morale. The European
tour opened and closed in Spain, traveling to

Florence, Italy and the South of France in be
tween.

// n organization of the magni
/~i / tude and prestige of the Youth
< Orchestra takes commitment,
forcing students to give up some of the big
events on campus. The Big Game, for exam
ple. With four-hour rehearsals every Satur
day, it is rare for an orchestra member to
have the chance to see even one football
game.
Chen recalled his freshman year, when he
longed to go to the Big Game. "For about the
past three years, we've had our first concert
of the year on the weekend of the Big Game,
which means the dress rehearsal is that day.
So, my freshman year, I called in sick. They
called me back and told me not to show up
for the concert. 1 had an interview with the
orchestra manager and they threatened to
kick me out — they're very strict about re
hearsals, and especially dress rehearsals."
Obviously, a very professional organization.
Craig also regretted missing football
games. "As a freshman, it's one of the main
social events for the dorm. I still don't know
how it affected my relationship with others
in the dorm, 1 was really doing my own
thing." But was it worth it? "Definitely."
Now a new problem faces orchestra mem
bers: a concert and finals in the same week.
Near concert times, the orchestra practices
on some weekday evenings as well as the reg
ular Saturday rehearsals. This year the con

cert landed at the end of Dead Week, the pe
riod reserved as a time of relaxed social pres
sure before finals. Not for these dedicated
students.
Jennifer Grim, a junior flautist, feels the
pressure this time of year. "1 have two finals
on Monday, which is the day after this whole
weekend of concerts. I wouldn't give up this
orchestra even though we always have these
concerts the day before finals."
The Youth Orchestra provides students
the opportunity to play the classics, the
"standard repertoire" of the professional
symphonies. "Not every orchestra, not every
youth orchestra can do that repertoire," ac
cording to conductor Neale, "but we're a
good one."
When choosing pieces, Neale's first
thought is the kids. "1 select the repertoire
basically for the orchestra, some of whom
will be going on to music careers and others
which won't. I try to choose a standard
repertoire — big pieces which the orchestra
enjoys playing and which will challenge
them."
"It's a great experience," according to
Doug Tong, a junior who has played the clar
inet for twelve years and played with the or
chestra for four. "Especially for me, since I'm
not a music major. I don't have to go profes
sional to gain this experience, to play in
Davies Symphony Hall!"
// ctually, none of the Stanford
/~t / students involved are purely
t L/ music majors. Grim is a
music / psychology double major, and Craig
is planning on double majoring in music
and ... something else. "I don't know what
the other one will be yet," he admits.
This is Steve Chen's last season in the or
chestra — although the age limit of 20 is ex
tended for some hard-to-fill sections, there
are always plenty of violins ready to join.
Chen, a mechanical engineering / pre-med
student, plans on keeping up with his music
"just for fun."
Craig, in her fourth year in the orchestra,
has felt the pressure. She is considering
switching to viola to continue with the group
because "18 is about the limit for violins —
they seem to be in abundance. Strings are
typically four to six years younger than other
instruments — they seem to mature faster."
They wish it would never end. "For me,
personally," Grim relates, "when I'm on
stage performing in front of 3,000 people, I
totally forget about academics, I forget about
finals, papers, I forget about Stanford itself!
It's really hard sometimes when you get back
into that academic mode after a concert —• 1
just want to keep playing for ever and ever."
If music be the food of love, play on. ■
