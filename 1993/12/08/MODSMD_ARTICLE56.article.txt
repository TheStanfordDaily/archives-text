# Choreographed bliss — a Meeting of Modern Minds
## Story by Ed yoon Photos by Burt Nerman

modern — adj. 1. of, relating to, or char
acteristic of a period extending from a rele
vant remote past to the present time 2. in
volving recent techniques, methods, or ideas:
up-to-date.
dance — v.i. 1. to move one's feet or body,
or both, rhythmically in a pattern of steps,
esp. to the accompaniment of music. 2. to
leap, skip, etc., as from excitement or emo
tion; move nimbly or quickly. 3. to bob up
and down.
Through its myriad forms, modern dance
— however it may be defined — somehow
continues to make its humble home at Stan
ford, an institution renown for Pascal, prob
lem sets and protein folding rather than
pirouettes and split-leaps. Nevertheless, the
art manages to survive here, like some stub
born cliff shrub, thanks to those hardy few
who dare make it their calling.
For them, dance has offered moments of
self-discovery, intellectual and physical chal
lenges and, as in all art, the opportunity for
individual expression. Among these artists
are three individuals who, through separate
ways, have managed to develop their talent
on the Farm and ensure that Stanford's com
mitment to the arts remains intact.
THE PROFESSOR AS &ANCER
Stephanie Sc&aaf
Stephanie Schaaf, 26, is trying to put more
space between eight of her dancers as they lie
down on the wood floor of Roble Gym one

cold Friday evening. She lies with them, and
makes sure it looks OK — traumatic collisions
are not part of the performance — and she
also attempts to make sure the dancers can see
each other and can be seen by the audience.
She laughs and jokes with them, asking them
to come up with their own moves and com
bine various dance phrases together so the
performance comes together as a whole.
Easygoing appearances notwithstanding,
Schaaf says that her first teaching experiences
weren't so relaxing. "I was petrified," she says.
"I firmly believe just because you're a good
performer doesn't mean you know how to
teach that to someone."
Surprising words coming from someone
who has performed dozens of times in front
of audiences from the Big Apple to Seattle.
Schaaf started dancing at the tender age of
five, and began ballet training at the age of
eight at the prestigious School of American
Ballet in New York City, from whose ranks
the dancers for the New York City Ballet are
cultivated.
"I got in really young," says Schaaf, sitting
in the top floor of Tresidder in a moment of
repose, nursing a sore left shin. "They take
young people who have long legs and nice
feet and see what they can do with them."
Schaaf says she was one of those "guinea pigs"
and of 30 or so dancers who entered, within
two years she was the only one left. The
process was intense.
"People worked really hard — they just
worked," she says. "We were really young,
and there's so much self-judgment in dance.
Not just comparing who you're standing next
to, but comparing yourself with what you

think is possible.
"You can achieve a
certain amount and
feel good about
what you've ach
ieved, but there's al
ways still more. It's
great, but when
you're younger, you
haven't achieved all
that much, and it's
hard to always be
beating on your
self."
Soon came a mo
ment of decision
that would turn
Schaaf's career a
round. After several
years of training,
Schaaf was promot
ed to the next higher
division at the
school. However,
the evaluators noted
that she didn't have
enough turnout —

a term describing rotation of the hips, a trait
that is partly genetic — and that this would
become a greater concern as time went on.
Further, her promotion meant that she
would have to show up at school at 10:30 in
the morning, and she was already leaving
school early for ballet.
So Schaaf decided to opt out of ballet, re
turning to her New Jersey home and per
forming locally. By the time she entered Tufts
University, Schaaf didn't intend to focus on
dance. She says, "all the dance I did was ex
tracurricular. I studied English in college. We
ran a student group at school — we did what
we could, but it wasn't very good. But I didn't
realize how much, how desperately I was
going to miss it."
In college, Schaaf encountered modern
dance for the first time, and it was a hard
transition to make, possibly because of her
training in the old school. Nevertheless, once
she delved into it, she never looked back.
"There are a limited number of ways in
which you can move in ballet, and a lot of bal
let has to do with absence of weight — you
have to look weightless, ethereal," she says.
"(Modern dance) is a totally different physi
cality, a totally different reality of how you
move. There are just so many possibilities in
modern dance. I've found out much more of
myself and the way I want to move and the
things I want to do."
Like a true Stanford student, however,
Schaaf denied her dance calling and sought
the security of "a real job." But it didn't work.
"1 worked in a TV newsroom. You tell people
you have it and people go, 'ooh.' Everybody
wants the job, 1 should like it, but I didn't. I
kept trying to find things I loved as much as
dance and I couldn't."
So Schaaf moved to Seattle, dancing with
companies, learning, experimenting and
practicing, practicing, practicing. On the
side she painted apartments and did unin
spiring temp work. Managing not to wait
ress, however, was "a big accomplishment,"
she says.
Finally, after the leader of her dance com
pany left for teaching, Schaaf decided she
wanted to learn "how to teach, how to chore
ograph, and how to teach at a university." So
she applied to the Stanford School of Educa
tion, which offers a dance specialization.
"Most of the people in the School of Ed. don't
know about it, it's sort of the mystery pro
gram," she laughs.
Dispelling the mystery of dance in the uni
versity setting is important to Schaaf. "A lot
of people don't get it or don't understand it,
so they don't fund it, don't support it," she
says. "It's a struggle, and it's always going to
be a struggle, but it belongs here. I hate hav
ing to justify it in this way but to be able to
take a dance class is a highly intellectual ac
tivity. I think because it's physical, because

you don't talk, a lot of people in the system
don't see it as that."
In addition to fulfilling all the normal re
quirements for a master's in education,
Schaaf also must fulfill extra requirements:
taking classes in dance history, dance perfor
mance, dance in different cultures and chore
ography; teaching undergraduates in mod
ern dance and ballet. She also must prepare a
lecture at the end of the program and design
dance projects.
So what has the miniscule Stanford pro
gram — only one other person is currently
enrolled — taught? "A lot more courage than
1 had before," she says. "School's a much eas
ier place to get your feet wet teaching, chore
ographing."
Currently involved in designing a modern
dance project entitled "A Meeting of Dances"
with several other choreographers, Schaaf
knows that modern dance often scares off
folks because they feel that they just "don't get
it, they haven't nailed it down." For her, how
ever, the purpose of modern dance is simple.
" The beauty of it is that it's not to be nailed
down. It can mean 10 different things at once,
and you can take all of them with you. I just
hope people take it in and just get whatever they
get. Some choreographers set out with some
thing in mind, but you just catch what you can
and figure out what it means to you," she says

with a smile. "And don't worry about it."

TiONtAL CORPORATE LAH/EA
AS DANCER Alexis Tmn»er
Stanford senior Alexis Turner is practicing
a solo piece in room 42 of Roble, which is also
cold, even by mid-morning. With her lithe
figure, closely cropped red hair and leg
warmers, she seems to fit the idea of the par
adigmatic female dancer. She says she hasn't
practiced in about a week and apologizes be
forehand, as she selects a CD track from a
portable boom box. Her dance, now slow,
soft and stylized, then suddenly quick and
cat-like, seems infused with a personal ener
gy that Turner isn't afraid to ad mi*
"I think the very first bit of movement in
the show happened when I was walking up
Third Avenue in New York this summer and
I was thinking about my ex-boyfriend," she
says. ' And all of a sudden this gestural thing
started. Because I was in New York and it
didn't matter, I was walking down the street
doing this."
From this beginning Turner has tried to
fashion a piece, named after a poem by Adri

enne Rich, that has also seemed to create it
self. "It started off as my working out in my
mind what had been wrong in this one rela
tionship, but it ended up being my working
out my relationship with myself," she says.
"Of course the two are deeply intertwined.
It's about what I have to say about myself in
relation to others. It started very specific and
became very general, but very relevant."
As Turner began to see the dance develop,
it allowed her to consider what she was ad
dressing, and how she felt about it, which
wasn't easy. "Stepping away from the rela
tionship I was able to see the emotional posi
tion I had put myself in and I found that re
ally ridiculous, so I started to laugh at myself,
which is always a good thing for me," she
says, smiling. "So that's where I started with
the idea of it being humorous, and it was
great working that way because it allowed me
to get more personal. I had that comfort zone
— 'Oh, it's a joke, I can really do this.' Then I
came up with everything and started per
forming it, and maybe somewhere along the
way I forgot that it was a joke."
The tension between trying to impose a
conscious intent on the dance and letting run
its own field is one that Turner still struggles
with as a dancer and choreographer. She
mentions terms like "structure," "form,"
"function" and "process," trying to get at the
"rules" of the dance. "I thought there must be
some supreme way in doing it," she says. "It's
funny how much pressure there actually is to
work a certain way, and you need to go to the
studio and dance for 10 hours and see what
comes out."
As a Stanford undergraduate, Turner has
choreographed Ram's Head musicals includ
ing "Cabaret" and "West Side Story." Like
Schaaf, she studied ballet at an early age,
finding modern dance only in her freshman
year at Bryn Mawr.
As a freshman at 8.M., Turner was on the
pre-law track. "I was interested in interna
tional corporate law. After my freshman year
I decided I probably didn't want to do that. I
was thinking about doing some kind of art
major, and it was funny — I was trying to
think what I could do that I'd enjoy and make
time for dance as much as possible."
After transferring from Bryn Mawr to
Stanford, she decided to pursue modern
dance wholeheartedly, performing in
"Spring Migration," the annual performance
put on by the dance division. She also de
clared a major in drama, which has allowed
her to dance as much as she desires. She'll
also be designing a dance performance as
part of her senior project.
As for her future, Turner is intent on mak
ing the pilgrimage to the mecca of dance —
New York City — immediately post-gradua
tion. Last summer she danced there for two
weeks after completing a rigorous six-week

summer dance program at Harvard, and"l
became really comfortable there," she says.
Turner thinks she would also like to join a
dance company, and Europe offers interest
ing opportunities because of the substantial
financial support the arts receive there. But
she's flexible, and willing to tackle the va
garies of the dancing life. "There are a lot of
other things to experience," says the 20-year
old. "I'm still finding who I am and where I
am as a creative voice."

Clad in her black leather jacket and a ban
danna, sporting a rock-sized lapis lazuli ring,
Lea Wolf cuts a tough figure that doesn't stop
with the clothing. She talks rapidly, with a
dry sense of humor, and enjoys describing
how many times she was told that she didn't
have what it takes to be a dancer.
Now 23, Wolf dances professionally with
the Delia Davidson Dance Company in San
Francisco, where she makes her home. A
freshly minted Stanford graduate with a de
gree in Modern Thought and Literature,
Wolf pledged to herself late in her senior year
that she would audition for the Davidson
Dance Company and make it within five
years. Within a year she was accepted, and
since then she's been prancing, sidling, hop
ping, doin' her own thing and making her
livelihood quite happily.
Like so many others, Wolf started dance in
her wee years, but rapidly found ballet not to
be her forte. "When the teacher wasn't look
ing I'd sit and hang around and when he
looked at me I'd kick and dance furiously," she
says."And he'd say, 'My, you have such great
energy!' And all the other dancers gave me
these looks saying, 'You don't belong here.' "
Struggling through dance during those
early years, Wolf found herself to be "a big
fish in a small pond" when she wound her
way into Stanford. Modern dance immedi

ately became her route of expression, though
she didn't need class as an opportunity to
perform. "I'd dance in my room with the
music playing," she says.
On a bright Saturday afternoon in Room
33 of Roble Gym, Wolf carries a stack of cos
tumes — "1 made them myself over Thanks
giving," she declares — and they could be
hardly called demure. She's made them for
her dancers in a piece that will be part of
Schaaf's design project. As her hips rapidly
sidle this way and that, and with her dancers
crawling, rolling, falling on top, under and
over each other, it's hard to believe she's just
not doing this for the sake of a good time. She
emits yodels and happy yelps with gusto, and
it's infectious, setting the dancers leaping and
whooping shamelessly.
"You make a mockery of serious dance!"
says Wolf, feigning a finger-wagging tone.
After a dry run through the dance, she be
comes serious. "Maybe we should clean that
up, seeing as I didn't recognize what I saw,"
she says.
In a world where techniques can become
dogmas and aesthetic ideas easily transform
into aesthetic absolutes, Wolf has had to trash
numerous idols. Speaking of her dance class
es and advice given to her at Stanford, she
says that "some of it was good and I could
use, some of it I'd say you don't know what
you're talking about, and some of it was shit."
"I do a lot of improvisation," she says, and
it becomes clear that her dance involves
spontaneous, easy experimentation that lies
even on the edge of modern dance. Never
theless, its overridden by so much fun and joy
it's hard to resist. Turner sits on the side and
grins as though she were watching her chil
dren play in the sandbox.
"Someone called it very 'life-affirming,' "
Wolf says with a smirk. Caught up complete
ly in her frolicking, tongue-in-cheek moves,
it certainly seems true within her own life. ■

"A Meeting of Dances" will be performed Dec.
10 at 8 p.m. in the Roble Dance Studio. Admis
sion is free. For more information, call 723-1234.

she says.
In a world where techniques can become
dogmas and aesthetic ideas easily transform
into aesthetic absolutes, Wolf has had to trash
numerous idols. Speaking of her dance class
es and advice given to her at Stanford, she
says that "some of it was good and I could
use, some of it I'd say you don't know what
you're talking about, and some of it was shit."
"I do a lot of improvisation," she says, and
it becomes clear that her dance involves
spontaneous, easy experimentation that lies
even on the edge of modern dance. Never
theless, its overridden by so much fun and joy
it's hard to resist. Turner sits on the side and
grins as though she were watching her chil
dren play in the sandbox.
"Someone called it very 'life-affirming,' "
Wolf says with a smirk. Caught up complete
ly in her frolicking, tongue-in-cheek moves,
it certainly seems true within her own life. ■

"A Meeting of Dances" will be performed Dec.

THE PROFESSOR AS &ANCER
Stephanie Sc&aaf
Stephanie Schaaf, 26, is trying to put more
space between eight of her dancers as they lie
down on the wood floor of Roble Gym one

cold Friday evening. She lies with them, and
makes sure it looks OK — traumatic collisions
are not part of the performance — and she
also attempts to make sure the dancers can see
each other and can be seen by the audience.
She laughs and jokes with them, asking them
to come up with their own moves and com
bine various dance phrases together so the
performance comes together as a whole.
Easygoing appearances notwithstanding,
Schaaf says that her first teaching experiences
weren't so relaxing. "I was petrified," she says.
"I firmly believe just because you're a good
performer doesn't mean you know how to
teach that to someone."
Surprising words coming from someone
who has performed dozens of times in front
of audiences from the Big Apple to Seattle.
Schaaf started dancing at the tender age of
five, and began ballet training at the age of
eight at the prestigious School of American
Ballet in New York City, from whose ranks
the dancers for the New York City Ballet are
cultivated.
"I got in really young," says Schaaf, sitting
in the top floor of Tresidder in a moment of
repose, nursing a sore left shin. "They take
young people who have long legs and nice
feet and see what they can do with them."
Schaaf says she was one of those "guinea pigs"
and of 30 or so dancers who entered, within
two years she was the only one left. The
process was intense.
"People worked really hard — they just
worked," she says. "We were really young,
and there's so much self-judgment in dance.
Not just comparing who you're standing next
to, but comparing yourself with what you

think is possible.
"You can achieve a
certain amount and
feel good about
what you've ach
ieved, but there's al
ways still more. It's
great, but when
you're younger, you
haven't achieved all
that much, and it's
hard to always be
beating on your
self."
Soon came a mo
ment of decision
that would turn
Schaaf's career a
round. After several
years of training,
Schaaf was promot
ed to the next higher
division at the
school. However,
the evaluators noted
that she didn't have
enough turnout —

a term describing rotation of the hips, a trait
that is partly genetic — and that this would
become a greater concern as time went on.
Further, her promotion meant that she
would have to show up at school at 10:30 in
the morning, and she was already leaving
school early for ballet.
So Schaaf decided to opt out of ballet, re
turning to her New Jersey home and per
forming locally. By the time she entered Tufts
University, Schaaf didn't intend to focus on
dance. She says, "all the dance I did was ex
tracurricular. I studied English in college. We
ran a student group at school — we did what
we could, but it wasn't very good. But I didn't
realize how much, how desperately I was
going to miss it."
In college, Schaaf encountered modern
dance for the first time, and it was a hard
transition to make, possibly because of her
training in the old school. Nevertheless, once
she delved into it, she never looked back.
"There are a limited number of ways in
which you can move in ballet, and a lot of bal
let has to do with absence of weight — you
have to look weightless, ethereal," she says.
"(Modern dance) is a totally different physi
cality, a totally different reality of how you
move. There are just so many possibilities in
modern dance. I've found out much more of
myself and the way I want to move and the
things I want to do."
Like a true Stanford student, however,
Schaaf denied her dance calling and sought
the security of "a real job." But it didn't work.
"1 worked in a TV newsroom. You tell people
you have it and people go, 'ooh.' Everybody
wants the job, 1 should like it, but I didn't. I
kept trying to find things I loved as much as
dance and I couldn't."
So Schaaf moved to Seattle, dancing with
companies, learning, experimenting and
practicing, practicing, practicing. On the
side she painted apartments and did unin
spiring temp work. Managing not to wait
ress, however, was "a big accomplishment,"
she says.
Finally, after the leader of her dance com
pany left for teaching, Schaaf decided she
wanted to learn "how to teach, how to chore
ograph, and how to teach at a university." So
she applied to the Stanford School of Educa
tion, which offers a dance specialization.
"Most of the people in the School of Ed. don't
know about it, it's sort of the mystery pro
gram," she laughs.
Dispelling the mystery of dance in the uni
versity setting is important to Schaaf. "A lot
of people don't get it or don't understand it,
so they don't fund it, don't support it," she
says. "It's a struggle, and it's always going to
be a struggle, but it belongs here. I hate hav
ing to justify it in this way but to be able to
take a dance class is a highly intellectual ac
tivity. I think because it's physical, because

you don't talk, a lot of people in the system
don't see it as that."
In addition to fulfilling all the normal re
quirements for a master's in education,
Schaaf also must fulfill extra requirements:
taking classes in dance history, dance perfor
mance, dance in different cultures and chore
ography; teaching undergraduates in mod
ern dance and ballet. She also must prepare a
lecture at the end of the program and design
dance projects.
So what has the miniscule Stanford pro
gram — only one other person is currently
enrolled — taught? "A lot more courage than
1 had before," she says. "School's a much eas
ier place to get your feet wet teaching, chore
ographing."
Currently involved in designing a modern
dance project entitled "A Meeting of Dances"
with several other choreographers, Schaaf
knows that modern dance often scares off
folks because they feel that they just "don't get
it, they haven't nailed it down." For her, how
ever, the purpose of modern dance is simple.
" The beauty of it is that it's not to be nailed
down. It can mean 10 different things at once,
and you can take all of them with you. I just
hope people take it in and just get whatever they
get. Some choreographers set out with some
thing in mind, but you just catch what you can
and figure out what it means to you," she says

with a smile. "And don't worry about it."

TiONtAL CORPORATE LAH/EA
AS DANCER Alexis Tmn»er
Stanford senior Alexis Turner is practicing
a solo piece in room 42 of Roble, which is also
cold, even by mid-morning. With her lithe
figure, closely cropped red hair and leg
warmers, she seems to fit the idea of the par
adigmatic female dancer. She says she hasn't
practiced in about a week and apologizes be
forehand, as she selects a CD track from a
portable boom box. Her dance, now slow,
soft and stylized, then suddenly quick and
cat-like, seems infused with a personal ener
gy that Turner isn't afraid to ad mi*
"I think the very first bit of movement in
the show happened when I was walking up
Third Avenue in New York this summer and
I was thinking about my ex-boyfriend," she
says. ' And all of a sudden this gestural thing
started. Because I was in New York and it
didn't matter, I was walking down the street
doing this."
From this beginning Turner has tried to
fashion a piece, named after a poem by Adri

enne Rich, that has also seemed to create it
self. "It started off as my working out in my
mind what had been wrong in this one rela
tionship, but it ended up being my working
out my relationship with myself," she says.
"Of course the two are deeply intertwined.
It's about what I have to say about myself in
relation to others. It started very specific and
became very general, but very relevant."
As Turner began to see the dance develop,
it allowed her to consider what she was ad
dressing, and how she felt about it, which
wasn't easy. "Stepping away from the rela
tionship I was able to see the emotional posi
tion I had put myself in and I found that re
ally ridiculous, so I started to laugh at myself,
which is always a good thing for me," she
says, smiling. "So that's where I started with
the idea of it being humorous, and it was
great working that way because it allowed me
to get more personal. I had that comfort zone
— 'Oh, it's a joke, I can really do this.' Then I
came up with everything and started per
forming it, and maybe somewhere along the
way I forgot that it was a joke."
The tension between trying to impose a
conscious intent on the dance and letting run
its own field is one that Turner still struggles
with as a dancer and choreographer. She
mentions terms like "structure," "form,"
"function" and "process," trying to get at the
"rules" of the dance. "I thought there must be
some supreme way in doing it," she says. "It's
funny how much pressure there actually is to
work a certain way, and you need to go to the
studio and dance for 10 hours and see what
comes out."
As a Stanford undergraduate, Turner has
choreographed Ram's Head musicals includ
ing "Cabaret" and "West Side Story." Like
Schaaf, she studied ballet at an early age,
finding modern dance only in her freshman
year at Bryn Mawr.
As a freshman at 8.M., Turner was on the
pre-law track. "I was interested in interna
tional corporate law. After my freshman year
I decided I probably didn't want to do that. I
was thinking about doing some kind of art
major, and it was funny — I was trying to
think what I could do that I'd enjoy and make
time for dance as much as possible."
After transferring from Bryn Mawr to
Stanford, she decided to pursue modern
dance wholeheartedly, performing in
"Spring Migration," the annual performance
put on by the dance division. She also de
clared a major in drama, which has allowed
her to dance as much as she desires. She'll
also be designing a dance performance as
part of her senior project.
As for her future, Turner is intent on mak
ing the pilgrimage to the mecca of dance —
New York City — immediately post-gradua
tion. Last summer she danced there for two
weeks after completing a rigorous six-week

summer dance program at Harvard, and"l
became really comfortable there," she says.
Turner thinks she would also like to join a
dance company, and Europe offers interest
ing opportunities because of the substantial
financial support the arts receive there. But
she's flexible, and willing to tackle the va
garies of the dancing life. "There are a lot of
other things to experience," says the 20-year
old. "I'm still finding who I am and where I
am as a creative voice."

Clad in her black leather jacket and a ban
danna, sporting a rock-sized lapis lazuli ring,
Lea Wolf cuts a tough figure that doesn't stop
with the clothing. She talks rapidly, with a
dry sense of humor, and enjoys describing
how many times she was told that she didn't
have what it takes to be a dancer.
Now 23, Wolf dances professionally with
the Delia Davidson Dance Company in San
Francisco, where she makes her home. A
freshly minted Stanford graduate with a de
gree in Modern Thought and Literature,
Wolf pledged to herself late in her senior year
that she would audition for the Davidson
Dance Company and make it within five
years. Within a year she was accepted, and
since then she's been prancing, sidling, hop
ping, doin' her own thing and making her
livelihood quite happily.
Like so many others, Wolf started dance in
her wee years, but rapidly found ballet not to
be her forte. "When the teacher wasn't look
ing I'd sit and hang around and when he
looked at me I'd kick and dance furiously," she
says."And he'd say, 'My, you have such great
energy!' And all the other dancers gave me
these looks saying, 'You don't belong here.' "
Struggling through dance during those
early years, Wolf found herself to be "a big
fish in a small pond" when she wound her
way into Stanford. Modern dance immedi

ately became her route of expression, though
she didn't need class as an opportunity to
perform. "I'd dance in my room with the
music playing," she says.
On a bright Saturday afternoon in Room
33 of Roble Gym, Wolf carries a stack of cos
tumes — "1 made them myself over Thanks
giving," she declares — and they could be
hardly called demure. She's made them for
her dancers in a piece that will be part of
Schaaf's design project. As her hips rapidly
sidle this way and that, and with her dancers
crawling, rolling, falling on top, under and
over each other, it's hard to believe she's just
not doing this for the sake of a good time. She
emits yodels and happy yelps with gusto, and
it's infectious, setting the dancers leaping and
whooping shamelessly.
"You make a mockery of serious dance!"
says Wolf, feigning a finger-wagging tone.
After a dry run through the dance, she be
comes serious. "Maybe we should clean that
up, seeing as I didn't recognize what I saw,"
she says.
In a world where techniques can become
dogmas and aesthetic ideas easily transform
into aesthetic absolutes, Wolf has had to trash
numerous idols. Speaking of her dance class
es and advice given to her at Stanford, she
says that "some of it was good and I could
use, some of it I'd say you don't know what
you're talking about, and some of it was shit."

it becomes clear that her dance involves
spontaneous, easy experimentation that lies
even on the edge of modern dance. Never

way into Stanford. Modern dance immedi

ately became her route of expression, though
she didn't need class as an opportunity to
perform. "I'd dance in my room with the
music playing," she says.
On a bright Saturday afternoon in Room
33 of Roble Gym, Wolf carries a stack of cos
tumes — "1 made them myself over Thanks
giving," she declares — and they could be
hardly called demure. She's made them for
her dancers in a piece that will be part of
Schaaf's design project. As her hips rapidly
sidle this way and that, and with her dancers
crawling, rolling, falling on top, under and
over each other, it's hard to believe she's just
not doing this for the sake of a good time. She
emits yodels and happy yelps with gusto, and
it's infectious, setting the dancers leaping and
whooping shamelessly.
"You make a mockery of serious dance!"
says Wolf, feigning a finger-wagging tone.
After a dry run through the dance, she be
comes serious. "Maybe we should clean that
up, seeing as I didn't recognize what I saw,"
she says.
In a world where techniques can become
dogmas and aesthetic ideas easily transform
into aesthetic absolutes, Wolf has had to trash
numerous idols. Speaking of her dance class
es and advice given to her at Stanford, she
says that "some of it was good and I could
use, some of it I'd say you don't know what
you're talking about, and some of it was shit."
"I do a lot of improvisation," she says, and
it becomes clear that her dance involves
spontaneous, easy experimentation that lies
even on the edge of modern dance. Never
theless, its overridden by so much fun and joy
it's hard to resist. Turner sits on the side and
grins as though she were watching her chil
dren play in the sandbox.
"Someone called it very 'life-affirming,' "
Wolf says with a smirk. Caught up complete
ly in her frolicking, tongue-in-cheek moves,
it certainly seems true within her own life. ■

"A Meeting of Dances" will be performed Dec.
10 at 8 p.m. in the Roble Dance Studio. Admis

THE PROFESSOR AS &ANCER
Stephanie Sc&aaf
Stephanie Schaaf, 26, is trying to put more
space between eight of her dancers as they lie
down on the wood floor of Roble Gym one

cold Friday evening. She lies with them, and
makes sure it looks OK — traumatic collisions
are not part of the performance — and she
also attempts to make sure the dancers can see
each other and can be seen by the audience.
She laughs and jokes with them, asking them
to come up with their own moves and com
bine various dance phrases together so the
performance comes together as a whole.
Easygoing appearances notwithstanding,
Schaaf says that her first teaching experiences
weren't so relaxing. "I was petrified," she says.
"I firmly believe just because you're a good
performer doesn't mean you know how to
teach that to someone."
Surprising words coming from someone
who has performed dozens of times in front
of audiences from the Big Apple to Seattle.
Schaaf started dancing at the tender age of
five, and began ballet training at the age of
eight at the prestigious School of American
Ballet in New York City, from whose ranks
the dancers for the New York City Ballet are
cultivated.
"I got in really young," says Schaaf, sitting
in the top floor of Tresidder in a moment of
repose, nursing a sore left shin. "They take
young people who have long legs and nice
feet and see what they can do with them."
Schaaf says she was one of those "guinea pigs"
and of 30 or so dancers who entered, within
two years she was the only one left. The
process was intense.
"People worked really hard — they just
worked," she says. "We were really young,
and there's so much self-judgment in dance.
Not just comparing who you're standing next
to, but comparing yourself with what you

think is possible.
"You can achieve a
certain amount and
feel good about
what you've ach
ieved, but there's al
ways still more. It's
great, but when
you're younger, you
haven't achieved all
that much, and it's
hard to always be
beating on your
self."
Soon came a mo
ment of decision
that would turn
Schaaf's career a
round. After several
years of training,
Schaaf was promot
ed to the next higher
division at the
school. However,
the evaluators noted
that she didn't have
enough turnout —

a term describing rotation of the hips, a trait
that is partly genetic — and that this would
become a greater concern as time went on.
Further, her promotion meant that she
would have to show up at school at 10:30 in
the morning, and she was already leaving
school early for ballet.
So Schaaf decided to opt out of ballet, re
turning to her New Jersey home and per
forming locally. By the time she entered Tufts
University, Schaaf didn't intend to focus on
dance. She says, "all the dance I did was ex
tracurricular. I studied English in college. We
ran a student group at school — we did what
we could, but it wasn't very good. But I didn't
realize how much, how desperately I was
going to miss it."
In college, Schaaf encountered modern
dance for the first time, and it was a hard
transition to make, possibly because of her
training in the old school. Nevertheless, once
she delved into it, she never looked back.
"There are a limited number of ways in
which you can move in ballet, and a lot of bal
let has to do with absence of weight — you
have to look weightless, ethereal," she says.
"(Modern dance) is a totally different physi
cality, a totally different reality of how you
move. There are just so many possibilities in
modern dance. I've found out much more of
myself and the way I want to move and the
things I want to do."
Like a true Stanford student, however,
Schaaf denied her dance calling and sought
the security of "a real job." But it didn't work.
"1 worked in a TV newsroom. You tell people
you have it and people go, 'ooh.' Everybody
wants the job, 1 should like it, but I didn't. I
kept trying to find things I loved as much as
dance and I couldn't."
So Schaaf moved to Seattle, dancing with
companies, learning, experimenting and
practicing, practicing, practicing. On the
side she painted apartments and did unin
spiring temp work. Managing not to wait
ress, however, was "a big accomplishment,"
she says.
Finally, after the leader of her dance com
pany left for teaching, Schaaf decided she
wanted to learn "how to teach, how to chore
ograph, and how to teach at a university." So
she applied to the Stanford School of Educa
tion, which offers a dance specialization.
"Most of the people in the School of Ed. don't
know about it, it's sort of the mystery pro
gram," she laughs.
Dispelling the mystery of dance in the uni
versity setting is important to Schaaf. "A lot
of people don't get it or don't understand it,
so they don't fund it, don't support it," she
says. "It's a struggle, and it's always going to
be a struggle, but it belongs here. I hate hav
ing to justify it in this way but to be able to
take a dance class is a highly intellectual ac
tivity. I think because it's physical, because

you don't talk, a lot of people in the system
don't see it as that."
In addition to fulfilling all the normal re
quirements for a master's in education,
Schaaf also must fulfill extra requirements:
taking classes in dance history, dance perfor
mance, dance in different cultures and chore
ography; teaching undergraduates in mod
ern dance and ballet. She also must prepare a
lecture at the end of the program and design
dance projects.
So what has the miniscule Stanford pro
gram — only one other person is currently
enrolled — taught? "A lot more courage than
1 had before," she says. "School's a much eas
ier place to get your feet wet teaching, chore
ographing."
Currently involved in designing a modern
dance project entitled "A Meeting of Dances"
with several other choreographers, Schaaf
knows that modern dance often scares off
folks because they feel that they just "don't get
it, they haven't nailed it down." For her, how
ever, the purpose of modern dance is simple.
" The beauty of it is that it's not to be nailed
down. It can mean 10 different things at once,
and you can take all of them with you. I just
hope people take it in and just get whatever they
get. Some choreographers set out with some
thing in mind, but you just catch what you can
and figure out what it means to you," she says

with a smile. "And don't worry about it."

TiONtAL CORPORATE LAH/EA
AS DANCER Alexis Tmn»er
Stanford senior Alexis Turner is practicing
a solo piece in room 42 of Roble, which is also
cold, even by mid-morning. With her lithe
figure, closely cropped red hair and leg
warmers, she seems to fit the idea of the par
adigmatic female dancer. She says she hasn't
practiced in about a week and apologizes be
forehand, as she selects a CD track from a
portable boom box. Her dance, now slow,
soft and stylized, then suddenly quick and
cat-like, seems infused with a personal ener
gy that Turner isn't afraid to ad mi*
"I think the very first bit of movement in
the show happened when I was walking up
Third Avenue in New York this summer and
I was thinking about my ex-boyfriend," she
says. ' And all of a sudden this gestural thing
started. Because I was in New York and it
didn't matter, I was walking down the street
doing this."
From this beginning Turner has tried to
fashion a piece, named after a poem by Adri

enne Rich, that has also seemed to create it
self. "It started off as my working out in my
mind what had been wrong in this one rela
tionship, but it ended up being my working
out my relationship with myself," she says.
"Of course the two are deeply intertwined.
It's about what I have to say about myself in
relation to others. It started very specific and
became very general, but very relevant."
As Turner began to see the dance develop,
it allowed her to consider what she was ad
dressing, and how she felt about it, which
wasn't easy. "Stepping away from the rela
tionship I was able to see the emotional posi
tion I had put myself in and I found that re
ally ridiculous, so I started to laugh at myself,
which is always a good thing for me," she
says, smiling. "So that's where I started with
the idea of it being humorous, and it was
great working that way because it allowed me
to get more personal. I had that comfort zone
— 'Oh, it's a joke, I can really do this.' Then I
came up with everything and started per
forming it, and maybe somewhere along the
way I forgot that it was a joke."
The tension between trying to impose a
conscious intent on the dance and letting run
its own field is one that Turner still struggles
with as a dancer and choreographer. She
mentions terms like "structure," "form,"
"function" and "process," trying to get at the
"rules" of the dance. "I thought there must be
some supreme way in doing it," she says. "It's
funny how much pressure there actually is to
work a certain way, and you need to go to the
studio and dance for 10 hours and see what
comes out."
As a Stanford undergraduate, Turner has
choreographed Ram's Head musicals includ
ing "Cabaret" and "West Side Story." Like
Schaaf, she studied ballet at an early age,
finding modern dance only in her freshman
year at Bryn Mawr.
As a freshman at 8.M., Turner was on the
pre-law track. "I was interested in interna
tional corporate law. After my freshman year
I decided I probably didn't want to do that. I
was thinking about doing some kind of art
major, and it was funny — I was trying to
think what I could do that I'd enjoy and make
time for dance as much as possible."
After transferring from Bryn Mawr to
Stanford, she decided to pursue modern
dance wholeheartedly, performing in
"Spring Migration," the annual performance
put on by the dance division. She also de
clared a major in drama, which has allowed
her to dance as much as she desires. She'll
also be designing a dance performance as
part of her senior project.
As for her future, Turner is intent on mak
ing the pilgrimage to the mecca of dance —
New York City — immediately post-gradua
tion. Last summer she danced there for two
weeks after completing a rigorous six-week

summer dance program at Harvard, and"l
became really comfortable there," she says.
Turner thinks she would also like to join a
dance company, and Europe offers interest
ing opportunities because of the substantial
financial support the arts receive there. But
she's flexible, and willing to tackle the va
garies of the dancing life. "There are a lot of
other things to experience," says the 20-year
old. "I'm still finding who I am and where I
am as a creative voice."

Clad in her black leather jacket and a ban
danna, sporting a rock-sized lapis lazuli ring,
Lea Wolf cuts a tough figure that doesn't stop
with the clothing. She talks rapidly, with a
dry sense of humor, and enjoys describing
how many times she was told that she didn't
have what it takes to be a dancer.
Now 23, Wolf dances professionally with
the Delia Davidson Dance Company in San
Francisco, where she makes her home. A
freshly minted Stanford graduate with a de
gree in Modern Thought and Literature,
Wolf pledged to herself late in her senior year
that she would audition for the Davidson
Dance Company and make it within five
years. Within a year she was accepted, and
since then she's been prancing, sidling, hop
ping, doin' her own thing and making her
livelihood quite happily.
Like so many others, Wolf started dance in
her wee years, but rapidly found ballet not to
be her forte. "When the teacher wasn't look
ing I'd sit and hang around and when he
looked at me I'd kick and dance furiously," she
says."And he'd say, 'My, you have such great
energy!' And all the other dancers gave me
these looks saying, 'You don't belong here.' "
Struggling through dance during those
early years, Wolf found herself to be "a big
fish in a small pond" when she wound her
way into Stanford. Modern dance immedi

ately became her route of expression, though
she didn't need class as an opportunity to
perform. "I'd dance in my room with the

dry sense of humor, and enjoys describing
how many times she was told that she didn't
have what it takes to be a dancer.
Now 23, Wolf dances professionally with
the Delia Davidson Dance Company in San
Francisco, where she makes her home. A
freshly minted Stanford graduate with a de
gree in Modern Thought and Literature,
Wolf pledged to herself late in her senior year
that she would audition for the Davidson
Dance Company and make it within five
years. Within a year she was accepted, and
since then she's been prancing, sidling, hop
ping, doin' her own thing and making her
livelihood quite happily.
Like so many others, Wolf started dance in
her wee years, but rapidly found ballet not to
be her forte. "When the teacher wasn't look
ing I'd sit and hang around and when he
looked at me I'd kick and dance furiously," she
says."And he'd say, 'My, you have such great
energy!' And all the other dancers gave me
these looks saying, 'You don't belong here.' "
Struggling through dance during those
early years, Wolf found herself to be "a big
fish in a small pond" when she wound her
way into Stanford. Modern dance immedi

ately became her route of expression, though
she didn't need class as an opportunity to
perform. "I'd dance in my room with the
music playing," she says.
On a bright Saturday afternoon in Room
33 of Roble Gym, Wolf carries a stack of cos
tumes — "1 made them myself over Thanks
giving," she declares — and they could be
hardly called demure. She's made them for
her dancers in a piece that will be part of
Schaaf's design project. As her hips rapidly
sidle this way and that, and with her dancers
crawling, rolling, falling on top, under and
over each other, it's hard to believe she's just
not doing this for the sake of a good time. She
emits yodels and happy yelps with gusto, and
it's infectious, setting the dancers leaping and
whooping shamelessly.
"You make a mockery of serious dance!"
says Wolf, feigning a finger-wagging tone.
After a dry run through the dance, she be
comes serious. "Maybe we should clean that
up, seeing as I didn't recognize what I saw,"
she says.
In a world where techniques can become
dogmas and aesthetic ideas easily transform
into aesthetic absolutes, Wolf has had to trash
numerous idols. Speaking of her dance class
es and advice given to her at Stanford, she
says that "some of it was good and I could
use, some of it I'd say you don't know what
you're talking about, and some of it was shit."
"I do a lot of improvisation," she says, and
it becomes clear that her dance involves
spontaneous, easy experimentation that lies
even on the edge of modern dance. Never
theless, its overridden by so much fun and joy
it's hard to resist. Turner sits on the side and
grins as though she were watching her chil
dren play in the sandbox.
"Someone called it very 'life-affirming,' "
Wolf says with a smirk. Caught up complete
ly in her frolicking, tongue-in-cheek moves,
it certainly seems true within her own life. ■

"A Meeting of Dances" will be performed Dec.
10 at 8 p.m. in the Roble Dance Studio. Admis

modern — adj. 1. of, relating to, or char
acteristic of a period extending from a rele
vant remote past to the present time 2. in
volving recent techniques, methods, or ideas:
up-to-date.
dance — v.i. 1. to move one's feet or body,
or both, rhythmically in a pattern of steps,
esp. to the accompaniment of music. 2. to
leap, skip, etc., as from excitement or emo
tion; move nimbly or quickly. 3. to bob up
and down.
Through its myriad forms, modern dance
— however it may be defined — somehow
continues to make its humble home at Stan
ford, an institution renown for Pascal, prob
lem sets and protein folding rather than
pirouettes and split-leaps. Nevertheless, the
art manages to survive here, like some stub
born cliff shrub, thanks to those hardy few
who dare make it their calling.
For them, dance has offered moments of
self-discovery, intellectual and physical chal
lenges and, as in all art, the opportunity for
individual expression. Among these artists
are three individuals who, through separate
ways, have managed to develop their talent
on the Farm and ensure that Stanford's com
mitment to the arts remains intact.
THE PROFESSOR AS &ANCER
Stephanie Sc&aaf
Stephanie Schaaf, 26, is trying to put more
space between eight of her dancers as they lie
down on the wood floor of Roble Gym one

cold Friday evening. She lies with them, and
makes sure it looks OK — traumatic collisions
are not part of the performance — and she
also attempts to make sure the dancers can see
each other and can be seen by the audience.
She laughs and jokes with them, asking them
to come up with their own moves and com
bine various dance phrases together so the
performance comes together as a whole.
Easygoing appearances notwithstanding,
Schaaf says that her first teaching experiences
weren't so relaxing. "I was petrified," she says.
"I firmly believe just because you're a good
performer doesn't mean you know how to
teach that to someone."
Surprising words coming from someone
who has performed dozens of times in front
of audiences from the Big Apple to Seattle.
Schaaf started dancing at the tender age of
five, and began ballet training at the age of
eight at the prestigious School of American
Ballet in New York City, from whose ranks
the dancers for the New York City Ballet are
cultivated.
"I got in really young," says Schaaf, sitting
in the top floor of Tresidder in a moment of
repose, nursing a sore left shin. "They take
young people who have long legs and nice
feet and see what they can do with them."
Schaaf says she was one of those "guinea pigs"
and of 30 or so dancers who entered, within
two years she was the only one left. The
process was intense.
"People worked really hard — they just
worked," she says. "We were really young,
and there's so much self-judgment in dance.
Not just comparing who you're standing next
to, but comparing yourself with what you

think is possible.
"You can achieve a
certain amount and
feel good about
what you've ach
ieved, but there's al
ways still more. It's
great, but when
you're younger, you
haven't achieved all
that much, and it's
hard to always be
beating on your
self."
Soon came a mo
ment of decision
that would turn
Schaaf's career a
round. After several
years of training,
Schaaf was promot
ed to the next higher
division at the
school. However,
the evaluators noted
that she didn't have
enough turnout —

a term describing rotation of the hips, a trait
that is partly genetic — and that this would
become a greater concern as time went on.
Further, her promotion meant that she
would have to show up at school at 10:30 in
the morning, and she was already leaving
school early for ballet.
So Schaaf decided to opt out of ballet, re
turning to her New Jersey home and per
forming locally. By the time she entered Tufts
University, Schaaf didn't intend to focus on
dance. She says, "all the dance I did was ex
tracurricular. I studied English in college. We
ran a student group at school — we did what
we could, but it wasn't very good. But I didn't
realize how much, how desperately I was
going to miss it."
In college, Schaaf encountered modern
dance for the first time, and it was a hard
transition to make, possibly because of her
training in the old school. Nevertheless, once
she delved into it, she never looked back.
"There are a limited number of ways in
which you can move in ballet, and a lot of bal
let has to do with absence of weight — you
have to look weightless, ethereal," she says.
"(Modern dance) is a totally different physi
cality, a totally different reality of how you
move. There are just so many possibilities in
modern dance. I've found out much more of
myself and the way I want to move and the
things I want to do."
Like a true Stanford student, however,
Schaaf denied her dance calling and sought
the security of "a real job." But it didn't work.
"1 worked in a TV newsroom. You tell people
you have it and people go, 'ooh.' Everybody
wants the job, 1 should like it, but I didn't. I
kept trying to find things I loved as much as
dance and I couldn't."
So Schaaf moved to Seattle, dancing with
companies, learning, experimenting and
practicing, practicing, practicing. On the
side she painted apartments and did unin
spiring temp work. Managing not to wait
ress, however, was "a big accomplishment,"
she says.
Finally, after the leader of her dance com
pany left for teaching, Schaaf decided she
wanted to learn "how to teach, how to chore
ograph, and how to teach at a university." So
she applied to the Stanford School of Educa
tion, which offers a dance specialization.
"Most of the people in the School of Ed. don't
know about it, it's sort of the mystery pro
gram," she laughs.
Dispelling the mystery of dance in the uni
versity setting is important to Schaaf. "A lot
of people don't get it or don't understand it,
so they don't fund it, don't support it," she
says. "It's a struggle, and it's always going to
be a struggle, but it belongs here. I hate hav
ing to justify it in this way but to be able to
take a dance class is a highly intellectual ac
tivity. I think because it's physical, because

you don't talk, a lot of people in the system
don't see it as that."
In addition to fulfilling all the normal re
quirements for a master's in education,
Schaaf also must fulfill extra requirements:
taking classes in dance history, dance perfor
mance, dance in different cultures and chore
ography; teaching undergraduates in mod
ern dance and ballet. She also must prepare a
lecture at the end of the program and design
dance projects.
So what has the miniscule Stanford pro
gram — only one other person is currently
enrolled — taught? "A lot more courage than
1 had before," she says. "School's a much eas
ier place to get your feet wet teaching, chore
ographing."
Currently involved in designing a modern
dance project entitled "A Meeting of Dances"
with several other choreographers, Schaaf
knows that modern dance often scares off
folks because they feel that they just "don't get
it, they haven't nailed it down." For her, how
ever, the purpose of modern dance is simple.
" The beauty of it is that it's not to be nailed
down. It can mean 10 different things at once,
and you can take all of them with you. I just
hope people take it in and just get whatever they
get. Some choreographers set out with some
thing in mind, but you just catch what you can
and figure out what it means to you," she says

with a smile. "And don't worry about it."
THE EX -FUTURE - INTERIM -
TiONtAL CORPORATE LAH/EA
AS DANCER Alexis Tmn»er
Stanford senior Alexis Turner is practicing
a solo piece in room 42 of Roble, which is also
cold, even by mid-morning. With her lithe
figure, closely cropped red hair and leg
warmers, she seems to fit the idea of the par
adigmatic female dancer. She says she hasn't
practiced in about a week and apologizes be
forehand, as she selects a CD track from a
portable boom box. Her dance, now slow,
soft and stylized, then suddenly quick and
cat-like, seems infused with a personal ener
gy that Turner isn't afraid to ad mi*
"I think the very first bit of movement in
the show happened when I was walking up
Third Avenue in New York this summer and
I was thinking about my ex-boyfriend," she
says. ' And all of a sudden this gestural thing
started. Because I was in New York and it
didn't matter, I was walking down the street
doing this."
From this beginning Turner has tried to
fashion a piece, named after a poem by Adri

enne Rich, that has also seemed to create it
self. "It started off as my working out in my
mind what had been wrong in this one rela
tionship, but it ended up being my working
out my relationship with myself," she says.
"Of course the two are deeply intertwined.
It's about what I have to say about myself in
relation to others. It started very specific and
became very general, but very relevant."
As Turner began to see the dance develop,
it allowed her to consider what she was ad
dressing, and how she felt about it, which
wasn't easy. "Stepping away from the rela
tionship I was able to see the emotional posi
tion I had put myself in and I found that re
ally ridiculous, so I started to laugh at myself,
which is always a good thing for me," she
says, smiling. "So that's where I started with
the idea of it being humorous, and it was
great working that way because it allowed me
to get more personal. I had that comfort zone
— 'Oh, it's a joke, I can really do this.' Then I
came up with everything and started per
forming it, and maybe somewhere along the
way I forgot that it was a joke."
The tension between trying to impose a
conscious intent on the dance and letting run
its own field is one that Turner still struggles
with as a dancer and choreographer. She
mentions terms like "structure," "form,"
"function" and "process," trying to get at the
"rules" of the dance. "I thought there must be
some supreme way in doing it," she says. "It's
funny how much pressure there actually is to
work a certain way, and you need to go to the
studio and dance for 10 hours and see what
comes out."
As a Stanford undergraduate, Turner has
choreographed Ram's Head musicals includ
ing "Cabaret" and "West Side Story." Like
Schaaf, she studied ballet at an early age,
finding modern dance only in her freshman
year at Bryn Mawr.
As a freshman at 8.M., Turner was on the
pre-law track. "I was interested in interna
tional corporate law. After my freshman year
I decided I probably didn't want to do that. I
was thinking about doing some kind of art
major, and it was funny — I was trying to
think what I could do that I'd enjoy and make
time for dance as much as possible."
After transferring from Bryn Mawr to
Stanford, she decided to pursue modern
dance wholeheartedly, performing in
"Spring Migration," the annual performance
put on by the dance division. She also de
clared a major in drama, which has allowed
her to dance as much as she desires. She'll
also be designing a dance performance as
part of her senior project.
As for her future, Turner is intent on mak
ing the pilgrimage to the mecca of dance —
New York City — immediately post-gradua
tion. Last summer she danced there for two
weeks after completing a rigorous six-week

summer dance program at Harvard, and"l
became really comfortable there," she says.
Turner thinks she would also like to join a
dance company, and Europe offers interest
ing opportunities because of the substantial
financial support the arts receive there. But
she's flexible, and willing to tackle the va
garies of the dancing life. "There are a lot of
other things to experience," says the 20-year
old. "I'm still finding who I am and where I
am as a creative voice."
