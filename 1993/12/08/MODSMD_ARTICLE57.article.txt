# Sixth-degree burns
## Entertainment outweighs enlightenment in 'Degrees' 
### 
Life's a big hustle. Just ask any one of the
characters in the screen adaptation of John
Guare's critically celebrated play "Six Degrees
of Separation." The trick, they'll gladly tell
you, is to avoid getting caught practicing the
wrong racket.
You peddle medicine— fine. Run a depart
ment store — swell. Enlighten young minds
— fabulous. Bang out sensationalistic rubbish
— it's a living. Whip up designer dinners —
more power to ya. There's a piece of the pie out
there with your name on it, they'll say.

Then with a nod and a hardy hand shake,
they'll bid you good luck and Godspeed. Very
chummy, I'm sure. Just always remember to
never be down and out and pitiful near them.
It's distracting and befuddling.
Take Flan and Ouisa Kittredge (Donald
Sutherland and Stockard Channing), private
art dealers to the investor, the connoisseur
and the ridiculously wealthy. At the film's
opening, they're schmoozing with a rich
friend (lan McKellen) just in from South
Africa. He couldn't have arrived in Manhattan

at a better time, because Flan is on the brink of
closing the art deal of the century; all he needs
is a willing party to kick him an additional $2
million dollars. Ouisa and Flan are counting
on getting the money from their dinner guest.
But just as the negotiation reaches its most
delicate phase, who should appear but a dash
ing young brother (Will Smith) sporting a
necktie, a knife wound and a line about being
both friendly with their kids and the son of Sid
ney Poitier. They accept his credentials without
a second thought and for their troubles snag
the money they need from their foreign friend.
Imagine the distastefulness of the situa
tion, if the young man had introduced him
self as the homeless, homosexual drifter he
was in reality. Liberal cordiality would have
quickly been kicked to the curb for an "I'm
not having it" attitude.
It's surprising how far a few well-placed
white lies and pleasantries can take you. They
usher our young brother — let's call him Paul,
as playwright / screenwriter Guare suggests —
through a series of posh adventures at the ex
pense of the Kittredges and two other well-to
do, liberal minded, Manhattan families. Of the
husders Guare and filmmaker Fred Schepisi
offer their viewing audience, none appear more
romanticized, none have more at stake than he.
So why do they choose to make the Kit
tredges, in particular, and the other well-off
characters the most important?
Because as much as Guare would have us
think that "Degrees" is a film preoccupied
with race and class issues of time-bomb im
portance, it's really wrapped up in the "bril
liant" nothing that manifests itself in Ouisa's
closing monologue: "There is color in my life,

but I'm not aware of any structure." Like
Holden Caulfield in J.D. Salinger's "Catcher
in the Rye," she realizes that her posh, Fifth
Avenue existence is meaningless because
there's nothing left for her to achieve —
there's no merry-go-round with a shiny brass
ring for her to try to snatch from below.
Paul's stormy invasion into her life sup
posedly is the enigma for her enlightenment,
but why should we care when his psychosis
(by the end of the film, he truly believes him
self to be Poitiers son, even though the actor's
children are all girls) is ever so much more ap
pealing?
Smith's Paul is perhaps the most compli
cated young black male to ever find his way
outside of a 'hood picture. Not only is Paul, as
written, believable in a realistically privileged
world, he's convincing in the alternate uni
verse of the street as well. Smith, the high
school nerd turned rapper turned "Fresh
Prince" turned serious actor, delivers the best
performance of his long life.
But this comes as no surprise, as "Degrees"
is as much about engaging the audience with
thoroughly enjoyable dialogue and acting as it
is about slipping in a "sobering" message for
mass consumption. Thus, Smith's costars
Channing (who starred in the original Broad
way production), Sutherland, et al turn in
equally glowing performances.
Sitting through a flick with entertaining
dialogue and performances and a not-quite
realized theme isn't a waste of an evening, it's
just a waste of an unrealized theme. Maybe
"Degrees" needs a black director.

But this comes as no surprise, as "Degrees"
is as much about engaging the audience with
thoroughly enjoyable dialogue and acting as it
is about slipping in a "sobering" message for
mass consumption. Thus, Smith's costars
Channing (who starred in the original Broad
way production), Sutherland, et al turn in
equally glowing performances.
Sitting through a flick with entertaining
dialogue and performances and a not-quite
realized theme isn't a waste of an evening, it's
just a waste of an unrealized theme. Maybe
"Degrees" needs a black director.
