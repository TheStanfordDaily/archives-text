## Mrs. Doubtfire 
### 
Robin Williams is a creatively inspired,
possibly insane genius. Just as his voice
tipped the sappy Disney cartoon "Aladdin"
over the line from mediocrity to genuine en
tertainment, so too do his cross-dressing an
tics in "Mrs. Doubtfire" lift the movie a level
above the typical cheesy family fare.
Williams plays Daniel Hillard, an out-of
work actor with a mission — to love his chil
dren. However, after he gives his son a birth
day party complete with live barnyard ani
mals and dancing on the dining room table,
his wife Miranda (a stuffy decorator who
merely brought home cake and presents) de
cides on divorce court.

Miranda (Sally
Field) is awarded cus
tody, and Daniel de
cides to take matters
into his own hands. He
dresses up and acts like
an old English nanny,
then auditions for the
part of his ex-wife's
housekeeper. Learning
to do all the things he
never did as a husband
(cook, clean, work a
steady job), Daniel be-

comes a fixture in his former household,
spending time with his kids and gaining new
insight into the emotions of his ex-wife.
Although his scheme eventually unravels,
getting there is lots of fun thanks to Williams'
antics and voices. As Mrs. Doubtfire advises
Miranda to remain celibate forever because no
one can "replace the father of your children,"
you just innately want to laugh. Although
much of the material is a repeat of tired gender
stereotypes and a few scenes are lifted almost
directly from other movies, somehow
Williams' acting makes it seem almost new.
The rest of the cast adequately supports
Williams. Field gives Miranda a caring side
which keeps the movie from falling into the
black-and-white, great-dad-and-witch
mom stereotype all too common in movie
portrayals of divorce. She loves her kids and
wants what's best for them, just not in the
same way as their father. The child actors
(Lisa Jakub, Matthew Lawrence, Mara Wil
son) are naturally enthralled with Williams'
antics, lending a genuine note to the father
child relationships in the film.
But with Williams producing the movie as
well as acting the almost-dual role, it's really
his show. In typical Williams fashion, a seri
ous commentary on divorce is disguised by
the almost-slapstick comedy of the moment.
Overall, "Mrs. Doubtfire" may not be
"Tootsie," but it's no drag.
