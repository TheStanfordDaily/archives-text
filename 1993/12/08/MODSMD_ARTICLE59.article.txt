# A 						Dangerous Woman
## 
### 
Ah, there's nothing like a heaping dose of
pathos, and "A Dangerous Woman" 's
Martha Horgan (Debra Winger) offers plen
ty: She's stricken by some nameless mental
disability and wears shoes that make ortho
pedics look sleek. Everybody's getting con
stant nooky except her, so she masturbates.
Worst of all, she has an extremely bad hair
day. No one ever said life was fair.
So unfolds the story of Martha, her aunt
and caretaker Frances (Barbara Hershey) and
the tumultuous chain of events that occur
when schmarmy drunk / carpenter Mackey
(Gabriel Byrne) enters their lives. The plot is
relatively simple: Martha's life sucks. Enter
Mackey. He gets drunk. They have sex. She
falls in love. Frances' life sucks. Enter Mack
ey. She gets drunk. They have sex. Mackey de
cides he better get the hell out of town.
But things don't really turn out that simply.
Everything that is screwy about the charac
ters' relationships culminates in a final violent
event that is so implausible that we can only
explain it as the filmmakers' attempt to offer
some cheap thrills.
Somehow, director Stephen Gyllenhaal
manages to take the sexiness out of frequent,
gratuitous and graphic sex scenes. This is a
world where foreplay and afterglow don't exist,

where alcohol is the ultimate aphrodisiac and
where an adulterous couple indulges in pas
sionate sex after the man's drunken wife has
just driven through his mistress' front porch.
While these oddities largely contribute to
the movie's snooze-ability, the questionable
messages they send are even more problemat
ic. The distinction between rape and lovemak
ing is severely blurred more than once, and
every time one party's drunkenness seems to
be the justification.
Equally, if not more, disturbing is the
treatment of Martha's mental disability —
which is never defined except to say that she
"has always been odd." Martha successfully
covers every deplorable stereotype of dis
abled people, from the moral deviant to
"primitive" to pathetic leech.
Maybe that's just what happens when you
have too many bad hair days.
