# Under the looking glass:
## Faculty, students critique CIV program 
### Romesh Ratnesar Skip Schwartz Senior staff writers 
In 1988, while writing the proposal for
the Cultures, Ideas and Values program,
History Prof. Paul Seaver was asked how
long he thought it would be until it was nec
essary to re-examine the program.
"I said I thought if we got five years out of
it, we would be doing well. That is about
what we've got," he said in a recent inter
view.
Indeed, the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education has already formed a sub
committee to look at CIV — in conjunction
with the entire distribution requirement
system — five years after CIV replaced the
old Western Civilization course.
Many members of the Stanford commu
nity agree the occasion is right for a recon
sideration of ClV's effectiveness in its pre
sent form.
In a recent poll conducted by The Daily,
72 percent of undergraduates said they feel
CIV should be changed
"When the curriculum gets reformed by
the [commission] and if there is a proposal
to get rid of CIV, that wouldn't bother me,"
said German Prof. Ted Andersson, director
of the Myth and Modernity track. "Any
thing in place as long as CIV has been is due
for a change."
"The CIV requirement as it stands now
should undergo scrutiny," said English
Prof. Robert Polhemus. "As is stands now,
we might be able to junk it."

CIV and its discontents
Since its inception, CIV has been the sub
ject of numerous disputes within the Uni
versity and higher education nationwide.
Critics of Western Civilization charged
that the course was too narrow in its scope,
reflecting a Euro-centric, male-dominated
view of culture. CIV was then introduced to
expose students to "issues of race, gender
and class." But some question whether, in
trying to accommodate such topics, CIV has
diluted its intellectual rigor in all areas.
"CIV tries to serve too many masters,"
said Education Prof. Ron Glass, coordinator
of the Philosophy track. "The need to ex
pose students to issues of race, gender and
class, and still provide in-depth coverage
with different cultural perspectives — it's
probably too much loaded onto one course."
He added that "we tend to err too much on
the coverage side rather than the depth
side."
Seaver agreed, saying, "It is a perennial
problem that we never solve.

"Trying to find the right balance
of reading is a constant struggle,"
he said. He described the creation
of the CIV syllabus each year as a
"slash and burn" process.
"If you look at the syllabus as it
develops, you sense how it becomes
more and more loaded to the point
where it is finally ridiculous, and
the faculty sees that," he said. Hut
even if the list of texts gets reduced,
"the process starts all over again
when someone says you can't teach
without x and y."
Aspirations to accommodate a
broad range of perspectives some
times lessen the depth that study of
the works can reach, students say.
"It seems like a big list of books
to read, and not enough discus
sion," said junior Luz Herrera, a
commission member. She added
that she would like to see "more
discussion and talk about how stu
dents' cultures, ideas and values fit
into the topics."
Freshman Ed Maklouf, a stu
dent in the Philosophy track, said
that some issues in his class seem
to be "tagged on."
"In the Philosophy track, (the
discussion of gender | is the most
blatant bit of tokenism I've come
across," he said.
"You go through it so fast, it's
hard to get a lot out of it," added
freshman Rachel Rosenthal, a stu
dent in Literature and the Arts.
Hut others feel that simply nar
rowing ClV's scope would not
heighten students' knowledge of
the texts or the topics studied.
Instead, they claim CIV best func

tions as a springboard to future
academic enterprise.
"When you start your reading
life, you have to read everything,
and you have to read it thoroughly.
That's really an impossible proposi
tion," Andersson said. "We
wouldn't do anything substantial
by reducing the reading list from 15
texts to 10 texts."
"We who teach these courses see

them as intro
ductions — the
system sees
them as the
penultimate,"
Glass said "For
some people, this
is their one and
only contact with
these issues at
Stanford."
"If CIV is the

last time a student writes a paper at
Stanford, it's too bad," Seaver said.
For some students, CIV does
provide valuable background in
areas of future concentration.
Sophomore Josh Flosi, a history
major who took History CIV, says
he "found it kind of useful. It gave
background into general history
and readings of basic texts that
come up over again and are
referred to."
As for the contention that ClV's
effort to expose students to other
cultures amounts to "tokenism,"
responses from those involved in
the program vary.
"Other CIV tracks are still far
too Euro-centric and tied to a
chronological (system] that is still
too limited," said Spanish Prof.
Mary Pratt, coordinator of the
Europe and the Americas track.
In The Daily's poll, 35.1 percent
of respondents said too little time
was spent studying non-Western

and female authors, while 22.2 per
cent said too much attention was
given to such texts and 39.5 percent
said they are studied the right
amount.
But Seaver said the intention of
CIV is not necessarily to "present
non-Western cultures in great
depth," but rather that "the works
of non-Western authors provide
contrast to texts from the West,
which is immensely valuable."
Common culture?
But Pratt's criticism does touch
on another issue — namely,
whether CIV has grown so large
that the various tracks have little in
common. Currently there are nine
CIV tracks: Structured Liberal
Education, Great Works, Europe
and the Americas, Humanities, Lit
erature and the Arts, Myth and
Modernity, History, Philosophy,
and Anthropology, a new track this
year.
"I think (cooperation among
tracks) has become very attenuated
in the four years I've been involved
in CIV," Glass said. "A common
intellectual framework is not one of
our strengths right now."
"There needs to be more conti
nuity among tracks," said sopho
more Albertine Beard. "They're so
different right now, some seem eas
ier than others."
But many faculty contend that
the whole notion that CIV should
provide a "shared experience" for
students is faulty.
"There's no one broad liberal
arts education," said Biology Prof.
Craig Heller, a commission mem
ber. "There's so much material,
there could be a hundred different
sets or combinations, all of which
constitute excellent, broad back
grounds."

Andersson said he "personally
never believed" in a shared experi
ence for CIV students. "It's more
important for individual groups to
deal with texts that they're inter
ested in."
Future options
Most of those who were inter
viewed agreed that CIV should
either be improved or replaced with
something better.
Polhemus said he believes that
"what students get out of CIV can
be garnered in many ways ... there
can be more of a choice to satisfy
the aims of CIV."
He suggested that students be
given more course options in differ
ent disciplines that satisfy the gen
eral purpose of CIV. "If courses are
prescribed, there should be a ratio
nale for why they are prescribed,"
he said. "If there isn't a common
core curriculum, we should get rid
of the requirement altogether or
have an area requirement where
students could choose how to satis
fy it."
Andersson went so far as to say
that "if I was in the Faculty Senate
right now and a proposal came up to
get rid of CIV," he would vote for it.
He proposed a system where
classes for the Area One (CIV)
requirement would be "put togeth
er by various departments on vari
ous topics.
"It would be a little bit more like
the Harvard model, where you
have a core curriculum put togeth
er by a faculty committee" that fos
ters cross-disciplinary study.
"We may decide after looking at
(CIV) it's the best we can do at the
moment," Seaver said. "It's entire
ly healthy and salutary to step back
and look at it. It would be a big mis
take not to."
