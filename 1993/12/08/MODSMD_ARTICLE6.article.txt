# Under the looking glass:
## Faculty, students critique CIV program 
### Romesh Ratnesar Skip Schwartz Senior staff writers 
In 1988, while writing the proposal for
the Cultures, Ideas and Values program,
History Prof. Paul Seaver was asked how
long he thought it would be until it was nec
essary to re-examine the program.
"I said I thought if we got five years out of
it, we would be doing well. That is about
what we've got," he said in a recent inter
view.
Indeed, the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education has already formed a sub
committee to look at CIV — in conjunction
with the entire distribution requirement
system — five years after CIV replaced the
old Western Civilization course.
Many members of the Stanford commu
nity agree the occasion is right for a recon
sideration of ClV's effectiveness in its pre
sent form.
In a recent poll conducted by The Daily,
72 percent of undergraduates said they feel
CIV should be changed
"When the curriculum gets reformed by
the [commission] and if there is a proposal
to get rid of CIV, that wouldn't bother me,"
said German Prof. Ted Andersson, director
of the Myth and Modernity track. "Any
thing in place as long as CIV has been is due
for a change."
"The CIV requirement as it stands now
should undergo scrutiny," said English
Prof. Robert Polhemus. "As is stands now,
we might be able to junk it."

CIV and its discontents
Since its inception, CIV has been the sub
ject of numerous disputes within the Uni
versity and higher education nationwide.
Critics of Western Civilization charged
that the course was too narrow in its scope,
reflecting a Euro-centric, male-dominated
view of culture. CIV was then introduced to
expose students to "issues of race, gender
and class." But some question whether, in
trying to accommodate such topics, CIV has
diluted its intellectual rigor in all areas.
"CIV tries to serve too many masters,"
said Education Prof. Ron Glass, coordinator
of the Philosophy track. "The need to ex
pose students to issues of race, gender and
class, and still provide in-depth coverage
with different cultural perspectives — it's
probably too much loaded onto one course."
He added that "we tend to err too much on
the coverage side rather than the depth
side."
Seaver agreed, saying, "It is a perennial
problem that we never solve.
