## Dre and Snoop do your ears 'Doggystyle' 
### 
Only three words of advice can be offered
to those people who hoped that Snoop
Doggy Dogg's "Doggystyle" would be the
album to rock the Hip-Hop Nation to its very
foundations: Get over it.
After recovering from your initial disap
pointment, you'll find that specific tracks on
the accused murderer's post-"Chronic"
debut confirm Dr. Dre as the most brilliant
producer since Rick Rubin. Snoop, as Dre's
LL Cool J, plays an effective lyrical counter
point to the gangsta svengali's minimalist
production style.
The duo's "G-Funk" essentially stream
lines Parliament's booty shakin' hook-heavy
sensibilities and smooths it out with
Funkadelic's raw, intensely virile attitude.
The problem is that "Doggystyle" often recy
cles the same old funk.
To the untrained car, it can all sound the
same. The ambiance throughout connotes
that Dre refuses to spend hours reworking his
sound a la Prince, and thereby possibly en
danger his commercial success. Like a DJ
Muggs, he repeats enough of his signature
licks so that his audience, like a person with a
favorite soft drink, knows exactly what to ex
pect after they twist the cap.
But Snoop, despite the monotony and
ultra-hype surrounding the project, more
than holds his own. His vocal clarity, sprin
kled with equal portions of Rakim's "slickery
cold" resonance, Scarface's down-home
drawl, Smooth B's verbose agility and Slick
Rick's picturesque knack for narrative, is ab
solutely enchanting — when the beats match
his lyrical prowess.
"The Shiznit" is one of the few songs that
reaches the levels promised by all the cover
stories. Over simple bass-tones and hypno
tizing, Bernie Worrell-influenced keyboard
riffs, Snoop drops a rhyme that flows like hot

maple syrup over a butter • stack of pancakes.
You imagine him at the microphone —
lights low, eyes closed — spewing forth his
litany as the groove takes him somewhere
higher than the cloud of Indo smoke floating
above the room. It becomes clear why Snoop
is so loved by millions; he slides and dips
around the track's nuances with the agile grace
of a Bill "Bojangles" Robinson. Dre's back
ground track booms for the Sidekick yet is so
catchy that you wouldn't be surprised to catch
your mother singing the chorus in the shower.
A few other tracks also prove compelling.
"Lodi Dodi," while it could never surpass
Slick Rick's sparsely arranged original, is as
effective a remake as Mary J. Blige's "Sweet
Thing;" the slow-rolling background ditty is
the pcrfect setting for Snoop to give the song
a respectful re-working, Long Beach style.
"Serial Killa," perhaps the album's
strongest song, punches through the glut
with a ferocious snare-drum sample, effec
tive lyrical cameos from Kurput, Daz and
RBX and a revised "Funky Worm" lick that
causes shivers of ecstasy with every listen.
"For All My Niggaz 8c Bitches," knocks
even the "Chronic" 's supercharged, "High
Powered" out the box. Fven the smooth,
downright melodic "G'z Up Hoes Down,"
straight out the Curtis Mayfield school of
mack-daddy grooves, finds a way to keep
your toes tappin' despite its slow flow.
But, disappointingly, "Doggystyle" keeps
the head nodding without blowing one's
mind. Even with the cinema verity quality of
his narratives, Snoop, Dre and company have
pushed Cangsta rap to its limits. How many
g'z can you kill, hoes can you skeeze, or
blunts can you smoke without the whole
scene getting tired? Little wonder that in the
album's intro, like Superfly before him,
Snoop tells a homie of his dreams of escaping

"The Life." His homie's reply: "Nigga is you
crazy? That's the American dream, nigga?
Well ain't it?"
3,000,000 "Chronic" records sold and
over 2,000,000 Doggy pre-orders only con
firms that it is.
As long as Skip and Buffy Suburbia hold

on to their fascination with the fast life,
Snoop will laugh all the way to the bank. But
while Tupac Shakur will do his best to "keep
his head up," and Snoop may soon face his
own incarceration problems, the dream, de
void of funky beats, wears thin.
