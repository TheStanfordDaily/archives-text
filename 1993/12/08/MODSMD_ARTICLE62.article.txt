## "Paul is Live" Paul McCartney 
### 
The world wasn't clamoring for "Paul is
Live." As McCartney has released three live
CD's in recent years, you might suspect he'd
issued this on a whim. Or maybe just to realize
the title pun, an allusion to the infamous "Paul
is Dead" myth (the album cover features Paul
crossing a familiar Abbey Road, though now,
clue seekers, he's wearing shoes).
But for those of us stuck in the "provincial"
Bay Area, near no stop on his '93 world tour,
there are surprises. An album of superior mu-

sical calibcr with a
spontaneous sound,
"Live" might be a
welcome listen if you
want the best of what
Paul's done lately.
Arrangements are
taut and faithful to
the originals. Excep
tions are a pleasing
rockabilly "I Wanna
Be Your Man" and a
workaday "All My

Loving," which lacks the buoyant triplet
drumming of the 1963 version. Brittle har
monies throughout can't match George's and
John's, yet even familiar cuts are live coals, as
Paul's voice, in contrast to the hoarse belting
which marred "Tripping...," is again true.
A fine acoustic-flavored set is highlighted
by "Biker Like an Icon," a dark song which, de
spite typically half-baked lyrics, proves the
McCartney compositional skills intact, and by
"Here, There, and Fverywhere," where his
ragged, plaintive voice conveys poignant sin
cerity better now than then.
With the juice on, showstoppers include a
pyrotechnic "Live and l>et Die" (better than
any version yet) and a rollicking on-location
"Kansas City." But on the down side, "Paper
back Writer" isn't raw enough and "lx>oking
For Changes," an un-subtle hymn for animal
rights, should have been nixed, along with the
dirgelike would-be anthem "C'mon People."
Yet "Paul is Live" remains a fiery affirma
tion of Macca's musical gifts. He writes, sings,
plays, and his bass work is brilliantly melodic.
While his Beatles past remains a blessing and
curse as he struggles to claim a musical pre
sent, if Paul keeps plugging away with efforts
like this, folks will some day tune in again.
