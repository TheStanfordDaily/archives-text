# "Gimmick" Barkmarket

Tired of grunge? Need some angry music?
Try Barkmarket's new album "Gimmick."
The trio's sound is harsh and grating — lead
singer David Sardy at times literally barks out
his impassioned lyrics.
And the lyrics are "Gimmick" 's most out
standing facet. You get the feeling that the
group is a triumvirate expounding on the
philosophy for a new age — 1990s America.
With lyrics coupled with instrumental
noise (including sounds listed in the liner
notes as "Found Objects"), it's easy to see why,
as stated in a press release, "Some people feel
that Barkmarket's music was made for acid
laced dream sequences and the ultimate
slasher films, and they were probably right."
In the song "Static," Barkmarket rails
against the United States' current economic
power structure. "There's big money in these
fat black hills," croons Sardy, "If you know
how to smell for it."
Sardy goes on to express his disgust for the
status quo, discussing "how (he) might
choose to relieve this fat soaked need to be

king."
He then concludes by describing the only
alternative people with his mindframe have
in the present system: "I don't want to see
what there's left of me / If I could run, I'd
drag my gun? / If I could raise my gun / If I
could lift these tired plans."
Delving into social commentary, Barkmar
ket's version of a ballad, "Hack It Off," has a
slow beginning that rises to a typically frantic
fury. A song relevant in the light of the lohn /
Ixiretta Bobbitt events, it describes a similar
scenario of forced love, and then caustically
scorns it,"The finest of all intentions / The
proud hammer of just one nail in."
The guitars in each of "Gimmick" 's songs
constantly scream out in disgust against the
present system, matching Sardy's words with
a relentless pounding that creates an aura of
emotional turmoil.
Though Barkmarket is similar to Bad Re
ligion in blueprint, the band's music is much
messier, and the lyrics far less pretentious.
They are similar in that both groups become
tiresome for all but the diehard psycho
philosophers who appreciate continuous
tirades in a musical form more suitable to
slasher films than to normal listening.
