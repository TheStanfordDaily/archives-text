# Faraway, So Close
## 
### 
"Faraway, So Close" contains scenes shot
in black and white. It has subtitles to translate
for its four languages. But these things do not
necessarily detract from the film's entertain
ment value, despite what some Stanford stu
dents may believe.
Producer and director Wim Wender's bril
liant German film, in German, French, Russ
ian and English, is about Cassiel (Otto
Sander), an angel who is disgruntled because
he can observe but not have any impact upon
mortal lives. He then chooses to relinquish his
life as an angel in order to rescue a girl who
has fallen out of a 10-story building. Once
human, Cassiel encounters the wonders of
earthly life, but he also discovers the rampant
corruption of post-Cold War Berlin.
Along the way, Cassiel meets Emit Flesti
(Willem Defoe), whose name translates into
"time itself." The only character in the film
who vacillates between a human and angelic
existence, Flesti continually tries to eliminate
Cassiel for reasons which are not totally clear.
Defoe gives an enthralling performance in
this devilish role.

In his first days as a mortal, Cassiel is a
heavy-drinking streetwalker who is rescued
by his newfound friend Tony Baker (Horst
Buchholz). However, when Cassiel learns of
Baker's crooked business dealings, he is con
fronted with a moral dilemma: he knows
what Baker is doing is wrong, but at the same
time he feels an obligation to his savior.
This conflict shatters Cassiel's image of a
Utopian existence on earth. In illustrating his
character's angst, Sander portrays the role of
Cassiel superbly, combining a childlike won
der and curiosity about human life with a
need to survive and do what is right.
In addition to excellent performances,
"Faraway, So Close" 's cinematography is re
markable. Scenes from the angels' point of
view are in black and white, whereas scenes
with humans are in color, showing the lack of
effect angels have on human lives. Similarly
creative camerawork pervades the film.
This film falls into the you-can-see-it-10-
times-and-still-extract-new-meaning genre,
partly because the cast's complexity and
story line both demand complete attention.
However, the effort is well worth it — this
flick is heavenly.
