# Jamon Jamon
## 
### 
Your marriage to the owner of a lucrative
underwear company has lost that lovin' feel
ing, your only son ignores your pleas to leave
the beautiful daughter of the woman who
runs the local brothel alone, and your mid
dle-aged body is in desperate need of some
sexual healing.
What are you going to do about it?
Wallow in self-pity? Please. You'll try to kill
as many birds with one studly truck driver as
you can. At least that's the solution chosen by
a character in Bigas Luna's "Jamon Jamon," a
bizarre and erotic tale of ham and passion.
As overt as Jane Campion's "The Piano" is
subtle, the Spanish filmmaker uses a scenario
dipped in deceit and obsession to address the
more compelling issue of sexual maturity
among men and women.
Silvia (Penelope Cruz) is a beautiful
young employee of the Sanson Underwear
Company. If you ignore the fact that she's
seeing the owner's son, Jos£ Luis (Jordi
Molla), Silvia is just like any other factory
worker. But Conchita (Stefanie Sandrelli),
Josd Luis' mother, just can't do that. Instead,

she plots and plots until she devises a scheme
to push the young lovers apart.
While interviewing models for a new ad
campaign, Conchita meets Raul (Javier Bar
dem), a handsome truck driver for a local
meat company. Worried that Jos£ Luis might
actually try to marry Silvia, she hires the driver
to seduce the young woman, only to find her
self hopelessly infatuated with him herself.
What follows is a series of passionate ex
changes — Silvia with Jos£, Conchita with
Raul, Raul with Silvia, Jos£ Luis with Silvia's
mother Carmen (Anna Galiena) and finally
Silvia with Jos£ Luis' father — that ultimately
end in disaster. Most remarkable about
"Jamon Jamon" is the relative ease with which
Luna transforms his fantastic scenario into
something entertainingly plausible.
The affairs of his twisted characters feel
saner than they should because Luna fore
grounds them in a world where everything
seems out of balance. Although the ultimate
profundity of "Jamon Jamon" is never thor
oughly realized, its tragic elements coupled
with its strongeroticism keep it strides ahead
of the majority of Hollywood's so-called "sex
revelations."
