# A 						Perfect World
## 
### 
Although you might go to "A Perfect
World" because of the star-studded mega
power of Clint Eastwood and Kevin Costner,
you should stay because of relative unknown
T.J. Lowther.
A powerful physical and personal journey
across Texas in 1963, the film opens with
Butch Haynes (Costner) breaking out of jail
with his psychotic cell-mate Terry (Keith
Szarabajka). As they escape, Haynes tells
Terry that he is breaking out with him solely
as a matter of convenience and that they are
not friends. It does not take long to see why.
Terry proceeds to botch what Haynes had
hoped would be a smooth escape, thus forc
ing them to take 7-year-old Phillip (Lowther)
as a hostage. As the three travel, Haynes' atti
tude toward Phillip is more of protector than
kidnapper, protecting the boy from abuse.
Soon the good guys get in the picture, as
Red Garnett (Eastwood) of the Texas Rangers
leads the manhunt. Unfortunately, the cops
are secondary to the film, with Eastwood
merely occupying his stereotypical role. Gar
nett, conducting a search by his own rules

and sometimes belittling his perceptive
criminology assistant Sally Gerber (Laura
Dern) solely because she is a woman.
In contrast, Haynes develops a surprising
ly immediate and natural tie to the boy, be
coming the father figure that neither of them
ever had. The two develop a rapport that
makes it easy to forget that one is a hostage
and the other a criminal as the film confronts
the issues surrounding child abuse. As their
characters become more complex, Costner
and Lowther truly begin to shine as actors.
Although "A Perfect World" starts off
rather imperfectly, it is nice to see Costner
take a non-hero role. But it is Lowther who
gives an amazing performance as a boy thrust
into adulthood and awful reality.
Eastwood's direction provides the audi
ence with some amazing images, though it
takes a little too long to develop and never re
ally focuses enough on character develop
ment. But in the end, "A Perfect World"
leaves us with some thought-provoking
scenes concerning the goodness and evil
which lie within the human spirit.
If "A Perfect World" is not quite perfect
drama, it is a "forgivable" excuse to delay
studying for a few hours.
