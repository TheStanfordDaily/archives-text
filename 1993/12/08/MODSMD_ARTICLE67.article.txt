# Deadfall
## 
### 
And the worst-picture-directed-by-a
filmmaker's-brat award goes to Christopher
Coppola for the pathetic "Deadfall."
Actually, his was a surprise upset: Jennifer
Lynch's "Boxing Helena," in all of its contro
versial campiness, established her early on as
the probable victor. (The fact that she's David
Lynch's daughter just adds the frosting to the
cake.)
But Trimark, truly a film distributor's film
distributor, wasn't going to let that happen.
They realized that Francis Ford Coppola's
son had a tale so poorly organized that even a
competent cast — Michael Biehn, Nicolas
Cage, Sarah Trigger, James Coburn and
Charlie Sheen — and noir-ish influences
couldn't save it from critical oblivion.
A real shoo-in for the prize.
Joe (Biehn) is a con artist with an "all-
American" face and a heart of gold ... until
he accidentally kills his father (Coburn) dur
ing a scam that calls for a mock shoot-out.
Distraught and confused, Joe decides to head
down to Los Angeles, to find the uncle he
never knew.

Uncle Lou turns out to be on the up and
up ... he also turns out to be the spitting
image of his brother; and like Joe's father,
Lou reels the kid into helping him run a
scam on a rich jeweler. Joe, normally down
for whatever, hesitates because the heist in
volves another mock shoot-out. Guess who
he's supposed to "shoot" this time? Though
he commits, he isn't sure he's up to the chal
lenge — running away with the dame in the
red dress (Trigger) looks ever so much more
inviting.
Though equally awful, what distinguishes
"Boxing Helena" from "Deadfall" is the enter
tainment factor. While "Boxing" is a good time
in spite of itself, "Deadfall" is an exercise in
non-filmmaking — even though its visual
style suggests that Coppola is truly Francis' son.
What's most offensive, however, is "Dead
fall" 's shameful handling of traditional noir
elements. Voice-over narration, funky cam
era work, a Hitchcockian derived score ...
it's all in there, and all used to no real effect.
Adding battery to assault, the screenplay is
full of the vilest kind of non-realistic dia
logue: the kind that can't be made believable.
