Addams Family Values
The creepy and kooky ones are
back — Morticia, Gomez and the
rest — as well a few new ones, such
as baby Pubert. In "Addams Family
Values," strong acting and macabre
costuming make up for a total lack
of plot direction. While seeing
Wednesday's traumas at a summer
camp for blondes creates some
chuckles, many of the jokes fall off
the fence on the side of bad taste
So if you want to see warped mon
sters posited as the ideal family,
watch "90210" instead PG
The Age of Innocence
Martin Scorsese may have learned
how to hobnob with the upper crust
of 19th-century New York, but he's
left his heart in 20th-century Little
Italy Daniel Day-Lewis shines as
one-third of author Edith Wharton's
bizarre love triangle, but the script
and direction hang Michelle Pfeiffer
and Winona Ryder out to dry. The
verdict: aesthetic masterpiece, emo
tional misfire PG
The Beverly Hillbillies
While definitely in the "stupid" film
making genre, the nostalgia value of
the "Hillbillies" and several comical
ly inspired performances (Cloris
Leachman, Lily Tomlin, Diedrich
Bader) save the movie from utter un

acceptability. Despite its flaws, "The
Beverly Hillbillies" remains a fun trip
through the time-warp machine. PG
Carlito's Way
Reuniting for the first time since
"Scarface," Al Pacino and Brian De
Palma come well-equipped to suc
cessfully challenge Scorsese's
trademark territory of bullets and the
Bronx. Strong performances by Pa
cino as ex-con Carlo Brigante and
by Sean Penn as his lawyer provide
a chemistry that carries the movie
past the limits of predictability and
the mob genre. R
Cool Runnings
Disney asks the question, "Is there
any sport a black man or woman
can't excel in?" and answers with a
comically resounding "No." Unfortu
nately it's not the movie its filmmak
ers (Michael Goldberg, Dawn Steel)
believe it to be. The real-life struggle
of the first Jamaican bobsled team
in history, it's cute,warm and fuzzy
.. . provided you like being paraded
around like a puppet. Still, it's the
kind of light-hearted family fare
that's hard to dismiss entirely PG
Demolition Man
Snipes, Stallone, guns. Despite in
tense predictability, "Demolition
Man" offers enqrossing visual enter

tainment complete with gads of vio
lence. Director Marco Bambilla uses
a cheap script and two multi-million
dollar actors to satirically poke fun at
brutality's integral role in our soci
ety Surprisingly, he creates some
thing worth watching. R
Farewell My Concubine
The directorial method of shooting
through objects such as fire and
smoke aptly reflects the confusion of
China's ever-changing political situ
ation over the film's 32 years Histo
ry is the dominant character, contin
ually interrupting and changing the
lives of the three main characters
and the Peking Opera of which they
are both a portion and a reflection R
Fatal Instinct
Although it seems like it would be
just another parody of a tired film
genre, "Fatal Instinct" manages to
pull itself into the level of sopho
moric humor that is always appreci
ated — given the right state of mind
Featuring a strong cast and refer
ences to almost every '80s block
buster, it almost makes you want to
see "Jurassic Fugitive." PG-13
Fearless
In a suspended moment when dis
aster strikes, when the end is un
avoidable. it is then that one can

say, "This is it — this is the moment
of death — I have no fear." Jeff
Bridges and Rosie Perez are justi
fied in fearlessness because their
superb portrayals of grief comple
ment a strong script and remarkable
directing to produce a film that flies
high. R
Flesh and Bone
A sobering look at the connection
between past actions and future
possibilities, this film is no typical
fairy-tale-ending flick. The strength
of the film lies in a realistic story with
characters that the audience can get
to know and its ability to make audi
ences think about serious issues in
a very un-Hollywood manner. R
A Home of Our Own
A plot focused on a single mother
and her six kids hauling out to Idaho
in 1962 in search of their own huUaC
has the potential to be merely an ex
ercise in heavy schlock. Fortunately,
the inspiring performance of Kathy
Bates, the realistic looks of the chil
dren and the absence of predictable
endings help the film avoid this cine
matic pitfall and, together, create a
real family picture. PG
House of Angels
An enchanting Swedish comedy
about inter-personal relationships in
a small town, "House of Angels"
gains its humor from the conflicts
between the seemingly staid towns
people and the shocking behavior of
"foreigners" in their midst Overcom
ing a stereotypical plot, strong act
ing and a focus on the unique pecu
liarities of small town life make the
film surprisingly relevant R
Josh & S.A.M.
Sibling power reigns supreme in this
flick about two brothers who are the
victims of divorce To escape Mom's
slimy new boyfriend and the evil
stepmom on Dad's side, they run
away, telling lies and getting into
scrapes all along. The boys' adven
tures and relationship give the film
some feel-good, nostalgia-inducing
moments on its way to a predictably
happy ending. Humor, good acting
and beautiful scenery make the film
a worthwhile investment — at least
for those under 12. PG
The Joy Luck Club
Grandiose, epic, tear-jerking and
gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous
this adaptation of Amy Tan's best
seller is all of the above. Moving de
spite its blatant commercialism,
"The Joy Luck Club" does a splen
did job of bringing the novel to life
and marks a monumental first for
Asian-Americans in Hollywood R

M. Butterfly
This adaptation of David Henry
Hwang's play could have been por
trayed as a look at a naive French
diplomat deceived into kinky sex by
a conniving Chinese freak or a
thoughtful, if scathing, criticism of
popular perceptions of Asian
women and men Fortunately,
Hwang's collaboration on the
screenplay and the ingenious deci
sion to cast John Lone as Song Lil
mg preserve the intended societal
critique R
Malice
Director Harold Becker attempts to
craft a suspenseful story but the re
sult is a series of complicated twists
that never seems to end. Plot turns
and acting are so exaggerated that
"Malice" seems almost like a come
dy Whatever potential the film had
is lost because both writers and di
rectors try to include too many un
surprising surprise elements and
too much canned dialogue R
Nightmare Before Christmas
Tim Burton's and the Walt Disney
Corporation s different management
styles lead to a remarkably uneven
film — the combination of Burton's
brilliant stop-action and Disney's
corporate caution Despite potential

ly intriguing characters, the film is
cold, dry and unmoving — plotless
and heartless PG
The Piano
The prize piece from Cannes sings
with the performances of Holly
Hunter. Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill
in a masterful tale of beauty and
beasts. Exploring the sexual under
tones to the myth that the Disney
film could only hint at, Jane Campi
on proves her worth as a writer and
director while coloring the rough
grays between good and evil R
Remains of the Day
Possessed with ineluctable British
reserve, Anthony Hopkins plays a
manservant who suddenly finds his
code of loyalty no longer tenable in
1930s Britain Hopkins gives an in
credible performance that is self-re
strained in word and deed, but nev
ertheless packed with painfully raw
emotions More riveting than
"Howard's End," "The Remains of
the Day" is a wrenching love story, a
war movie and above all a sympa
theiic portrait of a decent though
flawed human being seeking to bet
ter his life. PG
Robocop 3
Same plot, same director, worse
acting, worse script, worse star This

time around, Robocop is pro
grammed to work for an evil corpo
ration, short-circuits and begins to
help the victims Numerous scenes
copied directly from other films and
a script too shallow for any real
theme lead to the hope that Robo
cop will short-circuit again and turn
on his producers R
Ruby in Paradise
The feature-film debut of Ashley
Judd as Ruby Lee Gissing — a
woman who escapes Tennessee to
avoid getting stuck in the same old
rut Although the action is slow, the
real evolution comes in Ruby's
stream of consciousness as materi
alized by her journal writings and
through Judd's strong performance.
However, the film loses some of its
charm by veering away from psy
chological drama and focusing on
the heroine's financial troubles —
the least interesting and original as
pect of the plot R
The Secret Garden
A fine adaptation of the well-loved
novel. Director Agnieszka Holland
("Europa, Europa") is well-attuned
to its darker elements — abandon
ment, incest and illness — as well
as its metaphor for puberty and sex
ual awakening. She extracts fine
performances from the entire cast

without overly sentimentalizing the
story. You might not be moved to
tears, but this film will certainly hold
your interest G
Shortcuts
Unfortunately genius does not al
ways produce quality work, and
Robert Altman's lat'est three-hour
epic is proof of that principle. A bit
tersweet ode to life in decaying Los
Angeles based on Raymond Carv
er's writings, Altman's series of vi
gnettes sporting 22 characters ne
glects its main character — the city
of Los Angeles What remains is a
cutaway diagram of Altman's direc
torial prowess and a bunch of sto
ries more entertainingly busy then
poignantly literary. R
Three Musketeers
Retaining only the basic premise
from the literary version of "The
Three Musketeers," Disney's formu
la of cute actors and a Bryan Adams
theme song doesn't work the sec
ond time around. A lack of talent and
a horrible screenplay of one-liners
punctuated by sex and violence
make us wish the producers had
bothered to read the book — or that
the highlight, the deliciously devious
presence of Tim Curry as Richelieu,
would kill the Musketeers and there
by end our misery. PG

camp for blondes creates some
chuckles, many of the jokes fall off
the fence on the side of bad taste
So if you want to see warped mon
sters posited as the ideal family,
watch "90210" instead PG
The Age of Innocence
Martin Scorsese may have learned
how to hobnob with the upper crust
of 19th-century New York, but he's
left his heart in 20th-century Little
Italy Daniel Day-Lewis shines as
one-third of author Edith Wharton's
bizarre love triangle, but the script
and direction hang Michelle Pfeiffer
and Winona Ryder out to dry. The
verdict: aesthetic masterpiece, emo
tional misfire PG
The Beverly Hillbillies
While definitely in the "stupid" film
making genre, the nostalgia value of
the "Hillbillies" and several comical
ly inspired performances (Cloris
Leachman, Lily Tomlin, Diedrich
Bader) save the movie from utter un

acceptability. Despite its flaws, "The
Beverly Hillbillies" remains a fun trip
through the time-warp machine. PG
Carlito's Way
Reuniting for the first time since
"Scarface," Al Pacino and Brian De
Palma come well-equipped to suc
cessfully challenge Scorsese's
trademark territory of bullets and the
Bronx. Strong performances by Pa
cino as ex-con Carlo Brigante and
by Sean Penn as his lawyer provide
a chemistry that carries the movie
past the limits of predictability and
the mob genre. R
Cool Runnings
Disney asks the question, "Is there
any sport a black man or woman
can't excel in?" and answers with a
comically resounding "No." Unfortu
nately it's not the movie its filmmak
ers (Michael Goldberg, Dawn Steel)
believe it to be. The real-life struggle
of the first Jamaican bobsled team
in history, it's cute,warm and fuzzy
.. . provided you like being paraded
around like a puppet. Still, it's the
kind of light-hearted family fare
that's hard to dismiss entirely PG
Demolition Man
Snipes, Stallone, guns. Despite in
tense predictability, "Demolition
Man" offers enqrossing visual enter

tainment complete with gads of vio
lence. Director Marco Bambilla uses
a cheap script and two multi-million
dollar actors to satirically poke fun at
brutality's integral role in our soci
ety Surprisingly, he creates some
thing worth watching. R
Farewell My Concubine
The directorial method of shooting
through objects such as fire and
smoke aptly reflects the confusion of
China's ever-changing political situ
ation over the film's 32 years Histo
ry is the dominant character, contin
ually interrupting and changing the
lives of the three main characters
and the Peking Opera of which they
are both a portion and a reflection R
Fatal Instinct
Although it seems like it would be
just another parody of a tired film
genre, "Fatal Instinct" manages to
pull itself into the level of sopho
moric humor that is always appreci
ated — given the right state of mind
Featuring a strong cast and refer
ences to almost every '80s block
buster, it almost makes you want to
see "Jurassic Fugitive." PG-13
Fearless
In a suspended moment when dis
aster strikes, when the end is un
avoidable. it is then that one can

say, "This is it — this is the moment
of death — I have no fear." Jeff
Bridges and Rosie Perez are justi
fied in fearlessness because their
superb portrayals of grief comple
ment a strong script and remarkable
directing to produce a film that flies
high. R
Flesh and Bone
A sobering look at the connection
between past actions and future
possibilities, this film is no typical
fairy-tale-ending flick. The strength
of the film lies in a realistic story with
characters that the audience can get
to know and its ability to make audi
ences think about serious issues in
a very un-Hollywood manner. R
A Home of Our Own
A plot focused on a single mother
and her six kids hauling out to Idaho
in 1962 in search of their own huUaC
has the potential to be merely an ex
ercise in heavy schlock. Fortunately,
the inspiring performance of Kathy
Bates, the realistic looks of the chil
dren and the absence of predictable
endings help the film avoid this cine
matic pitfall and, together, create a
real family picture. PG
House of Angels
An enchanting Swedish comedy
about inter-personal relationships in
a small town, "House of Angels"
gains its humor from the conflicts
between the seemingly staid towns
people and the shocking behavior of
"foreigners" in their midst Overcom
ing a stereotypical plot, strong act
ing and a focus on the unique pecu
liarities of small town life make the
film surprisingly relevant R
Josh & S.A.M.
Sibling power reigns supreme in this
flick about two brothers who are the
victims of divorce To escape Mom's
slimy new boyfriend and the evil
stepmom on Dad's side, they run
away, telling lies and getting into
scrapes all along. The boys' adven
tures and relationship give the film
some feel-good, nostalgia-inducing
moments on its way to a predictably
happy ending. Humor, good acting
and beautiful scenery make the film
a worthwhile investment — at least
for those under 12. PG
The Joy Luck Club
Grandiose, epic, tear-jerking and
gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous
this adaptation of Amy Tan's best
seller is all of the above. Moving de
spite its blatant commercialism,
"The Joy Luck Club" does a splen
did job of bringing the novel to life
and marks a monumental first for
Asian-Americans in Hollywood R

M. Butterfly
This adaptation of David Henry
Hwang's play could have been por
trayed as a look at a naive French
diplomat deceived into kinky sex by
a conniving Chinese freak or a
thoughtful, if scathing, criticism of
popular perceptions of Asian
women and men Fortunately,
Hwang's collaboration on the
screenplay and the ingenious deci
sion to cast John Lone as Song Lil
mg preserve the intended societal
critique R
Malice
Director Harold Becker attempts to
craft a suspenseful story but the re
sult is a series of complicated twists
that never seems to end. Plot turns
and acting are so exaggerated that
"Malice" seems almost like a come
dy Whatever potential the film had
is lost because both writers and di
rectors try to include too many un
surprising surprise elements and
too much canned dialogue R
Nightmare Before Christmas
Tim Burton's and the Walt Disney
Corporation s different management
styles lead to a remarkably uneven
film — the combination of Burton's
brilliant stop-action and Disney's
corporate caution Despite potential

ly intriguing characters, the film is
cold, dry and unmoving — plotless
and heartless PG
The Piano
The prize piece from Cannes sings
with the performances of Holly
Hunter. Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill
in a masterful tale of beauty and
beasts. Exploring the sexual under
tones to the myth that the Disney
film could only hint at, Jane Campi
on proves her worth as a writer and
director while coloring the rough
grays between good and evil R
Remains of the Day
Possessed with ineluctable British
reserve, Anthony Hopkins plays a
manservant who suddenly finds his
code of loyalty no longer tenable in
1930s Britain Hopkins gives an in
credible performance that is self-re
strained in word and deed, but nev
ertheless packed with painfully raw
emotions More riveting than
"Howard's End," "The Remains of
the Day" is a wrenching love story, a
war movie and above all a sympa
theiic portrait of a decent though
flawed human being seeking to bet
ter his life. PG
Robocop 3
Same plot, same director, worse
acting, worse script, worse star This

time around, Robocop is pro
grammed to work for an evil corpo
ration, short-circuits and begins to
help the victims Numerous scenes
copied directly from other films and
a script too shallow for any real
theme lead to the hope that Robo
cop will short-circuit again and turn
on his producers R
Ruby in Paradise
The feature-film debut of Ashley
Judd as Ruby Lee Gissing — a
woman who escapes Tennessee to
avoid getting stuck in the same old
rut Although the action is slow, the
real evolution comes in Ruby's
stream of consciousness as materi
alized by her journal writings and
through Judd's strong performance.
However, the film loses some of its
charm by veering away from psy
chological drama and focusing on
the heroine's financial troubles —
the least interesting and original as
pect of the plot R
The Secret Garden
A fine adaptation of the well-loved
novel. Director Agnieszka Holland
("Europa, Europa") is well-attuned
to its darker elements — abandon
ment, incest and illness — as well
as its metaphor for puberty and sex
ual awakening. She extracts fine
performances from the entire cast

without overly sentimentalizing the
story. You might not be moved to
tears, but this film will certainly hold
your interest G
Shortcuts
Unfortunately genius does not al
ways produce quality work, and
Robert Altman's lat'est three-hour
epic is proof of that principle. A bit
tersweet ode to life in decaying Los
Angeles based on Raymond Carv
er's writings, Altman's series of vi
gnettes sporting 22 characters ne
glects its main character — the city
of Los Angeles What remains is a
cutaway diagram of Altman's direc
torial prowess and a bunch of sto
ries more entertainingly busy then
poignantly literary. R
Three Musketeers
Retaining only the basic premise
from the literary version of "The
Three Musketeers," Disney's formu
la of cute actors and a Bryan Adams
theme song doesn't work the sec
ond time around. A lack of talent and
a horrible screenplay of one-liners
punctuated by sex and violence
make us wish the producers had
bothered to read the book — or that
the highlight, the deliciously devious
presence of Tim Curry as Richelieu,
would kill the Musketeers and there
by end our misery. PG
Addams Family Values
The creepy and kooky ones are
back — Morticia, Gomez and the
rest — as well a few new ones, such
as baby Pubert. In "Addams Family
Values," strong acting and macabre
costuming make up for a total lack
of plot direction. While seeing
Wednesday's traumas at a summer
camp for blondes creates some
chuckles, many of the jokes fall off
the fence on the side of bad taste
So if you want to see warped mon

how to hobnob with the upper crust
of 19th-century New York, but he's
left his heart in 20th-century Little
Italy Daniel Day-Lewis shines as
one-third of author Edith Wharton's
bizarre love triangle, but the script
and direction hang Michelle Pfeiffer
and Winona Ryder out to dry. The
verdict: aesthetic masterpiece, emo
tional misfire PG
The Beverly Hillbillies
While definitely in the "stupid" film
making genre, the nostalgia value of
the "Hillbillies" and several comical
ly inspired performances (Cloris
Leachman, Lily Tomlin, Diedrich
Bader) save the movie from utter un

acceptability. Despite its flaws, "The
Beverly Hillbillies" remains a fun trip
through the time-warp machine. PG
Carlito's Way
Reuniting for the first time since
"Scarface," Al Pacino and Brian De
Palma come well-equipped to suc
cessfully challenge Scorsese's
trademark territory of bullets and the
Bronx. Strong performances by Pa
cino as ex-con Carlo Brigante and
by Sean Penn as his lawyer provide
a chemistry that carries the movie
past the limits of predictability and
the mob genre. R
Cool Runnings
Disney asks the question, "Is there
any sport a black man or woman
can't excel in?" and answers with a
comically resounding "No." Unfortu
nately it's not the movie its filmmak
ers (Michael Goldberg, Dawn Steel)
believe it to be. The real-life struggle
of the first Jamaican bobsled team
in history, it's cute,warm and fuzzy
.. . provided you like being paraded
around like a puppet. Still, it's the
kind of light-hearted family fare
that's hard to dismiss entirely PG
Demolition Man
Snipes, Stallone, guns. Despite in
tense predictability, "Demolition
Man" offers enqrossing visual enter

tainment complete with gads of vio
lence. Director Marco Bambilla uses
a cheap script and two multi-million
dollar actors to satirically poke fun at
brutality's integral role in our soci
ety Surprisingly, he creates some
thing worth watching. R
Farewell My Concubine
The directorial method of shooting
through objects such as fire and
smoke aptly reflects the confusion of
China's ever-changing political situ
ation over the film's 32 years Histo
ry is the dominant character, contin
ually interrupting and changing the
lives of the three main characters
and the Peking Opera of which they
are both a portion and a reflection R
Fatal Instinct
Although it seems like it would be
just another parody of a tired film
genre, "Fatal Instinct" manages to
pull itself into the level of sopho
moric humor that is always appreci
ated — given the right state of mind
Featuring a strong cast and refer
ences to almost every '80s block
buster, it almost makes you want to
see "Jurassic Fugitive." PG-13
Fearless
In a suspended moment when dis
aster strikes, when the end is un
avoidable. it is then that one can

say, "This is it — this is the moment
of death — I have no fear." Jeff
Bridges and Rosie Perez are justi
fied in fearlessness because their
superb portrayals of grief comple
ment a strong script and remarkable
directing to produce a film that flies
high. R
Flesh and Bone
A sobering look at the connection
between past actions and future
possibilities, this film is no typical
fairy-tale-ending flick. The strength
of the film lies in a realistic story with
characters that the audience can get
to know and its ability to make audi
ences think about serious issues in
a very un-Hollywood manner. R
A Home of Our Own
A plot focused on a single mother
and her six kids hauling out to Idaho
in 1962 in search of their own huUaC
has the potential to be merely an ex
ercise in heavy schlock. Fortunately,
the inspiring performance of Kathy
Bates, the realistic looks of the chil
dren and the absence of predictable
endings help the film avoid this cine
matic pitfall and, together, create a
real family picture. PG
House of Angels
An enchanting Swedish comedy
about inter-personal relationships in
a small town, "House of Angels"
gains its humor from the conflicts
between the seemingly staid towns
people and the shocking behavior of
"foreigners" in their midst Overcom
ing a stereotypical plot, strong act
ing and a focus on the unique pecu
liarities of small town life make the
film surprisingly relevant R
Josh & S.A.M.
Sibling power reigns supreme in this
flick about two brothers who are the
victims of divorce To escape Mom's
slimy new boyfriend and the evil
stepmom on Dad's side, they run
away, telling lies and getting into
scrapes all along. The boys' adven
tures and relationship give the film
some feel-good, nostalgia-inducing
moments on its way to a predictably
happy ending. Humor, good acting
and beautiful scenery make the film
a worthwhile investment — at least
for those under 12. PG
The Joy Luck Club
Grandiose, epic, tear-jerking and
gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous
this adaptation of Amy Tan's best
seller is all of the above. Moving de
spite its blatant commercialism,
"The Joy Luck Club" does a splen
did job of bringing the novel to life
and marks a monumental first for
Asian-Americans in Hollywood R

M. Butterfly
This adaptation of David Henry
Hwang's play could have been por
trayed as a look at a naive French
diplomat deceived into kinky sex by
a conniving Chinese freak or a
thoughtful, if scathing, criticism of
popular perceptions of Asian
women and men Fortunately,
Hwang's collaboration on the
screenplay and the ingenious deci
sion to cast John Lone as Song Lil
mg preserve the intended societal
critique R
Malice
Director Harold Becker attempts to
craft a suspenseful story but the re
sult is a series of complicated twists
that never seems to end. Plot turns
and acting are so exaggerated that
"Malice" seems almost like a come
dy Whatever potential the film had
is lost because both writers and di
rectors try to include too many un
surprising surprise elements and
too much canned dialogue R
Nightmare Before Christmas
Tim Burton's and the Walt Disney
Corporation s different management
styles lead to a remarkably uneven
film — the combination of Burton's
brilliant stop-action and Disney's
corporate caution Despite potential

ly intriguing characters, the film is
cold, dry and unmoving — plotless
and heartless PG
The Piano
The prize piece from Cannes sings
with the performances of Holly
Hunter. Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill
in a masterful tale of beauty and
beasts. Exploring the sexual under
tones to the myth that the Disney
film could only hint at, Jane Campi
on proves her worth as a writer and
director while coloring the rough
grays between good and evil R
Remains of the Day
Possessed with ineluctable British
reserve, Anthony Hopkins plays a
manservant who suddenly finds his
code of loyalty no longer tenable in
1930s Britain Hopkins gives an in
credible performance that is self-re
strained in word and deed, but nev
ertheless packed with painfully raw
emotions More riveting than
"Howard's End," "The Remains of
the Day" is a wrenching love story, a
war movie and above all a sympa
theiic portrait of a decent though
flawed human being seeking to bet
ter his life. PG
Robocop 3
Same plot, same director, worse
acting, worse script, worse star This

time around, Robocop is pro
grammed to work for an evil corpo
ration, short-circuits and begins to
help the victims Numerous scenes
copied directly from other films and
a script too shallow for any real
theme lead to the hope that Robo
cop will short-circuit again and turn
on his producers R
Ruby in Paradise
The feature-film debut of Ashley
Judd as Ruby Lee Gissing — a
woman who escapes Tennessee to
avoid getting stuck in the same old
rut Although the action is slow, the
real evolution comes in Ruby's
stream of consciousness as materi
alized by her journal writings and
through Judd's strong performance.
However, the film loses some of its
charm by veering away from psy
chological drama and focusing on
the heroine's financial troubles —
the least interesting and original as
pect of the plot R
The Secret Garden
A fine adaptation of the well-loved
novel. Director Agnieszka Holland
("Europa, Europa") is well-attuned
to its darker elements — abandon
ment, incest and illness — as well
as its metaphor for puberty and sex
ual awakening. She extracts fine
performances from the entire cast

without overly sentimentalizing the
story. You might not be moved to
tears, but this film will certainly hold
your interest G
Shortcuts
Unfortunately genius does not al
ways produce quality work, and
Robert Altman's lat'est three-hour
epic is proof of that principle. A bit
tersweet ode to life in decaying Los
Angeles based on Raymond Carv
er's writings, Altman's series of vi
gnettes sporting 22 characters ne
glects its main character — the city
of Los Angeles What remains is a
cutaway diagram of Altman's direc
torial prowess and a bunch of sto
ries more entertainingly busy then
poignantly literary. R
Three Musketeers
Retaining only the basic premise
from the literary version of "The
Three Musketeers," Disney's formu
la of cute actors and a Bryan Adams
theme song doesn't work the sec
ond time around. A lack of talent and
a horrible screenplay of one-liners
punctuated by sex and violence
make us wish the producers had
bothered to read the book — or that
the highlight, the deliciously devious
presence of Tim Curry as Richelieu,
would kill the Musketeers and there
by end our misery. PG
