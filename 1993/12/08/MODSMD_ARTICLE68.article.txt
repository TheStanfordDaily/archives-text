Addams Family Values
The creepy and kooky ones are
back — Morticia, Gomez and the
rest — as well a few new ones, such
as baby Pubert. In "Addams Family
Values," strong acting and macabre
costuming make up for a total lack
of plot direction. While seeing
Wednesday's traumas at a summer
camp for blondes creates some
chuckles, many of the jokes fall off
the fence on the side of bad taste
So if you want to see warped mon
sters posited as the ideal family,
watch "90210" instead PG
The Age of Innocence
Martin Scorsese may have learned
how to hobnob with the upper crust
of 19th-century New York, but he's
left his heart in 20th-century Little
Italy Daniel Day-Lewis shines as
one-third of author Edith Wharton's
bizarre love triangle, but the script
and direction hang Michelle Pfeiffer
and Winona Ryder out to dry. The
verdict: aesthetic masterpiece, emo
tional misfire PG
The Beverly Hillbillies
While definitely in the "stupid" film
making genre, the nostalgia value of
the "Hillbillies" and several comical
ly inspired performances (Cloris
Leachman, Lily Tomlin, Diedrich
Bader) save the movie from utter un

acceptability. Despite its flaws, "The
Beverly Hillbillies" remains a fun trip
through the time-warp machine. PG
Carlito's Way
Reuniting for the first time since
"Scarface," Al Pacino and Brian De
Palma come well-equipped to suc
cessfully challenge Scorsese's
trademark territory of bullets and the
Bronx. Strong performances by Pa
cino as ex-con Carlo Brigante and
by Sean Penn as his lawyer provide
a chemistry that carries the movie
past the limits of predictability and
the mob genre. R
Cool Runnings
Disney asks the question, "Is there
any sport a black man or woman
can't excel in?" and answers with a
comically resounding "No." Unfortu
nately it's not the movie its filmmak
ers (Michael Goldberg, Dawn Steel)
believe it to be. The real-life struggle
of the first Jamaican bobsled team
in history, it's cute,warm and fuzzy
.. . provided you like being paraded
around like a puppet. Still, it's the
kind of light-hearted family fare
that's hard to dismiss entirely PG
Demolition Man
Snipes, Stallone, guns. Despite in
tense predictability, "Demolition
Man" offers enqrossing visual enter

tainment complete with gads of vio
lence. Director Marco Bambilla uses
a cheap script and two multi-million
dollar actors to satirically poke fun at
brutality's integral role in our soci
ety Surprisingly, he creates some
thing worth watching. R
Farewell My Concubine
The directorial method of shooting
through objects such as fire and
smoke aptly reflects the confusion of
China's ever-changing political situ
ation over the film's 32 years Histo
ry is the dominant character, contin
ually interrupting and changing the
lives of the three main characters
and the Peking Opera of which they
are both a portion and a reflection R
Fatal Instinct
Although it seems like it would be
just another parody of a tired film
genre, "Fatal Instinct" manages to
pull itself into the level of sopho
moric humor that is always appreci
ated — given the right state of mind
Featuring a strong cast and refer
ences to almost every '80s block
buster, it almost makes you want to
see "Jurassic Fugitive." PG-13
Fearless
In a suspended moment when dis
aster strikes, when the end is un
avoidable. it is then that one can

say, "This is it — this is the moment
of death — I have no fear." Jeff
Bridges and Rosie Perez are justi
fied in fearlessness because their
superb portrayals of grief comple
ment a strong script and remarkable
directing to produce a film that flies
high. R
Flesh and Bone
A sobering look at the connection
between past actions and future
possibilities, this film is no typical
fairy-tale-ending flick. The strength
of the film lies in a realistic story with
characters that the audience can get
to know and its ability to make audi
ences think about serious issues in
a very un-Hollywood manner. R
A Home of Our Own
A plot focused on a single mother
and her six kids hauling out to Idaho
in 1962 in search of their own huUaC
has the potential to be merely an ex
ercise in heavy schlock. Fortunately,
the inspiring performance of Kathy
Bates, the realistic looks of the chil
dren and the absence of predictable
endings help the film avoid this cine
matic pitfall and, together, create a
real family picture. PG
House of Angels
An enchanting Swedish comedy
about inter-personal relationships in
