# Alumni singing a new tune in a cappella group
## 
### Allison Short Staff writer 
Hiking, swimming and camp
fires are all traditional parts of
the Stanford Sierra Camp for
alumni, but this year junior Rob
Zeaske brought a long-time Farm
tradition to the mountains — a
cappella singing.
And after spending the sum
mer be-bopping to the oldies, sev
eral alumni decided to form their
own a cappella group: Tallacap
pella.
Zeaske, who volunteered as a
camp counselor at Fallen Leaf
Lake, came up with the idea of
holding a cappella classes for in
terested alumni throughout all
12 weeks of camp. About 17 alum
ni at each four-day camp session
perfected the song "Brown Eyed
Girl." Fach group performed it on
the last day of their camp session,
with Zeaske as the lead singer.
By the end of the summer,
when the volleyball net was
packed away and the last camp
fire extinguished, the alumni
were still hooked on those finger
snapping a cappella tunes.

dicants, continues to help a group
of 18 adults — most of whom are
Stanford alumni — sing a cappel
la. The former campers named
their group after the mountain
they saw from their practice room:
Mt. Tallac.
Debbie Duncan, Class of '76,
came up with the idea of forming
Tallacappella — with Zeaske as
their director — after sensing a
continued interest in a cappella
singing among other alumni after
the camps ended.
Duncan and her co-organizer,
staff member Terry Gordon-Gam
ble, called various singers from
the different summer camps and
eventually organized the group.
"It was the highlight of my
week at camp," said Stephanie
Agnew, Class of '79. "We enjoyed
it so much that we wanted to con
tinue."
The group made their public
debut singing "Brown Eyed Girl"
in October at the alumni reunion
weekend.
"It's a nice group," said mem
ber Joanne Jacobs, Class of '74.
"Nobody's a brilliant singer so we
can all relax."
The classes Zeaske led over the
summer were geared toward those
alumni without much singing
experience who wanted to learn
the basics.
"They're totally enthusiastic
about singing," he said.
Zeaske says he finds his role in
Tallacappella is very different
than in the Mendicants. Practice
is more a "relaxation hour than a

work hour," he said.
For the members of Tallacap
pella, singing a cappella is some
thing that has appealed to them
for years, but they either didn't
have the time or experience to join
a group during school.
"Stanford had so much to offer
and we were so busy that we
didn't have much extra time,"
Duncan said.
"I was never good enough to do
anything like (join an a cappella
group)," Jacobs said. "It's some
thing you don't get much of a
chance to do after you get out of
school. I learned that if you're will
ing to make a fool out of yourself,
there are so many things to do."
While Zeaske selects the songs,
he ultimately tailors the group's
repertoire to whatever the mem
bers want to sing. In addition to
"Brown Eyed Girl," Tallacappella
is working on holiday and contem
porary songs, such as "Light One
Candle" and"I Get Around." The
group performs upbeat songs
because "Rob likes songs with silly
lyrics," Jacobs said.
Tallacappella performed earli
er this month and may also plan
informal holiday performances at
members' homes. In the mean
time, the group practices every
Friday night on campus and is
trying to schedule about one or
two regular performances each
quarter.
"We're going to keep it pretty
recreational, but part of the fun is
working toward something,"
Zeaske said. "As long as the inter
est keeps up, we'll keep doing it."
"I've always wanted to sing,"
Jacobs said. "And I've finally
learned that at my age it's okay if
I'm not great."
