# Alumni singing a new tune in a cappella group
## 
### Allison Short Staff writer 
Hiking, swimming and camp
fires are all traditional parts of
the Stanford Sierra Camp for
alumni, but this year junior Rob
Zeaske brought a long-time Farm
tradition to the mountains â€” a
cappella singing.
And after spending the sum
mer be-bopping to the oldies, sev
eral alumni decided to form their
own a cappella group: Tallacap
pella.
Zeaske, who volunteered as a
camp counselor at Fallen Leaf
Lake, came up with the idea of
holding a cappella classes for in
terested alumni throughout all
12 weeks of camp. About 17 alum
ni at each four-day camp session
perfected the song "Brown Eyed
Girl." Fach group performed it on
the last day of their camp session,
with Zeaske as the lead singer.
By the end of the summer,
when the volleyball net was
packed away and the last camp
fire extinguished, the alumni
were still hooked on those finger
snapping a cappella tunes.
