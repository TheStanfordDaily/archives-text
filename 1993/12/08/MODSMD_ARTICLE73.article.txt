Once a hidden taboo, cross
dressing has become as common
on the silver screen as bad food at
Lagunita. In "M. Butterfly," "Mrs.
Doubtfire" and"The Ballad of
Little Jo," cross-dressing has given
Hollywood a chance to let its hair
down.
Ever since Dustin Hoffman
proved that men also have sexy

legs, cross-dressing has
snowballed to a climax

today, raising the question:
Why are audiences so captivated
by men and women in drag?
Most male characters, through
cross-dressing, rediscover their
feminine side. They develop rela
tionships without having to be
tall, dark and handsome or strong
and silent. Women, likewise, ac
quire a greater level of freedom in

this male-dominated world;
being aggressive is suddenly chic.
Ironically, people who cross
dress to escape stereotypes feel
them more and gain a greater un
derstanding of the pressures of
gender definitions.
So grab your high heels and
tux — it's a unisexual world.
