# Posada celebrates 'true meaning' of Christmas
## 
### Vanessa Hua 
In a celebration of the tradi
tional Roman Catholic Chicano
holiday La Gran Posada, more
than 100 students, alumni, facul
ty and community members were
"turned away" from Soto,
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk and Roble on
Saturday.
The annual tradition — the
re-enactment of Joseph and
Mary's search for shelter on
Christmas Eve — included in a
lively musical procession around
campus that ended at El Centro
Chicano. Participants sang,
danced and held long white can
dles to light their path.
The observance of La Gran
Posada "keeps our culture alive,"
said Frances Morales, director of
El Centro Chicano. "There are
those in our community who
haven't celebrated it in a while.
For some, it was their first time.
La Posada gives them a chance to
learn something new and to share
it with their families."
The procession started at Casa
Zapata with the loud and happy
bursts of a mariachi band, the
clatter of the dance troupe Ballet
Folklorico and the breaking of a
piriata. One small boy attempted
to break open a papier-mache gui
tar with a stick larger than he

was.
The group continued on to
other dorms. At each of their
three stops, they sang a different
verse of a traditional Posada song
— their way of pleading for entry.
Finally, when El Centro Chi
cano opened its doors to the
group, they joyfully sang the last
verse and kicked off the festivi
ties. Novice members of Ballet
Folklorico gave their debut per
formance, dancing merrily in the
crowd. Afterward, everyone
joined in Mexican games and
feasted on the traditional delica
cies.
"La Posada is something we all
grew up with ... we share the
same experiences even with so
many different perspectives," said
Hector Porras, who played the
part of Jesus and is the husband
of Undergraduate Admissions
Asst. Director Anne-Maria Por
ras.
"La Posada is both spiritual
and joyful. It's exciting to see
everyone united and singing for
one cause. It's one of my favorite
holidays," said freshman Sonia
Herrera.
However, the celebration was
not limited to Chicano Catholics.
The crowd was a rainbow of races,
ages and religious beliefs. "La
Posada helps cultivate multicul-

tural awareness," said recent
graduate Garza Evaristo.
Several dorms such as Trancos
and Soto held pre-processional
festivities in which students
shared past holiday experiences
and Mexican treats with each

other.
"I think it's wonderful, for peo
ple from all over can get together
and celebrate the Posada and at
the same time, learn its real
meaning," said Mike Rashes, a
resident assistant in Trancos.

"The true meaning of Christ
mas is not Santa or trees, but that
Jesus was born," Herrera said.
La Gran Posada usually lasts
nine nights, but was condensed
into one night for the Stanford
community.
