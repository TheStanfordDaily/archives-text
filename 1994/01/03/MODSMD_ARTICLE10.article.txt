41 killed in Mexican uprising
SAN CRISTOBAL DK lAS CASAS, Mexico
(AP) — Armed Indian peasants battled soldiers
yesterday on the second day of an uprising in one
of Mexico's poorest states. The Indians held four
towns, and 41 were reported dead.
The worst reported clash, between an army
patrol and a bus full of rebels near San Cristobal,
left 14 dead. A fierce battle also erupted last
night in Ocosingo after army troops were
attacked by rebels. There was no immediate
casualty count from that fight.
Witnesses spoke of peasants in red bandanas
looting stores, wrecking government offices and
burning official papers in rampages through the
towns.
Earlier, a presidential spokesman indicated
that force would not be used to quell the insur
rection, the first sign of organized guerrilla
activity in Mexico since the 19705.
A statement from the Secretary of Defense
said soldiers in the area were ordered to stay in
their barracks.
The Roman Catholic bishops of Tuxtla
Gutierrez, the state capital, and Tapachula
asked for a truce and promised to seek a way to
discuss grievances within 48 hours.
Gates gets married — secretly
LANAI CITY, Hawaii (AP) — A lot of details
of Bill dates' wedding to Melinda French might
never be public. One thing seems sure, though
— the billionaire computer software wiz and his
bride don't hold a grudge.
Among those witnessing the nation's second
richest man exchanging vows with his new wife
were investor Warren Buffett, the nation's rich
est man with a fortune of more than $8 billion,
and Gates' former girlfriend, Ann Winblad, the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported.
Gates, 38, co-founder of the Microsoft Corp.,
and French, 29, a Microsoft business unit man
ager, left Lanai yesterday for an unknown hon
eymoon destination.
They were married at sunset Saturday in a
traditional Roman Catholic ceremony on the
17th hole of The Challenge golf course, which
sits on a cliff about 100 feet above the ocean.
The couple took extraordinary measures to
keep reporters and photographers from the wed
ding. They hired a private security force to
patrol the area, bought all available rooms at the
island's three hotels and reportedly hired all
helicopters on Maui to prevent their use by
paparazzi.
