# Rabin: Palestinians must OK compromise for talks to continue
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel withheld
approval yesterday for a new round of peace
talks with Palestinians, and Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin reportedly told his Cabinet he
was willing to let PLO chief Yasser Arafat
"sweat a bit."
Rabin also warned that if Arafat failed to
accept a compromise worked out last week
in Cairo on two key sticking points, all pre
vious agreements would be put aside.
"What's the point of reaching agree
ments?" Rabin asked in an interview on
Israeli army radio.
The tough line followed Arafat's rejection
of what Israeli officials claim was an agree
ment on overcoming key obstacles to imple
menting the Israel-PLO accord on Palestini
an autonomy. Arafat's objections were deliv
ered in two faxes sent to Rabin's office Fri
day with a list of proposed changes.
Nabil Shaath, the PLO chief negotiator,
denied a compromise had been reached. In
an interview with Israel army radio, Shaath
said both sides still disagreed on the size of
the autonomous Jericho area to be returned
by Israel and control over border crossings
into autonomous zones.
"Whereas the Israeli side is always very

sensitive about any symbol of sovereignty,"
Shaath said, "we are also very sensitive
about the attempt to continue Israeli control
of Palestinians in the occupied territories."
During the interview, Shaath received a
fax from Foreign Minister Shimon Peres,
saying Israel was prepared to resume talks
in the Egyptian resort of Taba. But no date
was mentioned.
Rabin said any new talks would be held
on the basis of the agreements reached in
Cairo. Rabin told his ministers during the
Cabinet meeting that he was in no hurry.
"Those in Tunis should sweat a bit," Israel
radio quoted Rabin as telling the Cabinet.
The negotiations on implementing auton
omy in Gaza and Jericho were scheduled to
be finished by Dec. 13, but disputes on secu
rity issues resulted in delays. The deadline
for completing troop withdrawal is April 13.
Israel claims that under the Cairo under
standing reached last week, the Jericho
region was to be 22 square miles, or double
the size initially proposed by Israel. Israel
says the two sides had also agreed to dual
Israeli-Palestinian presence on the border
crossings but with Israel reserving a veto
right. The PLO rejects that condition.
