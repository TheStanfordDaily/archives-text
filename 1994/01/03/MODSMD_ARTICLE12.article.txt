# Dole urges independent counsel in Whitewater case
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Attorney
General Janet Reno should stop
"dragging her feet" and appoint an
independent counsel to investigate
President Clinton's possible links to a
failed savings and loan firm in
Arkansas, Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole said yesterday.
"1 think it's high time she did what
she knows she should do," Dole said.
"For the president's sake and for
the sake of the integrity of the attorney
general's office she should move," the
Kansas Republican said on NBC's
"Meet the Press." He said Reno had
"wasted a lot of time dragging her
feet."

Reno has said repeatedly that
career prosecutors, and not a specially
appointed counsel, should handle the
case of Madison Guaranty Savings
and Loan Association, the failed thrift
owned by Clinton friend James
McDougal.
Federal investigators are looking
into the costly collapse of Madison
and whether any funds from the thrift
were illegally diverted to Whitewater
Development Corp., a real estate ven
ture owned jointly by the Clintons and
McDougal when Clinton was governor
of Arkansas.
Also being examined is whether
any Madison money was inappropri

ately routed to Clinton's 1984 guber
natorial campaign.
Dole and other Republicans have
also criticized the Democratic-con
trolled banking and finance commit
tees in Congress for playing politics in
refusing to launch legislative
inquiries.
But senior White House adviser
George Stephanopoulos, appearing on
ABC's "This Week With David Brink
ley," spoke yesterday of a "remark
able conversion" of Republicans now
seeking to resurrect the lapsed special
counsel law.
"Now that they sense that there
might be some perceived political

advantage to going after this, they're
all for it all of a sudden," he said.
GOP lawmakers, embittered by the
drawn-out independent counsel inves
tigation of the Iran-Contra affair dur
ing the Reagan administration, have
fought renewal of legislation reautho
rizing the appointment of counsels.
Stephanopoulos said the Whitewa
ter issue was examined during the
1992 presidential campaign and Clin
ton has now turned over to the Justice
Department all documents related to
the real estate company. "No laws
were broken. The Justice Department
will show that, but there is no need at
this time for an independent counsel."
