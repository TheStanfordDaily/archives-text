CUE should re-examine
hiring and recruitment
of interdisciplinary staff

IT'S TIME FOR STANFORD to
once again lead the way in
developing innovative educa
tion programs.
As the University turns its
attention toward undergraduates
and their education, it should also
look at the professors who provide
this schooling.
More specifically, the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education
should focus their attention on
those professors who teach and
research in interdisciplinary fields,
such as environmental studies or
human biology.
More often than not, each of
these "interdisciplinary" profes
sors has had to pursue a stifling
uni-disciplinary pre-tenure regi
men.
As it stands, universities reward
excellent uni-disciplinary students
by offering them advancement into
the teaching ranks in their given
departments.
However, the interdisciplinary
student, who may not be an expert
in one particular field but excels in
the intersection of two or more dis
ciplines, oftentimes is turned away
from graduate advancement due to
a lack of uni-disciplinary excel
lence.
Although Stanford does support
interdisciplinary research, profes
sors in those fields have started out
in purely disciplinary areas and
"crossed over" after receiving
tenure.
This post-tenure migration to
interdisciplinary fields isn't neces
sarily bad, but it accomplishes its
goal — supporting excellent inter
disciplinary research — in a round
about and inefficient manner.
The University should adopt a
policy to seek and hire potential
tenured faculty that are experts
not a single discipline, but at the

intersection of many disciplines.
Just as Stanford's interdisci
plinary earth systems major was an
academic first, a policy to encour
age and retain the graduates of this
program would also be ground
breaking.
Creating such a policy would
officially recognize that some of the
problems facing the world today
are innately interdisciplinary and
require a non-traditional back
ground.
For example, when examining
the development of a third world
country, a researcher experienced
only in economics might not under
stand the complete implications of
moving the country from poverty
to long-term sustainment.
Needed in such a situation is not
a uni-disciplinary scholar, but the
academician who is well-versed in
several complimentary disciplines.
This policy would bring great
minds and great thinkers to Stan
ford, augmenting the University's
already world-class faculty.
Stanford's institution of earth
systems and other interdisci
plinary programs signals the Uni
versity's recognition that such pro
grams offer unparalleled academic
possibilities to students; it is only
logical that such avenues are avail
able for potential professors, as
well.
But, as of today, there is no
money or mechanism to retain
these interdisciplinary scholars
after their graduation. Instead,
those students intent on pursuing
a collegiate teaching career will
have be uni-disciplinary until they
get tenured, and then they can pur
sue "risky" research in a interdisci
plinary field. This situation is
clearly inadequate, both for the
University and for potential profes
sors.
When the Commission on
Undergraduate Education exam
ines the role and status of instruc
tors at Stanford, it should rethink
the process of recruiting and
retaining interdisciplinary faculty.
After all, the potential Albert
Schweitzers of tomorrow shouldn't
be turned away at the door.
