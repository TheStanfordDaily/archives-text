## A 						knotty problem for men 
### 
SOMETIMES I wonder why millions
of men everyday wake up and pro
ceed to suffocate themselves by
tying strangely colored pieces of fabric
around their necks. The custom of wear
ing a tie has never really been clear to me,
and so I actually ran a small, isolated sur
vey for my own personal research to dis
cover the origins of the tie. Here they are,
select actual responses from people
around my dorm:
"I don't know; I don't have a clue."
This response was often followed by
"Why?," "Try looking it up," or "Go
away."
"To hide the buttons on the front of a
shirt when buttons weren't as stylish as
they are now."
"Back in the Old West, contenders in
showdowns would wear ties and if one of
them hit the other guy's tie, they called
him an expert marksman." And they
called the other guy dead.
"It was used first as a noose for hang
ing executions." I suppose that would
explain their popularity as a formal
accessory.
And my personal favorite: "To provide
oxygen deprivation for sexual enhance
ment."
The real history and utility of ties still
eluded me, and I continued my research
to more reliable and socially acceptable
sources of knowledge. Neckties were used
to tighten the collar of shirts around the
neck, "as a matter of fashion" ("Collars,

Stocks," and "Cravats by Doriece Colle").
Hut with the invention of turtlenecks,
the scarf and the grand technological
advancement of buttons, neckties no
longer serve any practical purpose.
Rather useless, neckties may soon go
proverbially by way of the dodo, never to
be seen again except in plotless period
films about ancient 20th-century society.
Or, they may be treasured as pretty fads
of fashion, enjoying the success of other
useless things like shoulder pads and tat
toos.
Then should the accepted, essentially
required, custom of wearing ties be aban
doned? The argument rages to this day
from its very humble beginnings, and it
may be the topic of heatyd discission and
debate for venrs to"cmnr. Now/the neck
tie is much more important than most
people imagine and than its originators
ever dreamt.
While the days of the utility of the
necktie are sadly gone, the wearing of ties
should actually be encouraged because of
their newfound, innate uselessness.
Without a distinct purpose, the necktie
does not need to meet any standard or be
of any particular type, but can vary in
size, shape and color. Ties could be used
to help man in this increasingly oppres
sive society. And I do mean man and not
mankind.
In the field of fashion, men have been
oppressed by the mysterious and cruel
forces that have determined their stylis

tic fate, possibly forever. Today, they are
being coerced into a carefully designed
mold, a mold marked by the "business
suit." Men sit trapped in a rut of dark
Italian and pseudo-Italian suits. The
necktie, with its many variations, is the
only escape, the savior and liberator for
these slaves of fashion.
Will men be trapped by the stereotype
of the silent, stoic, emotionless beast?
With the necktie, we can all cry out in a
defiant "No!" We can take this opportu
nity to express ourselves, to let our emo
tions run free and frolic in the golden
grass of the beautiful meadow at the
dawn of a new day. Wear ties to express
your feelings and yourself: dark solids for
a serious look ("Stand back. I take large
steps."); bright, playful prints ("I might
be over the hill and in a mid-life crisis,
but I do drive a red car."); Mickey Mouse
ties ("I've always seen him as sort of a
role model."); fish ties ("It was dark ").
Now, the necktie has a new, higher
purpose: to be worn until the long-await
ed day when men won't need accessories
as their only expression of emotions.

cially clever if you realize "Thai" and
"tie" sound the same. That is not why he
