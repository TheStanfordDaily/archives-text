# Sexual harassment policy coordinator named
## Zappert, clinical psychologist at Cowell, experienced in women's issues 
### Sandy Lee Staff writer 
Dr. Laraine Zappert, a clinical psychologist
at Cowell Student Health Center, has been
appointed to oversee the implementation of
the University's new policy on sexual harass
ment as its first sexual harassment coordinat
ing adviser.
Zappert, named to the post in mid-Decem
ber, will oversee the implementation of the
policy, which was unanimously endorsed by
the Faculty Senate in September.
Her major duties include training and
supervising advisers to help with sexual
harassment concerns and complaints, educat
ing the campus community about harassment

issues and keeping records of formal charges.
Zappert came to Stanford in 1978, shortly
after earning a doctorate in social psychology
and organizational behavior from Cornell
University, where she did both her undergrad
uate and graduate work.
She served as project director and research
associate at the Center for Research on
Women, then joined the Counseling and Psy
chological Services staff at Cowell and eventu
ally became director of Cowell's Women's
Group program. She is currently a clinical
associate professor of psychiatry in the Medi
cal School's Department of Psychiatry and
Behavioral Sciences.
Though Zappert did not participate in the
new policy's development, she said believes

the policy is both thoughtful and workable.
The policy includes a stronger confidentiality
clause and provides complainants with more
informal channels to communicate their
grievances.
"It's going to require some education and
some initiative on people's parts, but I think
we can make it work," she said in a press
release.
Among Zappert's first responsibilities
will be to publish a pamphlet that explains
the University's new policy and offer guid
ance to those who are affected by harass
ment. She will also begin training her team
of advisers and panelists — who will be
appointed by the president or the provost —
later this month.
