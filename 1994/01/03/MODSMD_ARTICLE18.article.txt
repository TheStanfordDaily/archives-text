# Oodles of input
## Many submit concerns about Student Affairs budget cuts 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Letters received by the Office of Student Affairs
concerning the department's reorganization show
that students are concerned about the fate of cam
pus ethnic centers and the Center for Teaching and
Learning, according to Mary Edmonds, vice provost
and dean for Student Affairs.
Partly spurred by impending budget cuts, the
office is currently working on a three-year project
to streamline the student services offered at Stan
ford.
It may lose up to 30 percent of its budget — or
about $5.5 million — as the University prepares to
trim about $18 million to $20 million from its bud
get by 1997.
"We got a lot of letters from students, alumni
and faculty — there's a general interest out there
and we're considering it all seriously," Edmonds
said, adding that she could not give a fair estimate
of the number of letters she has received.
Edmonds placed an ad in The Daily last quarter
soliciting community input about her office's
planned reorganization.
Edmonds said that despite the approaching Jan.
15 deadline for a reorganization plan — which was
set by Provost Condoleezza Rice — it is still too

early to list any specifics for the restructuring of
the departments.
Student Affairs oversees housing, health ser
vices, financial aids and the dean of students' office,
among others.
Because there is so little time, Edmonds said
that her office is not going through the usual Uni
versity process of appointing a number of commit
tees to examine all the information before a deci
sion is reached. "We don't have time to go through
I that process) so much that it lowers morale," she
said.
But Edmonds stressed that, through what she
calls a "horrible process," her committee of five is
"looking at every possible reorganization, for effi
ciency as well as budget cuts."
Edmonds, who said she believes student
input is always important, added that the ASSU
will be involved in the reorganization process as
well.
She said that a group of five people from the
Office of Student Affairs, including herself,
worked with a consultant over winter vacation to
discern how the office can still offer the same ser
vices with fewer resources — and meet Rice's
deadline.
"We're looking at every function and seeing
where there might be duplication," she said.
