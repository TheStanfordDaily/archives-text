# U.S. won't join suit against University
## Former Navy auditor Biddle goes ahead with litigation over indirect-cost practices 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Editorial staff 
In a move that has heartened University
officials, the federal government has decid
ed not to join a lawsuit filed by a former gov
ernment auditor that alleges Stanford
overcharged taxpayers by more than $200
million for indirect research costs.
After a two-year investigation, the Jus
tice Department in late December let Paul
Riddle, formerly the Office of Naval Re
search's controversial on-campus contracts
officer, go alone in proving his charges,
which include allegations that Stanford of

ficials knowingly charged research over
head costs that violated government regu
lations.
Biddle's claims prompted several federal
investigations and a congressional hearing
about Stanford's accounting practices.
Stanford has disputed most of his allega
tions and has continually denied any
wrongdoing.
News of the decision encouraged Uni
versity officials, who have been awaiting
the government's course of action since the
case was put under a seal in U.S. District
Court in 1991.
University President Gerhard
Casper said in a statement that he
"was pleased to learn that the fed
eral government will not inter
vene in this private lawsuit
against Stanford University. This
is very good news for the Univer
sity and for Stanford's many
friends throughout the country."
Casper suggested that, by
deciding not to take up the case,
the Justice Department saw little
worth in Biddle's claims.
"If the government finds the
allegations to have merit, the
Department of Justice typically
takes over the case and prose
cutes in court," Casper said.
Biddle, however, said that Jus
tice Department delays, and not
the quality of his lawsuit, were
behind the decision not to join.
U.S. District Judge Spencer
Williams recently refused the gov
ernment's request to extend the
investigation period, Biddle said.
"We were ready to go forward.
There was this feeling that it was
time to proceed. . . ." Biddle said.
"My observation is that the
Department of Justice would
have preferred additional time to

pursue further matters that
interested them."
Justice Department officials
refused to comment.
Nevertheless, Biddle said the
government's decision "worked
out rather nicely for him"
because his qui tam suit, filed in
September 1991, was too large
and complex for the government
to handle.
Under a qui tam suit, an indi
vidual may sue for fraud on behalf
of the federal government. If the
suit is successful and it is found
that intentionally false claims
have been filed, the amount of the
judgment could be tripled — and
Biddle could personally receive up
to 30 percent of it.
"Most qui tarn [plaintiffs]
don't want the Department of
Justice to join them. You want to
be in the driver's seat," he said.
"That way we can put more spe
cialized talent to work from the
private side."
He also said the government's
decision isn't final; the Justice
Department has the right to re
enter the case later on.
Biddle said he has enlisted the
support of Strauss and Troy, a
Cincinnati-based law firm that
specializes in securities fraud. He
said he expects the case to cost at
least $2 million.
As the Navy's on-campus con

tracts regulator, Biddle ignited a
firestorm in 1990 when he
announced that the University
was overcharging the government
by hundreds of millions of dollars

for indirect costs
— expenditures
necessary for
conducting feder
al research but
not easily
attributable to a
particular pro
ject, such as elec
tricity, building
maintenance and
depreciation.

His claims prompted federal
investigations and led the
Defense Contract Audit Agency to
seek $252 million from the Uni
versity for overcharges during the
1980s.
University officials said the
government had previously
agreed upon Stanford's higher
than-standard level of indirect
cost charges through a series of
special memoranda of under
standing (MOUs). Government
auditors claimed the MOUs were
faulty and have been trying to
retroactively cancel them.
Stanford officials, who have
been attempting to settle their
dispute with the Department of
Defense for two years, said the
Justice Department's decision

was a step in the right direction
for the University.
"This is a very positive devel
opment for us," said Peter Van
Etten, Stanford's chief financial
officer. He predicted that the deci
sion would help speed up the
negotiations.
Biddle said he filed his lawsuit
because he felt "the cozy relation
ship between [Office of Naval
Research) oversight individuals
and Stanford" might preclude a
full repayment of any overcharges.
During its investigation, the
Department of Justice issued 11
subpoenas to the University for
information and interviewed
numerous current and former
employees about Stanford's
accounting practices, Casper
said. In addition, he said the Uni
versity provided investigators
with more than 150,000 pages of
documents.
Biddle said he will likely file an
amended complaint later this
month that will elaborate on his
charges and "revise upward" the
amount he contends Stanford
owes the government.
Stanford has not been served
with a copy of the lawsuit, said
Larry Morton, the University's
director of government relations.
After receiving the charges, the
University will file a formal
response, he said.

Biddle said he filed his lawsuit
because he felt "the cozy relation
ship between [Office of Naval
Research) oversight individuals
and Stanford" might preclude a
full repayment of any overcharges.
During its investigation, the
Department of Justice issued 11
subpoenas to the University for
information and interviewed
numerous current and former
employees about Stanford's
accounting practices, Casper
said. In addition, he said the Uni
versity provided investigators
with more than 150,000 pages of
documents.
Biddle said he will likely file an
amended complaint later this
month that will elaborate on his
charges and "revise upward" the
amount he contends Stanford
owes the government.
Stanford has not been served
with a copy of the lawsuit, said
Larry Morton, the University's
director of government relations.
After receiving the charges, the
University will file a formal
response, he said.

In a move that has heartened University
officials, the federal government has decid
ed not to join a lawsuit filed by a former gov
ernment auditor that alleges Stanford
overcharged taxpayers by more than $200
million for indirect research costs.
After a two-year investigation, the Jus
tice Department in late December let Paul
Riddle, formerly the Office of Naval Re
search's controversial on-campus contracts
officer, go alone in proving his charges,
which include allegations that Stanford of

ficials knowingly charged research over
head costs that violated government regu
lations.
Biddle's claims prompted several federal
investigations and a congressional hearing
about Stanford's accounting practices.
Stanford has disputed most of his allega
tions and has continually denied any
wrongdoing.
News of the decision encouraged Uni
versity officials, who have been awaiting
the government's course of action since the
case was put under a seal in U.S. District
Court in 1991.
University President Gerhard
Casper said in a statement that he
"was pleased to learn that the fed
eral government will not inter
vene in this private lawsuit
against Stanford University. This
is very good news for the Univer
sity and for Stanford's many
friends throughout the country."
Casper suggested that, by
deciding not to take up the case,
the Justice Department saw little
worth in Biddle's claims.
"If the government finds the
allegations to have merit, the
Department of Justice typically
takes over the case and prose
cutes in court," Casper said.
Biddle, however, said that Jus
tice Department delays, and not
the quality of his lawsuit, were
behind the decision not to join.
U.S. District Judge Spencer
Williams recently refused the gov
ernment's request to extend the
investigation period, Biddle said.
"We were ready to go forward.
There was this feeling that it was
time to proceed. . . ." Biddle said.
"My observation is that the
Department of Justice would
have preferred additional time to

pursue further matters that
interested them."
Justice Department officials
refused to comment.
Nevertheless, Biddle said the
government's decision "worked
out rather nicely for him"
because his qui tam suit, filed in
September 1991, was too large
and complex for the government
to handle.
Under a qui tam suit, an indi
vidual may sue for fraud on behalf
of the federal government. If the
suit is successful and it is found
that intentionally false claims
have been filed, the amount of the
judgment could be tripled — and
Biddle could personally receive up
to 30 percent of it.
"Most qui tarn [plaintiffs]
don't want the Department of
Justice to join them. You want to
be in the driver's seat," he said.
"That way we can put more spe
cialized talent to work from the
private side."
He also said the government's
decision isn't final; the Justice
Department has the right to re
enter the case later on.
Biddle said he has enlisted the
support of Strauss and Troy, a
Cincinnati-based law firm that
specializes in securities fraud. He
said he expects the case to cost at
least $2 million.
As the Navy's on-campus con

tracts regulator, Biddle ignited a
firestorm in 1990 when he
announced that the University
was overcharging the government
by hundreds of millions of dollars

for indirect costs
— expenditures
necessary for
conducting feder
al research but
not easily
attributable to a
particular pro
ject, such as elec
tricity, building
maintenance and
depreciation.

His claims prompted federal
investigations and led the
Defense Contract Audit Agency to
seek $252 million from the Uni
versity for overcharges during the
1980s.
University officials said the
government had previously
agreed upon Stanford's higher
than-standard level of indirect
cost charges through a series of
special memoranda of under
standing (MOUs). Government
auditors claimed the MOUs were
faulty and have been trying to
retroactively cancel them.
Stanford officials, who have
been attempting to settle their
dispute with the Department of
Defense for two years, said the
Justice Department's decision

was a step in the right direction
for the University.
"This is a very positive devel
opment for us," said Peter Van
Etten, Stanford's chief financial
officer. He predicted that the deci
sion would help speed up the
negotiations.
Biddle said he filed his lawsuit
because he felt "the cozy relation
ship between [Office of Naval
Research) oversight individuals
and Stanford" might preclude a
full repayment of any overcharges.
