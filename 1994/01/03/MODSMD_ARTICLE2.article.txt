## Former Navy auditor Biddle goes ahead with litigation over indirect-cost practices 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Editorial staff 
In a move that has heartened University
officials, the federal government has decid
ed not to join a lawsuit filed by a former gov
ernment auditor that alleges Stanford
overcharged taxpayers by more than $200
million for indirect research costs.
After a two-year investigation, the Jus
tice Department in late December let Paul
Riddle, formerly the Office of Naval Re
search's controversial on-campus contracts
officer, go alone in proving his charges,
which include allegations that Stanford of

ficials knowingly charged research over
head costs that violated government regu
lations.
Biddle's claims prompted several federal
investigations and a congressional hearing
about Stanford's accounting practices.
Stanford has disputed most of his allega
tions and has continually denied any
wrongdoing.
News of the decision encouraged Uni
versity officials, who have been awaiting
the government's course of action since the
case was put under a seal in U.S. District
