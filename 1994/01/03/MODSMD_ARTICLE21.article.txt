## Bruins block Cardinal's quest for repeat 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
No matter how hard you fight,
sometimes your best just isn't quite
enough.
The Stanford women's volley
ball team discovered the truth
behind this cliche as its dreams of
repeating as NCAA champion were
crushed by UCLA Dec. 10.
The sixth-ranked Cardinal's sea
son came to an abrupt end in the
first round of the West Regionals in
Los Angeles, as the squad fell to the
No. I Bruins (30-2, 17-1 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) by a score of
15-11, 12-15, 15-5, 15-10.
The Bruins were toppled the
next night, losing to Brigham
Young University in the West
Regional Finals, l/nig Beach State
would eventually win the NCAA
title, their first such championship.
"I'm disappointed, obviously,"
said Stanford coach Don Shaw after
his squad's defeat. "I felt we could
have played better than we played
tonight, but with what we had, we
gave it our best shot."
As befits one of the longest
standing and most competitive
rivalries in collegiate volleyball, any
Stanford / UCLA contest is bound
to be fierce. This match was no
exception.
While neither team was able to
completely dominate the first two
games, powerful showing
in game three provided the Bruins
with the momentum they needed to
claim game four and the match.
"We overcame some huge
deficits in just about every game,"
Shaw said. "The fact that we came
back to even the score and had a
chance to win every game was
encouraging — we fought really
hard but were just not getting the
job done from an execution stand
point."
Many of Stanford's offensive
attempts were thwarted by excep
tionally strong UCLA net play.
From the beginning of game one,
the Bruins focused their blocking

efforts on outside hitters Gary
Wendell and Marnie Triefenbach,
effectively slowing the Cardinal
offense. Despite an aggressive
string of four kills by Stanford out
side hitter Maureen McLaren,
UCLA built a 10-4 lead.
"We weren't able to establish the
middle and they were just camping
on our outsides," said senior setter
Piper Hahn. "It was really hard for
Marnie and Cary especially because
[UCLA] was prioritizing them as
our top outside and right side hit
ters — it made it rough on them."
WTiile the Cardinal managed to
break through the barricade in the

second half of the game to come to
within 12-11, Bruin hitters Annette
Buckner and Jenny Johnson
proved too much for the Stanford
front line to handle.
"They came out really strong
right from the beginning," Hahn
said. "They were passing really well
and able to run their offense and
establish the middle right off the
bat so they were able to go to their
outside hitters."
The Cardinal got off to another
sluggish start in the second game,
only to make a similar comeback —
and with much more success.
Although Buckner's powerful

smash penetrated the Stanford
block time and time again through
out the first half of the game, the
Cardinal finally managed to get its
hands on the hall and slow the
attack. Senior Heidi Eick and fresh
man Eileen Murfee both provided
crucial stuffs and raised the level of
Stanford's blocking game. This,
together with junior tri-captain
Anne Wicks' net effort, secured
game two for the Cardinal.
Stanford was unable to carry
their momentum into the third
game. Plagued by a series of hitting
errors, the struggling Cardinal
offense opened up the path for a 10-

point UCLA run. Ahead at 10-2, the
Bruins stayed on top for the rest of
the game as Kim Krull served for
the final points.
"I think we did have momentum
coming out of the second game,
especially ending it with a stuff
block by (Wicks)," Wendell said. "In
the third game things just weren't
going our way, we got off to a slow
start and from there it was an
uphill battle."
Stanford fell to an early 6-1
deficit as the Bruins found plenty of
holes in the Cardinal block.
