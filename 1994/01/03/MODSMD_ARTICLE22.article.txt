## 11th-ranked women undefeated over break 
### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
So what did you do over winter break?
While most Stanford students celebrated the hol
idays with family and friends, the Cardinal women's
basketball team skipped most of its vacation and cel
ebrated a long-awaited return to midseason form
instead.
In case you missed the day-old or nonexistent
scores in the back of your hometown sports pages,
Stanford (6-2) has posted five consecutive home
court routs since Dec. 8, putting up an impressive
94.4 points per game while blowing its foes out of
Maples Pavilion by an average margin of over 31
points.
The action started in record-breaking fashion
during Dead Week, when the Cardinal proved that it
was very alive indeed in a 122-49 pasting of Long
Beach State on Dec. 8. The 122 points marked a
school and Pacific 10 Conference record, as did the
73-point margin of victory.
The Cardinal opened a 24-4 advantage six min
utes into the game and led by as many as 43 en route
to a record-tying 66 points in the first half. Stanford
then put up 56 points and led by as many as 75 in
the second frame before the game mercifully came to
a close.
All 12 healthy Cardinal players saw action, and
six scored in double figures. Junior forward Rachel
Hemmer led the way with 19 points and 12
rebounds (both game highs), while junior center
Anita Kaplan added 17 points and senior guard
Christy Hedgpeth chipped in 16.
.Junior guard Kate Paye, who spelled starting
freshman point guard Jamila Wideman off the
bench, tossed in 14 points and a game-high eight
assists while contributing two of Stanford's nine
steals.
However, the most memorable performance in a
night of many was that of sophomore walk-on Amy
Wustefeld. While scoring only four points in five
minutes of action near the end of the game, Wuste
feld sank a free throw with 31 seconds remaining
that gave the Cardinal 120 points, officially bypass
ing (he 119 that Stanford tallied against Wisconsin
in 1988.
After finals concluded, the Cardinal added more
than a footnote to its Fry's Electronics / Cardinal
Classic history, defeating Dartmouth and South
west Missouri State on Dec. 17 and 18 to run its all
time tournament record to 16-0.
Dartmouth (0-4 after the game) was Stanford's
semifinal victim, as the Ivy Leaguers found Califor
nia not so friendlv in falling 88-55. Hemmer enjoyed
a huge night for tVie Cardinal, recording a game-high
32 points in just 26 minutes. Kaplan, who along
with Wideman made the All-Tournament Team,
added 17 points and a game-high nine rebounds as
Stanford doubled a 16-point halftime edge to reach
the final margin of 33.
In finals action the following evening, the then
13th ranked Cardinal parlayed a one-point halftime
advantage into a 74-63 victory over No. 17 South
west Missouri State, a 1992 Final Four participant.
Hemmer, who after the game was voted the tourna
ment's Most Valuable Player, again paced all scorers
with 20 points to go along with a game-high 13
rebounds.

After a 10-day hiatus, the now-11th ranked Car
dinal picked up where it left off, handling No -1 Con
necticut (7-1 after the game) by a 94-75 count. Six
Stanford players scored in double figures, with
freshman forward Kate Starbird leading everyone
with 20. Kaplan pitched in 16 points, as did redshirt
sophomore forward Bobbie Kelsey, who came in off
the bench and only saw 17 minutes of playing time.
Pave, who had returned to her starting off-guard
spot the previous game, scored 12 points and record
ed a game-high seven assists, while Wideman, who
started at the point, scored 11 and doled out six

assists.
Finally, the Cardinal outlasted the UNLV Run
nin' Rebels on Dec. 30, posting 51 points in the sec
ond half of a 94-73 win. Kaplan led all scorers with
31 points in just 28 minutes, while Hedgpeth added
18 points and five assists ofT the bench.

son kicks oft tonight, when the Cardinal travels
down Route 101 to take on the Santa Clara Rroncos
