# Men's hoops winning early

### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Last year, a six
point road loss to Big East champion Seton Hall
would have been grounds for celebration.
That was then, this is now.
"Twice in this trip," said Stanford men's bas
ketball coach Mike Montgomery, "We've been in a
game that realistically we had a chance to win, and
we've not made the critical plays."
Montgomery was referring to a 80-73 loss at No.
17 Wisconsin and Thursday's 75-69 decision in the
final of the second annual Seton Hall / Meadow
lands Tournament, the only two losses in an eye
opening holiday season for the Cardinal (7-2).
Stanford 82, at Santa Clara 70 (OT)
After opening the season with three nondescript
home victories, the Cardinal faced its first real test
of the season in its Dec. 11 contest with the Bron
cos.
Stanford did not record a single road win in the
1992-93 season, and entered the game riding a 15-
game road losing streak that stretched back to a
92-66 win at California in 1992.
Santa Clara, who upset Arizona in the first
round of last year's NCAA Tournament, had
already recorded a win against Pacific 10 Confer
ence favorite California this season.
However, the Cardinal, down by as many as 15
in the first half, overcame the persistent Broncos
in overtime. Stanford dominated the extra period,
scoring 14 points as opposed to Santa Clara's two
in the five-minute session.
Impressive in regulation, freshman point guard
Brevin Knight dominated the overtime period
Knight scored eight of his game-high 23 points in
overtime.
Knight played for 42 of 45 minutes in the game,
a workload he is getting used to even at this early
point in the season. Since backup point man Frank
Harris left the team for personal reasons, Knight
has averaged 37 minutes of playing time per con
test.
Forward Andy Poppink and center Jim Morgan
both set career highs by grabbing 10 rebounds
apiece. Poppink (bad back) and Morgan (herniated
disc), hampered by injuries last season, have each
started all nine Stanford games to date.
Santa Clara fell to 4-3 on the year with the
defeat.
at Stanford 91, McNeeso State 75
Knight and Poppink led the charge Dec. 20 as
Stanford exploded for its highest offensive output
since a 92-42 trouncing on Puget Sound in last
year's opener.
Knight was one assist away from an unusual
triple-double, collecting 21 points, nine assists and
an amazing 10 steals on the night. The froah's 10
steals set a new Pac-10 record and shattered the
Maples Pavilion record by four.
Poppink hit double figures in rebounds for the
second consecutive game, with 10, and chipped in
16 points in defeating the Cowboys, which fell to 2-
2 on the season.
at Stanford 84, Virginia 72
When is a win more than a
win? When it comes against a

team that pounded the Cardinal
72-48 last year
Shooting guard Dion Cross
scored 16 points against the Cav
aliers Dec. 22, including a perfect
4-for-4 from beyond the three
point line. Cross leads the Cardi
nal in scoring averaging nearly 17
points a game. More impressive

ly, the sophomore is shooting at a
57 percent clip from three-point
land.
Knight came within one of the
Cardinal single-game assist
record with 11, scoring a team
high 23 points in the process.
But it was reserve guard David
Harbour who stole the spotlight.
Harbour, who missed the entire
season last year after undergoing
thumb replacement surgery, set a
career high with 15 points,
including an 11-for-15 perfor
mance from the line.
The Cavaliers, a preseason
top-25 selection, fell to 3-3 on the
year.
at Wisconsin 80, Stanford 73
The Cardinal entered it's Dec.
27 match with the undefeated
Badgers as 14-point underdogs,
but never trailed by more than
eight points in the contest.
Poppink scored 22 points
while Knight added 15 in a game
in which the Cardinal led by a 58-
53 margin midway through the
second half.
With 1:28 to play, Cross tied
the game at 73 with his fourth
three-pointer of the night. But
Stanford, which was shooting 74
percent from the line entering
the game, hit only 13 of 24 foul
shots in Madison. Down 76-73,
the Cardinal went 0-for-2 from
the line in the final 44 seconds,
while Wisconsin was a perfect 4-
for-4.
The Badgers improved to 6-0
on the year.
Stanford 73, Manhattan 60
"We've won some ugly games.
I don't know if that is a trade
mark for us, but I hope not."
Montgomery's words were
never more true than in the open
ing game of the Seton
Hall / Meadowlands Tourna
ment.
The Jaspers, who had their
five-game winning streak
snapped, entered last Wednes
day's game holding opponents to
a .371 shooting percentage. The
Cardinal fell right into line
against Manhattan, hitting for
38 percent from the floor and 58
percent from the line in the
game.
But if Stanford looked bad on
the offensive side of the court,
Manhattan was simply horrific.
The Jaspers managed only 20
field goals in the entire contest,
including a dreadful 2-of-16 from
three-point territory.

"Stanford is not very fancy,
but they make it difficult for you
to score," said Manhattan coach
Fran Fraschilla. "They are as
good a defensive team as we'll see
until we face (seventh-ranked)
Massachusetts in February."
The Cardinal, up by six at the
half, led by only five with 5:04 to
play. But Morgan, who hit for 12
points, all in the second half, hit a
layup that stretched the Cardinal
lead to seven. Three foul shots
and a Brent Williams conversion
of an offensive rebound put the
game out of reach at 66-54 with
2:05 to play. Manhattan fell to 5-
3 on the year.
at Seton Hall 75, Stanford 69
Playing its third road game in
four days, Stanford raced to an
early lead before running out of
steam in the second half.
Down 12-8, a Morgan three
point play began a 12-point Car
dinal burst which put Stanford
up 20-12 midway through the
first half. Williams, who was
named with Cross to the all-tour
nament team, was torrid in the
first half, scoring 10 points on 5-
of-7 shooting.
"We were very fortunate to be
where we were at halftime," said
Seton Hall coach P.J. Carlesimo.
"They took it to us from the
start."
But foul troubles and poor foul
shooting plagued the Cardinal in
the second half. Tournament
MVP Arturas Karnishovas hit for
25 second-half points and 34 in
the game.
More importantly, Kar
nishovas lured Cardinal big men
Poppink and backup forward
Darren Allaway into foul trouble
— both fouled out with several
minutes to play in the second
half.
With 3:27 remaining, a Knight
dish to Morgan brought the Car
dinal to within three at 66-63.
But Stanford hit only three of
seven free throws down the
stretch, while Seton Hall scored
its last seven points from the line.
"If we'd have hit our free
throws, it could have been a dif
ferent story," said Montgomery.
Still, a six-point road loss to
Seton Hall, which improved to 7-
2 on the year with the victory,
would have seemed almost
unthinkable with last year's 7-23
club.
"They took it to use from the
start," said Carlesimo. "They're
going to have a heck of a year."
