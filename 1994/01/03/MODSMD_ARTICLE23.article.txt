EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. â€” Last year, a six
point road loss to Big East champion Seton Hall
would have been grounds for celebration.
That was then, this is now.
"Twice in this trip," said Stanford men's bas
ketball coach Mike Montgomery, "We've been in a
game that realistically we had a chance to win, and
we've not made the critical plays."
Montgomery was referring to a 80-73 loss at No.
17 Wisconsin and Thursday's 75-69 decision in the
final of the second annual Seton Hall / Meadow
lands Tournament, the only two losses in an eye
opening holiday season for the Cardinal (7-2).
Stanford 82, at Santa Clara 70 (OT)
After opening the season with three nondescript
home victories, the Cardinal faced its first real test
of the season in its Dec. 11 contest with the Bron
cos.
Stanford did not record a single road win in the
1992-93 season, and entered the game riding a 15-
game road losing streak that stretched back to a
92-66 win at California in 1992.
Santa Clara, who upset Arizona in the first
round of last year's NCAA Tournament, had
already recorded a win against Pacific 10 Confer
ence favorite California this season.
However, the Cardinal, down by as many as 15
in the first half, overcame the persistent Broncos
in overtime. Stanford dominated the extra period,
scoring 14 points as opposed to Santa Clara's two
in the five-minute session.
Impressive in regulation, freshman point guard
Brevin Knight dominated the overtime period
Knight scored eight of his game-high 23 points in
overtime.
Knight played for 42 of 45 minutes in the game,
a workload he is getting used to even at this early
point in the season. Since backup point man Frank
Harris left the team for personal reasons, Knight
has averaged 37 minutes of playing time per con
test.
Forward Andy Poppink and center Jim Morgan
both set career highs by grabbing 10 rebounds
apiece. Poppink (bad back) and Morgan (herniated
disc), hampered by injuries last season, have each
started all nine Stanford games to date.
Santa Clara fell to 4-3 on the year with the
defeat.
at Stanford 91, McNeeso State 75
Knight and Poppink led the charge Dec. 20 as
Stanford exploded for its highest offensive output
since a 92-42 trouncing on Puget Sound in last
year's opener.
Knight was one assist away from an unusual
triple-double, collecting 21 points, nine assists and
an amazing 10 steals on the night. The froah's 10
steals set a new Pac-10 record and shattered the
Maples Pavilion record by four.
Poppink hit double figures in rebounds for the
second consecutive game, with 10, and chipped in
16 points in defeating the Cowboys, which fell to 2-
2 on the season.
