It was back to business for the
Cardinal wrestlers as they took a
break from holiday vacationing last
Wednesday to compete in the Ore
gon Classic Tournament at Oregon
State.
The team finished seventh out
of a field of 20 teams. Head coach
Chris Horpel attributed this lack
luster result to both timing and
injuries.
"We weren't physically ready,
but that's a product of the time of
the year," Horpel said. "With Dead
Week, finals and vacation, it's diffi
cult to do well."
Matt Cano (126 lbs.) and Jay
Jackson (134) were the only Cardi
nal wrestlers to place. Cano pinned
Greg Faver of Clackamas College in
three minutes, 41 seconds in his
first match to advance to the sec
ond round. There he lost to Jeff
Maes of Cal-State Fullerton by
decision, 8-5.
Cano earned a second chance
against Maes after winning two
matches in the consolation brack
et. The Stanford grappler led after
the first period, but Maes received
a quick six points using a leg ride
against Cano early in the second
period. Maes won the match 11-3,
leaving Cano with a fourth-place
finish.
Jackson had decisive wins over
his first three opponents. He deci

sioned Farzin Daneshnis of Cal-
State Fullerton 6-3 in his first
match and continued to advance by
holding Nick Cline of Southern
Oregon scoreless 10-0 in the quar
terfinals. He reached the finals
after beating Dominic Disabado of
Ohio State, 5-3.
Jackson's winning streak ended
in the championship match. Match
against two-time Ail-American
Babak Mohammadi of Oregon State.
Jackson lost 18-8 and had to be con
tent with a second-place finish.
Other wrestlers representing
the Cardinal at the tournament,
which primarily featured squads
from the West and Midwest, includ
ed By Pham (118), who finished 0-
1; Jimmy Aguirre (142), who won
two matches while also losing two;
Scott Chapman (158), who lost his
two contests; Jason Gladden (167),
who went 1-2, winning his first col
legiate match in the process; and
Bryan Vaniman (177), who fin
ished 0-2.
The Cardinal filled just seven of
the 10 weight classes due to
injuries. Co-captain Lance Johnson
(150) joined teammate Todd Sur
mon (150) with a pulled hamstring.
Injuries to Roger Lin (190) and
Mark Meglay (heavyweight) left
additional gaps on the team.
"Jay and Matt looked impres
sive," Horpel said his team's show
ing. "The rest looked undertrained.
If we trained together [during vaca
tion] we would've done better."
