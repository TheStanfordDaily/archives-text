# Minority graduate student committee holds first meeting

While tangible advancement
was not evident at the first meet
ing of the Committee on the
Recruitment and Retention and
Graduation of Targeted Minori
ty Graduate Students, members
felt that the Dec. 8 meeting at
least framed some of the issues
the committee will explore.
"We spent our entire time
analyzing the proposed agenda
I had set out — and demolish
ing that," said Assoc. Dean of
Graduate Policy George
Dekker, the committee's chair.
"The progress was not the kind
that could be measured in lin
ear terms. But in a way, we
know perfectly well where
we're headed."
Provost Condoleezza Rice
assembled the committee last
quarter to look into the prob
lems in recruiting and retain
ing targeted minority graduate
students, after a Faculty Sen
ate report found that the Uni
versity fell 70 percent short of
their five-year recruitment goal
to double enrollment.
The 14-member committee,
which includes three graduate
students, will also examine
ways to improve Stanford's
poor record.
Although Dekker first pro
posed that the group examine
the experiences of each targeted
minority separately, he said

committee members "felt (the)
more natural way to tackle the
program was to see how each of
the main academic schools had
done, since that's where the
locus of responsibility has
been." Those targeted minori
ties are African-Americans,
Native Americans and Mexican-
American/Puerto Ricans.
But on many points, the
group is still looking at what
questions need to be asked,
according to committee mem
ber Elizabeth Fitting, student
services officer for the Gradu
ate School of Business.
Dekker said that the com
mittee would examine the spe
cific reasons why successful
applicants decide against
matriculating at Stanford; the
ratios of acceptance between
application, enrollment and
offers; recruitment efforts com
pared to other schools, includ
ing financial packages; and "a
question at least as important
— how well do they do while
they're here? "
However, Dekker said that
because of the low numbers of
minority graduate students, it
is sometimes hazardous to
extract meaningful data from
the numbers.
"If three students applied
over five years, and if two stu
dents get Ph.D.s, it's difficult to
generalize that (the) group had
a 67 percent graduation rate,"
Dekker said.
