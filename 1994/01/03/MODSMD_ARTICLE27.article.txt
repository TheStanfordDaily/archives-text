# Am Stud house submits self-op proposal
## 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
Residents of the American Studies theme
house in Governor's Corner have submitted a
proposal to the Office of Residential Educa
tion to change from a University-operated to a
self-operated residence.
House residents have already drafted a pro
posal under the guidance of Resident Fellows
Joseph and Wanda Corn and have also met with
Res Ed and Dining Service officials, according to
sophomore Mike Payne, who would become
house manager of the new self-op.
Payne said residents wanted the house to
change because self-ops are known for having
cheaper board plans, "much better food" and
a "small community feeling." He also said
American Studies — formerly Murray House
— would be a more desirable residence option
if it were a self-op.
In self-operated housing, residents hire
their own cook and purchase their own cook
ing equipment. Cleaning service is still provid
ed by the University.

"Self-ops have a great image these days,"
Payne said, pointing out that self-ops on the
Row have a reputation for superior food and a
more communal atmosphere.
Payne said he was optimistic that Universi
ty officials will approve the plans. "In the past
it's been easy," he said. But he added that the
plans are endangered by budget problems,
because Dining Service will lose revenue if the
house becomes a self-op.
Keith Guy, director of Housing and Dining
Services, said he did not know how much
American Studies' transition would cost, but
Joseph Corn placed Dining Service's potential
loss at "many thousands of dollars."
Guy said the transition will depend on bud
getary concerns within his office. If the plans
are approved, Dining Service would have to
compensate its lost revenue through increases
in room rent, either across campus, among all
self-ops or in the American Studies house alone.
American Studies' proposal will only be
approved, Guy said, if his office can come up
with an arrangement that would be fair to
everyone.

"What's the right thing to do. . . . That's
the real dilemma," Guy said.
Guy said that the loss of revenue from the
recent conversion of Row houses Muwekma
tah-Ruk, Grove, Roth and 558 Mayfield to self
operated housing was simply absorbed by Din
ing Service because the changes were finalized
after board plans had already been set.
"We just had to bite the bullet and take the
loss," he said.
Sophomore Josh Mangum, who would
become the house's financial manager, said
that although the change from University
operated housing to self-operated would
increase rent, the decrease in the board-plan
charges would result in a net savings.
Joseph Corn said that having free access to
a fully equipped kitchen would be a boon to
the house's theme-related activities. He said a
program on American food had to be held in
the RE apartment because the house's
kitchen was not fully equipped.
"Programmatically there will be a small
difference if we . . . can use the kitchen on our
terms, on our schedule," he said.
