# S. Africa investments no longer prohibited
## Stanford, other universities rescind sanctions as apartheid comes to end 
### Juthymas Harntha Editorial staff 
Following a nationwide trend of colleges
rescinding divestment policies, the Board of
Trustees last month decided to lift its ban
on buying stock in four companies that con
duct business in South Africa.
The board's special committee on invest
ment responsibility recommended ending
the ban after African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela called for lifting all
economic sanctions on the country last fall,
said trustee Roger Clay, the committee's
chair.
"We just decided to re-evaluate," Clay
said, adding that Stanford is on the tail end
of many universities and businesses which
have lifted their sanctions on South Africa.
"It was just a matter of timing," he said,
referring to the usual logistical hurdles that
prevented the committee from making the
recommendation earlier.
The four companies — Air Express In
ternational, CBI Industries, Grey Advertis
ing and the Interpublic Group of Compa
nies — were removed from the University's
stock portfolio in the 1980s.
Reacquisition of these companies' stocks
was not allowed until the University's Ad

visory Panel on Investment Responsibility
— comprised of faculty, staff, students and
alumni — judged that the businesses had
changed their policies in South Africa.
However, because of recent social
changes in South Africa indicating the end
of apartheid, the advisory panel
unanimously decided to recom
mend lifting Stanford's ban on
any company that gets a passing
rating under the Statement of
Principles program or under
State Department guidelines.
These are specific federal guide
lines put in place to evaluate com
panies that do business in South
Africa.
Only one company, Ingersoll
Rand, is still banned by the Uni
versity. Because the firm is still
selling equipment to the South
African Defense Forces, the advi
sory panel recommended that

Ingersoll Rand remain on the
banned list until free elections are
held in April.
Other colleges are also being
selective in their investment and
divestment choices. Smith Col
lege, for example, decided in Octo
ber to keep its divestment policy
until after the elections. However,
it will allow investments in com
panies that are moving back to
South Africa.
Many other institutions,
though, are completely rescinding
their divestment policies. In the
past few months, Columbia, Dart
mouth, Mount Holyoke, Michigan
State, Penn State, the University
of California system, and the Uni
versities of Colorado, Illinois,
Michigan, Notre Dame and Wash
ington have all done so.
