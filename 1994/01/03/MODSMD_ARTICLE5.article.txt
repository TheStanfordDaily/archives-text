# Settled?
## Stanford awarded nearly $23.5 million from estate, but appeals to continue 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Editorial staff 
A Los Angeles judge has ruled
that a controversial estate worth
approximately $100 million will
be shared by Stanford, the
Christian Science Church and
the Los Angeles County Muse
um of Art.
Superior Court Judge Arnold
H. Gold approved an out-of-court
settlement in mid-December that
gives Stanford and the museum
23.5 percent each of the t rusts of
sisters Bella Mabury and Eloise
Mabury Knapp. The Boston
based First Church of Christ, Sci
entist, will receive 53 percent.
Gold made his decision, which
ends a two-year-long legal fight,
after listening to and "not being
persuaded by" objections from
church members and distant rela
tives of Bella Mabury, said Mark
Epstein, a Los Angeles attorney
hired by the University to work on
the case.
The sisters bequeathed their
estates to the church on the condi
tion that it met several require
ments, including publishing and
distributing a controversial book
written by Eloise Knapp's hus
band If the church failed to fulfill
these terms, the wills stated that
Stanford and the museum would
split the estate. Bella Mabury at
tended Stanford for one year in

1891.
The lengthy legal debate,
which sparked dissension within
the church, concerned whether
the church met the requirements.
Some Christian Scientists have
called the hook heresy and said the
church, which has had recent fi
nancial troubles, printed the book
only for the trust money.
If a settlement had not been
reached, attorneys for Stanford,
the museum and the church said
the case could have gone on for
years, and legal fees would have
diminished the assets of both
trusts.
"It would have been very long
and bloody," Epstein said. "This
has been some of the most hard
fought, intensive litigation that
I've ever seen. By resolving this,
everyone avoided paying a
tremendous amount to lawyers."
Integrity for sale?
The book, titled "The Destiny
of the Mother Church," was writ
ten by Bliss Knapp, the son of an
early follower of church founder
Mary Raker Eddy. For decades,
the church refused to publish the
book because it likens Eddy to
•Jesus Christ — a violation of
church doctrine.
But in their wills, Mabury and
Eloise Knapp promised their be
quests to the church only if it
published the book as "authorized
literature" and displayed it in
"substantially all" Christian Sci
ence Reading Rooms.
In 1991, as the bequests' dead
line approached, the church
relented. But Stanford and the
museum challenged the church's
claim, contending that the church
had not printed the book as
authorized literature nor dis
tributed it in most reading rooms.
In the settlement agreement,
the church stated that a recent
third printing bears the "autho
rized literature" seal.
The church's decision to pub
lish the book ignited a rancorous
internal debate, causing several

members of its publishing society
to quit. Some reading rooms
refused to carry the book.
At the hearing, some members
argued that the church's board of
directors did not have the author
ity to publish the book.
"I believe that the integrity of
the church has been sold for $58
million," one church member told
the Associated Press after the
Dec. 15 hearing.
While Gold said he respected
the objectors, he said they did not
have standing to challenge the
settlement because they were not
in a position to elect the church's
board of directors.
Distant relatives of Mabury
also objected to the settlement,
saying that the trusts were never
intended to be divided. Gold
rejected those arguments as well,
saying that a litigated settlement
"might well do more harm" to the

sisters' wishes.
Appeals expected
Epstein said he expects the
groups who oppose the settlement
to appeal. The trust money will
not be paid until all appeals are
exhausted, he said.
The University currently has
no plans for using the trust money
— which comes with no restric
tions — Provost Condoleezza Rice
said. She did say, however, that if
Stanford receives the money, "it is
likely it would go to a number of
uses, rather than one single use."
Senior University Counsel
Carol Swenson said in a state
ment that she was "delighted
with [theJ careful and well
thought-out ruling."
"Everybody comes out for the
better, which is what I think Ms.
Knapp and Ms. Mabury would
have wanted," Epstein said.
