# Settled?
## Stanford awarded nearly $23.5 million from estate, but appeals to continue

A Los Angeles judge has ruled
that a controversial estate worth
approximately $100 million will
be shared by Stanford, the
Christian Science Church and
the Los Angeles County Muse
um of Art.
Superior Court Judge Arnold
H. Gold approved an out-of-court
settlement in mid-December that
gives Stanford and the museum
23.5 percent each of the t rusts of
sisters Bella Mabury and Eloise
Mabury Knapp. The Boston
based First Church of Christ, Sci
entist, will receive 53 percent.
Gold made his decision, which
ends a two-year-long legal fight,
after listening to and "not being
persuaded by" objections from
church members and distant rela

Epstein, a Los Angeles attorney
hired by the University to work on
the case.
The sisters bequeathed their
estates to the church on the condi
tion that it met several require
ments, including publishing and
distributing a controversial book
written by Eloise Knapp's hus
band If the church failed to fulfill
these terms, the wills stated that
Stanford and the museum would
split the estate. Bella Mabury at
tended Stanford for one year in

1891.
The lengthy legal debate,
which sparked dissension within
the church, concerned whether
the church met the requirements.
Some Christian Scientists have
called the hook heresy and said the
church, which has had recent fi
nancial troubles, printed the book
only for the trust money.
If a settlement had not been
reached, attorneys for Stanford,
the museum and the church said
the case could have gone on for
years, and legal fees would have
diminished the assets of both
trusts.
"It would have been very long
and bloody," Epstein said. "This
has been some of the most hard
fought, intensive litigation that
I've ever seen. By resolving this,
everyone avoided paying a
tremendous amount to lawyers."
Integrity for sale?
The book, titled "The Destiny
of the Mother Church," was writ
ten by Bliss Knapp, the son of an
early follower of church founder
Mary Raker Eddy. For decades,
the church refused to publish the
book because it likens Eddy to
•Jesus Christ — a violation of
church doctrine.
But in their wills, Mabury and
Eloise Knapp promised their be
