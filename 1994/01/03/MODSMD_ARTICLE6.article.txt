# How about a longer break?
## CUE to examine academic calendar 
### Grace Lee Editorial staff 
Giving shape to three months
of intensive but abstract discus
sion, the Commission on Under
graduate Education laid out for
mal charges for five subgroups at
its final fall quarter meeting, but
will likely designate a few more
working groups in the coming
weeks.
The commission added an "aca
demic calendar" committee to its
list of four previously defined sub

groups on foreign language, ma
jors, breadth — which includes
distribution requirements and
CIV — and academic environ
ment, which encompasses advis
ing and residential education.
The new committee will ad
dress topics such as quarters vs.
semesters, units per course, and
the question that will likely domi
nate discussion: how long it takes
to graduate.
A subgroup on technology and
teaching will be formed once the
commission defines a formal mis-

sion for the
group, said com
mission chair
James Sheehan.
1 le said it is slated
to explore "differ
ent formats for
teaching," such
as the integration
of computer and
video in class-

rooms, as well as deal with issues
such as class size.
Sheehan said another "two or
three" more committees may be

formed early in the quarter as the
commission sees fit. He said there
is "very much a glimmer" of possi
bility that a group will be formed
to study the purpose of a Stanford
undergraduate education — ex
amining preparation for pre-pro
fessional and graduate programs,
among other issues.
In addition to handing down a
statement of purpose to each sub
committee, the commission
ironed out expectations for its own


Camarillo
relationship with the committees.
"People now understand how
the subcommittees are going to
relate to the commission as a
whole," Sheehan said. Through
out the process, "there is going to
be constant consultation," he
said. "The subcommittees are not
going to go off by themselves and
surprise us."
One assurance of ongoing com
munication is that each subgroup
will be chaired by a member of the
commission. Spanish Prof.
Guadalupe Valdes will chair the
foreign language committee; Eco
nomics Prof. Donald Brown,
majors; History Prof. A 1 Camaril
lo, academic environment; Shee
han, breadth; and Geoffrey Cox,
vice provost for institutional
planning, will chair the academic
calendar committee.
Committee sizes will vary from
five to about 10 members; most
will have two students on them,

Sheehan said. The ASSU is
expected to appoint student com
mittee members at the end of this
week, he said.
The ASSU received about 45
student applications for subcom
mittee membership, said junior
Luz Herrera, a member of the
commission and the ASSU's Stu
dent Advisory Group on Under
graduate Education.
Committees will meet once
student members are chosen.
Most faculty appointments were
made before winter break.
The groups will each set out to
tackle a wide range of issues relat
ed to their relatively broad
charges. Collectively, they have
set forth a packed agenda, with
few academic stones left
unturned.
The committee on academic
environment, chaired by Camaril
lo, will cover not only advising
and Residential Education, but
also public service, athletics and
student athletes. "There may be
other things added to it or
refined," he said.
"Advising will drive a lot of dis

cussion," Camarillo said, fore
casting that it would be the
group's "major agenda item ... It
is generally acknowledged that
(advising) is a source of great
problems."
Camarillo clarified that while
the committee will address the
question of Residential Educa
tion, it would be "more the aca
demic side of Res Ed" rather than
general dorm programming. It
will focus largely on the "connec
tions between formal academic
study in the classroom and theme
dorms," he said.
Eor the calendar committee,
"clearly the biggest issue is the
time to degree," said Cox, the
group's chair.
But it will address other topics
as well, such as the advantages of
quarters vs. semesters and the
perennial question of what to do
with Dead Week.
It will also give thought to the
summer term, and how to "make
that more a part of the routine
rather than the exception," Cox
said.
The committees on majors and

foreign language will start by
questioning basic assumptions —
for example, asking whether
there should be a language
requirement and examining
exactly what composes a success
ful major, Sheehan said.
Sheehan's committee on
"breadth" will explore how much
of a student's program should be
devoted to fulfilling distribution
requirements, how DRs should be
structured, and ways to "make
them coherent," he said.
It will also assess the effective
ness of the Cultures, Ideas and
Values program, and look at
ClV's relation to the other DRs.
Most commission members
expressed satisfaction at the divi
sion of the subgroups' areas of
study.
"I think we have a very good
game plan," said Cox, adding that
there was "pretty wide consen
sus" on the subcommittees.
The design of all the subgroups
was driven in part by a desire to
"think beyond the present system
... to think about different kinds
of relationships," Sheehan said.
