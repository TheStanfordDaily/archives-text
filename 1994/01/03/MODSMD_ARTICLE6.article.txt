# How about a longer break?
## CUE to examine academic calendar 
### Grace Lee Editorial staff 
Giving shape to three months
of intensive but abstract discus
sion, the Commission on Under
graduate Education laid out for
mal charges for five subgroups at
its final fall quarter meeting, but
will likely designate a few more
working groups in the coming
weeks.
The commission added an "aca
demic calendar" committee to its
list of four previously defined sub

groups on foreign language, ma
jors, breadth — which includes
distribution requirements and
CIV — and academic environ
ment, which encompasses advis
ing and residential education.
The new committee will ad
dress topics such as quarters vs.
semesters, units per course, and
the question that will likely domi
nate discussion: how long it takes
to graduate.
A subgroup on technology and
teaching will be formed once the
commission defines a formal mis-

sion for the
group, said com
mission chair
James Sheehan.
1 le said it is slated
to explore "differ
ent formats for
teaching," such
as the integration
of computer and
video in class-

rooms, as well as deal with issues
such as class size.
Sheehan said another "two or
three" more committees may be

formed early in the quarter as the
commission sees fit. He said there
is "very much a glimmer" of possi
bility that a group will be formed
to study the purpose of a Stanford
undergraduate education — ex
amining preparation for pre-pro
fessional and graduate programs,
among other issues.
In addition to handing down a
statement of purpose to each sub
committee, the commission
ironed out expectations for its own
