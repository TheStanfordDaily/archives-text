### Juthymas Harntha Editorial staff 
Five Stanford students have been awarded
Marshall scholarships this year, the highest
number in campus history.
The prestigious scholarships pay about
$20,000 annually to cover tuition, books,
travel and living expenses for American stu
dents to study at a British university of their
choice.
As they were advised when they applied,
this year's five winners — co-terminal stu
dent Angela Bakker, 1993 graduate Nicholas
Beim, senior Steven Farmer, senior Amy
Marx and 1992 graduate Lisa Nellor — have
all chosen very specific areas of study for
which their educational backgrounds have

A total of 37 scholarships —
out of 800 applicants — were
given out this year, which is
the 40th anniversary of the
program.

prepared them.
Bakker's Stanford career has centered al
most completely around medicine. An Eng
lish and biological sciences major, she also
serves as director of Parents of Childhood
Cancer Survivors and has' been a teaching as
sistant in chemistry and human biology

Last year, she organized a seminar in
bioethics through the Human Biology Pro
gram and was a research assistant at the
Children's Hospital, where she studied how
children's cancer can impact their parents.
Bakker will be studying Biochemistry and
Immunology at the University of Strathclyde.
Beim's academic pursuits — which include
film, international relations and political phi
losophy — are more varied than some of his
fellow award recipients, but he managed to
bring these areas together in his interest in
Russian history and politics, which he plans
to continue studying while earning his degree
in politics at Oxford University.
He came to Stanford having already ac-
quired a wealth of knowledge on
Russia. In 1990, he started the
first Stanford-Moscow exchange:
one Russian student came to
study at Stanford while he went
off to Moscow for a year. Beim
even spent the summer before
his one-year term working for
"60 Minutes" in Russia.
The changes Beim saw and
the work he did — which includ
ed a history project that gained
him access to the archives of the
October Revolution — hooked
him.
"It was emotional, exciting to
be there and watch local and
national politics and see an
empire collapse," he said.
Until he leaves next fall, Beim
said he will continue working for
the State Department's Newly
Independent States Task Force,
which is working on a project to
give aid to the many pieces of the
former Russian empire.
Farmer's focus is also in
international relations. And for
anyone who wonders how he
arrived at a topic as specific as
the impact of AIDS on health
care in Zimbabwe, he has a clear
and detailed explanation.
His father's job kept his fami
ly on the move when he was
young; they traveled everywhere
from Hungary to Bahrain. Natu
rally, when Farmer got to Stan
ford, he wanted to major in
international relations — but, he
wanted to study the one conti
nent in which he had not lived:
Africa.
A friend's father was from
Zimbabwe and Farmer visited
the country with them. That
visit, coupled with a longtime
interest in medicine, brought
him to his well-defined topic.
Farmer then starting working
on AIDS policy at Stanford's
Center for Research in Disease
Prevention, and later studied
policy-making at the South
African Foundation for Econom
ic Research. He spent last sum
mer in Zimbabwe researching
his particular topic.
During his next two years at

the University of London,
though, Farmer plans to expand
his topic to the impact of AIDS
on all aspects of policy-making in
Zimbabwe.
Marx's interests and skills
also lean strongly toward policy
making, but in the environmen
tal sector — a career choice that
has solidified after a series of
environmental internships at
the Office of Management and
Budget, the Office of Technolog
ical Assessment and the Califor
nia Assembly.
Her goal of earning a master's
degree in applied philosophy at
the University of Kent may seem
far removed from her back
ground, but Marx explained the
apparent disparity by saying
that she wants to go about envi
ronmental policy-making in a
new way.
Frustrated with "the limita
tions of traditional policy," she
said she wants to incorporate
concepts of equity and justice
into policy decisions.
And Marx expects her aca
demic work to come into prac
tice: after finishing her master's,
law school as well as becoming
governor of Massachusetts are in
her plans.
Nellor is planning a career in
art — hoping particularly to
work in museums — after she
finishes her master's in art his
tory at the University of Lon
don's Courtauld School of Art.
Within her American studies
major, Nellor focused on an inter
disciplinary study of art history,
writing her honors thesis about
the controversy over the National
Endowment for the Arts.
A total of 37 Marshall Schol
arships — out of 800 applicants
— were given out this year,
which is the 40th anniversary of
the program. The scholarships
are paid for by the British gov
ernment, which established
them in 1953 as a national ges
ture of thanks to the United
States for the aid it received
under the Marshall Plan after
World War 11.
This year, Harvard has five
recipients, Yale and Princeton
have two each, while MIT, UC-

one.

art — hoping particularly to
work in museums — after she
finishes her master's in art his
tory at the University of Lon
don's Courtauld School of Art.
Within her American studies
major, Nellor focused on an inter
disciplinary study of art history,
writing her honors thesis about
the controversy over the National
Endowment for the Arts.
A total of 37 Marshall Schol
arships — out of 800 applicants
— were given out this year,
which is the 40th anniversary of
the program. The scholarships
are paid for by the British gov
ernment, which established
them in 1953 as a national ges
ture of thanks to the United
States for the aid it received
under the Marshall Plan after
World War 11.
This year, Harvard has five
recipients, Yale and Princeton
have two each, while MIT, UC-
Berkeley and UCLA each have
one.
Five Stanford students have been awarded
Marshall scholarships this year, the highest
number in campus history.
The prestigious scholarships pay about
$20,000 annually to cover tuition, books,
travel and living expenses for American stu
dents to study at a British university of their
choice.
As they were advised when they applied,
this year's five winners — co-terminal stu
dent Angela Bakker, 1993 graduate Nicholas
Beim, senior Steven Farmer, senior Amy
Marx and 1992 graduate Lisa Nellor — have
all chosen very specific areas of study for
which their educational backgrounds have

prepared them.
Bakker's Stanford career has centered al
most completely around medicine. An Eng
lish and biological sciences major, she also
serves as director of Parents of Childhood
Cancer Survivors and has' been a teaching as
sistant in chemistry and human biology

Last year, she organized a seminar in
bioethics through the Human Biology Pro
gram and was a research assistant at the
Children's Hospital, where she studied how
children's cancer can impact their parents.
Bakker will be studying Biochemistry and
Immunology at the University of Strathclyde.
Beim's academic pursuits — which include
film, international relations and political phi
losophy — are more varied than some of his
fellow award recipients, but he managed to
bring these areas together in his interest in
Russian history and politics, which he plans
to continue studying while earning his degree
in politics at Oxford University.
He came to Stanford having already ac-
quired a wealth of knowledge on
Russia. In 1990, he started the
first Stanford-Moscow exchange:
one Russian student came to
study at Stanford while he went
off to Moscow for a year. Beim
even spent the summer before
his one-year term working for
"60 Minutes" in Russia.
The changes Beim saw and
the work he did — which includ
ed a history project that gained
him access to the archives of the
October Revolution — hooked
him.
"It was emotional, exciting to
be there and watch local and
national politics and see an
empire collapse," he said.
Until he leaves next fall, Beim
said he will continue working for
the State Department's Newly
Independent States Task Force,
which is working on a project to
give aid to the many pieces of the
former Russian empire.
Farmer's focus is also in
international relations. And for
anyone who wonders how he
arrived at a topic as specific as
the impact of AIDS on health
care in Zimbabwe, he has a clear
and detailed explanation.
His father's job kept his fami
ly on the move when he was
young; they traveled everywhere
from Hungary to Bahrain. Natu
rally, when Farmer got to Stan
ford, he wanted to major in
international relations — but, he
wanted to study the one conti
nent in which he had not lived:
Africa.
A friend's father was from
Zimbabwe and Farmer visited
the country with them. That
visit, coupled with a longtime
interest in medicine, brought
him to his well-defined topic.
Farmer then starting working
on AIDS policy at Stanford's
Center for Research in Disease
Prevention, and later studied
policy-making at the South
African Foundation for Econom
ic Research. He spent last sum
mer in Zimbabwe researching
his particular topic.
During his next two years at

the University of London,
though, Farmer plans to expand
his topic to the impact of AIDS
on all aspects of policy-making in
Zimbabwe.
Marx's interests and skills
also lean strongly toward policy
making, but in the environmen
tal sector — a career choice that
has solidified after a series of
environmental internships at
the Office of Management and
Budget, the Office of Technolog
ical Assessment and the Califor
nia Assembly.
Her goal of earning a master's
degree in applied philosophy at
the University of Kent may seem
far removed from her back
ground, but Marx explained the
apparent disparity by saying
that she wants to go about envi
ronmental policy-making in a
new way.
Frustrated with "the limita
tions of traditional policy," she
said she wants to incorporate
concepts of equity and justice
into policy decisions.
And Marx expects her aca
demic work to come into prac
tice: after finishing her master's,
law school as well as becoming
governor of Massachusetts are in
her plans.
