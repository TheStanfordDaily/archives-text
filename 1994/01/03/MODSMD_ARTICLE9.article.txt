# Work groups forging ahead with Med Center reorganization
## 
### Josh Green Staff writer 
After four months of meetings, six working
groups reviewing recommendations for a major reor
ganization of the Medical Center submitted reports
to University President Gerhard Casper at the end
of fall quarter.
The groups, made up of faculty and administra
tors, had the formidable task of sorting through a
report released June 15 by the Strategic Planning
Task Force.
The report, commissioned by Casper last Jan
uary, called for a consolidation of physician practice
and hospital practice to assure that important rev
enue generated by patients would keep the Medical
Center financially afloat.
Hospital officials refused to release details about
the working groups' recommendations since they
have not been made public yet. But the groups gen
erally support the fusing of the two sides of health
care in the Medical Center, according to Kenneth
Bloem, president and CEO of Stanford Hospital.
The task force is also charged with improving
coordination among the three institutions within the

Medical Center — the School of Medicine, the Stan
ford Clinic and the Stanford Hospital — which cur
rently work separately from each other.
"If you asked members of the groups about the
general conclusions, you'd be struck by the high level
of consensus and enthusiasm there is," Bloem said.
"There was remarkably little controversy."
Casper is expected to reconvene the Strategic
Planning Task Force in the next few weeks to com
pile and analyze the reports.
Casper will then take the recommendations,
changed at his discretion, to the Board of Trustees,
said Geoffrey Cox, the University's vice provost for
institutional planning.
"The trustees will consider at least some of this in
February," Cox said.
The changes in the hospital system, soon to be
called the Stanford Health System, were spurred by
losses incurred by the health care market due to an
increase in "managed care" plans and HMOs.
"Much of the revenue the hospital gets is not
from the University, but from patients serviced by
the hospital," said Peter Van Etten, the university's
chief financial officer. "We want to assure that our
patient revenue will continue to grow."
