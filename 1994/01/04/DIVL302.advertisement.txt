CTL 10A Learning by Design
The more I discover about how I learn, the more I realize the extent of the mismatch between the ways in which I am being
given information and the forms of presentation that work best for me. Textbooks, manuals, videotapes, lectures, workshops,
and even my own study sessions and discussions with friends or tutors are rarely if ever optimized to match my strengths as a
learner. Once I understand this fact, I am in a position to begin assuming responsibility for the redesign of my process of
studying. This course provides a personalized set of tools that are extremely helpful precisely at those moments when we crash
into difficult concepts for the first time.
One unit. For the first five weeks of the quarter. Ends on Feb. 7. MW 12:15
