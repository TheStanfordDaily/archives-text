J is offering:
CTL 182 CREATING LEARNING ORGANIZATIONS
TAUGHT BY JAMES I). MILOJKOVIC, I'h.l)
Executive Vice President, Creative Directions, Inc.
This coursc is designed to help managers, would-be managers,
and their organizations construct new and more powerful busi
ness practices through becoming more aware of their own
learning processes. By challenging habits and personal and
organizational myths that disable learning, the capacity to
learn can be enhanced radically. In turn, the nature of organi
zational learning and action can be transformed for reactive to
proactive to high performance. Topics include language, struc
ture, and change; learning styles and the intelligence trap; par
adox, institution, and breakthrough; leverage of systems; emo
tion, attachment and successful failure; shared vision and stra
tegic intent; team and organizational learning.
