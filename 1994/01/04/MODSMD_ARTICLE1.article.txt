# Despite hardships, study of ASSU to continue
## 
### Cindy Yu Staff writer 
In spite of problems staffing
some working groups, second
year law student David Smolen is
forging ahead with his plan to
conduct a comprehensive review

oftheASSU.
"We're still re
cruiting and try
ing to fill out the
ranks, with the
goal being to get
going [this| quar
ter in earnest,"
Smolen said.
Smolen is
working to con
duct a year-long

•112 o
study of the ASSU and will pro
vide recommendations this spring
on how to improve the student or
ganization.
He said the groups involved in
the study will begin their work in
the next few weeks.
So far, Smolen has divided the
task into five different categories,
each represented by a working
group: fee assessment/student
group funding, strategic financial
plan/banking, review and revision
oftheASSU Constitution, history
of the ASSU and student feed
back.


Smolen
According to the original plan,
each group was to have one or two
leaders and six members, said
Smolen, last year's recipient of an
Alumni Association award which
provides $1,500 each year for an
innovative student project.
However, Smolen did not
encounter equal interest in all the
groups; he received a good
response to the finance-related
groups and little response to the
others.
The funding and strategic
financial planning groups are now
staffed with two managers and
eight or more students, Smolen
said.
The review and revision group

has two managers and just three
students, while the history group
has one manager and three stu
dents. The student feedback
group currently has no staff at all.
"I'm not going to let [an
unstaffed student feedback
groupl hold us back," Smolen
said. "I was willing to hold up the
review if the review and revision
of the ASSU constitution group
and the history of the ASSU
group were not staffed."
He said he will work on student
feedback himself if enlisting the
help of student groups does not
fill out the staff.
Because Smolen is working
with a limited budget, he says he
finds himself "restricted in many
ways." But he vowed to continue
searching for interested students
until "we have fleshed out all of
[the working groups]."

The staff shortage has not pre
vented the board of managers,
consisting of the working group
heads, from setting their goals.
"The review is a system of
checks and balances to insure
what's going on is what should
be," said strategic financial
plan/banking working group co
manager Ira Ehrenpreis, a sec
ond-year graduate student in the
joint J.D.-M.B.A. program.
The fee assessment/student
group funding working group
plans to assess ASSU fee collection
as well as its distribution system
which, according to co-chair Jere
my Brest, will be accomplished by
talking to current ASSU senators
and officers as well as speaking
with student groups.
The co-chair of the group in
charge of reviewing and revising
the ASSU constitution, first-year

law student Curtis Kin, said his
primary goal "is to determine
what form of student government
would best represent all aspects of
the student body."
One thing that all the man
agers said they are concerned
about is maintaining diversity
within each group, since members
will represent the entire student
body.
"We want to encourage diversi
ty in our group. ... In order to
come to a good conclusion all stu
dents should be represented,"
said first-year business school
student Borge Hald, who man
ages the fee assessment/student
group funding working group
with Brest.
Smolen and the board of man
agers have had little direct con
tact with ASSU senators so far,
purposely distancing themselves

so they can be more objective.
Senators and members of the
Council of Presidents say they
understand this position.
"One of the goals lof the
review) is to make it as indepen
dent as possible. I don't expect
much contact since it's supposed
to be an unbiased review," said
Council of Presidents member
Ron Brown.
"ISmolenl has intentionally
kept his distance from the politi
cal leadership of the ASSU," said
ASSU Senate Chair Greg Wal
dorf, a second-year business stu
dent. He added that he is "in firm
support" of the review.
However, Waldorf also ex
pressed concern over the timeli
ness of the review. "This senate's
term ends in April, so the sugges
tions for this term may be dead on
arrival," he said.
