# Clinton may hike gun-dealer fee
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Clinton
administration will ask Congress to
require gun dealers to pay $600 a year
for licenses and estimates the sharp
increase will drastically reduce the num
ber of dealers, administration and con
gressional officials said yesterday.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen
will unveil the proposal today to raise
the fee along with others intended to
give authorities more control over the
244,000 licensed firearms dealers, said
officials who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms estimates that 80 percent of
dealers would not renew their license if
forced to pay $600 a year, roughly what
it costs to process the applications and
inspect dealers.
Since 1968, the license has cost $30
for three years. The vast majority of
firearms dealers obtained licenses, usu
ally without a background check, to buy
weapons at deep discount and to avoid
state and local restrictions. The license
enables dealers to have guns shipped to
them across state lines.
The three-year fee was raised to $200
for new licenses and $90 for renewals in

the recently enacted Brady Bill, which
also imposes a five-day waiting period for
handgun purchases.
Bentsen said in an interview last
month that the Treasury Department
was preparing a proposal to sharply raise
the fees as part of a larger crackdown on
violent crime.
"It makes no sense at all. . . to have a
very minimum payment where you have
people even operating out of their
kitchens," Bentsen told The Associated
Press.
Bentsen also will unveil proposals to
expand the number of ATF officials
inspecting gun dealers and to upgrade
the agency's computerized record-keep
ing system to better track firearms, an
administration official said.
The secretary will voice support for
legislation pending in Congress to lift
the legal restriction that permits only
one ATF inspection of a gun dealer each
year, officials said.
He will also announce administration
proposals to require licensed gun dealers
to abide by state and local ordinances
and to give ATF information to help
agents trace guns involved in crimes.
A similar provision was passed by the

Senate in anti-crime legislation pending
in Congress.
ATF does not have power now to
withhold or revoke a license from some
one who does not follow local laws, such
as ordinances prohibiting gun business
es to be operated near schools or in pub
lic housing projects.
Nor can ATF compel dealers to
respond to request for gun-trace infor
mation.
National Rifle Association lobbyist
Joe Phillips said the proposed fee is
"entirely unjustified" and about five
times the actual cost of issuing the
license.
"What Secretary Bentsen is doing is
just another example of attempting to
recover the cost of criminal investiga
tions by jacking up the price the law
abiding firearms dealers have to pay,"
Phillips said.
Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y.,
chairman of a House Judiciary crime
subcommittee, has already proposed leg
islation that would require licensed deal
ers to undergo a background check.
License holders would be required under
Schumer's bill to have a legitimate place
of business.
