						self-service surge 
### 
LAST MONTH, residents of
the American Studies theme
house submitted a proposal
to the Office of Residential Educa
tion to change from a University
operated to a self-operated resi
dence.
This proposal comes on the
heels of the conversion of Muwek
ma-tah-Ruk, Grove, Roth and
558 Mayfield to self-operated
housing, and represents another
potential loss from Dining Ser
vice's coffers.
But even though it will deprive
the University of "many thou
sands of dollars," in the words of
American Studies' resident fel
low, administrators should give
the proposal serious considera
tion.
The American Studies theme
house was formerly a self-operated
house on the Row; only this year
did it shift to its current Universi
ty-operated location.
This history, as well as the fact

that theme houses traditionally
have non-traditional dining
demands that are best met by
their particular residents, sug
gests that the conversion to a self
operating status is the best possi
ble move for the house and its res
idents.
Officials at Dining Service have
stated that the shift will be
approved only if the office can
develop an arrangement that will
be fair to everyone who will either
directly or indirectly be affected â€”
an understandable stance. There
is no reason why students from
other dorms should suffer because
of the shift.
Yet Dining Service should also
recognize that the ever-increasing
interest in self-operated housing
could also represent a sense of dis
satisfaction with the service that
students are receiving from the
University, even though that does
not appear to be a factor in the
American Studies case.
