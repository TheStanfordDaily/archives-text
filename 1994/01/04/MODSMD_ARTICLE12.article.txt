THOUGH IT may not appear
to be an earthshaking
change, the recent automa
tion of the library checkout system
promises to be a boon to students,
faculty and staff alike.
The system, which library
staffers began working on approxi
mately four years ago, utilizes bar
codes on each work, and will elimi
nate the need to fill out time-con
suming information cards. More
than 80 percent of Green Library's
collections are currently bar
coded. Several other University
libraries have already completed
the bar-coding process, but the
institution of the system at Green
will vastly increase the number of
students able to utilize the new
procedure.
By eliminating the lengthy
checkout cards, borrowers and
librarians will save valuable time.
Furthermore, the bar-codes will
allow students and faculty to check

Socrates to discover if a particular
book has been checked out, pre
venting the occasional unneces
sary trip to the South Stacks.
Finally, library staff, many of
whom volunteered their time to
assist in the bar-coding process,
will be spared tedious tasks such as
typing overdue notices, allowing
them to spend more time with the
collections themselves as well as
library patrons.
Moreover, the bar-coding sig
nals that even in a climate of
budget cuts, Stanford and its
staff members are still willing to
take steps to improve the Univer
sity community. Bar-coding may
not be as important as the
research being done in Stan
ford's laboratories or as thought
provoking as the speeches of Uni
versity professors, but it is a
small step toward improving the
lives of the men and women at
Stanford.
