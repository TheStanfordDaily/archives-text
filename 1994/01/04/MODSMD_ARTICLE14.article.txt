## Belated season's greetings 
### 
I AM NOT Christian hut I love Christ
mas. Sure there are moments when I
feel deluged by aggressive retail
salespersons, crowded stores and corny
carols. These moments cannot detract
from the joy of the season's festivities
and the time off from school.
While there are people who do take
Christmas as a serious religious holiday,
that is not the case for the vast majority
in our society.
The season has become a time for us
to see family and friends, purchase and
receive gifts, and just take it easy.
The season includes New Year's Eve
when we all drink a little too much,
make a lot of senseless noise, and make
resolutions we will never keep. I
always look forward to waking up for a
full day of college football on televi
sion.
It always strikes me as odd that some
non-Christians are offended by the holi
day. While it is very true that Christmas
trees are far more numerous than meno
rahs or other displays, I think that those
who are offended are reading too much
symbolism into what they see. Mow
many people really put up their trees
with the nativity in mind?
By admiring or displaying a Christ
mas tree I am not endorsing a religious
viewpoint any more than when I pur
chase a print of a Renaissance painting.
Why can't we see a Christmas tree for
what it is — a pretty tree.

I am not saying that everyone should
actively go out and celebrate the holiday.
We all do have our own particular per
spective on the season, much of which is
conditioned by culture and religion.
However, I am objecting to the hyper
sensitivity of those who reject every
object which, in practice, is only vaguely
tied to a particular creed.
Is someone trying to make converts of
us all? Not in the least. The store clerk
who wishes me a "Merry Christmas"
and the restaurant which plays "Joy to
the World, the Lord has Come" are not
trying to convert anyone.
The Christmas tree in the dorm
lounge is not there to attack my reli
gious heritage.
Christmas and the holiday season
are not about words and symbols. It
does not matter what you call your
God. It does not matter if Santa Claus
or Hanukkah Harry is the provider of
gifts.
Our status as a pluralistic society
does not necessarily mean that we must
remove all vestiges and vague references
to particular viewpoints from our public
activities.
Should we stop speaking English
because it is derived from Indo-Euro
pean roots? Does every dorm cafeteria
have an obligation to give equal repre
sentation to all ethnic cuisines? Imag
ine the society we could build. We
would be able to pontificate in incom

prehensible tongues while we sample a
selection of exotic food service concoc
tions.
It really is impossible to emasculate
common activities of all cultural and
religious heritage.
Our challenge, I believe, as an inclu
sive, diverse society is to find secular
moments we all can enjoy. Language,
food and the Christmas holiday season
are really three of the best we've got.
Everyone should be free to celebrate
whatever holiday he or she desires.
Those who choose to make little out of
the holiday season, that is their right.
But let's not mischaracterize what is
truly a secular and material experience
for us all as something religiously
exclusive. The Christmas holiday sea
son is an American celebration of the
almighty dollar and the warmth of
family.
1 will continue to love the holiday sea
son as long as school and the workplace
are closed, the presents are large, and
the bowl games are competitive.
When Jeremi spoke of large gifts, he
meant something along the lines of that
new Porsche. It's not too late — there are
plenty of after-Christmas sales. He'll
also accept cash.
