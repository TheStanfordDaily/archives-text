# Mascot Contest Winners
## 
### 
The Daily is featuring winning
entrants in its mascot contest. Today's
suggestions, the Stanford Axe (below)
and the Stanford Spike (right) were
both submitted by David Chang, Todd
Davies and Tyson Vaughan.
Regarding the former, the entrants
state that, "The Axe is already part of
the rich Stanford tradition, and making
it a mascot would be a relatively easy
matter." Of the latter, "The Spike

stands for many things that are distinct
ly Stanford, and uniquely American . . .
Also, being made of iron and gold, the
Spike connotes beauty, value, strength
and stability."
Note: Yesterday's entrant, the Stan
ford Engine (submitted by Roger Lee),
was also suggested by alumnus Burt For
naciari.
The Daily thanks all participants for
their contributions.
