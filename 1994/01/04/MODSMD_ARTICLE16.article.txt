# N'Gai Croal: notes of a non-native son
## Spielberg's Oskar: perversion of the word 'hero'? 
### 
THh I RAILERS FOR Steven Spiel
berg s latest film, "Schindler's
List," appropriate the Talmudic
saying, "He who saves one life, saves the
world entire." But the film leaves us
asking the question, "What about he
who takes one life? Ten lives? One hun
dred lives?"
Or even 1101 lives?
Spielberg can't answer that question
because it would expose the blindness
that lies at the heart of his vision: a
moral myopia that turns the Holocaust
into one Nazi's redemption story, with
out ever examining the mindset that led
to the Final Solution — and leads to
ethnic cleansing around the world
today.
Oskar Schindler, a womanizing capi
talist and former member of the Nazi
party in letter, if not in spirit, leased
Jewish slave labor for his factory from
the SS, because they were cheaper than
Poles. After witnessing the liquidation
of the Cracow ghetto, he begins to aban
don his avaricious ways. He eventually
takes his 1100 Jews out of the night
marish Flaszow labor camp to a new
factory in the Sudetenland. There, they
are free to keep the Sabbath as well as
their lives until the end of the war, at
which point Schindler sets them free.
We don't see Spike Lee or John Sin
gleton rushing to make a movie about
Thomas Jefferson freeing his slaves, so
it could seem a bit odd that Spielberg
chose to confront the Holocaust in a
Gentile-saves-Jews narrative. But it
really isn't. From the cartoon Nazis of
his "Indiana Jones" trilogy to his

unquestioned statements in the latest
Premiere magazine — likening Oskar
Schindler to über-agent Mike Ovitz and
former Warner Bros. CEO Steve Ross —
this is clearly a film that Spielberg was
born to make. Schindler and Spielberg
are a match made in Hollywood; the
story's happy ending fits right into his
accentuate-the-positive, eliminate-the
negative formula.
Here, Spielberg doesn't actually elim
inate the negative. "Schindler's List" is
at its strongest when it details the Holo
caust's atrocities, which the Nazis mete
out in both meticulously planned and
psychotically random fashion. But he
uses the negative to make us long for
the positive: any scene with Schindler,
wining, dining, scheming and scamming
the vicious Nazis and attractive
friiuleins around him — anything that
takes us away from having to see people
being killed.
Consequently, we rarely see any Jews
talking to one another, planning to
escape or rebel, comforting, sharing,
laughing, crying. Without any traits
that would make them human instead
of stick figures or numbers, we become
an audience of Nazis, able to watch
someone killed and forget about it fif
teen minutes later. Because Spielberg is
telling Schindler's story, the Jewish
characters — decrepit grandmothers,
black market privateers, attractive
women and prickly accountants —
become dignified versions of stereotypes
that would have fit right into Nazi doc
trine. They are extras in their own
story.

Worse, Spielberg encourages us to
identify with Schindler's Nazi-like
behaviors. Early in the film, when he is
looking for a secretary, he has a parade
of Jewish women — each one more
beautiful than the last — demonstrate
their typing skills. As each new typist
arrives, his lack of interest in their typ
ing skills becomes more apparent, until
a heavy-set, plain-faced, chain-smoking
woman arrives and proves the best typ
ist. Schindler becomes distraught, but
he comes up with a solution: he hires
them all. How much of their time is
spent typing is a subject that Spielberg
doesn't address.
In a subsequent scene, a Jewish
woman comes to Schindler's office to
ask for his help. He takes a look at her
from where he stands at the top of the
stairs, walks away, and has his secretary
tell the woman that he isn't in. The
woman goes away, buys make-up and a
low-cut dress, then returns to the facto
ry. The scene is repeated as before, but
this time, Schindler is only too willing
to see her. The audience laughs at both
scenes without realizing that the philos
ophy and abuse of power that led to the
Final Solution lie along the same con
tinuum as Schindler's own — if you
don't look or dress or act a certain way,
you are literally not human. And if you
aren't human, why should I care
whether you live or die? It's just anoth
er of the many questions that Spielberg
can't answer.
When Schindler finally gets religion,
he becomes holier than any horn-again.
He becomes more sensitive to the Jew-

ish accountant who runs his empire,
spends all of his blood money to evacu
ate "his Jews," as he calls them, and
even stops cheating on his wife. When
he moves the workers to a factory that
will produce munitions, he orders them
to sabotage their product so that it can't
be used by the Nazis. How clever, we
think to ourselves. And since his old fac
tory produced pots and pans, he never
killed anyone.
That's one way of looking at it.
Another might be a scene that shows
Jews on an assembly line making a pot,
then packaging the pot and shipping it
to a concentration camp. There, a cook
takes the pot a uses it to prepare a thick
German broth. The cook takes the pot
out to a table of hungry SS officers.
Once they are well-fortified by their
meal, the officers go outside and shoot a
handful of Jews who don't get out of
their way fast enough. Or look at them
funny. Or just because they feel like it.
That scene isn't in "Schindler's List."
It's doubtful that Spielberg even
thought of a scene like that, and with
good reason. Because to show that begs
the question: why make this film in the
first place? Schindler used Jews to make
a profit on the war, then turned around
saved them. But if one person, or two,
or 1101 people were killed, indirectly, so
that Schindler could collect his thirty
pieces of silver, is this someone that we
want to elevate to sainthood and call a
hero?
Or is it merely a perversion of the
term?
So when President Clinton sees the

film, then says that the ethnic cleans
ing, mass rapes and murders in modern
day Bosnia are completely different
from the Holocaust, don't ask whether 6
million Muslims have to die before we
intervene. When Newsweek concludes
an opinion piece on the film by saying
that somewhere in one of the world's
trouble spots, an Oskar Schindler is
waiting to happen, don't wonder
whether victims of war need someone to
enslave them for profit and then free
them.
And when Spielberg takes home his
very own Oscar for "Schindler's List" —
without ever identifying the discourse
that led to the enslavement of Africans
and the genocide of Native Americans
before the Holocaust, as well as Stalin's
purges and the Khmer Rouge's mass
murders afterwards, don't waste your
time saying that the film will do nothing
to stop these atrocities from happening
in the future. "That's entertainment,"
Robert DeNiro said in "Raging Bull";
truer words were never spoke.
But outside of Hollywood, the ques
tion remains: How many people have to
die before we wake up?

For those of us who blithely say, "Never
again," N'Gai Croal suggests the 1993
Pulitzer Prize-winning book "A Witness
To Genocide," a collection of reports and
photos from Bosnia written by Newsday
foreign correspondent Roy Gut man.
Never is happening again right now.
