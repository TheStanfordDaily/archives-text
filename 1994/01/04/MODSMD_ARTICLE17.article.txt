## Changing of the guard: Knight shines Rookie leads rejuvenated Cardinal 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
If you were to watch Brevin Knight race
along the basketball court for just a few
minutes, the word "super-mega-energetic"
would probably be your best attempt at
describing his fast-paced style. If the word
existed, that is.
Though Knight's collegiate career is but
nine games old, he has already caught the
attention of many basketball afficionados
by helping the Cardinal jump out to an
impressive 7-2 record.
Whether he's pickpocketing his man on
defense or driving past his guard on
offense, the 5-foot-10 point guard is con
tributing more to the Cardinal than what is
normally expected of a first-year player.
"I'm not surprised by his play, but I'm a
little bit surprised by the numbers [in
terms of points, steals and assists)," said
coach Mike Montgomery. "What you'd
think is that a freshman might come in and
kind of start slow and let other guys do it,
but he's really taking an active role."
Knight took an extremely active role two
weeks ago in the Cardinal's game against
McNeese State. Barely missing a triple
double, a feat never before accomplished by
a Stanford player, Knight racked up 21
points, 10 steals and nine assists in leading
the squad to a 91-75 victory.
Knight's vigorous play has turned the
Cardinal into more of a fast-breaking team,
a style with which he is quite comfortable.
"Being the floor general, running the
team, that's just normal to me," he said.
His enthusiasm away from the hard
wood helps keep his teammates loose.
"He's hilarious. He keeps us in a good
mood," said senior forward Brent Williams.
"We treat him like our little brother off the
court, but when we get on the court, we
respect him enough to run the offense."
Knight's constant energy has also
helped him to overcome the potential dis
advantage of being one of the shorter play
ers on the door. However, what he lacks in
his size, he more than makes up for with
his speed.
"He uses his quickness as an advantage
to him," Williams said. "He beats his man
and gives others the opportunity to get the
ball when the defenders help out on him."

Knight's quick reflexes have worked
wonders on defense as well.
"He's caused some turnovers that have
allowed us to get some (fast) breaks,"
Montgomery said. "A couple of games he
took the other team's guards and got them
off-balance with his defense arid his quick
ness."
Since he first set foot onto a nearby play
ground in East Orange, N.J., at the tender
age of seven, Knight has learned how to
benefit from these speedy reflexes. He
adopted a style of play which allowed him to
thrive in the rough-and-tumble pickup
games typical of that setting.

'Hey, I'm going to try to
turn [Stanford] into a
basketball school.'

"Playing on the playground will make
you play better," Knight said. "They make
you play hard, and you don't call fouls."
The playground also taught Knight how
to excel in competitive situations, a trait
which he displayed in winning the starting
point guard job during the preseason.
"I've been competing all my life," he
said. "Competition is what you look for.
You don't want to just come in and say 'I
got [the starting spot] for no reason.'
That's when you start to get lazy."
Knight's ability to handle pressure paid
off recently in a come-from-behind over
time victory at Santa Clara. The freshman
contributed eight of his team-high 23
points in the overtime period to help clinch
the Cardinal's 82-70 victory.
Not only did the victory boost Knight's
confidence, but it was also instrumental in
starting the Stanford squad off on the right
foot after a woeful 7-23 season last year.
"A lot of people doubted us," Knight
said. "We went into their place and beat
them in overtime after being down by 15
points. That's something I'll always
remember."
