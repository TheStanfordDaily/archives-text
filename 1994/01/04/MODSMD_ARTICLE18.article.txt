SANTA CLARA, CaJif. â€” Under the circus
tent known as Toso Pavilion, the women's bas
ketball team walked a first-half highwire last
night before eventually taming the Santa Clara
Broncos, 83-65.
Despite pulling away in the game's later stages,
Stanford (7-2) looked flat early in its bid to record
a sixth straight win. Playing before a bipartisan
crowd of 2,152, the Cardinal allowed the Broncos
(8-2) to jump out to a 27-16 advantage at the 13-
minute mark.
"Quick fouls early on hurt us big," said Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer.
Indeed, the Cardinal committed 12 personal
fouls before intermission, allowing Santa Clara to
connect on 10 of 15 free throw attempts, includ
ing five of seven during the Broncos' scoring run.
With the pace of the game slowed, however,
Santa Clara, which enjoys the frenetic cadence
Stanford usually employs, could not take full
advantage of the Cardinal's early lapses. While
Stanford mustered only 14-of-35 shooting before
intermission, the Broncos reeled off an incredible
29 missed field goals while shooting only 32 per
cent, keeping the Cardinal in the game.
Stanford did not need any more incentive to get
things turned around. After falling behind in dou
ble figures for the first time since its last loss, to
Tennessee, the Cardinal closed the first half with
an 18-6 run of its own, taking a 34-33 lead and a
good deal more confidence into the locker room.
"We got a good spurt, running back-door
layups and playing an aggressive game to pick up
the pace," VanDerveer said.
Perhaps no one embodied the sudden improve
ment in the Cardinal's play more than freshman
forward Kate Starbird, who tossed in a layup and
a driving five-foot bank shot among her six points
near the end of the frame. Starbird led the team
with 10 first-half points and would end up with a
game-high 19, the second-best output of her
young Stanford career.
"When they started playing pressure defense
and allowing us to fast-break, it played right into
my style," said Starbird, alluding to the Broncos'
