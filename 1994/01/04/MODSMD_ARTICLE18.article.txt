# Broncos busted!
## Hoopsters win a 83-65 contest 
### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
SANTA CLARA, CaJif. â€” Under the circus
tent known as Toso Pavilion, the women's bas
ketball team walked a first-half highwire last
night before eventually taming the Santa Clara
Broncos, 83-65.
Despite pulling away in the game's later stages,
Stanford (7-2) looked flat early in its bid to record
a sixth straight win. Playing before a bipartisan
crowd of 2,152, the Cardinal allowed the Broncos
(8-2) to jump out to a 27-16 advantage at the 13-
minute mark.
"Quick fouls early on hurt us big," said Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer.
Indeed, the Cardinal committed 12 personal
fouls before intermission, allowing Santa Clara to
connect on 10 of 15 free throw attempts, includ
ing five of seven during the Broncos' scoring run.
With the pace of the game slowed, however,
Santa Clara, which enjoys the frenetic cadence
Stanford usually employs, could not take full
advantage of the Cardinal's early lapses. While
Stanford mustered only 14-of-35 shooting before
intermission, the Broncos reeled off an incredible
29 missed field goals while shooting only 32 per
cent, keeping the Cardinal in the game.
Stanford did not need any more incentive to get
things turned around. After falling behind in dou
ble figures for the first time since its last loss, to
Tennessee, the Cardinal closed the first half with
an 18-6 run of its own, taking a 34-33 lead and a
good deal more confidence into the locker room.
"We got a good spurt, running back-door
layups and playing an aggressive game to pick up
the pace," VanDerveer said.
Perhaps no one embodied the sudden improve
ment in the Cardinal's play more than freshman
forward Kate Starbird, who tossed in a layup and
a driving five-foot bank shot among her six points
near the end of the frame. Starbird led the team
with 10 first-half points and would end up with a
game-high 19, the second-best output of her
young Stanford career.
"When they started playing pressure defense
and allowing us to fast-break, it played right into
my style," said Starbird, alluding to the Broncos'
tactic that also allowed the Tacoma,
Wash., native to add a game-high five
assists, many of them in transition.
Yet Starbird was not the only one
who soared for the Cardinal last
night. As usual, Stanford enjoyed a
balanced attack in methodically salt
ing the game away in the final 20
minutes. The Cardinal never sur
rendered the lead after intermission
and never let its advantage shrink
below five in the final 10 minutes.
Five Cardinal players finished in
double figures, including junior for
ward Rachel Hemmer, the team's
second-leading scorer on the season.
Limited to 10 minutes in the first
half because of two early fouls, Hem
mer had scored only two points by
the break. Yet she never left the
court after halftime, scoring 11 of
her 13 points and gathering eight of
her 12 rebounds in an impressive 20
minutes of action.
"In the second half, we didn't
stand with the ball over our heads
like we did in the first half," Hem
mer said. "We took pull-up jumpers,

and when they came out to stop
those, we went inside and got layups
on the rebounds."
Junior center Anita Kaplan, the
team's leading scorer on the season,
also recorded a double-double,
putting up 14 points and capturing
10 caroms. Senior guard Christy
Hedgpeth also contributed 14
points, including two three-pointers,
in possibly her best all-around out
ing of the season.
As expected, senior forward
Christine Silvernail led the charge
for the Broncos, netting 17 points
and a game-high 13 rebounds for her
side. Junior guard Jenny Baldwin
also pitched in 17 for Santa Clara.
But despite its early jitters, the
night still belonged to the Cardinal,
who must now face the always
tough Washington Huskies Thurs
day in Seattle in both squads' Pacif
ic 10 Conference openers. Yet Van-
Derveer sees a lot of similarity
between the Broncos and the
Huskies and hopes this tuneup
helped her squad.
"We learned a lot tonight about
how to play against pressure
defense, and that's the best thing to
know when you're facing Washing
ton," VanDerveer said.
