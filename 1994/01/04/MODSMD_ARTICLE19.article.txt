# Happy New Year from the annual Weiser Lock Copper Bowl

Sponsor me. Please.
If bowl games are any indication, the
U.S. economy is certainly healthy. Corpo
rate America had its names and products
plastered over the college football post
season in a mutual lovefest between big
business and event organizers.
Of the major bowls, only the Rose
Bowl was spared.
Cars, computers and food products
were attached to the games, so much so
that it was easy to forget who was playing
or for that matter, that a football game
was actually involved.
On Dec. 30, the Thrifty Car Rental
Holiday Bowl took place in San Diego.
Rumor has it that some employees of the
rental car company got confused and took
the day off.
Also on that day, the John Hancock
Bowl was held in El Paso, Texas This
game was formally known as the Sun
Bowl, before becoming the John Hancock
Sun Bowl a few years ago. Now it's just
the John Hancock Bowl. The next step
will be for the "Bowl" part of the title to

be dropped, so that two marginally suc
cessful football teams can travel to Texas
each year at the end of December to pay
tribute to their insurance company.
New Year's Eve was distinguished by
two outstanding advertisements. One
was the Poulan / Weed Eater Indepen
dence Bowl, where, doubtless, the city of
Shreveport, La., needed a garden-tools
company to put it on the map. The other
was the Outback Steakhouse Gator Howl
in Jacksonville, Fla., whose long title
caused the TBS announcers to say the
score with less and less frequency.
And then there was New Year's Day.
After the amazingly simple non-commer
cialized Hall of Fame Bowl kicked things
off, then the heavies set in. The Com
pUSA Florida Citrus. The Mobil Cotton.
The Federal Express Orange. The
USF&G Insurance Sugar. The IBM OS/2
Fiesta.
I have to admit, that last one confused
me. Was the OS/1 Fiesta played earlier in
the week 7
Bv far, the marketing coup of the day

occurred in Joe Robbie Stadium in
Miami, where a year ago to the day Stan
ford defeated Penn State in the third edi
tion of the Blockbuster Bowl. But the
Blockbuster was not played this year.
Instead, it was replaced with ... the Car
quest Bowl.

Ah, Carquest. Named after the famous
television show. Oh sorry, that's
"Sea Quest."
But then I realized the answer. Carquest,
named alter the practice local natives have
of hunting down tourists in their rental
cars! Suddenly, it all made sense.

The Blockbuster Bowl had the advan
tage of claiming to those non-movie-rent
mg persons that it was indeed an impor
tant college football game. Indeed, the
matchup would be a blockbuster, they
would say.
For Boston College and the University
of Virginia, however, that experience was
denied. Their efforts were channeled in
the name of a product unbeknownst to
anyone.
This commercialism has extended
beyond the game titles as some new sta
diums could be mistaken for airline ter
minals. Recently, the Capital Centre in
Landover, Md. — home of the NBA's
Washington Bullets, NHL's Capitals, and
Georgetown University basketball— was
renamed the USAir Arena. The NBA's
Phoenix Suns now play in the America
West Arena. And the Chicago Bulls will
play next season at the United Center.
Many a Bull fan will be disappointed
when they enter a taxi to go to the game,
only to wind up at O'Hare.
To some extent, the stadium sponsor

ship is justifiable because those arenas
are for professional teams. The question
that remains, however, is where the part
nership between corporate America and
college athletics is going to stop.
The real winner of the national cham
pionship was not Florida State, but Fed
eral Express, whose logo was plastered at
the 50-yard-line Saturday night.
Announcers for the bowl games were
forced to state the title sponsors repeat
edly throughout the contests. Next, the
announcers will be representatives
from the companies themselves. The
companies could even go so far as spon
soring the competing schools. All the
while, college athletes still are not get
ting paid.
The Hewlett Packard Stanford Cardi
nal. It could happen.
If only Thrifty Car Rental would spon
sor some school holidays.
