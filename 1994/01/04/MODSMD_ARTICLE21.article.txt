Synchronicity. The men's and women's
basketball teams have similar records, bal
anced performances and are similarly
earning the respect of their fans and foes
alike. Yet synchronicity like this can only
be achieved by performances that, in their
own small way, disrupt the equilibrium by
rising above the norm.
Two such performances were handed in

over the break by Kate Starbird and David
Harbour. The freshman forward and
junior guard turned in stellar perfor
mances in their respective teams' most
striking victories in the still-early season.
For the men's basketball team, the
year's most important victory to date came
Dec. 22 against the Virginia Cavaliers, a
squad ranked among top 25 in many pre
season polls. Against the Cavaliers, ster
ling guards Brevin Knight and Dion Cross
played in their usual sparkling manner,
yet it was Harbour, a reserve, who put the
musket to the Cavaliers with his career
high 15 points, which included an 11-for
-15 showing from the free-throw line.
For Harbour, the victory over the Cava
liers capped a comeback from thumb
replacement surgery, which caused the
guard to miss all of last season.

However, Starbird has also had difficul
ties with injuries; before the season began,
her playing status was uncertain due to a
cracked right kneecap. Yet Starbird was
cleared to play and has shone so far this
season for the Cardinal.
Starbird's most impressive performance
came on Dec. 28, when the Cardinal met
No. 4 Connecticut. The Huskies, many
said, would be a difficult test for the Car
dinal to pass. Yet, after the game ended
with a 94-75 Stanford victory, it was

apparent that the Cardinal squad had
scored straight A's for the night.
In this victory, Starbird was a large part
of the team's success, leading the team
with 20 points. Yet the performance was
totally in synch with Starbird's high
school record, which includes the all-time
Washington state record for points scored
(2,753) by a girl or boy.
