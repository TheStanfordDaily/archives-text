## 
### Cindy Yu Staff writer 
After a five-week formal search, the Cowell
Sexual Assault Information Resource Center
has named senior Angelina Cheney to the out
reach educator post vacated by Caroline
Mitchell last quarter.
Cheney, who begins her new job today, will
stop out to take over the full-time position left
by Mitchell.
"I'm definitely very excited," she said. "I'm
hoping to figure things out as fast as I can and
orient myself, which is my main focus now."
According to Cowell Health Promotion Pro
gram Director Carole Pertofsky, Cheney assist
ed Mitchell with self-defense classes for the

past year and a half and has been under
Mitchell's direction for at least that amount of
time.
"We're pleased to have her on board,"
Pertofsky said.
Cheney has also volunteered at a sexual as
sault resource center in Oregon. She said she
tries to continue her work wherever she goes.
"(Sexual assault) is something that isn't re
ally out in the open, and people don't talk about
it a lot. People are obviously aware of it, but
they need to be able to talk about it," she said.
"It's a part of life for a lot of people."
The search committee, chaired by Mitchell,
chose Cheney after a formal search process
that began with a pool of approximately 40 ap
plicants.

"We were looking for somebody who had
strong knowledge of sexual assault issues, who
could create new linkages with diverse groups
. . . and effectively work with existing groups in
terms of supporting [the student coalition 1,"
Pertofsky said.
The focus of the outreach educator needs to
be "working with the existing coalition and
doing outreach to the community," Pertofsky
said.
The outreach educator's current responsi
bilities include organizing educational pro
grams for the community and managing the
Sexual Assault Information Resource Center.
Hecause the position is funded bv an ASSU
special-fee request which students
must approve yearly, Pertofsky
said she believes it is especially
important that the outreach edu
cator maintain direct contact with
student groups to ensure that
"the work will go on" even if the
position itself is terminated.
The search committee that
picked Cheney consisted of eight
or nine students involved in the
campus sexual assault coalition
and staff from Cowell and the
Office of Student Affairs.
The committee also plans to
fill the vacancy left hy Fran Gib
son, director of the Sexual
Assault Information Resource
Center, by the end of this month.
