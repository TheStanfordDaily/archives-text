## No new revelations; out-of-court settlement expected in two weeks

The California attorney gener
al has concluded a two-year inves
tigation of the Stanford Book
store's compensation and invest
ment practices and is expected to
reach a settlement with the store
in the next two weeks.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg,
the spokesperson for the Book
store's board of directors, said the
two parties have reached "an
agreement in principle to settle
the litigation without further liti
gation" â€” meaning that the state
and the Bookstore will eventually
arrive at an out-of-court settle
ment.
"It appears that no legal claims
will be filed against the Bookstore
itself," Weisberg said. "Certain
details need to be worked out,

(but) the Bookstore board thinks
this is a very satisfactory resolu
tion."
State investigators began their
scrutiny of the Bookstore in Feb
ruary 1992, shortly after The
Daily reported that the store was
furnishing employees with perks
unheard of at other college book
stores, including luxury cars and
a vacation home.
"The [audit] itself is com
plete," said Deputy Attorney Gen
eral Jim Schwartz, "and we are
finishing up negotiations on how
to deal with it."
While Schwartz declined to
comment on the findings of the
investigation, Weisberg said the
attorney general's inquiry has
not unearthed any further revela
tions other than those addressed
