# State concludes investigation of Bookstore perks
## No new revelations; out-of-court settlement expected in two weeks 
### Komesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
The California attorney gener
al has concluded a two-year inves
tigation of the Stanford Book
store's compensation and invest
ment practices and is expected to
reach a settlement with the store
in the next two weeks.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg,
the spokesperson for the Book
store's board of directors, said the
two parties have reached "an
agreement in principle to settle
the litigation without further liti
gation" — meaning that the state
and the Bookstore will eventually
arrive at an out-of-court settle
ment.
"It appears that no legal claims
will be filed against the Bookstore
itself," Weisberg said. "Certain
details need to be worked out,

(but) the Bookstore board thinks
this is a very satisfactory resolu
tion."
State investigators began their
scrutiny of the Bookstore in Feb
ruary 1992, shortly after The
Daily reported that the store was
furnishing employees with perks
unheard of at other college book
stores, including luxury cars and
a vacation home.
"The [audit] itself is com
plete," said Deputy Attorney Gen
eral Jim Schwartz, "and we are
finishing up negotiations on how
to deal with it."
While Schwartz declined to
comment on the findings of the
investigation, Weisberg said the
attorney general's inquiry has
not unearthed any further revela
tions other than those addressed
in The Daily's report and the
Bookstore's subsequent internal
investigation.
"[The state's] two years of
investigation have not made the
picture look horrendously worse,"
he said.
Perhaps most stinging of the
revelations two years ago was
that the Bookstore spent about
$200,000 to lease a lavish vaca
tion home in the Sierras from a
consulting firm owned by the
store's two top managers, Eldon
Speed and Philip Chiaramonte.
The store also spent $70,000 to
furnish the home.
Further investigation disclosed
that the Bookstore had lost near
ly $2 million in "rather specula
tive" stock market investments in
1991.
State tax laws restrict the

investments and benefits to
employees that non-profit organi
zations like the Bookstore can
pursue.
Weisberg said the expected
benignity of the settlement with

the state is due
largely to the
Bookstore's
recognition of
past mistakes
and efforts to
correct them.
"One reason
the state was
moved to settle
ment was that

the Bookstore has acknowledged
and rectified a lot of the things
that were obviously wrong," he
said. Weisberg pointed out that
since The Daily's report was pub
lished, the Bookstore has sold all
its company cars and the vacation
home, and its board of directors
has taken on a more active role in
overseeing the store's financial
activities.

The Bookstore's relationship
with the state during the audit
"has not been all that adversari
al," Weisberg added. "Certainly
the board was not fighting the
attorney general at all."
Weisberg said the Book
store's desire to settle its differ
ences with the attorney general
out of court was further spurred
by its spiraling legal fees. Last
February, he said that the
Bookstore's legal and account
ing costs were approaching
$900,000.
"We didn't have a choice,
because of the very stern position
of the attorney general," he said.
The state's persistence is reflect
ed in Schwartz's demand that
the details "on the fringe" of the
current negotiations be fully
resolved before reaching a settle
ment.
"[Schwartz] doesn't want to
close the books on things, because
once they're closed, they can't be
reopened," Weisberg said.
