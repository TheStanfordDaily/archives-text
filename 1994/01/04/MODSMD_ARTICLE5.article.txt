# Voucher initiative delayed until 1996
## Decision upsets political science professor who authored proposal 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
School choice advocates will
skip this year's election and wait
until 1996 to push a new state
voucher initiative, in spite of ob
jections from a Stanford professor
who authored one proposal.
Four different voucher propos
als — including one written by Po
litical Science Prof. Terry Moe —
have been submitted to the Cali
fornia attorney general's office for
processing.
But a group of more than 30
voucher proponents has decided
to postpone the next vote on
vouchers until March 1996 in the
wake of the landslide defeat of
Proposition 174 — last Novem
ber's initiative that would have

provided private
school vouchers
to California
families.
Moe, however,
says he feels the
delay is unneces
sary, adding that
he feels it is im
portant to come
back with a

stronger plan in '94 after Prop.
174 received just 30 percent of the
vote.
"We knew it was going to be a
struggle, but... I thought that we
could do it and should do it,"he
said. "I think we would definitely
have gotten more than 30 percent
of the vote."


Moe
Even if his plan did not pass
this year, Moe said, it could have
garnered more votes than Prop.
174 and established momentum
for school choice before the 1996
election. But he realizes that a
majority of voucher supporters
felt there would not be enough
time to organize for 1994.
Their inability to rally around
one proposal of the four was
another factor in delaying the
vote until '96, according to
voucher advocates.
Other factors, such as the
more than 600,000 signatures
required to get a proposal on the
fall ballot and the millions of dol
lars which would have to be
raised, also prompted the deci
sion to delay the election.
"What we needed was support
from those who had been sup
portive in the past, [and] most of
the people who are involved in
[the voucher movement believe]

it makes more sense to wait until
'96," said Moe, who is also a
senior fellow at the Hoover Insti
tution.
He also s*ud that a '94 vote
made sense because it would have
forced the California Teachers'
Association, the largest financial
opponent of school vouchers, to
split its resources among many
races.
The school choice proposal
drafted by Moe and six others is
designed to appeal both to tradi
tional voucher supporters and
also to reach out to other groups.
"I think there will be an effort
to get feedback from various
social groups ... to see what they
want," Moe said.
Among the initiative's fea
tures aimed at gaining a broader
base of support are an increase in
the value of the voucher for low
income and disabled children —
from $2,600 under Prop. 174 to
$4,000 — and a provision that
would require the state's private
schools to set aside at least 15
percent of their enrollment for
low-income students.
