# Voucher initiative delayed until 1996
## Decision upsets political science professor who authored proposal 
### Kevin Wack Staff writer 
School choice advocates will
skip this year's election and wait
until 1996 to push a new state
voucher initiative, in spite of ob
jections from a Stanford professor
who authored one proposal.
Four different voucher propos
als — including one written by Po
litical Science Prof. Terry Moe —
have been submitted to the Cali
fornia attorney general's office for
processing.
But a group of more than 30
voucher proponents has decided
to postpone the next vote on
vouchers until March 1996 in the
wake of the landslide defeat of
Proposition 174 — last Novem
ber's initiative that would have

provided private
school vouchers
to California
families.
Moe, however,
says he feels the
delay is unneces
sary, adding that
he feels it is im
portant to come
back with a

stronger plan in '94 after Prop.
174 received just 30 percent of the
vote.
"We knew it was going to be a
struggle, but... I thought that we
could do it and should do it,"he
said. "I think we would definitely
have gotten more than 30 percent
of the vote."
