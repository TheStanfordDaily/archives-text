In order to better meet student
needs, the Stanford summer ses
sion will offer some new classes
this summer, as well as continue
to offer the perennially popular
programs.
Additions to the summer ses
sion include a new Chinese im
mersion program, several concen
trated pre-medical courses and
classes that fulfill the writing re

In the Chinese immersion pro

has been added to help students
fulfill the requirements for med
ical schools. It will cover Physics
21 through 26, permitting stu

physics in one quarter.
The summer quarter will also
continue to offer an intensive
chemistry program that allows
students to finish up to the equiv
alent of Chemistry 36. This pro
gram includes two-thirds of most
medical schools' requirements in
organic chemistry.
These programs, although ful
filling many Stanford require
ments, are not only intended for
Stanford full-time students.
In fact, Lisac said that the sum
