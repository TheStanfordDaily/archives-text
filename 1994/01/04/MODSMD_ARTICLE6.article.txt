## Summer school class offerings increased 
### Charles Katz Staff writer 
In order to better meet student
needs, the Stanford summer ses
sion will offer some new classes
this summer, as well as continue
to offer the perennially popular
programs.
Additions to the summer ses
sion include a new Chinese im
mersion program, several concen
trated pre-medical courses and
classes that fulfill the writing re
quirement.
In the Chinese immersion pro
gram, students will study Chinese
at Stanford for four weeks and
then travel to the University of
Peking in Beijing for the last five
weeks of class.
"I By offering this program | we
are trying to respond to student
needs that called for a complete
immersion program," said An
drew Lisac, the assistant dean of
summer session.
The session will also include
other new programs that will
allow students to fulfill require
ments for Stanford and for med
ical schools. A new expository
writing class will be offered that

will enable students to fulfill the
freshman writing requirement.
Lisac said the program is also
geared toward students who may
have completed their require
ments, but just want more writing
experience.
In addition, a physics program
has been added to help students
fulfill the requirements for med
ical schools. It will cover Physics
21 through 26, permitting stu
dents to finish a year's worth of
physics in one quarter.
The summer quarter will also
continue to offer an intensive
chemistry program that allows
students to finish up to the equiv
alent of Chemistry 36. This pro
gram includes two-thirds of most
medical schools' requirements in
organic chemistry.
These programs, although ful
filling many Stanford require
ments, are not only intended for
Stanford full-time students.
In fact, Lisac said that the sum
mer session is not trying to recruit
primarily Stanford students for
the summer. "We are trying to at
tract students who don't go to
Stanford. These students may
not have been able to attend
Stanford, but still would like to
have some course work from
Stanford."
The summer session also will
continue to offer hands-on pro
grams that allow students to take
classes that they may not have
time for during the regular school
year. Such programs include the
Hopkins Marine Station program
in Monterey, California that
grants students the opportunity
to learn scuba diving and then
conduct research in dives, said
Lisac. The Mid-Summer at Stan
ford program, now in its second

year brings in high-caliber actors
to teach the courses. Last year's
teachers included Richard Drey
fuss and Ed Asner.
Although the new programs
will allow students a greater
selection of classes, Lisac said it
does not reflect any significant
changes.
"We're just doing what we've
always been doing. The quarter
system was introduced in 1916 at
Stanford in order to let students
graduate quicker, but that is no
longer our intent. The quarter
allows Stanford students a place
where they can complete require
ments and take classes they did
not have an opportunity to take
during the year. It also provides
an opportunity for non-Stanford
students to take Stanford cours
es."
