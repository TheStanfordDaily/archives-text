# Nothing spooky about Stanford witches

### Chris Broekhoff Staff writer 
In the foothills under the light of a full moon,
the sacred circle is drawn, the candles lit, the four
elements invoked and the goddess and god invit
ed — so begins the monthly ritual of four witches
at Stanford.
Though it may sound like a scenario from the
latest Stephen King novel, these Stanford stu
dents, who call themselves the Moon Circle, are
part of a growing religion that has taken root in
the Bay Area.
A far cry from the stereotypical witch with
broom in hand waiting to terrorize small children
on Halloween, these modern witches have no evil
intent, said senior Billie Mandel.
These days, witchcraft — synonymous with
Wicca, or paganism — is equated with feminine
spirituality, she said.
" 'Witch' comes from 'Wicca,' which means
'wise woman,' or 'to shape or bend,'" Mandel
said.
"Spells are a symbolic way of focusingyour en
ergy on something in your life that you want to
change," said sophomore Nicole Walden. "We
don't stir cauldrons or cast spells on people," she
added.
Based on personal responsibility, Wicca has
two major tenets: a witch can do whatever her
heart wishes, as long as she doesn't hurt any
thing, and whatever she does will come back to
her threefold.
Since modern Wicca is a revival of an old Eu
ropean nature-based religion any formal doc-

trine or rules — beyond the two
major ones — have been lost,
making it a very flexible and per
sonal religion, Mandel said.
"The purpose of the rituals are
different for each person," said
senior Adrienne Rain. "They can
be a time of communing with the
earth, of introspection and of
sharing what's happened in the
last moon."
For Mandel, Wicca has shown
her the importance of balance in
her life. "Wicca has given me a
congruence of purpose in all
aspects of my life," Mandel said.
"With its emphasis on personal
responsibility and honesty, I've
learned the connection between
faith and politics."
This notion of balance is an
important aspect of modern
Wicca, she said. It is symbolized
in the Wiccan pentacle: a star
inside a circle representing har
mony.
The Wiccan idea of balance
also appealed to Rain, who like

most witches believes that femi
nine and masculine forces are
found within each person.
"When the god and goddess are
summoned in ritual they repre
sent these forces within each per
son," Rain said, "rather than
external forces that oversee all.
Mandel said she finds it
empowering to think that people
possess the god and goddess
within themselves, which can
inspire in them a feeling that
they can change the world
around them.
However, many people still
misconstrue witchcraft as some
thing evil, she said. The idea that
witchcraft is related to Satanism
is completely false, she added, as
is the idea that the pentacle is a
Satanic symbol.
"Satanists worship chaos, by
inverting the symbols of other
religions, such as a cross or a pen
tacle," she said. "Therefore the
pentacle that people associate
with Satanism is actually the
inverted Wiccan symbol of bal
ance."
"It's sad that people think we
are doing harm and are to he
feared when Wicca is gentle, posi

tive and accepting," Rain agreed.
These are the aspects that
attracted Walden to the religion.
"The Wiccan religion doesn't
invalidate or judge other reli
gions," she said. "Wiccan mission
aries don't exist, and Wicca
doesn't claim to be the only 'right'
religion."
Because Wicca is self-empow
ering for women, "many women
are attracted to Wicca because of
the political climate," Mandel
said.
The Bay Area in particular is
home to a large number of witch
es, with some gatherings drawing
as many as 400 people.
"California (provides) a benev
olent atmosphere to practice
witchcraft," said Mandel.
Due to the large Wiccan follow
ing in the Bay Area, being Wiccan
here almost feels like being a part
of a movement, she said.
Above all, Mandel appreciates
that the peace-loving and accept
ing religion has left her plenty of
room to maintain her sense of
humor; she displays her faith on
her car with two bumper stickers
— "Goddess Bless" and "My
other car is a broom."
