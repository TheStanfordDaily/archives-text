Russian jet crash kills 120
MOSCOW (AF) — A Russian passen
ger jet crashed into a snowy field on a
Siberian farm and blew up yesterday
after an engine caught fire. The crash
killed all 120 people aboard, including 17
foreigners.
The crash was the second in eight
days in the former Soviet Union, high
lighting concerns about the safety of the
state-run Aeroflot airline and scores of
smaller, spinoff companies. The Tu-154
jet that crashed yesterday belonged to
Baikal Air, one of many new regional
carriers.
The plane had just taken off from
Irkutsk, near the southern shores of
Lake Baikal, on a flight to Moscow, 2,500
miles to the west, when one of its three
engines failed.
After 12 minutes in the air, the plane
crashed and exploded on a livestock farm
near the village of Mamona, 7 miles out
side Irkutsk, a city.of 650,000 people.
A Russian news agency later reported
that the plane's hydraulic system had
failed just before the engine caught on

fire, but it was not clear if the two prob
lems were linked.
Mexico uprising continues
SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS,
Mexico (AP> — Indian rebels held onto
three towns and battled soldiers in a
fourth yesterday. The army appeared to
be avoiding an all-out offensive on the
conflict's third day.
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's
administration appealed for a truce in
the country's first guerrilla unrest in two
decades. The rebels, who are demanding
better treatment from the government,
did not respond.
At least 65 soldiers, rebels, police and
civilians have been killed since an esti
mated 1,000 rebels from the Zapatista
Army of National Liberation attacked
towns and villages in Chiapas, Mexico's
southernmost state, before dawn Satur
day.
The U.S. Embassy dispatched five
representatives to the state yesterday to
help Americans find safety or a way out if
they chose.
