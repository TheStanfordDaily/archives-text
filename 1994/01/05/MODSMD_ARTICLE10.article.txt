# Clinton to unveil NATO proposal
## Administration resists pressure to admit East European countries 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Moving too
quickly to bring East European countries
into NATO could destabilize the region
and "become a self-fulfilling prophesy of
pessimism about Russia," President Clin
ton's national security adviser declared
yesterday.
Anthony Lake's comments came as
the administration resisted pressure
from new East European allies who want
the United States to speed up plans to
offer NATO membership to former War
saw Pact countries.
Clinton, who will attend a NATO sum
mit and then travel to Eastern Europe
next week, said at the White House that
the United States is "trying to promote
security and stability in Europe. We don't
want to do anything that increases ten
sions."
The president said he thought some

East European nations were misunder
standing his position. "That's why I'm
going to Prague to see them," he said,
adding that "we're going to work hard to
try to make everybody feel good about
this approach."
Such dividing lines could strengthen
the hands of the nationalists in Russia
and "destabilize states to the East," sug
gested "It could become a self-ful
filling prophesy of pessimism about Rus
sia and this would not be in the interests
either of NATO or indeed of the states of
Central and Eastern Europe."
The White House conceded there is
"some debate about the details" of what
the administration is calling a Partner
ship for Peace. It would offer East Euro
pean countries military cooperation with
NATO but envision full membership as
years away.

Clinton will outline that proposal next
week at a NATO summit at which the
principal topic will l)e the pleas for admis
sion to the Western alliance.
Even before the surprisingly strong
showing by Russian nationalists in last
month's parliamentary elections, U.S.
officials were sensitive to Moscow's con
cerns about NATO offering membership
to former Warsaw Pact nations such as
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
Too sensitive, according to Polish
President Lech Walesa who called
NATO's go-slow approach "shortsighted
and irresponsible."
In an interview with The Washington
Post, Walesa said Poland has no choice
but to accept whatever the West offers.
"But we don't forecast anything good for
this concept," he said of Partnership for
Peace.
