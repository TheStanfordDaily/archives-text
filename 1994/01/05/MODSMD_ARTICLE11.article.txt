TIME EFFECTS change. And
as change occurs, policies
must be adapted.
In accordance with this principle,
Stanford's Board of Trustees decid
ed recently to lift its ban on buying
stock in four companies that do
business in South Africa. This laud
able move recognizes the improving
state of black-white relations within
South Africa.
Stanford's announcement is part
of a nationwide trend among col
leges. Other schools have also
rescinded their divestment policies
following Nelson Mandela's call for
an end to all economic sanctions.
Time has brought about the long
awaited death of apartheid in South
Africa. Although the transition to a
democratic state has witnessed
some bloodshed and resistance, the
promise of free elections this year
appears to be the final step in the
dismantling of apartheid. As a corol
lary, companies that conduct busi
ness in South Africa no longer need
to be penalized economically.

When blacks in South Africa were
under the oppression of apartheid,
Stanford and other institutions
were correct in divesting from com
panies which were indirectly helping
South Africa continue its racist poli
cies. Hopefully, now that the nation
is pursuing a democratic course,
investment such as Stanford's will
encourage economic growth.
However, the advisory panel rec
ommended lifting the ban only for
those companies that get passing
ratings under the Statement of
Principles program or under State
Department guidelines. Companies
that continue to sell equipment to
the South African Defense Forces,
such as Ingersoll Rand, will contin
ue to be on the banned list, at least
until free elections are held.
Stanford's decision to continue
its divestment policy in these cases
is also shrewd, and suggests that the
University will ensure that South
Africa lives up to the promises
which it has made both to its citi
zens and the world.
