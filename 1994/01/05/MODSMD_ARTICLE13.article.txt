# Summery program
## 
### 
SUMMER. Images of reading a
trashy novel, touring some
exotic country or slogging at a
low-paying job come to mind.
But for some students, reading a
300-page course reader, touring the
South Stacks and slogging in a lab
for weeks on end may be more real
istic.
Recognizing the ever-increasing
numbers of students needing to
focus upon academics from June to
September, Stanford's summer
session is expanding its course
offerings. In addition to its tradi
tional programs, this year's session
will include several concentrated
pre-medical courses, a Chinese
immersion program and more writ
ing classes.
The session isn't just for students
who want to catch up or retake
classes. Allowing students to finish
basic requirements for post-gradu
ate study lets them pursue more

advanced and diverse coursework
during the school year. With an
intensive summer program, doc
tors-to-be can major in fields such as
history or art. Pre-meds can also
focus more closely on courses which
can be especially difficult to balance
with a normal courseload, such as
the infamous organic chemistry.
And innovative courses, like the
Chinese language program, offer
students special academic opportu
nities that would be impossible to
pursue during the normal school
year.
Summer session directors should
be commended for paying attention
to student needs. Using the program
to enhance academic offerings, and
not just to provide remedial and
basic classes, is a sound move.
While students in summer ses
sion may not get great tans, they
might get something a lot more
worthwhile.
