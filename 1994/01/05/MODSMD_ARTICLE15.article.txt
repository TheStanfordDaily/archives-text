## Time: a passage of progress 
### 
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE that yet
another year has run its hurried
cycle, wheezing us ever closer to the
approaching millennium. Upon reflec
tion, what has passed during those four
seasons, during those months which
arrive with the inevitable frequency of
ocean waves; barely having caught your
balance before the next arrives to pull
you under? On New Year's Eve, the
whole world stands on the pinnacle of
time, poised between past and future.
Like the two-faced Greek god Janus, we
stare into opposite directions simulta
neously, in the space between the year
that is beginning, and that which has
ended. For "every passage implies two
states, one left behind and one being
approached," writes Octavio Paz. And
New Year's is a passage of sorts — a
passage of time that carries us cease
lessly forward in the guise of progress.

As the ball begins to descend, are
you filled with nostalgia for all that has
passed out of your present grasp, or
rather do you feel hope in the possibili
ties of the next year? Always a bit of
both, I think. So, it's a sort of gamble
that we make each December 31 as,
tipsy on champagne, we agree to con
tinue on with yet another one. If the
past year didn't fulfill its promise of
good tidings, the choice is hardly diffi
cult: the new year spreads out before us
with the purity of untracked snow.
Conversely, if the year has been good,

we take more of a risk when we wel
come in the New Year, for who knows
what sour changes time will turn?
Imagine if one could simply opt not to
move forward, to remain in a particular
year as it spins off into its own orbit,
playing itself over again into eternity.
There might be a certain comfort in
repetition; after all, one cannot know
what sadness or heartache lies in the
future. Still, we are a gambling lot, and
there would be few of us who would
choose to abort time and all its possibil
ities. Hope, after all, is intrinsic to liv
ing people.
A year. So small or great a time,
depending. At four, a year was a quar
ter of my life, a seemingly endless eter
nity. But now, having seen 19 of them
already, one more couldn't make too
much of a difference. I imagine that if
you live long enough, at some point a
year becomes as quick and inconse
quential as a breath. And so, what will
the next year bring? What poems will
write themselves, what will there be to
sigh about, whose tail lights will I
watch disappear into the night? Who
will call me in the dark hours, what
new telephone numbers will I know by
heart, whose will I forget? Who will
take the long way home, read aloud to
me? Will I sleep through the nights,
will there be enough time in the day?
There is not much that is mightier than
Time, and it is hard to predict just what

changes it will render as it passes;
sometimes with the grace of a passing
wind, others with the obstinacy of a
steamroller.

Resolutions. It is only January 5,
and already those heady oaths seem to
have progressed into the hazy recesses
of the mind. Upon asking a friend if he
was making any New Year's resolu
tions, he answered "No. I already have
enough hypocrisy in my life that I don't
need to add to it." Yet just as it is hard,
at the close of a year, not to look back
on all that has passed, it is equally as
difficult to look into the future without
a few ideas about what we hope mtght
happen. Harper, a character in the
highly acclaimed play "Angels in Amer
ica" whose sanity has been worn away
by time's heavy passage, says "In this
world, there is a kind of painful
progress. Longing for what we've left
behind and dreaming ahead."
1994. Saying it sounds as awkward
as calling oneself by a new name. But
like a name, time defines us, its linear
course the sum total of our years,
strung together in the everchanging
design of life: past, present, future.
