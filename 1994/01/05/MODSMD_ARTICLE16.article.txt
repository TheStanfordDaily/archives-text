## Campus ethnic centers must have adequate funds, staff 
### 
AS MEMBERS of Lambda Phi
Epsilon, we would like to voice
our concerns about the results of
foreseeable budget cuts on the Asian
American Activities Center.
As it stands now, the center is inad
equately funded and understaffed.
Even after recommendations were
made in the University Committee on
Minority Issues report in 1989 that
the center receive more basic operating
funds, more full-time staff and more
funding for student interns, no
increases were made even to this date.
To make further cuts to an already
frail budget would compromise the
validity and effectiveness of such an
ethnic center.
With the increasing numbers of
Asian-American students and other
students of color matriculating at Stan
ford in the last few years, the develop

ment of the activities center has
become an urgent priority. Although
the number of students of color has
increased, mutual understanding and
harmony among the various ethnic
groups has not. If this University is in
fact committed to multiculturalism, it
should follow through with its stated
goals. This not only means admitting a
more diverse class but also implies
being committed to meeting faculty
and student body needs which arise as
a result of this diversity. Failure to ful
fill the latter would be equivalent to
abandoning a newborn at birth.
In this spirit, the activities center
and other campus ethnic centers not
only cater to those that fit under the
ethnic category but they in fact
attempt to reach out to the entire uni
versity on issues of culture, race and
ethnicity. For example, the Asian

American Activities Center sponsors
the campus-wide Asian-Pacific Islander
Heritage Month, which has brought to
Stanford the likes of Rev. Jesse Jack
son, Dale Minami and B.D. Wong to
speak to diverse crowds in hopes of fos
tering an acceptance of cultural diver
sity on this campus. In light of its
scope, it is our hope that the activities
center be treated as if it were an indis
pensable arm of the University, and
thus receive appropriate and fair con
sideration in the University's decision
making process.
The members of Lambda Phi
Epsilon are committed to increasing
Asian awareness and providing services
in the best interests of our community
and University. Despite the fact that
our organization is not funded by the
Asian American Activities Center, we
believe that this center provides ser-

vices which are invaluable to the facul
ty, staff and students at Stanford. To
further cripple such a center with bud
get cuts or to fail to provide it with
adequate funding in ensuing years will
jeopardize the future of race relations
and student-administration relations
on this campus.
We are aware of the trials ahead of
the administration in reference to the
impending budget cuts. As a predomi
nantly Asian-American group we are
concerned about these issues, and as
Stanford students we are equally con
cerned about the future of this Univer
sity. Therefore, it is our hope that you
will consider these issues seriously, and
that ultimately we, both students and
administrators, can do what is best for
our University.
