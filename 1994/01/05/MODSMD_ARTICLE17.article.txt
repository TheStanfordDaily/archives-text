# Schindler, despite his flaws, heroically took risks to save workers
## 
### 
Oskar Schindler was not a "saint." In
fact, in Thomas Keneally's novel
"Schindler's List," upon which Steven
Spielberg's critically acclaimed movie is
based, Schindler is portrayed as a man
full of flaws — womanizing, gambling,
and excessive drinking to name a few.
When I spoke with a friend of mine who
also recently read this novel, he
expressed a valid concern that he hoped
the movie did not leave out these depic
tions of Schindler. Why? Nobody is per
fect, but everyone is capable of doing
some pretty miraculous things.
Schindler is the epitome of this state
ment.
Oskar Schindler was a real person,
not a creation of Steven Spielberg's spe
cial effects. Therefore, he was not per-

fect, but he also was not a perversion of
the word "hero."
N'Gai Croal's column in yesterday's
Daily worries me because I am afraid he
overlooked a heroic act done by Schindler
and refuted it due to other "less saint
like" behaviors. Schindler has been
described by many as a shady character.
Several Schindlerjuden, survivors of the
Holocaust saved by Schindler, were con
fused by what seemed like a split person
ality in Schindler. Nonetheless, over and
over again, these survivors have been
outspoken about the courage Schindler
demonstrated and the risks he took to
save their lives.
Oskar Schindler died a poor and
unsuccessful businessman. The "thirty
pieces of silver" that he collected a copi
ous amount of times during the war did
not add up to a fortune in his later life.
However, he was cared for by the
Schindlerjuden who even brought him to
Israel once a year. This man earned the
respect of 1,100 people as he proved to
them that there were individuals during

the Holocaust who were disgusted by the
concentration camps and the liquidations
of ghettos and had the strength to do
something about it.
I wish that Croal could have asked
one of these survivors if they felt
enslaved by Schindler or if they realized
how fortunate they were to be working
for him rather than being sent to
labor/concentration camps. As the book
implies, being on Schindler's List meant
living, and any chance to live during a
time of constant death meant the world
to these people. Schindler was the only
one who offered these Jews a chance.
I hope that afler people see the movie
or read the book, they realize that one
incredible part of the story is the change
that occurs in Schindler from a selfish,
money-hungry businessman to a man
who witnessed inhumane acts and felt
the need to stop them in one way that he
could.
Croal eloquently wrote that "Never is
happening again right now" in reference
to the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. Oskar

Schindler made a difference fifty years
ago, but he lived where the problem
occurred. As students thousands of miles
from current inhumane acts, we obvious
ly cannot emulate Oskar Schindler, but
there must be something we can do. I do
not have the answers, but I am constant
ly thinking about this dilemma because I
firmly believe in the words "never again."
