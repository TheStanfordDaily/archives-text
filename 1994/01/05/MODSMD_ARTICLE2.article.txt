Stanford's Center for Integrated Systems
will receive between $8 million and $9 million
from the National Science Foundation as its In
tegrated Circuits Laboratory joins a new na
tional network of universities in developing
better methods of designing microscopic de
vices.
Organized and funded by the National Sci
ence Foundation, the network will 9eek to
make nanotechnology available to other uni
versities nationwide.

The other four universities that will be part
of the network are Cornell University, Howard
University, Pennsylvania State University and
the University of California at Santa Barbara.
Stanford will join the new group on Feb. 1.
Nanostructures are devices that are mea
sured in nanometers, a billionth of a meter, be
cause of their small size. They have many dif
ferent applications presently, including sen
sors that will measure the quality of human
blood when connected to people and microscop
ic transistors that connect circuits.
Stanford and Cornell — the two largest uni
versities in the network — will receive 40 per

cent of the funds from the National Science
Foundation.
The Stanford laboratory will receive $3.55
million in the 1994 fiscal year to purchase new
equipment and cover operating costs.
Although the National Science Board, which
supports the National Science Foundation, has
approved $20 million for the project, the actual
amount to be allocated will depend on the suc
cess of the network.
The five universities submitted a joint pro
posal to the foundation in June emphasizing
