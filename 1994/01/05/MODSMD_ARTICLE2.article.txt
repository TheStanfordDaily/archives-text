# Lab joins NSF-funded research network

Stanford's Center for Integrated Systems
will receive between $8 million and $9 million
from the National Science Foundation as its In
tegrated Circuits Laboratory joins a new na
tional network of universities in developing
better methods of designing microscopic de
vices.
Organized and funded by the National Sci
ence Foundation, the network will 9eek to
make nanotechnology available to other uni
versities nationwide.

The other four universities that will be part
of the network are Cornell University, Howard
University, Pennsylvania State University and
the University of California at Santa Barbara.
Stanford will join the new group on Feb. 1.
Nanostructures are devices that are mea
sured in nanometers, a billionth of a meter, be
cause of their small size. They have many dif
ferent applications presently, including sen
sors that will measure the quality of human
blood when connected to people and microscop
ic transistors that connect circuits.
Stanford and Cornell — the two largest uni
versities in the network — will receive 40 per

cent of the funds from the National Science
Foundation.
The Stanford laboratory will receive $3.55
million in the 1994 fiscal year to purchase new
equipment and cover operating costs.
Although the National Science Board, which
supports the National Science Foundation, has
approved $20 million for the project, the actual
amount to be allocated will depend on the suc
cess of the network.
The five universities submitted a joint pro
posal to the foundation in June emphasizing
the use of computer simulation in
the development of nanotechnolo
gy-
The team entered the competi
tive grant process with new ideas
on how to allow individuals outside
of the five universities to use facili
ties. "The new ideas along with the
complimentary facilities of the uni
versities made the team stand
out," said Electrical Engineering
Prof James Plummer, who will be
the director of the nanofabrication
network at Stanford.

Each of the universities is
expected to contribute a unique
benefit to the network, Plummer
said. Cornell and Stanford cur
rently possess the largest and
most diverse laboratories for
nanostructures, and UC-Santa
Barbara has the most specialized
etching facility. Howard and
Penn State are able to handle
materials that most other labora
tories cannot.
According to Plummer, the
network eventually hopes to allow
scientists and students to test and
design nanostructures through
computer simulation, avoiding
the often costly initial testing
stages in the laboratory.

"The network is worthwhile
for Stanford because it is a cost
effective way to make machines
available for the designing of
nanostructures," said Plummer.
According to Simon Wong, who
will be the associate director of
the network at Stanford, the net
work also allows for collaboration
between the Stanford lab and
other labs and industries.
Although the Stanford labora
tory was originally built in the
1980s for electrical engineers who
wanted to build silicon chips, it
has already been used by student
and faculty in physics, chemistry,
engineering, biology and
medicine.
