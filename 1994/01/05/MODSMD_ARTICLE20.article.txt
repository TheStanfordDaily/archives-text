# Omnipresent 'dark matter' difficult to detect
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Copernicus revolutioniz.ed early
conceptions of the universe, show
ing the Earth is not at its center.
And if a research collaboration
among Stanford, UC-Berkeley
and UC-Santa Barbara goes as
planned, scientists will again rev
olutionize our outlook.
"We ourselves may not be made
up of the dominant matter in the
universe," said Physics Prof. Bias
Cabrera, who is working on the
research, which, if successful, will
mark the first detection of this
hidden mass — termed "dark mat
ter" by scientists.
This new matter would differ
from conventional "baryonic"
matter — protons and electrons,
among others — because it inter
acts minimally with other parti
cles, making it particularly diffi
cult to detect.
The existence of dark matter
would clear up a number of
observed discrepancies between
current theories of the universe's
structure and observational
data.

For example, according to our
current understanding of gravi
tation, in order for galaxies to
overcome centrifugal forces aris
ing from their rotation — forces
which would cause them to fly
apart — they must contain a cer
tain amount of mass.
However, studies of the densi
ty of matter in galaxies have
shown that there is simply not
enough mass to hold them
together — a discrepancy that is
solved with the addition of dark
matter.
The existence of dark matter
would also answer questions
about the fate of the universe.
According to the big-bang theory,
the universe is currently expand
ing, but it is also slowing down
due to the gravitational attrac
tion among the moving bodies.
Scientists have calculated the
amount of mass necessary to
force the universe to cease
expanding in the future. Present
calculations of the universe's
mass place it at only about 10
percent of that amount — anoth
er discrepancy that dark matter's
existence might resolve.

Scientists have already discov
ered one form of dark matter —
primarily composed of burned
out stars and small amounts of
condensed gases.

The existence of
dark matter would
clear up a number of
observed discrepan
cies between current
theories of the uni
verse's structure and
observational data.

These "MACHOs" (massive
compact halo objects), made up
of ordinary baryonic matter,
were discovered when scientists
observed fluctuations in stars'
intensity when the matter
eclipsed their light.
But Cabrera and his collabora
tors think that MACHOs cannot
make up for all of the unobserved

matter that must exist to deal with
the known physical discrepancies.
"It would he very surprising if
MACHOs made up the 90 per
cent gap," he said. "It would
change our current physical per
spective a great deal."
Cabrera's search for dark
matter involves the detection of
"WIMPs" (weakly interacting
massive particles) — the non
baryonic matter which he
believes surrounds our galaxy.
But because of the WIMPs'
weak interaction, the research
group is going to great lengths to
create an environment conducive
to their detection.
Because the solar system is
rotating around the galactic cen
ter, if these WIMPs exist, they
are continuously streaming
through the Earth and our bod
ies — unimpeded because they
interact so weakly with other
matter.
In order to detect these parti
cles, researchers must find a way
to detect very small vibrations
created when a piece of dark mat
ter collides with the nucleus of
an atom.
Their device employs a piece
of silicon, cooled to one-tenth of a
degree Kelvin above absolute
zero and placed between two
superconducting plates, to detect
these vibrations.
When a WIMP collides with a
silicon nucleus, it produces
vibrations in the silicon lattice,
which are detected by the super
conducting plates.
According to Cabrera, the
detector will be placed inside a
tunnel 35 feet below ground,
with a variety of shields around
it to protect the silicon from radi
ation and other particles that
might create similar vibrations
to those expected from the dark
matter.
The project, scheduled to
begin this summer, will be car
ried out over a period of years, in
order to measure changes in the
amounts of observed dark matter
when the Earth is moving with
and against the rotation of the
galaxy, changing its velocity with
respect to the relatively slow
moving WIMPs.
"We are very hopeful that
we'll see results when the experi
ment begins," Cabrera said.
"Ultimately, the intellectual
framework of this experiment
could bridge a number of classi
cally separate disciplines in
physics.*'
