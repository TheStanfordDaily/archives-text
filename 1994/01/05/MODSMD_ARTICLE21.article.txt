# Cartilage defies bone shrinkage
## Growing ears, noses embarrass both sexes 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
I 've noticed that a lot of old
V/ men seem to have large ears.
Just wondering if I might have
to consider ear reduction in my
later years ?

A: Believe it or not, loyal
readers, I have actually
received numerous versions of
this question over the past
month. Perhaps the desire to
understand this phenomenon is
another symptom of an appear
ance-obsessed culture. Perhaps
it reflects a subconscious fear of
the changes that accompany
the aging process that all of us
must someday face.
But never fear — whatever
motivates your interest in this
subject, you are about to be duly
edified.
We are all familiar with the
slowing and eventual halt of
bodily growth that accompanies
advancing age. Most of us are
finished expanding our skele
tons by the time we begin our
third decade of life. After anoth
er 20 years or so, the process
seems to start running in
reverse: As bones lose calcium
and bend under the strain of
years, most people shrink sever
al inches in height between the
time they turn 40 and the day
they leave this mortal coil.
This process of shrinkage is
especially pronounced in women.
For hormonal reasons that lie
beyond the scope of this humble
column, post menopausal women
lose bone calcium so rapidly that
their bones may develop micro
scopic holes and lose much of
their structural integrity. In
advanced cases, this condition is
known as osteoporosis.
But that's bone. And bone
isn't what we're talking about.
The externally visible parts of
the ears (the "pinnae") are com
posed not of bone, but of a softer
material, cartilage. Cartilage is a
precursor of bone in fetal devel
opment. but in the nose and ears
is never replaced by the harder,

more mature substance.
Not only does cartilage not
suffer the same ravages of old
age as bone does, it actually con
tinues to grow throughout life —
most rapidly in the first two
decades, but never really settling
down the way bone does.
Hence, our ears (and noses
and chins) gradually grow larger
as we age. This is quite apparent
in a comparison between A 1 Paci
no's small, almost delicate nose
of youth (as seen in "The Godfa
ther") and the longer, more regal
honker he sports in "Carlito's
Way."
This phenomenon is not lim
ited to men, however. Women's
noses and ears also grow
throughout life, eventually
resulting in the hooked nose and
chin of the archetypal witch.
I can almost hear all the Gen
eration X-ers out there whining,
"Forget the science — is there
anything I can do to preserve the
delicacy of my precious visage, or
am I doomed to become a
hunched-over old crone, barely
able to support the weight of my
own ears and becoming progres
sively less able to consume solid
food as my nose and chin
encroach over my mouth's
airspace 7 "
In a word, yes, but not per
manently. Cosmetic surgery can
cut back unwanted growth of
facial features, but unlike proce
dures involving bone (like the
shaving of the nasal bndge), the
results of such operations are
eventually reversed by the
inevitable onslaughts of time.
