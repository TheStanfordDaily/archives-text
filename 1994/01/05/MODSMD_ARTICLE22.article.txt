## Wrestling with poetry, pottery and aggressiveness Chapman has posted an impressive freshman record and foresees an even brighter future 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
Scott Chapman has come a long way from his
early days of playground rough-housing, picking
fights and making trouble in classrooms.

Since fourth grade, the freshman from Lake
Arrowhead, Calif, has channeled his aggression
more appropriately by mastering takedowns and
pins on the wrestling mats.
"It's just my nature to be aggressive," Chapman
said. "I like the feeling of hitting someone and see

ing them on the ground."
Chapman (and his aggression) has quickly estab
lished himself in the Cardinal wrestling program.
The 158-pounder has started for the Cardinal in
each of its four dual meets and wrestled at the pres
tigious Las Vegas Invitational in December and the
Oregon Classic last week. Currently, he has a
match record of 4-6.
The freshman has discovered that both the com
petition and the demands of collegiate wrestling
are much different than at the high school level.
"In college, guys don't give up. They are constant
ly at you, waiting for you to break mentally. In
high school, the competition gives up after a
while."
Stanford wrestling coach Chris Horpel attests to
the initial difficulty of the transition to college for
high-school standouts. According to Horpel, two
years of college wrestling experience can develop
athletic skills comparable to those of high-school
state champions.
"Scott is going through the usual transition,"
Horpel said. "He's definitely taking his licks . . . but
he wants to work hard. He believes in himself
strongly, he's thick-skinned, and he's learning a lot
right now."
Horpel believes that such an attitude will take
Chapman far in the collegiate wrestling circuit. He
estimates that the freshman can qualify for nation
als this year and has a chance of becoming an All-
American (placing in the top eight at NCAAs).
"By the time he's a senior, Scott has a legitimate
shot at winning the NCAAs," Horpel said.
Right now, however, Chapman is more con
cerned with the present. He wants to improve his
conditioning and continue to prove himself as one
of Stanford's top wrestlers.
"I'm still trying to find where I'm at in the col
lege spectrum," said Chapman. "It takes a lot of
time."
For Chapman, sports were natural manifesta
tions of his explosive personality. Chapman tried
practically every sport, but after junior high he
decided to focus on football and wrestling. "Base
ball didn't give me that 'rush'," Chapman said,
"and soccer was too frustrating ... I was always
getting yellow-carded."
Chapman excelled in athletics at Rim of the
World High School. Although he won all-league
linebacker honors while on the football team, he
felt more drawn to wrestling because of its higher
individual demands.
"On a bad day in football, others can make up for
your mistakes," Chapman explained. "With
wrestling, it's just you . . . you have to be self-driv
en. You make your own mistakes."

Chapman found enormous success as a high
school wrestler, winning the California state title
three times. During his senior year, he clinched
the 152-pound national title in Pittsburgh. With
only 20 seconds left in overtime, he scored a take
down against Case Hooper of Indiana to become
champion.

It's just my nature to be aggres
sive. I like the feeling of hitting
someone and seeing them on
the ground.'
— Scott Chapman

Winning nationals neatly capped his high-school
achievements and opened up wrestling opportuni
ties at athletically prestigious schools such as
Northwestern, Arizona State and Purdue. Chap
man decided on Stanford for reasons he still cannot
pinpoint.
"I was walking along, and I suddenly made my
decision on Stanford," Chapman said. "It was very
spontaneous."
Chapman believes that his father, a three-time
Ail-American who played football and baseball in
addition to wrestling, was instrumental in his suc
cess. "He wanted me to excel," Chapman said.
"He's really knowledgeable about wrestling, and he
knew that I'd like it."
As with all athletes, Chapman has learned more
universally applicable lessons through athletics. He
points to his determination as his greatest strength
and believes this quality comes from sports.
"Sports helped me develop the attitude to never
give up, to keep fighting," Chapman said. "This
applies to all aspects of my life."
Jay Jackson, co-captain of the wrestling team,
affirms that Chapman's attitude is apparent in his
wrestling. "Scott is very confident," Jackson said.
"Nothing seems to set him back."
Chapman enjoys pastimes of a completely oppo
site nature than his athletic pursuits. He is a pro
lific poet and enjoys pottery and regrets that he has
little time to follow these interests while at school.
In the next breath, however, Chapman said, "I
really miss football, too. That was really fun, to
knock into people."
Thankfully, Chapman allows wrestling to direct
those impulses in more healthy ways — ways that
will also lead him to sure success.
