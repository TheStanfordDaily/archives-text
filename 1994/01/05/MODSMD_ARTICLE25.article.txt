# Going for the gold
## Men's volleyball reloads in hopes of gunning down an NCAA title 
### Kathryn Yang Editorial staff 
Coming off last season's tre
mendous 18-6 finish and a No. 2
ranking in Volleyball Monthly, the
talented Cardinal men's spikers
will be gunning for the national
title again this year.
After bidding adieu to six
seniors, including four starters, the
men's volleyball team will be
"reloading" this new year in an
attempt to upend preseason
favorites UCLA, BYU and USC.
Unlike defending national cham
pion UCLA, which returns four of
six starters from last year's NCAA
title team, fifth-ranked Stanford
will be breaking in a lineup chock
full of raw talent and lacking only in
collegiate experience.
"At the beginning of the season
we will be less far along than the
other programs," said senior setter
Canyon Ceman. "But right from
the start, we'll be putting more
natural athletic ability on the court
than we ever have in the history of
Stanford volleyball."
Triggering the Cardinal offen
sive attack will be Ceman himself,
one of the most talented players in
the nation. Garnering both the
NCAA Player of the Year award
and All-American honors last year,
Ceman will continue to serve as
the squad's offensive catalyst by
adding to his school-record 4,028
career assists.
When he's not orchestrating an
attack from within the lines,
Ceman poses a threat with his dead
ly jump serve, which has left oppo
nents defenseless on 73 occassions.
With that total, Ceman is only 42
service aces behind former Stanford
standout Duncan Blackman, who
reached the century mark in aces
during the 1992 season.
The only question marks that
might plague Ceman's perfor
mance this season are two recent
operations on his right shoulder.
Over the summer Ceman under
went a major operation to correct
that condition, in addition to
undergoing arthroscopic surgery
for his torn rotator cuff. The set
ter has been rehabilitating from
both operations and is 95 percent
healthy for the first practice of the
season today.
"Canyon has had ongoing nerve
problems in his right shoulder ever
since he arrived at Stanford,"
according to head coach Ruben
Nieves. "The pinched nerve dis
abled a muscle and eventually that
muscle atrophied.

"It's amazing what he's done in
spite of that injury, especially con
sidering he was named National
Player of the Year last year."
Joining Ceman as the only
other senior on this year's squad
will be middle blocker Joe
Burghardt, who has come into his
own since winning a starting spot
his sophomore year. Last season,
the 6-foot-5 Alhambra, Calif,
native posted double figures in
kills in eight of the 14 matches he
played, including a season-high 16
against San Diego State.
However, despite Burghardt's
recent success at the middle block
ing position, Nieves is contemplat
ing a move that will place the senior
in the outside hitting position.
"If Joe played middle blocker
this year, he would be without a
question one of the best in the
nation at that spot and a true Ail-
American candidate," Nieves said.
"However, the team might need
him to switch positions to outside
hitter so he can pass more on
offense."
Playing opposite to Burghardt
as the other swing hitter, sopho
more Mike Lambert will be ready
to pick up the pace afler red-shirt
ing his freshman year. According
to Nieves, Lambert should become
one of the top players in the league
before the season is out.
"I think Mike is going to be on
the national team this year," said
junior swing hitter David Fischer.
"With him and Joe we should have
a very strong offensive attack."
As for the opposite hitter, Matt
Fuerbringer and Brink Sanders,
along with freshman Jeff Bender,
will be jockeying for the starting
slot. Blocking up the middle will be
left up to a talented quartet of con
tenders — Brian Barrett, Brant
Shelor, Brian Moore and Michael
Hoefer.
With most of the lineup set, the
Cardinal is now concentrating on
improving its chances of capturing
the elusive national title.
"Consistent players like Joe,
Brian (Garrett) and Lambert will be
the difference between the NCAA
title and the rest of the pack,"
Ceman said. "And beyond that it's a
matter of molding every bit of talent
into fundamentally sound volleyball
players. If we do that, we definitely
have a chance to win it."
However, no matter how much
Stanford improves now, the squad is
still no match for UCLA's experi
ence during the preseason. The Bru
ins will return four of six starters
with equally talented spikers filling

the remaining holes. Second-ranked
Brigham Young is also led by four
returning players, and No. 3 USC
has an extra man-advantage with
five experienced starters.
Despite its opponents' experi
ence, the Cardinal might still have
the final trump with home-court
advantage during the MPSF play
offs this year. The event will be held
at Stanford this April, the first time
the eight-team tournament is going
to be held outside of Southern Cali
fornia.

Last year, Southern California
schools made the most of the play
offs' proximity. Playing in their
backyard, Long Beach State
assaulted No. 2 Stanford, which
succumbed by a 15-13, 10-15, 15-9,
15-11 margin to the 49ers.
"The difference this year is that
everyone's going to be playing
here, and that gives us a better
chance to beat them," Ceman said.
"I would consider this season to be
an underachievement if we don't
do better than last year."

for his torn rotator cuff. The set
ter has been rehabilitating from
both operations and is 95 percent
healthy for the first practice of the
season today.
"Canyon has had ongoing nerve
problems in his right shoulder ever
since he arrived at Stanford,"
according to head coach Ruben
Nieves. "The pinched nerve dis
abled a muscle and eventually that
muscle atrophied.

"It's amazing what he's done in
spite of that injury, especially con
sidering he was named National
Player of the Year last year."
Joining Ceman as the only
other senior on this year's squad
will be middle blocker Joe
Burghardt, who has come into his
own since winning a starting spot
his sophomore year. Last season,
the 6-foot-5 Alhambra, Calif,
native posted double figures in
kills in eight of the 14 matches he
played, including a season-high 16
against San Diego State.
However, despite Burghardt's
recent success at the middle block
ing position, Nieves is contemplat
ing a move that will place the senior
in the outside hitting position.
"If Joe played middle blocker
this year, he would be without a
question one of the best in the
nation at that spot and a true Ail-
American candidate," Nieves said.
"However, the team might need
him to switch positions to outside
hitter so he can pass more on
offense."
Playing opposite to Burghardt
as the other swing hitter, sopho
more Mike Lambert will be ready
to pick up the pace afler red-shirt
ing his freshman year. According
to Nieves, Lambert should become
one of the top players in the league
before the season is out.
"I think Mike is going to be on
the national team this year," said
junior swing hitter David Fischer.
"With him and Joe we should have
a very strong offensive attack."
As for the opposite hitter, Matt
Fuerbringer and Brink Sanders,
along with freshman Jeff Bender,
will be jockeying for the starting
slot. Blocking up the middle will be
left up to a talented quartet of con
tenders — Brian Barrett, Brant
Shelor, Brian Moore and Michael
Hoefer.
With most of the lineup set, the
Cardinal is now concentrating on
improving its chances of capturing
the elusive national title.
"Consistent players like Joe,
Brian (Garrett) and Lambert will be
the difference between the NCAA
title and the rest of the pack,"
Ceman said. "And beyond that it's a
matter of molding every bit of talent
into fundamentally sound volleyball
players. If we do that, we definitely
have a chance to win it."
However, no matter how much
Stanford improves now, the squad is
still no match for UCLA's experi
ence during the preseason. The Bru
ins will return four of six starters
with equally talented spikers filling

the remaining holes. Second-ranked
Brigham Young is also led by four
returning players, and No. 3 USC
has an extra man-advantage with
five experienced starters.
Despite its opponents' experi
ence, the Cardinal might still have
the final trump with home-court
advantage during the MPSF play
offs this year. The event will be held
at Stanford this April, the first time
the eight-team tournament is going
to be held outside of Southern Cali
fornia.

Last year, Southern California
schools made the most of the play
offs' proximity. Playing in their
backyard, Long Beach State
assaulted No. 2 Stanford, which
succumbed by a 15-13, 10-15, 15-9,
15-11 margin to the 49ers.
"The difference this year is that
everyone's going to be playing
here, and that gives us a better
chance to beat them," Ceman said.
"I would consider this season to be
an underachievement if we don't
do better than last year."

Coming off last season's tre
mendous 18-6 finish and a No. 2
ranking in Volleyball Monthly, the
talented Cardinal men's spikers
will be gunning for the national
title again this year.
After bidding adieu to six
seniors, including four starters, the
men's volleyball team will be
"reloading" this new year in an
attempt to upend preseason
favorites UCLA, BYU and USC.
Unlike defending national cham
pion UCLA, which returns four of
six starters from last year's NCAA
title team, fifth-ranked Stanford
will be breaking in a lineup chock
full of raw talent and lacking only in
collegiate experience.
"At the beginning of the season
we will be less far along than the
other programs," said senior setter
Canyon Ceman. "But right from
the start, we'll be putting more
natural athletic ability on the court
than we ever have in the history of
Stanford volleyball."
Triggering the Cardinal offen
sive attack will be Ceman himself,
one of the most talented players in
the nation. Garnering both the
NCAA Player of the Year award
and All-American honors last year,
Ceman will continue to serve as
the squad's offensive catalyst by
adding to his school-record 4,028
career assists.
When he's not orchestrating an
attack from within the lines,
Ceman poses a threat with his dead
ly jump serve, which has left oppo
nents defenseless on 73 occassions.
With that total, Ceman is only 42
service aces behind former Stanford
standout Duncan Blackman, who
reached the century mark in aces
during the 1992 season.
The only question marks that
might plague Ceman's perfor
mance this season are two recent
operations on his right shoulder.
Over the summer Ceman under
went a major operation to correct
that condition, in addition to
undergoing arthroscopic surgery
for his torn rotator cuff. The set
ter has been rehabilitating from
both operations and is 95 percent
healthy for the first practice of the
season today.
"Canyon has had ongoing nerve
problems in his right shoulder ever
since he arrived at Stanford,"
according to head coach Ruben
Nieves. "The pinched nerve dis
abled a muscle and eventually that
muscle atrophied.

"It's amazing what he's done in

native posted double figures in
