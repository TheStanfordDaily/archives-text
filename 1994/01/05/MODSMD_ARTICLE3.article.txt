## 200-hour, $160,000 hinge installation finally opens doors in Wilbur 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff'writer 
Wilbur Hall residents found holiday gifts
from Housing and Dining Services in their
rooms when they returned from winter break
this week â€” new door stops.
Residents had complained about the new Fire
doors installed in Wilbur last summer because

the doors shut automatically, hindering interac
tion among residents.
The Santa Clara County Fire Marshal object
ed when students tried to prop their doors open,
and the University responded over winter break
by installing new hinges that only shut the doors
when smoke is detected in the room.
The original fire doors were "cost effective,
but didn't give us the flexibility we needed," said

Keith Guy, director of Housing and Dining Ser
vices.
The cost of installing the new hinges was
about $160,000, accordingto Martin Keller, who
assisted in the conversion as part of the student
housing operations office.
The old door closers will be reused when Es-
condido Village is renovated,
Keller said. The only additional
cost from the fire door problem is

the 200 hours of labor required to
install the new doors.
Keller said he did not know the
exact cost of the initial installation
because it was included in the $8
million total cost of the renovation.
Keller said the door closers
were removed because his office
realized that the doors were

"working against the sense of com
munity" in Wilbur.
The fire doors were initially
installed because the fire marshal
required either sprinklers or door
closers to be installed in all Uni
versity residences included in its
capital improvement program,
according to Keller.

Although sprinklers are more
expensive to install than door
closers, Keller said that his office
will put sprinklers in Florence
Moore Hall when it is renovated
next summer because of the objec
tions to door closers in Wilbur and
the additional protection offered
by sprinklers.
