# Uplifting attitude helps athlete overpower odds
## 
### Allison Short Staff writer 
Being ranked fifth in the state and set
ting several power lifting records is a big
enough accomplishment for any 57-year
old, but James Jue managed all this with
just one leg.
Jue, an employee at the Stanford Lin
ear Accelerator Center, took second place
in both the state and national power lift
ing competitions in the past year. He also
currently holds two state records in
power lifting, the most recent when he
lifted 314 pounds in the 55-59-year-old
master's class for the 220-pound catego
ry.
Although Jue lost his entire leg as a
teenager in a hunting accident, he has al
ways been eager to continue with his ath
letic activities. But he was unable to do
this until he met prosthetic designer Bob
Fuze, who created a sturdy but athleti
cally-mobile leg tailored specifically to his
needs.
"Because of his ability, I can walk
again," Jue said. "It's a very painful situ
ation, and it takes a lot of work to make
someone comfortable again."
After obtaining his first prosthesis,

Jue underwent a shoulder operation that
made it possible for him to lift weights.
He then attended a martial arts schwJ in
Mountain View and worked his way up to
a fourth-degree black belt in Ninjitsu.
"I learned the art for my own health
and protection," Jue said. "You'd be sur
prised at how powerful an art it can be. It
gives you an insight to yourself and how
to meditate."
It wasn't until the age of 40 that Jue
decided to experiment with weightlifting.
He eventually focused specifically on
power lifting, which relies more on indi
vidual strength, power and stability.
Weightlifting places more emphasis on
technique and momentum, he said.
Jue, who has been working at SLAC
for the past 30 years, is currently working
in SI J\o's electronic packaging division.
Five days a week, after a long day at
SLAC, Jue goes to Foothill College's gym,
World Gym or the Encina weight room to
tr_.in.
A member of the American Drug-Free
Power Association, Jue participates in
competitive power lifting in the master's
class, which is divided according to

weight and age.
Competitive power lifting con
sists of three events, Jue
explained: the bench press, the
dead lift and the squat.
Jue's goal is to complete a 1000-
pound total, a feat which consists
of a 250-pound squat, a 400-pound
bench press and a 350-pound dead
lift, he said.
Throughout the year, Jue com
petes at about 12 different loca
tions throughout the country,
often against many of the same
people.
"We're like gun fighters," Jue

said. "We go from town to town."
Although Jue said he feels a dis
tinct sense of competition among
his fellow weight lifters, he has
developed close relationships with
many of them.
"There are really nice people in
weightlifting — not macho peo
ple," Jue said. "Everyone is very
supportive. You do your best and
they congratulate you."
Jue has recently been spon
sored by Nova surgical appliances
and given a new leg with a locking
device that provides more lever
age, making it easier to lift weights
because his knees don't buckle, he
said.
"I'm slowly retraining and
learning how to do things," Jue
said. "It motivates me. Everyone

should do it."
Jue says that his adviser and
coach, Norman Moonugian, a for
mer ail-American football player
at Stanford and current world
class weight lifter, has played an
instrumental and inspirational
role in his career.
Through training, Jue has also
learned about his own health and
nutrition. "Weightlifting is great
for my health," Jue said. "I don't
get any more aches and pains, and
I eat better."
Jue will attend his next compe
tition on Jan. 15 in the Napa/Sono
ma County competition, where he
may capture another state record.
"Of course I'm limited, but I'll
challenge them and do what I
can," Jue said.
