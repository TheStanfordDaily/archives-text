# Uplifting attitude helps athlete overpower odds

### Allison Short Staff writer 
Being ranked fifth in the state and set
ting several power lifting records is a big
enough accomplishment for any 57-year
old, but James Jue managed all this with
just one leg.
Jue, an employee at the Stanford Lin
ear Accelerator Center, took second place
in both the state and national power lift
ing competitions in the past year. He also
currently holds two state records in
power lifting, the most recent when he
lifted 314 pounds in the 55-59-year-old
master's class for the 220-pound catego
ry.
Although Jue lost his entire leg as a
teenager in a hunting accident, he has al
ways been eager to continue with his ath
letic activities. But he was unable to do
this until he met prosthetic designer Bob
Fuze, who created a sturdy but athleti
cally-mobile leg tailored specifically to his
needs.
"Because of his ability, I can walk
again," Jue said. "It's a very painful situ
ation, and it takes a lot of work to make
someone comfortable again."
After obtaining his first prosthesis,

Jue underwent a shoulder operation that
made it possible for him to lift weights.
He then attended a martial arts schwJ in
Mountain View and worked his way up to
a fourth-degree black belt in Ninjitsu.
"I learned the art for my own health
and protection," Jue said. "You'd be sur
prised at how powerful an art it can be. It
gives you an insight to yourself and how
to meditate."
It wasn't until the age of 40 that Jue
decided to experiment with weightlifting.
He eventually focused specifically on
power lifting, which relies more on indi
vidual strength, power and stability.
Weightlifting places more emphasis on
technique and momentum, he said.
Jue, who has been working at SLAC
for the past 30 years, is currently working
in SI J\o's electronic packaging division.
Five days a week, after a long day at
SLAC, Jue goes to Foothill College's gym,
World Gym or the Encina weight room to
tr_.in.
A member of the American Drug-Free
Power Association, Jue participates in
competitive power lifting in the master's
class, which is divided according to


SLAC employee and record-holding powerlifter James Jue (right)
gives Bob Puze, the designer of Jue's prosthetic leg, a lot of the cred
it in his weightlifting success.
