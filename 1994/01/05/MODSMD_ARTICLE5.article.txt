# Administrators hurrying to meet budget deadline

### Sarah Katz Romesh Ratnesar Staff writers 
The imminent deadline for
submitting budget cut proposals
to the provost has University ad
ministrators scrambling to devel
op innovative ideas for both cut
ting fiscal excess and reorganiz
ing department operations.
In November, Provost Con
doleezza Rice asked all adminis
trative units to cut 5 percent to 10
percent from their current oper
ating budgets for each of the next
three years. That mandate is part
of a larger effort to slash $18 mil
lion to $20 million from the Uni
versity's annual budget by 1997.
Since then, administrators
have been hard at work to meet
Rice's Jan. 15 deadline, brain
storming new ways to do business
and trim budget fat.
The manner in which depart

ments have conducted their ex
aminations varies, with some of
fices engaging in consultation
across units, and others resorting
to more centralized, top-down
methods as a result of the near
ness of the deadline.
"We're not finding much fat,"
said Chief Financial Officer Peter
Van Etten, to whom nine units re
port. "We're looking very closely
at the way we do business, and
seeing how we can do it at less ex
pense." He said tentative propos
als include contracting out and
even eliminating some services.
Van Etten added that individ
ual managers are responsible for
examining their own unit's bud
get before reporting back to him
for review. He will then submit to
the provost an overall plan for his
units.
Similarly, special assistant to
the president Jean Fetter said
that units reporting to the presi
dent's office — including the
ombudsperson, Memorial Church
and public affairs — "must sub
mit a plan based on the guide
lines" to her, and she will subse
quently send recommendations to
Rice.
In contrast, Vice Provost of
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds,
who oversees nearly all student
services, is working with a small
group from her office to examine
the budgets of each department
that falls under her jurisdiction.
Some units in other areas of
the University have already for
mulated specific ideas for rein
venting their day-to-day opera
tions.
"All the legal issues at the Uni
versity have been resolved, and
there is no need for lawyers," said
General Counsel Michael Roster
facetiously, "but unfortunately,
my colleagues keep creating legal
issues for us to deal with." As a
result, Roster said his office is
experimenting with new ways to

"hold the line and reduce costs."
For example, he said, two
lawyers who recently left the
office will not be replaced. But he
noted that the office is trying
more long-term money-saving
techniques, including reducing
the amount of meetings officials
attend and "trying to educate peo
ple on campus so they don't cre
ate legal problems, or notify us
well in advance before something
becomes a significant legal prob
lem." He said "a number of task
forces" within his office are cur
rently examining such issues.
"At a certain point, you cannot
continue to do incremental cut
ting," he said. "You have to stand
back, and say, 'What are we
doing, and is there a way to start
at ground zero and provide the
same services in a different
way?" "
Vice President of Faculty and
Staff Services Barbara Butter
field has asked her department
managers to give her lists of
"great ideas" that she will choose
from and suggest to the provost.
Among the ideas already devel
oped is a new, flexible staff bene
fits package which, she said,
"reduces task load and energy,
reduces paperwork, increases

benefits and gives relief to
employees in terms of the size of
the premiums they have to pay."
Butterfield added that through
"collective consultation" with
unit managers, her office is "look
ing at (budget cuts] in both ways"
— in terms of both restructuring
services and eliminating them.
"Everything we do that is discre
tionary is possible to cut," she
said. "But what I see this as is a
time to think bigger thoughts —
to suppose we completely change
the way we do things."
Yet for the time being, there is
a good deal of uncertainty about
the provost's final decision, and
all administrators, while forced to
examine their departments, are
aware that no one can predict who
will take the hardest hits.
Judith Little, director of the
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment, said that while she is cur
rently doing some "creative
thinking" toward meeting the
approaching deadline, she prefers
not to sound any premature
alarms.
"Things are undefined," she
said. "If we experience no budget
cuts at all, there's no point in
causing any anxiety over some
thing that might never happen."
