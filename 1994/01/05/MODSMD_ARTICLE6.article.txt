# Education, training top adviser's plans
## Harassment coordinator takes reins 
### Sandy Lee Staff writer 
Although the University began
1994 without the new sexual ha
rassment policy fully in place, the
recent appointment of a coordi
nating adviser, clinical Psychiatry
Prof. Laraine Zappert, has helped
the implementation process near
completion.
Named to the post in Decem
ber, Zappert began work as Stan
ford's first coordinating adviser
yesterday, while continuing her
private practice in Palo Alto and
teaching at the School of Medi
cine.
"One of the most important
goals these past two months has
been to find the right person to
take the lead in implementing the
policy. We feel that we have found
the right person," Provost Con
doleezza Rice said.
Zappert was chosen for the po
sition after a formal search for the
coordinating adviser was waived.
An internal search was held in
order to expedite the implementa
tion, said search panel member

Jean Fetter, special assistant to
University President Gerhard
Casper.
"President Casper and Provost

Rice wanted the
policy imple
mented by the
beginning of the
year, and a for
mal search would
have taken too
long," Fetter
said. The admin
istration also felt
that it was im-

portant to find a person who
knows the Stanford environment,
she said.
Zappert's association with the
University goes back to 1978
when she came to the Center for
Research on Women as a project
director and research associate.
She eventually became the direc
tor of the Women's Group at Cow
ell Student Health Center.
In approaching her new duties,
Zappert said she will draw from
two categories of experience: her


Zapped
clinical work and her research.
As a clinical psychologist in pri
vate practice, she has worked with
both those who have experienced
sexual harassment and those who
have been accused of harassing
others. Zappert also has experi
ence working with students while
on the Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services staff at Cowell and as a
professor and lecturer.
"Dr. Zappert is admirably qual
ified across all dimensions. She
has significant experience in coun
seling and psychological services
as well as a wide range of experi
ence with students that will bene
fit her since this policy covers fac
ulty, staff and students," Fetter
said.
While applauding the new poli
cy as "a clear and cogent policy
with less room for misunderstand
ing," Zappert said she is merely
pulling the pieces together rather
than forming her own agenda.
"I'd like to see the policy imple
mented as stilted. The policy treats
both the accuser and the accused
fairly, respecting the rights of the
person who has suffered the
harassment and the alleged accused

until proven guilty," she said.
In addition to completing initial
training, Zappert sees her main
task as raising awareness of sexual
harassment through education
and community outreach.
To begin that education, Zap
pert will put together a brochure
that explains the problem of sexu
al harassment and how the new
policy is designed to deal with this
problem with more sensitivity and
discretion.

Stressing the importance of the
educational function of the sexual
harassment advising team and
panelists, Zappert said she hopes
to quickly make people aware of
how the policy affects them.
Understanding the policy and real
izing the consequences of harass
ment will be a "credible deterrent"
to harassing behavior, she said.
"There has already been a great
deal of willingness on the part of
invited advisers to participate [for
the policy to be successfull," she
said.
Specific faculty and staff mem
bers were asked shortly before
winter break to become the advis
ers and panelists who will make up
the core of resources for both com
plainants and mediators. Though
some individuals have yet to accept
formally, Zappert said she expects
the group of 12 to 16 to be in place

by the end of this week. In addition
to the advisers, there will be about
six panelists - including one stu
dent _ who will primarily offer
advice to University administra
tors who need help in mediating
situations.
Zappert said the advisers and
panelists will begin initial training
by the end of January or the begin
ning of February. After two and a
half days of instruction on the
legal and procedural aspects of the
policy, as well as on listening and
mediating skills, they will be ready
to address problems.
"I see the training as an ongo
ing process," Zappert said. "We
will meet periodically, depending
on the volume and need (of the
advisers' servicesl, to discuss the
kinds of situations advisers have
confronted and continue train
ing," she said.
Although she said she doesn't
know yet how widespread harass
ment is on campus, she believes
the availability of the advisers will
make it easier "for people to
explore their discomfort with cer
tain situations."
"This is a very important time.
I'm very optimistic that we can
make it work, although we will
know better how accessible and
successful the policy is in a few
months," Zappert said.

"President Casper and Provost

Rice wanted the
policy imple
mented by the
beginning of the
year, and a for
mal search would
have taken too
long," Fetter
said. The admin
istration also felt
that it was im-

portant to find a person who
knows the Stanford environment,
she said.
Zappert's association with the
University goes back to 1978
when she came to the Center for
Research on Women as a project
director and research associate.
She eventually became the direc
tor of the Women's Group at Cow
ell Student Health Center.
In approaching her new duties,
Zappert said she will draw from
two categories of experience: her


Zapped
clinical work and her research.
As a clinical psychologist in pri
vate practice, she has worked with
both those who have experienced
sexual harassment and those who
have been accused of harassing
others. Zappert also has experi
ence working with students while
on the Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services staff at Cowell and as a
professor and lecturer.
"Dr. Zappert is admirably qual
ified across all dimensions. She
has significant experience in coun
seling and psychological services
as well as a wide range of experi
ence with students that will bene
fit her since this policy covers fac
ulty, staff and students," Fetter
said.
While applauding the new poli
cy as "a clear and cogent policy
with less room for misunderstand
ing," Zappert said she is merely
pulling the pieces together rather
than forming her own agenda.
"I'd like to see the policy imple
mented as stilted. The policy treats
both the accuser and the accused
fairly, respecting the rights of the
person who has suffered the
harassment and the alleged accused

until proven guilty," she said.
In addition to completing initial
training, Zappert sees her main
task as raising awareness of sexual
harassment through education
and community outreach.
To begin that education, Zap
pert will put together a brochure
that explains the problem of sexu
al harassment and how the new
policy is designed to deal with this
problem with more sensitivity and
discretion.

Stressing the importance of the
educational function of the sexual
harassment advising team and
panelists, Zappert said she hopes
to quickly make people aware of
how the policy affects them.
Understanding the policy and real
izing the consequences of harass
ment will be a "credible deterrent"
to harassing behavior, she said.
"There has already been a great
deal of willingness on the part of
invited advisers to participate [for
the policy to be successfull," she
said.
Specific faculty and staff mem
bers were asked shortly before
winter break to become the advis
ers and panelists who will make up
the core of resources for both com
plainants and mediators. Though
some individuals have yet to accept
formally, Zappert said she expects
the group of 12 to 16 to be in place

by the end of this week. In addition
to the advisers, there will be about
six panelists - including one stu
dent _ who will primarily offer
advice to University administra
tors who need help in mediating
situations.
Zappert said the advisers and
panelists will begin initial training
by the end of January or the begin
ning of February. After two and a
half days of instruction on the
legal and procedural aspects of the
policy, as well as on listening and
mediating skills, they will be ready
to address problems.
"I see the training as an ongo
ing process," Zappert said. "We
will meet periodically, depending
on the volume and need (of the
advisers' servicesl, to discuss the
kinds of situations advisers have
confronted and continue train
ing," she said.
Although she said she doesn't
know yet how widespread harass
ment is on campus, she believes
the availability of the advisers will
make it easier "for people to
explore their discomfort with cer
tain situations."
"This is a very important time.
I'm very optimistic that we can
make it work, although we will
know better how accessible and
successful the policy is in a few
months," Zappert said.
