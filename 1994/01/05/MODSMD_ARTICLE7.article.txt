# A 						tree grows at Stanford
## New oak shades founders' graves

Leland and Jane will once again rest in the shade
when a 20-foot-tall oak tret 4 is transplanted to guard
over their mausoleum next week.
The new tree — which will be planted Jan. 13,
weather-permitting — will replace the approximate
ly 300-year-old giant oak that towered over the mau
soleum since the tomb's construction in the 1890s,
according to Stanford grounds manager Herb Fong.
The old oak was removed Aug 30 because it had
been irreparably damaged by the bacterial diseases
cryptocline and diplodia.
Fong said the University learned about the new
tree, which is about 50 years old, after a call from
San Francisco Water Department officials. The
water department said they had a large oak that
needed to be removed because its roots were endan
gering underground water pipes.
Fong has given the tree a 50-50 chance of surviv
ing the transplant because its large size — it has a di
ameter of 12 inches — may cause problems. Howev
er, "temperature-wise and condition-wise, it's
ideal," he said
The tree will be removed and transplanted by A-Z
Tree Company and will be placed 10 feet closer to the
mausoleum than its predecessor
The tree will be provided with supplemental irri
gation over the spring and summer, and Fong said
he should know if it was a success
ful transplant by this summer.
The cost of transplanting the
tree will be about $700, Fong said.

That is considerably less than the
"couple thousand" dollars the
University would have spent to
purchase and plant a container
grown tree.
"It's a biggest-bang-for-our
buck type situation," Fong said.
"Plus we get to conserve a tree
that would normally be lost."
