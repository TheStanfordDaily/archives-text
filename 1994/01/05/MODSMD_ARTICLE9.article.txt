Grant for fetal research
WASHINGTON (AP) - The federal
government yesterday approved the first
grant for fetal tissue research since Presi
dent Clinton lifted a 5-year-old ban on
studies using cells from aborted fetuses.
The National Institute of Neurological
Disorders and Stroke is giving $4.5 mil
lion to three institutions to study the
effects of implanting fetal tissue into the
brains of patients with Parkinson's dis
ease.
Dr. Patricia Grady, head of the federal
institute, said there may be more grants
this year, both for Parkinson's and other
brain disorders.
She called the Parkinson's research
promising. "We are optimistic it will be
helpful for at least some of the patients,"
she said.
Presidents Reagan and Bush banned

federal funding for research using fetal
tissue from elective abortions. But Clin
ton lifted the ban in one of his first official
acts.
Mexican Rebels retreat
SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS,
Mexico (AP) â€” Indian rebels retreated
into the jungle yesterday, pulling out of
three towns as thousands of soldiers
poured into the remote southeast follow
ing a bloody uprising.
While the army largely regained con
trol of the area, the government failed to
persuade the rebels to agree to peace
talks. The rebels are protesting injustices
in Chiapas, which is plagued by illiteracy,
poverty and chronic land disputes.
As many as 100 people have been killed
in four days of fighting in Chiapas, one of
Mexico's poorest states.
