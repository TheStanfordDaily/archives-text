### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Biology Emeritus Prof. Arthur C. Giese, a
member of the Stanford faculty for nearly 40
years, died of heart disease on Jan. 1 at Stan
ford Hospital. He was 89.
Giese earned his doctorate in biology from
Stanford in 1933, after completing his under
graduate work at the University of Chicago.
Joining the faculty upon completion of his
doctoral work, Giese taught classes in general
biology, general physiology and invertebrate
biology until his retirement in 1969.

His area of specialty was cell physiology,
and his textbook, "Cell Physiology," was pub
lished in 1959. The text was a "stepping stone
to modem molecular biology," according to his
son, Arthur T. Giese. "It virtually opened up
the field."
During his years at Stanford, Giese helped
more than 200 graduate students receive their
doctorates. After his retirement, he main
tained an office on campus and continued
writing and editing his texts.
"He was a true Renaissance man, a prolific
writer and a man of many interests who stood
as a giant in the minds of most people who

knew him," said his son.
In addition to being a recognized authority
in marine invertebrate biology and cell physi
ology, Giese was a concert-level cellist and
flutist, a master carpenter and a dedicated
conservationist, his son said.
Giese was born in Chicago on Dec. 19, 1904.
He is survived by two sisters, a son, five grand
daughters and one great grandson.
Donations on behalf of Giese may be made
to the Raina Giese Studio Art Scholarship
Fund at the Stanford Art Department.
A memorial service for Giese will be held
Monday at noon in Memorial Church.
