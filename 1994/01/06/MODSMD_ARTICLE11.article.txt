Tip O'Neill dead at 81
BOSTON (AP) - Thomas P. "Tip"
O'Neill Jr., the former House speaker
whose public career brought him from an
Irish immigrant neighborhood to the
pinnacle of national power, died yester
day night. He was 81.
O'Neill, who had undergone cancer
surgery in 1987 and again in 1990, died
at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hos
pital, said Leigh O'Neill, the former
speaker's granddaughter and the daugh
ter of former Lt. Gov. Thomas P. O'Neill
111 of Boston.
A consummate politician and proud of
it, Tip O'Neill lived Democratic politics
from the day he was elected to his ward
committee in 1936, just before graduat
ing from Boston College, until 1987
when he retired at the end of his 17th
term in Congress and fifth as speaker.
O'Neill transformed the speakership
from a political and parliamentary post
to a bully pulpit that he used in his many

battles against President Reagan.
O'Neill called Reagan "the least
knowledgeable of any president I've ever
met, on any subject. He works by three
by-five cards."
Wilson proposes tax cuts
SACRAMENTO (AP) - Gov. Pete
Wilson proposed tax reductions for small
business and middle-income California
families yesterday in his annual address
to a joint session of the state Senate and
Assembly.
The Republican governor proposed
giving start-up businesses tax credits of
$1,000 for each new job created.
"For middle-class taxpayers, instead
of a hike, I say we give them a break,"
Wilson said.
"Specifically, I propose that, for Cali
fornia taxpayers earning less than
$40,000 who will pay higher taxes under
the Clinton tax plan, we reduce (state)
income taxes . . .
