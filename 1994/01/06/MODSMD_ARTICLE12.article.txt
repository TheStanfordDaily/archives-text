## Mideast talks resume again 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) â€” The on-again, off
again negotiations over Palestinian autono
my were back on track yesterday after days
of intensive fax and telephone diplomacy
solved the latest dispute, Israeli officials said.
But Oded Ben-Ami, a spokesman for
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, said it would
take "weeks and weeks" to reach agreement
in the negotiations expected to resume Mon
day in the Egyptian resort of Taba.
The two sides are already more than three
weeks past the initial Dec. 13 deadline when
Israel was to have started pulling troops out
of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank region
of Jericho.
The main dispute is conflicting claims over
controlling border crossings in the occupied
territories. Israel says it has to monitor the
borders to maintain security, while the PLO
wants the job as a symbol of sovereignty.
Israeli officials said the PLO had agreed to
accept an understanding for joint control at
the borders, reached in Dec. 29 meetings in
Cairo.
The compromise that broke the logjam
was a piece of diplomatic sleight-of-hand,
calling the Cairo paper an understanding

instead of an agreement and leaving it open
for change, Israel radio said.
This meant the Palestinians could still
raise fresh demands in Taba, the report said.
The compromise was reportedly reached
in a series of telephone calls and faxes
between Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and
top Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath.
Shaath said the talks likely will resume
Sunday. He blamed Israel for what will
amount to a two-week delay in negotiations,
and predicted a final agreement could be
reached in two to three weeks.
"I feel we have come a long way ... and
are over the tempest over the claims there
was an agreement in Cairo," he said.
Rabin hedged a little when he told
reporters in Israel that he hoped the talks
"will be resumed after an appropriate basis is
found to renew them .... If there is no
agreement then everything is open."
The radio quoted Rabin as saying that a
date would only be set today.
He also reiterated that the Israel-PLO
accord wouldn't be carried out until a
detailed agreement about implementing
autonomy was reached.
