# Clinton complies with subpoena
## White House will turn over real estate documents to grand jury 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The White
House will begin turning over to the Jus
tice Department today documents on the
first family's half-ownership in an
Arkansas real estate venture, the adminis
tration said.
The documents will include those
removed from White House lawyer Vin
cent Foster's office shortly after he com
mitted suicide last July, the White House
said in a statement released yesterday.
The White House had said it would take
several weeks to deliver the documents,
but the administration faces growing pub
licity and calls from Republicans on Capi
tol Hill for appointment of a special prose
cutor to look into the matter.
The development came as House
Republicans began negotiations with the
federal S&L cleanup agency for records
related to a failed Arkansas thrift, accord
ing to congressional sources familiar with
the talks.
The S&L's operator, James McDougal,

is a former Clinton political supporter and
an ex-partner in the Arkansas real estate
venture with the Clintons â€” Whitewater
Development Co.
Justice Department officials are trying
to learn whether funds from the failed
S&L, Madison Guaranty Savings and
Loan, were diverted to Whitewater.
Hillary Rodham Clinton says the couple
lost tens of thousands of dollars in White
water.
The president's private counsel, David
Kendell, requested the grand jury subpoe
na Dec. 23, a step that makes it more diffi
cult for Congress to obtain the material.
White House senior adviser Bruce
Lindsey said the subpoena assures the pri
vacy of the documents and"the privacy of
the process as provided for by federal law."
The subpoena makes it more difficult for
Congress to obtain the documents.
The subpoena was issued Dec. 24, amid
growing calls for the turnover of the docu
ments to the authorities.

Some five boxes of material will be
turned over to Justice, White House senior
adviser Bruce Lindsey said.
He said that, while the subpoena calls
for all the documents to be submitted by
Jan. 18, most of the material will be sub
mitted before then.
Meanwhile, congressional sources said
the Resolution Trust Corp. is being asked
to provide records of money-losing trans
actions, accounts of those with outstand
ing loans when the thrift failed and analy
ses of the thrift's financial health prepared
by outside auditors.
In addition, one source said, investiga
tors are seeking an analysis of the thrift's
troubles, prepared less than 18 months
before its 1989 failure, by a Memphis law
firm.
That document could provide vital
information about questionable transac
tions, and reveal whether anyone close to
Clinton was involved, in the months pre
ceding the thrift's demise.
