HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -
Virginia Kelley, the fun-loving,
pony-playing mother of President
Clinton who taught her son how to
deal with adversity, died at home
early today. She was 70.
Sheriff Larry Selig announced
her death. The cause was not
immediately known, but Mrs. Kel
ley had told a group of women last
year that she had a recurrence of
cancer and that she was undergo
ing chemotherapy.
The retired nurse buried three
husbands, one an abusive alcoholic.
She lived apart from her oldest child
for two years, helped her only other
child through a drug addiction and,
late in life, fought breast cancer.
None of it shook her optimism
and self-confidence, traits she
passed on to the president.
