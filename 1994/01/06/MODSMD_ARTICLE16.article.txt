## Editorials A 						storage solution? 
### 
Here it comes again: another
round of discussions on
summer storage.
But in reality, what is there to
talk about?
The University says that it
cannot afford to reinstate the ser
vice, given the additional $20 mil
lion in budget cuts it is facing this
year.
Fine. In fact, most students
would probably prefer to spare
their major from the budget ax
than save summer storage.
But the University's argument
ignores one crucial point: sum
mer storage doesn't have to cost
Stanford a single penny. Stu
dents, of course, don't want to
pay the high prices charged by
off-campus storage facilities —
but if necessary, they would cer
tainly pay a comparable price for
the added convenience of on-cam
pus storage.

The ASSU Senate has indicat
ed that summer storage is too
large a project for the ASSU to
run by itself; therefore, a logical
proposal would be for the service
to be administered jointly by the
University and the ASSU, but
completely paid for by the stu
dents who use the service.
It is unreasonable for the Uni
versity to expect its students,
who come from all 50 states and
98 countries, to take their
belongings home over the sum
mer months. Furthermore, the
use of off-campus storage facili
ties is unnecessarily difficult for
students, many of whom do not
have cars. Summer storage is, as
students have said, an "essential
service." The debate over sum
mer storage has gone on for too
long; the ASSU and the Universi
ty need to develop a plan immedi
ately.
