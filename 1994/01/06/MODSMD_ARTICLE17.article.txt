# Pernicious proposal
## 
### 
BLOATED bureaucracy and
restrictive regulation. As if
American universities and the
U.S. Government didn't have
enough of these hindrances already,
the Department of Education is set
to unveil yet another echelon of
evaluation, data compilation and
administrative contraptions for pri
vate post-secondary institutions.
The government is considering
a proposal to stiffen the accredita
tion process for all such institu
tions, in order to crack down on
disreputable schools and student
loan abuses. In theory, this
appears to be a meritorious idea.
But while the new rule may
catch a few unscrupulous, fly-by
night truck driving schools and
welding institutes, upstanding
universities like Stanford will like
ly become subject to government
interference in everything from
admissions to curriculum under
the new guidelines.
The proposal's most deleterious

impacts would include a marked
increase in required paperwork
and the legitimization of govern
ment control over private institu
tions. The proposals would also
create State Post-secondary
Review Entities, or SPRES, which
would give authority beyond that
of regional accreditors and state
licensers to determine standards
for schools.
Such measures would,
undoubtedly, unearth some bad
apples. But, given the severity of
the proposals, they could end up
costing more than they recoup in
unpaid loans and exacting an
incalculable toll on private higher
education. Increasing government
control of private education, in
particular, clearly endangers the
unique freedoms of colleges and
institutions.
In all, the additional require
ments appear to be the proverbial
elephant gun to use upon the occa
sional flies in students' ointments.
