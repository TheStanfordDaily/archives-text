## A 						long-term student affair 
### 
STUDENT AFFAIRS seems to have
a bad reputation at Stanford these
days. While it is difficult to make
blanket categorizations of services
which range from Financial Aid to
Greek Affairs, terms such as "cod
dling," "extraneous services" and
"unrelated to the academic mission"
have become commonplace in institu
tional discourse.
Historically, faculty members per
formed the tasks which are now done by
Student Affairs staff. As academia
became more complex, faculty divested
themselves of some of the less attractive
aspects of working with students. In the
last 50 to 100 years a new class of Uni
versity employee, the Student Affairs
Professional, appeared on the American
college campus.
Instead of articulating a clear mis
sion for Student Affairs, the current
strategy is continuous cutting in all
areas.
Student Affairs is critical to student
life for three reasons.
First, the objectives of Stanford, in
the words of Jane and Leland Stanford
are "to qualify students for personal
success and direct usefulness of life."
Stanford strives to educate students
who are informed citizens. Students
attend a college like Stanford with a
broader agenda than intellectual devel
opment. They are also interested in per
sonal growth, in developing leadership

skills, and in defining themselves and
their relationships. These activities
take place in the student community
beyond the lecture hall.
Second, Student Affairs services are
intimately connected with the academic
success of students. By providing the
services which allow students to be
happy and healthy, Student Affairs pro
vides the framework for academic suc
cess. For example, the ethnic centers
have proven their ability to increase the
graduation rates of minority under
graduates.
Third, it is illogical to continue to cut
services at a time when the student
body is growing. While we think of ser
vices as focused solely on undergradu
ates, they are also used by graduate stu
dents. The increasing numbers of mas
ters students, and the increasing time
to degree for doctoral students means
that the number of graduate students is
increasing by about 100 students each
year.
Now is the time for faculty and stu
dents to rally around the cause of Stu
dent Affairs. If current plans are put
into place, and another 30 percent of
the budget is cut from the Vice Provost
for Student Affairs area, the organiza
tion will be operating at less than half
strength. The cumulative effect of three
rounds of budget cuts is to leave an
organization funded at only half of its
level in the late 1980s. No other part of

Stanford has faced such decimation.
If we continue on this path, there are
two alternatives for Stanford.
1. Return responsibility for services
to the faculty. While this might provide
a holistic education rarely seen in the
19905, it seems unlikely to be imple
mented.
2. Continue to dismantle student ser
vices, putting the onus for personal sur
vival on students. Likely consequences
of this are decreased graduation rates, a
fragmenting student community, and
decreased student satisfaction. In the
long run alumni giving and the positive
reputation of Stanford may be at stake.
This does students and the institution a
grave disservice.
Neither of these options is the cor
rect one. Now is the time to articulate a
clear vision for the future of Stanford
Student Affairs. It is time to recognize
that Student Affairs staff are not ancil
lary cruise directors, but key players in
student success. But first and foremost,
we must preserve funding, to continue
to offer a well-rounded education to
Stanford students.

Chris Golde would like to have just one
student affair before her time at Stan
ford is up.
