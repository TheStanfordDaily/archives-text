# Plans for CoHo expansion canceled
## Taco Bell will be ready for business by end of quarter

Crowded nights at the Coffee House
will remain a Stanford tradition now that
plans for the CoHo's expansion into
Tresidder Recreation Center have been
canceled due to budget cuts.
Though schematic drawings and cost
estimates for the $1.2 million project had
alreadv been completed, the Provost's Of
fice's decided last month thatfundraising
for the Coffee House is "not a priority,"

which effectively killed the plan, said
Paul Szczesiul, the associate director of
Tresidder Union.
"Some renovation will have to be done
just to keep the place operating, but there
will be no change in size," he said.
Szczesiul's office had hoped to raise
$800,000 of the cost through fundraising
and to draw the rest of the funds from
Tresidder reserves and the University's
General Plant Improvement Fund. The
University's recently announced $20 mil
lion budget cuts led to the plan's demise.

Szczesiul said there are no plans to ex
pand the Coffee House even in the next
few years. "The plans are up in the air,"
he said. "With budget cuts, everything's
up in the air."
The original plans, which were an
nounced last year, would have doubled
the Coffee House's seating capacity from
120 to 240, as well as adding new air con
ditioning and soijnd systems, Szczesiul
had hoped that the fundraising and the
construction would be complet
ed by the end of this year.
Construction on the Taco
Bell in Tresidder, on the other
hand, will go as planned, if
slightly behind schedule. Gener
al planning and compliance
problems — such as obtaining
the necessary building permits
— prevented the construction
from beginning over winter
break, as originally scheduled,
but the groundbreaking should

begin sometime early next
month, Szczesiul said.
He said the project, which is
drawing its $70,000 construc
tion cost from Tresidder
reserves, should definitely be
completed by the end of winter
quarter. The mini-restaurant
will replace the front desk at the
Tresidder Recreation Center,
operating in an area about 500-
600 square feet.
Bon Appetit, the company
that runs food operations in
Tresidder, now owns and will
manage the franchise after sign
ing a licensing agreement with
Taco Bell in mid-September.
