## Music class furthers students' musical ignorance 
### 
THOSE WHO DOUBT that "polit
ical correctness" with its accom
panying debasement of academic
standards has been carried to bizarre
extremes should consult page 550 of
the current "Courses and Degrees" and
see "Music SF, Feminist Issues in 20th
Century American Music."
Lest I be accused of quoting out of
context, here follows the course
description, phrased in the currently
acceptable babble, in all of its ludicrous
entirety (the italics are mine):
"Issues in current feminist theory
considering moments in 20th-century

American music. Concerns of race, eth
nicity, class and sexuality are taken as
inseperable [sic] from questions around
gender. Topics: 1920s blueswomen and
forming resistant identities; early rock
n' roll and cross-race appropriation
and exploitation. 1960s girl groups and
the construction of femininity;
women's music and cultural feminism,
cock rock, Madonna, Riot Girl and
female sexual expression; rappers and
coalition politics; k.d. lang, RuPaul,
androgyny, and queer theory; African-
American divas, conflicting class/race
allegiance and the effort to rewrite his

tory."
It is not the function of any univer
sity, let alone Stanford, to submit to
trendist pressures by reinforcing the
ignorances and prejudices of a cultural
ly-deprived adolescence, or to perpetu
ate deplorable outcroppings of pop cul
ture media-foisted on an historically
rootless youth.
Having taught Jazz Studies at Stan
ford for eight years, I found the over
whelming majority of students —
including music majors and even mem
bers of the jazz band — languish in
ignorance of the Bachs, Mozarts and

Stravinskys of America's classical
music from James P. Johnson, Louis
Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Bessie
Smith and Earl Hines to Lester Young,
Mary Lou Williams, Billy Strayhorn,
Charlie Parker, Charles Mingus and
Bill Evans. Given such conditions, let
Stanford students avail themselves of
"cock rock, Madonna, Riot Girl, early
rock n' roll, rappers, k.d. lang and
queer theory" outside the classroom,
where they have more than ample
enticements to do so.
