# New information about Self Defense for Women
## 
### 
I would like to clarify information
contained in a Nov. 24 Daily article
titled "Self defense course may return

next fall." The corrected information is
as follows.
1. Three sections of Issues in Self
Defense for Women are now being
offered off campus at the University
Lutheran Church on Wednesday and
Thursday nights and on Saturday
mornings. The format is the same as it

was on campus â€” a 10-week course
containing physical techniques,
assertiveness training and discussions
of issues concerning violence against
women. The first classes meet the
week of Jan. 5, 6, and 8.
2. Women Defending Ourselves
Collective is still in the process of

exploring options for bringing the
class back onto the Stanford campus.
Although it is our hope to be back on
campus in the fall, there is no guaran
tee that it will be possible for us to do
so.
