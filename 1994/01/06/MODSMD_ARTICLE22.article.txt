## Stanford's shooting Star(bird) Freshman an instant hit for the ninth-ranked Cardinal 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
When the No. 9 Stanford women's
basketball team (7-2) faces No. 22
Washington (8-1) tonight in their first
Pacific 10 Conference game of the year,
it will be a homecoming of sorts for
freshman forward Kate Starbird.
At 6-foot-2, Stanford's tallest recruit
in this year's freshman class expects to
see some familiar faces in the crowd
near her hometown of Tacoma, but not
every Husky fan can afford to root for
her.
"It's going to be a pretty hostile envi
ronment to play in," Starbird said.
Small wonder. Over the course of
Stanford's still-young season, Starbird
has responded to increases in playing
time by consistently contributing to key
victories. Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer has rewarded her with a
starting role in the perennially strong
Cardinal lineup.
"Kate made things happen every
time she came into games," Van-
Derveer said.
Indeed, in her first career start
against Long Beach State on Dec. 8,
Stanford set Pac-10 and school records
for points scored and margin of victory
in a 122-49 trouncing.
Since then, Starbird has led the team
in scoring twice, racking up 19 points
against Santa Clara and a career-high
20 against fourth-ranked Connecticut
— a game in which she played just 21
minutes.
Her caliber of play has drawn
widespread praise.
"Starbird is the best transition play
er we have had since Sonja Henning
[Class of '91 and Stanford's all-time
assist leader]," VanDerveer said.
"Her strength is her ability to handle
the ball . . . she is quick with the ball,
and her size gives her good vision,"
VanDerveer added.
And Starbird brings an added dimen

sion to the Cardinal attack.
"She goes to the bucket hard and fin
ishes well," said teammate Rachel
Hemmer.
According to Hemmer, people have
always thought of the Cardinal as "a
stand-up team, but Starbird is chang
ing all that. She has the best ball-han
dling skills of anyone Stanford's ever
had at her position."
Yet Starbird would be the first one to
admit that she is not the Messianic sec
ond-coming of Val Whiting.
"(Anita] Kaplan and Hemmer are
the major parts of our offense. My role
is to be active in the fast break and get
them the ball," Starbird said.
She also values the opportunity to
learn from more experienced players.
"They've been to the top and are all
great athletes. They make us better
players because they push us hard in
practice," Starbird said.
VanDerveer said that Starbird needs
to work harder on her defense and
rebounding, even if she is "a little ahead
of schedule."
In addition to her 9.3 points-per
game average, Starbird has blocked
seven shots already — second only to
center Kaplan for Stanford — and she
is ninth in the Pac-10 in free-throw per
centage, shooting a stellar 74.1 percent
from the charity stripe.
The court in Maples Pavilion is a
long way from Fort Campbell, Ky.,
where Starbird first learned to play bas
ketball at the age of seven.
Growing up in the Wildcat state,
however, was not the crucial factor in
her on-court development.
"Playing against boys in a co-ed
league gave me a head start," Starbird
said.
Any contribution Starbird makes
can be viewed as an added bonus for the
Cardinal women, because her cracked
right kneecap made her a question
mark at the beginning of the year.
"We weren't quite sure how she was

going to do, but she came through in
some big games," Hemmer said.
Starbird now wears kneepads to pro
tect herself from further injury, but
that's not her only health-related
worry.
"Dorm life is great, but it keeps me
up too late," the Larkin resident said.
Still, when asked if she is happy on
the Farm, Starbird posed a question of
her own: "How could you be unhappy?"
