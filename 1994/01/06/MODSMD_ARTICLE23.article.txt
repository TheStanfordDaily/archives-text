# Hoopsters to harness Huskies
## 
### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
When the 1994 Pacific 10 Con
ference women's basketball season
kicks off tonight with four games
along the West Coast, all eyes
should focus on the ninth-ranked
Cardinal's clash with No. 22 Wash
ington in Seattle. And with good
reason.
In a matchup of two of the con
ference's three ranked squads
(USC is No. 10), Stanford (7-2)
rides a six-game winning streak
into Hec Edmundson Pavilion,
where the host Huskies (8-1) have
won their last seven.
Perhaps even more important
than the momentum both sides
carry into tonight's festivities,
though, is the quality of competi
tion this early on the Pac-10
slate. While the Cardinal has
already battled four ranked foes
and the Huskies three in the
young season, a win or loss
tonight affects the all-important
conference standings and thereby
the possibilities for postseason
tournament seedings.
More pertinently, Stanford,
which is gunning for a sixth-con
secutive Pac-10 crown this season
after enjoying a second-straight
15-3 march through the confer
ence in 1993, knows that there
are no more easy games. Every
opponent, starting with the
Huskies tonight, will raise its
level of play in attempting to end
the Cardinal's rule.
"We'll have to work hard for
every game, but we're excited to
start Pac-10 play," said Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer.
The Cardinal should have 12
healthy bodies ready to start the
Pac-10 wars.
For the fifth straight game,
Stanford should field the follow
ing starting lineup: freshman
Jamila Wideman (5.6 points per
game, 3.8 assists per game) at
point guard, junior Kate Paye
(10.1 ppg, a team-leading 4.7
apg) at shooting guard, junior
Anita Kaplan (a team-leading
16.6 ppg, 8.0 rebounds per game)
at center, junior Rachel Hemmer
(15.3 ppg, a team-high 8.3 rpg) at
power forward, and up-and-com

ing freshman Kate Starbird (9.3
ppg, 3.0 rpg, 2.7 apg) at small for
ward.
Senior point guard Christy
Hedgpeth (8.1 ppg), who last
week became the 16th Stanford
player to tally 1,000 career
points, should rotate in first off
the bench, followed by sophomore
swingman Bobbie Kelsey (10.8
ppg) and freshman forward Tara
Harrington (5.3 ppg).
Four guards — freshman
Charmin Smith, senior Niki Sevil
lian and sophomores Amy Wuste
feld and Amanda Renteria — can
also be called upon if needed.
Stanford and Washington enjoy
a healthy rivalry, with the Cardi
nal holding a 10-8 overall lead in a
series dating back to 1981.
Stanford has won four of the
last five meetings, but the teams
split their two meetings a year
ago, with the Huskies prevailing
73-70 in Seattle and the Cardinal
winning 86-62 at Maples Pavilion.
Washington, known for its
aggressive pressure defense
under coach Chris Gobrecht,
returns three starters to a squad
that finished 17-11 overall (11-7
and third place in the Pac-10) in
1992-93.
Leading the way for the
Huskies should be 6-foot-3
junior forward Rhonda Smith,
who averages 18.9 points a con
test, currently fifth in the con
ference.
Also expected to make a signif
icant contribution to the Wash
ington cause is Tara Davis, a 5-10
senior swingman who cans 40
percent of her three-point shot

attempts — good for sixth place
in the Pac-10.
Tonight's contest, which tips
off at 7:30 p.m. (simultaneous to
the start of the men's game at
Maples), will be broadcast nearly
entirely on KZSU (90.1 FM).
If you are attending the men's
game, bring headphones and
enjoy a doubleheader!

When the 1994 Pacific 10 Con
ference women's basketball season
kicks off tonight with four games
along the West Coast, all eyes
should focus on the ninth-ranked
Cardinal's clash with No. 22 Wash
ington in Seattle. And with good
reason.
In a matchup of two of the con
ference's three ranked squads
(USC is No. 10), Stanford (7-2)
rides a six-game winning streak
into Hec Edmundson Pavilion,
where the host Huskies (8-1) have
won their last seven.
Perhaps even more important
than the momentum both sides
carry into tonight's festivities,
though, is the quality of competi
tion this early on the Pac-10
slate. While the Cardinal has
already battled four ranked foes
and the Huskies three in the
young season, a win or loss
tonight affects the all-important
conference standings and thereby
the possibilities for postseason
tournament seedings.
More pertinently, Stanford,
which is gunning for a sixth-con
secutive Pac-10 crown this season
after enjoying a second-straight
15-3 march through the confer
ence in 1993, knows that there
are no more easy games. Every
opponent, starting with the
Huskies tonight, will raise its
level of play in attempting to end
the Cardinal's rule.
"We'll have to work hard for
every game, but we're excited to
start Pac-10 play," said Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer.
The Cardinal should have 12
healthy bodies ready to start the
Pac-10 wars.
For the fifth straight game,
Stanford should field the follow
ing starting lineup: freshman
Jamila Wideman (5.6 points per
game, 3.8 assists per game) at
point guard, junior Kate Paye
(10.1 ppg, a team-leading 4.7
apg) at shooting guard, junior
Anita Kaplan (a team-leading
16.6 ppg, 8.0 rebounds per game)
at center, junior Rachel Hemmer
(15.3 ppg, a team-high 8.3 rpg) at
power forward, and up-and-com

ing freshman Kate Starbird (9.3
ppg, 3.0 rpg, 2.7 apg) at small for
ward.
Senior point guard Christy
Hedgpeth (8.1 ppg), who last
week became the 16th Stanford
player to tally 1,000 career
points, should rotate in first off
the bench, followed by sophomore
swingman Bobbie Kelsey (10.8
ppg) and freshman forward Tara
Harrington (5.3 ppg).
Four guards — freshman
Charmin Smith, senior Niki Sevil
lian and sophomores Amy Wuste
feld and Amanda Renteria — can
also be called upon if needed.
Stanford and Washington enjoy
a healthy rivalry, with the Cardi
nal holding a 10-8 overall lead in a
series dating back to 1981.
Stanford has won four of the
last five meetings, but the teams
split their two meetings a year
ago, with the Huskies prevailing
73-70 in Seattle and the Cardinal
winning 86-62 at Maples Pavilion.
Washington, known for its
aggressive pressure defense
under coach Chris Gobrecht,
returns three starters to a squad
that finished 17-11 overall (11-7
and third place in the Pac-10) in
1992-93.
Leading the way for the
Huskies should be 6-foot-3
junior forward Rhonda Smith,
who averages 18.9 points a con
test, currently fifth in the con
ference.
Also expected to make a signif
icant contribution to the Wash
ington cause is Tara Davis, a 5-10
senior swingman who cans 40
percent of her three-point shot

attempts — good for sixth place
in the Pac-10.
Tonight's contest, which tips
off at 7:30 p.m. (simultaneous to
the start of the men's game at
Maples), will be broadcast nearly
entirely on KZSU (90.1 FM).
If you are attending the men's
game, bring headphones and
enjoy a doubleheader!
