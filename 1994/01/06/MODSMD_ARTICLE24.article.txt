# A 						sports columnist how-to kit
## It's not whether you win or lose, but how you play the cliche 
### 
Take a good look at this sports
page before we go any further,
because this column will be every
Tom, Dick and Harry's guide to
reading and writing sports articles.
Before you pine away at the
thought of a Sports Writing 101
class, keep in mind that the wide
world of sports revolves only
around overused cliches. They
are a dime a dozen in any publica
tion, peppering the page with
trite sayings and worthless quo
tations, but once you get into the
swing of things, they're not a
hard act to follow.
Even so, a freshman English
teacher wouldn't touch this topic
with a 10-foot pole. In fact, sports
articles wouldn't make the grade,
even if pigs could fly — it's like a
snowball headed for hell.
But in any case, in order to
gain the inside track and take
control of the driver's seat you
must keep the cliches rolling, and
in the long run it will seem like
second nature.
Eor you doubters out there, it
might be interesting to note that
most cliches are not generated by
the writer, but are instead recy
cled among athletes and coaches,
who have developed a sixth sense
when it comes to cliches.
The sky's the limit when it
comes to hearing players talk
about thinking positive, giving
110 percent, fighting tooth and
nail, going whole hog and fighting
'til the bitter end.
Even when the going gets
tough, you're liable to hear how
you win some and you lose some,
wait 'til next year, we've seen bet
ter days, it's a survival of the
fittest and the title is still pretty
much up for grabs . . . food for
thought.
However, sports writers do

pick up the pace and keep the ball
rolling after the players' work is
done.
In football, you have a jour
neyman, a jack of all trades sub
stituting for the starting
linebacker; this man is a heavy
hitter who graduated from the
school of hard knocks and anyone
who tries to stop this beast-of-a
man is a glutton for punishment.

"Give it the old college try and
win one for the Gipper": that's
his motto.
He's worth his weight in gold
with years of experience under
his belt, and when push comes to
shove this behemoth has paid his
dues with blood, sweat and tears.
One of the true unsung heroes of
this game, his "practice makes
perfect" attitude is what sepa
rates the men from the boys.
All you have to do is play it by
ear and once in a long while you
will find a diamond in the rough,
an athlete you can throw your
entire book of cliches at. Take
Michael Jordan, for instance.
For years he has been the
Bulls "go-to" man when the game
comes down to the wire. The ball
is always in his court where he
runs circles around the defense at
a breakneck pace before hot-dog
ging and jazzing up the finale
with a slam to end all slams.
Everyone worships the ground

this man walks on. He is always
the talk of the town and it will
cost any team a pretty penny to
get this creme de la creme athlete.
Now, you can never get too
much of a good thing and when it
comes to cliches, baseball possess
es the Midas touch. The Dodgers'
Orel Hershiser, a bulldog in his
own right, puts on his game face
before letting her rip — blazing a
90-mph fastball right down the
barrel.
Or Ricky Henderson gets
caught red-handed on the basepa
ths, while Barry Bonds races in
from left field to make a shoe
string catch. Smooth as silk,
baseball isn't a rough and tumble
game, all you have to do is roll
with the punches, and you'll
come off smelling like roses.
However, compared to the
three sports just mentioned, an
event such as track can get lost in
the crowd, even though it is the
low man on the totem pole here.
But just the same, a runner has
her ups and downs, but when she
is in her element it's like shooting
fish in a barrel Never say die. She
is determined not be her own
worst enemy, and even if she has
to run on empty before getting a
second wind it will be a neck and
neck race at the finish line.
That's just the tip of the ice
berg.
All told, this article contains
84 cliches thus far. Read my lips,
"It's all in a day's work."
Now for the beginning of the
end. Writing sports stories is not
at all akin to reinventing the
wheel or inventing sliced bread,
instead it's just run of the mill
sayings that you can't leave home
without. Nothing special, ho
hum ... a house of cards propped
up by stats and figures.

thought.
However, sports writers do

pick up the pace and keep the ball
rolling after the players' work is
done.
In football, you have a jour
neyman, a jack of all trades sub
stituting for the starting
linebacker; this man is a heavy
hitter who graduated from the
school of hard knocks and anyone
who tries to stop this beast-of-a
man is a glutton for punishment.

"Give it the old college try and
win one for the Gipper": that's
his motto.
He's worth his weight in gold
with years of experience under
his belt, and when push comes to
shove this behemoth has paid his
dues with blood, sweat and tears.
One of the true unsung heroes of
this game, his "practice makes
perfect" attitude is what sepa
rates the men from the boys.
All you have to do is play it by
ear and once in a long while you
will find a diamond in the rough,
an athlete you can throw your
entire book of cliches at. Take
Michael Jordan, for instance.
For years he has been the
Bulls "go-to" man when the game
comes down to the wire. The ball
is always in his court where he
runs circles around the defense at
a breakneck pace before hot-dog
ging and jazzing up the finale
with a slam to end all slams.
Everyone worships the ground

this man walks on. He is always
the talk of the town and it will
cost any team a pretty penny to
get this creme de la creme athlete.
Now, you can never get too
much of a good thing and when it
comes to cliches, baseball possess
es the Midas touch. The Dodgers'
Orel Hershiser, a bulldog in his
own right, puts on his game face
before letting her rip — blazing a
90-mph fastball right down the
barrel.
Or Ricky Henderson gets
caught red-handed on the basepa
ths, while Barry Bonds races in
from left field to make a shoe
string catch. Smooth as silk,
baseball isn't a rough and tumble
game, all you have to do is roll
with the punches, and you'll
come off smelling like roses.
However, compared to the
three sports just mentioned, an
event such as track can get lost in
the crowd, even though it is the
low man on the totem pole here.
But just the same, a runner has
her ups and downs, but when she
is in her element it's like shooting
fish in a barrel Never say die. She
is determined not be her own
worst enemy, and even if she has
to run on empty before getting a
second wind it will be a neck and
neck race at the finish line.
That's just the tip of the ice
berg.
All told, this article contains
84 cliches thus far. Read my lips,
"It's all in a day's work."
Now for the beginning of the
end. Writing sports stories is not
at all akin to reinventing the
wheel or inventing sliced bread,
instead it's just run of the mill
sayings that you can't leave home
without. Nothing special, ho
hum ... a house of cards propped
up by stats and figures.
