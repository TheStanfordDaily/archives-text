## Team to host Huskies, Cougars 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
With seven wins in five weeks of
play, the Cardinal men's basketball
team has already equaled the total
number of victories it achieved in
all of 1992-93.
Are they for real?
"We feel like we can get into the
upper half (of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence)," said Stanford coach Mike

Montgomery. "I say that cautiously
â€” it's not a lock. I feel we can com
pete for the postseason. We think
we have the personnel to do that."
With raised expectations and a
new spirit, the resurgent Cardinal
(7-2 on the year) gets its first dose
of Pac-10 competition this week
end, hosting Washington and
Washington State at Maples Pavil
ion.
New Huskies coach Bob Bender

has termed 1993-94 "a rebuilding
season" since the beginning of the
year. Washington's results back up
Bender's statement.
The Huskies (2-7) are a com
pletely different squad than the
one that swept Stanford in two
meetings last season. All-Pac-10
center Rich Manning, who scored
38 against the Cardinal last year,
graduated. Pac-10 Freshman of
the Year Mark Pope transferred to
Kentucky. In fact, the current
Washington roster accounted for a
grand total of two points in last
year's matchups with the Cardinal.
Washington State visits Maples
on Saturday, should provide Stan
ford with one of its toughest out
ings of the early season. Road loss
es to Indiana and Fresno State are
the only blemishes the Cougars
(10-2) have suffered thus far.
The Cougars, who play a three
guard offense, return one of the
most experienced backcourt duos
in the league in Eddie Hill and
Tony Harris.
Harris is averaging nearly 19
points in his last five games, while
Hill, a long-range specialist, should
break the Washington State career
three-pointer record this season.
Defense, however, is the
Cougars' forte. After allowing only
65.4 points per game last year to
lead the Pac-10 in scoring defense,
the Cougars top the charts again
this year with an even-stingier 64 .4
points-allowed average.
All of which forecasts a low
scoring game on Saturday. The
Cardinal has held opponents to a
high school-esque .377 shooting

Muscling his way to the basket, point guard Dion Cross will try to push
the Cardinal past Washington and Washington State this weekend.
