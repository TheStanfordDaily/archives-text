# Events planned to boost ethnic centers
## Leaders worried about budget cuts

Fearing drastic budget cuts, student
leaders of campus ethnic centers rallied
last night to plan two events aimed at con
vincing administrators to back off from
threatened reductions.
Hints from administrators that the
four centers might be forced to share of
fice space or consolidate directorships
have leaders worried, according to junior
Myra Parker, the co-chair of the Stanford
American Indian Organization.
"I think our primary fear is that stu
dents have a lot of misconceptions about
the ethnic centers and that carries over to
the administration," Parker said.
Student leaders from SAIO, the Black
Student Union, the Asian-American Stu-

dent Association, MEChA — a
Chicano/Latino student group — and the
ASSU met last night to schedule a "speak
out" for Tuesday at noon in White Plaza
and to plan a forum at 7 p.m. Wednesday
in Cubberley Auditorium.
"In no way are we asking for exemp
tions," said BSU chair Anietie Ekanem.
"We understand there is a budget cri
sis. . . We're just trying to get out some of
the facts about what the ethnic centers
have been doing."
At the same time, Asian-American cen
ter director Rick Yuen said he and the
other directors are working with the ad
ministration to produce formal budget
proposals by Monday. The proposals
should reach Provost Condoleezza Rice by
Jan. 17, he said.
The proposals are part of
Rice's plan, announced last fall,
to slice another $18 million to
$20 million from the University
budget over the next three years.
Administrative areas, including
Student Affairs, could face 15
percent to 30 percent cuts in
their budgets.
Yuen said that "if cuts reach
30 percent, it will mean layoffs.
It's not possible for that
[amount] to come out of paper
clips and pens.
"The phone system and
Xeroxing eats up $3,600 right
there, so literally we save paper
clips" already, Yuen added.
Ekanem said that at a meet
ing with ethnic center heads on
Nov. 30, University President
Gerhard Casper expressed his
support, acknowledging that
"the ethnic centers are running
on a 'bare bones' budget as it is."
But administrators responsi
ble for recommending changes
have not been so quick to say the
centers should be spared the
pain of cutbacks, Parker said.
They "had to deal with the
situation so abruptly," Parker
said, that they haven't been able
to gather the information they
need about how the ethnic cen
ters work.
"The fear is they won't be
able to do that before the Jan. 15
deadline," she added.
So campus leaders have taken
on the job of educating those
who wield the budget ax. At the
"speak-out," alumni and stu
dents plan to emphasize the cen
ters' contributions in an event
including music, food and dance
exhibitions.
Wednesday's forum, titled
"Fulfilling Stanford's Mission:
The Gap Between Rhetoric and
Reality," will be open to the pub
lic and will attempt to "break
some stereotypes and illustrate
what we have been doing,"
Ekanem said.
The battle against budget
cuts will be "very factual" rather
than confrontational, he said.
"We're hoping to ensure that we
will be listened to."
Administrators need to know
what they are cutting, Ekanem
said. "There have been miscon
ceptions about the resources in

the ethnic centers." For exam
ple, he said, some think the
directors handle only parties and
cultural events.
One of the proposals for bud
get cuts was that ethnic centers
might move into the same space,
with communal phone lines and
a single photocopy machine.
"Consolidation of the ethnic cen
ters is not a really good option,"
Ekanem said. "It will negatively
impact the amount of program
ming.
"Sharing a copy machine
seems like a ludicrous idea," he
added, because more than 100
subgroups would have to use it
for every program they plan.
Students also expressed
strong opposition to the sugges
tion that all four centers be
managed by two or three direc
tors — rather than the current
four.
"You can't expect someone of
another ethnicity to know how
to contact (outside organiza
tions] or plan programs for
totally different ethnic groups,"
Parker said.
According to Yuen, about 90
percent of the ethnic centers'
budgets fund staff salaries. The
centers, which currently have
two staff members each, still
have not been brought up to the
standards suggested by the Uni
versity Committee on Minority
Issues report of 1989, which rec
ommended a third staff member
for each center.
The centers are straining to
take care of growing ethnic com
munities and increased responsi
bilities — such as graduate stu
dent recruitment — with bud
gets that have remained the
same for three years, Parker
said.
The directors, who say they
spend a good deal of time on out
side fundraising, talked about
having campus fund-raising
events for programming money
or even to cover everyday operat
ing costs.
After next week's events,
Ekanem said, students hope to
arrange meetings with adminis
trators to get feedback. They are
also asking to be included in
making the final decision.
"We have put this forth to
IDean of Students] Michael
Jackson and Mary Edmonds —
we want to be part of the pro
cess," Ekanem said. "We are
waiting for an answer."
