## Leaders worried about budget cuts

Fearing drastic budget cuts, student
leaders of campus ethnic centers rallied
last night to plan two events aimed at con
vincing administrators to back off from
threatened reductions.
Hints from administrators that the
four centers might be forced to share of
fice space or consolidate directorships
have leaders worried, according to junior
Myra Parker, the co-chair of the Stanford
American Indian Organization.
"I think our primary fear is that stu
dents have a lot of misconceptions about
the ethnic centers and that carries over to
the administration," Parker said.
Student leaders from SAIO, the Black
Student Union, the Asian-American Stu-

dent Association, MEChA — a
Chicano/Latino student group — and the
ASSU met last night to schedule a "speak
out" for Tuesday at noon in White Plaza
and to plan a forum at 7 p.m. Wednesday
in Cubberley Auditorium.
"In no way are we asking for exemp
tions," said BSU chair Anietie Ekanem.
"We understand there is a budget cri
sis. . . We're just trying to get out some of
the facts about what the ethnic centers
have been doing."
At the same time, Asian-American cen
ter director Rick Yuen said he and the
other directors are working with the ad
ministration to produce formal budget
proposals by Monday. The proposals
should reach Provost Condoleezza Rice by
Jan. 17, he said.
