# Some New Year's non-resolutions
## Ed Yoon 
### 
Every year my mom asks me what my
New Year's resolution is, so conse
quently I have none. To engage in
moralistic self-edification simply because the
odometer of time ticks off another digit —
how arbitrary. Might as well resolve to do
something when you get a smog check or go in
for a dental cleaning. And the resolutions!
Lose weight, be more compassionate, stop
starting fires — so pompous and highfalutin'.
In this modern age, with more people
starting to smoke, more people gathering fat
rolls around the middle, more people waving
off exercise, it's time for kinder, gentler reso
lutions. Something that you can conceivably
achieve. Something that isn't all pain with lit
tle discernible gain. Here are a few entertain
ment suggestions for you self-flagellating
Stanford types:
RESOLUTION 1:
Purchase Marky Mark's Home Video
Workout. Yeah, so he has an "attitude prob
lem" toward gays and minorities and displays
some confusion about his self-identity. But
what pec definition! What abdominal stria
tums! Not everybody can lay claim to having
worn Calvins, blown up to thrice normal size,
at every bus shelter in the country. Can you?
The quick-witted Marky rises to the occasion
by describing how to pick weights up and put
them down again, and with his perky, white

boy-who-talks-likes-dis-and-dat narration,
you'll be rapping away your sets and reps and
wearing your cap to the side in no time. A real
hit with the Encina Gym crowd.
RESOLUTION 2:
Attend a Stanford dance performance. "It's
too weird, too modern, I don't get it. What is
it? Why are they squirming like that?" Quit
fretting. The point of modern dance isn't to
get some meaning handed to you like a copy
of Cliffs Notes. You may not like one dance,
but love another, and begin to formulate your
own vision of what dance should be. The free
dom of modern dance allows you and the
dancers to make up the rules. And ethnic
dance allows you to see another culture in
ways that hours of boring lecture cannot. And
since they're about ready to pay people to
watch these things, it's easily the best value in
local entertainment.
RESOLUTION 3:
See a foreign film. No not a film from Britain
or Australia or New Zealand. That doesn't
count. Realize that any theater or distributor

that showcases a foreign film docs so at great fi
nancial risk to itself, even though it charges no
higher price than going to see "Jurassic Park."
Every ticket sold at the box office thus goes a
long way in telling the theater manager and the
distributor whether it's worth bringing quality
foreign films, or whether "Last Action Hero'
and"I lome Alone 2" is all that's needed to keep
the natives happy and vapid. So keep a close eye
out for hidden gems like "Like Water for
Chocolate," "Farewell My Concubine" or "Far
away, So Close." It'll impress your date, too.
RESOLUTION 4:
Buy Howard Stern's "Private Parts" and
quote selectively from it in your CIV section.
While you're discussing some winter quarter
philosopher, let's say Kant, just say, "Kant
knows nothing about moral law! Now,
Howard Stern says in his book, 'Private
Parts.." and watch how your grades will
traverse the alphabet like an Atlas rocket and
gain you instant friends among subhumans.
RESOLUTION 5:
Sec one of those teeny-weeny plays adver

tised by the Stanford Drama Department. So
affordable and so unpredictable. There
couldn't be a better date-related option, could
there? Like the dancers, the drama depart
ment busts its under-recognized butt to put
out quality performances, and it's occasional
ly pleasing that people other than actors'
friends, directors' friends and so on sec them.
Interesting performances abound, and you
don't even need a car.
RESOLUTION 6:
Watch 10 Warren Miller films in a row.
Dorm ski trip time, dude. Huh, you're ready to
carve, right? You don't want to be wedging
down some pip-squeak excuse for an incline,
one barely acquainted with the force of gravi
ty, while the dorm stud is launching into re
verse helicopters and rocketing off Alpine
cliffs. That looks bad. After watching Warren
Miller films your blood will rise to your cheeks,
your hips will ache to drive down some pow
dery white black diamonds, all in slow motion,
lust make sure those bindings are loose, you've
got your "No Fear" ski hat and your Blue Cross
/ Blue Shield card tied around your neck.
RESOLUTION 7:
Sec someone attractive on campus. Ask
them, "Hey, do you want to go see a foreign
film? Or a teeny-weeny play put on by the
Drama Department?" Enjoy. ■

and"I lome Alone 2" is all that's needed to keep
the natives happy and vapid. So keep a close eye
out for hidden gems like "Like Water for
Chocolate," "Farewell My Concubine" or "Far
away, So Close." It'll impress your date, too.
RESOLUTION 4:
Buy Howard Stern's "Private Parts" and
quote selectively from it in your CIV section.
While you're discussing some winter quarter
philosopher, let's say Kant, just say, "Kant
knows nothing about moral law! Now,
Howard Stern says in his book, 'Private
Parts.." and watch how your grades will
traverse the alphabet like an Atlas rocket and
gain you instant friends among subhumans.
RESOLUTION 5:
Sec one of those teeny-weeny plays adver

tised by the Stanford Drama Department. So
affordable and so unpredictable. There
couldn't be a better date-related option, could
there? Like the dancers, the drama depart
ment busts its under-recognized butt to put
out quality performances, and it's occasional
ly pleasing that people other than actors'
friends, directors' friends and so on sec them.
Interesting performances abound, and you
don't even need a car.
RESOLUTION 6:
Watch 10 Warren Miller films in a row.
Dorm ski trip time, dude. Huh, you're ready to
carve, right? You don't want to be wedging
down some pip-squeak excuse for an incline,
one barely acquainted with the force of gravi
ty, while the dorm stud is launching into re
verse helicopters and rocketing off Alpine
cliffs. That looks bad. After watching Warren
Miller films your blood will rise to your cheeks,
your hips will ache to drive down some pow
dery white black diamonds, all in slow motion,
lust make sure those bindings are loose, you've
got your "No Fear" ski hat and your Blue Cross
/ Blue Shield card tied around your neck.
RESOLUTION 7:
Sec someone attractive on campus. Ask
them, "Hey, do you want to go see a foreign
film? Or a teeny-weeny play put on by the
Drama Department?" Enjoy. ■
