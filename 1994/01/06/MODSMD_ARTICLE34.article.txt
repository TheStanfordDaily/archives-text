# THE 						BOO RADLEYS BOLD STEPS TOWARD A POP DREAM
## 
### BY ARNOLD PAN 
"When we had a producer, it was a lack of
confidence. We always knew what we want
ed," Sice explains. "A lot of the time all the
producer was doing was arguing with us, say
ing 'You can't have this, you can't have that.'
"This time, we just thought we could do it
on our own. It made a vast difference, because
we had nobody saying no. We didn't have to
filter our ideas through everybody."
Unlike the band's debut LP "Everything's
Alright Forever," "Giant Steps" was produced
by Boo! Productions. With keyboardist Andy
Wilkinson serving as engineer, the Boo
Radleys proved that they can cut a record
without the help of a hit-making producer.
"We could never have made the albums we
made when we first started without produc
ers," Sice concedes. "But it gets to the stage
where the band knows what it wants, the en
gineer knows how to get it. That's all you need
really. You don't need somebody in between."

Not only did the Boos spare themselves the
trouble of working with a producer, but the
band was also spared the nuisance of an in
trusive record company. Signed in Eng
land to independent Creation Records,
the Boos were given free reign to make the
record. According to Sice, Creation is
probably the only record company which
would have allowed them to make the
kind of record they did.
"Doing a 17-track album is a tall

order and [Creation] just said 'Yeah, if that's
what you want to do, in you go.' They came
down once to have a listen out of interest,
didn't make any comments and went away,
perfectly happy about the album. And that's
really, really good. That shows a lot of faith in
us. In return, the band gives a lot of trust to
the record company."

The band's wide range of influences also ap
pear to be a mirror of pop standards. Elements
from reggae, iazz and rap are as prevalent as
old-fashioned rock chords in song after song. If
anything, the stuff may be too intense to garner
mainstream success. While that's something
Sice realizes, it's nothing he laments.
"To like us, you do have to be a music lover,
because we're not an easy proposition to
grasp. The music takes a lot of listening to and
it's not immediate. We do know that. So we're
prepared to wait a long time."
While they're steadily moving toward that
lofty position, the Boos are still learning the

business side of being an "up-and-com
ing" band by exercising greater control
of the artistic side — music videos
and album cover art — of their pack- (
aging.
In contrast to the freedom given
them by Creation in England, Sice
claims that Columbia, the label the <
Boos signed with State-side, put a lot
more pressure on the band.
"Immediately after the album was fin
ished, (Columbia] wanted us to change
song titles and things like that. They
wanted us to release covers and do
acoustic in-stores. That's not what we
are.
"The thing is about a lot of these big
record companies is that they're so big

that they haven't the personal touch to realize
what a band is about and adapt their market
ing to suit the bind."
However, the complexities of working for a
large corporation hasn't soured the band on
what it's doing. Rather, they hope to flourish
by adjusting Sice explains.
"What we think would be good is if bands

The Boo
Radleys
want to be
pop stars

With two crit
ically acclaimed
albums and a major

label recording contract
here in the States, the band
from Liverpool is moving closer

to that goal while also learning just
how difficult it is to both become and be pop
stars.

"It's only recently that we've learned that
you've got to try to be a pop star. What we ac
tually did was start a band and became good
musicians and recording artists," the Boo
Radleys' down-to-earth and likable vocalist
Sice explains. "We just expected the pop star
bit to happen."
The desire to play music and interest in
pop-star status have stuck with the band
members since the beginning of their careers.
The Boos three founding members — gui
tarist and songwriter Martin Carr, bassist Tim
Brown and Sice — have been friends and
music fans since they were youngsters. Drum
mer Rob Cieka joined the band in 1991.
Listening to the radio got them started in
music.
"Things like the music shows, like 'Top of
the Pops' in England, held our fascination.
And groups also held our fascination at an
early age,'' remembers Sice. "It's like people
seeing footballers and immediately knowing
that's what they want to do. It was just a very
uncognitive thing, a gut feeling, that that's
what we wanted to do and work toward.
That's what we've done ever since."
Yet in today's commercial music world, a
yearning to

play music

and to
create

tuneful, intelligent songs is not
enough. Rather, the band is
learning that image is just as
important as talent in pop

stardom grooming.
"Somebody like
Madonna or Michael
Jackson or Prince must
spend so much time on
the style of things. Those
people are just so good
at what they do, because
they make really good
music and, at the same
time, look at everything
they do. That's what
we'll probably try and
do a bit more of now,"
Sice confides.

The Boos have
coped well with
the rigors of
making music in

the corporate world.
So far, they've never been
forced into doing anything
they haven't wanted to do.
Take the band's lat
est release, "Giant Steps,"
for example. In essence,
they created the ambitious

album with no interference. A
lot of that artistic independence came from
producing the album on their own.

The fruit of this artistic freedom
proves to be one of the most chal
lenging and best albums of 1993.
Both careful calculation by main
songwriter Carr and creative im
provisation by the band's many
contributors make "Giant Steps" re
freshingly unpredictable. For in

stance, Sice explains that the band
places a strong emphasis on varying
sound dynamics.

"We're very much a band that enjoys
change.... We don't like doing the
same thing for too long because we get eas

ily bored," Sice says, adding that change is im
portant "within songs as well. Dynamics and
the change in sound and the piece have always
been pretty important. The pace of the song
should change as you go along. All composi
tion in music is about change."
Input from the band's numerous guest
members proved important in keeping the
music lively as well.
"What facilitated the use of a lot of differ
ent instruments on this album was... that we
had a lot of friends who played instruments
who would come in and record with us.
They'd just do everything. That's why it says
on the back of this album, 'The Boo Radleys
on this album were,' because it wasn't just us
four telling these people what to do. Every
body came in with ideas and everybody was
involved. It was a really good feeling," Sice re
calls.

can
be on
major

labels and be

'corporate rock,'
or whatever you want to call it, and still main
tain artistic integrity. It's not that hard. All the
old bands always maintained artistic control
and sold a hell of a lot of records."
Beyond the tedious details and the corpo
rate concerns, what drives the 800 Radleys is
that passion to play music. The "thrill of play
ing" helps them endure tours through strange
places just as the urge to find "something
new" keeps them excited about recording new
albums. And there's always that fascination in
stardom.
"We always say 'world domination,' that we
want to be big everywhere. But you're never
going to be. No one's ever always going to like
you," admits Sice. More than resignation, this
view shows that the band has acquired a ma
turity which will help it continue to create.
"1 like the idea of being a pop star, but I
don't think 1 could ever do it successfully.
You've got to live a certain way and I'm too
quiet. All that matters when you're in the stu
dio recording it, when you're playing, is what
you think is right. You've got to do what you
want."
The 800 Radleys' education in today's
music world has given the band both a
glimpse at what stardom offers and a new ap
preciation of what they are doing now. In ef
fect, these new challenges have helped the 800
Radleys evaluate what they want to do with
their music.
"You just want more people to get your
records. Like anything, you want to reach
more people," Sice reflects. "It's excellent
when people are singing your words and are
really getting into your music. You go across
the world and you realize you touch some
body that much; it's just natural that you want
to touch more people." ■




"When we had a producer, it was a lack of
confidence. We always knew what we want

With two crit
ically acclaimed
albums and a major

label recording contract
here in the States, the band
from Liverpool is moving closer

to that goal while also learning just
how difficult it is to both become and be pop
stars.

"It's only recently that we've learned that
you've got to try to be a pop star. What we ac
tually did was start a band and became good
musicians and recording artists," the Boo
Radleys' down-to-earth and likable vocalist
Sice explains. "We just expected the pop star
bit to happen."
The desire to play music and interest in
pop-star status have stuck with the band
members since the beginning of their careers.
The Boos three founding members — gui
tarist and songwriter Martin Carr, bassist Tim
Brown and Sice — have been friends and
music fans since they were youngsters. Drum
mer Rob Cieka joined the band in 1991.
Listening to the radio got them started in
music.
"Things like the music shows, like 'Top of
the Pops' in England, held our fascination.
And groups also held our fascination at an
early age,'' remembers Sice. "It's like people
seeing footballers and immediately knowing
that's what they want to do. It was just a very
uncognitive thing, a gut feeling, that that's
what we wanted to do and work toward.
That's what we've done ever since."
Yet in today's commercial music world, a
yearning to

play music

and to
create

tuneful, intelligent songs is not
enough. Rather, the band is
learning that image is just as
important as talent in pop

stardom grooming.
"Somebody like
Madonna or Michael
Jackson or Prince must
spend so much time on
the style of things. Those
people are just so good
at what they do, because
they make really good
music and, at the same
time, look at everything
they do. That's what
we'll probably try and
do a bit more of now,"
Sice confides.

The Boos have
coped well with
the rigors of
making music in

the corporate world.
So far, they've never been
forced into doing anything
they haven't wanted to do.
Take the band's lat
est release, "Giant Steps,"
for example. In essence,
they created the ambitious

album with no interference. A
lot of that artistic independence came from
producing the album on their own.

The fruit of this artistic freedom
proves to be one of the most chal
lenging and best albums of 1993.
Both careful calculation by main
songwriter Carr and creative im
provisation by the band's many
contributors make "Giant Steps" re
freshingly unpredictable. For in

stance, Sice explains that the band
places a strong emphasis on varying
sound dynamics.

"We're very much a band that enjoys
change.... We don't like doing the
same thing for too long because we get eas

ily bored," Sice says, adding that change is im
portant "within songs as well. Dynamics and
the change in sound and the piece have always
been pretty important. The pace of the song
should change as you go along. All composi
tion in music is about change."
Input from the band's numerous guest
members proved important in keeping the
music lively as well.
"What facilitated the use of a lot of differ
ent instruments on this album was... that we
had a lot of friends who played instruments
who would come in and record with us.
They'd just do everything. That's why it says
on the back of this album, 'The Boo Radleys
on this album were,' because it wasn't just us
four telling these people what to do. Every
body came in with ideas and everybody was
involved. It was a really good feeling," Sice re
calls.

can
be on
major

labels and be

'corporate rock,'
or whatever you want to call it, and still main
tain artistic integrity. It's not that hard. All the
old bands always maintained artistic control
and sold a hell of a lot of records."
Beyond the tedious details and the corpo
rate concerns, what drives the 800 Radleys is
that passion to play music. The "thrill of play
ing" helps them endure tours through strange
places just as the urge to find "something
new" keeps them excited about recording new
albums. And there's always that fascination in
stardom.
"We always say 'world domination,' that we
want to be big everywhere. But you're never
going to be. No one's ever always going to like
you," admits Sice. More than resignation, this
view shows that the band has acquired a ma
turity which will help it continue to create.
"1 like the idea of being a pop star, but I
don't think 1 could ever do it successfully.
You've got to live a certain way and I'm too
quiet. All that matters when you're in the stu
dio recording it, when you're playing, is what
you think is right. You've got to do what you
want."
The 800 Radleys' education in today's
music world has given the band both a
glimpse at what stardom offers and a new ap
preciation of what they are doing now. In ef
fect, these new challenges have helped the 800
Radleys evaluate what they want to do with
their music.
"You just want more people to get your
records. Like anything, you want to reach
more people," Sice reflects. "It's excellent
when people are singing your words and are
really getting into your music. You go across
the world and you realize you touch some
body that much; it's just natural that you want
to touch more people." ■




"When we had a producer, it was a lack of
confidence. We always knew what we want
ed," Sice explains. "A lot of the time all the
producer was doing was arguing with us, say
ing 'You can't have this, you can't have that.'
"This time, we just thought we could do it
on our own. It made a vast difference, because
we had nobody saying no. We didn't have to
filter our ideas through everybody."
Unlike the band's debut LP "Everything's
Alright Forever," "Giant Steps" was produced
by Boo! Productions. With keyboardist Andy
Wilkinson serving as engineer, the Boo
Radleys proved that they can cut a record
without the help of a hit-making producer.
"We could never have made the albums we
made when we first started without produc
ers," Sice concedes. "But it gets to the stage
where the band knows what it wants, the en
gineer knows how to get it. That's all you need
really. You don't need somebody in between."

Not only did the Boos spare themselves the
trouble of working with a producer, but the
band was also spared the nuisance of an in
trusive record company. Signed in Eng
land to independent Creation Records,
the Boos were given free reign to make the
record. According to Sice, Creation is
probably the only record company which
would have allowed them to make the
kind of record they did.
"Doing a 17-track album is a tall

order and [Creation] just said 'Yeah, if that's
what you want to do, in you go.' They came
down once to have a listen out of interest,
didn't make any comments and went away,
perfectly happy about the album. And that's
really, really good. That shows a lot of faith in
us. In return, the band gives a lot of trust to
the record company."

The band's wide range of influences also ap
pear to be a mirror of pop standards. Elements
from reggae, iazz and rap are as prevalent as
old-fashioned rock chords in song after song. If
anything, the stuff may be too intense to garner
mainstream success. While that's something
Sice realizes, it's nothing he laments.
"To like us, you do have to be a music lover,
because we're not an easy proposition to
grasp. The music takes a lot of listening to and
it's not immediate. We do know that. So we're
prepared to wait a long time."
While they're steadily moving toward that
lofty position, the Boos are still learning the

business side of being an "up-and-com
ing" band by exercising greater control
of the artistic side — music videos
and album cover art — of their pack- (
aging.
In contrast to the freedom given
them by Creation in England, Sice
claims that Columbia, the label the <
Boos signed with State-side, put a lot
more pressure on the band.
"Immediately after the album was fin
ished, (Columbia] wanted us to change
song titles and things like that. They
wanted us to release covers and do
acoustic in-stores. That's not what we
are.
"The thing is about a lot of these big
record companies is that they're so big

that they haven't the personal touch to realize
what a band is about and adapt their market
ing to suit the bind."
However, the complexities of working for a
large corporation hasn't soured the band on
what it's doing. Rather, they hope to flourish
by adjusting Sice explains.

or whatever you want to call it, and still main
tain artistic integrity. It's not that hard. All the
old bands always maintained artistic control
and sold a hell of a lot of records."
Beyond the tedious details and the corpo
rate concerns, what drives the 800 Radleys is
that passion to play music. The "thrill of play
ing" helps them endure tours through strange
places just as the urge to find "something
new" keeps them excited about recording new
albums. And there's always that fascination in
stardom.
"We always say 'world domination,' that we
want to be big everywhere. But you're never
going to be. No one's ever always going to like
you," admits Sice. More than resignation, this
view shows that the band has acquired a ma
turity which will help it continue to create.
"1 like the idea of being a pop star, but I
don't think 1 could ever do it successfully.
You've got to live a certain way and I'm too
quiet. All that matters when you're in the stu
dio recording it, when you're playing, is what
you think is right. You've got to do what you
want."
The 800 Radleys' education in today's
music world has given the band both a
glimpse at what stardom offers and a new ap
preciation of what they are doing now. In ef
fect, these new challenges have helped the 800
Radleys evaluate what they want to do with
their music.
"You just want more people to get your
records. Like anything, you want to reach
more people," Sice reflects. "It's excellent
when people are singing your words and are
really getting into your music. You go across
the world and you realize you touch some
body that much; it's just natural that you want
to touch more people." ■
