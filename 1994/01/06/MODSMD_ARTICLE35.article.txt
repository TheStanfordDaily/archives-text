# D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus and the puppeteers of Clinton's 'War Room'
## THE 						RIGHT STRINGS 
### Anne Flatté 
How do you get elected president of the
United States? Take one Bill Clinton,
add Hillary, toss in campaign wizards
James Carville and George Stephanopolous,
throw them all into the frying pan of an
American election, serve it up to the people,
and spice with a healthy dash of nail-biting.
How do you make a feature film about
such a campaign? Pick the right candidate to
film, raise some money, enlist a legendary
documentary filmmaker and his team to film
it, hope the candidate you picked wins, raise
some more money, have your candidate actu
ally win, and laugh all the way to the bank.
Right? Not exactly.
Documentary filmmakers D.A. Pennebak
er and Chris Hegedus learned that lesson the
hard way while filming "The War Room" —
an inside look at Clinton's problematic but
ultimately successful drive for the presidency.
In retrospect, Pennebaker admits that "we all
believed in our hearts that if the campaign was
as interesting as it seemed to us, we could raise
some kind of money to get us through it, and at
the end, if he won, all these wonderful public
fundings would come flying to us because we
would have done this wonderful thing. We
couldn't, and that was a big shock for us."
Actually, tht duo wasn't initially thrilled
about the idea of a presidential campaign
documentary. The idea and initial funding
for the project came from two first-time film
producers: Wendy Ettinger, a casting director,
and R.J. Cutler, a director and producer in
theater and radio. Both were committed to
the idea of capturing the mechanisms of one
of the 1992 campaigns on film, but neither
had undertaken such a project before, so they
went to someone who had.
Pennebaker, a pioneer of the "direct cine
ma" movement in the United States, had
helped introduce the observational, you-are
there style of documentary in the 1960s with
such films as "Primary," a film about the
Humphrey-Kennedy contest in the 1960 De
mocratic primaries, and "Crisis," about the
standoff between Alabama Governor George
Wallace and President Kennedy over the de
segregation of the University of Alabama.
Since then he mewed away from strictly polit
ical subjects for his numerous documen
taries, which include "Don't Look Back," fea
turing Bob Dylan.
In 1977, Pennebaker teamed up with cam
eraperson / soundperson Chris Hegedus
(who married him in 1982), to make "The
Energy War," a five-hour PBS production on
President Carter's battle with Congress to
deregulate natural gas.
But because " The Energy War" had been a
critical success but a financial flop, Pennebak
er and Hegedus were hesitant to collaborate on
Cutler and Ettinger's project. But in the end,
the novices' enthusiasm won the veterans over.
The only remaining question: Who exact
ly were they going to film?
During the month before the Democratic
National Convention, Cutler made 75 calls a
day trying to get access to Clinton. I'he Fri

day before it began, director of communica
tions Stephanopolous finally called and told
Cutler that the filmmakers could not be
granted access to Clinton. However, at Cut
ler's request, Pennebaker and Hegedus were
allowed into the "war room" — the nerve
center of the campaign, a room where the de
cision makers congregated and the key "han
dling" decisions were made.
Once inside the war room, it quickly be
came obvious who the true stars of the film
would be. "When you see (campaign strate
gist) Carville at work," says Pennebaker,
"you're just drawn to him like flies to meat. He
captures the camera right away. George does
too. He has that kind of quiet authoritative
way — he's really calling the shots. But he
would never admit it and most people aren't
even aware of it."
During that week, the filmmakers shot
only 60 minutes of film each day. "What
you're hoping for is something that you don't
even have to edit," explains Pennebaker. "It
has a start, something builds up, you find out
something, and then someone makes an
ender to it. A joke or something, and that's
perfect. Everyone knows what that looks like
because everyone goes to movies. But we're
trying to get real life to imitate art."
Hegedus concedes that it isn't always easy
being a fly on the wall. "You have to use all
your senses and watch every time someone
walks into the room and just take a guess. But
there's plenty of times when you're just sitting

there thinking, 'What are we doing here? This
all seems so boring.' And you just start shoot
ing just for something to do. And you get back
and you think, great, there goes a hundred
and fifty dollars."
After viewing the convention footage, the
team realized that they didn't yet have enough
material for a film, and a decision had to be
made. The choice, says Hegedus, was obvious:
"Either you say, 'Sorry Wendy, we just spent
20,000 dollars of your money and we don't
have a movie,' or you figure out what you're
going to do next. So we decided we'd go to Lit
tle Rock and hang out in the war room there."
With the help of a second crew, they acquired
a total of 33 hours of footage. To complete the
storyline, Hegedus added earlier footage of
the New Hampshire primary shot by film
makers Kevin Rafferty and James Ridgeway,
as well as archival footage.
The result is a candid look at a savvy and
groundbreaking presidential campaign, in
cluding scenes showing the Gennifer Flowers
debacle, Carville and Stephanopolous putting
together advertising spots as well as attempts
by the campaign to leak damaging stories
about President Bush to the press, all pep
pered with Carville's colorful observations on
a variety of subjects, including the Perot cam
paign — "The single most expensive act of
masturbation in the history of the world."
Comparing the filming of "The War
Room" with his 1960 campaign documentary
"Primary" provided Pennebaker with an op

portunity to reflect on how the campaign
process has changed.
"With Kennedy, there was no concept of a
24-hour news response. There were only two
editions of a paper a day, and that's all they
looked at so they had a little time to put it to
gether." With Clinton's campaign, "They had a
24-hour day. They had to be ready to issue some
kind of a reaction on a moment's notice at any
time, so the war room was open all the time."
The film also provides a rare insight into
American political culture. When it showed at
an international film festival, says Hegedus,
"the Europeans couldn't believe that the hier
archical structure of the campaign was so in
formal. ... That would just never happen in
those countries, and they were fascinated by it."
In this country, says Hegedus, "one of the
hardest parts is people getting over the stigma
of documentary being some kind of tortuous
informative exercise that people have to
watch. What I really wanted to show was how
this campaign was an enormously fun adven
ture for people."
Both filmmakers admit to being frustrated
regarding the difficulties they face as indepen
dents in a world dominated by network and
cable news, but believe that "The War Room" is
an important contribution to history that could
never come out of traditional news coverage.
According to Hegedus, a perfect example of
how networks often manipulate the news was
demonstrated in a recently televised collection
of "60 Minutes" outtakes, including footage of
Bill and Hillary Clinton's famous interview
following the Flowers debacle.
Says Hegedus, "In the middle of their inter
view one of the huge lights fell down onto the
couch and practically killed them. So they
jumped up and hugged each other and were
very upset about it, and this was edited out. It
was incredible because if anyone had any
doubt that these two people had a relation
ship, it would have been totally dispelled at
that moment because of their whole body lan
guage and the way that they instantaneously
reacted to each other — which is really what
our films show. They left it out of the piece be
cause they wanted it to be ambivalent."
"Network news," continues Pennebaker,
takes "refuge in a holdover of newspaperdom
of the '205," and doesn't consider what the
filmmakers do to be "serious journalism."
"For instance, we've probably violated the
most sacrosanct law of journalism by allow
ing the two protagonists to look at the film be
fore we released it,"he explains. "We didn't
say, we'll show it to you and you can re-edit or
change anything you don't like. Our under
standing was that if we'd made a mistake in
there, they would call our attention to it. Well,
we showed it to them, they both liked it —
they said 'it's wonderful, don't change it' —
and that was the end of it. But a network
would say, 'That's terrible. That's awful. We
don't want you on our air.' "
In the end, Hegedus confesses, "I feel like we
made it by the skin of our teeth" Even for the
legends, documentaries are still a struggle. ■

"you're just drawn to him like flies to meat. He
captures the camera right away. George does
too. He has that kind of quiet authoritative
way — he's really calling the shots. But he
would never admit it and most people aren't
even aware of it."
During that week, the filmmakers shot
only 60 minutes of film each day. "What
you're hoping for is something that you don't
even have to edit," explains Pennebaker. "It
has a start, something builds up, you find out
something, and then someone makes an
ender to it. A joke or something, and that's
perfect. Everyone knows what that looks like
because everyone goes to movies. But we're
trying to get real life to imitate art."
Hegedus concedes that it isn't always easy
being a fly on the wall. "You have to use all
your senses and watch every time someone
walks into the room and just take a guess. But
there's plenty of times when you're just sitting

there thinking, 'What are we doing here? This
all seems so boring.' And you just start shoot
ing just for something to do. And you get back
and you think, great, there goes a hundred
and fifty dollars."
After viewing the convention footage, the
team realized that they didn't yet have enough
material for a film, and a decision had to be
made. The choice, says Hegedus, was obvious:
"Either you say, 'Sorry Wendy, we just spent
20,000 dollars of your money and we don't
have a movie,' or you figure out what you're
going to do next. So we decided we'd go to Lit
tle Rock and hang out in the war room there."
With the help of a second crew, they acquired
a total of 33 hours of footage. To complete the
storyline, Hegedus added earlier footage of
the New Hampshire primary shot by film
makers Kevin Rafferty and James Ridgeway,
as well as archival footage.
The result is a candid look at a savvy and
groundbreaking presidential campaign, in
cluding scenes showing the Gennifer Flowers
debacle, Carville and Stephanopolous putting
together advertising spots as well as attempts
by the campaign to leak damaging stories
about President Bush to the press, all pep
pered with Carville's colorful observations on
a variety of subjects, including the Perot cam
paign — "The single most expensive act of
masturbation in the history of the world."
Comparing the filming of "The War
Room" with his 1960 campaign documentary
"Primary" provided Pennebaker with an op

portunity to reflect on how the campaign
process has changed.
"With Kennedy, there was no concept of a
24-hour news response. There were only two
editions of a paper a day, and that's all they
looked at so they had a little time to put it to
gether." With Clinton's campaign, "They had a
24-hour day. They had to be ready to issue some
kind of a reaction on a moment's notice at any
time, so the war room was open all the time."
The film also provides a rare insight into
American political culture. When it showed at
an international film festival, says Hegedus,
"the Europeans couldn't believe that the hier
archical structure of the campaign was so in
formal. ... That would just never happen in
those countries, and they were fascinated by it."
In this country, says Hegedus, "one of the
hardest parts is people getting over the stigma
of documentary being some kind of tortuous
informative exercise that people have to
watch. What I really wanted to show was how
this campaign was an enormously fun adven
ture for people."
Both filmmakers admit to being frustrated
regarding the difficulties they face as indepen
dents in a world dominated by network and
cable news, but believe that "The War Room" is
an important contribution to history that could
never come out of traditional news coverage.
According to Hegedus, a perfect example of
how networks often manipulate the news was
demonstrated in a recently televised collection
of "60 Minutes" outtakes, including footage of
Bill and Hillary Clinton's famous interview
following the Flowers debacle.
Says Hegedus, "In the middle of their inter
view one of the huge lights fell down onto the
couch and practically killed them. So they
jumped up and hugged each other and were
very upset about it, and this was edited out. It
was incredible because if anyone had any
doubt that these two people had a relation
ship, it would have been totally dispelled at
that moment because of their whole body lan
guage and the way that they instantaneously
reacted to each other — which is really what
our films show. They left it out of the piece be
cause they wanted it to be ambivalent."
"Network news," continues Pennebaker,
takes "refuge in a holdover of newspaperdom
of the '205," and doesn't consider what the
filmmakers do to be "serious journalism."
"For instance, we've probably violated the
most sacrosanct law of journalism by allow
ing the two protagonists to look at the film be
fore we released it,"he explains. "We didn't
say, we'll show it to you and you can re-edit or
change anything you don't like. Our under
standing was that if we'd made a mistake in
there, they would call our attention to it. Well,
we showed it to them, they both liked it —
they said 'it's wonderful, don't change it' —
and that was the end of it. But a network
would say, 'That's terrible. That's awful. We
don't want you on our air.' "
In the end, Hegedus confesses, "I feel like we
made it by the skin of our teeth" Even for the
legends, documentaries are still a struggle. ■

How do you get elected president of the
United States? Take one Bill Clinton,
add Hillary, toss in campaign wizards
James Carville and George Stephanopolous,
throw them all into the frying pan of an
American election, serve it up to the people,
and spice with a healthy dash of nail-biting.
How do you make a feature film about
such a campaign? Pick the right candidate to
film, raise some money, enlist a legendary
documentary filmmaker and his team to film
it, hope the candidate you picked wins, raise
some more money, have your candidate actu
ally win, and laugh all the way to the bank.
Right? Not exactly.
Documentary filmmakers D.A. Pennebak
er and Chris Hegedus learned that lesson the
hard way while filming "The War Room" —
an inside look at Clinton's problematic but
ultimately successful drive for the presidency.
In retrospect, Pennebaker admits that "we all
believed in our hearts that if the campaign was
as interesting as it seemed to us, we could raise
some kind of money to get us through it, and at
the end, if he won, all these wonderful public
fundings would come flying to us because we
would have done this wonderful thing. We
couldn't, and that was a big shock for us."
Actually, tht duo wasn't initially thrilled
about the idea of a presidential campaign
documentary. The idea and initial funding
for the project came from two first-time film
producers: Wendy Ettinger, a casting director,
and R.J. Cutler, a director and producer in
theater and radio. Both were committed to
the idea of capturing the mechanisms of one
of the 1992 campaigns on film, but neither
had undertaken such a project before, so they
went to someone who had.
Pennebaker, a pioneer of the "direct cine
ma" movement in the United States, had
helped introduce the observational, you-are
there style of documentary in the 1960s with
such films as "Primary," a film about the
Humphrey-Kennedy contest in the 1960 De
mocratic primaries, and "Crisis," about the
standoff between Alabama Governor George
Wallace and President Kennedy over the de
segregation of the University of Alabama.
Since then he mewed away from strictly polit
ical subjects for his numerous documen
taries, which include "Don't Look Back," fea
turing Bob Dylan.
In 1977, Pennebaker teamed up with cam
eraperson / soundperson Chris Hegedus
(who married him in 1982), to make "The
Energy War," a five-hour PBS production on
President Carter's battle with Congress to
deregulate natural gas.
But because " The Energy War" had been a
critical success but a financial flop, Pennebak
er and Hegedus were hesitant to collaborate on
Cutler and Ettinger's project. But in the end,
the novices' enthusiasm won the veterans over.
The only remaining question: Who exact
ly were they going to film?
During the month before the Democratic
National Convention, Cutler made 75 calls a
day trying to get access to Clinton. I'he Fri

day before it began, director of communica
tions Stephanopolous finally called and told
Cutler that the filmmakers could not be
granted access to Clinton. However, at Cut
ler's request, Pennebaker and Hegedus were
allowed into the "war room" — the nerve
center of the campaign, a room where the de
cision makers congregated and the key "han
dling" decisions were made.
Once inside the war room, it quickly be
came obvious who the true stars of the film
would be. "When you see (campaign strate
gist) Carville at work," says Pennebaker,
"you're just drawn to him like flies to meat. He
captures the camera right away. George does
too. He has that kind of quiet authoritative
way — he's really calling the shots. But he
would never admit it and most people aren't

cable news, but believe that "The War Room" is
an important contribution to history that could
never come out of traditional news coverage.
According to Hegedus, a perfect example of
how networks often manipulate the news was
demonstrated in a recently televised collection
of "60 Minutes" outtakes, including footage of
Bill and Hillary Clinton's famous interview
following the Flowers debacle.
Says Hegedus, "In the middle of their inter
view one of the huge lights fell down onto the
couch and practically killed them. So they
jumped up and hugged each other and were
very upset about it, and this was edited out. It
was incredible because if anyone had any
doubt that these two people had a relation
ship, it would have been totally dispelled at
that moment because of their whole body lan
guage and the way that they instantaneously
reacted to each other — which is really what
our films show. They left it out of the piece be
cause they wanted it to be ambivalent."
"Network news," continues Pennebaker,
takes "refuge in a holdover of newspaperdom
of the '205," and doesn't consider what the
filmmakers do to be "serious journalism."
"For instance, we've probably violated the
most sacrosanct law of journalism by allow
ing the two protagonists to look at the film be
fore we released it,"he explains. "We didn't
say, we'll show it to you and you can re-edit or
change anything you don't like. Our under
standing was that if we'd made a mistake in
there, they would call our attention to it. Well,
we showed it to them, they both liked it —
they said 'it's wonderful, don't change it' —
and that was the end of it. But a network
would say, 'That's terrible. That's awful. We
don't want you on our air.' "
In the end, Hegedus confesses, "I feel like we
made it by the skin of our teeth" Even for the
legends, documentaries are still a struggle. ■
