## Dr. Loco's Rockin' Jalapeño Band and the Chicano World Beat Experience Story by Angie Chuang, Photos by Burt Herman 
### 
It's Saturday night at IJ's Blues Down
town in San Jose and men in blue jeans
and snakeskin boots are eyeing women
extravagantly coifed in silver lame from
across the bar. In the background, a sultry
Latin ditty sets the tone for an evening of ro
mantic overtures.
But closer to the stage, the crowd's vibe
feels completely different. Their dress is less
flashy and their listening approach to music
far more hands-on. And as the sea of black
clad fans sway to the sounds of Dr. Loco's
Rockin' Jalapeno Band, more people hit the
dance floor.
The audience up front — their allegiance
pledged to the red-and-green chile pepper
logo on their shirts and baseball caps — are
not only tuned in to the band's unique
masala of rancheras, reggae, jazz and even
country, but also the messages behind spicy
mix.
Dr. Loco (a.k.a. Jose Cuellar), a former
Stanford professor, croons "Las Revolu
cionarias," backed by eight musicians, three
of whom are Stanford alumni. To the blue
jean / lame set, the song is a playful sere
nade, but the diehard fans realize the song's
political significance — it's dedicated to
"mestizas," or women of mixed Chicana
heritage, who have not always been recog
nized as full-fledged members of their com
munity.
Chicana, she's chicana / es mestiza
orgullosa (she is a proud 'mestiza') / and
she's down with the movimiento (move
ment) / some label her Hispanic / but she's
not one to panic," Cuellar sings, his vocals a
reflection of the band's high-spirited, easily
accessible way of kicking politics.
Like much of the band's music, the song

sets an almost-incongruous contrast be
tween upbeat rhythms and distinctly politi
cal messages of racial pride and unity. The
topics range from immigration to laborers'
rights to Martin Luther King, but the medi
um always remains danceable.
And the swaying, bouncing crowd, intox
icated by the music and their intense loyalty
to the band, attests to this. To a staring
passersby, however, a lone dancing, whoop
ing and singing woman with a mixed drink
appears to have found a more conventional
means of inebriation. Taking the only
standing room available near the stage, 1
find myself next to the woman, who intro
duces herself as "Lucia." 1 soon realize she,
though slightly tipsy, is mostly just plain eu
phoric.
Lucia explains that she and a group of
friends — diehard Jalapeno fans — Hew up
from the Southern California suburbs, leav
ing behind teenage children, work and wor
ries to watch the band play. They had just
seen the band several times down South,
and "followed them up" to the Bay Area.
"I saw the band years ago at one of their
first public appearances at Plaza de la Raza,
in San Francisco — I ve been hooked ever
since,' she says still dancing. "I try to see as
many performances as I can now."
1 love this music!" she yells to no one in
particular, temporarily transported into her
own world. She quickly snaps back to reali
ty and tells me, "One thing that makes Dr.
Loco and his band special to me is their
commitment to youth, she says, referring
to their many performances and lectures at
various colleges and universities. "It's so im
portant to grow up with music in your life."
Lucias attention shifts away from me as

she begins to sway in time to "By the Banks
of the Rio Grande," the band's rendition of
the Melodians' reggae classic "By the Rivers
of Babylon." The sensual Latin beats show
only traces of the song's African influence,
yet the music's connection to reggae is clear.
Most of the band's repertoire consists of re
interpretations ot famliar Chicano, Ameri
can or African-American music.

Couples embrace and sway in time to
the band's impressive ensemble of in
struments — saxophones, brass, guitar,
bass, keyboard, even accordion — that
look more like a jazz band than an ethnic
music group. Lucia points out to me that
the ever-grooving Cuellar — in his
trademark dark glasses and braided
beard — has changed shirts because the
first one was soaked with sweat. "He al
ways does that," she says fondly.
As the band takes a break between
sets, Lucia speaks with enthusiasm
about its music. The music is "Chicano,
it's revolutionary anthems, it's funk, it's
fusion, it's blues, classical — it's any
thing you want it to be," she says hearti
ly. "But it's great!"
Classical?
Maybe not, but Lucia accurately rep
resents the band members' resistance to
standard musical categorization because
of their international smorgasbord of
influences.
The categorization conundrum is
precisely the topic of discussion
one week later, as the band re
hearses before a show at Alberto's in
Mountain View.

In contrast to their larger-than-life aura
on stage at J J s, the band is mellow, down
to-earth in the smaller, more familiar venue
— Alberto's was one of the first places the
band played a tew years ago, while some of
its members were still attending Stanford.
Fresh from a practice / jam session on the
Spin Doctors' "Two Princes," a few band
members sit down with me and attempt to
describe the Jalapeno sound. The descrip
tions become more and more complicated
with each successive explanation.
"Chicano world-beat music," key
boardist/accordionist Jesus Coverrubias
says with certainty.
Guitarist and Stanford alum Chris Gon
zalez (Jarke adds that the music "represents
all the different styles musicians play in the
U.S."
"Geographically, Northern California
and Texas are big influences," says Gonzalez
Clarke, also the assistant director of El Cen
tra Chicano. "Any one little part of us you
can find in a different (ethnic and geo
graphical) group."

Compelled to further flesh out the expla
nation, bassist and fellow Stanford alum
Carlos "Charlie" Montoya says, "It's eclec
tic. We incorporate the Chicano influence
with our American roots, reflected in rock
and blues, into the music."
The dual components of the Chicano ex
perience are also reflected in the band's

characteristic use of "Spanglish," a blending
of Spanish and English, which Cuellar
shows mastery over in songs like "Mexi
canamericanos."
I'or our mothers somos (weare) Mexican /
... comprendemos (we understand) el English
/.. .we're bilingues (bilinguals) to the bone. "
Montoya explains, Spanglish "is signifi
cant to all of us because that's the way we
grew up communicating with our families
at home. That's definitely where | the use of
it in the music] came from."
The conversation soon falls away from
music and drifts toward Stanford
memories as Gonzalez Clarke and
Montoya remember living in Casa Zapata.
Gonzalez Clarke and Montoya's Stanford
days hold special significance because they
also marked the beginnings of Dr. Loco's
Rockin lalapeno Hand, when Cuellar, then a
visiting professor at the University, started
bringing together band members.
Before Dr. Loco's Rockin' Jalapeno Band,
Gonzalez Clarke and Montoya had formed
their own band and played some gigs on

ampus. "You know, the campus band thing,
tuh a part of the college experience," Mon
oya says.
So where did you play? At frat parties?
Oli no, no, no. Nothing like that," Montoya
ays, laughing. "Mostly at Zapata parties. It
vas great."
"So is Stanford pretty much the same

right now? he asks. "I mean, the dorms and
everything?"
Pretty much. Oh, they remodeled Wilbur.
"Wilbur? What did they do to Wilbur.?"
It's pastel now.
"Pastel? Wilbur is pastel?" Montoya says,
shaking his head as Gonzalez Clarke laughs.
"I can't believe they made Wilbur pastel.
Is nothing sacred anymore?"
Stern — and Zapata — are still the same
though.
"What a relief," Montoya says, still shak
ing his head.
Finally, 1 catch up with the man himself,
"Doctor Loco" Cuellar, taking a coffee
break with some band members in the
back parking lot of Alberto's. Standing amid
garbage bins and pickup trucks, he describes
the origins of the group.
True to Cuellar's academic roots — he is
now chair of La Raza Studies, the Chicano
studies department at San Francisco State-
University — one of his classroom lectures
at Stanford in sparked the concept of
the band.
The music we play emerged out of what
the Chicano experience is, which I put to
gether in a lecture on Chicano music from

the 2()s to the '905," says Cuellar, saxophon
ist, vocalist and director for the band. In the
process of compiling material for the lecture,
he rediscovered some ot his musical inspira
tions and fellow musicians in a broader cul
tural context.
I he two things I focused on were diver
sity and the transformation of the rhythms

and styles from other cultures, especial
ly Caribbean and Afro-American," he
says, pointing to Carlos Santana's draw
ing directly from African music. "It
didn't start with us, and we reflect that
in our music, by incorporating the ele
ments out there. It's about crossing
boundaries and borders."
These ideas particularly hit home
tor Cuellar because he had been away
from serious singing and playing the
saxophone for eight years, and had been
trying to tind an outlet to return to his
pursuit of music. "I had been hanging
out backstage with the guys from Los
Lobos, who are friends of mine, playing
a little music and trying to show off," he
says. "They kept telling me I should re
ally get out there and just play."
And so he did. Cuellar sought out
members ot the Stanford community to
help pursue his vision.
"At Stanford there was so much tal
ent around," and all he had to do was
bring it all together, he says. Eventually,
the eight band members came together
from Stanford, IJC-Berkeley and other
colleges.
Although the band has earned quite

a name for itself within and outside of
the Bay Area, all band members hold "day"
jobs, many as educators. Covarrubias ex
plains that "it's tough" to balance all of the
weekly rehearsals and gigs with steady em
ployment.
Judging from the band's press, it seems it
has, willingly or not, established its rep
utation as a politically charged,
message-based group. The headlines
read, "The mad doctor and his Rockin'
Jalapeno Band arc on the move — musically
and politically" (San Jose Mercury News),
"Dr. Loco and his music won't let the move
ment die" (The Albuquerque Tribune) and
"Dr. Loco band members flavor their music
with message of non-violence" (Daily Cali
fornian).
I iowever, Cuellar downplays the accuracy
and significance of the band's "leftist" repu
tation. "I like to call it progressivism," he
says. "We promote peace, non-violence,
bringing people together, multiculturalism
and non-racism."
Cuellar points to the band's diverse audi
ences and venues — including the San Fran
cisco Black and White Ball, Berkeley's La
Pen a Cultural Center and Justice for Janitor
Rallies — as evidence that their music does

speak to everyone.
"I think the music leaves people with a
good feeling," he says."It celebrates culture,
celebrates who we all are."
Furthermore, Cuellar attributes the
politicization of the band to the press, rather
than its audiences or the music itself. "The
issue of politics is placed in the context of the
whole spectrum," he says somewhat enig
matically. "It's an issue for every performer,
especially ethnic performers."
So while the media raises the issue of the
band's agenda, Cuellar says he believes the
audiences just "love the music, trip on the
songs and enjoy it all." Personally, he "enjoys
that more than anything else."
Nevertheless, Cuellar does not begrudge
those that do find messages in the medium.
"Folks do raise many of the issues," he says.
"That's cool. That's what we do in academia."
Despite Cuellar's de-emphasis of the
band's political convictions, one can hardly
conclude from the lyrics of songs like "El
Picket Sign" that the joy of the music entire
ly precludes the urgency of the message:
"Some people that 1 know / still eat contam
inated grapes / ... government pesticides /
that poison farm-worker children."
Right before the band is about to go on
stage, Ricardo, the assistant manager
of Alberto's, tells me about the good
old days when the band was just starting out
and all the members' friends would come
out from Stanford to see them.
Ricardo interrupts his reminiscing and
quietly directs my attention to the band
members, who are now standing backstage
in a circle, arms around each other. "This is
a ritual, a prayer. They do it before every
show," he whispers.
Cuellar gives the brief invocation in
hushed tones and the solemn moment con
cludes with a collective shouting of,
"lalapeno .. . power!" as the band heads for
the stage.
Inside the club, audience members have
jam-packed every last square inch and the
dance floor moves like one collective organ
ism. I bump into 1992 Stanford graduate
Anita De Lucio as she exits the dance floor,
exuberant.
She motions toward Montoya on stage.
"Charlie was my freshman year I resident as

sistant ] in Zapata," she says. "Every time I see
him on stage, I think to myself, 'There's my
RA!' I think he'll just always by 'my RA' no
matter how famous the band gets."
Cuellar is finishing up an emotion
filled ballad — dedicated to a young
friend in the audience who had re
cently lost a family member — as 1 leave Al
berto's through the back door. I walk past the
band's pickup trucks, noticing one with a
collection of bumper stickers, including the
cartoon-smiley-chile-pepper logo I have
seen on so many T-shirts and baseball caps
and another, in bold block letters, "BOY
COTT GRAPES."
It's hard to tell just from the bumper stick
ers whether this group of musicians is all
about conveying political messages, promot
ing unity or having fun and making music.
But beyond all the press and discussion,
watching the members of Dr. Loco's Rockin'
Jalapeno Band do what they do seems to
prove that these goals are hardly mutually ex
clusive.
Because so often artists' reputations pre
cede them, many who have met Cuellar
probably find it surprising that he is much
more of a father-figure than a revolutionary
leader to the band members.
But beyond medium or message, Cuellar
has no doubts where his priorities lie. "There is
so much talent" (in the band), he says. "What
I've maintained — the one ingredient is socio
logical — is that we work together, get along
together and trust and respect each other.
"lust by having that idea, we improve mu
sically," he continues. "I've played with some
great musicians before, but the essence of
music doesn't come together unless your
rhythms, minds and heartbeats are in sync
with one another. This is a great group of
musicians."
Well, that just about says it all. But one
more question — are you guys red ialapenos or
green ialapenos?
After gathering some input from band
members, Cuellar turns back to me, grin
ning, and delivers a characteristically witty
yet enigmatic response, unobliged to explain
further:
"Mostly green, a couple of red and a few
pink." ■

It's Saturday night at IJ's Blues Down
town in San Jose and men in blue jeans
and snakeskin boots are eyeing women
extravagantly coifed in silver lame from
across the bar. In the background, a sultry
Latin ditty sets the tone for an evening of ro
mantic overtures.
But closer to the stage, the crowd's vibe
feels completely different. Their dress is less
flashy and their listening approach to music
far more hands-on. And as the sea of black
clad fans sway to the sounds of Dr. Loco's
Rockin' Jalapeno Band, more people hit the
dance floor.
The audience up front — their allegiance
pledged to the red-and-green chile pepper
logo on their shirts and baseball caps — are
not only tuned in to the band's unique
masala of rancheras, reggae, jazz and even
country, but also the messages behind spicy
mix.
Dr. Loco (a.k.a. Jose Cuellar), a former
Stanford professor, croons "Las Revolu
cionarias," backed by eight musicians, three
of whom are Stanford alumni. To the blue
jean / lame set, the song is a playful sere
nade, but the diehard fans realize the song's
political significance — it's dedicated to
"mestizas," or women of mixed Chicana
heritage, who have not always been recog
nized as full-fledged members of their com
munity.
Chicana, she's chicana / es mestiza
orgullosa (she is a proud 'mestiza') / and
she's down with the movimiento (move
ment) / some label her Hispanic / but she's
not one to panic," Cuellar sings, his vocals a
reflection of the band's high-spirited, easily
accessible way of kicking politics.
Like much of the band's music, the song

sets an almost-incongruous contrast be
tween upbeat rhythms and distinctly politi
cal messages of racial pride and unity. The
topics range from immigration to laborers'
rights to Martin Luther King, but the medi
um always remains danceable.
And the swaying, bouncing crowd, intox
icated by the music and their intense loyalty
to the band, attests to this. To a staring
passersby, however, a lone dancing, whoop
ing and singing woman with a mixed drink
appears to have found a more conventional
means of inebriation. Taking the only
standing room available near the stage, 1
find myself next to the woman, who intro
duces herself as "Lucia." 1 soon realize she,
though slightly tipsy, is mostly just plain eu
phoric.
Lucia explains that she and a group of
friends — diehard Jalapeno fans — Hew up
from the Southern California suburbs, leav
ing behind teenage children, work and wor
ries to watch the band play. They had just
seen the band several times down South,
and "followed them up" to the Bay Area.
"I saw the band years ago at one of their
first public appearances at Plaza de la Raza,
in San Francisco — I ve been hooked ever
since,' she says still dancing. "I try to see as
many performances as I can now."
1 love this music!" she yells to no one in
particular, temporarily transported into her
own world. She quickly snaps back to reali
ty and tells me, "One thing that makes Dr.
Loco and his band special to me is their
commitment to youth, she says, referring
to their many performances and lectures at
various colleges and universities. "It's so im
portant to grow up with music in your life."
Lucias attention shifts away from me as

she begins to sway in time to "By the Banks
of the Rio Grande," the band's rendition of
the Melodians' reggae classic "By the Rivers
of Babylon." The sensual Latin beats show
only traces of the song's African influence,
yet the music's connection to reggae is clear.
Most of the band's repertoire consists of re
interpretations ot famliar Chicano, Ameri
can or African-American music.

Couples embrace and sway in time to
the band's impressive ensemble of in
struments — saxophones, brass, guitar,
bass, keyboard, even accordion — that
look more like a jazz band than an ethnic
music group. Lucia points out to me that
the ever-grooving Cuellar — in his
trademark dark glasses and braided
beard — has changed shirts because the
first one was soaked with sweat. "He al
ways does that," she says fondly.
As the band takes a break between
sets, Lucia speaks with enthusiasm
about its music. The music is "Chicano,
it's revolutionary anthems, it's funk, it's
fusion, it's blues, classical — it's any
thing you want it to be," she says hearti
ly. "But it's great!"
Classical?
Maybe not, but Lucia accurately rep
resents the band members' resistance to
standard musical categorization because
of their international smorgasbord of
influences.
The categorization conundrum is
precisely the topic of discussion
one week later, as the band re
hearses before a show at Alberto's in
Mountain View.

In contrast to their larger-than-life aura
on stage at J J s, the band is mellow, down
to-earth in the smaller, more familiar venue
— Alberto's was one of the first places the
band played a tew years ago, while some of
its members were still attending Stanford.
Fresh from a practice / jam session on the
Spin Doctors' "Two Princes," a few band
members sit down with me and attempt to
describe the Jalapeno sound. The descrip
tions become more and more complicated
with each successive explanation.
"Chicano world-beat music," key
boardist/accordionist Jesus Coverrubias
says with certainty.
Guitarist and Stanford alum Chris Gon
zalez (Jarke adds that the music "represents
all the different styles musicians play in the
U.S."
"Geographically, Northern California
and Texas are big influences," says Gonzalez
Clarke, also the assistant director of El Cen
tra Chicano. "Any one little part of us you
can find in a different (ethnic and geo
graphical) group."

Compelled to further flesh out the expla
nation, bassist and fellow Stanford alum
Carlos "Charlie" Montoya says, "It's eclec
tic. We incorporate the Chicano influence
with our American roots, reflected in rock
and blues, into the music."
The dual components of the Chicano ex
perience are also reflected in the band's

characteristic use of "Spanglish," a blending
of Spanish and English, which Cuellar
shows mastery over in songs like "Mexi
canamericanos."
I'or our mothers somos (weare) Mexican /
... comprendemos (we understand) el English
/.. .we're bilingues (bilinguals) to the bone. "
Montoya explains, Spanglish "is signifi
cant to all of us because that's the way we
grew up communicating with our families
at home. That's definitely where | the use of
it in the music] came from."
The conversation soon falls away from
music and drifts toward Stanford
memories as Gonzalez Clarke and
Montoya remember living in Casa Zapata.
Gonzalez Clarke and Montoya's Stanford
days hold special significance because they
also marked the beginnings of Dr. Loco's
Rockin lalapeno Hand, when Cuellar, then a
visiting professor at the University, started
bringing together band members.
Before Dr. Loco's Rockin' Jalapeno Band,
Gonzalez Clarke and Montoya had formed
their own band and played some gigs on

ampus. "You know, the campus band thing,
tuh a part of the college experience," Mon
oya says.
So where did you play? At frat parties?
Oli no, no, no. Nothing like that," Montoya
ays, laughing. "Mostly at Zapata parties. It
vas great."
"So is Stanford pretty much the same

right now? he asks. "I mean, the dorms and
everything?"
Pretty much. Oh, they remodeled Wilbur.
"Wilbur? What did they do to Wilbur.?"
It's pastel now.
"Pastel? Wilbur is pastel?" Montoya says,
shaking his head as Gonzalez Clarke laughs.
"I can't believe they made Wilbur pastel.
Is nothing sacred anymore?"
Stern — and Zapata — are still the same
though.
"What a relief," Montoya says, still shak
ing his head.
Finally, 1 catch up with the man himself,
"Doctor Loco" Cuellar, taking a coffee
break with some band members in the
back parking lot of Alberto's. Standing amid
garbage bins and pickup trucks, he describes
the origins of the group.
True to Cuellar's academic roots — he is
now chair of La Raza Studies, the Chicano
studies department at San Francisco State-
University — one of his classroom lectures
at Stanford in sparked the concept of
the band.
The music we play emerged out of what
the Chicano experience is, which I put to
gether in a lecture on Chicano music from

the 2()s to the '905," says Cuellar, saxophon
ist, vocalist and director for the band. In the
process of compiling material for the lecture,
he rediscovered some ot his musical inspira
tions and fellow musicians in a broader cul
tural context.
I he two things I focused on were diver
sity and the transformation of the rhythms

and styles from other cultures, especial
ly Caribbean and Afro-American," he
says, pointing to Carlos Santana's draw
ing directly from African music. "It
didn't start with us, and we reflect that
in our music, by incorporating the ele
ments out there. It's about crossing
boundaries and borders."
These ideas particularly hit home
tor Cuellar because he had been away
from serious singing and playing the
saxophone for eight years, and had been
trying to tind an outlet to return to his
pursuit of music. "I had been hanging
out backstage with the guys from Los
Lobos, who are friends of mine, playing
a little music and trying to show off," he
says. "They kept telling me I should re
ally get out there and just play."
And so he did. Cuellar sought out
members ot the Stanford community to
help pursue his vision.
"At Stanford there was so much tal
ent around," and all he had to do was
bring it all together, he says. Eventually,
the eight band members came together
from Stanford, IJC-Berkeley and other
colleges.
Although the band has earned quite

a name for itself within and outside of
the Bay Area, all band members hold "day"
jobs, many as educators. Covarrubias ex
plains that "it's tough" to balance all of the
weekly rehearsals and gigs with steady em
ployment.
Judging from the band's press, it seems it
has, willingly or not, established its rep
utation as a politically charged,
message-based group. The headlines
read, "The mad doctor and his Rockin'
Jalapeno Band arc on the move — musically
and politically" (San Jose Mercury News),
"Dr. Loco and his music won't let the move
ment die" (The Albuquerque Tribune) and
"Dr. Loco band members flavor their music
with message of non-violence" (Daily Cali
fornian).
I iowever, Cuellar downplays the accuracy
and significance of the band's "leftist" repu
tation. "I like to call it progressivism," he
says. "We promote peace, non-violence,
bringing people together, multiculturalism
and non-racism."
Cuellar points to the band's diverse audi
ences and venues — including the San Fran
cisco Black and White Ball, Berkeley's La
Pen a Cultural Center and Justice for Janitor
Rallies — as evidence that their music does

speak to everyone.
"I think the music leaves people with a
good feeling," he says."It celebrates culture,
celebrates who we all are."
Furthermore, Cuellar attributes the
politicization of the band to the press, rather
than its audiences or the music itself. "The
issue of politics is placed in the context of the
whole spectrum," he says somewhat enig
matically. "It's an issue for every performer,
especially ethnic performers."
So while the media raises the issue of the
band's agenda, Cuellar says he believes the
audiences just "love the music, trip on the
songs and enjoy it all." Personally, he "enjoys
that more than anything else."
Nevertheless, Cuellar does not begrudge
those that do find messages in the medium.
"Folks do raise many of the issues," he says.
"That's cool. That's what we do in academia."
Despite Cuellar's de-emphasis of the
band's political convictions, one can hardly
conclude from the lyrics of songs like "El
Picket Sign" that the joy of the music entire
ly precludes the urgency of the message:
"Some people that 1 know / still eat contam
inated grapes / ... government pesticides /
that poison farm-worker children."
Right before the band is about to go on
stage, Ricardo, the assistant manager
of Alberto's, tells me about the good
old days when the band was just starting out
and all the members' friends would come
out from Stanford to see them.
Ricardo interrupts his reminiscing and
quietly directs my attention to the band
members, who are now standing backstage
in a circle, arms around each other. "This is
a ritual, a prayer. They do it before every
show," he whispers.
Cuellar gives the brief invocation in
hushed tones and the solemn moment con
cludes with a collective shouting of,
"lalapeno .. . power!" as the band heads for
the stage.
Inside the club, audience members have
jam-packed every last square inch and the
dance floor moves like one collective organ
ism. I bump into 1992 Stanford graduate
Anita De Lucio as she exits the dance floor,
exuberant.
She motions toward Montoya on stage.
"Charlie was my freshman year I resident as

sistant ] in Zapata," she says. "Every time I see
him on stage, I think to myself, 'There's my
RA!' I think he'll just always by 'my RA' no
matter how famous the band gets."
Cuellar is finishing up an emotion
filled ballad — dedicated to a young
friend in the audience who had re
cently lost a family member — as 1 leave Al
berto's through the back door. I walk past the
band's pickup trucks, noticing one with a
collection of bumper stickers, including the
cartoon-smiley-chile-pepper logo I have
seen on so many T-shirts and baseball caps
and another, in bold block letters, "BOY
COTT GRAPES."
It's hard to tell just from the bumper stick
ers whether this group of musicians is all
about conveying political messages, promot
ing unity or having fun and making music.
But beyond all the press and discussion,
watching the members of Dr. Loco's Rockin'
Jalapeno Band do what they do seems to
prove that these goals are hardly mutually ex
clusive.
Because so often artists' reputations pre
cede them, many who have met Cuellar
probably find it surprising that he is much
more of a father-figure than a revolutionary
leader to the band members.
But beyond medium or message, Cuellar
has no doubts where his priorities lie. "There is
so much talent" (in the band), he says. "What
I've maintained — the one ingredient is socio
logical — is that we work together, get along
together and trust and respect each other.
"lust by having that idea, we improve mu
sically," he continues. "I've played with some
great musicians before, but the essence of
music doesn't come together unless your
rhythms, minds and heartbeats are in sync
with one another. This is a great group of
musicians."
Well, that just about says it all. But one
more question — are you guys red ialapenos or
green ialapenos?
After gathering some input from band
members, Cuellar turns back to me, grin
ning, and delivers a characteristically witty
yet enigmatic response, unobliged to explain
further:
"Mostly green, a couple of red and a few
pink." ■

town in San Jose and men in blue jeans
and snakeskin boots are eyeing women
extravagantly coifed in silver lame from
across the bar. In the background, a sultry
Latin ditty sets the tone for an evening of ro
mantic overtures.
But closer to the stage, the crowd's vibe
feels completely different. Their dress is less
flashy and their listening approach to music
far more hands-on. And as the sea of black
clad fans sway to the sounds of Dr. Loco's
Rockin' Jalapeno Band, more people hit the
dance floor.
The audience up front — their allegiance
pledged to the red-and-green chile pepper
logo on their shirts and baseball caps — are
not only tuned in to the band's unique
masala of rancheras, reggae, jazz and even
country, but also the messages behind spicy
mix.
Dr. Loco (a.k.a. Jose Cuellar), a former
Stanford professor, croons "Las Revolu
cionarias," backed by eight musicians, three
of whom are Stanford alumni. To the blue
jean / lame set, the song is a playful sere
nade, but the diehard fans realize the song's
political significance — it's dedicated to
"mestizas," or women of mixed Chicana
heritage, who have not always been recog
nized as full-fledged members of their com
munity.
Chicana, she's chicana / es mestiza
orgullosa (she is a proud 'mestiza') / and
she's down with the movimiento (move
ment) / some label her Hispanic / but she's
not one to panic," Cuellar sings, his vocals a
reflection of the band's high-spirited, easily
accessible way of kicking politics.
Like much of the band's music, the song

sets an almost-incongruous contrast be
tween upbeat rhythms and distinctly politi
cal messages of racial pride and unity. The
topics range from immigration to laborers'
rights to Martin Luther King, but the medi
um always remains danceable.
And the swaying, bouncing crowd, intox
icated by the music and their intense loyalty
to the band, attests to this. To a staring
passersby, however, a lone dancing, whoop
ing and singing woman with a mixed drink
appears to have found a more conventional
means of inebriation. Taking the only
standing room available near the stage, 1
find myself next to the woman, who intro
duces herself as "Lucia." 1 soon realize she,
though slightly tipsy, is mostly just plain eu
phoric.
Lucia explains that she and a group of
friends — diehard Jalapeno fans — Hew up
from the Southern California suburbs, leav
ing behind teenage children, work and wor
ries to watch the band play. They had just
seen the band several times down South,
and "followed them up" to the Bay Area.
"I saw the band years ago at one of their
first public appearances at Plaza de la Raza,
in San Francisco — I ve been hooked ever
since,' she says still dancing. "I try to see as
many performances as I can now."
1 love this music!" she yells to no one in
particular, temporarily transported into her
own world. She quickly snaps back to reali
ty and tells me, "One thing that makes Dr.
Loco and his band special to me is their
commitment to youth, she says, referring
to their many performances and lectures at
various colleges and universities. "It's so im
portant to grow up with music in your life."
Lucias attention shifts away from me as

she begins to sway in time to "By the Banks
of the Rio Grande," the band's rendition of
the Melodians' reggae classic "By the Rivers
of Babylon." The sensual Latin beats show
only traces of the song's African influence,
yet the music's connection to reggae is clear.
Most of the band's repertoire consists of re
interpretations ot famliar Chicano, Ameri
can or African-American music.

Couples embrace and sway in time to
the band's impressive ensemble of in
struments — saxophones, brass, guitar,
bass, keyboard, even accordion — that
look more like a jazz band than an ethnic
music group. Lucia points out to me that
the ever-grooving Cuellar — in his
trademark dark glasses and braided
beard — has changed shirts because the
first one was soaked with sweat. "He al
ways does that," she says fondly.
As the band takes a break between
sets, Lucia speaks with enthusiasm
about its music. The music is "Chicano,
it's revolutionary anthems, it's funk, it's
fusion, it's blues, classical — it's any
thing you want it to be," she says hearti
ly. "But it's great!"
Classical?
Maybe not, but Lucia accurately rep
resents the band members' resistance to
standard musical categorization because
of their international smorgasbord of
influences.
The categorization conundrum is
precisely the topic of discussion
one week later, as the band re
hearses before a show at Alberto's in
Mountain View.

In contrast to their larger-than-life aura
on stage at J J s, the band is mellow, down
to-earth in the smaller, more familiar venue
— Alberto's was one of the first places the
band played a tew years ago, while some of
its members were still attending Stanford.
Fresh from a practice / jam session on the
Spin Doctors' "Two Princes," a few band
members sit down with me and attempt to
describe the Jalapeno sound. The descrip
tions become more and more complicated
with each successive explanation.
"Chicano world-beat music," key
boardist/accordionist Jesus Coverrubias
says with certainty.
Guitarist and Stanford alum Chris Gon
zalez (Jarke adds that the music "represents
all the different styles musicians play in the
U.S."
"Geographically, Northern California
and Texas are big influences," says Gonzalez
Clarke, also the assistant director of El Cen
tra Chicano. "Any one little part of us you
can find in a different (ethnic and geo
graphical) group."

Compelled to further flesh out the expla
nation, bassist and fellow Stanford alum
Carlos "Charlie" Montoya says, "It's eclec
tic. We incorporate the Chicano influence
with our American roots, reflected in rock
and blues, into the music."
The dual components of the Chicano ex
perience are also reflected in the band's

characteristic use of "Spanglish," a blending
of Spanish and English, which Cuellar
shows mastery over in songs like "Mexi
canamericanos."
I'or our mothers somos (weare) Mexican /
... comprendemos (we understand) el English
/.. .we're bilingues (bilinguals) to the bone. "
Montoya explains, Spanglish "is signifi
cant to all of us because that's the way we
grew up communicating with our families
at home. That's definitely where | the use of
it in the music] came from."
The conversation soon falls away from
music and drifts toward Stanford
memories as Gonzalez Clarke and
Montoya remember living in Casa Zapata.
Gonzalez Clarke and Montoya's Stanford
days hold special significance because they
also marked the beginnings of Dr. Loco's
Rockin lalapeno Hand, when Cuellar, then a
visiting professor at the University, started
bringing together band members.
Before Dr. Loco's Rockin' Jalapeno Band,
Gonzalez Clarke and Montoya had formed
their own band and played some gigs on

ampus. "You know, the campus band thing,
tuh a part of the college experience," Mon
oya says.
So where did you play? At frat parties?
Oli no, no, no. Nothing like that," Montoya
ays, laughing. "Mostly at Zapata parties. It
vas great."
"So is Stanford pretty much the same

right now? he asks. "I mean, the dorms and
everything?"
Pretty much. Oh, they remodeled Wilbur.
"Wilbur? What did they do to Wilbur.?"
It's pastel now.
"Pastel? Wilbur is pastel?" Montoya says,
shaking his head as Gonzalez Clarke laughs.
"I can't believe they made Wilbur pastel.
Is nothing sacred anymore?"
Stern — and Zapata — are still the same
though.
"What a relief," Montoya says, still shak
ing his head.
Finally, 1 catch up with the man himself,
"Doctor Loco" Cuellar, taking a coffee
break with some band members in the
back parking lot of Alberto's. Standing amid
garbage bins and pickup trucks, he describes
the origins of the group.
True to Cuellar's academic roots — he is
now chair of La Raza Studies, the Chicano
studies department at San Francisco State-
University — one of his classroom lectures
at Stanford in sparked the concept of
the band.
The music we play emerged out of what
the Chicano experience is, which I put to
gether in a lecture on Chicano music from

the 2()s to the '905," says Cuellar, saxophon
ist, vocalist and director for the band. In the
process of compiling material for the lecture,
he rediscovered some ot his musical inspira
tions and fellow musicians in a broader cul
tural context.
I he two things I focused on were diver
sity and the transformation of the rhythms

and styles from other cultures, especial
ly Caribbean and Afro-American," he
says, pointing to Carlos Santana's draw
ing directly from African music. "It
didn't start with us, and we reflect that
in our music, by incorporating the ele
ments out there. It's about crossing
boundaries and borders."
These ideas particularly hit home
tor Cuellar because he had been away
from serious singing and playing the
saxophone for eight years, and had been
trying to tind an outlet to return to his
pursuit of music. "I had been hanging
out backstage with the guys from Los
Lobos, who are friends of mine, playing
a little music and trying to show off," he
says. "They kept telling me I should re
ally get out there and just play."
And so he did. Cuellar sought out
members ot the Stanford community to
help pursue his vision.
"At Stanford there was so much tal
ent around," and all he had to do was
bring it all together, he says. Eventually,
the eight band members came together
from Stanford, IJC-Berkeley and other
colleges.
Although the band has earned quite

a name for itself within and outside of
the Bay Area, all band members hold "day"
jobs, many as educators. Covarrubias ex
plains that "it's tough" to balance all of the
weekly rehearsals and gigs with steady em
ployment.
Judging from the band's press, it seems it
has, willingly or not, established its rep
utation as a politically charged,
message-based group. The headlines
read, "The mad doctor and his Rockin'
Jalapeno Band arc on the move — musically
and politically" (San Jose Mercury News),
"Dr. Loco and his music won't let the move
ment die" (The Albuquerque Tribune) and
"Dr. Loco band members flavor their music
with message of non-violence" (Daily Cali
fornian).
I iowever, Cuellar downplays the accuracy
and significance of the band's "leftist" repu
tation. "I like to call it progressivism," he
says. "We promote peace, non-violence,
bringing people together, multiculturalism
and non-racism."
Cuellar points to the band's diverse audi
ences and venues — including the San Fran
cisco Black and White Ball, Berkeley's La
Pen a Cultural Center and Justice for Janitor
Rallies — as evidence that their music does

speak to everyone.
"I think the music leaves people with a
good feeling," he says."It celebrates culture,
celebrates who we all are."
Furthermore, Cuellar attributes the
politicization of the band to the press, rather
than its audiences or the music itself. "The
issue of politics is placed in the context of the
whole spectrum," he says somewhat enig
matically. "It's an issue for every performer,
especially ethnic performers."
So while the media raises the issue of the
band's agenda, Cuellar says he believes the
audiences just "love the music, trip on the
songs and enjoy it all." Personally, he "enjoys
that more than anything else."
Nevertheless, Cuellar does not begrudge
those that do find messages in the medium.
"Folks do raise many of the issues," he says.
"That's cool. That's what we do in academia."
Despite Cuellar's de-emphasis of the
band's political convictions, one can hardly
conclude from the lyrics of songs like "El
Picket Sign" that the joy of the music entire
ly precludes the urgency of the message:
"Some people that 1 know / still eat contam
inated grapes / ... government pesticides /
that poison farm-worker children."
Right before the band is about to go on
stage, Ricardo, the assistant manager
of Alberto's, tells me about the good
old days when the band was just starting out
and all the members' friends would come
out from Stanford to see them.
Ricardo interrupts his reminiscing and
quietly directs my attention to the band
members, who are now standing backstage
in a circle, arms around each other. "This is
a ritual, a prayer. They do it before every
show," he whispers.
Cuellar gives the brief invocation in
hushed tones and the solemn moment con
cludes with a collective shouting of,
"lalapeno .. . power!" as the band heads for
the stage.
Inside the club, audience members have
jam-packed every last square inch and the
dance floor moves like one collective organ
ism. I bump into 1992 Stanford graduate
Anita De Lucio as she exits the dance floor,
exuberant.
She motions toward Montoya on stage.
"Charlie was my freshman year I resident as

sistant ] in Zapata," she says. "Every time I see
him on stage, I think to myself, 'There's my
RA!' I think he'll just always by 'my RA' no
matter how famous the band gets."
Cuellar is finishing up an emotion
filled ballad — dedicated to a young
friend in the audience who had re
cently lost a family member — as 1 leave Al
berto's through the back door. I walk past the
band's pickup trucks, noticing one with a
collection of bumper stickers, including the
cartoon-smiley-chile-pepper logo I have
seen on so many T-shirts and baseball caps
and another, in bold block letters, "BOY
COTT GRAPES."
It's hard to tell just from the bumper stick
ers whether this group of musicians is all
about conveying political messages, promot
ing unity or having fun and making music.
But beyond all the press and discussion,
watching the members of Dr. Loco's Rockin'
Jalapeno Band do what they do seems to
prove that these goals are hardly mutually ex
clusive.
Because so often artists' reputations pre
cede them, many who have met Cuellar
probably find it surprising that he is much
more of a father-figure than a revolutionary
leader to the band members.
But beyond medium or message, Cuellar
has no doubts where his priorities lie. "There is
so much talent" (in the band), he says. "What
I've maintained — the one ingredient is socio
logical — is that we work together, get along
together and trust and respect each other.
"lust by having that idea, we improve mu
sically," he continues. "I've played with some
great musicians before, but the essence of
music doesn't come together unless your
rhythms, minds and heartbeats are in sync
with one another. This is a great group of
musicians."
Well, that just about says it all. But one
more question — are you guys red ialapenos or
green ialapenos?
After gathering some input from band
members, Cuellar turns back to me, grin
ning, and delivers a characteristically witty
yet enigmatic response, unobliged to explain
further:
"Mostly green, a couple of red and a few
pink." ■

extravagantly coifed in silver lame from
across the bar. In the background, a sultry
Latin ditty sets the tone for an evening of ro
mantic overtures.
But closer to the stage, the crowd's vibe
feels completely different. Their dress is less
flashy and their listening approach to music
far more hands-on. And as the sea of black
clad fans sway to the sounds of Dr. Loco's
Rockin' Jalapeno Band, more people hit the
dance floor.
The audience up front — their allegiance
pledged to the red-and-green chile pepper
logo on their shirts and baseball caps — are
not only tuned in to the band's unique
masala of rancheras, reggae, jazz and even
country, but also the messages behind spicy
mix.
Dr. Loco (a.k.a. Jose Cuellar), a former
Stanford professor, croons "Las Revolu
cionarias," backed by eight musicians, three
of whom are Stanford alumni. To the blue
jean / lame set, the song is a playful sere
nade, but the diehard fans realize the song's
political significance — it's dedicated to
"mestizas," or women of mixed Chicana
heritage, who have not always been recog
nized as full-fledged members of their com
munity.
Chicana, she's chicana / es mestiza
orgullosa (she is a proud 'mestiza') / and
she's down with the movimiento (move
ment) / some label her Hispanic / but she's
not one to panic," Cuellar sings, his vocals a
reflection of the band's high-spirited, easily
accessible way of kicking politics.
Like much of the band's music, the song

sets an almost-incongruous contrast be
tween upbeat rhythms and distinctly politi
cal messages of racial pride and unity. The
topics range from immigration to laborers'
rights to Martin Luther King, but the medi
um always remains danceable.
And the swaying, bouncing crowd, intox
icated by the music and their intense loyalty
to the band, attests to this. To a staring
passersby, however, a lone dancing, whoop
ing and singing woman with a mixed drink
appears to have found a more conventional
means of inebriation. Taking the only
standing room available near the stage, 1
find myself next to the woman, who intro
duces herself as "Lucia." 1 soon realize she,
though slightly tipsy, is mostly just plain eu
phoric.
Lucia explains that she and a group of
friends — diehard Jalapeno fans — Hew up
from the Southern California suburbs, leav
ing behind teenage children, work and wor
ries to watch the band play. They had just
seen the band several times down South,
and "followed them up" to the Bay Area.
"I saw the band years ago at one of their
first public appearances at Plaza de la Raza,
in San Francisco — I ve been hooked ever
since,' she says still dancing. "I try to see as
many performances as I can now."
1 love this music!" she yells to no one in
particular, temporarily transported into her
own world. She quickly snaps back to reali
ty and tells me, "One thing that makes Dr.
Loco and his band special to me is their
commitment to youth, she says, referring
to their many performances and lectures at
various colleges and universities. "It's so im
portant to grow up with music in your life."
Lucias attention shifts away from me as

she begins to sway in time to "By the Banks
of the Rio Grande," the band's rendition of
the Melodians' reggae classic "By the Rivers
of Babylon." The sensual Latin beats show
only traces of the song's African influence,
yet the music's connection to reggae is clear.
Most of the band's repertoire consists of re
interpretations ot famliar Chicano, Ameri
can or African-American music.

Couples embrace and sway in time to
the band's impressive ensemble of in
struments — saxophones, brass, guitar,
bass, keyboard, even accordion — that
look more like a jazz band than an ethnic
music group. Lucia points out to me that
the ever-grooving Cuellar — in his
trademark dark glasses and braided
beard — has changed shirts because the
first one was soaked with sweat. "He al
ways does that," she says fondly.
As the band takes a break between
sets, Lucia speaks with enthusiasm
about its music. The music is "Chicano,
it's revolutionary anthems, it's funk, it's
fusion, it's blues, classical — it's any
thing you want it to be," she says hearti
ly. "But it's great!"
Classical?
Maybe not, but Lucia accurately rep
resents the band members' resistance to
standard musical categorization because
of their international smorgasbord of
influences.
The categorization conundrum is
precisely the topic of discussion
one week later, as the band re
hearses before a show at Alberto's in
Mountain View.

In contrast to their larger-than-life aura
on stage at J J s, the band is mellow, down
to-earth in the smaller, more familiar venue
— Alberto's was one of the first places the
band played a tew years ago, while some of
its members were still attending Stanford.
Fresh from a practice / jam session on the
Spin Doctors' "Two Princes," a few band
members sit down with me and attempt to
describe the Jalapeno sound. The descrip
tions become more and more complicated
with each successive explanation.
"Chicano world-beat music," key
boardist/accordionist Jesus Coverrubias
says with certainty.
Guitarist and Stanford alum Chris Gon
zalez (Jarke adds that the music "represents
all the different styles musicians play in the
U.S."
"Geographically, Northern California
and Texas are big influences," says Gonzalez
Clarke, also the assistant director of El Cen
tra Chicano. "Any one little part of us you
can find in a different (ethnic and geo
graphical) group."

Compelled to further flesh out the expla
nation, bassist and fellow Stanford alum
Carlos "Charlie" Montoya says, "It's eclec
tic. We incorporate the Chicano influence
with our American roots, reflected in rock
and blues, into the music."
The dual components of the Chicano ex
perience are also reflected in the band's

characteristic use of "Spanglish," a blending
of Spanish and English, which Cuellar
shows mastery over in songs like "Mexi
canamericanos."
I'or our mothers somos (weare) Mexican /
... comprendemos (we understand) el English
/.. .we're bilingues (bilinguals) to the bone. "
Montoya explains, Spanglish "is signifi
cant to all of us because that's the way we
grew up communicating with our families
at home. That's definitely where | the use of
it in the music] came from."
The conversation soon falls away from
music and drifts toward Stanford
memories as Gonzalez Clarke and
Montoya remember living in Casa Zapata.
Gonzalez Clarke and Montoya's Stanford
days hold special significance because they
also marked the beginnings of Dr. Loco's
Rockin lalapeno Hand, when Cuellar, then a
visiting professor at the University, started
bringing together band members.
Before Dr. Loco's Rockin' Jalapeno Band,
Gonzalez Clarke and Montoya had formed
their own band and played some gigs on

ampus. "You know, the campus band thing,
tuh a part of the college experience," Mon
oya says.
So where did you play? At frat parties?
Oli no, no, no. Nothing like that," Montoya
ays, laughing. "Mostly at Zapata parties. It
vas great."
"So is Stanford pretty much the same

right now? he asks. "I mean, the dorms and
everything?"
Pretty much. Oh, they remodeled Wilbur.
"Wilbur? What did they do to Wilbur.?"
It's pastel now.
"Pastel? Wilbur is pastel?" Montoya says,
shaking his head as Gonzalez Clarke laughs.
"I can't believe they made Wilbur pastel.
Is nothing sacred anymore?"
Stern — and Zapata — are still the same
though.
"What a relief," Montoya says, still shak
ing his head.
Finally, 1 catch up with the man himself,
"Doctor Loco" Cuellar, taking a coffee
break with some band members in the
back parking lot of Alberto's. Standing amid
garbage bins and pickup trucks, he describes
the origins of the group.
True to Cuellar's academic roots — he is
now chair of La Raza Studies, the Chicano
studies department at San Francisco State-
University — one of his classroom lectures
at Stanford in sparked the concept of
the band.
The music we play emerged out of what
the Chicano experience is, which I put to
gether in a lecture on Chicano music from

the 2()s to the '905," says Cuellar, saxophon
ist, vocalist and director for the band. In the
process of compiling material for the lecture,
he rediscovered some ot his musical inspira
tions and fellow musicians in a broader cul
tural context.
I he two things I focused on were diver
sity and the transformation of the rhythms

and styles from other cultures, especial
ly Caribbean and Afro-American," he
says, pointing to Carlos Santana's draw
ing directly from African music. "It
didn't start with us, and we reflect that
in our music, by incorporating the ele
ments out there. It's about crossing
boundaries and borders."
These ideas particularly hit home
tor Cuellar because he had been away
from serious singing and playing the
saxophone for eight years, and had been
trying to tind an outlet to return to his
pursuit of music. "I had been hanging
out backstage with the guys from Los
Lobos, who are friends of mine, playing
a little music and trying to show off," he
says. "They kept telling me I should re
ally get out there and just play."
And so he did. Cuellar sought out
members ot the Stanford community to
help pursue his vision.
"At Stanford there was so much tal
ent around," and all he had to do was
bring it all together, he says. Eventually,
the eight band members came together
from Stanford, IJC-Berkeley and other
colleges.
Although the band has earned quite

a name for itself within and outside of
the Bay Area, all band members hold "day"
jobs, many as educators. Covarrubias ex
plains that "it's tough" to balance all of the
weekly rehearsals and gigs with steady em
ployment.
Judging from the band's press, it seems it
has, willingly or not, established its rep
utation as a politically charged,
message-based group. The headlines
read, "The mad doctor and his Rockin'
Jalapeno Band arc on the move — musically
and politically" (San Jose Mercury News),
"Dr. Loco and his music won't let the move
ment die" (The Albuquerque Tribune) and
"Dr. Loco band members flavor their music
with message of non-violence" (Daily Cali
fornian).
I iowever, Cuellar downplays the accuracy
and significance of the band's "leftist" repu
tation. "I like to call it progressivism," he
says. "We promote peace, non-violence,
bringing people together, multiculturalism
and non-racism."
Cuellar points to the band's diverse audi
ences and venues — including the San Fran
cisco Black and White Ball, Berkeley's La
Pen a Cultural Center and Justice for Janitor
Rallies — as evidence that their music does

speak to everyone.
"I think the music leaves people with a
good feeling," he says."It celebrates culture,
celebrates who we all are."
Furthermore, Cuellar attributes the
politicization of the band to the press, rather
than its audiences or the music itself. "The
issue of politics is placed in the context of the
whole spectrum," he says somewhat enig
matically. "It's an issue for every performer,
especially ethnic performers."
So while the media raises the issue of the
band's agenda, Cuellar says he believes the
audiences just "love the music, trip on the
songs and enjoy it all." Personally, he "enjoys
that more than anything else."
Nevertheless, Cuellar does not begrudge
those that do find messages in the medium.
"Folks do raise many of the issues," he says.
"That's cool. That's what we do in academia."
Despite Cuellar's de-emphasis of the
band's political convictions, one can hardly
conclude from the lyrics of songs like "El
Picket Sign" that the joy of the music entire
ly precludes the urgency of the message:
"Some people that 1 know / still eat contam
inated grapes / ... government pesticides /
that poison farm-worker children."
Right before the band is about to go on
stage, Ricardo, the assistant manager
of Alberto's, tells me about the good
old days when the band was just starting out
and all the members' friends would come
out from Stanford to see them.
Ricardo interrupts his reminiscing and
quietly directs my attention to the band
members, who are now standing backstage
in a circle, arms around each other. "This is
a ritual, a prayer. They do it before every
show," he whispers.
Cuellar gives the brief invocation in
hushed tones and the solemn moment con
cludes with a collective shouting of,
"lalapeno .. . power!" as the band heads for
the stage.
Inside the club, audience members have
jam-packed every last square inch and the
dance floor moves like one collective organ
ism. I bump into 1992 Stanford graduate
Anita De Lucio as she exits the dance floor,
exuberant.
She motions toward Montoya on stage.
"Charlie was my freshman year I resident as

sistant ] in Zapata," she says. "Every time I see
him on stage, I think to myself, 'There's my
RA!' I think he'll just always by 'my RA' no
matter how famous the band gets."
Cuellar is finishing up an emotion
filled ballad — dedicated to a young
friend in the audience who had re
cently lost a family member — as 1 leave Al
berto's through the back door. I walk past the
band's pickup trucks, noticing one with a
collection of bumper stickers, including the
cartoon-smiley-chile-pepper logo I have
seen on so many T-shirts and baseball caps
and another, in bold block letters, "BOY
COTT GRAPES."
It's hard to tell just from the bumper stick
ers whether this group of musicians is all
about conveying political messages, promot
ing unity or having fun and making music.
But beyond all the press and discussion,
watching the members of Dr. Loco's Rockin'
Jalapeno Band do what they do seems to
prove that these goals are hardly mutually ex
clusive.
Because so often artists' reputations pre
cede them, many who have met Cuellar
probably find it surprising that he is much
more of a father-figure than a revolutionary
leader to the band members.
But beyond medium or message, Cuellar
has no doubts where his priorities lie. "There is
so much talent" (in the band), he says. "What
I've maintained — the one ingredient is socio
logical — is that we work together, get along
together and trust and respect each other.
"lust by having that idea, we improve mu
sically," he continues. "I've played with some
great musicians before, but the essence of
music doesn't come together unless your
rhythms, minds and heartbeats are in sync
with one another. This is a great group of
musicians."
Well, that just about says it all. But one
more question — are you guys red ialapenos or
green ialapenos?
After gathering some input from band
members, Cuellar turns back to me, grin
ning, and delivers a characteristically witty
yet enigmatic response, unobliged to explain
further:
"Mostly green, a couple of red and a few
pink." ■
