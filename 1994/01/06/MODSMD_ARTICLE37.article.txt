# Spielberg's apocalypse
## The 						harrowing images of 'Schindler's List' 
### 
The dark images of "Schindler's List" are
limitless, never-ending. Each is a moment that
haunts long after the film's end.
A road paved with gravestones taken from
a Jewish cemetery...
A young girl wearing Shirley Temple
curls and a pretty dress, cowering alone
under a bed ...
A flabby-looking elitist shooting at ran
dom passersby (read unsuspecting Jews) from
his bedroom's balcony...
The newest in a long line of Steven Spiel
berg productions, striking visuals and story
push "Schindler's List" far beyond the raptors
and Tyrannosaurus Rex of last summer's
"Jurassic Park" or any of the director's other

hits ("E.T. the Extraterrestrial," "Close En
counters of the Third Kind").
Adhering closely to Thomas Keneally's
novel of the same tide, "Schindler's List" fo
cuses on Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) —
failed businessman extraordinaire, member
of the Nazi party, lover of drink, women and
wealth... savior to more than 1,100 Jews.
The film charts his transformation from a
man who makes his fortune off the slave labor
of Jews in 1940s Cracow to one who sacrifices
his fortune and risks his life to protect his
workers from the certain death awaiting them
at Nazi concentration camps.
By choosing Schindler's story, Spielberg is
forced to make him a hero in an evil environ

ment, the one righteous man, the savior.
Maybe he deserves the title. After all,
Schindler's actions could have easily gotten
him killed long before Germany's surrender;
the Nazis, especially the SS, did not deal com
passionately with people suspected of having
sympathies toward, let alone protecting, Jews.
There was a high risk attached to Schindler's
actions. Every bribe he made, every Jew he
saved could have been the one that sent him —
as well as all of his "workers" — to Auschwitz's
gas chambers. And after World War 11,
Schindler had nothing left but the charity of
the Jews whose lives he had secured.
However, in forcing Schindler to be a hero,
"Schindler's List" denies the character the in
tricacies and depth that make his motives
worth examining.
Is he acting out of the newly found good
ness of his heart? Does he have some far-see
ing vision of Germany's downfall that leads
him to protect Jews in an effort to save his own
hide? Are his actions merely a natural re
sponse to the brutality he witnesses? Is he self
less or selfish? Does he truly consider the Jews
his equals?
Ironically, because Schindler's intricacies
are muted, the most fascinatingly complex
character is none other than Plaszow's com
mander Amon Goeth, portrayed by Ralph Fi
ennes. An intelligent monster unable to recog
nize the value of human life, Goeth is so psy
chotic, unpredictable, callous and unfeeling
that you can't help wondering what made him
that way. His movements are unpredictable, if
only because there is no way to tell where his
destructive hand will touch down next.
Surprisingly, Spielberg's great Jewish mo
ment, his film about the I lolocaust, is actually
focused primarily on two Germans —
Schindler and Goeth. Most of the Jews on
"Schindler's List" are just names on paper, al

most unrecognizable faces in a ceaseless
crowd, recurring faces which lack individual
personalities and complexities. Yet the very
anonymity of the Jewish characters is an illus
tration of the way they were viewed by Nazis
— they weren't complex individuals, they
were subhuman swine.
Only Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) is depict
ed as more than a Jewish facade. As the true
business acumen behind Schindler's produc
tion empire and the manipulator who helps
push the confused Nazi toward the role of pro
tector, Stern is a Jew with a mission. He is
frighteningly intelligent and painfully realis
tic; at one point, he believes in the inevitabili
ty of his own death while still fighting to save
others' lives.
Despite its problems, Spielberg's film de
serve the honor and attention it has garnered.
For "Schindler's List" is an education.
The scenes depicting the evacuation of the
Cracow ghetto and the environment inside
the Plaskowcamp show the unvarnished ugli
ness of the Nazi's "Final Solution." The piles of
naked bodies dumped in mass graves, the long
lines of men and women waiting to get a dom
ineering "J" stamped on the cards that validate
them as "essential workers" for the German
war movement — each illustrates sheer de
humanization.
The faces of those Jews — in life, in death
and in degradation — haunt. They sadden.
They anger.
Despite the fact that Spielberg set out to tell
the story of a German "righteous" person and
the 1,1 (X) Jews he saves, he ends up filming the
ugliness and evil which surrounds their narra
tive. With those indelible images, "Schindler's
List" captures the truth of the more than six
million murders carried out just a half-centu
ry ago.

hits ("E.T. the Extraterrestrial," "Close En
counters of the Third Kind").
Adhering closely to Thomas Keneally's
novel of the same tide, "Schindler's List" fo
cuses on Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) —
failed businessman extraordinaire, member
of the Nazi party, lover of drink, women and
wealth... savior to more than 1,100 Jews.
The film charts his transformation from a
man who makes his fortune off the slave labor
of Jews in 1940s Cracow to one who sacrifices
his fortune and risks his life to protect his
workers from the certain death awaiting them
at Nazi concentration camps.
By choosing Schindler's story, Spielberg is
forced to make him a hero in an evil environ

ment, the one righteous man, the savior.
Maybe he deserves the title. After all,
Schindler's actions could have easily gotten
him killed long before Germany's surrender;
the Nazis, especially the SS, did not deal com
passionately with people suspected of having
sympathies toward, let alone protecting, Jews.
There was a high risk attached to Schindler's
actions. Every bribe he made, every Jew he
saved could have been the one that sent him —
as well as all of his "workers" — to Auschwitz's
gas chambers. And after World War 11,
Schindler had nothing left but the charity of
the Jews whose lives he had secured.
However, in forcing Schindler to be a hero,
"Schindler's List" denies the character the in
tricacies and depth that make his motives
worth examining.
Is he acting out of the newly found good
ness of his heart? Does he have some far-see
ing vision of Germany's downfall that leads
him to protect Jews in an effort to save his own
hide? Are his actions merely a natural re
sponse to the brutality he witnesses? Is he self
less or selfish? Does he truly consider the Jews
his equals?
Ironically, because Schindler's intricacies
are muted, the most fascinatingly complex
character is none other than Plaszow's com
mander Amon Goeth, portrayed by Ralph Fi
ennes. An intelligent monster unable to recog
nize the value of human life, Goeth is so psy
chotic, unpredictable, callous and unfeeling
that you can't help wondering what made him
that way. His movements are unpredictable, if
only because there is no way to tell where his
destructive hand will touch down next.
Surprisingly, Spielberg's great Jewish mo
ment, his film about the I lolocaust, is actually
focused primarily on two Germans —
Schindler and Goeth. Most of the Jews on
"Schindler's List" are just names on paper, al

most unrecognizable faces in a ceaseless
crowd, recurring faces which lack individual
personalities and complexities. Yet the very
anonymity of the Jewish characters is an illus
tration of the way they were viewed by Nazis
— they weren't complex individuals, they
were subhuman swine.
Only Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) is depict
ed as more than a Jewish facade. As the true
business acumen behind Schindler's produc
tion empire and the manipulator who helps
push the confused Nazi toward the role of pro
tector, Stern is a Jew with a mission. He is
frighteningly intelligent and painfully realis
tic; at one point, he believes in the inevitabili
ty of his own death while still fighting to save
others' lives.
Despite its problems, Spielberg's film de
serve the honor and attention it has garnered.
For "Schindler's List" is an education.
The scenes depicting the evacuation of the
Cracow ghetto and the environment inside
the Plaskowcamp show the unvarnished ugli
ness of the Nazi's "Final Solution." The piles of
naked bodies dumped in mass graves, the long
lines of men and women waiting to get a dom
ineering "J" stamped on the cards that validate
them as "essential workers" for the German
war movement — each illustrates sheer de
humanization.
The faces of those Jews — in life, in death
and in degradation — haunt. They sadden.
They anger.
Despite the fact that Spielberg set out to tell
the story of a German "righteous" person and
the 1,1 (X) Jews he saves, he ends up filming the
ugliness and evil which surrounds their narra
tive. With those indelible images, "Schindler's
List" captures the truth of the more than six
million murders carried out just a half-centu
ry ago.
