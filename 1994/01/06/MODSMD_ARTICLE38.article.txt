## Pelican Brief 
### 
Picture Julia Roberts in a college sweatshirt
and jeans. She could almost (just almost, mind
you) pass for your average law student. You
know, the kind who has all the answers in class,
sleeps with her professor, and in her spare time,
uncovers the devious conspiracy behind the
deaths of two Supreme Court justices.
Just a normal law student.
But this premise is no more believable in
Alan J. Pakula's cinematic version of "The Pel
ican Brier than it is in John Grisham's best
selling novel. While both the flick's meddling
law-student-who-gets-

in-way-over- her-head
scenario isn't beyond
the realm of possibili
ty, the suggestion that
one week of research
yields a specific case
and a specific suspect
smells like fairyland.
Especially when that
suspect not only turns
out to be (gasp) the ac
tual murderer, but
puts his next contract
out on the "pretty" law
student.

No one can accuse Pakula of original ideas.
Every chase scene, every scream, every shot
. . . every scene of the movie is lifted almost
verbatim from the novel. Who needs a screen
writer?
Well, Pakula (screenwriter, director, co
producer) did need a better casting director.
There never was a role so miscast as Darby
Shaw. After being Richard Gere's one and only
"Pretty Woman," Roberts is just plain unbe
lievable as the brilliant Tulane law student who
accidentally uncovers the darkest White House
scandal this side of Watergate.
Casting Denzel Washington as star Wash
ington Herald reporter Gray Grantham, a
white character in Grisham's book, could have
been an innovative move, but Pakula chickens
out. Instead of sending the message that it
doesn't matter if you're black or white, the end
ing is altered to pre-empt interracial romance
from hitting the silver screen, subsequently re
inforcing traditional prejudices. Is this 1953 or
1993?
Overall, "The Pelican Brier is just another
chase movie. There are good guys, bad guys and
gunshots galore. If the book were any better,
staying home and reading it might be an op
tion, even though it is traditional bestseller
junky fare.
So much for the long-awaited Julia Roberts
comeback.
