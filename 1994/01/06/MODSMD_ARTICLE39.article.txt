The somber tone of "Heaven and Earth"
cannot promise a cure for the post-vacation
blues. But Oliver Stone's latest brilliant cre
ation stands out among Vietnam films because
the story is told from the rarely-seen Viet
namese perspective.
The third in Stone's Vietnam trilogy, "Heav
en and Earth" is the true story of the remarkable
life of a Vietnamese woman, Le I.y Hayslip
(Hicp Thi Le), a countrygirl who worked for
the Victcong until she was beaten and raped by
its soldiers.
While living in the city of Danang, she meets
Marine Sergeant Steve Butler (Tommy Lee
Jones). They marry and return to San Diego to
gether, where Hayslip must adapt to American
society and her new roles as wife and mother.
And it's not easy. She watches helplessly as
post-war stress pushes her husband to depres
sion and violence. But her persistence and
savvy ultimately help her become a successful
businesswoman.
In her debut performance, Hicp Thi Le
delivers a poignant performance as a girl
forced to grow up too quickly. She is con
vincing in her portrayal of Hayslip's many
hardships. Jones also does a marvelous job as
the scarred veteran. Le Ly's parents (Joan

Chen and Haing S. Ngor) provide support
and love that help their children bear the
war's tragedies.
The film is captivating when it takes place in
Vietnam. Excellent cinematography, beautiful
scenery (shot in Thailand) and Le I.y's incredi
ble story of survival overpower the portion of
the film set in the United States.
The film is especially poignant because it
focuses on the life of one Vietnamese woman
whose plight demonstrates the ravages and
insanity of war. Viewers can connect with
some of the hell that was Vietnam and witness
the spiritual strength that saves Le Ly. As she
says, Le Ly is stranded between North and
South, East and West, past and present, I leav
en and Earth.
