## Board appoints new general manager

The Stanford Bookstore is beginning
the quarter on a clean slate, with the re
cent departure of Asst. General Manager
Philip Chiaramonte and the appointment
of Bay Area businesswoman Peggy
Mendelson as the store's new general
manager.
Chiaramonte left the Bookstore last
month after accepting the position of head
manager at the USC bookstore, according
to Law Prof. Robert Weisberg, the
spokesperson for the Bookstore's board of
directors.
"He felt that with the new CEO coming

in that it was really necessary for (Mendel
son) to have a free hand to pick a whole
new, fresh team," Weisberg said. "It's just
easier on a new executive to just have a
clean slate."
Weisberg said that as a general matter,
the Bookstore's board was also interested
in starting anew after its past record of fi
nancial mismanagement under Chiara
monte and former General Manager
Eldon Speed, but "it didn't translate into
any particular person being forced to
leave."
He added, however, that the board was
glad to have top management with "new
thoughts," and that there would be "much
better financial controls" from
now on.
Speed retired earlier this fall,
citing health reasons. He left
amid allegations that he and
other top store officials received
inappropriate perks — including
the use of a vacation home and
luxury cars. Currently, the
Bookstore is negotiating an out
of-court settlement with the
California attorney general,
who just wrapped up a two-year
investigation of the store.
Weisberg said that Chiara
monte notified the Bookstore's
board of his intention to resign
two months ago. "He winded
down his work gradually and
left a few weeks ago," he said.
Chiaramonte is leaving for "a
chance to be the head of a book
store — it's a step up."
The board has not yet decided
who will be the new assistant
manager — or whether the posi
tion will exist at all. "It's
unclear how the positions under
[Mendelson] will be structured.
There's nothing sacred about
any particular structure," Weis
berg said.
The one certainty, though, is
that the board wants to leave
behind the Bookstore's past
record of financial mismanage
ment, a process it has already
begun by selling the company
cars and vacation home, as well
as taking a more active role in
supervising the board's finan
cial activities.
Choosing Mendelson to head
the Bookstore is part of that
effort. Along with her opera
tional abilities, Weisberg said,
she was picked for having the
"highest level of integrity," to
ensure that past questionable
employee-compensation prac
tices are not repeated.
At least a few hundred people
were considered for the posi
tion, according to Weisberg. An
outside executive firm then pre
sented a group of 20 to 30 people
to the search committee,
chaired by Robert Augsburger, a
veteran University administra
tor. After more interviews, the
committee chose two finalists
who met with other members of
the Bookstore board.
Although she does not have

prior bookstore experience,
Mendelson was chosen because
of her knowledge of large, com
plex enterprises and her range
of executive skills, Weisberg
said.
"Very few bookstores in the
country are the size and com
plexity of this organization,"
said Weisberg. "She has a wide
variety of experience, and we
are confident that she can learn
quickly." He added that Mendel
son "has a fabulous record in
terms of employee relations."
Before accepting the Book
store job, Mendelson served as
president of New York Fabrics,
which has 18 stores in the Bay
Area.
Previously, she was senior
vice president of Butterfield &
Butterfield, the world's fourth
largest auction house. From
1985 to 1989 she worked at
Neiman Marcus, where she
became the first woman to head
a major retail business in the
Union Square District of San
Francisco.
Mendelson said her personal
goals for the Bookstore include
exceeding the expectations of
their customer base. "I under
stand that the mission of the
Bookstore is to serve the Uni
versity," she said.
Although she has only been
working a few days, Mendelson
said she already has plans to dis
cuss cooperating with Tresidder
Union in retailing. Weisberg
also mentioned other plans for
the Bookstore, including the
possibility of a computer
database with the library sys
tem which could give professors
the flexibility to create their
own textbooks and change
course materials from year to
year.
Mendelson said that the cus
tom publishing currently done
by the Bookstore will expand in
the future and include more
than printing course readers. A
"print on demand" option, she
said, could allow the printing of
particular sections or chapters
of books as requested.
Business Prof. William
Lazier served as acting manager
of the Bookstore on a pro bono
basis until a new manager was
found. "We at Stanford Univer
sity owe [Lazier] a great debt,"
said Weisberg. "I'm not sure
how this enterprise would have
survived without him."
