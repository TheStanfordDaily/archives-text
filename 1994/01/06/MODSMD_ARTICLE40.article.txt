# Ice Cube's final exit
## Why 'Lethal Injection' may be career suicide 
### 
To Ci or not to G is the question —
Ice Cube waxes Shakespearean on
the first track of his new album
"Lethal Injection." Unfortunately for
us, he chooses to G, turning out an
album that's so bad, only a talented
rapper could have made it. And like
I lamlet, he doesn't go down alone —
he drags down Da Lench Mob, QD
111, Solid Productions, Louis Far
rakhan and the future of hardcore
hip-hop with him.
It's not as though we couldn't see
it coming. After shaking free of his
ex manager's lago-like influence, Ice
Cube broke north, leaving N.W.A.'s
Desdemona ass in his wake.
The one-two combination of his
debut album, "Amerikkka's Most
Wanted" and its controversial fol
low-up "Death Certificate," estab
lished Ice Cube as hardcore's pre
mier playwright, an ebony bard who
painted the walls of South Central
Klsinore red with bloody tales from
the dark side of America. Racist cops,
Korean grocers, sellout Negroes,
white men in search of black wadada
and N.W.A. — all felt the impact of
Ice Cube's verbal double-pump
rumpshaker.
But the production that had been
so solid on the first two albums and
the LP. "Kill at Will" started to slip
on his third release, "The Predator,"
as Ice Cube struggled to redefine
himself. And one of the corpses he
thought was six-feet deep — Dr. Dre
of N.W.A. — came back strapped
harder than Banquo's ghost with
" The Chronic," which turned P-Funk

into G-Funk and turned out R&B in
the process. So if "The Chronic" is the
"Jurassic Park" of hardcore and
Snoop Doggy Dogg's "Doggystyle" is
"The Fugitive," "Lethal Injection"
would be "Last Action Hero" — a 12-
track stink-bomb whose stench may
never go away.
The album opens with Ice Cube as
a doctor putting a bullet in his pa
tient's head; hence its title, "The
Shot." The patient's crime? Being
white, male and stupid enough to
think that a black doctor wouldn't
code-switch out of Cube's gangsta
twang. Track two, "Really Doe,"
while fairly funky, exposes the inse
curities that lie at the heart of Ice
Cube's heart of darkness in its cho
rus: "You got to believe in some
thin' / Why not believe in me? /
'Cause I'm a mothafuckin' G / God
damn I'm a mothafuckin G." It's a
sad day for hip-hop when the self
proclaimed "nigga ya love to hate"
stoops to beg for our approval.
But w w wait it gets worse. The
lack of conviction on the majority of
the album's tracks — "LiP Ass Gee,"
"What Can I Do" and "You Know
How We Do It" — culminates in a
pointless remake of George Clinton's
"Bop Gun" that, at over 11 minutes,
is simply interminable. His produc
tion fell off last year; now, the un
thinkable happens — his lyrics and
delivery join them in the abyss of hip
hop's Ninth Circle of Hell.
The only track that captures a
fraction of Cube's patented black rage
is also the album's cheapest shot,

"Cave Bitch," which warns black men
of the dangers of white women. Dr.
Khalid Muhammad, one of Louis Far
rakhan's New York ministers, delivers
the blistering opening monologue:
"Give me a black goddess sister I
can't resist her. No stringy haired
blond haired pale skinned butter
milk complexioncd grafted recessive
depressive ironing board backside
straight up but straight down no frills
no thrills Miss six o'clock subject to
have the itch mutanoid caucasoid
white cave bitch."
Whew. Afterwards, Cube joins in,
telling his white female audience,
"You can be a fan, but don't try to ex
pand and take my dick in ya hand."
Fine, he doesn't like white women,
but does that correspond to a deep
and abiding love for black women?
With such sonnets as "You can't get
mine ho, I'd rather fuck an albi
no / At least I know she's coming
from the Nubian and not the Ku
Klux Klan that you be in" the answer
has to be, we 11... no.
Sadly, an album originally
planned as a defiant statement de
generates into self-parody — like
much of today's hardcore hip
hop. "Lethal Injection" was sup
posed to provide Ice Cube's sag
ging career with a shot in the arm.
But no matter how frantic the
tired basslines and empty verses
may be, the loudest sounds we
hear arc those of Ice Cube shoot
ing himself in his Timberland
covcred foot.
