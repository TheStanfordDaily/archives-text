## "Pale Sun, Crescent Moon" Cowboy Junkies 
### 
"Pale Sun, Crescent Moon," the latest release
from the folk / country rock outfit The Cowbov
Junkies, is a study in oppositions — best reflect
ed in the dual title tracks. "Crescent Moon,"
which opens the record, is a languid, romantic
evocation of a cool autumn evening "out among
the fields gently hipped beneath the corn." "I
know I'm not part of the life you had
planned / but I think once your body feels my
hand / your mind will change and your heart will
lose its pain," lead singer Margo Timmins coos.
But "Pale Sun," the album's seventh track, is
a raucous powerhouse, depicting a relentless
dust bowl emptiness where "grass plains
stretch to the horizon, not a soul can be found
on them." As guitars growl in the background,

Timmins warbles,
"Pale sun falls with
out contest. Here is
obedient darkness."
So it goes on this
strangely powerful
album, one in which
the Junkies alternate
between their trade
mark torch and twang
and a more muscular
mainstream sound.
"Pale Sun, Crescent
Moon" is the record

of a truly groundbreaking hand working through
a midlife neurosis — with mixed results.
Anyone who heard the Junkies' brilliant
1990 album "The Trinity Session" — an eclec
tic, almost mystic collection of originals and
covers of Lou Reed and I lank Williams, among
others — might be a bit startled by the new re
lease. The Junkies retain their melodious in
stincts with a good dose of Southern story
telling. They even quote Faulkner's "Absalom,
Absalom" during "First Recollection."
But there's something new here, too. Song
writer Michael Timmins has thrown in a more
poppish and psychedelic feel to his own songs
— and even stoops to record "The Post," writ
ten by 1 Mascis of alternative rock icon Di
nosaur Jr. Rather than continuing down a nos
talgic path, the Junkies seem to make overtures
to the tastes of a new audience.
The product is fine, but a little unsatisfying.
Part of the problem is Timmins, whose almost
bored voice doesn't quite cut over the harder
sound of her band. On "Anniversary Song,"
you'd prefer Natalie Merchant; the sultry
"Floorboard Blues" cries for Bonnie Raitt.
That's not to say "Pale Sun, Crescent Moon"
isn't an important release; it simply isn't very
coherent. Maybe the lunkies are just gearing up
for next time. In a rare burst of assertion, Tim
mins sings, "Don't accuse me of running
scared, listen to what I'm saying. It's a fucked
up ole world, but this ole girl, well, she ain't giv
ingin."
Indeed, this disc leaves you hungry for
more.
