# "The Buried Life" Medicine
## 
### 
Just because the band's music is innova
tive doesn't necessarily mean it's interesting.
Take Medicine's latest album, "The
Buried Life," for example. The band proves
that unique music can be as uninspiring as a
trite pop song.
The sound of the Chicago-based band
can be characterized as shoegaze pop with a
distinctive dance beat. Founding bass and
drum rhythms and clangy guitar effects
serve as the basic blueprint for almost every
Medicine song.
That repetition within and between songs
makes the group one of the most pre
dictable, even boring, bands on the alterna
tive scene.
Not only does the instrumental work
prove to be formulaic, it also upstages the in
comprehensible lyrics, which may be the ef
fect the band is looking for. It seems that the
band takes more interest in making "neat,"
searing guitar sounds than in actual song
writing.
But to be fair, their latest release isn't all
that bad. Medicine has improved the sound
displayed on their tedious 1992 debut, "Shot
Forth Self Living."
For starters, they've honed their tech

nique a bit, shortening the length of their
songs from excessive and annoying to mild
ly tolerable. Moreover, there's some sem
blance of lyrics and chorus in a couple of
tunes.
Catchier offerings, like "Something
Goes Wrong" and "Never Click," recall
sounds of popular shoegazer counterparts
Curve and Ride.
The glimpses of vocalist Beth Thomp
son's arc enough to make one wish the
band would write songs that spotlight her
more.
Unfortunately, that seems unlikely. First
and foremost, Medicine showcases screech
ing sounds. While noise-pop bands tend to
drown out vocals, the band lays a grating
buzz in the background, as opposed to the
soothing clang bands like Lush and
Swervcdriver leave behind.
And in more than a few cases, Medicine
let their songs go on for a little too long,
Haunting guitar sounds that anybody with a
guitar and an amplifier could probably
make. It's uncanny, but every Medicine song
still seems five minutes longer than it really
is.
Perhaps it's difficult to appreciate all the
complexities of Medicines unorthodox
sound. But by listening to their music, one
comes to realize there's a reason that some
bands get airplay while others' don't.
