Carlito's Way
Reuniting for the first time since
Scarface," Al Pacino and Brian De
Palma come well-equipped to suc
cessfully challenge Scorsese's
trademark territory of bullets and the
Bronx Strong performances by Pa
cino as ex-con Carlo Brigante and
by Sean Penn as his lawyer provide
a chemistry that carries the movie
past the limits of predictability and
the mob genre. R
A Dangerous Woman
Stricken by a nameless mental dis
ability, Martha Horgan (Debra
Winger) alienates the town with her
actions. Her screwy relationships
with her aunt and a visiting drunk
lead to frequent sex scenes, a vio
lent act and, sadly, boredom More
disturbing is the persistent use of
stereotypes of the disabled and con
stant blurring of the lines between
sex and rape Perhaps the only
thing clear is that" A Dangerous
Woman" is not worth seeing. R
Faraway, So Close
Despite being shot partially in black
and white and containing subtitles
to translate the film's four lan
guages, Wim Wender's brilliant Ger
man movie manages to entertain
while discussing the morality and
corruptibility of humans. Set in a

world where an angel can give up
his divinity to become human once
more and where moral dilemmas
abound, "Faraway, So Close" is a
beautiful, thought-provoking film
that can be seen many times without
losing its intrigue UNRATED
Jamon Jamon
A bizarre tale of ham and passion,
"Jamon Jamon" is the story of a
wealthy woman whose marriage has
lost that lovin' feeling, whose only
son's mind is set on an unsuitable
woman and who is desperately
looking for passion. Deceit, obses
sion and a series of passionate ex
changes mask a discussion of sexu
al maturity. Although the ultimate
profundity of "Jamon Jamon" is
never realized, its tragic elements
coupled with its eroticism keep it
strides ahead of the majority of so
called "sex revelations." UNRATED
Mrs. Doubtfire
Without Robin Williams, this film
would be just another boy-dresses
as-girl-flick He carries it into the
land of almost-innovative entertain
ment — with a serious message just
below the surface. With adequate
support from the rest of the cast
(Sally Field, Pierce Brosnan),
Williams' flick deals with divorce
while always keeping one hand on

the funny bone PG-13
A Perfect World
Relative unknown T.J. Lowther car
ries the day in this star-studded
(Kevin Costner, Clint Eastwood) tale
of personal growth and transforma
tion. Beginning with the kidnapping
of a 7-year-old by a pair of just-es
caped convicts and continuing with
the predictable manhunt, "A Perfect
World" is truly a story of relation
ships — good and evil, criminal and
lawman, and adult and child PG-13
The Piano
The prize piece from Cannes sings
with the performances of Holly
Hunter, Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill
in a masterful tale of beauty and
beasts. Exploring the sexual under
tones to the myth that the Disney
film could only hint at, Jane Campi
on proves her worth as a writer and
director while coloring the rough
grays between good and evil. R
Remains of the Day
Possessed with ineluctable British
reserve, Anthony Hopkins plays a
manservant who suddenly finds his
code of loyalty no longer tenable in
1930s Britain. Hopkins gives an in
credible performance that is self-re
strained in word and deed, but nev
ertheless packed with painfully raw

emotions. "The Remains of the Day
is a wrenching love story, a war
movie and a sympathetic portrait of
a decent though flawed human
being seeking to better his life. PG
Three Musketeers
Retaining only the basic premise
from the literary version of "The
Three Musketeers," Disney's formu
la of cute actors and a Bryan Adams
theme song doesn't work this time
A lack of talent and a horrible
screenplay make us wish the pro
ducers had bothered to read the
book — or that the highlight, the
devious presence of Tim Curry as
Richelieu, would kill the Musketeers
and thereby end our misery. PG
Six Degrees of Separation
This adaptation of John Guare's crit
ically celebrated play "Six Degrees
of Separation" spins out a limitless
line of deception as a young black
man (Will Smith) brings a knife
wound and a bag of lies into the
world of the wealthy But under the
placid face of tall tales lies a compli
cated, homeless, homosexual
drifter. Unfortunately, the film does
not live up to its potential in dis
cussing race and class issues, but
it's more than entertaining in its
demonstration of the nothingness of
purposeless life PG-13
