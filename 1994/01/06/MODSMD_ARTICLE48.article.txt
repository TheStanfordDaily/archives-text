So you didn't quite make it to
"Cliffhanger" or "In the Line of Fire"
last quarter. Don't punish yourself for
past mistakes. There's a whole new list
of films coming to Memorial Audito
rium. It's the time of the quarter when
your RAs come around and say, "Who
wants to buy a Flicks pass?"
From the romantic beginnings of
"Much Ado About Nothing" to the
'70s nostalgia of "Dazed and Con
fused" to the gangster savvy of "Carli
to's Way," there are plenty of distrac
tions for the not-so-dedicated Sunday
night student. Other films include
"True Romance," "The Secret Gar
den" and "Demolition Man."
Flicks passes are $18 for Regular
passes and $14 for Early Show Only
Passes and available from your nearest
RA or in White Plaza between 11 a.m.
and 1 p.m. through tomorrow.
