"Major League" may not be the
fashionable choice in film. It's not
a stylish oldie that has endured
through the decades. It's not an art
house wonder that will make you
ponder deep issues for days after
watching. But it is a great break
from all seriousness.
And watching the Cleveland
Indians team (Corbin Bernsen,
Charlie Sheen) — a group of play

ers so bad they were originally se
lected because of their ability to
bring the team's record down to
the point where no one will come
watch them — struggle to beat
their witch of an owner and come
out on top leaves me with hope for
my own favorite baseball team, the
World Champion Chicago Cubs.
One liners galore don't get stale
on the second or third or 80th

viewing. And the film even con
tains great study tips — where else
can you find the comic book ver
sion of "Moby Dick?"
So while you might not be
ready for a brain vacation right
after winter break, keep "Major
League" in mind for those days
when studying just feels like a se
ries of strikeouts.
