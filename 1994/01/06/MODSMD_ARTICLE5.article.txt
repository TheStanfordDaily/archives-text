# Recycling center stops accepting styrofoam

Due to budget constraints at the
recycling center, the Stanford com
munity will be adding some more
unrecycled waste to trash dumps.
As of Jan. 3, the Stanford Recy
cling Center discontinued recy
cling and picking up polystyrene
plastic. Polystyrene is the plastic
foam used in packaging material or
hard plastic containers, such as yo
gurt containers.
The recycling center — a divi
sion of Peninsula Sanitary Ser
vices, Inc. — is a collection agency
that distributes the recyclable ma
terial to other centers for recycling.
It is no longer handling polystyrene
collection because the hauling and
labor have become too expensive,
according to Heidi Clark, the public
education director of the recycling
center.

The polystyrene collection pro
gram, which began in 1992, al
lowed people who wanted to recycle
polystyrene to drop the foam off at
the center. Clark said it was never
part of the on-campus collection
program.
Polystyrene makes up a small
portion of the entire plastics mar
ket. Type 1 and type 2 plastics,
which are used in products such as
soda bottles and milk jugs, make up
about 75 percent of the plastic mar
ket. These two types will continue
to be handled by the center.
Peninsula Sanitary Service, Inc.
issued the decision to discontinue
the polystyrene collection, and
Clark said she does not think they
will begin the collection again in
the near future. Instead, Clark
said, "people who want to recycle
their polystyrene can bring their

packaging 'peanuts' to mailing
stores in the area to reuse them."
Although the market for
polystyrene is weak now, Clark
said she hopes the market will get
better in time and the recycling
center can include polystyrene as
part of their program.
When polystyrene is recycled,
it is turned into small pellets of
plastic foam which can be used in
packaging.
Besides taking the pellets to

mailing stores, environmentally
conscious people can try to
return their polystyrene. "If
you're going to buy something
like a computer with polystyrene
packaging, you can encourage the
store to take it back and reuse
it," Clark said.
According to the recycling cen
ter, while plastics as a whole
make up only 6 percent to 10 per
cent of municipal solid waste by
weight, they make up 25 percent
to 30 percent of the waste by vol
ume.
Clark said hard plastic
polystyrene will last about 25
years before it biodegrades.
