# Medical student's tuition dispute resolved by donor
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Former Medical School student Selena Chais
son faced an unwelcome holiday surprise when
she found out she would have to pay her final
quarter's tuition â€” even though she planned to
graduate early and not attend that quarter.
But now that an anonymous donor has come
forward to pay for her remaining tuition, the
issue has disappeared from administrators' agen
das.
"This is not the first time that a person has
graduated early," said School of Medicine
spokesperson Don Gibbons, responding to argu
ments that Chaisson should not have had to pay
the $7,305.
He explained that the entire sum must be paid
to graduate because tuition is spread out over all
the quarters in order to make payments easier.
"The 13 quarters represents the full expense," he
said.
Chaisson had been told that
she would not receive her degree
until she paid the bill for the
quarter she would not be attend
ing. This created a problem
because she could not find ade
quate financial aid, and her new
job at a biotechnology firm
requires the degree.
Her problems ended abruptly
when an anonymous person paid
her remaining tuition after

reading about her plight in the
San Jose Mercury News.
Despite Chaisson's argument
that she was being treated
unfairly, the School of Medicine
currently has no plans for
reforming its tuition process.
Changing the policy "hasn't
even been discussed," said Asso
ciate Dean for Student Affairs
Ken Vosti. "Early graduation
does not occur frequently, but
we have experienced few prob
lems up until now."
Early graduation "occurs in
other universities and other
areas [of Stanford] as well,"
Vosti added.
