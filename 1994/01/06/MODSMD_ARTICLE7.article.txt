## 'Bugman' charged with poaching rare butterflies 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Federal agents recently charged Richard J.
Skalski, a Stanford pest control subcontractor,
with conspiring to violate federal wildlife protec
tion laws after he allegedly poached thousands of
rare and endangered butterflies.
Skalski, 38, of Redwood City, and his two con
spirators are scheduled to be arraigned Jan. 20 in
federal court in San Jose. If convicted, the three
men could face up to five years in federal prison,
$250,000 fines and other monetary restitution.
Over a 10-year period, Skalski, Marc L. Grin
nell, 39, of Santa Rosa, and Thomas W. Krai, 29, of
Tucson, Ariz., poached butterflies from public
parks and wildlife refuges in 10 states and Mexico
as part of a plot for trade and profit.
Skalski, who is called "Bugman" by Stanford
co-workers, allegedly used a University green-

house — belonging to Dennis Murphy of the Stan
ford Center for Conservation Biology — to raise
food plants for the butterfly larvae he raised at
home.
A six-month investigation by federal agents re
sulted in the confiscation of 2,200 butterflies from
more than 200 species. Four endangered Bay Area
species — the Mission blue, the San Bruno elfin,
Lange's metalmark and the Bay checkerspot —
were among the confiscated specimens.
Specimens connected to the conspirators were
seized from a handful of institutions, which offi
cials declined to name. Although none of the insti
tutions face charges, they were warned to be more
cautious when purchasing rare specimens in the
future.
Personal letters that were confiscated during
the investigation revealed the elaborate plans that
the three men concocted to ille
gally capture the endangered

butterflies without getting
caught.
In one letter that Skalski
wrote to Krai, he said that he
usually tried to collect specimens
on weekdays because fewer war
dens were on patrol then.
