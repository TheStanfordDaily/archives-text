Plans for a new multi-faith center at Stanford
are in the works as Dean of Memorial Church
Robert Gregg goes on sabbatical for the next six
months to explore the possibilities for such a facili
ty.
Rev. Diana Akiyama will be taking the reins at

the church in the interim.
The multi-faith center, which
Akiyama said is still in the "cre
ation phase," is meant to accommo
date many world religions in one lo
cation, which will be separate from
Memorial Church.
Gregg will begin his work by
tackling ideological issues, analyz
ing which architecture and fea
tures of the center would best in-

corporate the many religions of the world without
alienating different groups, Akiyama said.

Specific details regarding the location, design
and other features of the project are still up in the
air. Gregg could not be reached for comment yes
terday.
For the time being, Akiyama will assume the
dean's responsibilities on top of those she usually
performs as associate dean of Memorial Church.
Additions to her duties will include the organiza
tion of special events such as the Martin Luther
King, Jr. Day celebration and the Baccalaureate, as
well as Sunday worship.
On the whole, business in the church will be
"steady as she goes," Akiyama said, adding that no
major changes will take place in Gregg's absence.
Any urgent situations confronting the church will
be handled by Akiyama during the interim, such as
deaths or unusual misunderstandings in the com
munity.
"We're just continuing things here," Akiyama
said. "We're not planning any major changes, not
in programming — or in refurbishing the office
with chintz furniture."
