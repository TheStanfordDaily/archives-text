"Crisis in Governance:"
A Call for Citizen Leadership
Tony Massengale
Community Organizer
Visiting Mentor to the I laas Center for Public Service
The riots in LA were a crisis in governance which is played out in the "quiet riots" taking place
within institutions across the United States. Response by citizens have ranged from "leaving it to
the government" to take care of confrontational politics that come short of problem-solving.
Massengale will present a third approach that reclaims our role as active citizens.
