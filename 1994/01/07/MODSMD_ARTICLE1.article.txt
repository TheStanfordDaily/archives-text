# Report indicates concerns about Overseas Studies

After hearing the first progress
report on Overseas Studies since
the mid-'Bos, the Faculty Senate
yesterday discussed the prospects
for increasing and diversifying the
number of overseas experiences
for Stanford students.
In his presentation, Overseas
Studies Director Russell Berman
expressed concerns about the dif
ficulties students face in manag
ing study abroad with the exigen
cies of completing requirements
at the home campus.
"Distribution requirements
and major requirements put stu
dents in a bind which prevents
them from taking full advantage
of (overseas studies opportuni
ties]," he said. "I'd like to envision
a situation where the normal
major . . . would be expected — or

nearly expected — to spend some
time at an overseas campus."
Berman called the 10-year peri
od his report examined a "mixed
story," stressing that while the
program has become more "glob
al" with the opening of new cen
ters in Japan and Latin America,
budget cuts have forced the Uni
versity to scale back or eliminate
programs in other regions.
The report showed that the
total capacity of Stanford's over
seas centers has decreased by
more than 200 "student quarters"
—• the number of total terms spent
by students abroad — since 1984,
the result of both intended consol
idation of similar programs and
unforeseen cuts in funding.
The Florence program, for in
stance, was reduced by 70 student
quarters last year. "We shouldn't
fool ourselves that we can provide
programs of the same size with
those kinds of cuts," Berman said.
He also suggested that the Uni
versity should "rethink exactly what
takes place at overseas campuses,"
arguing that foreign centers should
increase emphasis on research for
both students and faculty.
While Berman downplayed the
relevance of speculating on the
location of the next center, he did
say the University "should have
sites where [Stanford] has a broad

and deep interest in the area." He
said that among the most promi
nent proposed new sites are in
Africa and Eastern Europe, but
"by far the most pronounced"
interest is in a Chinese program.
Also during yesterday's meet
ing, University President Gerhard
Casper confirmed that the Task
Force on Strategic Planning for the
Medical Center will reconvene on
Jan. 17 to "iron out any remaining
conflicts and solve additional prob
lems, and try to put forward a pro
posal that can go to the Board of
Trustees in early February."
Casper said the task force —
which he chairs — will consolidate
the findings of six working groups

which examined a blueprint for
restructuring the operations of the
Medical Center.
The president said that the
"broad scheme" of the working
groups' reports are "not all that
different" from the general pro
posals put forth by the task force
last June, but pointed out that
there may still be overlooked
details that might only come to
light "upon implementation."
The senate also heard the annu
al report from the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid, and focused its
response on issues of affirmative
action and recruitment and yield
of top academic applicants.

Political Science Prof. Stephen
Krasner questioned Dean of
Undergraduate Admissions James
Montoya about the disparity
between the representation of
some ethnic groups at Stanford in
relation to their total population in
society.
"If you compare undergradu
ates at Stanford with the general
population, the most underrepre
sented group is whites . . . [while]
Asians and Jews are very overrep
resented," he said, pointing out
that the proportions of blacks,
Chicanos and Native Americans at
Stanford roughly correspond with
their general representation.
While accepting Krasner's

statistics, Montoya countered by
arguing that the changing percent
age of high school graduates by
ethnic group, as well as stronger
Asian performance on the SATs
explain the relative decline in white
student population. Citing the
decline of white high school gradu
ates in California from 62.2 per
cent to 48 percent in the last eight
years, Montoya said, "The majority
is in fact the minority at this
point."
Other senators directed their
inquiries to the issue of Stanford's
ability to compete with other uni
versities for the highest-rated high
school students. Biology Prof.
Robert Simoni asked Robert Huff,

director of the Financial Aids Office,
whether other universities offer
students merit-based aid packages.
While Huff said Harvard, Yale,
Princeton and MIT — Stanford's
principal competitors — do not
offer such incentives, Montoya
said Stanford is losing students to
other institutions, like Duke and
Swarthmore, that do. Casper
seized this opportunity to suggest
that the University rethink its
recruitment strategy.
"There is no question that com
petition for students will continue
to increase he said. "We do go out
to recruit athletes. We should
recruit just as actively a whole
range of other students."
