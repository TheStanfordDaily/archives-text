# Zhirinovsky angered after Clinton refuses meeting

SHCHELKOVO, Russia (AP) -
Bad Vlad is mad. He's being snubbed
by yet another world leader. This time
it's President Clinton.
Russian extreme nationalist
Vladimir Zhirinovsky called Clinton a
coward yesterday for refusing to meet
him when he comes to a summit in
Moscow next week.
Zhirinovsky said Clinton should
stay home and play the sax instead of
coming to Moscow.
Zhirinovsky also threatened Japan
with a blockade, said France and Ger
many were "sucking up" to Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, and called the

West "rotten and moldy."
For good measure, he outlined his
plan to become foreign minister.
It was a vintage performance by the
bad boy of Russian politics, a man
whose views have provoked compar
isons to Hitler and Mussolini.
Once dismissed as a clown, Zhiri
novsky is now viewed with deepening
alarm. His Liberal Democratic Party
was the top vote-getter in December's
parliamentary elections.
Clinton's snub comes while Zhiri
novsky still smarts from a disastrous
post-election world tour.
U.S. officials have made it clear

Clinton will not meet Zhirinovsky dur
ing the Jan. 12-15 summit in Moscow.
"What kind of American president
is he?" Zhirinovsky fumed. "He's com
ing and he's not going to meet with
me? Let him play his saxophone
instead of coming here and meeting
with nobodies!"
Zhirinovsky also lumped French
President Francois Mitterrand and
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl with
Clinton as being cowards.
"All of you in the West have become
rotten and moldy. That's why you got
scared that a new, honest, brave man
has emerged in Russia," he groused.

"You want us to be weak and rot with
you. But we won't. Rot without us!"
Zhirinovsky capped his impromptu
news conference by outlining his par
liamentary strategy. With 65 out of
450 seats, his party is the second
largest faction, next to the pro-Yeltsin
Russia's Choice bloc.
"We'll take the foreign relations
committee and I'll be chairman," he
said. Next, "there will be a new foreign
minister. Me."
Theoretically, the president names
the foreign minister — not parlia
ment. But Zhirinovsky envisions a
new, more relaxed role for Yeltsin.
