Giving power to the people.
This is what Cowell Student
Health Center decided to do
recently in its substance-abuse pre
vention program, taking a refresh
ing approach to a menacing prob
lem.
The new program, called the Stan
ford Community Partnership, recog
nizes that there are differences in
alcohol and drug experiences within
various campus groups, and that cam
pus-wide programs may approach the
problem of substance abuse too gener
ally.
It will allocate funds to certain
groups for tackling alcohol and drug
abuse in ways that are most relevant
to their communities.
Funded by a federal grant of
$147,000 over two years, this program
follows a model set forth by the U.S.
Department of Education.
Formerly, Cowell's programs —
such as the Party Pros alcohol advis
ing sessions — served many campus
groups, but were of little use to oth
ers, such as African-American frater
nities which don't serve alcohol at

parties.
The new program enables 10 com
munity groups — ethnic organiza
tions, the Athletics Department, the
Disability Resource Center and
sororities and fraternities, among
others — to target their own prob
lems, take into account their own
experiences and prescribe well
defined solutions. And it encourages
innovation. It is laudable in all these
respects.
Indeed, with the nation banging its
head against the wall in search of any
way to alleviate drug and alcohol
abuse among young people, the feder
al grant program signals a turn in a
positive direction.
Now the responsibility as well as
the power rests with the students
involved in these groups to take
advantage of such a malleable pro
gram and make a real impact with
it.
The new program offers a clean
slate for each student group to enlist
the solutions that suit its members
best. The idea is certainly simple, but
the impact could be strong.
