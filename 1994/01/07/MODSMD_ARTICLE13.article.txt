# Remembrances of King

### 
TWENTY-SIX years ago, a bul
let ended the life of Martin
Luther King Jr. However, as
with all great men, the memory of
King — and his legacy — promise to
live on.
This week, several events in and
around the Stanford campus will com
memorate King's birthday and honor
the spirit and works of the civil rights
leader.
These events should be afforded the
respect and attention they are due by
all Stanford students, faculty and
staff.
All too often, commemorative ser
vices and memorials are overlooked, as
the public does not necessarily recog
nize the events' personal impact upon
their lives.
But the Rev. King's spirit — his
sense of liberty, freedom and tolerance
— underlies our American psyche in
untold ways, and affects every citizen,
every day. This fact can be better
understood by taking part in the
week's activities.
Studying both the words and
works of King can provide valuable

lessons for our lives and our coun
try's future.
The opportunity for all members of
the Stanford community to learn more
about King's life and works is a valu
able one.
The University's commemoration
of King's life will begin this Sunday
with a public worship service at
Memorial Church. Programs will con
tinue throughout the week with cul
tural celebrations, speeches, panel dis
cussions and other events before con
cluding Monday, Jan. 17, with a pro
gram entitled, "A Celebration of the
Life and Legacy of Martin Luther
King Jr."
The University administration
has devoted great attention to the
upcoming events; President Gerhard
Casper and Provost Condoleezza
Rice will take part in the Jan. 17 pro
duction.
These services and the University's
long-term commitment to the spirit of
Dr. King through its unique Martin
Luther King Papers Project are both
honorable tokens of respect for one of
the nation's great leaders.
