## Schindler should not be judged by Spielberg's portrayal 
### 
I WOULD LIKE to respond to N'Gai
Croal's Jan. 4 column, in which he
criticized Steven Spielberg's latest
release, "Schindler's List" for being
overly sympathetic to a man who, N'Gai
says, simply "used Jews to make a profit
on the war ... to collect his thirty pieces
of silver," indirectly advancing the Nazi
cause.
In the summer of 1992, I met Leopold
Pfefferberg, one of the thousand-plus
Jews who had been on Oskar Schindler's
list. It was from him that I first heard
the story of Schindler's actions during
the war.
Pfefferberg said that although
Schindler made ample earnings and
lucrative deals in wartime, he was left, in
1946, a pauper. Pfefferberg recalled that
in Schindler's armaments factory, "we
never made a goddamn thing," let alone,

as N'Gai noted, any armaments which
worked, and the factory cost Schindler
more to maintain than it ever returned
to him.
All that Schindler took away with him
when he left the Sudetenland camp at
the war's end was quickly stolen by occu
pying Russian soldiers.
When Pfefferherg finally located
Schindler in Germany after the war, he
found that Schindler "didn't have a
buck to buy a pack of cigarettes,"
because many Germans regarded
Schindler as a traitor and refused to do
business with him.
In his later life, Schindler depended
for his sustenance primarily on the Jews
for whom he had provided sustenance
during the war, living with them in their
homes and working at the jobs they pro
cured for him.

As for N'Gai's argument that the
enamelware factory which Schindler
owned during the first part of the war
contributed to the Reich's efforts,
Thomas Keneally writes in his book
"Schindler's List" (on which the movie is
based) that many of Schindler's workers
in the Plaszow concentration camp
labored hard to make Schindler's facto
ry, as well as all industries in Plaszow,
profitable and efficient.
The prisoners knew that any concen
tration camp whose production and peo
ple were not seen as "necessary" to the
war effort was quickly closed down, in
which case all prisoners would be marked
for the Auschwitz crematoriums.
Schindler's workers were more than
willing to contribute to his profits; the
relationship between Schindler and his
employees differed greatly from that

between Thomas Jefferson and his
slaves, with which N'Gai compares it.
I realize that Spielberg's film neglects
to dramatize these facts, and N'Gai's
criticism, addressing only Spielberg's
representation of Schindler's story, is
perfectly valid. However, when a person
is portrayed as a film character, he
should not be deemed a hero or a
scoundrel based on what the character
does or fails to do.
Schindler may have been less than
the savior Spielberg makes him out to
be, but Pfefferberg's and other sur
vivors' accounts show him to be more
than the exploitative profiteer that
N'Gai's column implies he was. In
Schindler's case, there was more to the
man than meets the moviegoer's eye.
