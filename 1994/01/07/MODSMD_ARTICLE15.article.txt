## Serving the Apple master 
### 
BACK IN the Fifties, the movies
told us that robots were going to
rule America. These days, sci-fi
writers predict that virtual reality and
supercomputers will control our
minds.
Computers will turn our measly little
brains into mush and make us slaves to
their technological tyranny.
Sounds good to me. At least that way,
someone would be in charge.
You see, this winter break I had a
small revelation. People are dumb.
(Don't go getting all upset — of course I
didn't mean YOU.)
This struck me as I was driving south
on 1-5 and crossed the Oregon-Califor
nia border. A few miles into this great
state, the road veered off to the "Fruit
check Station," which they set up during
the med-fly scare. I think it's actually an
employment program for terminally
cocky cop wannabes, but that's okay.
I pulled the Volvo up to the guy in the
khaki outfit and tried to look as suspi
cious as possible.
I made my eyes shifty and when he
asked if 1 was carrying any fruit I
replied, "Fruit? What fruit? What makes
you think that I would have any peaches
and grapes in my trunk?" He gaped at
me like a dead trout and then told me to
enjoy my stay in California.
You gotta love bureaucrats.
I drove along, feeling pretty superi
or. Somewhere around Redding,

though, I realized I am no more of a
free thinker than my fruit-checking
friend. His brain was sucked by the
government employment office, but
mine has met with a worse fate. My
perceptions have been dulled and my
independence shackled — I am a Mac
intosh zombie.

I used to pride myself on
being computer illiterate
or, as I prefer to call it,
"computer innocent."
Those days slipped away,
though, at Stanford. Slow
ly, imperceptibly, Apple
took over my brain.

The way I see it, all those predictions
of computers running the world are not
that far off. After all, our campus is
already run by Apple Computers.
It's gotten to the point that I can't
think without a mouse in my hand.
I used to pride myself on being com
puter illiterate or, as I prefer to call it,
"computer innocent " Those days
slipped away, though, at Stanford.

Slowly, imperceptibly, Apple took
over my brain. Professors e-mailed
homework assignments, TA's demanded
Word 5 formats, the computer cluster
was the only place where we'd be sure
not to run into our RCC — I was thrown
in with Macs and by the time I realized
what was happening, it was too late.
Once, when I accused the computers
of being too powerful, the cluster Mac
deleted my file as punishment. Resis
tance is futile.
I have come to accept this dependen
cy. 1 now believe that spellcheck can Qx
anything in my life and that Tetris is a
legitimate hobby.
This is good; this is peace. The com
puters will take over anyway, so we
might as well learn to comply.
There are a few holdouts, of course.
Artists, the occasional poet, grandpar
ents who still haven't gotten used to
color TV and other such wackos think
they can lead perfectly happy lives with
out computers. Rut they're wrong.
It won't be hard to build a computer
that is smarter than we are and hopeful
ly it will do a better job.

Kathleen would like to dedicate this col
umn to the memory of her typewriter
Lizzy.
