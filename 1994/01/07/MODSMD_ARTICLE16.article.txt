## Casa de Fruta — a place where dreams come true 
### 
LIFE DOESN'T get any better thun
this. I here I was, there I was, there
I was, in the Congo. OK, OK, it
wasn t the Congo, but it was a scenic
locale. OK, OK, it wasn't a scenic locale
either, but it was exciting. OK, OK, so it
wasn't exciting — to anyone but me.
Shut up and tell the story.
It was the Pacheco Pass. Your generic
stretch of asphalt along Highway 158,
winding past Gilroy, the garlic capital of
the free world — where barren mountains
wreak havoc on radio reception, the last,
clinging solace of the long-distance driver.

But there I was, like a small chihuahua,
nuzzling the upper-right-hand corner of
my passenger-side window. Pressing my
nose against the cold glass, yip-yipping at
the driver in excitement. Wagging my tail
with glee at the sign up ahead.
World-famous cup flipper.
Did you see that? World-famous, it
said. Must be good. Good? Heck, must be
great. Reaching international quality
standards decided by old men with
Havana cigars in some Geneva hotel,
while pencil-necked college grads power

lobby the latest, greatest wonders of the
world. Twenty-foot balls of yarn and
impaled Cadillacs.
A 20-ton block of cheese? I like it!
Every winter break I latch on like an
infectious parasite to some unsuspecting,
car-wielding victim, to get down to —
promising not to bring too much luggage,
my drink-the-whole-bottle-of-Clorox Cure
tape collection or any semi-automatic
weapons for tomato truck hunting.
I usually can sit kinda still. I don't go
channel surfing on the radio without per
mission. I'm willing to share my Doritos
with my carmates. I don't wet the bed,
scream for my mommy during Tuli fog
conditions, take ofT my shoes and press
my moist socks to the cheek of the driver,
or make dumb jokes when passing Coalin
ga's cattle ranches.
Ooh, shouldn'ta ate so many Doritos.
But Casa de Fruta is my weakness. I
see the eternally flipping cup sign some
where an hour south of Stanford, and my
eyes go glossy, my pulse races, my nipples
get hard. I've passed the sign a million
times. I've passed Casa de Fruta Parkway

a million times. A million trips and one
million single tears sliding slowly down
the cheek my companion cannot see as I
watch the Casa de Gas Station sign get
smaller and smaller in the side mirror.
Each time I tug on the pant leg of the
driver, begging to go. Each time I make
laundry and vacuuming promises I can
not keep. Each time I tiy to forcefully con
vey just how genuinely I want to go.
I don't need it, man, I just want it.
But it never works. First, the ex
boyfriend thought I was just kidding,
cruising on past. Then the ex-friend with
a 4x4 promised we could go, but veered
from the off-ramp leading to the Mecca of
Central Valley fruitdom back to the high
way, breaking my heart.
Finally someone honestly vowed to take
me, when icy conditions on Highway 5
forced us to take Highway 101 up the Cal
ifornia coast, leaving me choosing from 10
different kinds of pretzels for dinner in
Little Denmark, when I could've been sip
ping Casa de Wine's nectar of the gods.
Alas, poor Yorrick.
This year, with god as my witness, I

would show no shame whatsoever in my
quest for nirvamc enlightenment. Extolling
the undying sentiment encapsulated in a
fruit and pistachio pack lovingly wrapped
for his tuition-paying parents. Lecturing on
the parallel between Steinbeck's "Grapes of
Wrath" and those people found cavorting in
California's rest-stops today.
I hadn't even gotten to the part about
postmodernism at work when god
touched me softly on the head, telling me
it would be so. My friend would take me. I
would see Casa de Fruta in this lifetime. I
would come to know just what, why, who,
or where this cup-flipper was.
All that stuff about my firstborn, I was
just joking.
There they were, Casa de Deli, Casa de
Sweets and the Casa de Fruta diner itself,
waiting for me as I stepped out of the car,
like old friends, patting me on the back
and drawing me to their bosoms. It was all
I could have hoped. Cheesy place mats
telling the story of the uncle of the Casa
de Fruta family. Big waitresses with big
hair. Olive drab and brown decor comple
menting the vile food and flat Diet Coke.

And as the old man toting the coffee
pots — tastefully matching royal blue and
navy blue polyester — approached, I
leaned forward, ready to ask him where
the cup-flipper could be found. He stood
before me, a halo of light outlining his
divinely-unsvelte frame, brilliantly exe
cuting a double reverse flip of my coffee
cup with the saucer.
If you flip it, they will come.
I sat, legs sticking to the grungy Nau
gahyde, mouth agape. I watched him cir
cle the room several times, executing dif
ferent levels of cup-flipping perfection,
realizing that for once in my life, I had
found a dream realized. A desire
quenched. A flip of his wrist and a chapter
in the cheap supermarket bodice-ripper of
my life was closed.
Fill it to the rim.

Tish would like to pledge her undying
gratitude to the man who took her all the
way — to Casa de Fruta.

ping Casa de Wine's nectar of the gods.
Alas, poor Yorrick.
This year, with god as my witness, I

would show no shame whatsoever in my
quest for nirvamc enlightenment. Extolling
the undying sentiment encapsulated in a
fruit and pistachio pack lovingly wrapped
for his tuition-paying parents. Lecturing on
the parallel between Steinbeck's "Grapes of
Wrath" and those people found cavorting in
California's rest-stops today.
I hadn't even gotten to the part about
postmodernism at work when god
touched me softly on the head, telling me
it would be so. My friend would take me. I
would see Casa de Fruta in this lifetime. I
would come to know just what, why, who,
or where this cup-flipper was.
All that stuff about my firstborn, I was
just joking.
There they were, Casa de Deli, Casa de
Sweets and the Casa de Fruta diner itself,
waiting for me as I stepped out of the car,
like old friends, patting me on the back
and drawing me to their bosoms. It was all
I could have hoped. Cheesy place mats
telling the story of the uncle of the Casa
de Fruta family. Big waitresses with big
hair. Olive drab and brown decor comple
menting the vile food and flat Diet Coke.

And as the old man toting the coffee
pots — tastefully matching royal blue and
navy blue polyester — approached, I
leaned forward, ready to ask him where
the cup-flipper could be found. He stood
before me, a halo of light outlining his
divinely-unsvelte frame, brilliantly exe
cuting a double reverse flip of my coffee
cup with the saucer.
If you flip it, they will come.
I sat, legs sticking to the grungy Nau
gahyde, mouth agape. I watched him cir
cle the room several times, executing dif
ferent levels of cup-flipping perfection,
realizing that for once in my life, I had
found a dream realized. A desire
quenched. A flip of his wrist and a chapter
in the cheap supermarket bodice-ripper of
my life was closed.
Fill it to the rim.

Tish would like to pledge her undying
gratitude to the man who took her all the
way — to Casa de Fruta.

LIFE DOESN'T get any better thun
this. I here I was, there I was, there
I was, in the Congo. OK, OK, it
wasn t the Congo, but it was a scenic
locale. OK, OK, it wasn't a scenic locale
either, but it was exciting. OK, OK, so it
wasn't exciting — to anyone but me.
Shut up and tell the story.
It was the Pacheco Pass. Your generic
stretch of asphalt along Highway 158,
winding past Gilroy, the garlic capital of
the free world — where barren mountains
wreak havoc on radio reception, the last,
clinging solace of the long-distance driver.

But there I was, like a small chihuahua,
nuzzling the upper-right-hand corner of
my passenger-side window. Pressing my
nose against the cold glass, yip-yipping at
the driver in excitement. Wagging my tail
with glee at the sign up ahead.
World-famous cup flipper.
Did you see that? World-famous, it
said. Must be good. Good? Heck, must be
great. Reaching international quality
standards decided by old men with
Havana cigars in some Geneva hotel,
while pencil-necked college grads power

lobby the latest, greatest wonders of the
world. Twenty-foot balls of yarn and
impaled Cadillacs.
A 20-ton block of cheese? I like it!
Every winter break I latch on like an
infectious parasite to some unsuspecting,
car-wielding victim, to get down to —
promising not to bring too much luggage,
my drink-the-whole-bottle-of-Clorox Cure
tape collection or any semi-automatic
weapons for tomato truck hunting.
I usually can sit kinda still. I don't go
channel surfing on the radio without per
mission. I'm willing to share my Doritos
with my carmates. I don't wet the bed,
scream for my mommy during Tuli fog
conditions, take ofT my shoes and press
my moist socks to the cheek of the driver,
or make dumb jokes when passing Coalin
ga's cattle ranches.
Ooh, shouldn'ta ate so many Doritos.
But Casa de Fruta is my weakness. I
see the eternally flipping cup sign some
where an hour south of Stanford, and my
eyes go glossy, my pulse races, my nipples
get hard. I've passed the sign a million
times. I've passed Casa de Fruta Parkway

a million times. A million trips and one
million single tears sliding slowly down
the cheek my companion cannot see as I
watch the Casa de Gas Station sign get
smaller and smaller in the side mirror.
Each time I tug on the pant leg of the
driver, begging to go. Each time I make
laundry and vacuuming promises I can
not keep. Each time I tiy to forcefully con
vey just how genuinely I want to go.
I don't need it, man, I just want it.
But it never works. First, the ex
boyfriend thought I was just kidding,
cruising on past. Then the ex-friend with
a 4x4 promised we could go, but veered
from the off-ramp leading to the Mecca of
Central Valley fruitdom back to the high
way, breaking my heart.
Finally someone honestly vowed to take
me, when icy conditions on Highway 5
forced us to take Highway 101 up the Cal
ifornia coast, leaving me choosing from 10
different kinds of pretzels for dinner in
Little Denmark, when I could've been sip
ping Casa de Wine's nectar of the gods.
