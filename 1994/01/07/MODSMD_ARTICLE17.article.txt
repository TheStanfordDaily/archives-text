## Stanford bitten Washington State upsets No. 9 Cardinal in a 78-61 shootout 
### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
No 8-2 teams entered Seattle's
Hec Edmundson Pavilion for last
night's women's basketball game
between Stanford and Washing
ton. Unfortunately for the Cardi
nal, no 8-2 teams left the arena
afler the contest, either.
In the Pacific 10 Conference
opener for both squads, ninth
ranked Stanford (7-3, 0-1 in the
Pac-10) failed to match records
with its opponent and saw a six
game winning streak snapped
78-61 at the hands of the No. 22
Huskies (9-1, 1-0), who ran their
own streak to eight.
While Washington seized con
trol early and never trailed, the
story of the game lay in Stan
ford's poor shooting and execu
tion. Undoubtedly feeling jittery
in its first out-of-state road game
since Nov. 29, the Cardinal shot
an abysmal 39 percent (20-of
-51), to go along with an equally
pathetic 61 percent (19-of-31)
from the free-throw stripe.
However, the Huskies failed
to capitalize on Stanford's inac
curacy, suffering from 44 per
cent (30-of-68) field-goal shoot
ing woes of their own and gain
ing the advantage only because
of the extra chances afforded by
a 22 offensive rebounds.
The Huskies' lead hovered in
the six-to-eight point range for

much of the first half, yet the
Cardinal closed to within 36-33
at the break on the hot hand of
junior forward Rachel Hemmer,
who would contribute all nine of
her points before foul trouble
limited her second-half minutes.
Immediately following the inter
mission, freshman guard Jamila
Wideman, who had made all
three of her first-half shots for
six of her 10 points, made a layup
that cut Stanford's deficit to a
scant point.
That was as close as the Car
dinal would get, however, as
Washington junior guard Katia
Foucade enjoyed a prolific 14-
point second period and the
Huskies extended their advan
tage to double figures (53-43)
with eight minutes remaining
and never looked back.
The Cardinal must now
regroup from last night's disap
pointment and take care of busi
ness tomorrow night against the
Washington State Cougars.
Fresh oft' a surprising victory
over California last night, the
Cougars (6-4) return two
starters — 6-foot-2 senior center
Camille Thompson and 5-11
swingman Jenni Ruff — from a
team that finished 3-15 in Pac
-10 play en route to a 7-20 season
in 1992-93.
Tomorrow night's action
begins at 7 p.m., and may be
heard on KZSU (90.1 FM).
