# Despite slow start, breaststroker is on fast track to swimming success
## Grote leaves others in his wake

Among the members of the Stan
ford men's swimming team, asth
matism is not a unique condition.
Many of the athletes got their begin
nings in the sport when a doctor
advised swimming as good therapy
for their asthma.
But no one on the team received
and took that advice as recently as
Kurt Grote. Many of the world's
elite swimmers began their compet
itive careers at the ages of eight or
nine, some even earlier. Grote took
up swimming at his doctor's advice
in his sophomore year of high
school.
"Kurt's case is very unusual,"
said coach Skip Kenney. "Very few
people start that late and make this
big of an impact on this level. Kurt is
one of the most focused athletes I've
ever had come through this pro
gram. Kurt gathers new informa
tion, does the extra things. He's tal
ented and has the dedication to go
above and beyond."
Grote, a junior from Encinitas,
Calif., attributes his desire to his
continuous search for ways to
improve upon his late start in the
sport.
"I'm still open to learning how to
swim," he said. "Because I haven't
been swimming for that long, I'm
not set in old ways. I like learning
new ways."
In just his sixth year of competi
tive swimming, Grote has become
one of the premier breaststrokers in
the nation. Last month at the
Speedo Cup in Southern California,
he grabbed a spot in Stanford's
record book by eclipsing an eight

year-old record in his specialty, the
200-yard breaststroke.
"When I came to Stanford I saw
the record, 1:55.96, and I thought I
could do it," Grote said. "I knew
where it was, and thought I'd have a
good chance at it this year. It was
sort of a goal coming in."
Not only did his time of 1 minute,
55.51 seconds best the school record

held by two-time Olympian John
Moflet, but Grote's early-season
effort was faster than Michigan's
Eric Wunderlich's winning time of
1:55.55 at the 1993 NCAA Champi
onships. Grote finished third in that
race, behind Wunderlich and Cardi
nal teammate Tyler Mayfield.
"Kurt was leading after the first
150 yards," Kenney recalled. "His

lack of experience cost him in the
last 50. That's what he's been work
ing on for his 200."
Grote also hopes to improve his
NCAA finish in the 100-yard breast
stroke after finishing eighth in
1993.

splashing onto the scene six years ago.
