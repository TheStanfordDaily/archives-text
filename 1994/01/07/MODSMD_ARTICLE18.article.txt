# Despite slow start, breaststroker is on fast track to swimming success
## Grote leaves others in his wake 
### Kyle Utsumi StafT writer 
Among the members of the Stan
ford men's swimming team, asth
matism is not a unique condition.
Many of the athletes got their begin
nings in the sport when a doctor
advised swimming as good therapy
for their asthma.
But no one on the team received
and took that advice as recently as
Kurt Grote. Many of the world's
elite swimmers began their compet
itive careers at the ages of eight or
nine, some even earlier. Grote took
up swimming at his doctor's advice
in his sophomore year of high
school.
"Kurt's case is very unusual,"
said coach Skip Kenney. "Very few
people start that late and make this
big of an impact on this level. Kurt is
one of the most focused athletes I've
ever had come through this pro
gram. Kurt gathers new informa
tion, does the extra things. He's tal
ented and has the dedication to go
above and beyond."
Grote, a junior from Encinitas,
Calif., attributes his desire to his
continuous search for ways to
improve upon his late start in the
sport.
"I'm still open to learning how to
swim," he said. "Because I haven't
been swimming for that long, I'm
not set in old ways. I like learning
new ways."
In just his sixth year of competi
tive swimming, Grote has become
one of the premier breaststrokers in
the nation. Last month at the
Speedo Cup in Southern California,
he grabbed a spot in Stanford's
record book by eclipsing an eight

year-old record in his specialty, the
200-yard breaststroke.
"When I came to Stanford I saw
the record, 1:55.96, and I thought I
could do it," Grote said. "I knew
where it was, and thought I'd have a
good chance at it this year. It was
sort of a goal coming in."
Not only did his time of 1 minute,
55.51 seconds best the school record

held by two-time Olympian John
Moflet, but Grote's early-season
effort was faster than Michigan's
Eric Wunderlich's winning time of
1:55.55 at the 1993 NCAA Champi
onships. Grote finished third in that
race, behind Wunderlich and Cardi
nal teammate Tyler Mayfield.
"Kurt was leading after the first
150 yards," Kenney recalled. "His

lack of experience cost him in the
last 50. That's what he's been work
ing on for his 200."
Grote also hopes to improve his
NCAA finish in the 100-yard breast
stroke after finishing eighth in
1993.

Breaststroker Kurt Grote comes up for air during practice. The junior has not taken a breather since
splashing onto the scene six years ago.
"Usually we associate fast with
powerful," Kenney said. "Kurt is an
artist. He turns his power into artis
tic ability. His 200 is outstanding
because he knows how to move
water and eliminate resistance. His
100 will get better."
Whatever improvement he sees

throughout the season, Grote will
no doubt give credit to his team
mates for consistently challenging
him to work harder.
"Here in training there are
always people to race and motivate
you," he continued. "There's more
of a team go;il. The most important
things are the team goals for the end
of the year."
Another plus for Grote is the
opportunity to train with some of
the best breaststrokers in collegiate
swimming in Tyler Mayfield (1993

NCAA champion in the 100 breast),
J.J. Freitag and Bryan Addleman.
"In training, we split into differ
ent groups," Grote said. "Some
times we swim with the other
breaststrokers and get to work on
technique. You get a lot of feedback.
That positive feedback is good dur
ing a hard set, when the guys with
you are going through the same
thing you are."
Because of a mistake, Grote
arrived at Stanford without Kenney
ever having seen him swim breast

stroke.
"I was down in San Diego to
meet Kurt and his family, and his
high school coach had forgotten to
enter him in the breaststroke,"
Kenney said. "So all he was able to
swim was the 50 free. But I was
impressed with Kurt as a person,
and I thought 'I want to have him
on my team.' He fits my definition
of a great athlete, because everyone
else around him gets better."
As the defending Pacific 10 Con
ference champion and record-holder

in the 200 breast, Grote will no
doubt help the Cardinal in their
quest for a 13th-consecutive league
title.
But his main goals involve the
NCAA Championships in late
March, where Stanford will seek its
third straight national crown.
"I think we can go one-two in
both of the breaststrokes," Grote
said. "And we also stand a chance to
get three or four people in both
breaststroke finals."
Kenney is confident that Grote

will perform and wonders just how
much of his talent he has tapped so
far.
"He's pretty good now, but he's
just starting to scratch the surface,"
Kenney said. "I think he's got some
good years ahead of him. He got a
late start, so maybe he can stay in
the sport longer than the average
age."
At the rate Grote has been racing
these days, a late start may be the
only thing that keeps the competi
tion from chasing him to the walls.

J.J. Freitag and Bryan Addleman.
"In training, we split into differ
ent groups," Grote said. "Some
times we swim with the other
breaststrokers and get to work on
technique. You get a lot of feedback.
That positive feedback is good dur
ing a hard set, when the guys with
you are going through the same
thing you are."
Because of a mistake, Grote
arrived at Stanford without Kenney
ever having seen him swim breast

stroke.
"I was down in San Diego to
meet Kurt and his family, and his
high school coach had forgotten to
enter him in the breaststroke,"
Kenney said. "So all he was able to
swim was the 50 free. But I was
impressed with Kurt as a person,
and I thought 'I want to have him
on my team.' He fits my definition
of a great athlete, because everyone
else around him gets better."
As the defending Pacific 10 Con
ference champion and record-holder

in the 200 breast, Grote will no
doubt help the Cardinal in their
quest for a 13th-consecutive league
title.
But his main goals involve the
NCAA Championships in late
March, where Stanford will seek its
third straight national crown.
"I think we can go one-two in
both of the breaststrokes," Grote
said. "And we also stand a chance to
get three or four people in both
breaststroke finals."
Kenney is confident that Grote

will perform and wonders just how
much of his talent he has tapped so
far.
"He's pretty good now, but he's
just starting to scratch the surface,"
Kenney said. "I think he's got some
good years ahead of him. He got a
late start, so maybe he can stay in
the sport longer than the average
age."
At the rate Grote has been racing
these days, a late start may be the
only thing that keeps the competi
tion from chasing him to the walls.
Among the members of the Stan
ford men's swimming team, asth
matism is not a unique condition.
Many of the athletes got their begin
nings in the sport when a doctor
advised swimming as good therapy
for their asthma.
But no one on the team received
and took that advice as recently as
Kurt Grote. Many of the world's
elite swimmers began their compet
itive careers at the ages of eight or
nine, some even earlier. Grote took
up swimming at his doctor's advice
in his sophomore year of high
school.
"Kurt's case is very unusual,"
said coach Skip Kenney. "Very few
people start that late and make this
big of an impact on this level. Kurt is
one of the most focused athletes I've
ever had come through this pro
gram. Kurt gathers new informa
tion, does the extra things. He's tal
ented and has the dedication to go
above and beyond."
Grote, a junior from Encinitas,
Calif., attributes his desire to his
continuous search for ways to
improve upon his late start in the
sport.
"I'm still open to learning how to
swim," he said. "Because I haven't
been swimming for that long, I'm
not set in old ways. I like learning
new ways."
In just his sixth year of competi
tive swimming, Grote has become
one of the premier breaststrokers in
the nation. Last month at the
Speedo Cup in Southern California,
he grabbed a spot in Stanford's
record book by eclipsing an eight

year-old record in his specialty, the
200-yard breaststroke.
"When I came to Stanford I saw
the record, 1:55.96, and I thought I
could do it," Grote said. "I knew
where it was, and thought I'd have a
good chance at it this year. It was
sort of a goal coming in."
Not only did his time of 1 minute,
55.51 seconds best the school record

held by two-time Olympian John
Moflet, but Grote's early-season
effort was faster than Michigan's
Eric Wunderlich's winning time of
1:55.55 at the 1993 NCAA Champi
onships. Grote finished third in that
race, behind Wunderlich and Cardi
nal teammate Tyler Mayfield.
"Kurt was leading after the first
150 yards," Kenney recalled. "His

lack of experience cost him in the
last 50. That's what he's been work
ing on for his 200."
Grote also hopes to improve his
NCAA finish in the 100-yard breast
stroke after finishing eighth in
1993.

Breaststroker Kurt Grote comes up for air during practice. The junior has not taken a breather since
splashing onto the scene six years ago.
"Usually we associate fast with
powerful," Kenney said. "Kurt is an
artist. He turns his power into artis
tic ability. His 200 is outstanding
because he knows how to move
water and eliminate resistance. His
100 will get better."
Whatever improvement he sees

throughout the season, Grote will
no doubt give credit to his team
mates for consistently challenging
him to work harder.
"Here in training there are
always people to race and motivate
you," he continued. "There's more
of a team go;il. The most important
things are the team goals for the end
of the year."
Another plus for Grote is the
opportunity to train with some of
the best breaststrokers in collegiate
swimming in Tyler Mayfield (1993

NCAA champion in the 100 breast),
J.J. Freitag and Bryan Addleman.
"In training, we split into differ
ent groups," Grote said. "Some
