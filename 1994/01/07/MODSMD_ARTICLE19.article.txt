# Hoopsters harass hapless Huskies
## Men improve to 8-2 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
Welcome to the Pacific 10 Con
ference, boys.
Freshman Brevin Knight hit a
driving 15-footer at the buzzer,
capping a hair-raising 67-65 win
over Washington last night in a
wild conference-opener at Maples
Pavilion.
"We were very fortunate," said
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery.
"We got away with a W which per
haps we didn't earn."
Stanford (8-2 on the season, 1-0
in the Pac-10), while holding the
lead for almost the entire game,
never stretched it to more than 12
points, staving ofTa late Husky run
to seal the win.
"I thought we were in control
the whole game," said Cardinal
guard David Harbour, who fin
ished with 12 points. "But we came
out really soft and really lackadaisi
cal."
Both squads struggled through
an icy first half, combining to shoot
29 percent from the floor. Stanford
carried a 24-20 lead into the locker
room.
After missing on nine three
pointers in the first half, the Cardi
nal shifted its focus to the inside in
the second half.
"Washington had a size advan
tage on the perimeter," Mont
gomery said. "We wanted to work it
more inside, and the ball ended up
going down."
But the story of the second half
was similar to the first — the Car
dinal, while maintaining a lead for
the entire period, was unable to
deliver a knockout punch.
A pair of Harbour buckets put
the Cardinal up 45-39 with 12 min
utes, 35 seconds remaining. Stan
ford appeared to take control at

that point, upping its lead to 57-45
when Knight hit a driving layup
with 6:24 to play.
But the Huskies (2-8, 0-1)
picked away at the Stanford lead.
With 2:14 to go, Washington closed
the gap to 60-56 on a Jason Tyrus
layup.
That's when things got a bit
confusing. On the same play, Har
bour was whistled for a foul, and
Tyrus went to the line to shoot one.
Tyrus missed his shot ... but
another whistle blew. In what head
official Willis McJunkin later
termed a "correctable error,"
Tyrus's errant foul shot was erased
from the record. Next, Husky
guard Amir Rashad stepped to the
line to shoot two shots — apparent
ly, Harbour had been whistled for a
foul away from the ball on Rashad,
rather than a foul on Tyrus.
After Rashad hit both free
throws, Harbour converted a 3-
point play on a driving layup, giv
ing Stanford a 63-58 lead with 1:54
remaining.
But Rashad hit another pair of
free throws to close the gap to 63-
60. With 1:18 left on the clock,
Knight lofted a pass over Har
bour's head, allowing Washington
cut the gap to 63-62 on a Maurice
Woods layup.
With 39 seconds to play, Brent
Williams banked a 16-footer, giving
the Cardinal a 65-62 lead.
But Washington forward Scott
Didrickson, who had attempted
only one field goal all night, hit a
three-pointer at the 0:24 mark to
tie the game at 65.
With three seconds remaining,
Knight took an inbounds pass at
the top of the key, beat one man
and unleashed the game-winner as
time expired.
