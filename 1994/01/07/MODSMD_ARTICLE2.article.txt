# Reform takes STEP toward diversity
## 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
A new director and new staff at
the embattled Stanford Teacher
Education Program are working
to improve the program's overall
quality and to better meet the
needs of a more diverse student
body, but high staff turnover is
threatening the extent and effica
cy of their reforms.
The STEP staff has instituted
several changes to accommodate
the increasing diversity among
program participants, including
expanding the Cross Cultural
Language and Academic Develop
ment program and creating facul
ty workshops on diversity.
Interim Director Betsy Burris
said the new multicultural em
phasis of the program was due to a
"personal interest in multicultur
alism" and was not tied to a spe
cific reform agenda.
While both students and staff
had hoped for more comprehen
sive reform, broad personnel
changes on the staff have limited

the expansion of the new pro
grams. Although the STEP staff
is "very, very committed," Burris
said, they are new at their jobs,
and that puts them at a disadvan
tage in instituting major changes
and serving the students.
Martin Martin, a participant in
the program, said that while
STEP was "advertised" as pro
moting a multicultural environ
ment within the program and im
parting multicultural teaching
methods to teacher candidates, "I
don't think ithat promise) has
materialized."
The STEP program is a 12-
month program within the School
of Education that provides partic
ipants with secondary-school cre
dentials as well as a master's in
education.
Burris said one of the most
promising new programs her of
fice is planning is a summer pro
gram that would match STEP
students with master teachers
with whom they would teach ju
nior high and high school stu
dents. It is more ambitious than
STEP's past summer placement
programs in that the School of
Education will establish the pro
gram, and not simply place stu
dents in existing programs.
"The summer school is ... a
great reform. It's a beginning and
I hope that it continues," she said.
Last year, STEP was criticized
for not adequately dealing with
issues of inner-city education.
While Burris said that the pro
gram's current policy is "not to
place students in urban settings"
or "places that might cause strain
on [STEP students| or the pro
gram's resources," she said that
there is ongoing discussion about
changing that policy.

Burris, who said she would
support such a change, said that
it was often difficult to bridge the
gap between the "rarefied atmo
sphere" of Stanford and the real
world of the schools, and that any
changes would "take a long time."
This year, only one of STEP's
five-person staff has served on the
staff before, according to Burris,
who will herself be leaving the
STEP program next year.
Burris said she thought the
program could benefit from
more permanent leaders who
could accumulate experience and
bring it to bear in developing the
program. The School of Educa
tion is currently discussing the
installation of two faculty co
directors to assume Burris's
responsibilities.
Martin said he thought the
program was understaffed and
that perhaps could benefit from
creating "a couple other posi

tions" and reshaping the existing
staff' job descriptions.
The STEP program was
thrown into turmoil last year
when then-director Grace Grant
was overheard saying that con
flicts among students could be
resolved by screening applicants
for their ideologies.
While Grant later apologized
for the remark, the STEP pro
gram continued to draw criticism
that it had abandoned its com
mitment to multiculturalism and
had not adequately dealt with
the concerns of urban education.
Burris said that the high staff
turnover was unrelated to ten
sions in the program last year
but admitted that the staff had
felt the sting of the controversy.
"Everyone had their own rea
sons [for leaving the staff],
although it's fair to say that
everyone was affected I by the con
troversy ]," she said.
