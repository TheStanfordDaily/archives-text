# Reform takes STEP toward diversity

A new director and new staff at
the embattled Stanford Teacher
Education Program are working
to improve the program's overall
quality and to better meet the

the expansion of the new pro

said, they are new at their jobs,
and that puts them at a disadvan

and serving the students.
Martin Martin, a participant in
the program, said that while
STEP was "advertised" as pro

education.
Burris said one of the most
promising new programs her of

gram that would match STEP
students with master teachers
