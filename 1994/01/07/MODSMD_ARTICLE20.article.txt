# The 						Cardinal almost shoots itself in the foot
## Freshman point guard saves the day after two halves of sloppy basketball 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
Ijet's not start thinking about post
season piny just yet.
In pulling off one of its most dramat
ic clutch victories in a long while, the
Stanford men's basketball squad also
put together one of its most mediocre
performances of the season.
Not even a thrilling game-winning
shot at the buzzer could hide the fact
that the Cardinal's play amid only be
characterized as something far from
stellar.
"Bad night," wen* the first words
muttered by Stanford point-guard
Brevin Knight when asked about the
Cardinal's first-half execution.
Indeed, making only 25 percent of
your shots in the first period is not going

to help you win many games. Neither
will converting barely half of your free
throw attempts.
In terms of talent, the 1993-94 Stan
ford squad easily surpasses the team
which posted a 7-23 record one year ago.
But last night the Cardinal almost
learned the hard way that it takes more
than just raw skill to survive in the Pac
-10.
Clearly something was missing from
its effort against Washington.
"Your execution, your shooting per
centage are tied into mental concen
tration," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery. "We never got into a
rhythm."
Stanford seemed to be going through
the motions for most of the first half.
The Cardinal blew a handful of close
up shots in the opening period, failing to

build up any type of sizable advantage
and all the while adding to the confi
dence of the Husky squad.
"People were playing, but they
weren't really concentrating," said cen
ter Jim Morgan. "We took (this game)
for granted."
When the Cardinal finally did build a
seemingly insurmountable lead, the
squad let up its intensity.
The sloppy Cardinal team nearly
handed the Huskies the victory in the
game's closing minutes, drawing the ire
of Montgomery.
"I'm just angered about the mental
side of our mistakes," he said. "We've
got to play a whole lot better."
It's true that things could be a lot
worse right now for Stanford. At this
point last season, the Cardinal had a
record below .500 and were 0-1 in con

fere nee play.
But Stanford received a severe reali
ty check last night â€” only three min
utes of aggressive offensive play near
the end of the contest separated the
squad from Washington, a team predict
ed by many to finish dead last in the
Pacific 10 Conference.
Hopefully, this rude awakening will
help to motivate the squad to play to its
full potential when the competition
becomes a bit stiffer.
"I know we're capable of playing a
whole lot better," Montgomery said
Even with their occasional flashes of
brilliance, Stanford has the makings of
a Pac-10 contender.
"They're for real," said Washington
coach Bob Bender. "They are going to
be a really good team and have a real say
in the conference."
