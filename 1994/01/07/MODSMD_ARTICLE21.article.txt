SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal appeals
court on Thursday rejected a sex-discrimina
tion claim by former USC women's basketball
coach Marianne Stanley, saying the coach of the
men's team had a more demanding job and
could be paid more.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
refused to reinstate Stanley, who now holds the
title of director of marketing for women's bas
ketball at Stanford, to the job she held for four
years at the University of Southern California.
Her replacement, former USC All-American
Cheryl Miller, has built on Stanley's success
and guided her team to a No. 10 national rank
ing.
Stanley, who made $70,000 in salary and
housing allowances last season, sought a con
tract equal to that of men's coach George Rav
eling, whose won-lost record at USC was below
hers. Stanley said she wanted a three-year deal
that would bring her up to Raveling's level.
When Garrett refused, Stanley sued him and
the university for $8 million.
The appeals court said the two jobs were not
equal and did not have to be paid equally.
The evidence showed "significant differ
ences in job pressure, the level of responsibility,
and in marketing and revenue-producing quali
fications and performance," said Judge Arthur
Alarcon in the 3-0 ruling.
Stanley got a new job this week, director of
marketing for women's basketball at Stanford
University, whose team is rated to be USC's
chief rival for the Pacific-10 title. Her lawyer,
Robert L. Bell, noted that USC has no compa
rable marketing post for its women's program.
