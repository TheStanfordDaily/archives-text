# A 						Cardinal rule
## Gymnastics tumbles into tourney with flying colors

It will simply be routine for the defending
national champions.
The Stanford men's gymnastics team opens
its season today at the Spartan Open in San
Jose. For the past few months, the Cardinal
men have been learning new skills and difficult
combinations that will allow them to earn high
scores on their performances. In actual compe
tition this weekend, they will begin to perfect
the routines that may eventually secure a third
consecutive national title.
"It's the first competition of the season,"
said head coach Sadao Hamada. "We don't have
to win or post high scores. It's a chance for us to
see the skill and consistency level of the team.
We will make modifications and change our
preparations as necessary."
As Hamada implied, Stanford will not con
cern itself with California, lowa State, New
Mexico or any of the other 11 squads that will
compete at the Spartan Open. If there is any
pressure, it falls on the Cardinal freshmen,
whose responsibility this year will be to fill the
gaps left by the losses of 1993 graduates Jair
Lynch, Shawn Adamek and Jeff Bender.
I especially want to see the freshmen com
pete," Hamada said "{The Spartan Open) will
tell me about their transition into
collegiate gymnastics. I'm counting
on them to pick up the slack for the
lost seniors."
Picking up the slack will be no
easy task. Lynch, a present member
of the U.S. NationaJ Team, was the
1993 parallel bars champion. His
accomplishments in last year's
national competition also include
second place in floor exercises,
fourth place in high bars and a

ninth-place finish overall.
Bender, who has the high bar
maneuver the "Bender Flip" named
after him, excelled under pressure,
and Adamek contributed solid per
formances and team leadership.
But fortunately for Stanford,
freshmen Jamie Ellis, Keith Wiley
and lan Bachrach comprise one of
the best recruits in the country.
Ellis is a six-time member of the
Junior National Team. Wiley, also a
Junior National Team member,
comes off a year in which he placed
third overall in the nation, captured
the national vault title, finished sec
ond nationally in floor exercises and

competed in the Olympic Festival.
Bachrach qualified for nationals in
his freshman and sophomore years
in high school.
"I've learned a lot since I got
here," Bachrach said. "I'm a little
nervous, but I think I've adjusted
well. I'm looking forward to I the
Spartan event] as a chance to test
myself. I hope to make the finals on
the floor, high bars and vault."
In addition to new talent, the
Cardinal also returns a core of
explosive veterans led by senior cap
tain Mark Booth and junior Jing-
Wei Liang.
Booth was a top performer for

the Cardinal throughout 1993 until
an Achilles injury cut his season
short in the Western Regionals.
Meanwhile, Liang is considered one
of the top-three returning gymnasts
in the nation, specializing in the
pommel horse.
Seniors Jason Cohen and Chris
Sey and junior Josh Stein will also
provide experience and firepower.
Hamada therefore feels that, no
matter what happens this weekend,
his team is once again poised for a
successful year.
"Our goal is to three-peat,"
Hamada said. "We have the bodies
and the talent to do so."
