# Rookies to wrestle in Open
## Grapplers looking to strike gold in Bakersfield tourney 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
The majority of the 30-man
Cardinal wrestling team will get a
rare chance to share the spotlight
with the starters this weekend as
they compete at the Cal State
Bakersfield's Country Classic
Open.
Unlike dual meets, in which
one starter fills each of the 10
weight classes, the Country Clas
sic is an open tournament where
wrestlers compete solely for indi
vidual points. Team points are
not scored.
All Cardinal wrestlers not cur
rently in their redshirt year will
represent Stanford at the tour
nament. However, this season's
redshirters cannot share this
affiliation (so as to preserve their
remaining eligibility), and will be
forced to pay their own way and
compete independently at the
tournament.
The Cardinal (2-2) will bring
approximately 25 athletes to the
tournament, four of whom are
presently redshirt ing: 150-pound
Jeff Grant, Robert Hatta (126),
Sahlan Martin (167) and Matt
Von der Ahe (158).
Due to the fact that entire ros
ters may compete, the tourna
ment will host a larger number of
athletes than other competitions.
Cardinal head coach Chris Horpel
speculates that all of the Califor
nia wrestling schools will com

pete, in addition to a few out-of
state schools.
Also adding significant com
petition to the tournament will
be several club teams, who typi
cally wrestle freestyle in training
for the Olympic World team. The
strongest of these programs is
the Sunkist Kids, associated
with Arizona State, who may
bring up to 20 athletes. Club
wrestlers can be of virtually any
age beyond college, or may be
college athletes training in the
offseason.
"This will be a different com
petition because there could be
superstars there that will make
the weight classes more diffi
cult," Horpel said.
Horpel is anticipating ap
proximately 32 men in each
class bracket. Wrestlers must
lose to quarterfinalists in order
to come back in the consolation
bracket.
Last year the Cardinal had
five place-winners at the tour
nament, and Horpel is opti
mistic that the Cardinal can
expect at least as many winners
this year.
"We've had a good, solid week
of practice," Horpel said. "The
conditioning and crispness we
were lacking at [last month's)
Oregon Classic should be back."
The Cardinal has posted
dual-meet victories against UC
Davis and San Francisco State,
while suffering defeats at the

hands of Oregon and Oregon
State. Furthermore, the Coun
try Classic is the third tourna
ment the Cardinal will partici
pate in, after December's presti
gious Las Vegas Invitational
and the Oregon Classic.
Co-captain Jay Jackson leads
the Cardinal in team points and
has an overall record of 11-3.
Both he and the squad's other
co-captain, Lance Johnson, are
undefeated in dual-meet compe
tition.
Jackson attributes his record
to his training. "I have great
workout partners in practice . . .
without them I'd be nowhere,"
said Jackson.
Johnson may not compete this
weekend due to a pulled ham
string he incurred while training
over vacation. Also injured is
freshman Bryan Vaniman (190)
whose knee may not be recovered
in time for this weekend.
Matt Cano (126), currently 8-
4 overall and 3-1 in duals, trails
only Jackson in team points.
The sophomore is excelling in
his first season as a starter.
"I'm feeling pretty good,"
Cano said. "I feel like I'm get
ting better each match . . . and I
feel on track to do well at the
end of the season."
On the other hand, sopho
more Jimmy Aguirre (142) has
been frustrated with his 8-6
overall record, although he is
fourth in team points and was

one of two Cardinal place-win
ners at the Las Vegas Invita
tional in December.
"This quarter is dedicated to
wrestling and the Pac-lOs,"
Aguirre said.

Johnson also noted the
team's heightened intensity
now that the Pacific 10 Confer
ence championships are two
months away; one sign of this
fervor is that the team is train

ing twice a day in preparation
for the event.
"We're really excited . . . Pac
10s is what we're shooting for,"
he said." I think the team will
be ready."
