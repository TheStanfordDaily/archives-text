# Daily to set precedent on cussing
## 
### Michael Green Editorial staff 
The editorial staff of The Stan
ford Daily — long known for its
independent thinking — came to
an official decision to begin a self
censure policy yesterday evening.
Soon The Daily will be a publica
tion entirely without profanity.
The proposal to remove all
swear words from the paper was
floated two months ago when
phrases like "ass-thumpin' nook
ie all night long" and "needing a
stiff dick" began to appear in var
ious columns and news stories.
These words, along with the more
commonplace "shits" and "moth
erfuckers," brought about the
suggestion to implement a sani
tized Daily.
"It seemed almost gratuitous,"
said Managing Editor Kyle Gra
ham of the profanity. "It was
time to do something."
For this reason, standard
curse words — like "shit" and
"fuck" — will no longer appear in

The Daily effective Jan. 19. Other
well-recognized profanities —
"asshole" and its many sundry
variations included — will like
wise be prohibited once this new
policy becomes part of The Stan
ford Daily Consitution®.
Furthermore, no longer can
reviews of Wilbur dining include
such quips as: "If it tastes like
chicken to you then your stan
dards are in the shitter." Never
again can the insult "your moth
er's a lousy fuck" find its way into
print.
"Why bother with something
so crass," said News Projects Edi
tor Andy Dworkin, referring to
the latter insult, "when (one|
could just as easily have said,
'Perhaps your mother might
stand to learn from cable televi
sion's more graphic educational
material? Perhaps Showtime's
"Red Shoe Diaries" for starters.'
It's just a matter of creativity."
Others, however, think this
new policy is an affront to the
very creativity Dworkin dis

cussed. "Their (the editorial
board's) shitcake, fascist, conser
vative attitudes about acceptabil
ity are unacceptable," said
enraged columnist Tish Williams.
"They might as well write my
fucking column for me!"

'You might never see
the word "shit" in print
again. This saddens me.'

Said Science Editor Jim Mor
ris, "Pretty soon they'll tell me I
can't print the words 'penis' or
'vagina' because anatomy is
offensive. What is this shit?
There just aren't any good scien
tific euphemisms."
Morris's concerns seem vali
dated, especially considering that
the upcoming Science Bug col
umn has now been tentatively
headlined "Why crabs give you an
itchy wee-wee."

The question of cussing in The
Daily was first raised in 1992,
when the Daily's Intermission
section published student-written
short stories which made included
a variety of curse words, including
"shithead," "fishfucker" and
"golly." In response to this prece
dent-setting publishing, present
Daily Editor-in-Chief Rajiv Chan
drasekaran commented, "We're
trying to forget that ever hap
pened — despite the language."
And Julie Makinen, a Daily
employee and the main spokesper
son for the ban, assured both
reporters and readers that the pol
icy would not hinder the delivery
of accurate news.
"Certainly writers will still be
able to quote whatever fucking
filth an interviewer may
encounter," Makinen said. "But
we don't want any ass-wipe
potty-mouths to make our read
ers feel they have to turn to the
other horseshit campus publica
tions just to read something
decent."
