# When Ninjas play football
## Denny's, a love story: a franchise fantasy 
### 
Confession: 1 have a torrid love affair going
with someone named Denny.
Late at night, under the pale glow of my
stick-on ceiling stars, I wrestle in my sleep, for
he calls to me, seductively . . . coaxingly. Like a
big, ugly, Tim Curry clown on the made-for-TV
version of "IT" his franchised call interrupts
my simple Sweet Valley High dreams.
"Katie," it says, "have a slam. A slam. We're
all down here. Larry, Vespa . . . we want you to
join us too. Come to Denny's. Come to us."
Correction: I have a torrid love affair going
with something named Denny's.
Sometimes I resist and I fight the urge to
gorge on an International Slam at three o'clock in
the morning. I count the calories in the ice-cream
scoop of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter. I cast
Satan out of Linda Blair and try to stay in bed.
And sometimes, of course, I don't. The Daffy
Duck devil on my left shoulder kicks some of
the angel butt on my right and casts an evil
shadow over my voluptuating appetite.
I begin to need that grilled cheese sandwich.
You know the one. It drips down your arm while
you eat it. It's deep fried. The oil in that thing
could lubricate your Uncle Elwood's '76 Pacer.
To wash it down, gimme a large root beer.
Those dinky thimblesque orange juice glasses
just won't do, either. A vat sure would be nice,
darlin'.
And so I enter the doors of the El Camino
Denny's â€” the muzak version of "I Just Called
to Say I Love You" inevitably whistling through
my ears. Denny's welcomes me with open,
greasy arms.
But I am grateful, for I am Katie of the Dorm
Food, jaded by purple jambalaya and corn
cheese loaf. Armed with only an IV unit to
quicken the infusion of cholesterol, a man who
faintly resembles Herve Villechaize leads me to
"my table" in the back, surrounded by fake
rocks glued to the wall and a macrame planter.
The waitress brings the menu. THE wait
ress. She looks as if she was conceived, born and

raised at Denny's. Maw and Paw Waitress had
their first date in the booth in the corner. She
named her first born Denny, but everyone just
calls him Slam. She could serve your eggs blind
folded. She has a collection of brown Hush Pup
pies in her closet, and she likes all of them.

Her real name is Vespa, and she has perfect
ed the art of waitressing. She empathicly knows
to bring water to my table. She also knows to
take away the ash tray. We have a cosmic bond,
Vespa and I. Words are few, smiles and glances
are unnecessary. I order, she delivers, and all is
well under the glow of her Maybelline lipstick.
Although many of the regular groupies aren't
at their stools, a few stragglers sit here and there.
Groupies generally park themselves at the
counter. Hunched over, spreading Promise on
their white toast. Naked under their green trench
coats, and smiling because of it they bid me a
good morning. Many of them smoke while they
eat, the butt dangling like wilted lettuce from
their lips. The nicotine merges with the powdered
sugar on the french toast. It adds flavor to the
Neverending Pot o' CofTee, they tell me.
These are the real Denny's people. Stan has
been here since Christmas. Jesse has his calls
forwarded to the pay phone by the potty. Cooter
used to watch "Alice," and still fantasizes about
kissing Flo's grits. Myrtle knew Vespa when she
donned her first brown training jumper, and
their cosmic bond with her is more spiritual than
mine could ever be. All their butts fit perfectly

into the friendly chair impressions that hold
form during a trip to the bathroom. It seems the
only mark they'll leave on the world will be set in
vinyl. They each belong here in their own lonely
sort of way, and they accept few along the road.
I fumble with the little contraption that
connects two tables. As long as the affair has
lasted, I haven't been able to work that
damned thing. Luckily, Waiter-Man has to
come and save me. 1 can never remember what
his real name is, even though it is embossed on
the back of his thick leather belt. But I've seen
him blossom at Denny's.
When I first came here, he was a mere bus
boy. Now I think he's made it to assistant man
ager. It's no wonder he's moved up. Waiter-Man
loves it at Denny's. Almost as much as I do. He
does his work with a Pearl Drops smile.
Waiter-Man likes me. He has a big buckle
and white Clark Griswald shoes and he slicks
his hair back with Hollandaise sauce. He polish
es his name tag with a hanky.
He's a Denny's man. And I love him.
1 guess the purpose of this is to thank Denny
for being there during the wee hours of the morn
ing. To fulfill my needs and cater to my every
desire. For bringing me coffee and exactly two
creams, french toast without the ice cream scoop
of butter, and taco salads without the tomatoes.
For being my paradise by the dashboard light.
In its own Urban Cowboy sorta way, Denny's
is a part of my life, with its vinyl booths and silk
flower arrangements and assorted fried goods.
The smell of syrup, ketchup and cigarette
smoke will linger in my nostrils forever
Long after I blow this one Denny's town, I
will think back on the bunch of smoking
groupies who'll still be there, and perhaps a
new Waiter-Man who will wear white leather
bucks and a belt with his name on the back.
Contrary to popular religious belief, God
didn't rest on the seventh day. He went to
Denny's, ordered a Grand Slam, and then it was
good.
