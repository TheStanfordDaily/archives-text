# Ironman meets 'Titanium man'

Like many students, Russ Mcßride alle
viates the rigors of Stanford academics
with exercise.
But to Mcßride, a first-year graduate
student in philosophy, "exercise" means

more than a jog
around Campus
Drive. Mcßride

marathon- like
event he created
for himself to
test his athletic
prowess.
It consisted of
the seemingly im

world, swimming five miles at a time,
