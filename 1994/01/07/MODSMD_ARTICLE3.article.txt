# Ironman meets 'Titanium man'
## Grad student takes exercise to the limit — and far beyond 
### Diane Chen 
Like many students, Russ Mcßride alle
viates the rigors of Stanford academics
with exercise.
But to Mcßride, a first-year graduate
student in philosophy, "exercise" means

more than a jog
around Campus
Drive. Mcßride
recently complet
ed triathlon, a
marathon- like
event he created
for himself to
test his athletic
prowess.
It consisted of
the seemingly im
possible combina
tion of rock climb
ing the most diffi
cult routes in the

world, swimming five miles at a time,
running a marathon and biking more
than 100 miles — all in a period of two
days.
His friends at a rock climbing gym in
Berkeley didn't think hecould do it. In fact,
they had a betting pool going — not on how
long it would take Mcßride — but on when
during the event he would die.
Mcßride doesn't know how much

The Titanium Man Multi-
Sport Challenge included
rock climbing, swimming
five miles, running a
marathon and biking more
than 100 miles — all in a pe
riod of two days.

money they lost, but, he said, "They were
all shocked."
But now it's over, and the thrill is gone.
Mcßride is nonchalant about the superhu
man feat. "I don't really care that I've done
it. . . . Preparing for it and doing it is
what's fun — for something you're not
sure you can do,"

he said.
Mcßride said he
conceived the
event while pon
dering what would
be "the hardest
possible athletic
event with the
most minuscule
possibility of (com
pleting it)." The
multi-sport chal
lenge was his idea
of the ultimate wav

to "push your abili
ties and see how far they'll stretch," he
said.
Mcßride began the event Dec. 4, by com
pleting 14 pitches of rock climbingjust out
side Yosemite, Calif. During the same day,
he swam five miles at a sports complex in
Sacramento.
At 7 a.m. the following day, he partici-
pated in the Sacramento
Marathon, and finished off with a
112-mile bicycle ride. Since this
kind of multi-sport event had
never been completed before,
Mcßride said he achieved "a
world record of sorts."
However, he did run into a few
problems along the way. He expe
rienced hypothermia during the
swim and afterward — and had to
recuperate in the sauna. He said
he "felt nauseated" when he fin
ished his three-hour swim.
And while the run "went well,"
Mcßride recalls that the biking
"took forever" — especially
because he was left with very lit
tle light to guide his path when he
lost contact with the support van
for a few hours at night.

"I started having some worries
during the biking part," he said.
A handful of spectators showed
up at each event. He was also
accompanied by his own support
team, from which a different per
son joined him in each endeavor
except the swim.
Mcßride called the Titanium
Man event a way to "vent energy"
when he was "getting stressed out
with classes."
The original "Titanium Man"
trains by working out at gymnasi
ums, running near his home and
rock climbing in Yosemite, includ
ing the famous climb up the face
of Half Dome. He also trains by
frequently climbing the walls of
campus, and said he thinks "it's a
pity that Stanford doesn't have
any climbing walls."
Surprisingly, Mcßride said he
had only swum "twice in the past
six months," although he goes
running "fairly consistently."

Although the idea for a multi
sport challenge event is new,
Mcßride has excelled in various
athletic events for most of his life.
He ranks 20th in the American
Sportclimbing Federation and
has been featured in various
sports magazines, in which he has
received many accolades for
sportclimbing.
The climbs Mcßride completed
— called "sportclimbs" — are
shorter and harder than tradi
tional rock climbs, he explained.
The short routes take about seven
minutes to complete and require
exercise-specific strength and
technique, he said.
"The climbs are so hard that
you're falling a lot," he added.
Mcßride's climbs rated 5.12 on an
American climbing scale ranging
from 5.0 to 5.14.
In the future, Mcßride says he
plans to "do something a lot hard
er" than the Titanium Man event.
