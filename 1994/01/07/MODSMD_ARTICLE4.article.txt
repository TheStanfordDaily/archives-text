# Students gather to discuss cuts
## 250 attend ethnic center meetings 
### Michael Slemmer Julie Tsai Staff writers 
In an effort to galvanize stu
dent activism, the four major
ethnic centers held emergency
meetings last night to discuss the
possibility that the University's
planned budget cuts might leave
them crippled.
More than 250 people showed
up at the four separate meetings
held by the Asian American Stu
dent Association, the Black Stu
dent Union, El Centro Chicano
and the Stanford American Indi
an Organization to discuss plans
for responding to the threat of
decreased funding.
On Wednesday night, student
leaders from each of the ethnic
organizations met to coordinate
plans for a speak-out and a
forum next week to educate the

campus on the centers' roles.
"We want to get some people
in our community aware of the
budget cuts," said sophomore
Vanessa Alvarado, one of the
leaders of the meeting held at El
Centro.
Budget reduction targets, an
nounced fall quarter, have forced
the University to consider cut
ting from all areas, sparking fear
in the ethnic centers that they
will lose funding in the process.
"We had to fight to get the
University mission to where it is
today," said BSU chair Anietie
Ekanem. "We don't want to take
steps backward . . . back to the
1950s where it's just one culture,
one mindset, a conservative
Stanford."
At El Centro, students re

the meeting room and put up ban
ners bearing such messages as
"The Condoleezza Rice Center"
and"Budget Cuts Are Coming,"
in an effort to generate student
involvement in protesting cuts.
Throughout the meeting at El

Centre, students discussed various
ways to vocalize their concerns
about budget cuts. Their ideas
ranged from wearing a specific
color or type of clothing to issuing
a joint statement with the other
ethnic centers — all motivated by a
desire to promote unity.
"We don't want just ideas but
actions," Alvarado said. "We really
haven't become aware yet
Sometimes you need a little push."
BSU members, who held a

closed meeting at Lagunita Court,
voiced concerns about possible
structural changes in the ethnic
communities, and expressed sup
port for the "speak-out" and
forum planned for next week,
according to Ekanem.
"It was quite a hectic meeting,"
he said. "They had a lot of ques
tions. They all recognize Ithe dis
cussions on restructuring and bud
get cuts] as a name game."
AASA leaders Steven Chen and

Lisa Lee expressed similar senti
ments about administrators' lack
of familiarity with ethnic centers'
situations.
Lee hoped to motivate AASA
members to participate in the
forums and the process as a whole.
"We hope that discussion about
the ethnic centers might spear
head student activism," she said.
In addition to planning specific
courses of action, the meetings
were designed to express the urgen

cy of the situation to students.
"I'm just hopeful that people
will wake up and realize that what
they take for granted may not be
here in the future," said senior
Victor Madrigal, who attended El
Centra's meeting. "Removing the
furniture makes a statement
about the cuts — I hope the
administration will listen."
But other students recognized
that the University administration
may have already decided its

course of action on some issues.
"It's a difficult situation because
some of the decisions have already
been made," said ASSU Senator
Roberto Milk. "Because some of the
procedures took place in Dead
Week and finals week, it was hard
for people to rally around a cause.
"This gives us an opportunity to
make an impact."
