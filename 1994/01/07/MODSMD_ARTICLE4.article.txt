In an effort to galvanize stu
dent activism, the four major
ethnic centers held emergency
meetings last night to discuss the
possibility that the University's
planned budget cuts might leave
them crippled.
More than 250 people showed
up at the four separate meetings
held by the Asian American Stu
dent Association, the Black Stu
dent Union, El Centro Chicano
and the Stanford American Indi
an Organization to discuss plans
for responding to the threat of
decreased funding.
On Wednesday night, student
leaders from each of the ethnic
organizations met to coordinate
plans for a speak-out and a
forum next week to educate the

campus on the centers' roles.
"We want to get some people
in our community aware of the
budget cuts," said sophomore
Vanessa Alvarado, one of the
leaders of the meeting held at El
Centro.
Budget reduction targets, an
nounced fall quarter, have forced
the University to consider cut
ting from all areas, sparking fear
in the ethnic centers that they
will lose funding in the process.
"We had to fight to get the
University mission to where it is
today," said BSU chair Anietie
Ekanem. "We don't want to take
steps backward . . . back to the
1950s where it's just one culture,
one mindset, a conservative
Stanford."
At El Centro, students re
