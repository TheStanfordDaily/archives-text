# 'Walking through a part of history'
## Students in Moscow program witnessed turmoil firsthand 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
After spending fall quarter dodging
tanks, traffic and teachers on the
streets of the Russian capital, eight vet
erans of Stanford's new Moscow pro
gram returned to campus this quarter
safe and sound.
Despite some worries about the stu
dents' welfare in the midst of Russia's
recent turmoil, both students and ad
ministrators are calling the pilot pro
gram successful, with Overseas Studies
Director Russell Berman saying the
program will very likely be continued
next quarter.

"It was (like) walking through a part
of history," said senior Cory Welt of the
past three months in Moscow.
Welt, who was on his third trip to the
city, said he kept thinking of the decline
of the Roman Empire as he walked
through the streets. "When people go
over there, they start to understand the
similarities, but also the differences"
between the West and Russia, Welt
said.
The fall-quarter-only program
began this year with Russian profes
sors, who had spent some time at Stan
ford, teaching classes in English about
various subjects, such as Russian histo
ry, economics and sociology. The stu

dents, who had studied at least a year's
worth of Russian, stayed with Russian
families while taking classes at the for
mer home of the Communist Youth
League in downtown Moscow.
"It was certainly one of the most re
warding academic experiences I've
had," said senior Keela Pierce, who is
majoring in international relations and
economics. Being there during such a
"monumental time for Russia" gave her
a "wider vision of the world," she said.
Pierce's eyes may also have gotten a
bit wider on a trip during which she and
senior David Robison ran across "the
bad guys" who attempted to take
over the Itar-Tass News Agency
during last fall's upheaval.
Robison and Pierce were walking
back from a piano concert with
Pierce's Russian host after being
assured by a policeman that the
streets would be safe that night
when, as Pierce tells it, they came
across "some men, and one of them
was prostrate on the floor with an
pointed almost straight at us."
Robison said he had some trou
ble understanding the man's Rus
sian, but got the message that they
should leave quickly. "It happened
so quickly that I should have been
scared, but I wasn't," said Robi
son.
Members of the Moscow pro
gram also were able to experience

the adventure of negotiating the
anarchic Moscow traffic on foot
and shopping for provisions for a
traditional Thanksgiving dinner.
"Haagen Dazs was the score of
the century," said Pierce, after
explaining that it took about two
weeks to locate a turkey and all
the fixings. Aside from a few trips
to McDonald's, that Thanksgiving
dinner was "the closest we got to
doing the American thing in
Moscow," Robison said.
Negotiating traffic was also dif
ficult, as cars there don't seem to
follow any rules, said Robison. "It
doesn't seem like they're follow
ing laws, but there are police
everywhere that can pull cars over
for any reason," he said.
As far as safety was concerned,
Pierce and Robison shared the
feeling that it was not really an
issue. "We didn't see anything as
bad as a lot of big cities [in the
United States]," Robison said,

"but supposedly it's there."
"They made a real effort to
make sure we were safe and had
everything we needed," Pierce said.
AJI in all, students seemed sat
isfied with the program. "It
taught you a lot more than you
would learn in Palo Alto," Pierce
said. She especially appreciated
staying with Russian families in
their homes.
Welt, who is now serving as
peer adviser for the program,
recruiting students for next year
and helping to develop next year's
academic program, said they
aimed to have at least 20 students
going next fall, and are consider
ing expanding the program to
include winter-quarter research
seminars or tutorials. Four of the
students who went last quarter
are still in Moscow pursuing fur
ther study.
"We were the guinea pigs, and
we made it through," said Welt.
