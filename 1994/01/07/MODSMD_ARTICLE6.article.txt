On August 28, 1963, Cecil Williams
and 200.000 others marched with Mar
tin Luther King Jr. on Washington.
Thirty-one years later, the Rev.
Williams of San Francisco's Glide
Memorial Church is still marching with
King's message. Next week, he will de
liver the keynote address for the 1994
Martin Luther King Jr. Commemora
tive Program.
Williams will deliver his address,
"From Civil Rights to Human Rights:
Where Do We Go From Here?", in Kres
gv Auditorium at 7 p.m. on Thursday

night.
"It is wonderful to bring someone
here that was there, that can really
speak of where we are, where we came
from, where we can go from here," said
Barbara Smith, chair of the Martin
Luther King, Jr. Commemoration
Committee and director of the Black
Community Services Center.
The program is one of the highlights
of next week's celebration of King's
birthday. The events begin Sunday
morning, when Psychology Prof.
Claude Steele leads public worship at
Memorial Church and will continue
through Jan. 17, closing with a presen

tation featuring University President
Gerhard Casper and Provost Con
doleezza Rice.
The commemoration committee has
spent the last two months planning the
week's events. The scheduled events
aim to commemorate and educate stu
dents about King's life and work.
The committee is comprised of rep
resentatives of the Black Community
Services Center, the Martin Luther
King Papers Project, the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center and Gradu
ate Residences.
"The committee is verv diverse,"
Smith said. "We try to include and
collaborate with many different
facets of the Stanford community."
Working with the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center and
the committee, two panel discus
sions have been scheduled next
week on the topic of diversity in
the workplace.

"I think (the programs] will be a
good forum for upper-class discus
sion," said senior Ahmad Rahman,
a resident assistant in Mirrielees.
The celebration will end on
Martin Luther King Jr. Day, with
the King Papers Project's dra
matic presentation of "A Celebra
tion of the Life and Legacy of
Martin Luther King Jr."
The Rev. Floyd Thompkins,
associate dean of Memorial
Church, and Rice will read the
parts of Martin Luther King Jr.

and Coretta Scott King, Casper
will play the part of former Presi
dent John F. Kennedy and Tom
Massey the part of Malcolm X.
"It is really encouraging to see
President Casper, Provost Rice
and Rev. Thompkins participat
ing in something of this magni
tude," says Smith. "It speaks to
me of their commitment to such
educational programs."
A "Pre-School Birthday Cele
bration" is also scheduled in
Escondido Village on Wednesday.
