Olympic ice skater attacked
DETROIT (AP) — Nancy Kerrigan, the U.S
figure skater who is among the gold medal
favorites at the Winter Olympics, was attacked
yesterday by a man who hit her on the leg with
a metal bar after she left the ice during prac
tice.
Kerrigan was taken from Cobo Arena to a
hospital, where she was examined and released.
Hutzel Hospital refused to release details of
Kerrigan's injury. The attacker escaped.
One witness said Kerrigan left the ice and
had stopped to talk to reporters when a man ran
up behind her from out of the stands. He hit her
several times on the right knee with what
appeared to be a crowbar or tire iron, said Joan
Ryan of the San Francisco Examiner.
Kerrigan, the U.S. figure skating champion,
won the bronze medal at the 1992 Winter
Olympic Games in Albertville, France. The 24-
year-old skater from Stoneham, Mass., is among
the favorites to win the gold medal at the Win
ter Games in Lillehammer, Norway, next
month.
Federal agencies end gun sales
WASHINGTON (AP) - The government
will no longer give federal agencies permission
to sell used firearms to civilian gun dealers in a
new policy officials hope will decrease the num
ber of handguns on the street.
Federal departments are banned from selling
weapons — including handguns, shotguns and
rifles — to dealers unless the General Services
Administration grants them a waiver.
The new policy means no more waivers will
be given to the departments, which have includ
ed the federal Drug Enforcement Administra
tion, the Customs Service, the Internal Rev
enue Service, the FBI, the State Department
and the Immigration and Naturalization Ser
vice.
Aspirin may lower heart attacks
LONDON (AP) — A new study provides the
strongest evidence yet that half an aspirin tablet
a day cuts the likelihood of heart attacks and
strokes by 25 percent among people with heart
disease or past heart attacks.
But the study — the first part of which was
published in Saturday's issue of the British
Medical Journal — said the risk of taking
aspirin could outweigh the benefits for people
with no history of heart problems.
