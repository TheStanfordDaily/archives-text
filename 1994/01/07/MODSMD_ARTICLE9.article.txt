# Clinton in mourning
## President flies home to grieve loss of mom 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - For the third
time in less than a year, death is sending
President Clinton and first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton on a sad journey home to
Arkansas.
In a call from his stepfather sometime
before 2:30 a.m. yesterday, Clinton learned
that his mother, Virginia Kelley, had died
in her sleep in Hot Springs, Ark.
It has been a year of mourning for the
Clintons.
First came the loss of Mrs. Clinton's
father, Hugh Rodham, whose slow demise
last April after a stroke brought her to his
bedside for a 16-day vigil.
In July, Vince Foster, the Clintons' long
time friend and deputy White House coun
sel, committed suicide, citing the pressures
of Washington and the White House. The
Clintons are reminded daily of that tragedy
as Foster's work on the couple's finances is
scrutinized by federal investigators.
And now, a week after Clinton took her
home for the holidays aboard Air Force
One, the president's mother is dead. Clin
ton flew to Arkansas yesterday after getting
a big hug and kiss from the first lady, who
plans to join her husband today. The funer
al will be held tomorrow.
Mrs. Kelley's death leaves Clinton with
out one of his most important role models,
his most fervent defender and an
unabashed promoter of his career.

A working mother in a generation of
housewives, Mrs. Kelley raised two sons.
She held the family together through the
deaths of three husbands — including an
abusive alcoholic — and a drug addiction
that nearly killed Clinton's half-brother.
Mrs. Kelley taught her oldest son how to
deal with adversity, a lesson he has carried
to the White House.
Friends said Mrs. Kelley, a retired nurse
who was a regular at the horse races, also
provided grounding for her ambitious son.
She was a middle-class woman who never
let him forget his roots.
Clinton last saw his mother Dec. 28,
hugging her goodbye on the porch of her
lakeside home before he headed to South
Carolina.
The Clintons are still reeling from the
death of Foster who shot himself in July.
Racked with guilt, his friends did not real
ize until after his death that Foster was
consumed by the pressure of Washington.
As their personal attorney, Foster
helped sell the Clintons' interest in a real
estate venture called Whitewater Develop
ment Corp., which is now under scrutiny by
federal investigators.
A series of deaths in such a short span of
time makes grieving more difficult, said
Stephen Shanfield, a professor of psychia
try at the University of Texas Health Sci
ence Center in San Antonio.
