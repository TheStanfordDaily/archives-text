Goldman, Sachs & Co.
Investment Banking Opportunity in San Francisco
Goldman Sachs invites you to explore opportunities in Investment
Banking. In addition to our previously advertised New York-based
Analyst Program, we are also seeking candidates for an Analyst
position in our San Francisco-based High Technology Group.
This position will entail an intensive 6 to 9 month training and
development period in our New York office followed by relocation to
San Francisco for the completion of the 2 to 3 year Analyst Program.
In San Francisco, Analysts work with some of the area's leading high
technology companies in addressing their various investment banking
needs.
If you are seeking positions in both New York and San Francisco,
you need only sign up through the CPPC for the NY-based
schedule and you will be considered for both positions. Do not
sign up for both schedules. For those candidates interested only in
working in San Francisco, please send or fax a resume and transcript
directly to Edward Herring (current Analyst and 1993 Stanford
graduate) in our San Francisco office at the following address:
Edward Herring

555 California Street, 31st Floor

Fax: 415-393-7637
Phone: 415-393-7733

We will follow-up with selected applicants for this San Francisco-based position by
Wednesday, January 19, to schedule interviews which will be held on January 27.
