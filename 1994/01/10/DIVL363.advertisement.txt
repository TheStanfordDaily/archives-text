Governance:"
A Call for Citizen Leadership

The riots in LA were a crisis in governance which is played out in the "quiet riots"
taking place within institutions across the United States. Response by citizens have
ranged from "leaving it to the government" to take care of confrontational politics that
come short of problem-solving. Massengale will present a third approach that
reclaims our role as active citizens.
