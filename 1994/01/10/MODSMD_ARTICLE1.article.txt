Jing Wang, a first-year Medical School student, instructs
Boy Scout Brian Rapacchietta, 10, in rescue breathing for
infants on Saturday at the Lucile Stern Community Center
in Palo Alto. Wang is a teacher in a basic aid training class

sponsored by the Palo Alto chapter of the American Red
Cross. The program, in its second year, trains students
from Stanford and local high schools in basic first aid who
in turn train elementary school students.
