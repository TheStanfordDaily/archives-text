# Friends for Youth boosted by $50,000 Annenberg grant
## Stanford group seeks students to befriend troubled kids

While playing football, eating
pizza and going to the movies
may sound like an easy way to
perform community service and
even receive academic credit,
Stanford students have discov
ered more lasting rewards from
participating in the Friends for
Youth program.
Friends for Youth, a local non
profit organization, matches
troubled or underprivileged
youths with volunteer "senior
friends" — members of the local
community, including Stanford
students.
Each volunteer spends about
three hours per week with a
"junior friend" between the ages
of 10 and 17, to play, participate
in organized group activities or
just to provide companionship.
Junior Tumaini Rucker, a stu
dent coordinator for Stanford's
Friends for Youth branch, has
been matched with 13-year-old
Monique since fall quarter last
year. "When we were first
matched, she was really shy,"
Rucker said. "After a while she
really opened up."
In spite of her social progress,
however, Monique still faces
obstacles — overwhelming prob
lems that motivated her to run
away from home this summer.
"(There are) a lot of things you
want to take personally, but you
know these kids are not living in
an environment that's conducive
(to positive development)," Ruck
er said.
"It's important to remember
that even if I'm not going to
change her life, that maybe I can
be an influence," she said.
Now, Friends for Youth will be
able to allow more prospective

"junior friends" to be matched
with a "senior" friend, through a
recent $50,000 grant from the
Annenberg Foundation. The
grant comprises one-sixth of the
Redwood City-based organiza
tion's income.
Finances, however are not the
program's only concerns, said
Stanford's program coordinator

'It's important to
remember that even
if I'm not going to
change [someone's]
life, that maybe I can
be an influence.'

Emory Rice.
"Right now, we have 80 kids
waiting to be matched with a
friend," Rice said.
Even though the Stanford pro
gram has been highly successful,
the demand for positive role mod
els in the community exceeds the
number of current volunteers,
she said.
While Friends for Youth
actively seeks all eligible volun
teers in college and beyond, the
group most often likes to match
each youth with someone of the
same race and a similar back
ground. Most noticeably, "on the
waiting list, lots of the kids are
black males," Rucker said.
"There are a shortage of black
male senior friends."
At Stanford, Rice anticipates
that more money will be devoted

to the recruiting process — from
presentations and fliers to news
paper ads and public service
announcements on KZSU.
Friends for Youth was started
15 years ago as a branch of Part
ners, a similar national organi
zation. The Stanford program
was founded by two students in
1981, a year before the Haas
Center for Public Service was
established. It was "innovative
for its time," Rice said, "before
young adult involvement in com
munity service* was so much in
existence."
The mentor program appeared
on the Stanford campus as part of a
lecture class, with fewer than 10
students participating. Though the
class did not last, the program itself
thrived, making more than 30 new
matches each year, and now involv
ing 70 "junior friends."
Interested students can still
receive academic credit for volun
teering with Friends for Youth.
Senior Jason Ambrose chose to
intern with the organization last
year for a psychology class.
Ambrose continues to spend
time with his 10-year-old friend
Chris whom he was paired with
last February. The pair regularly
play football or video games, and
go to the movies. Recently, they
appeared together in a television
commercial for Friends for
Youth.
"I'm one of the success sto
ries," Ambrose said. "It's really a
lot of fun."
As his friendship with Chris
reaches its one-year mark,
Ambrose encourages other Stan
ford students to become involved.
"Don't get frustrated," he
advises. The kids "will try to test
you out. Have a thick skin about
it, and it's really worth it."
