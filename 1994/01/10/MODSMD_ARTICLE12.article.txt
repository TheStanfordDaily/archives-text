Senators open to Vietnam
HANOI, Vietnam (AF) — The chair
man and four members of a powerful
U.S. Senate committee urged President
Clinton yesterday to quickly lift the trade
embargo against Vietnam .and restore
diplomatic relations after nearly 20
years.
"I frankly am pretty confident that
the embargo will be lifted because it's the
only thing to do at this time," said Sen. J.
Bennett Johnston, D-La., who chairs the
Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee. "The march of history is in
that direction. I think the president will
be prepared to act quickly."
The two countries broke off diplomat
ic and economic relations in 1975 after
communist North Vietnam defeated the
U.S.-backed South Vietnamese govern

ment and reunified the divided country.
Fear slows AIDS research
BALTIMORE (AP) — The reluctance
of women and minorities to volunteer for
an AIDS vaccine experiment is hamper
ing research, scientists at the Johns Hop
kins School of Medicine said.
The main stumbling block is the mis
taken belief that the vaccine could give vol
unteers AIDS, despite what scientists say.
"As soon as people hear the word
AIDS, they just turn the other way," said
Dr. Jack Lambert, clinical director of
AIDS vaccine studies at Johns Hopkins.
The researchers' complaints come
amid renewed mistrust of medical exper
iments brought by recent revelations
about Cold War radiation tests on unwit
ting subjects.
