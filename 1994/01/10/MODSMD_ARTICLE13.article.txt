BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Presi
dent Clinton opened his first European
trip yesterday warning that a rising
mood of nationalism in Russia threat
ens the march of democracy and free
economies in Eastern Europe. He said
there is a "genuine cause for concern."
Urging Western allies to help strug
gling nations of the former Soviet bloc,
Clinton said, "We must not now let the
Iron Curtain be replaced with a veil of
indifference."
On a brighter note, Clinton's journey
began with new optimism about the
signing of an agreement to dismantle
the nuclear arsenal of the former Soviet
republic of Ukraine. Administration
officials suggested Clinton would
expand his five-nation, nine-day trip to
include a stop in Kiev if a final agree

ment is reached this week.
The president told reporters "we've
made a terrific amount of progress"
toward an arms agreement, but he
wasn't ready to declare success.
"We have not yet reached an agree
ment," Secretary of State Warren
Christopher told ABC News. "One of
the worst mistakes you can make is to
prematurely declare victory, because
sometimes then you are very severely
disappointed."
In a speech to young people whom he
hailed as the future leaders of Europe,
Clinton celebrated the end of the Cold
War, the completion of world trade talks
and the spread of democracy.
However, he warned that "militant
nationalists and demagogues" could
reverse the tide of freedom. He said the

West has a big stake in Eastern Europe
"because their security matters to our
security."
Clinton said a struggle is being
waged across Europe "from the Balkans
to Central Asia."
"In one lane are the heirs of the
enlightened who seek to consolidate
freedom's gains by building free
economies, open democracies, and toler
ant civic culture," he said. "Pitted
against them are the grim pretenders to
tyranny's dark throne, the militant
nationalists and demagogues who fan
suspicions that are ancient and parade
the pain of renewal in order to obscure
the promise of reform.
"We — none of us can afford to be
bystanders to that race. Too much is at
stake," Clinton said.
