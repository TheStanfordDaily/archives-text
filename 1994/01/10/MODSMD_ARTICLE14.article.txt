KATLEHONG, South Africa (AP) -
Gunfire erupted as a high-level African
National Congress delegation toured a
violence-plagued township yesterday,
and the shooting that followed killed
two people, including a journalist.
Abdul SharifT, 31, a South African
freelance photographer on assignment
for The Associated Press, was shot once
and pronounced dead at Natalspruit
Hospital in Katlehong. Witnesses said
he was wounded in the back while run
ning across a clearing.
Two other journalists were injured,
and police said they shot to death one
man and arrested three people while
confiscating four AK-47 automatic
rifles. Township residents said at least
two other people were also shot.
ANC Secretary General Cyril
Ramaphosa and Communist Party chief
Joe Slovo led the delegation into Katle
hong, one of South Africa's most violent
townships, after reports that ANC sup
porters were attacking each other in
recent weeks.
Within minutes after they started
walking on a dirt road through a neigh
borhood of burned-out and damaged

houses, shots rang out from the direc
tion of a workers hostel dominated by
Zulu supporters of the Inkatha Free
dom Party, the ANC's main black rival.
ANC President Nelson Mandela
quickly blamed the government of Pres
ident F.W. de Klerk for not cracking
down on such violence, which he said is
a daily occurrence in Katlehong.
"There is no excuse for the police not
doing their duty. . . . The police should
not allow any people to fire at innocent
residents," he said in a televised inter
view last night.
After the initial shots, gunfire crack
led sporadically for 40 minutes from the
area of the hostel and from AK-47s and
handguns carried by scurrying town
ship residents.
Charles Moikanyang, a television
reporter for the South African Broad
casting Corp., was in stable condition at
the hospital with a bullet wound to the
hip. An SABC radio reporter, Antha
Warner, sustained a flesh wound.
There was no immediate information
available about the man killed by police
or the other people wounded.
Much of the political fighting that

killed more than 3,000 blacks last year,
including 1,200 in Katlehong and the
neighboring Thokoza township,
stemmed from the ANC-Inkatha power
struggle.
Slovo said he believed Inkatha sup
porters started the shooting, and that
although police were present in the
township, none were near where the
gunfire occurred.
"There was not a single policeman or
military even though the whole of South
Africa knew we were going there," he
told The Associated Press.
Police Col. Zirk Gous told a news con
ference the ANC never notified police of
the tour and made no plans for extra
security. Because of the ongoing vio
lence in Katlehong, police were present
in the township and acted as soon as
they heard of the shooting.
"We arrested three AK-47 wielding
gunmen and shot and killed another
AK-47 wielding gunman," Gous said.
He said the arrests occurred on the
street.
That would indicate that those
arrested were probably township resi
dents and not hostel dwellers.
