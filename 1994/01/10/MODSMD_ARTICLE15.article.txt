CUE needs to support
giving academic credit
for learning by service

ALL TOO OFTEN, Stanford
students hear about their
separation from the "real
world." On campus, we are told, we
live a sheltered existence, apart
from the often-menacing reality of
America.
In universities' ongoing attempts
to breach this divide, many schools
have attempted to encourage and
bolster their community service
programs. Stanford is no exception,
boasting one of the nation's
strongest such campaigns through
the Haas Public Service Center.
We don't usually think of such
activities as academic. But if you
ask students who have interned at
Stanford in Washington or taken
Prof. A 1 Camarillo's history course
on homelessness, they'll tell you
that well-constructed public service
classes can be as intellectual and
rigorous as any seminar or collo
quium.
The Commission on Undergrad
uate Education should endorse var
ied programs that would empha
size service learning as an ele
ment of students' undergraduate
careers. Stanford has already rec
ognized the value of community
service outside of the classroom
through its many tutoring oppor
tunities, Reach Out Today and
other assorted outreach ventures.
However, now the time has come to
further incorporate service activi
ties into the classroom environ
ment.
Service learning, as championed
by former University President
Donald Kennedy and many others,
gives students the opportunity to
obtain real-world experience as a
complement to their classroom
activities.
Writing and Critical Thinking
and its predecessor, Freshman
English, have been forums for ser

vice learning, as students can opt to
add a public service project to term
paper research in 17 of the 140
course offerings. Other classes
have followed this model, such as a
communication class in which stu
dents tutor Palo Alto students and
thereby discover the effects of
media influences on the children's
lives.
A mandatory community service
DR or major requirement would be
pointless â€” forcing students to
serve would become more of a bur
den than a blessing. However, the
commission should investigate
ways to facilitate and reward ser
vice work.
One option would be to give
credit toward major requirements
for community service internships,
even if only one or two units.
Teachers could also accommodate
end-of-the-quarter projects that
incorporate service into the more
standard curriculum format. Both
of these alternatives would encour
age students to leave the confines
of campus to gain some real-life
experience.
Service work should by no
means be a substitute for other
vital aspects of a course's curricu
lum, but the benefits reaped during
service activities should not be
ignored. Courses with directly rele
vant service project potential
should actively pursue such
options.
Many American studies, human
biology, sociology and ethnic stud
ies courses could easily add com
munity service opportunities; how
ever, other departments which do
not on their face lend themselves
to service activities should also
attempt to seek out new and inno
vative ways to help students apply
their skills in outside communi
ties.
Endorsing a cogent, intensive
public service program would allow
the commission an opportunity to
use its mandate to help both Uni
versity students and surrounding
communities. For while Stanford
has much to teach the outside
world, the University also has
much to learn.
