## Curbing bovine violence 
### 
ON NOV. 8, 1993, I made an offer
to the Stanford community
promising to write a column on
exploding cows if enough requests were
made. The tally is in. All die-hard cow
fans, the wait is over. I finally got one
request:
As a columnist at a prestigious paper
such as The Daily, I think it's necessary
to bring you the pressing, tough, contro
versial issues that concern us today,
especially the issues often glazed over
and hidden from the public because they
betray the failures of our government or
they are just simply too shocking.
Today, I bring you one such story. I
remind you that, though officials may
deny its validity and though you may not
believe it, this story is entirely true and
has not been adulterated in any way.
(Parental guidance is suggested.) From
the Associated Press, Nov. 10, 1993:
"IRVINE, Calif. (AP) â€” Police may
lock horns with city officials for shooting
a cow 43 times to keep it out of freeway
traffic.
The Sunday shooting is under review
by City Manager Paul Brady.
'Firing 43 shots into an animal occurs
to me to be unusual,' Brady said. 'We're
looking at it to see if there was overreac
tion.'
Officers fired 41 bullets from their
45-caliber weapons into the cow's side,
then shot it twice in the head when it
finally collapsed at about 2:20 a.m."

Truth is indeed stranger than fiction.
Of course, as is true with all events of
this nature, the repercussions of this
brutal killing are more than just one
more dead cow. It is another testament
to the problems this society must face.
The oppression of cows everywhere, the
cruel treatment of animals, the incom
petence of our police force, the lack of
adequate gun control. How many times
must the bullets fly before they're for
ever banned?
Even if this is only one isolated inci
dent, the fact remains that farm animals
all over this land are persecuted con
stantly, forced to work as slaves and
beasts of burden, even, yes, even being
slaughtered and eaten. How many years
can some mammals exist before they're
allowed to be free?
How many deaths will it take until we
know too many bovines have died?
In retrospect, this incident was not
entirely bad; that cow's life did not go
entirely to waste. If anything, this
demonstrates the nation's dire need for
some decent gun control.
And it even pushes aside the argu
ments of the National Rifle Association
because even they couldn't think it takes
43 shots to bring down a cow (though
they may think 40 rounds in a one sec
ond burst to bag a rabbit is acceptable
and protected in the Bill of Rights). It's
about time we took the guns off the
streets and out of the hands of leather

loving police officers everywhere.
Maybe I'm blowing this whole affair
completely out of proportion. But you
must imagine what could have happened
under different circumstances or what
might happen in the future if we let this
atrocity happen again.
What if entire cow populations, seeing
this massacre as an act of oppressive
aggression against their species, begin
marching in the streets in protest. Will
we shoot them then? What if each cow is
filled with methane? (In solving this
dilemma, we must consider all possibili
ties.) We'd probably end up with an
explosion powerful enough to level
Cleveland.
But above all the discussions, issues
and raw emotions that were finally
raised by this incident, I would like to
leave you with a quote that summarizes
fairly well my thoughts on the matter
from Richard Evans, a veterinarian in
the county:
"We seldom use gunfire," Evans said.
"To blow them all over the highway is
just totally unacceptable."

While no cows actually exploded in this
story, they easily might have. Thai apol
ogizes to the fine city of Cleveland (it was
the first city to come to mind).
