## El Centro staffer upset by potential center budget cuts 
### 
THIS IS A LETTER to let the stu
dent body know that the battle for
students of color on this campus to
receive full recognition as legitimate and
contributing members of the Stanford
community is not even partly over. Since
last year I have continuously had cause
to become more and more disillusioned
with Stanford and the way ethnic
minorities are treated on this campus.
As a student staff member of El Cen
tro Chicano and as a member of
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino student
group, I have found a beautiful, caring
and supportive community of
Chicano/Latino students working for
each other. I have seen the support that
Centro has provided for the students
and the support the students have for
each other. I have seen white, Asian,
black and Native American students
come into El Centro Chicano and use it
to meet, study and work. It angers me to
hear people who don't even come into El
Centro Chicano regularly describe it as

"self-segregated."
What El Centro provides for the
whole campus is exposure to the issues
that affect the Chicano/Latino communi
ty at Stanford and beyond. The pro
grams that come out of El Centro Chi
cano (which has to work without a pro
gramming budget) are for everyone. The
lack of programming funds limits the
number of students that are attracted to
these events. Nevertheless, according to
the UCMI report, one third of white stu
dents on this campus have gone to an
ethnic center.
For those that we can't reach, the
possibility of their spending four years at
Stanford without any contact with eth
nic minorities is possible, especially
when many of them come from situa
tions where the only contact they have
with ethnic minorities is as servants and
not as their peers. When this happens,
ethnic minorities become invisible in the
life of a student and remain so.
What happened to me at the Coffee

House on Dec. 15, 1993, is a prime
example of the invisibility of minority
students on campus and the insensitivity
towards minorities that the ethnic cen
ters are trying to comhat. I was standing
in line waiting to place my order when
the cashier asked who was next. A stu
dent behind me began to place her order
and I interrupted saying that 1 was still
waiting to place my order, at which point
she said, "Oh, I thought you worked
here; you look like you do."
What do you do when someone sud
denly slaps you in the face for no reason?
Nothing. Not a damn thing and I will
always have to remember that I couldn't
even respond to such a comment. To
some it may seem a trivial, meaningless
comment but the way it was said carried
a lot of feeling and ignorance.
When you're carrying a Stanford
backpack, reading a magazine and obvi
ously waiting in line, as I was, I find it
difficult to be mistaken for a worker.
Perhaps it happened because the concept

of a Chicana as a student at Stanford
University was so hard for that woman
to swallow that she immediately placed
me in a role that was more palatable to
her.
I believe that this statement was
made with malice and that it is an indi
cation of the work that is still needed to
be done in order for me to not feel like a
stepchild at this University. This work is
currently being done by the ethnic cen
ters through their resources, support
and programming, even though accord
ing to the UCMI they are not properly
funded in the first place.
At the present time the centers are in
danger of receiving budget cuts that
would devastate their immediate opera
tion. Until the centers are seen as an
integral part of this University and the
racism I experienced is addressed prop
erly, I will continue to feel like a
stepchild of this University.
