### Sarah Katz Michael Slemmer Staff writers 
The Commission on Undergraduate
Education will meet this afternoon both to
discuss the formulation of its subcommit
tees and to approve the list of nine students
who have been appointed to serve on them.
Though the students' names will not
be released until tomorrow's ASSU Sen
ate meeting, Mork Murdock, chair of the
committee on committees — which made
the selections, said he is confident that
the selections will be ratified by both the
senate and the commission.
The subcommittees, chaired by com
mission members, will report back to the
commission throughout winter quarter
before issuing final reports. The five sub
committees designated so far will deal
with breadth, majors, academic environ
ment, foreign languages and academic

calendar.
"We made the applications open to grad
uates and undergraduates, but all the appli
cants were undergrads," said Eddie Garcia,
chair of the Student Advisory Group on
Undergraduate Education, a student group
working with the commission.
According to History Prof. James
Sheehan, chair of the commission, today's
meeting will be a "general review of the
last quarter, as well as looking ahead to
see what we'll handle this quarter."
The meeting, while aiding in "recover
ing momentum at the beginning of the
quarter," will also be instrumental in cre
ating working subcommittees, he said,
adding that "it's an organizational meet
ing in many ways . . . There are some
issues that haven't been settled yet."
Indeed, Sheehan said the subcommit
tees already designated may be insuffi
cient to meet the commission's needs.
"We will be talking about any additional

subcommittees we might need," he said.
In addition to serving with the com
mission members, the selected students
will be working with the parallel student
advisory group.
"We plan on putting them together on
a steering committee for the advisory
group," said Garcia. "We want to create a
forum for the representatives to work
with students and to have a way to speak
among themselves."
The group has already been holding
open meetings in order to discuss ques
tions about undergraduate education.
However, apart from the possibility of
issuing a report at the end of the year, the
student representatives' foremost task
will be to voice student concerns to the
commission.
"We will encourage the representatives
to go to our open meetings," Garcia said.
"We made it clear during the application
process that this would be part of their job."
