# Jackson to meet with ethnic center leaders
## 
### Miranda Doyle Sarah Katz Staff writers 
Responding to student concerns over
funding cuts, Dean of Students Michael
Jackson is meeting today with campus eth
nic center directors and student leaders.
It is "extremely positive" that Jackson is
calling for the meeting to discuss impend
ing budget cutbacks, said Rick Yuen, direc
tor of the Asian American Activities Center.
Jackson said he is drafting a report on
how Stanford's four ethnic centers con
tribute to the University's academic and so
cial mission, a report he will submit to Vice
Provost and Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds and Provost Condoleezza Rice.
The first draft of the report, part of an ef
fort to slice 15 percent to 30 percent from
the Student Affairs budget, is expected to
be completed in about 10 days.
Some of the proposals discussed so far
include consolidating directorships and
sharing office space among the centers,
ideas student leaders say would
hurt the centers.
But Jackson said such a move
might not be detrimental to orga
nizations, like the ethnic centers,
that have things in common.
"Centers are talking about how
they might collaborate with each
other," Jackson said. "We all
share the library. Should we have
89 different libraries? Probably
not."
Besides scheduling today's
meeting, Jackson said he plans to
attend events planned for this
week by students connected to

the four targeted centers. "I
think that any opportunity for
members of the Stanford commu
nity to learn about the centers'
activities is very positive," he
said.
However, Edmonds stressed
that it is too early to predict
whether the ethnic centers will be
among the departments that are
hardest hit by cuts in funding.
"We're still in the formulating
stage," she said. "[Students] are
reacting to rumor — something
that might not happen."
Edmonds added that it would be
part of the "worst-case scenario"
if the rumors came true.
"If I can dispel any myth, it is
that we don't appreciate what
students do. . . . They are a very

vital part of what we do here at
Stanford," she said. "However, so
are a lot of other things."
The ethnic centers are "not
going away, and they are not
being merged. They will maintain
their separate identities,"
Edmonds said. But they will be
"asked to prioritize like everyone
else, and hopefully continue
working together in positive
ways."
Jim Larimore, the director of
the Stanford American Indian
Organization, said the ethnic cen
ters may end up sharing both
equipment and staff.
"We're looking at ways to
share our resources; for example
by having one copy machine for
two or more centers," he said.

But Larimore said that the fund
ing cut by this move would be
"fairly minor."
Jackson dismissed concerns
about a proposal to make the cen
ters use a single photocopier.
"Sharing a photocopy machine is
small potatoes," he said. "I can't
believe people are going to be
upset about that."
Larimore said that because
more than 80 percent of each
center's budget goes to "salary
and benefit rates," a significant
part of the cuts would also come
out of the staffing of the cen
ters.
"The staff will be spread thin,"
he said, cautioning that "we'll
need to make use of the energy
and creativity of staff members

rather than increasing their
workload."
Edmonds has already insti
tuted a freeze in the hiring of
new staff members for student
affairs departments until the
final outcomes of the budget
cutting processes are known. As
a result, a replacement has not
yet been found for Larimore,
who announced plans this fall to
leave his position within the
next year.
"[Edmonds] was told that stu
dent affairs would be looked at to
shoulder a heavy part of the bud
get cuts," Larimore said. She
established the hiring freeze "to
keep as much flexibility as she
could."
But Larimore added that one

of the main principles in the bud
get-cutting process is that "posi
tions that are directly connected
to the recruitment and retention
of a diverse student population
are crucial."
Larimore said the four campus
ethnic centers already collaborate
on programming and have regular
meetings. "This is the kind of col
laboration we should be careful to
develop in the future," he said.
In forming the Students of
Color Coalition, students at the
four campus ethnic centers are
already collaborating. The group
met yesterday to continue mak
ing plans for two events this
week: a "speak-out" on White
Plaza tomorrow at noon and a
forum Wednesday night.

"[Edmonds] was told that stu
dent affairs would be looked at to
shoulder a heavy part of the bud
get cuts," Larimore said. She
established the hiring freeze "to
keep as much flexibility as she
could."
But Larimore added that one

of the main principles in the bud
get-cutting process is that "posi
tions that are directly connected
to the recruitment and retention
of a diverse student population
are crucial."
Larimore said the four campus
ethnic centers already collaborate
on programming and have regular
meetings. "This is the kind of col
laboration we should be careful to
develop in the future," he said.
In forming the Students of
Color Coalition, students at the
four campus ethnic centers are
already collaborating. The group
met yesterday to continue mak
ing plans for two events this
week: a "speak-out" on White
Plaza tomorrow at noon and a
forum Wednesday night.
