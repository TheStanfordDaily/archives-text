Responding to student concerns over
funding cuts, Dean of Students Michael
Jackson is meeting today with campus eth
nic center directors and student leaders.
It is "extremely positive" that Jackson is
calling for the meeting to discuss impend
ing budget cutbacks, said Rick Yuen, direc
tor of the Asian American Activities Center.
Jackson said he is drafting a report on
how Stanford's four ethnic centers con
tribute to the University's academic and so

Provost and Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds and Provost Condoleezza Rice.
The first draft of the report, part of an ef
fort to slice 15 percent to 30 percent from
the Student Affairs budget, is expected to
be completed in about 10 days.
Some of the proposals discussed so far
include consolidating directorships and
sharing office space among the centers,
