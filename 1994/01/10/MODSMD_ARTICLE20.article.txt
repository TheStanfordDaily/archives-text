## Well-balanced attacks lead Cardinal past Cougars Intense performances, hot Knight garner home victory 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
The members of the Stanford men's basketball
squad are quick learners.
After a dismal performance in its win over Wash
ington last Thursday night, the Cardinal realized
that if it continued to play without intensity, the
team would be lucky to win another conference game
all season.
Stanford took that lesson to heart Saturday night
in its convincing 75-64 victory over Washington State
at Maples Pavilion.
This time, every Cardinal player came prepared to
play.
"Night and day, two different ball clubs," said
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery. "I was pleased
with this game."
lx)d by point guard Brevin Knight, the Cardinal
(9-2, 2-0 Pacific 10 Conference) pounced on the
Cougar squad right from the start.
"The kids were just more focused," Montgomery
said. "Of course, it didn't hurt that Brevin got off to
the kind of start he did."
Knight sparked the Cardinal in the opening peri
od, racking up 15 points and three steals in just 13
minutes of playing time. The 5-foot-10 freshman
fueled a relentless fast-break attack that accounted
for nine of Stanford's first 11 points.
Apparently, Montgomery's team meeting follow
ing the Washington game provided extra incentive
for the Cardinal to start out strong against Washing
ton State (10-4, 0-2).
"He got on us. He wasn't too excited," Knight said
sarcastically. "He told - .s we had to play harder this
game, and we did."
The Cougars, however, provided some intensity of
their own. Paced by Eddie Hill's 18 first-half points,
including four three-pointers, Washington State con
tained Stanford's lead to six points or less for most of
the period.
"Of the 18 points, three of the three-pointers,
maybe four, were on defensive breakdowns," Mont
gomery said. "And that's absolutely what we weren't
going to let happen."
The Cardinal finally pulled away midway through
the second half, extending its modest six-point advan
tage into an unbridgeable 15-point lead. In a time
span of just three minutes, the Cardinal outscored its
opponent 11-2.
Junior David Harbour began the Cardinal run by
nailing a three-pointer from the sideline just before
the 35-second clock expired. Two possessions later,
sophomore guard Dion Cross ripped the ball away
from a Washington State player after a missed Stan
ford shot, and laid the ball back through the hoop to
put the Cardinal up by 11 points.
Then, after forward Brent Williams hit a 10-foot
jumper from the baseline, Andy Poppink stole the
ball on defense and hit Cross on the fast break for a
wide-open slam dunk, sealing the Cougars' fate. Sud
denly, Stanford found itself comfortably ahead by the
score of 60-45 with 6:49 remaining.

Forward Brent Williams puts a resounding exclamation point on a Dion Cross alley-oop late in the sec
ond half of the Cardinal's 75-64 victory over Washington State Saturday night.
On offense, the Cardinal dis
played one of its most balanced
efforts of the season, with five play
ers scoring nine or more points.
Cougar coach Kelvin Sampson
was full of praise for the multi
faceted Stanford offensive attack.
"Stanford has improved," he
said. "They can go deep in the shot
clock, and they can beat you off the
dribble."
The Cardinal defense stepped

up in the closing period. Most
impressive was the fact that Hill
was held scoreless in the session,
managing to get off only four shots.
"In the second half, he didn't
get any free looks (at the basket),"
Montgomery said.
As Washington State found out
on Saturday, Pac-10 opponents are
going to have to give their best per
formances against the confident
Stanford squad this season.
"Last year we weren't sure,"
Poppink said.
"We knew coming into this year
that we were going to be able to
play with people."

The members of the Stanford men's basketball
squad are quick learners.
After a dismal performance in its win over Wash
ington last Thursday night, the Cardinal realized
that if it continued to play without intensity, the
team would be lucky to win another conference game
all season.
Stanford took that lesson to heart Saturday night
in its convincing 75-64 victory over Washington State
at Maples Pavilion.
This time, every Cardinal player came prepared to
play.
"Night and day, two different ball clubs," said
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery. "I was pleased
with this game."
lx)d by point guard Brevin Knight, the Cardinal
(9-2, 2-0 Pacific 10 Conference) pounced on the
Cougar squad right from the start.
"The kids were just more focused," Montgomery
said. "Of course, it didn't hurt that Brevin got off to
the kind of start he did."
Knight sparked the Cardinal in the opening peri
od, racking up 15 points and three steals in just 13
minutes of playing time. The 5-foot-10 freshman
fueled a relentless fast-break attack that accounted
for nine of Stanford's first 11 points.
Apparently, Montgomery's team meeting follow
ing the Washington game provided extra incentive
for the Cardinal to start out strong against Washing
ton State (10-4, 0-2).
"He got on us. He wasn't too excited," Knight said
sarcastically. "He told - .s we had to play harder this
game, and we did."
The Cougars, however, provided some intensity of
their own. Paced by Eddie Hill's 18 first-half points,
including four three-pointers, Washington State con
tained Stanford's lead to six points or less for most of
the period.
"Of the 18 points, three of the three-pointers,
maybe four, were on defensive breakdowns," Mont
gomery said. "And that's absolutely what we weren't
going to let happen."
The Cardinal finally pulled away midway through
the second half, extending its modest six-point advan
tage into an unbridgeable 15-point lead. In a time
span of just three minutes, the Cardinal outscored its
opponent 11-2.
Junior David Harbour began the Cardinal run by
nailing a three-pointer from the sideline just before
the 35-second clock expired. Two possessions later,
sophomore guard Dion Cross ripped the ball away
from a Washington State player after a missed Stan
ford shot, and laid the ball back through the hoop to
put the Cardinal up by 11 points.
Then, after forward Brent Williams hit a 10-foot
jumper from the baseline, Andy Poppink stole the
ball on defense and hit Cross on the fast break for a
wide-open slam dunk, sealing the Cougars' fate. Sud
denly, Stanford found itself comfortably ahead by the
score of 60-45 with 6:49 remaining.


Curtis Chen — Daily
Forward Brent Williams puts a resounding exclamation point on a Dion Cross alley-oop late in the sec
ond half of the Cardinal's 75-64 victory over Washington State Saturday night.
On offense, the Cardinal dis
played one of its most balanced
efforts of the season, with five play
ers scoring nine or more points.
Cougar coach Kelvin Sampson
was full of praise for the multi
faceted Stanford offensive attack.
"Stanford has improved," he
said. "They can go deep in the shot
clock, and they can beat you off the
dribble."
The Cardinal defense stepped

up in the closing period. Most
impressive was the fact that Hill
was held scoreless in the session,
managing to get off only four shots.
"In the second half, he didn't
get any free looks (at the basket),"
Montgomery said.
As Washington State found out
on Saturday, Pac-10 opponents are
going to have to give their best per
formances against the confident
Stanford squad this season.
"Last year we weren't sure,"
Poppink said.
"We knew coming into this year
that we were going to be able to
play with people."
