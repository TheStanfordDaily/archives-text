# With four players scoring in double figures, women raise Pac-10 record to 1-1
## 
### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
Welcome back to the win column.
After last Thursday's loss to Washington in its
Pacific 10 Conference opener, the Cardinal women's
basketball team earned a much-needed road split on
Saturday night, scoring an 82-67 victory over Wash
ington State before 1,017 at Friel Court in Pullman,
Wash.
Displaying the balance characteristic of a good
team still struggling to find its leader, ninth-ranked
Stanford (8-3, 1-1 in the Pac-10) saw four of its play
ers score in double figures as the Cardinal pulled away
from the unranked Cougars (6-5, 1-1) in the last 10
minutes of play.
Junior forward Rachel Hemmer led the way for
Stanford, tallying 18 points and eight rebounds on the
evening, including 10 and four respectively in a first
half that ended with the Cardinal clinging to a 36-34
advantage. Hemmer, who canned six of her nine free
throw attempts on the period, would have enjoyed an
even bigger half if not for a pair of front-end misses in
one-and-one bonus situations.
"I thought our offense rushed in the first half, and
it didn't help that I shot horribly from the free throw
line," Hemmer said.
Despite Hemmer's free throw gaffes, and several
botched attempts at following head coach Tara Van-
Derveer's game plan of forcing the ball inside to junior
center Anita Kaplan, Stanford swung the tempo in its
favor toward the end of the first stanza on the
strength of 20 Cougar turnovers.
In fact, the Cardinal netted 22 of its 36 first half
points in the final eight minutes, 41 seconds before
intermission, with senior guard Christy Hedgpeth
making four fast break layups in spite of her three
quick fouls during the run. With the spurt, Hedgpeth,
who scored 13 points on the night, moved ahead of for
mer point guard Molly Goodenbour into 14th place on
the Cardinal all-time scoring list.
However, in what has become a Stanford routine in
1993-94, the Cardinal did not begin to assert its con
trol of the contest until well into the second half. The
Cougars, who had held the lead as late as 27-26 before
the break, came out of the locker room and knotted
the contest at 36 when sophomore forward Jenni Ruff
converted a Hemmer turnover into two of her 10
points. Following a Kaplan layup on the other end,
freshman forward Amy Saneholtz, who tied a Wash
ington State record by making all 10 of her field goal
attempts en route to a game-high 21 points, laid home
a Ruff miss.
But 38-38 was the last time the Cougars would
have a chance at winning, as Stanford quickly
regained the lead when Kaplan grabbed one of her
game-high nine rebounds on the offensive glass and
put back two more of her 13 points.
The Cardinal steadily extended its advantage from
there, finally reaching a double-digit lead at 63-53
when freshman forward Tara Har
ington hit her second consecutive
ihree-point attempt with 7:20
remaining. Yet Harrington, who
enjoyed a career-high 16 points to
along with five rebounds on the
night, claimed that her back-to
back treys were not by design.
"I was just trying hard like
everybody else," Harrington said.
Also contributing to Stanford's
momentum was junior guard Kate
Paye, who logged a workmanlike
39 minutes and strung together an
impressive line of nine points, four
rebounds, four assists, three steals
and just one turnover. Paye drove
the final nail in the Cougar coffin
when, after Washington State had
called a timeout at the 3:44 mark
with his squad down 70-61, she
stole the inbound pass.
The Cardinal then held the ball
for the duration of the 30-second
shot clock, with Harrington getting
fouled in the act of shooting a
three-pointer as time expired. Har
rington sank two of three free
throw attempts to put Stanford up
72-61, and the lead would never
shrink below 10 points again.
Two lone second-half bright
spots for Washington State were
senior center Camille Thompson
and junior forward Kireen Ellis.
Thompson, who came in averaging
a team-high 20 points a game,
bucketed seven of her 15 points
after the intermission. Ellis, the
Cougars' second-leading scorer on
the season, did her part to keep the
game close, netting eight of her 10
points in the second stanza.

the final nail in the Cougar coffin
when, after Washington State had
called a timeout at the 3:44 mark
with his squad down 70-61, she
stole the inbound pass.
The Cardinal then held the ball
for the duration of the 30-second
shot clock, with Harrington getting
fouled in the act of shooting a
three-pointer as time expired. Har
rington sank two of three free
throw attempts to put Stanford up
72-61, and the lead would never
shrink below 10 points again.
Two lone second-half bright
spots for Washington State were
senior center Camille Thompson
and junior forward Kireen Ellis.
Thompson, who came in averaging
a team-high 20 points a game,
bucketed seven of her 15 points
after the intermission. Ellis, the
Cougars' second-leading scorer on
the season, did her part to keep the
game close, netting eight of her 10
points in the second stanza.
