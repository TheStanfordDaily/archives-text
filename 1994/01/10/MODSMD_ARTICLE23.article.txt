# 'Growing guns'
## Gymnasts win behind high-scoring freshmen 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
Entering the Spartan Open in San Jose
this past weekend, the two-time defending
national champion Stanford men's gymnas
tics team hoped only to test its early season
skill level.
The Cardinal ended up capturing first
place in the 11-team open due largely to the
outstanding performances of its freshmen.
Stanford accrued a total of 274.3 points to
top second-place New Mexico, which tallied
270.2 points.
"The freshmen were outstanding," said
Stanford coach Sadao Hamada. "I wanted to
see not only the wav they handle their rou

tines but also how they adjust to the pres
sure of collegiate competition. At this level,
the gymnastics is different, and there are a
lot of great athletes to compete against. I
was very impressed by what I saw. The
freshmen were very confident and kept their
cool throughout."
Overall, the Cardinal won four of six total
events. Freshman Keith Wiley led the way
with first-place routines in both the vault
and the high bars, scoring a 9.40 and a 9.50
respectively. Fellow freshman lan Bachrach
secured a first-place finish in floor exercises
with a 9.65, while senior co-captain IVlark
Booth finished first on the parallel bars with
a score of 9.65.
For the vault, Wiley performed a layout

Kasamatsu, which entails a back layout
with a full twist coming off the vault.
Wiley's high-bar routine included a Geinger,
which involves letting go of the bar, flipping,
and catching the bar again, and a double lay
out dismount.
"I stuck my vault, and kept tight form
and stuck my landing in the high bars,"
Wiley said. "That's what I wanted to do. I'm
happy where I am at this point in the sea
son, but I know I still have a ways to go. At
least now I feel more confident and I know
what to expect going into future competi
tions."
Bachrach demonstrated both ability and
cool in his floor routine, which included a
full-twisting double back flip. He advanced

from preliminaries to the final round of
competition as an alternate. In addition, he
was the last to perform and knew how well
he had to do to win. However, none of these
concerns kept him from a first-place outing.
"I was really nervous," Bachrach said.
"It's my first collegiate competition. I'm
happy with where I am right now in the sea
son — I thought I would do a lot worse.
There's still a lot of room for improvement."
Stanford also posted strong perfor
mances on the pommel horse and in the all
around competition. Junior Evan Wells,
who is also in his first year of competition,
captured third place on the horse with a
9.40, while freshman Jamie Ellis led
the way for the Cardinal in the all
around. His 102.6-point total gave
him a fourth-place finish.
Despite such dominance by Stan
ford, however, Hamada agreed with
his freshmen in that the team has

yet to mature.
"This weekend established the
beginning phases of my goals,"
Hamada said. "The athletes got into
competing shape, they performed
their routines, and they are in good
physical shape. I also found out how
we must improve. Some of the rou
tines this weekend were sloppy."
With the knowledge gained from
this weekend, in the upcoming
weeks Hamada will restructure

some of his gymnasts' routines by
increasing their difficulty or formu
lating different combinations of var
ious maneuvers.
"I think we can win the national
championship again," Hamada said.
"I said in the beginning of the year,
' I have no big guns this year.' I don't
have Jair (Lynch) anymore. But I
have four or five medium guns, and
by the end of the year, I will make
sure that they grow to big guns."
