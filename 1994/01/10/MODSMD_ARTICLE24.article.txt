# Digging down deep, wrestlers victorious
## 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
It's said that the strength of a
team lies in its depth. At the Coun
try Classic Open at Cal State-Bak
ersfield on Saturday, the Cardinal
(2-2) proved that a wrestling
team's success is not just deter
mined by its 10 starters.
Of 21 Cardinal wrestlers com
peting at the tournament, 14
placed in the top eight in their
weight division. This is a signifi
cant improvement from last year's
efforts, when only five wrestlers
came away with such honors.
Head coach Chris Horpel was
pleased with the results, and said
they indicate the team's progress
since the beginning of the season.
What made the victories more sig
nificant, however, is that they
came from the team's second and
third-stringers aR well as its
starters, he said.
"A lot of guys that hadn't been
competing caught on fire," said
Horpel. "They just need to com
pete to realize why they're |on the
team|. M

The top Cardinal achievement
came from sophomore Tod Sur
mon in the 150-pound class. The
last time Surmon competed was in
late November at the team's first
home meet against San Francisco
State. Since then, he has been
plagued by injuries and illness.
"I've had troubles putting it all
together for a tournament, but
I've had it in me to win [for a
whilel," said Surmon.
Surmon won the final match
against Enc Heinz of Boise State
with a takedown in the last two
seconds of the final round. Howev
er, his history of injuries continues
to plague him: while winning the
final match, he twisted his knee
and may be out a week.
This is Surmon's first collegiate
win, and he intends to keep his
momentum rolling. "Every win is
a stepping stone toward Pac-lOs,"
he said.
Another winning effort came
from junior Jay Jackson (134),
who was one competitor away
from racking up a division title. He
