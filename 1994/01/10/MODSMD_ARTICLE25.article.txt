The seeds fell as forecasted in the National Col
legiate Tennis Classic Tennis Classic last weekend.
And for Cardinal tennis fans, the results were pre
dictable first- and second-place finishes in the
women's and men's finals, respectively.
On the women's side, Stanford's top-ranked
Lax mi Poruri cruised by UCLA's second-seeded
Keri Phebus 6-2, 6-0, setting a winning precedent
for a match-up that will be repeated many times in
Pacific 10 Conference play.
On the other hand, the top Cardinal man,
Michael Flanagan, was handed a disappointing 6-4,
6-2 defeat by top-seeded Chad Clark of the Univer
sity of Texas. Flanagan was the second seed in the
tournament.
The tournament, played at the Westin Mission
Hills Resort in Mission Hills, Calif., was dominated
by Stanford competitors. The women's bracket fea
tured three seeded Cardinal players in the top
eight, including Poruri, seventh-seeded Kristine

Kurth and No. 8 Katie Schlukebir. All three
advanced to the semifinals of the 28-person field.
Kurth beat the No. 3 seed, Pepperdine's Isabelle
Petrov, in the quarterfinals while Sclukebir top
pled USC's Melissa Hernando, the tournament's
fourth seed.
The upsets stopped in the semifinals, however,
as Kurth stretched Phebus to a three-set, double
tie-breaker match before losing 2-6, 7-6, 6-7.
Schlukebir, a freshman, was vanquished more
quickly by senior teammate Poruri.
The Cardinal men were similarly successful.
Stanford had four players on the 32-player men's
slate, including Flanagan, eighth-seeded Robert
Devens, Jeff Salzenstein and Chris Cocotos. And
while both Salzenstein and Cocotos had fallen by
the quarterfinals, Devens was able to upset fourth
seeded Bruin Robert Janacek to advance and meet
eventual champion Clark. Clark, the second-ranked
player in the country, downed Devens 6-3, 6-4.
In other tennis notes, the Cardinal women's
team fell from the top spot to No. 2 behind Texas in
the national rankings after the fall season.
