# LGBCC also wary of budget cutbacks
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
While the ethnic centers organize
against funding cuts, other student or
ganizations have their fears as well.
At the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center, which receives only
about $7,000 a year from the Office of
Student Activities, concerned students
held an emergency meeting Saturday to
talk about the potential cuts.
Center staff member Rosa De la Vega
said that the meeting, attended by about
20 students, was a forum to disseminate
information to community members
about budget cuts. "A lot of people had
not thought of the budget cuts as affect-
ing the LGBCC. . . . (But) if OSA
is hit, obviously we have reason
for legitimate concern."
In a message posted on a com
puter bulletin board last week, de
la Vega wrote that "rumors I
have heard go as far as to say that
we might lose the LGBCC alto
gether, or in a lesser depth of the
inferno, we may be cubbyholed
too and stripped of the little insti
tutional support we do receive."
"Will we be compelled to take
over President Casper's office if
our community center is taken
away?" de la Vega wrote.
Community center staff mem
ber Natasha Iskander, a senior,
said that at the meeting, students
"talked about what our role
should be as a community" and
"tossed about ideas."
"Our community is at a distinct
disadvantage in this (budget cut
ting) situation," de la Vega said
last night, adding that they had
not had as much interaction with
administrators as had the ethnic
centers. She said that "there was a
general frustration of all the peo
ple there (on Saturday night) that
many of our [members] had been
shut out of the whole recommen

dation process."
De la Vega's bulletin board
report on the meeting said they
decided to demand "more infor
mation and open meetings" and
"more student involvement"
along with "a possible demonstra
tion/protest by which to emphati
cally state our demands and to
show that students' voices can
and must be heard."
Since the community center
serves many people from the eth
nic centers, Iskander said the
threatened cuts are also of special
concern. "We want to offer all the
resources the LGBCC has," she
said, adding that center represen
tatives plan to participate in
Tuesday's Students of Color
Coalition "speak-out."
At the Women's Center, senior
Nicky Michael said that while
they aren't worried about cuts to
their own organizations they plan
to support the Students of Color
Coalition as well.
The Women's Center budget
comes from the Office of Student
Activities and an ASSU special
fee, according to Michael. She
said the center had been told it
need not anticipate budget cuts.
But Women's Center represen
tatives are going to Students of
Color Coalition meetings and
plan to make a statement at the
speak-out, Michael said.
