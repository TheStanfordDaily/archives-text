# Med Center grants to encourage innovation
## 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Innovation is the latest prescription
from administrators at the Stanford Med
ical Center.
Health care providers associated with
the Medical Center will soon be eligible for
grants — worth up to $20,000 — to fund
creative projects that improve care and
save money.
The Small Grants Program, which has
been allocated $200,000 for its first year, is
now accepting applications for the grants,
which will be awarded starting March \ .
"The grants are all supposed to address
improving patient care and saving costs,"
said Janet Bostrom, director of research for
patient care services who administers the
program.
Although the project's funding is corn

ing from the Medical Center's budget, ad
ministrators believe projects funded by the
grants will save money in the long run by
improving efficiency.
Many of the applications "will be to test
whether or not a change will reduce costs,"
said project director Don Holloway, the
hospital's director of management re
search and development.
"Without this research money, perhaps
these changes wouldn't take place," he
added.
Holloway stressed that the program
probably wouldn't result in "earth-shak
ing" changes, but "if we find one positive
change that we can implement throughout
the hospital, it will have been a success."
Holloway said he felt many Medical Cen
ter employees have "great" money-saving
ideas they cannot implement because
of funding constraints. He said he
hopes that in the long run, the propos
als will improve patient satisfaction as
well.
Bostrom said she expected some of
the proposals to look at improving care
in the community, including changes in
the way the center treats chronically ill
patients.
Another example, according to Hol
loway, is studying whether using
"nurse-care managers" to keep in touch
with patients after they are discharged

reduces follow-up treatment costs.
Bostrom added that community
health care providers associated with
the Medical Center — as well as nurses,
pharmacists and medical faculty — can
submit applications to her office for con
sideration.
The application requires that the
proposed project target one of four
areas: efficacy, appropriateness, effi
ciency or organization/management.
Although it has been funded for only
the first year, program administrators
said funding will continue if the pro
gram shows good results in improving
efficiency and saving money. Several
other hospitals nationwide have had
similar programs that have been suc
cessful, Holloway said.
