She just "wasn't loving it anymore."
And with those words, senior Summer
Sanders, a six-time national champion
swimmer for Stanford, completed the final
leg of her professional swimming career.
"Just print that I'm retired," Sanders
told The Daily Democrat of Woodland,
Calif., before addressing a crowd of 250 at
the Yolo County Fairgrounds on Satur-

day. Sanders could not

last night.
Sanders decided to
give up her final two
years of collegiate eligi
bility and swim profes
sionally after helping
Stanford win the 1992
NCAA Championships
during her sophomore.

season. She went on to win two gold
medals, a silver and a hronze at the 1992

Summer Olympics in Barcelona.
But, according to Stanford swimming
coach Richard Quick, she did not take well
to swimming professionally.
"Summer and I had talked about it | her
retiring! a couple times," Quick said last
night. "Professional swimming is much
more individual; not as team-oriented as
collegiate swimming. She missed that
team aspect. . . ISwimmingl became a lit
tle more of ajob."
As her Stanford swimming career indi-

cates, Sanders thrived in "that
team aspect." She came to the
Farm after swimming spectacu
larly in the Goodwill (James in
July 1991 in Seattle, where she
won three gold medals and
announced herself to internation
al competition. The most impres
sive race was her first of the meet,
the 400-meter individual medley
relay, where she bested her previ
ous low time by nine seconds and
defeated 1988 Olympic gold
medalist and former Stanford
swimming star Janet Evans.
Evans had not lost a 400 IM in
three years.
Once a member of the Stanford
team, Sanders continued to make
waves. In her two years of colle
giate competition, she was an
NCAA champion six times. lioth
years, she was named NCAA
Swimmer of the Year. Moreover,
she broke two American records,

in the 200 und 400-meter I Ms.
"She had a fabulous career,"
Quick said.
Then, on May 12, 1992, after
helping the Cardinal to win its first
women's NCAA championship
since 1988-1989, Sanders
announced she was foregoing her
final two years of collegiate eligibil
ity to train full-time for the
Barcelona Olympics. She said that
"this is by far the most difficult
decision I have had to make. It's a
real shame . . . but I feel like there
are certain opportunities that come
along once in a lifetime." She char
acterized her decision as "a gut
feeling," going on to say that "I do
best when 1 go with my gut feel
ing."
After that announcement,
Sanders immediately qualified for
funds underwritten by the U.S.
Swimming Committee and U.S.
Swimming. She also signed with a
representative agency, Advantage
International, and began pursuing
ventures in commercial advertise
ments. Soon she became a familiar
household name, marketing such

high-profile swimming products as
Speedo swimwear.
After her highly-publicized per
formance in Barcelona that sum
mer, Sanders faded from the inter
national swimming scene. Accord
ing to Quick, Sanders did not swim
in any major competitions after
the Olympics, although she contin
ued to train well at Stanford. She
did win the 100-meter butterfly at
Spring Nationals in Nashville,
Tenn., last year, but then took the
summer season off. She continued
to train this fall and competed spo
radically in mostly local meets
while pursuing her bachelor's
degree in communication.
Sanders' Olympic coach Mike
Hastings thought that it was time
for her to move on.
"She'd given it the best she
could and she couldn't give any
more," Hastings said. "The reason
she retired was that she had lost
that extra 5 percent to be competi
tive (at the international level)."
Said Quick, "She just couldn't
recapture the goal of making the
next Olympics."
