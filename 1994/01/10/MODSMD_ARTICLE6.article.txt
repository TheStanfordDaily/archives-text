# Phi Delts apprehend intruder
## 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
The line between fraternity
and neighborhood patrol was
blurred Friday afternoon when
members of Phi Delta Theta
seized a man they found trespass
ing in their house and successful
ly detained him until police ar
rived.
One of the Phi Delts found the
man, later identified as 25-year
old Kenneth Laynard Jackson,
"looking around" in the student's
room, Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said.
The fraternity member made
the logical inquiry as to what the
man was doing there, to which
Jackson gave the logical re

sponse.
"He said he was an undercover
cop," Niemeyer said. "(The stu
dents 1 figured something was
wrong."
After he delivered that "bogus"
story, Jackson's attempt at escape
was thwarted by several Phi Delts,
who pursued and tackled him,
Niemeyer said. The students held
Jackson until police arrived at the
house at 680 Lomita Dr.
"They did a real good job and
called us right away," Niemeyer
said.
Jackson at first gave police a
fake name. As a result, he was
charged with giving false informa
tion to police officers, in addition
to trespassing, impersonating a
police officer and having several

outstanding traffic warrants.
Jackson was booked at San
Jose Main Jail. Bail was set at
$10,118.
Jackson was also in possession
of several fake student IDs from
Stanford and other schools when
he was arrested, according to
Niemeyer.
A suspicious person was report
ed in Kairos earlier the same day,
and although police suspected
Jackson of being the same man,
they could not prove it, Niemeyer
said.
"It's just unfortunate that it
happened," Phi Delt president
Sam Scuilli said of the trespassing
incident. "We're a lot more aware
about locking the doors and stuff
now."
