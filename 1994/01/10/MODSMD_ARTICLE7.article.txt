# Thigh Master and 'Song of Hiawatha,' but no shrimp
## Campus New Year's resolutions 
### Nina Wasow 
It's January, 1994. Have you
made your New Year's resolutions
yet? Better yet, have you been
keeping them? If not, follow in t he
footsteps of some well-known
members of the Stanford commu
nity — and get to it.
University President Gerhard
Casper made a resolution that's
easy to keep. He vowed "never to
eat shrimp again."
Why? Because he suffered a se
vere allergic reaction to shrimp at
both Thanksgiving and New
Year's Day. (His reaction during
Thanksgiving was originally at
tributed to something else.)
John Shoven, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, hadn't thought of any reso
lutions beforehand, so he came up

with some on the '
spot.
He promised \
to be more punc- i
tual in showing p
up at his appoint- |
ments. And he re
solved to "stay in
touch with my
students and my "
academic disci
pline.

"I don't want to get isolated in
the dean's office."
Dean of Admissions James
Montoya made an appeal to his lit
erary side in his New Year's reso
lution. He said that this year he
has "committed to memorizing
some classic poems to recite for
my crazy friends at unexpected
moments."
Montoya then proceeded to re

cite "Song of Hiawatha" for sever
al minutes. Laughing, he conced
ed, "I didn't really expect anyone
to ask!"
ASSU Council of Presidents
member Ron Brown said that in
the coming year he wanted to "try
and get back in touch with all the
friends that I made over the years
here (at Stanford| and at home in
Seattle. 1 just want to keep those
friendships alive."
And Charles Goodan, the Tree,
made a promise we all can relate
to. "Are you ready for my New
Year's resolution?" he asked. "It's
just one word . . . Thigh Master."
But once you've made your
New Year's resolutions, how easy
is it to keep? Shoven aptly
summed it up: "It's like a weight
problem. You've got to keep work
ing on it."
