# Stenstrom to stay on Farm
## QB wants to improve draft chances, complete degree 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Quarterback Steve Stenstrom, who set four
school records and three Pacific 10 Conference
records during the 1993 season, announced on
Friday that he will bypass the National Football
League Draft and return to play football at Stan
ford next year.
Stenstrom, who has a fifth year of eligibility re
maining, decided he would place himself in a bet
ter position for the professional ranks by playing
another season of college football under the tute

lage of Stanford head coach Bill Walsh. Feedback
Stenstrom received from various NFL sources was
inconclusive, as analysts projected him as any
where from a middle-to-late first-round choice to
not being chosen at all.
"I'vegot aspirationsofbeinga first-round draft
pick, and I want to come back to get myself to be in
that position," Stenstrom said.
Walsh feels that Stenstrom, bv staying at Stan
ford another year, should get the high-profile ex
posure needed to become a top choice.


Burt Herman — Daily
Head football coach Bill Walsh watches as quarterback Steve Stenstrom announces at a press con
ference on Friday that he will bypass this year's National Football League draft.
"He'll be a measurably better
player following one more sea
son," Walsh said. "He'll have the
best supporting cast he's had
since he's been at Stanford, and
that will make a difference."
At the same time, Walsh is
quick to note that his senior
quarterback — who passed for
3,627 yards and 27 touchdowns
in 1993 — certainly has the
skills to play professionally right
now.
"Steve is further along than
two out of three NFL quarter
backs in technique, mechanical
ly, and in the decision-making

process," Walsh said. "It's not
hard to note that as you watch
the NFL games. Mechanically
and technically, he's superior,
and he's going to build on that."
Aside from improving his
chances for the NFL, Stenstrom
decided to return to finish his
requirements for a degree in
public policy, which he will com
plete in fall quarter 1994. Plus,
he wanted another chance at the
Rose Bowl.
"Living in Southern California,
the Rose Bowl hype is huge down
there, and I don't want to watch
the game on T.V. another time,"
said Stenstrom, who hails from Kl
Toro, Calif. "I think we have a
chance to make a run at the Rose
Bowl next year, and that's some
thing I came to Stanford to do."

Meanwhile, with Stenstrom
— who was named the team's
Most Valuable Player for the
1993 season — at the helm, the
Cardinal offense will be potent
as ever.
"It puts in the final piece of
the puzzle for our offensive side
of the ball," said offensive coor
dinator Terry Shea. "It will also
allow our younger quarterbacks
to continue to develop, which is a
great benefit. This system truly
tests your mental facilities as
well and another season of devel
opment by the two young fresh
man quarterbacks will really
enhance it."
Today is the deadline for col
lege underclassmen to declare
themselves available for the
NFL Draft.
