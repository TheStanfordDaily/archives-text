### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Quarterback Steve Stenstrom, who set four
school records and three Pacific 10 Conference
records during the 1993 season, announced on
Friday that he will bypass the National Football
League Draft and return to play football at Stan
ford next year.
Stenstrom, who has a fifth year of eligibility re
maining, decided he would place himself in a bet
ter position for the professional ranks by playing
another season of college football under the tute

lage of Stanford head coach Bill Walsh. Feedback
Stenstrom received from various NFL sources was
inconclusive, as analysts projected him as any
where from a middle-to-late first-round choice to
not being chosen at all.
"I'vegot aspirationsofbeinga first-round draft
pick, and I want to come back to get myself to be in
that position," Stenstrom said.
Walsh feels that Stenstrom, bv staying at Stan
ford another year, should get the high-profile ex
posure needed to become a top choice.
