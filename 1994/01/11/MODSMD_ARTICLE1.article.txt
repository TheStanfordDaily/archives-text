# A 						fatal transplant?
## Widow claims husband got AIDS from surgery 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
A woman claiming her husband con
tracted AIDS from a transplant of fatty
tissue during an operation at Stanford
Hospital has filed suit, claiming the
transplant took place without the pa
tient's knowledge and consent.
Hospital officials were served yester
day with a wrongful death lawsuit filed
by Tina Foster in Santa Clara County
Superior Court. Defendants include
the hospital and three of its physicians.
The suit claims that when Foster's
husband underwent surgery to remove
a pituitary tumor in May 1986, doctors
filled the gap with fatty tissue taken
from a heart patient in the hospital.
That tissue, the suit claims, was infect-

Ed with the AIDS virus. Jackie Foster
contracted the disease and died in 1992.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified dam
ages from the hospital, according to
Fred Meis, her attorney. "Stanford's
huge; Jackie and Tina Foster are tiny
people whose lives have been de
stroyed," Meis said.
Experts say the procedure used in
Jackie Foster's operation is highly ir
regular. Dr. Charles Cuono, a professor
of plastic surgery at Yale Medical Cen
ter, told the San Francisco Examiner
that any fat needed in an operation is
normally taken from another part of
the patient's body, not from the body of
another patient.
"I can't think of a single instance
when fat from another individual
would ever be indicated," he said.

Stanford Medical Center spokesman
Don Gibbons declined to comment on
any details of the lawsuit, including
whether Foster's operation involved
any transplant of fatty tissue at all.
Meis said that his client's husband
had been "a regular donor of blood" and
that his blood tests prior to the opera
tion were negative for the HIV virus.
Foster learned he was infected with
the AIDS virus when he attempted to
donate blood again after the operation,
Meis said. Because Foster had no
known risk factors, state and federal
agencies launched an investigation.
"Stanford gave out some informa
tion to indicate that something went
on" during Foster's 1986 operation,
Meis said, and "somehow it came
to light that this person had had
tissue (from another patient]
implanted in his nose."
Foster had neither been
informed that a tissue trans
plant would take place, nor had
he consented to such a proce
dure, according to the com
plaint. The lawsuit claims negli
gence and battery on the part of
the hospital and doctors John
Mehigan, Russell Andrews and
Gerald Silverberg. The physi
cians could not be reached for
comment.
The patient who was allegedly
the source of the fatty tissue
died Dec. 14, 1992, and his HIV
status was unknown, according
to the Examiner. However, the

patient had undergone extensive
transfusions. Twenty-nine of 36
units of blood that the patient
had received were found to be
uncontaminated, but the HIV
status of the seven remaining
units is as yet unknown.
Meis said Stanford Hospital
has been "reluctant to partici
pate and cooperate with the
investigation" and had allowed
investigators contact with only
legal personnel, not medical or
scientific experts.
He also said that names on
the documents provided him by
the national Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) had been blacked
out at the request of Stanford
Hospital. A letter from the CDC
to Meis's firm cited confidential
ity concerns as the reason for
the deletions.
Gibbons said he knew of no
one at the hospital who had been
contacted by the CDC.
