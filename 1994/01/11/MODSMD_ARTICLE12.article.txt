## NATO still divided on how to solve Bosnia crisis

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP)
President Clinton claimed "two
giant steps" for global security
yesterday with a breakthrough
agreement to dismantle
Ukraine's nuclear arsenal and
NATO approval of unprecedented
cooperation with former foes in
Eastern Europe.
Clinton called the Ukrainian
agreement a "hopeful and his
toric" advance And he also hailed
the offer of greater cooperation
with former Soviet bloc nations.
"It is time to bogin welcoming
these newcomers to our neighbor
hood," he said
The upbeat mood at the 16-
nation NATO summit was cloud
ed by lingering division over how
far the West should go to stop the
war in Bosnia, which has claimed
200,000 lives so far.
In the absence of consensus for
tougher action, the leaders moved
toward renewing their unfulfilled
threat of air strikes against the
Serbs if they continue to shell
Sarajevo and block U.N. humani
tarian relief convoys.
French President Francois
Mitterrand urged reinforcement
of U.N. troops in Bosnia. Howev

er, Clinton cautioned that if
NATO renews its military threat,
"We have to mean it. . . . If the
situation does not improve, the
alliance must be prepared to act."
British Prime Minister John
Major urged caution.
"As Bosnia struggles through
another desperate winter of war,
we face very serious questions
which cannot be resolved today,"
Major said.
The day ended with more dis
cussion of Bosnia over a working
dinner at the Val Duchesse on the
wooded outskirts of Brussels. The
heads of states and prime minis
ter laid the groundwork for a dec
laration on Bosnia at the final
NATO session today.
"Now we will sleep on it and we
will come to conclusions tomor
row," Dutch Prime Minister
Ruud Lubbers said.
Even after Clinton's
announcement of the arms agree
ment with Ukraine — the world's
third largest nuclear power —
there were questions about how
fast Kiev would scrap its 1,800
warheads and, indeed, whether
the Ukrainian parliament could
block disarmament as it has in

the past.
And NATO's new "Partner
ship for Peace" for former Soviet
bloc nations left Poland and other
Eastern European countries still
nervous about ethnic rivalries,
political turmoil and aggressive
words from Russian nationalists.
On the arms deal with Kiev,
Secretary of State Warren
Christopher insisted that
Ukraine's president, Leonid
Kravchuk, could enforce it by
executive order
The agreement was concluded
after long and difficult negotia
tions among Moscow, Kiev and
Washington.
The centerpiece of the NATO
summit was the U.S.-sponsored
"Partnership for Peace" offering
military and political cooperation
with former Warsaw Pact rivals
— but not full membership in the
Western military alliance.
The membership ticket would
extend NATO's security protec
tion to nations such as Poland,
Hungary, the Czech Republic and
others concerned about the rise of
Russian ultranationalists and
communists who want to
reassemble Moscow's empire.
