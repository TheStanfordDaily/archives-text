# Yeltsin supporters threaten nationalists

MOSCOW (AP) — With President
Clinton's visit only two days away,
Russia's first post-Soviet Parliament
was emerging as a bitter battleground
of supporters and foes of Boris Yeltsin.
On the eve of today's opening ses
sion of the parliament, the Russian
president's supporters threatened to
prosecute ultranationalists and blamed
Communists for the deaths of millions
of people.
The statements had all the mark
ings of a pre-emptive strike. Yeltsin's
allies are outnumbered by his foes in
the new legislature, and the president's
opponents are expected to waste no
time in attacking his pro-Western

reforms.
Clinton arrives tomorrow in a dis
play of support for Yelstin and his
reform program. He also is expected to
meet with other political leaders.
Hut he has no plans to visit Parlia
ment or meet with Yeltsin's most vocif
erous critics, including Vladimir Zhiri
novsky, who has called Clinton "a cow
ard" who should stay out of Russia.
Yeltsin gained some political ground
at home yesterday with Clinton's
announcement in Brussels of a pact
that will rid the Ukraine of its 1,800
nuclear warheads.
Yeltsin's opponents had accused him
of being too soft on former Soviet

republics — including the Ukraine
that they see as threats to Russian
security and national interests.
The new parliament, which is
intended to mark a new chapter in Rus
sia's young democracy, is already
deeply divided, with extreme national
ists and Communists determined to
undo Yeltsin's reforms. Yeltsin dis
missed the previous parliament, set
ting off a violent backlash by conserva
tives.
Russia's Choice, the main bloc sup
porting Yeltsin, said it would try to
make parliament members face crimi
nal responsibility for statements that
incite hatred or violence.
