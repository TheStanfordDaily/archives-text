Winds aid Australian fires
SYDNEY, Australia (AP) — Hot,
gusty winds abated and a light rain fell,
giving firefighters the break they needed
yesterday against 136 bushfires raging
across southeastern Australia.
During the previous three days, the
winds had whipped up huge firestorms
and the 10,000 firefighters had no
chance of putting out the flames.
