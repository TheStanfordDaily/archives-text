## Editorials Refiguring refunds 
### 
WHILE IT may be little more
than the proverbial finger
in the dike, ASSU Senator
Gabe Lucas' recent proposal to
force fee-refund seekers to request
refunds every quarter instead of
once a year is worthy of support.
Ideally, the fee-refund system
should be abolished — fees
approved in spring elections should
be paid by all, just like taxes in the
real world — but, in lieu of that
simple solution, Lucas' idea is a
step toward fairness.
In the past, fee-refund seekers
had to request refunds each quar
ter and vote in the ASSU's spring
election. Never mind the con
temptible but all-too-frequent
cases of students voting for a
group's fee and then taking their
$0.71 back — at least a little effort
was required to become a hyp
ocrite. But beginning this year, stu
dents could request refunds for
every group for all quarters with

the touch of a button and without
even voting in the election.
This led to a dramatic gouging of
some organizations' budgets,
notably the Stanford Band, the You
Can Make a Difference Conference,
Stanford in Government, the Black
Student Union and MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student group. Making
the situation worse, these are some
of the very groups now threatened
by University budget cuts.
For the ASSU to truly support
student groups, as it claims it does,
it must do something to ensure the
integrity of student groups'
approved funding. If the ASSU
won't drop its absurd fee-refund
system altogether, at least it can
require students to push a button
three times a year to get money
back.
Maybe in the course of doing so,
fee-refund seekers will give a little
more thought to which organiza
tions aren't even worth a few cents.
