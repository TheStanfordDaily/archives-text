# Calling all religions
## 
### 
FINALLY, the ball is rolling.
The Stanford community has
long been in need of one loca
tion where members of all its reli
gious communities can meet. Now,
Dean of Memorial Church Robert
Gregg has gone on sabbatical to fur
ther develop and research his pro
posed multi-faith center.
Dean Gregg should be commend
ed for his efforts to accommodate
community members from various
religious backgrounds and ethnic
groups, even if the project is only in
the blueprint stages at the moment.
Until now, the eerily denomina
tional feel of the non-denomination
al Memorial Church has not been a
proper forum for the joining togeth
er of campus religious groups. The
proposed multi-faith center should
be conducive to a true convocation
of individuals of various beliefs.
The University provides an envi
ronment for the unification of
diverse groups on many different

levels, and it seems only fitting that
it would strive to bring together the
community on a religious level as
well. Creating a forum for the dis
cussion of religious ideas is a natu
ral extension of Stanford's commu
nity-building spirit.
In his investigation of the
world's religions, Gregg would be
well-served to keep the Stanford
community updated on his pro
gress. Since the proposed center
has the potential to be a resource
for many members of the Stanford
community, they should make a
conscious effort to offer suggestions
about what they would like the cen
ter to encompass.
Because the interests of so many
groups rest in Gregg's hands, infor
mation regarding his findings and
plans should remain accessible.
This openness will ensure that the
process will be interactive â€” further
bringing together the diverse cam
pus elements behind this venture.
