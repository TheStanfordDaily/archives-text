## Resisting time's pressures 
### 
I HAVE BEEN BACK ON campus
five days since I returned from
Christmas break on Wednesday.
What does five days mean? I understand
the mathematics of 24 hours in a day,
and the astronomy of planetary rotation
and revolution. However, I must admit
that I do not understand the physics of
time and relativity, whatever that
means.
Why have the last five days felt like
an eternity, while all of Christmas
break passed so quickly? One reason
might be that I have been writing my
thesis since I returned, instead of enjoy
ing the relaxation of vacation life. I
guess there is some truth to the cliche
that time flies when one is having fun.
Wait a minute (whatever that expres
sion means), is that cliche really true?
When I am working on a difficult task
time seems to crawl, but when I finally
reach my deadline I wonder where the
time has gone. So time flies when one
has an imminent deadline, or at least in
retrospect it appears that time flew.
Where did the time go? Did I black out
somewhere along the line?
There are occasions when, contrary
to the notion of blacking out, I feel time
has stopped. These instances include
when I am waiting at the airport for a
friend arriving on a delayed flight, or
when I am sitting in a boring, esoteric
lecture before lunch. The minute hand
just does not seem to move. When frus

trated or confronted with a dilemma, as
was the case this weekend as I worked
on my thesis, time can become oppres
sively lethargic. As you read this col
umn you might very well be experienc
ing this same sensation, induced by
irrelevant introspection on my part.
My point in this time-consuming lit
erary exercise is that the clock, especial
ly those old-fashioned ones which tick
incessantly, is a salient influence upon
our lives. While our actual experiences
are not altered directly by the minute
hand, our psychological perception is
conditioned by what time means in our
society. International crises occur
because decision-makers set artificial
deadlines. Legislators do not address
critical legislation because a particular
time has been set for recess. We run
frantically, with minimal sleep, from
one meeting to another, often only to
discuss schedules.
Is this natural? While there seems to
be a basic human tendency to sleep
while it is dark and toil in the light of
the sun, deadlines and minute-by
minute plans do not seem so natural. In
this sense, it would appear that it was
not the heavy production of the Indus
trial Revolution which created modern
man, but instead the obsession with
time. As railroads were constructed
throughout the Western world in the
19th century this obsession with time
evolved. One had to be cognizant of time

in order to take the appropriate train,
or receive whatever the train was bring
ing into town.
As the importance of time has grown
in human society since the first rail
roads, we can only expect that the com
puter and information ages will intensi
fy time's obsession. In truth, there is
probably nothing we can really do about
this situation. A modern, upwardly
mobile society must be time-exact. Gone
are the days of the Jeffersonian farmer
whose daily plan was dictated bv soil
and sun.
I hope that we do not allow time's
obsession to make our modern society a
psychologically dysfunctional aggre
gate. Stress has become time induced in
the corporate world, in the professional
world, and yes, even in the college
world.
Even though those moments of vaca
tion seem to pass so quickly, we must
savor them when we can escape the
ticking of the clock. I personally resolve
to take more vacations. The solution to
time's obsession is another cliche —
work hard and play hard.

Jeremi would have loved to write more
but he didn't have enough time before
his next class.
