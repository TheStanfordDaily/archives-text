## An enigmatic campus art scene is puzzling to freshman 
### 
HE SITS outside of Annenberg
Auditorium, the concrete pit
which lies beneath the Cum
mings Art Building, the canvas's under
side. He sits on his bulbous tripod, his
thorny knees or elbows pointing at the
sky, asserting his masculinity. And his
pear head, with its snowman carrot
nose and elvin cap is irrepressibly opti
mistic. He beams at the sun and grins
into the rain. So of course they've hid
den him away. He's much too exultant
to be visible to the general public. Keep
him below ground level, keep him
behind some shrubs and above all keep
his back to the mall.
As a freshman, I've quickly acquired
the ability to judge the personalities of
the occupants of a quad or a double
merely based on the few scraps of art
that find their way onto the door. What
may seem an eclectic mix of "Farsides"
and photos is actually an embarrassing
ly revealing psychological self-assess
ment by the room's occupants. The
University as a whole projects a similar

self-interpretation of us, to the tourists
and the students who slip around Stan
ford for 40 minutes or four years. And
since few of us get to see what, if any
thing, is taped to the Caspers' door, we
base our interpretations on the statues
which are scattered about campus. So,
does the University project a positive,
friendly image?
No, best to keep something a little
more somber in the public eye. So now
in Memorial Quad, we have the Rodins.
Cast to be ever-so-slightly unsmooth,
the Rodins can only be described as
"veinous," although "tendonous" does
almost as well. It's not that they are all
tragic; the Thinker, I'm told, has nearly
made up his mind, and some of the
women don't look as though they are
about to deliver the closing lines to a
particularly murderous Shakespearean
tragedy. If it hadn't blocked the clearly
parallel lines of University Avenue from
providing perfect one-point perspective
from Memorial Church, they undoubt
edly would have put Rodin's most

famous sculpture, The Gates of Hell,
right the in the middle of the Quad. Of
course the Financial Aid Office has
gone ahead and claimed the Gate's
motto as its own, regardless.
I guess one has to give the Universi
ty credit; it has occasionally tried to do
something somewhat less plaintive.
Placed, of all places, between the Math
ematics and Statistics Departments, we
have the plastic white park-goers.
When the statue was first erected it
caused a stir of sorts, the first public
statue in Northern California depicting
homosexuality, if I remember correctly.
Perhaps the University anticipated
riots, which would explain the figures'
enigmatic location: when was the last
time mathematicians rebelled en
masse? Social progress being what it is,
the statues, with their slight touches
and morbid expressions, have become
less a protest against homophobia and
more an AIDS memorial. There's noth
ing like testimony to an epidemic to
lighten one's heart.

Now I read there are plans to put up
a totem pole in Roble Wood. I suppose
those more removed from Roble see
this as progress. To me it seems like a
devious ploy to maximize the number of
representations of the human figure
per square foot of ground occupied by
art. Why fiddle with one tragic Rodin
taking up, say 15 square feet, when 20
or 30 morbid heads could be piled atop
one another?
I've taken enough English to know
one can't be cynical and expect his audi
ence to take him seriously for long,
unless he provides something approach
ing a solution. I've spent some time
mulling over the issue, as well as possi
ble endings to this letter. Let me con
clude with this, my pipe dream and my
pitiful, long-overdue punchline.
Couldn't we, perhaps during Pro Fro
Week, hang a banner from Hoover
Tower, bright yellow, with the "Have a
Nice Day" face smiling madly away?
