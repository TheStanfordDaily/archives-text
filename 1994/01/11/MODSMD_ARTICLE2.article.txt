# Bill could make fee refunds harder to get
## ASSU Senate to vote on proposal tonight 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Prodded by the success of last quarter's
fee-refund drive, the ASSU Senate will con
sider a bill tonight that would make refunds
more difficult to obtain.
Under the proposal, students would be re
quired to request refunds each quarter, in
stead of just once for the entire year, as
under the current policy.
"I don't believe a refund is a right," said
undergraduate senator Gabe Lucas, who
wrote the bill. "I believe it's a wonderful priv
ilege for students who are dissatisfied, but
there is also a responsibility to think about
what you're doing."
However, when the bill was introduced
into the Administration and Rules Commit

tee last quarter, some senators character
ized it as a stopgap measure designed to ex
ploit students' ignorance of special fee proce
dures and garner more money for student
groups.
And in light of such arguments, Lucas
conceded that the bill might not be the best
manner for fixing the special-fee system.
"I've come to the conclusion ... that a
special fee change is not the first change that
needs to be considered now," Lucas said.
But Lucas still plans to allow the bill to
come before the senate for a vote. "If the sen
ate wishes to support this policy, then so be
it. This will let it institute a policy," he said.
leaders of student groups also realize
that tweaking the special-fee system will not
solve its underlying problems. "A
lot of generous students have
given us money. . . . We worked
for that," said Steve Russell, chair
of the Publications Board, which
funds student publications
through its fee assessment.
"I can't support bullying or
strong-arming students for fund
ing," he said, referring to Lucas'
bill. "If students express their
apathy toward student govern
ment by requesting refunds, then
the problem isn't the fee-refund
system, it's the ASSU."
Last quarter's refund drive,
which was sparked by graduate
students who felt they lacked a
voice in the ASSU, increased
refund rates by more than 10 per
cent for most student groups,
with 75 percent of the refund
requests coming from graduate
students.
Despite the problems such
budget cuts have created for
groups, Russell supported the
students' right to choose which

groups to fund.
"I think there are a hundred
bills that would enable the ASSU
to better serve students," he said.
"I don't think this is one of
them."
In addition to problems stem
ming from an increase in refund
requests, computer problems in
the ASSU Financial Manager's
office have delayed the issuing
of refund checks from fall quar
ter.
However, according to ASSU
Financial Manager Brian Hillger,
the most recent problem should
be a one-time occurrence. "It boils
down to a problem of switching
over to the UNIX system," he
said.
The refund checks are usually
mailed to students by the eighth
week of each quarter. "The new
system is actually much faster
than the old one," Hillger said,
explaining that the checks should
be ready earlier than usual in the
future.
"We got the checks today and
some of them have already gone
out," he said. "But we're still iron
ing out the more minor details of
the new system."
