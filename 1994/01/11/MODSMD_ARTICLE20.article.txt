## How to create panic in our very own Building 10

An open letter to Condoleezza Hue:
Dear Ms. Rice,
Y< 1 HAVE JUST SERVED us notice
that our centers are faring budget
cuts. To help you make those deci
sions, you have asked us to submit formal
budget proposals as well as a report on
what it is that our centers do.
Quite frankly, the Jan. 17 due date of
these proposals, as well as the rumor that
the centers will be consolidated into a sin
gle building, has caught us entirely off
guard. Over the past few days, we have .
scrambled to meet with our various com
munities and put together these proposals.
As a result, we have allowed the debate to
be defined in terms of such trivialities as
photocopiers rather than engage you on an
intellectual basis.
No more. No speak-outs, no singing, no

dancing, no food and, above all, no forums
to educate the administration.
We are not going to submit a budget
proposal or a report on what we do. Why?
Because there are people in the administra
tion whom you pay a good deal of money to
keep you informed about what we do and
how we serve our communities. Namely,
Dean of Students Michael Jackson and
Vice Provost and Dean for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds.
We strongly suggest that you fire them.
If they don't have the information that
you are asking us to prepare, obviously
they haven't been doing their jobs. At that
point, we will gladly supply you with afore
mentioned budget proposal and report.
You may even find that their salaries
would cover a handful of budget shortfalls,
including our own.
But we suspect that you already know
what it is we do, what our budgets are —
since 80 percent of the budgets go to
salary and benefits — and that you also
know how much you plan to cut from our
budgets. And if that is the case, the two
administrators' jobs can be spared and we

can get down to business.
Obviously, this call for student input is
nothing but a skillful PR move. When the
cuts come, as they obviously will, you are
now free to say to the Stanford community
and the media, "We worked with the stu
dents to make these cuts. We've even
adopted some of their own suggestions.
But they have to prioritize like everyone
else."
So when the inevitable marches and sit
ins and office takeovers occur, you can
point to your so-called efforts to include the
students, thereby discrediting our protests
and avoiding a Western Civilization-style
fiasco.
That's not gonna happen.
We want 12 months of time during
which no budget cuts or consolidation will
occur. During that period, we will sit down
and work out how much money you are
cutting from our funding. We will then go
out — in the best Condoleezza Rice rev
enue-enhancement tradition — and raise
the money. Not just enough money to fund
the difference, but enough to expand our
activities beyond their current scope. Per

haps even enough to meet your own stan
dards set out in the 1989 University Report
on Minonty Issues.
But our concerns go far beyond preserv
ing the ethnic centers; they extend to the
entire student body. The piecemeal, divide
and-conquer approach of the administra
tion masks the fact that you and President
Casper have a vision of what the University
will be. And you are using the budget as a
tool to reshape Stanford in your own image.
That may well be your job. But it is also
your job to be open and honest about what
that vision is, and how students fit — or
don't fit— into that vision.
It's also the job of campus organiza
tions, particularly the Council of Presi
dents, the Faculty Senate and The Stan
ford Daily to force you to be more
forthright with the Stanford community.
That means asking you for specific infor
mation the moment it becomes available,
reporting your refusals to comment on cer
tain issues, and questioning every move
you make. Gorbachev may have swept
through campus in 1992, but the spirit of
glasnost has clearly failed to catch on with

your administration.
If these organizations — including our
own — fail to critically engage the restruc
turing of this University, it falls upon the
individual to do so. An administrator who
threatens to resign. An athlete who refus
es to play. A recruiter who refuses to trav
el. A professor who decides not to teach.
And a student who won't be silent. A cho
rus of uncompromising voices, each of
whom refuses to support a University
that strays so far from what they believe
it should be.
But if even the individual will not speak
up in his or her own defense — well then,
Ms. Rice, you are correct to let the axe fall
where it may. As long as you can live with it.

scrambled to meet with our various com
munities and put together these proposals.
As a result, we have allowed the debate to
be defined in terms of such trivialities as
photocopiers rather than engage you on an
intellectual basis.
No more. No speak-outs, no singing, no

dancing, no food and, above all, no forums
to educate the administration.
We are not going to submit a budget
proposal or a report on what we do. Why?
Because there are people in the administra
tion whom you pay a good deal of money to
keep you informed about what we do and
how we serve our communities. Namely,
Dean of Students Michael Jackson and
Vice Provost and Dean for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds.
We strongly suggest that you fire them.
If they don't have the information that
you are asking us to prepare, obviously
they haven't been doing their jobs. At that
point, we will gladly supply you with afore
mentioned budget proposal and report.
You may even find that their salaries
would cover a handful of budget shortfalls,
including our own.
But we suspect that you already know
what it is we do, what our budgets are —
since 80 percent of the budgets go to
salary and benefits — and that you also
know how much you plan to cut from our
budgets. And if that is the case, the two
administrators' jobs can be spared and we

can get down to business.
Obviously, this call for student input is
nothing but a skillful PR move. When the
cuts come, as they obviously will, you are
now free to say to the Stanford community
and the media, "We worked with the stu
dents to make these cuts. We've even
adopted some of their own suggestions.
But they have to prioritize like everyone
else."
So when the inevitable marches and sit
ins and office takeovers occur, you can
point to your so-called efforts to include the
students, thereby discrediting our protests
and avoiding a Western Civilization-style
fiasco.
That's not gonna happen.
We want 12 months of time during
which no budget cuts or consolidation will
occur. During that period, we will sit down
and work out how much money you are
cutting from our funding. We will then go
out — in the best Condoleezza Rice rev
enue-enhancement tradition — and raise
the money. Not just enough money to fund
the difference, but enough to expand our
activities beyond their current scope. Per

haps even enough to meet your own stan
dards set out in the 1989 University Report
on Minonty Issues.
But our concerns go far beyond preserv
ing the ethnic centers; they extend to the
entire student body. The piecemeal, divide
and-conquer approach of the administra
tion masks the fact that you and President
Casper have a vision of what the University
will be. And you are using the budget as a
tool to reshape Stanford in your own image.
That may well be your job. But it is also
your job to be open and honest about what
that vision is, and how students fit — or
don't fit— into that vision.
It's also the job of campus organiza
tions, particularly the Council of Presi
dents, the Faculty Senate and The Stan
ford Daily to force you to be more
forthright with the Stanford community.
That means asking you for specific infor
mation the moment it becomes available,
reporting your refusals to comment on cer
tain issues, and questioning every move
you make. Gorbachev may have swept
through campus in 1992, but the spirit of
glasnost has clearly failed to catch on with

your administration.
If these organizations — including our
own — fail to critically engage the restruc
turing of this University, it falls upon the
individual to do so. An administrator who
threatens to resign. An athlete who refus
es to play. A recruiter who refuses to trav
el. A professor who decides not to teach.
And a student who won't be silent. A cho
rus of uncompromising voices, each of
whom refuses to support a University
that strays so far from what they believe
it should be.
But if even the individual will not speak
up in his or her own defense — well then,
Ms. Rice, you are correct to let the axe fall
where it may. As long as you can live with it.
Cordially,
The Students of Color Coalition
