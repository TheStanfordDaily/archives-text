## Anderson: another Cardinal great in the making The
						freshman freestylist is already making waves in hopes of smoking her competition in the spring 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
Human beings are land-based
creatures. We breathe air, walk on
stony ground and live our lives

according to the effects of gravity
on our bodies.
You will find some people, how
ever, that consistently try to com
bat this natural tendency. Take,
for example, Stanford freshman

Sarah Anderson.
She spends five hours a day sub
merged in water, toying with that
liquid's (Kid bouyancy effects. But,
considering that she is one of the
hottest young prospects on the

Cardinal women's swimming
squad (and in the nation, for that
matter), wet 'n' wild is just the way
she likes it.
"She's one of the world's best
distance swimmers," said coach
Richard Quick. "She's special —
very, very good, and she's even get
ting better."
Her coaches praise her, and her
peers adore her. Anderson, who
graduated from California High
School in San Ramon, seems to
bring out nothing but the best in
all those who are around her.
"She's very bubbly and always
smiling," said sophomore team
mate Lisa Jacob. "I really enjoy
training with her."
Anderson specializes in long
distances, excelling in the 500-yard
and mile freestyle swim in addition
to the 200 fly. In high school she
finished first in the 500 and 200
free in the North Coast Section
and set records for both events
each year.
"We're very excited that she's
at Stanford," Quick said. "She's
fast developing into one of the
elite."
Anderson first met swimming
rather unexpectedly. In fourth
grade her mother signed her up for
swim lessons without asking her
permission first. Anderson tried to
get out of it, but eventually she
began swimming and has stuck
with it ever since. In this case,
mother truly did know best.
"My parents are a big part of my
success," Anderson said. "They're

always there if 1 want to talk about
swimming, but they're not always
on my back. The fact that they're
here for me but also clueless is
good, because there's no pressure
for me to swim faster or better for
them to be happy."
So she continued to swim recre
ationally and began serious compe
tition her freshman year in high
school.
"She's"one of the hardest work
ers that I've ever seen," said junior
teammate Kendra Thayer. "She's
added a lot to our team. She keeps
us all going."
Anderson kept herself going
throughout high school. When the
time came to choose a college, she
narrowed her list down to two
choices: Stanford and the Univer
sity of Arizona.
The obvious choice was quickly
ascertained.
"I wanted a school that was
good both athletically and academ
ically," Anderson said. "Plus, I
found that this Stanford team was
very easy to get along with."
At first Anderson was a little
intimidated by the prospect of
competing on the elite and highly
respected Stanford squad.
"There were all those big names
on the team, and you hear their
names and wonder, 'Are they
going to like me?"' Anderson said.
"But once you meet them, there's
nothing to be intimidated by."
Quick realizes that Anderson
was a fine catch for his program.
"It was tough to get her," he said.

"We knew that we had a good
chance all along, but a lot of people
wanted her."
Stanford swimming was a true
change of pace for Anderson. "It's
lots and lots and lots of work. It's
been harder than it's ever been for
me — much more intense and
more work with weights."
Her teammates point out that
one of Anderson's greatest qualities
is her contagious smile. She is happy
all the time, even before and during
competitions; she does not believe
that to be successful in competition
you must carry a stern facade.
"I have to take things lightly,"
Anderson said. "If I don't tease
people before my races, I'll turn
into one big ball of stress, tense up
and not be able to do anything."
Anderson is almost a shoo-in to
take that pleasant personality to
the NCAA Championships in
March. Although she's only a
freshman, her coaches have high
expectations of her.
"We expect her to be in the top
three or four at NCAAs in a worst
case scenario," Quick said.
Anderson's personal goals coin
cide with the goals of her coaches
and teammates. "I want to
improve on my times this year and
improve my technique," Anderson
said. "As a team, we want to win
the NCAA championship. I don't
know if that's in the cards, but I'll
do my best to help the team accom
plish that."
