# Under attack!
## Occupational hazard unearthed as players suffer random violence 
### 
In the sports world, the hits
just keep on comin'.
Unfortunately, with increas
ing frequency, the violence is
occuring not on the field, but
off it.
This trend was thought to be

simply a Euro
pean phenom
enon. Riots dur
ing and after soc
cer games were
— and still are —
commonplace.
When tennis star
Monica Seles was
stabbed bv a nut
case eight mon
ths ago in Ger-

many, many felt that it was just
another indication that Euro
pean fans were out of hand.
But with the Seles stabbing,
a line was crossed. The sacred
space between an athlete and
the crowd, between a performer
and the fans, was violated.
And the sanctity of that
space may never be recovered.
At least in the United States,
shots are taken by offensive
linemen, or among competing
NHL hockey players on the
rink. At least that was the
thinking. Until now.
The lines where the court
ends and the spectators begin
are, to most people, still
extremely clear. But to a few,
somehow those boundaries
have become blurred, and it is
these selected despicable souls
who threaten to destroy sports
for the rest of us.
Last Thursday, figure skater

Nancy Kerrigan was clubbed in
the knee by a calculating brute
at the U.S. Figure Skating
Championships in Detroit. One
day remained in the competi

which skaters would represent
America in

the upcoming
1994 Winter
Olympics in
Lillihammer,
Norway.
Th e

What were his motivations?
Why did he do it? Until he is
caught, none of us will know
his rationale. Hut what we do
know is that his act was sick,
his act was vicious, his act was
cruel.
Kerrigan was unable to com
pete in the final day of competi

On Saturday, she was added
to the team by the U.S. Figure
Skating Association, which, at
its discretion, can add mem

able to compete in the Champi

Thursday. At the end of the men's
basketball game against Washing
ton, an overzealous fan charged
the hardwood, body-checking ref
eree Willis McJunkin to the floor,
apparently upset at the officiat
ing. As he was about to hit
McJunkin again, Washington
guard Jason Tyrus hit the fan.
Amazingly, the player was ret
strained by security and directed
toward the lockerroom, while the
fan was able to walk away from
the gym scot-free!
Not only should that fan not be
allowed to return to Maples Pavil

ion, but he should also have been
charged with assault. If people
cannot learn to control them
selves, they should suffer the con
sequences. A prospective night in
the slammer might make someone
think twice before acting upon
their inclinations.
In attending an event, sports
fans have the right to cheer, yell
and boo. But athletes also should
be given the assurance that they
will be allowed to play their sport
without fear of injury being
inflicted by some crazy who paid
for a ticket to watch them.
Otherwise, sporting events
could become like so many other
institutions in a society whose
mores are continually deteriorat
ing. Fans may soon have to under

go body searches and pass
through metal detectors in order
to see a game.
Or maybe, just maybe, if these
