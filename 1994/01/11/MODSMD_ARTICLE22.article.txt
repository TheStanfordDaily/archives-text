# Under attack!
## Occupational hazard unearthed as players suffer random violence 
### 
In the sports world, the hits
just keep on comin'.
Unfortunately, with increas
ing frequency, the violence is
occuring not on the field, but
off it.
This trend was thought to be

simply a Euro
pean phenom
enon. Riots dur
ing and after soc
cer games were
— and still are —
commonplace.
When tennis star
Monica Seles was
stabbed bv a nut
case eight mon
ths ago in Ger-

many, many felt that it was just
another indication that Euro
pean fans were out of hand.
But with the Seles stabbing,
a line was crossed. The sacred
space between an athlete and
the crowd, between a performer
and the fans, was violated.
And the sanctity of that
space may never be recovered.
At least in the United States,
shots are taken by offensive
linemen, or among competing
NHL hockey players on the
rink. At least that was the
thinking. Until now.
The lines where the court
ends and the spectators begin
are, to most people, still
extremely clear. But to a few,
somehow those boundaries
have become blurred, and it is
these selected despicable souls
who threaten to destroy sports
for the rest of us.
Last Thursday, figure skater

Nancy Kerrigan was clubbed in
the knee by a calculating brute
at the U.S. Figure Skating
Championships in Detroit. One
day remained in the competi
tion, which was to determine
which skaters would represent
America in

the upcoming
1994 Winter
Olympics in
Lillihammer,
Norway.
Th e
perpetrator
of this sense
less act still
remains at
large.

What were his motivations?
Why did he do it? Until he is
caught, none of us will know
his rationale. Hut what we do
know is that his act was sick,
his act was vicious, his act was
cruel.
Kerrigan was unable to com
pete in the final day of competi
tion to qualify for the Games.
On Saturday, she was added
to the team by the U.S. Figure
Skating Association, which, at
its discretion, can add mem
bers who did not or were not
able to compete in the Champi
onships.
Whether Kerrigan will be
able to compete in the
Olympics is another matter.
On a smaller, but equally
alarming scale, a similar inci
dent occurred at Stanford's
Maples Pavilion, also on last
