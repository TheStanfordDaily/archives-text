# Getting a second wind
## Sailors start off new year in stellar form 
### Jeremy Stone Staff writer 
The forecasters who picked
Stanford to go to the Rose Bowl this
year were right. They just did not
think the sailing team would be
there instead of the football squad.
The Stanford sailors ended 1993
with a trip to the Sugar Bowl Inter
sectional. Then they started the
new year last Saturday and Sunday
with a trip to the Rose Bowl Inter
sectional in Ix>ng Beach, Calif
From Dec. 28-30, Stanford sent
those of its sailors who reside in the
Southeast to the Sugar Bowl regat
ta in New Orleans. Though many
of the more experienced sailors
were enjoying their vacations else
where, the relatively young group
at New Orleans finished second
among nine schools from around
the nation and defeated the other
nationally ranked squad, Connecti
cut College The victor was host
Tulane, which sent its entire squad.

Despite finishing second overall,
Stanford won the A division, with
the top sailors, by a considerable
margin. The duo of junior skipper
Charles Meade and senior crew
Michele St. Martin surprised
Tulane's former All-American
Peter Katcha and his crew as they
expertly handled the various condi
tions, which "were just about
everything, from very heavy winds
to pretty light stuff," said Stanford
coach Steve Bourdow.
The freshmen combo of skipper
Alice Manard and crew Polly
Brown also gained some experience
and performed well in B division,
earning a solid fourth-place finish.
With much of the squad home for
the holidays, Bourdow said, "Sec
ond is a really good finish."
To ring in the new year, the
squad was re-united at the Rose
Bowl Intersectional in Long Beach
on .lan. 8 and 9. Much like the foot
ball classic for which it is named,
this year's Bowl featured stiff
competition.
Sixteen schools were there
from across the United States,
including Georgetown and five
other top-20 teams. Hawaii was
originally scheduled to partici
pate, but an NCAA regulation

required them to bypass this
event.
The Rainbows' absence did not
remove any of the luster from the
event, however, as Stanford fin
ished second to host Ixmg Beach
State in a nail-biter.
Stanford led after the first day,
but the 49ers earned their first
major win of the year with a
strong showing Sunday. The Car
dinal was within a mere four
points going into the final race
but was unable to catch up, fin

ishing a total of nine points away
from the winners.
In the tightly packed A divi
sion, Scott Sellers and Katherine
Chen finished a very close fourth.
In the B division, Jeremy Mcln
tyre and Don Chennavasin placed
a comfortable second.
"The B division |group| was
hindered by their premature
starts," Bourdow said. "Other
wise, they were kind of dominat
ing their division."
With the fairly moderate condi

tions, Bourdow was happy with
the team's showing. "We were
looking |to place in] the top three.
We were kind of psyched to beat
Georgetown," he said.

The combined Stanford squad
is now ranked seventh nationally,
with the women holding down a
separate No. 4 spot. Stanford will
participate in a few district regat
tas in the upcoming weeks, and
the hectic spring season will begin
with the Stanford Team Race
Intersectional March 5 and 6.
