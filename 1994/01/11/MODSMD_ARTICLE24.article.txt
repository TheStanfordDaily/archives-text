One week into the men's bas
ketball Pacific 10 Conference
schedule, the haves are separating
themseTveTfrom"the"Have-nots in
what is quickly becoming an early
season survival of the fittest.
Five teams emerged from the

weekend's activi
ties undefeated.
Five other squads
emerged winless.
After winning

two Pac-10 games last weekend,
the Cardinal sits in a four-way tie
for first place with No. 5 UCLA,
No. 24 California and USC. No. 6
Arizona lurks a half-game behind
the pack with a 1-0 record in con
ference play.
But what's to follow? UCLA,
Arizona and Cal enter Pac-10 play
as consensus league favorites,
each coming off an appearance in
last season's NCAA Tournament.
With new faces and question
marks aplenty, Washington, Ore
gon and Oregon State should
round out the bottom of the con
ference.

All of which leaves the Cardinal
with Arizona State, USC and
Washington State in the fuzzy no
man's land between postseason
contender and mediocre status. Or
does it? The following is a team
by-team look at the Pac-10, minus

the Cardinal, written in predicted
order of finish.
ARIZONA (12-1 overall, 1-0 in
the Pac-10 this year; 24-4, 17-1
last year) Pac-10 champs five of
the past six years, the Wildcats
should be the class of the confer
ence again. With a 24.5 points-per
game average, senior guard Khalid
Reeves has more than filled the
scoring gap created by the depar
ture of All-America swingman
Chris Mills. Look for Arizona to
end its streak of first-round NCAA
swan songs at two.
The Cardinal has not beaten
the Wildcats since 1989, a streak
that encompasses 11 games. A win
at McHale Center in Tucson this
Saturday would be absloutely
huge for Stanford.
UCLA (9-0, 2-0; 22-11, 11-7)
The Bruins should cruise to their
sixth consecutive NCAA berth, as
the brothers O'Bannon (Ed and
Charles) form a frontline second
to none in the conference. Ed is
currently third in the Pac-10 in
scoring with a 19.0 average, while
Charles leads the league in blocked
shots with a 1.7 mark.
The Bruins' Jan. 22 showdown
with Arizona at Pauley Pavilion
could be the Pac-10 game of the
year.
CALIFORNIA (2-0, 9-2; 21-9,
12-6) For a while, it looked to be a
classic Cal season — buoyed by
their preseason No. 6 ranking, the

Jim Morgan and the rest of the Cardinal will try to match up against
No. 6 Arizona and other Pac-10 contenders this season.
Bears were crushed by a tough
Kansas team and a not-so-tough
Santa Clara squad earlier. But Cal
has won seven straight contests,
thanks to Pac-10 scoring leader
Lamond Murray and assists and
steals leader Jason Kidd.
The first of two much-anticipated
matchups between Kidd and Stan
ford point-man Brevin Knight takf?s
place Jan. 20 at Maples Pavilion.
ARIZONA STATE (5-5, 0-1;
18-10, 11-7) The Sun Devils boast
the conference's best scoring trio in
Stevin Smith, Ron Riley and Isaac
Burton. But the team's fortunes
rest on the health of former Frosh
All-American Mario Bennett, who is
recovering from both knee and ante
rior cruciate ligament injuries. The
signs, however, are positive — Ben
nett scored 27 points last Saturday.
USC (9-2, 2-0; 18-12, 9-9) The
Trojans opened conference play 2-0
for the first time in over a decade,
but have yet to face any ranked
competition. Junior forward Loren
zo Orr leads a corps of talented big

men that provide the brunt of
USC's punch. The backcourt is
questionable.
WASHINGTON STATE (10-4,
0-2; 15-12, 9-9) The Cougars, who
played one of the more grueling pre
season schedules in the Pac-10, lost
a pair of tough road games to Cal
and Stanford last weekend. But the
team opened 0-3 last year before
improving to 9-9. Mark Hendrick
son, a freshman All-America last
year, averages nine boards a game.
WASHINGTON, OREGON
STATE, OREGON <bad last year,
worse this year) The Huskies have
fielded eight different starting line
ups in 11 contests ... which looks
encouraging when compared to the
two Oregon sch<x>ls. Beavers coach
Jim Anderson, a 38-year veteran of
the OSU stafT, says that this year's
team might be the most inexperi
enced he's ever seen.
As for the Ducks, the cover of the
Oregon press guide sums up the
state of the program best. Coach
Jerry Green, surrounded by a black
backdrop, looks concerned as he
glaces into the future. The caption?

but have yet to face any ranked
competition. Junior forward Loren
zo Orr leads a corps of talented big

men that provide the brunt of
USC's punch. The backcourt is
questionable.
WASHINGTON STATE (10-4,
0-2; 15-12, 9-9) The Cougars, who
played one of the more grueling pre
season schedules in the Pac-10, lost
a pair of tough road games to Cal
and Stanford last weekend. But the
team opened 0-3 last year before
improving to 9-9. Mark Hendrick
son, a freshman All-America last
year, averages nine boards a game.
WASHINGTON, OREGON
STATE, OREGON <bad last year,
worse this year) The Huskies have
fielded eight different starting line
ups in 11 contests ... which looks
encouraging when compared to the
two Oregon sch<x>ls. Beavers coach
Jim Anderson, a 38-year veteran of
the OSU stafT, says that this year's
team might be the most inexperi
enced he's ever seen.
As for the Ducks, the cover of the
Oregon press guide sums up the
state of the program best. Coach
Jerry Green, surrounded by a black
backdrop, looks concerned as he
glaces into the future. The caption?

Darwin couldn't have planned
it better himself.
One week into the men's bas
ketball Pacific 10 Conference
schedule, the haves are separating
themseTveTfrom"the"Have-nots in
what is quickly becoming an early
season survival of the fittest.
Five teams emerged from the

weekend's activi
ties undefeated.
Five other squads
emerged winless.
After winning

two Pac-10 games last weekend,
the Cardinal sits in a four-way tie
for first place with No. 5 UCLA,
No. 24 California and USC. No. 6
Arizona lurks a half-game behind
the pack with a 1-0 record in con
ference play.
But what's to follow? UCLA,
Arizona and Cal enter Pac-10 play
as consensus league favorites,
each coming off an appearance in
last season's NCAA Tournament.
With new faces and question
marks aplenty, Washington, Ore
gon and Oregon State should
round out the bottom of the con
ference.

All of which leaves the Cardinal
with Arizona State, USC and
Washington State in the fuzzy no
man's land between postseason
contender and mediocre status. Or
does it? The following is a team
by-team look at the Pac-10, minus

the Cardinal, written in predicted
order of finish.
ARIZONA (12-1 overall, 1-0 in
the Pac-10 this year; 24-4, 17-1
last year) Pac-10 champs five of
the past six years, the Wildcats
should be the class of the confer
ence again. With a 24.5 points-per
game average, senior guard Khalid
Reeves has more than filled the
scoring gap created by the depar
ture of All-America swingman
Chris Mills. Look for Arizona to
end its streak of first-round NCAA
swan songs at two.
The Cardinal has not beaten
the Wildcats since 1989, a streak
that encompasses 11 games. A win
at McHale Center in Tucson this
Saturday would be absloutely
huge for Stanford.
UCLA (9-0, 2-0; 22-11, 11-7)
The Bruins should cruise to their
sixth consecutive NCAA berth, as
the brothers O'Bannon (Ed and
Charles) form a frontline second
to none in the conference. Ed is
currently third in the Pac-10 in
scoring with a 19.0 average, while
Charles leads the league in blocked
shots with a 1.7 mark.
The Bruins' Jan. 22 showdown
with Arizona at Pauley Pavilion
could be the Pac-10 game of the
year.
CALIFORNIA (2-0, 9-2; 21-9,
12-6) For a while, it looked to be a
classic Cal season — buoyed by
their preseason No. 6 ranking, the


Victor Cheng Daily file
Jim Morgan and the rest of the Cardinal will try to match up against
No. 6 Arizona and other Pac-10 contenders this season.
Bears were crushed by a tough
Kansas team and a not-so-tough
Santa Clara squad earlier. But Cal
has won seven straight contests,
thanks to Pac-10 scoring leader
Lamond Murray and assists and
steals leader Jason Kidd.
The first of two much-anticipated
matchups between Kidd and Stan
ford point-man Brevin Knight takf?s
place Jan. 20 at Maples Pavilion.
ARIZONA STATE (5-5, 0-1;
18-10, 11-7) The Sun Devils boast
the conference's best scoring trio in
Stevin Smith, Ron Riley and Isaac
Burton. But the team's fortunes
rest on the health of former Frosh
All-American Mario Bennett, who is
recovering from both knee and ante
rior cruciate ligament injuries. The
signs, however, are positive — Ben
nett scored 27 points last Saturday.
USC (9-2, 2-0; 18-12, 9-9) The
Trojans opened conference play 2-0
for the first time in over a decade,
but have yet to face any ranked
competition. Junior forward Loren
zo Orr leads a corps of talented big

men that provide the brunt of
USC's punch. The backcourt is
questionable.
WASHINGTON STATE (10-4,
0-2; 15-12, 9-9) The Cougars, who
played one of the more grueling pre
season schedules in the Pac-10, lost
a pair of tough road games to Cal
and Stanford last weekend. But the
