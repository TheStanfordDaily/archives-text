# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
The new year and new athletic season has
ushered in another pasture full of sensational
freshman on the Farm. After a tremendous
autumn quarter showing by the newest mem
bers on campus, the freshmen are at it again,
reaping in both of the Athlete of the Week
selections this time around.
Springing to the forefront of men's gym

nastics is Vero Beach, Fla., native Keith Wiley,
a former U.S. Junior National Team member.
He is joined as this week's selections by bas
ketball standout Tara Harrington, a freshman
with an equally impressive resume.
Wiley stormed onto the Stanford athletic
scene last weekend at t he Spartan Open, where
he helped the defending national champions
capture their first tournament win of the sea
son. Keyed bv a difficult Geinger release move
on the high bar, Wiley's routine secured a first
place finish in that event with a 9.50.
To top off the evening, Wiley vaulted to
another first-place finish by performing a lay
out Kasamatsu on the horse. Flying ofT the
vault with a back layout and full twist earned
the admiration of the judges as they rewarded
him with a 9.40 and the gold medal.

In Cardinal athletics, one gold-medal per
formance deserves another and Harrington
answered the call Saturday night during Stan
ford's 82-67 victory over Washington State.
Tallying a career-high 16 points, the hoop
ster from Klamath Falls, Ore. has made an
immediate impact on the Maples Pavilion par
quet and looks to be a solid fixture on the team
for years to come.
Against the Cougars, Harrington picked up
the slack late in the fourth quarter as she
scored 14 of her 16 points with less than eight
and one-half minutes remaining on the clock,
proving to be the difference in the ballgame.

Powering her offensive surge was an impres
sive two-of-three shooting from the three
point line and an identical statistic from the
charity stripe.
On the season, Harrington is also fourth in
the Pacific 10 Conference from the free throw
line, tossing in more than eight of every 10
freehies she attempts for a .815 average
