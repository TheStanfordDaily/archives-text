# Professor blasts off with NASA appointment
## 
### Anna E. Arreola 
Engineering Prof. Bradford
Parkinson will soon play a critical
part in the revival of NASA, after
his appointment last week to head
the administration's advisory
council.
Parkinson currently manages
the internationally recognized
Gravity Probe B, a 30-year, $100
million effort by Stanford scien
tists to test Einstein's theory of
relativity.
His appointment last Thursday
accompanied other leadership
changes in major NASA operations,
which reflect an effort to improve

NASA's management in the face of
budget cuts and prospects for inter
national cooperation.
The council, which advises
NASA on policy issues, will meet
about four times annually starting
this February, Parkinson said.
As an adviser, he said he would
stress the importance of adopting
projects that are "innovative,
challenging and affordable."
He also said that he supports
the idea of international coopera
tion. "I It 1 is a cost-effective way to
further scientific knowledge and
technology," he said. "The Rus
sians have cheaper booster capa
bility, for example."

Prof. George
Springer, chair
man of the Aero
nautics and
Astronautics
Department, said
Parkinson's
involvement with
Gravity Probe B
and the Global
Positioning Sys-

tem qualify him for the council.
"I think IParkinsonJ will
tremendously help NASA to
transfer the aerospace industry
into civilian uses," Springer said.
Prof. Francis Everitt, a physi
cist working with Gravity Probe

B, also applauded Parkinson's
assignment to the council. "1
think it's a very inspired appoint
ment for INASA administrator
Daniel) Goldin to make," he said.
Everitt said that Goldin's visit
last year to Stanford's aeronau
tics facilities influenced the deci
sion to appoint Parkinson.
Goldin decided that "NASA needs
to find new ways of doing things,
including new ways of involving
universities," Everitt said.
"From the experience he's
gained at Stanford, 1 Parkinson |
will help in the whole business of
making NASA more efficient,"
Everitt added.
