# Mentor blends citizenship, community service

As the first Visiting Mentor to the Haas
Center for Public Service, Tony Massengale is
doing what he does best: bringing organiza
tions together.
Offering a preview to the seminar he will be
leading while on leave from his community
building duties in Los Angeles, Massengale
presented a discussion last night at El Centro
Chicano titled "Crisis in Governance: A Call
for Citizen Leadership" to 50 student and
community activists from an equal number of
organizations.
He espoused a strong civic structure as the
"bridge and link" between community ser
vices, drawing on more than 20 years of expe
rience in his field, including five as the head of
Building Up Los Angeles, the nation's largest
gang-prevention coalition.
Claiming that Americans "don't have a

tight enough grip on their tradition of citizen
ship," Massengale called for a renewed dedica
tion to civic politics and their original purpose
of "public problem solving."
Massengale made a connection between
community service programs in Los Angeles
and the gangs they struggle to contain,
adding that in the last decade these organi
zations have seen a gradual decay into
regionalism, ethnic isolationism and delin
eation of "turf' along the same lines as the
gangs.
He was careful during the presentation to
make the point that leaders need to put aside
their own agendas and look to close the funda
mental fractures that repeatedly appear in
communities.
The keys to this, he said, are in reducing
and blurring the current adversarial relation
ship between government and the governed.
This could be done by gathering together "the

missing pieces" among citizens and educating
them about the fundamental power structure
that unites them.
"The civic leader needs to be able to see
every person as a potential ally," Massengale
said. From that point, the civic leaders should
continue their open-mindedness, he said, and
unlock both community and civic energy by
understanding that individuals are motivated
by self-interest.
Looking back to his days as a college stu
dent and aspiring civic leader, Massengale
stressed the idea of networks of community
activism programs.
The grassroots structure would allow for
the mentorship that he feels is currently lack
ing in the alienated and adversarial govern
ment bureaucracy.
Many fault that bureaucracy for the civic
failures both within Los Angeles and beyond,
he said.
