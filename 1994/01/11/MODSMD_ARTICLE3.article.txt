# Report: academics central to centers
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Editorial staff 
The initial draft of Dean of
Students Michael Jackson's re
port on ethnic centers recom
mends that the centers concen
trate more on the academic mis
sion of the University while find
ing better ways to collaborate.
Jackson distributed copies of
the draft, which is about 30
pages, to student leaders of the
ethnic centers in a 90-minute
meeting he held yesterday to dis
cuss issues brought up by im

pending budget cuts.
The draft is the first of two
parts; the second half will be dis
tributed in a week or so, when
student leaders of the ethnic cen
ters will also give him their re
sponses to the first half.
Most of the 15 to 20 students
who attended yesterday's gather
ing plan to meet with their com
munities this week to discuss and
prepare feedback on the recom
mendations.
The recommendation from the
draft's second half will focus main
ly on the centers' student affairs
and activities — their tangible
functions rather than their formal
purposes.
The completed report, which is
part of the effort to slice 15 to 30
percent of the Student Affairs bud
get, is expected to be sent to Vice
Provost and Dean for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds in about
two weeks.
Essentially, Jackson said, the
recommendations released yester
day look at ways in which ethnic
centers already uphold Stanford's

academic mission — such as retain
ing minority students and support
ing libraries, Asian-American stud
ies and the Martin Luther King
Papers Project — and how they can
be used as models for the future.
"The recommendations aren't
all startling new," he said. "We rec
ognize that many are already in
place. We're just saying that these
programs are worthwhile and
should be continued."
The draft also recommends
ways in which the four ethnic cen
ters can give each other more sup
port — such as holding their annu
al programs together and sharing
equipment and facilities — while
remaining distinct.
Jackson was careful to stress
that the draft was not suggesting a

merger of the four centers. "Some
activities will be done together, but
there will still be four separate
directors," he said. "The programs
will still have individual missions."
Stanford American Indian
Organization co-chair Myra Parker
said she thought the report "was
pretty reasonable. It's more of an
informative piece rather than look
ing at specific cuts."
Parker characterized the recom
mendations as "building on what is
already there."
However, though the draft is
helpful in providing information
about the ethnic centers, Parker
said it is presently too general to be
a cause of real concern or assur
ance, but she added that it is "good
in providing information."
