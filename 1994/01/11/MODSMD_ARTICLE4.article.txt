### Cametra Thompson Staff writer 
Despite anticipated changes in
the medical profession and a
slumping economy that hurt de
mand for other professional
schools, applications for admis
sion to the School of Medicine in
creased this year by a record 13
percent.
Many of the 6,387 students
competing for the 86 spaces in
Stanford's incoming class have
the same reasons for applying,

said Judith Colwell, assistant di
rector of the Medical School Ad
missions Office: "Most of them
want to help people, either
through research or clinical
work."
Colwell said, though, that she is
not sure what caused the sharp in
crease, noting that Stanford's
record-breaking applicant pool re
flects a nationwide trend of soar
ing numbers of applications to
medical schools.
