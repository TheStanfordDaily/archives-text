# New sex assault educator ready to make impact
## 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
If new sexual assault prevention educator Angeli
na Cheney seems, well, as young and unpretentious
as any typical Stanford student, it's because just last
quarter she was one.
"I feel like I've been thrown into another uni
verse," Cheney said, admitting to more than a little
surprise upon landing the position.
Cheney, a senior majoring in American studies,
stepped in last week to assume the full-time role at
Cowell Student Health Center and is stopping out as
a Stanford student until the end of the year.
While Cheney has a record of involvement in
women's issues in academic, extracurricular and
community spheres, she is disarmingly straightfor
ward about her unfamiliarity with much of the of
fice's workings, adding that "the budget is somewhat
of a mystery to me."
By the end of her term, though, Cheney should be
well versed in budgetspeak, since she will have to sub
mit a special-fee request this spring to keep her
ASSU-funded position solvent.
She will also be responsible for organizing next
fall's freshman Orientation program "Sex in the
'90s" and for coordinating the cam
pus's other sexual assault resource
coalitions.
In addition, Cheney said that
one of her priorities is getting more
men into the ofTice.
"I'd want to have more pro
grams for men and to get more of
them involved with the (Stanford)
Men's Collective," she said.
"I'd also like to get rid of some of
those stereotypes about the men
involved with these programs,"

Cheney added, "though obviously I
myself will not be able to single
handedly debunk those stereotypes."
Cheney replaces former sexual
assault prevention educator Caro
line Mitchell who departed last
month after her one-year term
ended.
She credits a nine-week self
defense class for women she took
during her sophomore year with
having "a great impact on the way I
thought about the issues.
"There was a strong group of
women to talk and learn with about
our ideas and experiences in a way
you don't do usually in classes at
Stanford," she said.

And if another one of her goals
— the continuation and improve
ment of relationships and programs
with special ethnic communities —
echoes that of her predecessor, it
makes sense since Mitchell was
Cheney's self-defense instructor.
Cheney went on to teach week
end self-defense classes herself , an
experience she values as "one of the
best things I've ever done, facilitat
ing the learning (of others)."
Her experiences extend outside
Stanford as well. This past summer
she trained with a sexual assault
support service where she learned
about societal conditions surround
ing sexual assault.

She is eager to continue her
work at Stanford through the Cow
ell Sexual Assault Resource Center.
"Everybody here is really dedicat
ed," Cheney said. "It's exciting
because this is really about stu
dents helping themselves, and
we're here to further that process."
Cheney was chosen from a pool
of 50 candidates by a search com
mittee comprised of Mitchell, Cow
ell staffers and student leaders in
campus sexual assault prevention
organizations.
"We're delighted to have her,"
said Carole Pertofsky, director of
the Cowell Health Promotion Pro
gram.
