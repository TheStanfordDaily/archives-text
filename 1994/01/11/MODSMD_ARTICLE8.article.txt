# Dignitaries, employees to dedicate SLAC B factory
## 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
At a ceremony this afternoon, U.S. En
ergy Secretary Hazel O'Learv will inaugu
rate the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter's new B factory facility in front of an es
timated 800 SLAC employees and digni
taries.
The $177 million Department of Energy
project, which President Clinton awarded
to Stanford in October, represented a wel
come shot in the arm for the federally fund
ed center, which had faced the prospect of
significant budget cuts.
In addition to ensuring that hundreds of

workers would keep their jobs, the decision
also pave the center much-needed direction
as it enters the next century.
Several members of California's con
gressional delegation — including Sen.r
Dianne Feinstein and Reps. Anna Eshoo
and Norman Mineta — will be present at
the SIJU' ceremony. Before the inaugura
tion, they will also go on a special tour of
the facility's future site and see a model of
the finished H factory.
The inauguration ceremony, scheduled
to take place after the tour, will include
speeches from SLAC Director Burton
Richter and Provost Condoleez
za Rice, as well as O'Leary.
Since all SLAC employees have
been invited, as many as 800
people may attend the event,
according to Richter's office.
After her speech, O'Leary
will officially inaugurate the
new facility by using a crane to
lift the first magnet out of the
old Positron Electron Project
(PEP) ring, which is being
upgraded to create the new B

Factory.
Now silent, the PEP ring
will be refurbished and a new
ring will be built next to it.
When construction is complet
ed in 1998, SLAC scientists will
use the two rings to accelerate
and collide positrons and elec
trons.
By studying the particles —
called B-mesons and anti B
mesons — that these collisions
produce, scientists hope to
observe key differences between
matter and antimatter. These
differences may explain why the
vast majority of the observable
universe is made up of matter.
