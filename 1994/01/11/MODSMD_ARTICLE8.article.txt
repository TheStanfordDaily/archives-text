# Dignitaries, employees to dedicate SLAC B factory
## 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
At a ceremony this afternoon, U.S. En
ergy Secretary Hazel O'Learv will inaugu
rate the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter's new B factory facility in front of an es
timated 800 SLAC employees and digni
taries.
The $177 million Department of Energy
project, which President Clinton awarded
to Stanford in October, represented a wel
come shot in the arm for the federally fund
ed center, which had faced the prospect of
significant budget cuts.
In addition to ensuring that hundreds of

workers would keep their jobs, the decision
also pave the center much-needed direction
as it enters the next century.
Several members of California's con
gressional delegation — including Sen.r
Dianne Feinstein and Reps. Anna Eshoo
and Norman Mineta — will be present at
the SIJU' ceremony. Before the inaugura
tion, they will also go on a special tour of
the facility's future site and see a model of
the finished H factory.
The inauguration ceremony, scheduled
to take place after the tour, will include
speeches from SLAC Director Burton
