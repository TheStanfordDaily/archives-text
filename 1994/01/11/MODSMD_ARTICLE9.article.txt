# CUE creates new committee
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
In its final collective meeting before
splintering into subcommittees, the Com
mission on Undergraduate Education yes
terday approved the creation of a working
group to study the role of technology in the
classroom, but decided against a commit
tee on overseas studies.
The formation of a subcommittee on
"technique and technology in teaching and
learning" brings to six the number of un

dergraduate issues that will be examined
bv the small panels over the next three
months.
Commission chair James Sheehan said
the commission wrapped up other bits of
unfinished business and reconfirmed the
list of the subcommittees created at theend
of last quarter. "I t was a transitional meet
ing," he said.
The subcommittee on technology was
informally approved last quarter but had
not been given its charge, Sheehan
said. The commission yesterday
"agreed that the committee can
now start operating, and we hope
to get two student members as
soon as possible." Student mem
bers of the other working groups
will be announced at tonight's
ASSU meeting.
The commission's decision not
to form a seventh group to examine
overseas studies was informed by
the assumption that the issue
would arise in the work of the other
subcommittees, Sheehan said.
"Our conclusion was that we
would deal with [overseas studies]
as it appears in different subcom
mittees," he said. "It's obviously

related to the language require
ment and [distribution require
ments! and will come up in each
case."
With the adjournment of yester
day's session, the commission
enters its critical second phase of
investigating the issues identified
in the fall, a step toward hammer
ing out specific proposals this
spring. To that end, Sheehan set
the next meeting of the full com
mission for Feb. 14. "In the mean
time," he added, "I hope the sub
committees will have made consid
erable progress."
Commission members are "all
kind of energized to get going on
our subcommittees," said David
Lowell, the graduate student repre
sentative on the commission who
will sit on the subcommittee on
academic environment.
"(Sheehan) has done a good job

of guiding us to some tangible
deliverables and steered us away
from the danger of being so broad
that we don't arrive at any clear
items of reform," he said. "And yet,
he's kept some of the broader
issues on the general commission's
platter."
Likewise, Sheehan said that the
commission "recognizes there may
be some things we haven't thought
about yet," but expressed satisfac
tion with the footing the commis
sion has reached after three
months of largely abstract discus
sion.
"I think we're at that stage of
general agreement on the
issues. .. . We've staked out the
territory we want to explore," he
said. "We accomplished what I
hoped to accomplish in the fall —
establish a shared commitment to
an agenda."
