# Students rally for ethnic centers
## Minority leaders voice concern about upcoming budget cuts 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
Five days of emergency meetings and Ilth
hour planning culminated yesterday in a rela
tively sedate speak-out at White Plaza by stu
dent minority leaders to protest possible im
pending funding cuts to the campus' ethnic
centers.
On a bright and unseasonably warm after
noon, various speakers issued dark forebod
ings that cuts to the centers could mean drastic
reductions in staffing, programming and the
disintegration of support structures for stu
dents of color.
But perhaps reflecting the general uncer
tainty that still shrouds the entire budget-cut
ting process — which aims to slash $18-20 mil
lion from the University's operating budget by

1997 — the roughly 300 spectators who at
tended the speak-out responded with strained
enthusiasm and even a bit of indifference.
Meanwhile, University administrators
raised concerns that the ethnic centers' sense
of being targeted may be premised on some
what erroneous information on how deep and
sweeping the proposed cuts will be. As such,
Provost Condoleezza Rice said she will attend a
forum tonight at Cubberley Auditorium to
douse some of the "more dramatic" claims
made by student leaders.
"I think it's fine for people to voice their
views — no one has to convince me of the im
portance of ethnic centers," she said. "|But| I
am less responsive to simply trying publicly to
make your case, rather than engaging in a
strategic planning process."
Neither Rice nor University President Ger

hard Casper, who is currently on the East
Coast, attended yesterday's demonstration.
"It is a beautiful day today, and maybe that
means beautiful things will come of it," An
drew Lisac, resident fellow at Muwekma-Tah-
Ruk, said at the rally. Lisac later surmised that
eliminating the salary of "one senior manager
or faculty member would equal the amount of
cuts to student services."
But that kind of eyebrow-raising suggestion
was not largely in evidence for the majority of
the rally, as student speakers focused more on
selling the merits of the various centers than
openly criticizing any specific University bud
get proposal.
"Ethnic centers are our homes — the people
there are our family," said junior Lisa Lee, the

Sophomore Vanessa Alvarado and some fellow members of MEChA
listen to a speaker during yesterday's student rally in White Plaza.
