# Students rally for ethnic centers
## Minority leaders voice concern about upcoming budget cuts 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
Five days of emergency meetings and Ilth
hour planning culminated yesterday in a rela
tively sedate speak-out at White Plaza by stu
dent minority leaders to protest possible im
pending funding cuts to the campus' ethnic
centers.
On a bright and unseasonably warm after
noon, various speakers issued dark forebod
ings that cuts to the centers could mean drastic
reductions in staffing, programming and the
disintegration of support structures for stu
dents of color.
But perhaps reflecting the general uncer
tainty that still shrouds the entire budget-cut
ting process — which aims to slash $18-20 mil
lion from the University's operating budget by

1997 — the roughly 300 spectators who at
tended the speak-out responded with strained
enthusiasm and even a bit of indifference.
Meanwhile, University administrators
raised concerns that the ethnic centers' sense
of being targeted may be premised on some
what erroneous information on how deep and
sweeping the proposed cuts will be. As such,
Provost Condoleezza Rice said she will attend a
forum tonight at Cubberley Auditorium to
douse some of the "more dramatic" claims
made by student leaders.
"I think it's fine for people to voice their
views — no one has to convince me of the im
portance of ethnic centers," she said. "|But| I
am less responsive to simply trying publicly to
make your case, rather than engaging in a
strategic planning process."
Neither Rice nor University President Ger

hard Casper, who is currently on the East
Coast, attended yesterday's demonstration.
"It is a beautiful day today, and maybe that
means beautiful things will come of it," An
drew Lisac, resident fellow at Muwekma-Tah-
Ruk, said at the rally. Lisac later surmised that
eliminating the salary of "one senior manager
or faculty member would equal the amount of
cuts to student services."
But that kind of eyebrow-raising suggestion
was not largely in evidence for the majority of
the rally, as student speakers focused more on
selling the merits of the various centers than
openly criticizing any specific University bud
get proposal.
"Ethnic centers are our homes — the people
there are our family," said junior Lisa Lee, the

first speaker. "To take them out
would be to wipe out what is inte
gral to Stanford." She added that
"we are not asking for more, we
are fighting to keep what we
have."
Lee contended that cuts could
eliminate the "human resources"
from the centers, and that the cen
ters' already modest funding
means their "long-term health is
threatened."
Sophomore Nicole Vasquez,
arguing that the centers are "alive
and vital," said that all ethnic pro
gramming "serves a purpose for
the ethnic community."
"These programs are not discre
tionary," she said. "We should
remind the University to work for
our people."
Casa Zapata Resident Fellow
Cecilia Burciaga pointed out that
the ethnic centers combined cost
less than the Bechtel International
Center, and advised students to
look beyond the particular details
of the proposals. "Do not let The
Daily make an issue of Xerox
machines and computers," she
said. "This is about the affirmation
of a legacy — the centers are where
the past, present and future need

to be kept alive."
Succeeding students spoke
against the potential for "consoli
dation" of services of the centers,
charging that ideas currently being
discussed for reducing costs
include proposals that would force
the centers to share facilities and
staff. "We don't have many
specifics," said sophomore Michelle
Fowles, "but it doesn't look very
promising."
Dean of Students Michael Jack
son, who on Monday released to
community leaders the first part of
a draft "strategic plan" for the cen
ters, watched about half of yester
day's rally and said he was "really
pleased people took the time to be
thoughtful and organize in ways
that bring people together." But he
said that "I don't think all their
information [about the cuts) is cor
rect."
"There is not going to be consol
idation into one program," he said,
at one point shaking his head at
one of the speakers. "[But] it won't
mean that they won't have to share
resources to an extent — meeting
rooms, Xerox machines, telephones
— but that's happening every
where throughout the University.
It isn't unusual."
As the rally neared its close, the
comments of the students — some
of whom had not been scheduled to
speak — became more pointed,

stirring the thinning crowd that
had remained up to that time fairly
subdued. "Be aware that there's a
master plan," said junior Keri
Bolding. "They want to consolidate
(servicesl, stick all the communi
ties in one center — it's all a part of
a big plan."
In perhaps the day's most
impassioned speech, senior Kwame

affirmation of a lega
cy — the centers are
where the past, pre
sent and future need

Yao Anku rebuked many of the
earlier speakers for not "moving
past ethnicity and having a plat
form."
"What do you look like being part
of the Black Student Union coming
out here saying we don't want to
share photocopies, while beautiful
black men, women and children
don't have jobs ... this is what we
have to be fighting," he said.
"Multiculturalism isn't the

issue. We live in one culture — we
can't celebrate diversity. We live in
one culture, that's why we're
catching hell, all of us," he added.
"Multiculturalism is out — when
ever Jean Fetter and Casper are
celebrating it, you know you're cel
ebrating the wrong thing."
After the speak-out, students
seemed to feel that while the
intended message of the ethnic cen
ters' value was conveyed, the issues
surrounding proposed cuts
remained murky.
"I think it was pretty effective,"
said junior Juan Iberra. "(But|
there's a lot of room for clarifica
tion — people have a general sense
of what's happening, but I don't
think the whole picture is clear."
Rice, who did not attend the
rally, said that "certainly some of
the wilder things that have been
said (like) elimination or consolida
tion seem to me quite far-fetched
— I don't know what produced
them."
She denied that there is any
"master plan" aimed at weakening
ethnic centers. "I don't know
where that idea comes from," she
said. "I will object vigorously to
anyone's insinuation that 1 do not
understand the importance of eth
nicity or am part of any effort to
undermine this University's com
mitment to minorities, and ethnic
centers themselves."

Cecilia Burciaga pointed out that
the ethnic centers combined cost
less than the Bechtel International
Center, and advised students to
look beyond the particular details
of the proposals. "Do not let The
Daily make an issue of Xerox
machines and computers," she
said. "This is about the affirmation
of a legacy — the centers are where
the past, present and future need

to be kept alive."
Succeeding students spoke
against the potential for "consoli
dation" of services of the centers,
charging that ideas currently being
discussed for reducing costs
include proposals that would force
the centers to share facilities and
staff. "We don't have many
specifics," said sophomore Michelle
Fowles, "but it doesn't look very
promising."
Dean of Students Michael Jack
son, who on Monday released to
community leaders the first part of
a draft "strategic plan" for the cen
ters, watched about half of yester
day's rally and said he was "really
pleased people took the time to be
thoughtful and organize in ways
that bring people together." But he
said that "I don't think all their
information [about the cuts) is cor
rect."
"There is not going to be consol
idation into one program," he said,
at one point shaking his head at
one of the speakers. "[But] it won't
mean that they won't have to share
resources to an extent — meeting
rooms, Xerox machines, telephones
— but that's happening every
where throughout the University.
It isn't unusual."
As the rally neared its close, the
comments of the students — some
of whom had not been scheduled to
speak — became more pointed,

stirring the thinning crowd that
had remained up to that time fairly
subdued. "Be aware that there's a
master plan," said junior Keri
Bolding. "They want to consolidate
(servicesl, stick all the communi
ties in one center — it's all a part of
a big plan."

"What do you look like being part

out here saying we don't want to

black men, women and children
don't have jobs ... this is what we
have to be fighting," he said.
"Multiculturalism isn't the

one culture, that's why we're

"Multiculturalism is out — when
ever Jean Fetter and Casper are
celebrating it, you know you're cel
ebrating the wrong thing."
After the speak-out, students
seemed to feel that while the
intended message of the ethnic cen
ters' value was conveyed, the issues
surrounding proposed cuts
remained murky.
"I think it was pretty effective,"
said junior Juan Iberra. "(But|

rally, said that "certainly some of
the wilder things that have been
said (like) elimination or consolida
tion seem to me quite far-fetched
— I don't know what produced

She denied that there is any
"master plan" aimed at weakening
ethnic centers. "I don't know
where that idea comes from," she
said. "I will object vigorously to
anyone's insinuation that 1 do not
understand the importance of eth
nicity or am part of any effort to
undermine this University's com
mitment to minorities, and ethnic
centers themselves."

Freshman Charles Thorn lends an ear to a speaker at yesterday's
rally protesting possible cuts in campus ethnic centers.
Five days of emergency meetings and Ilth
hour planning culminated yesterday in a rela
tively sedate speak-out at White Plaza by stu
dent minority leaders to protest possible im
pending funding cuts to the campus' ethnic
centers.
On a bright and unseasonably warm after
noon, various speakers issued dark forebod
ings that cuts to the centers could mean drastic
reductions in staffing, programming and the
disintegration of support structures for stu
dents of color.
But perhaps reflecting the general uncer
tainty that still shrouds the entire budget-cut
ting process — which aims to slash $18-20 mil
lion from the University's operating budget by

1997 — the roughly 300 spectators who at
tended the speak-out responded with strained
enthusiasm and even a bit of indifference.
Meanwhile, University administrators
raised concerns that the ethnic centers' sense
of being targeted may be premised on some
what erroneous information on how deep and
sweeping the proposed cuts will be. As such,
Provost Condoleezza Rice said she will attend a
forum tonight at Cubberley Auditorium to
douse some of the "more dramatic" claims
made by student leaders.
"I think it's fine for people to voice their
views — no one has to convince me of the im
portance of ethnic centers," she said. "|But| I
am less responsive to simply trying publicly to
make your case, rather than engaging in a
strategic planning process."
Neither Rice nor University President Ger

hard Casper, who is currently on the East
Coast, attended yesterday's demonstration.
"It is a beautiful day today, and maybe that
means beautiful things will come of it," An
drew Lisac, resident fellow at Muwekma-Tah-
Ruk, said at the rally. Lisac later surmised that
eliminating the salary of "one senior manager
or faculty member would equal the amount of
cuts to student services."
But that kind of eyebrow-raising suggestion
was not largely in evidence for the majority of
the rally, as student speakers focused more on
selling the merits of the various centers than
openly criticizing any specific University bud
get proposal.
"Ethnic centers are our homes — the people
there are our family," said junior Lisa Lee, the

first speaker. "To take them out
would be to wipe out what is inte
gral to Stanford." She added that
"we are not asking for more, we
are fighting to keep what we
have."
Lee contended that cuts could
eliminate the "human resources"
from the centers, and that the cen
ters' already modest funding
means their "long-term health is
threatened."
Sophomore Nicole Vasquez,
arguing that the centers are "alive
and vital," said that all ethnic pro
gramming "serves a purpose for
the ethnic community."
"These programs are not discre
tionary," she said. "We should
remind the University to work for
