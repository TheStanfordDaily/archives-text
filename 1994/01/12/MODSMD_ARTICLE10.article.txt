Radiation panel planned
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton will name a civilian panel of scien
tists to independently review human radi
ation test data uncovered by a govern
ment-wide search and determine whether
ethical standards were violated, adminis
tration officials said yesterday.
In all, more than 10,000 callers have
gotten through to a bank of 36 operators.
About half of them were veterans and
were referred to the Depart ment of Veter
ans Affairs.
The civilian advisory panel, expected to
be named later this month, will examine
the hundreds of thousands of documents
on reported radiation tests conducted on
humans during the Cold War. It also may
interview some of the victims and in some
cases recommend compensation, although
a final compensation scheme will have to

be approved by Congress, said Energy
Department spokesman Michael Gauldin.
Rebels may negotiate
MEXICO CITY (AP) - A presidential
troubleshooter called talks yesterday on
ending an uprising in southern Mexico.
Rebels said they would negotiate if the
military stopped bombing, withdrew its
troops and recognized their movement.
They said that otherwise they would
carry the war to Mexico City, where bomb
ings apparently linked to the uprising have
put the government on alert and residents
on edge.
The uprising by the Zapatista National
Liberation Army began New Year's Day in
Chiapas, 390 miles southeast of the capi
tal. Rebels fought to end exploitation and
oppression of Mexico's native Indians.
