Stanford faces some
important challenges
during the new year

NOW THAT the quarter's
initial rush is over, the Uni
versity has a chance to con
sider some serious New Year's res
olutions to improve life and aca
demic support for students, faculty
and staff.
The Daily encourages the Stan
ford community to append the fol
lowing resolutions to their bur
geoning To-Do lists for 1994.
• The unique innovative spirit
and morale of the Stanford com
munity will not be blunted by the
siege mentality of the budget cut
ting era. At the core, administra
tors, staff, students and faculty
will at least agree to talk openly
and candidly about the Universi
ty's problems, and agree that they
pursue a common purpose. They
will then work together to achieve
that purpose.
• The Commission on Under
graduate Education will not
become myopically focused upon
the curriculum. It has a much larg
er opportunity: to affect the funda
mental relationship between
teaching and learning at Stanford.
It should not become another ver
sion of the endlessly resurrected
committee that selects the compo
nents of the "properly educated"
person's curriculum.
• Plans for improving campus
graduate housing will receive the
same care and attention that
undergraduate housing has re
ceived. More numerous than
undergrads, graduate students
have a unacceptably slim chance of
living in desirable campus hous
ing.
• Dead Week will become truly
dead, without classes, papers or
problem sets. The Faculty Senate
will address the issue in consulta
tion with students and recommend

changes to the Dead Week policy.
• Noon concerts at Tresidder
will be reinstated. They added a
sense of atmosphere that has van
ished from all parts of campus
under budget cuts.
• Houses on the Row and Cowell
Cluster will receive a professional
spring cleaning. They have gone
too long being cleaned entirely by
students.
• Students will take advantage
of the wide variety and quality of
visiting speakers to expand their
own education.
• The University administration
will be straightforward and honest
with staff, faculty and students
about its plans for budget changes.
• Stanford will adopt a mascot
that represents Stanford students'
originality, vitality and sense of
humor.
• Operations and Maintenance
workers will find an inexpensive
way to get the hoop-shaped foun
tain in front of Green Library
working again.
• The University will not subject
students and faculty members to a
winter break of less than three
weeks.
The past break gave less than
two weeks to faculty members
from the date grades were due to
the beginning of the winter quar
ter. Students had more difficulty
than usual in getting plane tickets
for travel dates so close to Christ
mas and New Year's Day.
• Teaching, both formally or
informally, will be emphasized by
every faculty member, to the point
that each should have some con
tact with undergraduates during
the academic year.
• Funding will be finally secured
for the renovation and reopening
of the Stanford Art Museum. Hav
ing the Class of' 94 graduate with
out seeing the interior of the build
ing is a tragedy, and its remarkable
cultural resources are wasted.
• Summer storage will return.
Period.
• Stanford will win Big Game,
regain the Axe, and proceed to the
Rose Bowl.
