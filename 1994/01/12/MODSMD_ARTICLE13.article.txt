## Sleepless Stanford nights 
### 
THE INSOMNIA HAS been with
me for about two weeks. Now,
what I find to be particularly
amazing is how much there is to do, if
one really sleeps very little. You might
begin the night with a rerun or two,
read a few chapters or all of the news
paper articles your mother has sent you
during the past months. You might
memorize all the words to that awful
Rilly Joel song which packs 20th centu
ry history into three minutes or you
might wonder who created the insult of
blueberry bagels.
Late last night I was rifling through
an old magazine. It was a good thing
that I picked it up because inside was a
tremendously interesting article on
insomnia. At 3:30 a.m., with no hint of
drowsiness, nestled in a pile of
unopened mail, post-it note reminders
and newspaper clippings, I began read
ing.
Apparently, I should not feel alone,
the article says, because "an estimated
sixty million American adults — one in
every three — suffer from frequent or
chronic insomnia." Furthermore, it is
"the disease of the nineties," and "a
rude and solitary nightmare." These
latter two sentences surprised me
because, the fact is, I am actually enjoy
ing my insomnia. I don't feel lonely at
all and if I did I could pick up my phone
and, according to this article, one out of

every three of my friends will be up.
The other two I can wake up.
In big cities the amount of insomni
acs is more obviously apparent. In New
York, a city of eight million-and-some
odd people, you can look out the win
dow at four in the morning to the hun
dreds of other windows lit against the
night sky. You can lean over the ledge
to watch people passing on the street
below: an old man going to the corner
store for a pack of cigarettes, a woman
walking her pit bull. On campus it's
harder to tell, but if 1 ever forget that
my upstairs neighbors never sleep,
there is always the steady creaking (or
thunderous pounding) of the floor
boards to remind me.
Thinking about it, these hours that
fall somewhere between 12 and 5 a.m.
are the most interesting to me. I won
der what everyone else who can't fall
asleep does during these inner hours of
the night. After all, night is our last
frontier, the only place still uncharted
and mostly empty; a time to do all the
idiosyncratic things that shape one's
personality. While waiting for someone
outside of the Bookstore yesterday I
began to play a game to pass the time:
that person probably reads volumes of
Aristotle, she plays solitaire until she's
tired, he probably can't make it past
9:15, she takes night walks.
Now it's late and I'm still not tired. I

might play an old Tom Waits album
only to remember a certain poem some
one mailed me about one of his songs. I
might think about how the mail, tele
phones, faxes, cars and airplanes ensure
that we are never too far away from
someone we love. I might think about
how the world has shrunk so small,
maybe too small. I might think about
how there are not too many places you
can go where someone couldn't reach
you, which is a mixed blessing. 1 might
remember the friend who told me abdut
an agency which could track down long
lost people and if I ever went away, he
would find me. 1 might wonder why peo
ple are so drawn to motion, velocity,
travel — how the road is always a ques
tion of possibility. I might think about
how all roads eventually lead to the sea.
And before I know it it might be 4:30,
and sleep may just be beginning to
arrive in slow and gentle waves.
If you can't sleep tonight, stay up
and pass the time. Read or write or
think. Or call me. For as long as this
insomnia lasts, I'll be awake, passing
the night as well.
