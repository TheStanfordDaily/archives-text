## Native American alumnus opposes budget cuts to center 
### 
IHAVE MANY good memories of
Stanford. My best memories are of
the community support received
from the Stanford community. The
community support was the main factor
in completing college at Stanford Uni
versity.
I can recall the encouragement and
advice I received from the assistant
dean of student affairs and University
staff. Although they were assigned
part-time to assist American Indian
students attending Stanford, they
worked more than full-time to assist all
students. They shared their lives with
us at potlucks, pow wows, and other
experiences during after-work hours.
They cared about each and every one of
us. They were our "away from home
parents and advisors."
The addition of the Native American
Cultural Center during my years at
Stanford was my home away from
home. It was, and still is, a place I can
go to and feel at home and not in a city

or California. This feeling is hard to
express but it is very important in my
survival at Stanford. The proposed bud
get cuts will take away this critical
need. It may save the University a very
small amount of money but it will take
away much more.
Stanford University is built on Olone
Indian land. The entire race/tribe was
murdered upon the call of "progress."
The exploration for gold and the rail
road brought an end to these people
that took care of this land. The Ameri
can Indian program, the Native Ameri
can Cultural Center and American Indi
ans and Alaska Natives at Stanford face
a very similar situation. Before the Uni
versity begins to consider cutting criti
cal student support needs in its budget
cuts, it should consider what the items
its cuts represent. The items which are
cut from the budget reflect upon the
reputation of Stanford University.
Stanford has had a long-standing
commitment to the education of the

future leadership of this nation. Stan
ford graduates including American
Indians and Alaska Natives along with
other peoples of color have been aggres
sive in accepting a leadership role. The
investment of both time and money by
the students and the University has
been well invested. Both graduates and
the University share the success of a
highly successful venture.
Many Stanford American Indian
alumni hold high positions within their
communities as well as within American
society. Their successful careers are role
models for young people. This visible
expression encourages other American
Indians and Alaska Natives to do well in
school and apply to the undergraduate
and graduate schools at Stanford. The
circle continues and the effects prove to
be very positive. I hope this circle will
continue.
Stanford University has always
taken pride in the well-rounded educa
tional programs it offers. The reason

why many high school students chose
Stanford over other schools is because
of the student affairs support the
lifestyle of Stanford and the many
other student activities. The choice to
come to Stanford is not only based on
academics. The choice to apply to Stan
ford may be based on academics but
the choice to attend Stanford is based
on the other support systems Stanford
offers.
In conclusion, I am strongly opposed
to any reduction in staffing and any
reduction in budget resources of the
American Indian Program and the
Native American Cultural Center. In
fact, Stanford's American Indian pro
gram is a model program for other col
leges and universities to learn from. It
has proven to be cost-effective and effi
cient. Stanford University should be
proud of this successful program.
