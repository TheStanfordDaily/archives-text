## Ski machine a boon to paraplegics Students develop unique braking, turning mechanisms 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
In an age of convenience and auto
mated everything, the physically dis
abled still face disadvantages in many
activities.
But skiing is something that just got
simpler, thanks to the work of three
mechanical engineering students who
built a new and improved paraplegic ski
machine.
For Terry Tullis, John Kembel and
George Kembel, it was simply a part of
their mechanical engineering class, ME
113, which pairs students with corpo
rate or private sponsors to help them
put their classroom learning into prac
tice.
These students were paired with Ken
Hawkins, a paraplegic with a zest for
inventing vehicles to aid the disabled.
Their venture later earned them a
national award from the James F. Lin
coln Arc Welding Foundation.
From Lego to metal
Traditionally, ski machines that aid
paraplegics have been difficult to
maneuver and have required much
upper body strength.
The group started off by brainstorm
ing ways to improve on these points.
The Kembel brothers brought back Lego
blocks from home and used them as
medium for communicating their ideas.
The group then settled on a plan with
three skis on it, and constructed a life
size model of the machine using plumb
ing tubes that bend under heat, with
tennis balls as joints and rubberbands to
hold everything in place.
Even at such an early stage, they had

to take into consideration the structure
and stability of their designs. After cre
ating a satisfying design, the project
members divided the task of actually
building the machine among themselves
and made the necessary parts individu
ally.

The group began by con
stucting a life-size model
of the machine using
plumbing tubes that, with
tennis balls as joints and
rubberbands to hold
everything in place.

One of the machine's distinct advan
tages for paraplegics is its braking and
turning system, which is controlled at
the poles and wired to the back of the
outer skis. By pulling the brakes, stakes
at the back of the machine dig into the
snow and slow the skier down.
This in turn connects to the
machine's steering system. By pulling
one break, the vehicle pivots around the
stake of that brake and subsequently
turns toward the side of the brake that
is being used.
The students also made interface a
crucial concern. They often had to build
a part first and test if their sponsor
could use it comfortably, and if not,
start all over again.
"If we only did the math and calcula
tions, we wouldn't get the feel for the

real thing. You have to see what space it
takes and what has to change," said
senior George Kembel.
For example, they had hoped initially
to use a steering wheel to control the
machine's turns, but the movement of
twisting the torso to turn the wheel
appeared to be too difficult for some
paraplegics.
Instead, the group incorporated poles
that moved back and forth and only
needed the use of biceps. The poles were
connected to a unique linkage system
that rotated the seat for the skier as the
machine turned and also put the skis on
their edges at the turn, which made the
turn itself more smoothly.
The students avoided this problem by
allowing the underside of the ski
machine's seat to fit neatly onto the lift.
The telescoping arms that hold the
outer skis collapse inward as the skier
pulls the machine's seat upward to let
the chair lift slide under it. This is all
done through wires that connect the
arms to the chair.
Putting it to the test
The students had to construct every
part of the machine from metal scraps
or reconstruct parts from hardware
stores.
"There were more than 100 parts. We
had to draw, cut, drill, sand, weld, put
nuts and bolts on, sandblast and paint
each part," said Tullis, a co-terminal
student in biomechanical engineering.
As the project's deadline approached,
the group easily spent 90 man-hours a
week piecing the vehicle together.
Of course, the machine was not a fin-

ished product without a test run.
The group experimented at
Alpine Meadows in the Lake
Tahoe area, where a ski school
providing aid to the disabled
helped evaluate the vehicle's
movements.

After extensive test runs and
structural tests, the ski machine
was ready to go national and won
the Lincoln Foundation's presti
gious award for the science and
application of arc welding, along
with a check for $2,000.
In addition, the group also won
the Henry O. Fuchs award at
Stanford, given to graduating
mechanical engineers for excel
lence in their senior projects.
