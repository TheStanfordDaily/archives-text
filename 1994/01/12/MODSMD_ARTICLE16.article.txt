# Earth-like geology formed Martian surface
## Cooling of red planet credited to tectonics

What does a lifeless red planet have
in common with the thriving green and
blue planet we call home?
A lot. New evidence shows that the
visages of both planets may have been
created by similar forces. The deep
canyons and enormous volcanoes that
jut out of Mars' motionless surface may
have been created by similar processes
that long ago created the Sierra Neva
da mountain range and other physical
features on Earth, according to Geo
physics Prof. Norman Sleep.
These forces are more commonly
referred to as plate tectonics, part of a
theory that envisions Earth's surface
as giant puzzle pieces, or plates, that
interact with each other to form sur
face features such as mountain ranges,
volcanoes and abysses. This is caused
bv the movement of molten magma
underneath the Earth's crust.
Sleep proposes that although one
plate now covers Mars, the planet's
canyons and volcanoes grew from past
movements of two active geological
plates.
Alternative theories hold that Mars'
enormous valleys and surface features
were created from the planet's expan
sion and contraction rather than from
plate movements. According to these
theories, the planet became cold, then
heated and expanded, and subsequent
ly cooled and contracted again.
However, meteorites ejected from
Mars that occasionally fall to Earth pro
vide evidence that Mars was molten at
the time of its original formation.
Concentrations of lead 207 in the
Martian meteorites indicate that Mars'
core formed early in the life of the solar
system, suggesting that the planet was
once hot enough for a molten core to

form. The liquid, viscous interior would
have allowed plates to move and shape
Mars' surface.
Sleep's theory consists of two parts.
"I've put together a plausible recon
struction of the plate tectonics as some
thing that can be tested against data
and modified," he said, "and I've also
figured out the physics of how plate tec
tonics will scale differently on the grav
ity of Mars."
Gravity on Mars is two-fifths of
Earth's gravity, so the calculations for
Mars' plate tectonics must be scaled
accordingly.

In his theory, Sleep explains Martian
surface features like the northern low
lands, colossal volcanoes such as Olym
pus Mons and Alba Patera, as well as
the lack of surface water on Mars.
The northern lowland, a smooth
region that stretches 5,000 miles
across, covers one-third of the planet.
The elevation difference between Mar
tian lowlands and highlands compares
to the elevation differences between the
continents and ocean floor on Earth.
The lowlands' smooth surface
resulted from the thickness of the sea
floor crust, which is 2.5 times thicker

than Earth's crust at the same temper
ature, and the rapid rate at which the
sea floor spread.
A moderately fast spreading rate of
80 millimeters per year, the lower limit
of the maximum rate, would be neces
sary to cause the observed smoothness
of the lowlands.
Similarly, on Earth, rapid spreading
of the sea floor causes the smoothness
of the east Pacific Ocean rise compared
to the rough topography of the Atlantic
Ocean floor.
