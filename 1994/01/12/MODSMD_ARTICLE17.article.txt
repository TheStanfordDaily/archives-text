# Ulcer ultimatum: Stress-free life no panacea for ulcer
## 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
Q: I've heard that ulcers are caused by stress,
and that ulcers are caused by diet, and that
ulcers are caused by germs, and a dozen other
things. Which is it?
— Hurtin' for certain

A: Well, the
jury's not yet
in on the subject,
hut it's pretty clear
that some rethink
ing will has to be
done on the con
ventional picture of
the ulcer as a strict
ly lifestyle-induced
malady.
For those few
among you who

aren't gastroenterologists, allow me to briefly
describe an ulcer: If the protective mucous lining
of your stomach ever develops a small hole, expos
ing the stomach wall to the ravages of your diges
tive juices, then you have an ulcer. Painful,
painful, painful. Any questions.
Traditionally, ulcers have been viewed as prod
ucts of an unusually stressful lifestyle, perhaps cou
pled with excessive consumption of drugs (ranging
from alcohol to caffeine to nicotine to aspirin) or
foods (from the very spicy to the very fatty) which
are especially bad for the stomach lining.
Recent studies, however, suggest that other
factors — less controllable bv the individual in
question than stress levels or diet — may be
equally strong causes of ulcers.
In particular, a nasty little bacterium called
Helicobacter pylori has been implicated in both
acute (i.e., short-term) and chronic (you guessed
it — long-term) ulcer pain.
Although these peskv germs do not cause
every type of ulcer, they do appear to be responsi
ble for a great many types of mild and severe
ulcers. (In particular, those referred to by medical
literature as "perforated" — ouch — are at best
weakly associated with Helicobacter infection.)
Bacterially induced ulcers do not appear to be
strongly correlated with stress. This has two corol
laries, one of which is better news than the other.
Since Helicobacter appears able to initiate
ulcers and cause their recurrence without assis
tance from whatever bad habits its host might
have, ulcers can be attacked pretty successfully
via an attack on the bacteria themselves.
In many cases, recent studies have found, a
healthy cocktail of antibiotics (chemicals which kill
bacteria while leaving mammalian cells mostly
unharmed) administered along with bismuth (a
key ingredient of the familiar Pepto-Bismol 1 * home
stomach remedy) is just as successful as expensive
prescription medications at airing ulcers.
The bad news is more subtle: If bacterial infec
tion can cause ulcers, then even the most stress
fret 1 , smoke-free, beer-free lifestyle will not com
pletely eliminate one's risk of getting ulcers.
These other factors can certainly compound this
risk, but even the Muesli-eating Leo
BuscagliaDeep Breakfast fans out there might
someday find themselves with a nasty set of nee
dles in their sides.
