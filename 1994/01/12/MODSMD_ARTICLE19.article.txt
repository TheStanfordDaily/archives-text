Swarthmore pays student to leave
PHILADELPHIA (AP) - A Swarthmore Col
lege freshman was accused of harassing a student
who resisted his romantic overtures. Now the
school is paying him to go away.
Swarthmore agreed to pay Ewart Yearwood's
tuition, transportation and book costs wherever
he decides to enroll for the spring semester.
Yearwood, 18; said he planned to register at
Columbia University in New York City, where he
lives, but Columbia spokesman"Fred Knubel said
yesterday there was no record of Yearwood having
yet applied.
His departure came after another freshman,
Alexis Clinansmith, complained that he harassed
her last semester. She accused him of stalking her
at the fall formal dance, phoning her at night, and
making lewd comments and remarks such as "I'm
going to have her."
Alfred H. Bloom, president of the exclusive lib
eral arts college in the Philadelphia suburb of
Swarthmore, said Yearwood did not sexually
harass Clinansmith, but did engage in a "pattern
of intimidation."
"The resolution of this case makes clear that
intimidation is not to be tolerated at Swarthmore
College and, consistent with the college's confi
dence in the power of education, provides the
means for (Yearwood) to learn to better manage
his own behavior," Bloom said in a statement

Friday.
Swarthmore said it will consider taking Year
wood back next term if he undergoes counseling
— at the school's expense.
Columbia, like Swarthmore, costs more than
$20,000 a year in tuition, room and board.
Yearwood, who was on a partial academic
scholarship at Swarthmore, said he accepted the
deal to avoid being suspended.
"If you truly think I did something wrong, kick
me out," he said. "I think the president of the col
lege . . . sees something is wrong here, either the
penalty, the process or the procedure. I made clear
that if I was suspended I would sue."
Yearwood denied harassing his classmate and
said she misinterpreted his actions. He said that
he shaved his head last semester, revealing sever
al scars, and that he "looks mean" when he's not
smiling.
"I do not think I have a problem," Yearwood
said. "They feel that I probably inadvertently,
subconsciously, release intimidating vibes and
that I need counseling to better understand
what it is in my behavior that makes people feel
that way and how to be perceived as less intimi
dating."
Clinansmith, who lives in Blooomfield Hills,
Mich., is away during the school's winter break
and could not be reached for comment. Her
lawyer, Carolyn P. Short, did not return calls to
her office yesterday.
