# ASSU votes to keep fee refunds simple
## Once-a-year request process stays 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate voted over
whelmingly last night not to
change the special-fee refund sys
tem.
The defeated bill, proposed by
undergraduate senator Gabe
Lucas, would have required stu
dents to request fee refunds each
quarter rather than once for the
entire year under the current poli
cy-
Responding to arguments that
the hill was created to increase
funding to student groups by ex
ploiting students' ignorance of the
process, Lucas said, "1 think the
disturbance to the individual as
well as the boost to the student
groups are overrated."
With drastic refund-rate in
creases fueled by last quarter's
graduate student refund drive,
student groups have lost as much
as 14 percent of their budgeted
funds.
But Lucas said his bill was not
prompted solely by the refund
rates. " I see this bill as a policy de

cision," he said. "Hopefully, under
this proposal, people will think
more and realize the damages of
refunds to the student groups."
Hut graduate senator Sanford
Dickert supported the present sys
tem. "If a group wants to improve
relations, we now have a method
for gauging student opinion," he
said, referring to students' right
to rescind their initially selected
refunds in subsequent quarters.
"This hill is putting the onus on
the student rather than the stu
dent group," he said, adding that
groups should make more at
tempts to reach out to students if
they want their funding returned.
However, both Lucas and un
dergraduate senator Grace Casas-
Silva argued that students would
not necessarily reconsider refunds
throughout the year unless forced
to do so.
"I think that if a student takes
a refund, it is his responsibility to
think about that every quarter,"
said Casas-Silva. "Under this bill,
the group might go out and try to
change opinions because the pro
cess would occur every quarter."
"You're neglecting the laziness
factor," Lucas added.
But the bill was ultimately
defeated after graduate senator
Neil Crellin read a letter from a
graduate student expressing what
he described as "a very common
sentiment among (graduate stu
dents]." The letter described
Lucas' bill as an unabashed
attempt to take money from stu

dents' pockets.
Crellin said the proposed mea
sure would simply fuel student
opposition to the fee-refund sys
tem.
Undergraduate senator Rober
to Milk agreed, saying that "the
more burdens we put on the stu
dent body, the worse the senti
ment is going to be."
In addition to considering the
fee-refund bill, senators approved
the ASSU Committee on Commit
tees' appointments to Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education
subcommittees.
The committee appointed
sophomore Smeeta Ramarthnam

and junior Ali Rowghani to the
academic calendar subcommittee,
senior Diana Cardenas and
sophomore Chloe Sladden to the
academic environment subcom
mittee, sophomore Laura
Goodrich and senior Greg
Gilchrist to the breadth require
ments subcommittee, senior Josh
Kallmer to the language require
ment subcommittee and seniors
John Levin and Shayne Spalten
to the majors subcommittee.
All 44 students who applied for
the nine positions were under
graduates. The committee inter
viewed 14 applicants after review
ing all the candidates' resumes.
