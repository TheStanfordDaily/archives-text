# ASSU votes to keep fee refunds simple
## Once-a-year request process stays

The ASSU Senate voted over
whelmingly last night not to
change the special-fee refund sys
tem.
The defeated bill, proposed by
undergraduate senator Gabe
Lucas, would have required stu
dents to request fee refunds each
quarter rather than once for the
entire year under the current poli

Responding to arguments that
the hill was created to increase
funding to student groups by ex

this proposal, people will think
more and realize the damages of
refunds to the student groups."
Hut graduate senator Sanford
Dickert supported the present sys
tem. "If a group wants to improve
relations, we now have a method
for gauging student opinion," he
said, referring to students' right
to rescind their initially selected
refunds in subsequent quarters.
"This hill is putting the onus on
the student rather than the stu

groups should make more at
tempts to reach out to students if
they want their funding returned.
However, both Lucas and un
dergraduate senator Grace Casas-
Silva argued that students would
not necessarily reconsider refunds
throughout the year unless forced
to do so.
"I think that if a student takes
a refund, it is his responsibility to
think about that every quarter,"
said Casas-Silva. "Under this bill,
the group might go out and try to
