# Ex-Stanford physicist testifies to radiation standard violations

LAS VEGAS (AP) - A former Stanford health
physics expert said officials at a Nevada nuclear test
site routinely violated accepted health safety prac
tices during the 1950s and 19605.
Dr. Roland Finston, who retired in August, testi
fied that Nevada Test Site personnel advocated con
sumption of beer to dilute tritium after workers had
been exposed to it. He also testified that one super
visor had recommended drastically raising maxi
mum exposure levels to expedite test site work.
Finston's testimony came in a trial involving
families of former test site workers who are suing
the government for alleged safety violations at the
site.
The families allege that lax standards led to radi
ation exposure, resulting in cancer-related deaths.
Finston told U.S. District Judge Philip Pro that
there were continuous violations in health and safe
ty standards set in 1954 by the Council on Radiation
Protection.
Finston said the government also violated Atom
ic Energy Commission standards that stated work

ers could not be exposed to more than three rems
per quarter or five rems annually. A rem is a mea
surement of radiation.
Test site worker Eugene Haynes, who developed
lung cancer and died in 1985, was subjected to 39
rems during a single exposure in 1955.
The incident occurred because radiation safety
personnel failed to provide roadblocks to prevent
people from entering the heavily contaminated area
following an above-ground blast, Finston said.
"In effect, a great deal of over-exposure accrued
without authorization by the AEC in Washington,"
Finston said.
Finston also read from a report in which an
unnamed worker drank 30 cans of beer over a peri
od of a few days in an effort to wash out potential tri
tium contamination. Tritium is a radioactive form of
hydrogen.
Finston said that the beer was thought to be a
diuretic and that the existence of the report "leads
me to believe there was an endorsement of this by
safety officials."
