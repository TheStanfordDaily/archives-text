## Stanford swimmers travel to Ann Arbor 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
After spending some of its winter vaca
tion time competing in sunny Southern
California, the Michigan men's swim team
returned to the frigidity of home.
And when the top-ranked Stanford
swim team rolls into Ann Arbor this week
end, they won't get a warm Wolverine wel
come. After splitting holiday dual meets by
beating UCLA and falling to USC, No. 2
Michigan will be defending its home turf
against an extremely deep and talented
Cardinal squad.
At home, the Wolverines have been vir
tually unbeatable in the past decade. Their
only loss in Ann Arbor over that span came
at the hands of the 1992 Stanford squad,
which went on to win NCAA Champi
onship.
Although winning the meet is a top pri
ority for coach Skip Kenney and his ath
letes, Kenney will use this competition to
gauge the mid-season progress of both his
veterans and newcomers.
"We want to see how well our Christ
mas training has gone," Kenney said. "We
haven't raced in a while, so it will be excit
ing. You can find out exactly where you
are. For the younger swimmers, we want
to see how well they travel to a major com
petition."
Senior co-captain Trip Zedlitz is ready
to compete after the long winter training
period. "We put in a good solid six weeks
without racing," he said. "It will be good to
finally race again. This is the first part of
the second half of our season. It's the rac
ing stage, when we'll start to specialize. We

will get to see where we are and adjust
between now and Pac-lOs and NCAAs."
One of the Wolverines' top guns is
sprinter Gustavo Borges. Borges, a Brazil
ian national, was a medalist in the 100-
meter freestyle at the Olympic Games in
Barcelona and is the defending NCAA
champion in the 100-yard free.
Stanford sprint freestylers Bill Schell,
Brian Retterer and Joe Hudepohl will be
looking to race well and beat Borges to the
wall.
"We have the best sprinting group in
the country," Schell said. "In the 50 and
the 100, no one has our depth and quality.
All the sprinters will be gunning for Gusta
vo to knock him down."
Michigan's strength in the freestyle
events is not limited to sprinting, as Ken
ney expects the Wolverines to be strong in
the longer distances as well. He also real
izes the difficulty of coming out of Ann
Arbor victorious.
"They put more emphasis on home
meets," he said. "This will be fun."
"It was really exciting to give them their
first home loss in 10 years," Zedlitz added.
"There are a lot of fans rooting against
you."
Winning on the road is something the
Cardinal will have to do to win a third con
secutive national title at the NCAA Cham
pionships in Minnesota.
"This team likes to think it could be the
best ever," Kenney said. "Part of being the
best ever is handling road trips like this.
This team is trying to be a part of history."
It will no doubt be cold this weekend in
Ann Arbor, but the Cardinal intends to
turn up the heat on the Wolverines.
