The clashing of steel on steel will fill the
University of San Francisco campus this week
end as fencers from all over the world cross
swords in the North American Cup tourna
ment. Several Stanford fencers will compete in
the field of over 1,200 from countries such as
Germany, Cuba, the Philippines, Mexico,
Canada, Czechoslovakia and Azerbaijan.
"This tournament is going to be Interna
tional A-class. We have Olympic champions
and World Champions; it will be one of the
strongest competitions ever organized in the
United States," said Stanford men's fencing
coach Zoran Tulum.
The United States Fencing Association
(USFA) sponsors the tournament, which is
used to help select the members of the U.S.
National Team. It is not a collegiate meet
and team scores are not kept. The competi
tion is divided into Senior (open to all ages)
and Junior (age 20 and under) divisions, and
into three weapon classes â€” foil, epee and
saber.
Four Cardinal women will compete:

junior captain Anna Cummins and sopho
mores Chloe Sladden, Stephanie Wien and
Morgan Hoch.
All four will fence in the Senior Foil divi
sion on Friday. Hoch and Wien will fence in
the Senior Fpee division on Saturday. Wien
will fence Junior Epee on Sunday and will
fence again on Monday in Junior Foil along
with Sladden.
"It's a great opportunity for us to have
that kind of competition available," said
Stanford women's fencing coach Sherry
Posthumus. Among the women, Wien and
Hoch have a good chance of doing well,
according to Posthumus.
This is the first time that Wien will face
international competition and she is looking
forward to the challenge.
"It's a good experience just to compete
against these people," she said. "They usual
ly don't come over to the U.S. because the
competition in Europe is so good."
Among current members of the Stanford
men's team, only sophomore Shil Sengupta
