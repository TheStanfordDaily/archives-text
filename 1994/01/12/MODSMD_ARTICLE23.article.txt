# 'Satisfied with career,' Sanders formally quits
## 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
Senior Summer Sanders announced her retire
ment from professional swimming yesterday at a
press conference at DeGuerre pool. Sanders said the
love she felt for the sport has started to fade, indicat
ing to her a need for change.
"My career hasn't been the same since the
Olympics," Sanders said. "I had problems coming
back after the Olympics — swimming was just differ
ent for me."
After reaching what almost any athlete would
consider the pinnacle of a career — winning four
medals in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics — Sanders
found her love of and dedication to swimming was no
longer as strong as it had been before the Olympics.
While she continued training after her perfor
mance in Barcelona, some of the spark which had
motivated her toward her Olympic goals started to
fade.
"After the Olympics I started training again but it
just wasn't as enjoyable as in the past," Sanders said.
"In a sport like swimming, it's not just a 'like* feeling,
you really have to love it. I knew it just wasn't there."
Sanders competed on the Stanford squad for two
years, in which time she captured six the NCAA
championships, including and helped her team win
the 1992 team title. After propelling the Cardinal to
the national championship, Sanders gave up colle
giate competition and quickly established herself as a
professional contender in the Olympics.
"I had been on top once and knew the feelings you

have to have," Sanders said. "I start
ed thinking about why I was swim
ming and became happy because I
realized I was satisfied with my
career."
After giving up her eligibility,
Sanders came to find that training,
and the entire sport of swimming,
was different on the individual level
— and much more lonely.
"I knew it was going to be a dif
ferent type of swimming but I came
to realize how much I missed the
team aspect," Sanders said. "The
strong relationships that I made as
part of a team made everything so
much more fun."

Stanford coach Richard Quick
cited Sanders' outgoing, team-ori
ented personality as strongly suited
to collegiate competition but that
individual training was much more
of a challenge for her.
"My fondest memory of Summer
was the excitement that she felt when
our team won the NCAA champi
onships her sophomore year," Quick
said. "Certainly her individual success
helped us win but her feeling for the
team winning and what that meant to
her is something that I'll remember
my whole life."
Practicing on her own, mostly
between personal appearances on
the road, Sanders no longer felt the
competitive drive or the intense
motivation which characterized her
pre-Olympic training.
"One of my strengths has always

been my attitude," Sanders said. "It
just started to become so much more
of a chore. I didn't have those same
goals to go out there and be the best
— I think this is completely normal,
though."
Sanders considers her decision a
natural progression even though she
finds the idea of retirement as a col
lege senior a bit odd. "There comes a
time for everyone," Sanders said. "I
didn't expect to be retiring at 21
though. It seems kind of funny."
While she will not keep the hectic
five-hour-a-dav training schedule
which professional swimming
requires, Sanders plans to stay con
nected with the sport through her
endorsements and her ties with the
Stanford team.

the excitement of sports in hope of
motivating them to get involved in
physical activity. Sanders will also
continue her work with Speedo and
Power Bar and will take a stab at
commentating during the women's
NCAA swimming championships
this spring.
Although Sanders may be retir
ing from a sport to which she devot
ed the majority of her childhood and
college years, the piirting is not a
time of sadness for her but rather of
optimism about what lies ahead.
"The decision has been so positive
for me," Sanders said. "It was never
a negative feeling. 'Congratulations'
Is the best thing that people could say
to me."
