## Gymnastics aiming for NCAAs 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
Utah in the spring? That's what the
women's gymnastics team is setting its
sights on — for in that month the NCAA
Championships will be held in Salt Lake
City. And, with consistent performances
throughout the season, head coach Breck
Greenwood is confident the team will
qualify for NCAAs for the second time in
three years.
"We have the talent to do it (attend
NCAAs)," Greenwood said.
The top 12 college teams in the nation
compete in the NCAA Championships:
the winner of each of the country's five
regions and the nation's seven other top
scoring squads. Stanford's region
includes such top schools as UCLA and
Oregon State, respectively ranked fifth
and seventh in the country last year. Last
season Stanford came in third in region
als and 15th in the nation, falling just
short of a trip to NCAAs. The Cardinal is
currently seeded 1 fith according to pre
season polls, and will receive their first
test of the season this Friday in Burnham
Pavilion against UCLA.
The team features two Regional
Champions on uneven hars, sophomore
Hillary Anderson and junior Jene Elzie,
as well as the nation's top recruit last
year, freshman Katie Jennings. Three
Cardinal gymnasts — Anderson, -Jen
nings and junior Tina Snowden — are
also U.S. National Team Members.
Elzie and Meegan Lannin, also a
junior, will lead the team on the vault.
Lannin has been learning a new vault,
the layout Tsukahara full, arguably the
toughest woman's vault in the world.
Anderson, Snowden. junior Jenny Ward
and freshman Ariel Passanisi will also
vault.
This vault roster may shift, however,
once Jennings and sophomore Linda
Chun perfect their respective new vaults.
The team is extremely strong on bars
but lacks depth. Six squad members may
compete on each event, with five scores
counting; yet, while the other events
have a surplus of eligible participants,
there will only be five gymnasts com pet

ing on the bars at the first meet.
According to Greenwood, Anderson
has great form and technique on bars and
could make national event finals again,
Chun performs a unique bar routine that
is loaded with scoring bonuses and Lan
nin, who has natural strength and

endurance, has worked hard to inject
additional difficult moves into her bar
routine. Elzie, Jennings and eventually
senior and co-captain Mollie Brown will
be competing on bars, as well.

Tina Snowden strikes a pose. Snowden, a U.S. National Team member, will per
form with the rest of her Stanford teammates this Friday against UCLA.
Yhe gymnasts are aiming for
consistency on the beam this year,
an attainable goal with such sea
soned participants as Elzie (who in
two years has only fallen off the
beam once), Anderson, Brown and
Snowden. Jennings and Passanisi
will be new faces on the beam.
"Katie is a great athlete: super
talented, strong and enduring,"

Greenwood said. "College is a lot
different from the clubs she is used
to, but she has really impressed the
team and is living up to her title as
top recruit."
Passanisi will also have an
immediate impact on the team.
"Ariel was a great surprise. She will
be competing on two events, which
is great for a walk-on freshman,"
Greenwood said. "She has tremen
dous power."
The floor could perhaps be the
strongest event for the team this
year. Elzie and Snowden, the team's

top floor performers, both execute
crowd-pleasing routines that effec
tively combine dance with tum
bling. Jennings, Anderson
and Chun are strong tumblers who
will be competing floor as well.
Senior West will not be
competing until February due to a
bone chip in the front of her ankle.
She competes on the vault, bars and
floor.
Though the team suffered no
attrition through graduation last
year, the team lost junior Katie
Clancy for the season because of a

torn anterior cruscuit ligament. But
she remains a co-captain and is
undergoing intensive rehabilitation
so she am compete next year.
The Cardinal's quest toward Salt
Lake City will begin with this Fri
day's contest, which will begin at
7:30 p.m.
"UCLA has great tradition of
being a good team. It would be nice
if we have a great night and they
stumble a bit, but we tire going to
perform for the crowd and just aim
to get high scores for our ranking,"
Greenwood said.
