## Gymnastics aiming for NCAAs 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
Utah in the spring? That's what the
women's gymnastics team is setting its
sights on — for in that month the NCAA
Championships will be held in Salt Lake
City. And, with consistent performances
throughout the season, head coach Breck
Greenwood is confident the team will
qualify for NCAAs for the second time in
three years.
"We have the talent to do it (attend
NCAAs)," Greenwood said.
The top 12 college teams in the nation
compete in the NCAA Championships:
the winner of each of the country's five
regions and the nation's seven other top
scoring squads. Stanford's region
includes such top schools as UCLA and
Oregon State, respectively ranked fifth
and seventh in the country last year. Last
season Stanford came in third in region
als and 15th in the nation, falling just
short of a trip to NCAAs. The Cardinal is
currently seeded 1 fith according to pre
season polls, and will receive their first
test of the season this Friday in Burnham
Pavilion against UCLA.
The team features two Regional
Champions on uneven hars, sophomore
Hillary Anderson and junior Jene Elzie,
as well as the nation's top recruit last
year, freshman Katie Jennings. Three
Cardinal gymnasts — Anderson, -Jen
nings and junior Tina Snowden — are
also U.S. National Team Members.
Elzie and Meegan Lannin, also a
junior, will lead the team on the vault.
Lannin has been learning a new vault,
the layout Tsukahara full, arguably the
toughest woman's vault in the world.
Anderson, Snowden. junior Jenny Ward
and freshman Ariel Passanisi will also
vault.
This vault roster may shift, however,
once Jennings and sophomore Linda
Chun perfect their respective new vaults.
The team is extremely strong on bars
but lacks depth. Six squad members may
compete on each event, with five scores
counting; yet, while the other events
have a surplus of eligible participants,
there will only be five gymnasts com pet

ing on the bars at the first meet.
According to Greenwood, Anderson
has great form and technique on bars and
could make national event finals again,
Chun performs a unique bar routine that
is loaded with scoring bonuses and Lan
nin, who has natural strength and

endurance, has worked hard to inject
additional difficult moves into her bar
routine. Elzie, Jennings and eventually
senior and co-captain Mollie Brown will
be competing on bars, as well.
