# Riders place, show
## Rugby does not fare as well

Equestrian
The Cardinal equestrian
team galloped into UC-Davis
last weekend and rode off into
the sunset with a third-place fin
ish in the English division on
Saturday and a second-place fin
ish in the Western division on
Sunday
The Davis Intercollegiate
Horse Show Association (IHSA)
horse show featured teams from
UC-Davis, USC, Fresno State,
Cal Poly- Pomona, Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo and UC-San Diego.
On Saturday the team faced
horrendous weather conditions,

but still rode well. Sophomore
Christina Russell garnered sec
ond in Novice Equitation Over
Fences. Russell's performance
was quite impressive, consider
ing she placed second in the
largest field of the year in Stan
ford's division.
Junior Perlman also
contributed to the team's third -
place finish on Saturday. Perl
man took second place in Inter
mediate Equitation Over
Fences.
Sunday saw a better perfor
mance from Stanford as the
team took honors in four divi
sions en route to its Western
division second-place finish. Perl
man once again turned in an
impressive performance, with
another second-place finish in
Intermediate Equitation Over
Fences.
Junior Geneva Gano was quite
busy on Sunday, as well, as she
earned the Cardinal's remaining
awards. Gano placed third in Open
Equitation Over Fences, Open
Reigning and Open Stock Seat
Equitation.
The Cardinal's next competi
tion will be Jan. 23 at the Stanford

Red Barn. The horse show will be
Stanford's home opener.
Women's Rugby
The women's rugby team did
not enjoy as much success as the
equestrian team this past week
end, as the ruggers dropped a
heart-breaker to CHAOS, 44-0.
CHAOS, a select women's club
team from Palo Alto, dominated
every aspect of the contest.
The team takes on other select
women's teams throughout the
next few months before entering
the collegiate tournament in
spring. The good news for the
squad is that the club teams they
have been playing are in a different
class from other collegiate teams.
