## Pac-10 Indoors should test men's tennis 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
The Stanford men's tennis team is poised
to start their season, one which could end with
the recapturing of the NCAA title. And for
head coach Dick Gould, the squad's perfor
mance at this weekend's Pacific 10 Confer
ence Indoor Championships should be an
excellent indicator of its potential
" This is a team — and I'm very sincere
when I say this — that is capable of winning
the national championship," said Stanford
men's tennis head coach Dick Gould. "But it's
going to be very close."
With nine teams at the Pac-10 Indoors
Oregon State does not field a squad — this
weekend should do much to give Gould more
of an idea where the Cardinal stands. The
tournament is played with four flights, each
with its own singles and doubles draw
The first flight will feature Michael Flana
gan, the tournament's defending singles

champion, and Robert Devens in singles, and a
tandem of Flanagan and Chris Cocotos in dou
bles. The second flight will see Jeff Salzen
stein and Cocotos in singles with Sal/enstein-
Devens in doubles.
Senior V imal Patel and sophomore Kicky
Becker will be Stanford's representatives in
the third-flight singles, while Patel will team
up with freshman Grant Elliott in doubles.
The fourth (light will see Elliott and senior
Hilly Wright in singles, and Becker-Wright in
doubles.
Sophomore Jim Thomas, whose rotator
cufTproblems kept him from traveling to Palm
Springs for the National Collegiate Tennis
Classic, would have played in the second flight
of the tournament, but will remain at home as
he tries to heal for the season.
"It'll be a good tournament," Gould said.
It will help us get into playing shape, and into
a competitive frame of mind."
Stanford showed itself to l»e in pretty good
shape already bv postinp an impressive week

end at the Classic. Stanford was one of eight
teams at the three-day tournament in Palm
Springs, each of which sent four players. The
Classic's level of play was excellent, according
to Gould, as all the squads were among the
best in the country.
"Except for Duke and Georgia, all the top
teams were there," Gould said.
In singles, Stanford sent Devens, Cocotos
Salzenstein and Flanagan, the No. 2 seed in
the singles draw Devens and Salzenstein
teamed up for doubles, as did Flanagan and
Cocotos.
Although Southern California's Wayne
Black was not present, the singles draw was
very competitive. Texas' All-American Chad
Clark, the No 1 seed in singles, beat Flanagan
in the finals 6-4, 6-2 to take the tournament
title However. Clark's performance against
Stanford shouldn't have come as a surprise as
he had been eliminating Cardinal players from
