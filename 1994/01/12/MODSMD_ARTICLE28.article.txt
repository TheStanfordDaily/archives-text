# SLAC staff celebrates job security
## Without project, 300 workers could have been laid off 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Three years ago, Robin Erbacherwas
faced with a tough decision. After com
pleting her undergraduate work in
physics at UC-San Diego, she was
unsure whether to attend Stanford or
Cornell for her doctoral work in physics.
"Everyone told me not to go to Stan
ford because SLAC had no future and
may be shutting down," Erbacher said.
Despite hearing these warnings, she
chose Stanford and is currently a third
year doctoral student.
Erbacher celebrated her decision to
attend Stanford yesterday at the B-fac
tory inauguration at the Stanford Lin
ear Accelerator Center. She said she
proved everyone wrong because Stan
ford beat out Cornell for the B-factory
contract.
"For two years as an undergraduate
I studied the detector design for the B
factory," she said. She is currently

'The project will allow us
to maintain and reutilize
our staff. It will keep us
viable for another
decade.'

doing experiments at SLAC.
The mood was festive at yesterday's
inauguration, as SLAC workers cele
brated the security of their future
employment.
"Now I know I'll have a job for a lit
tle time longer," said Fred Clay of the
maintenance department.
Many employees had been concerned
about losing their jobs, but their fears
were alleviated when SLAC was award
ed the B-factory contract in October.

It was thought that up to 300 work
ers could have been laid off if the con
tract was given to another laboratory.
Director of Personnel Lee Lyon said
the project will "allow us to maintain
and reutilize our staff. It will keep us
viable for another decade."
Barbara Johnson, assistant to Lyon,
said that getting the contract "prevents
us from doing any kind of layoffs."
The B-factory project is "something
that California really needed right now.
People are getting laid off throughout
California in technology. People really
need the jobs right now," said Jesse Sal
divar, a worker in SLAC's heating, ven
tilation and air conditioning unit.
"Everyone's happy now that we've
got the ball rolling and we're back in
business," he said.
In addition, the politicians' speeches
at the ceremony were "a great boost for
morale," said A 1 Ashley, a SLAC senior
employee relations representative. "It
motivates everyone to work harder."
