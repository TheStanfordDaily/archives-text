# What SLAC's B factory will do
## $177M project to help find out how universe began 
### 
The Stanford Linear Accelerator's asymmetric
B factory may help scientists find out how the uni
verse began.
A fraction of a second after the Big Bang, mat
ter and antimatter existed in equal quantities.
All things being equal, every particle of matter
should have collided with a corresponding antipar
ticle — protons with antiprotons, electrons with
positrons.
Since matter and antimatter destroy each other
in collisions, the bulk of material in the universe
should have simply annihilated itself.
But all things were not equal. A stable, mat
ter-dominated universe evolved from the cosmic
fire of the Big Bang. Roughly 10 billion years
later, certain issues still have physicists con
fused.
Scientists hope that the B factory, scheduled for
completion in 1998, will help clear up this confu
sion.
In a particle collider, beams of charged parti
cles — in this case, electrons and their antiparti
cles, positrons — are accelerated to high veloci
ties.
Where the two beams intersect, high-energy
collisions take place, and cascades of new particles
are formed from the energy released.
The B factory will consist of a new beam-stor

age ring, to be built in the circular tunnel which
currently houses SLAC's Positron Electron Pro
ject storage ring. Also planned is a new detector,
which will be required to observe the rapid, high
energy collisions.
When the B factory is in operation, positrons
will circulate in the new ring while electrons cir
culate at even higher energies in the older ring. At
intersection of the beams, electrons and positrons
will collide to form particles knows as "B
mesons."
B mesons are extremely short-lived, decaying
rapidly into more stable particles. Physicists will
make measurements of the B mesons' decays, and
compare the data they collect against predictions
made by competing theories about why the uni
verse evolved the way it did.
However, only a small fraction of B meson
decays will provide data relevant to issues of such
cosmic significance, requiring physicists to
observe large numbers of such decays.
Currently, no collider exists that is able to pro
duce the required number of B particles.
The SLAC B factory will fill this need and allow
physicists to test theories that hope to explain how
the universe — and everything else since then —
began.
