## Columnist Anthony Lewis talks about hate-speech codes, Bosnia 
### Josh Green Staff writer 
Weathering a shelling of criti
cism and questions on his views
about Bosnia, New York Times
columnist Anthony Lewis deliv
ered the John S. Knight Lecture
last night in Kresge Auditorium to
a packed, and sometimes hostile,
crowd.
After Lewis' speech, "Thoughts
That We Hate," many in the audi
ence made it clear that they hated
his thoughts on the situation in
Bosnia. Lewis has written many
articles in the Times condemning
the Serbian role in prolonging the
civil war in the former Yugoslavia
and occupying Bosnia.
But a majority of audience
members showed their approval
for Lewis with a loud ovation after
ward.
The questions on Bosnia had lit

tie to do with Lewis' lecture, which
outlined the relation of the free
press to the recent movement
against hate speech . Stanford has a
hate speech code that was institut
ed in 1990 which outlaws "harass
ment by personal vilification."
Lewis sharply criticized the in
stitutions of such speech codes as
treading on First Amendment ter
ritory.
"It is still a matter for regret, as
far as I'm concerned, that this
great university lent the weight of
its reputation to the speech code
movement," I^ewissaid.
Lewis pointed out that Stan
ford's code was "careful and nar
row," and has not resulted in any
disciplinary action since it was in
stituted.
Citing attempts to enforce hate
speech laws in Canada, Lewis dis
missed attempts to censure hate
speech as effectively impractical.
"Ladies and gentlemen, the the
ory (on speech codes) is unwork
able — as well as politically and
morally unacceptable," said Lewis.
"The law cannot play favorites
among victims."
Lewis began with a lengthy anal
ysis of free speech precedent,
including the famous Supreme
Court case, New York Times Co. vs.
Sullivan, that is the focus of Lewis'
1991 book, "Make No Law."
Lewis attacked well-known
hate speech code advocates such as
legal scholar Catherine MacKin
non, saying that if we "balance the
value of free speech against the

claims of equality or decency or
good taste . . . the freedom that
makes this country so distinctive
will be at constant risk."
After the lecture, Lewis said
that Stanford should never have
set out a speech code.
"The fact that nothing has been
enforced (by the code) just shows
that it wasn't necessary to have it
in the first place," Lewis said.
"The adoption of a code lends sup
port to a movement I deplore.
Mostly I think it will publicize the
bad guys and not focus on the peo
ple it wants to target."
Lewis graciously fielded ques
tions after the lecture, most of
them centering on his controver
sial views on Bosnia.
"I don't think it's an ideological
issue, it's not a left-right issue," he
said. "I find it very clear cut
The penalty of doing nothing for

peace would be, and is, appalling.
The world should not permit the
destruction of a state which is a
member of the United Nations."
One light moment showed how
devoted some of his readership
are. Losing track of his train of
thought answering one question,
Lewis joked, "Oh, help me, I'm los
ing track of my own answer. I need
a copy of my own book!"
Sure enough, one person in the
front row immediately produced a
copy of "Make No Law" as the
audience laughed and Lewis
bowed in gratitude.
Lewis was invited to campus as
the recipient of the first Lee Hill
Senior Fellowship under the John
S. Knight Fellows Program. The
Knight Program invites respected
journalists to study at Stanford for
a year. According to James Risser,
director of the Knight Program,

the Hill fellowship was endowed
this year to attract a noted jour
nalist to visit Stanford for at least
two weeks, giving a lecture and
visiting various groups on campus.
"1 think this lecture showed
what great knowledge and insight
Mr. Lewis has about the real rea
sons we have a freedom of the
press clause, and why they should
be defended," Risser said.
Though Risser, who introduced
Lewis, regretted that most of the
questions focused on Bosnia
rather than Lewis' speech, he said
that they probably validated
Lewis' views on the freedom of
ideas.
Lewis, a two-time Pulitzer
Prize winner, has written for the
New York Times since the late
19405, and is the author of many
books including "Gideon's Trum
pet" and"Portrait of a Decade."
