# Gore kicks up heels in Palo Alto

### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Vice President A 1 Gore swept into Palo Alto last
night to boost local Congresswoman Anna Eshooand
announce the release of a legislative package aimed at
promoting the "information superhighway."
In a brief speech before a crowd of 300, Gore
praised Eshoo — who is up for re-election this year —
and said she "showed courage" in voting for the
North American Free Trade Agreement, a move that
may cost her the support of organized labor.
But Gore made a point of dismissing speculation

that his fund-raising visit was a payback for Eshoo's
support of NAFTA, adding that he campaigned for
Eshoo as far back as 1988.
"People say, 'You're trying to go around and help
the people who helped you,' " he said. "If that's true,
how come I was out here in 1988? I've known Anna
for a long time."
Gore also introduced Rep. Norman Minetaand En
ergy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, in town to dedicate the
B factory at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
Eshoo "played a key role in gett ing t he B factory here,"
