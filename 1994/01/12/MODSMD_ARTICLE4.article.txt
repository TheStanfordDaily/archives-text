# Gore kicks up heels in Palo Alto

### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Vice President A 1 Gore swept into Palo Alto last
night to boost local Congresswoman Anna Eshooand
announce the release of a legislative package aimed at
promoting the "information superhighway."
In a brief speech before a crowd of 300, Gore
praised Eshoo — who is up for re-election this year —
and said she "showed courage" in voting for the
North American Free Trade Agreement, a move that
may cost her the support of organized labor.
But Gore made a point of dismissing speculation

that his fund-raising visit was a payback for Eshoo's
support of NAFTA, adding that he campaigned for
Eshoo as far back as 1988.
"People say, 'You're trying to go around and help
the people who helped you,' " he said. "If that's true,
how come I was out here in 1988? I've known Anna
for a long time."
Gore also introduced Rep. Norman Minetaand En
ergy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, in town to dedicate the
B factory at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
Eshoo "played a key role in gett ing t he B factory here,"


Al Gore
Gore said.
He left the $l()0-a-head event
— which drew both pro-Perot
and anti-NAFTA picketers — just
after 7 p.m. for a pricier fund
raiser, a dinner setting attendees
back $1,000.
Eshoo spokesman Cliff Staton
said the two events are expected
to raise about $200,000 for the
freshman congresswoman.
Earlier in the day, at a press
conference following his arrival at
Moffett Field, Gore announced
the next step in the administra
tion's attempt to regulate infor
mation technology.
"On behalf of the Clinton
administration, I am releasing
today a legislative package to
reform the telecommunications
sector of our economy," Gore
said. He introduced the legisla

tion earlier yesterday at an
"information superhighway sum
mit" held at UCLA.
The legislation supports
removing legal and regulatory
barriers that prevent telephone,
cable and long distance companies
from entering each others' busi
ness.
"We hope to secure passage
this year," he added, vowing that
by the year 2000, businesses will
have connected "every classroom,
every school in America, every
library and every hospital and
clinic" to the information super
highway.
The coming changes "will
transform our civilization as pro
foundly as the printing press,"
but much more quickly, Gore pre
dicted.
Today, he plans to tour Monte
Vista High School in Cupertino.
Students there are participating
in a model computer education
program.
At the Eshoo fund-raiser, Gore

showed a lighter side by playing
on his Tennessee twang to explain
the difference between members
of Congress who create positive
change and those who "kinda,
just, y'know, sit there." Eshoo is
one of the group of 48 women in
Congress who are "just bustin'
that glass ceiling all over the
place," Gore added.
He also showed off an ability to
laugh at himself, describing his
surprise when Jay Leno held a
contest to see if any audience
members could dance worse than
the vice president.
"On inauguration night I
danced quite a bit," Gore said.
After seeing him on television, lu>
said, people came up to him to
say, "Your wife is a great
dancer."
After repeating a Leno joke
"If you use strobe lights, it
looks like A 1 Gore is moving!"
Gore sighed and added, "You
learn to live with a lot in public
service."
