### Charles Katz Staff writer 
Despite opposition from nation
alist groups, Russia should contin
ue its democratic reforms and ex
pect the current turmoil to die
down soon, two experts in Soviet af
fairs said yesterday at a panel dis
cussion in StaufTer Auditorium.

Former U.S Ambassador to the
Soviet Union -lack F Matlock, Jr
and Ilia Zaslavsky — a member of
the Russian parliament since 1988
spoke to a crowd of nearly 40
people, primarily about the eco
nomic difficulties Russia will be
facing as it tries to shift to a free
market economy. The discussion
was sponsored by the Hoover
Institution.
The men agreed that political
and economic reforms should con
tinue in Russia, and that the Rus
sian government should not yield
to pressure from nationalist
groups.
Matlock stressed that the cur
rent reforms should not be slowed,
even in view of a recent national
election that showed a large per
centage of Russians support the
fascistic party of Vladimir Zhiri
novsky. Matlock said, "No group
of reforms can go smoothly. The
criticism that the reforms moved
too fast is wrong."
However, the rise of Zhiri
novsky and the apparent anti
reform movement is coming from
a rather surprising side, Zaslavsky

said.
"Capitalists do not want to con
tinue reforms because they are
making money now," he said.
"Capitalist-monopolized enter
prises want to slow reform.
Therefore, they support Zhiri
novsky."
Zaslavsky said breaking apart
such monopolies is one reason
why reforms must progress. "I
agree with Matlock that the
worst thing (to do) is to slow
reform."
Zaslavsky is a political coun
selor to Yegor Gaidar, the Russian
First Vice Prime Minister and
architect of Russia's move toward
a market economy.
Matlock — Soviet ambassador
from 1987 to 1991, who now
works at the School of Interna
tional and Public Affairs at
Columbia University — said that
a second wrong conclusion to draw
from the December elections is
that "the nationalist groups are so
powerful that they must be

appeased." According to Matlock,
any sort of compromise will create
problems.
"Democratic forces overall are
stronger," Matlock pointed out.
The reason for Zhirinovsky's
high showing in the election is due
not necessarily to his popularity,
but rather to dissatisfaction with
Boris Yeltsin's quasi-Democratic
regime, Zaslavsky said. Zhiri
novsky's nationalists made a stun
ningly strong showing in the
December elections; his party
holds the second highest number
of seats in parliament.
The disfavor toward the
Yeltsin government is a result of
the rapid changes in the market
system leading to problems,
Zaslavsky added. "There is noth
ing in the shops. People don't
want to make jobs because there
is nothing to buy if they had a job.
With no jobs, there is nothing in
the shops."
Matlock agreed that the people
are not necessarily in the mood

for another revolution. "The
great majority of people are
unattached. They are waiting for
a street car instead of storming
the Bastille."
With that in mind, Matlock
said the turmoil which plagued
the Russian domestic arena in
1993 will most assuredly slow
down. "Things this year will be
quieter on the political front" in
Russia, he said.
Matlock also predicted that the
United States would have a rela
tively small role in the whole
affair. "The United States will
have only a marginal influence on
Russia. Russians will decide their
future."
Matlock suggested that the
United States contribute advisers,
not money. "The idea that the
United States can only help with
money is condescending."
Zaslavsky said the difficulties
in Russia are a shared predica
ment. "It's a common problem.
Let's resolve it all together."
