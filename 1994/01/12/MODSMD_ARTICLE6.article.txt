# 'Without a doubt, SLAC was the right place to locate the B factory'
## Starting with a bang Politicians, workers show up for inauguration of SLAC B factory 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary
launched Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter into the next phase of its 31-year exis
tence yesterday by inaugurating the $237
million B-factorv project at a ceremony at
tended by about 700 employees and digni
taries.
Earlier in the day, O'Leary formally ap
propriated the first $14 million of the pro
ject's cost, which will be spread out over five
years. The B factory, if built on schedule,
will be completed in 1998. t
Announced by President Clinton in Octo
ber, the Department of Energy 's decision to

build its B factory facility at Stanford saved
hundreds of jobs that were slated for elimi
nation because of budget cuts. Stanford was
picked over Cornell University in a national
competition for the project.
In addition to inaugurating the facility,
O'Leary met with SLAC officials over lunch
and toured the site of the future facility,
which will replace the center's now-silent
Positron-Electron Project (PEP) ring.
At the inauguration ceremony, hundreds
of SLAC employees crammed into a ware
house-size room that will eventually hold a
key component of the B factory. During her
remarks, O'Learv acted more like a skillful

politician than a Washington
bureaucrat, stressing the pro
ject's human impact. Standing on
a podium, she asked the name of
the baby of an employee, Julia
Weiler, who was sitting in the
front row holding her two-month
old daughter, Rachel.

"What this project means is a
future for Rachel and the unborn
youngsters in today's world,"

O'Leary said. "I know the benefi
ciaries [of this project). It's the
Rachels."
After her speech, O'Leary sym
bolically started construction on
the project by remotely operating
a crane to lift a car-sized magnet
from the old PEP facility. Compo
nents of this ring will be renovat
ed to be part of the new B factory.
The audience of SLAC employ
ees and scientists associated with
the project also heard from sever
al California politicians, who all
stressed the recent success of the
state's representatives in

Congress.
"It's a new delegation in Wash
ington," said Sen. Dianne Fein
stein, explaining that California's
representatives are more respon
sive than ever to the state's
needs. She added that projects
like the B factory are investments
that can markedly improve local
economies by increasing "spin
on"' consumer spending.
In a statement read at the cer
emony, Gov. Pete Wilson agreed,
saying that "California is making
a great comeback and the B facto
ry is a big part of that."

The ceremony's speakers also
focused on the reasons why the
Bay Area is the right place for the
B factory.
"Science and technology ... is
the (strong) suit for the state of
California," Feinstein said.
"I have always been proud of
the work that gets done here at
SLAC," Rep. Norman Mineta (D-
San Jose) said. "Without a doubt,
SLAC was the right place to
locate the B factory."
In addition to keeping high
tech jobs, Mineta said, the deci
sion "extends SIACs vitality into

the next century."
After the ceremony, Mineta
downplayed the chances of SLAC
losing its funding to budget cuts,
as happened with the Supercon
ducting Super Collider in Texas.
That facility was 20 percent com
plete when Congress pulled fund
ing in October.
"It's not a budget-busting pro
ject like the SSC was," Mineta
said.
O'Leary agreed, saying that
"the future of this project is excel
lent. . . . We've got to manage
these projects well | but 1 I know

that this project will be well man
aged."
When fully operational, the
two rings of the B factory will be
used to accelerate and collide
positrons and electrons. These
collisions will produce particles
called B-mesons and anti B
mesons, which SLAC scientists
will study to gain insight on the
differences between matter and
anti-matter. Scientists hope that
they will be able to use this infor
mation to better explain why the
vast majority of the observable
universe is made up of matter.

they will be able to use this infor
mation to better explain why the
vast majority of the observable
universe is made up of matter.
