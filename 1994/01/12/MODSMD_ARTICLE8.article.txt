## Serbs may face air strikes NATO leaders support protection of Muslims in Bosnia 
### 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) —
After months of empty threats,
President Clinton and his NATO
allies warned Serb forces yesterday
of a new determination to launch
air strikes if needed to relieve
embattled Muslim enclaves in
Bosnia. "My resolve is there," Clin
ton said.
At the end of a two-day summit,
the 16 Western leaders announced
their willingness to order bombing
raids if Bosnian Serbs continue to
prevent the opening of a major air
port for aid supplies or the rotation
of encircled peace keepers.
"Whether they occur or not
depends upon the behavior of the
Bosnian Serbs from this moment
forward," Clinton told reporters at
the end of the meeting of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
The first reaction from the Serb
forces was negative. Their chief of
staff, Manojlo Milovanovic, warned
that U.N. troops would also suffer
in any air campaign because his

forces would stay close to peace
keepers. "They cannot strike at us
without also hitting U.N. forces,"
he said.
"There is a very real determina
tion" to carry out the warnings,
said British Prime Minister John
Major. He had in the past opposed
air strikes for fear of reprisals
against his country's 2,200 peace
keepers in Bosnia.
"I made it clear that for our part
we were prepared to follow
through," Clinton said.
And if the Bosnian Serbs don't
get the message, he said later, after
meeting with officials of the 12-
nation European Union, "We'll see
if our resolve is there. My resolve is
there."
But Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien appeared hesitant.
He said he only reluctantly went
along with the others. "We don't
believe it is necessary to have air
strikes to protect" 150 Canadian
peace keepers in Srebrenica, he

said.
The NATO leaders, in a final
statement, raised the prospect of
bombing raids to evacuate the
Canadians from Srebrenica in east
ern Bosnia and force open the air
port at Tuzla, a key conduit for aid
to the north.
In toughening their stand, the
allies seemed to move closer to mil
itary intervention in the conflict
raging on their doorstep. More
than 200,000 people have died
since fighting broke out when
Bosnian Serbs rebelled against
independence from Yugoslavia
nearly 21 months ago.
The Bosnian crisis dominated
the final day of the NATO summit,
which was called by Clinton to
adopt measures to modernize the
44-year-old alliance and give it new
missions in the post-Cold War era.
To do that, the leaders declared
a readiness to let their former foes
in Eastern Europe join the elite
fraternity one day.
