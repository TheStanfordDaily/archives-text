# Clinton may appoint special prosecutor

WASHINGTON (AP) — President
Clinton said yesterday he is reevalu
ating his opposition to having a spe
cial prosecutor investigate the Clin
tons' controversial Arkansas land
investment in Whitewater Develop
ment Corp.
One administration official said
the White House was seriously con
sidering asking Attorney General
Janet Reno to appoint a special prose
cutor.
"The most important thing to me
and the most important thing to the
American people is I'm completely
relaxed about this because I didn't do
anything wrong," Clinton said in an
interview with CBS News.
Another administration official
said no decisions had been made, but
that calling for a special prosecutor
appointed by Reno was one option
being debated. Both officials spoke on
condition of anonymity.

As a growing number of Democrats
joined Republicans in calling for
appointment of a special counsel,
some Clinton advisers believe such a
step is the only way to end the politi
cal damage, the officials said.
Clinton said he found it "bewilder
ing" that some people were demand
ing a criminal investigation even
though there are no specific allega
tions of wrongdoing by him or his
wife related to their former part own
ership of Whitewater at the time he
was Arkansas governor.
Clinton, in the Czech Republic to
meet with Eastern European leaders
as part of his weeklong trip abroad,
said in the CBS interview that he
found it odd that calls for a special
counsel continued even after he
turned over his Whitewater records to
Justice Department investigators.
"People said, 'That's not enough,'
so I think we have to evaluate that

and see where we are," Clinton said.
In opposing the appointment of a
special prosecutor, the White House
had hoped to cast demands for
appointing a prosecutor as political
attacks from Re-publicans. But those
hopes have been dashed in recent
days as a growing number of
Democrats urged Reno to name one.
"Whether it is reality or not
doesn't matter — the perception is
that the White House is withholding
information," Democratic Sen. Bob
Kerrey of Nebraska said in an inter
view Tuesday. "This one is not going
away so the way to get it off the table
is to get someone independent to take
a look at it."
Kerrey was at least the fifth Demo
cratic senator in the past three days
to suggest an independent investiga
tion, a development that has forced
the White House to scramble anew to
re-assess its strategy.
