# Tresidder loses staff, Student Activities office
## 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
As budget cuts loom on the horizon,
Tresidder Union is facing the departure of
several staff members and internal restruc
turing that has removed the Office of Student
Activities from its authority.
Tresidder Director Roberta Braden said
there are currently two vacancies on the staff
of 15, and she expects two more people to
leave within the next few weeks. While
Braden said each person was leaving for "per
sonal reasons," she admitted one factor in the
departures may have been the upcoming bud
get cuts and the staff restructuring that
would result.
In addition, the Office of Student Activi
ties has been removed from Tresidder's au
thority and will now report directly to the
Dean of Students' Office. Tresidder is still
under the authority of the dean's office, as be
fore.
"Because the Provost has asked us as part
of the budget-reduction process to reduce ex
penses at Tresidder, what we've decided is to
separate . . . student activities from retail ac
tivities," Dean of Students Michael Jackson
said. He said the move will allow Braden and
her staff to concentrate on the financial re
structuring at Tresidder.
"IThe University has| asked Tresidder to
be more self-sufficient financially," said
Nanci Howe, director of the Office of Student
Activities. However, she said she did not fore
see "any dramatic change" in her office's op
erations.
Jackson said the change was a return to an
earlier configuration. Student Activities had
been placed under Tresidder's authority
three years ago to take greater advantage of
Tresidder's staff resources in the face of ear
lier budget cuts.
"It's the cycles of life," Jackson mused.
Braden said that impending cutbacks at
Tresidder will involve cutting
spending and possibly eliminating
some staff positions.
But despite the cuts, she said
"most of the services" at Tresidder
will continue to operate.
The cuts might even accelerate
some changes, such as the arrival
of Taco Bell, because Tresidder
will want the revenue the new ser
vices will produce, said Paul Szcze
siul, associate director of Tresid
der.
Braden said her office was
awaiting word from Provost Con

doleezza Rice and Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds
regarding the depth of the cuts.
People who have decided to
leave Tresidder "were making
decisions (based) on their own per
sonal needs," she said.
Among those leaving the staff is
Szczesiul. He said he is taking
medical leave for an indeterminate
amount of time and that Braden
will take over his responsibilities
starting Jan. 21.
"It's a potential vacancy, but
definitely not a resignation,"he
said.
Braden said her office will have
to "figure out how we're going to
operate with less money and fewer
people."
