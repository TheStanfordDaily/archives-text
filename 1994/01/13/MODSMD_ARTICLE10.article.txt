## Clinton concedes to investigation of Whitewater 
### 
WASHINGTON (AF) - President Clinton
reluctantly gave in yesterday to relentless political
pressure for a special counsel to investigate his
1980s real estate investment with a controversial
Arkansas businessman.
Attorney General Janet Reno quickly said she
would comply with the request and name an inde
pendent investigator "as soon as possible."
While vehemently denying that the Clintons had
done anything wrong — or that the appointment
was even necessary — the White House said the
political controversy over the Whitewater Develop
ment Corp. investment had left Clinton little
choice but to drop his opposition to a special coun
sel.
"The Clintons have been subjected to a barrage
of innuendo, political posturing and irresponsible
accusations," said White House adviser George
Stephanopoulos. But Stephanopoulos said that
even many of the Republicans demanding an inves
tigation were predicting the Clintons would be
exonerated.
The White House move did not mollify Republi
cans, who after weeks of demanding that Attorney
General Janet Reno name a special counsel reacted
to the White House decision by questioning
whether her pick would be impartial.
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said the fact
that Reno was acting at Clinton's request indicated
"she's not in effect an independent attorney gener
al. The president ought to be free and clear of this.
It's clear he's calling the shots." Dole said that law
makers would not tolerate "any perception of a
whitewash."
However, Stephanopoulos said the White House
had already asked that Reno appoint a special
counsel "who is not a member of the Department of
Justice or an employee of the federal government"
to conduct the investigation.
The dramatic reversal by the White House, which
for weeks has opposed Republicans calls for a special

counsel investigation, was welcomed by Democrats
who were growing increasingly critical of the admin
istration's handling of the matter — and increasing
ly worried the issue was developing into a major
political embarrassment for the president.
Investigators are trying to determine whether
depositors' funds were diverted from Madison
Guaranty Savings and Loan to help retire Clinton's
1984 gubernatorial campaign debt and whether
thrift money was improperly deposited in the
Whitewater account.
