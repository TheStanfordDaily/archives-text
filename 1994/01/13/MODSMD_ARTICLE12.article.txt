KIEV, Ukraine (AP) — Presi
dent Clinton nailed down an agree
ment yesterday with Ukraine to
eliminate the third-largest nuclear
arsenal in the world by the end of
the century. Closing the deal, he
offered increased economic assis
tance and security guarantees.
After a short airport meeting
with Ukraine's President Leonid
M. Kravchuk, Clinton said the
accord would be signed in Moscow
by them and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin tomorrow.
Clinton said earlier his "urgent
task" in Moscow would be to press
for reform and against growing
nationalism.
At a joint news conference with
Kravchuk, who wanted the Kiev
stopover as a prestige boost, Clin
ton said Ukraine could count on
assurances from Washington and
Moscow that it would not be
attacked with nuclear weapons.
Moreover, Clinton said, "We are
prepared to increase our support
substantially." A senior U.S. official
said on the flight to Kiev from

Prague that U.S. aid of $155 mil
lion a year could be doubled or
increased even beyond that.
Additionally, Ukraine is to
receive $177 million from a fund set
up by Congress to cover costs of dis
mantling 1,800 nuclear warheads
and up to $1 billion once the urani
um in the warheads is reprocessed
and sold for use in nuclear reactors.
Kravchuk hailed the agreement.
"I am sure that this day and the
forthcoming days open the way for
the world for disarmament and for
the elimination of nuclear weap
ons," he said.
In addition to the promise of
Western aid, Russia, which pro
vides Ukraine with about 96 per
cent of its energy, has promised to
sell oil and gas at bargain rates and
to respect Ukraine's territory.
Clinton's summit with Yeltsin is
even more challenging than shep
herding the arms accord with
Ukraine.
The trip to Moscow was planned
initially to showcase U.S. support
for political and economic reform.

But the hardships that abrupt
change have caused the Russian
people — along with the growing
political strength of ultranational
ists — have turned Clinton's visit
into a tough diplomatic test.
Expectations even from reform
ers are modest.
"Clinton will smell the air of
Russia and will understand that
(the situation) here is more com
plex than what is perceived in the
United States," said Yeltsin ally
Mikhail Poltoranin, a deputy in the
lower chamber of parliament.
Russian reformers are divided,
some determined to move ahead at
full speed, others inclined to slow
down and to soften the shock of
transition to a free-market system.
"The forces of reform need to find
ways to work together and to speak,
if not with one voice, at least with a
common message," Clinton said.
Clinton may offer Yeltsin new
financial assistance on top of the $4
billion pledged last year for human
itarian aid, housing and privatiza
tion efforts.
