MAYBE LAKE Lagunita
doesn't provide ideal surf
ing conditions. But we
could always use our imaginations.
Stanford, a university in desper
ate need of more student-unifying
traditions, should coordinate an
all-campus beach party on the
shores of Lake Lagunita.
This festive event, which would
be held sometime during spring
quarter, could be organized by any
number of student groups: Stan
ford Alumni Network, Axe Com
mittee, the Senior Class Presidents
or the Student Affairs Committee
of the ASSU. The group (or groups)
that sponsored "Stanford Splash"
could potentially raise funds for
both themselves and the Universi
ty, thereby accomplishing two
important tasks with a single event
â€” unifying Stanford students and
practicing creative fund-raising.
The party could be held on the
beach of Lake Lag, and additional
activities could be located in the
parking lot adjacent to the lake. A
concurrent volleyball tournament

could also be organized, with com
peting teams from different resi
dences or organizations. A small
entry fee would help ensure a prof
it for the organizers.
The Splash could also include
Great America-esque games or
contests, such as toss-the-dime-on
the-plate or a water-balloon toss.
Sophisticated ideas aren't neces
sary; many students would jump at
the chance to be reminded of their
youthful games on a warm, sunny
spring afternoon.
Of course, food is also a must, and
would provide the most income to
the organizers. Stanford students
are easily satisfied with sandwiches,
pizza or even ample amounts of
frozen yogurt. Set the scene to
music and the party is complete.
Stanford vitally needs more tra
ditions along the lines of MuFuUn-
Sun to boost morale and give stu
dents a sense of unity. After all,
happy students often become gener
ous alumni.
Besides, there's a reason students
chose to go to school in California.
