EVEN a Small Grant can make
a Big Difference. The Small
Grant Program, that is. This
new plan, recently adopted by the
Stanford Medical Center, will give
grants of up to $20,000 to nurses,
doctors or other staffers who pro
pose ideas that will improve care
and efficiency at the Medical Center.
This program marks another
step toward intelligent economiz
ing at Stanford. Instead of spend
ing untold thousands of dollars on
"cost-cutting committees," the
Med Center has created a program
which relies on its greatest asset —
the brainpower of its staff — to
produce effective, lasting change.
The application for grants
requires that proposed projects
affect one of four targeted areas:
efficacy, appropriateness, efficiency
or organization/management.
Essentially, the Med Center has

given its staffers free reign in con
tributing suggestions which they
feel will make their workplace a
better facility both for themselves
and the people which it treats.
Moreover, Med Center adminis
trators have shrewdly decided to
continue funding only if the project
proves successful, thereby elimi
nating the danger of a white ele
phant-like project that lives far
beyond its era of usefulness.
Admittedly, Med Center person
nel have set modest goals for the
program, nevertheless, if the pro
ject is successful, the Med Center
will reap far-reaching benefits —
and will have taught a lesson to the
rest of the University in the pro
cess.
For the Med Center would have
shown that chasms — or deficits
— can only be bridged through
effort from both sides.
