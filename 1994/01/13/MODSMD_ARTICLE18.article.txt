## Denying students a voice 
### 
THE PAGES OF The Daily are filled
with expressions of student outrage
these days. Student anger stems
largely from fear that vital student-orient
ed services will be cut. Although campus
attention is focused on the issue of the eth
nic centers, I think it is important not to let
that issue obscure an equally important
one. Students have been systematically and
deliberately excluded from the entire deci
sion process. Is this appropriate or justifi
able?
While it seems like an intellectual exer
cise, the model or metaphor of the universi
ty in which you choose to conceptualize it
dictates your answer to the question of the
role of students in policy formation. One
model assigns students to the role of client.
This metaphor suggests that the university
is a business, and that business is educating
students. If students don't like the offer
ings or quality of the education, they can go
elsewhere.
This portrayal implies that the dialogue
between students and administrators is
limited. Students react to what administra
tors do by voting with their feet and their
alumni contributions. There is no discus
sion of philosophy, nor of making changes
to accommodate the needs and interests of
the students who are currently enrolled.
However, the university is not a store; it is
simple to buy your next pair of jeans from a
different retailer. It Ls not so easy to change
colleges.

I prefer to conceptualize students as cit
izens. As citizens, students are entitled and
encouraged to participate. In fact, it is
incumbent on citizens to understand their
community and to work to improve it. We
are falling woefully short of this vision
these days.
Traditional channels of participation
have been closed to students. Information
is systematically denied to students, who
are then dismissed for being "ignorant and
uninformed." This is a hypocritical stance;
particularly in an educational institution! It
is pathological to simultaneously ask for
student input, and then announce that
input will not be considered. The students
in the ethnic centers were told "letter writ
ing campaigns will not have an effect",
while at the same time, "Tell the Vice
Provost what you think about budget cuts"
invitations appeared in The Daily.
Efficiency was the primary justification
for removing student participants from the
decision process. Business slogans, not edu
cational justifications, are creeping into the
vocabulary. A faculty member recently
asked: if we aspire to make Stanford "lean
and mean," what are the characteristics of
a "mean" institution? I believe that one
hallmark of a "mean" university is one
whose citizens are denied involvement in
decision making.
I am a firm believer in student participa
tion as part of the formal, normal decision
making processes. Past budget decisions

were better because there was systematic
student input. Not only did some hard
working students participate, but their con
tributions were attended to. This collabora
tive route was discounted this time.
Dean of Students Jackson has just
opened a dialogue with students in the eth
nic centers. This is an important step, but
we need to involve students in all parts of
the decision making: Does Stanford need a
student union? What should the priorities
of the Department of Athletics be? Are
there obsolete academic programs? What
are the University's fund-raising priori
ties?
Removing students as collaborators in
the governance process reduces the avail
able avenues for student participation.
Unwittingly, the administration is urging
students to reclaim their participatory
rights and obligations through protest and
disobedience. One unintended consequence
of current practice may be press confer
ences, protests and sit-ins. I hope I am
wrong, but unless the secretive process is
radically, rapidly and publicly changed, I
predict that it will be a lively spring on aim
pus.

Chris hopes that her fortune-telling
attempts will prove irieorreet.
