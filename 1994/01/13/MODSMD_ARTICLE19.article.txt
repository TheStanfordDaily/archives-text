## Proposed multi-faith center poses spiritual problems 
### 
I BELIEVE that Dean of Memorial
Church Robert Gregg's proposal to
create a multi-faith center is funda
mentally flawed. While his intentions
are noble, his methods are misguided. I
object to this center on two grounds,
one spiritual and one practical.
That Dean Gregg seeks to provide a
location other than the overwhelmingly
Christian Memorial Church is a worthy

goal. However, it violates my religious
beliefs to practice and study my faith
in surroundings dedicated to any god
but my own. A multi-faith center
would provide an alternative to the
Christian Memorial Church. However,
it would still not address requirements
for a place different, non-Christian
faiths could call their own.
From a practical perspective,

reserving valuable meeting space for
religious purposes is wasteful. The
facilities would only be in use a frac
tion of the time. Unless the facility
was huge, it could not accommodate
more than one faith's services at a
single time.
I propose that instead of creating
new facilities, Dean Gregg should work
with University officials to ensure that

all faiths be accommodated in existing
space for their diverse and unique spir
itual needs. If all Dean Gregg wants is
a place for people of different faiths to
come together and discuss issues, I
would suggest any one of the numerous
auditoriums and meeting rooms that
the University has already constructed.
