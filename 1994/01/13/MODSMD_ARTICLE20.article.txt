# Cardinal to try to exorcise Sun Devils tonight
## 
### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
Tonight's the night.
If you want to see the Cardi
nal women's basketball team
take the court at Maples Pavil
ion, but you also have plans to
go away for the upcoming holi
day weekend, then Stanford's
matchup with Arizona State
tonight marks your only chance
to see the squad in the month of
January.
As a quirky schedule calls for
five of the Cardinal's first seven
Pacific 10 Conference games to
played on the road, Stanford (8-
3, 1-1 in the Pac-10) returns
home for a two-game set — Ari
zona visits on Saturday night —
and will not return to Maples'
friendly confines until after the
calendar turns another page.
After splitting its first two
conference games in Washing
ton last week, Stanford slipped
two spots to No. 11 in the Asso
ciated Press poll. However, the
Cardinal should feel little heat
from the unranked Sun Devils
(2-7, 0-1) as it puts a five-game
home winning streak on the
line tonight.
As it has in each of its previ
ous six contests, the Cardinal
should start freshman Jamila
Wideman and junior Kate Paye
at guard, freshman Kate Star
bird and junior Rachel Hemmer
at forward and junior Anita
Kaplan at center. Yet, based on
a pair of performances by
reserves last week, head coach
Tara VanDerveer may go to her
bench early tonight, especially
if Stanford opens a large Lead.
Freshman forward Tara
Harrington turned in the most
notable back-up showing dur
ing the Cardinal's 82-67 victory
at Washington State last Satur
day, netting 14 of her career
high 16 points in the game's
decisive final 8-1/2 minutes.

Her eight-of-nine free throw
shooting also qualified her for
the Pac-10 leadership in charity
stripe conversion, where Har
rington now stands in fourth
place with her .815 mark.
Senior guard Christy Hedg
peth, who made both of her free
throw attempts Saturday and
has shot a third-place 82 per
cent on the season, also contin
ued her return to starting form
with a 13-point showing against
the Cougars. Hedgpeth, who
now resides in 14th place on the
all-time Stanford scoring list
with 1,048 career points, has
put up double figures in four of
her last five games and current
ly averages a respectable 8.4
points per game.
Among Cardinal starters,
Kaplan (15.3 ppg) and Hemmer
(15.0 ppg) continue to average in
double figures, but neither ranks
among the conference's top 10 in
that category. On the Sun Devil
side of the court, however, senior
forward Melani Francis ranks
ninth among Pac-10 scorers with
a lofty 16 ppg average.
Junior forward Nikki
Thompson follows with a 13-
point average for head coach
Jacqueline Hullah's squad,
while a pair of newcomers —
freshman guards Tiffany Kra
henbuhl and Molly Tuter —
hover near the double-figure
mark for the Sun Devils.
Stanford owns a 16-7 advan
tage in this one-sided series,
with the Cardinal emerging vic
torious in 11 of the last 12
encounters. Stanford swept the
woeful Sun Devils last season,
including a surprisingly narrow
85-80 win at Maples.

dents get in free with Stanford
I.D. The game will also be car
ried live on KZSU (90.1 FM),
