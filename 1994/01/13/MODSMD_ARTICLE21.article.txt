## Patient Wiley works toward top '1996 Olympic darkhorse,' freshman strives for stardom 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
An old Chinese proverb states that even a journey
of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
Such patience and persistence has already paid off
for freshman Keith Wiley. Once a six-year-old tum
bling student, the Florida native is now a standout on
Stanford's two-time defending national champion
men's gymnastics team.
However, both Wiley and Cardinal head coach
Sadao Hamada know that this steady-paced journey
can't end, at least not yet. They both know that there
are a few more steps that Wylie must take, steps
which may lead Stanford to its third consecutive
NCAA crown.
"Keith has great potential on all levels," Hamada
said. "He can make a great contribution to winning
NCAAs again. I don't want him taking short cuts. 1
want him to keep improving and reach his potential
under my coaching.
"It's going to be a steady, step-by-step process, and
it's going to take a lot of patience on his part and my
part. I don't want to make him an instant champion."
Like many who have risen to the top, Wiley has
never been an instant champion.
Although he began his tumbling lessons at age six,
Wiley did not take gymnastics classes until age 11,
when he decided he wanted to increase his effort. It
was only after this transition that Wiley realized he
possessed talent in his sport and began competing.
Still, the next few years progressed slowly.
"Then in 10th grade, things began to come togeth
er," Wiley recounted. "I realized my potential more,
and I began winning more."
Sophomore year in high school eventually became
the first season Wiley entered the gymnastics spot
light. The budding gymnast captured the national
title in floor exercises that year, and, overall, finished
16th in Class Two (out of five) gymnastics.
As a junior, Wiley once again had to be patient as
he made the transition into Class One gymnastics,
the most competitive high-school division. He did
return to nationals that season, but he placed 4'2nd.
Nonetheless, Wiley had advanced to the next level —
he revisited nationals in Class One. All that remained
was to perform better at the same event the next
year.
And Wiley did just that. In 1993, he captured the
national vault championship, placed second in floor
exercises and finished third overall. His accomplish
ments earned him a position on the Junior National
Team.
Only now, as a Cardinal, has Wiley's success in
gymnastics, taken a surprising leap. Entering the
Spartan Open this past weekend, Hamada did not
expect his gymnasts to win the event or even score
high points on their routines. The coach as well as his
team viewed the first competition of the year as an
opportunity to test early season skill level. In partial-

lar, the freshmen merely want
ed to evaluate their own transi
tion to collegiate gymnastics.
Instead of passing the test,
Wiley set the curve. The Cardi
nal won four of six total events,
with Wiley leading the way with
first-place routines in both the
vault and the high bars.
"I'm still trying to improve
(my) basic (skills), though,"
Wiley said. "You can't improve
unless you improve basics.
That's where we're different
from other teams."
"Coach Hamada is a great
influence that way," Wiley
added. "He's a big presence . . .
He's always watching and
observing, always looking to
make you a better gymnast. It
was interesting at the Spartan
Open. You thought you did a
good routine, but he would come
tell you what was wrong with it.

It's a good humbling influence."
Currently, Hamada feels that
Wiley's specialties, the vault and
floor exercises, are extremely
strong and ready to make signifi
cant impact early in the Cardinal's
bid for a three-peat. The coach
plans to improve Wiley's pommel
horse routine for contribution
within the next month and have
the freshman prepared in all three
remaining events — the rings, par
allel bars and high bars — by the
end of the regular season.
"It's just a matter of time,"
Hamada said. "It's just a matter
of basics and getting stronger.
Keith is a hard worker and he's
very coachable."
In addition to making himself
a better gymnast all-around,
Wiley will develop his trade
mark routines to NCAA-Cham
pionship standards. For the
vault, he hopes to master a
Kasamatsu back layout with a
double twist coming off the
vault. For floor exercises, Wiley
will practice a full-twisting, dou
ble-back Arabian double front,

which is a maneuver involving a
double back flip with a half
twist in the first flip so that the
gymnast lands facing the same
direction he or she began from.
"I want him to compete in the
U.S. Championships after
NCAAs," Hamada said when
pressed to look further ahead in
Wiley's career. "I want him to
make the developmental team
for the U.S. National Team.
He's a dark horse for the 1996
Olympics. He's got everything
he needs."
Wiley, too, mentioned the
1996 Olympics as an ultimate
goal. However, the freshman,
keeping to his step-by-step
patience and focus, had difficul
ty describing his role as a team
leader a couple years from now.
"This is just my second quar
ter," Wiley said. "Besides my
work ethic, I really don't know
what kind of qualities I would
bring to the team. Our goal is to
win NCAAs again this year.
That's where my priorities are
right now."
