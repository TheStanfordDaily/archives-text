## Patient Wiley works toward top '1996 Olympic darkhorse,' freshman strives for stardom 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
An old Chinese proverb states that even a journey
of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
Such patience and persistence has already paid off
for freshman Keith Wiley. Once a six-year-old tum
bling student, the Florida native is now a standout on
Stanford's two-time defending national champion
men's gymnastics team.
However, both Wiley and Cardinal head coach
Sadao Hamada know that this steady-paced journey
can't end, at least not yet. They both know that there
are a few more steps that Wylie must take, steps
which may lead Stanford to its third consecutive
NCAA crown.
"Keith has great potential on all levels," Hamada
said. "He can make a great contribution to winning
NCAAs again. I don't want him taking short cuts. 1
want him to keep improving and reach his potential
under my coaching.
"It's going to be a steady, step-by-step process, and
it's going to take a lot of patience on his part and my
part. I don't want to make him an instant champion."
Like many who have risen to the top, Wiley has
never been an instant champion.
Although he began his tumbling lessons at age six,
Wiley did not take gymnastics classes until age 11,
when he decided he wanted to increase his effort. It
was only after this transition that Wiley realized he
possessed talent in his sport and began competing.
Still, the next few years progressed slowly.
"Then in 10th grade, things began to come togeth
er," Wiley recounted. "I realized my potential more,
and I began winning more."
Sophomore year in high school eventually became
the first season Wiley entered the gymnastics spot
light. The budding gymnast captured the national
title in floor exercises that year, and, overall, finished
16th in Class Two (out of five) gymnastics.
As a junior, Wiley once again had to be patient as
he made the transition into Class One gymnastics,
the most competitive high-school division. He did
return to nationals that season, but he placed 4'2nd.
Nonetheless, Wiley had advanced to the next level —
he revisited nationals in Class One. All that remained
was to perform better at the same event the next
year.
And Wiley did just that. In 1993, he captured the
national vault championship, placed second in floor
exercises and finished third overall. His accomplish
ments earned him a position on the Junior National
Team.
Only now, as a Cardinal, has Wiley's success in
gymnastics, taken a surprising leap. Entering the
Spartan Open this past weekend, Hamada did not
expect his gymnasts to win the event or even score
high points on their routines. The coach as well as his
team viewed the first competition of the year as an
opportunity to test early season skill level. In partial-
