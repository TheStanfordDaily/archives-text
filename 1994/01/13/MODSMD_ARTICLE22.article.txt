## Men's hoops to face first major conference test on Arizona trip 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
The Cardinal men's basketball
team, 2-0 in Pacific 10 Conference
action, has never opened its Pac
-10 schedule with four consecutive
wins.
Some marks were never meant
to be broken.
Stanford travels south this
weekend to face Arizona State and
Arizona in one of its more chal
lenging road trips of the season.
The Sun Devils (5-5 overall, 0-1
in the Pac-10) have been ravaged
by injuries in the early going, field
ing a lineup of only seven scholar
ship players for most of December.
"I'd like to juggle the lineup but
we cannot," said Arizona State
coach Bill Frieder. "But we ain't
use the injury excuse in every
loss."
Soon, however, the Sun Devils
may no longer need the injury
excuse. Former Freshman All -
American Mario Bennett, who has
been tormented by knee problems
for the last two years, started his
second game of the season last Sat
urday against St. Louis. The big
man poured in 27 points, five
boards and five assists in the game
.. . but he is listed as questionable
on a day-by-day basis.
"The most important thing is
that Mario Bennett is healthy for
next season," said Frieder.
But Bennett isn't the Devils'
only problem. Serious injuries
have befallen Arizona State at
both guard positions and in the
middle.
The resulting lineup is a mish
mash of quality talent often play
ing out of position, with almost no

roster depth to back it up. Four
Sun Devils starters are averaging
over 35 minutes a game in playing
time. Not one Stanford player is at
that mark.
The Wildcats (12-1, 1-0), on the
other hand, possess one of the
strongest benches in the league —
10 players have seen action in at
least 12 games this year.
Arizona's No. 6 ranking is for
real. Their only loss of the year
was a 93-92 decision to No. 3 Ken

tucky in the finals of the Maui
Invitational. The Arizona squad
has recorded wins against nation
ally ranked New Orleans, Boston
College, Marquette and Michigan
— in fact, their 119-95 win over
the Wolverines was Michigan's
worst loss in over three years.
Arizona should present the
Cardinal with a difficult matchup
at almost every position. The Wild
cats' backcourt combo of Damon
Stoudamire and Khalid Reeves
averages 43 points per game, pre

senting challenging assignments
for Stanford guards Brevin Knight
and Dion Cross.
In the middle, Arizona sports a
bruiser in 6-foot-9, 256-pound
Joseph Blair, who has a 15-20
pound advantage over Cardinal
center Jim Morgan.
And then there's the home
court advantage. The Wildcats
have racked up a 100-2 record in
McHale Center over the last six
years, leading the Pac-10 in atten
dance each of those six years.
All of which adds up to the
toughest game of the season for
the Cardinal. Last year, the Wild
cats beat the Cardinal by 35 at
McHale.

Will the margin be closer this
season?
"We're an improving team,"
said Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery. "But [the Arizona game]
could be a very difficult matchup."
