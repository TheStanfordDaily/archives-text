# Welcome to the Farm, Steve
## Sailing coach brings Olympic experience 
### 
I searched and searched, but it
wasn't there. I looked by his
computer and on his clut
tered desk. I scanned his cubi
cle's walls, but no luck. I even
looked on the floor, by his
dog/mutt's water bowl, yet
remained disappointed.
I just could-n't find Steve
t> I

Bourdow s sil
ver medal.
Instead, his
walls were plas
tered with
Christmas
cards and sail
ing rankings.
Instead of mo
mentos from
his seven World
Sailing Cham-

pionships, he had Stanford sail
ing schedules. Instead of pictures
of Steve and Carl Ix'wLs, there
were pictures of Steve's nieces
and nephews (no wife; God forbid
this 28-year-old be shackled
down). A typically ignorant visi
tor would have no idea that he or
she was in the office of one of the
world's best sailors.
Of course, perhaps I bring a
biased perspective. Back at
home, my book shelves are
chock full of various trophies,
ribbons and awards, from my
sixth grade Putt-Putt trophy to
thousands of swimming, tennis
and golf (the country club
sports) participation ribbons.

Comparing my room to Steve's
leads one to the conclusion that
actual athletic success is inverse
ly proportional to awards dis
played.
Hut what Steve displays in
various piles around his office is
what he is most proud of. Not
the Olympic silver medall Not

the five NCAA
AU-American
awards. It's
the coaching
and teaching
upon which he
rests his lau
rels.
W e
chatted yes
terday, and
most of my

w. "V
questions were focused on his
sailing successes. He answered
them all, but was not overly
interested. The answers were
more of a read litany than a
bragging session about feats he
has every right to brag about.
On the other hand, he
became much more hospitable
when the conversation turned to
his coaching and teaching. In
fact, this first-year Stanford
coach seemed more intent on
telling me about his social stud
ies teaching certificate than his
multiple North American Sail
ing Championships. And when


Rob
Ross
asked which of his accomplish
ments he was most proud of, he
rambled on not about his
Barcelona excursion, but his hir
ing at Stanford.
"There are some kids on the
team who I used to coach on club
teams and clinics when they
were younger," he said. "And so
when they were looking for a
new coach here, they talked to
me sort of unofficially."
"My old students wanted me
to come and work."
And then he was off, chatting
about coaching philosophy and
strategy.
"I'm dealing with 30 people,
and they all have different goals.
I have to work to make the team
goals meet with each of theirs,
or there is no team. And the
hard fact is that they all have to
keep working toward the same
thing, even though only 10 of
them will actually get to go to
the NCAA National Champi
onships."
Stanford is blessed with a cor
nucopia of talented coaches on
staff. And, hidden behind names
like Bill Walsh and Tara Van

derveer hide the Kim Odens,
Sherri Poshumuses and Dante
Dettamantis â€” coaches who are
as successful (if not more so)
than these top names, but tend
to get ignored in the wealth.
Steve Bourdow is one of these
diamonds trapped among the
Crown Jewels.
Bourdow started sailing at
age 12 in Dayton, Ohio, of all
places. It soon became obvious
that he was a big stud, and so
when he was choosing colleges
he just glanced down the list of
top 25 sailing schools and chose
Tulane. In New Orleans he com
piled one of the most successful
collegiate sailing careers in
NCAA history, wining five Ail-
American awards. In high
school and in the various sailing
clubs he was a part of, Steve
sailed in the Laser (a single-per
son craft) class. In college he
raced dinghies, but continued
with Lasers in his spare time.
He became so adept with the
Laser that he was able to attend
the World Championships in
Australia at age 19.
In 1992 he went to the Amer
ican Olympic trials and qualified
to represent the U.S. in the Fly
ing Dutchman class, a two-per
son craft (in '92, the Olympics

didn't have a Laser class). There
he and his partner took home
the silver medal.
But Steve is not a big fan of
Olympic sailing.
"Once you start training for
the Olympics you need to get
sponsors," he said. "When other
people invest money in you,
you're committed. You can't just
pick up and leave whenever."
Being mobile is one of the
keys in Steve's life. The ability to
pack up and move at a moment's
notice. After his Olympic experi
ence, Steve broke off an engage
ment, because marriage would
hinder his mobility. And, regard
less of how much he enjoys
coaching and teaching, he recog
nizes that both put a damper on
his mobility.
"I'm committed to at least
three years [at Stanford 1," he
said. "After that, who knows? I'd
like to get out of the profession."
So take a sailing class. Go join
the sailing club. Meet Steve
Bourdow. Because he's probably
the best sailor you'll ever come
into contact with. And in three
years, he'll be off again, taking
his AU-American awards, North
American Sailing Awards and
his Olympic silver medal with
him. If he can find them.
