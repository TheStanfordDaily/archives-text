# Welcome to the Farm, Steve
## Sailing coach brings Olympic experience 
### 
I searched and searched, but it
wasn't there. I looked by his
computer and on his clut
tered desk. I scanned his cubi
cle's walls, but no luck. I even
looked on the floor, by his
dog/mutt's water bowl, yet
remained disappointed.
I just could-n't find Steve
t> I

Bourdow s sil
ver medal.
Instead, his
walls were plas
tered with
Christmas
cards and sail
ing rankings.
Instead of mo
mentos from
his seven World
Sailing Cham-

pionships, he had Stanford sail
ing schedules. Instead of pictures
of Steve and Carl Ix'wLs, there
were pictures of Steve's nieces
and nephews (no wife; God forbid
this 28-year-old be shackled
down). A typically ignorant visi
tor would have no idea that he or
she was in the office of one of the
world's best sailors.
Of course, perhaps I bring a
biased perspective. Back at
home, my book shelves are
chock full of various trophies,
ribbons and awards, from my
sixth grade Putt-Putt trophy to
thousands of swimming, tennis
and golf (the country club
sports) participation ribbons.

Comparing my room to Steve's
leads one to the conclusion that
actual athletic success is inverse
ly proportional to awards dis
played.
Hut what Steve displays in
various piles around his office is
what he is most proud of. Not
the Olympic silver medall Not

the five NCAA
AU-American
awards. It's
the coaching
and teaching
upon which he
rests his lau
rels.
W e
chatted yes
terday, and
most of my

w. "V
questions were focused on his
sailing successes. He answered
them all, but was not overly
interested. The answers were
more of a read litany than a
bragging session about feats he
has every right to brag about.
On the other hand, he
became much more hospitable
when the conversation turned to
his coaching and teaching. In
fact, this first-year Stanford
coach seemed more intent on
telling me about his social stud
ies teaching certificate than his
multiple North American Sail
ing Championships. And when
