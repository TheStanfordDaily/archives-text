## Men's volleyball heads to UCSB tourney to open season 
### Kathryn Yang Editorial staff 
With the goal of a national title on its mind, the
men's volleyball team will christen its 1994 cam
paign with the UC-Santa Barbara Invitational this
weekend.
Eight of the nation's top 10 volleyball squads,
including Stanford's 17-man team, will serve as the
highlights of this tournament, with No. 1 UCLA
favored to repeat its tournament title.
Standing in the Bruins' way will be the rest of
the top-five contenders, No. 2 BYU, No. 3 USC and
No. 5 Stanford. Missing from this Who's Who in
collegiate volleyball will be No. 4 Indiana-Purdue at
Fort Wayne.
However, if the Cardinal is to give UCLA a run
for its money over the weekend, it will have to find
ways to plug the holes left by six of Stanford's grad
uating seniors from last year.
Looking to step up and carry the brunt of that
responsibility this season will be several freshman
newcomers who will make their collegiate debuts in
Santa Barbara.
"We're nervous about how we're going to put it
all together on the court," said junior middle block
er Brian Garrett. "We have tremendous talent this
year — perhaps the most talent we've ever assem
bled — but it's all a matter of how you put it togeth
er."
At the forefront of the talented youth on this
ballclub is redshirt freshman Matt Fuerbringer,
who will look to stuff opponents from the demand
ing opposite hitter slot — a position on the court
that requires hitting from behind the 10-foot mark.
Joining him on the newcomers list is freshman
Mike Hoefer, a 6-foot-7 middle blocker from Gole
ta, Calif. Both Hoefer and fellow 6-foot-9 rookie
Brian Moore will be looking to solidify the net posi
tion.

With the influx of these young players, coach
Ruben Nieves will experiment with many lineups
and combinations at the tournament.
"There's a lot of competition for the starting
team," Garrett said. "Ruben will probably put sev
eral teams on the court during the tournament.
That's why we are bringing all 17 members of the
team."
No matter how the lineup gets shuffled over the
weekend though, the starting core on the Cardinal
squad will always remain constant.
Taking on the setting duties will be first team
All-American senior Canyon Ceman. The Man
hattan Beach, Cali., native garnered the National
Player of the Year award last season for his out
standing play.
Joining him as part of the senior leadership on
this team is Joe Burghardt, a true All-American
candidate at his familiar middle blocking position,
according to Nieves. However, this season, the
team might require Burghardt to solidify an out
side hitting position instead.
"The team may need him to switch positions in
order to pass the ball more," Nieves said.
Hitting opposite to Burghardt will be sophomore
Mike Lambert, as both veterans will look to control
the Cardinal passing game.
"Experienced passing and setting is all you need
for a good nucleus on this team," said junior swing
hitter Brian Fischer. "If you pass steady, have size
up the middle and get solid setting, everything else
will fall into place."
Everything falling into its place this weekend
means at least a top-five finish for the Cardinal,
who earned a fourth-place showing in last year's
Invite.
"This tournament is always a great chance to
see what everyone's got," Ceman said. "I expect us
to do well, and I hope our finish will at least match
our preseason ranking."
