Environmental laws need to be more
systematic and uniform, argued William
K. Reilly, former administrator of the En
vironmental Protection Agency, in a
speech yesterday that criticized the incon
sistency of present regulation.
Early in his speech in Kresge Auditori
um, Reilly stressed the large role risk

plays in today's environmental laws.
"Risk is at the core of environmental reg
ulation," he said.
Consequently, he emphasized the
value of "comparative risk assessment" in
the formation of environmental law and
lamented that often, truly high-risk dan
gers are ignored in favor of low-risk dan
gers that have been hyped up by publicity.
According to Reilly, popular under
standing and misconceptions about risk

"tell as a great deal about our fears and
anxieties." For example, large but infre
quent disasters such as oil spills are feared
more than frequent, smaller accidents.
With comparative risk assessment,
this unfortunate situation could be allevi
ated by making regulation more "system
atic, uniform, realistic and transparent,"
he said.
