# Former EPA head calls for greater consistency in environmental laws

Environmental laws need to be more
systematic and uniform, argued William
K. Reilly, former administrator of the En
vironmental Protection Agency, in a
speech yesterday that criticized the incon
sistency of present regulation.
Early in his speech in Kresge Auditori
um, Reilly stressed the large role risk

plays in today's environmental laws.
"Risk is at the core of environmental reg
ulation," he said.
Consequently, he emphasized the
value of "comparative risk assessment" in
the formation of environmental law and
lamented that often, truly high-risk dan
gers are ignored in favor of low-risk dan
gers that have been hyped up by publicity.
According to Reilly, popular under
standing and misconceptions about risk

"tell as a great deal about our fears and
anxieties." For example, large but infre
quent disasters such as oil spills are feared
more than frequent, smaller accidents.
With comparative risk assessment,
this unfortunate situation could be allevi
ated by making regulation more "system
atic, uniform, realistic and transparent,"
he said.
Also through this process,
greater attention could be paid to
funding for such things as safer
drinking water along the Mexican
border, the removal of pollutants
in confined bodies of water, con
trol of runoff in the Gulf of Mexico
and accelerated funding in San
Diego to handle Tijuana's sewage,
which pollutes many of San
Diego's beaches.
Reilly also criticized the actions
of Congress throughout the 1970s
and 1980s, saying that the "arse
nal of laws" constructed by

Congress were "typically conceived
in isolation, without reference to
other environmental laws."
Reilly said that Congress today
must ask how many people are
affected by environmental haz
ards and must clearly define clean
up standards to know how clean
"clean enough" is.
He urged Americans to ask
what they are getting from federal
clean-up programs, which leave
many technologies undiscovered
and many deadlines missed,
resulting in unfunded obligations
being unloaded on states, munici
palities and communities.
The key to constructing priori
ties in environmental regulation,
Reilly said, should rest on "the

firm foundation of science." This
is the "enduring legacy" which
lends environmental regulation
the "credibility" vital for public
approval.
Reilly stressed the importance
of current times, which represent
an "important juncture in histo
ry." Whereas the past found envi
ronmentalists on the defensive,
today they have the ability to "go
on the offensive â€” to create and
restore." This is instrumental in
accomplishing the "beckoning
goal ... of nature restored," he
said.
Reilly is currently the Arthur
W. and Frank E. Payne Visiting
Lecturer on the Global Communi
ty and its Challenges, in residence

at the Institute for International
Studies. He is also a former presi
dent of the World Wildlife Fund
and the Conservation Foundation.
Reilly is a strong advocate for
aggressive environmental laws,
innovative clean-up methods, the
integration of environmental and
ecological agendas at the EPA,
and the prevention of pollution
before its generation, according to
Dean of the School of Engineering
James Gibbons, who introduced
him yesterday.
Last night's lecture, "Risky
Business: Life, Death, Pollution
and the Global Environment,"
was the second in a series of lec
tures called "Greening the New
World Order."
