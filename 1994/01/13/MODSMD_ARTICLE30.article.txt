Patricia Lent has never traveled a conven
tional path in her dancing career.
As an Artist-in-Residence, Lent is teaching
modern dance technique during her five
week stint on campus. Lent had been a per
forming member of the Merce Cunningham
Company for the past 10 years when she de
cided to leave last October.
"1 felt that 10 years with one company was
enough and it was time to move on," Lent
confides. "Besides," she adds with a smile, "a
lot of my friends had left the company, and
with the extensive international touring, I
started to notice the age difference when trav
eling with dancers 10 or more years younger
than me. I didn't relate to things in the same
way."
In addition to performing, Lent had
served on the faculty of the Cunningham
Studio since 1988. When she left the compa
ny, she considered teaching as a new career,
accepting an offer to come to the Farm to test
the waters.
Within a couple of months, however, she
was offered a job with another New York
based dance company, The White Oak Pro
ject, a touring group directed by Barysh
nikov. "Just when I was ready to give up per
forming, 1 got right hack into it," Lent notes.
"But this opportunity was too good to pass
up. The company is made up of older
dancers (i.e., over 30), and I have the chance
to perform with dancers I have known for
years but have never worked with. Besides,
times off arc longer, the schedule is more se
cure, and we travel in style — I've heard that
Baryshnikov has a private plane for us." Lent
will join The White Oak Project on a U.S.
tour immediately following her Stanford
residency.
ut Lent was not always so secure in her
future as a dancer. "1 studied ballet
from an early age," she says, "hut when
I entered college I completely dropped out of
dance until my senior year." When her
teacher suggested that she consider dance as a
profession, she thought, at 22, that she was
"too old." Her teacher replied, "If you stick
with it, you will make it."
And make it she did. After graduating
summa cum laude in Political Theory from
the University of Virginia, Lent headed to
Boston to pursue dance. And, like virtually all
dancers, she took on a part-time job, in her
case as a secretary in an office at Harvard.
Lent jokes, "My father, who at the time wasn't
particularly fond of my decision to dance for
a living, used to tell his friends, 'Oh, my
daughter's at Harvard.'"
Boston wasn't a particularly ideal place to

dance, because of its limited opportunities,
but Lent got her start there, and after two
years she moved to New York. Within a year
of tutelage at the Cunningham Studio, she
was offered an apprenticeship, which swiftly
led to company-member status.
Despite her success, Lent does not deny
the hardships dancers must face. "Very few
people make money dancing," Lent admits.
"Dancers wait tables, do massage work, clean
houses (and) baby-sit in order to pay bills."

"But fortunately your col
leagues are in the same

boat," she adds. "If
you're asked out to

dinner with friends,

you don't have to
worry that you'll

be going to a
place where en

trees are $20;
you'll be

going to a
place where
a meal will
cost you $5.
The sup
port is very
powerful."
Her ex
perience as
a performer
lends
strength to
her teaching
skills, as she
is able to
teach actual

Cunningham
repertory and
relate personal
anecdotes about

the pieces. Cur
rently she is teach
ing in the Dance Divi
sion class "Dance Her

itage: Merce Cunning
ham," which includes lec

tures by faculty member Janict

Ross. Each year, the class highlights the tech
nique of a major choreographer, and past
subjects have included Isadora Duncan,
Katherine Dunham and Lester Horton.
In addition, Lent teaches a Saturday
morning intermediate technique class 9:30-
11 a.m. in the Roble Gym Dance Studio. The
classes cost $5 and are open to the public. She
is also conducting six presentation / discus
sion sessions each in a different dorm on
campus. In these sessions, Lcrit shows video
excerpts from Cunningham pieces, followed
by movement exercises "for non-dancers"
and an informal discussion.
The purpose of these sessions is to explore

Cunningham's work as a study of the body's
relationship to the world. Dance Division
faculty member Diane Frank, who will be
teaching the second half of the Cunningham
course, notes, "Too many people don't know
what to make of contemporary art; they
worry about it or they reject it. We hope these
informal sessions will explore the intellectual
and kinesthetic pleasure of serious artistic
work, which does not occur in a vacuum but
is a way of looking at the world."

Lent adds that, while there
are definite ways to explain
dance verbally, participa

tion is vital to under
standing the art form
"The increased in

terest in physical
fitness means that
people are into
their bodies.

rherefore,
they are

halfway there
to under

standing
movement.
And dance is
just an ex
tension of
movement."

It is a mis
take to think
of move
ment as lan
guage, Lent
argues.

"Dance com
municates, but
we don't know
the content. We

see intent, emo
tion, change of

quality, yet it is not
translatable into lan

guage. But if someone in
an audience feels a muscle

twitching in response to what
she sees, that is dance communi

eating."
s Lent taught excerpts of Cunningham
repertory last week, it became clear
that Cunningham's relationship to the
world is a complex one indeed. The tech
nique engages the spine in many unfamiliar
positions: it curves, twists, goes off center,
carrying the head and arms to sometimes
dizzying extremes. Add on many rapid direc
tional changes and it becomes obvious that
only the most intense concentration during
these exercises can forestall a missed step, a
wrong direction, or even falling on one's face.
Despite the difficulty, however, the work

reveals an exciting new and wide range ot
physical — and intellectual — possibilities
of a body's interaction with space and time.
In response to the students' grappling
with the strenuous combinations, Lent
shared a favorite anecdote with her class. Her
aunt, a novice dance spectator, had attended
a Cunningham concert in which Lent was
performing. During the intermission, the
aunt overheard two patrons complaining
that they didn't understand why the dancers
did not smile during the performance. Her
aunt responded, "I know what's going on.
The dancers are too busy to smile!"
"This is actually a common complaint,"
Lent adds. "In all my years of association with
Cunningham, I haven't come up with a better
reason." The Stanford dancers appeared to
agree as they worked through the numbers,
directions and steps, making every effort to
avoid colliding with one another while exe
cuting an intricate crossing movement pat
tern that utilized all of the available space.
While dancing has become her full-time
job, Lent involves herself in many
other interests. She traveled to Costa
Rica last spring on an Earthwatch-sponsored
trip, learning about the rain forests while
there. While she admits to being "reluctant to
turn another hobby into a career," Lent active
ly pursues rainforest preservation.
In addition, she has taken a recent interest
in birds. "Two years ago I was performing in
India and 1 saw this wild-looking bird. Later
at a party I tried to describe it to someone and
realized I didn't have the words; I had even
forgotten its call." She went the next day to a
bookstore and bought a guide, and soon af
terwards began identifying birds to all her
friends.
"I discovered that I never used to pay at
tention to birds; everything, in my mind, was
a sea gull or a sparrow or a cardinal. Now I
buy a bird guide in every new place I visit. It's
a hobby that travels very well."
For dancers, travel-ability is an important
aspect to any activity. Lent takes her environ
mental interests around the world with her.
Currently on her bedside table: Diane Acker
man's "The Natural History of the Senses,"
and Edwin Wilson's "Diversity of Life," a
study of the biodiversity of the planet.
And when she leaves the Farm to join
Baryshnikov's company, she will continue
her travels, encountering both new dance
forms and new species of birds. ■

Lent is holding four remaining dorm lounge
discussion / participation sessions. The hour
long events occur "after dinner" as follows: Jan.
IS in West Lagunita; lan. 19 in Lantana; Jan.
20 in Roble; and lan. 25 in Mirrielees. Wear
comfortable clothing.
