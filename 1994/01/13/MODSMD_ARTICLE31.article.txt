# Reconciling differences Ram's Head's 'One Acts'

Aind then there were two.
Ram's Head Theatrical Society's "Original
Winter One Acts" have always been known as
a workshop experience, one in which a stu
dent playwright has the opportunity to work
with a producer, director, crew and actors who
are also students of their respective trades.
Traditionally known as an experience of give
and take, of reconciling different viewpoints
and compromising, "One Acts" has been a
source of original campus entertainment
since its debut in the mid-'Bos.
This year's "One Acts" have followed the
traditional form, with writers, directors, pro
ducers, et al, working together to bring words
initially only transcribed on paper to the flesh
and blood of The Nitery stage. So this year,
there are original tales of apocalyptic events
and life in the City of Angels. One "Act" is a
leap to a bleak future entitled "Static." A sec
ond, "Tour of Hollywood," provides a realistic
look at six people just "trying to make it in
L.A.," according to one of the characters.
What won't be found on the Nitery stage is
a drama about Chinese-American family val
ues. Sometimes the give and take of the work
shop experience proves too much and, in the
case of "Yi-Chin"creative differences" ended
the experience a few days before its official
performances.
What initially brought these three funda
mentally extreme works together is the com
mon goal of each play's cast and crew — - creat
ing an original piece of art. While that goal has
not bound the three together through the
opening night, "One Acts" executive producer
Cassandra Thomas said she feels the other two
plays are "solid" enough to stand on their own
feet.
"It's unfortunate that 'Yi-Chin' had to be
pulled, but that's what we had to do. But the
other two plays are still strong and we hope
that people come to see them," Thomas con
tinued. "At this point, there's no looking back.
It was a decision that had to be made."
Thomas would not specify the reasons be

hind the decision not to perform "Yi-Chin"
beyond her initial explanation of "creative dif
ferences." However, during an interview con
ducted before the decision not to perform "Yi-
Chin," playwright 1-Jong Lin had expressed
dissatisfaction with the rewrites of the play as
well as the casting of non-Asian actors in roles
originally intended to be Asian or Asian-
American. Lin added that he and director
Danny Zeibert, a freshman, had opposing vi
sions of the play, especially regarding the con
clusion.
But such controversies have not marred the
workshop experience for those involved in the
productions of "Tour of Hollywood" and
"Static." Together, the casts and crews of those
productions have learned through coopera
tion and conflict, and in the end produced a
roller-coaster ride through time and original
theater.
First Stop! California Dreaming
"Tour of Hollywood" is an "eye-opening as
opposed to knee-slapping play," according to
freshman cast member Jeremy Desmon. "Ac
tually, it's nowhere near a knee-slapper," adds
Victor Wishna, another frosh.
Desmon plays one half of an elderly couple
which frequents Jake's Cafe, the setting of
"Tour." A waitress, a homeless person and a
gay man (portrayed by Wishna) add to the tra
ditional cafe milieu. While not in the slapstick
genre, "Tour" contains many funny moments
and intriguing, quirky characters.
Jordan Gelber, the freshman director, be
came interested in either directing or acting in
"Tour," particularly after reading the script. "1
felt that it was the most dynamic in terms of
character, dialogue, situation and so on." After
an interview with the producer he was asked
to direct but initially declined, changing his
mind only after playwright Jason Mayland
called and asked him to reconsider. "For me,"
he recalls, "that did the job. And ever since it's
just been a thrilling ride."
From a beginning director's standpoint,
the workshop experience offers amazing op
portunities to learn. Gelber remains positive

about the experience. "I've learned as much
from the cast as they've learned from me," he
candidly admits. One cast member suggested,
and then led, warm-ups before rehearsals —
allowing Gelber to experience a new and valu
able exercise.
Mayland, on the other hand, is a veteran of
Ram's Head entertainment. After producing
One Acts last year and serving as head writer
for Big Game Gaieties 1993, Mayland wrote
"Tour" while living in Los Angeles this past
summer. Although he claims the drama is not
drawn from direct experience, he did work as
a waiter, which may have influenced the con
text. The play, he claims, is based on a mind
set, "the state of mind I was in while living in
there."
The playwright said he sees L.A. as a rat
race where men and women struggle with
varying levels of success and expectation. "In
L.A., there are so many driven people — suc
cess is on everyone's minds."
As a part of their workshop experience, the
director and actors shared with Mayland their
feelings concerning the development of the
plot and its characters, which he took into ac
count with some revisions to the script. He
mentions the revisions nonchalantly; his ex
periences last year as producer (and mediator
of disputes) make him fully aware of the need
for compromise.
Second Stopi After the Klller~Bees
"Static," the second play, occurs after an
undefined apocalyptic event (a phrase which
is normally taken to mean a nuclear war, but in
this case — the director suggests — was possi
bly a massive attack of killer bees). As an
upper-class director, junior Angel Foster leads
an older and more cosmopolitan cast than
that of "Static" 's companion play. The cast is
an international cadre, with actors from the
Netherlands, South Africa and Texas.
On the Farm, Foster has worked in the past
in dorm theater and as co-director of "Sex in
the '905," a freshman Orientation program
consisting of 13 vignettes. After these experi
ences, Foster said she appreciates the organi
zation and resources which Ram's Head sup
plies. "It's nice to work in a show," she admits,
"with a substantial budget."
She, along with those involved in "Tour,"
enjoyed working in the cooperative workshop
atmosphere. Foster admits that the opportu
nity to interpret someone's writing and then
refer back to that person and gain their input
offers a new experience as well as a new di
mension to her work as a director.
Foster prefers not to reveal much about
"Static." It is approximately half an hour long,
and any synopsis, she feels, would probably di -
vulge too much. One of the hardest aspects of
the production, she does admit, was teaching
two of the three characters to play the har
monica, since neither she nor the writer, Ross
McCall, plays. They scoured their dorms and
eventually found an instructor — any har
monica players in the audience can judge for
themselves the level of the instructor's success.

Like its companion piece, "Static" was also
changed slightly from the original version,
mainly, according to Foster, in order to lighten
its mood while still maintaining a grip on the
audience's attention.
Third Stopt The Melting Pot
Only in the final week before the produc
tion did the three proposed plays finally come
together to rehearse as one unit. But still, indi
vidual concerns seemed to be foremost in
some of the minds of the cast and crew. Sched
ules were flip-flopped as new conflicts arose
and were resolved as opening night looms
near. And in the end, only two plays will haunt
the Nitery's stage.
Thomas, a sophomore, is responsible for
organizing the "One Acts" 's distinct casts,
with their three directors, into one evening of
entertainment. This is Thomas' first major
production, after beginning as a crew mem
ber in the spring musical "West Side Story"
last year. She claims that one of her goals for
the production was to get new, younger peo
ple involved. A look at the program — which
includes a freshman director, as well as nu
merous cast and crew members in their first
two years on the Farm — is proof of her suc
cess.
One of the most difficult aspects of
Thomas' job was mediating the writer / direc
tor relationship. "It's hard for a writer to let go
of their work sometimes," she explains, "and
the director has his own vision. All of the writ
ers and directors worked together to rewrite
the plays, and there were some pretty substan
tial changes."
The most substantial, of course, is the elim -
ination of "Yi-Chin" from the playbill — a de
cision that will shorten the running time of
"One Acts" and lower the prices (from $7 to $5
for students, $10 to $7 for the general popula
tion). It's also a decision which proves that
compromise has its limits and that hard work
by cast and crew does not always produce ben
eficial results.
With all of the drama that has occurred be
hind the scenes in the production of "One
Acts," it is interesting to note that all three of
the plays initially chosen were serious dramas
rather than comedies. Why?
Thomas claims that the two plays being
performed complement each other, and that
each possesses strong characters and situa
tions. But actors Desmon and Wishna found a
more basic reason:
"In comedy, it's all or nothing. It's either
funny or it's not. Basically, it is much more dif
ficult to write a good comedy than a touching
drama." ■

The "Original Winter One Acts" will be per
formed Jan. 13 through Jan. 16 in the Nitery,
Old Union. There will be a performance at 8
p.m. each evening and additional performances
at 3 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. Tickets are
$5 for students, $7 for the general public and are
available in White Plaza and at the door. For
more information, call 497-5600.
