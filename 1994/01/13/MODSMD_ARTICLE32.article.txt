# Nude emperor dressing Mike Leigh's 'Naked'
## Story by N'Gai Croal, Graphics by Jackie Lau 
### 
M ike Leigh is pissed.

The British director has been angry
before, searing audiences with such lauded
works as "Bleak Moments," "Meantime" and
the ironically titled "Life is Sweet." But noth
ing in his canon will prepare you for the blis
tering rage of his new Cannes prize-winning
film, "Naked," or the character who embod
ies every ounce of that rage perfectly.
Imagine a more well-adjusted Travis Bick
le ("Taxi Driver"). A more cunning Alex ("A
Clockwork Orange"). A more articulate Jake
LaMotta ("Raging Bull"). A more intellectu
al Lieutenant ("Bad Lieutenant"). Or a more
abrasive D-FENS ("Falling Down").

Heeere's
Johnny.

Flayed by
David Thewlis,

Leigh's alter-cgo is Catherine
MacKinnon's worst nightmare: a

woman-hating, verbally agile male
who abuses women with his mouth, then
abuses them with his dick. The film opens in
Manchester with Johnny having sex with a
woman standing up in an alley. She shouts at
him to get off of her — at best, it's extreme

ly rough sex; at worst, it's rape. I Ic steals a
car and heads for London, intending to
lie low at his ex-girlfriend Louise's (Les
ley Sharp).
Louise isn't there. Fortunately for
Johnny, her roommate Sophie is at

home. This gives him an opportunity to
spew invective and other body fluids, turning
what begins as consensual sex into a brutal,
virtually forced encounter. By now, it's clear
that his behavior isn't the presently fashion
able transgression of sado-masochism; the
more pain she feels, the more he seems to like
it. So when Sophie tells Johnny that she loves
him and begs for his attention, he grabs his
few belongings and hits the road.
The rest of the film details Johnny's de
scent into the chaos of modern-day London,
where he encounters waitresses, security
guards and fellow homeless people. But
they're just an excuse for Leigh's scabrous

one-man show; a series of stunning mono
logues on everything that's wrong with the
world. Thewlis' tour de force performance
as Johnny paints a frightening portrait of
alienation and millennial angst as reflected
in the fractured mirror of male misogyny
and paranoia. It's the end of the world as
he knows it — but he doesn't feel fine.
Unfortunately, the larger meaning
of "Naked" is largely opaque. The film
cries out to be seen as a metaphor, but for
what? Leigh wants the film to speak for
itself, but when a rapist-prophet is the
vehicle you've chosen for your message,
silence turns from gold to lead.
In the pursuit of understanding, I
show up to San Francisco's Montgomery-
Clift hotel to interview Mike Leigh, ac
companied by a Bay Area film critic. The
critic seems knowledgeable when we talk in
the waiting room, but he turns into an inept
fan once we enter Leigh's hotel suite.
Between the two men's Mamet-like

exchanges, I try to figure out whether
the emperor-director has on new
clothes, or is simply naked. (The critic
is in italics).

In 'Naked' it seems that the vision is grim
mer and darker. Does this signal a change for
you...
" .. no, it's just a different film ..
... or do you not agree that this is a darker
vision than you've ever...
"... I just think it's a different film. You
just don't go on making the same film all the
time."
Right. Hut a lot of your films seemed to have
a similar tone to me...
"... that may be hut..."
... a large part. ..
.. however, this film has quite a lot in
common with 'Bleak Moments,' 'Hard
Labour' and 'Meantime,' none of which
you've mentioned ..."
... do you think that's derived more from
that strain ...
.. it isn't derived from anything. In the
context of your question, it relates more to
Naked.' I make different kinds of films on
different scales. And I haven't even started
yet."
As long as "Naked" prevents us from sym
pathizing with Johnny, Leigh is able to main
tain the film's precarious balance. But the
character of Jeremy, a one-dimensional
demon yuppie who shares Johnny's pen
chant for non-consensual sexual violence,
tips the scales fatally. He seems to exist only
to displace our outrage, to make Johnny

more palatable to the viewer; Leigh said as
much in an interview with the French film
magazine Positif. Johnny may rape women,
Leigh seems to be saying, but at least he's
dead broke.
Leigh claims that he was misquoted. "Be
cause Johnny runs the risk of being charis
matic, and therefore possibly palatable," he
says, "therefore running the risk of letting the
issue of male aggression off the hook — Jere
my's there to make sure that the issue isn't let
off the hook."
Why a more three-dimensional character
like Johnny can't serve the same function es
capes me, but Ixigh just keeps going. I le adds
that he's not interested in forcing us to like
Johnny. "What's important is that by the end
of the film you have passed through a wide
range of feelings about him. You may respect
him or you may not. However it may be that
you like or respect him for other reasons and
in other contexts, in spite of the way he be
haves toward women.
"And that contradiction — that kind of
contradiction — is at the heart of the com
plexity of the character and indeed the com
plexity of the film. Does that make sense?"
Not really, but it's my partner's turn to ask
questions.
Doesn't Jeremy represent the thing that
Johnny could become ? The total. . .
"... could have been if he didn't..
... horrifying caricature of male aggres
sion?
"Oh, I don't know about caricature. Could
have been, if he didn't also have some kind of
intelligence and compassion as well..
... we don't see that in Jeremy, though. We
don't see...
".. .exactly. There is none of it in Jeremy at
all. Of course not. Jeremy is not in any way —
no way as intelligent, apart from not having
any compassion."
He's glib, though, in a ...
M ... yes ..
... in a way that Johnny is also glib. Both
men are verbally very fluent, but Jeremy seems
to represent a more frightening version of that
kind of aggressive power. They are both very as
saultive and combative toward women, but
Johnny's also desperate and hopeful. . .
"... yes..."
... so he's more tragic. Jeremy's a fascinat
ing character...
"... and a kind of guy that exists."
Some people seem to think that Jeremy is a
caricature of male aggression in a sort of post-
Thatcher context...
.. well I don't know about that..
... he's totally abusive...

"... it's nonsense. The trouble is, if you
put up on the screen people behaving like
people behave in a real but heightened way
because of the way some people are — I
mean, 1 know a couple of guys exactly like
that. I'm sure you do, somewhere. Do you?"
Favoring art over psychology, Leigh
doesn't have much of an explanation for
Johnny's misanthropic behavior. "To begin
with, here's a guy who is plainly frustratedby
the inadequacy of things. His head is bursting
with ideas and things that he cares about.
Frustrated by other people's lack of ability to
communicate. Frustrated by the ... imper
fection of his — not of his situation, but the
world's situation. An outsider who is railing
at everything.
"He's not a happy guy. It is a film about
waste, the waste of potential, the waste of tal
ent. This guy's got a mind on him that's going
to waste. I le's a guy that at school, they would
have only seen as a troublemaker and no sin
gle teacher ever would have thought how to
stimulate or help him. So as a result, he's an
outsider and he sits around and . . . reads.
He's self-educated — he's actually very edu
cated in some respects, although it's a disor
ganized hodgepodge of education... ."
Sadly, this frustration and wasted talent
acts itself out largely — as in such diverse
films as "Silence of the Lambs" and "Short
Cuts" — upon the bodies of women. And
even more disconcerting is the degree to
which Leigh identifies with the film.
I he film is an expression about how I
feel. Theresa certain kind of anger and frus
tration and fear — I'm trying to make a film
about the chaos of now. It is apocalyptic. It's
a film for the end of the century, without
being too pompous about it. It's a film that's
motivated by a genuine fear of — metaphor
ically — of what we call the end of the world,
and certainly, if not the end of the world,
there's a fear of how the future and the not
too-distant future is going to be.
"You're quite young. In 30 years' time,
when you're my age, I think it's going to be a

difficult world. If one thinks back to the '60s,
it was the time when the whole bullshit was
being thrown out and the future was finally
going to make sense. From the vantage
point of the '60s, if we looked forward to
1993, it would have been inconceivable that
the world could be such a mess. And it
would have been quite inconceivable that
one could want or need to make a film like
'Naked.' "
Well do you know what your next project's
gonna be?

"I'm not going to talk about that."
Not at liberty, huh?
" Pardon?"
Not at liberty to say. ..
". .. apart from everything else I haven't
got the money yet, and I can't really think
straight 'til I've got some money."
Leigh doesn't acknowledge any specific
influences, but he does

have an eerie tail of co
incidence. "| David
Thewlis and I]

shot a bit of
footage of him
just walking
about in book
shops. And sud
denly, there was
a copy of 'A
Clockwork Or

ange' in the window.
We thought, 'God,'
and we both felt

this in our
bones,

there
is a
sort
of
res-

onance there. But it hadn't occurred to us."
His film has more in common with the
disconnectedness of two '90s U. S. films. The
first is "Short Cuts," Robert Altman's cele
t brated portrait of apocalypse in America. "I
always have a very strong sense of rapport
with Altman. I saw 'Short Cuts' the other day
in New York and I think it's a great film. His
film has been called, as has mine, misogynist.
That's absolutely ludicrous and I wouldn't

mind taking a few heads as a result." Fie
laughs. "I absolutely resonate with him."

The second film is Quentin Tarantino's
ultra-nihilistic "Reservoir Dogs." Leigh
agrees with me, but only to a point, "there
are some aspects of 'Reservoir Dogs' —
which is not a film I would immediately
identify with — I can see a kind of similar-

ity, perhaps. Although I find for me there is
more hope in my film, that it's in no way as
arid in its viewpoint."

Like his American counter
parts, Leigh's vision of a

London besieged by
Johnny's slacker-

from-hell delib
erately excludes
people of color.
"When I was get
ting together

and casting ac
tors I decided
after much de
bate that I
would deliber
ately not have
i any black or

Asian charac
ters."
But it's
not for the
reasons you
might think.
"I knew that
> what I was

going to in
vestigate
were as
pects of sex-

' ism and
male-female
relations. And
I did not want

there to be a risk
of sexual roles and

issues crossing wires

with and being misun
derstood for being racial,
and therefore for that reason
I decided that there would
be no black or Asian charac-

ters. That's it. You may or may not agree with
it, but that's up to you."
How one can engage the apocalypse that
Britain faces without addressing the issue of
race is beyond me, but like the Talking Heads,
Mike Leigh and "Naked" have long since
stopped making sense. Still, he and Superfan
seem to be having a grand old time.
How do the British critical establishment
and popular audiences look at your films? Do
they see you as a mainstream director, 0r...
.. no, not really, although it's very pop
ular. Some of the press have extremely posi
tively supported it. But some of the press are
extremely negative, especially about 'Naked,'
and..."
You've really hit a nerve with this, it sounds
like...
"... yeah. Absolutely. Of course, there are
sort of strange things happening, that could
only happen in England. If you win a couple
of prizes like we did, at Cannes, immediately,
there is a certain part of the press that auto
matically see it as their duty to put the boot in
and be negative about it..."
.. . oh, n0...
"... this is an English sort of..
... n0...
"... yeah, it happens all the time ..
... I was gonna say just the opposite...
"... no. Absolutely not. Would that that
were the case. That's what happens, and any
one would say the same thing — it's an Eng
lish syndrome. 1 don't know what it's about,
really. I think it's partly a fear of seriousness,
of commitment and ideology and ideas in
this particular context. It's had a very positive
response in France, in Scandinavia, in Aus
tralia, in Germany ..."
... Italy...
"... and America, so far mostly. Here has
been exceptional so far. I'm still waiting for
both of you to write about it."
I'm really excited about this film.
"Well tell them to come see it."
I can't share in Mr. Film Critic's unquali
fied rave; the film is far too flawed for that,
particularly the extent to which 1-eigh in
dulges johnny. But like the similarly flawed
"Bad Lieutenant," the grungy abrasiveness of
"Naked" helps it get under our skin far more
effectively than the TV-movie antics of
"Short Cuts." You may not like it, but you
won't be able to shake it, either. The emperor
may be naked, but he's wearing one hell of a
fig leaf. ■

"Naked" opens in San Francisco Jan. 28. It will
open in Palo Alto sometime in February.

spew invective and other body fluids, turning
what begins as consensual sex into a brutal,
virtually forced encounter. By now, it's clear
that his behavior isn't the presently fashion
able transgression of sado-masochism; the
more pain she feels, the more he seems to like
it. So when Sophie tells Johnny that she loves
him and begs for his attention, he grabs his
few belongings and hits the road.
The rest of the film details Johnny's de
scent into the chaos of modern-day London,
where he encounters waitresses, security
guards and fellow homeless people. But
they're just an excuse for Leigh's scabrous

one-man show; a series of stunning mono
logues on everything that's wrong with the
world. Thewlis' tour de force performance
as Johnny paints a frightening portrait of
alienation and millennial angst as reflected
in the fractured mirror of male misogyny
and paranoia. It's the end of the world as
he knows it — but he doesn't feel fine.
Unfortunately, the larger meaning
of "Naked" is largely opaque. The film
cries out to be seen as a metaphor, but for
what? Leigh wants the film to speak for
itself, but when a rapist-prophet is the
vehicle you've chosen for your message,
silence turns from gold to lead.
In the pursuit of understanding, I
show up to San Francisco's Montgomery-
Clift hotel to interview Mike Leigh, ac
companied by a Bay Area film critic. The
critic seems knowledgeable when we talk in
the waiting room, but he turns into an inept
fan once we enter Leigh's hotel suite.
Between the two men's Mamet-like

exchanges, I try to figure out whether
the emperor-director has on new
clothes, or is simply naked. (The critic
is in italics).

In 'Naked' it seems that the vision is grim
mer and darker. Does this signal a change for
you...
" .. no, it's just a different film ..
... or do you not agree that this is a darker
vision than you've ever...
"... I just think it's a different film. You
just don't go on making the same film all the
time."
Right. Hut a lot of your films seemed to have
a similar tone to me...
"... that may be hut..."
... a large part. ..
.. however, this film has quite a lot in
common with 'Bleak Moments,' 'Hard
Labour' and 'Meantime,' none of which
you've mentioned ..."
... do you think that's derived more from
that strain ...
.. it isn't derived from anything. In the
context of your question, it relates more to
Naked.' I make different kinds of films on
different scales. And I haven't even started
yet."
As long as "Naked" prevents us from sym
pathizing with Johnny, Leigh is able to main
tain the film's precarious balance. But the
character of Jeremy, a one-dimensional
demon yuppie who shares Johnny's pen
chant for non-consensual sexual violence,
tips the scales fatally. He seems to exist only
to displace our outrage, to make Johnny

more palatable to the viewer; Leigh said as
much in an interview with the French film
magazine Positif. Johnny may rape women,
Leigh seems to be saying, but at least he's
dead broke.
Leigh claims that he was misquoted. "Be
cause Johnny runs the risk of being charis
matic, and therefore possibly palatable," he
says, "therefore running the risk of letting the
issue of male aggression off the hook — Jere
my's there to make sure that the issue isn't let
off the hook."
Why a more three-dimensional character
like Johnny can't serve the same function es
capes me, but Ixigh just keeps going. I le adds
that he's not interested in forcing us to like
Johnny. "What's important is that by the end
of the film you have passed through a wide
range of feelings about him. You may respect
him or you may not. However it may be that
you like or respect him for other reasons and
in other contexts, in spite of the way he be
haves toward women.
"And that contradiction — that kind of
contradiction — is at the heart of the com
plexity of the character and indeed the com
plexity of the film. Does that make sense?"
Not really, but it's my partner's turn to ask
questions.
Doesn't Jeremy represent the thing that
Johnny could become ? The total. . .
"... could have been if he didn't..
... horrifying caricature of male aggres
sion?
"Oh, I don't know about caricature. Could
have been, if he didn't also have some kind of
intelligence and compassion as well..
... we don't see that in Jeremy, though. We
don't see...
".. .exactly. There is none of it in Jeremy at
all. Of course not. Jeremy is not in any way —
no way as intelligent, apart from not having
any compassion."
He's glib, though, in a ...
M ... yes ..
... in a way that Johnny is also glib. Both
men are verbally very fluent, but Jeremy seems
to represent a more frightening version of that
kind of aggressive power. They are both very as
saultive and combative toward women, but
Johnny's also desperate and hopeful. . .
"... yes..."
... so he's more tragic. Jeremy's a fascinat
ing character...
"... and a kind of guy that exists."
Some people seem to think that Jeremy is a
caricature of male aggression in a sort of post-
Thatcher context...
.. well I don't know about that..
... he's totally abusive...

"... it's nonsense. The trouble is, if you
put up on the screen people behaving like
people behave in a real but heightened way
because of the way some people are — I
mean, 1 know a couple of guys exactly like
that. I'm sure you do, somewhere. Do you?"
Favoring art over psychology, Leigh
doesn't have much of an explanation for
Johnny's misanthropic behavior. "To begin
with, here's a guy who is plainly frustratedby
the inadequacy of things. His head is bursting
with ideas and things that he cares about.
Frustrated by other people's lack of ability to
communicate. Frustrated by the ... imper
fection of his — not of his situation, but the
world's situation. An outsider who is railing
at everything.
"He's not a happy guy. It is a film about
waste, the waste of potential, the waste of tal
ent. This guy's got a mind on him that's going
to waste. I le's a guy that at school, they would
have only seen as a troublemaker and no sin
gle teacher ever would have thought how to
stimulate or help him. So as a result, he's an
outsider and he sits around and . . . reads.
He's self-educated — he's actually very edu
cated in some respects, although it's a disor
ganized hodgepodge of education... ."
Sadly, this frustration and wasted talent
acts itself out largely — as in such diverse
films as "Silence of the Lambs" and "Short
Cuts" — upon the bodies of women. And
even more disconcerting is the degree to
which Leigh identifies with the film.
I he film is an expression about how I
feel. Theresa certain kind of anger and frus
tration and fear — I'm trying to make a film
about the chaos of now. It is apocalyptic. It's
a film for the end of the century, without
being too pompous about it. It's a film that's
motivated by a genuine fear of — metaphor
ically — of what we call the end of the world,
and certainly, if not the end of the world,
there's a fear of how the future and the not
too-distant future is going to be.
"You're quite young. In 30 years' time,
when you're my age, I think it's going to be a

difficult world. If one thinks back to the '60s,
it was the time when the whole bullshit was
being thrown out and the future was finally
going to make sense. From the vantage
point of the '60s, if we looked forward to
1993, it would have been inconceivable that
the world could be such a mess. And it
would have been quite inconceivable that
one could want or need to make a film like
'Naked.' "
Well do you know what your next project's
gonna be?

"I'm not going to talk about that."
Not at liberty, huh?
" Pardon?"
Not at liberty to say. ..
". .. apart from everything else I haven't
got the money yet, and I can't really think
straight 'til I've got some money."
Leigh doesn't acknowledge any specific
influences, but he does

have an eerie tail of co
incidence. "| David
Thewlis and I]

shot a bit of
footage of him
just walking
about in book
shops. And sud
denly, there was
a copy of 'A
Clockwork Or

ange' in the window.
We thought, 'God,'
and we both felt

this in our
bones,

there
is a
sort
of
res-

onance there. But it hadn't occurred to us."
His film has more in common with the
disconnectedness of two '90s U. S. films. The
first is "Short Cuts," Robert Altman's cele
t brated portrait of apocalypse in America. "I
always have a very strong sense of rapport
with Altman. I saw 'Short Cuts' the other day
in New York and I think it's a great film. His
film has been called, as has mine, misogynist.
That's absolutely ludicrous and I wouldn't

mind taking a few heads as a result." Fie
laughs. "I absolutely resonate with him."

The second film is Quentin Tarantino's
ultra-nihilistic "Reservoir Dogs." Leigh
agrees with me, but only to a point, "there
are some aspects of 'Reservoir Dogs' —
which is not a film I would immediately
identify with — I can see a kind of similar-

ity, perhaps. Although I find for me there is
more hope in my film, that it's in no way as
arid in its viewpoint."

Like his American counter
parts, Leigh's vision of a

London besieged by
Johnny's slacker-

from-hell delib
erately excludes
people of color.
"When I was get
ting together

and casting ac
tors I decided
after much de
bate that I
would deliber
ately not have
i any black or

Asian charac
ters."
But it's
not for the
reasons you
might think.
"I knew that
> what I was

going to in
vestigate
were as
pects of sex-

' ism and
male-female
relations. And
I did not want

there to be a risk
of sexual roles and

issues crossing wires

with and being misun
derstood for being racial,
and therefore for that reason
I decided that there would
be no black or Asian charac-

ters. That's it. You may or may not agree with
it, but that's up to you."
How one can engage the apocalypse that
Britain faces without addressing the issue of
race is beyond me, but like the Talking Heads,
Mike Leigh and "Naked" have long since
stopped making sense. Still, he and Superfan
seem to be having a grand old time.
How do the British critical establishment
and popular audiences look at your films? Do
they see you as a mainstream director, 0r...
.. no, not really, although it's very pop
ular. Some of the press have extremely posi
tively supported it. But some of the press are
extremely negative, especially about 'Naked,'
and..."
You've really hit a nerve with this, it sounds
like...
"... yeah. Absolutely. Of course, there are
sort of strange things happening, that could
only happen in England. If you win a couple
of prizes like we did, at Cannes, immediately,
there is a certain part of the press that auto
matically see it as their duty to put the boot in
and be negative about it..."
.. . oh, n0...
"... this is an English sort of..
... n0...
"... yeah, it happens all the time ..
... I was gonna say just the opposite...
"... no. Absolutely not. Would that that
were the case. That's what happens, and any
one would say the same thing — it's an Eng
lish syndrome. 1 don't know what it's about,
really. I think it's partly a fear of seriousness,
of commitment and ideology and ideas in
this particular context. It's had a very positive
response in France, in Scandinavia, in Aus
tralia, in Germany ..."
... Italy...
"... and America, so far mostly. Here has
been exceptional so far. I'm still waiting for
both of you to write about it."
I'm really excited about this film.
"Well tell them to come see it."
I can't share in Mr. Film Critic's unquali
fied rave; the film is far too flawed for that,
particularly the extent to which 1-eigh in
dulges johnny. But like the similarly flawed
"Bad Lieutenant," the grungy abrasiveness of
"Naked" helps it get under our skin far more
effectively than the TV-movie antics of
"Short Cuts." You may not like it, but you
won't be able to shake it, either. The emperor
may be naked, but he's wearing one hell of a
fig leaf. ■

"Naked" opens in San Francisco Jan. 28. It will
open in Palo Alto sometime in February.


M ike Leigh is pissed.

The British director has been angry
before, searing audiences with such lauded
works as "Bleak Moments," "Meantime" and
the ironically titled "Life is Sweet." But noth
ing in his canon will prepare you for the blis
tering rage of his new Cannes prize-winning
film, "Naked," or the character who embod
ies every ounce of that rage perfectly.
Imagine a more well-adjusted Travis Bick
le ("Taxi Driver"). A more cunning Alex ("A
Clockwork Orange"). A more articulate Jake
LaMotta ("Raging Bull"). A more intellectu
al Lieutenant ("Bad Lieutenant"). Or a more
abrasive D-FENS ("Falling Down").

Heeere's
Johnny.

Flayed by
David Thewlis,

Leigh's alter-cgo is Catherine
MacKinnon's worst nightmare: a

woman-hating, verbally agile male
who abuses women with his mouth, then
abuses them with his dick. The film opens in
Manchester with Johnny having sex with a
woman standing up in an alley. She shouts at
him to get off of her — at best, it's extreme

ly rough sex; at worst, it's rape. I Ic steals a
car and heads for London, intending to
lie low at his ex-girlfriend Louise's (Les
ley Sharp).
Louise isn't there. Fortunately for
Johnny, her roommate Sophie is at

home. This gives him an opportunity to
spew invective and other body fluids, turning
what begins as consensual sex into a brutal,
virtually forced encounter. By now, it's clear
that his behavior isn't the presently fashion
able transgression of sado-masochism; the
more pain she feels, the more he seems to like
it. So when Sophie tells Johnny that she loves
him and begs for his attention, he grabs his

critic seems knowledgeable when we talk in
the waiting room, but he turns into an inept
fan once we enter Leigh's hotel suite.
Between the two men's Mamet-like

exchanges, I try to figure out whether
the emperor-director has on new
clothes, or is simply naked. (The critic
is in italics).

In 'Naked' it seems that the vision is grim
mer and darker. Does this signal a change for
you...
" .. no, it's just a different film ..
... or do you not agree that this is a darker
vision than you've ever...
"... I just think it's a different film. You
just don't go on making the same film all the
time."
Right. Hut a lot of your films seemed to have
a similar tone to me...
"... that may be hut..."
... a large part. ..
.. however, this film has quite a lot in
common with 'Bleak Moments,' 'Hard
Labour' and 'Meantime,' none of which
you've mentioned ..."
... do you think that's derived more from
that strain ...
.. it isn't derived from anything. In the
context of your question, it relates more to
Naked.' I make different kinds of films on
different scales. And I haven't even started
yet."
As long as "Naked" prevents us from sym
pathizing with Johnny, Leigh is able to main
tain the film's precarious balance. But the
character of Jeremy, a one-dimensional
demon yuppie who shares Johnny's pen
chant for non-consensual sexual violence,
tips the scales fatally. He seems to exist only
to displace our outrage, to make Johnny

more palatable to the viewer; Leigh said as
much in an interview with the French film
magazine Positif. Johnny may rape women,
Leigh seems to be saying, but at least he's
dead broke.
Leigh claims that he was misquoted. "Be
cause Johnny runs the risk of being charis
matic, and therefore possibly palatable," he
says, "therefore running the risk of letting the
issue of male aggression off the hook — Jere
my's there to make sure that the issue isn't let
off the hook."
Why a more three-dimensional character
like Johnny can't serve the same function es
capes me, but Ixigh just keeps going. I le adds
that he's not interested in forcing us to like
Johnny. "What's important is that by the end
of the film you have passed through a wide
range of feelings about him. You may respect
him or you may not. However it may be that
you like or respect him for other reasons and
in other contexts, in spite of the way he be
haves toward women.
"And that contradiction — that kind of
contradiction — is at the heart of the com
plexity of the character and indeed the com
plexity of the film. Does that make sense?"
Not really, but it's my partner's turn to ask
questions.
Doesn't Jeremy represent the thing that
Johnny could become ? The total. . .
"... could have been if he didn't..
... horrifying caricature of male aggres
sion?
"Oh, I don't know about caricature. Could
have been, if he didn't also have some kind of
intelligence and compassion as well..
... we don't see that in Jeremy, though. We
don't see...
".. .exactly. There is none of it in Jeremy at
all. Of course not. Jeremy is not in any way —
no way as intelligent, apart from not having
any compassion."
He's glib, though, in a ...
M ... yes ..
... in a way that Johnny is also glib. Both
men are verbally very fluent, but Jeremy seems
to represent a more frightening version of that
kind of aggressive power. They are both very as
saultive and combative toward women, but
Johnny's also desperate and hopeful. . .
"... yes..."
... so he's more tragic. Jeremy's a fascinat
ing character...
"... and a kind of guy that exists."
Some people seem to think that Jeremy is a
caricature of male aggression in a sort of post-
Thatcher context...
.. well I don't know about that..
... he's totally abusive...

"... it's nonsense. The trouble is, if you
put up on the screen people behaving like
people behave in a real but heightened way
because of the way some people are — I
mean, 1 know a couple of guys exactly like
that. I'm sure you do, somewhere. Do you?"
Favoring art over psychology, Leigh
doesn't have much of an explanation for
Johnny's misanthropic behavior. "To begin
with, here's a guy who is plainly frustratedby
the inadequacy of things. His head is bursting
with ideas and things that he cares about.
Frustrated by other people's lack of ability to
communicate. Frustrated by the ... imper
fection of his — not of his situation, but the
world's situation. An outsider who is railing
at everything.
"He's not a happy guy. It is a film about
waste, the waste of potential, the waste of tal
ent. This guy's got a mind on him that's going
to waste. I le's a guy that at school, they would
have only seen as a troublemaker and no sin
gle teacher ever would have thought how to
stimulate or help him. So as a result, he's an
outsider and he sits around and . . . reads.
He's self-educated — he's actually very edu
cated in some respects, although it's a disor
ganized hodgepodge of education... ."
Sadly, this frustration and wasted talent
acts itself out largely — as in such diverse
films as "Silence of the Lambs" and "Short
Cuts" — upon the bodies of women. And
even more disconcerting is the degree to
which Leigh identifies with the film.
I he film is an expression about how I
feel. Theresa certain kind of anger and frus
tration and fear — I'm trying to make a film
about the chaos of now. It is apocalyptic. It's
a film for the end of the century, without
being too pompous about it. It's a film that's
motivated by a genuine fear of — metaphor
ically — of what we call the end of the world,
and certainly, if not the end of the world,
there's a fear of how the future and the not
too-distant future is going to be.
"You're quite young. In 30 years' time,
when you're my age, I think it's going to be a

difficult world. If one thinks back to the '60s,
it was the time when the whole bullshit was
being thrown out and the future was finally
going to make sense. From the vantage
point of the '60s, if we looked forward to
1993, it would have been inconceivable that
the world could be such a mess. And it
would have been quite inconceivable that
one could want or need to make a film like
'Naked.' "
Well do you know what your next project's
gonna be?

"I'm not going to talk about that."
Not at liberty, huh?
" Pardon?"
Not at liberty to say. ..
". .. apart from everything else I haven't
got the money yet, and I can't really think
straight 'til I've got some money."
Leigh doesn't acknowledge any specific
influences, but he does

have an eerie tail of co
incidence. "| David
Thewlis and I]

shot a bit of
footage of him
just walking
about in book
shops. And sud
denly, there was
a copy of 'A
Clockwork Or

ange' in the window.
We thought, 'God,'
and we both felt

this in our
bones,

there
is a
sort
of
res-

onance there. But it hadn't occurred to us."
His film has more in common with the
disconnectedness of two '90s U. S. films. The
first is "Short Cuts," Robert Altman's cele
t brated portrait of apocalypse in America. "I
always have a very strong sense of rapport
with Altman. I saw 'Short Cuts' the other day
in New York and I think it's a great film. His
film has been called, as has mine, misogynist.
That's absolutely ludicrous and I wouldn't

mind taking a few heads as a result." Fie
laughs. "I absolutely resonate with him."

The second film is Quentin Tarantino's
ultra-nihilistic "Reservoir Dogs." Leigh
agrees with me, but only to a point, "there
are some aspects of 'Reservoir Dogs' —
which is not a film I would immediately
identify with — I can see a kind of similar-

ity, perhaps. Although I find for me there is
more hope in my film, that it's in no way as
arid in its viewpoint."

Like his American counter
parts, Leigh's vision of a

London besieged by
Johnny's slacker-

from-hell delib
erately excludes
people of color.
"When I was get
ting together

and casting ac
tors I decided
after much de
bate that I
would deliber
ately not have
i any black or

Asian charac
ters."
But it's
not for the
reasons you
might think.
"I knew that
> what I was

going to in
vestigate
were as
pects of sex-

' ism and
male-female
relations. And
I did not want

there to be a risk
of sexual roles and

issues crossing wires

with and being misun
derstood for being racial,
and therefore for that reason
I decided that there would
be no black or Asian charac-

ters. That's it. You may or may not agree with
it, but that's up to you."
How one can engage the apocalypse that
Britain faces without addressing the issue of
race is beyond me, but like the Talking Heads,
Mike Leigh and "Naked" have long since
stopped making sense. Still, he and Superfan
seem to be having a grand old time.
How do the British critical establishment
and popular audiences look at your films? Do
they see you as a mainstream director, 0r...
.. no, not really, although it's very pop
ular. Some of the press have extremely posi
tively supported it. But some of the press are
extremely negative, especially about 'Naked,'
and..."
You've really hit a nerve with this, it sounds
like...
"... yeah. Absolutely. Of course, there are
sort of strange things happening, that could
only happen in England. If you win a couple
of prizes like we did, at Cannes, immediately,
there is a certain part of the press that auto
matically see it as their duty to put the boot in
and be negative about it..."
.. . oh, n0...
"... this is an English sort of..
... n0...
"... yeah, it happens all the time ..
... I was gonna say just the opposite...
"... no. Absolutely not. Would that that
were the case. That's what happens, and any
one would say the same thing — it's an Eng
lish syndrome. 1 don't know what it's about,
really. I think it's partly a fear of seriousness,
of commitment and ideology and ideas in
this particular context. It's had a very positive
response in France, in Scandinavia, in Aus
tralia, in Germany ..."
... Italy...
"... and America, so far mostly. Here has
been exceptional so far. I'm still waiting for
both of you to write about it."
I'm really excited about this film.
"Well tell them to come see it."
I can't share in Mr. Film Critic's unquali
fied rave; the film is far too flawed for that,
particularly the extent to which 1-eigh in
dulges johnny. But like the similarly flawed
"Bad Lieutenant," the grungy abrasiveness of
"Naked" helps it get under our skin far more
effectively than the TV-movie antics of
"Short Cuts." You may not like it, but you
won't be able to shake it, either. The emperor
may be naked, but he's wearing one hell of a
fig leaf. ■

"Naked" opens in San Francisco Jan. 28. It will
open in Palo Alto sometime in February.


M ike Leigh is pissed.

The British director has been angry
before, searing audiences with such lauded
works as "Bleak Moments," "Meantime" and
the ironically titled "Life is Sweet." But noth
ing in his canon will prepare you for the blis
tering rage of his new Cannes prize-winning
film, "Naked," or the character who embod
ies every ounce of that rage perfectly.
Imagine a more well-adjusted Travis Bick
le ("Taxi Driver"). A more cunning Alex ("A
Clockwork Orange"). A more articulate Jake
LaMotta ("Raging Bull"). A more intellectu
al Lieutenant ("Bad Lieutenant"). Or a more
abrasive D-FENS ("Falling Down").

Heeere's
Johnny.

Flayed by
David Thewlis,

Leigh's alter-cgo is Catherine
MacKinnon's worst nightmare: a

woman-hating, verbally agile male
who abuses women with his mouth, then
abuses them with his dick. The film opens in
Manchester with Johnny having sex with a
woman standing up in an alley. She shouts at
him to get off of her — at best, it's extreme

ly rough sex; at worst, it's rape. I Ic steals a
car and heads for London, intending to
lie low at his ex-girlfriend Louise's (Les
ley Sharp).
Louise isn't there. Fortunately for
Johnny, her roommate Sophie is at

home. This gives him an opportunity to
spew invective and other body fluids, turning
what begins as consensual sex into a brutal,
virtually forced encounter. By now, it's clear
that his behavior isn't the presently fashion
able transgression of sado-masochism; the
more pain she feels, the more he seems to like
it. So when Sophie tells Johnny that she loves
him and begs for his attention, he grabs his
few belongings and hits the road.
The rest of the film details Johnny's de
scent into the chaos of modern-day London,
where he encounters waitresses, security
guards and fellow homeless people. But
they're just an excuse for Leigh's scabrous

one-man show; a series of stunning mono
logues on everything that's wrong with the
world. Thewlis' tour de force performance
as Johnny paints a frightening portrait of
alienation and millennial angst as reflected
in the fractured mirror of male misogyny
and paranoia. It's the end of the world as
he knows it — but he doesn't feel fine.
Unfortunately, the larger meaning
of "Naked" is largely opaque. The film
cries out to be seen as a metaphor, but for
what? Leigh wants the film to speak for
itself, but when a rapist-prophet is the
vehicle you've chosen for your message,
silence turns from gold to lead.
In the pursuit of understanding, I
show up to San Francisco's Montgomery-
Clift hotel to interview Mike Leigh, ac
companied by a Bay Area film critic. The
critic seems knowledgeable when we talk in
the waiting room, but he turns into an inept

demon yuppie who shares Johnny's pen
chant for non-consensual sexual violence,
tips the scales fatally. He seems to exist only
to displace our outrage, to make Johnny

more palatable to the viewer; Leigh said as
much in an interview with the French film
magazine Positif. Johnny may rape women,
Leigh seems to be saying, but at least he's
dead broke.
Leigh claims that he was misquoted. "Be
cause Johnny runs the risk of being charis
matic, and therefore possibly palatable," he
says, "therefore running the risk of letting the
issue of male aggression off the hook — Jere
my's there to make sure that the issue isn't let
off the hook."
Why a more three-dimensional character
like Johnny can't serve the same function es
capes me, but Ixigh just keeps going. I le adds
that he's not interested in forcing us to like
Johnny. "What's important is that by the end
of the film you have passed through a wide
range of feelings about him. You may respect
him or you may not. However it may be that
you like or respect him for other reasons and
in other contexts, in spite of the way he be
haves toward women.
"And that contradiction — that kind of
contradiction — is at the heart of the com
plexity of the character and indeed the com
plexity of the film. Does that make sense?"
Not really, but it's my partner's turn to ask
questions.
Doesn't Jeremy represent the thing that
Johnny could become ? The total. . .
"... could have been if he didn't..
... horrifying caricature of male aggres
sion?
"Oh, I don't know about caricature. Could
have been, if he didn't also have some kind of
intelligence and compassion as well..
... we don't see that in Jeremy, though. We
don't see...
".. .exactly. There is none of it in Jeremy at
all. Of course not. Jeremy is not in any way —
no way as intelligent, apart from not having
any compassion."
He's glib, though, in a ...
M ... yes ..
... in a way that Johnny is also glib. Both
men are verbally very fluent, but Jeremy seems
to represent a more frightening version of that
kind of aggressive power. They are both very as
saultive and combative toward women, but
Johnny's also desperate and hopeful. . .
"... yes..."
... so he's more tragic. Jeremy's a fascinat
ing character...
"... and a kind of guy that exists."
Some people seem to think that Jeremy is a
caricature of male aggression in a sort of post-
Thatcher context...
.. well I don't know about that..
... he's totally abusive...

"... it's nonsense. The trouble is, if you
put up on the screen people behaving like
people behave in a real but heightened way
because of the way some people are — I
mean, 1 know a couple of guys exactly like
that. I'm sure you do, somewhere. Do you?"
Favoring art over psychology, Leigh
doesn't have much of an explanation for
Johnny's misanthropic behavior. "To begin
with, here's a guy who is plainly frustratedby
the inadequacy of things. His head is bursting
with ideas and things that he cares about.
Frustrated by other people's lack of ability to
communicate. Frustrated by the ... imper
fection of his — not of his situation, but the
world's situation. An outsider who is railing
at everything.
"He's not a happy guy. It is a film about
waste, the waste of potential, the waste of tal
ent. This guy's got a mind on him that's going
to waste. I le's a guy that at school, they would
have only seen as a troublemaker and no sin
gle teacher ever would have thought how to
stimulate or help him. So as a result, he's an
outsider and he sits around and . . . reads.
He's self-educated — he's actually very edu
cated in some respects, although it's a disor
ganized hodgepodge of education... ."
Sadly, this frustration and wasted talent
acts itself out largely — as in such diverse
films as "Silence of the Lambs" and "Short
Cuts" — upon the bodies of women. And
even more disconcerting is the degree to
which Leigh identifies with the film.
I he film is an expression about how I
feel. Theresa certain kind of anger and frus
tration and fear — I'm trying to make a film
about the chaos of now. It is apocalyptic. It's
a film for the end of the century, without
being too pompous about it. It's a film that's
motivated by a genuine fear of — metaphor
ically — of what we call the end of the world,
and certainly, if not the end of the world,
there's a fear of how the future and the not
too-distant future is going to be.
"You're quite young. In 30 years' time,
when you're my age, I think it's going to be a

difficult world. If one thinks back to the '60s,
it was the time when the whole bullshit was
being thrown out and the future was finally
going to make sense. From the vantage
point of the '60s, if we looked forward to
1993, it would have been inconceivable that
the world could be such a mess. And it
would have been quite inconceivable that
one could want or need to make a film like
'Naked.' "
Well do you know what your next project's
gonna be?

"I'm not going to talk about that."
Not at liberty, huh?
" Pardon?"
Not at liberty to say. ..
". .. apart from everything else I haven't
got the money yet, and I can't really think
straight 'til I've got some money."
Leigh doesn't acknowledge any specific
influences, but he does

have an eerie tail of co
incidence. "| David
Thewlis and I]

shot a bit of
footage of him
just walking
about in book
shops. And sud
denly, there was
a copy of 'A
Clockwork Or

ange' in the window.
We thought, 'God,'
and we both felt

this in our
bones,

there
is a
sort
of
res-

onance there. But it hadn't occurred to us."
His film has more in common with the
disconnectedness of two '90s U. S. films. The
first is "Short Cuts," Robert Altman's cele
t brated portrait of apocalypse in America. "I
always have a very strong sense of rapport
with Altman. I saw 'Short Cuts' the other day
in New York and I think it's a great film. His
film has been called, as has mine, misogynist.
That's absolutely ludicrous and I wouldn't

mind taking a few heads as a result." Fie
laughs. "I absolutely resonate with him."

The second film is Quentin Tarantino's
ultra-nihilistic "Reservoir Dogs." Leigh
agrees with me, but only to a point, "there
are some aspects of 'Reservoir Dogs' —
which is not a film I would immediately
identify with — I can see a kind of similar-

ity, perhaps. Although I find for me there is
more hope in my film, that it's in no way as
arid in its viewpoint."

Like his American counter
parts, Leigh's vision of a

London besieged by
Johnny's slacker-

from-hell delib
erately excludes
people of color.
"When I was get
ting together

and casting ac
tors I decided
after much de
bate that I
would deliber
ately not have
i any black or

Asian charac
ters."
But it's
not for the
reasons you
might think.
"I knew that
> what I was

going to in
vestigate
were as
pects of sex-

' ism and
male-female
relations. And
I did not want

there to be a risk
of sexual roles and

issues crossing wires

with and being misun
derstood for being racial,
and therefore for that reason
I decided that there would
be no black or Asian charac-

ters. That's it. You may or may not agree with
it, but that's up to you."
How one can engage the apocalypse that
Britain faces without addressing the issue of
race is beyond me, but like the Talking Heads,
Mike Leigh and "Naked" have long since
stopped making sense. Still, he and Superfan
seem to be having a grand old time.
How do the British critical establishment
and popular audiences look at your films? Do
they see you as a mainstream director, 0r...
.. no, not really, although it's very pop
ular. Some of the press have extremely posi
tively supported it. But some of the press are
extremely negative, especially about 'Naked,'
and..."
You've really hit a nerve with this, it sounds
like...
"... yeah. Absolutely. Of course, there are
sort of strange things happening, that could
only happen in England. If you win a couple
of prizes like we did, at Cannes, immediately,
there is a certain part of the press that auto
matically see it as their duty to put the boot in
and be negative about it..."
.. . oh, n0...
"... this is an English sort of..
... n0...
"... yeah, it happens all the time ..
... I was gonna say just the opposite...
"... no. Absolutely not. Would that that
were the case. That's what happens, and any
one would say the same thing — it's an Eng
lish syndrome. 1 don't know what it's about,
really. I think it's partly a fear of seriousness,
of commitment and ideology and ideas in
this particular context. It's had a very positive
response in France, in Scandinavia, in Aus
tralia, in Germany ..."
... Italy...
"... and America, so far mostly. Here has
been exceptional so far. I'm still waiting for
both of you to write about it."
I'm really excited about this film.
"Well tell them to come see it."
I can't share in Mr. Film Critic's unquali
fied rave; the film is far too flawed for that,
particularly the extent to which 1-eigh in
dulges johnny. But like the similarly flawed
"Bad Lieutenant," the grungy abrasiveness of
"Naked" helps it get under our skin far more
effectively than the TV-movie antics of
"Short Cuts." You may not like it, but you
won't be able to shake it, either. The emperor
may be naked, but he's wearing one hell of a
fig leaf. ■

"Naked" opens in San Francisco Jan. 28. It will
open in Palo Alto sometime in February.
