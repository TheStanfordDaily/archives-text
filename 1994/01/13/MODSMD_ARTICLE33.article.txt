## Demme's 'Philadelphia' lobbies for fairness and understanding 
### 
For those who rail their ugly voices against
the allegedly PC-stricken "Philadelphia," go
to hell. It seems to me ridiculous that pock
ets of the queer community at large have
elected to chastise Tom Hanks' character — a
gay man with AIDS — for having the kind of
supportive family environment that some of
us are lucky enough to have, and the rest of us
hope for.
Besides, a movie with a gay protagonist

should not have to show him performing
auto-fellatio on-screen to depict his sexual
ity; indeed, the scene where Tom Hanks
slow-dances with Antonio Banderas sent
this reviewer's pulse racing far more furi
ously than any gay erotica has for a very long
time.
Thank goodness director Jonathan
Demme, who was publicly criticized for
negatively stereotyping cross-dressers in

"The Silence of the Lambs," did not attempt
a reactionary piece contrived to celebrate
queerness with $25 million from Holly
wood.
Rather, the heterosexual Demme and the
openly gay screenwriter Ron Nyswancr have
gone ahead and made better use of their
unique partnership. In some ways, their
working relationship can be extrapolated to
their story's premise: a homosexual lawyer
Andrew Beckett (Hanks) hires a homopho
bic, straight attorney, Joe Miller (Denzel
Washington), in an effort to sue his law firm
for wrongfully dismissing him after learning
that he had AIDS.
Their pairing allows a rare opportunity
on the big screen where the homophobia of
a straight man comes under close scrutiny
and is shown more than unflatteringly —
Miller verbalizes at one point: "When you're
brought up like me, you're taught right away
as a kid that queers are weird, queers are
afraid to fight, queers are a danger to little
kids, all queers want to do is get into your
pants." Beckett, the consummate legal pro
fessional who is fighting for both justice and
his life, debunks such myths.
Washington's performance as Miller,
perhaps too close to life for comfort (the
actor reportedly advised Will Smith "don't
be kissing no man" for his work as a gay con
man in "Six Degrees of Separation"), is riv
eting and full-blooded, capable of drawing
that guilty pang in the heart of the redneck
who might hopefully be in the audience.
Thankfully too, the director resists forcing a
complete change of heart in Miller's attitude
from paranoid homophobe to ardent ho
mophile before the film's close; Miller may
have learned to respect a gay man — em

bracing one could still be too much for him.
As Beckett, Hanks makes that belated
leap from cozy nice-guy to virtuoso actor
here, leaving behind a trail of affable guises
that sold the likes of "Splash" and "Sleepless
in Seattle." There is no emotion-milking
speeches from Beckett; those arc rightly left
to Miller's courtroom arguments. Instead,
the actor allows his hollowed eyes and body
movement to tell the plight of a thousand
others battling the same scourge.
The script's most prominent flaw though
lies in its treatment of the defense counsel
(Mary Steenburgen), whose off-the-cuff re
mark ("I hate this case") apologizes for her
role in the trial, thereby costing the film her
character's professional credibility.
During a metaphorically obvious but ulti
mately affecting sequence, Beckett, in a self
imposed trance complete with I.V. drip in
tow, mimes to an aria ("I.a Mamma Morta"
by Maria Callas) from Umbcrto Giordano's
"Andrea Chdnicr," while Miller watches on,
more than slightly perplexed at his client's
emotional identification with an opera diva
who sings "I am Life! 1 am Oblivion! I am
Love!"
This is where "Philadelphia" is most
successful: it places polarized individuals
in close proximity, and observes their
struggle to deal with each other, never
denying or white-washing the differences
that exist between them, while hopeful that
humanity could prevail despite such differ
ences.
"Philadelphia" appeals to the basic decen
cy, the sense of justice that its viewer might
possess. Watch it, so that one may stand up
and be counted.
