## Shadowlands 
### 
"Shadowlands" is the modest, graceful re
sult of a mighty task, capturing the contradic
tory nature of C.S. Lewis (Anthony Hopkins)
— an internationally famous scholar who lives
in relative seclusion, a children's author who
doesn't know any children, a believer in the
healing power of love and pain who has never
felt either.
Never, until he meets Joy Gresham (Debra
Winger), a loud-mouthed "Jewish-Commu
nist-Christian-American" poet who infiltrates
Lewis' quiet life, cuts through his psychological
security and inadvertently teaches the Oxford

don a few life lessons—
and, tragically, some
death lessons as well.
Lewis is another
variation on Hopkins'
repressed Brit act, but
it's the most fully real
ized and sympathetic,
perhaps because it's
based on a real person.
His solemn lectures on
the healing power of
pain are concluded

with a cheery little smile that betrays both in
nocence and self-satisfaction.
As Gresham, Winger is allowed to do what
she does best —annoy everyone. Much-need
ed comic relief comes from Lewis' feckless col
leagues, led by the übiquitous John Wood. En
sconced in the back room of a local pub trad
ing sick Freudian interpretations of "The
Chronicles of Narnia," this bunch of cranky,
socially inept chaps could be a gathering of
bricklayers rather than renowned scholars.
Director Richard Attenborough lovingly
captures the musty grandeur of Oxford's glow
ing interiors and mist-shrouded spires. The
pageant of learning takes on the colors and
scale of a medieval tableau.
William Nicholson's screenplay is intimate
and brutally honest. Indeed, "Shadowlands" is
remarkably restrained, especially coming from
the director of the bombastic "Gandhi" and
"Chaplin."
Perhaps too restrained. "Shadowlands" du
tifully portrays Lewis in his various roles as
scholar, theologian and children's author with
out delving into these incarnations except to
further the rather conventional love story at the
heart of the movie. The movie falters in the
shadowlands between biography and romance,
finding magic but not purpose along the way.
