# The
						Summer House
## 
### 
There's nothing sunny about this British
import, a kind of working-class "A Room With
A View." But on a wet winter day,"The Sum
mer House" will warm your heart like a cup of
hot tea.
Margaret (Lena Headcy), an English girl
with the looks and willpower of a damp marsh
mallow, finds herself distressed: she's engaged to
"a man no one likes" and distracted by dreams
—or are they flashbacks?— filled with exotic
men in safari suits and long black cars.
Then there's her mother (Julie Walters), an
anxious divorcee who's pushing Margaret to
marry so she won't be "left on the shelf." I ler fi
ancee Syl (David Threlfall) is equally deaf to
Margaret's doubts: the 40-year-old is obvious
ly eager to spite his disapproving "Mummy"
(Joan Plowright).
If anyone can stop Margaret's marriage, it's
her mother's friend Lili (Jeanne Moreau), the
free-spirited house guest who leaves a huge red
lipstick print on Margaret's cheek and an even
more vivid impression on her mind.
The aging ex-ballerina with the mysterious
accent is a colorful and somewhat grating pres
ence in their gray suburb, given to flicking her

cigarette holder around while spouting world
weary bon mots: "Can you believe our luck?
Another day!"
When Lili shows up, "The Summer I louse"
turns unexpectedly funny and often downright
raunchy. In one scene, Margaret recalls Syl's
proposal: "I didn't reply, so we were engaged."
Martin Sherman's script and the fine cast
are burdened with a lot of unnecessary exposi
tion. But what starts out as awkward and
clich£d blooms and synergizes under the direc
tion of Waris Hussein.
At first, Margaret's flashbacks seem to be
long to a different, more interesting movie, but
eventually they are integrated into one multi
dimensional saga. It's just one of many surpris
es waiting in "The Summer House."
