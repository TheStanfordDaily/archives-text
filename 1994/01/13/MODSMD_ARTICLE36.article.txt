## Young and Springsteen keep 'Philly' soundtrack from drifting 
### 
There's no accurate way to tell
why or when an artist might agree to
record for a film soundtrack. For in
stance, one would have a hard time
discerning why R.E.M. contributed
to the disastrous Pan Aykroyd pro
ject "Coneheads," aside from some
possible lingering affection for a
dated comedy sketch that was never
very funny in the first place.
The most obvious reason is that a
movie's subject matter preemptively
restricts artistic license. But at times a
filmmaker's ambitions are noble
enough to sway the sympathies of
even the most revered pop icon.
And so it is that Bruce Spring
steen and Neil Young — the two
most searching and enduring
singer-songwriters of their time —
have recorded new original songs
for "Philadelphia," director
Jonathan Demme's latest film,
which discusses an AIDS victim's
fight against discrimination. While
both Springsteen and Young deliver
uncommonly moving perfor
mances, the rest of the album —
much like, by many accounts, the
movie — falls short of its intended
aspirations; it engages, but fails to
inspire. And considering the urgent
gravity of its subject, that is no small
shortcoming.
Luckily, Springsteen and Young
arc here, because, like veteran ath
letes, they make everyone else play
better. Springsteen's "Streets of
Philadelphia," the album's first cut,
resonates throughout the remainder

of the disc. It begins with a seduc
tive, almost danceable drum beat,
then surprisingly lays down a dron
ing organ chord. In the brooding,
aged rasp that has only emerged in
The Boss's most recent recordings,
Springsteen takes on the character
of a battered everyman, finding little
but isolation and emptiness at the
end of a ragged life: "I saw my reflec
tion in a window /1 didn't know my
own face / Oh brother are you going
to leave me / Wastin' away / On the
streets of Philadelphia."
Springsteen calls out for the
comfort of a companion, and hopes
for connection. "Ain't no angel
going to greet me / It's just you and I
my friend ... So receive me with
your faithless kiss / Or we will leave
each other alone like this." Spring
steen sweeps the listener from the
street to a cathedral.
The closing song on the record,
Young's "Philadelphia," expresses
none of Springsteen's foreboding.
With the same acoustic, hopeful
sound that characterized his sub
lime "Harvest Moon" and "Un
plugged" recordings, Young's tale is
one of quiet sexual discovery and
tolerance: "I'vegot my friends in the
world /1 had my friends / When we
were boys and girls / And the secrets
came unfurled."
When he finds love and "sees the
light /1 know I'll be all right." It's an
unusually idealistic view of our abil
ity to confront AIDS, but Young,
through his incomparable falsetto

and restrained piano playing, gives
reason to believe.
If only the album's younger artists
could match the vision and sensitivi
ty of these middle-aged men. Part of
the problem is that most don't even
try. Aside from Peter Gabriel's melo
dious but empty "Ix>vetown" and
Paulctta Washington's largely irrele
vant "It's In Your Eyes," the rest of
"Philadelphia" amounts to little
more than faithful covers of recycled
songs.
The best of these is Sadc's rendi
tion of Percy Mayfield's "Please
Send Me Someone To Ix>ve," a mes
merizing performance that un
dresses the listener. The Indigo Girls
check in with a warm version of
Crazy Horse's "I Don't Wanna Talk
About It," while the Spin Doctors
offer Creedence's "Have You Ever
Seen The Rain?" — thankfully
sounding slightly less annoying than
they do when playing their own
music.
Yet, despite the hopefulness of
Young's track and the majesty of
Howard Shore's orchestral epilogue,
"Precedent," there's a real sadness to
this record that's not entirely in
tended. "Philadelphia" has the feel
of a worthy project gone flat —
something even more regrettable
when one considers that the artists
who dominate the record have ci
ther reached 50 or are pushing it and
have more relevance to our parents
than to us. It's as if this generation
can't find it within itself to stare

AIDS and intolerance in the eye, and
instead has resigned itself to con
cluding that such scourges are mere
ly tragic realities of our time.
In the end, "Philadelphia" 's
biggest fault is its failure to move its
audience beyond its limitations. Un

fortunately, the soundtrack falls into
the category of red ribbons, condom
ads and benefit compilations which
painlessly appease our own guilt. We
should expect more from this
album, and more from ourselves.

With "Please Send Me Someone to Love," Sade makes love to the
music, but fails to truly confront the issues of intolerance surround
ing AIDS on the soundtrack to "Philadelphia."
