## "What's Goin' On" UNV 
### 
When Boy/. 11 Men collides with cheesy love
lyrics, you get Maverick recording artists
UNV. While "What's Coin' On," the Nubian
quartet's debut album, does an adequate job
of presenting the group's strong sense of vocal
harmony, UNV's eagerness to appeal to a mass
pop audience (read: expand their audience
through wanna be hip hop songs) puts rust
on an otherwise sterling R&B release.
But despite the sour lyrics and limp flava of
their upbeat tunes, the group's serenades are
as sensual and heated as a backrub from a sig
nificant other.

In fact we're star
tled by the ease in
which tracks like
"What's Goin' On,"
lure us through the
ups and downs of
love. The title track's
rhythms and har
monies play our
heart strings like a
harp. "Something's
goin' on," the crew

croon. "The love we used to share is gone / I'm
falling out of love with you / And I don't know
what to do." It's cold loneliness and abandon
ment on a platter.
The melancholy of "Straight From My
Heart" and the sensuality of "Close Tonight"
showcase their powerful yet graceful vocals
which caress the ears like a warm hug. Like
Boy/ II Men, these Nubian voices interact
peacefully like the gears of a well-oiled clock.
UNV does fine until they trade in "Mo
townphilly" harmonics for "Bust a Move"
rhymes. In "Who Will It Be?," the thumpin'
bass line and snare kick seem destined to be
Top 40 material. But the dream comes to a
fiery crash as the lyrics yell, "mayday."
Caught in rhythmic paradox, their
rhymes — "I hit the shower so I can smell
fresh like a rose / Grab the iron then I press
my clothes"— feel oddly conspicuous on top
of U )azzmataz7."-influenced production.
Truthfully, their brand of hip-hop machismo
simply undermines the smoothness of the
track, making it both trendy and forgettable.
However, despite their shortcomings, if
you put UNV, chicken cacciatore, candlelight
and fine wine together, you've got a date. Just
remember to program your CD player to skip
the fluff and get to what's really goin' on.
