# "Gentlemen" Afghan Whigs
## 
### 
Perhaps, someday, all the flannel-adorned
bands that litter college radio will grow up to
be like the Afghan Whigs, a group that has
emerged from the ranks of the grungy to
record "Gentlemen," a release that rates
among the best 1993 had to offer. "Gentle
men," in honest and remarkably lucid fash
ion, explores the insecurities of the young,
confused American male.
The Whigs' maturity means that "Gentle
men" isn't for everyone. You won't find many
intoxicating hooks or breezy melodies here;
the Whigs' brand of basic, driving beats and
raging guitars isn't, to say the least, radio
friendly. But even harder to handle is the
brooding, painful lyrics here, which are for
luckless lovers only. This is a record to stay
home alone and drink with.
The story of "Gentlemen" is really an old
one: boy meets girl, girl leaves boy, boy and
girl spend the rest of their lives trying to hurt
each other. But as we all know, a thousand lit
tle things come along with relationships —
nothing's ever clean or simple. On the first
track, "If 1 Were Going," lead singer Greg

Dulli reflects on such emotional uncertainty:
"Tf I ignore it, it gets uncomfortable / She'll
want to argue about the past / Still 1 think she
believes me / Kvery word I say."
From there, the Whigs launch into brash,
bravura discourses on their masculinity, with
Dulli singing on the pulsing "Be Sweet,"
"Now I'm OK, but in time I'll find I'm stuck /
'Cause she wants love, and I still want to
fuck." But there's a darkness lurking behind
such a pronouncement: on the next song,
"Debonair," the formerly swaggering singer
croons "Tonight I go to hell. For what I've
done to you. This ain't about regret. It's when
I tell the truths
"When We Two Parted" might be the
album's most singularly beautiful song — a
drowsy, moping ballad that professes defen
sive innocence. "If it starts to hurt you then
have to say so."
Ironically, the last words spoken on the
album are "I love you," but "Gentlemen" con
cludes with a haunting five-minute instru
mental, a tableau of words that are never spo
ken. In a strange sense, this brilliant disc is a
call for understanding between the sexes. And
it also reveals that we may some day look back
on the music called grunge and realize it told
us more about ourselves than we ever knew.
