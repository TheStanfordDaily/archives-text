# Loving the 'Phantom'
## Andrew LLoyd Webber's historic saga 
### Kimberly Chrisman 
Among the
modern myths,
there are few so
enduring as "The
Phantom of the
Opera." Gaston
Leroux's 1911

penny-dreadful is one of the most-staged
stories of our time, and, in Andrew Lloyd
Webber's celebrated production, it's easy to
see why.
Having haunted discriminating CD col
lections since its 1986 premiere, this "Phan
tom" has finally arrived in San Francisco. It's
a show worth waiting for — part opera, part
theme park, exhilarating and, yes, scary.
"Phantom" begins as the Cinderella story
of Christine, a beautiful chorus girl who steps
into a leading role and achieves instant star
dom, attracting the attentions of a handsome
Vicomte in the process.
But "Cinderella" quickly, nightmarishly
turns into "Beauty and the Beast" as Chris
tine's masked, mysterious "singing tutor" —
a hideously malformed composer who, Sven
gali-like, makes Christine his muse and
mouthpiece — grows jealous and vengeful.
Just as the Phantom beckons Christine
through her dressing room mirror, we follow
the music and ever-changing sets on a wild
and romantic ride from the rooftops of Paris
to the Phantom's subterranean lair.
The gilded Curran Theater is the perfect
stand-in for the 19th-century Paris Opera
House, and a luminous backdrop for Maria
Bjornson's tasseled curtains, ornate cande
labra and Degas-inspired ballerinas.
Director Harold Prince crafts a series of
spectacular scenes — a masquerade ball, a
murky, misty gondola ride, a plummeting
chandelier, a graveyard confrontation —
punctuated by deliciously overwrought

screams ("Aieeee!") as the Phantom claims
victim after victim.
But the spectacle just sets the stage for the
Phantom's next trick. As the man behind the
mask, Davis Gaines keeps us in constant an
ticipation of his next appearance, craning
our necks to discover his latest hiding place.
Hissing, growling, seething with passion

and fury, Gaines' voice raises temperatures
well before he appears on stage. His "Music
of the Night" is no ode to song, but an erotic
lullaby unlike anything you'll hear on the cast
album.
The Vicomte, Raoul, is a thankless, inef
fectual character to begin with, and Ray
mond Saar does little to ennoble him. He's

more matinee
idol than idealis
tic hero, dutiful
straight man to
the Phantom's in
creasingly per
verse antics.

But Lisa Vroman makes Christine's in
stant transformation from ditzy dancer to
prima donna sweetly convincing. If she's
forced to shriek and simper a lot, she does it
well. And her honeyed voice nearly saves the
sappy "Wishing You Were Somehow Here
Again" from total torpor.
The enormous supporting cast is lively and
loud, though it was a mistake to cast dancer
Tracey Allyn in the role of Meg, a character
which also requires a voice and acting ability.
Whatever one thinks of Andrew Lloyd
Webber, he has managed to create some truly
chilling theme music, as well as the wistful
show stoppers " I hink of Me" and "All 1 Ask
of You." And, in this opera about opera, he
lightens up with clever in-jokes and operatic
parodies.
While "Phantom" is a masterpiece of
music and spectacle, what draws record
breaking crowds is its timeless theme of un
requited love, which keeps us interested —
intrigued — even when the story degener
ates into a gutless love triangle, barely en
livened by a splash of Scooby-Doo-style
ghost hunting.
In the Phantom, Lloyd Webber finds a
hero for the ages and, one suspects, an alter
ego. This "lonesome gargoyle" is no ghost,
but a lost soul in a bleak and uncaring world.
Enter it. ■
