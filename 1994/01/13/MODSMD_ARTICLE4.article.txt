						minor shortcoming
## Basketball court in new facility falls two feet short of standard 
### Charles Katz Staff writer 
The new Arrillaga Family
Sports ('enter has a shortcoming
— a two-foot shortcoming, to be
exact.
The new basketball court in the
facility is 92 feet long, two feet
shorter than the standard court
size of 94 feet. Sounds like a sim
ple problem to correct — just
lengthen the court by two feet.
Well, it's not that easy.
Athletic Director Ted Leland
said the additional two feet would
add approximately $1.5 million to
the cost of the $15 million build
ing. Because of building codes and
structural difficulties, the only
way to ameliorate the short court
would be to significantly rework
the building. "Major cross-beams
would have to be shifted because
the extra length would throw the
building off-center," Leland said.
The Department of Athletics
has known about the deficient
court for about a year, Leland
said. "When the problem came up,
I talked with the coaches and Mr
Arrillaga, and we decided the cost
did not merit adding the two feet."
The building could haveaccom

modated a full-length court in its
basement, but the weight room
grew too large and the decision
was made to keep the court on the
main floor, said a spokesperson
for Vance Brown & Sons, the con
struction firm that is building the
complex.
In addition, building codes
"created so many parameters —
there [wasl very little you [couldl
do," the spokesperson said.
Even though the court is short
er than traditional courts, it still
complies with NCAA regulations,
Leland said. "The NCAA only says
that a court must be between 90
and 96 feet. For years, the Univer
sity of the Pacific played on a court
that was only 92 feet."
The 92-foot Arrillaga court will
only be a practice facility for Stan
ford's varsity teams. All home
games will still be played in
Maples Pavilion.
Women's basketball head
coach Tara VanDerveer said she
was just happy to have the court
at all, regardless of its length. "Be
cause of other activities at Stan
ford, sometimes we don't have
anywhere at all to go," she said.
