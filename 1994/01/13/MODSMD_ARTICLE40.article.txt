A Dangerous Woman
Stricken by some nameless mental
disability, Martha Horgan (Debra
Winger) alienates the town with her
inappropriate actions Her screwy
relationships with her aunt and a vis
iting schmarmy drunk lead to fre
quent sex scenes, an implausible vi
olent act and, sadly, boredom More
disturbing is the persistent use of
stereotypes of the disabled and the
constant blurring of the lines be
tween sex and rape R
Faraway, So Close
Despite being shot partially in black
and white and containing subtitles,
Wim Wender's brilliant German film
manages to entertain while dis
cussing the morality and corruptibili
ty of humans Set in a world where
an angel can give up his divinity to
become human once more, "Far
away, So Close" is a thought-pro
voking and multi dimensional film
that can be seen many times without
losing its intrigue UNRATED
Heaven and Earth
Oliver Stone's latest brilliant creation
— the true story of a Vietnamese
woman who worked for the Vietcong
before violence turned her away
stands out among Vietnam films be
cause of its emphasis on the Viet
namese perspective Newcomer

Hiep Thi Le and veteran Tommy Lee
Jones deliver poignant perfor
mances which reflect the pain of
their characters' lives and the rav
ages and insanity of the war. R
Jamon Jamon
"Jamon Jamon" is the story of a
wealthy woman whose marriage has
lost that lovin' feeling, whose only
son's mind is set on a most unsuit
able young woman and who is des
perately looking for passion. Deceit
and obsession and a series of pas
sionate exchanges mask a discus
sion of sexual maturity. Although the
ultimate profundity of "Jamon
Jamon" is never thoroughly real
ized, its tragic elements coupled
with its strong eroticism keep it
strides ahead of the majority of Hol
lywood's so-called "sex revela
tions." UNRATED
Mrs. Doubtfire
Without Robin Williams, this would
be just another boy dresses-as-girl
flick He carries it into the land of en
tertainment — with a serious mes
sage hidden just below the surface
With adequate support from the rest
of the cast (Sally Field, Pierce Bros
nan), Williams' first self-produced
flick deals with parenthood and di
vorce while always keeping one
hand on the funny bone PG-13

The Pelican Brief
Picture Julia Roberts She could al
most (just almost) pass for your av
erage law student — the kind who
uncovers the conspiracy behind the
deaths of two Supreme Court jus
tices But this premise is no more
believable in Alan J Pakula's film
"The Pelican Brief" than it is in John
Grisham's bestsellmg novel No one
can accuse Pakula of original ideas;
every scene of the movie is lifted al
most verbatim from the novel. In
stead of watching the "Great Julia
Roberts Comeback," order out for a
slice of "Mystic Pizza " PG-13
A Perfect World
Relative unknown T.J. Lowther car
ries the day in this star-studded
(Kevin Costner, Clint Eastwood) tale
of personal growth. Beginning with
the kidnapping of a 7-year-old by a
pair of just-escaped convicts and
continuing with the predictable man
hunt, "A Perfect World" is truly a
story of relationships — good and
evil, criminal and lawman and, most
importantly, adult and child PG-13
The Piano
The prize piece from Cannes sings
with the performances of Holly
Hunter, Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill
in a masterful tale of beauty and
beasts. Exploring the sexual under

tones to the myth that the Disney
film could only hint at, Jane Campi
on proves her worth as a writer and
director while coloring the rough
grays between good and evil R
Schindler's List
The haunting images of Steven
Spielberg's "Schindler's List" over
come the film's characters, leaving
moments more important than peo
ple. The story of German entrepre
neur Oskar Schindler and the more
than 1,100 Jews he saves leads to
an examination of the many faces of
evil in the Nazi regime. With indeli
ble pictures of death and degrada
tion burned in black-and-white film,
"Schindler's List" captures the truth
of more than six million murders. R
Six Degrees of Separation
This adaptation of John Guare's crit
ically celebrated play "Six Degrees
of Separation" spins out a limitless
line of deception as a young black
man brings a knife wound and a bag
of lies into the world of the wealthy.
But under the placid face of tall tales
lies a complicated, homeless, ho
mosexual drifter. Unfortunately, the
film does not live up to its potential
in discussing race and class issues,
but it's more than entertaining in its
demonstration of the nothingness of
purposeless life R
