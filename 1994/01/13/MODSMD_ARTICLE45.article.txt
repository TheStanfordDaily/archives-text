# Reasons to rent...

As I watched the last Flick,
"Much Ado About Nothing," I
was reminded of another film
that also starred the famous cou
ple who helped make "Much
Ado" so funny — the heavenly
British-Hollywood pair of Ken
neth Branagh and Emma
Thompson. The thriller of which

I speak is "Dead Again."
Definitely a far cry from
Shakespeare, this potboil-

er scares beyond belief. Although
I'm not usually one for horror
flicks, "Dead Again" more than
held my attention. Not only did it
keep me in suspense, but the plot
line had some really interesting
and unexpected twists—includ
ing a trip through the past.
And then, there was the sym

bolic use of scissors that recurred
throughout the movie.
For at least a few days after
ward, I was scared of anyone I
saw cutting even the tiniest bit of
paper. If you are in the mood to
be frightened, rent "Dead
Again."
And don't forget to bring the
blanket to cover your eyes —
just in case.
