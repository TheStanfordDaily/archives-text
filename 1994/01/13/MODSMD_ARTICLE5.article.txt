# Skeptical crowd grills top officials at forum on ethnic center cuts
## 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
Provost Condoleezza Rice and other ad
ministrators defensively reiterated the need
for a unilateral examination of the Universi
ty's budget to an often skeptical and emo
tional audience at a student forum last
night.
Rice — who could not attend the first half
of the forum titled "Fulfilling Stanford's
Mission: The Gap Between Rhetoric and Re
ality" due to a previously planned faculty
dinner — missed the impassioned presenta
tions made by students and alumni from the
four major ethnic centers on the history of
and need for the centers and the need for
student input in the entire planning
process.
Consequently, by the time Rice took the
stage to field questions, many of the 250 stu
dents in attendance were already agitated
and eager to challenge her on the Universi
ty's commitment to the ethnic centers, the
hiring freeze that is delaying the search for
Native American Center Director Jim Lari
more's replacement and a perceived admin
istrative unresponsiveness of student con
cerns.

"You don't have the standing to question
my commitment to minorities and minority
issues," Rice responded at one point to an
audience member. "I've been black all my
life."
Rice said the University has a strong
commitment to the ethnic communities,
demonstrated by their placement on Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper's "fund
raising priority list."
The Students of Color Coalition, formed
by members of the four major ethnic cen
ters, scheduled the forum to educate admin
istrators, faculty and students on the impor
tance of the ethnic centers, which are cur
rently threatened by budget cuts. The cuts,
which will be implemented over a three year
period, will likely total 15 percent to 30 per
cent of the current budget for all areas
under Student Affairs.
The ethnic centers allege that cuts of that
magnitude would cripple already under
funded and understaffed communities that
spend 80 percent to 90 percent of their bud
gets on staff salaries. Combined, the cen
ters' budgets total approximately $579,000.
Rice encouraged the students to partici-
pate in finding ways to cut the Stu
dent Affairs budget."The way to
engage me is to demonstrate your
seriousness on strategic planning.
It's up to you to engage in the pro
cess, not sit back and say, 'Engage
me, engage me, engage me,' " Rice
told the audience.
She also said that she had some
questions that students will need
to answer persuasively in order to
succeed in gaining funds from
benefactors.
"They'll want to know, 'Do they
cooperate with each other, with the
University?' You're competing
against national priorities Like K
-12 education — and a lot of donors
see these as more important," she
said.
The administrative representa
tives — Rice, Vice Provost and
Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds and Dean of Students
Michael Jackson — repeatedly said
how glad they were that the stu
dents were engaged in the process.
Edmonds, who attended the entire
forum along with Jackson, termed
it a "beautiful fight."
Indeed, both students and
administrators aired their argu
ments in a charged atmosphere,
with Rice drawing scoffs from
some in the audience when she
said, "Trust me — fund-raising is

not an easy matter "
The communities of color
addressed issues of student partici
pation, ethnic studies and sepa
ratism in a unified presentation
made by leaders of each major
organization.
"I don't want us to march any
more, fight anymore or sit in any
more . . . that's what our parents
did," said Chris Donald of the
Black Student Union to a standing
ovation. "We're not asking for
empathy. We're offering a hand in
constructive change.
"Allow us to be part of the solu
tion, not the problem," he added.
Students also expressed frustra
tion and suspicion with the process
and the administration.
"We are tired of carrying the
burden of proof for our very exis
tence. (The administrators) don't
know how to deal with us or with
students in general," said Myra
Parker, a Stanford American Indi
an Organization member.
"I'm tired of playing their game,
of being diplomatic. I'm not a
politician and I don't think I
should have to be one. This is a
university, not Washington, D.C.,"
she added.
Anietie Ekanem, chair of the
BSU, refuted Rice's dismissal of
"mobilization politics" — the stu
dent mass activism that brought
about last night's forum.
"What she terms 'mobilization
politics,' I see as 'student voice,' "
Ekanem said.

Asian-American Students Asso
ciation Vice Chair Stephen Chen
said he felt that the timing of
administrators' meetings on the
budget cuts with students — an
early morning at the end of last
quarter's Dead Week — was delib
erately planned to undermine stu
dent input.
"I feel there's a total disrespect
and disregard for us as students,
deeper beyond budget cuts . . . and
more systematic," he said. "The
only meeting was with small hand
fuls [of the ethnic community).
Why aren't they bringing it out to
the community (as a whole)?"
After the meeting, Chen said he
felt the meeting was "pretty posi
tive in that there were a lot of stu
dents there."
However, in addressing the
question of whether the forum
broke any significant ground on
the issue of ethnic centers, he said,
"It was just another step in the
process."
For their part, Jackson and
Edmonds continued to emphasize
the need for University-wide bud
get examinations and the prelimi
nary drafl status of any proposals,
as well as insisting on the concur
rence of student and administra
tive interests.
"We're here as your advocates,
not your adversaries," Edmonds
said. "We would never do away
with [the ethnic centers] or make
them so ineffective they couldn't
operate."

Edmonds also defended the
freeze on the search for Larimore's
replacement by saying that — con
trary to one of the student speak
er's assertions — no new perma
nent positions had been fdled and
that it was "good managerial sense
to freeze all permanent positions."
Edmonds added that a decision on

the search would be made by mid-
February.
Also, when students asked why
the move for the forum wasn't
made by the administration, Rice
said that the students "beat us to
the punch. There's nothing wrong
with that."
Rice remained firm in her

stance throughout the discussion.
"I work on (the budget) for 14-15
hours a day," she said. "And I
didn't leave a perfectly satisfying
teaching and research job not to
accomplish anything.
"But one thing you can be cer
tain," she added. "I will always be
straightforward."
