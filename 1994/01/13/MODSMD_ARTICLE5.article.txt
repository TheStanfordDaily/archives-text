# Skeptical crowd grills top officials at forum on ethnic center cuts

Provost Condoleezza Rice and other ad
ministrators defensively reiterated the need
for a unilateral examination of the Universi
ty's budget to an often skeptical and emo
tional audience at a student forum last
night.
Rice — who could not attend the first half
of the forum titled "Fulfilling Stanford's
Mission: The Gap Between Rhetoric and Re

dinner — missed the impassioned presenta

four major ethnic centers on the history of
and need for the centers and the need for
student input in the entire planning
process.
Consequently, by the time Rice took the
stage to field questions, many of the 250 stu

"You don't have the standing to question
my commitment to minorities and minority
issues," Rice responded at one point to an
audience member. "I've been black all my
life."
Rice said the University has a strong
commitment to the ethnic communities,

by members of the four major ethnic cen

istrators, faculty and students on the impor
tance of the ethnic centers, which are cur
rently threatened by budget cuts. The cuts,
which will be implemented over a three year
period, will likely total 15 percent to 30 per
cent of the current budget for all areas
under Student Affairs.
The ethnic centers allege that cuts of that
magnitude would cripple already under
funded and understaffed communities that
spend 80 percent to 90 percent of their bud
gets on staff salaries. Combined, the cen
ters' budgets total approximately $579,000.
Rice encouraged the students to partici-
