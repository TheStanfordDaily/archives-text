# Budget officials outline strategy for slicing costs

Just two days before administrative units
submit budget cut proposals to the provost,
the University's top three financial officers
outlined their strategy for slashing this
year's budget and crafting long-term invest
ment policies.
Speaking before approximately 200 man
agers at Fairchild Auditorium yesterday,
Chief Financial Officer Peter Van Etten
summarized the "seismic shocks" that have
rocked the University's fiscal house over the
last five years and explained the "broad eco
nomic principles that are guiding our deci
sion making."
However, the symposium did not reveal
what kinds of administrative cuts are likely
to be pursued. "What we won't be able to do
today is give you the answer to what will
happen when you submit your budgets Fri
day," Van Etten admitted.
Administrative units have been asked to
submit budgets to Provost Condoleezza Rice
that cut 5 percent to 10 percent from their
current operating expenses. The University
hopes to slice $18-20 million from its oper
ating budget by 1997 through academic and

administrative restructuring.
Van Etten, who preceded Vice Provost for
Institutional Planning Geoffrey Cpx and
Budget Director Tim Warner yesterday, set
out "to answer the question: How come
Stanford's so rich but acts so poor?" He con
tended that while the University retains as
sets in excess of $3 billion, a large portion of
that is restricted, or limited to certain pre
scribed expenditures.
"Much of our revenue is not available for
general purposes, to cover costs," Van Etten
said.
This problem was exacerbated in the late
1980s by three "seismic shocks" â€” the
Loma Prieta earthquake, the "Dingell, or
Biddle earthquake" of the indirect-cost con
troversy and a cyclical weakness in the U.S.
economy, Van Etten said. Though Stan
ford's revenue from private gifts and the
government has "seen significant growth,"
the result of the shocks has been shrinking
availability of unrestricted funds, he added.
"The growth of revenue will be re
strained in the future, in particular, revenue
that supports the University's (academic)
infrastructure," Van Etten said.
