# Budget officials outline strategy for slicing costs
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
Just two days before administrative units
submit budget cut proposals to the provost,
the University's top three financial officers
outlined their strategy for slashing this
year's budget and crafting long-term invest
ment policies.
Speaking before approximately 200 man
agers at Fairchild Auditorium yesterday,
Chief Financial Officer Peter Van Etten
summarized the "seismic shocks" that have
rocked the University's fiscal house over the
last five years and explained the "broad eco
nomic principles that are guiding our deci
sion making."
However, the symposium did not reveal
what kinds of administrative cuts are likely
to be pursued. "What we won't be able to do
today is give you the answer to what will
happen when you submit your budgets Fri
day," Van Etten admitted.
Administrative units have been asked to
submit budgets to Provost Condoleezza Rice
that cut 5 percent to 10 percent from their
current operating expenses. The University
hopes to slice $18-20 million from its oper
ating budget by 1997 through academic and

administrative restructuring.
Van Etten, who preceded Vice Provost for
Institutional Planning Geoffrey Cpx and
Budget Director Tim Warner yesterday, set
out "to answer the question: How come
Stanford's so rich but acts so poor?" He con
tended that while the University retains as
sets in excess of $3 billion, a large portion of
that is restricted, or limited to certain pre
scribed expenditures.
"Much of our revenue is not available for
general purposes, to cover costs," Van Etten
said.
This problem was exacerbated in the late
1980s by three "seismic shocks" — the
Loma Prieta earthquake, the "Dingell, or
Biddle earthquake" of the indirect-cost con
troversy and a cyclical weakness in the U.S.
economy, Van Etten said. Though Stan
ford's revenue from private gifts and the
government has "seen significant growth,"
the result of the shocks has been shrinking
availability of unrestricted funds, he added.
"The growth of revenue will be re
strained in the future, in particular, revenue
that supports the University's (academic)
infrastructure," Van Etten said.
Thus, one hallmark of the Uni
versity's new economic doctrine
will be a change in the way that
units report their budgets, so that
both restricted and unrestricted
funds are listed on one consolidat
ed budget, Van Etten said.
But he also reiterated the
provost's contention that adminis
trative units themselves can still
decrease internal expenses, a state
ment that drew more than a hand
ful of smirks from the audience.
"Your laughter is understand
able," Van Etten responded. "I'm
somewhat uncomfortable talking
about it, because you've heard it
all before and been through so
many bips and baps."
However, Van Etten believes
such goals can be met if only, he
conceded, "because we're desperate
— we've tried everything else."
Cox followed by stressing the
long-range investment strategies
the University hopes will preclude
the need for endless waves of bud
get cuts. "The idea is not (just) to
bring the budget into balance,"
but to change the way Stanford
gets its revenue, he said. "Univer
sities cannot operate in a state of
equilibrium . .. It's not going to
happen."
He said that units need to think
of resources in terms of the pro
grams they support, "as opposed
to a sense of entitlement." He sug
gested that future budgeting will
take into account the quality of
particular academic disciplines
and "how much [individual]
administrative units serve the aca

demic mission of the University.
"There is no hit list, no hidden
agenda — but it is a broad and
open question," Cox said. "We
must figure out where to make pri
orities unit by unit."
Among the "planning tools" the
University hopes to implement to
ensure long-term budget solvency
are technological improvements to
making the creation of budgets
more efficient, Cox said. Another
planning tool is an innovative
"space charge" proposal that
would require units to pay a fee for
the use or maintenance of some
facilities.
In somewhat abbreviated form,
Warner closed the discussion by
revealing some budget projections
for the next three years, showing
that the University intends to
actually increase expenditures by
investing in revamped information
systems and continuing to finance
planned and deferred mainte
nance.
He also projected that Stanford
will invest $2 million in academic
programming each year. "Com
pared to the past, that's not very
much at all," he said.
After the session, Vice Presi
dent for Faculty and Staff Services
Barbara Butterfield asked
whether administrative budgets
will be consolidated across units in
the future "so there isn't imbal
ance."
"It's certainly a goal to look at
all the units on a consolidated
basis as part of the whole three
year effort," Warner replied.
"But not by Friday?" Butter
field responded, perhaps reflecting
the last-minute anxieties of
administrative managers as the
budget deadline approaches.

scribed expenditures.
"Much of our revenue is not available for
general purposes, to cover costs," Van Etten
said.
This problem was exacerbated in the late
1980s by three "seismic shocks" — the
Loma Prieta earthquake, the "Dingell, or
Biddle earthquake" of the indirect-cost con
troversy and a cyclical weakness in the U.S.
economy, Van Etten said. Though Stan
ford's revenue from private gifts and the
government has "seen significant growth,"
the result of the shocks has been shrinking
availability of unrestricted funds, he added.
"The growth of revenue will be re
strained in the future, in particular, revenue
that supports the University's (academic)
infrastructure," Van Etten said.
Thus, one hallmark of the Uni
versity's new economic doctrine
will be a change in the way that
units report their budgets, so that
both restricted and unrestricted
funds are listed on one consolidat
ed budget, Van Etten said.
But he also reiterated the
provost's contention that adminis
trative units themselves can still
decrease internal expenses, a state
ment that drew more than a hand
ful of smirks from the audience.
"Your laughter is understand
able," Van Etten responded. "I'm
somewhat uncomfortable talking
about it, because you've heard it
all before and been through so
many bips and baps."
However, Van Etten believes
such goals can be met if only, he
conceded, "because we're desperate
— we've tried everything else."
Cox followed by stressing the
long-range investment strategies
the University hopes will preclude
the need for endless waves of bud
get cuts. "The idea is not (just) to
bring the budget into balance,"
but to change the way Stanford
gets its revenue, he said. "Univer
sities cannot operate in a state of
equilibrium . .. It's not going to
happen."
He said that units need to think
of resources in terms of the pro
grams they support, "as opposed
to a sense of entitlement." He sug
gested that future budgeting will
take into account the quality of
particular academic disciplines
and "how much [individual]
administrative units serve the aca

demic mission of the University.
"There is no hit list, no hidden
agenda — but it is a broad and
open question," Cox said. "We
must figure out where to make pri
orities unit by unit."
Among the "planning tools" the
University hopes to implement to
ensure long-term budget solvency
are technological improvements to
making the creation of budgets
more efficient, Cox said. Another
planning tool is an innovative
"space charge" proposal that
would require units to pay a fee for
the use or maintenance of some
facilities.
In somewhat abbreviated form,
Warner closed the discussion by
revealing some budget projections
for the next three years, showing
that the University intends to
actually increase expenditures by
investing in revamped information
systems and continuing to finance
planned and deferred mainte
nance.
He also projected that Stanford
will invest $2 million in academic
programming each year. "Com
pared to the past, that's not very
much at all," he said.
After the session, Vice Presi
dent for Faculty and Staff Services
Barbara Butterfield asked
whether administrative budgets
will be consolidated across units in
the future "so there isn't imbal
ance."
"It's certainly a goal to look at
all the units on a consolidated
basis as part of the whole three
year effort," Warner replied.
"But not by Friday?" Butter
field responded, perhaps reflecting
the last-minute anxieties of
administrative managers as the
budget deadline approaches.
