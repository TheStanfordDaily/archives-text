# Football made easy
## Stanford lecturer invents a new type of ball; it spirals 'like crazy' 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Many grandparents have
trouble locating the perfect gift
for their grandchildren — but
Alan Adler has invented a sure
hit.
The Stanford engineering lec
turer and grandfather of three
has invented one of the hottest
new toys on the market: the Aer
obie football.
Adler's invention is a new
foam football with aerodynamic
tail fins which make it spin at
over 1,000 revolutions per
minute.
The rapid spin gives the ball
extra lift at the end of the flight so
it glides slowly into the receiver's
hands. In addition, special finger
pockets ensure that the thrower
maintains ideal hand position
ing.
"It spins like crazy when you
throw it," Adler said. "Its very
satisfying."
The Aerobie football flies far
ther and straighter at high speed
and maintains a higher spin rate

throughout its flight than a con
ventional football does. Its design
allows even a small child to throw
a perfect spiral pass.
"The purpose of | the football|
is not to go fast," he said, "but to
fly really well."
Adler was motivated to devel
op the ball by a dissatisfaction
with his own football talents.
"All my life I have been frus
trated by my own inability to
throw a football properly," he
said.
In addition, he "was aware
that foam footballs are very pop
ular toys [that] sell in very large
numbers."
Two Stanford graduates,
Brendan Boyle and Fern Mandel
baum, originally proposed the
idea to Adler, who then carried
out the necessary research to de
velop the football, with the assis
tance of Stanford graduate Peter
Mac Donald
In order to perfect the design,
Adler used the latest aerodynam
ic theories and computer Simula

Engineering lecturer Alan Adler had always been frustrated by
his inability to throw a football — so he invented a new type of
ball, equipped with fins, that makes tossing a tight spiral easy.
