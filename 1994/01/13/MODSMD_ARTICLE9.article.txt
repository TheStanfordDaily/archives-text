## Society now more accepting of interfaith marriage, panel finds 
### Grace Cua Dy 
Two days after Rabbi Charles
Familant performed his first
interfaith marriage in 1968, he
got "a lot of static" from col
leagues for doing what many in
the Jewish community considered
inappropriate.
Today, Familant said, the envi
ronment is "far different," but
marriages between Jews and
Christians still can raise some
unsettled questions. Familant and
others tried to answer those ques
tions last night in a small panel on
interfaith relationships and con
nected issues of conflicting identi
ties and isolation.
The panel — titled "When
Christians and Jews Fall in Love:
Dealing with Reality" — included
Familant, an interfaith couple and
a Protestant minister who per
forms interfaith marriages and is
in one himself. Sponsored by Hil
lel and Memorial Church, the con
ference was held in the church's
Round Room and was attended by
about two dozen people.
The most discussed question
was the issue of which faith cou
ples should encourage their chil
dren to practice. Familant point
ed out that it was usually not the
interfaith parents themselves
who made an issue out of the
question.
Most interfaith couples, he

said, discuss the question before
getting married and feel comfort
able with letting their child choose
his or her religion.
Alicia Torre, the Christian
spouse in the couple, said she
found it "far more beneficial to
raise her children where they can
draw from both rich heritages
rather than downplay the spiritu
al traditions in order to avoid con
flict."
According to statistics dis
tributed at the panel, an estimat
ed 770,000 children are raised in
mixed Jewish/Christian house
holds in America today. About 28
percent are being raised as Jews,
31 percent are being raised with
no religion and about 41 percent
are being raised in another reli
gion.
One of the most problematic
issues raised last night was how
committed each partner was to
their theological positions. The
panel discussed how such a com
mitment can break up potential
marriages, especially when one or
both partners are unwilling to
challenge their relationship with
their orthodox relatives.
Last night's program was initi
ated by Rebecca Bliss, a graduate
student in the School of Educa
tion, and was coordinated by Act
ing Dean of Memorial Church
Diana Akiyama and Hillel Pro
gram Director Rebecca Schwartz.
