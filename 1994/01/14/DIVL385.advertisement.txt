Planning on Getting a Job After Receiving Your Law Degree?

If you intend to answer "YES!" to the above questions, you should be aware that
your ability to get a well-paying job in the competitive legal market will be largely
based on your first year performance in law school.
Law firms usually hire permanent associates who have previously clerked with the
firm as summer associates. The main criteria used to hire a summer associate are
a student's first year law school grades.
