# 'Mixed blessing'
## Frosh applications rise by 7 percent 
### Elise Wolfgram Editorial staff 
Applications for a spot in next
year's freshman class are up 7
percent from this time hist year,
Dean of Admissions James Mon
toya said yesterday.
Montoya said his office has re
ceived 14,466 completed applica
tions so far, compared to 13,542
last year. The application dead
line was Dec. 15.
"I feel it's a mixed blessing,"
Montoya said. "On the one hand
it represents an increased inter
est in the University, but at the
same time it means that we have
1,000 more files to read."
Montoya said he expects that
the final number of applicants
will be around 14,500. The differ
ence represents students who
have completed their applica
tions but have not yet paid their
processing fee.
Applications to Stanford hit a
10-year low for a spot in the Class
of '94 after the Loma Prieta
Earthquake, which is believed to
have scared prospective appli
cants away. At its most popular
time in the mid-1980s, applica
tions climbed to 17,000.
Montoya said he is not sure if
the 7 percent increase comes
from the top of the applicant pool
or from the lower end. "It's diffi
cult to assess (he academic quali
ty of the applicants at this time,"
he said.
The increase comes at a time
when the number of high school
graduates is increasing as well. "I
don't think it is a 7 percent in
crease though," Montoya said.
In the past, about 2,800 stu
dents have received acceptance
letters each year.
"Overall, we're certainly
pleased with the interest shown
in Stanford," Montoya said.
