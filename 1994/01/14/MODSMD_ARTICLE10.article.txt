Hubble repairs suecessful

WASHINGTON (AP) - NASA officials
declared the Hubble Space Telescope repaired
yesterday and said the orbiting observatory can
now take the clearest, sharpest photographs in
history of distant and ancient stars.
It's fixed beyond our wildest expectations,"
said Ed Weiler, NASA's Hubble program scien
tist. "NASA has delivered a telescope that meets
all of the promises we made before launch."
The $1.6 billion Hubble was launched in 1990
with a flawed magnifying mirror, resulting in a
blurred vision of the universe. Early in Decem
ber, in the most complex space repair mission
ever, a space shuttle crew installed corrective
optics and a new camera aboard the telescope.

Mistrial in Menendez case

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The judge in Erik
Menendez's murder case declared a mistrial
yesterday after jurors reported a third time that
they could not reach a verdict. His brother's
jury kept deliberating.
Jurors considering charges against Erik first
reported an impasse Monday and were told by
Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg to keep
trying. They reported yesterday that jurors'
strong opinions had become even "more
entrenched."
Erik, 23, and his brother, Lyle, 26, admit
fatally shooting their wealthy parents, Jose and
Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills mansion
Aug. 20, 1989, but claim it was self-defense
after years of abuse.
