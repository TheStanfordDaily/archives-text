# Leaders to sign pact ending nuclear targeting

MOSCOW (AP) — Presidents
Clinton and Boris Yeltsin will
announce an accord today end
ing the targeting of nuclear mis
siles at other nations.
Their action will also lift, at
least symbolically, the specter of
nuclear annihilation from
Britain, France and others
including Ukraine, which is
pledging to get rid of the third
largest arsenal in the world and
consequently will not be target
ed by the United States or Rus
sia.
However, administration offi
cials acknowledged yesterday
that the U.S.-Russia agreement

was virtually impossible to veri
fy and that the missiles could be
retargeted within minutes.
Dunbar Lockwood, a senior
researcher at the private Arms
Control Association in Washing
ton, called it a confidence-build
ing gesture that could be reversed
quickly. He said in Washington
the accord could have been
strengthened if the two sides had
agreed to separate the warheads
from the missiles.
Still, Thomas Pickering, the
U.S. ambassador to Moscow,
called the agreement "an impor
tant first step."
"It has symbolic value but I

think it also has real value in
confidence-building between the
two countries," he said.
Some of the missiles would be
aimed at uninhabited ocean
areas, but most would no longer
be aimed at any specific target,
said administration officials.
For decades, thousands of
U.S. and Soviet nuclear war
heads have been on a ready-to-go
alert, aimed at the territories
not only of the United States
and the former Soviet Union but
of other nations, too — including
targets such as military head
quarters in large population cen
ters as well as missile sites.
