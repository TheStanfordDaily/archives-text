WHAT STUDENTS DON'T
know won't hurt them.
An odd maxim to be
floating around a university,
indeed.
But that seems to be the atti
tude of those Stanford professors
who gave their course-reader
material to the Bookstore too late
to qualify for the 20 percent
"early bird discount."
Regarding course readers for
winter quarter, the Bookstore
offered a 20 percent discount on
production costs for all material
received before Dec. 4.
Obviously, the discount
amounts to significant savings on
many course readers — especially
for classes like Art 2328, "Con
temporary Cultural Criticism,"
whose reader sells for $61.89 —
without the discount.
Professors may say saving stu
dents a couple bucks isn't worth
the hassle of preparing course
reader materials a month in
advance.

Besides, most students don't
even know about the discount
procedure.
But to many students living on
tight budgets, $7 is one fewer
hour they have to work at Food
Service, one more trip to the
movies, or — for graduate stu
dents — a week's worth of school
lunches for their child.
Barring any extenuating cir
cumstances, professors' failure to
turn course-reader materials in
early reflects insensitivity and
disregard for students and their
concerns. With many textbooks
now ringing in at $50, $60 and
even $70, any savings is welcome
and important.
So to all the Dale Maharidges
out there — who (according to
Bookstore records) turned in his
reader for Communication 277G
early, bringing its cost down to
$68.97 (without tax) — thanks.
And to the approximately 200
professors who didn't get on the
ball — thanks for nothing.
