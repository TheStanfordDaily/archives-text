# Break toward reality
## 
### 
Though it may just be
the beginning of the quarter,
students' thoughts are
already turning to spring break.
And, if you're looking for some
thing different and rewarding to
do during break, search no further
than the Haas Center for Public
Service__
This year, there are five "alter
native spring break" trips planned:
Homelessness in the Bay Area,
Homelessness in Los Angeles,
Asian-American Community
Issues, Native-American Cross
Cultural Exchange and Youth in
Action in East Palo Alto.
Graduate and undergraduate
students may participate in the
trips, which cost only $50 to
$85.

Furthermore, up to 75 percent
financial aid is available; compared
to the excessive cost of many

spring break "bargain travel pack
ages," the alternative trips are bar
gains.
However, the real value of the
trips lies in the benefits they give
to both students and the neighbor
hoods they have the opportunity to
interact with.
In addition to providing wor
thy service to various communi
ties, trip participants have a
chance to acquire new skills, as
well as to meet people outside the
Stanford community and become
friends with other students on
the trip.
Applications are available at the
Haas Center now and they're due
soon.
While others may come back
from vacation with suntans, the
experience and knowledge gained
on an alternative spring break
won't fade by May.
