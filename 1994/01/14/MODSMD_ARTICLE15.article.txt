## Sleeper of a CIV lesson 
### 
I FEEL SO OLD. Washed out, dried up
— like last quarter's pizza crusts.
Why do I feel this way?
Well, I'll tell you (but only since you
asked).
I realized that I am officially over the
hill when I was talking to a frosh. She
was whimpering about all the reading she
had to do and it struck me — I actually
miss CIV.
"Impossible!" you say. "How can you
miss such torture?"
Easy. The naps.
Most of the classes I take these days I
have to actually go to in order to pass. I
tend to take notes or at the very least,
"absorb" the lecture.
Not so with CIV. Back in the good oP
days, before thoughts of grad school
started lurking around in my brain and
my conscience didn't bother me about
how much money I was paying for each
lecture, CIV was my refuge from the cold
hard world.
My freshman dorm was not exactly
known for being quiet. The only times we
could sleep were between 6 and 8 a.m. and
during CIV lecture. I swear that my daily
nap in Cubberly is what kept body and
soul together my first year here.
There's a big hoo-ha going on right
now about revising the CIV tracks' cur
ricula (Oooh! Latin plural — I must've
picked that up in the two days we spent
on Roman culture). Many faculty and
even some students (traitorous dogs!)

contend that CIV should be more chal
lenging and demand greater involvement
on the part of the students taking it.
Bah humbug.
Yes, a quick calculation will show that
this year's frosh will spend around
$8,500 on CIV since it requires the equiv
alent of an extra quarter of work. And no,
they probably aren't getting their
money's worth of a comprehensive histo
ry of everything under the sun.
But frosh year is hard enough without
a super-intense CIV. The fact that SLE
folks huddle together in dark corners of
the Flo Mo dining halls should be proof
enough of what a beefed-up CIV could do
to otherwise happy, normal frosh. We
don't want all of the incoming class to
have that pasty, spent-too-much-time-in
the-library look.
During their first year here, frosh
need time to party their lives away, get
lost in Terman, sit around looking deep
at the Coffee House and practice wear
ing their Stanford sweatshirts. They
don't need to be weighed down by real
work.
Besides, CIV affects us in ways we
don't even recognize. It was CIV that
taught me that professors rarely expect
you to do all of the reading and that if
they do, turbo-skimming can take care of
it. It was also in CIV that I learned how to
look thoughtful while I was really asleep.
I learned that TAs are people too (usual
ly) and that professors aren't gods, no

matter what they may tell us.
CIV also exposed me to a few of the
wonders of the universe. We did address
the big questions: Is there a God? And
who in sam hill cares whether St. Augus
tine stole that darn pear?
It's a funny thing. For all that we com
plain about it, CIV is really wonderful.
It's a nice, gentle introduction to college
work. The lectures are soothing and not
too hard to follow. Everybody gets to
bond while they're boasting about how
much reading they haven't done and how
evil their TAs are (they'd even cut down
Mother Teresa — dumping on TAs is part
of the CIV ritual). It's a chance for frosh
to get to know each other and practice
their section-faking skills.
CIV was something I got through at
the time, but I appreciate it now. It has
become a part of me; no matter how
much I try, I can't seem to get rid of my
Plato's Republic. Maybe somewhere,
deep inside, I'm holding onto my books
and my memories in the hope that I'll get
to go back to those days when my biggest
worry was a five page paper and the
Cliff s Notes for "Das Kapital."

Kathleen apologizes to the Daily editors
for flaking last week. She has pulled her
head out and is recovering nicely.
