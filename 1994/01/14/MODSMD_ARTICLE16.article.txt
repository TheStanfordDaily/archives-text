## Multiculturalism should not intentionally misunderstand 
### 
TO DRAMATIZE the need to fund
minority centers, in a Jan. 10 let
ter to The Daily sophomore Rox
anna Alvarado recounted an incident
where she was next in line at the coffee
shop and another girl mistook her for
an employee. "Oh, I thought you
worked here," the person behind her
said, "you look like you do." Anyone can
sympathize with Alvarado's quick recog
nition of the possibility that she was
being racially stereotyped, but what to
make of her firm belief both that she
was being racially stereotyped and that
the other girl's statement "was made
with malice"?

The example clearly does show the
need for understanding between the
races, but are minority centers part of
the solution or part of the problem? It
has happened to me at least 20 times
that someone presumed I was working
in some place where I was shopping.
Doesn't it happen to everybody? And
who ever knows why? Maybe you are
wearing a shirt the same color as the

cashier. Maybe you look like you are
straightening something. Maybe you
look like you know what you are doing.
One of the least indicative clues to who
would be tending shop is race.
How could it happen that just
because someone mistook her for an
employee, Alvarado experienced such an
extreme and disconcerting perception of
racism? Could it have anything to do
with the fact that she is a staff member
at El Centro, self-segregated from the
day-to-day intimacies with whites that
would have shown the misunderstand
ing she was involved in to be a universal
experience? Then there is the clear vest
ed interest in perceiving racism, as
demonstrated by Alvarado's using her
charge of racism to make her plea for
multicultural financing.
The "multicultural" movement is
heavily implicated in a culture of inten
tional misunderstanding. If Alvarado's
mindset is indicative of the culture and
ideology propagated by El Centro, then
p]l Centro is part of the problem and

should not be funded, or at least, its ide
ological perversity should be counted
against its benefits in deciding whether
it is worth funding. But why take the
bad with the good. Can't we root out the
intentionally exploitative victim mind
set?
A basic criteria for funding any
"multicultural" effort should be that
the recipients firmly grasp and pro
pound that our first duty as moral peo
ple is to look for how we can under
stand each other's words and actions as
intelligent and benign. Some actions
will be benign without being intelligent,
like mistaking someone for an employ
ee. Some will be neither intelligent nor
benign. We can't only see goodwill. But
to not learn how to see it when it is
there — to choose to exploit intentional
misunderstanding instead — is a very
grave moral error.
To scorn the mutuality one claims to
be looking for is to corrupt moral reason
at its foundation. Progress in under
standing what there is to value and how

to achieve it is not possible if under
standing itself is sacrificed to present
ends and means. The person who fol
lows this path will never be able think
straight about anything. She may be
able to erect a superstructure of ideolo
gy, but it will be nothing but crass non
sense in the service of base ends and
means.
That is about how I would character
ize the multicultural movement at this
point. If campus ethnic centers would
start attending to the basic require
ments of moral reason — in particular,
start trying to understand rather than
misunderstand — they could become an
unambiguously positive force instead of
the very ambiguous force they are now.
It is a good question whether it is best
to let the groups that support the cul
ture of intentional misunderstanding
die and get out of the way, or let them
hang on in hopes that they can reform.
The answer depends on them.
