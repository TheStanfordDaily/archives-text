## Life with my 15-year-old — chromosomes take over 
### 
MATERNAL INSTINCTS, don't
fail me now. My biological clock
does not tick. My biological clock
does not tock. My biological clock plays
Parcheesi with god begging for more
time, just a little bit more, to give me a
chance to hit that ma-too-re stage they
show you Disney movies about in fifth
grade.
I am 21, count 'em 21 years old. Twen
ty-one years of impy spriteliness. Twenty
one years of pretending I'm a one-eyed
fairy on warm summer nights when the
white out smells just so and the gasoline
caps are in bloom. Twenty-one years of a
complete lack of rude comment control and
incessant wide-load jokes about women
who have the potential to date anyone in
the male species I find attractive.
Now, now, that isn't very nice.
So last week I had a coronary. I almost
saw god in her celestial light. I almost
turned myself in for my 15 overdue hon
ors thesis books. I almost, mind you
almost, decided an inter-dorm relation
ship would not spawn gossip of any kind
if kept discreet.
Just say no.

I was given the news. The show was
over. Life as I knew it, all the fun with
dryer sheets and Kraft Singles in the
dark, would never be the same frivolous
stroll through Candyland it once was. It
was straight to the Marsh mallow Swamps
for me — the end of the innocence, the
end of an era, the end of unlimited action
in my Sterling Quad inner room.
She's having a baby.
Cool your jets. Geez, didn't mean to
scare you like that. She's not having a
baby; she's having a visitor. A 15-year-old
visitor, mind you. A 15-year-old C-cupped
visitor from Nicaragua with good make
up sense. English, no. Beauty queen
material, yes.
For a week she would be visiting. A
whole week I would have to be manless. A
whole week I'd have to clean rotting
boxes of baking soda from my fridge. A
whole week I would have to share my
own personal space with someone of the
much younger, perkier persuasion. Cute
as a button. Waist like Scarlett O'Hara.
Skin as soft as a baby's backside.
I wanna be sedated.
But what was I gonna do with a 15-

year-old for a whole week? Play pool in
the Tresidder Game Room? lake long,
meaningful walks in the foothills dis
cussing Nicaraguan boys I did not know
in a language I have not fully mastered 7
Teach her how to wipe all the pro
grammed equations off the memory of my
roommate's Hewlett-Packard calculator?
Yeah,so?
My mom called to see if she'd gotten
here safely. This woman lets me catch a
nasty parasite and lose 20 pounds with
out so much as a "wear your rubbers
dear" and here some girl flies from L A.
to San Francisco and she's Eric the Red.
Yeah, she's fine. Yeah, we packed the
Kon-Tiki in the trunk like you said. Yeah,
she's well-dressed as usual. Yeah, OK, so
she's cute. Yeah, all the guys were staring
at her and not me.
Let's take this outside.
What to do? I panicked. Listen to
Spanish radio? Yep, we love that. Tour
the bathroom? Wow, it's so cool how big
it is. Hang out in my room waiting for the
cute guy down the hall with Spanish
skills to meander down to dinner? But of
course.

Piece of cake.
Then someone brought it to my atten
tion that the normal 15-year-old girl just
wants an innocent romance to remember
after her trip. A romance? But who would
go for a size three teenager with big hair
and penciled-in lips? Who would not mind
the language barrier, the risk of judicial
wrath based on U.S. statutory rape laws?
Who would have no qualms in treating my
little Jovanella to a romantic evening for
two with minimal kissing and no more?
So I caught you on that last one, did I?
You are a sicko. I know it. You're all
lurking out there just to get your grubby
paws on my little Jova. Trying to profane
the beauty and purity that is my 15-year
old child. You mock and insult me with
your lecherous thoughts. May a donkey
gnaw on your testicles for eternity.
So we stayed home and talked. We
took walks to the Bookstore. We pressed
our empty wallets against the windows of
the boutiques of the rich and famous at
the Stanford Shopping Center. We
danced salsa, discussed the butts of men
in the dorm and complained about our
paltry shoe collections.

Damn, I lost one glass slipper.
Midnight, ordering Domino's against
my moral code. Breakfast, letting her
drink Coke as one of the four major
preservative groups, not knowing any bet
ter. Seven p.m., chasing down funky dorm
pasta with chocolate-covered almonds.
Bonding through gastric distress, I began
to break the bonds of bitch-hood.
She was cute, she was perky, but she
was my little girl. I let her sleep in my
bed. I let her use my semi-name-brand
shampoo. I did the unthinkable — I let
her borrow my clothes.
Mommy's little girl.
And yesterday I had to leave her alone
in the room. Experiencing all the terrors
of motherhood at 21. She was all alone
with the cheesy Spanish radio djs. All
alone when with magazine vending pre
teens banging at the door. All alone on
the way to the dining hall at dinner. All
alone potentially with that cute guy down
the hall. That's my girl.
It's a very faint ticking.

roommate's Hewlett-Packard calculator?
Yeah,so?
My mom called to see if she'd gotten
here safely. This woman lets me catch a
nasty parasite and lose 20 pounds with
out so much as a "wear your rubbers
dear" and here some girl flies from L A.
to San Francisco and she's Eric the Red.
Yeah, she's fine. Yeah, we packed the
Kon-Tiki in the trunk like you said. Yeah,
she's well-dressed as usual. Yeah, OK, so
she's cute. Yeah, all the guys were staring
at her and not me.
Let's take this outside.
What to do? I panicked. Listen to
Spanish radio? Yep, we love that. Tour
the bathroom? Wow, it's so cool how big
it is. Hang out in my room waiting for the
cute guy down the hall with Spanish
skills to meander down to dinner? But of
course.

Piece of cake.
Then someone brought it to my atten
tion that the normal 15-year-old girl just
wants an innocent romance to remember
after her trip. A romance? But who would
go for a size three teenager with big hair
and penciled-in lips? Who would not mind
the language barrier, the risk of judicial
wrath based on U.S. statutory rape laws?
Who would have no qualms in treating my
little Jovanella to a romantic evening for
two with minimal kissing and no more?
So I caught you on that last one, did I?
You are a sicko. I know it. You're all
lurking out there just to get your grubby
paws on my little Jova. Trying to profane
the beauty and purity that is my 15-year
old child. You mock and insult me with
your lecherous thoughts. May a donkey
gnaw on your testicles for eternity.
So we stayed home and talked. We
took walks to the Bookstore. We pressed
our empty wallets against the windows of
the boutiques of the rich and famous at
the Stanford Shopping Center. We
danced salsa, discussed the butts of men
in the dorm and complained about our
paltry shoe collections.

Damn, I lost one glass slipper.
Midnight, ordering Domino's against
my moral code. Breakfast, letting her
drink Coke as one of the four major
preservative groups, not knowing any bet
ter. Seven p.m., chasing down funky dorm
pasta with chocolate-covered almonds.
Bonding through gastric distress, I began
to break the bonds of bitch-hood.
She was cute, she was perky, but she
was my little girl. I let her sleep in my
bed. I let her use my semi-name-brand
shampoo. I did the unthinkable — I let
her borrow my clothes.
Mommy's little girl.
And yesterday I had to leave her alone
in the room. Experiencing all the terrors
of motherhood at 21. She was all alone
with the cheesy Spanish radio djs. All
alone when with magazine vending pre
teens banging at the door. All alone on
the way to the dining hall at dinner. All
alone potentially with that cute guy down
the hall. That's my girl.
It's a very faint ticking.

MATERNAL INSTINCTS, don't
fail me now. My biological clock
does not tick. My biological clock
does not tock. My biological clock plays
Parcheesi with god begging for more
time, just a little bit more, to give me a
chance to hit that ma-too-re stage they
show you Disney movies about in fifth
grade.
I am 21, count 'em 21 years old. Twen
ty-one years of impy spriteliness. Twenty
one years of pretending I'm a one-eyed
fairy on warm summer nights when the
white out smells just so and the gasoline
caps are in bloom. Twenty-one years of a
complete lack of rude comment control and
incessant wide-load jokes about women
who have the potential to date anyone in
the male species I find attractive.
Now, now, that isn't very nice.
So last week I had a coronary. I almost
saw god in her celestial light. I almost
turned myself in for my 15 overdue hon
ors thesis books. I almost, mind you
almost, decided an inter-dorm relation
ship would not spawn gossip of any kind
if kept discreet.
Just say no.

I was given the news. The show was
over. Life as I knew it, all the fun with
dryer sheets and Kraft Singles in the
dark, would never be the same frivolous
stroll through Candyland it once was. It
was straight to the Marsh mallow Swamps
for me — the end of the innocence, the
end of an era, the end of unlimited action
in my Sterling Quad inner room.
She's having a baby.
Cool your jets. Geez, didn't mean to
scare you like that. She's not having a
baby; she's having a visitor. A 15-year-old
visitor, mind you. A 15-year-old C-cupped
visitor from Nicaragua with good make
up sense. English, no. Beauty queen
material, yes.
For a week she would be visiting. A
whole week I would have to be manless. A
whole week I'd have to clean rotting
boxes of baking soda from my fridge. A
whole week I would have to share my
own personal space with someone of the
much younger, perkier persuasion. Cute
as a button. Waist like Scarlett O'Hara.
Skin as soft as a baby's backside.
I wanna be sedated.
But what was I gonna do with a 15-

year-old for a whole week? Play pool in
the Tresidder Game Room? lake long,
meaningful walks in the foothills dis
cussing Nicaraguan boys I did not know
