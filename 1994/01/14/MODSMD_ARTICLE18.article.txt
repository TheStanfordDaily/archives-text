## Hoopsters blitz Arizona State Women's squad drives Sun Devils into the deep blue sea, 113-61 
### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
For the Cardinal women's basketball
team, 40 minutes of action last night at
Maples Pavilion boiled down to one word
— domination.
Seizing control early and never leaving
the outcome in doubt, Stanford cursed
the Arizona State Sun Devils 113-61 and
opened its Pacific 10 Conference home
schedule in stunning fashion before a
modest crowd of 2,932.
Hitting 41 of 67 shots for an amazing

.612 percentage, the Cardinal (9-3, 2-1 in
the Pac-10) played all 12 active members
of its roster and saw seven players score
in double figures in running overmatched
ASU (2-8, 0-2) out of the gym.
"This is one of those few (easy) games
that you get in the Pac-10," said Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer, referring to
the conference's top-to-bottom strength.
Indeed, the Cardinal showed no signs
of the struggles it incurred in splitting its
first two Pac-10 games last week in Wash
ington, smothering the Sun Devils on
defense and taking advantage of ASU's
zone coverage to build a 21-4 lead in the
first seven minutes.
"1 was especially pleased with our
defense forcing turnovers and our shot
selection against the zone," VanDerveer
said.
The Cardinal created three of its 30
takeaways in the opening run, and, in
what would tell the story of the night,
connected on all three of its three-point
tries in that span.
Junior guard Kate Paye, starting in a
three-guard package with the return of
senior Christy Hedgpeth to the lineup,
knocked home two of those bombs in
front of the backpedalling Sun Devils.
Paye finished the evening with an incred
ible five treys in seven attempts and
amassed a career-high 17 points to go
along with a game-high eight assists and
three steals in just 21 minutes.
"I'm happy that they were playing
zone, because we're a good outside-shoot
ing team," Paye said.
How good? Stanford canned a cool 11-
of-18 from downtown, including six-for-six
in a second half during which the Cardinal
extended a 59-25 intermission advantage.
However, Stanford did not miss its
team goal of sustaining a high level of play
throughout the contest. Nearly doubling
up ASU at 36-19 with 5:30 remaining in
the first period, junior forward Rachel
Hemmer sparked a 23-6 Cardinal run to
close out the half. Hemmer netted six

points during the spurt, including a put
back lay up off one of her game-high eight
rebounds, en route to a game-leading 19
points as the Sun Devils lost any hope for
a possible comeback.
The punishment continued in the sec
ond stanza, as Stanford scored 18 of the
period's first 20 points and pushed the
margin to 50 points at 77-27 with 16 min
utes remaining. Paye contributed seven
in that stretch, while Hedgpeth kicked in
five of her 14 points and recaptured the
form and starting role she has held in pre
vious seasons.
Niki Sevillian, a senior guard who has
never enjoyed a starting role, also experi
enced a rare moment in the spotlight in
nine minutes of mop-up duty. Inserted
into the lineup at the end of the first half,
Sevillian quickly made her only field goal
attempt and hit two free throws. Then,
after the Cardinal hit the century mark
with over six minutes left in the game,
Sevillian banged in back-to-back three
pointers to make the score 111-50, the
largest Stanford's lead would grow.
"I just wanted to do it before I gradu
ated," Sevillian said of her career-high
10-point outing.
"Niki has a great attitude, and I'm
happy for her," added sophomore forward
Bobbie Kelsey, who came off the bench
for 13 points of her own.
There was plenty for which to be
happy on the Cardinal side of the coin, as
junior center Anita Kaplan and freshman
forward Kate Starbird (10 points apiece)
rounded out the double-figure barrage
and freshman point guard Jamila Wide
man dished out an impressive six assists.
On the other side, Sun Devil head
coach Jacqueline Hullah may have
summed up the evening best when, at the
end of her press conference, she turned to
the scribes and asked, "Any suggestions?"
None here, but the Cardinal hopes to
carry over some of its momentum when it
squares off with the Arizona Wildcats
tomorrow night at Maples.

The punishment continued in the sec
ond stanza, as Stanford scored 18 of the
period's first 20 points and pushed the
margin to 50 points at 77-27 with 16 min
utes remaining. Paye contributed seven
in that stretch, while Hedgpeth kicked in
five of her 14 points and recaptured the
form and starting role she has held in pre
vious seasons.
Niki Sevillian, a senior guard who has
never enjoyed a starting role, also experi
enced a rare moment in the spotlight in
nine minutes of mop-up duty. Inserted
into the lineup at the end of the first half,
Sevillian quickly made her only field goal
attempt and hit two free throws. Then,
after the Cardinal hit the century mark
with over six minutes left in the game,
Sevillian banged in back-to-back three
pointers to make the score 111-50, the
largest Stanford's lead would grow.
"I just wanted to do it before I gradu
ated," Sevillian said of her career-high
10-point outing.
"Niki has a great attitude, and I'm
happy for her," added sophomore forward
Bobbie Kelsey, who came off the bench
for 13 points of her own.
There was plenty for which to be
happy on the Cardinal side of the coin, as
junior center Anita Kaplan and freshman
forward Kate Starbird (10 points apiece)
rounded out the double-figure barrage
and freshman point guard Jamila Wide
man dished out an impressive six assists.
On the other side, Sun Devil head
coach Jacqueline Hullah may have
summed up the evening best when, at the
end of her press conference, she turned to
the scribes and asked, "Any suggestions?"
None here, but the Cardinal hopes to
carry over some of its momentum when it
squares off with the Arizona Wildcats
tomorrow night at Maples.
