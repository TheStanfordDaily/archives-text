# Stanford's Buffaloes?
## Game inspires mascot 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
The search for a more inspira
tional Stanford mascot may have
ended last night in Maples Pavilion.
Forget about the possible trade
mark infringement against a certain
Rocky Mountain school whom Bill
Walsh's men upset last September in
a premature climax to their season.
The (belated) submission for The
Daily's mascot contest was volun
teered by Jacqueline Hullah, the
head coach of Arizona State's
women's basketball team, as she
recounted her thoughts just prior to
the start of the game in which Stan
ford ran over her Sun Devils 113-61.
