# Stanford's Buffaloes?
## Game inspires mascot 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
The search for a more inspira
tional Stanford mascot may have
ended last night in Maples Pavilion.
Forget about the possible trade
mark infringement against a certain
Rocky Mountain school whom Bill
Walsh's men upset last September in
a premature climax to their season.
The (belated) submission for The
Daily's mascot contest was volun
teered by Jacqueline Hullah, the
head coach of Arizona State's
women's basketball team, as she
recounted her thoughts just prior to
the start of the game in which Stan
ford ran over her Sun Devils 113-61.
"When Stanford ran out onto
the court in warm-ups, they sound
ed like a herd of buffaloes," Hullah
said. "I told [Stanford head coach|
Tara |VanDerveer| 'I hope you're
not gonna run us off the cliff
tonight.' — I guess they did."
The agony of the Sun Devils'
death might have been mitigated
had they not played a zone defense
against the sharpshooting Buffalo
— sorry, Cardinal — women.
"I can't remember anyone who
has played a zone against us since
Texas Tech," VanDerveer said.
Because Texas Tech is ranked
fifth overall in the nation, while
Arizona State has the worst record
in the Pacific 10 Conference, the
outcomes of the common defensive
strategies should not come as a
surprise: Tech beat the Cardinal,
and the Sun Devils got beat.
But according to Hullah, the
makeup of her team forced them to
take their chances and play the
zone.
"We're a small team and we're
not a very good rebounding team,"
she said.
Arizona State's only hope was
that the Cardinal would have an off
night shooting over the zone from
the outside, but it was not to be.

Helped by six-for-six shooting
from three-point range in the sec
ond half, the Cardinal tallied 11
three-point field goals on the night,
one shy of a school record.
"What opens up a zone ... is
your three-point shooting," Van-
Derveer said.
Kate Paye's five treys for a
career-high 17 points led the long
range attack, while Niki Sevillian
contributed two three-pointers
after coming off the bench with
seven minutes, 47 seconds remain
ing in the game.
The bench was a definite bright
spot for the Cardinal women. All
12 available Cardinal players saw
action, as VanDerveer started
clearing the bench when her team
went up by 50 with 15:21 left to go
in the game.
Sixth man Bobbie Kelsey broke
out of her recent slump with 13
points in 22 minutes of playing
time.
"This was a really important
game for Kelsey ... She got back in
stride — we need her," VanDerveer
said.
Kelsey said that the game was
"a confidence-booster" for her, but
that she was even more pleased
with the way the entire team
played.
"We don't just need one or two
people stepping up. We need every
body stepping up like they did
tonight," Kelsey said.
