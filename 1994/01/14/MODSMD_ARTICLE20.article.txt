# Cardinal lets Devil get the best of it
## Red-hot men's basketball team stopped cold 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
In what would have been a comeback
story for the ages, the Stanford men's bas
ketball squad failed to provide a happy end
ing in last night's contest at Arizona State.
Trailing by 18 points at halflime, the Cardi
nal (9-3,2-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference) closed
the deficit to just six points before running out
of steam in the game's closing minutes.
Considering how strongly the Stanford
squad started the game, it seemed unlikely
that it would find itself in such a bleak situa
tion.
The Cardinal scored multiple fast-break
baskets on its first few possessions by out
maneuvering the full-court pressure defense
executed by the Sun Devils (6-5, 1-1).
Five minutes into the contest, Stanford
forward Dion Cross fed Andy Poppink for an
uncontested lay-up which broke a 7-7 dead
lock. Immediately following that play, fresh
man point guard Brevin Knight swiped the
ball from Arizona State's Ron Riley and led a
3-on-l attack which ended in a Brent
Williams basket.
With that, the Cardinal took an 11-7
advantage and appeared to be in fine shape at
the 14-minute mark.
Then things started getting ugly.
The Sun Devils hammered Stanford with
a barrage of three-pointers, shooting out to a
38-17 lead in a nine-minute span. While the
Cardinal offense turned ice-cold, as evi
denced by its first half field-goal percentage
of 26 percent, point guard Stevin Smith
ignited Arizona State with three treys in the
opening period.
"Smith just took advantage of our mis
takes," said Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery. "lie came down in transition situa
tions and shot uncontested threes. We just
turned it over and got mixed up in our
matchups and he was open."
Following the halftime break, a rejuvenat
ed Stanford squad scored the first two bas
kets of the period on a pair of Brevin Knight
lay-ups, sending a message to the Sun Devils
that the contest was far from over. Slowly,
but surely, the Cardinal plugged away at the
formidable deficit.
A Brent Williams three-pointer, two more
ferocious drives down the lane by Knight and
some scrappy defense keyed an 11-0 scoring
spurt for Stanford, cutting the lead to nine

with 13 minutes remaining.
The Cardinal's improved second-half play
served to rattle its opponent throughout the
period.
"You can't let up at this level," said Ari
zona State coach Rill Frieder. "You can't
get away from what works for you, and we
did that at the start of the second half.
There's no excuse for that, not at the col
lege level."
Stanford still wasn't finished. With less
than five minutes to play, Knight converted a
three-point play and Andy Poppink hit a
jump shot to make the score Sun Devils 60,
Cardinal 54.
However, Arizona State finally buckled
down and went on a 13-4 run, extinguishing
all the Cardinal's hopes of an improbable
comeback and a story-book finish.
The Cardinal will now head to Tucson,
where it will face No. 6 Arizona Saturday
night. The Wildcats, 98-93 losers to Califor
nia last night, are looking to get back on the
winning track by extending their 11-game
winning streak over Stanford.
