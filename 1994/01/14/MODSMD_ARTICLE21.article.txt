# Grapplers to wrestle the best at Aggie Open
## 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
The Stanford wrestlers head to
UC-Davis this weekend to compete
in the Aggie Open because, as Car
dinal head coach Chris Horpel said,
"There's nothing quite like live
combat when compared to prac
tice."
At this point in the season, the
Cardinal (2-2) is grabbing every
chance it can in order to gain expe
rience before the opening of the all
important Pacific 10 Conference

season in late February. And the
Cardinal hopes to make the most of
the opportunity provided by the
Aggie Open.
The tournament will feature
mostly California schools, includ
ing junior colleges such as Sacra
mento City and Modesto. Last year
the strongest competition came
from San Francisco State, Cal
Poly-SLO, Davis and Fresno State.
Horpel expects the tournament
to be smaller than the Country
Classic Open held last week, where
14 Cardinal wrestlers placed in the

top eight in their respective divi
sions. He estimated that each
weight should carry about eight
athletes.
Because it is an open tourna
ment, redshirts may compete with
out jeopardizing their remaining eli
gibility, as long as they are not affil
iated with their respective universi
ties. Horpel noted that much of the
competition at the tournament in
the past has come from redshirted
athletes. Of the 25 wrestlers the
Cardinal plans to bring, eight are
currently in their redshirt year.

The tournament also promises
to give experience to those non
starters who rarely compete, given
the selective nature of the sport.
"Most don't get a chance to
compete as oflen as they should,"
Horpel said. "This is a way to pre
pare the second-stringers just in
case the starter gets hurt ."
This potential situation is
unfortunately a commonplace
occurrence for the Cardinal this
season, as injuries have slowed
