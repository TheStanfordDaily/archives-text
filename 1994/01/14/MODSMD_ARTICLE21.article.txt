# Grapplers to wrestle the best at Aggie Open
## 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
The Stanford wrestlers head to
UC-Davis this weekend to compete
in the Aggie Open because, as Car
dinal head coach Chris Horpel said,
"There's nothing quite like live
combat when compared to prac
tice."
At this point in the season, the
Cardinal (2-2) is grabbing every
chance it can in order to gain expe
rience before the opening of the all
important Pacific 10 Conference

season in late February. And the
Cardinal hopes to make the most of
the opportunity provided by the
Aggie Open.
The tournament will feature
mostly California schools, includ
ing junior colleges such as Sacra
mento City and Modesto. Last year
the strongest competition came
from San Francisco State, Cal
Poly-SLO, Davis and Fresno State.
Horpel expects the tournament
to be smaller than the Country
Classic Open held last week, where
14 Cardinal wrestlers placed in the

top eight in their respective divi
sions. He estimated that each
weight should carry about eight
athletes.
Because it is an open tourna
ment, redshirts may compete with
out jeopardizing their remaining eli
gibility, as long as they are not affil
iated with their respective universi
ties. Horpel noted that much of the
competition at the tournament in
the past has come from redshirted
athletes. Of the 25 wrestlers the
Cardinal plans to bring, eight are
currently in their redshirt year.

The tournament also promises
to give experience to those non
starters who rarely compete, given
the selective nature of the sport.
"Most don't get a chance to
compete as oflen as they should,"
Horpel said. "This is a way to pre
pare the second-stringers just in
case the starter gets hurt ."
This potential situation is
unfortunately a commonplace
occurrence for the Cardinal this
season, as injuries have slowed
many key wrestlers. Following
this pattern, Tom Irwin (150 lbs.)
recently separated his shoulder in
practice, and By Pham (118) is
recovering from a knee injury.
The risk of injury is especially
troublesome because the athletes
gain vital experience during prac
tice sessions when "live
wrestling," versus practicing with
drills that do not involve direct
contact.
"Doing live wrestling is always
a chance (for injury), and I've got
a lot of athletes who want to take
that chance," Horpel said. "It's a
real catch-22 situation .. .
because we're good, we're getting
more injured."
On a more positive note, senior
co-captain Lance Johnson is
recovered from his hamstring
injury suffered over the holiday
vacation. He will be wrestling in
the 142-pound division rather
than at his typical 150 weight at
the open.
"I'm just experimenting with
it," Johnson said. "I want to see
where my body feels the best in
competition."
Although the Aggie Open is not
as large or competitive as other
early season tournaments in
which the Cardinal has competed,
Horpel views the opportunity the
Open provides as welcome. "This
is what we need right now. We're
a little banged up."
