# Post bowl-game depression?
## Stanford to host 69th Shrine game 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Now that two weeks have
passed since the final college foot
ball bowl game was played, and
with the Super Bow! yet another
two weeks away, fanatics near and
far are in a lull — call it bowl-game
withdrawal.
But fortunately for those
diehards residing in the Bay Area,
an all-star pigskin clash at Stan
ford Stadium awaits.
Seventy-two of the nation's best
collegiate seniors, including 16
First Team All-Americans, will
take the field tomorrow at 1 p.m. in
the 69th East-West Shrine Foot
ball Classic.
Players representing 51 schools
will display their talents for over
100 National Football League
Scouts, coaches and executives.
Among the participating players
are:
• Keith Elias, running back,
Princeton. Elias rushed for 1,731
yards this season and set four
NCAA Division I-AA records and
21 Princeton records in his career.
• Ken Alexander, inside line
backer, Florida State. Alexander
was the leading tackier on the
Seminoles' national championship
squad.
• Errict Rhett, running back,
Florida. Khett became the Gators'
all-time leading rusher this year,

breaking the school record previ
ously held by current Dallas Cow
boys' All-Pro Emmitt Smith.
• Todd Steussie, offensive tack
le, California. Steussie anchored
the Cal offensive line for four years
and was named as the Pacific 10
Conference's top offensive lineman
in 1993.
• Charles Johnson, wide receiv
er, Colorado. Stanford fans will get
the rare treat of seeing Johnson
shred a college secondary one more
time before heading to the pros.
Johnson is the only Colorado play
er in school history to have two
1,000 yard receiving seasons.
While no player from Stanford
was chosen for this year's contest,
both Stanford fans and followers of
Pac-10 football will see many
familiar faces on the West squad.
Quarterback Jeff Garcia of South
Bay rival San Jose State and out
side linebacker Hon Woolfork of
Colorado will make their second
appearances at Stanford Stadium
this year.
As for the Pac-10, players from
seven of the league schools will
take the gridiron: defensive line
man Shante Carver of Arizona
State; running back Lindsey Chap
man, center Eric Mahlum and
Steussie of California; defensive
lineman Romeo Bandison of Ore
gon; offensive tackle Vaughn Park
