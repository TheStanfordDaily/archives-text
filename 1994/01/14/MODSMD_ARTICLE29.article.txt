## MIT conducts study on cheating 
### 
A recent study on academic dishonesty at MIT
found that many incidents of cheating can be
attributed to a lack of communication between
teachers and students.
The study was prompted by an incident three
years ago in which 78 students in an engineering
course were penalized for cheating.
The study attempted to determine the extent of
the problem at MIT and to find out what consti
tutes and causes cheating. It also sought ways to
improve the situation.
The undergraduates, graduates and faculty
who were surveyed said they didn't feel there
was a cheating crisis at MIT or that there is
more cheating at MIT than elsewhere. Most said
they thought their peers were cheating, while
they wouldn't admit to having cheated them
selves.
In addition, students and faculty disagreed on
the seriousness of offenses such as collaborating
on homework.
The main cause of cheating that students cited
was work overload. Students said they often cheat
to keep from falling behind, not to get ahead. Con
trary to popular belief, the study showed that
those who cheat are often the students with lower
grades — not excellent students who will do any
thing to stay at the top.
Finally, the study reported that a lack of pub
licity surrounding cheating cases may increase
the problem. It said that informing the public

about the consequences of cheating could deter
future offenders.
Amherst computerizes exam
Amherst College last month joined a select num
ber of locations nationwide by offering the Gradu
ate Record Examination (GRE) on computers.
While the computerized GRE costs more and is
less accessible than the traditional test, it contains
several improvements. The exam is scored as soon
as it is completed, giving students the opportunity
to see their results before they decide to send the
information to graduate schools.
The new test is also a better measure of stu
dents' abilities. If a student answers a question
incorrectly, then it will be followed by an easier
problem. A correct answer will prompt a more
challenging question.
By 1997, the computerized test is expected to be
available nationwide on almost any day of the year,
and should completely phase out the current ver
sion.
In response to concerns about documented com
puter anxiety among women, Educational Testing
Services conducted studies which found that
females scored comparably to males, despite
greater nervousness at the beginning of the test.
The test requires only simple computer skills.
But the testing service included instructions on
computer use, which all students will read before
starting the test.
