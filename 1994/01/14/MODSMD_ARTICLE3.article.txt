In the celebration of Martin Luther King
Jr.'s accomplishments, Rev. Cecil Williams
took the civil rights leader's legacy a step
further last night at Kresge Auditorium
pushing the audience to follow King's ex
ample and help shape history, rather than
let history shape them.
Williams, a minister at Glide Memorial
Church in San Francisco, told the gather
ing of about 450 at the Martin Luther King
Jr. Commemorative Program to take con

carry on the spirit that King left with his
people.
"If Dr. King would walk through that

'Dr. King, your dream is still alive because

much about what's going on in the world
. . . but not King! Not Martin Luther King!"
Williams added that, in the process of be

culture and identity. He stressed that King
and his colleagues never sold out to the

pressures of fear and frustration that they
faced.
"Sometimes we pet caught up in the
broader scale of society and lose some sense
of who we are. Never lose a sense of identi

I can give to shape history."

spoke of the difficulties of consolidating all
ethnicities into one group because this can
dilute the richness of each culture. F urther-
