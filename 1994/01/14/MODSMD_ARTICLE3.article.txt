### José Jesus Gutierrez 
In the celebration of Martin Luther King
Jr.'s accomplishments, Rev. Cecil Williams
took the civil rights leader's legacy a step
further last night at Kresge Auditorium
pushing the audience to follow King's ex
ample and help shape history, rather than
let history shape them.
Williams, a minister at Glide Memorial
Church in San Francisco, told the gather
ing of about 450 at the Martin Luther King
Jr. Commemorative Program to take con

trol of what's affecting their lives and to
carry on the spirit that King left with his
people.
"If Dr. King would walk through that
door tonight, whom among us would say,
'Dr. King, your dream is still alive because
we have not turned back,' " Williams said.
Williams was introduced by Assoc. Dean
of Memorial Church Floyd Thompkins as
"one of the leading ministers of America."
I lejoined King in the March on Washington
in 1963.
In his address, Williams spoke of the ef

feet King had on his own life and the
African-American community.
"He brought out something »ve've al
ways had — spirit," Williams said. "King
took people out of categories and put them
on center stage. You must live your life dif
ferently. Some folks just don't want to do
much about what's going on in the world
. . . but not King! Not Martin Luther King!"
Williams added that, in the process of be
coming involved, one must never lose his
culture and identity. He stressed that King
and his colleagues never sold out to the

pressures of fear and frustration that they
faced.
"Sometimes we pet caught up in the
broader scale of society and lose some sense
of who we are. Never lose a sense of identi
ty. If I lose my blackness, then I've lost what
I can give to shape history."
Noting Stanford's diversity, Williams
spoke of the difficulties of consolidating all
ethnicities into one group because this can
dilute the richness of each culture. F urther-
more, he said people must
empower themselves not as part
of a melting pot, but as part of a
salad bowl, for everyone is differ
ent and contributes a unique per
spective.
"Don't let anyone cut you out.
When they come for you in the
morning, they'll come for the rest

at night. Don't miss the wake-up
call, and don't let anyone take lyour
identity) away from you," he said.
At the end of the program,
senior Dana Weeks, staff member
at the Black Community Services
Center, presented Williams with a
plaque for his contributions to the
black community.
In addition to William's
speech, the commemorative pro
gram included musical perfor
mances by Stanford's a cappella
group Talisman and the Stanford

Gospel Choir, and a dance perfor
mance by the Kuumba Dance
Ensemble.
Commenting on the program
and speech by Williams, Dean of
Students Michael Jackson said,
"The spirit was great, the singing
was inspiring, and the words of
Rev. Williams embodied the best
of Martin Luther King Jr. It
allows Stanford students to strive
for hope, justice and urges them
to share their gifts with those
who need and want it."
