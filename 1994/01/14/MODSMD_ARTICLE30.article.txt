# New oak to shade Mausoleum
## 
### Jason Waggoner 
Before the Founding Fathers, before Stanford's
founding president, before Gerhard Casper, for close
to 300 years, one mighty 70-foot oak loomed over
the present day site of the Stanford family's mau
soleum.
This oak ceased to exist on Aug. 30, 1993.
The cause of death was chainsawing due to bacte
rial disease.
Yesterday a replacement was planted, beginning
a new chapter in the site's history. A 15-foot coastal
live oak was transplanted from the Hetch Hetchy
reservoir research park to the spot where the old
mausoleum oak once stood. The new oak, according
to grounds manager Herb Fong, "should prove to be
a lovely specimen over time."
The transplanting process, which took about two

hours, required a two-man crew and a tree-moving
machine. In addition, the new oak was given an
updated irrigation system, additional cabling and
new mulch.
Fong said he was pleased with the move because
the groundskeepers only had to cut two roots. He is
optimistic about the tree's future because the soil
types of the old and new trees matched.
However, he intimated that the tree was not out
of the proverbial woods just yet. "If the leaves on the
tree do not drop and merely brown, the tree could
possibly be in trouble by June or July. It is essential
that leaves fall off the tree," Fong said.
He suggests that students avoid trying to help
along the natural pruning process essential to the
tree's life. "If you're going to climb on the tree, wait
another 100 years," says Fong.
The total cost of moving the tree was $700.
