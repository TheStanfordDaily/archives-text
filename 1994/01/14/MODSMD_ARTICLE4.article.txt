# Every day is MLK Day for King Papers editor Carson
##

Far from the intensity of the Quad and
the frenzy of White Plaza, Clayborne (-ar
son has an intensity and frenzy all his
own.
Carson is preparing for a speech as he
talks with two of his student researchers
about their work, while outsiders, one after
the other, demand a piece of his time.
" There really is no 'typical' day for me,"
Carson says, at ease in his office on the out
skirts of campus. "Many days are like this
— extremely busy."
In fact, this time of the year is even
busier than usual for the Stanford history
professor and senior editor of the Martin
Luther King Jr. Papers Project.
"I get a lot of requests to give speeches
and interviews around this time because of
the King Holiday," he says.
Today, it's Indiana. Next week, it's off to
New York, Michigan and a host of other
places.
With all of this, Carson, who is currently
on sabbatical, must still give attention to
the King Holiday celebrations at Stanford,
which include "A Celebration of the Life
and Legacy of Martin Luther King Jr.,"
based on Carson's play, "Passages of Martin
Luther King."

The program a dramatic presentation
of the words of King, Malcolm X, Stokely
Carmichael, Coretta Scott King, the Rev.
Martin Luther KingSr. and President John
F Kennedy - is based on research and doc
uments gathered during the King Papers
Project.
Carson's work on the Papers Project
began after a phone call late one night in
1985. On the other end of the line, Coretta
Scott King, the slain civil rights leader's
wife, asked him, a scholar of the Black Free
dom Movement, to edit the papers.
In 1992, Carson released the first volume
of the papers — titled "Called to Serve: Jan
uary 1929-June 1951" — which documents
King's life until age 22. Carson expects to
release the second volume in July and the
third in the fall of 1995.
The overall goal of the project is to pub
lish a 14-volume edition of King's most sig
nificant correspondences, sermons, speech
es, published writings and unpublished
manuscripts. Carson stresses that it is a
documentary project based on historical
record and not a biography.
While much media attention has focused
on charges that King plagiarized parts of his
doctoral dissertation, Carson says he hopes
the papers will spark interest in other areas
