# Every day is MLK Day for King Papers editor Carson
## 
### Cametra Thompson Staff writer 
Far from the intensity of the Quad and
the frenzy of White Plaza, Clayborne (-ar
son has an intensity and frenzy all his
own.
Carson is preparing for a speech as he
talks with two of his student researchers
about their work, while outsiders, one after
the other, demand a piece of his time.
" There really is no 'typical' day for me,"
Carson says, at ease in his office on the out
skirts of campus. "Many days are like this
— extremely busy."
In fact, this time of the year is even
busier than usual for the Stanford history
professor and senior editor of the Martin
Luther King Jr. Papers Project.
"I get a lot of requests to give speeches
and interviews around this time because of
the King Holiday," he says.
Today, it's Indiana. Next week, it's off to
New York, Michigan and a host of other
places.
With all of this, Carson, who is currently
on sabbatical, must still give attention to
the King Holiday celebrations at Stanford,
which include "A Celebration of the Life
and Legacy of Martin Luther King Jr.,"
based on Carson's play, "Passages of Martin
Luther King."

The program a dramatic presentation
of the words of King, Malcolm X, Stokely
Carmichael, Coretta Scott King, the Rev.
Martin Luther KingSr. and President John
F Kennedy - is based on research and doc
uments gathered during the King Papers
Project.
Carson's work on the Papers Project
began after a phone call late one night in
1985. On the other end of the line, Coretta
Scott King, the slain civil rights leader's
wife, asked him, a scholar of the Black Free
dom Movement, to edit the papers.
In 1992, Carson released the first volume
of the papers — titled "Called to Serve: Jan
uary 1929-June 1951" — which documents
King's life until age 22. Carson expects to
release the second volume in July and the
third in the fall of 1995.
The overall goal of the project is to pub
lish a 14-volume edition of King's most sig
nificant correspondences, sermons, speech
es, published writings and unpublished
manuscripts. Carson stresses that it is a
documentary project based on historical
record and not a biography.
While much media attention has focused
on charges that King plagiarized parts of his
doctoral dissertation, Carson says he hopes
the papers will spark interest in other areas

of the Black Freedom Movement
not commonly studied. In partic
ular, Carson cites King's father
and grandfather as "remarkable
historically" because of their
influence on the development of
the "social gospel."
In addition to providing a phe
nomenal historical record, the
Papers Project has given students
and staff at Stanford the chance
to be involved in every phase of
the process.
"It's a great honor to be doing
this work," says associate editor
Stewart Burns. "One of the
things that's exciting is uncover
ing and researching individuals
who weren't known outside of
their own circles, such as people
who were involved in the grass
roots struggles."
Burns, a historian and scholar
of American social movements,
says"the project wouldn't be here

if it weren't for (Carson). Coretta
Scott King chose him to do the
project, and she originally wanted
him to work in Atlanta."
But because Carson chose to
stay and do his research at Stan
ford, students such as senior
Mark Jeter, who worked with the
project for two years, get the
chance to study the civil rights
movement in-depth with tremen
dous resources.
"It was an invaluable experi
ence working with the whole
history [of the civil rights move
ment]," says Jeter, a mechani
cal engineering major. "Some
one might ask a question like,
'What was King doing on Octo
ber 21, 1951?' and we could find
out."
Burns describes the working
environment of the project as a
"cooperative workplace" and says
he enjoys working with Carson.
"He is a brilliant scholar. I've
always learned a lot from him,"
says Burns. "He's the ideal per
son to be the editor in terms of
scholarship because he has a

broad understanding of the Black
Freedom Movement."
Carson — who has written a
book about the Student Nonvio
lent Coordinating Committee,
compiled the FBI file of Malcolm
X, and co-edited a manual to the
"Eyes on the Prize" television
series — is currently working on
a chronology of African-Ameri
can history, a study of African-
American political thought and a
book about the Black Panther
Party.
Despite being able to pursue
his passion for the Black Freedom
Movement, Carson says the best
part of his job is "working closely
with students and interacting
with people."
Speaking about his work with
the Papers Project, Carson says
"part of what makes it really
interesting and worthwhile is
that we've succeeded in bringing
together people of all levels, all of
whom have talent and are dedi
cated."
Says Carson, "I love my job. I
would do it for free."
