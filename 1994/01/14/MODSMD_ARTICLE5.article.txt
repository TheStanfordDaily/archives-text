# Dean of H&S Shoven allays budget fears
## Few cuts for University's largest school 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences John Shoven sounded a note of re
assurance last night amid this week's clam
or over budget cuts.
At an ASSU town hall meeting that at
tracted fewer than a dozen students,
Shoven said he was "not predicting any
thing terribly dramatic" — in terms of cut
ting academic programs — as a result of the
University's effort to trim $18-20 million
from its budget in the next three years.
"I'd be surprised if the school's budget
was cut in excess of 1 percent," said Shoven,
adding that he expected no faculty positions
to be cut.
But he stressed that his school's affairs
are "certainly going to be adjusted" in both

administrative and academic respects.
"We want to look carefully to see
whether there aren't things that we're
doing that we shouldn't be doing any
more," he said.
Humanities and Sciences is Stanford's
largest school and has an annual budget of
approximately $119 million.
When the talk became more specific,
Shoven asserted that interdisciplinary pro
grams were relatively safe — even though
they have fewer faculty numbers — because
such programs generally do not cost very
much. He also said that some "ebb and
flow" among such programs was probably a
good thing, given changes in student and
faculty interest.
At the same time, Shoven talked about
finding "administrative efficien
cies" that could save money
across the University.
Citing advanced foreign litera
ture classes that only had one or
two students, Shoven said that
combining the smaller foreign lit
erature departments into one
department was something he
was "definitely interested in look
ing at and beginning to knock
some heads together on." Such an
action would likely result in a
handful of staff layoffs, he said.
Shoven also said he is "con
cerned about the age structure of
the faculty" and said retirement
incentives for older faculty and
increased resources for younger
faculty would be seriously consid
ered.
Dismissing worries that budget

cuts would hurt minority recruit
ment efforts, Shoven said that at
least within the School of Human
ities and Sciences, "if anything,
we're going to add resources" to
recruitment efforts, especially for
minority graduate students.
And he said that "fears (about
budget cuts) are probably exag
gerated," adding that all propos
als would come out in a "draft
form with plenty of room for dis
cussion and suggestions."
"We don't plan to do anything .
. . in secret," he said.
Shoven said his goal was to
have a first draft ready for the
beginning of spring quarter. He
also plans to present a "State of
the School" address on April 21,
and to make final decisions
regarding the budget in May.
"While we want lots of discus
sion and also lots of listening,
things also need to be done differ
ently than last time," he said,
explaining that the large number

lots of listening, things also need to be done

of committees overseeing the
major cuts in 1991-92 resulted in
"by and large across-the-board
cuts, and nothing very innovative."
In his talk last night, Shoven
also sought to reassure students
that ethnic centers wiil not be
"singled out" for cuts. "I don't
think [ethnic center cuts] will be
disproportionate," he said.
Council of Presidents member
Jason Snyder, who arranged the
meeting, afterward stressed the-
COP's role as a "sounding board"
for University officials to get stu
dent perspective on budget cuts.
"Our approach is to meet regular
ly with University officials who

are making the budget decisions,"
Snyder said.
He admitted that specifics had
really not been discussed so far in
meetings between the COP and
Provost Condoleezza Rice. But,
he added, "Our role is going to
intensify as the budget process
continues."
Yesterday afternoon, Vice
Provost and Dean for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds and her
senior staffers met with members
of the ASSU's Student Affairs
Committee to discuss proposed
cuts in Student Affairs.
Committee chair Mork Mur
dock said the committee was

given "complete information as
far as the budget-cutting priori
ties up to this point," including
the cost-cutting proposals that
Edmonds will submit to Provost

Condoleezza Rice this weekend.
Murdock, who refused to dis
cuss the proposals, said the com
mittee will provide "ongoing
input" to Edmonds and Rice.

Provost Condoleezza Rice. But,
he added, "Our role is going to
