University's effort to trim $18-20 million
from its budget in the next three years.
"I'd be surprised if the school's budget
was cut in excess of 1 percent," said Shoven,

doing that we shouldn't be doing any
more," he said.
Humanities and Sciences is Stanford's
largest school and has an annual budget of
approximately $119 million.
