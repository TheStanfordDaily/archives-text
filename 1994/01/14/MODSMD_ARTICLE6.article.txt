# Hospital budget to go under the fiscal knife
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Although Stanford Hospital maintains a
separate budget from the University, it still
faces the same kind of cuts.
According to Chief Operating Officer
Malinda Mitchell, the hospital plans to cut
about 5 percent, or about $23 million, from
its $440 million operating budget for the
next fiscal year.
Mitchell said the cuts, which she an
nounced last week, are part of an effort
begun five years ago to contain costs. And
they are at least partly in response to "man
aged care" programs that will probably be
part of the health care reforms proposed by
President Clinton, she said.
"Managed care is here," said Mitchell,
referring to the prevalence of programs im
plemented by major California insurance
companies to "give incentives to physicians
to hold down costs" by making contracts

with hospitals that are more competitive in
their prices.
But the cuts will not mean major
changes in the structure of the hospital,
Mitchell said. "It's fairly routine," she said.
"We've been doing this consistently for sev
eral years."
The program of budget cuts, named Op
erations Improvement, has already cut
about $50 million from the operating bud
get over the past five years. Mitchell said
the cuts began after revenue projections
from Medicare and insurance companies
fell short of budgeted expenses.
"Most of our projections were correct,"
she said.
Mitchell said she expects about $16.7
million of the cuts to be identified by task
forces looking to decrease each of the hospi
tal's 14 departments' costs by ordering
fewer supplies. Another $6.3 million is ex-
pected to be sliced from adminis
trative savings, she said.
Mitchell said "a number of
jobs" will be lost due to the cuts,
but she did not know any

specifics. Since about 50 percent
of the hospital's budget is per
sonnel, job losses are nearly
impossible to avoid, she said.
Attrition will account for
some, but not all, of the job loss
es, Mitchell said. She added that
a cross-training program allows
some laid-off employees to be
retrained to work in different
areas.

The hospital will attempt to
save an additional $2.5 million
by changing "physician practice
patterns," which means reducing
redundancy and improving effi
ciency, Mitchell said. The prob
lems stem mainly from"the way
medicine is practiced. The sys
tems really aren't designed for
efficiency."
Mitchell said the cuts are part

of a national trend, citing a sur
vey of hospital administrators in
which more than half the respon
dents said they were planning to
reduce hospital costs and 25 per
cent planned to cut costs by at
least 25 percent.
In addition to reducing the
operating budget, Mitchell said
the hospital will continue to seek
new revenues by finding "new

things we can do for the patient
population that we have."
In the past, people involved in
the budget-cutting process have
come up with suggestions for
ways to enhance revenues that
have been quite successful,
Mitchell said, such as a program
to provide in-patient psychologi
cal care during the day rather
than on an overnight basis.

In addition, Mitchell said she
doesn't see an end to the budget
cutting in the near future. Until
the future of health care is clear,
she said, the hospital will have to
continue to be cautious, and will
be reducing its budget for at
least the next two or three years.
"A few people have |the cuts]
continuing for the next five
years."
