## LGBCC health series begins 
### Elissa Lee Staff writer 
The Lesbian, Gay, and Bi
sexual Community Center
kicked off its Winter Health
Series last night with a Safer
Sex and HIV/AIDS Educa
tion workshop.
Different weekly pro
grams designed specifically
for their community will con
tinue through the quarter,
addressing hoth physical and
mental health issues.
"We felt that our needs
were not being met by the
Stanford health advisers, and
we decided to take the initia
tive and educate ourselves,"
said Natasha Iskander, the
LGBCC staff member who
coordinated the Winter
Health Series.
According to Rosa de la
Vega, another staff member
who helped plan the series, it
is "geared |toward covering)
the broad spectrum of what
health is for us, and not just
the HIV/AIDS issue."
Topics for the various
workshops were determined
by the interests and concerns
of the lesbian, gay and bisex-
ual community at Stanford.
For example, after a commu
nity member experienced "gay
bashing," the LGBCC was asked
to address the issue and that
member's needs, de La Vega
said.
Programs on self-esteem, self
defense, men's and women's
health, and battery and abuse in
same-sex relationships were also
included at the request of mem
bers during informal interviews
conducted by community center
staff members.
The LGBCC has been planning

the series since the end of the
summer, with a working group in
the center working last quarter to
arrange speakers and donations
for the programs.
The costs of the series are
being covered by donations
received from the Haas Center for
Public Service, the Ho Fund, the
Student Initiatives Fund, the
Women's Health Care Commit
tee, the Sexual Assault Preven
tion Program and the Cowell Stu
dent Health Center.
Most of the speakers were
found within Stanford and the
Bay Area. The Women Defending
Ourselves Collective will lead one
of the self-defense workshops,
and Prof. Kate O'Hanlan from
the School of Medicine will speak

at the program on women's
health.
Although the community cen
ter is unsure of whether the series
will be duplicated in another
quarter, "the information pre
sented during the series will be
made into a health guide so that it
is available to the community and
will also serve as a legacy in case
the series is not continued," de La
Vega said.
According to Iskander, the
"Guide to Queer Health" will be a
compilation of all the information
from the series along with a list
ing of resources available in the
Bay Area. The LGBCC currently
plans to distribute the guide on
and off campus and to a number
of health resources.
