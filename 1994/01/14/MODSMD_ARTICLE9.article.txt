## Clinton, Yeltsin reaffirm mutual support Presidents vow to continue reforms in Moscow summit 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Joined in a historic quest to
expand democracy, President Clinton and Boris
Yeltsin pledged yesterday to press ahead with
reforms that will "make life better" for restive Rus
sians.
In hours of Kremlin talks and over a long, festive
dinner at Yeltsin's elegant country home, the two
leaders agreed that Russia could not afford to
backpedal on painful economic reforms despite
mounting public dissatisfaction.
"We'll work together," Clinton assured stolid
Muscovites lined up for bread in a downtown bakery.
"All these folks working hard need to know that in
the end they will be rewarded."
Welcoming Clinton to the opulent Grand Palace
at the Kremlin, Yeltsin predicted the three-day sum
mit would produce great results. Privately, he
assured Clinton "there is no turning back" from the
drive for free-market reforms, U.S. officials report
ed.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said
Americans were reassured that Russian leaders
were "redoubling their efforts to move forward with
the reform process," undeterred by the strong show
ing of anti-reform forces in recent parliamentary
elections.
Clinton brought no new gift basket of American
aid for his third face-to-face meeting with Yeltsin in
nine months, but he promised greater efforts to
deliver fast and effective assistance already in the
pipeline in an effort to cushion the economic pain for
ordinary Russians.
Asked if he wanted more U.S. aid, Yeltsin said,
"Not more than was promised already."
As part of his effort to mobilize broader support
for free-market reforms, Clinton brought together
influential Russians from a variety of fields and
political backgrounds for an evening reception at the
residence of the U.S. ambassador. Deliberately omit
ted from the guest list for the reception was ultra
nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a leader of
Yeltsin's foes.
"We need no help from the United States and the
West," Zhirinovsky sniped from the sidelines. "We
are a very rich country, very strong, very rich."
But in an indirect reference to the appeal of
Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist rhetoric, Clinton
warned, "The oldest of society's demons plague us
still, the hatreds of people for one another based on
their race, their religion, their ethnic group, even
the piece of ground they happen to have been born
on."
