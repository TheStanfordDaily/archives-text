LOS ANGELES — A violent
earthquake measuring 6.6 on the
Richter scale jolted most of
Southern California yesterday
morning, killing at least 30 peo
ple, injuring thousands and caus
ing several freeways and build
ings to collapse.
Although the San Fernando
Valley, 20 miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles, was the
hardest hit, the quake extended
everywhere — from 125 miles
south in San Diego to 275 miles
northeast in Las Vegas — caus
ing hundreds of millions of dol
lars in damage.
Fireballs from gas mains, as
well as falling concrete blocks and
broken water pipes added to the
destruction. More than 200,000
were left without water and near
ly 700,000 without electricity.
Gov. Pete Wilson dispatched
California National Guard troops
to the region and President Clin
ton declared Southern California
a federal disaster area, making
residents eligible for federal aid.
About half of those killed died
in a Northridge apartment build
ing whose first floor collapsed

when the earthquake hit at 4:31
a.m. yesterday.
The Northridge Meadows
apartment complex, which hous
es many students from the neigh
boring California State Universi
ty Northridge, was near the
quake's epicenter and became
the center of much of the city's
and media's attention as the fire
department attempted to pull the
approximately 15 dead bodies out
of the wreckage.
Frightened residents and
neighbors watched for hours out
side the apartment building. "I
was on the third floor — well.
