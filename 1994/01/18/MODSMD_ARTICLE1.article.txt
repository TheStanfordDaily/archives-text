# 6.6 quake rocks Los Angeles
## At least 30 killed, thousands injured; vast damage as pre-dawn temblor wreaks havoc on San Fernando Valley Destruction in L.A. costly, widespread 
### Juthymas Harntha Editorial staff with AP wire reports 
LOS ANGELES — A violent
earthquake measuring 6.6 on the
Richter scale jolted most of
Southern California yesterday
morning, killing at least 30 peo
ple, injuring thousands and caus
ing several freeways and build
ings to collapse.
Although the San Fernando
Valley, 20 miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles, was the
hardest hit, the quake extended
everywhere — from 125 miles
south in San Diego to 275 miles
northeast in Las Vegas — caus
ing hundreds of millions of dol
lars in damage.
Fireballs from gas mains, as
well as falling concrete blocks and
broken water pipes added to the
destruction. More than 200,000
were left without water and near
ly 700,000 without electricity.
Gov. Pete Wilson dispatched
California National Guard troops
to the region and President Clin
ton declared Southern California
a federal disaster area, making
residents eligible for federal aid.
About half of those killed died
in a Northridge apartment build
ing whose first floor collapsed

when the earthquake hit at 4:31
a.m. yesterday.
The Northridge Meadows
apartment complex, which hous
es many students from the neigh
boring California State Universi
ty Northridge, was near the
quake's epicenter and became
the center of much of the city's
and media's attention as the fire
department attempted to pull the
approximately 15 dead bodies out
of the wreckage.
Frightened residents and
neighbors watched for hours out
side the apartment building. "I
was on the third floor — well.

now it's the second floor," said
Marge Reichwaldt, who was wait
ing for a ride to a Red Cross shel
ter. "There was a lot of really bad
shaking."
Amid all the flying glass in her
apartment, "Everything fell down
except for one picture," she said,
"and that was the head of Christ
above my bed. He was watching
out for me.
"What happens tomorrow, I
don't know. I just want to get my
pictures. But at least I've got my
life," Reichwaldt said.
But safety was still uncertain
as aftershock after another —
several measuring more than 5.0
in magi|it|)cfc> t~ _ rattled through
the neighborhood.
"Stop it, that's enough!"
Reichwaldt's daughter Diana
screamed at the sky following an
aftershock strong enough to force
several people off balance.
Neighbors in the apartment
building across the street counted
themselves as lucky for escaping
major damage.
"We didn't know about [the
Northridge Meadows' damage]
until 15 minutes later," said one
resident. "This woman came over
and said the whole thing had col
lapsed, and I thought she was
crazy."
Though her apartment was a
mess and she was afraid of the
aftershocks, the woman planned
to stay in her home for the night.
"I've been through six earth
quakes," she said, "so this didn't
seem too bad."
For the firemen who were
pulling people out of the downed
apartment building, the situation
was also fairly routine. "That's
what we're trained to do," said
Mike Burns, a Los Angeles Coun

ty Fire Department captain who
was supervising the third physical
search team to go into the col
lapsed building.
Though many residents of the
damaged area were planning to go
to local shelters for the night, the
ones whose houses did not suffer
extensive damaged pitched tents
and got their barbecues ready on
their front lawns.
The Ie family, who live across
the street from the demolished
Northridge Fashion Center, said
they were shocked when they
came out and saw the damage
that had struck the mall.
A Bullock's department store
had completely fallen in, as well
as the three-story parking garage,
which trapped a maintenance
worker in the rubble.
"We just felt lucky that our
house is stronger than Bullock's,"
said Mrs. le.
"We're going to tent out for a
couple of nights," said her son
Raymond. "It's a safe neighbor
hood."
Others just a few blocks away
from the les, however, were not
so sure about their safety.
"My mother just redecorated
her house," said Lorraine Watson
of Westwood, who came to help
her parents. "There's nothing
left. She's 80, blind and retarded
and is living on my father's
retirement. My father is going to
defend his property tonight with
a baseball bat. There are only pic
tures and their polyester
clothes."
Several other residents of the
blocks surrounding the
Northridge Meadows Apartments
— which was teeming with
reporters, firemen, curious
onlookers as well as four satellite
dishes — were also on the defen
sive last night, putting up barri
cades of trash cans and cement
blocks to prevent trespassers and
possible looters from entering.

"No one is paying any atten
tion to the neighborhoods," Wat
son said. "The police are only pay
ing attention to [the Northridge
Meadows Apartments]. Some of
the neighbors are armed. Other
people gave up. Everything is
wide open."
Six people were arrested in
downtown Los Angeles for loot
ing, as well as an undetermined
number in the valley.
Two enterprising men decided
to take advantage of the situation
legally, albeit opportunistically,
by selling high-powered batteries
at a street corner.
Lumber stores were also mak
ing a mint from the many busi
ness owners from almost every
city street who bought plywood to
board up their shattered win
dows.
Adding to the general confu
sion was the lack of street and
traffic lights throughout most of
the valley, darkening through
ways and turning many streets
into four-way stop-sign intersec
tions.
To prevent further damage,
Wilson and Mayor Richard Rior
dan declared states of emergen
cies. Riordan also instituted a
dusk-to-dawn curfew in Los
Angeles to protect "life and prop
erty."
But this didn't prevent people
from driving to the closest open
supermarket last night to stock
up on supplies for the next few
days. At a Hughes market in
Granada Hills, a line of about 150
eager customers stretched around
the store.
People were allowed in two or
three at a time for about five min
utes each while construction
workers started fixing the crum
bling roof above the aisles.
"I've been waiting for nearly
two hours," said a man who
declined to say any more because
he didn't want to miss his turn in
the store.
"There are other stores open,"
said Kathy Faulkner, a shelther
worker waiting to buy cold cuts.
"But they're all a long wait."
By about 6:30 p.m., about 200
people had already made their
way into a makeshift shelter at
the darkened Granada Hills High
School in Grenada, according to a
Red Cross official.
Flashlights in hand, people
huddled around their cars listen
ing simultaneously to the news,
while others waited around for
the limited supply of food, water
and blankets.
Among these were several
CSUN students who were forced
to leave campus after the quake
caused the library and adminis
tration buildings to collapse. Fires
began in two science buildings,
which officials said contained
radioactive material.
"The dorms were not stable,
said sophomore Dennis Strang.
"My room just lost its founda
tions."
Though Strang — who planned
to spend the night at the shelter
though he had relatives nearby —
was excited at the prospects of an
adventure, his fellow students
were worried about what the
damage to the university meant
to their academic careers.
"I cannot have this semester
canceled," said freshman Huong
Dinh. "It's going to totally screw
up my financial aid."
"I'll stay around to see if they
keep the classes on, or else I'll just
go back to my school in Minneso
ta," said junior Dawn Chris

tensen, an exchange student at
CSUN.
Though CSUN is not in ses
seion until Jan. 31, about half of
the 3,000 students who live on
campus had returned early to the
dormitories. All of them were
evacuated to nearby shelters or
friends and relatives.
Other fatalities caused by the
quake included: a Los Angeles
police officer who was killed
when his motorcycle fell off a
broken freeway overpass, a
women who broke her neck when
she slipped and hit her head on a
baby crib, a 5-year old boy
crushed in his Sherman Oaks
home and five quake-related
heart attacks.
The freeway damage, though,
is going to be hardest for South
ern California commuters to deal
with. Five interstates and three
state highways — including
Interstate 5, California's prima
ry north-south route — were
closed at several points after the
quake, causing major traffic
problems on traffic-lightless side
streets
Homes and commercial build
ings were also destroyed. In
Granada Hills, a new nine-story
building collapsed, as well as
parts of the Granada Hills Com
munity Hospital, which treated
more than 1,000 patients last
night. About 44 homes in Slymar,
which was the epicenter of a 1971
earthquake that killed 65, were
destroyed by fires caused by the
earthquake.
The earthquake also derailed a
64-car freight train, which spilled
sulfuric acid from one of its
tankers between the areas of
Chatsworth and Northridge. Haz
ardous materials crews are clean
ing up the leak.
Though Van Nuys airport was
the only airport to suffer signifi
cant damage, the Federal Avia
tion Administration closed Los
Angeles International Airport for
about two hours as a precaution.
Several other airports in the area
were also temporarily closed.
The last big earthquake to hit
Southern California was the Lan
ders quake in June 1992, which
measured 7.6 on the Richter scale
and was followed by a 6.7 quake
in the Big Bear area a few hours
later.

LOS ANGELES — A violent
earthquake measuring 6.6 on the
Richter scale jolted most of
Southern California yesterday
morning, killing at least 30 peo
ple, injuring thousands and caus
ing several freeways and build
ings to collapse.
Although the San Fernando
Valley, 20 miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles, was the
hardest hit, the quake extended
everywhere — from 125 miles
south in San Diego to 275 miles
northeast in Las Vegas — caus
ing hundreds of millions of dol
lars in damage.
Fireballs from gas mains, as
well as falling concrete blocks and
broken water pipes added to the
destruction. More than 200,000
were left without water and near
ly 700,000 without electricity.
Gov. Pete Wilson dispatched
California National Guard troops
to the region and President Clin
ton declared Southern California
a federal disaster area, making
residents eligible for federal aid.
About half of those killed died
in a Northridge apartment build
ing whose first floor collapsed

when the earthquake hit at 4:31
a.m. yesterday.
The Northridge Meadows
apartment complex, which hous
es many students from the neigh
boring California State Universi
ty Northridge, was near the
quake's epicenter and became
the center of much of the city's
and media's attention as the fire
department attempted to pull the
approximately 15 dead bodies out
of the wreckage.
Frightened residents and
neighbors watched for hours out
side the apartment building. "I
was on the third floor — well.

now it's the second floor," said
Marge Reichwaldt, who was wait
ing for a ride to a Red Cross shel
ter. "There was a lot of really bad
shaking."
Amid all the flying glass in her
apartment, "Everything fell down
except for one picture," she said,
"and that was the head of Christ
above my bed. He was watching
out for me.
"What happens tomorrow, I
don't know. I just want to get my
pictures. But at least I've got my
life," Reichwaldt said.
But safety was still uncertain
as aftershock after another —
several measuring more than 5.0
in magi|it|)cfc> t~ _ rattled through
the neighborhood.
"Stop it, that's enough!"
Reichwaldt's daughter Diana
screamed at the sky following an
aftershock strong enough to force
several people off balance.
Neighbors in the apartment
building across the street counted
themselves as lucky for escaping
major damage.
"We didn't know about [the
Northridge Meadows' damage]
until 15 minutes later," said one
resident. "This woman came over
and said the whole thing had col
lapsed, and I thought she was
crazy."
Though her apartment was a
mess and she was afraid of the
aftershocks, the woman planned
to stay in her home for the night.
"I've been through six earth
quakes," she said, "so this didn't
seem too bad."
For the firemen who were
pulling people out of the downed
apartment building, the situation
was also fairly routine. "That's
what we're trained to do," said
Mike Burns, a Los Angeles Coun

ty Fire Department captain who
was supervising the third physical
search team to go into the col
lapsed building.
Though many residents of the
damaged area were planning to go
to local shelters for the night, the
ones whose houses did not suffer
extensive damaged pitched tents
and got their barbecues ready on
their front lawns.
The Ie family, who live across
the street from the demolished
Northridge Fashion Center, said
they were shocked when they
came out and saw the damage
that had struck the mall.
A Bullock's department store
had completely fallen in, as well
as the three-story parking garage,
which trapped a maintenance
worker in the rubble.
"We just felt lucky that our
house is stronger than Bullock's,"
said Mrs. le.
"We're going to tent out for a
couple of nights," said her son
Raymond. "It's a safe neighbor
hood."
Others just a few blocks away
from the les, however, were not
so sure about their safety.
"My mother just redecorated
her house," said Lorraine Watson
of Westwood, who came to help
her parents. "There's nothing
left. She's 80, blind and retarded
and is living on my father's
retirement. My father is going to
defend his property tonight with
a baseball bat. There are only pic
tures and their polyester
clothes."
Several other residents of the
blocks surrounding the
Northridge Meadows Apartments
— which was teeming with
reporters, firemen, curious
onlookers as well as four satellite
dishes — were also on the defen
sive last night, putting up barri
cades of trash cans and cement
blocks to prevent trespassers and
possible looters from entering.

"No one is paying any atten
tion to the neighborhoods," Wat
son said. "The police are only pay
ing attention to [the Northridge
Meadows Apartments]. Some of
the neighbors are armed. Other
people gave up. Everything is
wide open."
Six people were arrested in
downtown Los Angeles for loot
ing, as well as an undetermined
number in the valley.
Two enterprising men decided
to take advantage of the situation
legally, albeit opportunistically,
by selling high-powered batteries
at a street corner.
Lumber stores were also mak
ing a mint from the many busi
ness owners from almost every
city street who bought plywood to
board up their shattered win
dows.
Adding to the general confu
sion was the lack of street and
traffic lights throughout most of
the valley, darkening through
ways and turning many streets
into four-way stop-sign intersec
tions.
To prevent further damage,
Wilson and Mayor Richard Rior
dan declared states of emergen
cies. Riordan also instituted a
dusk-to-dawn curfew in Los
Angeles to protect "life and prop
erty."
But this didn't prevent people
from driving to the closest open
supermarket last night to stock
up on supplies for the next few
days. At a Hughes market in
Granada Hills, a line of about 150
eager customers stretched around
the store.
People were allowed in two or
three at a time for about five min
utes each while construction
workers started fixing the crum
bling roof above the aisles.
"I've been waiting for nearly
two hours," said a man who
declined to say any more because
he didn't want to miss his turn in
the store.
"There are other stores open,"
said Kathy Faulkner, a shelther
worker waiting to buy cold cuts.
"But they're all a long wait."
By about 6:30 p.m., about 200
people had already made their
way into a makeshift shelter at
the darkened Granada Hills High
School in Grenada, according to a
Red Cross official.
Flashlights in hand, people
huddled around their cars listen
ing simultaneously to the news,
while others waited around for
the limited supply of food, water
and blankets.
Among these were several
CSUN students who were forced
to leave campus after the quake
caused the library and adminis
tration buildings to collapse. Fires
began in two science buildings,
which officials said contained
radioactive material.
"The dorms were not stable,
said sophomore Dennis Strang.
"My room just lost its founda
tions."
Though Strang — who planned
to spend the night at the shelter
though he had relatives nearby —
was excited at the prospects of an
adventure, his fellow students
were worried about what the
damage to the university meant
to their academic careers.
"I cannot have this semester
canceled," said freshman Huong
Dinh. "It's going to totally screw
up my financial aid."
"I'll stay around to see if they
keep the classes on, or else I'll just
go back to my school in Minneso
ta," said junior Dawn Chris

tensen, an exchange student at
CSUN.
Though CSUN is not in ses
seion until Jan. 31, about half of
the 3,000 students who live on
campus had returned early to the
dormitories. All of them were
evacuated to nearby shelters or
friends and relatives.
Other fatalities caused by the
quake included: a Los Angeles
police officer who was killed
when his motorcycle fell off a
broken freeway overpass, a
women who broke her neck when
she slipped and hit her head on a
baby crib, a 5-year old boy
crushed in his Sherman Oaks
home and five quake-related
heart attacks.
The freeway damage, though,
is going to be hardest for South
ern California commuters to deal
with. Five interstates and three
state highways — including
Interstate 5, California's prima
ry north-south route — were
closed at several points after the
quake, causing major traffic
problems on traffic-lightless side
streets
Homes and commercial build
ings were also destroyed. In
Granada Hills, a new nine-story
building collapsed, as well as
parts of the Granada Hills Com
munity Hospital, which treated
more than 1,000 patients last
night. About 44 homes in Slymar,
which was the epicenter of a 1971
earthquake that killed 65, were
destroyed by fires caused by the
earthquake.
The earthquake also derailed a
64-car freight train, which spilled
sulfuric acid from one of its
tankers between the areas of
Chatsworth and Northridge. Haz
ardous materials crews are clean
ing up the leak.
Though Van Nuys airport was
the only airport to suffer signifi
cant damage, the Federal Avia

building collapsed, as well as
parts of the Granada Hills Com
munity Hospital, which treated
more than 1,000 patients last
night. About 44 homes in Slymar,
which was the epicenter of a 1971
earthquake that killed 65, were
destroyed by fires caused by the
earthquake.
The earthquake also derailed a
64-car freight train, which spilled
sulfuric acid from one of its
tankers between the areas of
Chatsworth and Northridge. Haz
ardous materials crews are clean
ing up the leak.
Though Van Nuys airport was
the only airport to suffer signifi
cant damage, the Federal Avia
tion Administration closed Los
Angeles International Airport for
about two hours as a precaution.
Several other airports in the area
were also temporarily closed.
The last big earthquake to hit
Southern California was the Lan
ders quake in June 1992, which
measured 7.6 on the Richter scale
and was followed by a 6.7 quake
in the Big Bear area a few hours
later.

LOS ANGELES — A violent
earthquake measuring 6.6 on the
Richter scale jolted most of
Southern California yesterday
morning, killing at least 30 peo
ple, injuring thousands and caus
ing several freeways and build
ings to collapse.
Although the San Fernando
Valley, 20 miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles, was the
hardest hit, the quake extended
everywhere — from 125 miles
south in San Diego to 275 miles
northeast in Las Vegas — caus
ing hundreds of millions of dol
lars in damage.
Fireballs from gas mains, as
well as falling concrete blocks and
broken water pipes added to the
destruction. More than 200,000
were left without water and near
ly 700,000 without electricity.
Gov. Pete Wilson dispatched
California National Guard troops
to the region and President Clin
ton declared Southern California
a federal disaster area, making
residents eligible for federal aid.
About half of those killed died
in a Northridge apartment build
ing whose first floor collapsed

when the earthquake hit at 4:31
a.m. yesterday.
The Northridge Meadows
apartment complex, which hous
es many students from the neigh
boring California State Universi
ty Northridge, was near the
quake's epicenter and became
the center of much of the city's
and media's attention as the fire
department attempted to pull the
approximately 15 dead bodies out
of the wreckage.
Frightened residents and
neighbors watched for hours out
side the apartment building. "I
was on the third floor — well.

Meadows apartment complex In Northridge yesterday afternoon.
Fifteen people died when the building collapsed.
now it's the second floor," said
Marge Reichwaldt, who was wait
ing for a ride to a Red Cross shel
ter. "There was a lot of really bad
shaking."
Amid all the flying glass in her
apartment, "Everything fell down
except for one picture," she said,
"and that was the head of Christ
above my bed. He was watching
out for me.
"What happens tomorrow, I
don't know. I just want to get my
pictures. But at least I've got my
life," Reichwaldt said.
But safety was still uncertain
as aftershock after another —
several measuring more than 5.0
in magi|it|)cfc> t~ _ rattled through
the neighborhood.
"Stop it, that's enough!"
Reichwaldt's daughter Diana
screamed at the sky following an
aftershock strong enough to force
several people off balance.
Neighbors in the apartment
building across the street counted
themselves as lucky for escaping
major damage.
"We didn't know about [the
Northridge Meadows' damage]
until 15 minutes later," said one
resident. "This woman came over
and said the whole thing had col
lapsed, and I thought she was
crazy."
Though her apartment was a
mess and she was afraid of the
aftershocks, the woman planned
to stay in her home for the night.
"I've been through six earth
quakes," she said, "so this didn't
seem too bad."
For the firemen who were
pulling people out of the downed
apartment building, the situation
was also fairly routine. "That's
what we're trained to do," said
Mike Burns, a Los Angeles Coun

ty Fire Department captain who
was supervising the third physical
search team to go into the col
lapsed building.
Though many residents of the
damaged area were planning to go
to local shelters for the night, the
ones whose houses did not suffer
extensive damaged pitched tents
and got their barbecues ready on
their front lawns.
The Ie family, who live across
the street from the demolished
Northridge Fashion Center, said
they were shocked when they
came out and saw the damage
that had struck the mall.
A Bullock's department store
had completely fallen in, as well
as the three-story parking garage,
which trapped a maintenance
worker in the rubble.
"We just felt lucky that our
house is stronger than Bullock's,"
said Mrs. le.
"We're going to tent out for a
couple of nights," said her son
Raymond. "It's a safe neighbor
hood."
Others just a few blocks away
from the les, however, were not
so sure about their safety.
"My mother just redecorated
her house," said Lorraine Watson
of Westwood, who came to help
her parents. "There's nothing
left. She's 80, blind and retarded
and is living on my father's
retirement. My father is going to
defend his property tonight with
a baseball bat. There are only pic
tures and their polyester
clothes."
Several other residents of the
blocks surrounding the
Northridge Meadows Apartments
— which was teeming with
reporters, firemen, curious
onlookers as well as four satellite
dishes — were also on the defen
sive last night, putting up barri
cades of trash cans and cement
blocks to prevent trespassers and
possible looters from entering.

"No one is paying any atten
tion to the neighborhoods," Wat
son said. "The police are only pay
ing attention to [the Northridge
Meadows Apartments]. Some of
the neighbors are armed. Other
people gave up. Everything is
wide open."
Six people were arrested in
downtown Los Angeles for loot
ing, as well as an undetermined
number in the valley.
Two enterprising men decided
to take advantage of the situation
legally, albeit opportunistically,
by selling high-powered batteries
at a street corner.
Lumber stores were also mak
ing a mint from the many busi
ness owners from almost every
city street who bought plywood to
board up their shattered win
dows.
Adding to the general confu
sion was the lack of street and
traffic lights throughout most of
the valley, darkening through
ways and turning many streets
into four-way stop-sign intersec
tions.
To prevent further damage,
Wilson and Mayor Richard Rior
dan declared states of emergen
cies. Riordan also instituted a
dusk-to-dawn curfew in Los
Angeles to protect "life and prop
erty."
But this didn't prevent people
from driving to the closest open
supermarket last night to stock
up on supplies for the next few
days. At a Hughes market in
Granada Hills, a line of about 150
eager customers stretched around
the store.
People were allowed in two or
three at a time for about five min
utes each while construction
workers started fixing the crum
bling roof above the aisles.
"I've been waiting for nearly
two hours," said a man who
declined to say any more because
he didn't want to miss his turn in
the store.
"There are other stores open,"
said Kathy Faulkner, a shelther
worker waiting to buy cold cuts.
"But they're all a long wait."
By about 6:30 p.m., about 200
people had already made their
way into a makeshift shelter at
the darkened Granada Hills High
School in Grenada, according to a
Red Cross official.
Flashlights in hand, people
huddled around their cars listen
ing simultaneously to the news,
while others waited around for
the limited supply of food, water
and blankets.
Among these were several
CSUN students who were forced
to leave campus after the quake
caused the library and adminis
tration buildings to collapse. Fires
began in two science buildings,
which officials said contained
radioactive material.
"The dorms were not stable,
said sophomore Dennis Strang.
"My room just lost its founda
tions."
Though Strang — who planned
to spend the night at the shelter
though he had relatives nearby —
was excited at the prospects of an
adventure, his fellow students
were worried about what the
damage to the university meant
to their academic careers.
"I cannot have this semester
canceled," said freshman Huong
Dinh. "It's going to totally screw
up my financial aid."
"I'll stay around to see if they
keep the classes on, or else I'll just
go back to my school in Minneso
ta," said junior Dawn Chris

tensen, an exchange student at
CSUN.
Though CSUN is not in ses
seion until Jan. 31, about half of
the 3,000 students who live on
campus had returned early to the
dormitories. All of them were
evacuated to nearby shelters or
friends and relatives.
Other fatalities caused by the
quake included: a Los Angeles
police officer who was killed
when his motorcycle fell off a
broken freeway overpass, a
women who broke her neck when
she slipped and hit her head on a
baby crib, a 5-year old boy
crushed in his Sherman Oaks
home and five quake-related
heart attacks.
The freeway damage, though,
is going to be hardest for South
ern California commuters to deal
with. Five interstates and three
state highways — including
Interstate 5, California's prima
ry north-south route — were
closed at several points after the
quake, causing major traffic
problems on traffic-lightless side
streets
Homes and commercial build
ings were also destroyed. In
Granada Hills, a new nine-story
building collapsed, as well as
parts of the Granada Hills Com
munity Hospital, which treated
more than 1,000 patients last
night. About 44 homes in Slymar,
which was the epicenter of a 1971
