## Clinton announces 'empowerment zones' 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Marking
Martin Luther King Day, President
Clinton said yesterday the slain civil
rights leader would be pained to know
his country had done so little to bring
peace to its streets. He suggested King
would ask, "How come this is so?"
Clinton, who has been accused by
some civil rights activists, of talking
more than acting, also used the King
holiday to announce the start of an
"empowerment zone" community
development program and to sign an
executive order on housing discrimi
nation.
In a speech to a predominantly
black audience at Howard University,
Clinton saluted King as the nation's
premier voice "for human rights and
human potential."
And if King were still alive, Clinton
said, he would be asking why there was

not more action to stop violence and to
bring together people who are afraid of
and alienated from one another.
"It is our duty to continue the
struggle that is not yet finished," the
president said. "We will never do this
unless we create the ways and means
for people to choose a peaceful and
hopeful life."
"We've got a lot of walls, still, to
tear down in this country. This is not a
problem of race. This is a problem of
the American family. We'd better get
about solving it as a family," he said.
Earlier yesterday, Clinton
announced his administration was
beginning to select economically dis
tressed areas where businesses will be
eligible for tax breaks and other new
special government assistance.
In all, the government will desig
nate nine "empowerment zones" and

95 "enterprise communities." The
program, approved by Congress last
year as part of Clinton's budget plan,
is designed to make inner cities and
some impoverished rural areas more
attractive for business investment.
A year ago, Clinton, then the presi
dent-elect, told an audience at Howard
University that he hoped to redeem
King's promise of equal opportunity.
But some civil-rights activists con
tend Clinton instead has moved their
cause to a back burner. They say he
abandoned civil rights in trying to
steer clear of "liberal" issues and cut
the risk of alienating mostly white,
suburban voters.
"I haven't seen him promote any
thing," said New York activist A 1
Sharpton. "Clinton is like an old
James Brown record: talking loud and
saying nothing."

And some were put off by Clinton's
address in November, when he stood
in the Memphis, Tenn., pulpit where
King gave his last speech before being
killed in 1968. Clinton said there that
King would be appalled to see today's
rampant black-against-black violence.
Roger Wilkins, a longtime civil
rights activist and now professor of
history at George Mason University in
Fairfax, Va., said Clinton failed to fol
low that speech with action.
"It's despicable for the president
not to offer a jobs program when he
offers all this gratuitous advice on our
behavior," Wilkins said.
Clinton conceded yesterday there
was much work to be done, but he
defended his own record. He said he
has five black Cabinet members and
the bulk of his nominees for federal
judgeships are minorities.
