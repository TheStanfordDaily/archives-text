# Los Angeles Earthquake
## Students fear for families, homes L.A. residents worry, remain hopeful about quake's damages 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
For the second time this year, Stan
ford students from the Los Angeles area
watched and worried helplessly yester
day as another disaster wreaked havoc
on the city.
Only a few months after wildfires
destroyed large parts of the Southland,
L.A. residents were again forced to deal
with misfortune when an earthquake
measuring 6.6 on the Richter scale
struck the area at 4:31 a.m. yesterday.
For Stanford students unable to get
through to family and friends, the worst
part was not knowing what had hap
pened to their loved ones.
"I couldn't get through to my family —
other relatives told me they were OK," said
sophomore Jean Chung, who comes from
Northridge, the epicenter of the earth
quake. "I was worried because I didn't
know if they were all right or not and I was

watching all these places I recognize topple
and collapse. It was unnerving."
With phone lines either down or
jammed with people trying to get through
to the area, other students also waited to
hear from their families yesterday. Many
said they spent most of their morning
playing what senior Vanessa Tapia, who
also comes from Northridge, called "ring
around-the-phone."
"Mv first reaction was freaking out,
because 1 thought the problem was much
bigger than it really was," said sophomore
Molly Phelps, who lives in nearby North
Hollywood. "It's almost worse up here
because we don't know what's going on."
Hut once the waiting was over, most of
the students found that their families were
safe and that damage to their homes was
not serious.
"Our house sustained minor damage
— broken windows, falling dishes and
our swimming pool no longer has any
water in it," said senior Jay Lee, a

Northridge resident. "But no one got
hurt."
Phelps and Lee both said it was hard to
watch the destruction on television,
knowing they could not go to L.A. to help
their families.
"I wanted to be with my family," said
Phelps, who went so far as to make air
plane reservations home until her father
told her to stay at school. "It feels weird
not knowing what's happening, when
your loved ones are going through this
and you can't help."
Despite the destruction, some students
said they believe the problem is not as bad
as what was shown on the nearly continu
ous coverage of the quake's after-effects.
"What they're showing on TV is pretty
much the exception. It's sad [ that] people
got hurt, but it's not going on every
where," said Lee, who added that the tim
ing of the quake was "perfect" since very
few people were on the road so early on
the morning of a major holiday.
