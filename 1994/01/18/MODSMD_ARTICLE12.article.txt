# Quake leaves freeways in shambles
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — In seconds,
the powerful earthquake snapped
Southern California's lifeline: the free
way system that keeps the car-depen
dent region in gear.
Five interstates, including the
state's major north-south route, and
three state highways were closed at
several points after yesterday's esti
mated 6.6-magnitude quake collapsed
overpasses and ramps and buckled
roadway.
"You're talking about millions and
millions of vehicles and travelers that
will be impacted," said Jim Drago,
spokesman for the California Depart
ment of Transportation.
Since the 1989 San Francisco quake,
the state has been trying to strengthen
older freeways by reinforcing bridge
supports. The state was planning to

seek bids next month for performing
that work on the Santa Monica Free
way portion of Interstate 10, one of the
highways damaged bv Monday's quake,
Drago said.
All the damaged freeways had previ
ously had steel cables added to help
secure their bridges, said Caltrans
spokesman Steve Saville. That pro
gram was begun after the 1971 Sylmar
quake.
Transportation officials said the
exact nature of yesterday's freeway
failures has yet to be determined.
After the San Francisco quake, the
state compiled a list of 900 top-priority
bridges in need of reinforcement. About
a third of the projects have been com
pleted or are under way in the $1 billion
effort.
"What we've done over four years

has, quite frankly, been monumental,"
Drago said. "Obviously, when anybody
is hurt or killed, it's not enough."
In a region that has largely snubbed
mass transit in favor of the car, and has
only fledgling subway and rail systems,
the quake's blow is vicious. Commuters
already cope with routinely jammed
freeways; now the fragile balance is
undone.
Drago said his agency's first job is to
examine every structure within a 50-
mile radius of the quake's epicenter.
Where possible, state officials will seek
emergency contracts to restore traffic
levels as soon as possible.
"Our people have ultimate authority
out there. If they notice a condition
that's potentially dangerous, they will
close it," Drago said. "We're going to
proceed as quickly as we can."
