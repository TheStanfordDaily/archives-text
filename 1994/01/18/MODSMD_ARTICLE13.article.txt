# An eerie homecoming
## A
						former Northridge resident views the quake's destruction 
### John Hall Editorial Staff 
-11:39 a.m. — The newsradio announc
er's warning was appropriate and brief:
"Do not, if at all possible, go down there. "
We got a kick out of that as we dodged
cops on the way to SFO.
Northridge is not my parents' home
any more. Dad's defense job disappeared;
he and Mom and my sister moved to Vir
ginia this September, and my brother
started his freshman year at Cal. So two
weeks ago we spent our first Christmas
in a new house, and tried to enjoy it. 1
even called it "home." Afler all, Mom
said, the important thing is that everyone
should be together. She's right of course.
But I can't shake the feeling that my
home is in Ixjs Angeles, and yesterday's
trip to the earthquake epicenter with a
couple Daily staffers taught me why.
3:07 p.m. — The eternal KNX advised:
"By all means, stay off the freeways."
Already zooming up the 405 towards
the Valley, we laughed — a little.
Playing navigator, 1 spotted an
upcoming overpass and quickly veered
onto the surface streets. It had never
dawned on me how helpful electricity was
for traffic. Without traffic signals, Reseda
Boulevard was an infuriating knot. As we
were getting a little anxious to see some
real earthquake damage, 1 ducked out of
traffic into the secret parking lot behind
the AAA. Kmpty. The morbid rubber
neckers must be non-locals, I thought.
We footed to the earthquake-damaged
apartment building that had dominated
the radio since noon, and . . . well, rub
bernecked. There really wasn t anything
else to be done.
Yards of yellow tape cordoned off
dozens of firetrucks and scores of fire

fighters from the crowd. Behind this bar
rier, the men were carrying a body
through the rubble — someone who lived
there. Had lived there, and might have
been a student at Cal State Northridge.
Half my high school class had ended up
there. I found 1 really wasn't interested
in asking questions for The Daily. I just
stood there — with everyone else.
Just as the body disappeared into the
coroner's van, the ground began to roll
beneath us. The aftershock came gently,
and rustled a noise from the palm trees
lining the street. looking up, 1 suddenly
noticed how warm the wind was here,
and how different it was from Stanford. I
started to smile, but caught myself. 1
shouldn't be eryoying this. I turned away,
and led the other two Daily people back to
the car for the next photo op.
The mall where I had spent Friday
nights throughout my teenage years was
a flattened spectacle. My mind balked at
the number of hours my friends and I
had spent inside. Given that the entire
population of Northridge visited it week
ly, giving thanks for the quake's early
morning and holiday timing seemed in
order. A missing worker was given up for
dead. He was later found and rescued.
1 needed to see whether my best
friend's house was damaged. But resi
dents of her neighborhood feared looters,
and had begun to seal ofT their streets
with anything they could find: garbage
dumpsters, cinder blocks from collapsed
walls, their own cars.
A man had taken it upon himself to
stop traffic from entering the area, and
confronted me as I drove up. "Dude," I
said. "1 live over there on Gledhill."
"Dude" was because I wanted him to
know 1 understood him, and the rest was
because I wanted him to know my stake
in the place was as big as his. On the sur

face, it was a lie. Underneath, it was abso
lutely true. Her house was fine.
Needing to phone The Daily, we
dropped in on another friend's family.
Their phone had been out of order all day,
and they hadn't been able to reach their
son at Santa Clara to let him know that
they were okay. I assured them I would
call him when I got back to Stanford.
Taking off in search of a working
phone, I pulled a two-minute detour to
see my old house. I thought it was going
to be some huge emotional moment. . . .
Nothing. Just a house that 1 knew pretty
well with some new strange people in it.
6:21 p.m. — KNXstated. "The mayor has
issued a dawn-to-dusk eurfew for all non
emergency and non-military personnel."
I had no intention of enlisting, so we
headed to the local high school where the
Red Cross had set up a shelter and was
parceling out water, milk, bread and
those little weenies that you always see in
the canned food aisle but don't know who
eats them. Given that my entire daily
intake had consisted of a quarter of a Kit
Kat bar and a little bag of peanuts from
the plane, 1 really wanted to take just a
little. But I couldn't.
I settled for talking to some of the
small groups that huddled around pale
fluorescent lanterns in the dark. Many of
them feared the unseen damage to their
homes, but I sensed most just wanted to
talk to other people.
We had to get to the airport, so I hunt
ed around for the other two, trying to
pick them out of the void by their voices.
As we walked out into the eerie unlighted
streets, I felt the warm breeze that I had
noticed earlier, and looked up, above the
darkened city.
For the first time in my life, I saw
stars above the Valley.
