# After the quake: Fires ablaze
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” The violent
shaking stopped, then the fires began to
rage.
More than 12 hours after the terrify
ing California earthquake ended yester
day morning, its destruction continued.
City and county fire department
spokesmen said the number of blazes
caused by the quake probably won't be tal
lied for days.
"It has been crazy. The only thing I
know is that from 4:30 this morning until
10 this morning we had over a thousand
calls, for fires and other incidents," said
Hob Collis, spokesman for the City Eire
Department.
In the first hour after the quake, be
tween 30 and 50 separate fires raged in
the area, City Eire Battalion Chief Roger

Gillis said.
Ruptured gas and oil lines caused
most of the fires. Some houses, knocked
off their foundation by the first jolt, slid
farther and broke fuel lines when after
shocks struck later in the day
By late afternoon, 147 broken pas
lines had been reported, said Denise
King, a spokeswoman for the Gas Co.
In Granada Hills shortly after the
quake, there was a strange and scary
scene.
As water from a burst water main
flowed down a residential street, gas
spewed up from a broken pipe and burned
above the rapids, shooting plumes of flame
25 feet into the air
The flames quickly ignited a string of
houses along the street.
