## Editorial A 						matter of choices Administrators have to consider academics in current budget cutting 
### 
PROVOST Condoleezza Rice,
among others, has called bud
geting in the 1990s a series of
"tough choices." Gone are the cor
pulent days of the past decade when
universities could add new pro
grams and additional administra
tors at will; "restructuring" and
"downsizing" are the new catch
phrases.
At Stanford that's painfully clear.
Eyeing an $18 million to $20 million
shortfall over the next three years,
administrators have acted quickly
to revisit the painful process of bud
get cuts. Administrative units have
been asked to submit plans to cut 15
percent to 30 percent of their bud
gets over the next three years.
Those plans were due on the
provost's desk during the weekend.
But while the administration is
slashed, the University's academic
areas will likely remain relatively
unscathed. Dean of Humanities and
Sciences John Shoven has said he
would be surprised if his school's
budget is cut by more than 1 per
cent. In fact, academic units have
not been given a firm deadline or
specific targets for cuts.
Although it is a wise move to not
hurry academic cuts, Rice and Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
must force academic units to under
go a wholesale re-examination as
well. Budget cuts in the last three
years have sliced $60 million from
the University's budget, resulting in
across-the-board, trim-all-the-fat
cuts in both academics and the
administration. Now Stanford
stands poised to lose appendages.
And an administration-only focus
is too myopic.
At Stanford, the administration
isn't just nameless desk workers.
Student services, like Residential
Education and undergraduate
advising, fall under the "adminis
tration." So do staff members,
maintenance, multicultural pro

grams, libraries and countless other
services students, staff and faculty
take for granted every day. And cuts
in these areas can adversely impact
the quality of a Stanford education
in the same way broad academic
cuts can.
Thomas Day, the president of San
Diego State University, told the New
York Times recently that large cuts
in university administration are fre
quently irresponsible. "Some people
argue if you want to cut 25 percent
of the faculty, then cut 25 percent of
the administration. But you can't do
that. In the administration you
have one president, four vice presi
dents and eight deans. Do you want
to cut the dean of arts and sciences?
The director of student health? Or
the director of security? When you
stop and think about it, you realize
it isn't that simple."
In the coming months, Stanford's
budget planners should scrutinize
academic units with the same inten
sity they plan for administrative
areas. Schools shouldn't squeak
though the budget process by merg
ing small departments and eliminat
ing a few staff positions. Dead wood
should be identified and chopped.
Stanford's greatness depends on
administrators' ability to make
tough decisions. Undoubtedly, call
ing for academic cuts won't endear a
new president and provost to some
faculty members, but the fairest
and most constructive solution to
our budget malady may necessitate
such an approach.
In addition, budget planners
would be well served to expand their
processes of soliciting input from
the community.
Last week's rally by students
involved in ethnic centers demon
strated the misconceptions and fear
that surrounds this process. And
the uncertainty extends beyond stu
dents. As any staff member will
attest, morale is low and apprehen
sion is high.
Stanford's budget planners have
the unenviable task of trying to mol
lify many diverse interests. But if
they are really going to make "tough
choices," they must leave no stone
unturned.
