## Can we argue about race? 
### 
I «JLIST DON'T understand because I
am white. This is what I was told last
week by a woman of color. Aside
from the fact that I am not white, I
found this accusation especially unrea
sonable. We have reached a new low in
our discourse on this campus when indi
viduals from various groups, minority
and non-minority, claim a special status
which denies understanding and argu
ment by others.
As my anecdote illustrates, this claim
to special status, which I call personal
irrefutability, is blatantly hypocritical.
Individuals from a particular ethnic or
national group will claim that others can
not understand them, but yet these same
individuals will proceed to speak about
the thoughts and motivations of people
from other backgrounds. When I had my
run-in with the woman mentioned
above, she was saying that I could not
understand her, but that she could
understand me. According to her,
because my skin color is light I am nec
essarily deficient on minority issues. By
this line of logic, I have no right to
address her arguments and motivations,
but she has the prerogative to attack my
thoughts. This is nothing more than a
sheltering of one's controversial posi
tions from debate.
I am not saying that I will ever know
exactly what it is like to live as women
of color in a society where racial and gen
der prejudice is very real. Just the same,

I will never know exactly what it is like to
live as a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant
from the Midwest. However, I do feel that
I can learn to understand the circum
stances and thoughts of both, and conse
quently criticize many of their controver
sial actions. The logic applies to both
sides of the equation — if people of color
are going to protest the behavior of those
with white skin color, then whites have a
right to question the actions of minority
groups. If a person of color is making a
valid argument on a particular issue,
then he or she must be willing to defend
his or her position.
Not only is the claim of personal
irrefutability hypocritical and illogical, it
is also counterproductive. As a society we
can and must learn to understand each
other. If we all assert a special status
which prohibits anyone else from claim
ing to understand our thoughts and moti
vations, then we cannot live together as
one community. Claims of special status
inevitably lead to separatism, and ulti
mately grave inter-group conflict. Just
look at the number of ethnic wars in the
world today. Sure, groups are likely to
gravitate toward different positions on
various issues, but ultimately the func
tioning of a society is grounded upon a
basic common consciousness.
In America, we are not many different
groups who cannot understand one
another. Instead, we are all Americans
who must continue to work to under

stand each other. This is the role of edu
cation — why it is important for individ
uals to take courses about different cul
tures, to learn different languages, and to
visit different places. It is because we can
understand each other that these activi
ties are worthwhile.
I fear that we have become a lazy, nar
row-minded society. While not everyone
would argue for personal irrefutability
based upon race, very few people, espe
cially the activists on this campus, are
willing to consider anything but the
interests of their particular ethnic, eco
nomic, or gender group. This is the easy
way out, similar to the method used by
theorists who simply exclude problematic
data from their empirical analyses.
In this sense, I think we have taken a
step backward from 1968. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. never would have told
me that I could not understand his claims
because of the color of my skin. Civil dis
obedience worked because those who
were not black could understand. King
was a great man because he spoke to men
and women of all backgrounds. For King
we could all live together because we are
all God's children.
