## Dangers of smoking marijuana must not be downplayed 
### 
ON NOV. 10, an article titled "The
dope on pot: Marijuana smokers —
don't worry, be happy" appeared in
the Science section of The Daily. We feel
the author of the article, Chris Patil, has
minimized, and in some cases ignored, a
significant body of literature that has
demonstrated dangers associated with the
use of marijuana. Our main concern is
that readers of the article may be left
with the misleading impression that mar
ijuana is not a dangerous drug. Although
we would agree that the signs of physical
and psychological dependence on marijua
na may be more subtle and insidious than
those of "harder drugs," we caution
against underestimating marijuana's
potential for addiction and the negative
consequences of both casual and regular
marijuana use.
• Casual Use. The dangers associated
with the casual use of marijuana are less
clearly defined than the consequences of
long-term regular use. However, even
casual use may result in adverse effects.
Today's marijuana is much more potent
than that available in the 1960s, and con
tains about five times more THC (the
psychoactive ingredient in marijuana).
Many casual marijuana users will experi
ence idiosyncratic intoxification effects
including paranoia, feelings of deperson
alization, nausea and anxiety.
More predictable effects of marijuana
intoxication include short-term memory
and concentration problems, distorted
perceptions of space and time, and impair
ment in psychomotor performance. Clear
ly, marijuana use impairs a person's abili
ty to perform everyday tasks such as driv
ing a car and studying for a class. Another
potential negative repercussion of mari
juana use is the legal consequence of being

caught with a controlled substance.
• Regular Use. Patil's assertion that
marijuana is relatively safe (i.e., "It's not
going to kill you, it's not going to addict
you, and it's not going to make you
stupid.") is potentially dangerous because
it is based primarily on the controversial
areas of research. This focus minimizes
the extent of the known harmful physical
and psychological sequelae of chronic
marijuana use including physical addic
tion, increased risk for pulmonary dis
ease, neuropsychological complications,
sexual/reproductive problems and a wide
range of psychological symptoms.
Marijuana is a physically addictive
drug. Patil acknowledges that marijuana
smokers develop tolerance, a hallmark
sign of physical dependency. Other signs
of physical dependency include withdraw
al symptoms following the abrupt cessa
tion of regular use. After the "high" from
the drug subsides, the regular marijuana
user, whose body chemistry has adapted
to the effects of marijuana, will experi
ence withdrawal symptoms. Because mar
ijuana is a lipid-soluble drug (i.e. stored in
fat), withdrawal symptoms are often
long-lasting as the THC is slowly released
from fat stores. Withdrawal symptoms
include anxiety, depression, disturbed
sleep and appetite, irritability, tremors,
perspiration, nausea, muscle convulsions
and restlessness.
Recent controlled studies have found
that chronic marijuana use can cause air
way injuries, lung inflammation, and
impaired pulmonary defenses against
infection. In addition, evidence suggests
marijuana smoking may be associated
with an increased risk of the development
of respiratory tract cancer. This may
relate to the fact that marijuana contains,

in higher concentrations, many of the
known carcinogens present in tobacco.
The neuropsychological consequences
of chronic marijuana use are also signifi
cant. Although it is controversial {is to
whether marijuana causes structural dam
age to the brain, there is ample evidence
that chronic marijuana use is associated
with cognitive deficits. During chronic use
of the drug, as well as during withdrawal,
there fire cognitive deficits including
impairments in short-term memory, con
centration and abstract reasoning. These
mental abilities are especially critical to
individuals in an academic setting, the pri
mary audience of Patil's essay.
The popular myth that marijuana (and
other drugs) enhances sexual perfor
mance and satisfaction is strongly contra
dicted by clinical studies' evidence. In
fact, marijuana use is associated with
decreased sexual desire in both men and
women. Marijuana intoxication produces
difficulty in achieving and maintaining an
erection in men and the absence of
orgasm in women. In men, there may be
reduced fertility secondary to lower
sperm count and testosterone levels. In
women, chronic marijuana use may
result in abnormal menstruation and fail
ure to ovulate.
A variety of psychiatric symptoms are
associated marijuana use. Marijuana has
been popularized as a drug associated
with happiness, even euphoria. However,
investigations suggest the opposite. Many
studies have demonstrated that marijua
na initiates and sustains rather than alle
viates depression. Anxiety is commonly
produced from regular marijuana use.
Some people have found that chronic
marijuana use leads to personality
changes called the "amotivational syn-

drome." This syndrome is characterized
by decreased ambition and drive, lessened
motivation, shortened attention span,
derealization, depersonalization, poor
judgment, and increased distractibility.
Because the number of more method
ologically rigorous studies on the effects
of marijuana is still growing, some con
clusions, based on the whole literature,
are more suggestive than definitive. We
suggest that the public be cautious about
accepting pronouncements of "scientific
proof from proponents of extreme posi
tions. These extremes might be charac
terized on one end by the alarm ism of the
movie "Reefer Madness" and at the other
end by Patil's exhortation that marijuana
smokers should "not worry, be happy."
Although much research remains to be
done in this area, a thorough review of
the current literature tips the scale to the
side of caution.
As a last point, the use of any drug to
improve psychological functioning, even if
it is "physically safe," has profound impli
cations for personal growth and develop
ment. The idea that one should avoid the
full experience of life's pleasures and tra
vails — in effect "medicating" them — is
an unfortunate pro-drug cultural bias
that Patil's article propagates.

long-term regular use. However, even
casual use may result in adverse effects.
Today's marijuana is much more potent
than that available in the 1960s, and con
tains about five times more THC (the
psychoactive ingredient in marijuana).
Many casual marijuana users will experi
ence idiosyncratic intoxification effects
including paranoia, feelings of deperson
alization, nausea and anxiety.
More predictable effects of marijuana
intoxication include short-term memory
and concentration problems, distorted
perceptions of space and time, and impair
ment in psychomotor performance. Clear
ly, marijuana use impairs a person's abili
ty to perform everyday tasks such as driv
ing a car and studying for a class. Another
potential negative repercussion of mari
juana use is the legal consequence of being

caught with a controlled substance.
• Regular Use. Patil's assertion that
marijuana is relatively safe (i.e., "It's not
going to kill you, it's not going to addict
you, and it's not going to make you
stupid.") is potentially dangerous because
it is based primarily on the controversial
areas of research. This focus minimizes
the extent of the known harmful physical
and psychological sequelae of chronic
marijuana use including physical addic
tion, increased risk for pulmonary dis
ease, neuropsychological complications,
sexual/reproductive problems and a wide
range of psychological symptoms.
Marijuana is a physically addictive
drug. Patil acknowledges that marijuana
smokers develop tolerance, a hallmark
sign of physical dependency. Other signs
of physical dependency include withdraw
al symptoms following the abrupt cessa
tion of regular use. After the "high" from
the drug subsides, the regular marijuana
user, whose body chemistry has adapted
to the effects of marijuana, will experi
ence withdrawal symptoms. Because mar
ijuana is a lipid-soluble drug (i.e. stored in
fat), withdrawal symptoms are often
long-lasting as the THC is slowly released
from fat stores. Withdrawal symptoms
include anxiety, depression, disturbed
sleep and appetite, irritability, tremors,
perspiration, nausea, muscle convulsions
and restlessness.
Recent controlled studies have found
that chronic marijuana use can cause air
way injuries, lung inflammation, and
impaired pulmonary defenses against
infection. In addition, evidence suggests
marijuana smoking may be associated
with an increased risk of the development
of respiratory tract cancer. This may
relate to the fact that marijuana contains,

in higher concentrations, many of the
known carcinogens present in tobacco.
The neuropsychological consequences
of chronic marijuana use are also signifi
cant. Although it is controversial {is to
whether marijuana causes structural dam
age to the brain, there is ample evidence
that chronic marijuana use is associated
with cognitive deficits. During chronic use
of the drug, as well as during withdrawal,
there fire cognitive deficits including
impairments in short-term memory, con
centration and abstract reasoning. These
mental abilities are especially critical to
individuals in an academic setting, the pri
mary audience of Patil's essay.
The popular myth that marijuana (and
other drugs) enhances sexual perfor
mance and satisfaction is strongly contra
dicted by clinical studies' evidence. In
fact, marijuana use is associated with
decreased sexual desire in both men and
women. Marijuana intoxication produces
difficulty in achieving and maintaining an
erection in men and the absence of
orgasm in women. In men, there may be
reduced fertility secondary to lower
sperm count and testosterone levels. In
women, chronic marijuana use may
result in abnormal menstruation and fail
ure to ovulate.
A variety of psychiatric symptoms are
associated marijuana use. Marijuana has
been popularized as a drug associated
with happiness, even euphoria. However,
investigations suggest the opposite. Many
studies have demonstrated that marijua
na initiates and sustains rather than alle
viates depression. Anxiety is commonly
produced from regular marijuana use.
Some people have found that chronic
marijuana use leads to personality
changes called the "amotivational syn-

drome." This syndrome is characterized
by decreased ambition and drive, lessened
motivation, shortened attention span,
derealization, depersonalization, poor
judgment, and increased distractibility.
Because the number of more method
ologically rigorous studies on the effects
of marijuana is still growing, some con
clusions, based on the whole literature,
are more suggestive than definitive. We
suggest that the public be cautious about
accepting pronouncements of "scientific
proof from proponents of extreme posi
tions. These extremes might be charac
terized on one end by the alarm ism of the
movie "Reefer Madness" and at the other
end by Patil's exhortation that marijuana
smokers should "not worry, be happy."
Although much research remains to be
done in this area, a thorough review of
the current literature tips the scale to the
side of caution.
As a last point, the use of any drug to
improve psychological functioning, even if
it is "physically safe," has profound impli
cations for personal growth and develop
ment. The idea that one should avoid the
full experience of life's pleasures and tra
vails — in effect "medicating" them — is
an unfortunate pro-drug cultural bias
that Patil's article propagates.

ON NOV. 10, an article titled "The
dope on pot: Marijuana smokers —
don't worry, be happy" appeared in
the Science section of The Daily. We feel
the author of the article, Chris Patil, has
minimized, and in some cases ignored, a
significant body of literature that has
demonstrated dangers associated with the
use of marijuana. Our main concern is
that readers of the article may be left
with the misleading impression that mar
ijuana is not a dangerous drug. Although
we would agree that the signs of physical
and psychological dependence on marijua
na may be more subtle and insidious than
those of "harder drugs," we caution
against underestimating marijuana's
potential for addiction and the negative
consequences of both casual and regular
marijuana use.
• Casual Use. The dangers associated
with the casual use of marijuana are less
clearly defined than the consequences of
long-term regular use. However, even
