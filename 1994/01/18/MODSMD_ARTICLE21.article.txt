# N' Gai Croal: notes of a non-native son
## How to speak to a deaf University administration 
### 
MY MOTHER HASN'T spanked
me since I was about 12 years old,
so I ve forgotten what it feels like
for a weaker child to be picked up by a
much stronger adult, thrown over one
knee, and forcefully reminded of just who
is in charge. That is, until last Wednes
day s showdown between Stanford Uni
versity administrators and a thoroughly
unprepared Students of Color Coalition.
The thrashing that the SOCC leaders
experienced at the hands of Provost Con
doleezza Rice — during a forum billed as
"Fulfilling Stanford's Mission: The Gap
Between Rhetoric and Reality" —
brought those painful memories back.
At the forum, the SOCC repeated
many of its assertions and pleas from the
day before. Rice arrived late due to a prior
commitment, but late in no way meant
unprepared. She took the stage and easily
dismissed the SOCC, by delivering her
her well-worn speech on the University's
four sources of funds, explaining that
given our budget crunch, the only alter
natives were fundraising or cuts.
Having likely never read the Universi

ty Committee on Minority Issues report
or looked at last year's University budget,
the SOCC was in no position to debate
Rice on either multiculturaiism or Stan
ford's financial health. Clearly, a good
deal of planning — but very little think
ing — was put into last week's events.
Unfortunately, Rice showed no inter
est in finding a solution to the centers'
funding that did not involve budget cuts.
Rather than agree to work with the cen
ters to raise money or to educate them on
successful fundraising techniques, she
essentially called them naive. And as far
as including students in the budget pro
cess, her idea was for students to come up
with ways to do what she wants done: cut
15 percent to 30 percent of the budget.
Rice and President Casper may be
many things, but stupid isn't one of
them. Why are they risking a public rela
tions nightmare for a maximum savings
of $ 173,000 out of the $20 million that
they are trying to cut?
The answer has nothing to do with
savings, but everything to do with poli
tics. The University wants the centers to

focus solely on academics so that they
have no time to act politically. A depoliti
cized student body can't engage the
administration on such issues as the cur
riculum, tobacco stocks and Webb Ranch,
any of which could threaten the flow of
capital to Stanford from its alumni. All of
this from a president and provost who
urge all students to think critically.
Just not about how they do their jobs.
If he only understands the language of a
shotgun, get a shotgun. If he only under
stands the language of a rifle, get a rifle.
If he only understands the language of a
rope, get a rope. But don't waste time
talking the wrong language to a man if
you want to really communicate with
him. Speak his language.
—Malcolm X
First, let's deal with Dean of Students
Michael Jackson and Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Mary Fdmonds, who
claim to be advocates for students. They
don't work for us. They work for the
administration which pays their salaries.

Their job is to carry out budget cuts, peri
od.
Second, Rice has made it crystal clear
that the only input she will accept is
advice on how to meet her targeted cuts.
If we — all students — allow that to hap
pen to a relatively vocal group of stu
dents, clearly no student service is safe.
So if she only understands the lan
guage of the axe, by all means, let's give
her the axe. First, the SOCC must call for
a 12-month moratorium on cuts, during
which time it will raise enough money to
cover the shortfall. But Rice will probably
take a page from her former boss and
draw a line in the sand, hence the need
for phase two.
That would involve a publicity cam
paign designed to draw the attention of
major newspapers, magazines and televi
sion shows, billed as "How Stanford Uni
versity Punishes Students for its Indirect
Cost Scandal." At this time, students
should also call on top University admin
istrators, particularly Casper, Rice, Jack
son and Edmonds, to take a pay cut — of,
say 15 to 30 percent. I guarantee you,

important news media will pay attention.
Third, students should send letters to
alumni, corporate donors, recruiters,
admitted students, high school coun
selors, other universities and any college
rankings publications explaining why in
all conscience, they cannot recommend
Stanford University as a suitable institu
tion for higher learning. Perhaps at this
point, said administrators will dismount
from their high horses and do the right
thing by their paying customers.
But to do this, the SOCC and other
concerned students must shed the alba
tross of multiculturalism and expose this
crisis for what it really is: a student issue.
And above all, no rallies, no sit-ins, no
office takeovers — Bldg. 10 is already
conducting lockdown exercises, which
means that Stanford Police and legal staff
are already on alert. They don't under
stand the language of the past.
But they do understand the language
of the axe.

many of its assertions and pleas from the
day before. Rice arrived late due to a prior
commitment, but late in no way meant
unprepared. She took the stage and easily
dismissed the SOCC, by delivering her
her well-worn speech on the University's
four sources of funds, explaining that
given our budget crunch, the only alter
natives were fundraising or cuts.
Having likely never read the Universi

ty Committee on Minority Issues report
or looked at last year's University budget,
the SOCC was in no position to debate
Rice on either multiculturaiism or Stan
ford's financial health. Clearly, a good
deal of planning — but very little think
ing — was put into last week's events.
Unfortunately, Rice showed no inter
est in finding a solution to the centers'
funding that did not involve budget cuts.
Rather than agree to work with the cen
ters to raise money or to educate them on
successful fundraising techniques, she
essentially called them naive. And as far
as including students in the budget pro
cess, her idea was for students to come up
with ways to do what she wants done: cut
15 percent to 30 percent of the budget.
Rice and President Casper may be
many things, but stupid isn't one of
them. Why are they risking a public rela
tions nightmare for a maximum savings
of $ 173,000 out of the $20 million that
they are trying to cut?
The answer has nothing to do with
savings, but everything to do with poli
tics. The University wants the centers to

focus solely on academics so that they
have no time to act politically. A depoliti
cized student body can't engage the
administration on such issues as the cur
riculum, tobacco stocks and Webb Ranch,
any of which could threaten the flow of
capital to Stanford from its alumni. All of
this from a president and provost who
urge all students to think critically.
Just not about how they do their jobs.
If he only understands the language of a
shotgun, get a shotgun. If he only under
stands the language of a rifle, get a rifle.
If he only understands the language of a
rope, get a rope. But don't waste time
talking the wrong language to a man if
you want to really communicate with
him. Speak his language.

First, let's deal with Dean of Students
Michael Jackson and Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Mary Fdmonds, who
claim to be advocates for students. They
don't work for us. They work for the
administration which pays their salaries.

Their job is to carry out budget cuts, peri
od.
Second, Rice has made it crystal clear
that the only input she will accept is
advice on how to meet her targeted cuts.
If we — all students — allow that to hap
pen to a relatively vocal group of stu
dents, clearly no student service is safe.
So if she only understands the lan
guage of the axe, by all means, let's give
her the axe. First, the SOCC must call for
a 12-month moratorium on cuts, during
which time it will raise enough money to
cover the shortfall. But Rice will probably
take a page from her former boss and
draw a line in the sand, hence the need
for phase two.
That would involve a publicity cam
paign designed to draw the attention of
major newspapers, magazines and televi
sion shows, billed as "How Stanford Uni
versity Punishes Students for its Indirect
Cost Scandal." At this time, students
should also call on top University admin
istrators, particularly Casper, Rice, Jack
son and Edmonds, to take a pay cut — of,
say 15 to 30 percent. I guarantee you,

important news media will pay attention.
Third, students should send letters to
alumni, corporate donors, recruiters,
admitted students, high school coun
selors, other universities and any college
rankings publications explaining why in
all conscience, they cannot recommend
Stanford University as a suitable institu
tion for higher learning. Perhaps at this
point, said administrators will dismount
from their high horses and do the right
thing by their paying customers.
But to do this, the SOCC and other
concerned students must shed the alba
tross of multiculturalism and expose this
crisis for what it really is: a student issue.
And above all, no rallies, no sit-ins, no
office takeovers — Bldg. 10 is already
conducting lockdown exercises, which
means that Stanford Police and legal staff
are already on alert. They don't under
stand the language of the past.
But they do understand the language
of the axe.
