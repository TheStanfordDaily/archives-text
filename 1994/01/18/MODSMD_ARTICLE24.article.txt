# Lamp causes blaze at Mirrielees
## 
### Sasha Mitelman 
A small fire broke out on the
third floor of Mirrielees shortly
before 9 p.m. Friday, filling a
third-floor hallway with smoke
and prompting firefighters to
forcibly ventilate the hall for
approximately 15 minutes.
The fire, which started when a
halogen lamp ignited a nearby
curtain, did little damage to the
room, but covered nearby walls
with a layer of black soot.
Senior Jessica DiLullo said
she was vacuuming in an adja
cent room when she smelled
smoke, which she initially
thought was coming from the
vacuum cleaner.
When she came into the
room, however, the smoke was
so thick she could barely see the

far wall.
DiLullo then alerted resident
assistant Katie Geib and the two
tried unsuccessfully to extin
guish the smoldering curtain.
The fire was finally brought
under control when Geib asked
two individuals in a nearby room
to help.
After several buckets of water
dumped on the curtain made the
fire worse, graduate Paul
Neimann used a fire extinguish
er from the wall to put out the
flames while senior Paul Stasi
called the fire department.
The flames were completely
out by the time the fire depart
ment arrived, and one firefight
er noted that the residents'
quick action may well have pre
vented much more serious dam
age.

DiLullo also said that despite
all the smoke, a smoke alarm
hanging two feet from the cur
tain never went off, and that the
situation would have been far
worse had she been away from
the room.
Fire Captain Bruce Hallberg,
who arrived on the scene after
the fire was out, expressed con
cern over students' use of halo
gen lamps in their rooms.
"They're very popular, but also
very dangerous," Hallberg said.
"Some students have even been
using them as clothes hangers."
Hallberg also noted that this
was the third fire at Stanford in
the past year directly related to
the lamps. He urged students to
reconsider using the lamps
because of their inherently
unsafe design.
