## Cardinal chills the Wolverines 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
Don't let your pets outside. Don't expose your skin
to the air. These were tips for people in frigid Michigan
this weekend, where the temperature, with the wind
chill factor, reached 30 below zero.
The Stanford men's swim team knew it would be
cold in Ann Arbor. It was indeed cold, but the top
ranked Cardinal was hot, scorching the No. 2 Wolver
ines by a score of 133.5 to 109.5.
Michigan's fans provided an electric environment, as
the seats in Canham Natatorium were filled with
Wolverine faithful on Saturday. The crowd almost
cheered Michigan to an upset win, but Stanford finished
the meet by scoring big points in the 200-yard breast
stroke and the 400 freestyle relay to seal the victory.
"We were very, very pleased," said coach Skip Ken
ney. " I his was one of the hardest meets we've ever
been to. In the past 11 years, they've only lost two
home meets (including this weekend's defeat)."
Both of those losses have been at the hands of the
Cardinal, the first coming in 1992.
In addition to overcoming the natatorium's pro-
Michigan atmosphere, Kenney was impressed by his
team's ability to overcome the time difference and
other distractions brought on by travel.
"You have to have a hell of a team to travel through
time zones and compete," Kenney said. "We were
swimming when we should have been sleeping. We
were really out of our element. It was sold out and
their band was there. Our guys swam big time."
The Cardinal opened the competition in impressive
style, posting a 1-2 fmish in the 400-yard medley relay.
"At last year's NCAA Championships, we won the
medley relay and Michigan got second," Kenney said.
"This weekend, both our A and B teams beat Michi
gan. It was a huge swim."
