## Gymnasts fall to No. 4 UCLA 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
The women Cardinal gymnasts challenged the pre
season coaches' poll Friday when they lost by less than
a point to fourth-ranked UCLA.
Stanford, ranked 15th in the poll, earned a final
team score of 187.275, while the Bruins garnered the
victory with a score of 188.200.
However, despite Stanford's narrow loss, Cardinal
junior Jene Elzie won the meet with an all-around
score of 38.525. Second and third place went to
UCLA's Kareema Marrow (37.800) and Leah Horn ma
(37.725).
"I was really satisfied with my performance," said
Elzie. "I was really relaxed and calm."
On individual events, UCIJ\ won the vault and the
uneven bars, while Stanford received the leading scores
on beam and floor. However, the margin of the Bruins'
victories in the vault and bars competitions was
enough to carry them to a tenuous victory.
In the vault, UCIjVs Karen Nelson, Marrow and
Staci Smyth captured the top three places with an
overall score of 48.225. The Cardinal's final vault score
was 46.950. Elzie led Stanford with a powerful vault
which earned a 9.700, and junior Meegan Lannin was
close on her heels with a 9.625. Other competitors were
freshman Ariel Passanisi (9.325), junior Jenny Ward
(9.200), junior Tina Snowden (9.100) and freshman
Kiltie Jennings (8.925).
Though Jennings fell on her landing, it was the first
time she ever competed her vault on a hard mat, and
head coach Breck Greenwood is confident she will be
able to stick her landing by the next meet.
On bars, UCLA earned a 47.050 and Stanford came
in with a 45.550. UCIJVs Homma seized first place,
but Jennings tied with Bruin Megan Fenton for second
