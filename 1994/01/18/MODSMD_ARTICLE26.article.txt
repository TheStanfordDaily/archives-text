## Gymnasts fall to No. 4 UCLA 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
The women Cardinal gymnasts challenged the pre
season coaches' poll Friday when they lost by less than
a point to fourth-ranked UCLA.
Stanford, ranked 15th in the poll, earned a final
team score of 187.275, while the Bruins garnered the
victory with a score of 188.200.
However, despite Stanford's narrow loss, Cardinal
junior Jene Elzie won the meet with an all-around
score of 38.525. Second and third place went to
UCLA's Kareema Marrow (37.800) and Leah Horn ma
(37.725).
"I was really satisfied with my performance," said
Elzie. "I was really relaxed and calm."
On individual events, UCIJ\ won the vault and the
uneven bars, while Stanford received the leading scores
on beam and floor. However, the margin of the Bruins'
victories in the vault and bars competitions was
enough to carry them to a tenuous victory.
In the vault, UCIjVs Karen Nelson, Marrow and
Staci Smyth captured the top three places with an
overall score of 48.225. The Cardinal's final vault score
was 46.950. Elzie led Stanford with a powerful vault
which earned a 9.700, and junior Meegan Lannin was
close on her heels with a 9.625. Other competitors were
freshman Ariel Passanisi (9.325), junior Jenny Ward
(9.200), junior Tina Snowden (9.100) and freshman
Kiltie Jennings (8.925).
Though Jennings fell on her landing, it was the first
time she ever competed her vault on a hard mat, and
head coach Breck Greenwood is confident she will be
able to stick her landing by the next meet.
On bars, UCLA earned a 47.050 and Stanford came
in with a 45.550. UCIJVs Homma seized first place,
but Jennings tied with Bruin Megan Fenton for second
place with a 9.675. Elzie brought in
a 9.600, Lannin an 8.900, sopho
more Hillary Anderson an 8.800,
sophomore Linda Chun an 8.575
and senior Mollie Brown an 8.325.
According to Anderson, working
with the team psychologist Steve
Restaino through imagery and sim
ply talking about the meet really
helps prepare the team mentally,
especially for the beam.
Stanford gave a solid beam per
formance, earning an overall score
of 47.350. Compared to two falls by
Cardinal gymnasts, UCIA had a
somewhat shaky evening on the
beam, receiving a score of 46.475.
Anderson came in first place with a
9.700 and Jennings took second
with a 9.650.
Similar to its beam perfor
mances, the Stanford team won
through its consistency on the floor
as well, with a total score of 47.425.
Yet the top three places went to
Bruin scorers Nelson, Marrow and
Homma. Elzie and Lannin led the
Cardinals with respective scores of
9.675 and 9.650.

"I've been sick, so I watered
down my floor routine," Anderson
said. "I plan on working on my
energy and endurance, and getting
my tumbling back."
The implementation of a new,
more specific scoring system this
season makes Stanford's overall
score even more impressive. The
average score for the first meet in
past seasons is around 185, accord
ing to Greenwood. And since scores
in all events now start lower, it was
expected that the team score would
be lower as well.
The old scoring system left more
discretion to the judges, but a fair,
objective means of appraising per
formances has been created by the
increased difficulty and additional
requirements of the new system.
"I can see where judges took off
more for not connecting difficult
moves," third year assistant coach
Lisa Mitzel-Izzi said. "But the gym
nasts were rewarded for their good
moves.
"We looked like a new team, but
we had a lot of new tricks, which is
good for this early in the season. It
means a lot to us to have gotten so
close to such a good team. This is a
great start, but we'll come back
stronger."

Not even a balanced effort from the Cardinal was enough to top UCLA.
