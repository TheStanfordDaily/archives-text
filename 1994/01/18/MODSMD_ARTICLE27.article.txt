# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
As the California sun beat down during this
supposedly mid-winter weekend, Cardinal
sports teams were able to harness this energy
in the form of strong performances across the
board.
While the women's gymnastics and men's
basketball teams might not have mustered
quite enough of this solar power to defeat their

formidable opponents, the women hoopsters
captured more than enough to propel them to
an overwhelming victory over Arizona. Stan
ford wrestlers also turned up the temperature,
dominating the Aggie Open.
This week's Athletes of the Week both
shined particularly bright — one displaying
his brilliance on the mats of UC-Davis and the
other luminescing the Maples court.
Although they represent two different gen
erations of Cardinal athletes, both senior
Lance Johnson and freshman Jamila Wide
man spearheaded Stanford's weekend
onslaughts.
The simple word "pinner" is used frequent
ly to describe wrestling co-captain Lance John
son. Hailing from West Linn, Ore., the two
time NCAA qualifier dominated the 142-
pound weight class in the Cardinal's weekend
tournament.
Not only did Johnson garner the Most Out
standing Wrestler title for his impressive 4-0
tourney record, his two sub-four minute pins
proved why this one word so accurately char
acterizes his style.

As Johnson demonstrated his wrestling
expertise over the holiday weekend, Wideman
stormed onto the parquet in hopes of making
a name for herself.
Shooting for a career-high 19 points Satur
day night in the Cardinal's 87-64 rout over the
Wildcats, the point guard from Amherst,

Mass., further impressed the sold-out Maples
crowd by adding three assists and two steals to
round off her night.
Wideman's shooting accuracy as well as her
talent to successfully distribute the ball
around the court both provided the Cardinal
with an extra scoring dimension in its charac
teristically forceful attack.
