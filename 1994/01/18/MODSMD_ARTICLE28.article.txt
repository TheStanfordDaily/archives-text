# Hoops skins Wildcats
## Arizona falls 87-64 to Stanford onslaught 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
The road to the Pacific 10 Conference
women's basketball title still goes through
Maples Pavilion.
As the Cardinal's 87-64 thrashing of the
upstart Arizona Wildcats proved to a sellout
crowd of 7,500 on Saturday night, Stanford
(10-3, 3-1 in the Pac-10) remains the team
to beat this season as it guns for a sixth
straight conference crown. The win marked
the llth-ranked squad's third-consecutive
Pac-10 victory since opening conference
play with a Jan. 6 loss at Washington and
pulled the Cardinal into a second-place tie.
"I've learned since I've been here that
when we lose a game like Washington, the
next few teams are in trouble," said junior
forward Rachel Hemmer, who led all scorers
with 24 points and nearly attained a double
double with a game-high nine rebounds.
Arizona (8-3, 2-1) found itself in trouble
early in attempting to maintain a previous
ly perfect conference record. After hitting
the first field goal of the game, the Wildcats
stood by haplessly as the Cardinal created
three steals and scored the next eight
points.
Arizona head coach Joan Bonvicini called
a timeout, but to no avail, as the Cardinal
used its full-court pressure to make four
more thefts and open an insurmountable
19-7 lead at the 10-minute mark. Bonvicini
could only burn another timeout before
Hemmer made two of her three consecutive
layups to cap a 13-0 Stanford run that
brought the score to 23-7.
"I thought we were intimidated initially
tonight," Bonvicini said. "And Hemmer was
incredible. She just dominated us."
Hemmer wound up with 15 points in 18
first-half minutes, and the Cardinal's lead
never again dipped below eight as Stanford
found itself up 38-25 at the intermission.
When the action resumed, so did the
ceaseless Cardinal attack. The teams traded
baskets to begin the second stanza, then,
after a six-point Wildcat run closed the mar
gin to nine, Stanford peppered the nets with
a 15-4 run that put the game out of reach at
59-39 with 12 minutes remaining.
Driving for four of those points was
freshman guard Jamila Wideman, who

wound up with a career-high 19. With her
father, John, in attendance, Wideman
added three assists and two steals in possi
bly the best game of her Cardinal career.
"I'm still learning about the position of
point guard and how to read defenses.
Tonight, they were giving me the shot,"
Wideman said.
Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer
acknowledged Wideman's contributions,
explaining the unusually high scoring out
put from her point guard.
"She knows that her No. 1 job is dis
tributing the ball, and she is an unselfish
player," VanDerveer said. "But you can't be
out there and not hit open shots."
Bonvicini even sang Wideman's praises,
adding that the Wildcats did not
include her performance in their
plans.
"That's the best game I've seen

Wideman play, and I've seen all of
her games on film," Bonvicini said.
The Cardinal could not have
filmed a better all-around perfor
mance, as it continued its recent
trend of building on leads throughout
the game. Stanford's advantage grew
as large as 25 thrice in the closing
minutes, the last on a fast-break

layup by freshman forward Tara
Harrington with six minutes remain
ing that made the score 74-49.
The contest closed sloppily, with
both sides missing shots and com
mitting fouls. But when it was over,
the Cardinal enjoyed yet another
decisive triumph, one that even
their coach could not foresee.

"I would have had no idea going
into this game that we could have
done this," VanDerveer said. "This
team is improving, listening, work
ing together. It's really a fun team
to work with. And the most exciting
thing is, even though it's doing
good things I know how much bet
ter it can be."
