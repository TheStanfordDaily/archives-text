## Wideman's father a Stanford boon 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
The court presence of a man might
thus far be the secret to the success of
this year's Stanford women's basket
ball team.
John Wideman, father of freshman
point guard Jamila Wideman, has trav
eled from Amherst, Mass., to Maples
Pavilion in order to attend several
recent Cardinal games, all of which
have been won in grand fashion by the
Cardinal and have involved important
contributions by his daughter.
Whether or not this is mere coinci
dence, it is nevertheless tempting to
wonder about the senior Wideman's
ostensibly supernatural powers to
motivate the Stanford squad. His
daughter is convinced.
"He's been bringing us good
luck," Jamila said.
But Jamila has been bringing
some luck of her own to the 10-3
Cardinal, pumping in a career-high
19 points against the Arizona Wild
cats on Saturday night. Her perfor
mance was an indication of how
adeptly she has handled a tough
regimen of on-the-job training.
"Jamila didn't really start out

very well, but she's been working
on her shot .... [Against Aiizona
she showed) a complete floor game:
running the team, working hard
defensively and hitting her shot.
She is maturing really well," said
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer.
Against the Wildcats, Van-
Derveer said that the defense "realJy
backed off Jamila because she's been
penetrating and creating a lot."
Wideman was quick to capitalize
on this weakness, but not without
first asking permission from her
coach.
According to VanDerveer,

"Jamila came up to me and said
'They're really off me.' I said, 'Take
your jumpshot.' "
"We needed to send a message
to ourselves," Hemmer said.
"We're a good team with the poten
tial to be a great team. We're on a
mission."
Arizona head coach Joan Bon
vicini saw things somewhat simi
larly, saying "We got some baptism
in the conference tonight. We came
in here undefeated and tied for first
in the conference. Stanford came in
ticked off wanting to put us back
where they wanted us to be."
VanDerveer is pleasantly sur

prised with her team, whose main
characteristic is its youth.
"This team is a team that's play
ing within itself," VanDerveer said.
"It's exciting to watch three fresh
men, a sophomore and a junior
play this well when I know how
much better they can be."
Bonvicini even goes so far as to
attribute some of the Cardinal's
success to its greenness.
"The Stanford team is having a
lot of fun. Last year everyone was
pointing at them, and they were
marked," Bonvicini said.
And John Wideman was in Mas
sachusetts.
