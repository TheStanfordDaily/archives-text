## University administrators perform in dramatic presentation of King's legacy 
### Josh Green Staff writer 
University President Gerhard Casper
may not have displayed a perfect Irish
brogu<> last night, but he and four other vol
unteers carried off an otherwise flawless
dramatic reading at a program in Memorial
Church commemorating Dr. Martin
Luther KingÂ«Jr.
While Casper read the part of John F.
Kennedy, Provost Condoleezza Rice played
a convincing Coretta Scott King in "A Cele
bration of the Life and Legacy of Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr." The play was written last
year bv History Prof. Clay borne Carson, di
rector of the King Papers Project. This
year, it was adapted and shortened to be

read by five people.
"We did this without any rehearsal,"
said former Stanford administrator Tom
Massey, who read the part of Malcolm X.
"Given that reality, I think everything
went pretty well."
But the administrators had to defer to
the acting abilities of Rev. Floyd Thoinp
kins, associate dean of Memorial Church,
who played King.
Thompkins' booming voice rose and fell
much in the way King's did more than 25
years ago, echoing off the high ceilings of
the church His expressive speaking style
brought life to the text, most of which was
taken directly from King's speeches.
