# 'We Shall Overcome'
## University administrators perform in dramatic presentation of King's legacy 
### Josh Green Staff writer 
University President Gerhard Casper
may not have displayed a perfect Irish
brogu<> last night, but he and four other vol
unteers carried off an otherwise flawless
dramatic reading at a program in Memorial
Church commemorating Dr. Martin
Luther KingÂ«Jr.
While Casper read the part of John F.
Kennedy, Provost Condoleezza Rice played
a convincing Coretta Scott King in "A Cele
bration of the Life and Legacy of Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr." The play was written last
year bv History Prof. Clay borne Carson, di
rector of the King Papers Project. This
year, it was adapted and shortened to be

read by five people.
"We did this without any rehearsal,"
said former Stanford administrator Tom
Massey, who read the part of Malcolm X.
"Given that reality, I think everything
went pretty well."
But the administrators had to defer to
the acting abilities of Rev. Floyd Thoinp
kins, associate dean of Memorial Church,
who played King.
Thompkins' booming voice rose and fell
much in the way King's did more than 25
years ago, echoing off the high ceilings of
the church His expressive speaking style
brought life to the text, most of which was
taken directly from King's speeches.
Stanford graduate Anthony J.
Haney, who participated in the
play last spring, read the part of
Daddy King.
Carson said he was pleased
with the performance and didn't
think the reading had less impact
than last year's play.
"I thought it was wonderful,"
Carson said. "It's a unique way of
celebrating the holiday, and 1
hope it can become a tradition at
Stanford."
Thompkins ended the reading
with a powerful oration, standing
up on the podium as if he were
addressing thousands of people in
Washington rather than an
almost-full Memorial Church.
"Say that I was a drum major
for justice ... for peace . . . and
for righteousness. I just want to
leave a committed life behind,"
Thompkins said, reciting a
famous and eerie speech King
gave in which he mentions his
own death.
Casper, dressed in a dark suit,
and with glasses low on his nose,
read some of Kennedy's more
famous speeches
"We face, therefore, a moral
crisis both as a country and as a
people," Casper said. "A great
change is at hand. . . . Those who
do nothing are inviting shame as
well as violence. Those who fight
for change are inviting right as
well as reality."
But Thompkins had the most
poignant lines of the night.
"There are times in life when
you must take a position that is
neither safe, nor politic, nor prop
er," said Thompkins. "But you do
it, because it is right. ... I will not
be stopped. 1 will be heard."
The Stanford Gospel Choir
accompanied the five readers with
a number of songs and solos.
Dressed in bright red robes, the
choir sang "We Shall Overcome"
to begin the reading.
