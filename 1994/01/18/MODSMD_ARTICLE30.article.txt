# Cardinal crushed by Arizona attack, 89-72
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
The Stanford men's basketball team
picked an especially bad time to walk into a
den of Wildcats.
Coming off a rare home loss two nights
before, a feisty Arizona squad squashed an
overmatched Cardinal team Saturday night
at the McKale Center in Tucson by the score
of 89-72.
The Wildcats (13-2, 2-1 in the Pacific 10
Conference) breezed by the Cardinal, mak
ing amends for a 98-93 overtime loss to Cal
ifornia Thursday night. The victory over
Stanford (9-4, 2-2) upped Arizona's home
court record to an amazing 101-3 over the
last seven years and put the Wildcats back
on course to win their seventh Pac-10 title in
the last nine years.
"It was important after the tough loss the
other night to come out strong," said Ari
zona coach Lute Olson. "I wanted to make
sure that we came out and established our
selves right away, and we did."
The Cardinal's performance appeared
remarkably similar to its Thursday-night
effort against Arizona State.
For the second straight game, Stanford
kept pace with its opponent for the first nine
or 10 minutes of the game, before losing its
composure and allowing the contest to get

out of reach before halftime.
"We got taken out early in the game as
the result of poor decisions and shots," said
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery. "We got
out of sequence. Arizona was able to capital
ize on it."
At one point in the first period, the Cardi
nal trailed by only 27-21, but then the Wild
cats burst I<x)se for 13 straight points, creat
ing a comfortable lead that would last for the
duration of the contest. Stanford's first-peri
od shooting percentage of 24.1 percent (on
seven for 29 shooting) did not help matters,
either.
The second half proved equally troubling
for the Stanford team, which saw the deficit
grow to as much as 28 points before finally
whittling it down to a more respectable 13-
point Arizona advantage. The Cardinal's
"mini-comeback" was capped by a 14-1 scor
ing run in the closing minutes, providing
Stanford with its lone bright spot in an oth
erwise unimpressive team performance.
"Arizona just lost their concentration,
and we were able to make our shots," Mont
gomery said. "We finally started to look like
a basketball team. We just came out compet
ing too late."
The entire Cardinal squad needs to step
up its level of play if it expects to provide any

California this week.
Maybe the best remedy of all is
to put this disappointing weekend
behind and start looking toward
the future.
"We have to get back to the way
we were playing earlier in the sea

said sophomore guard Dion Cross.
"This has been a rough road trip,
but we won't be the only team to
lose here."
