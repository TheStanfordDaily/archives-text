## 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
With a little more than a month
remaining until the Pacific 10
Championships, things seem to
keep getting better for the Stan
ford wrestlers.
Led by senior co-captain Lance
Johnson, the Cardinal dominated
the competition at the Aggie Open,
held on Saturday at UC-Davis. The
team brought 21 athletes to com
pete and finished with seven
wrestlers placing within the top
four of their respective weight
classes.
Johnson, wrestling as a 142-
pounder for the first time this year,
took first-place honors in the divi
sion. In addition, he was named the
tournament's Most Outstanding
Wrestler and won the Most Falls
Award, indicating that he scored
the most pins in the least amount
of time of all competitors.
Johnson achieved his first fall
against Steve Gordon of Southern
Oregon State in 3 minutes, 56 sec
onds. He advanced to beat Troy
Henderson of the Air Force Acade
my, and then scored his second fall
in only 1:08 against Jeff Dalrvm
ple, also from the AFA.

Because it was an open tourna
ment, Johnson competed against
his own teammate, sophomore
Jimmy Aguirre, in the finals.
Aguirre had also enjoyed success in
his region of the bracket to reach
Johnson.
In the first round, Aguirre beat
Dean Roth of Southern Oregon by
technical fall, outscoring him 18-1
in only 6:06. He continued his
sweep by winning matches against
Brad Woodbury of San Francisco
State and Dominic Boutain, who
was competing unattached. John
son ended Aguirre's winning
streak by winning the final match
5-0.
"Lance really knew how to
wrestle me," Aguirre said. "It was a
very close match, and he got the
best of me."
According to the wrestlers and
head coach Chris Horpel, this
intra-team competition is a natural
part of the sport and ultimately
serves as a motivational factor.
However, it creates a potential log
jam of talented athletes between
the 134 and 150-pound divisions.
"I have mixed emotions about
I Johnson and Aguirre's match 1,"
