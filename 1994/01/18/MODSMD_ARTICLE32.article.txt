# Spikers take second in Invite
## Ceman leads team in UC-Santa Barbara tourney 
### Kathryn Yang Editorial staff 
In a battle of the best of the
best, the No. 4 Cardinal men's
volleyball team kicked off its
1994 campaign in a grand fash
ion, upending No. 2 BYU en
route to taking home the silver
at the prestigious UC-Santa Bar
bara Invitational this weekend.
After knocking out the
Cougars, third-seeded USC was
the only obstacle to an otherwise
perfect performance by the Car
dinal spikers. The two teams
clashed in the championship
match on Saturday, and the Tro
jans emerged victorious in a
hard-fought 15-9, 6-15, 15-8, 8-
15, 15-9 contest.
"They passed better than we
did, because we have two new
passers," said Stanford head
coach Ruben Nieves. "We have a
lot of room for improvement,
and we will improve, because it
was good passing that got us into
the championship.
"Besides that, we did not
effectively contain USC's top
two hitters. They have a simple
offense . . . they always set to
their two top hitters, and we
couldn't stop that even though
we knew it was coming."
Indeed, despite sophomore
Mike Lambert's team-high 26
kills and freshman Matt Fuer
bringer's 22-kill effort, Stanford
was out-played and out-pounded
by the Trojans' Chris Under
wood, who slammed 33 kills for a
.491 hitting percentage and
Tournament MVP honors. His
teammate, Jason Mulholland,
was not far behind Underwood's

award-winning performance
with 37 kills and a .459 hitting
percentage on the night.
"The USC game was very
symbolic of our young team,"
said All-Tournament setter
Canyon Ceman. "We were on
and-off and lacked consistency.

'We have as good a
shot as anyone for
the national title, and
we're only going to
get better.'

"As a team we were playing with
a lot of emotion, and by the time it
was 5-1 in the final game we knew
it was over. That just kind of took
the wind out of our sails."
Despite that disappointment,
the talented Cardinal squad is
confident about the upcoming
regular-season confrontations
with USC and the other top pro
grams in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation.
This newfound confidence
answers a slew of preseason
questions concerning Stanford's
young and relatively unproven
talents.
It was the mammoth 17-16,
15-6 victory over BYU in the
early rounds of the tournament
that dispelled any doubts of
Stanford's ability to play with
the big boys, as they reeled off
two more W's before falling to

the Trojans.
"During that BYU game,
everythingjust clicked," said All-
Tournament opposite hitter
Lambert. "We started two fresh
men in that game, and we
smoked I the Cougars]."
The Cardinal then went on to
punish UC-Santa Barbara and
UC-Irvine before stepping into
the championship match. Over
all, Stanford compiled a 6-2 tour
nament record, with an early
defeat at the hands of Long
Beach State buried within victo
ries over UC-Santa Cruz, Ari
zona State and California.
"After this tournament, I'd
say that we have as good a shot
as anyone for the national title,
and we're only going to get bet
ter," Ceman said. "(The top
ranked teams] aren't as intimi
dating as we thought they'd be,
because UCLA and LJSC have
been playing the same six play
ers for the last two years, so it's
not like they're going to skyrock
et this year."
After losing six seniors from
last year's No. 2 squad, this sea
son's Stanford team fielded two
to four freshmen in every lineup
this weekend and came away
smelling like a rose, while the
veteran spikers from No. 1
UCLA settled for a fourth-place
consolation finish, after winning
it all last year.
"At first 1 thought that UCLA
would have to choke in order for
us to have any chance at all,"
said senior Brian Garrett. "Now
I know that we're all equal —
any one of the top-four teams
can take it all on any given
night."
