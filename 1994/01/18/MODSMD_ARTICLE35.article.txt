# West is the best in 69th Shrine Game, 29-28
## 
### Todd Bernstein Staff writer 
The 69th Annual East-West
Shrine Game was nothing short of
spectacular.
On Saturday afternoon, 60,000
fans filled Stanford Stadium to wit
ness the West team pull off a
tremendous comeback in defeating
the East 29-28.
The first half, however, was
dominated by the East. The first
half rout began after a fumble
recovery by the East defense. Then
the combination of quarterback
Glenn Foley and Errict Rhett went
to work. The Boston College stand
out found Florida's Rhett twice in
the flat to take the East down to
their opponent's 28-yard line. After
a completion to Michigan wide
receiver Derrick Alexander, Rhett
pounded up the middle for a six
yard touchdown run.
The East defense continued to
stifle the West attack, holding them
to only one first down in the first
quarter. Dartmouth quarterback
Jay Fiedler replaced Foley and led
the squad on a 47-yard scoring
drive.
A hometown favorite, San Jose
State quarterback Jeff Garcia,

entered the game in the second
quarter for the West and began
moving the West down the field.
Garcia engineered two long drives,
but both were snubbed by the East
defense on a missed fourth-down
conversion and a 'iyronne Drake
ford interception.
The second half saw the East
climb to an even bigger lead on two
touchdown passes, one by Foley
and the other by Fiedler. The East
lead held at 28-7 as the fourth quar
ter began and the fans became
bored.
On came Garcia.
The San Jose State quarterback,
in an MVP performance, electrified
the crowd as he brought the West
back in the fourth quarter. With 10
minutes, 20 seconds left in the
game Garcia began to work his
magic.
Starting at his own 39-yard line,
Garcia led a 61-yard drive to bring
his team within 14 points. Then,
due to a special Shriner rule which
allows a team down by more than
nine points to receive the kickoff
after a score, the West got the ball
back.
Garcia once again took over, this
time at his own 19. He completed
two quick passes of 22 and 31 yards

to put the West in scoring position
again. This time Garcia hit Col
orado star Charles Johnson over
the middle for a touchdown.
The West, now down by only
seven points, was forced to kick off
to the East with only 3:30 left on
the clock. The West defense
stepped up and forced the East to
punt with 2:52 left in the game.
Garcia capped off his MVP perfor
mance with an 80-yard, 2:05 scor
ing drive, the key play coming on a
fourth-down touchdown pass to
Jamal Anderson.
"It came down to the last play,
fourth and six and I knew we need
ed to get a guy in the end zone. I
tried to buy some time and get
rolled out. The defensive guy was
out there but he chose the inside
man, so 1 chose the outside," com
mented Garcia.
Then it was decision time.
Edwards immediately decided to go
for the two-point conversion, and
on a two-yard scramble by Garcia
the West took a 29-28 lead.
The East had two shots at win
ning the game with only seconds
remaining, but Syracuse kicker Pat
O'Neill missed two field goal
attempts as the West held on for
the one point victory.
