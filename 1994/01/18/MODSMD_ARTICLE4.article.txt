# New home in the works for Res Ed
## Restructuring in Student Affairs; Res Ed to report to housing director 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
As part of a major restructur
ing of Student Affairs, Residential
Education and related offices will
now fall under the jurisdiction of a
new administrative department
headed by the director of Housing
and Dining Services.
The move, which Vice Provost
for Student Affairs Mary Ed
monds announced Friday, will re
duce the number of offices report
ing directly to her from 11 to six.
"I came into an organization
that was just too unwieldy, and I
was looking for an opportunity to
reorganize it," Edmonds said, ex

The streamlining effort will
place the Career Planning and
Placement Center, the Center for
Teaching and Learning, and the
Undergraduate Advising Center

dents Michael Jackson will now
head freshman Orientation activi

The changes, announced at a
meeting attended by about 20 res
ident fellows Friday, raised ques

ganization would have on Res Ed.
Jane Benson, a RF in West La
gunita, expressed "some anxiety
that Residential Education may
lose some of its identity," but
added, "I don't know yet whether
that's a legitimate concern."
Acting Co-Director of Res Ed
Ann Porteus agreed that the
change could cause problems.
"Any time you report to someone
lower down in an organization,
you stand a chance of losing your
visibility," she said.
Though Porteus was still posi
tive about the changes, she ac
knowledged the differences be
tween the two aspects of residen
tial administration.
"Residential Education has
been a much more open place, an
idea arena . . . whereas Housing
and Dining Services is more a cus
tomer-service operation which is
worried much more about the bot
tom line," she said, adding that
she expected the new organization
