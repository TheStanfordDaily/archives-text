# New home in the works for Res Ed
## Restructuring in Student Affairs; Res Ed to report to housing director 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
As part of a major restructur
ing of Student Affairs, Residential
Education and related offices will
now fall under the jurisdiction of a
new administrative department
headed by the director of Housing
and Dining Services.
The move, which Vice Provost
for Student Affairs Mary Ed
monds announced Friday, will re
duce the number of offices report
ing directly to her from 11 to six.
"I came into an organization
that was just too unwieldy, and I
was looking for an opportunity to
reorganize it," Edmonds said, ex
plaining the changes.
The streamlining effort will
place the Career Planning and
Placement Center, the Center for
Teaching and Learning, and the
Undergraduate Advising Center
under the supervision of the Reg
istrar's office.
Admissions Dean James Mon
toya will take charge of the Finan
cial Aids Office, and Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson will now
head freshman Orientation activi
ties.

The changes, announced at a
meeting attended by about 20 res
ident fellows Friday, raised ques
tions about the effect the new or
ganization would have on Res Ed.
Jane Benson, a RF in West La
gunita, expressed "some anxiety
that Residential Education may
lose some of its identity," but
added, "I don't know yet whether
that's a legitimate concern."
Acting Co-Director of Res Ed
Ann Porteus agreed that the
change could cause problems.
"Any time you report to someone
lower down in an organization,
you stand a chance of losing your
visibility," she said.
Though Porteus was still posi
tive about the changes, she ac
knowledged the differences be
tween the two aspects of residen
tial administration.
"Residential Education has
been a much more open place, an
idea arena . . . whereas Housing
and Dining Services is more a cus
tomer-service operation which is
worried much more about the bot
tom line," she said, adding that
she expected the new organization
to combine the approaches.
But not everyone was pleased
by the decision. "Housing and food
service has had a history of ignor
ing student opinion," said Kennell
Jackson, RF in Branner, citing
student complaints about such
things as University-operated food
service on the Row and the instal
lation of door closers in Wilbur.
Besides Res Ed, Housing and
Dining Services Director Keith
Guy will handle graduate residen
tial life, housing assignments,
dining services, maintenance and
facilities.
Edmonds also announced Fri
day that a new half-time dean of
Res Ed will be sought among cur
rent faculty members. However,
she said she is closing the search
for a new Res Ed director until
the office's future — which is
being examined by the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education
— is clear.
Edmonds also cited the new
changes in administrative struc
ture as a reason for closing the
search. "The position that [a new
Res Ed director) would be coming
into would be different from the
one we advertised," she
explained.
Porteus and fellow Res Ed co
director Diana Conklin will con
tinue in their positions "until we
at least get a sense of what the
position is going to look like,"
Edmonds said.
Conklin expressed some disap
pointment with the decision to
suspend the search, commenting
that "it's been a long time since
Res Ed has had one full-time
director."
Porteus added that she is con
cerned that the new dean will
report directly to Provost Con
doleezza Rice — while the Res Ed
director will report to Guy —
because it might "complicate the
dynamics" of program leadership.
The circumstances of the
meeting itself also drew criticism.
Edmonds waited until Thursday
afternoon to summon RFs to Fri
day's meeting, upsetting some
who couldn't make it on such
short notice.
The reorganization also came
as a surprise to some. RFs "were
not consulted about these
changes," Jackson said.

"This administration and Con
doleezza Rice in particular has
made it clear that this process is
not going to be as inclusive as it
has been in the past," Porteus
said.
Since housing maintenance,
food service and residential pro
grams are funded by fees charged
to students, rather than money
from the University's general
fund, they are not included in the
list of departments forced to
make the budget cuts mandated
by Rice.
But Edmonds said Housing
and Dining Services "have been
charged with becoming more effi
cient themselves," both to hold
down costs and to help pay for the
capital improvements program
that began last summer with the
remodeling of Wilbur Hall.
Edmonds stressed redundancy
among some of the functions of
the several departments as a rea
son for the changes, citing hous
ing services' provision of facilities
for Res-Ed sponsored programs

as an example of how the depart
ments overlap.
Sally Dickson, RF in Ujamaa,
praised the change. "I think that
in theory the proposal sounded
like it made sense," she said,
adding that "Keith Guy and
I Mary Edmonds 1 did an excellent
job in getting the reaction from
RFs regarding the important edu
cational elements of residential
living."
While administrators said the
changes should save money, they
were reluctant to discuss exact
cuts because decisions have }'et to
be made. Job cuts are "possible,"
Guy said, but he wouldn't go so
far as to say they were likely.
There was also widespread
agreement that the precise roles
of everyone in the new adminis
trative structure would not be
known for a while. Edmonds said
she welcomes a continuing dia
logue with RFs, especially regard
ing the role of the new dean in
guiding the academic aspects of
residential education.
