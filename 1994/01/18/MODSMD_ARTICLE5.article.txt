# University commits to summer storage
## Students will have to pay for service 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
After almost a year of ASSU
lobbying, the University will
again provide summer storage —
for a price.
"It won't be free storage any
more," said Associate Director of
Housing and Dining Services
Rodger Whitney, referring to the
storage program the University
had offered up until last summer,
when it was eliminated due to
budget constraints and fire codes.
Whitney said that two of the
threeon-campus storage locations
are likely to be in Wilbur Hall and
Lagunita Court, with another sta
tion on the Row, but did not speci
fy the exact storage cost per stu
dent. "We're still working on the
details," he said.
"It's not going to be an elabo
rate service," Whitney said. "We
think we can devise a program to
meet the needs of the average stu
dent."
According to Whitney, the new
plan would involve selling pre
printed boxes to students and re
stricting stored items to those
that can fit in the boxes — exclud
ing such items as furniture.
The University was initially re
luctant to bring back storage, said
ASSU Senate Chair Greg Wal
dorf. "Our first meeting wasn't
that optimistic," he said. "1 really

think if we hadn't
gone in and told
them that storage
needed to be rein
stated, it wouldn't
have happened."
The senate
passed a resolu
tion last quarter
instructing Wal
dorf to look for

possible solutions to the storage
dilemma. "I presented [the Uni
versity] with a model of how the
storage can operate," he said.
"I think what happened ini
tially was that they were telling
us all the reasons we couldn't
do it ... . We came back with
ways it could be done," Waldorf
said.
Early in fall quarter, several
plans for offering summer storage
had been suggested — including a
Council of Presidents proposal
which would have made storage
an ASSU business project.
And though the proposed solu
tion will not involve the ASSU di
rectly, Waldorf stressed student
government's involvement in the
process.
"With the budget situation at
the ASSU, the plan to run [stor
age] as a business project was un
feasible," Waldorf said. "But we
managed to receive a definite com
