## Provost receives plans for budget cuts 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
The budget ax was in full swing for
Stanford's central administrative units
Friday as they submitted plans for spend
ing reduction to the Provost's Office, re
luctantly offering up programs, salaries
and staff positions for possible cuts.
Provost Condoleezza Rice will review
each department's proposal and is expect
ed to announce her decisions in February
or March.
Offices were asked to submit plans de
tailing what actions they would take if
they were to face 5 percent or 10 percent
budget cuts each year for the next three
years. Rice's overall goal is to reduce the
University's administrative costs by $18
million to $20 million by 1997.

Events and Services Director Lois
Wagner said that in past budget cuts her
office has taken "big hits" that have
greatly strained its resources.
Further cuts might have grave conse
quences, Wagner said, including the pos
sible elimination of The Lively Arts at
Stanford and, if necessary, "taking a look
at Commencement."
"We have identified additional cuts.
We have not recommended them," she
said "We are so integral to so many de
partments on campus . . . that we can't
just pick up and go away."
Judith Little, director of the Office of
Multicultural Development, was reluc
tant to discuss the specifics of her office's
budget plans but said cuts might result in
a reduction in "support for multicultural
programs."

University Ombudsperson Leah Ka
plan said that her office has already re
duced its own budget and is "really scrap
ing for nickels and dimes."
Her office's proposal included cutting
employment time from year-round to 11
months and reducing salaries proportion
ately. "The total budget other than
salaries was very small," she said
John Ford, director of the Office of De
velopment, said his office was not asked to
submit a proposal for budget reduction,
because in addition to taking $4 million in
cuts over the past four years, his office has
undertaken its own internal restructur
ing. That restructuring has included the
elimination of 42 staff positions and major
management reorganization.
The decision not to cut the
development office was also influ
enced by the fact that it is "an
income-producing operation,"
Ford said. His office will continue
to review its budget and recom
mend possible budget reductions
to the provost.

Vice Provost arid Dean for Stu
dent Affairs Mary Edmonds said
she has met with representatives
from several offices under her
supervision to produce a single set
of budget scenarios for Student
Affairs.
Because of the uncertainty of
the budget situation, Edmonds
declined comment on any specific
parts of her office's budget pro
posals.
