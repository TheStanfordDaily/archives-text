LOS ANGELES (AP) - Suzi
Impliazzo dabbed her swollen,
bloody left eye as she and dozens
of other earthquake victims —
some of them wearing tags
marked "Disaster" — waited in
the crowded parking lot at Grana
da Hills Community Hospital.
Around Impliazzo, workers
hustled to treat victims of the
earthquake that violently
shook Southern California yes
terday. The scene was repeated
at other crowded hospitals in
the area. Some people were
turned away.
"We've seen a million injuries.
Dislocated bones, lacerations, a
lot of blood," said Toni Regalado,
admitting officer in the emergen
cy room at Holy Cross Medical
Center in Mission Hills.
An estimated 250 patients
were treated at Holy Cross in the
first three hours after the prelim
inary 6.6-magnitude quake

struck at 4:31 a.m. Monday.
When darkness fell, the
Granada Hills staff busied them
selves treating another wave of
injured residents. Floodlights
illuminated the parking lot.
The new arrivals had burned
themselves boiling water or
delayed seeking immediate treat
ment after the quake
Victims picked their way
through rubble-strewn streets
and past downed power lines,
only to find hospitals were too
swamped to treat them.
Patients lay on gurneys or
huddled under blankets in dimly
lit hallways. Emergency genera
tors kicked on and staff members
scurried to round up bottled
water and fruit juice.
About 700 patients were trans
ferred from four quake-damaged
hospitals, said Cindy Shamrock, a
spokeswoman for the state Office
of Emergency Services.
