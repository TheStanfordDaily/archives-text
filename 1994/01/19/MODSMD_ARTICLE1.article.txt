# L.A. reeling from quake
## 40 dead; $1B damage 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Under skies as
bright and blue as ever, Southern Californi
ans confronted a changed world yesterday.
The defining features of this region's life
— water, power and freeways — were sud
denly uncertain. In their place: long lines,
hellish commutes and constant earthquake
aftershocks.
The county coroner's office raised the
quake's death toll from 34 to 40 late yester
day, with the office attributing most of the ad
ditional deaths to quake-related heart at
tacks.
Earlier yesterday, a 16th body was found
inside a flattened apartment building in
Northridge, the epicenter of the powerful
earthquake that struck before dawn Monday.
But that was only the worst toll paid by
people in this battered city.
Once again, the rhythms of life in South
ern California were snapped by disaster,
much as they were after last fall's wildfires
and the Los Angeles riots 21 months ago.
And the effects of this disaster on the day
to-day lives of residents were likely to reach
farther and last longer.

National Guard soldiers patrol the area near a collapsed apartment building in North
rldge yesterday.
"The days ahead will also be
rough for us," Mayor Richard
Riordan warned Angelenos, even
as he praised them for a cool-head
ed response to the crisis. "Let's all
stick together."
A snapshot of a region in crisis
yesterday:
• The Federal Emergency Man
agement Agency said it expected to
spend at least $1 billion on quake
repairs. The 1989 earthquake in
the San Francisco Bay Area cost
an estimated $5.9 billion.
• More than 100 of the city's
750 public schools were seriously
damaged. Many offices and stores
were closed, and workers were
urged to stay home. But the clo
sure of four of the nation's busiest
freeways or highways made com
muting a frustrating adventure.
• Aftershocks, some nearing 5
on the Richter scale, continued to
jolt the region.
• About 100,000 homes re
mained without power, and
between 50,000 and 100,000 were
without water, almost all of them
in the hard-hit San Fernando Val
ley. The Department of Water and
Power said it could be a week or
more before water was restored.
Broken water lines and power
problems at two treatment facili
ties in the San Fernando Valley

have forced officials to draw sup
plies from holding ponds, and
those ponds could run dry by early
today, utility officials said.
• Ix>s Angeles County hospitals
said they had treated 2,863
patients for quake-related injuries,
530 of them serious enough to
require hospitalization.
• About 20,000 people were
camping in parks, the Department
of Parks and Recreation said, and
4,000 people spent Monday night
in 25 emergency shelters.
• More than 2,000 National
Guard soldiers were mobilized;
many could be seen patrolling the
San Fernando Valley, guns at their
sides.
After a dusk-to-dawn curfew,
police reported about 75 arrests
overnight for crimes such as rob
bery and curfew violation. The
curfew was extended through this
morning.
The White House announced
that President Clinton would fly to
Southern California today to sur
vey the damage.
Yesterday, Pete Wilson, who
has fended off fire, flood, riots and
recession as California's governor,
answered questions outside the
crushed apartment building in
Northridge, the site of the greatest
number of fatalities.
He acknowledged the effects of
the quake — in particular the free
way closures — would linger for a
long time.
"Unfortunately, it is going to be

a major, major inconvenience," he
said.
A potentially more serious
problem involved the city's dwin
dling water supply.
Bob Gomperz, a spokesman for
the Metropolitan Water District,
said crews were working to restore
service to one of the treatment
plants by late this afternoon. "It's
a race against time," he said.
The California Department of
Transportation said it hoped to
rebuild the damaged freeways by
the end of the year — a crash pro
gram that is expected to cost at
least $100 million.
The quake collapsed sections of
Interstate 10, the Santa Monica
Freeway, as well as sections of
Interstate 5 and state Routes 14
and 118, all vital links in the
region's freeway network.
Dean Dunphy, director of the
state Business, Transportation
and Housing Agency, predicted
that a detour around the damaged
portion of 1-5 could be created
within two weeks.
That would reopen the major
north-south highway on the West
Coast, whose economic importance
was underscored yesterday when
Los Angeles-bound truckers were
left stranded in the San Joaquin
Valley north of the city.
The Santa Monica Freeway, the
nation's busiest highway, is of
equal importance locally. Near the
freeway's collapsed overpasses
Tuesday morning, traffic crawled

on Fairfax Avenue at a rate of
about four blocks per hour.
Late in the morning, in another
of the unthinkable images that
have marked the past couple of
days, huge construction cranes
began tearing down sections of the
freeway, biting cracks into the con
crete slabs and lifting them away.
In the San Fernando Valley,
the 260-square-mile suburban
expanse most badly damaged by
the quake, many people stayed
home to clean up and take stock.
That kept commuting problems to
a minimum.
But those who ventured out in
their cars had to negotiate a crazy
tangle of detours around cracked
residential streets and flooded
areas. A few opted for rarely used
mass transit, including the
Metrolink train that runs from
the valley into downtown Los
Angeles.
"I was kind of surprised that it
was so uncrowded," said Scott
Draper, a Los Angeles city analyst
who lives in Glendale and took the
train. Although the train was late,
he said, "I'd still ride it. We all
need to sacrifice and be more
understanding of one another."
At dawn, continuous after
shocks raised a slight brownish
haze of dust over the northern and
western portions of the valley that
slightly dimmed the rising sun.
Later, the skies turned the bril
liant blue typical of a bright mid
winter day.

of the unthinkable images that
have marked the past couple of
days, huge construction cranes
began tearing down sections of the
freeway, biting cracks into the con
crete slabs and lifting them away.
In the San Fernando Valley,
the 260-square-mile suburban
expanse most badly damaged by
the quake, many people stayed
home to clean up and take stock.
That kept commuting problems to
a minimum.
But those who ventured out in
their cars had to negotiate a crazy
tangle of detours around cracked
residential streets and flooded
areas. A few opted for rarely used
mass transit, including the
Metrolink train that runs from
the valley into downtown Los
Angeles.
"I was kind of surprised that it
was so uncrowded," said Scott
Draper, a Los Angeles city analyst
who lives in Glendale and took the
train. Although the train was late,
he said, "I'd still ride it. We all
need to sacrifice and be more
understanding of one another."
At dawn, continuous after
shocks raised a slight brownish
haze of dust over the northern and
western portions of the valley that
slightly dimmed the rising sun.
Later, the skies turned the bril
liant blue typical of a bright mid
winter day.

A luxury home in Pacific Palisades lies in ruins yesterday after slid
ing down a hill in the Northridge earthquake which measured 6.6 on
the Richter scale.
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Under skies as
bright and blue as ever, Southern Californi
ans confronted a changed world yesterday.
The defining features of this region's life
— water, power and freeways — were sud
denly uncertain. In their place: long lines,
hellish commutes and constant earthquake
aftershocks.
The county coroner's office raised the
quake's death toll from 34 to 40 late yester
day, with the office attributing most of the ad
ditional deaths to quake-related heart at
tacks.
Earlier yesterday, a 16th body was found
inside a flattened apartment building in
Northridge, the epicenter of the powerful
earthquake that struck before dawn Monday.
But that was only the worst toll paid by
people in this battered city.
Once again, the rhythms of life in South
ern California were snapped by disaster,
much as they were after last fall's wildfires
and the Los Angeles riots 21 months ago.
And the effects of this disaster on the day
to-day lives of residents were likely to reach
farther and last longer.

National Guard soldiers patrol the area near a collapsed apartment building in North
rldge yesterday.
"The days ahead will also be
rough for us," Mayor Richard
Riordan warned Angelenos, even
as he praised them for a cool-head
ed response to the crisis. "Let's all
stick together."
A snapshot of a region in crisis
yesterday:
• The Federal Emergency Man
agement Agency said it expected to
spend at least $1 billion on quake
repairs. The 1989 earthquake in
the San Francisco Bay Area cost
an estimated $5.9 billion.
• More than 100 of the city's
750 public schools were seriously
damaged. Many offices and stores
were closed, and workers were
urged to stay home. But the clo
sure of four of the nation's busiest
freeways or highways made com
muting a frustrating adventure.
• Aftershocks, some nearing 5
on the Richter scale, continued to
jolt the region.
• About 100,000 homes re
mained without power, and
between 50,000 and 100,000 were
without water, almost all of them
in the hard-hit San Fernando Val
ley. The Department of Water and
Power said it could be a week or
more before water was restored.
Broken water lines and power
problems at two treatment facili
ties in the San Fernando Valley

have forced officials to draw sup
plies from holding ponds, and
those ponds could run dry by early
today, utility officials said.
• Ix>s Angeles County hospitals
said they had treated 2,863
patients for quake-related injuries,
530 of them serious enough to
require hospitalization.
• About 20,000 people were
camping in parks, the Department
of Parks and Recreation said, and
4,000 people spent Monday night
in 25 emergency shelters.
• More than 2,000 National
Guard soldiers were mobilized;
many could be seen patrolling the
San Fernando Valley, guns at their
sides.
After a dusk-to-dawn curfew,
police reported about 75 arrests
overnight for crimes such as rob
bery and curfew violation. The
curfew was extended through this
morning.
The White House announced
that President Clinton would fly to
Southern California today to sur
vey the damage.
Yesterday, Pete Wilson, who
has fended off fire, flood, riots and
recession as California's governor,
answered questions outside the
crushed apartment building in
Northridge, the site of the greatest
number of fatalities.
He acknowledged the effects of
the quake — in particular the free
way closures — would linger for a
long time.
"Unfortunately, it is going to be

a major, major inconvenience," he
said.
A potentially more serious
problem involved the city's dwin
dling water supply.
Bob Gomperz, a spokesman for
the Metropolitan Water District,
said crews were working to restore
service to one of the treatment
plants by late this afternoon. "It's
a race against time," he said.
The California Department of
Transportation said it hoped to
rebuild the damaged freeways by
the end of the year — a crash pro
gram that is expected to cost at
least $100 million.
The quake collapsed sections of
Interstate 10, the Santa Monica
Freeway, as well as sections of
Interstate 5 and state Routes 14
and 118, all vital links in the
region's freeway network.
Dean Dunphy, director of the
state Business, Transportation
and Housing Agency, predicted
that a detour around the damaged
portion of 1-5 could be created
within two weeks.
That would reopen the major
north-south highway on the West
Coast, whose economic importance
was underscored yesterday when
Los Angeles-bound truckers were
left stranded in the San Joaquin
Valley north of the city.
The Santa Monica Freeway, the
nation's busiest highway, is of
equal importance locally. Near the
freeway's collapsed overpasses
Tuesday morning, traffic crawled

on Fairfax Avenue at a rate of
about four blocks per hour.
