# L.A. reeling from quake
## 40 dead; $1B damage 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Under skies as
bright and blue as ever, Southern Californi
ans confronted a changed world yesterday.
The defining features of this region's life
— water, power and freeways — were sud
denly uncertain. In their place: long lines,
hellish commutes and constant earthquake
aftershocks.
The county coroner's office raised the
quake's death toll from 34 to 40 late yester
day, with the office attributing most of the ad
ditional deaths to quake-related heart at
tacks.
Earlier yesterday, a 16th body was found
inside a flattened apartment building in
Northridge, the epicenter of the powerful
earthquake that struck before dawn Monday.
But that was only the worst toll paid by
people in this battered city.
Once again, the rhythms of life in South
ern California were snapped by disaster,
much as they were after last fall's wildfires
and the Los Angeles riots 21 months ago.
And the effects of this disaster on the day
to-day lives of residents were likely to reach
farther and last longer.
