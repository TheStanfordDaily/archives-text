MOSCOW (AP) — The government's key
reformer reportedly resigned from the Cabi
net yesterday amid signs that Russian Presi
dent Boris Yeltsin is slowing radical reforms
following the electoral victory of communists
and nationalists.
In {mother indication of a possible turn
about by Yeltsin, Russia's foreign minister
yesterday called for keeping Russian troops
stationed in other former Soviet republics.
Finance Minister Boris Fyodorov, an
advocate of fiscal and monetary restraint,
resigned yesterday, the ITAR-Tass news
agency and radio Ekho Moskvy said. Fyodor
ov's spokeswoman Olga Leonova denied the
reports, but said it was unclear whether Fyo
dorov would stay in the Cabinet.
Economists and analysts said that Fyo
dorov's reported departure — the latest in a
series of reformers' resignations — would
indicate a victory for the "go-slow approach"
to reforms advocated by Prime Minister Vik
tor Chernomyrdin.
The White House said yesterday that Fyo
dorov's reported departure doesn't suggest
Yeltsin hiis broken the commitment he gave
President Clinton last week to continue
reforms.
