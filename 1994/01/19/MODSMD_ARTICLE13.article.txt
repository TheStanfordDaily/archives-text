# Report: Reagan allowed cover-up of scandal
## Prosecutor concludes Iran-Contra investigation 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Reagan acquiesced in a cover-up
of the Iran-Contra scandal that was
spearheaded by Attorney General
Edwin Meese and carried out at the
top levels of the Reagan administra
tion, an independent prosecutor con
cluded in his final report released
yesterday.
In two volumes that were immedi
ately denounced by Reagan, Meese,
ex-President Bush and others, Iran-
Contra prosecutor Lawrence Walsh
declared that Reagan's aides with
held information on the scandal from
prosecutors and Congress.
Impeachment of Reagan "cer
tainly should have been consid
ered" by the congressional commit
tees investigating the Iran-Contra
affair, Walsh told a news confer
ence. But Walsh would not say
whether he had favored impeach
ment and added that the cover-up
made it hard for Congress to con
sider such a step.
Reagan ad led Walsh's report a
"vehicle for baseless accusations that
he could never have proven in court."
Walsh's report portrays Bush as
more fully informed about the scan
dal than he has acknowledged. And it
reveals that prosecutors wanted to
question Bush about entries in his

diaries suggesting a high-level effort
in November 1986 to coerce then-
Secretary of State George Shultz
into following the administration
line on Iran-Contra.
Walsh also criticized Bush's par
dons of ex-Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger and five other Iran-Con
tra figures as either "an act of friend
ship or an act of self-protection." The
pardons were issued on Christmas
Eve 1992, two weeks before the
scheduled start of Weinberger's
criminal trial â€” in which Bush was a
potential witness.
"President Reagan, the secretary
of state, the secretary of defense, and
the director of central intelligence
and their necessary assistants com
mitted themselves, however reluc
tantly," to secretly arming the
Nicaraguan Contras and to dealing
arms to Iran to gain release of Amer
icans held hostage in the Middle
East, Walsh's report said.
"They skirted the law; some of
them broke the law, and almost all of
them tried to cover up the presi
dent's willful activities," Walsh's
report concluded.
Walsh's portrait of misconduct at
the top of the administration rewrote
the history of the seven-year-old
scandal originally dismissed by the

Reagan administration as involving
no illegality and later portrayed by
congressional investigators as the
product of a handful of uncontrolled
aides.
Walsh's report said that there was
"no credible evidence that President
Reagan violated any criminal
statute.
"Nevertheless, he set the stage for
the illegal activities of others by
encouraging and in general terms
ordering" military aid to the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua at a time when
Congress banned such aid, the report
said.
When the Iran arms sales became
public in 1986, Reagan "knowingly
participated or at least acquiesced in
the efforts" of his top aides to cover
up Reagan's prior approval of a
November 1985 delivery of Hawk
missiles to Iran, which Reagan's
aides feared had been illegal, the
report said.
Those criticized by Walsh reacted
angrily. Other responses to the
report divided along party lines.
Meese denied that he knew in
1986 of Reagan's role in the Hawk
shipment. "It was a dishonest report,
it made false statements and false
accusations," Meese said in an inter
view.
