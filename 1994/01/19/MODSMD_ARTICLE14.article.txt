### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Retired
Admiral Bobby Inman withdrew yes
terday as defense secretary nominee,
saying he was "distressed and dis
tracted" by attacks on his character
and reputation. President Clinton
accepted the surprise withdrawal and
began a fresh search to fill the post
Lea Aspin is soon to leave.
Inman, a former deputy CIA direc
tor, accused his critics of "modern
McCarthy ism."
In a rambling, hour-long news con
ference in Austin, Texas, he lashed
out at the news media, in particular
accusing New York Times columnist

William Safire and Senate Republican
leader Bob Dole of plotting to under
mine his nomination.

"I did not want this joh," said
Inman, 62, now a Texas businessman.
"I'm at peace with myself."
Even though Clinton had been
given advance word of Inman's deci
sion, the dramatic exit sent shock
waves through Washington and mys
tified lawmakers of both parties.
"He's probably not qualified to be
secretary of defense if he has fantasies
like that," Dole said in a speech to a
business group in Columbia, S.C.
LJp until yesterday's announce

ment, Inman had been viewed as like
ly to be easily confirmed.
Clinton accepted Inman's decision
"with regret."
"While I understand the personal
considerations that have led you to
this decision, I am nevertheless sad
dened that our nation will be denied
your service," Clinton told him in a
brief letter.
White House Communications
Director Mark Gearan said a choice of
a successor is "not imminent." Clin
ton has done "preliminary work. He
wants to talk to some people," Gearan
said.

Inman, a retired four-star admiral,
had been expected to face questions
about his private-sector dealings with
the defense industry in confirmation
hearings scheduled for next week. In
addition, he was expected to be asked
about his failure to pay Social Securi
ty taxes for a domestic helper. He
recently paid about $6,000 in back
taxes.
But Inman suggested neither of
these concerns had been the deciding
factor in his decision.
"I'm simply not prepared to pay the
current cost of public service in dis
tortion of my record," he said.
