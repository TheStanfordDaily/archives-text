## Editorials Res Ed's bottom line 
### 
IN THE BULLETIN distributed
to prospective Stanford appli
cants, Residential Education is
described as "a vital adjunct to
classroom learning."
Despite this declaration of Res
Ed's significance, Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds
announced that Res Ed will now
fall under the jurisdiction of Hous
ing and Dining Services, instead of
directly reporting to Edmonds.
Although this move has been
called an central part of budget
restructuring, it raises some frus
trating questions about one of
Stanford's unique features.
How can the importance of Res
Ed remain intact if it is being
moved down lower on the prover
bial Student Affairs totem pole? It
seems inevitable that this move
would decrease Res Ed's visibility
as a memorable and special experi
ence for students. Furthermore,
under its new authority, Res Ed
may lose some flexibility in it's

ideas, as Housing and Dining Ser
vices tends to look more at the
"bottom line."

This move also seems incongru
ous with the work being done by
the Commission on Undergraduate
Education. Edmonds has said that
the search for a permanent Res Ed
director will be postponed until the
future of Student Affairs is deter
mined, a fate which will be based
partly on CUE's recommendations.
If Ed-monds is seriously following
this strategy, it would be logical to
also hold off on restructuring the
authorities over Res Ed until CUE
has completed its charge.
Hopefully, this administrative
change is not a predictor of future
blows to Res Ed. Administrators
and those involved in Res Ed may
now need to make a more conscious
effort to see that all the beneficial
aspects of Res Ed — dorm pro
grams, speakers and in-dorm advis
ing — remain an integral part of a
Stanford education.
