# Storage issue: solved
## 
### 
WELL IT'S about time.
After dozens of promises,
half-baked alternatives
and failed attempts to woo the
administration's support, stu
dents will once again have on
campus summer storage.
Through the efforts of ASSU
Senate Chair Greg Waldorf and
the Council of Presidents, stu
dents will be able to store their
belongings on a first-come, first
served basis at three campus loca
tions. Finally, the administration
has acknowledged that storage is
a pressing concern for Stanford's
student body and agreed to take
this need seriously.
Last year students were forced
to search high and low for reason
able storage rates or transporta
tion to get to off-campus storage
facilities — without any appeal
ing alternatives. This was an
unacceptable situation.
Although the storage will not
be dormitory-based as in previous

years, students should nonethe
less be encouraged by the move.
In a time when student services
stand to be trimmed to the bone,
the administration's willingness
to meet a serious student need is
a refreshing development.
As for the ASSU Senate and
the COFJ both of which have fre
quently voiced their intentions to
tackle the summer-storage issue,
this offering goes a long way
toward boosting student confi
dence in the intentions and effec
tiveness of their student repre
sentatives.
Floundering attempts at re
solving the problem — such as
last year's proposed metal stor
age bins — called the organiza
tion's competence into question.
Regaining summer storage is a
step in the right direction for the
ASSU, and this victory stands as
a testament to the student associ
ation's commitment to pressing
student concerns.
