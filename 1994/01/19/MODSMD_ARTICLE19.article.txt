## Those skivvies in the sky 
### 
MARKY MARK has risen far and
above his call of duty. Who can
remember a time when his
sheepish smile and chiseled torso
belonged only to the Funky Bunch
rather than Calvin Klein? His black
and-white image, brief, boxer or Kate
Moss-clad, has become omnipresent.
He smiles out at you from the sides of
buses, magazine pages, billboard signs;
he even came wrapped around one of
my holiday gifts this year.
I witnessed what must have been his
most extreme appearance this summer
while in East Hampton, a beach town
where Calvin makes his home: at a
place about a mile from the ocean I
glanced up to see a 100-foot Marky
Mark sailing across the sky. From my
vantage I couldn't see the boat that was
pulling the banner, and so it looked like
he was simply free-floating.
Whether this was Calvin's way of
saying "Buy my underwear" or only
"Marky's coming for dinner," I still
don't know. Either way, Mr. Mark's
demigod largeness ballooning above the
beach crowd seemed ironically sugges
tive of the status of fashion in our daily
lives. It was as if Marky Mark, in a deep
and booming voice, was professing his
message to the crowd: EVEN YOUR
UNDERWEAR MATTERS.
But, of course, it has worked. An
image of a muscled boy and a thin,
high-cheek-boned girl striking sordid

black-and-white poses now screams
CALVIN KLEIN, and has driven all
those who strive for the chic and tres
fashionable out to the stores to buy the
jockeys off M.M.'s backside (to be worn
with jeans low enough to read the illus
trious name of a man who probably has
his briefs imported from Italy while the
ones that bear his name tag are made in
Taiwan). I'm being sarcastic, but I'm as
much a believer as everyone else.
Fashion has been around since peo
ple started wearing clothes, and it
serves all sorts of purposes. For some
it's a way to belong, for others it's a
way to stand out. It's a way of telling all
the people who pass something about
yourself. Everyone falls victim to it,
whether you wear Tevas and tie-dye,
jeans and beer T-shirts, a three-piece
suit, or Doc Martens and a page-boy
haircut.
Admittedly, some take things a bit
too far. This thought realized itself fully
to me while at the Limelight, a New
York night club known for, well, a cer
tain bizarreness. Suffice to say that club
dancers in spike heels (female or male,
makes no difference) shimmy and
gyrate above the dance-floor in cages.
Note that this club is frequented either
by people dressed in highly "alterna
tive" styles or yuppies who envy the
alternative. While in the ladies' room an
extremely tall and thin man walked in
wearing nothing but a red wrestling

suit superhero-type leotard and vinyl,
knee-high, lace-up, silver platform
boots. He began telling me the locations
of some of his recent body piercings, one
of which the males reading this would
groan at in disbelief, after which he
asked for my name to put on the guest
list of his future parties. I politely
declined. I remember thinking that per
haps the boots were a little bit much.
Still, a little funkiness wouldn't do
us any harm. Perhaps universities Inst
their panache when Oxford no longer
insisted that students wear their black
scholarly robes (imagine the number of
bicycle accidents every time they
caught in the spokes of a back bicycle
wheel). But things are not a complete
loss. After all, we still have Marky
Mark, a man whose face, at the rate
that it is multiplying, may one day
replace our first president's on the dol
lar bill. While the world pitches and
spins in the throws of this stormy
decade, at least Americans can sleep
well knowing that beneath the clothes
of their neighbors, friends and lovers,
people are well clad.

Although Nicole finds Mcirky Mark
appealing, she admits that she prefers
her men boxer-clad.
