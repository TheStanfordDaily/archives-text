# Quake experts clarify disaster

Although most Stanford earthquake ex
perts flocked to the Los Angeles area yester
day in order to study the effects of the devas
tating temblor, those who remained on cam
pus offered their interpretations of the 6.6-
magnitude earthquake.
According to Geophysics Prof. Paul Segall,
the Monday morning quake was caused by a
"blind thrust," which occurs when one side of
the fault slides up over the other. "It involves
a vertical motion," Segall said.
"We call it a blind thrust because the fault
trace didn't rupture all the way up to the sur
face," he said. "It didn't break the ground. . . .
You can't know that it's there just by looking
at the ground surface."
Scientists have not yet determined which
fault was responsible for the quake. "We're
not sure exactly where this fault is yet," Segall
said. "We know where the really big faults are
that are capable of creating an eight earth-
quake. We don't know where the
smaller faults are that can create
a six and a half or a seven."
The difficulty in locating the
fault is due to the fact that many
of the aftershocks have not yet
been placed, he said.
Segall said the Southern Cali
fornia quake will have "no major
impact on the way we view earth
quakes. Nothing that I know
about is that surprising. We don't
have to throw out any theories or
anything."
He attributed the extensive
damage it caused to the location
of the quake. "There was so much
damage because it is a highly
urbanized area," he said.
Segall said there was no corre
lation between the time of day
and the time that the quake
struck. "Time occurrence is com
pletely random," he said.
"We, the geological communi
ty, know that the area [southern
California] is an earthquake
prone region," he said.
Two factors clued geologists in

to this fact. The "youthful" San
Gabriel Mountains have an
"active uplift," according to
Segall. "The reason they are
standing up so high is because
they've been pushed up by earth
quakes."
The 1971 San Fernando earth
quake, which also measured 6.6
on the Richter scale, was another
indication that the area is prone
to earthquakes.
Although the Los Angeles
quake is not expected to have any
effect on earthquake forecasts
for the Bay Area, that does not
mean that Stanford is without
risks.
"The risk here is lower than
those associated with the Los
Angeles area," Segall said, but he
pointed out that there are faults
running through campus. The
Stanford Fault runs near
Junipero Serra Boulevard.
Another runs through the Inner
Quad.
"They are clearly smaller
faults," Geophysics Prof. George
Thompson said. "We don't expect
them to do anything as big as the
main plate boundary in size or
frequency."
