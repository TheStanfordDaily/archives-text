## Provost explains current, future issues in budget cuts 
### 
WE ARE about to begin the process
of producing a budget for the
University. Administrators from
every part of campus are preparing multi
year plans and identifying potential bud
get reductions for their units. There is a
great temptation to say, "Here we go
again." After all, Stanford has adjusted
its basic operating budget by more than
$60 million over the past four years
through a combination of expense reduc
tions and increased revenues. But this
time, if we do our jobs well, we will have
done much more than just cut budgets.
We will have established new ways of
planning and decision-making that will
put Stanford on sustainable economic
footing even in the face of increasing
financial pressures.
Our problem is simple but the stakes
are high. We are spending more unre
stricted money than we are taking in.
These continuing deficits leave us virtual
ly no funding for innovation and selective
growth. A leading university must always
look to the future. It must support facul
ty and students in the search for new
knowledge; nurture new, better and tech

nologically up-to-date ways to teach and
learn; continually renew its faculty; and
provide modern facilities and equipment.
We have no reason to believe that our
revenue will increase substantially in the
next decade. If we are to innovate, we
must do so within our means. The budget
and planning process must produce
opportunities to restructure in order to
free up resources to strengthen existing
programs and create new ones.
Let me assure you that we are at the
beginning of this process, not the end. We
need a focused and broad-based discus
sion of some of the options before us. The
range of options is not infinite. The
administrative unit heads have taken the
lead in developing proposals for change.
There will be Town Meetings and I wel
come further comments by letter or e
mail on the choices that we must make.
The time is unfortunately short. Presi
dent Casper and I must submit a final
budget to the Board of Trustees in June.
General fund allocations to the units
must be made before that — at least by
the end of March — in order to allow
them time to plan for next year.

I have asked each academic and
administrative department in the Univer
sity to look seriously for ways to restruc
ture. In some cases, this will mean find
ing ways to be more efficient, to do more
with fewer resources. After several years
of belt-tightening, there may not be many
such opportunities. More likely, we will
need to decide if there are some activities
that we can do without.
In academic areas, I have asked the
deans to review each department and pro
gram with questions such as: How good is
the program and how do we know that it
is good? Is it attracting the best graduate
students in the nation? Is it serving the
undergraduate curriculum well and are
the faculty sufficiently engaged in teach
ing? Where it is appropriate, are the fac
ulty competing effectively for external
research support? Are there important
academic links with other departments
and programs in the University? Are the
directions of the discipline clear and are
we well-positioned to be at the forefront
of the discipline? Is this a good use of
resources given everything else we would
like to do? And finally, does this program

support broad institutional objectives,
such as the need to recruit top minority
and women faculty, and our desire to
enhance international themes in our edu
cational and research programs?
Another set of questions pertain to
administrative areas. Is this service or
function critical to the academic mission
of the University? If so, is it being done as
efficiently as possible? Can we reorganize
or invest in new information systems in
order to reduce workloads? Would we be
better served by having the service per
formed by someone else? What would be
the consequences of not providing this
service at all?
The good news in all of this is that we
have an opportunity to strengthen the
University for the long run. We have no
choice. We must be as demanding of our
selves and of each other in the best inter
ests of the institution. I appreciate the
good will and sincere effort demonstrated
thus far. I look forward to a period of live
ly and constructive discussion about the
choices ahead of us.
