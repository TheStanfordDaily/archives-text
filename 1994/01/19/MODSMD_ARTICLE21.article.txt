## Genetically engineered bacterium simulates evolution 
### Heather Carlson 
Asst. Chemical Engineering Prof.
Chaitan Khosla has topped "The
Medicine Man" with the development
of an 'evolutionary simulator' that
eliminates the need for trips to the
Amazon jungle to find rare molecules
for medicines.
The evolutionary simulator dupli
cates the processes of nature that
produce polyketide molecules.
Polyketides have been used to make
antibiotics and anti-cancer drugs, and
even to prevent the body from reject
ing organ implants, Khosla said.
In nature, a bacterium produces a
particular type of polyketide, but
Khosla and his group wanted to
genetically engineer a bacterium that
would produce many different types
of polyketides, according to Bob
McDaniel, a graduate student work
ing with Khosla.
Khosla brought the project to
Stanford after working on it with a
researcher at the John Innes Insti
tute in England.
After two years of work and collab

oration with the John Innes Institute,
the research team has genetically
engineered a bacterium that can pro
duce at least 20 different polyketides.
This bacterium is called the 'evolu
tionary simulator' because it imitates
the process by which natural com
pounds produce chemical diversity.
Genetic material is taken out of a
host bacterium and put into the sim
ulator. Now that researchers have a
functioning bacterium, they can
manipulate the DNA so the simulator
will produce many different kinds of
polyketides.
The advantage of humans dupli
cating nature is that novel polyke
tides not found in nature can be cre
ated by manipulating the DNA in the
simulator.
The novel polyketides could possi
bly lead to new drugs in the future or
improve existing drugs.
"We'd like to be able to make thou
sands of different molecules,"
McDaniel said, indicating that only
one in 100 polyketides produced by
the evolutionary simulator may be
useful for medicine.

Although drug companies are
mainly concerned about polyketides
and their potential uses for new
drugs, Khosla's research focuses on
the enzymes that catalyze the synthe
sis of the polyketides.
"The enzymes must be doing a lot
of tricks," Khosla said of the ones
that help to make polyketides.
Relatively few enzymes are needed
to catalyze hundreds of different
polyketides, and Khosla hopes to
understand how the enzymes can cre
ate such diverse products.
Khosla said he does not plan to
concentrate on the process of making
the polyketides into therapeutic
drugs.
"My job is to teach students and
certainly not to make money for Stan
ford," he said.
Earlier this year, however, Stan
ford applied for a patent on Khosla's
polyketide process, and Exogene Cor
poration has received rights to the
new technology.
"This is something very new I that)
hasn't been done before. It's at the
forefront," McDaniel said.
