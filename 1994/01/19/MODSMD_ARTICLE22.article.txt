# Un-circumcised boys don't develop psychological problems

/'"V I have often wondered about
K/the controversy regarding
circumcision. Some people say it
is a barbaric custom that should
be banned, whereas others say
it's really important to a man's
health. Which is it?

A: The lead that I originally
wrote for this week was con
sidered inappropriate for the
generally virginal, easily shocked
Stanford readership. As a conse
quence, my editor shaved the
first inch or two off my column.
For those of you who are unfa
miliar with the custom of cir
cumcision, I will now describe it
in the most explicit, bloody and
offensive detail possible.
Circumcision, broadly speak
ing, is the surgical removal of the
penile foreskin. In the Judeo-
Christian tradition (including, of
course, Islam), it is customarily
performed soon following the
birth of a male child. Originally
carried out according to religious
precepts, it has worked its way
into Western medicine, and until
a few years ago was roughly as
common as tying or clamping the
umbilicus.
But as one (almost definitely
circumcised) man might sing,
"The times. . .they are. . .a
changin'. " Whereas almost all
American boys born in the 1950s

were circumcised, now almost
half are not. This statistic owes
itself in part to the explosive
growth among ethnic popula
tions (e.g. African-Americans
and Latinos) who were never
that big on circumcision, but also
to a growing consciousness

among new par
ents and medi
cal professionals
that unless
one's deity in
structs one to do
so, there isn't
much benefit in
circumcising
one's sons.

In fact, there
is some evidence that circumci
sion — rather than being a mere
ly take-it-or-leave-it sort of prac
tice — may be medically inadvis
able. Morbidity among circum
cised males (usually a result of
infection initiated at the time of
the operation) is somewhat high
er than among uncircumcised
men (again, due to infections,
usually due to poor genital
hygiene).
Knowledge of these medical
problems, coupled with general
feelings of resentment on the
part of certain men who feel they
were forced into a useless opera
tion, robbed of a portion of their
manhood and basically shafted
(heh) before they were old
enough to know better, has led to
the rise of at least two national
organizations — INTACT and

NO-CIRC, don't ask me what the
acronyms mean — whose raison
d'etre is the abolition of circum
cision, except in cases of incest or
rape.
After all, who would think of
performing appendectomies at
birth to prevent appendicitis later

in life, or castra
tion to prevent
testicular can
cer? These analo
gies are so
strained as to be
irrelevant, but
members of the
aforementioned

two organiza-

tions often base
their rhetoric on them, so I
thought I'd mention them just to
be fair.
Of concern to the equally
powerful pro-circumcision lob
by, however, is the widely ig
nored issue of "penile identity."
Those who stay up nights think
ing about this issue argue as fol
lows:
What would happen to a poor
uncircumcised young boy who
sees his father's well-trimmed
member during one of those for
mative first showers and won
ders, "Why isn't mine like that?
Is there something wrong with
me?"
And later, when the boy
reaches adolescence and has to
shower with his peers after P.E.
class, won't the circumcised boys
all tease him? "Ha, ha, Johnny's

not circumcised, his father
couldn't afford the opera
tion. . . With such grievous
trauma under his belt, young
Johnny would surely be well on
his way to becoming another
Hannibal Lecter.
Fissentially the penile identity
argument boils down to the
assertion that men whose penis
es don't look like their fathers' or
their friends' will suffer some
how. I don't buy it: Cut or uncut,
by size alone a child's penis is
hardly comparable to his father's
(unless his father happens to be
John Bobbit).
The issue of penile identity
problems vis-a-vis other children
(or perhaps that should be coq-a
-co q?) is also easily dismissed:
Psychological data show very lit
tle evidence of maladjustment on
the part of uncircumcised boys
even in almost entirely circum
cised peer groups, and now that
the stats are swinging around to
an even split (heh) between those
who is and those who ain't, these
entirely circumcised peer groups
should be becoming increasingly
rare.
So, there you have it. The Sci
ence Bug is riding the fence (and
noticing that even in this com
promising position, the issue of
circumcision doesn't make much
of a difference).
