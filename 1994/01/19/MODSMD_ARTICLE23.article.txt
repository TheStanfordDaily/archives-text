# Clinical trial tests over-the-counter AIDS drug
## 
### Steve Bait Staff writer 
Stanford AIDS researchers are preparing
to conduct the first clinical study in the
United States of a drug called N-acetylcys
teine that may slow down the HIV virus.
Although the anti-HIV medication is
readily available in a non-prescription
strength in health food stores and under
ground "AIDS buyers clubs," Genetics
Profs. Leonard and Leonore Herzenberg are
looking for clinical evidence to support fur
ther uses for the drug in AIDS treatment.
They are currently looking for members
of the Hay Area's sizable HIV-positive popu
lation to participate in their study, which is
scheduled to begin later this month.
The project will assess the effect of N
acetylcysteine (NAC) on patients infected
with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. NAC
is currently used clinically in cases of
Tylenol overdose.
In addition, many HIV-positive individu
als take it"and some have reported
increased energy," said Greg Dubs, a
research associate with the project. "It'll be
interesting to see if that's affected" in the
current study.
The main focus of the study, though, is to
determine whether NAC actually slows
down the HIV virus.

Popular support for the use of NAC in
AIDS treatment stems from its potential to
raise levels of glutathione in patients' cells.
Stanford researchers hope to confirm this
elevation of glutathione in their study.
Glutathione is an antioxidant that appears
to inhibit the replication of the HIV virus in
laboratory experiments. Most HIV-positive
patients, however, are burdened by low glu
tathione levels, which could augment the
reproduction and propagation of the virus.
The Herzenbergs and their colleagues
hope that test results showing a favorable
NAC effect on glutathione levels will lead to
the possible introduction of NAC as an
adjunct to other AIDS medication.
The Herzenbergs' study will be conducted
at a temporary location in San Francisco's
Castro district. During the eight-week trial,
64 subjects will visit the site every other
week, when blood samples will be drawn and
transported to Stanford for laboratory anal
ysis
"Eight weeks is not a significant time for
intervening therapeutically," Dubs said. But
evidence of the drug's effectiveness — such
as higher glutathione levels and higher T
cell counts — may lead to more extensive tri
als in the future.
"If we show positive results, then it will
be easier to get funding for a larger trial,"
Dubs said. The researchers plan to petition

the drug's manufacturer and the National
Cancer Institute, the agency funding the
trial, for an extension.
To assist with their research, the Herzen
bergs and their colleagues have enlisted the
aid of student volunteers to help with the
study.
According to Herzenberg, the extra effort
is necessary for the "technically demanding
work" of flow cytometry, a sophisticated cell
separation and analysis technique the
Herzenbergs pioneered in the early 1980s,
which allows them to measure as many as 25
or 30 different characteristics in a single
blood sample.
The research team is currently seeking
HIV-positive individuals to participate in
their study. Advertisements in major Bay
Area newspapers have led to a "deluge of
responses"— nearly 250 in all. But Dubs
reports that only 25 qualified subjects have
been identified after preliminary screening.
To qualify, male or female volunteers
must be HIV positive and have CD4 T-cell
counts lower than 500, according to Laura
Goldbaum, a research nurse with the pro
ject. They must also be healthy enough to
visit the San Francisco site every other week
for the required blood sampling during the
trial. Volunteers who meet these conditions
will be chosen for the trial if their glu
tathione levels are particularly low.
