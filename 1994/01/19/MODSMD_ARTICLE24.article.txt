# Northridge earthquake seismograph
## 
### 
Stanford earthquake researchers
recorded this seismograph of
the Northridge earthquake that
occurred Monday at 4:30 a.m.
The total time elapsed between
ends of the line is 1,000 sec
onds. The first seismic waves to
hit the Northridge area are
referred to as the p-waves. The
consequent shaking comes with
the following s-waves. Earth
quake re-searchers use the time
differential between the p- and s
waves to determine how far away
the earthquake hit.
