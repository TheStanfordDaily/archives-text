# $1.3 million grant funds research on anorexia, bulimia
## 
### Angela Kalmer 
Stanford researchers recent
ly received more than $1 mil
lion to bolster their work on
eating disorders such as
anorexia and bulimia.
The McKnight Foundation,
a private charity organization
that supports scientific
research, awarded Stanford
$ 1,374,300 to address the grow
ing problem of eating disorders.

In general, anorex
ia and bulimia arise
in adolescence, a
time of social tran
sition from a focus
on the family to the
indivdual.

The money will be used to
research the diagnosis and
treatment of anorexia and
bulimia, to develop ways to
measure risk factors in adoles
cents, to carry out an exten
sive follow-up study on
patients and to establish an
eating-disorders data center at
Stanford which will collect
and analyze the pooled infor
mation.
Stanford is "one of the
major half-dozen centers in
the world which specializes in
eating-disorders research,"
said Psychiatry Prof. Stewart
Agras.
Studies on bulimia nervosa
treatment will start immedi
ately, and anorexia treatment
studies will start in April.
Characterized by extreme
weight loss and an inaccurate
perception of one's own body,
anorexia can lead to intention
al starvation and loss of con
tact with physiological sensa
tions, such as fullness, because
one's hormonal systems tend
to shut down to conserve ener
gy. Bulimia is characterized by
binge-eating and self-induced
purging.
Causes of eating disorders
In general, anorexia and
bulimia arise in adolescence, a
time of social transition from a
focus on the family to the indi
vidual.
Though the highest inci
dence of anorexia is found in
the upper socioeconomic stra
ta, anorexia also has a strong
genetic component.
Bulimia runs in families,
although nothing is known
about the genetics involved.
Family transmission of bulim
ia probably occurs through
psychological causes.
Treatment studies will com
pare two treatments for bulim
ia, anti-depressant medication
and interpersonal therapy.
These are secondary treat
ments for those who did not
respond to the widely used cog
nitive behavioral therapy.
Anti-depressants increase

levels of serotonin, a hormone
that affects hunger, in the
brain.

Although some evidence
indicates that serotonin levels
are low in bulimia patients, it
is not known whether this is a
cause or effect of the disorder.

Interpersonal therapy
offers a different approach by
directing discussion away from
eating patterns and focusing
instead on the patient's other
problems.
Preventive measures
In addition to treatment
studies, the research also
focuses on a means of preven
tion and follow-up after treat
ment — two areas that have
been largely neglected in past
research — will also be empha
sized.
Researchers are now asking
preventive questions, trying to
determine the risk factors that
lead to the development of an
eating disorder and how well
they can predict the develop
ment of a full syndrome.
Psychiatry Prof. Barr Tay
lor is the principal investigator
in the component of the pro
gram which aims to develop
adequate measures of risk fac
tors in children and adoles
cents.
So far, this has only been
done for adults, who are at a
different development stage
and have different eating
habits than children.
Patients from all studies
will go into long-term follow
up studies where their
progress will be assessed every
three months for five to 10
years. Previous studies met
with patients only once after a
year or so.
One major problem with
anorexia patients is relapse
after treatment. This is the
first study of methods aimed
at helping anorexics maintain
their weight after hospital
treatment.
The research will help fill
wide gaps in the data on eating
disorders in addition to aug
menting current knowledge of
effective treatment tech
niques.
Other schools to collect data
Agras chaired a committee
which set up the McKnight
Eating Disorders Program, a
multi-university, collaborative
research project, receiving a
total of $4.6 million from the
foundation.
Cornell University and the
University of Minnesota are
the other principal research
centers.
Although coordinating sev
eral universities to standard
ize methodologies is an enor
mous challenge, Agras said
that a larger, joint study will
have a greater impact on the
prevention and treatment of
eating disorders than a single
university's effort.
Also, the collaboration will
help researchers attain a larg
er sample pool which leads to
more definitive conclusions.
