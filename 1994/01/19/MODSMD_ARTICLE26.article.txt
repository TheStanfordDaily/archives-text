## A 						waterskiing team here at the Farm? New 'organization' hopes to make a big splash at Stanford 
### Robert Feagin 
From the annual overflow of new
life into Stanford's many water
reservoirs this year, a new organiza
tion is being born. That group is a
new student organization on cam
pus — a waterskiing team. Adrienne
Osborn, a sophomore at Stanford,
has been working assiduously on
creating this team since the early
fall and will be its leader and coordi
nator.
When working last summer at
the Mission Bay Aquatic Center in
San Diego, some of Osborn's co
workers who were involved in
waterskiing at their own colleges
suggested that she start up a Stan
ford team to compete in the nation
wide sport. Osborn decided to follow
their advice.
At present, this new waterskiing
team has qualified as a student-run
volunteer organization, even though
it may really seem more akin to a
club sport. The reason behind this
twisted phraseology is that the
Department of Athletics states that
no sport involving a motor may be
admitted to the club-sport roster.
Osborn hopes that this stipulation
will be changed in the future so that
her team can be included under the
umbrella of club sports.
In all other respects, however,
this season's waterskiing team will
be a club sport, and a fairly flexible
one at that. Anyone may join. Begin

ners, first-time skiers and everyone
else all the way up to the most
advanced participants are welcome
to join the organization. Competi
tion is not mandatory. One may sim
ply come out for practice and have
fun. At this time, there are 16 peo
ple who have voiced a desire to be
part of the competing team, and 19
others who merely wish to practice.
"Once spring comes around and
the weather starts getting warmer I
expect 10 to 15 more (people) to join
us," Osborn said.
At present, practices meet at the
Marina Lagoon in San Mateo during
the week and probably at Anderson
Lake on the weekends.
Competition will almost exclu
sively take place against other Cali
fornia teams, such as UC-Santa
Barbara, Cal and UC-San Diego.
While there are competing collegiate
teams from schools across the
nation, Stanford will only compete
against these colleges because of the
Farm's distance from other eastern
schools.
The waterskiing team has already
completed a "trial run" season, held
last fall. In October, there were two
competitions sponsored by UC-
Davis and Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
in which the young Stanford team
participated. All competitions are
sponsored by a certain school, and
invitations are offered to all avail
able teams. While the Stanford
squad clearly hopes to someday host

a tournament of its own, it will be
some time before the squad can sup
port such an endeavor.
Waterskiing competitions consist
of three primary events — slalom,
trick and jump skiing. Slalom, the
most common form of competition,
involves weaving with only one ski
through a series of six buoys. When
this task is completed, it is called a
pass. One continues to make passes
until the maximum speed (32 m.p.h.
for women, 34 m.p.h. for men), is
reached. The number of points that
one earns depends upon both the
speed reached and the number of
buoys that one passes through with
out falling down.
The next event, trick skiing,
involves performing various stunts
like side-sliding and 360- and 180-
degree jumps. Jumping can be done
well by only a very few skiers
because it is so difficult.
"The jump is really slick and if
you're cutting in any direction at all
when you hit the ramp, your skis
slide to the side and you fall over

sideways," Osborn said

The total team
score is comprised of
the sum of all the /

individuals'

scores.

Osborn stressed that new

members may start as slowly
as they wish and work their
way up in speed as they
become more experienced and
comfortable with the skis. In
addition, the team urgently

needs people who want to drive
the squad's boats, although pre
vious experience is necessary to
serve as a captain. Osborn
hopes that the team will be able
to employ the use of a Master- .
craft boat, the best of its kind,

in their competitions, as they have
expressed interest in arranging a
deal with a local boat dealer.
Osborn plans on the cost of the
entire venture to be covered by
membership dues (around $100 per
quarter), corporate sponsorships
and future fundraising. Further
more, she plans to offer two kinds of
membership dues, one for those who
simply want to practice with the
team and another which includes a
competition fee.
