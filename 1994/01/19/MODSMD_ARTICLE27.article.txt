# A 						solid strike
## Fencers place highly in North American tourney 
### Roger Han 
A small group of Stanford fencers dueled their way
to respectable finishes in the North American Cup
tournament, held over the weekend the University of
San Francisco. Topping the list of Stanford finishers
were Stephanie Wien, who placed 26th in epee, and
Chide Sladden, who also finished 26th, in foil.
The four-day competition, which concluded Mon
day, featured many of the finest fencers in the world,
including Olympic and World Champions.
The tournament, sponsored by the United States
Fencing Association (USFA), attracted over 1,200
fencers from 12 countries, the most countries ever
represented in the event.
"It was quite the international competition," said
Stanford women's fencing coach Sherry Posthumus.
The competition was divided into Senior (open to
all ages) and Under-20 divisions in foil and epee for
the women, and foil, epee and saber for the men. Com
petitors first fenced in a round-robin-style round
against five other competitors with the top fencers,
then advanced to the direct elimination rounds.
Four Cardinal women competed in the tourna
ment: Sophomore Stephanie Wien placed 26th in
Under-20 Epee, 32nd in Under-20 Foil, 73rd in Senior
Foil, and 97th in Senior Fpee. Sophomore Morgan
Hoch placed 36th in Senior Epee and 65th in Senior
Foil. Sophomore Chide Sladden took 26th in Under
-20 Foil and 111 th in Senior Foil. Junior Captain Anna
Cummins placed 86th in the Senior Foil division.
The competition was made tougher by a switch to a
single-loss direct elimination format from the original
two-loss elimination format. This gave the fencers
much less room for error.
"With the new format, a lot depends on how you
draw in direct elimination," Posthumus said.
"Stephanie didn't get the right people in the draw "
Wien drew the top seed in Under-20 Foil and lost to
her 15-5 in the second round of direct elimination.
She also suffered a disappointing loss to the fifth seed
in Under-20 Epee, 15-14.
Sladden was satisfied with her
place in Under-20 Foil. "I didn't
lose to anyone I shouldn't have,
and even won a few I wasn't
expected to," she said.
On the men's side, sophomore
Shil Sengupta placed 42nd in the
Under-20 saber division.
"I feel I could have done well,
but I didn't get into a groove," he
said. "But now I'm hungry to
make up for it in the rest of the
season."
Two other Cardinal men had
impressive performances. 1992

Olympian Nick Braven, who grad
uated from Stanford last year,
won the Senior Foil division. The
victory should propel him into
first place in points for the U.S.
National Team.
Sean McClain, a freshman who
is taking a year off to train in Ger
many before attending Stanford,
placed second in the Under-20
Foil division. He barely lost the
gold medal match 15-14 to Chris
Bayer from New York.
The Stanford men's and
women's teams will now prepare
for an important East Coast trip
next week, when they will fence
against the likes of talented Penn
State, University of Pennsylvania
and Notre Dame.
