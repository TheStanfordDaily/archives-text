"Go really fast, and when something gets in
your way, turn!"
This advice from the movie "Better off Dead"
was heeded this past weekend, as the men's and
women's ski teams took honors at their first of
five regional competitions at Boreal, Calif.
The women's squad enjoyed a great deal of
success, taking first place in the California divi
sion and third overall. The team finished ahead of
UC-Davis, California and Chico State, but fell
short of Sierra Nevada College and the Universi
ty of Nevada-Reno.
Stanford was led by team captain Margie Back
strom and senior skier Ali Solomon. The duo fin
ished bnck-to-back, taking 10th and 11th place
respectively. Backstrom finished with a combined
time of 1:19.43, while Solomon crossed the line at
1:20.18.
On Sunday Backstrom and Solomon led the way
once again for the Cardinal, taking the 10th and
Uth places once again. Both shaved four seconds
