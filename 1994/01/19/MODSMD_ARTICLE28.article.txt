"Go really fast, and when something gets in
your way, turn!"
This advice from the movie "Better off Dead"
was heeded this past weekend, as the men's and
women's ski teams took honors at their first of
five regional competitions at Boreal, Calif.
The women's squad enjoyed a great deal of
success, taking first place in the California divi
sion and third overall. The team finished ahead of
UC-Davis, California and Chico State, but fell
short of Sierra Nevada College and the Universi
ty of Nevada-Reno.
Stanford was led by team captain Margie Back
strom and senior skier Ali Solomon. The duo fin
ished bnck-to-back, taking 10th and 11th place
respectively. Backstrom finished with a combined
time of 1:19.43, while Solomon crossed the line at
1:20.18.
On Sunday Backstrom and Solomon led the way
once again for the Cardinal, taking the 10th and
Uth places once again. Both shaved four seconds
off their times, though, with
Backstrom finishing with a com
bined time of 1:15.36 and
Solomon following at 1:16.19.
The women's performances
put the team in prime position
for advancing to the regional
tournament, which top five
teams in the region will attend.
Backstrom said of the team's
performance, "Considering that
Sierra Nevada and UNR both
contain former World Cup skiers
and have taken the top two
places at nationals for three

years straight, Stanford's
women's team this year is excel
lent."
The captain adds that "[Stan
ford! probably would qualify for
nationals in any region in the
country except our own."
The men's team skied well but
did not place as high in the
standings as the women. The
team, which only returns two A
team skiers from last year, fin
ished fourth in the California
competition and sixth overall.
Saturday saw the emergence
of freshman slalomer Doug Mac-
Donald, who blazed the way for
the men with a time of 1:24.46.
The time earned Mac Donald a
20th-place finish.

Junior Brian Kirsch took 23rd
place on Sunday to lead the men
in red with a time of 1:19.37.
"We have a development team
program of 10-15 racers who are
not the A level yet," said sopho
more co-captain Brendan Kier
nan. "lAfter some work] we hope
to help them develop to A-calibre
and create a much stronger,
deeper men's team."
The ski team will see action
again this weekend at Northstar.
Ice Hockey
The Stanford hockey team
took two tough losses this past
weekend, in dropping a pair to
Arizona 8-3 and 6-4 at the Gold
en Gate Hockey Arena.

On Friday, the team was led
by Shawn Sarbacker, who netted
two goals. Luke Winter, who
played one of his best games of
the season, added two assists. In
addition, Bill Sutherland was
excellent in goal, allowing only
six goals to one of the most
potent offenses in the country.
Saturday saw Arizona pound
the Cardinal, as the stronger
Wildcats posted a five-goal victo
ry. The Stanford squad played
well, but was simply outmanned.
The Cardinal will be in action
once again this weekend as they
travel down to San Diego to take
on the Tritons of UC-San Diego
and the Aztecs of San Diego
State.
