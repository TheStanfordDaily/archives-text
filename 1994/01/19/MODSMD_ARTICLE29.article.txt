# Scholars, not spoilers
## Boycotted boycott a misguided mission 
### 
In the midst of NFL playoff games
this past weekend, college basket
ball nearly came to a standstill.
But in the end, the boycott was boy
cotted, or — so said members of the
Black Coaches Association (BCA) —
"postponed."

The BCA was upset at an NCAA
proposal made last week to reduce by
one the number of scholarships avail
able for men's basketball programs,
claiming that the move would dispro
portionately impact black athletes.
Along with reduced scholarships, the
NCAA also wanted to stiffen entrance

requirements for college athletes,
increasing the minimum grade-point
average from its current 2.0 to a 2.5.
As a result, many black coaches
threatened to boycott Saturday's
games in protest. Only the interven
tion of the Justice Department, which
promised to "monitor" the situation,
staved off the walk-out.
But as one of the NCAA's vice pres
idents correctly noted, the Justice
Department has as much business
overseeing intercollegiate athletic
reform as the NCAA does in making
proposals to refinance health care.
The last thing the NCAA needs is the
federal government stepping in, espe
cially when the NCAA's impending
reforms are progressive, not regres
sive.
Nolan Richardson, basketball
coach at Arkansas, objected to the
reforms, saying that "this decision is
about more than just scholarships."
Is it, Nolan? Heaven forbid that the
NCAA actually try to put a little col
lege into college athletics. Theoretical
ly, universities that field athletic

teams are supposed to be giving their
athletes an education. Try this one on
for size: before afternoon practice,
have your players go to class.
But seeing Richardson's point, at
many schools with high-powered bas
ketball programs, that might be too
much to ask.
Richardson's position, and that of
some other members of the BCA, is
that their basketball teams are a "safe
haven" from the streets. College
sports, though, were not designed to be
an either/or option with urban gangs.
Hidden behind Richardson's view
is that the NCAA is denying him the
opportunity to sign one more inner
city hoopster with a nice outside
jumper who will sell a few more tickets
or put the Razorbacks on television a
few more times. Never mind that the
kid reads at a fiflh-grade level.
Only 43 percent of male college bas
ketball players who started school in
1985-86 graduated from those institu
tions within six years, according to a
recent study by The Chronicle of High
er Education. Turning the tables, that

means that 57 percent of college bas
ketball players did NOT graduate.
Two-thirds of every collegiate starting
five walks away from school with a
closet full of high-tops, but no diploma.
And of those degree-less men, very
few go on to play in the NBA. The rest
are left with an unfulfilled promise of
a college education, an education
which would make them become pro
ductive citizens in the working world.
Raising the required entrance stan
dards will force those kids who want
to play to hit the books in high school.
Or, those kids can go to junior college
to get their academic skills on par with
their athletic ones.
The NCAA's proposals are a step
forward. If more programs existed like
Stanford, Duke, Georgetown, and
Notre Dame, these reforms would not
be necessary.
This is not racist. The NCAA's
decision was about education, and
should be applauded. The NCAA is
starting to look at these kids as people
first, athletes second. Shouldn't the
BCA do the same?
