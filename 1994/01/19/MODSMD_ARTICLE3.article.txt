# Stanford struggles to stay prepared
## 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
In the wake of the Los Angeles earth
quake, Stanford officials said they are con
fident in their preparations should a simi
lar disaster strike the Bay Area.
However, they agreed that the 6.6
tremor should serve as a warning to the
community to not become complacent as
the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake
which inflicted more than $'200 million

worth of damage on Stanford facilities —
fades from memory.
"It again reminds us that this could hap
pen at any time," said Keith Guy, the direc
tor of Housing and Food Services.
Although the University still encourages
safety and preparedness instruction at the
residence level, Guy lamented that interest
has fallen off in recent years. A training ses
sion for residence staff last vear, for in-
stance, was attended by only 30
resident assistants and resident
fellows.
Should a major quake strike,
Stanford has prepared an elabo
rate plan to ensure the safety and
welfare of residents if outside
help is slow to arrive.
For example, after the 1989
quake, Stanford emergency plan
ners buried 12 "silos" in various
parts of campus that each contain
enough food and supplies for 800
people for 72 hours, Guy said. He
said silo locations and instruc
tions on digging them up have
not yet been distributed to resi
dence staff, but he promised that
the information eventually will
be provided.
Part of police sta
tion would be converted into an
emergency operations center
which would coordinate support
services. Students from resi
dences would be sent to and from
the center to relay information
and instructions.
In addition, RA orientation
was expanded this year to include
a workshop on disaster prepared
ness, according to Residential
Education Co-Director Diana
Conklin. "We did more on earth
quake preparedness because this
was the first year of RAs who
hadn't been in a big earthquake,"
she said.

Stanford emergency
planners buried 12
silos' with food and
supplies in various
parts of campus.

But actual dormitory pro
gramming is still up to the resi
dence staff, which often rele
gates the subject of earthquake
preparedness to a few minutes at
a house meeting early in fall
quarter.
"We haven't had a specific pro
gram on earthquake prepared
ness |but| it's definitely [more]
possible in the future," said Palo
ma RA David Sapoznikow.
"We're not forced to do any
thing. . . . We're just given recom
mendations," he added. "Quite
honestly, I actually wish we had
done a little bit more."
Conklin said that her office
has already put out a reminder to
RFs to take another look at earth
quake preparedness in the dorm
after the Los Angeles disaster. "It
is very difficult to get people to
take it seriously," she said,
adding that Monday's devastat
ing quake makes now an oppor
tune time to encourage more dis
aster preparedness.
Still, Conklin said she thought
that "overall we're in pretty good
shape."
