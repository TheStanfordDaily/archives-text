# Men's tennis takes two titles in Pac-10 Indoors
## Cardinal seizes third, fourth flights; USC and UCLA shine 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Last weekend's Pacific 10 Conference Men's
Indoor Tennis Tournament in Seattle demonstrated
that while the Cardinal may be talented, it must
fight a battle with certain Southern neighbors to
claim conference honors.
"Contrary to their performances in Palm Springs
[at the National Collegiate Tennis Classic], I thought
USC and UCLA really stood out," said Stanford
head coach Dick Gould.
Playing in its second big tournament in as many
weekends, Stanford showed itself to be competitive,
if not dominant. The tournament, which was split
up into four separate flights with their own singles
and doubles draws, saw Stanford walk away with
champions in the third and fourth flights. Blessed
with depth, Stanford performed better in the lower
flights than at the top.
The first flight was a double disaster for the Car
dinal men — both defeats aiming at the hands of
Washington Huskies. Seniors Bobby Devens and
Michael Flanagan, the flight's second seed, fell in the
first round. Devens was summarily dismissed by the
Washington's Mark Tomandl, 6-2, 6-3, while Flana
gan lost to Washington's Ornello Arlati, 6-4, 7-5.
"Washington was rolling," Gould said. "It was
indoors, they had just come off a big win, and it was
in front of a home crowd. We just got blown out of
the water."
As first-round losers, both Devens and Flanagan
entered the consolation bracket. Devens, suffering
from minor injuries, defaulted in his first-round con
solation match. Flanagan, however, won three
straight matches to win the consolation draw, beat
ing UCIJVs Sebastien 1/cßlanc in the finals, 6-2,6-4.
"I tought Michael did a great job in the back
draw," Gould said. "For the defending champion to
lose in the first round and then play like he did was
a n»al class performance."
