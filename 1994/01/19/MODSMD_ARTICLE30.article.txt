# Men's tennis takes two titles in Pac-10 Indoors
## Cardinal seizes third, fourth flights; USC and UCLA shine 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Last weekend's Pacific 10 Conference Men's
Indoor Tennis Tournament in Seattle demonstrated
that while the Cardinal may be talented, it must
fight a battle with certain Southern neighbors to
claim conference honors.
"Contrary to their performances in Palm Springs
[at the National Collegiate Tennis Classic], I thought
USC and UCLA really stood out," said Stanford
head coach Dick Gould.
Playing in its second big tournament in as many
weekends, Stanford showed itself to be competitive,
if not dominant. The tournament, which was split
up into four separate flights with their own singles
and doubles draws, saw Stanford walk away with
champions in the third and fourth flights. Blessed
with depth, Stanford performed better in the lower
flights than at the top.
The first flight was a double disaster for the Car
dinal men — both defeats aiming at the hands of
Washington Huskies. Seniors Bobby Devens and
Michael Flanagan, the flight's second seed, fell in the
first round. Devens was summarily dismissed by the
Washington's Mark Tomandl, 6-2, 6-3, while Flana
gan lost to Washington's Ornello Arlati, 6-4, 7-5.
"Washington was rolling," Gould said. "It was
indoors, they had just come off a big win, and it was
in front of a home crowd. We just got blown out of
the water."
As first-round losers, both Devens and Flanagan
entered the consolation bracket. Devens, suffering
from minor injuries, defaulted in his first-round con
solation match. Flanagan, however, won three
straight matches to win the consolation draw, beat
ing UCIJVs Sebastien 1/cßlanc in the finals, 6-2,6-4.
"I tought Michael did a great job in the back
draw," Gould said. "For the defending champion to
lose in the first round and then play like he did was
a n»al class performance."

second flight featured Stanford
sophomore Jeff Salzenstein and
senior Chris Cocotos. Salzenstein
made it to the flight's semifinals
before bowing out to USC's Adam
Peterson in a grueling three-setter,
6-3, 5-7, 7-6(8). Cocotos, who took
Thomas' spot in the flight, won his

first-round match against the Uni
versity of California's Steve Lappin,
but lost to Eric Taino of UCLA, 6-2,
4-6, 6-2.
"Jeff had a very good tourna
ment," Gould said. "I was very
pleased with his wins, and the way
that he battled against Peterson.
He was out of that game but fought
and actually put himself in a posi
tion to win it."
Flight three was dominated by
Stanford's Vimal Patel. The senior

went to three sets against his oppo
nents only once, and beat the tal
ented Lukas Hovorka of USC in the
finals, 6-4, 6-3. Stanford's other
player in the draw, sophomore
Ricky Becker, won two matches
before losing to Hovorka in the
semifinals, 6-3, 6-4.
"Vimal really competed well,"
Gould said. "He was sharp, he
played his points well, he thought
well and he was effective against
many different playing styles."

The fourth flight was won by
Stanford's Billy Wright, who
wasn't even supposed to go to Seat
tle. Has Thomas been healthy and
able to play in the second flight, all
the players in the other flights
would have been shifted down one,
leaving Wright at Stanford. But
given the opportunity, the senior
made the most of it.

"Billy Wright just had a great
tournament," Gould said. "It was
his first time playing competitive

tennis since the summer. He really
did a good job."
Wright beat UCLA's Eric Lin 6-
4, 6-1 in what turned out to be a
very tough flight. Stanford's other
player in the bracket, freshman
Grant Elliot, won his first-round
match, but lost to big-serving Matt
Foote from the University of Ari
zona in the second, 6-3, 6-7 (11), 6-
4.
Stanford's fared no better in the
doubles. In the first flight, Flana

gan-Cocotos won their first match
by default, and lost in the semis to a
UCLA team that went on to win the
flight. The second flight saw a
Devens-Salzenstein tandem go all
the way to the finals, only to lose to
another team. Patel and
Klliot teamed up for Stanford's
third-flight doubles team, and lost
in the first round to a tough Ari
zona State duo. Becker and Wright
lost in the semis of the fourth-flight
doubles.

before bowing out to USC's Adam
Peterson in a grueling three-setter,
6-3, 5-7, 7-6(8). Cocotos, who took
Thomas' spot in the flight, won his

first-round match against the Uni
versity of California's Steve Lappin,
but lost to Eric Taino of UCLA, 6-2,
4-6, 6-2.
"Jeff had a very good tourna
ment," Gould said. "I was very
pleased with his wins, and the way
that he battled against Peterson.
He was out of that game but fought
and actually put himself in a posi
tion to win it."
Flight three was dominated by
Stanford's Vimal Patel. The senior

went to three sets against his oppo
nents only once, and beat the tal
ented Lukas Hovorka of USC in the
finals, 6-4, 6-3. Stanford's other
player in the draw, sophomore
Ricky Becker, won two matches
before losing to Hovorka in the
semifinals, 6-3, 6-4.
"Vimal really competed well,"
Gould said. "He was sharp, he
played his points well, he thought
well and he was effective against
many different playing styles."

The fourth flight was won by
Stanford's Billy Wright, who
wasn't even supposed to go to Seat
tle. Has Thomas been healthy and
able to play in the second flight, all
the players in the other flights
would have been shifted down one,
leaving Wright at Stanford. But
given the opportunity, the senior
made the most of it.

"Billy Wright just had a great
tournament," Gould said. "It was
his first time playing competitive

tennis since the summer. He really
did a good job."
Wright beat UCLA's Eric Lin 6-
4, 6-1 in what turned out to be a
very tough flight. Stanford's other
player in the bracket, freshman
Grant Elliot, won his first-round
match, but lost to big-serving Matt
Foote from the University of Ari
zona in the second, 6-3, 6-7 (11), 6-
4.
Stanford's fared no better in the
doubles. In the first flight, Flana

gan-Cocotos won their first match
by default, and lost in the semis to a
UCLA team that went on to win the
flight. The second flight saw a
Devens-Salzenstein tandem go all
the way to the finals, only to lose to
another team. Patel and
Klliot teamed up for Stanford's
third-flight doubles team, and lost
in the first round to a tough Ari
zona State duo. Becker and Wright
lost in the semis of the fourth-flight
doubles.
