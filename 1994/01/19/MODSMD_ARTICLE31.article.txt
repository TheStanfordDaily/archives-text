# Tennis to 'touch up' in Pac-10s
## 
### Rob Ross Editorial staff 
The Stanford women's tennis team pulls into Seat
tle this weekend for a last-minute pit stop at the Pacif
ic 10 Indoor Championships before the dual-match
season begins in earnest.
"This is the final touch-up as we try to figure out
our lineup," said Cardinal head coach Frank Brennan.
"Then, it's off to the races as we start our dual match
es."
Brennan, who coaches the second-ranked squad in
the countiy, will take seven players north — Kristine
Kurth, Katie Schlukebir, Beth Berris, Emma Wood
house, Sandra De Silva, Emily Burt and Wendy Sacks.
The Pac-10 Indoor Championships has three sepa
rate singles divisions and three doubles divisions. Each
team (only nine will be competing, as Oregon State does
not have a squad) fields two players in each division,
with the top two in the top division, the next two in the
middle division, and so on. For Stanford, senior Kurth
and freshman Schlukebir will compete in the top divi
sion, with Berris, a sophomore, and freshman Wood
house competing in the middle division, and freshman
De Silva and sophomore Sacks in third division. The
doubles lineups are not yet set, but Burt will find her
way into one of the three duos, replacing De Silva.
"Emily Burt is that player who does not make the

top six in singles but is an extraordinary doubles play
er," Brennan said.
Perhaps as significant are the players who will not
be making the trip due north. Stanford will be missing
the services of the top-ranked player in collegiate
women's tennis, Laxmi Poruri, who will be attending
a pro tournament.
"That's pretty typical," Brennan said of his star
player. "Much like Lisa Raymond did last year . ..
Laxmi has been playing pro tournaments [all fall I,
testing the waters. Frankly there are not a whole lot of
college players who can push her."
Kim Shasby, who played No. 3 singles for Stanford
last year behind Poruri and graduated-senior Heather
Willens, will skip the trip as well due to a stress frac
ture in her foot. More seriously, junior Amy Chiminel
lo will miss the trip and the rest of the season because
of recent toe surgery.
To Brennan, this weekend's competition presents
an opportunity for a relaxed scouting of division oppo
nents.
"These tournaments are all sort of tests. You get
some competition, see how your players are playing at
this point in the season ... as much as anything else it
gives you a chance to check out the competition.
"As far as I'm concerned it's a no-lose situation. So
we win, big deal, or we lose, big deal. Frankly, our sights
are set on the NCAA team championship (in May)."
