# Admissions office explores computerized applications
## 
### Charles Katz Staff writer 
In their effort to take over the world,
computers are poking their heads into yet
another corner of everyday life — the Stan
ford admissions application.
Following the examples of other univer
sities, Stanford will likely have some type of
computerized application process within
the next two years, according to Vivian
Barry, assistant dean for undergraduate
admissions.
This year, Stanford did allow a form of
computerized application. A company
called Mac Apply scanned in the Stanford
application and sold copies of the disks to

prospective applicants for approximately
$25, Barry said
Students could then type up their appli
cation on a computer, hut they would have
to print it out before they mailed it in. Barry
said that relatively few of the 14,500 appli
cations this year were computer-generated.
In addition, Barry said she foresees "rad
ical changes in the admissions procedure"
within five years. Such changes could in
clude applications over modems, high
school records being directly linked to uni
versities, and application information
being uploaded directly into the main data
base, foregoing any data entry.

At the grand opening of their used-CD business yesterday, seniors
Ryan Floyd, Ty Olson and Seth Spalding stand by as customers flip
through the milk crates looking for their favorite titles.
Already, Barry pointed out,
there is a program for the regis
trar to transmit transcripts over
the computer.
Other types of more integrated
software do exist for college appli
cations. At USC, where computer
ized applications are in their sec
ond year, admissions officers are
singing praises for their electron
ic co-worker.
"We really like our computer
system, but it's still at its begin
ning stages," said Pat Lußo,
admissions liaison at USC.
The USC application, in addi
tion to being available in the stan
dard paper version, is available on
disks for DOS, Windows and Mac
intosh. The application is
designed by XAP, a Los Angeles

based software company.
Prospective students then mail
back the disks with their applica
tion typed in. At USC, the disks
are fed into the main computer
where such information is pro
cessed, eliminating the need for
data entry.
In its first year, only 300 appli
cations out of 16,000 at USC were
computerized, said Lußo. But
this year, 1,800 computerized
applications have come in out of
8,400 received so far.
Since the computerized appli
cations can be loaded directly into
the main database at USC, a lot of
work will be saved, said Lußo.
"Since this is the first year,
though, we'll see how much time
is actually saved."
Because the application takes
less effort to process, USC's appli
cation fee is only $35 for comput
erized applicants, while it is nor
mally $50.

Officials at XAP, which han
dles USC's application as well as
applications at about 70 other
universities, stressed the time
saving advantages to such an
application. "Students will save
time doing their applications
and the admissions department
will save time as well," said
Maurice Salter, vice-president of
XAP.
The company plans to have
many other capabilities for its ser
vice in the future. Salter said
applications soon will be able to be
sent, completed and returned
over a modem.
Stanford's admissions office
relishes the idea of sending
applications over computer
lines. Barry said such measures
would save a lot of money on
postage.
But, for now, Stanford is tak
ing a wait-and-see approach.
Barry said the admissions office is

waiting to "decide which |system |
is going to be the best way."
While XAP, which started up
in 1989, is one of the pioneers of
computerized applications, the
idea of a computer-aided applica
tion is not a new one. Barry said
the Wang Corporation came to
Stanford about seven years ago
and offered to build a system
that would scan information into
the computer. Such a system,
Barry said, would have cost in
the hundreds of thousands of
dollars.
One of the reasons why Stan
ford wants to wait is that, with
time, the programs should
improve and become more reason
able in cost, Barry said.
The XAP Company currently
charges $3,500 to make the appli
cation for a university, and it then
charges $5 for each disk with the
application materials in it, Salter
said.
