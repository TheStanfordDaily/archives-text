# Admissions office explores computerized applications
## 
### Charles Katz Staff writer 
In their effort to take over the world,
computers are poking their heads into yet
another corner of everyday life — the Stan
ford admissions application.
Following the examples of other univer
sities, Stanford will likely have some type of
computerized application process within
the next two years, according to Vivian
Barry, assistant dean for undergraduate
admissions.
This year, Stanford did allow a form of
computerized application. A company
called Mac Apply scanned in the Stanford
application and sold copies of the disks to

prospective applicants for approximately
$25, Barry said
Students could then type up their appli
cation on a computer, hut they would have
to print it out before they mailed it in. Barry
said that relatively few of the 14,500 appli
cations this year were computer-generated.
In addition, Barry said she foresees "rad
ical changes in the admissions procedure"
within five years. Such changes could in
clude applications over modems, high
school records being directly linked to uni
versities, and application information
being uploaded directly into the main data
base, foregoing any data entry.

Ryan Floyd, Ty Olson and Seth Spalding stand by as customers flip
through the milk crates looking for their favorite titles.
