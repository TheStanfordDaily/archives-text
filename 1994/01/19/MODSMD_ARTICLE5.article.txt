Financial security is a greater concern
for this year's freshmen compared to previ
ous classes, according to the results of a re
cent nationwide survey.
Fifty-nine percent of the freshmen sur
veyed said it would be essential or very im
portant to be "very well off financially,"
compared to 53 percent of the class of 1996,
and 27 percent said it was essential or very
important to "never be obligated to peo
ple."
In deciding to attend college, 72 percent
of the Class of '97 said that "getting a better
job" was very important, while 55 percent
said that "making more money" was very

important. Those results were up 6 percent
and 5 percent, respectively, from last year.

The survey, which was conducted last
fall by the Higher Education Research In
stitute at UCLA and the American Council
on Education, was returned by 1,460 of
1,616 entering Stanford freshmen. It in
cluded more than 200,000 entering fresh
men at 602 two-year and four-year colleges.
The margin of error for the results was plus
or minus 1.5 percent.
The growing concern about financial se
curity among Stanford freshmen did not
surprise people in contact with the Class of
'97.
