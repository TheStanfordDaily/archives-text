# Survey says: Fast-track frosh
## 
### Urmimala Sarkar Staff writer 
Financial security is a greater concern
for this year's freshmen compared to previ
ous classes, according to the results of a re
cent nationwide survey.
Fifty-nine percent of the freshmen sur
veyed said it would be essential or very im
portant to be "very well off financially,"
compared to 53 percent of the class of 1996,
and 27 percent said it was essential or very
important to "never be obligated to peo
ple."
In deciding to attend college, 72 percent
of the Class of '97 said that "getting a better
job" was very important, while 55 percent
said that "making more money" was very

important. Those results were up 6 percent
and 5 percent, respectively, from last year.

The survey, which was conducted last
fall by the Higher Education Research In
stitute at UCLA and the American Council
on Education, was returned by 1,460 of
1,616 entering Stanford freshmen. It in
cluded more than 200,000 entering fresh
men at 602 two-year and four-year colleges.
The margin of error for the results was plus
or minus 1.5 percent.
The growing concern about financial se
curity among Stanford freshmen did not
surprise people in contact with the Class of
'97.
Branner Resident Fellow Kennell Jack-
son said that this focus on finan
cial security "has been around for
some time. It's growing a little bit,
but it's not any sort of dramatic
shift."
The survey suggests that the
Class of '97 also seems more
career-oriented than previous
classes. Twenty-three percent said
they hope to pursue medicine, an
increase of 4 percent from last
year, while 8 percent said they
intend to study law and 13 percent
want to pursue engineering.
This focus on careers has affect
ed the classes that freshmen take,
according to Gadi Slade, a sopho
more academic adviser.
"For many frosh, there is a
huge disparity between their intel
lectual interests and the classes
they take," Slade said. "Instead of
exploring, many get onto the pre
med track."
Freshman Janki Bhuva agreed.
"Most frosh take classes for their
major, their career, or [distribu

tion requirements) — especially
pre-meds."
In addition, interest in politics
and the environment seems to
have declined among freshmen.
Only 45 percent of those surveyed
said they had discussed politics in
the last year, a decrease of 8 per
cent from last year, and 19 percent
said they had participated in
demonstrations, which was down
from 25 percent last year.
Slade attributed this decline in
activism to academic pressures
rather than lack of interest. Jack
son noted the timing, calling the
post-election year an "off-season
for politics." Bhuva added that
"there was just more going on last
year in politics than there is now."
The survey also addressed the
demographics of the freshman
class, which is 57 percent white,
compared to 76 percent at other
selective private colleges.
The number of students
with household incomes above
$150,000 remained at 23 percent.
Eighty percent of the freshman
class comes from two-parent
homes, and 71.5 percent of stu
dents attended public schools.
