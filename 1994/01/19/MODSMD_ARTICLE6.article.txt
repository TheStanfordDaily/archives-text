# Draft of conflict policy completed
## Private gifts, outside work at risk 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
After several months of revi
sions and delays, the University's
Committee on Research has com
pleted a new, comprehensive poli
cy on faculty conflict of interest
and commitment that is likely to
be the subject of considerable con
tention when it reaches the Facul
ty Senate for approval March 3.
Biology Prof. Craig Heller,
chair of the committee, said that
an open forum on the policy "will
be announced soon." The policy
will most likely be published in
Campus Report next week, he
said.
The policy is expected to im
pose increased regulations on the
freedom of faculty members to ac
cept gifts from the private sector
for research and to do work with
other academic institutions.
Although Heller was reluctant
to discuss details of the plan with
The Daily until it is more widely
circulated, he did say the new pol
icy will reform the compliance re

porting process by requiring all
departments to disclose annually
whether their faculty abided by
the new regulations. "Everyone
has to be in compliance with the
policy," he said.
The senate endorsed the draft
proposal of the policy last May,
but requested that the committee
make several revisions to it. The
final draft was originally targeted
for debate in the senate in Octo
ber, but has since been pushed
back because, Heller concedes, "it
wasn't finished."
"It wasn't easy to put together
a policy like this from scratch,"
Heller said. "You have to consider
every possible interpretation of
the policy. From the beginning
every aspect had to be thoroughly
discussed, until everyone was
happy."
Heller said the committee regu
larly consulted several faculty
members not on the panel and ex
amined "a lot of sample cases to
see how this policy would apply."
Although the committee also
considered existing policies at
other institutions, Stanford's doc
ument is not modeled on any par
ticular one, Heller said.
Because it treads on highly sen
sitive waters — namely, faculty
income — the policy is expected to
confront relentless scrutiny when

it comes before the senate in
March. As such, the debate on the
policy will be stretched over two
sessions before a vote is taken.
"No one likes more rules and
regulations," Heller said. "People
have to realize it's a different world
out there and that we're held to
high levels of accountability.
"It's important that we act
above expectation in terms of our
behavior, that we monitor our
behavior," he added. "We are an
institution of public trust."
