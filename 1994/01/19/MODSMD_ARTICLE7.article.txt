# Sand Hill planners inform community

In the first in a series of meet
ings, Stanford developers met
with Palo Alto citizens last night
to discuss the planned extension
of Sand Hill Road and related pro
jects.
The forums are part of the Uni
versity's attempts to solicit com
munity input into the proposed
projects before creating specific
plans, said Andy Coe, director of
community relations at Stanford.
"Stanford has submitted appli
cations for these projects to the
cities of Palo Alto and Menlo
Park," he told the audience of
about 100 at the Palo Alto Senior
Center, adding that he hopes com
munity input will improve the
proposals — which will not be sub
mitted in full until after extensive

community workshops.
The projects currently involve
extending Sand Hill Road to El
Camino Real, said Curtis Feeny,
an official from the Stanford Real
Estate Management Company.
In addition, the University
plans to build more than 1,000
residential units in the area
known as Stanford West — the
area between the San Francisqui
to Creek and Sand Hill Road,
Feeny said. It would also expand
the Stanford Shopping Center by
10 percent.
"We're trying to get people
closer to where they work," he
said. "We also plan to offer 15 per
cent of the units at below market
rate."
But though the planned con
struction would take place on
Stanford land, citizens of both
Palo Alto and Menlo Park
expressed discontent about its
effects on the two cities — such
as increased traffic and inade
quate benefits from the shopping
center's expansion.
Coe attempted to respond to
the complaints voiced most often,
explaining that the project's
design will address issues such as
the linkage with the two cities,
traffic flow and local needs.
"It's a real prospect for honest
cooperation," said David New

man, the University's chief archi
tect and director of planning.
"Frequently in planning, the
vision gets lost. . . . We feel that
this project can benefit all those
concerned."
Newman described some of
the plan's details to the audi
ence, outlining three specific
ways to direct traffic circulation
around the shopping center that
would involve directing roads
through the new housing devel
opment.
"We feel the central location of
the developments will enhance
the surrounding area," he said,
explaining that his goals include
increasing community access to
the shopping center.
