# Exchanging their tunes
## Students initiate CD-swap project 
### Bv Justin Dawe 
After volunteering with the Ravenswood-Stan
ford Tutoring Program, senior Seth Spalding decid
ed he wanted to find a way to help purchase CD
ROM and other multimedia equipment for the East
Palo Alto school.
But rather than trying to raise funds by organiz
ing a charity event, Spalding and three of his friends
decided to start their own business and earmark a
portion of the profits for the school.
And so began the "CD Xchange."
The group of seniors set out to identify and capi
talize on an untapped market on the Stanford cam
pus, keeping in mind that being their own bosses
would allow them to control the use of their profits.
Recognizing that "everyone's tastes in music
change" after arriving on campus as a freshman,
Spalding and his friends decided that it would be
both fitting and viable to raise and earn money by
selling and trading used CDs.
Hitting house meetings and other dormitory
gatherings, the four went directly to the consumers
to both publicize their work and "buy CDs while the
students had them right in front of them," said fel
low entrepreneur Peter Fenton. Trusting that
whatever they carry "will appeal to someone, be
cause someone had to buy it to begin with," CD
Xchange carries approximately 1,000 used CDs
ranging in style from Mozart to Motley Crtie and be
yond.
The group features CDs ranging in price from $6
to $9 and a swap center which will be open Tuesday
and Wednesday afternoons in front of the Book
store.
Within the next two to three weeks there will also
be an inventory listing avail
able to students on electronic
mail. The group believes their
prices and their accessibility
will give them an advantage
over other CD traders in the
community.
For now, their profits will be
directed toward building a larger
and more diverse selection. Their
target is 2,000 titles within the
next few months. Once they have
reached that target, they will
begin making donations to
Ravens wood.

Given that they pay up to $5
per purchase, and sometimes
more on exchanges, the stu
dents hope that there will be an
outpouring of recycled music
from the shelves of student lis
teners.
Saying that they've found
that students naturally gravitate
toward alternative music as they
get older, that particular catego
ry makes up by far the largest
segment of CD Xchange's cur
rent holdings.
The entrepreneurs are cur
rently offering a grand opening
special of $1 off any selection,
and have instituted a permanent
"buy five, get one free" policy.
