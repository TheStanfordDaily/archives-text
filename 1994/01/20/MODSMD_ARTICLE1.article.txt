# Engineer: University stalling on safety suit
## 
### Holly Lloyd 
A safety engineer who sued the
University last April for an al
legedly unfair pay cut filed a mo
tion last week demanding access
to internal documents and claim
ing the University is dragging its
feet during the lawsuit's prelimi
nary phase.
Gary Schell, who still works in
the University's Environmental
Health and Safety department, al
leges that he was unfairly pun
ished for drawing attention to
campus safety violations. In his
lawsuit, he claims he suffered a 20
percent salary cut, denial of ad
vancement opportunities and
other forms of harassment as a re
sult of his efforts to ensure Stan
ford's compliance with local and
state safety regulations.
His recent motion requests
that the University release poten
tially sensitive internal memos
that may detail the University's
policy toward maintaining health
and safety standards.
A Feb. 18 hearing in Santa
Clara County Superior Court will
determine whether the University
is obligated to provide the docu
ments requested by Schell and his
attorney. Schell also requests the
University be fined $5,000 to cover
the expense of filing the motion.
Senior University Counsel
Michael Vartain declined to com
ment on the specific charges out
lined in the plaintiffs current mo
tion.
"It's unfortunate that a Uni
versity employee is suing over a
salary dispute," Vartain said. "We
want to conduct the case in an or
derly and professional manner."
The University will file their
opposition to the motion some
time before the hearing. "We will
be responding directly and vigor
ously then," Vartain said.
Schell's attorney, John Shaf
fer, said he believes Stanford is re
fusing to provide certain docu
ments because they might be too
self-critical and may harm the
University's reputation.
"This is one of the most obvi
ous cases of obstruction I've
seen," Shaffer said. "I think this
is a typical institutional reaction
and reflective of the University's
desire to cover over the signifi
cance of the issues and policies
raised by this case.
"In my mind," he added, "I am
convinced this is part of an inten
tional course of conduct designed
to mislead regulators and the
public."
The controversy that initiated
Schell's lawsuit began in Septem
ber 1990, when Schell recom
mended that shower and eyewash
systems for the new Gilbert Bio
logical Sciences Building be
redesigned. The original plan
allegedly violated state regula
tions.
In his lawsuit, Schell claims
that 10 days after a retrofit was
approved in November 1991, his
income was cut by 20 percent,

after supplemental pay he had
been receiving since June 1989
for leading his department's
emergency response team was
eliminated.
In December 1993, Schell
received a 15 percent pay raise.
Vartain said the raise is unrelated
to the current lawsuit.
In addition to compensation
for his lost salary, Schell is asking
for punitive damages of $10,000
for each day since his salary was
taken away. He is also requesting
that the University set up an
institute to study the health and
safety issues raised by this case.
"We want them to take a look
at the social, environmental and
legal issues and the penalties that
apply to this area. Many universi
ties are facing the same prob
lems," Shaffer said.
Included in Schell's pending
motion is a copy of an October
1991 memo by a department
employee that states the Univer
sity maintained "levels of non
compliance that are managed pri
marily by maintaining excellent
professional working relation
ships with the regulators and the
client base."

The memo further states that
an environmental strategy estab
lished in 1988 was one of "mini
mal acceptable compliance rely
ing on decentralized responsibili
ties."
According to Shaffer, this
strategy directly contradicts the
University's official policy estab
lished by a 1988 health and safety
review. Two environmental eval
uations called for centralization
of departmental decision making
to assure better compliance with
safety standards.
The health and safety policy
review was precipitated in part by
a lawsuit filed by another Stan
ford safety engineer. In 1988, Jon
Moldestad — former Environ
mental Health and Safety opera
tions manager — charged the
University with extensive safety
violations including cover-up, fal
sification, intimidation, waste
and mismanagement of health
and safety issues. The University
settled the lawsuit for $200,000,
the full amount requested in the
suit.

Vartain said the University has
worked to improve health and
safety procedures in recent years.

motion is a copy of an October
1991 memo by a department
employee that states the Univer
sity maintained "levels of non
compliance that are managed pri
marily by maintaining excellent
professional working relation
ships with the regulators and the
client base."

The memo further states that
an environmental strategy estab
lished in 1988 was one of "mini
mal acceptable compliance rely
ing on decentralized responsibili
ties."
According to Shaffer, this
strategy directly contradicts the
University's official policy estab
lished by a 1988 health and safety
review. Two environmental eval
uations called for centralization
of departmental decision making
to assure better compliance with
safety standards.
The health and safety policy
review was precipitated in part by
a lawsuit filed by another Stan
ford safety engineer. In 1988, Jon
Moldestad — former Environ
mental Health and Safety opera
tions manager — charged the
University with extensive safety
violations including cover-up, fal
sification, intimidation, waste
and mismanagement of health
and safety issues. The University
settled the lawsuit for $200,000,
the full amount requested in the
suit.

Vartain said the University has
worked to improve health and
safety procedures in recent years.
