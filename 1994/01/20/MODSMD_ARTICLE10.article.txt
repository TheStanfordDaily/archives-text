# President tours L.A. damage
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Southern
California's tectonic plates did not defer
to Bill Clinton: They greeted the presi
dent's visit with three sharp aftershocks
yesterday.
The president made a quick tour of
some of the most significant damage
caused by Monday's powerful quake,
including a collapsed freeway and a bro
ken water main. He released $45 million
for immediate highway repairs and
Small Business Administration money
that could make available $239 million
in low-interest loans.
Gov. Pete Wilson says total damages
from the Northridge earthquake could
range from $15 billion to $30 billion, and
the record cost is more than the state can
bear.
In a letter sent Tuesday to President
Clinton, Wilson asked for extra federal
help to rebuild roadways, schools and

other public buildings.
"Following the civil unrest of 1992,
the winter storms of 1993 and the most
recent firestorms of a few months ago, it
is clear that neither this area nor the
state can be asked to bear the burden of
recovery alone," Wilson wrote.
Clinton said he would ask Congress
for an emergency supplemental appro
priation to bolster federal disaster funds
sure to be depleted by the quake.
Viewing the failed section of the Simi
Valley Freeway, Clinton said that while
television had shown graphic pictures of
the damage, "there's a difference in see
ing this . . . actually standing here look
ing at it."
"It's amazing", he said, shaking his
head.
Along the route of his motorcade,
Clinton was able to see scores of resi
dents camped in the streets.

"This is a national problem," Clinton
said after the tour. "We have a national
responsibility and we will be in it for the
long run .... This is something we
intend to stay with until the job is over."
As part of his area survey, the presi
dent chatted with bridge engineers and
structural experts, who were on the site
of the fallen Simi Valley Freeway. They
told him neighborhood residents have
given them food and drinks.
Officials of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency say there is about
$1.1 billion remaining in its disaster
fund after the Midwest floods and the
Los Angeles wildfires last fall.
The strongest of the aftershocks dur
ing the president's visit was a magni
tude-5.1 seismic jolt at 1:15 p.m. that
swayed lights at a Burbank Airport
hangar where Clinton spoke 15 minutes
later.
