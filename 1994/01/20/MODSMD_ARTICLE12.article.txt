Hopefully, mondavs
6.6 earthquake which rat
tled Southern California
will also shake up Stanford's lack
adaisical attitude toward earth
quake preparation.
The enormous attention and
concern once paid to earthquake
readiness at the Farm, particularly
after the 1989 Loma Prieta quake,
has fallen to dangerously low lev
els.
While this year's resident assis
tant orientation included a work
shop on disaster preparedness,
individual dorm programming on
what to do if an earthquake should
ravage the Stanford campus has
been inexcusably remiss.
As this week's disaster indi
cates, earthquakes are by far the
most serious natural hazard facing
California. Moreover, scientists
have predicted that the next major
quake to strike the Stanford area
will be seven to nine times more
powerful than the 7.1 Loma Prieta

temblor.

In response to the earthquake,
the Office of Residential Education
issued a reminder to resident fel
lows to re-examine their dorm pro
gramming involving earthquakes.
Unfortunately, in the past these
community members have not had
many opportunities to learn about
preparedness, and when classes or
meetings have been held, atten
dance has been sparse. For exam
ple, this year's freshman Orienta
tion did not include any earth
quake seminars or information
sessions; and last year, when the
University organized preparedness
meetings for staff and students,
attendance was less than over
whelming. These meetings should
be mandatory, not optional, for
students and staff alike.
One of any university's fore
most prerogatives is ensuring the
safety of its students. Stanford
should not jeopardize that through
apathy and carelessness.
