# In the quake's wake
## 
### 
Collapsed freeways. Crushed
buildings. Destroyed water
mains. These are the sights
and sounds of Los Angeles following
Monday's earthquake.
Hopefully, though, this worst of
times for Angelinos will also witness
the best of the Stanford community.
The University and its students
should do all it can to help out the
areas affected by the quake, areas
which are now facing damages run
ning into the tens of billions of dol
lars.
One such way to lend a hand
could involve creating a new Alter
native Spring Break project which
would assist Southern Californians
in the repairs and rehabilitation
that will be necessary to return
their neighborhoods to normal.
Similar college programs were
instrumental in repairing the dam
ages left in the wake of Hurricane

Andrew, which leveled large areas of
South Florida in 1992. And
although the California earthquake
destroyed many elements of the
area's infrastructure — such as
bridges and roads — that must be
repaired by trained professionals,
there will likely be many other nec
essary tasks for students to com
plete in the upcoming weeks. These
jobs may range from clean-up activ
ities to food distribution, but all will
be essential.
In addition, in the wake of the
disaster, Stanford should also make
sure to fulfill all of the most basic
tasks of good-neighborliness, from
technical assistance to canned food
drives, if needed or solicited.
After all, it was only five years
ago that Stanford saw just how pow
erful an effect an earthquake can
have, and how much a helping hand
is needed — and appreciated.
