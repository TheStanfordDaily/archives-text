MY COLUMNS have focused on
problems at Stanford, particularly
issues from a graduate student
perspective. I am not, however, perpetual
ly angry. There are many wonderful
things about Stanford: as a locale, an insti
tution and a community. I believe that one
should allow "the little things" to make
your day. To that end, I collected a list of
some of the good things about Stanford.
I was helped in this compilation by an
unscientific, unrandom sample of fellow
School of Education graduate students. I
must note that doctoral students found
this task much more difficult than mas
ter's level students. It seems that the pro
cess of being at Stanford for several years
has a souring effect on some people. It is
often easier to remember the bad things:
long lines, surly people, irrational policies,
uncooperative computers. I believe that
we need to be a little more open to the
good things.
Some of my favorite things at Stanford
are:
• Wonderful rooftops, especially the
CERAS building and Jordan Hall.
• The fruits which grow on campus.
Strawberries, olives, persimmons and
loquats all await the intrepid forager.
• The Stanford Directory, which pub
lishes faculty e-mail and home phone
numbers. This makes faculty seem very
accessible.
• Chocolate chocolate chip muffins.
• "The huggin' thing" at the Ed school.
At graduation, every doctoral student in

the School of Education is both hooded
and hugged by their adviser. I hear that
engineers merely shake hands.
• Walking to the Dish and discussing
University politics.
• Dean, the perpetually cheerful and
friendly Bookstore employee, in the sec
ond floor photo department.
• Reading in the sun. This study tech
nique is unevolved at Eastern institutions.
• Incomparable peers. So many other
students have accomplished extraordinary
things in the world before coming to Stan
ford. It is an honor and a pleasure to learn
with and from them.
• Harvesting tomatoes in November.
• The people who help the salamanders
across the road in the rain.
• Barbara's Panino Mio sandwiches at
Tresidder with a side of Caesar salad.
• The weather.
• The field of paper-white narcissus flo
wers behind Meyer library in full bloom.
• Eating Thai food from Jordan Hall in
the main Quad watching the Stanford
Court Jugglers.
• The library stafT at Cubberly and Gr
een, who are invariably knowledgeable,
persistent, helpful and friendly.
• Sitting by the fountains and listening
to them run.
' • The faculty on University committees
who are attentive to and respectful of stu
dent opinions. Eor graduate students this
kind of role-modeling makes academia
seem like an attractive alternative.
• A stress-reducing walk around the Main
Quad and through Mem Chu.

• "The Guide to the Good Life."
• Being able to enter and roam in virtu
ally any building. Riding an elevator in
Hoover with George Schultz is a tribute to
Stanford's democratic spirit.
• The chaotic entrance of undergradu
ates during the stadium graduation.
• The fans at Stanford women's basket
ball games.
• Outstanding teachers. Small classes.
Helpful comments on papers. The time,
attention and caring of outstanding facul
ty members.
Graduate students are taught to be
critical, which too easily evolves into
curmudgeonliness, cynicism and cranki
ness. A penultimate Daily column is the
appropriate place to be upbeat and
thankful. I want to thank the people
who have read my columns, and those
who have responded, both positively and
negatively. I am grateful to all of the
people who took the time to help me
understand the intricacies of University
policies and the way that policies affect
their lives. One of the most wonderful
things about Stanford is that it is easy
for one student to be heard. I encourage
you to try.

This was to be Chris' final column. Due to
technical difficulties, it is running this
week instead. Her usual diatribe will
appear next week.
