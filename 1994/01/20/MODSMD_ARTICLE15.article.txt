## Students should choose their fee refunds carefully 
### 
During the past months, we have
all heard many different views on
ASSU Special Fees and the Fee
Refund process. Many graduate stu
dents, disgruntled with their lack of rep
resentation in the ASSU, waged the Fee
Refund "Tea Party," blindly refunding
their fees from all of the student groups.
During this time, a letter to the editor
from one of these students read some
thing like, "refunding your money
doesn't hurt anybody." Unfortunately,
nothing but the contrary is true.
The shortfall in funding not only hurt
the student groups themselves, but also
many students were denied services
because they refunded their fees. Many
student groups were forced to cut their

already-strapped budgets by up to 15
percent, affecting not only their opera
tions, but also their ability to serve stu
dents. SURE Escort, a service used and
valued by many students, cannot sustain
service for long with-out receiving its
budgeted fee income. The ASSU Legal
Counseling Office, another free and very
valuable service to students, was faced
with severe budget cuts and has been
forced to limit service to only those stu
dents who chose to fund it. For fall quar
ter alone, the Legal Counseling Office
denied service to 104 students who chose
not to fund the service. In short, none of
the ASSU Special Fee groups can contin
ue to provide their services without
funding.

One key idea that has been forgotten
over the past quarter is that your refund
from a student group is a commitment
to not partake in the services provided
by that group. Refunding your student
fee is a privilege that must not be
abused. If you legitimately and thought
fully do not want to fund a particular
student group, then go ahead and take
your refund, but please keep in mind
that you then exclude yourself from its
services. If you take a refund and par
take in that group's services, you are in
effect taking money right out of the
pocket of a fellow student who chose to
fund the group.
Your refund request from last quarter
will automatically roll over into winter

quarter, so if you want to re-evaluate
and change which groups you fund, then
please do so by Jan. 31. You no longer
need an e-mail account to do so. In order
to change your funding status, telnet to
the host assu-serve 1234 from any Uni
versity networked computer and submit
your new funding request as if it were
your first request. Your new refund
record will replace the previous one.
In short, ASSU student groups pro
vide many valuable student services and
do much to improve campus life and
activity; please choose your refund care
fully so that these groups can continue
to operate and provide their services.
