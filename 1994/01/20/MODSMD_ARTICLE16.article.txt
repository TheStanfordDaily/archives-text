# Professor didn't know of Bookstore discount on early course readers
## 
### 
Absent-minded professors are of
course fair game, but when "approxi
mately 200 . . . didn't get on the ball"
(quoting The Daily's Jan. 14 editorial),

and thus deprived their students of
the 20 percent discount on the cost of
their course readers, it might have
occurred to you to do a bit of investi
gating.
Doubtless some of us are indifferent
to the cost of books and readers that
we require our students to purchase,
but 200 must have constituted a sub
stantial percentage or all of those
assigning readers at the Stanford

Bookstore this quarter, and that 200
were absent-minded or, worse yet,
indifferent to students' obvious inter
est in obtaining course readers at the
lowest possible cost, is on its face
unlikely.
In fact, I did not learn that there
was a possibility of a discount until I
turned in the material for my course
reader in December too late to take
advantage of it, and I suspect this was

true of most of my colleagues who sim
ilarly turned in their readers too late
to benefit from the "early bird dis
count." Obviously I will try to meet
such a deadline in the future, but
there was no way I could meet the Dec
4 deadline this past month, when I
was informed neither of the existence
of the discount nor of the deadline.
