## 'I've totally recovered. I have no limitations.' Back in the saddle After sitting out last season, Harbour and Poppink contribute to hoops success 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
Hear Cardinal men's hoops stars
David Harbour and Andy Poppink
talk, and you might lose all respect for
injuries.
"I'm not surprised at what either of
us is doing," said Harbour. "We've
both been expecting to play."
Harbour's expectations aside, the
return of both players from last year's
season-ending injuries has been eye
opening. Last season, physical prob
lems limited Harbour and Poppink to
a grand total of 15 points. Combined.
All season.
This season, the two have combined
to average over 20 points a game, play
ing key roles in the resurgence of the
Stanford men's basketball program.
There was talk that Harbour, a 6-
foot-3, 185-pound guard, would never
play again after he had part of his
right thumb ripped off in a water-ski
ing accident two summers ago. He
underwent major reconstructive
surgery, and didn't begin playing bas
ketball until the end of last season.
But a thumb that appears slightly
deformed is the only lingering sign of

the injury, according to Harbour. "I've
totally recovered," said the junior. "I
have no limitations."
Harbour, who is left-handed, said
the injury hasn't affected his shooting
style. "The only thing I've had to
adjust is my ball-handling."
Poppink's adjustment process has
been a more gradual one. After playing
in 28 games as a freshman, Poppink
played in only three games last year
before chronic back pains sidelined
him for the season.
It was unclear early in the season
just how much the 6-foot-7, 215-
pound forward would play this year.
"Before the start of this season, I
hadn't played more than two days in a
row since the beginning of last year,"
Poppink said.
But Poppink has definitely played
— the junior has started every game,
averaging over 30 minutes an outing.
And while his back continues to con
cern him, it hasn't affected his playing
time. "It doesn't always bother me,
but I'm conscious of it," said Poppink.
"But it's not like it was last year."
It's not like last year in many ways
for Harbour and Poppink — both have
adjusted to playing new positions as
well as combating their physical prob
lems. Harbour is the first guard off the
bench in a two-guard offense, playing
anywhere from the point position to
the No. 3 guard in the offense.
"I like playing the No. 3 position,"
said Harbour, "even though I have to
guard bigger players than myself a lot
of the time. I like physical contact."
Indeed, physical contact fits Har
bour's image well. "Harbour has
always been a tough kid," said Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery. "If
there's a loose ball, he goes to the floor.
He takes it to the edge sometimes."
Poppink, a small forward by nature,
has also had to adjust to the physically
demanding post position. "I'd never
played the post before in my life," he
said.
The transition has been difficult is
some ways — Poppink has battled
through some early season foul prob
lems. "Sometimes I'd be out there con
sciously trying not to foul," he said.
But more than anything else, Pop

pink's foul problems reflect the
respect he garners on defense. He con
sistently matches up with some of the
biggest names on the court down low
— tonight, he pairs up against Califor
nia All-American candidate Lamond
Murray.
Poppink, who has the shooting
range of a guard, is developing a
turnaround jump shot which he can
let loose over bigger post men. "I never
shot that shot before my first game
this year," Poppink said. "It doesn't
feel natural yet, but I'm getting used
to it."
And so is the Cardinal. Poppink is
quietly averaging 12.3 points a contest
and ranks ninth in the Pac-10 with his
7.2 rebounds-per-game average.
How much of Stanford's turnaround
can be credited to the two returnees?
The Cardinal is off to a respectable 9-4
start this season after finishing last
year with a not-so-respectable 7-23
mark.
"There's a different attitude (this
year), and credit the other guys, not
just Poppink and me," said Harbour.
"I just wished I could have played one
or two games (last year) and gotten in
some guys' faces."
Which shouldn't be a problem this
year . . . health permitting.

well as combating their physical prob
lems. Harbour is the first guard off the
bench in a two-guard offense, playing
anywhere from the point position to
the No. 3 guard in the offense.
"I like playing the No. 3 position,"
said Harbour, "even though I have to
guard bigger players than myself a lot
of the time. I like physical contact."
Indeed, physical contact fits Har
bour's image well. "Harbour has
always been a tough kid," said Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery. "If
there's a loose ball, he goes to the floor.
He takes it to the edge sometimes."
Poppink, a small forward by nature,
has also had to adjust to the physically
demanding post position. "I'd never
played the post before in my life," he
said.
The transition has been difficult is
some ways — Poppink has battled
through some early season foul prob
lems. "Sometimes I'd be out there con
sciously trying not to foul," he said.
But more than anything else, Pop

pink's foul problems reflect the
respect he garners on defense. He con
sistently matches up with some of the
biggest names on the court down low
— tonight, he pairs up against Califor
nia All-American candidate Lamond
Murray.
Poppink, who has the shooting
range of a guard, is developing a
turnaround jump shot which he can
let loose over bigger post men. "I never
shot that shot before my first game
this year," Poppink said. "It doesn't
feel natural yet, but I'm getting used
to it."
And so is the Cardinal. Poppink is
quietly averaging 12.3 points a contest
and ranks ninth in the Pac-10 with his
7.2 rebounds-per-game average.
How much of Stanford's turnaround
can be credited to the two returnees?
The Cardinal is off to a respectable 9-4
start this season after finishing last
year with a not-so-respectable 7-23
mark.
"There's a different attitude (this
year), and credit the other guys, not
just Poppink and me," said Harbour.
"I just wished I could have played one
or two games (last year) and gotten in
some guys' faces."
Which shouldn't be a problem this
year . . . health permitting.
