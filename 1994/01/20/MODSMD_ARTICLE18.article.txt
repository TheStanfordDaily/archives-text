# Basketball's Big Game
## Bears visit Cardinal 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
It's a Big Game in every sense of the
term.
The Stanford men's basketball team
hosts California tonight in a matchup that
should indicate just how competitive the
Cardinal will be through the rest of its
Pacific 10 Conference schedule.
No. 21 Cal (10-3 overall, 3-1 in the Pac
-10) features one of the premier forwards in
the country in 6-foot-7, 220-pound Lam
ond Murray. Murray, a junior, leads the
Pac-10 in scoring with a 25.3-point mark.
More amazingly, he leads the Bears in both
rebounding and three-pointers, a difficult
feat for a player at any position.
But while Murray may be Cal's scoring
machine, all eyes will be focused on the
point-guard position, where Stanford
superfrosh Brevin Knight squares off with
the Bears' Jason Kidd in a battle of media
spotlight-grabbers.
Kidd redefined the term superfrosh last
season, garnering attention for both a high
scoring average and low SAT scores. This
season, with his standardized-test night
mares behind him, Kidd is having a mon
ster season, leading the conference in both
steals and assists while chipping in over 15
points a game to the Cal attack.
"The key with Kidd will be to be con
scious of his ability to steal the ball and to
penetrate," said Cardinal guard David
Harbour. "We have to be aware of where
he is on the floor."
After sweeping home games against
Washington and Washington State to open
their Pac-10 slate, Stanford (9-4,2-2) dropped

a pair of road contests to Arizona State and
Arizona to even their conference record.
The Cardinal struggled early against
the relentless full-court pressure of the
Sun Devils, falling behind by as many as 22
points in the first half of the game. After
pulling within six late in the second half,
Stanford was unable to further close the
gap, dropping a 78-67 decision.
The story was similar at Arizona. 1 he
