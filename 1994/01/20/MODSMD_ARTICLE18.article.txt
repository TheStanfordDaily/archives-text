# Basketball's Big Game
## Bears visit Cardinal 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
It's a Big Game in every sense of the
term.
The Stanford men's basketball team
hosts California tonight in a matchup that
should indicate just how competitive the
Cardinal will be through the rest of its
Pacific 10 Conference schedule.
No. 21 Cal (10-3 overall, 3-1 in the Pac
-10) features one of the premier forwards in
the country in 6-foot-7, 220-pound Lam
ond Murray. Murray, a junior, leads the
Pac-10 in scoring with a 25.3-point mark.
More amazingly, he leads the Bears in both
rebounding and three-pointers, a difficult
feat for a player at any position.
But while Murray may be Cal's scoring
machine, all eyes will be focused on the
point-guard position, where Stanford
superfrosh Brevin Knight squares off with
the Bears' Jason Kidd in a battle of media
spotlight-grabbers.
Kidd redefined the term superfrosh last
season, garnering attention for both a high
scoring average and low SAT scores. This
season, with his standardized-test night
mares behind him, Kidd is having a mon
ster season, leading the conference in both
steals and assists while chipping in over 15
points a game to the Cal attack.
"The key with Kidd will be to be con
scious of his ability to steal the ball and to
penetrate," said Cardinal guard David
Harbour. "We have to be aware of where
he is on the floor."
After sweeping home games against
Washington and Washington State to open
their Pac-10 slate, Stanford (9-4,2-2) dropped

a pair of road contests to Arizona State and
Arizona to even their conference record.
The Cardinal struggled early against
the relentless full-court pressure of the
Sun Devils, falling behind by as many as 22
points in the first half of the game. After
pulling within six late in the second half,
Stanford was unable to further close the
gap, dropping a 78-67 decision.
The story was similar at Arizona. 1 he
Wildcats jumped out to a large
lead early in the contest, and a
late Stanford rally fell short of
the mark in an 89-72 defeat.
"We played terrible first
halves in both games," said for
ward Andy Poppink.
But the weekend was not
without its high points. Senior
forward Brent Williams carried
the Cardinal on his back in the
second half of the Arizona State
game, collecting 35 prints and 15

rebounds on the weekend.
In addition, Dion Cross looked
ready to emerge from his midsea
son shooting slump. Cross, Stan
ford's leading scorer, averaged
only eight points in his first
three Pac-10 games while shoot
ing 30 percent from the field.
Against Arizona, the sophomore
found his range in the second
half, tying his season high with
22 points, including a 3-for-4
performance from 3-point range.
The Cardinal will need a similar
game from Cross tonight to com
pete with the Golden Bears. Cal
also traveled to Arizona last week
end, coming within a 42-footer of

sweeping what is probably the con
ference's toughest road trip.
The Bears upset highly
favored Arizona 98-93 in over
time, dropping the Wildcats
home-court record to 100-3 over
the past seven seasons. Against
the Sun Devils, only a despera
tion buzzer-beater by Stevin
Smith gave Arizona State a 63-60
win.
A win tonight is essential for
Stanford â€” the schedule doesn't
get any easier next weekend,
when top-ranked UCLA visits
Maples.
"We're due for a good perfor
mance," said Harbour.
