						mystery of Bart
## 'Simpsons' director outlines show's evolution

Bart's head has nine points. And when
he smiles, you can see five teeth â€” most of
the time.
These secrets and more were revealed
last night by David Silverman, a director
and animator of Fox Television's cutting
edge show, "The Simpsons." Using clips
from both early footage and recent episodes,
Silverman showed the audience at Kresge
Auditorium how Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa
and Maggie have changed since they were
first seen on "The Tracey Ullman Show" six
years ago.
Early on, "Lisa was essentially a female
Bart. . . . ISince then I things have
changed," Silverman told the audience of

about 300 "Simpsons" fans.
When production began on a half-hour
version of the show, "it was a difficult task
to get all the animators to draw the charac
ters" like the original artists did, Silverman
said.
But he also noted that the quality of the
show has improved since its premiere in De
cember 1989. At that time, each episode
only required 12,000-14,000 animation
cells, compared to the 23,000 cells needed
now.
In between clips, Silverman answered
audience questions on a variety of topics, in
cluding his "Jurassic Bart" T-shirt, which
he admitted was contraband because it had
"two copyright infringements on one shirt. "
