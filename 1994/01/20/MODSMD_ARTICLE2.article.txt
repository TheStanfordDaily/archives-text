# The 						mystery of Bart
## 'Simpsons' director outlines show's evolution 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer 
Bart's head has nine points. And when
he smiles, you can see five teeth — most of
the time.
These secrets and more were revealed
last night by David Silverman, a director
and animator of Fox Television's cutting
edge show, "The Simpsons." Using clips
from both early footage and recent episodes,
Silverman showed the audience at Kresge
Auditorium how Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa
and Maggie have changed since they were
first seen on "The Tracey Ullman Show" six
years ago.
Early on, "Lisa was essentially a female
Bart. . . . ISince then I things have
changed," Silverman told the audience of

about 300 "Simpsons" fans.
When production began on a half-hour
version of the show, "it was a difficult task
to get all the animators to draw the charac
ters" like the original artists did, Silverman
said.
But he also noted that the quality of the
show has improved since its premiere in De
cember 1989. At that time, each episode
only required 12,000-14,000 animation
cells, compared to the 23,000 cells needed
now.
In between clips, Silverman answered
audience questions on a variety of topics, in
cluding his "Jurassic Bart" T-shirt, which
he admitted was contraband because it had
"two copyright infringements on one shirt. "
Silverman also said the show's
tight production schedule means
that even a small disruption can
be costly. "We can't squeeze our
schedule too much," Silverman
said, pointing out that Monday's
earthquake in Los Angeles may
force two episodes to be held

over until next season because
employees will lose two weeks of
work.
He explained that each episode
takes six months to produce, part
ly because some of the animation
work is done in Korea.
The slow turnaround also
means that his team cannot pro
duce as many shows per year as a
typical sitcom. In the four years it
has been on the air, there have
been only 107 episodes.

Silverman went on to say that
working with Fox has been a good
experience because "back in '89,
the other networks wouldn't have
[permitted| some of the story
lines."
And though even Fox censors
have intervened once or twice, Sil
verman said he never has had a
problem with their decisions.
"The Fox censors are very good.
We've always conceded that," he
said.
