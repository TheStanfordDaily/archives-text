# The
						art of trash talking

### 
Yo' mama so poor I saw her kicking a
Coke can along the street yesterday.
When I asked her what she was
doing, she said, "moving."

Most people would lump that yo' mama
line into an assortment of truly tasteless
and meaningless jokes these days —
blonde jokes being just one example.
However, even though the standard yo'
mama lines have metamorphosized into
bigger-than-life punchlines in several
"Saturday Night Live" gags and David Let
terman monologues, its grassroots still
remain firmly embedded in the tradition of
trash talk in the sports world.
Yeah, yo' mama so ugly, not even the
tide would take her out.
Although the standard 300-pound war
rior in the NFL wouldn't go around swap
ping yo' mama jokes on the line, the tradi
tion of trash talking is nevertheless alive
and well on the gridiron.
The Houston Oilers' defensive coordi
nator, Buddy Ryan, is every sports jour
nalist's wet dream, judging by the amount
of garbage he spewed during the AFC play
offs last week.
By the way he was yapping about his 46
defense and his quarterback blitzing, it
seemed that his target, Joe Montana, was
going to be sliced, diced and shipped out of
the Astrodome in a bodybag.
Now, Buddy is a man who trash-talks
without discretion both on and off the

field. He just couldn't help but threaten
that the Oilers had no qualms about taking
a personal foul or two if it meant perma
nently shredding Montana's injured ham
string or smashing in his bruised ribs dur
ing the course of the game.
No big deal, just another day at the
office.
Yo' mama so dumb, it took her two
hours to watch "60 Minutes."
You have to realize that football talk is
mild compared to the trash tossed around
the basketball courts, whether it be on
playground or in the NBA.
As dramatized (and maybe exaggerated)
in the movie "White Men Can't Jump,"
talking trash is just another intimidation
technique.
After Woody Harrelson misses a shot,
Wesley Snipes throws a yo' mama line at
him and Harrelson retorts, "You leave my
mama outta this, you hear?"
And Snipes concedes, "Alright, alright
. . . she's out, she's out — so when do you
want me to bring the bitch back?"
That intensity is probably turned up yet
another notch on the professional courts,
as profanity-ridden trash talk gushes from
the lips of Sir Charles Barkley, the bad
boys from New York and ot hers on a night
ly basis.
Yo' mama so dumb that when she went
to a movie that said under 17 not admitted,
she went out and got 16 of her closest
friends to go with her.
Baseball can't even hold a light to the
art of trash talking in the NFL or NBA.
Take, for example, Jose Canseco's feeble
attempt at dogging Will Clark a couple
years ago when both ballplayers were still
in the Bay Area.
Canseco told a gathering of reporters,
"Will Clark runs like a three-toed sloth."
What?
