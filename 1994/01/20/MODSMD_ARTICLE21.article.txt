# Anyone for three? Volleyball goes to Penn State for trifecta
## 
### Kathryn Yang Editorial staff 
Despite surprising many top
ranked clubs at the recent UC-
Santa Barbara Invitational, the
No. 4 Cardinal men's volleyball
team knows that one tournament
does not a season make.
Even though Stanford saw suc
cess at the Invite, it will travel to
Penn State this weekend with an
0-1 record because of its loss to
USC in the championship match
on Saturday.
"We came a long way during
the tournament," said head coach
Ruben Nieves. "But we still have
many areas to work on."
Some of those improvements
will come during this weekend's

three-day roadtrip into the heart
of Pennsylvania. The three-match
series, sponsored by the 10th
ranked Lions, is an effort to pro
mote collegiate volleyball on the
East Coast.
"Penn State is paying for our
entire trip," Nieves said. "We
don't get many opportunities like
that, and we want to make the
most out of it."
As the Lions and Stanford
shuttle to a total of three differ
ent sites over the weekend, the
Cardinal will focus on exacting
revenge against Penn State for
the preseason upset Stanford suf
fered in Canada during the fall
tune-ups.
Penn State throttled a Canyon
Ceman-less Cardinal squad dur

ing the Canadian promotional
trip. The match's final score, 15-
8, 15-3, 17-16, is testament to the
impact Ceman, the 1993 National
Player of the Year, has on the
team.
"I think Canyon will make
enough of a difference in any
game," Nieves said. "However,
even with him playing this week
end, we still have to focus on
being consistent in all three
matches if we are to win."
Stanford is very wary of Penn
State's low ranking, especially
since the Lions boast one of the
more complicated offenses in col
legiate ball today.
The Cardinal will have to com
bat an attack loaded with power
ful and mobile hitters, who jazz

looking to go in there
and beat them up
pretty badly.'

up the offense with crossing pat
terns and constant motion during
a series of plays.
According to Nieves, Stanford
will counter that style by serving
Penn State's opposite hitter
short and react-blocking on
defense — waiting until the ball
is set before springing up for the
block.

But strategies aside, the team
wants to concentrate on making
more adjustments and improve
ments during the road trip.
"I'm not satisfied with where
we are right now," said freshman
middle blocker Brian Moore.
"We've got to learn to maintain a
high level of play and keep pro
gressing."
Hoping to make that possible
this weekend will be a core of
four solid starters, with the two
middle-blocking positions
manned by a three-man rotation
consisting of senior Brian Gar
rett, Moore and freshman Mike
Hoeffer.
Slated to start in the opposite
hitting slot is 6-foot-7 freshman
Matt Fuerbringer. Filling in the

two swing hitting positions will be
6-5 senior Joe Burghardt and 6-6
sophomore Mike Lambert. And
assuming the setting duties will
be Ceman, a 6-5 four-year veter
an.
With Ceman back on the court
and a second-place finish tourna
ment finish under its belt, Stan
ford is ready give the East Coast a
little introduction into collegiate
volleyball.
"That last tournament us
a lot of confidence," Lambert
said. "It answered a lot of ques
tions, and it gave everyone tunnel
vision . . . we're all focused on
winning.
"This weekend we're looking to
go in there and beat them up pret
ty badly."
