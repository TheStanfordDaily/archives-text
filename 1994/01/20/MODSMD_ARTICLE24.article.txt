# Faculty Senate to hear undergrad education commission report today
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Commission on Undergraduate Education Chair
James Sheehan will give his quarterly report to the
Faculty Senate today, discussing the commission's
seven recently formed subcommittees and soliciting
input on their direction.
"The main purpose is to hear the senate's opin
ion," Sheehan said. "I'm just going to review what
we've talked about."
The subcommittees were formed after four
months of somewhat abstract debate by the com
mission. The individual groups will conduct inde
pendent studies of their topics over the course of this
quarter and issue final reports in the spring.
Among the issues the subcommittees will address

are "breadth requirements" — including Cultures,
Ideas and Values and distribution requirements —
and the academic calendar. Other groups will study
writing, foreign language, majors, technique and tech
nology in teaching and "academic environment" — a
category covering advising and residential education.
Going over the subcommittees will give senators
"a sense of the issues," Sheehan said.
The report will mainly be an attempt to solicit
opinions, he added.
"If there are things out there we should be talk
ing about, that's good to know," Sht»ehan said.
The next meeting of the full commission is set for
Feb. 14. The commission, which is charged with
addressing fundamental issues related to the under
graduate curriculum, will make its final recommenda
tions to University President Gerhard Casper by Oct. 1.
