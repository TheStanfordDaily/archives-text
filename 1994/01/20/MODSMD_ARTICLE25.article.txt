# ORPHEUS IN THE OUTER WORLD
## LIFE AFTER THE FRAT GIG 
### BY JANAR STEWART 
Kicking it at the ever-popular Cafe Borrone, members of the formerly Stanford-based pop
band Young Orpheus—Chad Dyers, Bo Helmich and Sean Bennett sans Eric Selvik—look
more like the boys-next-dorm than an up-and-coming rock group.
I Pressed in traditional undergraduate garb (flannel, sweats and the like) the trio nurse cappuc
cinos as Dyer flips through "Reason and Morality," a philosophy text he claims isn't worth reading.
It doesn't help that we all have these scholarly glasses," admits drummer Helmich.
Interestingly enough, the nerds-with-guitars image has never hampered their progress, while
the connection to Stanford has raised at least one brow.
"One club we played up in the City, Morty's, the woman who did the booking expressed a little
skepticism, relates guitarist Bennett. "But it was mainly just because she wasn't sure everybody
would be willing to make the trek up the Peninsula. It wasn't that she thought we couldn't play

because we went to Stanford."
And she definitely had a valid concern, especially considering extra pressure

to get a life Stanford students tend to pile upon themselves.

"I think a lot of people at Stanford are under the mistaken im
pression that they need to do every thing that they're going to do

in a real hurry," Bennett adds. "Like they have to get that job at
the consulting firm and then go straight into business

school. Or they have to go straight into medical school, get
the research fellowship and cure cancer by the time they're
40, or whatever.

"Basically, there are few times in your life when you
get to follow your heart and I just consider this to be
one of those times. I don't really have responsibilities
that would come with a profession and a family, say a
house I was making payments on. I really feel like a
lot of these things can wait."

And wait they do, for now. Although Bennett
presently works for Vivus, a biotech firm in Menlo
Park, he doesn't allow the demands ofa full-time job
to seep into his creative space.
"It I learned nothing else at Stanford, it was how
to juggle multiple things at one time," he continues.
"You can pursue this area of interest within your ca
reer and you can play music.
"Playing and finding time to practice is never the
issue. It's mainly the time that we need to do these
various logistical and managerial things that tends
to be hard to find."

Thus, the current search for a new manager —
someone who can handle booking, promotions
and everything else outside of song writing and ar
ranging. Of course, the difficulty in soliciting a
manager only doubles for unsigned bands like
Young Orpheus, given the job's high
workload/low reward potential.
Not many will be able to match the commit
ment former manager Jim Haljun, also a Stanford
graduate, brought to the job. When Haljun
booked Young Orpheus' West Coast tour, he
knew he'd have to tug a few arms, make a few
calls, maybe even curse out a few club owners.

But he didn't foresee the "tick bite" ballooning
into Lyme disease.
"[ Jim | lost his wallet on the way up to Seattle,"
Bennett recaps. "Aside from just the nuisance of
having to deal with that, it also meant that he
didn't have any ID. Even though he was
with us, it was like at some of these places

the doors were manned by meatheads.
They just wouldn't let you in if you
didn't have any ID."
Bennett describes Haljun as "will
ing to sit in a cold van in this deserted
parking lot for hours while [ Young Or
pheus waited] to play a 45-minute set
at this Chinese restaurant/bar without

complaining at all."
As a result, Haljun missed out on much of the fun part of his job.
"Except for the one time we put him on stage with a guitar and acted like he was part of the band
even though he was like sitting there strumming a guitar that wasn't plugged in," Dyer interjects.
"That was a joke." "
"The band is not just the members," Bennett asserts, mentioning producer/engineer Kevin
I)onlon, who recorded Young Orpheus' demo ami who now enthusiastically plans to lay down a
five or six-song HP with them in February. "Without pei»ple like Kevin and Jim, J think we'd feel a
lot lonelier and a lot less sure of ourselves. It's nice to know that we can count on support from peo
ple like that."
Numerous Stanford ties and a strong support network do come with a few negatives, however.
Because Dyer and the other band members lean slightly more toward self-deprecation on the es

teem spectrum, Haljun handled all promotional aspects of their career.
"Our personalities aren't such that we're going to go out and talk ourselves up and totally sell
ourselves," Dyer describes. "The great thing about )im was, that is totally Jim."
"Almost shameless," Bennett adds.
"It was actually bad for me, cause now I'm applying for jobs for myself and I haven't had any ex
perience [selling myself] because Jim did it for Young Orpheus," Dyer reveals. "So me and Jim have
this joke where like whenever I have a job interview, he's gonna have a teleconference with the in
terviewer. ... He's gonna manage my employment career."
For now, that downside carries little weight since Young Orpheus intends to concentrate on per
formances and personal development. In fact, they embarked on their West Coast tour with more
hopes of learning from the experience than career building.

"[Touring] wasn't like, 'Maybe an A&R person will be in the audience and we'll

get discovered,' " Dyers explains. "That was more for our own identifica-

tion, bonding and development."

"And seeing the sights," Helmich interjects.
"We played at this place in Seattle called the New World, a
rock club/Chinese restaurant. Chinese restaurant by day —
I'm not kidding you. The other bands on the bill were Obliv
ion," muses Dyers, "Alter Eden, Doctor Grind — "

"Unsigned MTV wannabes," Helmich adds.
"So we came on after these three total metal bands.
Oblivion was the best because it was like watching the
Broadway version of Spinal Tap," Dyer describes.
"Every cliche you could think of — "

"Simulated oral sex on the guitars, Spandex and
makeup," Dyer recounts, cutting his bandmate off.
"So yeah, that was pretty interesting.
"Even though it wasn't really career development as
much as personal development, there were little con
nections we'd made. We met a guy in Tacoma (Dave
Sheldon) who is booking a tour for us during Spring
Break in Seattle. This time it will be a lot more career
development when we go up there because we'll be
playing with local bands that'll have a strong follow
ing. [Sheldon's] not going to put us with metal bands
because he knows what our music is like.
"We met him at this totally empty Bud

Light poster bar. There was like nobody in the audi
ence except for the other band. Oh, they did have a
Pop-A-Shot. That was a rare treat," Dyer admits. "I
learned from the tour to always play for yourself. At
that show, there was nobody there. If we had just
blown it off and played like shit, then we never
would have met [ Sheldon ]. On some level, it's great
to have a big audience, but on another level you just
have to love doing it for doing it.
Dyer pauses before recalling more surpris
es from the tour: "Another cool thing that came
out of that is (Sheldon) writes for a local enter
tainment paper. So he reviewed our demo, and
from this tiny review in this tiny little Tacoma
paper two record companies have called us to ask
us to send them tapes. You never know."
Bennett quickly adds, "They ask a lot of
people for tapes, but it's still nice to know that
you're getting attention."
"A total blip on the music industry spec
trum," remarks Dyer.

"But that's not to suggest that we aren't
playing around here, too. The latest gig
we played was a benefit concert at The
Edge in Palo Alto," Bennett states,
pulling up his crew sweatshirt to reveal
the Sanha AIDS benefit T-shirt under
neath. "That was good because it was the
same kind of exposure, except around
here.... There was a band whose singer

liked our music and who suggested the possibility of us opening for them at clubs around here."
And all the new attention suggests balancing "real life" and dreams can prove successful. As
YoungOtphcus tiptoes along a towering fence until the moment one side or the other seems more
appealing, other Stanford students are leaping onto one career path or another.
Although Bennett $ tiiul words say nothing new, they urge the jumpers to stop for a moment
and reflect on "life after Stanford."
"You're going to lie a better and more successful person if voure happy.... I just feel that given
how important music was to me in school, gosh evrn in high school, it would be ridiculous not to
pursue it now." ■

Young Orpheus will open for the Grays at the Coffee House on Feb. 4. They also will appear at the Edge
in Palo Alto on Feb. 27.
