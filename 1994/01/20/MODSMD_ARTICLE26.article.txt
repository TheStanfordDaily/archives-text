# Towhead Portrait of a restless campus band
## 
### Scott Van Winkle 
Silicon Valley is
never going to
become the
next Seattle. But don't
tell that to the six Stan
ford grads in Tow
head, a rising hand
with lots of local color.
No, not Cardinal
red (unless you count
drummer Mark
Somol's sunburnish
tint). What I'm talking
about is a sound built
upon the various ex
periences of six very
different musicians.
In a low-key inter
view behind the Knoll,
where the group re
hearses, guitarist Pete
Drobac is thinking
about how best to de
scribe the band's
eclectic sound. "It's
rock with funk and
jazz influences," he de
cides. More impor
tantly, it's not a sound
that happened
overnight. It took a
while for the group to
find itself musically, as
it gained new mem
bers and learned to
play for different audi-

ences.
"What's nice is that now we have six visions
that are starting to coalesce," says vocalist Sean
White. Drobac adds, "Up until now we've
played a number of different sounds in our own
music."

Towhead started about two years ago
playing campus parties. Back then,
however, they performed under a differ
ent name with guitarists Drobac and Dean
Meritt, while bassist Josh Loftus and Somol
played with a rival campus band. Saxophonist
Brian Knutson and White came last.
The band originally consisted entirely of
blondes — hence "Towhead," a synonym for
their shade of hair — before vocalist White (a
brunette) signed on.
As the band was taking shape, campus
crowds reacted both positively and negatively
to their inclusion of Towhead originals at par
ties. "The campus can be really hard on bands
that play original music," says Somol.
"We've played to some empty rooms before.
But 1 think that had more to do with where the
alcohol was than anything else," Loftus con
cludes.
Nevertheless, the band won Phi Kappa Psi's
"Battle of the Bands" last year playing mostly
original music, and decided to try to take their

show to the City.
And with a successful December show at
Club Boomerang and an invitation to play
there again, "we've finally got our foot in the
door," declares Merrit.
The change in venue has brought different
expectations to the band. "It's nice to find a
niche where you're expected to play your own
music," Meritt explains. At the same time, the
band hasn't forgotten the lessons of playing be
fore campus crowds.
"What we're trying to do is put out music
that is interesting and means something but
that also makes people want to dance," Knut
son says.
Melding the different musical ideas and
sounds of all «ix members has at times been dif
ficult for Towhead. "There have been times
when it sounded like six solos at once," says
Meritt. The current trend in their songwriting

is "downsizing," he adds.
Quoting Pascal's remark, "I'd write a short
er letter but I didn't have the time," Knutson ex
plains that their songs have tended to run a lit
tle long in the past. With three songwriters and
a writing process where "everybody con
tributes," it's easy to see how songs can get a lit
tle out of hand.
With tightened-up songwriting and up
coming club dates, the band has lofty goals for
the new year. They are in the process of looking
for a manager with enough connections to get
people to take a listen. "We think we really have
a chance to do something big," says Drobac.
The vision Meritt outlines for the band in
volves getting a regular spot at a club in
San Francisco, then in "the best of all
possibilities" getting picked up by an indepen
dent record label, or failing that, producing an

album themselves
over this summer.
Which is not to say
there aren't other pos
sibilities for directions
the band might want
to go. The band mem
bers all have day jobs,
and they are realistic
about their chances.
"It's a tough line to
draw," says Drobac,
"but at some point,
the well might dry up."
While band mem
bers admit that having
day jobs commensu
rate with graduating
from Stanford takes
time away from the
promotion end of the
business, White's job,
at least, seems to be
presenting a new av
enue for self-promo
tion.
White's research at
a local firm has led
him to explore ways
that the band can put
"our sound and who
we are" on the Inter
net. A few indepen
dent labels have pro
moted their bands

with this new com
munication system, and have received a great
deal of response, he added.
In something of a parody of that MCI com
mercial ("There will be no more 'there' "),
band members say, "Towhead will be every
where."
This may reek of Silicon Valley high technol
ogy, but at least for Knutson, it all comes down
to good basic science — "when there's chem
istry there, that's all you really need," he says.
Drobac agrees. "The main idea is we're try
ing to entertain ourselves," he says, figuring that
if they aren't bored by their music, the crowd
won't be either.
While grunge has caught on around cam
pus, band members feel that the music doesn't
fit their sound. "We'd be on the tail end of a
sound that's going to die out by the time we'd be
able to take advantage of it,"says Somol.
Still the band feels, "There are times when
there's a lot of good music coming out of Stan
ford," says Somol. But Towhead feels they've
out-grown the Stanford scene, and are ready to
give other Bay Area venues a chance. "We've
played some great parties," says Somol, "but we
got tired of it." ■

Towhead performs at Club Boomerang, 1840
Haight Street at Stanyan, on Jan 26 at 9:45
p.m. Admission is free.
