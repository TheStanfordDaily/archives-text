While it might seem a daunting
challenge to tackle a perceived
shortage of drama opportunities
on campus, a new student organization
called Ergo is attempting to bring more
drama to the Stanford community. The
group is the brainchild of sophomores
Michelle Traven and Akin Salawu.
"There wasn't enough theater on campus
[autumn] quarter," Salawu recalls. "So one
day Michelle walked into the costume shop
and said, l I had a dream Akin. Would you be
interested in starting a student group to do
non-musicals?' I said 'Yeah.' 1 was ecstatic."
The inspiration for this dream resulted
from Traven's musings about the Stanford
drama scene. She realized that an established
non-musical, student-run organization was
missing.
"I was sitting in my room thinking and
was a little peeved that the only big student
[drama] group on campus [Ram's Head] did
mainly musicals. I felt that we needed a sta
ble group to give the Stanford community
some more non-musical drama," Traven re
lates.
"While sitting in my room, 1 thought of
Ergo. 1 talked to Akin about it and he was
game."
In the meantime, the two sophomores
serve as the main members of the new
organization, with Traven as the finan
cial and organizational manager and Salawu
the creative mastermind. Though only in its

embryonic stage, Ergo
is already striving to
ward lofty goals, stag
ing a performance of
Thornton Wilder's
"The Skin of Our
Teeth" later this
month. Auditions
were finished before
Thanksgiving and a
cast was assembled
after that short break.
But with distractions
like winter break and
exams before that,
Ergo has had little
time to work in
earnest.
To meet such ob
stacles, Salawu's en
thusiasm has been a
driving force behind
turning Ergo's ideas
into reality. Forming
the group has given
Salawu the chance to
act on his enthusiasm.
For instance, he is di
recting "The Skin of
Our Teeth" because
it's one of his fa
vorites

"When we were deciding what play to do,
Michelle asked me what my dream play was.
I said 'The Skin of Our Teeth.' No doubt. It's
got a huge cast. It's a fantasy and a lot of fun.
It manages to be literature and fun at the
same time, so its got its educational aspects.
"My junior year [in high school], we did
'The Skin of Our Teeth' and I fell in love with
it," Salawu remembers. "Then I went to see
the New Jersey Shakespeare Company's per
formance of it and loved it. Ever since then,
whenever anyone's doing 'The Skin of Our
Teeth,' I go see it."
Despite time and financial con
straints, the director has forged
ahead, finding creative solutions to
seemingly difficult logistical problems. As
Salawu puts it himself, "When there's little
time and little money, creativity bursts out."
Creativity shows itself in finding cos
tumes and props for the play. Before winter
break, cast members were given a list of
things the production needed. According to
Traven, who is helping with costuming,
much of the cast has supplied themselves
with the outfits.
"Because of the shoestring budget, we're
having the actors bring in as much as they
can of their own costumes," Traven explains.
"It's going well. They're cooperating and not
being grouchy, because they understand it's
a student group starting out."
Salawu's enthusiasm for the project man
ifests itself in his determination to make the

production work. According to him, he
spent much of his break looking for props
and finding ways to ship them from his New
Jersey home.
Copying scripts also testifies to Salawu's
dedication to the play.
"One night, 1 needed 20 scripts of about
50 pages each to be printed for my actors the
next day. I had to have them for the next day.
It was very important, because the play is
very important to me. My bicycle was bro
ken, so 1 walked to Kinko's. It was midnight,
but 1 didn't care, because I had to have them
for rehearsal," Salawu remembers.
"Ever since we've started on the weekend
before Thanksgiving, I've probably been to
Kinko's three times a week."
Moreover, the cost of printing fliers and
scripts has come out of Salawu's own pocket.
While he hopes to be reimbursed through
ticket sales, it's not all that important to him.
"If I don't get reimbursed, it won't be the
end of the world, because I have been so ob
sessively loving of the play."
Salawu's enthusiasm also fuels his cre
ativity. Although limitations of time
and money proved to be problemat
ic, Salawu has still been able to create the
performance he has envisioned. Being a fan-

tasy play, Salawu
says that "The
Skin of Our
Teeth" is open to
creative inter
pretation. He is
taking advan
tage of that
quality, putting
a new spin on
the standard
play.
"I can say for
a fact that this
show is not a
copycat of the
productions I
have liked,"
Salawu states.
Many of
Sala w us 's
changes to the
play were in
spired by seeing
a conventional
performance of
the play last
quarter by The
atre Works, a
local drama
group. Salawu
found parts of
their version
"annoyingly
dull." The direc
tor hopes to in
flisp cnmp

life into the play by modernizing it.
For example, in Wilder's original work of
1942, the three acts took place in 1910, 1920
and 1940. In Salawu's production, the acts
take place in 1954, 1994 and 2034, respec
tively. What's more, Salawu has contempo
rized the content of the play as well.
"It's a very, very modern production of
'The Skin of Our Teeth,' " Salawu says, de
scribing his version of the play. "We're play
ing Madonna and Janet Jackson along with
music from the '50s and '70s. It's very mod
ern and very strange stuff."
Beyond his personal resolve, rapport
with the actors has helped Salawu
pull off this project. The actors
seem to have faith in Salawu's creativity and
enthusiasm and vice versa. As a whole, the
cast appreciates the director's fervor for the
play.
"[Salawu] is really creative," sophomore
Jennifer Siebel, who has three small roles in
the play, says of the director. "I'm thrilled.
It's a strange plot and I love what he's doing
with it. He's making it fun and he's making it
exciting. It's not going to be a dull perfor
mance."
"It's inspiring to have someone who's
only a sophomore [at Stanford! and is un

dertaking a very ambitious project. It's [also]
inspiring because he's very excited about it.
It helps to have someone who is so enthusi
astic," adds second-year graduate student
Ajay Shah. Shah plays the lead character, Mr.
Antrobus.
In fact, the cast mirrors the director in its
exuberance. One of the most important cri
teria in selecting actors from the auditions
was how eager they were to take part in the
production.
"1 wasn't just interested in who could act,
but also interested in who had enthusiasm,"
Salawu explains. "The audition form had
two sides. The second side had things like
enthusiasm, attitude and acting ability and
we rated them on all that. Anyone who had
a good grade for an average of all those
things was cast."
And certainly, Ergo's production of
"The Skin of Our Teeth" has
achieved what it set out to do â€”
provide the Stanford community with more
drama. Salawu notes that many of the actors
have little acting experience on the collegiate
level. Ergo has allowed students who haven't
acted a lot a chance to tinker in drama.
"There's the departmental shows, but the
people who eo to the auditions and eet the

parts are drama majors. If you wanted to try
out acting, you couldn't just walk in and do
it," first-time actor sophomore Heather Pen
der claims. "Then there's Ram's Head.
1 here's stuff like Gaieties, but you have to
sing. So there's not really anything for the
person who wants to experiment with acting.
"I imagine we [the cast] are all attention
mongers, who like to be in the spotlight. We
like to be loud and we're a little odd."
Still, these strong personalities have
worked well together. By all accounts, the ca
maraderie of the production is good and the
acting group is beginning to gel. The direc
tor says that despite having such a diverse
body of individuals, the "company is work
ing very, very well together."
Ihe actors also see that the pieces are
falling in place. Junior Lynne Christofferson
says that the abstract character work done
earlier in the process is coming together now
that the performance is near. Shah concurs
with that assessment, pointing out that with
the short amount of preparation time, they
are getting the play ready fast and beginning
to nail down their parts.
Aside from the cooperation of the ac
tors, perhaps the most important
factor in Ergo's success up until now

is the help given by the
Drama Department. Ac
cording to Traven, a lot of
that help has been in the
administrative area.
"[The depart
ment] has given us ad
vice, like how to organize
the time schedule of
events before a perfor
mance and with ticket
sales and things like that.
Preparing in general,"
Traven explains.
In one sense,
"The Skin of Our Teeth"
would not be possible
without the help of the
Drama Department. The
rehearsals and perfor
mances are taking place
in the Eleanor Prosser
Studio, a small venue set
aside by the department
for classes and student
run productions. Salawu
is thankful that Ergo's
petition for the use of the
Prosser Studio was ac
cepted.
"You have to
make a proposal to use
Prosser. The department,
1 must say, has been very,
very good about giving
us use of Prosser as op-
Dosed to last vear. which

was the first year they
were letting people
use Prosser. Now, the
process is very expedi
ent and they've been
much more helpful
than we expected."
Alex Stewart, the
atre director in the
Drama Department,
points out that the
purpose for opening
up the Prosser Studio
to student shows was
to encourage more
productions.
"It [the opening of
the Prosser Studio]
has allowed students
to do more planned
productions. Before
the space may have
been available to do a
show on a couple of
nights. But to find re
hearsal space would
have been unbearable.
"They couldn't
have done it. We've
tried to set it up this
year, and it's an exper-

iment to see how the scheduling works, so
that the students have a longer period of
time in the studio just before they go up."
Of course, more access to functional
venues like the Prosser Studio would help
to alleviate the perceived problem that
there is a lack of drama on campus.
However, Stewart doesn't see there being
a shortage of acting opportunities at Stan
ford. Rather, he feels that some parts of the
community don't realize all the possibili
ties.
"I think that certain segments of the stu
dent body just aren't aware of how much is
going on," Stewart says.
"We have, since the implementation of
the Prosser studio, given the student body
another venue in which to perform, a venue
where lights are available to them and an
audience can be conveniently seated in the
space.
"That's something new. And a lot of time
people don't know that place exists and is
available not only to Drama Department
students who perform their senior projects
there, but also to the general student body."
Just as Salawu will concede that the
Drama Department's help this year
has been invaluable, he also points
out that he has learned from hard experi
ence just how to work with the department.
Last year, his proposal to use the Prosser
Studio for a performance was rejected by
the department. In essence, that incident
proved a pivotal one in helping Salawu de

fine what he wanted to do and for the de
partment to decide how the Studio was tc
be used.
"I was the first person to ask to do a shov\
in Prosser, so 1 was basically the guinea piÂ§
and they used my proposal to make up a
form. They rejected my proposal, so 1 wa
very upset and 1 spent a great deal of tim
moaning and groaning about how the de
partment didn't let me do my show,'
Salawu remembers.
"In comparison to all the hemming and
hawing last year, this has been a dream. . .
I was expecting to have the same kind ol
hassles I had last year, but I haven't."
Having passed such hardships and
earned the experience to deal with them, it
looks as if Ergo is well on its way to estab
lishing itself as the stable student-run
drama group it wants to be. The organiza
tion looks to expand its network by holding
an organizational meeting later in the year.
Also, the group is intent on producing an
other performance in the spring. Traven
and Salawu hope for a big turnout in both
cases. If the audition for "The Skin of Our
Teeth" is any indication, they should get
one.
"The fact that we got 30 people to audi
tion means there's obviously a need for
more student-run drama," Salawu notes.
Ergo will perform Thornton Wilder s "The Skin
of Our Teeth" Jan. 26 through 29 at Eleanor
Prosser Studio, on the second floor of the Drama
Department. Tickets are five dollars.
