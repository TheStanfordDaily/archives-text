# Blue tango in Paris
## Juliette Binoche captivates in Kieslowski's 'Blue' 
### 
From the eerie opening sequence, shot
from beneath a car driving on a gray, wet free
way, one gets the impression that this film will
not be the usual fare.
"Blue" does not disappoint.
Polish writer-director Krzysztof Kieslowski's
("The Double Life of Veronique") "Blue" is the

first in a trilogy of films conceptually based on
the three colors of the French flag: blue stands
for liberty, white for equality, red for fraternity.
Although the three films' characters and themes
are intertwined, "Blue" stands on its own.
Through the story of Julie (Juliette
Binoche), "Blue" examines the impossibility

of achieving liberty in one's personal life. In
the first few minutes of the film, Julie's hus
band (a famous French composer) and five
year-old daughter are killed in a car crash. Un
able to bear the pain, she considers suicide, but
can't go through with it. Instead she decides to
separate herself from all aspects of her past life.
She rids herself of all objects that remind
her of her marriage, including her husband's
papers and an unfinished concerto. After plac
ing her mother in a nursing home and settling
her financial affairs, she leaves to become a
recluse in Paris.
So Julie begins her new life of "doing noth
ing." She seeks complete detachment from
other people, but finds this way of life difficult
to maintain. A street musician plays a tunc
written by her husband. When she refuses to
sign a renter's petition to evict a prostitute
from the building (not wanting to become in
volved), the prostitute comes up to thank her
with a bouquet, seeking her friendship.
Although cracks are beginning to show in
her resolve, it truly breaks when she learns
from the news that her husband's assistant
plans to finish the unfinished concerto and
that her husband had a mistress. Ironically, it
is this last revelation which enables her to re
join the living.
Julie's extreme reaction to her losses is not
unrealistic given the enormity of her tragedy,
but Kieslowski is more concerned with the
symbolic nature of her struggle to exist. Hu
mans arc never really free, he seems to be say
ing, as long as there arc emotional attach
ments to people or ties to objects or places.
As Julie, Binoche gives an extraordinary
performance. Since she appears alone in much
of the film, struggling with her memories and
her feelings, her role is extremely vulnerable to
over- or underacting. Binoche strikes the per

feet tone in every scene, communicating vol
umes with her face without uttering a sound.
Although Binoche provides the anchor,
what makes this film so marvelous is the ab
solute feast of images and equally stunning
sound design Kieslowski uses to tell his story.
In fact, "Blue" is that rarity in commercial film
— an accessible, engaging work of art.
Each scene is perfectly art directed and
stylized. By using blue and gold filters, Kies
lowski contrasts moods and tones to create a
rich world of colors that could only exist on
film. Frequently, the camera shoots from
Julie's point of view, and never has the project
ed image physically reflected the human point
of view so accurately. As Julie reads over a
music score of Julie's deceased husband, the
camera manages to imitate what a human sees
when his or her eyes well up with tears. Rather
than being cheap or distracting, these camera
tricks create a world of visions that make the
conventional way of filming an individual's
experience seem fake and obsolete.
But Kieslowski does not limit himself to
breaking ground visually. I"he sound design is as
perfect as the art direction, further expanding
the world of "Blue." Many "scenes" take place
completely off-camera, with Julie or other char
acters in close-up on the screen. Again, the indi
vidual experience is conveyed more completely
by showing this aspect of our experience.
The one distancing device in "Blue" is the
repetitive use of "musical blackouts," during
which the screen fades to black as Julie re
members her husband's music.
l'he only other distraction for non-French
speaking audience will be reading the subti
tles, but don't let that hold you back. "Blue" is
about experience, emotions, beauty and art,
not dialogue.
