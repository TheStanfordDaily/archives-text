Hey race fans, can you say cheese? "Iron
Will," Disney's latest true-life drama, is
cheesier than the whole state of Wisconsin.
Set in 1917, it is the story of "Iron" Will
Stoncman, a 17-year-old from South Dakota
with enough grit and gall to put most Stan
ford men to shame. By winning a 500-mile
sled-dog race while defeating experienced
foreign brutes who have sacrificed fingers to
frostbite, Will garners enough money to pay
for college and save the family farm.
Of course, a Disney flick is always expect
ed to have a certain

amount of cheese —
but this one has the
crackers too. Through
"Iro,n Will" some nos
talgic adults could live
out their even their
most inane adoles
cent, superman fan
tasies. Then there's
Disney's attempt at PC
filmmaking with the
token character of
Will's Native Ameri-

can mentor. Overall, "Iron Will" creates a
feeling of icky-sweetness with its attempt at
creating the "perfect family drama."
But on the bright side, the dogs are really,
really cute.
This dramatization of Will's journey into
adulthood and his victory in the classic bat
tles of man vs. nature and man vs. himself
had the potential to be a salient, touching
film. Unfortunately for "Iron Will" the entire
plot folds out within the first five minutes,
seeming contrived and rushed. Another
strike was the casting of Mackenzie Astin as
Will. Having the former "Facts of Life" brat
play the young hero takes away from the
poignancy of the story. Though pleasing to
gaze at, the boy just can't act.
Despite the film's flaws, there are a few
good moments. The start of the race is ten
sion filled, and gets the heart pumping. Then
that organ descends to the stomach as Gus,
Will's lead dog, is brutally injured. This is the
killer: When the classic Lex Luther type
threatens Will with a knife, our young hero
brandishes a gun. A gun? Is this still Disney?
"Iron Will" gives a shallow, fecl-good sen
sation which doesn't last beyond the theater
doors. It just goes to show — sometimes it's
just not enough to be munching on cheese.
