# Panel: Russian nationalism needs scrutiny, not hysteria
## 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
While downplaying the danger of the rise
of nationalist sentiments in Russia, four ex
perts last night warned that such develop
ments still need to be addressed by Russian
and Western leaders alike.
Speaking before roughly 80 people, the
panelists — all of whom were in Russia dur
ing the elections — discussed the results of
December's parliamentary elections in Rus
sia, focusing on the surprising success of
ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Moderator Chip Blacker, deputy director
of the Institute for International Studies,
opened the discussion by asking whether
Zhirinovsky's success in the elections was

"politics as usual, or should we be deeply
concerned, even alarmed?"
Hoover Fellow Michael McFaul, a re
search associate at the Stanford Center for
International Security and Arms Control,
noted that answering that question re
quires an examination of the reasons for
Zhirinovsky's success. He pointed to poor
economic conditions and general dissatis
faction in Russia to explain the failure of
candidates favoring liberal reforms.
McFaul said that "Zhirinovsky ran a
quite brilliant campaign," using the media
to its full potential and sending a clear mes
sage to the Russian people. By contrast, the
democrats "ran an absolutely miserable
campaign" plagued by internal
division, ineffective use of the
media and an arrogant belief that
they were the Russian people's
only alternative.

Slavic Languages Prof. Grego
ry Freidin agreed, saying that the
liberal reformers' overconfidence
alienated the electorate. He added
that their campaign failed to
address the concerns of outlying
regions. And, he said, by catering
"to the St. Petersburg intelli

gentsia," the reformers' cam
paign became "one big narcissistic
show that would only irritate peo
ple."
McFaul said he had a hunch
that "Zhirinovsky will self
destruct" hut still stressed that it
is important not to dismiss Zhiri
novsky. "1 think he is a rather
dangerous character," he said.
While he also does not expect
Zhirinovsky's prominence to last
very long, Freidin said it is never
theless important to determine
exactly who his supporters are.
History and Political Science
Prof. Alexander Dallin said Zhiri
novsky's success reflected the

Russian people's "search for some
kind of identification." He argued
that "if there wasn't a Zhiri
novsky he would have to be
invented" — that is, Zhirinovsky
was more a catalyst of ultrana
tionalist fervor than its creator.

Dallin said Zhirinovsky's suc
cess is partially responsible for
the increased nationalism in Rus
sian foreign policy since the elec
tions, as Russian leaders attempt
to draw support uway from the
ultranationalists by adopting
some of their views. But Blacker
cautioned that "there is more at
work [in Russia | than political
opportunism."
