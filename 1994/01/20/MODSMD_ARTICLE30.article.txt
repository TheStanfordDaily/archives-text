For those of you who caught Mike Leigh's
"Life is Sweet," be prepared to experience
something completely different in "Naked."
The director's latest film is extremely painful
to watch — it makes you wince. "Naked" takes
the worst view of male-female relations and
pushes it to an extreme. At best, "Naked" is an
ingenious portrait of Johnny, a clever man suf
focating in the doomed working-class world of
England. At worst, the film is misogynistic, im
plying that all women are masochists.
As an intellectual drifter who has no place in
his society, Johnny lives his nihilistic life with a
vengeance, taking out his frustration on him
self and women while at the same time finding
humor in the irony of it all. Given this "juicy"
role, David Thewlis certainly plays it to the hilt.
before the titles roll, Johnny is introduced
raping a woman in an alley. Then he hightails it
over to London to hook up with his ex-girl
friend, Louise. She isn't home, but her room
mate Sophie is. lieforc long, Johnny and So
phie arc having "aggressive sex" — which, by
the way, means that Johnny is aggressive and
Sophie gets her head slammed against the fur
niture (which she likes).

When Louise returns, Johnny proceeds to
torment her. Apparently this is his way of saying,
"I love you." Driven out by love-crazed Sophie,
he retreats to the streets, abusing various people
until, surprise, someone finally beats him up.
Since Johnny has an opinion on everything,
one wonders why leigh doesn't include as
peech on exactly why Johnny treats women like
dirt. I he film's female characters promote the
idea that women want to be treated this way.
The only truth that I.eigh nails is that
when men get angry and frustrated, they not
only destroy themselves, but take it out on
women as well. Women don't have this luxu
ry, they just take it out on themselves.
If you know this already, you probably
won't gain anything by seeing "Naked."
