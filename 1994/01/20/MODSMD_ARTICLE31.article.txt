# Killing him softly
## Frank Sinatra's 'Duets' spells slow commercial death 
### 
Sometimes, a little knowledge is a danger
ous thing. A case in point involves Frank Sina
tra's latest release, "Duets," an album filled
with snappy asides and spontaneous repartee
between Frank and his singing partners.
Kxcept the repartee is anything but sponta
neous. For on "Duets," Sinatra and Co. record
ed their individual takes hundreds, sometimes
thousands, of miles apart. Armed with this
knowledge, somehow Tony Bennett's cry of
"Tell em, Frank!" in "New York, New York"
comes off as a wee bit cynical.
"Duets" is the latest step in the ongoing pop
deification of the aging, listless Sinatra, an
artist who has been placing songs atop the pop
charts since 1940. Farlier steps in this process
involved granting Sinatra eternal ownership of
certain songs, such as the aforementioned
"New York, New York," even when he was not
the first to record them. In fact, Sinatra's ver
sion of "New York" appeared on the pop charts
in 1980, not 1940.
Now, with "Duets" Sinatra "teams" with 13
celebrated (i.e. Tony Bennett) and not-so-cele
brated (Kenny G) artists in order to rehash a
baker's dozen of "his" all-time classics.
The first indication that something is amiss
with the album comes from a cursory glance at
Frank's choices of singing and playing part
ners. Where's Johnny Mathis? Where's Dean
Martin? And what business does Kenny Ghave
performing with artists who possess a mod
icum of talent? In fact, in addition to re
spectable singers such as Aretha Franklin, Ben
nett and Barbra Streisand, the Multinational
Sinatra (Corporation Ltd. has chosen to per
form with such lesser lights as Julio Iglesias, the
vastly overrated Natalie Cole and, alas, Mr. G.
Nevertheless, certain songs on "Duets" al
most make you forget the crass hypocrisy in
herent in the album's recording method. One

such take is the Sinatra / Baker construction
"Witchcraft." Of course, Anita Baker could
sing the telephone directory and it would still
sound great. Yet in "Witchcraft" both Sinatra
and Baker keep the mindless cloying to a min
imum and get down to the business of singing
— a welcome change from "Duets" s cubic
zirconium brand of charm.
On the other hand, the low point of the
album comes with the Sinatra / Bono record
ing "I've Got You Under my Skin." Bono, of the
group U2, appears to have taken the song's title
quite literally, performing in a Jeffrey Dahmer
esque state of manic-depression. Meanwhile,
the Chairman of the Board, who was probably
sipping margaritas on a Tahitian beach when
Bono recorded his take, hums away dutifully.
This song represents all that is wrong with
both "Duets" and the superimposition process
it utilizes. If Sinatra were in the studio, he
would have slapped Bono. Hard. Then he
would have said, "lx>ok, kid, you don't treat the
classics that way. Straighten up and fly right,
OK?" And Bono would have suddenly realized
how damn foolish he had been and performed
a more reasonable rendition. But, apparently,
neither Sinatra nor Bono respected their mate
rial enough to record it together.
The most irritating things about "Duets" is
the fact that it is yet another step in the decade
long regression that has seen Sinatra become a
parody of his earlier self. A large part of his
charm in the 1940s and 1950s came from the
fact that any ordinary guy in the audience could
be that short, wiry man from I loboken, N.J.,
with only the right breaks and a little hard work.
Sinatra always seemed to know that he was only
one step up on the ladder from the rest of the
bums, and he made sure to give his fans their
money's worth.
But now, he simply doesn't seem to care.

In the booklet accompanying "Duets," the
musicians and producers who worked with
Sinatra on the album marvel at his "economy"
and "urgency." "Historically a man of few
takes," the album states, "Sinatra proved once

again that he's not the type to waste time in the
studio."
After all, he probably had a golf game to
hurry to.
