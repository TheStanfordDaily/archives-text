Queen latifah may now be donning the
hats of record company mogul and actress,
but she is still holding on strong to her title as
the first lady of hip-hop.
Her latest album, "Black Reign," not only
marks her departure from Tommy Boy
Records and her first recording on the revital
ized Motown label, but it also serves as a fitting
tribute to her brother and co producer,
Lancelot Owens, who unfortunately died be
fore the album's completion. She dedicates the
entire work to him, including a special song,

"Winki's Theme," in
his honor which
gives the project a re
ligious vibe.

cuts like "I Can't

"Superstar" which
display her unique

style — a mixture of rough-neck attitude and
round-the-way sass.
And "Black Reign" doesn't let down fans
who love latifah for her positivity either.
"Coochie Bang," co-written by Treach of
Naughty by Nature, draws you in with its
danceable beat before you realize that it is a
song spouting the importance of safe sex.
"Mood is Right" picks up where the for

couraging casual sex. The first release,
"U.N.1.T.Y," contributes another dose of pos
itivity, condemning violence and degrading,
abusive language toward women — two
things no queen should have to tolerate.

to the toughness of "Rough ..latifah pre
sents a range of rhythms that are pleasing to
any ear. She finds just the right balance of hip
hop and Rhythm & Blues. The smooth vocals
of Tony Rebel definitely add spice to a brew al

the instrumental groove "Weekend Love."
latifah has not only established herself as the
star of a hit sitcom ("I.iving Single") and the
manager of some of hip hop's top names
(Naughty By Nature, Black Sheep), she has pro

her musical talent. lx>ng live the Queen!
