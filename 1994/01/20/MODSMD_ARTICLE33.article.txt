# "Breaking Things" All
## 
### 
All's latest album, "Breaking Things," is
the legacy of Bill Stevenson and his band, the
Descendents. It retains many of the earlier
band's members and much of their tradi
tional style — melodic chords and killer
hooks that when put together resemble pop
sounds at its lightest, hard-core punk at its
heaviest.
Steven Egerton's guitar work is no rocket
scientist's feat, but he constantly succeeds in
compiling different and original melodies
from a given set of chords. All does bands
like the Ramones and Helmet one better by
not seeming repetitive, but at the same time
establishing a distinct style. Finally, Chad
Price's well-carrying voice is a plus, an im
provement over the tinny vocals of his prede
cessor, Scott Reynolds.
The first half's tracks are ace, such as the
introspective "Original Me" ("When you
pretend to laugh, the reflection I see reminds
me of somebody like me") and "Right," an
ode to the perfect relationship. "Right" is an
especially praiseworthy song, because it pre
sents love in an unusual power pop fashion

that escapes the mushy and overly sentimen
tal overtones that afflict other romantic dis
courses.
An All album would not be complete
without some slightly vulgar humor and vi
gnettes such as "Strip Bar" (a whopping nine
seconds long) and "Bail" (not much longer)
show that All hasn't lost their touch. But this
element is most prevalent in "Rosco," a tale
of guys with fast cars who get a kick out of
outracing others but who have no destina
tion. The full-throttle guitar-revving in
"Rosco" puts the listener right in front of the
wheel, and you can actually feel the speed
with the wind blowing right in your face.
The two heavier songs near the album's
end are not as stellar. "Crucified" is an indi
cation of All's failure to connect when they
drift away from their catchy formula. And the
ignorance of the end piece "Politics" ("Keep
your politics out of my way") inflicts bad
memories of Axl Rose's inappropriate dia
tribe "One in a Million."
But all for all (no pun intended), 12 nice
tracks out of 14 is a worthy album and a sub
stantial improvement on All's last release
"Percolator." The maturity of All's offerings
show that this is no "instant" offering — it's
cafe au lait.
