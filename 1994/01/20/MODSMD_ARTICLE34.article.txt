# In sickness and in health
## The 						marvels of 'Marvin's Room 
### Kimberly Chrisman 
Pr oving that laughter Is indeed the brsf
medicine — and sometimes the only
medicine — "Marvin's Room," now
playing at the elegant Mountain View Center
for the Performing Arts, comically dissects
the politics of health and family life in con
temporary America.
Bessie (Ginger Drake) has spent most of
her adult life caring for Marvin (Gregory
Genna), her dying father — "He's been
dying for about 20 years," she admits — and
a half-crippled aunt (Miriam Babin) whose
electronic anesthetizer also makes the garage
door open and close.
When the tireless caregiver is unwillingly
and unexpectedly thrust into the role of pa
tient, the entire family undergoes radical role
reversals. Everyone in "Marvin's Room" is
looking for a cure of some sort, and the only
predictable element in this off-beat comedy
is that the characters will find healing in the
least expected places.
Bessie, for example, finds an unlikely soul
mate in Hank (David Scott), her teenage
nephew, recently released from a mental in
stitution. (His overbearing mother, por
trayed by Mary Knoll, prefers the term
"loony bin" — it shows she has a sense of
humor about it.)
But, for all their traumas, there's nothing
depressing about these people. Even the
bedridden, near-catatonic title character de
lights in the simple pleasures left to him —

bouncing light off a mirror, sucking on
Yahtzee dice. Bessie is, if anything, over-opti
mistic. The focus is not on dying, but on
those things that make life worth living.
Like humor. The opening scene, set in a
cockroach-ridden examining room, triggers

a chain reaction of running jokes and double
entendres, tracing a fine line between absur
dism and black comedy. The uniformly
strong cast, directed by Amy Glazer, plays it
strictly for laughs, with infectious enthusi
asm and a collective sense of timing.

John Wilson's sterile, modular set serves as
both home and hospital, alternately morph
ing into a doctor's office, a nursing home, a
psychiatric ward, and finally, improbably,
Disney World. It's somehow fitting that this
theatrical tour of the antiseptic waiting
rooms of death should end up in the happiest
place on earth.
"Marvin's Room" has been hailed as an
AIDS metaphor, but it's much more than
that. It's a play about how families cope with
illness — and with each other. And, in an era
when health care is a political issue, when
more and more people are taking care of each
other in the loneliness of their own homes,
it's both a cry for compassion and a call to ac
tion.
The fact that McPherson died of AIDS in
1992 underscores the play's poignancy.
"Marvin's Room," which won top Drama
Desk honors, was only his second play; how
many more might he have written by this
time, had he lived?
"Marvin's Room" conveys a heartfelt mes
sage without being preachy or sentimental, in
language as squeaky-clean as its sanitized set
tings. It's a show you can (and should) take
your parents and grandparents to — you'll
enjoy it every bit as much as they will.
"I can't imagine a better way to have spent
my life," Bessie says of her self-sacrifice. And
I can't imagine a better way to spend an
evening in Mountain View. ■
