A Dangerous Woman
Stricken by some nameless mental
disability, Martha Horgan alienates
the town with her inappropriate ac
tions. Her screwy relationships with
her aunt and a shmarmy drunk lead
to frequent sex scenes, an implausi
bly violent act and, sadly, boredom

More disturbing is the persistent use
of stereotypes of the disabled and
the constant blurring of the lines be
tween sex and rape R
Heaven and Earth
Oliver Stone's latest brilliant creation
- the true story of a Vietnamese
woman who worked for the Vietcong
before violence turned her away —
stands out among Vietnam films be
cause of its emphasis on the Viet
namese perspective Newcomer
Hiep Thi Le and veteran Tommy Lee
Jones deliver poignant perfor
mances which reflect the pain of
their characters' lives and the rav
ages and insanity of the war R
Mrs. Doubtfire
Without Robin Williams, this film
would be just another boy-dresses
as-girl-flick. He carries it just barely
into the land of almost-innovative
entertainment — with a serious
message hidden below the surface
With adequate support from the rest
of the cast (Sally Field, Pierce Bros
nan), Williams' first self-produced
flick deals with parenthood and di
vorce while always keeping one
hand on the funny bone PG-13
The Pelican Brief
Picture Julia Roberts She could al
most pass for your average law stu

dent — the kind who uncovers the
devious conspiracy behind the
deaths of two Supreme Court jus
tices. But this premise is no more
believable in Alan J Pakula's film
"The Pelican Brief" than it is in John
Grisham's bestselling novel. No one
can accuse Pakula of original ideas;
every scene of the movie is lifted al
most verbatim from the novel. In
stead of watching the "Great Julia
Roberts Comeback," order out for a
slice of "Mystic Pizza." PG-13
A Perfect World
Relative unknown T.J. Lowther car
ries the day in this star-studded
(Kevin Costner, Clint Eastwood) tale
of personal growth and transforma
tion. Beginning with the kidnapping
of a 7-year-old by a pair of just-es
caped convicts and continuing with
the predictable manhunt, "A Perfect
World" is truly a story of relation
ships — good and evil, criminal and
lawman and, most importantly, adult
and child. PG-13
Philadelphia
The first major industry film about
AIDS, "Philadelphia" does not deny
the existence of either gay men or
homophobes. Instead it places
polar opposites in close proximity,
watching their reactions while not
whitewashing their differences.

Bringing Denzel Washington and
Tom Hanks together and exposing
homophobia to the public's scrutiny
lift the film above the level of mere
PC-rhetoric. PG-13
The Piano
The prize piece from Cannes sings
with a masterful tale of beauty and
beasts. Exploring the sexual under
tones to the myth that the Disney
film could only hint at, Jane Campi
on proves her worth as a writer and
director while coloring the rough
grays between good and evil R
Schindler's List
The haunting images of Steven
Spielberg's "Schindler's List" over
come the film's characters, leaving
moments more important than peo
ple. The story of German entepre
neur Oskar Schindler and the more
than 1,100 Jews he saves leads to
an examination of the many faces of
evil in the Nazi regime With indeli
ble pictures of death and degrada
tion burned in black-and-white film,
"Schindler's List" captures the truth
of more than six million murders R
Shadowlands
Capturing the contradictory nature
of C.S. Lewis — a famous scholar
who lives in seclusion and a chil
dren's author who knows no chil-

dren — is the task of Anthony Hop
kins. "Shadowlands" is the tale of
what happens to Lewis' well-or
dered life after the entrance of loud
mouthed American poet Joy Gre
sham. Ultimately a conventional love
story, "Shadowlands" does find a bit
of musty magic along the way. PG
The Summer House
A kind of working-class "A Room
With a View," "The Summer House"
warms your heart with its tale of a
distressed English girl engaged to
marry an annoying, unpleasant
man. Although the story starts out
awkward and cliched, it eventually
becomes an interesting, multi-di
mensional about love and free
choice. UNRATED
Six Degrees of Separation
This adaptation of John Guare's crit
ically celebrated play "Six Degrees
of Separation" spins out a limitless
line of deception as a young black
man brings a neck tie, a knife wound
and a bag of lies into the world of the
wealthy. But under the placid face of
tall tales lies a complicated, home
less. homosexual drifter. Unfortu
nately, the film does not live up to its
potential in discussing race and
class issues, but it's more than en
tertaining in its demonstration of the
nothingness of purposeless life R

stead of watching the "Great Julia
Roberts Comeback," order out for a
slice of "Mystic Pizza." PG-13
A Perfect World
Relative unknown T.J. Lowther car
ries the day in this star-studded
(Kevin Costner, Clint Eastwood) tale
of personal growth and transforma
tion. Beginning with the kidnapping
of a 7-year-old by a pair of just-es
caped convicts and continuing with
the predictable manhunt, "A Perfect
World" is truly a story of relation
ships — good and evil, criminal and
lawman and, most importantly, adult
and child. PG-13
Philadelphia
The first major industry film about
AIDS, "Philadelphia" does not deny
the existence of either gay men or
homophobes. Instead it places
polar opposites in close proximity,
watching their reactions while not
whitewashing their differences.

Bringing Denzel Washington and
Tom Hanks together and exposing
homophobia to the public's scrutiny
lift the film above the level of mere
PC-rhetoric. PG-13
The Piano
The prize piece from Cannes sings
with a masterful tale of beauty and
beasts. Exploring the sexual under
tones to the myth that the Disney
film could only hint at, Jane Campi
on proves her worth as a writer and
director while coloring the rough
grays between good and evil R
Schindler's List
The haunting images of Steven
Spielberg's "Schindler's List" over
come the film's characters, leaving
moments more important than peo
ple. The story of German entepre
neur Oskar Schindler and the more
than 1,100 Jews he saves leads to
an examination of the many faces of
evil in the Nazi regime With indeli
ble pictures of death and degrada
tion burned in black-and-white film,
"Schindler's List" captures the truth
of more than six million murders R
Shadowlands
Capturing the contradictory nature
of C.S. Lewis — a famous scholar
who lives in seclusion and a chil
dren's author who knows no chil-

dren — is the task of Anthony Hop
kins. "Shadowlands" is the tale of
what happens to Lewis' well-or
dered life after the entrance of loud
mouthed American poet Joy Gre
sham. Ultimately a conventional love
story, "Shadowlands" does find a bit
of musty magic along the way. PG
The Summer House
A kind of working-class "A Room
With a View," "The Summer House"
warms your heart with its tale of a
distressed English girl engaged to
marry an annoying, unpleasant
man. Although the story starts out
awkward and cliched, it eventually
becomes an interesting, multi-di
mensional about love and free
choice. UNRATED
Six Degrees of Separation
This adaptation of John Guare's crit
ically celebrated play "Six Degrees
of Separation" spins out a limitless
line of deception as a young black
man brings a neck tie, a knife wound
and a bag of lies into the world of the
wealthy. But under the placid face of
tall tales lies a complicated, home
less. homosexual drifter. Unfortu
nately, the film does not live up to its
potential in discussing race and
class issues, but it's more than en
tertaining in its demonstration of the
nothingness of purposeless life R
