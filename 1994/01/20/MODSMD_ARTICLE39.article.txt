What's the opposite of a CIV
course reader, an Engineering text
and a calculus problem set com
bined? "Spaceballs," of course.
There are sometimes when we
just have to remember how to
make fun of ourselves and the
world we live in. A Mel Brooks
take-off on the movie that almost

everyone at Stanford has
seen at least once (or 10

times or 20 0r...), "Space
balls" makes mincemeat out of
the drama, action and adventure
of "Star Wars."
With Mel Brooks, John Candy,
Rick Moranis, et al. in one of their
funniest sagas, "Spaceballs" paro
dies like few other films (most of
which have the same cast) can.
Brooks' Yogurt is only one of

many memorable take-offs on
other movie characters, while the
scene in which the bad guys cap
ture the stunt doubles is truly un
forgettable.
While some of the material
might go over the heads of those
young and innocent, Stanford
students are rarely either. Thus,
rent "Spaceballs" and relieve your
academic drudgery.
