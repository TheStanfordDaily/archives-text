# Film to explore East Palo Alto history
## Video aims to paint more accurate picture of the city 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Though East Palo Alto is just five
minutes away from campus, many mem
bers of the University are largely unfa
miliar with the city's history or the peo
ple who live there. Hut a current cooper
ative project aimed at increasing com
munication and artistic exchange be
tween the two communities is bent on
bridging this information gap.
Sponsored by the Committee on
Black Performing Arts (CBPA), the East
Palo Alto Project — a collaboration be
tween Stanford students and faculty and
East Palo Alto residents — is producing
a 30-minute video on the city's past and
the issues facing the community today.
The film, scheduled for completion in

March, will bo available for educational
use and general viewing both in East
Palo Alto and at Stanford.
In addition, two professional play
wrights, Charles Gordon and Cherrie
Moraga, will use the research from the
video to write two one-act plays for per
formance in November 1995. Gordon
will be in residency at Stanford this
spring, while Moraga will be on campus
this fall.
Using information obtained from
archival research and the oral histories
of first- and second-generation towns
people, the video will explore the little
known history of East Palo Alto.
The video will look at the area's early
days as the home of (he Ohlone Tribe, at
its Utopian agricultural colony in the
19205, at its equal education movement

of the 1960s and at the current issues
facing the city. Interviews with local res
idents of all generations will be inter
spersed throughout the video.
Work on the project began this sum
mer and is about one-third complete,
said project program administrator
Elena Becks. The project received some
funding from the University's Academic
Software Development program, but
more fundraising efforts are currently
underway.
According to Assoc. Drama Prof.
Harry Elam, director of the CBPA, the
video will "be a wonderful resource for
the playwrights" and for student groups
who volunteer in East Palo Alto.
Organizers said the video will have
other beneficial uses as well. "The
community can use it to look at
itself and how it represents itself as
opposed to how it has been recently
portrayed in the media," Elam said.
Becks, a lifelong East Palo Alto
resident, said the film could help
people from both the Stanford and
East Palo Alto communities to "gain
some insight into the nature of our
relationship with each other."
"It will give people a fresh,
broader look at East Palo Alto,"

said Harry Levin, the producer of
the video. "It's presenting a whole
other way of looking at the com
munity."
Organizers hope that the video
will help dispel some unflattering
images about East Palo Alto.
"We have a long history in East
Palo Alto and I think that a lot of
people have a particular perception
of East Palo Alto," Becks said. "One
of our hopes is to show people how
unique East Palo Alto really is."
"It will be helpful for students
here on campus to know more
about East Palo Alto," said junior
Juan Ibarra, who conducted inter
views for the fdm. "|They| have

certain stereotypes about it, such
as the high crime . . . many of
those I stereotypes) are not very
legitimate."
Ibarra interviewed about 12
Spanish-speaking families, asking
them questions about issues fac
ing the community and their tran
sition from Mexico and Central
American countries to America.
He said he hopes that the video
will cause an increase in the num
ber of Stanford students who vol
unteer in East Palo Alto.
"Hopefully, more students will
become a mentor or get involved
in other volunteer activities,"
Ibarra said.
