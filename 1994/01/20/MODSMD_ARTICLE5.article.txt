Though East Palo Alto is just five
minutes away from campus, many mem
bers of the University are largely unfa
miliar with the city's history or the peo
ple who live there. Hut a current cooper
ative project aimed at increasing com
munication and artistic exchange be
tween the two communities is bent on
bridging this information gap.
Sponsored by the Committee on
Black Performing Arts (CBPA), the East
Palo Alto Project — a collaboration be
tween Stanford students and faculty and
East Palo Alto residents — is producing
a 30-minute video on the city's past and
the issues facing the community today.
The film, scheduled for completion in

March, will bo available for educational
use and general viewing both in East
Palo Alto and at Stanford.
In addition, two professional play
wrights, Charles Gordon and Cherrie
Moraga, will use the research from the
video to write two one-act plays for per
formance in November 1995. Gordon
will be in residency at Stanford this
spring, while Moraga will be on campus
this fall.
Using information obtained from
archival research and the oral histories
of first- and second-generation towns
people, the video will explore the little
known history of East Palo Alto.
The video will look at the area's early
days as the home of (he Ohlone Tribe, at
its Utopian agricultural colony in the
19205, at its equal education movement

of the 1960s and at the current issues
facing the city. Interviews with local res
idents of all generations will be inter
spersed throughout the video.
Work on the project began this sum
mer and is about one-third complete,
said project program administrator
Elena Becks. The project received some
funding from the University's Academic
Software Development program, but
more fundraising efforts are currently
underway.
According to Assoc. Drama Prof.
Harry Elam, director of the CBPA, the
video will "be a wonderful resource for
the playwrights" and for student groups
who volunteer in East Palo Alto.
Organizers said the video will have
