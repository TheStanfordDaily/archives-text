# Plan would slash size of ASSU Senate
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Students may vote as early as next month on an
amendment to the ASSU Constitution that would at
least halve the size of the ASSU Senate and alter its
representative makeup.
The plan — unveiled by undergraduate senator
Gabe Lucas last night — would change the makeup of
the present senate, which includes 20 voting senators
and 20 alternates, elected at large. The proposal
would decrease the number of senators and create
voting districts, but Lucas has not yet put forth the
specifics on either change.
The proposal will most likely be discussed by the
senate within the next three weeks. If approved by a
two-thirds majority of senators, the amendment will
go to the student body for a vote. A two-thirds major
ity of students would be required in a student
plebiscite to make it ASSU law.
If the senate does not vote the amendment onto
the ballot, a petition signed by 5 percent of the stu
dent body can still place the amendment on the ballot
for the next ASSU general election. If 15 percent of
students sign a petition, the amendment can go to a
special election.
If approved by two-thirds of the student body, the
amendment then goes to the University Board of
Trustees for approval before becoming ASSU law.
"I'm hoping to have a special election sometime in
February to ratify the amendment," Lucas said.
But Lucas' desire to put the matter to a quick vote
has left some senators wondering whether more stu
dent input should have been included in the process of
drafting the proposal.
"The plan is being conducted in secret by a cabal of
undergraduates," said graduate senator Neil Crellin.
"If the plan is to increase accountability, where's the
accountability in their back-room meetings?"
Crellin also objected to the lack of information
about the plan's development. "I haven't seen the
proposal," he said. "They're talking about havingthis
on the ballot in under a month but no one's properly
discussed whether (the amendment) is fair."
But Lucas maintained that student input is one of
the foundations of the plan. He said that "students
had a lot of input through the Leadership Summit," a
conference for student group leaders held by the
ASSU last fall.
Council of Presidents member Ron Brown agreed
with Lucas, saying that "one of the things we consis
tently heard in the Leadership Summit was the sen
ate was too large for [students] to feel their represen
tatives were really doing anything.
"A lot of them felt that a smaller senate would
make (senators) more accountable," he added.
In addition, Lucas said he hopes to solicit student
