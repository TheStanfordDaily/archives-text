# Plan would slash size of ASSU Senate
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Students may vote as early as next month on an
amendment to the ASSU Constitution that would at
least halve the size of the ASSU Senate and alter its
representative makeup.
The plan — unveiled by undergraduate senator
Gabe Lucas last night — would change the makeup of
the present senate, which includes 20 voting senators
and 20 alternates, elected at large. The proposal
would decrease the number of senators and create
voting districts, but Lucas has not yet put forth the
specifics on either change.
The proposal will most likely be discussed by the
senate within the next three weeks. If approved by a
two-thirds majority of senators, the amendment will
go to the student body for a vote. A two-thirds major
ity of students would be required in a student
plebiscite to make it ASSU law.
If the senate does not vote the amendment onto
the ballot, a petition signed by 5 percent of the stu
dent body can still place the amendment on the ballot
for the next ASSU general election. If 15 percent of
students sign a petition, the amendment can go to a
special election.
If approved by two-thirds of the student body, the
amendment then goes to the University Board of
Trustees for approval before becoming ASSU law.
"I'm hoping to have a special election sometime in
February to ratify the amendment," Lucas said.
But Lucas' desire to put the matter to a quick vote
has left some senators wondering whether more stu
dent input should have been included in the process of
drafting the proposal.
"The plan is being conducted in secret by a cabal of
undergraduates," said graduate senator Neil Crellin.
"If the plan is to increase accountability, where's the
accountability in their back-room meetings?"
Crellin also objected to the lack of information
about the plan's development. "I haven't seen the
proposal," he said. "They're talking about havingthis
on the ballot in under a month but no one's properly
discussed whether (the amendment) is fair."
But Lucas maintained that student input is one of
the foundations of the plan. He said that "students
had a lot of input through the Leadership Summit," a
conference for student group leaders held by the
ASSU last fall.
Council of Presidents member Ron Brown agreed
with Lucas, saying that "one of the things we consis
tently heard in the Leadership Summit was the sen
ate was too large for [students] to feel their represen
tatives were really doing anything.
"A lot of them felt that a smaller senate would
make (senators) more accountable," he added.
In addition, Lucas said he hopes to solicit student
input by bringing the amendment
up at next Wednesday's ASSU
town hall meeting.
"Finally we're telling the stu
dents, 'We hear you and we're
going to do something about the
senate's problems,' " he said.
Lucas said he also plans to meet
with leaders within and outside of
the senate to hammer out the
details of the amendment. He sug
gested that the plan could be
expanded to include, for example, a
proposal that would establish one
of the COP members as chair of the
senate.
But some senate leaders were
skeptical about the plan's potential
for truly improving the ASSU.
Graduate senator Sanford Dicker!
argued that a reorganization of the
senate will not solve all its prob
lems.
"Gabe's bill might improve the
number of members on the sen
ate," he said. "But unless he gets to
the root cause of why the senate
has been ineffectual, size of the
senate does not matter."

According to Dickert, senators
often prioritize other activities
ahead of the ASSU, reducing their
commitment to student govern
ment.
"Under I Lucas') plan, there are
half as many people empowered as
senators to address issues that
come up," he said. "Having 40 sen
ators gives students a base of talent
for students to utilize when prob
lems arise."
Lucas' proposal that the elec
torate be splintered into districts
also raised questions about
specifics.
"We still have not come up with
the exact numbers of senators and
we do not know exactly how the dis
tricting will work," Lucas conceded,
adding that geographical and class
based districts are both under con
sideration.
"Districts will allow students
direct access to the senate," he
said. "The senators will be able to
represent you as an individual seg
ment of the community."
Currently, the proposal would
allow the senate to decide on the
specifics of the districting at a later
time. "We don't want to set forth poli
cies that might not apply in four years
when you have completely new stu

dents," Lucas explained. "Right now,
the constitution does not allow much
flexibility."
While supportive of the general
concept of districts, Senate Chair
Greg Waldorf took issue with the
flexibility of Lucas' districting pro
posal. "I'd like to get as close to pos
sible to a situation where every
Stanford student knows who their
representative is in the senate," he
said. "But I feel the districting
mechanism should be set forth in
the constitution — this would allow
the senate to make changes on a
periodic basis."
Crellin echoed Waldorfs objec
tions. "People have been discussing
a more accountable ASSU for
years.. . . Districting has been one
of the ways that's commonly pro
posed," he said. "But how do you
district?"
Despite objections to the propos
al's content, Brown supported
Lucas' ideas. "Gabe has shown a
lot of work in sifting through all
the constitution and bylaws,"
Brown said.
"He has considered a lot of input
to figure how to make the ASSU let
ter," he said. "This amendment rep
resents a step in an ongoing process
of improvement."

"Gabe's bill might improve the
number of members on the sen
ate," he said. "But unless he gets to
the root cause of why the senate
has been ineffectual, size of the
senate does not matter."

According to Dickert, senators
often prioritize other activities
ahead of the ASSU, reducing their
commitment to student govern
ment.
"Under I Lucas') plan, there are
half as many people empowered as
senators to address issues that
come up," he said. "Having 40 sen
ators gives students a base of talent
for students to utilize when prob
lems arise."
Lucas' proposal that the elec
torate be splintered into districts
also raised questions about
specifics.
"We still have not come up with
the exact numbers of senators and
we do not know exactly how the dis
tricting will work," Lucas conceded,
adding that geographical and class
based districts are both under con
sideration.
"Districts will allow students
direct access to the senate," he
said. "The senators will be able to
represent you as an individual seg
ment of the community."
Currently, the proposal would
allow the senate to decide on the
specifics of the districting at a later
time. "We don't want to set forth poli
cies that might not apply in four years
when you have completely new stu

dents," Lucas explained. "Right now,
the constitution does not allow much
flexibility."
While supportive of the general
concept of districts, Senate Chair
Greg Waldorf took issue with the
flexibility of Lucas' districting pro
posal. "I'd like to get as close to pos
sible to a situation where every
Stanford student knows who their
representative is in the senate," he
said. "But I feel the districting
mechanism should be set forth in
the constitution — this would allow
the senate to make changes on a
periodic basis."
Crellin echoed Waldorfs objec
tions. "People have been discussing
a more accountable ASSU for
years.. . . Districting has been one
of the ways that's commonly pro
posed," he said. "But how do you
district?"
Despite objections to the propos
al's content, Brown supported
Lucas' ideas. "Gabe has shown a
lot of work in sifting through all
the constitution and bylaws,"
Brown said.
"He has considered a lot of input
to figure how to make the ASSU let
ter," he said. "This amendment rep
resents a step in an ongoing process
of improvement."
Students may vote as early as next month on an
amendment to the ASSU Constitution that would at
least halve the size of the ASSU Senate and alter its
representative makeup.
The plan — unveiled by undergraduate senator
Gabe Lucas last night — would change the makeup of
the present senate, which includes 20 voting senators
and 20 alternates, elected at large. The proposal
would decrease the number of senators and create
voting districts, but Lucas has not yet put forth the
specifics on either change.
The proposal will most likely be discussed by the
senate within the next three weeks. If approved by a
two-thirds majority of senators, the amendment will
go to the student body for a vote. A two-thirds major
ity of students would be required in a student
plebiscite to make it ASSU law.
If the senate does not vote the amendment onto
the ballot, a petition signed by 5 percent of the stu
dent body can still place the amendment on the ballot
for the next ASSU general election. If 15 percent of
students sign a petition, the amendment can go to a
special election.
If approved by two-thirds of the student body, the
amendment then goes to the University Board of
Trustees for approval before becoming ASSU law.
"I'm hoping to have a special election sometime in
February to ratify the amendment," Lucas said.
But Lucas' desire to put the matter to a quick vote
has left some senators wondering whether more stu
dent input should have been included in the process of
drafting the proposal.
"The plan is being conducted in secret by a cabal of
undergraduates," said graduate senator Neil Crellin.
"If the plan is to increase accountability, where's the
accountability in their back-room meetings?"
Crellin also objected to the lack of information
about the plan's development. "I haven't seen the
proposal," he said. "They're talking about havingthis
on the ballot in under a month but no one's properly
discussed whether (the amendment) is fair."
But Lucas maintained that student input is one of
the foundations of the plan. He said that "students
had a lot of input through the Leadership Summit," a
conference for student group leaders held by the
ASSU last fall.
Council of Presidents member Ron Brown agreed
with Lucas, saying that "one of the things we consis
tently heard in the Leadership Summit was the sen
ate was too large for [students] to feel their represen
tatives were really doing anything.
"A lot of them felt that a smaller senate would
make (senators) more accountable," he added.
In addition, Lucas said he hopes to solicit student
input by bringing the amendment
up at next Wednesday's ASSU
town hall meeting.
"Finally we're telling the stu
dents, 'We hear you and we're
going to do something about the
senate's problems,' " he said.
Lucas said he also plans to meet
with leaders within and outside of
the senate to hammer out the
details of the amendment. He sug
gested that the plan could be
expanded to include, for example, a
proposal that would establish one
of the COP members as chair of the
senate.
But some senate leaders were
skeptical about the plan's potential
for truly improving the ASSU.
Graduate senator Sanford Dicker!
argued that a reorganization of the
senate will not solve all its prob
lems.
"Gabe's bill might improve the
number of members on the sen
ate," he said. "But unless he gets to
the root cause of why the senate
has been ineffectual, size of the
senate does not matter."

According to Dickert, senators
often prioritize other activities
ahead of the ASSU, reducing their
