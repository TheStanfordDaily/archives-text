Michael Murphy runs a retreat cen
ter where visitors come to bathe in the
"clothing optional" hot springs, learn
about the massage technique "rolfing"
and see the place where legendary
Gestalt therapy guru Frederick Perls
spanked Rita Hayworth.
Oh, the places you'll with a Stan
ford degree.
Located near Big Sur and founded
by Stanford graduate Murphy, the
Esalen Institute has been drawing an
eclectic group of scholars and seekers
since 1961.
The institute is a non-profit health
and educational organization where
visitors attend self-actualization work
shops, learn about homeopathic medi
cine and take part in 450 other pro
grams all designed to "develop the
human potential," Murphy said.
About 10,000 people, hailing from
all parts of the globe, visit Esalen each
year. Most take weekend programs or
five-day programs. Each of the diverse
programs share an emphasis on the
process of self-discovery physically,
emotionally, mentally and spiritually,
he added.
Murphy, the chair as well as co
founder of Esalen, calls the institute a
"social invention" that led to the cre
ation of more than 200 similar institu
tions worldwide.
"We only live a small part of our
human potential," Murphy said.
"Esalen is about the study of the
greater human potential that can be
reached."
Many interesting people have come

to study at Esalen. In the late 19605,
there was a large concentration of
artists at the institute, Murphy said.
And, drawn by the artists, many per
formers likt 1 Hob Dylan and Simon and
Garfunkel played at folk festivals near
the institute, he remembered.
"The '60s were really colorful,"
Murphy said "We will never see that
again. It was too much for the culture."
While Murphy said he believes that
people still linger on Esalen's '60s rep

utation, he maintains that Esalen is
definitely not a "hippie thing," adding
that a wide variety of people have since
visited the institute including Aldous
Huxley, Arnold Toynbee and Linus
Pauling.
While the customers vary. Murphy
said that over the past 32 years the
basic themes of the institute have re
mained the same, though the quality
