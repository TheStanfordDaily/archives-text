# Rolfing their way to self-fulfillment
## Stanford grad directs Big Sur health institute 
### Jo Marshall 
Michael Murphy runs a retreat cen
ter where visitors come to bathe in the
"clothing optional" hot springs, learn
about the massage technique "rolfing"
and see the place where legendary
Gestalt therapy guru Frederick Perls
spanked Rita Hayworth.
Oh, the places you'll with a Stan
ford degree.
Located near Big Sur and founded
by Stanford graduate Murphy, the
Esalen Institute has been drawing an
eclectic group of scholars and seekers
since 1961.
The institute is a non-profit health
and educational organization where
visitors attend self-actualization work
shops, learn about homeopathic medi
cine and take part in 450 other pro
grams all designed to "develop the
human potential," Murphy said.
About 10,000 people, hailing from
all parts of the globe, visit Esalen each
year. Most take weekend programs or
five-day programs. Each of the diverse
programs share an emphasis on the
process of self-discovery physically,
emotionally, mentally and spiritually,
he added.
Murphy, the chair as well as co
founder of Esalen, calls the institute a
"social invention" that led to the cre
ation of more than 200 similar institu
tions worldwide.
"We only live a small part of our
human potential," Murphy said.
"Esalen is about the study of the
greater human potential that can be
reached."
Many interesting people have come

to study at Esalen. In the late 19605,
there was a large concentration of
artists at the institute, Murphy said.
And, drawn by the artists, many per
formers likt 1 Hob Dylan and Simon and
Garfunkel played at folk festivals near
the institute, he remembered.
"The '60s were really colorful,"
Murphy said "We will never see that
again. It was too much for the culture."
While Murphy said he believes that
people still linger on Esalen's '60s rep

utation, he maintains that Esalen is
definitely not a "hippie thing," adding
that a wide variety of people have since
visited the institute including Aldous
Huxley, Arnold Toynbee and Linus
Pauling.
While the customers vary. Murphy
said that over the past 32 years the
basic themes of the institute have re
mained the same, though the quality

has improved.
"It is a developing place with
all sorts of plans for new pro
grams," he said.
In general, Esalen strives for a
European mind-set, since "Euro
peans are typically Bohemian and
avant-garde whereas Americans
are very puritanical and make a
big deal about sexual issues,"
Murphy said.
"There has been a lot of con
troversy about the hot spring
baths," Murphy remembers.
"And for a time we tried to have
rules for separate sides for men
and women, but that kept break
ing down so I just let it go."

But how did the guru move
from the Farm to his haven? Mur

phy said he was drawn as an under
graduate to Stanford's large collec
tion of material on Eastern philos
ophy and psychic research. He
studied philosophy and psychology
under mentor Frederic Spiegel
berg, a professor of comparative
religion and Eastern philosophy.
"He opened the doors of phi
losophy and psychology to me and
started me on the voyage of dis
covery," Murphy said.
After graduating from Stanford
in 1952 and spending two years in
the army in Puerto Rico, Murphy
spent time in an ashram in India
before returning to Palo Alto.
It wasn't until 1958 that the
idea of the retreat in Big Sur
dawned on him, Murphy said. His
grandmother had invested in real
estate and owned two miles of
property along Big Sur, where
EsaJen Institute is now located.
"It was a combination of ideas

and the property that my grand
mother presented me with" that
motivated Murphy to found the
institute. And four years later,
with the help of his former class
mate Richard Price, his vision
was realized.
In addition to that novel, Mur
phy has published two other nov
els and two non-fiction works.
The most recent — "The Future
of the Body" — deals with what
Murphy calls his quest for the ful
fillment of human potential.
And Murphy is not done creat
ing. Presently, Murphy is work
ing with his colleague George
Leonard to create a day center in
Marin County, since Esalen is pri
marily a retreat center. The
Marin center would have aspects
of a school and aspects of a health
club where people could come and
visit on a daily basis, Murphy
said.

springs, it has attracted visitors ranging from Rita Hayworth to Aldous Huxley.
has improved.
"It is a developing place with
all sorts of plans for new pro
grams," he said.
In general, Esalen strives for a
European mind-set, since "Euro
peans are typically Bohemian and
avant-garde whereas Americans
are very puritanical and make a
big deal about sexual issues,"
Murphy said.
"There has been a lot of con
troversy about the hot spring
baths," Murphy remembers.
"And for a time we tried to have
rules for separate sides for men
and women, but that kept break
ing down so I just let it go."

But how did the guru move
from the Farm to his haven? Mur

phy said he was drawn as an under
graduate to Stanford's large collec
tion of material on Eastern philos
ophy and psychic research. He
studied philosophy and psychology
under mentor Frederic Spiegel
berg, a professor of comparative
religion and Eastern philosophy.
"He opened the doors of phi
losophy and psychology to me and
started me on the voyage of dis
covery," Murphy said.
After graduating from Stanford
in 1952 and spending two years in
the army in Puerto Rico, Murphy
spent time in an ashram in India
before returning to Palo Alto.
It wasn't until 1958 that the
idea of the retreat in Big Sur
dawned on him, Murphy said. His
grandmother had invested in real
estate and owned two miles of
property along Big Sur, where
EsaJen Institute is now located.
"It was a combination of ideas

and the property that my grand
mother presented me with" that
motivated Murphy to found the
institute. And four years later,
with the help of his former class
mate Richard Price, his vision
was realized.
In addition to that novel, Mur
phy has published two other nov
els and two non-fiction works.
The most recent — "The Future
of the Body" — deals with what
Murphy calls his quest for the ful
fillment of human potential.
And Murphy is not done creat
ing. Presently, Murphy is work
ing with his colleague George
Leonard to create a day center in
Marin County, since Esalen is pri
marily a retreat center. The
Marin center would have aspects
of a school and aspects of a health
club where people could come and
visit on a daily basis, Murphy
said.
