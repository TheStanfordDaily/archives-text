ing to do with the attack.

sachusetts but could not be carried out
until Jan. 6 at the U.S. Figure Skating
Championships in Detroit.
"Tonya categorically denies those alle
gations," said Harding's attorney, Den
nis Rawlinson.
"I am innocent, and I continue to
believe that Jeff is innocent of any wrong
doing. I wish him nothing but the best, but
I believe during this crucial time of prepa

centrate my attention on my training,"
Harding said.
