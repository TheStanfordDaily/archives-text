LUCKY FOR YOU
Eliza D. Watt was one of the 12 founders of Royal
Neighbors of America in 1895. They founded the
fraternal life insurance society to protect families
throughout their lives, while offering a helping hand
to communities in need.
Times have changed over the last 100 years,
and so has RNA. But they have stuck strenuously to
the philosophy originated by Eliza D. Watt and her
11 co-founders. That philosophy inspired RNA to
create special family-oriented programs, like a
college scholarship program, the Newborn Benefit,
the Orphan Benefit and an elegant retirement home
for older RNA members.
With RNA you'll have your insurance coverage
and your annuities. But you'll also have an
extended family that is looking out for you through
out your life. That was Eliza D. Watt's vision — and
it's alive and well today.
