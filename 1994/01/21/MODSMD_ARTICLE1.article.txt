# 'It all feels real good right now'
## Cardinal hoops trounces Bears 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
Despite four players in foul
trouble and a 13-point Stanford
lead gone the way of the Edsel,
the Cardinal men's basketball
team played like the postseason
caliber team that California is
supposed to be, defeating the
Golden Bears 88-79 before a
sellout crowd at Maples Pavil
ion last night.
"Every time Cal made a run,
we bounced back," said Stan
ford head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "We matched the big
shots that they made. This was
clearly the best we've played as
far as shooting the ball."
The Cardinal (10-4, 3-2 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) hit a sea
son-high nine three-pointers last
night, and it was three clutch
three-pointers late in the game
which sealed the Stanford win.
Cal (10-4, 3-2) clawed back
from a 51-38 defecit early in the
second half, Liking its largest lead
of the period at 69-65 with 5:48 to
go on a Jason Kidd three-pointer.
Not to worry, according to
Stanford forward Andy Poppink.
"Even though they went on a
bit of a run, I don't think any of
us panicked," said Poppink, who
finished with a career-high 25
points. "I felt pretty good about
what was going on out there."
So did Stanford guard Brevin
Knight. Knight entered the game
shooting less than 20 percent
from three-point land. With the
Cardinal down 70-69 and 3:20 on

the clock, Knight confidently let fly a 21-
footer.
Nothing but net.
"If I'm nervous, I don't belong here,"
Knight said. "I'll always shoot it if I'm
open."
A minute later, Knight was at it again,
giving the Cardinal a seemingly-comfort
able 76-70 edge with his third three
pointer of the ballgame.
"If Brevin can do that (all of the time),
he'll be really something," Montgomery
said. "Those were a couple of clutch
shots."
But Cal, sparked by a Kidd three-point
play, whittled the Stanford lead to 78-77
with 1:09 to play.
Enter Dion Cross. Cross, the Pac-10
leader in three-point shooting, had
missed an open three at the 2:30 mark.
Two times proved to be a charm for the
sophomore, who put the Cardinal up by
an 81-77 mark with a three-pointer.
"I knew I had to hit that shot," Cross
said. "I was surprised to be that open the

first time."
A pair of Poppink foul shots with 37
seconds left to play gave Stanford an 83-
77 edge. Knight, who finished with 17
points, sealed the win with a layup 10 sec
onds later.
Lost in the game were impressive per
formances by Cal big guns Kidd and Lam
ond Murray. Kidd set a school record with
18 assists, while Murray tied a career high
with 15 rebounds.
"It all feels real good right now," said
Cardinal forward Brent Williams.
Williams, the lone senior in Stanford's
starting unit, had a monster game of his
own, finishing with '20 points and 13
boards. More importantly, Williams' first
half performance provided the spark that
the Cardinal needed to respond to an
early Cal lead.
With Stanford down 11-6, the Cardinal
went on a 14-0 run, capped by a resound
ing Williams dunk that put the Cardinal
up 18-11 at the 12:45 mark.
With six minutes to go in the half,
Williams hit his second 3-pointer, giving
Stanford a commanding 29-19 cushion.
He finished the period with 14 points and

10 rebounds.
"Williams killed us in the first half,
said Cal coach Todd Bozeman. "He almost
had a career night in the first half alone."
"I wasn't doing anything special,"
Williams said. "Right now, my goal is to
keep people in the stands."
Which shouldn't be difficult to accom
plish, if the 7,500 in attendance last night
were Cardinal fans.
"If we get crowds like this every night,
it's gonna be tough for anyone to beat us,"
Knight said.
