### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
Despite four players in foul
trouble and a 13-point Stanford
lead gone the way of the Edsel,
the Cardinal men's basketball
team played like the postseason
caliber team that California is
supposed to be, defeating the
Golden Bears 88-79 before a
sellout crowd at Maples Pavil
ion last night.
"Every time Cal made a run,
we bounced back," said Stan
ford head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "We matched the big
shots that they made. This was
clearly the best we've played as
far as shooting the ball."
The Cardinal (10-4, 3-2 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) hit a sea
son-high nine three-pointers last
night, and it was three clutch
three-pointers late in the game
which sealed the Stanford win.
Cal (10-4, 3-2) clawed back
from a 51-38 defecit early in the
second half, Liking its largest lead
of the period at 69-65 with 5:48 to
go on a Jason Kidd three-pointer.
Not to worry, according to
Stanford forward Andy Poppink.
"Even though they went on a
bit of a run, I don't think any of
us panicked," said Poppink, who
finished with a career-high 25
points. "I felt pretty good about
what was going on out there."
So did Stanford guard Brevin
Knight. Knight entered the game
shooting less than 20 percent
from three-point land. With the
Cardinal down 70-69 and 3:20 on
