Comparing the Canadian and American health
care systems, Canadian physician Frank Tires last
night dispelled Utopian myths surrounding his coun
try's socialized health care system.
A specialist in cardiovascular and thoracic
surgery at the University of British Columbia, Van
couver, Tires addressed about 35 students and mem
bers of the medical community in Larkin lounge
about the current state of health care in Canada.
His talk was designed not only to educate his
audience about Canada under a socialized health
care system but also to shed light on some of the
problems facing President Clinton and the rest of
the health care community in the United States.
"For approximately 20 years, Canadian Medicare
has provided unlimited access to the health care sys
tem for Canadians at a minimum of personal
expense," Tires said.
However, he admitted that — while the health
care system theoretically provides unlimited access
to all Canadians — the system was falling short in
several areas.
Marginalized groups such as the Inuits, a group
of Eskimo-Aleut Indians who live in parts of eastern
Canada, have been excluded from the benefits of the
health care system, according to Tires.
"The Inuits — because of their geographical iso
lation and their relative lack of education — have

been excluded much in the same way groups in |the
United States] who lack sufficient political clout and
money have been excluded, he said.
Another area in which 1 ires felt his country s
health care plan fell short was in the rationing of com
modities for such medical benefits as open heart
surgery. "Because there is a finite amount of money for
certain procedures such as open heart surgery, waiting
lists have developed in the provinces, said 1 ires.
Tires, a Canadian who has also practiced
medicine in the United States at the University of
Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania State University,
praised many aspects of the privatized health care
system found in the United States. ' The goal in
American hospitals is to get as many sick patients in
and out of the hospital so that the hospital remains
out of the red. This creates a greater degree of effi
ciency," said Tires.
However, he said he was not convinced that
either the American or the Canadian health care
system offers adequate health care coverage.
Instead, he suggested a hybrid of the two systems
spiced up with his own recommendations, which
include strengthening the individual doctor-patient
relationship and an increased emphasis on the indi
vidual's role within a given health care system.
The speech was made possible by Stern Hall Res
idential Fellow Dr. Robert J. Harvey, a colleague of
Tires and a specialist in research products for car
diovascular patients.
