# Reno picks Whitewater counsel
## White House agrees to cooperate with investigation 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton and his wife should be ques
tioned under oath as part of a "thor
ough and impartial investigation" of
their Arkansas land deals, Robert B.
Fiske Jr. said yesterday as he was
named special counsel to examine the
case.
The former Republican U.S. attor
ney said he was prepared to "go flat
out" in the investigation. "It's impor
tant for the country to get this done and
get it done as quickly and as thorough
ly and as fairly as possible," Fiske said.
His appointment by Attorney Gen
eral Janet Reno, after pressure from
congressional Republicans and other
Clinton critics, fell on the first anniver
sary of the president's inauguration.
Senate Republican leader Bob Dole,
who had asked for such an appoint
ment, said it should not stop congres
sional committees from their own
investigations. But he pulled back from
earlier calls for establishment of a spe
cial investigating panel.

Fiske said he planned to speak
directly to the president and his wife,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, as part of his
effort.
"I would certainly expect that before
this investigation is over that I would
question both the president and the
first lady and that it would be under
oath," Fiske said.
White House officials said the Clin
tons would cooperate with Fiske. When
asked about the counsel's plan to seek
their statements under oath, White
House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers
said, "He hasn't done it yet. We'll deal
with that when it comes."
To establish his independence,
Fiske said he would not use any of the
Justice Department prosecutors now
investigating the failed Madison Guar
anty Savings & Loan and its links to
the Clintons' investment in Whitewa
ter Development Corp.
"In order to conduct a truly inde
pendent investigation, I should have
people working for me who are not also

reporting to the attorney general,"
Fiske told a news conference.
The selection of Fiske, now a Wall
Street lawyer, fits suggestions that the
special counsel be a veteran attorney
and, to demonstrate independence, a
Republican. However, while Fiske was
appointed by Republican President
Ford to be U.S. attorney for the South
ern District of New York in Manhat
tan, he served mainly under Democrat
ic President Carter, from 1976 to 1980.
He declined to say for whom he
voted in the last presidential election.
As a private attorney, Fiske defend
ed the manufacturer of the nuclear
reactor at Three Mile Island in a $4 bil
lion damage suit and recently repre
sented key defendants in the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International
fraud case.
Republican leader Dole told
reporters he doesn't know Fiske, but
"people who know him think he is
extremely well-qualified, is indepen
dent."
