# Officials hurry to assess quake damage
## Inspectors to locate unsafe buildings before rain comes 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Scores of
building inspectors fanned out over a jit
tery city yesterday and found hundreds
of homes and offices made unsafe by
this week's earthquake and powerful
aftershocks.
"We're finding the damage is not just
concentrated in areas near the epicen
ter. It's spread to parts of the central
city," said Nick Delli Quadri, senior
structural engineer at the Los Angeles
Department of Building and Safety.
Delli Quadri said his department is
receiving up to 300 calls an hour from
homeowners and apartment dwellers
worried about returning home. Building
inspectors from San Prancisco and San
Diego were brought in to meet surging
requests for home inspections.
"Our concern right now are the occu
pants of buildings who don't want to go
home until they are inspected," he said
"We want to get them in their homes

before it rains."
A series of rainstorms was predicted
to hit this weekend, raising officials'
fears about the thousands of residents
camping in parks and shopping mall
parking lots.
U.S. Housing Secretary Henry Cis
neros said damage to residential build
ings appeared to be more severe than
first thought.
"I think this is a bigger housing prob
lem then we envisioned," he said in an
ABC television interview yesterday.
"When you fly over it, you really can't
see the problem. But then you get down
on the road or in front of the house and
you see that it's fallen off its foundation
and it is completely unsafe and is going
to have to be demolished.
"I drove through this community of San
Fernando last afternoon and every third
house has major structural problems."
The safety problem was highlighted

yesterday when 150 patients were
transferred from St. John's Hospital, a
Santa Monica landmark favored by such
Hollywood stars as Elizabeth Taylor,
Michael Jackson and Jack Nicholson.
The patients were sent to other hos
pitals yesterday on orders from state
inspectors examining the building for
structural flaws. Another 150 patients
were previously discharged or trans
ferred after Monday's quake.
Hospital spokesman Gary Miereanu
said the complex's north tower "took
the brunt of the damage."
"To us it looked pretty bad — cracks
on the wall and broken glass," he said.
Delli Quadri said 4,000 buildings had
been inspected by the end of Wednesday
and 250 buildings had failed inspection.
He estimated it would take weeks
just to check the tens of thousands of
structures in the city of Los Angeles
alone.
