Russia slows reforms
MOSCOW (AP) — Turning away
from drastic economic reforms that have
made life harder for many Russians, the
prime minister announced a Cabinet
shake-up yesterday that demoted or
dumped most of the country's bold
young reformers.
"The period of market romanticism
has ended," said Viktor Chernomyrdin,
who advocates a "go-slow" approach to
reforms but insists that efforts to move
toward a free market economy will con
tinue.
One of President Boris Yeltsin's key
reformers, 35-year-old Boris Fyodorov,
rejected an offer to keep his post as
finance minister.
"This is a turn back," Fyodorov told
reporters. "I do not want to be part of the
change in economic policy."
Yeltsin signed a decree appointing the

new, conservative-dominated Cabinet
but did not comment on it.
Cold claims 101 lives
(AP) — The record cold weather that
has battered much of the nation since
late last week is blamed for 101 deaths so
far. The toll has been rising daily, even as
temperatures edged above zero and, in
some cases, reached double digits for the
first time in a week.
Many have died in accidents on ice
slick roads. Some have suffered heart
attacks while shoveling snow. A few have
been killed by their efforts to keep warm,
such as a North Carolina man who died
in a fire that began when he tried to thaw
his water pipes with a blowtorch.
The victims include a Minnesota
woman who fell as she stepped outside to
feed birds; a Pittsburgh woman who col
lapsed while retrieving mail
