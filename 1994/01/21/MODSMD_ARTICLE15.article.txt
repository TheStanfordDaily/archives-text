## Editorial Fools not to change Widespread consensus suggests revamp of CIV under CUE's leadership 
### 
YOU CAN FOOL SOME of the
people all of the time and all of
the people some of the time,
but when it comes to Stanford's Cul
tures, Ideas and Values program, no
one seems to be fooled anymore —
it's time for a change.
Some evidence:
According to a poll conducted by
The Daily last quarter, 72 percent of
undergraduates said they feel CIV
should be changed.
English Prof. Robert Polhemus
has said the CIV requirement should
be scrutinized, and "as it stands now,
we might be able to junk it."
And German Prof. Ted Andersson,
director of the Myth and Modernity
track, said last quarter that "when
the curriculum gets reformed by the
Commission on Undergraduate Edu
cation, and if there is a proposal to get
rid of Ciy that wouldn't bother me."
Since it replaced the Western Civi
lization program in 1988, CIV has
been the topic of numerous debates.
While Western Civilization's critics
charged that the program was too
narrow because it adopted a Euro
centric, male-dominated view of cul
ture, CIV critics have questioned
whether the new program has sacri
ficed intellectual rigor and depth for
political correctness' sake.
Unfortunately, ClV's detractors
have focused too much on the PC
issue — the supplantation of some so
called "classic" Western works with
books by non-Western and female
authors — and overlooked the funda
mental structural problems within
the current program.
As it stands now, the nine-track
program suffers from:
• lack of a common intellectual
framework;
• poorly conceived writing assign
ments and feedback and a general
lack of integration with the Writing
and Critical Thinking requirement;

• lack of meaningful faculty contact;
• overloaded course syllabi which
encourage superficial examination
rather than critical thinking and
understanding; and
• a lack of connection to future
coursework.
The CUE, when examining the
current CIV program, must take
these issues into consideration and
should suggest a thorough reorgani
zation of the curriculum for first-year
students.
To effectively address the afore
mentioned concerns, a number of
programs could be developed; howev
er, an obvious framework for a new
program might be to create a uniform
two-quarter civilizations/writing pro
gram, followed by one quarter of
unique seminar-like classes offered
by many departments.
During the fall and winter quar
ters, all students would follow the
same civilizations curriculum. And,
unlike the current arrangement with
Writing and Critical Thinking, the
freshman writing curriculum would
be intimately tied to the civilizations
program, providing students with a
much more coherent program of
study and feedback.
Spring quarter, the writing
requirement would be dropped and
students would have the option of
taking small seminar-like classes
from a variety of departments rang
ing from Science, Technology and
Society to Psychology to Afro- and
African-American Studies. This
would foster greater student-faculty
contact and allow students to explore
an academic area in greater depth,
perhaps providing insight into
prospective majors.
And while some may debate the
idea of trying to provide a "shared
experience" in a program such as CIY
the preceding proposal would go a
long way toward providing a cohesive
study program with correlated writ
ing training. At the same time, it
would allow students to explore a
particular area of interest in depth.
Given the widespread support for
revamping CIV and the golden oppor
tunity the CUE report offers, we'd be
fools to pass it up.
