## Our Viennese sensibilities 
### 
THE VIENNESE Ball ... say the
very name of this event and peo
ple shudder.
They say, "Isn't that the thing
where a bunch of frustrated debutantes
and the oafs they dragged along get all
spiffed up so they can trample each
other in Roble Gym?"
Well, I suppose.
But then again, I wouldn't really
know. Since we came to Stanford we've
all been beaten over the head with
"must-do" campus traditions: fountain
hopping, Big Game, Exotic Erotic, ulti
mate frisbee and the Viennese Ball. Not
too many of us have ever actually been
a part of these, though. Naturally, it's
because we're way too deep to even
think of doing anything like them.
Those of us who consider ourselves
to "be above that stuff' don't tend to
know all that much about it. We sit in
the Coffee House, looking glumly supe
rior and scoff at all the sorority
wannabes as they rush around trying to
find that perfect pair of pumps to wear
to the dance.
Funny thing, though. If you ask
these too-cool people about their pasts,
you find out that they usually weren't
Mr. or Ms. Popularity in high school.
How do I know this? Because I'm one of
them.
Don't get me wrong — I'm not a
total social outcast. I have friends. A
Kappa even talked to me in public,
once.
I think my case is representative of

a lot of peoples'. I may not be com
pletely maladjusted, but I don't feel
comfortable swaggering into every
party or function on campus with an
attitude that says, "OK. The fun can
start now."
It's time for people like us to take
back the night life on this campus. The
unglamorous, the slightly flabby, the
uncoordinated and the inept; we must
bond together and claim this campus'
silly traditions for our own. We can't
spend our entire college lives sitting in
the corner, rationalizing why we aren't
out there with the arrogant and well
groomed social elite. We've got to
charge on out there and demand a good
time.
I'm starting with the Viennese Ball.
True, I'll probably hate it once I get
there. The idea of being packed into
Roble like frosh at a kegger doesn't
exactly thrill me. After all the make-up
and breath mints, these are still the
same people I see around campus every
day. Sure, we can't dance that well and
we don't become more interesting just
because we spent 30 bucks each to get
in, but there's something about the big
college formal that's probably worth
doing once. Kinda like the "Rocky Hor
ror Picture Show" or taking a chem
istry course. You wouldn't want to
repeat it, but the first time is still valu
able.
My friends, of course, will probably
disown me. What they don't under
stand is that I'm doing people like us a

favor. I'm showing the world that we
can be just as inane, as gloriously
stupid as the social demigods out there.
Because these traditions are truly
dumb. Jumping in cold fountains,
wearing g-strings in the dead of winter
— these are not things that rational
people do. Hut they are things that, for
whatever reason, we remember after
ward as really good times. Part of being
young is being obnoxious and for me
there's no better place to start than
the Viennese Ball.
One thing that would help those of
us who are trying to get into campus
traditions is to streamline them a little
We're all pretty busy, so if we could
have an Exotic Viennese Ultimate
Tournament, that would make our
lives a little easier. But 1 suppose that's
too much to ask.
When we leave this place, we should
feel like we've tasted everything it has
to offer, but we can't do that if we sim
ply cocoon in our social comfort zones.
We should all feel like we belong at any
function we choose to take part in, so
that years from now, we can look back
and say, "Remember all the things we
did at Stanford? Does anybody remem
ber why?!"
