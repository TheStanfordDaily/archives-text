## Student criticizes Drug Treatment Center's arguments 
### 
lAM WRITING in response to the Jan.
18 letter by Director Robert Matano,
Assessment Coordinator Rex Bierley
and Postdoctoral Fellow Amy Bronstone
of the Stanford Alcohol and Drug Treat
ment Center and Professor of Medicine
Peter Greenberg which attempts to
demonstrate the supposed dangers of mar
ijuana usage. In the Nov. 10 Science Bug
column, Chris Patil concludes that popular
perceptions of the dangers of marijuana
use are exaggerated or even imagined. The
authors of Tuesday's response "caution
against underestimating marijuana's
potential for addiction and the negative
consequences of both casual and regular
marijuana use." I will focus on casual use
of the drug. The issue of whether or not
consumption of an occasional joint poses a
serious health risk is much more relevant
to most Stanford students than studies of
chronic users who smoke several joints a
day for an extended period of time.
Tuesday's letter offers three warnings
to the casual user. First, "today's marijua
na is much more potent than that avail
able in the 19605, and contains about five
times more THC." I fail to see how demon
strating the cost-effectiveness of smoking
today, rather than 30 years ago, will keep
anyone from using marijuana. This state
ment must be parasitic upon a claim that
marijuana potency, or higher levels of
THC, are harmful to the health of the
casual user.
The authors seem to present such a

claim. They include two lists of "intoxica
tion effects." The first focuses on how
marijuana makes the user feel, while the
second addresses abilities which marijuana
use may impair, such as the user's ability
to drive a car. It is very important to note,
however, that these are only "intoxication
effects" — they address what happens
while the user is stoned, but they do not
apply to the casual user while he or she is
not stoned Anyone whose knowledge of
marijuana extends beyond medical text
books and drug-war slogans to actual
usage is fully aware of how they feel when
they are stoned — that feeling is why they
get stoned again. Their list might include
euphoria, giddiness and 'the munchies' in
addition to the negative feelings empha
sized in Tuesday's letter. As with drunken
ness, being stoned can feel good or bad.
The list of abilities which are impaired
while one is stoned is also no news to any
one who has been stoned — as is the case
when I am drunk, the four chairs I just
tripped on while crossing the room should
make me quite aware that driving a car or
operating heavy machinery would be an
irresponsible move on my part.
As a final argument against casual
usage, the authors state that one should
be aware of "the legal consequence of
being caught with a controlled substance."
To summarize what we know thus far, a
person who is considering casual usage of
marijuana should be aware of the follow
ing facts: 1) It would have cost more to get

stoned 30 years ago; 2) You may not like
how it makes you feel; 3) Don't drive or
count on getting in quality studying time;
and 4) You might get caught. It may seem
somewhat amazing that, after over two
months of pondering, this is the best that
the Stanford Alcohol and Drug Treatment
Center could come up with. Welcome to
the other side of the war on drugs.
In fairness, I should note that their
chosen task is quite ambitious. Attempting
to demonstrate the non-trivial, direct med
ical dangers of casual marijuana usage is a
neat trick when none exist. As the Drug
Enforcement Agency's administrative law
judge reported in 1988, "marijuana is one
of the safest, therapeutically active sub
stances known to man." The Encyclopedia
of Drug Abuse, Second Edition( 1992)
reports that "No deaths directly related to
the action of marijiuina have been report
ed ... for a human weighing approximate
ly 154 pounds a lethiil dose of marijuana
containing 1 percent THC would be 15
pounds smoked or 30 pounds eaten — all
at once." Even with today's more potent
marijuana, we're not even in the ballpark
(consumption of one-eighth of an ounce
over the course of an evening is a notable
performance; one simply does not deal in
pounds). As Chris Patil says, "It's not
going to kill you."
Having demonstrated no direct health
risk associated with casual marijuana
usage, the authors consider regular use.
While I cannot compete with their daz-

zling medical terminology, I was struck by
the statement that "Marijuana is a physi
cally addictive drug." I had always been
told by medical professionals that the con
verse is true. In fact, The Encyclopedia of
Drug Abuse states that "the use of mari
juana dot's not produce physical depen
dence." The authors defend their assertion
that marijuana is physically addictive by
pointing out that it shares some of the
"signs of physical dependency." My great
grandmother shares one of the "signs" of
being Charles Manson: she is crazy. I
assure you, my great-grandmother is not
Charles Manson. Reasoning which sug
gests otherwise is faulty.
Reading medical texts, I discovered that
Tuesday's letter was fraught with ques
tionable, exaggerated or simply false state
ments. If the authors so desire, I would be
happy to provide them with a list. I
encourage interested readers to travel to
Medical Library and investigate for
themselves. The authors' conclusions and
implications are generally tenable, but
they rarely seem warranted by objective
analysis of medical facts.
As a final note, the authors warn
against "medicating" life's pleasures and
travails. Perhaps they do not take aspirin,
have an extra cocktail with dinner, or revel
in the sight of a smoking bong. Personally,
I agree with Cypress Hill: Bill Clinton
should have inhaled.
