## Battle of the bulge: Nutra Sweet dreams of a fat-free me 
### 
I'D GIVE MY LEFT BREAST to look
like Kate Moss. So, my fascination
with Calvin Klein's favorite wonder
waif borders on the unhealthy. So, sacri
ficing Phat-Phree Wax and Nugget Bar/ to
the god of grotesquely protruding collar
bones is a bit on the weird side. So, maybe
dedicating an entire wall of my dorm room
to a member of a sex I am not inclined to
date is a little out of the ordinary.
Kate Moss in tighty-whities with
Marky Mark, saying "Big waist-banded
undergarments are cool." Kate Moss lying
butt's-up on a velour couch with a
pedophilic grin coaxing, "Anal sex is
baaaad, you naughty cat." Kate Moss with
her 88-like nipple popping out of a cold
black-and-white photo squealing "Buy
men's cologne."
Once again, that'd be my left breast.
No anesthesia.
I have this cool I'm-a-female obsession
with thinness. They teach you about it in
gym class in junior high by forcing you to
shower in front of girls who have already
hit the pubic-hair stage. They teach you
about it on TV, as you watch Marsha turn

sideways and suddenly disappear into
some Brady Bunch Anorexia Zone from
hell. They teach you about it in high
school, making cheerleaders jump up and
down repeatedly in small pleated skirts
which fail to cover up the crucial dimpled
lower-buttocks area.
Do you want fries with that shake?
I'm fat. Weighing in at a husky (Insert
your IQ minus 50 points here), I have
always been fat. From the 63-pound days
in eighth grade to the freshman 15. Fat as
if I'd eaten a convoy of Crisco trucks. Fat as
the dancing hippos in "Fantasia" on a bad
water-retention day. Fat as Grimace when
Shamrock shake season rolls around.
I see the world as varying degrees of fat.
As I sit here weighing down my chair at
this very moment, I am less fat than I was
a year ago. Back then I'd hit the torturous
"You're not fat, you're just not as thin as
you used to be" point. Freshman year I
was "not fat," which is a hop, skip and a
jump up the neuroses-meter from thin.
Does the phrase "psycho ex-girlfriend"
ring a bell?
In my life I have never merited a dou

ble-digit size in any reasonable brand of
clothing — starved Ann Taylor petites
aside. I have never crumpled my ultra
high loft under the weight of my thighs. I
do not leave the smoking ruins of crushed
high rises in my wake. And I only have
trouble closing the car door without
scraping the curb in light, poorly designed
American sedans.

Which makes it all the more frustrat
ing when the estrogen kicks in and turns
me into that sulking, annoying "I'm fat"
girl down the hall you would like to suffo
cate with a powder-cloud bomb of Ultra
Slim Fast. I say I'm fat. You say I'm not. I
say, "you've been sitting too close to the
microwave." You roll your eyes and say,
"whatever." I smile, confident that I have
cornered the market on cellulite.
Some girls are bigger than others.
Perhaps it was my mom's influence.
The half-servings at dinner. The cautions
against the blimping-out phase that is
your early 20s. The constant reminders to
do sit-ups before bedtime to avoid that
maternal pouch which was somehow
never shaken in our triumphant evolu

tionary break with what would become
the marsupial chain.

Her mother did it to her, she said. Her
mother's mother did it to her mother.
Generations of women lying prostrate on
generations of beds trying to scrunch
their butts into a skintight pair of
jeans/flapper skirt/Acme Birdlike-Frame-
Not-Included corset.
Some girls' mothers are bigger than
other girls' mothers.
I imagine my mom standing in a mir
ror wishing she looked like Marilyn Mon
roe — the fascistly dictated Beauty Stan
dard of Death. Then I imagine my friends
and myself cracking up at those same
Marilyn Monroe pictures in high school.
Nice winter-wheat-grain-silo breasts.
Nice monster hips big enough to balance
Sheena Easton and Olivia Newton-John
on each one. Nice butt. Storing acorns for
the winter, I suppose?
Next life, hold the mayo.
I've bought into some sick joke. Some
twisted plot to keep women constantly
torturing their boyfriends. "You know
I'm fat, just say it." "You're not fat." "It's

OK to say it, I know it already." "You're
not fat, you're curvaceous." "Oh my god,
you really do think I'm fat. I'm ugly too.
I'm repulsive and am straining your life
with my mere presence. I can't believe I
never guessed this before."
Or the flip-side of the coin. The "what's
this?" boyfriend, gesturing to your lower
abdomen as if you had a tattoo of the exact
metric measurement of his penis right
below your belly button. He giggles and
does the Pillsbury Doughboy stomach
poke. You refuse to look down in the show
er for three weeks, wearing only fluffy
sweats for the duration of the quarter.
The bigger the cushion. . .
I'd give anything to give up this pursuit
of thin. Anything to fight this communist
campaign designed to keep women's calorie
intakes so low they won't have the energy
to take over the world as is their wont.
Take the right breast too, it's weighing
me down.
