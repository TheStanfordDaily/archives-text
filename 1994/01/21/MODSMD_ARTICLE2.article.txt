## Stanford arms expert Perry tops short list 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer with AP wire reports 
A Stanford engineering professor has
emerged as the leading candidate on Presi
dent Clinton's short list for secretary of de
fense.
Clinton appears close to settling on
Deputy Defense Secretary William J. Perry
— previously a co-director of Stanford's
Center for International Security and Arms
Control — because of his popularity in Con
gress and the feeling that he would win easy
Senate confirmation, according to today's
editions of the Los Angeles Times.
The newspaper quoted a senior White
House official who said that Perry "is almost
universally well regarded, especially within
the administration, and the president
knows him and thinks highly of him. He
knows of Perry's reputation on the Hill."

The official also said that
the nomination of Periy, 66,
is supported by outgoing De
fense Secretary Les Aspin,
who announced that he
would step down last month.
At least five other poten
tial candidates have been
under consideration since
Bobby Ray In man — Clin
ton's original choice for the

position — privately indicated two weeks ago
that he didn't want the job, the Times report
ed. Since then, finding a strong candidate for
the job has been an administration priority.
The most mentioned prospects include
Perry, Martin Marietta Chairman Norman
R. Augustine, former Hewlett-Packard
head John Young and CIA Director James
Woolsey.
