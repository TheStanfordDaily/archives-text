# Clinton may tap prof for defense secretary
## Stanford arms expert Perry tops short list 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer with AP wire reports 
A Stanford engineering professor has
emerged as the leading candidate on Presi
dent Clinton's short list for secretary of de
fense.
Clinton appears close to settling on
Deputy Defense Secretary William J. Perry
— previously a co-director of Stanford's
Center for International Security and Arms
Control — because of his popularity in Con
gress and the feeling that he would win easy
Senate confirmation, according to today's
editions of the Los Angeles Times.
The newspaper quoted a senior White
House official who said that Perry "is almost
universally well regarded, especially within
the administration, and the president
knows him and thinks highly of him. He
knows of Perry's reputation on the Hill."

The official also said that
the nomination of Periy, 66,
is supported by outgoing De
fense Secretary Les Aspin,
who announced that he
would step down last month.
At least five other poten
tial candidates have been
under consideration since
Bobby Ray In man — Clin
ton's original choice for the

position — privately indicated two weeks ago
that he didn't want the job, the Times report
ed. Since then, finding a strong candidate for
the job has been an administration priority.
The most mentioned prospects include
Perry, Martin Marietta Chairman Norman
R. Augustine, former Hewlett-Packard
head John Young and CIA Director James
Woolsey.


Perry
Speaking on CNN's "Larry
King Live" last night, the presi
dent invited more speculation
when he said that Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., would be "a great
secretary of defense." Clinton
declined to say whether Nunn,
chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, was actually
being considered.
Perry, who is currently on
leave from Stanford, is considered
a logical choice by Pentagon
observers because of the wide
respect he enjoys in Congress and
at the Pentagon, where he is in
charge of the department's daily
business. He has worked in the
Department of Defense before,
serving as undersecretary for
research and engineering in the
Carter administration.
Associates of Perry at Stan

ford's Center for International
Security and Arms Control
praised his intellect and discipline.
"I think he'd be excellent" as
secretary of defense, said David
Bernstein, a research associate at
the center. "He can work very
well with Congress and the Pen
tagon. He's very cooperative and a
team player."
John Harvey, a senior research
engineer at the center, said
"there's no one in my profession
al career . . . that I'm more
impressed with."
"He has a tremendous intellect
and a broad understanding of the
defense acquisition process," Har
vey added.
Perry, who received his bache
lor's and master's degrees in
mathematics from Stanford, has
taught undergraduate courses
including an engineering-econom
ic systems class called "The Role
of Technology in National Securi
ty." Before being nominated for
his current job last February,

Perry had served on several gov
ernment commissions and adviso
ry boards.
In his post at the Pentagon,
Bernstein said, Perry has worked
on issues like procurement
reform and military conversion in
Russia in addition to general bud
get matters. "He seems to enjoy it
very much," said Bernstein, who
has kept in touch with Perry over
the past year.
Harvey said that Perry is "real
ly in his element" in his current
job at the Pentagon. "He's had
some opportunity to turn some
things around in defense acquisi
tion (procedures)," Harvey said,
adding that Perry has been "very
excited about his job."
An official in Perry's office
declined to comment on his possi
ble nomination. According to
White House aides, Clinton —
who almost always interviews
important nominees — has not
formally talked to anybody about
the job.
