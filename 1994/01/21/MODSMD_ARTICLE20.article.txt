# Sharp shooters hustle the Bears
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
A little hustle goes a long way.
In snaring its biggest victory of the
season, the Cardinal played with a first
half passion that had been absent from
its two previous games.
Stanford exhibited new-found inten
sity last night from the opening tip-ofT,
in stark contrast to its uninspiring

opening-period performances last
weekend against the Arizona squads.
This time, the Cardinal wasn't going
to allow itself to be blown out before the
halflime buzzer sounded.
"We just played with so much more
confidence," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery about his team's
improved enthusiasm. "The kids were
really excited."
And it showed.

So much, in fact, that when Cardinal
forward Andy Poppink helped break up
a California fast-break lay-up by knock
ing away a loose ball, he didn't stop.
While Bear point guard Jason Kidd
chased afler the ball, Poppink gave him
an inconspicuous push, sending Kidd
stumbling and setting an aggressive
tone for the remainder of the period.
Poppink was not the only Stan
ford player who sent a message to
the Bears.
Senior Brent Williams put in a
relentless first-period performance,
outhustling everyone on the floor
for any rebound within his general
vicinity.
The 6-foot-6 forward particularly
burned the Cal team under the
offensive glass, collecting several
rebounds on one Cardinal posses
sion before finally drawing a foul.
"We just weren't getting any
rebounds in the first half," Kidd
said. "That's what made things dif

ficult for us."
Indeed, the hustle demonstrated
by Williams and the other Cardinal
players in fighting for loose balls all
over the Maples court proved
instrumental in bringing Califor
nia's threatening run-and-gun style
to a virtual standstill.
"If we can't get the ball, then we
can't get out and run," said Bears
coach Todd Bozeman. "That's a big
time key, because that's a large part
of our game."
Junior David Harbour, the most
hard-nosed Cardinal player of all,
displayed his trademark "no fear"
attitude when he subbed into the
game at the 15-minute mark.
Upon receiving a pass on offense,
Harbour put his head down and
dribbled straight into a slew of Cali

fornia defenders wit hout hesitation.
His courageous drive was greeted by
a rough foul, earning him a well
deserved trip to the free-throw line.
Stanford's emotional start
sparked the entire team, but that's
not to say that California did not try
to provide some intimidation of
their own.
During a Cardinal transition,
Bears center Ryan Jamison tried to
steal a pass to guard Dion Cross, but
instead ended up flattening the 6-2
sophomore without being allied for
a foul.
However, Jamison's over-aggres
sive effort only made Cross play
with increased intensity.
"That fired me up because that's
going to mi ike me play harder."
loiter in the half, Cross proceed-

Ed to demonstrate just how motivat
ed he had become by pulling down a
rebound at the same time as Jami
son. Despite Jamison's nine-inch
height advantage, Cross muscled
him to the ground as they both
fought for possession.
How important was Stanford's
inspired play in the first piirt of the
game?
Without it, the Cardinal would
have been lucky to still have a shot
at winning with under 10 minutes
to play. However, with the memo
ries of its poor outings last weekend
still fresh in their minds, the Stan
ford players weren't going to allow
for any repeat performances.
"I refused to let what happen in
Arizona happen again," said fresh
man Brevin Knight.
