# Sharp shooters hustle the Bears

A little hustle goes a long way.
In snaring its biggest victory of the
season, the Cardinal played with a first
half passion that had been absent from
its two previous games.
Stanford exhibited new-found inten
sity last night from the opening tip-ofT,
in stark contrast to its uninspiring

opening-period performances last
weekend against the Arizona squads.
This time, the Cardinal wasn't going
to allow itself to be blown out before the
halflime buzzer sounded.
"We just played with so much more
confidence," said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery about his team's
improved enthusiasm. "The kids were
really excited."
And it showed.

So much, in fact, that when Cardinal
forward Andy Poppink helped break up
a California fast-break lay-up by knock
ing away a loose ball, he didn't stop.
While Bear point guard Jason Kidd
chased afler the ball, Poppink gave him
an inconspicuous push, sending Kidd
stumbling and setting an aggressive
tone for the remainder of the period.
