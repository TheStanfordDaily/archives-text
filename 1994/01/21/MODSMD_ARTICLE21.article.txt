## Gymnasts to spring onto national scene 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
Stanford men's gymnastics
coach Sadao Hamada takes
tremendous pride in the fact that
his program not only nurtures
national championship teams, but
also prepares outstanding individ
uals for international competition.
At the U.S. Winter Cup Qualifier
this Saturday and Sunday, Hama
da once again hopes to fulfill both
of these objectives simultaneously.
For the majority of the Cardi
nal, this weekend's home contest
will provide an opportunity to
practice competing and try new
skills and sequences of maneuvers,
as scores from the Winter Cup
Qualifier will not count toward
national rankings. In addition,
extra padding and other safety
equipment may be used without
penalty. Thus, difficult maneuvers
can be attempted in a competitive
atmosphere without great risk of
injury.
On the other hand, many team
members are taking the meet very
seriously indeed. Junior National
Team members Jamie Ellis and
Keith Wiley will be attempting to
gain national prominence along
with gymnasts from the University
of California. Pending on their per

formance in the Qualifier on Sat
urday, the two Cardinal freshmen
may earn a trip to Colorado
Springs for the U.S. Winter Cup
Challenge two weeks later.
At the Colorado event, Ellis
would vie for a position on either
the U.S. National Team or the l S
National Developmental Team.
Meanwhile, Wiley, not yet old
enough to contend for either
National team, would hope to reaf
firm his status as a Junior Nation
al Team member.
Junior Josh Stein will automat
ically compete at Colorado, as he is
presently a member of the U.S.
Developmental Team. He will aim
to either secure or improve his
standing at the Winter Challenge.
"They just have to come up with
a particular score, and then they'll
go to Colorado," Hamada said sim
ply concerning the two freshmen.
"As for the team, we're still testing
routines â€” nothing is really final
at all. We've mainly been working
on increasing difficulty on rings
and vaulting.
"1 think the guys got it, but 1
want to see them in competition.
We're going to seek what we need
for the best performances at
NCAAs |in April].
