# Roadrunners: obstacle for Cardinal wrestlers
## 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
It has been a very busy two
months for the Stanford wrestlers.
Since their first home meet in
late November, when they chalked
up a 23-21 win against San Fran
cisco State, they have competed in
four large tournaments. They will
put this added experience to the
test against Cal State-Bakersfield
tomorrow night at Burnham Pavil
ion.
According to head coach Chris
Horpel, the meet comes at a good
time for many of the top Cardinal
wrestlers. Several of the starters,
especially co-captains Lance John
son (150 'bs.) and Jay Jackson
(134), have the added boost of pre
vious successes to keep their
momentum high.
Johnson, who earned top hon
ors at the Aggie Open last week,
has an impressive 9-2 record head
ing into tomorrow's meet. Jack
son,l7-4 overall, also won the title
for his weight class at last week's
tournament.
The team expects tomorrow's
competition to be a definite chal
lenge. In summing up the squad s
prospects, Horpel estimated that
the Cardinal is favored in only two
of the weights: 142 and 150.
"We've got to pull some upsets

to beat them," Horpel said. "In
terms of their fan support, the cul
ture, the pressure their coach is
under to win . . . it's very much like
a Midwest team. They just have
tradition there."
The 10 Cardinal starters will
give the Roadrunners some compe
tition of their own. At 118, junior
Hamy Saad will wrestle Hobby
Soto, who beat Saad at the Coun
try Classic Open earlier this
month. Although Saad is the
underdog, Horpel believes that
"Harm's ready for a win. The tim
ing is right."
Matt Cano will represent the
Cardinal at 126. A 15-7 record
reflects the sophomore's successes
at recent tournaments, week
Cano took second-place honors in
his division at the Aggie Open,
after taking fourth place at both
the Oregon Classic and the Coun
try Classic Open. Cano will likely
have a hard-fought match against
Hakersfield's Soren Murphy.
The match to watch may
involve Jackson in the 134 lb. class,
as he has another try at Tony Des
ousa. Jackson lost close matches to
Desousa in the finals of both the
Country Classic and the I-as Vegas
Invitational in December.
Although this makes Desousa the
technical favorite, both Horpel
and Jackson are prepared for vic
tory.
"I'm excited for the match. I've
just got to wrestle [Desousa) real
ly strong and do my job," said
Jackson.
Jimmy Aguirre (142) narrowly

beat Bakersfield's Jeff Heberle at
the Country Classic, and Horpel
is confident Aguirre can repeat
that success. Also favored is John
son, who will wrestle Jason Ram
stetter. Johnson has not compet
ed against Ramstetter, who made
it to the quarterfinals at the Las
Vegas Invite.
The 158-pound match appears
to be a toss-up, as Cardinal Tod
Surmon will combat Mickey Rit
ter. Surmon wrestled Ritter for

fifth place at the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships last sea
son. However, both have switched
to 158 from 150 since then, a
transition that Horpel believes
Ritter has made more solidly than
Surmon has.
Freshman Scott Chapman
(167) is recovering from a
sprained ankle, which will hinder
his chances against Dan Corp
stein. Corpstein was the champi
on in his weight class at the Coun

try Classic.
The remaining Cardinal
starters will be freshmen Jason
Gladden (177) and Bryan Vani
man (190) and sophomore Scott
Whitt in the heavyweight divi
sion.
"We have our hands full, but
this is the level of competition
that we've got to beat," Horpel
said. "If we have a dream dual,
we'll beat them . . . but everyone's
got to have their best match."
It has been a very busy two
