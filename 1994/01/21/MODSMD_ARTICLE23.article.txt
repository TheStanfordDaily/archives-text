## Hoopsters attempt to sweep the Bears

It's still Big Game.
Like the Axe-swapping gridiron
version last November, tonight's
women's basketball clash between
Stanford and California features
teams from the first and second
divisions of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence standings, the top and bottom
conference attendance draws and a
nationally-ranked power against a
club struggling to stay on the good
side of the .500 mark.
This time, however, the 10th
ranked Cardinal (10-3, 3-1 in the
Pac-10) will hold nearly every con
ceivable edge over its archrival
when it hits the 1 larmon Gymnasi
um hardwood in Berkeley. Riding a
three-game winning streak and
momentum that has re-estab
lished the squad as one of the
nation's top 10, Stanford appears
poised to make easy prey of the
reeling Golden Bears (7-7, 1-3),
who just stopped a five-game skid
with a victory over lowly Arizona
State Saturday.
So all is fine and good for Cardi
nal fans â€” except for the sticky
formality of stepping onto the
court and playing the game. While
tonight's contest might yet go
according to the rosy picture paint
ed above, tradition suggests that
the Golden Bears will not go quiet
ly into the foggy East Bay night
Take, for example, Cal's track
record in the cozy confines of Har
mon, the smallest Pac-10 arena in

regular use with a scant capacity of
6,578. Despite averaging a pathetic
600 paying customers per outing,
the Golden Bears have staved off
hibernation and compiled a 6-1
home mark that belies their overall
troubles.
And against Stanford? Cal took
a narrow 64-59 decision from the
Cardinal in Harmon a year ago,
and, on the same court, downed a
Stanford team that would go on to
win the national championship in
1992.
True, the Cardinal has won 10
of the last 12 encounters, including
a 93-80 blowout in Berkeley in
1991, and holds an 18-14 overall
series advantage. But convention
rarely holds in this series, and the
Golden Bears would like nothing
more than to start their rise from
mediocrity with a third-straight
Big home upset tonight.
"It should be a challenge at Cal.
In fact, in the next three games I
should learn a lot about this team,"
said Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer, referring also to her
squad's trip to Los Angeles next
weekend.
On the court, the challenge will
be manifest as a two-on-two
matchup featuring four of the Pac
10's best players. In the middle,
Golden Bear 6-foot-3 senior center
Ingrid Dixson lines up against 6-5
Cardinal junior Anita Kaplan.

rebounder at 13.4 per game, pulled
