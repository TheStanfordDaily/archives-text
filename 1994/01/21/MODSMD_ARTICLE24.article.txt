All the Stanford women's swimming team is really
worried about is pood weather. Nothing else. The rest
is inevitable: a win and at least one more NCAA quali
fication.
So the squad is just hoping for sunshine today and
tomorrow when they host Arizona and Arizona State
in separate dual matchups.
Ijet's just say that if the temperature outside is
equal to the margin by which the Cardinal should beat
the Arizona squads, you can look forward to seeing the
water in deGuerre pool at a steady boil.
"Both Arizona and Arizona State are perennially
among the top 10 in the NCAA," said coach Richard
Quick "But 1 don't think they have the quality to
knock us off."
A fair assumption, considering the fact that the

On your marks, set ... Cardinal swimmers look to get |ump on opponents this
weekend.
Cardinal is carrying a 40-match
dual-meet win streak into this
weekend's competition.
"We excel in the quality of our
depth and the quality of our top ath
letes," Quick said. "We are a diffi
cult team to handle in a dual meet."
Not good news for the Wildcats.
Arizona is 1-3 in dual meets and has
already lost to two Pacific 10 Con
ference squads this season. But the
Wildcats do have several swimmers
that might cause the Cardinal prob
lems; both individual medley swim
mer Becky Gumpert and freshman
backstroker Claudia Stanescu have
already qualified for the NCAA
tournament.
"Both are tough teams, but for
us it's just another chance to race,"
junior backstroker Amy
said.
This will be the first dual meet
for the Cardinal all year, as the
team has competed only in invita
tional and tournaments. The entire
squad is ready for a taste of compe
tition.
"We definitely need a meet. We
need to race," Quick said. "We're

tired of racing each other. I'm look
ing forward to this meet to assess
where we are."
The Sun Devils rise in deGuerre
on Saturday, bringing with them a
not-so-hot 3-5, 0-2 in the Pac-10
mark. Arizona State's Chris Jeffrey
has personal best times in the 200-
meter and 400 IM of 2 minutes,
5.26 seconds and 4:15.28 respective
ly, both of which are right in line
with the best that Stanford has to
offer.
"I'm not looking to beat her, I'm
just looking to race her," Stanford
IM swimmer Mary Ellen Blanchard
said regarding Jeffrey. "I don't
know how fast she is going to swim,
and I just want to get an NCAA
qualifying time. The only time that
I'll be concerned about beating her
is at the end of the season."
Several Cardinal swimmers
already have their tickets and hotel
accommodations reserved for Indi
anapolis in March. Those swim
mers already qualified for the
NCAA tournament include Jenny
Thompson, Lea loveless and Becky
Crowe.
"Both squads (Arizona and Ari
zona State) have individuals that
can compete with our swimmers,"
Quick said. " There should be some
very good races this weekend."
