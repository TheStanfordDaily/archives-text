# Stanford's diff'rent strokes
## ASU, Arizona next victims for men's swimming 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
How different can two weekends
be?
About 90 degrees.
After braving sub-freezing tem
peratures in Ann Arbor, Michigan
last week, this weekend the Stan
ford men's swim team will appreci
ate the comforts and sunny skies of
home as they play host to Arizona
today at 1 p.m. and Arizona State
tomorrow at noon.
However, the differences be
tween this weekend and last extend
beyond the weather conditions. No.
2 Michigan gave the Cardinal a run
for their money in the confines of
their home pool before falling to the
two-time defending national cham
pions by 24 points. While Arizona
and ASU both feature talented indi
viduals, they lack the depth and
overall quality of top-ranked Stan
ford.
Co-captain Trip Zedlitz acknowl
edged that this week has a different
feel to it."I think it will be more fun

in general," he said. "We'll be at
home and the whole team will get to
swim. There's no travel to deal with
and we'll have the team together in
front of the home crowd."

One thing which should remain
constant is the outcome of the com
petition. Stanford coach Skip Kenney
noted that a perfect dual-meet season
is on the minds of the Cardinal.
"These dual meets are impor
tant for building momentum
toward | Pacific 10 Conference
Championshipsl and NCAAs,"
Kenney said. "We want to take the
training we've been doing and
applying it to races. Now that we've
gotten through Texas and Michi
gan, we could go undefeated. We
have to be careful not to stub our
toe and lose a meet we should win."
When asked if the team might
experience a let-down after its
recent victories, Zedlitz responded,
"Not really. There are only five or
six weeks until most people will
shave, so every race is important.
Even if we're not in a major compe
tition, there are still individual

things to work on. There's a sense
of urgency for every meet since
there's so little time until the cham
pionship meets."
After taking 20 swimmers to
Michigan, Kenney is looking for
ward to seeing his entire squad
compete this weekend at deGuerre
Pool. "We want to try to get every
one in the meet," he said. "It's often
up to the visiting coach — we have
to match their travel number, but
we can swim unofficial races."
Against Arizona and ASU, the
Cardinal may be able to get a little
bit of rest, especially in comparison
to the Michigan dual.
"We might be able to pick and
choose events, or maybe swim fewer
events per person," Zedlitz said.
Zedlitz, a senior, is part of a
group that Ls looking to make histo
ry later this season, according to
Kenney.
"This senior class has a chance
to be the highest-scoring ever in
NCAA history," he said. Last year,
Stanford missed the record by a
mere 22 points.
