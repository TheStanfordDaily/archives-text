# Balancing act
## Gymnastics to challenge top-ranked teams 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
In a sport like gymnastics, a
team has no control over how its
opponent performs. The Stan
ford women gymnasts plan to
keep this in mind when they face
the University of Alabama and
Arizona State University,
respectively second and ninth in
the preseason coaches' poll, on
Sunday in Tempe, Ariz.
Though Alabama lost two Ail-
American gymnasts last year,
they have gained three strong
freshmen — Meredith Willard,
Kim Bonaventura and Stephanie
Woods — and are as tough as
ever, according to Stanford assis
tant coach Lisa Mitzel-Izzi. They
earned a high score of 194 in
their first meet and are expected
to win the upcoming meet.
Alabama's assistant coach
David Patterson said that at
their meet last week there were
no falls on vault or uneven bars,
one fall on the beam and three
falls on the floor. Their goal this
week is to stay on the equipment
and gain endurance on the floor.
Other Alabama gymnasts to
watch for are all-around per
formers Kim Kelly and C'hasity
Junkin. Kara Stilt will be out for
about a month due to a knee
injury.
"We are looking forward to
going up against Stanford." Pat
terson said. "It is a well-coached

team that has been recruiting
very well the past few years. I'm
sure they are prepared for the
meet."
The Cardinal did not meet
with Alabama last season,

This team is becom
ing more and more
motivated to have
wins ... But the most
important thing is to
go out there, perform
our best and have fun.'
— Lisa Mitzel-lzzi

though they did face the Arizona
State gymnasts, who won by a
narrow margin. The Sun Devils
did not lose any seniors from last
year's squad and came in 12th at
Nationals, yet Mitzel-Izzi is con
fident that Stanford has a good
chance of doing as well as and
possibly better than Arizona
State on Sunday.
Unlike many sports, consis
tently winning regular season
meets is not vital for the women
gymnasts in order to go to
Nationals, though it does boost a
squad's confidence.
"This team is becoming more

and more motivated to have
wins," Mitzel-Izzi said. "But the
most important thing is to go out
there, perform our best and have
fun."
The Cardinal lineup will more
or less be the same as at the last
meet, in which Stanford narrow
ly fell to UCLA. The prnnasts
have been concentrating more
on the bars than usual this week
in order to attain more consis
tency in catching release moves.
Hopefully, they will remain as
strong as they were last week on
beam and floor.
The squad's exceptional per
formance against UCLA gave
the gymnasts confidence and
positive attitudes toward the
upcoming meet. Team psycholo
gist Steve Restaino has been
working with the team on feeling
comfortable about competing
away from home.
"There is comfort in perform
ing at home," Mitzel-Izzi said.
"We need to carry that comfort
with us and make their crowd
our crowd."
Yet Cardinal head coach
Breck Greenwood thinks that
there are less distractions at an
away meet, and it is easier for his
coaching staff since they have
less responsibility.
"A place is a place, though it is
more fun to perform at home,"
said Stanford junior Jene Elzie,
who came in first place at the
UCLA meet.
