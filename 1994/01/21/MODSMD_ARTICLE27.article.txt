# Diversions theorem
## Casper Cwestions A
						friendly interview with America's favorite sweetheart 
### Michael Green Editorial staff 
Gerhard Casper. You've heard of him.
He's very important.
He's the damn president. His office has
wood in it. When I walked in the reception
room someone actually offered me coffee.
It's like Denny's in there. But better
because he's not just a syrup steward, he's
president. I suppose that makes his office
more like the Spago of Palo Alto.
When he came out to greet me I noticed the
remnants of the swollen-head-shrimp-allergy
fiasco under his eyes, but I didn't say anything
because he's president and can probably get
me in trouble.
Mr. Casper was being remarkable friendly
— he was, after all, nice enough to let Diver
sions interview him — so I figured I'd start
with just that.
Could you get someone in trouble ? Could you
get me thrown out if 1 said something to upset
you now?
No, I couldn't. I couldn't and that's wonderful
that I couldn't. There are procedures. You can
be thrown out only by violating the Funda
mental Standard. The Fundamental Standard
is enforced by some elaborate process that I
have never understood and never will under
stand. But in any event I wouldn't dream of
attempting it.

I just had to pay a $25 fine
on my University bill for
paying late. Could you
grant a presidential pardon
for something like that ?
No. For the same reason
they won't let me convict
you of anything they won't
permit me to pardon you. I

can pardon only if I have the power to convict.
What did you want to be when you grew up ?
My great joy as a child was toy trains. I was
greatly interested in them, so I wanted to
drive a locomotive. I had an elaborate set-up of
toy trains in the basement of the house we
lived in.
Are you disappointed with your decision to
become a university president instead?
Not at all, though I would have liked to have
been Leland Stanford Jr., then I could have
ridden his trains.
Concerning your job now, do you ever run into
people you knew when you were little who used
to pick on you and say "Nya nya nya I'm pres
ident of Stanford and you're just waiting on
tables"?

I haven't had that wonder
ful experience and the rea
son for that is, of course,
that I'm not living in the
country where I grew up.
And if you did?
If I did? Well, what do I
know? There were certainly
a lot of people around who
thought I would never be
good for anything and
maybe they were right.
Do you sometimes feel obli
gated to brush up on pop
culture so you can make
small talk with your stu
dents?
Not at all. I have such a
hard time brushing up on
high culture, how could I

begin to worry about pop culture?

Did you know who Betty Crocker was before
delivering that line in Gaieties?
No, but I made detailed inquiries. I don't like
to say things I don't understand, so I always
bend over backwards to research it.
You end up traveling a lot as University presi
dent. What do you do in all these places ?
I arrive at places and usually someone is wait
ing for me to take me to other places and then,

being in that other
place, I'll have to go to
still another place. I
end up traveling from
place to place. I was in
Boston and New York
just last week. In
Boston I met with
Stanford Volunteers. I
visited prospective
donors. There was an
alumni reception. The
alumni impressed me
very much because in
spite the fact that
there had been two
feet of snowfall they
all came. In New York
I met even with Stan
ford parents, for all I
know your parents.
You are not from New
York?
I am from New York.
You are? Where from?
Westchester.
Where in Westch
ester?

Mamaroneck. Little

small nice spot. We

have a great pizza place named Sal's

Oh. You know, New York is my American
hometown. When I came first to the United
States as a 16-year-old I spent three months
there. I was for two-week periods in schools all
over the metropolitan area. Long Island and
Rockville Center. Then I spent two weeks in a
suburb of New Jersey called Springfield, then
a week in Milbrook school in Hyde Park, then
a week at Taft School.
You got thrown out of all these schools?
I couldn't last. They wouldn't put up with me
for more than a week.
Ever go back to these places and say "Nya nya
nya, I'm president of Stanford now and you 're
waiting on tables"?
Actually, I was at a Kronos Quartet perfor
mance and somebody from the University
staff came and introduced me to the son of one
of the families with whom I stayed when I was
a teenager. He had just come into town from
Seattle and he said, "Remember, you stayed
with us?" I haven't seen him since then so, of
course, if I would have seen him on the street
1 wouldn't have recognized him and therefore
wouldn't have been able to say those things.

Did you say it then ?
No, no, I'm much too
polite. I try to be polite at
all times and I engage in all
kinds of self-censorship.
And occasionally when 1
drop my guard, as I did
Tuesday at a dorm visit, I
immediately get into trou
ble.
Any times you regret letting
your guard down ?
Yes, I regret it all the time.
Apparently my capacity to
ofTend people is unlimited.
And then there are other
problems, like when I used a
word Tuesday which I
shouldn't have used and
which some people think is a
terrible word. I cannot even
tell it to you it is so bad.

Could you spell it ?
Well .. . it's S—H —I— T. Don't pronounce it
though,okay?
No problem. Let's move on. Do you think it's
possible for someone whose artistic values are
rooted in the Western aesthetic to truly appre
ciate the creative art of another culture?
Absolutely. I do appreciate, for instance, Chi
nese and Japanese art. You will find in my
own personal art collection there are Mayan

items. Some African mats. Unlimited. It's
impossible for you to not he able to appreciate
other aesthetics.
Now, the shrimp thing. Is that all shellfish
you 're allergic to, or just shrimp you can V eat?
How's lobster?
Who knows? But I'm not going to try it any
more. 1 looked like a monster. Only shrimp
was diagnosed as the culprit and now 1 don't
dare touch anything else.
What do you do for fun ?
The greatest fun I have is hiking through the

Foothills. 1 like to go with my
wife because she also works
very hard and we hardly ever
meet except at the airport —
she's arriving and I'm going
out. Occasionally we have an
afternoon together and we
like to go for walks.

Do you drive her to the air
port'?

No, no. I don t do that.
When you travel, do you fly first-class or
coach?
I always fly coach. Sometimes the airline will
upgrade me, but 1 never buy anything other
than a coach ticket.
And do you eat plane food or do you bring a
snack ?
I eat the plane food. I manage to swallow it.
Do you ever go to the Coffee House?
Here, no. I've been outside there in the oval
area. But no, I haven't been there once.
Wanna'go?
Yeah.
I could talk to Ingrid and set something up.
Yes, sure.
Did you know the Coffee House is called the
CoHo?
Before I came here I got this dictionary of
Stanford designations and slang. Who would
ever understand that Mem Chu is Memorial
Church and not a Chinese dynasty? So at that
time I actually did a conscientious, in-depth
study. One of the most irritating aspects of
Stanford is that everybody uses either
acronyms or letter designations. They never
use full names.
That would make you G.C., P. o' S.
Yeah. Most of the times when I am in a staff
meeting and people throw about out one of

a student's bicycle. He was given a ticket for not having a bike light.
