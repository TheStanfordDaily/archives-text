# Weisberg to spearhead faculty recruiting effort
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
Prof. Robert Weisberg has been ap
pointed to the newly created position of vice
provost for faculty recruitment and develop
ment, Provost Condoleezza Rice announced
at yesterday's Faculty Senate meeting.
Weisberg's appointment comes four
months after a University committee com
pleted a sweeping examination of the Office
of Multicultural Development. The commit
tee recommended the administration name a
faculty member to oversee issues of faculty
affirmative action and address problems fac
ing the University's ability to attract and re
tain younger faculty members, Rice said.
The creation of the position reflects the
University's attempt to deal with mounting
evidence that Stanford is lagging behind its
major competitors in recruiting and sup
porting women and minority faculty.
Weisberg, who will start the half-time
position in spring quarter, said the job grew

both out of a desire to concentrate more on
affirmative action and to make junior facul
ty members feel comfortable at Stanford.
Rice told the senate that Weisberg "will
take charge not only for recruitment, but he
will also attend more fully than either [Uni
versity President Gerhard! Casper or I can
to the needs and concerns of junior faculty."
"This is really a job for the president and
provost, but there isn't enough time in the
day," Rice said. "This will help a lot."
According to Weisberg, Stanford had a
vice provost for faculty affairs during the
1970s who helped young faculty members.
He said the new position was in some ways
similar to the old one.
While decisions about hiring faculty are
in the hands of individual departments,
Weisberg said he will try to cut across all de
partments, looking for general trends that
affect junior faculty. He said he can broadly
address issues of diversity in making Stan-
ford attractive to junior faculty
members, aiming to increase the
number of women and minorities
on the faculty.
Part of the job, Weisberg said,
will be to promote faculty affir
mative action. He said his duties
in this vein would be "parallel
but separate" to the work the
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment does on behalf of staff
members.
Weisberg, who will teach a
reduced load of courses at the
Law School, said he is entering
the job with no definite plans on
how to help junior faculty.
Rather, he said, he hopes to inter
view faculty members to find out
what needs junior faculty have.
Rice suggested that one possi
ble area of examination is the fac
ulty mentor system and whether
the University is "turning out

potential candidates" for junior
faculty positions.

Weisberg suggested other
issues may include helping junior
faculty members prepare for the
tenure process and questions
about whether junior faculty are
given a sufficient opportunity to
conduct research or to teach the
courses they want to teach.
In other senate business,
English Prof. Ron Rebholz
addressed concerns to Rice and
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds about a recently
unveiled proposal that would put
the Office of Residential Educa
tion under the supervision of a
new administrative unit headed
by the director of Housing and
Dining Services. Rebholz ques
tioned whether the new arrange
ment would sap vitality from Res
Ed's operations.
Rice answered by contending
that as part of the proposal, a new
position will be created for a fac
ulty member to oversee the aca
demic objectives of Res Ed. "I see

positive developments in all of
this," she said. "I have some hope
that by appointing a faculty mem
ber to oversee the academic quali
ty of residential education ... we
can make sure (Res Ed's| educa
tion part is met."
Edmonds conceded that there is
"concern among (resident fellows)
in terms of going into a larger
operation," but argued that the
reorganization is "not a merger of
just two organizations, it's a merg
er of all residential components."
But Rebholz warned against
downplaying the importance of
Res Ed's everyday activities. "The
somewhat 24-hour, logistical
mechanics are intrinsic to Res
Ed's mission," he said.
"I recognize the 24-hour obli
gation," Edmonds said. "But
when you're looking at the need
for budget-cutting, you have to
think about efficiency as well as
effectiveness.
"If there wasn't a need for clar
ity, we wouldn't have to deal with
it," she said.
