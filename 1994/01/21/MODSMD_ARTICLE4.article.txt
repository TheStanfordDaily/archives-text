For soccer freaks with fast dialing fin
gers and thick wallets, there are still 18,000
seats left for the six World Cup soccer
matches to be held at Stanford Stadium in
June and July.
Pat Saign of Saign & Associates, a Los
Altos marketing firm representing World
Cup Soccer at Stanford, said that although
tickets for individual games are completely
sold out, there are still about 3,000 premier
packages remaining for the six Stanford
games. The packages — which include one
midfield, sunny side ticket for each game
are available in silver, gold and platinum
versions priced at $725, $2,900, and
$10,000 respectively. About 5,500 of the
packages have already been sold.
The World Cup is an international soccer
tournament held every four years. This
year, the tournament will take place in the
United States.
Don Shultie of World Cup USA in Los
Angeles said that although the constant

(low of tickets makes it impossible to tell ex
actly how many packages are left, "there are
still tickets left." Shultie said he expected
the remaining premier packages to sell out
"within a month or a month and a half at
the latest."
Saign said the premier ticket packages
were not selling quickly because "the Amer
ican public doesn't have a clue . . . how big
the event is." He said he feared that by the
time Northern California realizes the sig
nificance of the event, it will be too late to
purchase tickets.
Rick La Plante, a spokesperson for World
Cup USA 1994 said, "Our passion for sports
in this country is nothing" compared to the
international passion for soccer. He said,
however, that American enthusiasm for
soccer is growing, pointing to the growth of
youth soccer leagues across the nation and
faster-than-expected sales of individual
match tickets.
