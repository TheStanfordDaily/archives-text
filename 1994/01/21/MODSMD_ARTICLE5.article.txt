## Steam shortage deprives campus of heat, hot water 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
Stanford's warm winter weather was a
little less steamy yesterday.
A midday equipment failure at the Uni
versity's power plant left the campus with
out steam, which is used to heat Stanford's
buildings and water.
At around 12:30 p.m., a steam-driven tur
bine at the Cardinal Cogeneration Plant
failed, according to William Witscher, direc
tor of facilities operations. That seems to
have caused another turbine — this one fu
eled by natural gas — to stop working as well
Since the heat created by the gas turbine
is used to make steam, when the turbine

stopped so did the steam heat, Witscher said.
Back-up boilers were being used yester
day evening to restore steam to campus,
said Assoc. Vice Provost for Facilities Kernel
Dawkins.
Witscher said the University does not yet
know what caused the turbines to fail, and
probably would not know until today.
Dawkins said such a failure at the cogener
ator is "not something that happens often,
but it is something that happens."
Meanwhile, the lack of steam left some
Stanford students out in the cold yesterday.
Freshman Patrick Eiken said the lack of
heated water left him taking an — unwant-
Ed — cold shower.
"The water was, like, not
warm," he said, "lukewarm. Bare
ly bearable."
The steam stoppage also affect
ed food service, as students at
Wilbur dining hall had to eat off

paper plates with plastic utensils.
The dearth of steam had made
washing the everyday dishes
impossible.
While back-up boilers provided
steam last night, the moist mists
are normally created by the gas
turbine, Witscher said. The tur
bine is used to create electricity,
but also generates heat, which is
used to boil water and make
steam.

That steam is used in two
ways, Witscher continued. First,
the steam turns another turbine,
generating more electricity for
the campus. The remaining steam
is then used to heat the campus.
Witscher said that electricity
still flowed through campus when
both generators failed because the
University has a hook-up with
Pacific Gas and Electric that pro
vides emergency electrical power.
