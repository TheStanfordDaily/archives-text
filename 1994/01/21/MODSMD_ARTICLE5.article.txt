out steam, which is used to heat Stanford's

At around 12:30 p.m., a steam-driven tur
bine at the Cardinal Cogeneration Plant

Since the heat created by the gas turbine
is used to make steam, when the turbine

stopped so did the steam heat, Witscher said.
Back-up boilers were being used yester
day evening to restore steam to campus,
said Assoc. Vice Provost for Facilities Kernel
Dawkins.
Witscher said the University does not yet

probably would not know until today.
Dawkins said such a failure at the cogener
ator is "not something that happens often,
but it is something that happens."
Meanwhile, the lack of steam left some
Stanford students out in the cold yesterday.
Freshman Patrick Eiken said the lack of
heated water left him taking an — unwant-
