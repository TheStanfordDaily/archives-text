# CUE head reports progress to Fac Sen

### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Faculty members had a chance to
voice concerns and make suggestions
about the progress of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education yesterday.
In his quarterly report to the Faculty
Senate, History Prof. James Sheehan,
the commission's chair, both outlined
the accomplishments his group has
made since it began working last quarter
and asked the senators for their input.
"We are still at the pleasant stage
where our options remain open. Final

choices have not been made," he said.
Sheehan proceeded to describe the
eight subcommittees appointed by the
commission to examine certain facets of
the undergraduate experience in depth.
The subcommittees — which are made up
of faculty and students — will examine a
variety of topics, including majors, breadth
requirements and "Technique and Tech
nology in Teaching and Learning."
Issues that overlap several topics,
such as overseas studies and questions
regarding students of color, will be
spread among the other groups as they
come up, Sheehan said.

Although the working groups will
spend the next few months examining
the specifics of an undergraduate educa
tion at Stanford, Sheehan said the com
mission recognizes that one of its larger
responsibilities is to define the values and
goals of the total undergraduate experi
ence at a research-oriented university.
Faculty members spent about an
hour asking questions and making sug
gestions. For the most part, the sena
tors' comments and queries were direct
ed toward concerns about the studv of
distribution requirements and
majors.
History Prof. David Kennedy,
who said he has heard many stu
dents complain about "lack of
coherence and logic" in the sys
tem of distribution requirements,
asked Sheehan whether the com
mission's final report would "sim
ply comment on the adequacy or
the inadequacy of the current sys
tem" or in fact suggest a whole
new arrangement for distribution
requirements.
Sheehan responded to Kennedy
that "the best way to test the

established system [of distribution
requirements) is to consider alter
natives to it."
However, Sheehan acknowl
edged that the present system
has several strengths, and that
"the status quo in institutions
almost always has a certain
advantage ... all of which sug
gests that, when the time comes,
I don't think you'll have to worry
that this system will be swept
away."
In the realm of majors, Shee
han said the working group on
majors will define "the ingredi
ents of a successful major" rather
than study each different major
program individually.
But some senators said they
worried that defining exactly

what a successful major should
contain would place serious con
straints on some departments and
would be too difficult to enforce
across the many different disci
plines at the University.
While Sheehan assured the
senators that the commission
recognizes the "extraordinary
variety" among departments and
does not plan to set up strict
University-wide requirements
for a major, he stressed the value
of attempting to come up with
some definition for a successful
major.
"It is not our intention to come
down like a bunch of commissars
and impose gridlock on all depart
ments," he said. "But it does
make sense to try to say what a

major should have."
In addition to their concerns,
senators had a number of sugges
tions regarding the subcommit
tees' scope and methods.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz sug
gested that the subcommittee on
the writing requirement conduct
a survey over the entire Universi
ty to determine "to what extent
departments believe writing is a
part of learning."
In answer to comments by
Operations Research Prof. Curtis
Eaves that the commission
seemed to be focusing more on the
humanities side of the University,
Sheehan said that "quantitative
skills are folded into the breadth
requirements committee ... we
have not forgotten that quantita

tive skills are a proficiency no less
vital."
Despite the by most of
the senators on the specifics of
undergraduate education and on
the subcommittees, some faculty
members asked Sheehan about
the larger function of the commis
sion itself
"There's an inherent accep
tance that at the end of the day,
it will be business as usual, with
some changes but no fundamen
tal changes," said Civil Engineer
ing Prof. Jeff Koseff. "The
nature of these subcommittees
does not reflect the fact that
alternative forms — and I'm
talking about the whole educa
tional system — really have
been addressed."

Sheehan responded that the
committees, despite their speci
ficity, are the best way to come up
with alternatives. "We came to a
conclusion that whatever we did
had to involve us in learning more
about what we're doing. . . . The
subcommittees represent an
opportunity for quarrying what
we should do out of what we do
do," he said.

After the meeting, Sheehan
said he felt the discussion had
been valuable. "People were inter
ested, they had good ideas, they
pushed us when they needed to
and raised some good points," he
said. He added that he would have
to think about whether he would
act on any of the senators' sugges
tions.

dents complain about "lack of
coherence and logic" in the sys
tem of distribution requirements,
asked Sheehan whether the com
mission's final report would "sim
ply comment on the adequacy or
the inadequacy of the current sys
tem" or in fact suggest a whole
new arrangement for distribution
requirements.
Sheehan responded to Kennedy
that "the best way to test the

established system [of distribution
requirements) is to consider alter
natives to it."
However, Sheehan acknowl
edged that the present system
has several strengths, and that
"the status quo in institutions
almost always has a certain
advantage ... all of which sug
gests that, when the time comes,
I don't think you'll have to worry
that this system will be swept
away."
In the realm of majors, Shee
han said the working group on
majors will define "the ingredi
ents of a successful major" rather
than study each different major
program individually.
But some senators said they
worried that defining exactly

what a successful major should
contain would place serious con
straints on some departments and
would be too difficult to enforce
across the many different disci
plines at the University.
While Sheehan assured the
senators that the commission
recognizes the "extraordinary
variety" among departments and
does not plan to set up strict
University-wide requirements
for a major, he stressed the value
of attempting to come up with
some definition for a successful
major.
"It is not our intention to come
down like a bunch of commissars
and impose gridlock on all depart
ments," he said. "But it does
make sense to try to say what a

major should have."
In addition to their concerns,
senators had a number of sugges
tions regarding the subcommit
tees' scope and methods.
English Prof. Ron Rebholz sug
gested that the subcommittee on
the writing requirement conduct
a survey over the entire Universi
ty to determine "to what extent
departments believe writing is a
part of learning."
In answer to comments by
Operations Research Prof. Curtis
Eaves that the commission
seemed to be focusing more on the
humanities side of the University,
Sheehan said that "quantitative
skills are folded into the breadth
requirements committee ... we
have not forgotten that quantita

tive skills are a proficiency no less
vital."
Despite the by most of
the senators on the specifics of
undergraduate education and on
the subcommittees, some faculty
members asked Sheehan about
the larger function of the commis
sion itself
"There's an inherent accep
tance that at the end of the day,
it will be business as usual, with
some changes but no fundamen
tal changes," said Civil Engineer
ing Prof. Jeff Koseff. "The
nature of these subcommittees
does not reflect the fact that
alternative forms — and I'm
talking about the whole educa
tional system — really have
been addressed."

Sheehan responded that the
committees, despite their speci
ficity, are the best way to come up
with alternatives. "We came to a
conclusion that whatever we did
had to involve us in learning more
about what we're doing. . . . The
subcommittees represent an
opportunity for quarrying what
we should do out of what we do
do," he said.

After the meeting, Sheehan
said he felt the discussion had
been valuable. "People were inter
ested, they had good ideas, they
pushed us when they needed to
and raised some good points," he
said. He added that he would have
to think about whether he would
act on any of the senators' sugges
tions.
