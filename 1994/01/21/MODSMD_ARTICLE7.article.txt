# Taking matters into their own hands
## Student group aims to stop Bosnian war 
### Allison Short Staff writer 
Instead of merely reading about escalating vio
lence in Bosnia in the New York Times, several
Stanford students decided to take action and stop
the genocide, forming an organization which is
quickly gaining popularity throughout the nation.
Students Against Genocide (SAGE), which
emerged last spring as a division of the California
Coalition Against Ethnic Cleansing, became an
independent group with a "more directed ap
proach" in October, said founder and President
Brad Blitz.
Blitz, an international education graduate stu
dent, became distressed when he read about the
"ethnic cleansing" taking place in Bosnia — initial
ly trying to encourage members of the Jewish Stu
dent Association at Stanford to endorse advertise
ments opposing the U S's actions.
"I was outraged at what I saw," Blitz said "My
involvement (in SAGE) came from my own sense of
awareness and need for political commitment."
