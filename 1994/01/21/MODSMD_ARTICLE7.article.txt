# Taking matters into their own hands
## Student group aims to stop Bosnian war 
### Allison Short Staff writer 
Instead of merely reading about escalating vio
lence in Bosnia in the New York Times, several
Stanford students decided to take action and stop
the genocide, forming an organization which is
quickly gaining popularity throughout the nation.
Students Against Genocide (SAGE), which
emerged last spring as a division of the California
Coalition Against Ethnic Cleansing, became an
independent group with a "more directed ap
proach" in October, said founder and President
Brad Blitz.
Blitz, an international education graduate stu
dent, became distressed when he read about the
"ethnic cleansing" taking place in Bosnia — initial
ly trying to encourage members of the Jewish Stu
dent Association at Stanford to endorse advertise
ments opposing the U S's actions.
"I was outraged at what I saw," Blitz said "My
involvement (in SAGE) came from my own sense of
awareness and need for political commitment."

Students Against Genocide (SAGE), which emerged last spring as
a division of the California Coalition Against Ethnic Cleansing, has
become an independent group led by graduate student Brad Blitz.
As a result, students Sheri
Fink, Shannon Fischer and Blitz
formed SAGE in order to stop
genocide, raise awareness through
educational events and lift the
arms restraint against the Bosni
an government, Blitz said.
"This is a genocide and we can
stop it," Blitz said. "There needs
to be assurances such as food and
supplies. The West needs to make
sure that Bosnia can survive."
Currently, various committees
and public donations have provid
ed SAGE with supplies and on
campus office space. As a result, a
core of a dozen students are active
ly involved with the organization,
with up to 50 students participat
ing in meetings, Blitz said.
"1 think that as people realize
they can participate and gain a

better understanding, it will
grow," Blitz said.
Blitz hopes to increase the
community's awareness of Bosni
an issues with several planned
activities during National Bosni
an Awareness month in Febru
ary. The group will begin with a
dorm outreach program, in which
they will visit several dorms and
present a film that Blitz said rais
es and answers questions about
Bosnian devastation.
The film discusses, among
other things, "how Sarajevo
changed from an Olympic city to
one of devastation and violence in
just ten years," Blitz said.
Students will then be able to par
ticipate in refuge support, which
involves helping refuges write
resumes, teaching them "simple
absorption skills" or simply taking
them out to a park for the day, Blitz
said.
In addition, the group will begin
February with a candlelight vigil

on campus, followed by the group's
main event, titled "BosniAid: an
Evening of Hope and Action for
Bosnia," which will take place Feb.
15 in Memorial Auditorium.
The group expects former Sec
retary of State George Shultz,
Pulitzer Prize-winning author Roy
Gutman ("Witness to Genocide"),
Bosnian Ambassador to the Unit
ed Nations Muhammed Sacirbey
and former State Department
Official Stephen Walker to attend.
Blitz, who is trying to use Stan
ford as a forum to raise aware
ness, said he believes SAGE's
influence will continue to grow.
SAGE has already opened an
office this month in Washington,
D C. where an office coordinator
corresponds with Blitz.
"I'm encouraged by the gener
ally favorable action," Blitz said.
"The people believe something
should be organized. I think we've
achieved stage one of raising con
sciousness."
