### Cindy Yu Staff writer 
Dim sum, bao, egg rolls and potstickers are just
a few of the items on the menu of the new and
improved Teahouse, which opened last night for
the first time this year.
The Teahouse had not opened since the end of
last year due to organizational difficulties. "Basi
cally, there was no one to take charge last quar
ter," said junior Polly Liu, one of its managers.
Located between Okada and East Wilbur Dining
Hall, the Teahouse is Stanford's Asian version of
Stern's Late Night and the Terrace at Toyon. It is
open Sunday through Thursday from 10 p.m. to

midnight to serve as "a place where people can hang
out late at night and eat cheap Asian food," Liu said.
According to Liu, this reorganization has made
the Teahouse much more business-oriented. "The
management is more committed now . . . we're
putting a lot of time into it," Liu said. In addition,
as part of its grand opening last night, Teahouse
managers conducted a survey to determine what
foods interest their customers.
Among the Asian delicacies offered are ichiban
sapporo noodles and siu mai. Teahouse managers
also hope to expand the menu to include fried rice
and chow mein, courtesy of local Asian restaurants.
The Teahouse began as part of the Asian
American Student Association in 1971.
