# Perry to pass up defense post?

Staff and wire reports

WASHINGTON - Stanford
engineering Prof. William J. Perry,
the leading candidate for secretary
of defense, expressed misgivings
over the weekend about assuming
the job, Pentagon officials said yes
terday.
The New York Times reported
today that Perry told White
House chief of staff Thomas
MacLarty that he does not want
the job in a telephone conversa
tion on Saturday.
Over the weekend, Perry re
portedly told friends he was reluc
tant to become involved in the
often-bruising battles common to
the job, the Times reported. His
wife also reiterated his preference
for staying behind the scenes, the
newspaper said.
But last night, White House
communications director Mark
Gearan took the unusual step of
publicly statingthat Perry, current
ly the deputy secretary of defense,
was still "very much in the run
ning" and that preliminary back
ground checks had already begun.
An administration official, who
asked not to be identified, told the
Associated Press yesterday that
while Perry had expressed some
reservations about the high-profile
post, he has subsequently voiced
"affirmative interest."
Facing a potentially embar
rassing situation if the fourth
candidate considered for the posi
tion backs out, the White House
immediately put the pressure on
Perry. Later on Saturday, Vice
President A 1 Gore called Perry
and told him he could not let
President Clinton down at such a
moment.
If nominated and confirmed,
Perry would replace Les Aspin,

who was forced out of the job last
month. Perry has widely been
considered the front-runner for
the post after Ret. Admiral Bobby
Ray Inman — Clinton's first
choice for the job — backed out
last week. Two other candidates,
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga. and for
mer Sen. Warren Rudman of New
Hampshire told the president
they didn't want the job.
Perry, 66, had a discussion
with Clinton on Friday about the
job in what was described as a
"warm session," but no offer was
formally made, officials said.
One Pentagon official described
Perry to the Times as "the last
man standing" in the search for

Aspin's replacement. Aspin has
agreed to stay on until his succes
sor is confirmed.
A military expert with experi
ence in academia, government
and business. Perry is widely
respected in Congress and in the
Pentagon. He was formerly co
director of Stanford's Center for
International Security and Arms
Control.
As deputy defense secretary,
one of Perry's major challenges
has been to reform the Pen
tagon's cumbersome $100 million
procurement system, but his
efforts have met with resistance
from both military officers and
government contractors.
