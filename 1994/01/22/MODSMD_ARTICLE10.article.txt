Massacre in Colombia

APARTADO, Colombia (AP) — (lunmen
believed to be leftist rebels fired automatic
weapons at revelers at an early morning street
party yesterday, killing at least 33 people and
wounding eight, authorities said.
The massacre in Apartado, a poverty-stricken
town of wood-plank shacks and cement store
fronts 300 miles northwest of Bogota, was the
bloodiest in Colombia in more than live years. It
was unclear if the attack was politically motivated.
But authorities immediately blamed leftist
rebels, who have been attacking members of
the Hope, Peace and Freedom Party, formed by
former guerrillas.
The rebels consider party members to be
traitors for abandoning the armed struggle to
impose a Cuban-style government in Colombia.
