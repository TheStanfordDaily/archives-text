# Clinton to expand crime package in address
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AF) - President
Clinton plans to expand his anti-crime
package with the State of the Union
address, supporting a "three-time
loser" proposal to put the most violent
felons in jail for life, administration
officials said yesterday.
With polls showing crime as voters'
No.l concern, White House speech
writers are making sure Clinton's
tough-on-thugs plans don't get lost in
tomorrow's sweeping speech to
Congress.
"Crime started out as a small com
ponent and got larger. It's going to be
a significant portion of the speech,"
said a White House aide helping to
draft the speech.
In general, the State of the Union
address is expected to review Clinton's
first year in office, set goals for 1994

and repeat his key messages on a num
ber of issues, including health aire,
welfare, crime, economic reform, edu
cation and foreign policy. He will not
unveil many new details of proposed
programs in the speech, which aides
said had not been completed yesterday.
"The president wants to talk to the
American people about what he has
accomplished, to tell them how he is
doing the objectives he laid out — not
only in the campaign but in the start
of his presidency," Press Secretary
Dee Dee Myers said
Clinton, who campaigned as a "new
Democrat," has slowly chipped away
at the Republicans' traditional reputa
tion as tougher on crime. He has sup
ported a crime bill that includes
100,000 new police on city streets,
boot camps for young, non-violent

offenders and a ban on some semiau
tomatic weapons.
Expanding his gun control stance,
the president recently asked the Jus
tice Department to study whether gun
owners should undergo the same type
of licensing requirements as drivers.
Attorney General Janet Reno said
yesterday her department has not com
pleted that study yet. Aides said the
president is not likely to firm up his sup
port for the idea in tomorrow's speech.
But he is expected to endorse a pro
posal that would require lifetime jail sen
tences for people convicted of three vio
lent felonies, said two administration
officials, including the White House aide.
Both spoke on condition of anonymity .
Appearing yesterday on NBC's
"Meet the Press," Reno declined to say
whether Clinton supported the "three

time loser" concept. She did say the
administration wants to crack down
on repeat offenders.
"We've got to identify the truly bad
and put them away," she said.
Clinton also will broadly promote
administration plans to put a greater
emphasis on drug treatment and pre
vention programs, aides said.
White House drug control director
Lee Brown said yesterday that most
violent crime is linked to drug usage.
"So our policy will start off with the
first major goal of reducing the
demand for drugs, particularly the
chronic hard-core drug user," he said.
The high-profile anti-crime pitch
will come on the heels of a New York
Times-CBS News poll showing that
concern over crime and violence has
become the nation's No.l worry.
