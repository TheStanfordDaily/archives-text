## Editorial Accountability: Yes

Proposed amendment
in a refined form could
make ASSU responsive

IT'S WINTER Quarter. Do you
know who your ASSU senator
is? If you're like almost every
other Stanford student, you proba
bly have no idea.
You don't have to be a political
science major to see the problem
this creates for the student govern
ment: When accountability doesn't
exist, voters' needs go unnoticed
and unaddressed, making them
question the need for a government
at all. Sound familiar?
Fortunately, undergraduate sen
ator Gabe Lucas has written a draft
of a constitutional amendment
whose final form could very well fix
this problem.
The most important point of the
bill is the division of the under
graduate senate by residential dis
trict and by class, so that a junior
living in Toyon, for example, would
have representatives in the senate
both from Toyon and from the
junior class. This would be a vast
improvement over the present sys
tem, in which graduate senators
have districts by school while
undergraduates are elected at
large.
Most undergraduate senators
would be elected from the districts
in which they live. This shift would
allow students to get to know their
senators and to interact with them
on a regular and informal basis —
for example, at meals.
Importantly, other at-large
undergraduate senators represent
ing each class would be elected to
concentrate on issues pertinent to
specific years at Stanford. Just as
graduate students have different
needs from undergraduates,
seniors are at different points in
their lives from freshmen, and
have different concerns.
Furthermore, class senators
would help generate the healthy

sense of class identity that is so
often missing from the Stanford
experience.
Class representation would
also ensure that students who
study abroad or who stop out
would have a senator to speak to
upon their return.
Perhaps the most controversial
aspect of the bill is a clause that
reduces the number of undergrad
uate senators from 20 to 10. This is
intended to allow senators to "bet
ter work together, [and] to hold
meetings more often."
On the other hand, reducing the
number of senators would make it
more difficult for interested stu
dents to participate in the ASSU.
This issue is important for the sen
ate to discuss, but should be debat
ed separately from the districting
proposal.
As Lucas' bill recognizes, ASSU
elections would have to be moved
from the spring to the fall, after
students have moved into their
new residences. However, stu
dents would have more of a
chance to hear and question the
platforms of the senators from
their district in dorm discussions,
and freshmen would be able to
vote.
The senate's work would also
benefit. As it stands now, most of
spring quarter is dominated by
senators' campaigning. If the elec
tions were in the first few weeks of
fall quarter, senators would spend
less time campaigning and more
time fulfilling their campaign
promises.
Finally, early discussions of
Lucas' bill included a change in the
executive branch that would have
reinstated a single student body
president instead of the currently
co-equal members of the Council of
Presidents.
True accountability requires
that a single individual be responsi
ble for the actions of the organiza
tion, rather than an amorphous
council.
Come spring quarter, students
might actually know who their rep
resentatives are. And that would be
a serious improvement.
