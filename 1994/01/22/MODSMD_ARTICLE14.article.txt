## A 						short and final charter 
### 
I'M 5 FEET 3 INCHES and I'm proud
to admit it. Whatever you want to call
it: vertically challenged, height-defi
cient, altitudinally insufficient, elevation
arily inadequate, permanently slouched,
loftily scanty. Simply put, I am short.
I've seen many others around campus
and have talked to them in secret. Many
times, I've had to console them, to let
them talk about their feelings after being
kicked off the IM basketball team, after
having their heads palmed by "friends,"
after being offered a booster seat at
Denny's.
The truth needs to be told. This soci
ety has ingrained into our minds that
being tall is good while being short is a
sin. In "Webster's New World The
saurus," synonyms for "tall" include
"big, great, towering, lofty, elevated,"
while "short" is compared to "low,
skimpy, slight, dwarfish, stubby, stunted,
dumpy, deficient, insufficient, meager,"
etc. The list, and the injustice, goes on.
But now it's time for us to break our
silence. I proudly announce the charter
of:
SUPER: Stanford Union of Poorly
Elevated Runts.
Now, of course, people everywhere
will be asking if the formation of this
rather specialized group will promote
separatism among all the students here,
creating an uneasy atmosphere of com
peting and exclusive cliques.
To these critics I say yes, this group is

rather exclusive with strict height
requirements for membership. However,
I have a legitimate reason to form it. You
see, this association is necessary for
(What else?) the survival of the human
race on this planet. Maybe an example
will help me explain what I mean.
Since the beginning of the school year,
I've been doing research to respond to
those pseudo-intellectuals who have
attacked my theory that the dinosaurs
all committed suicide in an unusually
intense depression brought on by unre
quited love. After much discussion, soul
searching and meditation, the result of
this research is the following theory:
Long ago, while in its normal orbit
around the star we now call our sun, the
earth, for reasons still unknown, per
haps on a whim of global proportions,
very suddenly stopped and turned to spin
in the other direction, like a good Vien
nese waltz. Let's say that this entire pro
cess took 10 seconds. Then, because the
earth, with a circumference of about
25,000 miles, or 40,225 kilometers, has a
period of 24 hours, a dinosaur, say, on
the surface would be traveling at over
465 meters per second, or faster than the
speed of sound at sea level (434 m/s). And
thus, a complete change of direction in
10 seconds would subject everything on
the earth's surface to 9.5 G's of accelera
tion.
Now that would put your average 40-
ton dinosaur under 760,000 pounds (3.4

million Newtons) of force for 10 seconds.
Plugging this into the range equation for
maximum range without air resistance,
this would keep the dinosaur airborne
two minutes and 14 seconds, longer than
most heavy weight boxing title fights,
and throw poor defenseless Barney 88.4
kilometers, or just under 55 miles.
Quod erat demonstrandum.
Now, the much shorter furry, cute,
warm-blooded mammals, along with the
cockroaches, birds and salamanders,
held on to dear life by hanging on to a
well-rooted tree or by burrowing under
ground while their taller cold-blooded,
puny-brained companions sailed over
head to their solemn graves.
As you can clearly see, this society
that selects the tall and oppresses the
short must learn the error of its ways
because someday, when we least expect
it, the earth may just get bored and
decide to turn again.
And for this reason, SUPER must be
formed. We must bond together because,
not only do we have to be proud of our
stature, but we could be the future of
this great world.

7hai thanks all the little people that
helped bring these columns to the Stan
ford community.
