## Alternative Spring Break now includes quake relief 
### 
BECAUSE OF THE 6.6 earth
quake which shook Southern
California and left it devastated
overnight, we see an apparent and
immediate need for helping efforts of
volunteers. Alternative Spring Break
is grateful to The Daily for making
the Stanford community conscious of
this vital need and for suggesting a
new project geared towards helping
the earthquake victims.
In response â€” to create an oppor
tunity for the Stanford community to

lend a helping hand to the affected
Southern California communities,
Alternative Spring Break has decided
to change this year's "Homelessness
in L.A." into the "Homelessness/
Earthquake Relief in L.A." project.
Through this new project more fitting
to the present situation, students will
become directly involved with future
relief efforts for the earthquake vic
tims in addition to learning more
about the homelessness issues in Los
Angeles.

The earthquake has once again
reminded us of the needs of those who
are dislocated from their homes and
disrupted from their usual daily lives.
With Spring Break only two months
away, we want the student body to
take this opportunity to give a part of
themselves and reconsider their
Spring Break plans. We would like to
send as many students as we can to
Southern California, and we are also
looking for two new student leaders.
And just for the

"Homelessness/Earthquake Relief in
L.A." project, we will extend our lead
ers' and participants' application
deadline to Friday, Jan. 28. Come to
the Clearinghouse at the Haas Center
for Public Service and pick up an
application! In order to subsidize addi
tional members any donation will be
welcomed.
