# Bears learn that it takes 2 halves to win
## Stanford women outscore Cal by 20 in second period for 92-75 victory in Berekey

BERKELEY — For a while, it looked
like turnabout would indeed be fair play.
Following Stanford's stunning home
upset of its archrival in men's action the
previous night, the California women's
basketball team played with inspiration
and hopes of returning the favor on Friday
evening. ,
However, the lOth-ranked Cardinal (11-
3, 4-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference) over
came early lapses, and a near-record crowd
of 3,628 at hostile Harmon Gymnasium, to
overpower the unranked Golden Bears (7-
8, 1-4) 92-75 and earn its fourth-straight
victory and first in Harmon since 1991.
Cal seized a 40-35 halftime lead using a
stingy zone defense and hot shooting from
starting sophomore forwards Kerri Barrett
(5-of-6, 12 first-half points) and Kelley
Tatum (4-of-5, 10).
Yet Stanford closed the gap after the
intermission, and, with her team trailing
58-57 at a television timeout with 11:43
remaining, head coach Tara VanDerveer
installed a full-court press defense. The
strategy worked brilliantly, as the Golden
Bears committed eight turnovers in their
next 12 possessions to key the Cardinal on
a 24-9 run that effectively put the game
away at 82-66 with 4:41 left.
"That was a great run for us," Van-
Derveer said. "We're not a spurty team,
but that was a big spurt. We've gone about
things more surgically this year, and it was
good to get that run. My team can never
score too fast for me."
The points came very quickly, as three
of Stanford's stars pumped in six points
apiece during the blazing assault. Fresh
man point guard Jamila Wideman (10
points, a career-high 11 assists) started it
with back-to-back three pointers, the sec
ond of which gave the Cardinal a 63-60
advantage and a lead it would never relin

quish. Freshman forward Kate Starbird,
who would finish with 12 points off the
bench, then worked the baseline for two
consecutive layups and, after stealing a Cal
inbounds pass, two free throws.
Senior guard Christy Hedgpeth then got
into the act, converting a three-point play
and nailing a three-point shot en route to a
career-high 26 points.
"My teammates were screening for
me, and Jamila and Kate (Paye) were
getting me the ball. It just happened
that things were going my way," said
Hedgpeth of a night in which she made
10 of 18 shots, including five of Stan
ford's team and conference record-tying
12 three-pointers.
The Cardinal comeback came as only a
mild surprise to Golden Bears coach Gooch
Foster, whose strategy coming into the
game involved forcing Stanford to connect
from the outside.
"They missed a lot of shots in the first
half that they made in the second half,"
Foster said. "But we played a great game,
and made Stanford do what they had to do
to beat us."
Specifically, the Cardinal rebounded
from a terrible .417 (15-of-36) first-period
shooting percentage to hit .639 (23-of-36)
in the second stanza, with many of the bas
kets coming on fast-break layups resulting
from the press. Junior center Anita Kaplan
(18 points, five rebounds on the night),
who contributed to the improvement with
six-of-eight shooting on the half, also
sealed the victory with an 8-0 run in the
closing minutes.
Lost amid Stanford's blinding finish,
however, was an anticipated matchup of
the teams' leading scorers that never mate
rialized.
