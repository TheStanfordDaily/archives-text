## Men's volleyball bumbles Penn State series 
### Kathryn Yang Editorial staff 
A hectic roadtrip in sub-zero weather
was not the only thing the Cardinal had
to overcome this weekend, as Penn State
flexed its volleyball muscle en route to a
2-1 series victory over Stanford.
On Thursday, the No. 4 Cardinal (1-
3) shipped out to Pennsylvania with all
the confidence in the world after sur
prising the preseason volleyball pollsters
with a second-place showing at the pres
tigious UC-Santa Barbara Tournament.
Tenth-ranked Penn State (2-1), how
ever, proved to be more than the Cardi

nal could handle.
After a canceled plane trip and a
three-hour bus ride, Stanford arrived at
University Park just in time to be
pounded by the Lions, 15-13, 15-4, 15-6.
"I told the team after the game that
we were just outplayed in all areas," said
head coach Ruben Nieves. "Fundamen
tally we did not pass particularly well
that night, and serving and passing are
the nuts and bolts of volleyball."
Indeed, from the service line, Stan
ford was only able to place two service
aces with 15 service errors, whereas the
Lions slammed down seven aces with
only seven errors.

In the only officially scored match of
the roadtrip, freshman Matt Fuer
bringer did help the Cardinal effort
with a strong offensive night from his
opposite hitting position. Finishing the
night with 21 kills and only three
errors, Fuerbringer led all Stanford
attackers with a .439 hitting percent
age.
Overall, the Cardinal hit a mediocre
.371, as compared to the Lions' healthy
.411 attack.
"Three-seventy-one (percent) really
isn't very good for Stanford," said senior
outside hitter Joe Burghardt. "Mike
(Lambert) and I need to pass better in

order for Canyon (Ceman) to have a
chance to do the things he does so well."
The passing apparently did get better
during the second game, played at Coun
cil Rock High School, a five-hour bus
trip from the Lions' den.
"It was definitely a see-saw match,
but we managed to pull it out and sal
vage some part of the trip," said senior
middle blocker Brian Garrett.
The Cardinal flew past Penn State
15-8 in the first game and picked up
momentum with a 14-6 lead in the sec
ond game, before the Lions awoke to
battle back for a 16-14 victory.
Riding on the wave of that come
from-behind win, Penn State then
bagged the third game 15-12,
before the Cardinal could get in a
word edgewise with a 15-5 fourth
game triumph.
That sent the match into a fifth
game tie-breaker, which in colle
giate volleyball is played in a rally
scoring format — different from
the regular format because side
outs are counted as scores as well.
The Lions spotted Stanford to a
5-0 lead with this fast-paced style
before the they roared back to 14-
13 edge late in the game.
"It was just one of those match
es where everything just kept shift

ing back and forth," Nieves said.
"Both teams failed to capitalize on
lots of opportunities."
Characteristically, the Cardinal
managed to pull out the win with a
little help from a missed Penn State
opportunity and a lot of help from
an outstanding J.B. Taylor dig.
Fielding a serve from the Lions,
Stanford made a mistake by float
ing a pass over the net. The Lions
pounced on that chance at sealing
the victory, but the Cardinal's Tay
lor made a tremendous dig from the
back row to give Stanford a second
chance.
"It was the most exciting and
most emotional moment of the
series," Nieves said. "We were bare
ly able to scrape out a win."
Freshman middle blocker Brian
Moore then served out the game
and put the match on ice with an

ace to win, 16-14.
After that high point in the
series, everything tumbled down
hill, as Penn State completed the
series win with a 15-13, 15-9, 17-16
sweep in the third match, played at
Pennsylvania's Elizabeth College.
Despite being able to blame the
disappointing East Coast showing
on the frigid weather and the travel
conditions, Nieves insisted, "When
you get on the court, you're either
good enough or you're not."
The Cardinal will try to improve
on its consistency this week in
preparation for its first league
match of the season against Loyola
Marymount on Saturday at home.
"The Loyola match marks the
start of the critical part of the sea
son," Nieves said. "1-3 (record) is
okay for now, because we know we
can be very good."

the regular format because side
outs are counted as scores as well.
The Lions spotted Stanford to a
5-0 lead with this fast-paced style
before the they roared back to 14-
13 edge late in the game.
"It was just one of those match
es where everything just kept shift

ing back and forth," Nieves said.
"Both teams failed to capitalize on
lots of opportunities."
Characteristically, the Cardinal
managed to pull out the win with a
little help from a missed Penn State
opportunity and a lot of help from
an outstanding J.B. Taylor dig.
Fielding a serve from the Lions,
Stanford made a mistake by float
ing a pass over the net. The Lions
pounced on that chance at sealing
the victory, but the Cardinal's Tay
lor made a tremendous dig from the
back row to give Stanford a second
chance.
"It was the most exciting and
most emotional moment of the
series," Nieves said. "We were bare
ly able to scrape out a win."
Freshman middle blocker Brian
Moore then served out the game
and put the match on ice with an

ace to win, 16-14.
After that high point in the
series, everything tumbled down
hill, as Penn State completed the
series win with a 15-13, 15-9, 17-16
sweep in the third match, played at
Pennsylvania's Elizabeth College.
Despite being able to blame the
disappointing East Coast showing
on the frigid weather and the travel
conditions, Nieves insisted, "When
you get on the court, you're either
good enough or you're not."
The Cardinal will try to improve
on its consistency this week in
preparation for its first league
match of the season against Loyola
Marymount on Saturday at home.
"The Loyola match marks the
start of the critical part of the sea
son," Nieves said. "1-3 (record) is
okay for now, because we know we
can be very good."
