## Men's volleyball bumbles Penn State series 
### Kathryn Yang Editorial staff 
A hectic roadtrip in sub-zero weather
was not the only thing the Cardinal had
to overcome this weekend, as Penn State
flexed its volleyball muscle en route to a
2-1 series victory over Stanford.
On Thursday, the No. 4 Cardinal (1-
3) shipped out to Pennsylvania with all
the confidence in the world after sur
prising the preseason volleyball pollsters
with a second-place showing at the pres
tigious UC-Santa Barbara Tournament.
Tenth-ranked Penn State (2-1), how
ever, proved to be more than the Cardi

nal could handle.
After a canceled plane trip and a
three-hour bus ride, Stanford arrived at
University Park just in time to be
pounded by the Lions, 15-13, 15-4, 15-6.
"I told the team after the game that
we were just outplayed in all areas," said
head coach Ruben Nieves. "Fundamen
tally we did not pass particularly well
that night, and serving and passing are
the nuts and bolts of volleyball."
Indeed, from the service line, Stan
ford was only able to place two service
aces with 15 service errors, whereas the
Lions slammed down seven aces with
only seven errors.

In the only officially scored match of
the roadtrip, freshman Matt Fuer
bringer did help the Cardinal effort
with a strong offensive night from his
opposite hitting position. Finishing the
night with 21 kills and only three
errors, Fuerbringer led all Stanford
attackers with a .439 hitting percent
age.
Overall, the Cardinal hit a mediocre
.371, as compared to the Lions' healthy
.411 attack.
"Three-seventy-one (percent) really
isn't very good for Stanford," said senior
outside hitter Joe Burghardt. "Mike
(Lambert) and I need to pass better in

order for Canyon (Ceman) to have a
chance to do the things he does so well."
The passing apparently did get better
during the second game, played at Coun
cil Rock High School, a five-hour bus
trip from the Lions' den.
"It was definitely a see-saw match,
but we managed to pull it out and sal
vage some part of the trip," said senior
middle blocker Brian Garrett.
The Cardinal flew past Penn State
15-8 in the first game and picked up
momentum with a 14-6 lead in the sec
ond game, before the Lions awoke to
