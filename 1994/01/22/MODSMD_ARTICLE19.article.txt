# Women burn Arizona pair in deGuerre waters
## 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
They may live in the blisteringly hot Mojave
desert, but the women's swim squads from Arizona
and Arizona State discovered that Palo Alto is
where the heat really gets to you.
The Cardinal women declawed the Wildcats 211-
72 on Friday, then doused the Sun Devils on Satur
day 210-90. Message sent â€” if you can't stand the
heat, get out of deGuerre pool.
"I didn't really know what to expect, but I knew
that the competition would be within our own
team," said junior Jenny Thompson, who won the
50- and 100-yard freestyle races on both Friday and

Saturday. "Arizona State had a few good individu
als, but I think most important was that we learned
a lot about stategies in races."
Although no swimmer for Stanford qualified for
the NCAA tournament in the weekend's meets, the
squad is confident that the competitions were sim
ply the start of a long series of dual meets in the
season that should give plenty of opportunity for
qualifying. These two were the first dual match
ups of the season for the Cardinal, who extended
their dual-meet winning streak to 40 in a row.
Stanford has not lost a dual meet since the winter
of 1988.
"It's the first [set] of a four-week series of meets
that we're embarking on now," said senior Lea

Loveless, who won the 200 backstroke on Saturday
and swam on the Cardinal 200 medley relay team
that placed first. "We know that we're going to
have to race hard, but we have a lot of time before
we have to be at our best."
In addition to Thompson's other victories, she
also placed first in the 100 butterfly on Friday and
swam third leg in the victorious 200 medley relay
against Arizona State on Saturday.
"We had a lot of solid swims, but we weren't
quite as fast as we were in Texas in December,"
Thompson said. "But we're progressing towards
[the Pacific 10 Conference Championships)."
On Friday the Cardinal pulled off 13 wins out of
14 total events, and the following day Stanford cap
tured 12 of the 14 events from the Sun Devils. On
the whole the Cardinal performed up to par as a
team.
"1 didn't expect us to swim much faster,"
Thompson said. "We've been training really hard.
We're not concerned about these meets; it's the
meets later in the season that we're looking for
ward too."
Junior Becky Crowe edged Thompson in the 100
fly against Arizona State on Saturday by .1.5 sec
ond. Cardinal freshman Sarah Anderson creamed
the field in the 500 freestyle by nearly 10 seconds,
and Loveless won the 200 back by almost 9 seconds.
"We raced hard and had good times, and we're
going to get faster and faster," Loveless said. "This
is the start of phase two, as we start our dual meet
season."
Stanford captured all three placings in five
events on Saturday, and only in the 1,000 free did
Arizona State place two Sun Devils in the top three.
"We've got a schedule that we're following to
NCAAs," Thompson said, refering to the March
showdown in Indianapolis. "These dual meets are
good practice, but they're not important in the long
run."
Cardinal divers also showed well against Arizona
on Friday. Freshman Britt Matern took the one
meter title and classmate Stefanie Forrest took the
three-meter crown as the divers emulated their
swimming counterparts in dominating the Wild
cats.
For Stanford, the dual-meet season is generally
a time for the swimmers to toy with new ptrategies
and styles. And while each individual works at her
own pace, the team as a whole progresses along
with the success of the individuals.
"I'm very happy with my progress. I wasn't
expecting to swim so close to my goal times as I
did," Loveless said. "All of the swimmers are at a
different stage, but we are all moving along."
