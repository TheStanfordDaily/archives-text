Sixty-four teams vied for
mud-covered glory on Satur
day at the eighth annual
Kappa Alpha Mud Volleyball
tournament. Above, fresh

serves up a ball. Right, senior
Joe Croft, playing for Sigma
Chi, gets hosed off after a
game. The eventual winner
was a team from the Gradu
ate School of Business. The
event raised more than
$8,000 for the Muscular Dys
trophy Association. The
event, traditionally held in the
lakebed of Lake Lagunita,
was moved to Eucalyptus
Grove near Stanford Stadium
this year due to concern over
destroying the habitat of the
potentially endangered tiger
salamander.
