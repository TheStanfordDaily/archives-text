There were no surprises for the Stanford
men's swim team this weekend. The two-time
defending national champions took care of busi
ness in quick and orderly fashion, defeating
Pacific 10 Conference rivals Arizona on Friday
and Arizona State on Saturday, both at deGuerre
pool.
Stanford got its weekend off to a fast start Fri
day in the 400-yard medley relay. In a display of
the Cardinal's extrordinary quality and depth,
Stanford swept the top three places in the race,
led by the winning team of Brian Retterer, Tyler
Mayfield, Ray Carey and Scott Gagner.
The Cardinal went on to dominate the Wild
cats, winning seven of the nine individual races
on the way to a 169-70 victory. Sophomore Joe
Hudepohl led the way with top finishes in the
100- and 200-yard freestyles.
Despite the lopsided final score, there were
several exciting races, many of which featured
Stanford teammates racing each other to the
wall. In the 50 free, Bill Schell out-touched Ret
terer to win in a time of 20.59 seconds. The 200
butterfly was close from wire to wire, with
defending NCAA champion Carey edging Fddie
Parenti, 1:49.43 to 1:49.55.
The highlight of the meet came in the final
individual event, the 200 breaststoke, as junior
Kurt Grote erased Cardinal great John Moffet's
name from the record books for the second time
