# Men drown Devils, 'Cats

There were no surprises for the Stanford
men's swim team this weekend. The two-time
defending national champions took care of busi
ness in quick and orderly fashion, defeating
Pacific 10 Conference rivals Arizona on Friday
and Arizona State on Saturday, both at deGuerre
pool.
Stanford got its weekend off to a fast start Fri
day in the 400-yard medley relay. In a display of
the Cardinal's extrordinary quality and depth,
Stanford swept the top three places in the race,
led by the winning team of Brian Retterer, Tyler
Mayfield, Ray Carey and Scott Gagner.
The Cardinal went on to dominate the Wild
cats, winning seven of the nine individual races
on the way to a 169-70 victory. Sophomore Joe
Hudepohl led the way with top finishes in the
100- and 200-yard freestyles.
Despite the lopsided final score, there were
several exciting races, many of which featured
Stanford teammates racing each other to the
wall. In the 50 free, Bill Schell out-touched Ret
terer to win in a time of 20.59 seconds. The 200
butterfly was close from wire to wire, with
defending NCAA champion Carey edging Fddie
Parenti, 1:49.43 to 1:49.55.
The highlight of the meet came in the final
individual event, the 200 breaststoke, as junior
Kurt Grote erased Cardinal great John Moffet's
name from the record books for the second time
this season. Grote's time of
2:00.21 eclipsed Moffet's
deGuerre Pool record of 2:01.09.
Earlier this year, Grote broke the
Stanford team record set by Mof
fet in 1985.
Saturday was much of the
same, as the Sun Devils were
scorched 173-64. Stanford diver
James Edwards captured two
first-place finishes and Carey was
a double-winner, racing to victo
ries in the 200 individual medley
and the 200 fly.
"Time-wise, my IM was a good
swim," said Carey, who won the
event in a time of 1:54.01. "My fly
was slower than it has been this
season, but this was the first time
I've done the 200 IM and 200 fly
back-to-back, with just the 10-
minute diving break in between."
In the 200 fly, Carey trailed
teammate Clay Tippins through
the first 150 yards before win

ning, 1:50.34 to 1:50.83.
"I'm always happy to get a
win," Carey said. "Anytime you
win during the season, you gain
confidence. Everyone sees the
results, and they think, 'He's
winning 200 flys.' It puts you in a
good position for NCAAs."
Freestyler Dan Kanner, who
won the 500 free in 4:31.39, was
also pleased with his perfor
mance. "It was a solid swim for
the conditions, and for the way
my body is feeling. I'm looking
forward to some rest. It was nice
to not have the pressure of going
as fast as you can and beating the
guy next to you. I was able to
work on some things like turns
and pace."
Kanner and the rest of the
team will continue to focus their
training on the Pac-10 and NCAA
Championships in March.
"We're right where we want to
be, where we need to be," Kenney
continued. "I'd say as a team I'm
really excited in our perfor
mance."
