# Cardinal slammed Grapplers fall to No. 17 Roadrunners by fifteen
## 
### Allyson Mizoguehi Staff writer 
Although the Cardinal wrestlers have gained a
great deal of experience and skill since the start of their
season, it wasn't enough to beat Cal State-Bakersfield
on Saturday as Stanford fell 24-9 to the 17th-ranked
Roadrunners. The defeat drops the Cardinal's dual
meet record to 2-3.
Head coach Chris Horpel could not point to a cen
tral reason for the loss, but indicated that small tech
nicalities in training could have prevented the disap
pointment.
"It was the little things that started a chain reac
tion," said Horpel. He noted that a momentary lapse of
focus or one minor mistake was enough to changp the
outcome of several of the matches.
The meet began on a shaky note as the first three
Cardinal starters lost their matches. Junior Ramy
Saad at 118 lbs. could not hold o(T the crisp attacks of
Roadrunner Bobby Soto, losing 16-6. This match was
followed by sophomore Matt Cano (126) and junior co
captain Jay Jackson (134), who both narrowly lost to
their opponents.
Horpel believed that Cano lost his match due to
seemingly small errors and ques
tionable officiating. Cano and team
mate Soren Murphy were scoreless
at the end of the first period, but
Cano succumbed to a takedown in
both the second and third periods to
give Murphy the win.
Jackson and Roadrunner fresh
man Tony DeSouza matched up
again after several previous encoun
ters during the season. DeSouza
was penalized for stalling in the first
period, as he continually clung on to
Jackson, hooking his right leg
around the wrestler. DeSouza
answered, however, with a take
down against Jackson in each of the
three periods. After numerous
stalemates, Jackson lost, 6-1. This
is his first loss in dual-meet compe
tition this season.
The tables turned for a while as
the Cardinal took the next three
matches. The run began with
sophomore Jimmy Aguirre, who
dominated the 142 match against
sophomore JefT Heberle. Aguirre
scored two takedowns in the first
period and was awarded an addi
tional point because of advantage
time for holding the top position for
more than one minute. He won the
match, 6-3.

"This was a better match for
me," said Aguirre. "The key to suc
cess is for me to keep moving ...
that's when my offense starts work
ing. I also was able to ride (Heberle)
a little bit, which kept him down."
Senior co-captain Lance John
son (150) followed the winning
trend as he defeated freshman
Jason Ramstetter, 10-5. The two
seemed to trade takedown for take
down in the first period, but John
son clearly dominated the match.
He scored three takedowns in the
first period alone, and followed with
another in the third period. John
son remains undefeated in dual
meets.
With the Cardinal team down
10-6, sophomore Tod Surmon
entered the 158 match against Bak
ersfield's Mickey Ritter needing a
win. Although Ritter shot strongly
at his legs, Surmon managed to
keep the Roadrunner wrestler
scoreless until the final period.
Meanwhile, in quick bursts, Sur
mon scored a takedown in both the
first and third period. He won the
match 6-1, which closed the gap to
10-9 after six matches.
Surmon attributed his focus on
basic technique and trouble situa
tions in practice to his victory. "I've
been trying to keep my matches
under control," Surmon said. "I
want to avoid those weird positions
that normally dominate the match

es."
The Cardinal's winning momen
tum failed to continue in the
remaining matches. Freshman
Scott Chapman (167) lost to Dan
Corpstein in a high-scoring match,
16-10. The score was tied going into
the second period, as both shared
two takedowns and an escape. How
ever, Corpstein scored on a barrage
of five takedowns over the following
two periods, and Chapman scored
only from escapes.
Cardinal freshman Jason Glad
den at 177 met a similar fate as he
lost to sophomore Paschal Duru.
Duru scored two takedowns in each
of the periods, defeating Gladden
14-5 as the Stanford wrestler was
unable to secure the dominant posi
tion.
The two final matches completed
the Roadrunner victory as fresh
man Bryan Vaniman (190) and
sophomore Scott Whitt (Heavy
weight) lost to their respective
opponents. Vaniman could not
evade Jassen Froehlich's four take
downs, losing 9-2.
Horpel was pleased with the
three Cardinal victories at the meet,
but said that as a whole the team
has some catching up to do.
"We're just not at where Bakers
field is right now," he said. "We
weren't really dominant in any
weight class ... we just caught
them asleep a couple of times."

is his first loss in dual-meet compe
tition this season.
The tables turned for a while as
the Cardinal took the next three
matches. The run began with
sophomore Jimmy Aguirre, who
dominated the 142 match against
sophomore JefT Heberle. Aguirre
scored two takedowns in the first
period and was awarded an addi
tional point because of advantage
time for holding the top position for
more than one minute. He won the
match, 6-3.

"This was a better match for
me," said Aguirre. "The key to suc
cess is for me to keep moving ...
that's when my offense starts work
ing. I also was able to ride (Heberle)
a little bit, which kept him down."
Senior co-captain Lance John
son (150) followed the winning
trend as he defeated freshman
Jason Ramstetter, 10-5. The two
seemed to trade takedown for take
down in the first period, but John
son clearly dominated the match.
He scored three takedowns in the
first period alone, and followed with
another in the third period. John
son remains undefeated in dual
meets.
With the Cardinal team down
10-6, sophomore Tod Surmon
entered the 158 match against Bak
ersfield's Mickey Ritter needing a
win. Although Ritter shot strongly
at his legs, Surmon managed to
keep the Roadrunner wrestler
scoreless until the final period.
Meanwhile, in quick bursts, Sur
mon scored a takedown in both the
first and third period. He won the
match 6-1, which closed the gap to
10-9 after six matches.
Surmon attributed his focus on
basic technique and trouble situa
tions in practice to his victory. "I've
been trying to keep my matches
under control," Surmon said. "I
want to avoid those weird positions
that normally dominate the match

es."
The Cardinal's winning momen
tum failed to continue in the
remaining matches. Freshman
Scott Chapman (167) lost to Dan
Corpstein in a high-scoring match,
16-10. The score was tied going into
the second period, as both shared
two takedowns and an escape. How
ever, Corpstein scored on a barrage
of five takedowns over the following
two periods, and Chapman scored
only from escapes.
Cardinal freshman Jason Glad
den at 177 met a similar fate as he
lost to sophomore Paschal Duru.
Duru scored two takedowns in each
of the periods, defeating Gladden
14-5 as the Stanford wrestler was
unable to secure the dominant posi
tion.
The two final matches completed
the Roadrunner victory as fresh
man Bryan Vaniman (190) and
sophomore Scott Whitt (Heavy
weight) lost to their respective
opponents. Vaniman could not
evade Jassen Froehlich's four take
downs, losing 9-2.
Horpel was pleased with the
three Cardinal victories at the meet,
but said that as a whole the team
has some catching up to do.
"We're just not at where Bakers
field is right now," he said. "We
weren't really dominant in any
weight class ... we just caught
them asleep a couple of times."
