## Men's team holds intrasquad meet as Wiley tries to qualify for U.S. Winter Cup 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
Stanford's two-time defending National
( hampion men's gymnastics team faced its
stiffest competition to date at the U.S. Win
ter Cup Qualifier last weekend at Ford Cen
ter. National standings were not at stake,
however, as the Qualifier was an
intrasquad meet pitting Cardinal versus
Cardinal.
For most Stanford gymnasts, therefore,
last weekend was merely an opportunity to
refine new skills and combinations of
maneuvers in a competitive atmosphere.
However, one athlete did have more at
stake — freshman Keith Wiley. Wiley

hoped to qualify for the U.S. Winter Cup
Chiillenge in Colorado Springs two weeks
from now Should he make it to the Col
orado event, he would seek to reaffirm his
status as a Junior National Team member.
Although Wiley will not find out if he
qualified for the U.S. Winter Cup Chal
lenge until later today, head coach Sadao
Hamada felt that both the team's and
Wiley's personal objectives were fulfilled.
"I think we performed well in general,"
Hamada said. "We had strong perfor
mances on most of the events... . Keith
will most likely qualify [for the U.S. Winter
Cup]."
In regard to the team, senior co-captain
Mark Booth led the way on the pommel

horse and parallel b<irs, scoring a 9.60 and a
9.50 respectively, while fellow senior Aaron
Kushner captured a team-high 9.30 on the
rings.
Meanwhile, freshman lan Bachrach
paced his teammates on floor excercises
and the high bar. Bachrach earned a 9.75
for his floor routine, while his high-bar per
formance received a 9.60. He also tied
junior Jing-Wei Liang on the vault with a
score of 9.40.
Despite such statistics, however, Hama
da still feels that his team has yet to
mature.
"Like before, this competiton told me
what we need to improve," Hamada said. "I
knew from the beginning of the season that

vaulting and the rings were going to be of
concern. From the Qualifier, I got confi
dence in our vault — we scored 46.75 (out
of 50) points. Rings still concern me
though. We scored 44.75."
Hamada said he now plans to increase
the difiiculty of routines for 20 percent of
his athletes.
"For the rest, it is a matter of execution,
consistency, sticking landings and not
breaking form," the coach said.
"I felt pretty good on the aparatus, but
there were too many mistakes," said fresh
man Jamie Ellis, who impressed Hamada
with a 105.30-point overall performance
last weekend. "I've got two weeks before
the next meet to clean them up. I'll work on

getting rid of falls and form deductions. I
just need to work on the basics more."
Wiley shared similar sentiments.
"I was a little disappointed Saturday,"
Wiley said. "I didn't do as well as I did in the
Spartan Open. [Yesterday in the compul
soriesj, I didn't know what to expect. I've
only been working on those routines for a
week. I think I may have a good chance to
qualify [for the Winter Cup), though, and
now I know what to work on."
As Wiley and Ellis indicated, part of the
problem is the lack of familiarity in their
routines, which resulted in numerous occa
sions last weekend where they fell off their
aparatus.
"There's a five-tenths point
deduction for falling off,"
Hamada said. "There are two
major reasons for falling off.
One is that you're not proficient
enough in your routine. The sec
ond major reason is lack of
strength and endurance. Some
times, when my gymnasts fall
off and then finish their excer
cise, they will go back and do
another half-routine to build
endurance."
In spite of the talk about the
numerous areas in which to
improve, Hamada still ex
pressed confidence in the direc
tion his team is headed.
Our target score is about 283-
284 (out of 300) every meet,
which would rank us among the
very top.
I know we can climb to that
level."
