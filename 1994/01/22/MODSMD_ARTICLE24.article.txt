# Tennis dominates Indoors
## 
### Rob Ross Editorial staff 
The Stanford women's tennis team's top players
are ranked among the best in the country. But it was
the squad's depth that carried the team to a stellar
showing last weekend in Seattle.
The Pacific 10 Conference Indoor Championships
consists of three flights of both singles and doubles
play. The Cardinal took home the bottom two singles
flights and the lowest-ranked doubles flight to come
away with half of the first-place trophies.
"The tournament went pretty well, considering
we were missing two of our top players," said Stan
ford head coach Frank Brennan.
The two M.I.A. Cardinals — Laxmi Poruri and
Kim Shasby — are not merely two of Stanford's best
players, but two of the top players in the country.
Shasby, who missed the tourney because of a foot
injury, was ranked as high as sixth in the nation.
Poruri's absence, due to her decision to play in a pro
fessional tournament, is even more detrimental, as
she is generally considered the most dominant play
er in collegiate women's tennis.
In Seattle, these two weren't even needed. In the
second singles flight (made up of the third and
fourth-best players from each squad) senior Emma
Woodhouse dominated, defeating three conference
rivals handily to make the finals, which she won over
Meredith Geiger of Arizona State by default.
Sophomore Beth Berris, the other Cardinal entry
in this flight, lost in the quarterfinals to California's
Nicole Elliot, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3.
The third flight was torn up by Stanford swingers.
From opposite ends of the bracket, freshman Sandra

De Silva and sophomore Wendy Sacks left a plethora
of Pac-10 foes in their wake to set up an all-Cardinal
final on Sunday. In a three-hour match, the fresh
man prevailed, 2-6, 6-2, 6-3. Brennan commented
that the match intensity may have been increased
because the Stanford starting six is still being set,
and these two are very close in the lineup.
"I was very happy with my play," De Dilva said. Of
the teammate vs. teammate final, she commented
that "it didn't really matter. Once I get going I forget
about who I'm playing and just play."
The Cardinal players in the top singles flight were
unable to follow the lead of their lower-ranked coun
terparts. Senior Kristine Kurth and freshman Katie
Schlukebir both fought their way to the quarterfi
nals before losing to the eventual finalists. Schluke
bir dropped a 6-3, 6-4 two-setter to sophomore Jane
Chi, from UCLA. The Bruin was "frustrating to
play," according to Schlukebir, because "she ran
everything down." Schlukebir felt that the loss was
instructive, as a change in strategy could produce a
future win.
Chi was the eventual winner of the top flight,
defeating Cal's Vera Vitels in the finals. Vitels had
defeated Kurth in the quarterfinals 6-7, 6-2, 6-4, in a
match in which Kurth "was a little disappointed. I
was leading in the third [set!, until I started making
errors."
"Kristine started to think a little too much," Bren
nan commented. "She's had trouble closing out
matches, but she's just one good win from being real
ly, really strong."
In doubles, the third-flight team of Sacks and
Schlukebir dominated the bracket to win the finals 6-
0, 6-1 over Diane Sadea and Stacey Jellen of UCLA.
