The third time is a charm,
huh.
After two bouts of barely
bearable blue-balls balloting,
the Stanford Daily staff man
aged to elect their new editor in
chief, Grace Yunjoo Lee.
Lee, a junior with a fetish for
stuffed simians and pricey
pumps, pledged to "get tough on
crime" in Volume 205.
"I don't drink much," Lee
said after having difficulty
uncorking a celebratory bottle
of champagne.
"But I want to try," she said,
upending the bottle. "It's all
part of the job.
"And where's my damn
tire?" she queried shortly after
finishing the bottle. "Oh, God."
Lee's victory promises a con
tinuity of certain elements from
the current volume, especially
the strange power to communi
cate with — and through —
stuffed animals.
The petite powerhouse also
pledged to increase the number
of "Lees" on the staff. "Four
isn't enough!" she cried. "More
o' Lee is morally right!"
Residents of Roble Hall were
also excited to hear Lee won the
election, especially when it was
discovered that she lived in that
dorm.
"I guess I saw her around
once," said a Roble resident who
asked to be identified only as a
former Canadian National Team
hockey player. "I didn't really
take notice of her. I hate women."
"You better mention me in
this story," added former Roble

resident Colleen Krueger, who
only supports Lee on Thursdays.
Lee, a 5-foot shooting guard
with a thing for older men, sum
mers in Miami, and spends her
winters in her Williamsville,
N.Y., chateau. According to
unofficial sources, she grew
three inches after the results
were announced.
"I'm not short," she said. "I
just don't wear heels that often."
Asked what her two proudest

accomplishments at Stanford
were, Lee pointed to majoring in
CE 170 and her in-depth cover
age of the 1993 University park
ing survey.
Lee said she is looking for
ward to moving into the editor's
big, comfy office, and having the
couch cleaned and sterilized.
"And getting me some new
shoes," Lee said. "I hear Joan &
David have some size fives for
only $3,000 per shoe."

Junior Grace Lee, who's shorter than an Oompa-Loompa and
much, much thinner, takes a swig of champagne Saturday after
finally being named The Daily's editor in chief for Volume 205.
