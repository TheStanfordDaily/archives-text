# ASSU restructuring proposal detailed
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Undergraduate senator Gabe Lucas last
night released the details of a proposed
amendment to the ASSU Constitution that, if
passed, will halve the size of the senate and in
stitute district-based voting for undergradu
ate seats.
Under the proposal, which will come before
the senate in two weeks for ratification, the
senate would be composed of 10 graduate and
10 undergraduate students rather than the
current total of 40.
In addition, senate elections would be
moved from the spring to the fall, and under
graduate elections would be districted so that
six seats would depend on residence location

and four on class — allowing each student to
vote for two representatives.
But Lucas backed down from an additional
proposal that would have named a member of
the Council of Presidents as chair of the senate.
Lucas announced plans for the amendment
on Thursday, but declined to reveal a finalized
bill until yesterday. The bill requires approval
by two-thirds of both the senate and the stu
dent body.
According to Lucas, the class-based districts
"will be based on years since matriculation." He
said the bill will not create an ofT-campus district.
The senate's graduate makeup would not be
changed under the proposal. Currently, gradu
ate senators are elected in three districts based
on their school.
Though the bill, which will come before the

Administration and Rules Committee today,
mandates undergraduate districts, the
specifics of the districts' composition will be
left to the senate.
"It authorizes the senate to redistrict every
two years," Lucas said. "But there is no gerry
mandering — the geographic districts must be
contiguous."
Lucas also included a clause which requires
population differences among the geographical
districts to be less than 10 percent.
"The main incentive behind the districting
is to bring the ASSU's connection closer to
everybody," he said. "Now, a person will be able
to go to their senator. . . . There is a stronger
link to dorm governments."
