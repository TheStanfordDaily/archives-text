# Trying to succeed in business
## Students pitch ASSU biz ideas 
### Elise Wolfgram Editorial staff 
Stanford could gain a video
dating service or a resume-and
employment-assistance program
in the near future if one of the pro
posals submitted for a new ASSU
business project is chosen for im
plementation.
The ASSU passed a bill in late
November that would give up to
$10,000 to a student or group of
students to start their own busi
ness as part of the Entrepreneur
ial Grants Program.
Council of Presidents member
Jason Snyder said the ASSU re
ceived about 20 proposals from
students who wish to try their
hand at a business enterprise.
Most proposals did not ask for
the full $10,000, but instead, fig
ures range from $2,000 to $10,000,
he said. Snyder added that the pro
posals came from both undergrad
uates and graduates.

"We were pleased to receive such
a wide range of ideas," he said.
"Nothing is assumed at this point,
[butJ I would guess we'll coine out
of this process with a solid money
making project."
Additional project ideas include
a Macintosh computer rental busi
ness, CI) exchanges and a text
book store to sell textbooks at a re
duced cost.
Snyder added that with reduced
services and budget cuts, the COP
and the ASSU are looking to create
a project which will help replace
some student services.

The ASSU grants committee
will decide which proposal re
ceives funding, after organizing it
self and weeding out more than
half the proposals. Once it pares
down the list, the committee will
ask for more details from the re
maining candidates and then
make a decision.
The committee includes Sny
der, COP cabinet member Clau
dia Gonzalez, graduate senator
Steve Abbott, undergraduate sen
ator Roberto Milk, ASSU finan
cial manager Brian Hillger, senior
Cecilia Tom and two non-ASSU
affiliates.
Once the committee chooses a
proposal, the author (or authors)

will become the project manager
and begin working on starting up
the business.
Snyder said 40 students showed
immediate interest in the project
and picked up applications, which
were due Friday.
"As a student government, we
don't have a monopoly on what
works," Snyder said. "We were
pretty happy getting this many
applications."
