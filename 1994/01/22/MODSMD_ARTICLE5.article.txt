# GSB to host AIDS quilt next month
## Project founded by Stanford alums 
### Justin Dawe 
Stanford will be the temporary
home of part of the world's largest
comfort blanket next month,
when a small cut of the massive
quilt devoted to the memory of
AIDS victims makes a stop at the
Graduate School of Business.
The University will host three
panels of eight quilts at Jackson
Library during national AIDS
Awareness Week, from Feb. 28
through March 6. The display is
part of a world-wide project spon
sored by NAME, a non-profit
AIDS awareness group founded in
San Francisco by Stanford alumni
Cleve Jones and Mike Smith.
NAME began its drive to in
crease knowledge about the dis
ease in 1988. Initially hoping to
gather squares for a quilt from the
gay community, the two founders
received much more than they had
hoped for.
Contributions from all over the

United States have been pouring
in ever since the project started,
with over 26,000 separate quilts
now bearing the symbols of AIDS
victims.
Business School student Thane
Kreiner, who is coordinating the
Stanford exhibition, said that, like
the epidemic itself, "the quilt is
too big" to be seen at one time.
The quilts, said Kreiner, serve
multiple purposes. As a "mecha
nism to express grief," the design
ing of patches provides an outlet
for victims, friends and family af
fected by the disease. The enormi
ty of the enterprise serves to bring
together the community in a huge
support network, he added.
However, he laments the fact
that the Stanford exhibition will
be relatively small, saying that on
such a scale only the "humanity"
expressed in the quilts comes
through. With larger demonstra
tions, such as those hosted in past
years in Washington, D.C., the
"scope of the [AIDS] issue can be
impressed" upon viewers, Kreiner
said.
This display is also being used
to set a precedent for greater
Stanford involvement in the dis
play of NAME's quilts, said fresh
man Elizabeth Kennedy, a stu
dent working on the project. Cit

ing the impact of a display of 180
panels at the Jewish Community
Center in Palo Alto last year,
Kennedy said she hopes to coordi
nate a display more than four
times that size — approximately
6,500 quilts — in Maples Pavil
ion. The display is tentatively
slated for the spring of 1995.
The appearance of the quilts
will be accompanied by a presen
tation by NAME co-founder
Smith. He will speak at Bishop
Auditorium, and his speech will
be followed by a reception open to
faculty and students.
