with over 26,000 separate quilts
now bearing the symbols of AIDS
victims.
Business School student Thane

Stanford exhibition, said that, like

However, he laments the fact
that the Stanford exhibition will
be relatively small, saying that on
such a scale only the "humanity"
expressed in the quilts comes
through. With larger demonstra
