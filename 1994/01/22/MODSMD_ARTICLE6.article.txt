# New group promotes life in the lab
## 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Junior Eric Liao had never consid
ered a career in scientific research until
he heard a few inspirational words from
a professor during a Biology 32 lecture
last year.
"To become a doctor, you may save
the lives of thousands," Biology Prof.
Robert Sapolsky told the class. "To make
a key discovery as a scientist, you could
save the human race." These words
prompted Liao to explore the possibility
of a life in the laboratory. A year later, he
is trying to help other students do the
same.

A biology major who will graduate
this spring but return as a coterminal
student next year, Liao is the founding
chairman of the Stanford Undergradu
ate Biologists, a new organization aimed
at promoting undergraduate research.
The organization will "present oppor
tunities in areas that people may be less
familiar with," said Biology Department
Chair Robert Simoni. "Stimulating stu
dents' interest in research will allow
them to take advantage of the unique re
search opportunities that Stanford has
to offer."
"We want to provide an open forum
for people who are interested in science
as a career— particularly in research,"

said junior Patrick Devine, a member of
the organization's planning group.
The organization — which is open to
students of any major — will be support
ed by the Biology Department. "The de
partment is committed to funding the
organization," Simoni said. "I think the
department feels that it is an enormous
ly important activity and worth the in
vestment." The planning group is cur
rently drawing up a preliminary budget,
and may also look at other sources for
funding, if necessary.
The group's main objectives are "to
excite students about research, help
them see what they like to do and
help them secure research posi
tions," said Liao.
To meet these goals, the orga
nization will sponsor talks by
well-known professors from Stan
ford and other universities.
It will also publish abstracts of
undergraduate work and complet
ed student projects in a journal so
that "interested students [can)
read about what other students
are actually working on," Liao
said. The abstracts will also list

contact names and numbers so
students can get in touch with
each other for more information.
Publishing completed student
projects "could further encourage
research, as well as stimulate
those doing research to think
about their projects in a more rig
orous and analytical light," Liao
said.
The organization will also hold
occasional information sessions
about applying to graduate
schools, including joint
M.D./Ph.D. programs, Liao said
The group hopes to invite admis
sions officers, professors and
graduate students to talk about
the application process and their

personal experiences.
The organization will also give
members access to a research file
which will include contacts with
professors and students who can
offer information on paid
research-related internships. The
files will also include advice on
how to obtain funding for sum
mer research.
Liao's experience as a research
intern is testimony to the oppor
tunities open to undergraduates.
"It is my feeling that if I can
duplicate similar experiences in
other bright and dedicated stu
dents, I may be able to encourage
them to join me in the path that I
now travel," he said.
