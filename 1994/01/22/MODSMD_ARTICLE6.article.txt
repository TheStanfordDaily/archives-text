# New group promotes life in the lab

Junior Eric Liao had never consid
ered a career in scientific research until
he heard a few inspirational words from
a professor during a Biology 32 lecture
last year.
"To become a doctor, you may save
the lives of thousands," Biology Prof.
Robert Sapolsky told the class. "To make
a key discovery as a scientist, you could
save the human race." These words
prompted Liao to explore the possibility
of a life in the laboratory. A year later, he
is trying to help other students do the
same.

A biology major who will graduate
this spring but return as a coterminal
student next year, Liao is the founding
chairman of the Stanford Undergradu
ate Biologists, a new organization aimed
at promoting undergraduate research.
The organization will "present oppor
tunities in areas that people may be less
familiar with," said Biology Department
Chair Robert Simoni. "Stimulating stu
dents' interest in research will allow
them to take advantage of the unique re
search opportunities that Stanford has
to offer."
"We want to provide an open forum
for people who are interested in science
as a career— particularly in research,"

said junior Patrick Devine, a member of
the organization's planning group.
The organization — which is open to
students of any major — will be support
ed by the Biology Department. "The de
partment is committed to funding the
organization," Simoni said. "I think the
department feels that it is an enormous
ly important activity and worth the in
vestment." The planning group is cur
rently drawing up a preliminary budget,
and may also look at other sources for
funding, if necessary.
The group's main objectives are "to
excite students about research, help
