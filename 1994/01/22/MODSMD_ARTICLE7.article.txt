## Students, alumni will travel to Galapagos to study evolution 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Stanford students will have the op
portunity to impersonate Charles Dar
win this summer, thanks to a new pro
gram in the Galapagos Islands.
Students will spend 10 days observing
the flora and fauna off the coast of
Ecuador, much as Darwin did. But stu
dents will travel in "Class A accommoda
tions" for two units of credit with Stan
ford alumnus and Human Biology Pro
gram Director William Durham.
The program, offered jointly by the

Human Biology Program, the Alumni
Association and the Continuing Studies
Department, will send a group of about
35 people to the islands for a fee of
$4,070 each Trip organizers hope to
send 17 or 18 students and an equal
number of alumni. While participants
won't be sailing the high seas on the
Beagle as Darwin did, they will stay
aboard the boat Isabels II after flying to
the islands.
"It's a lot of money, but it's a most un
usual opportunity to go . . . with other
people who are intensely interested in
the Galapagos," said Durham.

Durham snid the trip is mostly funded
by the fee, as well as a $20,000 gift from
philanthropists Peter and Helen Bingto
be used for an as yet undetermined num
ber of scholarships.
Undergraduates must take Anthro
pology 1618 to get credit for going on the
trip. The a five-unit class in the spring
focuses on how animals of the Galapagos
have aided in the understanding of evo
lution.
"Putting this together with a course
. . . means that people will go knowing
