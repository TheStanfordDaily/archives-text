# The 						Origin of Species
## Students, alumni will travel to Galapagos to study evolution 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Stanford students will have the op
portunity to impersonate Charles Dar
win this summer, thanks to a new pro
gram in the Galapagos Islands.
Students will spend 10 days observing
the flora and fauna off the coast of
Ecuador, much as Darwin did. But stu
dents will travel in "Class A accommoda
tions" for two units of credit with Stan
ford alumnus and Human Biology Pro
gram Director William Durham.
The program, offered jointly by the

Human Biology Program, the Alumni
Association and the Continuing Studies
Department, will send a group of about
35 people to the islands for a fee of
$4,070 each Trip organizers hope to
send 17 or 18 students and an equal
number of alumni. While participants
won't be sailing the high seas on the
Beagle as Darwin did, they will stay
aboard the boat Isabels II after flying to
the islands.
"It's a lot of money, but it's a most un
usual opportunity to go . . . with other
people who are intensely interested in
the Galapagos," said Durham.

Durham snid the trip is mostly funded
by the fee, as well as a $20,000 gift from
philanthropists Peter and Helen Bingto
be used for an as yet undetermined num
ber of scholarships.
Undergraduates must take Anthro
pology 1618 to get credit for going on the
trip. The a five-unit class in the spring
focuses on how animals of the Galapagos
have aided in the understanding of evo
lution.
"Putting this together with a course
. . . means that people will go knowing
more than gawking tourists,"
explained Durham. Students will
be "encouraged" to undertake pro
jects, such as a slide show or video,
capturing one element of the trip.
Durham said the opportunities
for study would be numerous.
"While there will not be any con
trolled observations or sustained
study, we will have opportunities
for observation (of Galapagos
organisms) according to people's
interests." More in-depth studies
would require more formal
arrangements than the trip pro
vides, Durham explained.
"One of the beauties of the

Galapagos is that the organisms on
the island are docile and unafraid,
so it is easy to make detailed obser
vations close-up," he said.
Durham also felt it would be
possible to study Ecuador's con
servation efforts to protect indige
nous organisms from non-native
species introduced by contact with
the outside world.
The Alumni Association has
previously offered trips similar to
this one, although this is the first
time undergraduates will be able to
participate. Alumni going on the
trip can take a night course during
spring quarter that will be similar
to the undergraduate course.
The trip begins June 12. Appli
cations are available at the
Human Biology office and are due
by 5 p.m. on Feb. 18.
