# A 						symbolic shutdown
## Asian activities center closed for two weeks to dramatize possible effects of budget cuts 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
In a gesture meant to dramatize the
possible effects of budget cuts, Asian-
American community leaders on campus
have decided to temporarily shut down
their activities center.
"It's a symbolic move to raise aware
ness of the Asian-American Activities
Center," said Lisa Lee, chair of the
Asian American Student Association
(AASA). "It's a reason for people to stop
and think . . . about how it affects them
individually."
The center, boarded up since Jan. 16,

will stay closed until the 28th. According
to Lee, both student leaders and staffers
at the center agreed to the closure

head of the center's advisory
board, exhorting center director
Rick Yuen to give strong consider
ation to the impact of the cuts.
Organizations within AASA
have carried on business as usual,
despite their forced relocation.
Sophomore Jerry Chen said the
protest is meant to draw the
attention of both administrators
and students.
"We want people to try to pic
ture a campus without the cen
ter."

However, students interviewed
were generally unaware of the
group's move. "Most students
don't have much occasion to go up
there," said sophomore Jennifer
Lee.
Despite the center's closure,
the campus' ethnic communities
were active during the last week,
meeting with students and gath
ering input about the upcoming
budget cuts.
An open meeting held Friday
was "a really good way for people
to be a part of the process," said
Lisa Lee.
She said the relationship between
students and the administration has
become more amiable since the pub

lie forum on the cuts held two
weeks ago. At the forum, students
expressed distrust in and frustra
tion with the process, and some
exchanged heated words with
Provost Condoleezza Rice.
Lee pointed to Rice's sugges
tion for creating an endowment
for the centers as evidence of the
administration's commitment.
"It takes millions of dollars to
make an endowment," she said.
"She's looking for |us to plan] a
package to propose to donors."
Students and ethnic center
deans will be working out strate
gic budget and funding proposals
in open meetings during the next
few weeks.
