# Perry picked for top defense post
## After initial ambivalence, Stanford professor accepts president's offer 
### Matthew Gregory Staff writer with AP wire reports 
In a move hailed by both Re
publicans and Democrats, Presi
dent Clinton yesterday named
Stanford engineering Prof.
William J. Ferry his new nominee
for secretary of defense.
Perry, who has served as the
Department of Defense's deputy
secretary since February, said he
accepted the position only after
consulting with his family on
whether to take the job. He was re
ported to be the leading candidate
late last week.
"I did not want to drive my fam
ily into a decision — my decision
— without their support," said
Perry, 66. Perry said he told the
White House on Saturday that he
could not, at that point, say yes to
the job.
After a talk with Vice President
A 1 Gore and then a meeting with
family members, he telephoned
the White House on Sunday to say
he would accept an offer if one
were forthcoming.
Last week's surprise withdraw
al of Bobby Ray Inman — Clin
ton's first choice to replace outgo
ing defense secretary Les Aspin —

left the administration scrambling
to find a nominee who could be
confirmed quickly. Perry was con
sidered a logical choice because of
the wide respect he enjoys in Con
gress and the Pentagon.
Currently on leave from Stan
ford, Perry holds an appointment in
the Engineering-Economic Sys
tems Department and was, until
last year, a co-director of the Center
for International Security and
Arms Control. He holds two degrees
in mathematics from Stanford.
Perry's former boss praised
Clinton's choice.
"He's such a superb, well-quali
fied person," said James Sweeney,
the chairman of the Engineering-
Economic Systems Department.
"We need somebody with vision
land| pragmatism. .. . He's that
kind of person."
The staff at the Center for In
ternational Security and Arms
Control — which Perry co-directed
from 1989 until last year — was
"very excited" about the appoint
ment, said John Harvey, a senior
research engineer there. "We were
all applauding" when Clinton
made the announcement, he said.
Harvey added that Perry's hes

itancy in accepting the job was
understandable. "This is a tough
job. It's going to take a lot out of
him," he explained. "You can't go
into that kind of job without
speaking to and getting the sup
port of your family."
Center co-director David Hol
loway agreed, saying, "I think it's
certainly consistent that he would
want to consult his family. ... He
was never somebody who has
[actively] sought the limelight."
Perry is currently on a two
year leave from the Engineering-
Economic Systems Department.
Sweeney, the department chair
man, said he saw "no reason" to
change that situation now that
Perry has been nominated for
defense secretary.

Last February, Perry was
asked to serve as deputy secretary
of defense, which put him in
charge of the department's daily
business. He also worked in the
Pentagon during the Carter
administration, where he was
undersecretary for research and
engineering.
Clinton said he chose Perry
"based on his lifetime of accom
plishments and his solid leader
ship at the Pentagon.
"He has the right skills and
management experience for the
job. He has the right vision for the
job," said Clinton.
The president predicted Perry
would reform Pentagon spending
procedures, keep a tight rein on
the shrinking defense budget and
maintain the nation's strong mili
tary force.
Perry said that he would insti
tute reforms while addressing the
needs of military personnel and

i facilities, as well as the communi
ties that depend on them.
He also stressed the need for
optimism in facing the problems of
i the post-Cold War world. "We read
about the problems every day —
Mogadishu, Sarajevo, Pyongyang
— but we must not lose sight of
the opportunities in this new post-
Soviet world," Perry said.
In addition, Perry yesterday
commended the Clinton adminis
tration's progress on defense and
security issues. "Over the past
year, I have welcomed the inten
tions of President Clinton in the
challenge of reshaping our forces
in this new era," Perry said.
"I appreciate also, Mr. Presi
dent, your commitment to main
taining the readiness and the
morale of our fighting forces," he
said. "I also look forward to serve
because this is a time of great
change, great challenge and great
opportunity."
