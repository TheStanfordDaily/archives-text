In a move hailed by both Re
publicans and Democrats, Presi
dent Clinton yesterday named
Stanford engineering Prof.
William J. Ferry his new nominee
for secretary of defense.
Perry, who has served as the
Department of Defense's deputy
secretary since February, said he
accepted the position only after
consulting with his family on
whether to take the job. He was re
ported to be the leading candidate
late last week.
"I did not want to drive my fam
ily into a decision — my decision
— without their support," said
Perry, 66. Perry said he told the
White House on Saturday that he
could not, at that point, say yes to
the job.
After a talk with Vice President
A 1 Gore and then a meeting with
family members, he telephoned
the White House on Sunday to say
he would accept an offer if one
were forthcoming.
Last week's surprise withdraw

left the administration scrambling
to find a nominee who could be
confirmed quickly. Perry was con
sidered a logical choice because of
the wide respect he enjoys in Con
gress and the Pentagon.
Currently on leave from Stan
ford, Perry holds an appointment in
the Engineering-Economic Sys
tems Department and was, until
last year, a co-director of the Center
for International Security and
Arms Control. He holds two degrees
in mathematics from Stanford.
Perry's former boss praised
Clinton's choice.
"He's such a superb, well-quali
fied person," said James Sweeney,
the chairman of the Engineering-
Economic Systems Department.
"We need somebody with vision
land| pragmatism. .. . He's that
kind of person."
The staff at the Center for In
ternational Security and Arms
Control — which Perry co-directed
from 1989 until last year — was
"very excited" about the appoint
ment, said John Harvey, a senior
research engineer there. "We were
all applauding" when Clinton
made the announcement, he said.
