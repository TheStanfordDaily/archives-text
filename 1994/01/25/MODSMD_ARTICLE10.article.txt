# Court: abortion protesters may be sued
## Anti-abortion groups may be charged with racketeering 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A unani
mous Supreme Court ruled yesterday
that protesters who block access to abor
tion clinics or in other ways conspire to
stop women from having abortions may
be sued as racketeers.
The decision, which could threaten
Operation Rescue and other anti-abor
tion groups with financial ruin, also
allows federal courts to order a halt to
illegal protests at clinics.
Although focused only on interpret
ing a federal anti-racketeering law, the
decision is a big victory for the National
Organization for Women and the Clin
ton administration.
NOW had taken the case to the high
court, and the administration had sided
with NOW's view of the disputed law.
Lower courts had thrown out the
nationwide class-action lawsuit that
tried to invoke the anti-racketeering law
against Operation Rescue and other
groups. Yesterday's decision reinstated
the lawsuit, which stems from anti
abortion protests in Chicago and other
cities.
"The court has added another
weapon to our arsenal for attacking the
terrorism of extremists in the anti-abor

tion movement," said Helen Neuborne
of the NOW Legal Defense Fund. "We're
very pleased."
But Randall Terry of Operation Res
cue said, "The Supreme Court has told
civil protest to go to hell." He said,
"This is a vulgar betrayal of over 200
years of tolerance toward protest and
civil disobedience. The iron heel of gov
ernment now will be used to crush dis
sent."
Nothing in the ruling dealt directly
with abortion. The court in 1992 reaf
firmed the core holding of its landmark
Roe vs. Wade decision of 1973 — that
women have a constitutional right to
abortion.
Yesterday's ruling focused on alleged
crimes committed against abortion clin
ic employees and patients. The court
said such conduct can lead to lawsuits
under federal Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations legislation,
called RICO.
The decision means that anti-abor
tion groups and individuals sued suc
cessfully over their conduct can be
forced to pay tripled damages. Further,
leaders of anti-abortion groups may be
sued successfully as conspirators even if

they are not physically present when
illegal conduct occurs. The NOW law
suit alleges criminal violations dating
back to 1982.
The court last year ruled abortion
clinic operators cannot invoke the Ku
Klux Klan Act of 1871 in suing those
who block women's access to abortion
clinics.
That ruling led to an effort in
Congress to provide more federal protec
tion for women seeking abortions. The
House and Senate have passed separate
versions of the Freedom of Access to
Clinics Act, and the legislation will be
before a conference committee when
Congress reconvenes.
The court's new decision falls far
short of resolving all legal issues sur
rounding anti-abortion activities. Just
last Friday, the justices agreed to clarify
how far courts and local governments
may go in restricting protesters outside
clinics.
That case, to be decided by July, pits
the free-speech rights of protesters
against the rights of women seeking
abortions and of abortion clinic employ
ees to be free from harassment, intimi
dation or other illegal conduct.
