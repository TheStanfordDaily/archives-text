# Packwood must surrender diaries
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen. Bob
Packwood's personal diaries are
"unquestionably relevant" to the Sen
ate Ethics Committee and must be pro
vided to the panel, a federal judge ruled
yesterday.
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson said he had to "balance Sen.
Packwood's expectations of privacy . . .
against the Ethics Committee's interest
in examining them for evidence of mis
conduct. ..."
On balance, he said, the committee's
subpoena for the diaries must be
upheld.
Jackson found the diaries "unques
tionably relevant... to a constitutional
ly authorized and properly focused
inquiry" by a committee with "jurisdic
tion to investigate allegations of miscon
duct. . ." by members of the Senate.
The committee had been awaiting

the ruling before deciding its next
moves: whether to expand the probe to
include job offers to Packwood's wife
and whether to hold public hearings.
The panel is investigating the Oregon
Republican for alleged sexual miscon
duct, witness intimidation and obstruc
tion of the probe by Packwood's alleged
alteration of the diaries.
Jackson ruled the subpoena did not
violate Packwood's Fourth Amendment
rights against over-broad searches. The
committee met legal standards of rea
sonableness, he found.
Nor, Jackson concluded, did the com
mittee violate the Oregon Republican's
Fifth Amendment right against self
incrimination. Packwood lost that claim
when the diaries were "voluntarily com
mitted to paper" before the committee
sought them.
The Senate demanded the diaries in a

lawsuit after Packwood disobeyed the
subpoena — arguing it violated his con
stitutional rights, by allowing the com
mittee to "rummage" through his most
private thoughts.
Jackson acknowledged the diaries
were "extremely personal and private,"
but pointed out the committee already
has agreed to respect private material
not needed for the investigation.
The subpoena was issued after the
panel found entries that investigators
said raised questions about whether
Packwood used his office to aid lobbyists
and businessmen who offered his wife a
job. The committee wants diaries from
1989 to the present to decide whether to
make the job offers part of the investi
gation.
The Justice Department has started
a criminal investigation on the job offers
and also has subpoenaed the diaries.
