### 
Res Ed should increase
quantity and quality of
programming offered

MANY PEOPLE have specu
lated that while the Com
mission on Undergraduate
Education's subcommittee on aca
demic environment is just begin
ning its discussion, the University
has already had the final word on
the subject.
Indeed, the recent announce
ment that the office of Residential
Education will be moved under the
purview of Housing and Dining
Services is certainly a threat to Res
Ed — but it does not necessarily
signal the end of intellectual life in
the residences.
CUE is in a strong position to
make a large impact on the future
of this "new" Res Ed. The subcom
mittee, then, should take this
opportunity to investigate all possi
ble futures for Res Ed; its members
must talk to resident fellows, resi
dent assistants and students. And
above all, the University must
ensure that the CUE's recommen
dations on academic environment
do not get lost in the budget shuf
fle.
This restructuring provides an
opportunity to improve the Univer
sity's intellectual environment. At
present, "residential education" is
defined by the set of programs pre
sented in the dorms. This system
has led not only to a geographically
fragmented University intellectual
community, but one which is stag
nant, as well.
These dorm programs are poorly
attended, especially in upperclass
residences — for the most part, the
programs are the same, year after
year. Moreover, programs have suf
fered because Stanford students
have come to expect experts as
guests — we have them as our
teachers in the classroom, why not
outside as well?

CUE's suggestions on the aca
demic life of the University should
stress the importance of "program
ming" for the entire University
community, not just for the resi
dents of a single dorm. Panel dis
cussions, talks and presentations
should always be open to all stu
dents, and should be well-publi
cized to the entire campus.
The programs themselves also
need to be changed. A stimulating
intellectual life demands, by defini
tion, new and radical ideas. As
therapeutic as massage workshops
may be, a visit from, for example, a
prominent Stanford alum such as
Sandra Day O'Connor might prove
more enlightening. CUE's report
should emphasize this fact, and
also include specific recommenda
tions for ways to bring such ideas
to campus.
But these changes cannot be
made by CUE or the University
administration alone. The RFs and
RAs need to take a more active role
in the development of University
intellectual life, especially with
freshman residents.
From their first year at Stan
ford, students should be encour
aged by their residence staff to take
part in the many intellectual activ
ities around campus. There should
be as many inter-dorm intellectual
programs and dorm trips to talks in
Kresge as there are outings to
Flicks. And if we instill high expec
tations for educational program
ming in freshmen, the quality of
programming will only improve.
Additionally, the proposed half
time dean would facilitate the aca
demic focus of Res Ed. This dean
would prove a valuable addition to
the intellectual environment of the
University, provided the dean
works closely with RFs and RAs
and is a link in a centralized chain
of command.
Res Ed is one of the most unique
aspects of a Stanford undergradu
ate education. Although it may see
changes in its organization, Res Ed
must retain its vital function as a
complement to a classroom educa
tion.
