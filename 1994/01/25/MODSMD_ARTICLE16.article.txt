## A fond farewell to modesty
### 
HAVE YOU had enough of me yet?
Those of you have labored
through my columns are probably
ready for a change. Maybe someone in
the next volume will write about race
relations, childhood experiences or grad
uation. Boy, that would be a surprise.
At some point all of these personal
reflections begin to sound the same. One
wonders, what's the point? Why have I
devoted two hours each Sunday to writ
ing these introspective, sometime insult
ing, items?
Well, I like stirring up controversy.
Sure, we have enough of that on this
campus and in this world. However,
there is a sort of personal satisfaction
which one feels when issues are passion
ately put forth in one's name. I want peo
ple to think, and I want them to think
because I told them to think. This is defi
nitely egotism, it is a self-centered urge
for power. That is what human psycholo
gy is all about.
I would be skeptical of any Stanford
student who argues that his or her
motives are purely altruistic. Sure, there
is such a thing as altruism. We have con
sciences (a superego if you like) and inter
nalized moral precepts which lead us to
do things which we instinctively feel are
correct. We give to charity, we cry at the
pain of an injured child in Sarajevo, we
speak out against needless violence, and
we even give respect to our parents,
sometimes. But let's not take these argu

ments too far.
Life, politics, and campus activism are
all about power. Those of us who claim to
be self-appointed representatives of a
particular group are like those politicians
who constantly tell us what the American
people think. Thank you, I did not realize
that was how we, the American people,
think.
The essentials of power dynamics will
never be recognized by those accused of
egotism and self-centeredness. Part of
being in power involves controlling
rhetoric. If I admit that I am acting for
personal interest, then my power is
depleted, my credibility in speaking for
others diminished. I guess this is why we
spend so much time arguing about lan
guage.
This brings me back to my experiences
as a columnist. There are times when
even I don't know what to write, when I
feel lazy, when, believe it or not, I worry
about angering people (of course I usual
ly overcome these moments of congenial
ity). In the end, however, writing this col
umn was fun because I enjoyed seeing my
name in the newspaper.
Should I be embarrassed to admit
this? I don't think so. I have ideas and
opinions which I strongly believe, and
there is a feeling of pride when these
thoughts are disseminated for all to see. I
hope that I have made people think, but
even if I haven't, at least I've had my
soap box.

People argue that the media is biased,
and often unfair in its coverage of issues.
There is the economic element which
drives programming and reporting, but
more than that, as I exemplify, there is a
strong element of egotism. Why do we
expect some sort of objective presenta
tion of issues when we know that the peo
ple reporting those issues have strong
beliefs and large egos?
Having been a columnist, I under
stand how the William F. Buckleys,
William Safires and Daily cronies have
over-inflated egos. I may have had pne
before I began writing this column, but
having my name in the paper has only
served to reinforce this sense of self
importance.
Life is about power and egos, and we
cannot expect behavior along different
lines from others. Human nature is not
primarily altruistic.
So, I will end my last column by
reminding you that everything I have
written is correct, simply because I have
written it. Though you might feel to the
contrary, I will miss seeing my name in
the paper every Tuesday.

While the narcissistic tone of this column
may be eerily reminiscent of Joel Stein, it
really was Jeremi who wrote this column.
