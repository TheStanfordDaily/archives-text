## Nazism shows how system 's insanity infects population 
### 
THE EXCHANGE of views on the
film "Schindler's List" that
appeared recently in The Daily
was extremely thoughtful but neverthe
less ignored one of the film's few short
comings. Stephen Spielberg has pro
duced a magnificent and enthralling
movie that will give many viewers the
most accurate view of the Holocaust
they are likely to get. But it was far from
being the last word on the catastrophe.
Obviously a Hollywood production
could never match the horrors of the
exhibits at Yad Vashem, Israel's memo
rial to the Holocaust, or of films taken at
the Nazi death camps that were released
just after World War 11. Spielberg came
remarkably close to portraying the suf
fering of the Jews under Nazism, but he
failed to suggest the broader significance
of the movement that swept through
Germany during those years. This fail
ure was embodied in Amon Goeth, the
commander of the labor camp where
Oskar Schindler's plant was located.

Beautifully acted by Ralph Fiennes,
Goeth is a psychopath, a sadistic loony
who uses Jewish prisoners for target
practice.
But the real and abiding horror of the
Holocaust is that it was not carried out
by raving lunatics but by seemingly ordi
nary, sane people. Most camp comman
ders probably resembled Goeth far less
than they did Adolf Eichmann, a faithful
husband and father who presided over
the persecution, torture, starvation,
dehumanization and eventual extermi
nation of millions of his fellow human
beings. One frightening lesson to be
learned from the Holocaust is that when
an entire system becomes insane, nor
mal people tend to go along with the
insanity.
Even Stanford provides examples of
this tendency. Some 25 years ago, dur
ing the Vietnam War, recruiters came to
the Placement Center to fill jobs for a
company that was making anti-person
nel bomblets, weapons containing hun-

dreds of tiny barbs specifically designed
to produce grievous, hard-to-treat
wounds rather than kill outright. Anoth
er company was making Napalm B, an
improved version that stuck to the skin
longer than the ordinary substance used
by the armed forces to burn human
beings to death. The recruiters for these
companies were amiable, neatly dressed
young men who undoubtedly believed
inflicting torture on Vietnamese peas
ants and their children served some use
ful national purpose. Equally benign
were the Stanford officials who provided
them with office space.
More recently, just after the Gulf
War, a respected Stanford professor
described to a Palo Alto audience the
successful U.S. effort to destroy much of
Iraq. The speaker was gratified by the
fact that weapons he had helped develop
as a Pentagon official during the 1980s
had proved their worth when tested in
war. He seemed hardly aware that
150,000 people had been killed by these

weapons or that tens of thousands of
Iraqi children were still dying of hunger
and disease because of the destruction
they had caused.
Neither of these examples approaches
in magnitude the incomparable evil of
the Nazi regime, but they are reminders
of how natural it becomes to go along
without protest with crimes done in the
name of patriotism or national security.
As the chilling exhibits at Yad Vashem
reveal, the "final solution" began gradu
ally; the edicts barring Jews from own
ing property, from going to school, from
holding jobs and eventually from even
being considered human, were issued
like any other regulations in proper legal
language, and were carried out like any
other task by dutiful bureaucrats.
"Schindler's List" included several bril
liant scenes that suggested this aspect of
the Nazi period. I only wish that for the
sake of future generations he had driven
the lesson home more forcefully.
