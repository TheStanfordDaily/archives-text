AS A PLETHORA of vice provosts
continue to hack away at Stanford's
budget and services, a disturbing
trend quickly becomes apparent — the
current administration has little respect
for faculty, staff or students.
On Friday, Jan. 14, Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds
announced the restructuring of her unit.
One of the most significant changes was
placing Residential Education (now
named Residential Life), which had previ
ously reported directly to Edmonds, under
the jurisdiction of new administrative
department.
That new unit would be headed by a

person reputed for his unresponsiveness
to student complaints and concerns —
Keith Guy, the six-year veteran director of
Housing and Dining Services. How this
change will improve Res Ed, or do any
thing other than allow Guy to save money
through staff cuts is unclear.
Edmonds did not inform resident fel
lows of the Jan. 14 meeting until the day
before it was scheduled to take place.
Since Stanford faculty are notoriously
busy, only 20 of the more than 50 RFs
were able to attend. Nor were the RFs
consulted about any of the proposed
changes.
Why would Stanford administrators
treat their most cherished assets — the
faculty — in this fashion? Acting Co-
Director of Res Ed Ann Porteus has one
theory: "This administration and Con
doleezza Rice in particular has made it
clear that this process is not going to be as
inclusive as it has been in the past"
(Emphasis added).
Earlier in the same week, Chief Finan
cial Officer Peter Van Etten, Vice Provost
for Institutional Planning Geoffrey Cox

and Budget Director Tim Warner met
with about 200 managers at Fairchild
Auditorium to answer the question, "How
come Stanford's so rich but acts so poor?"
Van Etten proceeded to recycle Rice's ofl
used speech about restricted funds vs.
unrestricted funds, the Loma Prieta
earthquake, the indirect-cost scandal and
the anemic California economy.
But no solid information was forthcom
ing. Van Etten said that he could not
explain what would happen when the
managers submitted their budgets. In
fact, those budgets were due just two days
after the meeting — where Van Etten
finally laid out the guidelines he and his
fellow financial officers would use to make
the upcoming round of cuts. It doesn't
take a degree in accounting to realize that
the little information that Van Etten gave
the managers would have been more use
ful earlier.
Students as usual, were left holding the
short end of the stick. First, at Edmonds'
meeting on the restructuring of Student
Affairs, Undergraduate and Graduate
Financial Aids were merged and placed

under the charge of Admissions Dean
James Montoya. Traditionally, these
offices have remained separate, reflecting
Stanford's commitment to need-blind
admissions. Presuming that this commit
ment remains unchanged, as Montoya
pointed out it would seem that the only
reason to combine these operations would
be the elimination of some staff.
However, his explanation of the ratio
nale behind the merger begs some degree
of suspicion. "The advantages are that it
brings together two highly talented staffs
who may be able to work more closely
together in meeting the needs of prospec
tive and currently enrolled students."
What information can Admissions give
Financial Aids that a W-4 doesn't provide?
What information can Financial Aids give
Admissions that would help it decide
whether or not to admit a student, if
admission is still need-blind? And what
does Admissions have to do with currently
enrolled students?
The final insult: summer storage. After
years of free service to the students, the
University pulled the service because of

fire codes and budget constraints. Now,
they propose to offer on-campus storage
once more — at a price. Given that the
space already exists and there are no
plans mentioned to provide extra security
for the storage spaces, exactly what is the
University charging us for? Pre-printed
boxes for us to store our belongings in.
The administration's lack of respect for
the Stanford community extends far
beyond the ethnic center debate that has
consumed the pages of The Daily and this
column space for the last few weeks:
"This administration and Condoleezza
Rice in particular has made it clear that
this process is not going to be as inclusive
as it has been in the past."
Draw your own conclusions.

trators will be admitted free of charge.

finally laid out the guidelines he and his
fellow financial officers would use to make
the upcoming round of cuts. It doesn't
take a degree in accounting to realize that
the little information that Van Etten gave
the managers would have been more use
ful earlier.
Students as usual, were left holding the
short end of the stick. First, at Edmonds'
meeting on the restructuring of Student
Affairs, Undergraduate and Graduate
Financial Aids were merged and placed

under the charge of Admissions Dean
James Montoya. Traditionally, these
offices have remained separate, reflecting
Stanford's commitment to need-blind
admissions. Presuming that this commit
ment remains unchanged, as Montoya
pointed out it would seem that the only
reason to combine these operations would
be the elimination of some staff.
However, his explanation of the ratio
nale behind the merger begs some degree
of suspicion. "The advantages are that it
brings together two highly talented staffs
who may be able to work more closely
together in meeting the needs of prospec
tive and currently enrolled students."
What information can Admissions give
Financial Aids that a W-4 doesn't provide?
What information can Financial Aids give
Admissions that would help it decide
whether or not to admit a student, if
admission is still need-blind? And what
does Admissions have to do with currently
enrolled students?
The final insult: summer storage. After
years of free service to the students, the
University pulled the service because of

fire codes and budget constraints. Now,
they propose to offer on-campus storage
once more — at a price. Given that the
space already exists and there are no
plans mentioned to provide extra security
for the storage spaces, exactly what is the
University charging us for? Pre-printed
boxes for us to store our belongings in.
The administration's lack of respect for
the Stanford community extends far
beyond the ethnic center debate that has
consumed the pages of The Daily and this
column space for the last few weeks:
"This administration and Condoleezza
Rice in particular has made it clear that
this process is not going to be as inclusive
as it has been in the past."
Draw your own conclusions.
