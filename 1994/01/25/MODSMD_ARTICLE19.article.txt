## Fire and water: Gymnasts finish third to Tide, Devils Women's squad narrowly falls to Alabama and Arizona State in a matchup of highly ranked teams 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
Despite a new and tougher scor
ing system, the Stanford's women
gymnastics team posted an impres
sive score of 189.625 on Sunday in
Tempe, Ariz. Unfortunately, the
Cardinal's competitors, Arizona
State and Alabama, scored even
higher and took first and second
places at the meet.
Arizona State, ranked ninth in
preseason polls, narrowly defeated
second-ranked Alabama, 192.600 to
192.150. Despite their third-place
finish, the Cardinal has never
scored as close to Alabama as they
did on Sunday.
"We went up against two great
teams, and we were right up there
with them," Greenwood said. "If
we continue to perform this well,
we will reach our goal of going to
Nationals."
The Cardinal gymnasts gave an
excellent beam performance and
won the event with a score of
47.925. They only had one fall, and
junior Jene Elzie took first place
with a 9.775. Freshman Katie Jen
nings' score 0f9.750 earned her sec
ond place, shared with Alabama's
Kim Kelly and Arizona State's
Michele Naia. Sophomore Linda
Chun was added to the beam lineup
this meet and brought in a 9.300.
"Katie has been one of the top
all-around performers in both of
our meets with a fall in each one,"
Greenwood said. "As soon as she
hits all the four events, she will be
one of the top in the country."
Stanford had a strong showing
on the floor as well, barely losing to
Arizona State (47.550) and Alaba
ma (47.500) with a 47.400. The
Cardinal hit all six floor routines.

Sophomore Tina Snowden led the
Cardinal with a 9.675, followed by
Jennings with a 9.625. Arizona
State's Tina Brinkman won this
event with a 9.85.
Taking the place of Elzie on
floor was junior Jenny Ward. Elzie,
who strained her achilles tendon
last week, did not compete on
either floor or vault,
"I didn't even know I was doing
floor until a few days before the
meet," Ward said. "But 1 was
pleased with my performance."
Though they came in third at the
meet, Stanford gave a strong perfor
mance on the vault, which earned a
47.175. Winning this event was Ari
zona State's Brinkman with a
9.825. Junior Meegan Lannin led
the Stanford team with a score of
9.675, performing a very difficult
vault that starts at a 10.000.
"I stuck my vault for the first
time ever. It was a thrill!" Lannin
said. "My goal is to do it like Mary
Lou Retton â€” with a straight body
and a nailed landing."
Sophomore Hillary Anderson
landed her vault for the second
time in her collegiate career, earn
ing a 9.475, and Jennings earned a
9.500 for landing her vault for the
first time in college. According to
Cardinal assistant coach Robert
Shawler, this is the best vaulting
team ever at Stanford.
Stanford came in third on the
uneven bars with a 47.025, behind
Arizona State with a 48.825 and
Alabama with a 48.325. Leading
the Cardinal was Elzie (9.700) and
Anderson (9.65).
As the least favored team at the
meet, Greenwood said the gymnasts
did a great job of performing confi
dently under these circumstances
for a crowd of about 2,500 people.
