# Easy e-mail
## Technology allows students to reach pen pals in Germany, learn language 
### Jo Marshall 
Although radio advertisements claim
otherwise, the joys of learning a foreign lan
guage can often fade into tedious lists of ir
regular verbs and overly structured sen
tences.
But with the help of electronic mail, Ger
man instructor Karen Strachota has added
a more personal touch to the study of Ger
man and jolted it into the 21st century.
With the simple request "Ich suche
einen Brief freund" — "I would like a pen
pal" — students in her first-year German
language class are using the latest in net
work technology to "bring a true German
feel" to the class, Strachota said.
"It sounded like a terrific idea," she said.
"I'm always looking for a way to make Ger
man more real and more fun."
Strachota initially used e-mail to en
hance a class on German newspapers she
taught last spring, when her students were
reading articles about whether former East
Germans were different than West Ger
mans. One student posed a three-sentence
question on potential differences, and in re
turn received a four-page reply, Strachota
said.
Another student, doctoral candidate
Beth Harrison, sent a message which sim
ply stated, "I'm looking for a pen pal, and

I'd like to discuss some political issues that
I've been studying in class." Harrison said
she received 10 replies that week alone.
"The response was so overwhelming,"
Harrison added.
After her success with the newspaper
class, Strachota decided to try connecting
her Introductory German class to various
German-related "newsgroups" — interest
groups formed to discuss anything from
archery to zoology on the Internet.
Strachota chose a newsgroup titled
"soc.culture.German," which included
subjects from "Schindler's List" to "Any
one know the zip code for Schifferstad?"
"After we had studied German for 10
days, the class wrote one collective letter,"
Strachota said.
The class received 10 replies from this
letter within a week, and was eager to pur
sue the idea of e-mail correspondence, Stra
chota said.
Strachota got the idea to use e-mail from
a friend teaching German at Stanford in
Berlin.
"She had a Stanford student who had ar
rived in Berlin with a list of people he want
ed to visit," Strachota said. "And he had
made these friends via an on-line news
group made up of people with similar inter-
