From AP wire reports
Dolphins sold
Video magnate H. Wayne
Huizenga announced yesterday
that he has purchased the Miami
Dolphins, his third professional
sports franchise, from the family
that founded the team in 1966.
Huizenga already owns base
ball's Florida Marlins and the
NHL Florida Panthers, both
expansion teams that began play
in 1993.
The sale is contingent on the
consent of Joe Robbie Stadium
lenders and the NFL, which in
the past has prohibited its own
ers from owning another pro
sports team. Huizenga will ask
the league to make an exception
to the rule.
With the deal, the 55-year-old
Huizenga strengthens his posi
tion as one of the most influen
tial figures in the sports and
entertainment fields.
Madden, Summerall on Fox
Yesterday, the day after the
NFL broadcast its last game for
CBS, Fox announced that it had
signed John Madden to a four
year contract as its lead football
analyst. He will be paid a report
ed $32 million, or about
$365,000 a game.
"John is not only someone
Fox wanted, but needed," Fox
Sports president David Hill said.
"John Madden is the heartbeat
of football."
At the same time, a source
close to the network confirmed
that Pat Summerall, Madden's
broadcast partner for 13 years
and a 33-year CBS veteran, also
has signed a four-year contract
with Fox.
Mays mashes Bonds
Willie Mays wasn't thrilled to
be accepting the National League
Most Valuable Player award for
his godson, Barry Bonds, and let
an entire ballroom know about
it.
"We gave him $47 million,"
Mays, a special assistant to San
Francisco Giants president Peter
Magowan, said Sunday night.
"He can pick up his award."
Bonds, who signed a record
$43.75 million six-year deal with
the Giants in December 1992,
won the NL MVP for the third
time in four seasons. Mays, a
two-time MVP and a Hall of
Famer, said his godson claimed
to be "too busy" to accept the
award and didn't sound like he
was joking in his barbs.
"Whenever you win an award,

you have to pick it up," he said at
the annual dinner of the New
York chapter of the Baseball
Writers Association of America.
Harding on thin ice
Tonya Harding basked in the
applause of shoppers while skat
ing at a mall yesterday amid
reports authorities have enough
evidence to arrest her in the
attack on rival Nancy Kerrigan.
Authorities refused to com
ment on The Oregonian newspa
per's report that investigators
have enough evidence to charge
Harding in the plot, but don't
want to act until they feel more
sure of getting a conviction.
Four men, including Hard
ing's ex-husband and bodyguard,
have been charged with conspir
acy in the Jan. 6 attack. Kerrigan
was clubbed on the knee and
forced to withdraw from the U.S.
Figure Skating Championships
in Detroit.
Falcons hire coach
Saying he was the man they
wanted all along, the Atlanta
Falcons yesterday named June
Jones to succeed Jerry Glanville
as coach.
Jones, 40, is the Falcons assis
tant head coach for offense, and
once spent four seasons as the
club's backup quarterback.
Falcons president Taylor
Smith said he's known Jones a
long time and "we felt June's the
guy we'd like to run our football
team."
Glanville was fired Jan. 4
after the Falcons finished 6-10
for the second consecutive sea
son. He had one year remaining
on a five-year contract. In four
seasons with Atlanta, Glanville
had a 28-38 record.
Cardinals fire Bugel
Joe Bugel, who received an
ultimatum before the season to
produce a winning team, was
fired yesterday from the Phoenix
Cardinals after a 7-9 finish.
The decision by owner Bill
Bidwill ended months of specula
tion about Bugel's future and
came just more than a year after
the warning to win or face dis
missal.
The Cardinals did win four of
their last five games, including
their last three, but it clearly was
not enough.
Bugel was 20-44 after four
years in his first head coaching
job. Still, he enjoyed strong sup
port from fans and players, and
some players attributed the
team's late-season success to a
desire to save Bugel's job.
