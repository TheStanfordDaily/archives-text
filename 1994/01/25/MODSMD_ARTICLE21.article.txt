# No. 1 UCLA in the hot seat as the Bruins visit the Farm this week
## Miracle at Maples III, another sequel? 
### 
Is it time for another "Miracle at
Maples?"
With the way the Stanford
men's basketball team played
against then- No. 21 California last
Thursday night, it just very well
might be.
Yet with No.l-ranked UCLA
visiting this Thursday night, the
Cardinal will need every bit of the
effort it displayed against Cal —
and then some — to dethrone the
Bruins.
Whether Stanford proves up to
the task of playing with the
nation's best Thursday evening
rests on the intensity the team dis
plays in the first half. If the Cardi
nal comes out as flat as it did two
weeks ago at Arizona, forget it —
the 15-point loss to the Wildcats
could appear mild after the Bruins
are through.
Unlike Arizona, UCIxA possess
es a talent-laden backcourt and
frontcourt. This is the most talent
ed and most cohesive UCI.A team
in years. The Bruins are ranked
No. 1 for the first time since 1983
— and this year's squad is far bet
ter. They are dangerous. The back
court of Tyus Edney and Shon
Tarver is extremely tough, and the
Bruins have seemingly found the
cure to their problem of recent

of forwards from
Artesia, Calif., that
perform a regular
high-wire act that
rattles the rims in
Westwood as much
as the faults below
rattle the ground.
On Thursday, a
packed Maples Pav
ilion will be the
stage for the next

showing of "Brothers O'Bannon."
Ed, a 6-8 junior, plays inside.
Charles, a 6-6 freshman, plays the
wing. Both can score. Both can
play defense. Both can dunk. And
with the Bruins ranked first, both
will do everything to keep them
there.
Ed alone was dangerous. But
with Charles, the Bruin frontline
has extra panache. Having grown
up together, the O'Bannon boys
complement each other on the
court. Indeed, like their abilities,

years of being a "doughnut" team even their uniforms mirror each
(nothing in the middle) with 7-foot other: Ed is 31, Charles 13.
Czechoslovakian George Zidek, The one major fault that can be
who is averaging 7.2 rebounds a pointed out about the Bruins is
game. Plus, the club has depth, that they have played a soft sched
with coach Jim Harrick comfort- ule. UCLA may be the only unde
ably using a rotation of nine play- feated team left in Division I, but
ers. the Bruins have played only two
And to anchor the mix comes a pair ranked teams this season, LSU and

Arizona.
Other than
the Pacific 10
Conference
ledger,
UCLA has
just two non
conference
tilts remain
ing on the
calendar: an
away trame at

Notre Dame, and a home contest
with Louisville.
Somehow, I get the feeling that
the Stanford team that sent .Jason
Kidd and Co. weeping back to
Berkeley last week will not be
embarrassed against the Bruins. At
guard, the Cardinal's Brevin
Knight and Dion Cross are them
selves a formidable duo. In the mid
dle, much as he did against Cal,
Coach Montgomery will find that
after Jim Morgan tires, Darren Ail
away will be a solid neutralizer on

the boards against Zidek. The ques
tion lies in whether Brent Williams
and Andy Poppink will rise to the
occasion of defending the O'Ban
nons. Ed and Charles will get their
points — it's how many that will
determine the outcome.
The last time a team rated No. 1
in the country came to the Farm
was in 1988. That year, the Cardi
nal shocked the Arizona Wildcats
82-74, in what was dubbed the
"Miracle at Maples." That Arizona
team, along with the squad that
Stanford defeated in Maples the
following year ("Miracle II"), fea
tured future NBA players Sean
Elliot and Steve Kerr.
In this era of increasing pjirity in
college basketball, the Bruins — who
are legitimate contenders for the
national title — are due for a fall.
In recent weeks, Arkansas,
North Carolina and Kansas all lost
games soon after assuming the top
position in the polls. Now, it's
UCIJVs turn in the hot seat, with
two teams in the Bay Area ready to
cool them off.
Miracle III? Could be, could be.
