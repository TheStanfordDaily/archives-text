# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Nov. 20, 1993. Big Game. California 46,
Stanford 17. Cal won back the Axe, and looked
toward a long series of Bear success against
the Cardinal in the 1993-94 athletic season.
The Stanford men's and women's basket
ball teams provided a pair of responses this
week: Stanford 88, Cal 79 and Stanford 92,
Cal 75.

With the double indemnity, basketball
style, the Stanford basketball squads demon
strated to their East Bay foes that any Weenie
successes are the exception, not the norm. And
playing a large role in these victories were
Andy Poppink and Christy Hedgpeth, this
half-fortnight's Athletes of the Week.
Poppink led the way in last Thursday's
upset of the then-21st-ranked Bears, scoring a
career-high 25 points on 8-of-17 shooting from
the field and an 8-of-12 performance from the
charity stripe. Moreover, the junior from
Tecumsah, Mi., set the tone for the evening
with his aggressive, hustling play, which led
an underdog Cardinal squad to a victory that
may have surprised the pundits, but not the
Stanford squad itself.

As compared to the men's Stanford-Cal
matchup, the Stanford women's basketball
team's Friday night contest against the Bears
seemed a veritable blowout. However, for
much of the game the Bears scraped the heels
of the Cardinal team, only being sentenced to
the dungeon of defeat in the game's second
half.
The Cardinal's success in its 92-75 victory
was due in large part to the efforts of Hedg
peth, a senior who is currently ratcheting her
way up the Stanford all-time achievement ros
ters. The guard, from Thomasville, N.C.,
scored a phenomenal 26 points in the Cardinal
victory. Even more impressively, Hedgpeth

drained five three-point shots as part of a 10-
for-18 shooting performance on the night.
However, Hedgpeth's off-the-court accom
plishments are equally impressive. She has
been named a GTE/COSIDA Academic All-
Regional star for two consecutive years, as
well as being tabbed as a Pac-10 All-Academic
First Team member last season.
