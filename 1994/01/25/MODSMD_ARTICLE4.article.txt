# Getting down to business
## Student advisory group plans outreach programs 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
Despite getting off to a slow start last quarter, the
Student Advisory Group on Undergraduate Educa
tion is now moving forward by stepping up its efforts
to reach students through town meetings and dorm
visits.
The group has p' -eady submitted to the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education a summary of the
main issues students voiced concern about at fall
quarter town meetings, according to senior Eddie
Garcia, who chairs the advisory group.
Majors, advising, residential education and
teaching evaluation topped the list, he said.
The advisory group has also placed student rep
resentatives on five of the commission's subcommit
tees. These representatives and the two student
members of the commission form the advisory
group's steering com mittee, which will draft a series
of recommendations for the commission to consider
in making its final report to University President
Gerhard Casper.
Garcia said the group will emphasize several
areas of student concern. First, he said, it will exam
ine the current distribution-requirement system,
giving serious consideration to the Cultures, Ideas
and Values program.
Other topics under consideration include the un
dergraduate advising system — "not just in the
freshman year but also how to address the sopho
more slump" — as well as teaching quality and the
teaching evaluation system.
Garcia said the group also
plans to send a student represen
tative to the review panel for writ
ing and critical thinking, which is
conducting its own study indepen
dent of the commission.
The advisory group has been
working to increase student inter
est and involvement in the com

mission's work, Garcia added. Its
"town meetings," while success
ful, have drawn only a small group
of concerned students, he said,
and now members are trying to
reach a larger audience through
dorm programs, focus groups and
one-on-one consultation with
commission members and student
groups.
Garcia said that both the com
mission and the advisory group
used fall quarter as "a time to get
organized." He expects both

groups' activities and workloads
to increase as the year progresses.
The Council of Presidents
formed the advisory group last
October to supplement the Com
mission on Undergraduate Educa
tion and extend student input
beyond the two student represen
tatives who sit on the commission.
The dorm programs are off to "a
good start," Garcia said. The advi
sory group sponsored a program in
Toyon last week attended by com
mission member Nelee Langmuir,

a French and Italian professor. The
group also plans to meet with the
leaders of various student groups to
discuss their concerns about the
commission's work.
"I feel like we've created a very
good base, and we're looking for
ward to gathering . . . student
input," said advisory group mem
ber Ying-Ying Goh, a member of
the Council of Presidents.
Junior Luz Herrera, who
serves as one of the two student
representatives on the commis

sion, said the advisory group will
probably organize focus groups in
which students are brought
together to discuss their concerns
about specific topics.
The group will also attempt to
get student input through an
ASSU questionnaire, she said,
adding that the commission's pri
orities seem to lie along the same
lines as the advisory group's.
Commission chair James Shee
han said he hopes the student
group continues its involvement

in the commission's deliberations,
as it is the main link between the
commission and students.
"We think of Ithe groupl as a
way of sampling student opinion
on these matters, which is of
great interest to us," he said.
"We're very interested in working
with them as closely as we can."
Although "it took a lot of work,"
Goh said, the group has progressed
"from a loose group of people... to
a core who can really lead (it] in
the direction they want to go."
