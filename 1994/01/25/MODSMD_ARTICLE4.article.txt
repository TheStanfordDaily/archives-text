# Getting down to business
## Student advisory group plans outreach programs 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
Despite getting off to a slow start last quarter, the
Student Advisory Group on Undergraduate Educa
tion is now moving forward by stepping up its efforts
to reach students through town meetings and dorm
visits.
The group has p' -eady submitted to the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education a summary of the
main issues students voiced concern about at fall
quarter town meetings, according to senior Eddie
Garcia, who chairs the advisory group.
Majors, advising, residential education and
teaching evaluation topped the list, he said.
The advisory group has also placed student rep
resentatives on five of the commission's subcommit
tees. These representatives and the two student
members of the commission form the advisory
group's steering com mittee, which will draft a series
of recommendations for the commission to consider
in making its final report to University President
Gerhard Casper.
Garcia said the group will emphasize several
areas of student concern. First, he said, it will exam
ine the current distribution-requirement system,
giving serious consideration to the Cultures, Ideas
and Values program.
Other topics under consideration include the un
dergraduate advising system — "not just in the
freshman year but also how to address the sopho
more slump" — as well as teaching quality and the
teaching evaluation system.
