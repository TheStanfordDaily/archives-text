# 'He's done just about everything a human being can do to help'
## University to honor benefactor 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Peter Bing has given a lot to Stan
ford, but when the University wanted
to give something back to its benefac
tor, he turned the award into yet anoth
er gift.
Bing, a Stanford trustee and former
student body president, will be present
ed with the Degree of Uncommon Man
by the Stanford Associates — a group of
Stanford alumni and volunteers — at
an award dinner Feb. 6.
But Bing said that if he were to at
tend a dinner in his honor, it should be
combined with a workshop to encour
age volunteerism and philanthropy
among current Stanford students.
Stanford Associates Secretary Jean
Coblentz, who is helping to coordinate
the workshop, said Bing wants the cer
emony to leave behind some lasting re
sults.
Twenty-four students selected by

the group will there
fore meet that after
noon with Bing, Uni
versity President Ger
hard Casper, former
University President
Donald Kennedy, vol
unteers and alumni to
brainstorm ideas to
improve awareness
among students and

alumni of the need for volunteerism
and philanthropy. The results will be
implemented by next fall and continue
over the long term, Coblentz said.
Students were selected primarily on
the basis of campus leadership from
names submitted by campus adminis
trators and resident fellows, she said.
The Degree of Uncommon Man is
conferred by the Associates to recognize
"rare and extraordinary service to
Stanford University," said Stanford As
sociates spokeswoman Sandy Cover.
"Because [the University) does not

award any honorary degrees, it is con
sidered by many (as) the highest award
that Stanford gives," she said.
Bing was nominated for the award
by Cecil Green — of Green Library
fame — because of his efforts to im
prove myriad aspects of University life
since his undergraduate days some 40
years ago. "He's done just about every
thing a human being can do to help the
University," said David Glen, the direc
tor of principal gifts in the Office of De
velopment.
Nineteen people — including indus
try pioneers William Hewlett and David
Packard, as well as four "uncommon
women" — have received the award
since the group began awarding it in the
19505. "It's only given when someone
deserves it," Cover said.
The Stanford Associates is the oldest
fund-raising group on campus, founded
in the 1930s to supplement endowment

income, but now serving as an
honor society. Members are vol
unteers who have served the Uni
versity for more than five years
and other "friends of the Univer
sity," Cover said.
The name of the degree stems
from Herbert Hoover's quote,
"We believe in equal opportunity
for all, but we know that this
includes the opportunity to rise to
leadership — in other words, to be
uncommon."
