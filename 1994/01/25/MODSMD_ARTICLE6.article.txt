## Chaparral revamps image, aims for top of funny business 
### T.W. Mark Hung 
Forget the late show wars on the national television
networks — a good old-fashioned East-West rivalry is
brewing in the college humor arena.
Stanford Chaparral, the campus humor magazine,
is attempting to make its mark as one of the premier
publications of its kind — right up there with the Har
vard Lampoon — after recovering from a couple of
years of disarray, said Editor in Chief Tony Sirna.
Founded in 1899, the Chaparral is one of the oldest
college humor publications in the country, second only
to the Lampoon. It has been published since 1906 by
the Hammer and Coffin Society, which Sirna, the pres
ident, describes as "not a secret society, but a society
with a lot of secrets."
But because of its somewhat cliquish humor and ir
regular distribution, the Chaparral has had a spotty
presence on campus in the last few years.
Its new editors, Sirna and Doug Miro, are striving to
change this perception.
Comparing the Chaparral with the Lampoon, Sirna
said, "We are trying to be as good as the Chappie has
been. We are not really trying to compare to others."
Business Manager Raja Benchekroun, on the other
hand, had fewer reservations. "We'd like, in five to 10
years, to be as recognizable as the Harvard lampoon,"
she said.

Chaparral staff members clown around a lot, but they don't jest when
it comes to producing a premier humor magazine.
