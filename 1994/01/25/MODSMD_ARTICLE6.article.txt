## Chaparral revamps image, aims for top of funny business 
### T.W. Mark Hung 
Forget the late show wars on the national television
networks — a good old-fashioned East-West rivalry is
brewing in the college humor arena.
Stanford Chaparral, the campus humor magazine,
is attempting to make its mark as one of the premier
publications of its kind — right up there with the Har
vard Lampoon — after recovering from a couple of
years of disarray, said Editor in Chief Tony Sirna.
Founded in 1899, the Chaparral is one of the oldest
college humor publications in the country, second only
to the Lampoon. It has been published since 1906 by
the Hammer and Coffin Society, which Sirna, the pres
ident, describes as "not a secret society, but a society
with a lot of secrets."
But because of its somewhat cliquish humor and ir
regular distribution, the Chaparral has had a spotty
presence on campus in the last few years.
Its new editors, Sirna and Doug Miro, are striving to
change this perception.
Comparing the Chaparral with the Lampoon, Sirna
said, "We are trying to be as good as the Chappie has
been. We are not really trying to compare to others."
Business Manager Raja Benchekroun, on the other
hand, had fewer reservations. "We'd like, in five to 10
years, to be as recognizable as the Harvard lampoon,"
she said.

Chaparral staff members clown around a lot, but they don't jest when
it comes to producing a premier humor magazine.
Chapparal staff members have
begun improving their image by
increasing distribution and trying
to appeal to a more diverse sense
of humor.
The latest issue of the Cha
parral had a mixture of topics that
ranged from the NAFTA debate to
the death of actor River Phoenix.
In addition to the usual satire
pieces, "interactive humor" arti
cles were also present, such as
quizzes and origami, Miro said.

"Our articles range from toilet
humor to political humor," Miro
said. "We have also tried to strike a
balance between universal and Stan
ford humor." This balance is neces
sary to attract advertisers, he added.
The magazine's circulation
route has also been improved. "We
distributed 3,000 of the first issue
and 5,000 of the second issue last
quarter," said Miro, a senior
English major. "A copy was deliv
ered to every room in all under
grad dorms." In addition, a fresh
man issue was published at the
beginning of the quarter.
The editors hope to publish in
magazine format twice each quar
ter, and to extend distribution to

graduate dorms, academic depart
ments, and Palo Alto and Menlo
Park bookstores.
Freshman Rudolpho Delson,
the Chaparral's new circulation
manager, said he feels that the
magazine presents "a very wel
coming environment."
To broaden its appeal and
improve its organization, the Cha
parral is also actively recruiting
new writers, artists and business
staff through flyers and dorm vis
its, Miro said.
"We are especially looking to
recruit freshmen so as to maintain
a continuity in the magazine,"
Miro said. "We need new blood to
continue the tradition."

In addition, the staff is trying
to sell more ads, and do more PR
and marketing of the Chaparral,"
said Benchekroun. "An organiza
tional structure has also been set
up so that staff transitions can be
accomplished more smoothly."
The Chaparral is currently
funded by the ASSU Publications
Board and its own advertising rev
enues. Since publishing in the
glossy magazine format is more
expensive than in tabloid, more
revenue is needed to maintain the
success of the current format,
Miro said. He hopes to obtain
additional funding from the ASSU
fee request process.
Miro said he has two long term

goals for the magazine. "We would
like to establish it as a source of
invigorating entertainment on
campus so that people are eager to
see it, eager to work for it, and
eager to laugh at it,"he said. "In
addition, we would like to see it as
a stepping stone for students who
are looking for jobs in this area
after school."
While the Harvard Lampoon
may have garnered more media
attention due to its alumni in such
prominent shows as the Saturday
Night Live and Late Night with
Conan O'Brien, the Chaparral has
not done too poorly either — its
most illustrious alumnus is now a
writer for The Simpsons.
