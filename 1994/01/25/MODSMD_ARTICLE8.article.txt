# Rats! Alondra plagued by mice

Alondra residents had a few uninvited guests
waiting for them when they returned from their ski
trip last week: mice.
Some second-floor inhabitants in the Florence
Moore Hall dorm have been discovering mice in
their rooms since Jan. 17. Though far from being an
uncontrollable swarm, the mice have appeared fre
quently enough to cause alarm.
"The count is now up to five or six (captured),"
said Resident Assistant Polly Brown.
Alondra resident Bob Murata said he suspects
the creatures hide around the heating pipes. The
first mouse, found exploring the bottom of a bath
tub, was caught and released outside. Other rodents
did not fare as well, since traps were then set to

solve the problem.
According to Brown, chemical extermination is
not an option. "There are too many people. Facilities
will put traps in anyone's room who wants them.
They can't do much more than that.
Since the discovery of the mice, resident Belinda
Sye said she has noticed an increase in cleaning
and vacuuming in the dorm. Besides being more
cautious about keeping food in the rooms, the
Alondrans can only hope the problem will take care
of itself.
In the meantime, Sye is "avoiding the ground" in
her room and sharing the feeling of paranoia
expressed by some of her dormmates.
"While I was playing high notes on my clarinet,"
Murata said, "twice, I thought a mouse answered
me back."
