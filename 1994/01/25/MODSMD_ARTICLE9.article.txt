U.S. rejects Hosnia borders
PARIS (AP) — France proposed
resolving the civil war in Bosnia by
imposing borders on the Croats, Serbs
and Muslims, but the idea was rejected
by Secretary of State Warren Christo
pher, U.S. officials said yesterday.
In Washington, President Clinton
expressed pessimism that outside efforts
could stop the strife in the former
Yugoslavia.
"The killing is a function of a political
fight between three factions. Until they
agree to quit doing it, it's going to con
tinue," Clinton said. "I don't think the
international community has the capaci
ty to stop people within the nation from
their civil war until they decide to do it."
Christopher arrived in Europe to find

the NATO resolve on Bosnia splintering
just two weeks after a NATO summit.
China to discuss prisoners
PARIS (AP) — China pledged yester
day to discuss U.S. concerns about 235
political prisoners, a step toward meeting
human rights conditions set by President
Clinton, U.S. officials said.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher
characterized his meeting with Chinese
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen as positive.
However, he added, "We have not made
enough progress to justify my saying there
has been significant overall progress."
The meeting was the latest in a series
of human rights discussions that are a
precursor to U.S. renewal of China's
favorable trade access to U.S. markets.
