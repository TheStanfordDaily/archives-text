# Senate debates plan to redistrict
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night
discussed the recently proposed
amendment to the ASSU Consti
tution to downsize the senate
and create district-based under
graduate elections.
Although no consensus was
reached during the 45 minutes
of debate, the senate is scheduled
to vote next week on whether to
hold a special election next
month for students to ratify the
amendment.
Senators expressed mixed
feelings about the proposal's in
tentions in their questions to un
dergraduate senator Gabe
Lucas, the bill's author.
"1 feel like this is going to be a
problem for minority senators,"
said undergraduate senator
Vanessa Alvarado, responding to
the bill's intention to create six
geographical districts and four
grade-level districts.
"1 see a real danger in saying
that, just because I live in a
place, that I have to represent
those people," said undergradu
ate senator Anietie Ekanem.
But Lucas argued that sena
tors will be more inclined to lis
ten to students' concerns in their
district under his bill.
"I'm not saying the senator
must represent a district," he
said. "We have to consider people
coming to a senator. . . . By insti
tuting geographical districting,
in the eyes of the voter, you have
the option to go to your represen
tative."
But Ekanem argued that sen
ators must be empowered to rep
resent viewpoints which cut
across segments of the campus.
"I'm not convinced I'll be a bet
ter senator if I go door to door,"
he said.
In addition, several senators
objected to Lucas' intention to
hurry the process by holding a
special election next month.
Although graduate senator
Neil Crellin said he supports the
concept of districting, he
described the process as "basical
ly precluding any open discus
sion of why we're making these
changes."
"I'm deeply worried that this
bill will not receive the attention
it deserves," he said.
Graduate senator Sanford
Dickert expressed a similar senti
ment, pointing to the fact that
the proposal was unveiled with
out prior consultation of the sen
ate.
"What I see here is basically a
collection of nebulous sugges
tions," he said.
Despite objections to the bill's
specifics, senators offered sup
port for the general idea of
restructuring the senate.
"I think Gabe did a great job
of bringing up concerns voiced
by students," said undergradu
ate senator Ramy Saad. "The
senate is too large, and there
isn't strong enough representa
tion.
"This is definitely a step in the
right direction," he added. "It
gives us something to work
with."
