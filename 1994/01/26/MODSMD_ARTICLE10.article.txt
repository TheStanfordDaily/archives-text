## Clinton urges Congress to pass health care plan President calls first-year successes a 'hopeful beginning' 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Standing
before Congress for his first State of the
Union address, President Clinton
promised a forceful effort to enact
health and welfare reform, and issued
an impassioned challenge to lawmakers
to attack the nation's crime crisis with a
ban on assault weapons.
"Our work has just begun," he
declared last night in a speech that last
ed more than an hour. Democrats inter
rupted it many times with applause
while Republicans were restrained.
Clinton, who has yet to veto a bill,
said he would do so if Congress passed a
health-reform plan that does not meet
his standard of universal coverage.
"It is inevitable and imperative" that
the health-care system be overhauled,
Clinton said, calling it an issue on which
"the people are way ahead of the politi
cians."
Turning to crime, Clinton voiced
strong support for legislation that would
put 100,000 more police officers on the
beat, send three-time felons to prison
for life and ban assault weapons.
"Violent crime and the fear it pro
vokes are crippling our society, limiting
personal freedom and fraying the ties
that bind us," Clinton said, sounding an
election-year theme popular both among
both Republicans and Democrats.
"Let us give our children a future,"
the president said, his voice wavering.
In the formal Republican response,
Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole signaled a
fierce battle lies ahead over Clinton's
health care plan, saying Clinton's plan
meant "more cost, less choice . . . more
government control."
Displaying a huge, complicated (low
chart that he said indicated the bureau

cracy needed to operate the Clinton
health plan, Dole pointed to the very
bottom and said: "You and I are way
down here."
Dole called instead for a more modest
proposal that he said would offer greater
access to health care for all.
Democrats gave Clinton 17 standing
ovations during the speech, while stony
faced Republicans kept their hands in
their laps as the president discussed his
prime objectives for the next year:
health care, welfare reform, the anti
crime legislation and worker training
programs.
Clinton took advantage of — and
some credit for — the improving econo
my, calling for Congress to "continue
our journey of renewal" by enacting the
remainder of his domestic program.
"We replaced drift and deadlock with
renewal and reform," Clinton said.
He addressed the nation at a time
when both the economy and his own
approval ratings are on the upswing.
"My fellow Americans . . . what is the
state of our union? It is growing
stronger. But it must be stronger still,"
he said.
Clinton devoted scant attention to
foreign affairs in his speech, though he
underscored U.S. determination to sup
port Russia's struggle with democracy
and economic reforms.
And he said his administration was
"working to achieve a Korean peninsula
free of nuclear weapons." Earlier,
administration officials told some law
makers it might send Patriot missiles to
South Korea as the West struggles with
North Korea to allow nuclear weapons
inspections, a congressional source said.
One danger that still confronts the

world, he said, is "fanatics who seek to
cripple the world's cities with terror."
In the speech — one of Clinton's
longest — the president made a strong
pitch for overhauling the nation's wel
fare system at the same time health care
is reformed.
His welfare proposal — yet to be
introduced — would put a two-year limit
on benefits, coupling it with new educa
tion and job training programs.
Clinton said the package also would
withhold certain benefits to pregnant
teens. "We will say to teen-agers, 'If you
have a child out of wedlock, we will no
longer give you a check to set up a sepa
rate household.' We want families to
stay together."
He also promised to go after parents
who don't pay their child support. "Peo
ple who bring children into this world
can't just walk away," he said.
Aides said the White House will not
introduce a welfare reform bill until the
spring, after the health care measure
has made some progress.
Clearly the centerpiece of Clinton's
agenda remained his health-care plan —
which would extend coverage all Ameri
cans, largely by requiring all employers
to pay 80 percent of the cost.
He called for bipartisan support for
the effort. "This year we will make his
tory by reforming the health care sys
tem."
Waving a pen in the air, Clinton
declared: "If you send me legislation
that does not guarantee every American
private health insurance that can never
be taken away, you will force me to take
this pen, veto the legislation, and we'll
come right back here and start over
again."
