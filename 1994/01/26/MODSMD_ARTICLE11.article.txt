## Singer to pay at least $10 million; blow to criminal probe

SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP)
Michael Jackson settled a child molesta
tion lawsuit yesterday on terms that left
his 14-year-old accuser "very happy"
and the singer proclaiming his inno
cence.
Terms of the out-of-court agreement
were confidential, although a source
said it was at least $10 million.
The settlement probably could end
the criminal investigation, experts said,
but Jackson's problems were far from
over.
"I am very happy with the resolution
of this matter," said Larry Feldman,
attorney for the boy, now 14. The boy,
Feldman told reporters, was also "very
happy with the resolution of this mat
ter."
Feldman said nothing in the settle
ment pertained to the criminal probe.
He also didn't rule out having the boy
testify in any criminal proceeding.
"Nobody has bought anyone's
silence," Feldman said.
"We have been talking to the district
attorney all along," he said. "The dis

trict attorney has taken all of our evi
dence."
Nonetheless, the out-of-court settle
ment is a blow to the criminal probe.
Had the case gone to court, prosecutors
could have used the testimony and depo
sitions in their pursuit of criminal
charges.
"You could call it the rich man's
exemption in a child molestation case,"
said Harlan Braun, a prominent Los
Angeles defense attorney. "What it
means is the person who buys off a
minor gets away with it. It turns these
sex cases into a private dispute."
Feldman and Jackson attorneys
Johnnie Cochran and Howard Weitz
man met privately in the chambers of
Superior Court Judge David Rothman
before the announcement.
"We signed off on the deal. That was
it," Feldman said.
Jackson did not issue a statement but
insists he did nothing wrong. According
to his attorneys, he will speak out about
the case at an undetermined time.
"Michael Jackson has maintained his

innocence since the beginning of this
matter and now, since this matter will
soon be concluded, he still maintains
that innocence," Jackson's attorneys
said in a statement. 112
"The resolution of this case is in no
way an admission of guilt by Michael
Jackson. In short, he is an innocent man
who does not intend to have his career
and his life destroyed by rumors and
innuendo."
The lawsuit filed in September
alleged that Jackson committed sexual
battery, seduction, willful misconduct,
intentional infliction of emotional dis
tress, fraud and negligence in a cam
paign to entice the boy last year.
Based on the boy's allegations,
authorities in Los Angeles and Santa
Barbara counties began a criminal probe
that has continued for five months. No
charges have been filed.
An out-of-court settlement in the
civil case could severely diminish the
state's criminal probe because, in Cali
fornia, victims of sexual abuse can't be
forced to testify against their will.
