# Russia may face new financial woes

MOSCOW (AD — Russia's gov
ernment promised a colossal farm
subsidy program yesterday that
seemed likely to set off another
punishing round of inflation and
undermine already faltering mar
ket reforms.
The announcement came as the
fate of the last aggressive reformer
in the government, Finance Minis
ter Boris Fyodorov, rested in Pres
ident Boris Yeltsin's hands.
Fyodorov, who helped brake big
spending programs like the one
announced yesterday, resigned last
week in a Cabinet shake-up that
raised doubts both at home and
abroad about the future of market
reforms in Russia.
Yeltsin has not yet said whether

he will accept Fyodorov's resigna
tion and there were reports the two
men might meet today.
Prime Minister Viktor Cher
nomyrdin, meanwhile, went to
Russia's agricultural heartland to
unveil a farm program that could
cost 100 trillion rubles — hundreds
of millions of dollars — in the next
few years, the Interfax news agen
cy said.
I le also said the government will
spend 4 trillion rubles in the next
few months alone to pay bills,
wages and agriculture subsidies
from 1993.
Virtually the only way the gov
ernment can spend this kind of
money is to print it — the classic
recipe for runaway inflation.

In what could be a warning to
Yeltsin that he faces a fight if he
decides to keep Fyodorov, Cher
nomyrdin had his central banker
and his agriculture minister at his
side.
Fyodorov had said he'd stay in
the government only if Central
Bank chairman Viktor
Gerashchenko, whom he blames
for granting inflationary credits to
state enterprises, and Agriculture
Minister Alexander Zaveryukha, a
collective farm director in the Sovi
et era, were removed.
Chernomyrdin "obviously want
ed to show he would stand by
them," said economics analyst
Mikhail Berger of the newspaper
Izvestia.
