Federal quake relief funds
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Clinton adminis
tration wants $7.5 billion in federal spending to
aid earthquake victims in California, officials said
yesterday. They urged Congress to act quickly to
speed the flow of relief funds.
White House Budget Director Leon Panetta
said the administration would send Congress an
emergency supplemental budget request today for
$6.61 billion that would be added to $897 million
in contingency federal funds that already have
started flowing to California.
Panetta called the $7.5 billion estimate a
"placeholder" that would likely rise as the admin
istration receives more complete damage esti
mates.
In California, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson wel

corned the president's announcement, but said he
was concerned the cost estimates are too low.
Radiation tests continue
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Energy Depart
ment is still conducting more than 200 experi
ments on humans, including many involving radi
ation, but is following strict ethical procedures and
gaining proper consent, Secretary Hazel O'lieary
said yesterday.
Most of the radiation experiments involve low
level trace doses of radiation under guidelines in
effect at the department since 1991, she said.
Department officials said about 40 percent of the
experiments are believed to involve radiation,
mostly in the development of diagnostic proce
dures.
