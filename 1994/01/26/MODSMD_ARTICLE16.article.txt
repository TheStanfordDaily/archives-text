CUE should examine
expansion of advising
to meet student needs

Last November, in The
Daily's poll of Stanford
undergrads, 65 percent of
students agreed that the current
undergraduate advising system is
"inadequate." In the Commission
on Undergraduate Education's
study of advising, serious consider
ation should be given to this failure
to meet students' needs.
In the summary of suggestions
to the advising associate program
for the upcoming year, different
students expressed a vast range of
opinions about the best way to
improve the advising system. Some
said too much advising was "obnox
ious" while others felt there was a
large need for more "individualized
attention."
In all cases, the most desirable
qualities in both adviser and advis
ing associates were knowledge
about the academic resources and
options available on campus, in
addition to friendliness, accessibili
ty and interest in the students'
individual situations. More pointed
comments suggested that some
advisers and advising associates
should read Courses and Degrees
and show up more than once a
quarter.
It seems clear that students have
varied ideas about what is helpful,
and that the current system, while
over-advising some students, is
leaving others without enough
guidance.
Much of this problem derives
from the fact that advisers and AAs
are volunteers, and their commit
ments to their students vary from
person to person. Freshmen who
are assigned advisers and AAs
based on summer questionnaires
are subject to the luck of the draw
in getting an appropriate amount
of support.
Furthermore, the current advis

ing system seems to focus mainly
on students' first year at Stanford,
helping advisees become acclimat
ed to the University and providing
assistance in selecting each quar
ter's courses. While this is a neces
sary part of a good advising system,
once students leave their freshman
dorm they often find themselves
without much help in defining and
meeting their own educational
goals.
The prevalence of the so-called
"sophomore slump" demonstrates
that many of the most crucial deci
sions students face, such as choos
ing a major and examining the best
academic preparation for various
career options, occur after the
freshman year.
However, at this point in a stu
dent's tenure, meetings with advis
ers and advising associates are
sadly no longer part of the standard
routine.
For many sophomores, Stan
ford's flexibility in not demanding
that students declare a major
immediately is also problematic; it
keeps them from having a knowl
edgeable department faculty advis
er close at hand.
What is needed, then, is a group
of well-informed staff members
who can provide the additional per
sonalized advice that some fresh
men need, as well as the informa
tion that undeclared sophomores
and juniors need to choose the best
major for their own academic
careers.
The Undergraduate Advising
Center has shown the benefits of
this centralized concept in its pre
professional advising staff. Pre
medical students' prolific use of the
UAC's professional advising pro
gram clearly demonstrates just
how effective a centralized, profes
sional advising staff can be.
To provide this critical academic
support, CUE should consider rec
ommending a centralized advising
staff in addition to the residence
based advisers who can provide the
individual attention students need
to make informed decisions about
their own academic and career
tracks.
