## A 						few thoughts on finality 
### 
WITH THE EARTH shifting and
grinding beneath our feet, and
half the country buried under
sheets of icy snow, it is almost possible to
believe the prophecy of the approaching
apocalypse. Recall the preview of the
movie "Intersection": dramatic flashes of
Richard Gere and Sharon Stone spliced
with footage of a car about to crash, with
a voice which demands, "If this were your
last day alive, what would you do? What
would you change? Who would you love?"
Or not. Bad movies commonly remind
us of the reality that the days stretch
ahead of us without end, January flowing
into February, March slipping toward
June.
And so I name the days, I name the
years. 1 count them to bring me sleep as
others traffic sheep in the hope of sum
moning a new day. Sleep always does
come eventually, and a new day is never a
surprise. It is as habitual as breath, as
unnoticed and as necessary.
For now, assign names to the simple
things. Choose your own words, and
don't worry too much about their order,
or who's listening. Think out loud and
write in your head; give words to the
things that you understand. I've been
choosing words for you since October,
and now January is almost out and I'm
trying to think of a way to draw things to
a close.
Let me tell you this: I've been wonder
ing about you for four months now. I've

wondered if you write letters, if you sleep
through the night, about your gods and
ghosts. It amazes me how distant people
can be in such close proximity. Are you
curious about the faces you pass? Do you
ever wonder where they would lead you if
you slipped toward their lives, if you
grabbed onto their coattails and wouldn't
let go? It has become so easy to pass
through these days untouched and
touching no one.
A touch can begin or end with the
hands, and I study my palms and wonder
where each line begins and ends: an old
address, an empty field, the sea? We carry
around these awkward tablets of our
lives, lined by all that they've touched,
and apologize every time they accidental
ly graze another's shoulder or arm. We
shove them in our pockets, and wonder
what to do with them when we're ner
vous. They are lined with all our touches
and years, and if they cannot predict our
future, at least our hands are maps of our
past.
Memorize the details of every passing
day. If you don't remember the angle of
the sun slanting through the blinds, the
wrinkled body of each fallen leaf, the
morning moon floating at half mast, who
will? If you don't notice, if it passes us all
by, who will tell the story, chronicle our
time?
Live as hard as you can inside the
storm of these years. Play your jazz
records, count the beats of this life. How

many days did it take to bring you to this
one? Have I, have you, neglected to count
them? Only neglect causes the deteriora
tion of relationships: "Not to see you
when you stand before me. Not to think of
you in the little things. Not to make the
road wide for you, the table spread for
you. To choose you out of habit, not
desire, to pass the flower seller without a
thought ... To say your name without
hearing it, to assume it is mine to call,"
(Jeanette Winterson).
What has happened to someone you
love since you last said their name? Assign
their name to the simple things â€” trees,
moon, light.
Quick, if you were speeding toward the
apocalypse, what would you name, whom
would you call? Would you raise up the
tablets of your hands and grip onto this
life, swearing out all the things you'd no
longer neglect?
Still, there is time. There is time for
details and time for the little things. Let
your hands do what they were meant for:
touching other hands. Complete
strangers, imagine this now: slipping
together toward each other's lives.

Nicole will miss the stream of letters this
weekly wordsmith's bacchanal has
prompted.
