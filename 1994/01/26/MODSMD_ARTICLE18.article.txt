## Theories abound concerning Palm Drive's disrepair 
### 
WHILE A DOGGED FEW worry
over the composition of the
quark, a larger share of the Stan
ford community has puzzled over an even
greater enigma: Why is Palm Drive in
such shabby condition? A number of the
ories have been propounded over the
decades, but it is only now, through the
power of the Freedom of Information
Act, that we can report the true cause.
look first at some of the theories.
Their very breadth shows the intellectual
richness of Stanford. One point of view
has been that the road is being main
tained for its antiquarian value. Many
guide books note the condition of the
road, and Japanese visitors are anxious to
photograph the plaque (at the bottom of
the oval) that reads: "Macadamus Fecit."
A related view is that the age of the
surface evidences not an aesthetic object,
but is instead an Engineering School pro
ject. What is the half-life of a surface sub
ject to the volume and velocity of traffic
encountered? School of Engineering
Dean Jim Gibbons robustly denies this,
but we have been suckered before by
engineering projects. (Consider Meyer.)

Two economic theories exist — one a
simple cost theory, the other a
political/economic one. The cost theory
naively states that the University doesn't
have enough money to repair the road.
Only a modicum of thought shows this to
be a foolish view, put forward by foolish
economists. The University has resur
faced a number of roads in recent months
and the avoidance of Palm Drive is obvi
ous.
The other economic theory, propound
ed by Prof. David Brady, the political the
orist, is that the lack of repair is a strate
gic move to compel local cities to go along
with the University's push for a Sand
Hill Road extension.
The war-field surface, runs this argu
ment, is a subtle form of blackmail that
illustrates the inadequacy of the current
road system. The implicit signal to sur
rounding city councils is, "put in the
Sand Hill Road extension and we'll
smooth out the mine field."
None of these theories lacks plausibil
ity, but all have been shown to be incor
rect by a recent discovery (another
example of beautiful theories being beat

up by ugly gangs of facts.) For over 30
years, there has been a conspiracy
between University officials and busi
ness interests to allow the road to decay.
The true story, pried out of the
Hoover Library's Glenn Campbell
Archive, shows the original, unholy
alliance between business and the Uni
versity was first forged by then-President
J. Wallace Sterling. Sterling entered into
a covenant that featured the transfer
each year of $50,000 to the University in
return for no repair. An escalator clause,
tied to Stanford tuition rates, has now
increased the annual payoff to $300,000.
Papers in the Donald Kennedy Nook
of the Glenn Campbell Archive show that
the Sterling arrangement was continued,
with equal stealth, during the adminis
trations of Richard Lyman and Donald
Kennedy. The degree of Mr. Casper's
involvement (What does he know? When
did he find out?) is not clear.
But what is clear is that we know the
conspirators. One element is the Stanford
administration. And the money is coming
from: Jiffy Lube, Midas Muffler (Interna
tional), Sears Auto Repair, Harry's Wheel

Aligning Service (local), the Michelin tire
company (alleged to be French), and
Johnson and eJohnson (American Tylenol
producer).
This business consortium has a clear
financial interest — not only because of
profits from the status quo, but also
because their sordid gains increase expo
nentially as the quality of the road surface
decreases.
Ventilation of the truth may make you
free, but it won't fix the road. Now that
we know the facts, it is time for the com
munity to mobilize its resources. We can
take a set of steps, starting with "Fill in
the Holes Saturday."
On Jan. 29,1 invite you, at noon, to
attend a rally in the Oval and bring with
you a pocketful of peanut shells to throw
into one of the holes.
If each of us brought just 15 used
peanut shells, the consortium would be
overturned.
It is better to throw just one little
peanut than to curse the pothole.
