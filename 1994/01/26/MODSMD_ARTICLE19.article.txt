# Halftime ticket plan an unmitigated scam
## 
### 
On Thursday night the Stanford
men's basketball team defeated Cal in
front of a sellout crowd; the women's
team has been drawing record atten
dance this season as well. It is exciting,
for both the fans and the teams, to see
this support — the hardwood of Maples
Pavilion has found its sixth man.
A dark cloud looms, however, directly
above the center ("roped off") portion of
the student section. The student section,
per se, has been restructured to occupy
only the ends of the bleachers. It doesn't
matter if you get to the game a day early

to nab a good seat — the best you can do
is 30-yard-line territory. That is, unless
you happen to be a member of the new
"Cardinal Sixth Man Club." Just pay to
become a member and you will get a nice
red t-shirt and a couple of chicken wings
at Halftime Sports Bar before the game .
. . oh, and don't worry about rushing
over to Maples because you can show up
five minutes before tip-off and still get
the best seats in the house. What a deal!
And here is the real kicker — you don't
even have to be a Stanford student or
Stanford-affiliated to lay your claim to
the "members only" section.
In past years, a general admission
ticket (or season pass) and your SUID
allowed you to sit anywhere in the stu
dent-section floor-level bleachers on the

east-side, space permitting of course.
Starting last year students did not even
need tickets to buy tickets. But now,
student fans (non-member student fans,
that is) have been forced out of their
prime seating area, pushed to the ends
of the bleachers and the balcony far
above.
I am not appeasing the value of the
crowd, the sixth man. On the contrary, I
think the new level of fan support for
our basketball teams is grand. But I
don't think it is right to take over the
student general admission seating for a
special "club members only" section.
The members can cheer just as loud
with the rest of the fans, and they are
entitled to a center seat if they get there
early enough (or they can always pur-

chase reserved seating tickets on the
other side if they so choose).
When the men take on UCLA this
Thursday, you can bet it will be another
sellout, and I know I will be arriving
very early in order to get a good seat.
The "members only" section will surely
be sparse, however, as the members will
be off nibbling treats at Halftime's with
no worry of finding a seat at the game.
Well, in the words of the fans to the ref
erees last week, that is bullshit.
I do believe I will just take a nice mid
court seat for myself and cheer on the
Cardinal as they upset the No. 1 Bruins.
I hope everyone will join me.
