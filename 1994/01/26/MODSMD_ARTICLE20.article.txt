## Magnetic signals key to foretelling earthquakes Loma Prieta Earthquake studies reveal possible methods to predict temblors 
### Kevin Armstrong 
As a nation watched the 1989 World
Series on television, as commuters hurried
home across the Bay Bridge, and as Stan
ford students sat down in their dining
halls, the world began to shake.
South of Palo Alto, nestled in the
foothills near Mount Loma Prieta, the San
Andreas fault sprang to life, releasing
energy measured at 7.1 on the Richter
scale.
This event, however sudden as it may
have been to those experiencing it, may
have broadcast its own arrival through an
extended emission of electromagnetic
wave energy, according to Electrical Engi
neering Prof. Antony Fraser-Smith and
Assoc. Geophysics Prof. Simon Klemperer.
And though the recent Northridge
earthquake was outside the vicinity of
their area of study, the researchers are
still confident in their findings from the
1989 quake.
The Northridge earthquake, by virtue
of erupting on an unknown fault, was
located outside the net of antennas the
researchers set up in the greater Los
Angeles area.
A concurrent magnetic storm, which
helped to mask the signals that precede an

earthquake, didn't make data collection
any easier.
"[The magnetic storm 1 leaves us a bit
less sensitive than usual, but there is no
doubt that there was no big precursor,"
Fraser-Smith said.
Sun's energy signaled earthquake
Near the epicenter of the Loma Prieta
earthquake, a sensitive antenna was built
to detect ultra-low frequency (ULF) mag
netic energy given off by the sun.
This antenna recorded levels of noise 10
times greater than normal for a period of
12 days prior to the Loma Prieta quake.
On Oct. 17, three hours before the
quake, ULF levels rocketed to more than
100 times normal for a brief three-hour
span before the earth shook.
Could such a phenomenon be linked to
the impending temblor, or was timing
merely a coincidence?
Fraser-Smith and Klemperer hypothe
size that water pores five to 20 miles deep
in the earth may have slowly linked up and
collectively "rebroadcast" the incoming
ULF. This larger body of water would
have greater conductivity than its collec
tive smaller parts, causing a rise in ULF


Dongmin Shim — Daily
levels.
The water pores would come
together in this model as the earth
moves and shifts in the days prior
to an earthquake.
Research into the possibilities of
abnormal ULF levels has been con
ducted around the world, from
Israel to China to Pasadena to
right here at Stanford, where
researchers have taken interest in
assessing the likelihood of a geolog
ical link.
Expanding quake detection
Fraser-Smith has overseen the
establishment of new recording
stations near other faults in an
attempt to detect signals from
other quakes.
Klemperer has tried to explain
the phenomenon through correlat
ing mathematical and geologic
models.

New recording stations have
been set up since the Loma Prieta
quake along more southern sec
tions of the San Andreas Fault.
Two stations, located three miles
apart across the fault, were set up
in Parkfield, where many experts
predict a large quake will strike in
the near future.
Stations have also been erect
ed at Table Mountain, in the San
Bernadino Mountains east of
Los Angeles, and at Pinyon Flat
in the desert south of Palm
Springs.
These instruments are search
ing for waves of a frequency
between 10 and 0.01 vibrations per
second (hertz). Fraser-Smith
describes this frequency range as a
"window" for looking down into
the earth from five to 20 miles,
depths at which many earthquakes
originate.
Current funding only allows
passive recording and observation,
and not the active modeling and
interpretation that Klemperer is
attempting.
