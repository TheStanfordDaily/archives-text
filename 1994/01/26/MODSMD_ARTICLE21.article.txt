# Tracking the path of students' blood from donor to recipient
## 
### Julie Sauer Staff writer 
Hundreds of Stanford students donate blood
each quarter, but few are aware of the complex pro
cess that takes place after the bloodmobile pulls
away.
From the moment a blood donor rolls up his
sleeves to the moment the blood is pumped into
another body, the blood undergoes several proce
dures at the Stanford Medical School Blood Center to
minimize risks associated with blood transfusion and
donation.

Although donors cannot contract infectious dis
eases such as AIDS and hepatitis while donating,
their blood can transmit illnesses to transfusion
patients. So, before donating, potential donors must
have their blood screened to ensure that they are
not in a high-risk group.
Testing for safety
Preliminary tests monitor a donor's blood pres
sure, pulse, temperature and iron content. The
hematocrit test for blood iron content places a blix>d
drop in a blue calcium sulfate solution. The rate at
which the drop falls determines whether the donor's
blood contains sufTicient iron.
Whole blood donation takes about 15-minutes and
vields one unit, or one pint, of blood. Bl<x)d is collect
ed in a small white rocker that weighs the blood and
mixes it with anti-coagulant.
Donors can give blood to the community blood
supply or designate it for themselves or a specific per
son. Regardless of the blood's final destination, all
units are subject to rigorous laboratory testing
beforehand.

Blood is typed
as A, B, O or AB
positive or nega
tive according to
Rh factor.
Donor and
patient blood
types must be
compatible.
Antibody tests
for syphilis,
leukemia, HIV
and four screen
ing tests for
hepatitis are
also conducted
to decrease the
chance of using

If the donor has given blood be-fore, his or her
previous donations are tr-aced to see if they
caused any problems in the recipients. Safety
measures also include searching for the do-nor's
name on a state list of infected donors.

Blood parts better than sum
After testing blood units, the Blood Center lab sep
arates each unit into component parts during a pro
cess called hemotherapy. Separating blood compo
nents increases the chances for a successful transfu-

sion because
the patient
receives only
the necessary
part of the for
eign blood tis
sue. It also
increases effi
ciency by shar
ing one pint of
blood with as
many as four
patients.
The separa
tion process
begins as a
centrifuge
spins blood at

different speeds to obtain three components: red
blood cells, plasma and platelets.
A soft spin of 2,800 revolutions per minute packs
red cells at the bottom of the bag, while the lighter
platelet-rich plasma rises to the surface. The plasma
is removed and spun at a 4,000 rpm hard spin to sep
arate out the platelets.
The red blood cells go to patients who have lost
blood during accidents or surgery. Plasma, the
watery component, provides clotting and immunity
agents, and fluid volume to burn victims and
patients of cardiovascular surgery or organ trans
plants.
Platelets initiate clotting and are used for
leukemia, bone marrow transplants and cancer
patients. All blood cells are produced in the bone
marrow, but platelets are especially susceptible to
the damaging effects of chemotherapy and
leukemia.
Apheresis is a special donating procedure that

harvests platelets. Carvn Huberman, apheresis
donor coordinator at the Blood Center, described
the donation process, which takes two hours. The
blood exits the arm and passes through a machine
that separates platelets. The remaining red and
white cells and plasma re-enter the body and
return to circulation.
Apheresis specialist Kristi Peterson explained
how platelets are labeled. The A, Band O markers
are found only on red blood cells. Platelets are typed
instead by protein antigen markers on the cell sur
face. There are four marker locations on white cells
and platelets.
Extracted platelets can be stored for five days,
while whole blood survives 35 days in a refrigera
tor. Blood from the Stanford Blood Center supplies
Stanford University Hospital and Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital. Some blood also goes
to the Palo Alto Medical Foundation.
