# Active ingredient THC induces the 'munchies'
## Marijuana disrupts neurons

/°J. After smoking pot, why do
YOU get the munchies?
— Samir Saxena
A : Me personally? Being an
xxinsect rather than a human
being, I'm afraid that isn't espe
cially relevant to most of the Stan
ford readership. As far as why
humans get the obsessive desire to
eat following ingestion/inhalation
of the Cannabis leaf, I regret to
inform you that the scientific jury
is still out.
But I can provide you with a
couple of interesting theories.
One of the consequences of
THC intoxication is synesthesia,
which essentially means that sen
sory stimuli will cause a stoned
individual to experience sensations
not only in a stimulated region —
be it the eyes or skin or what-have
you — but also elsewhere, in other
parts of the body or even in unre
lated sensory systems.
For example, being touched on
the hand when stoned can cause
one to feel a touch (or something
similar) on the leg. Hearing
throbbing music can send prickles
down your spine, or cause lights
to flash behind your eyes.
Some scientists have suggested
that the well-documented
'munchies' are simply an expres
sion of the human appreciation of
the synesthesia. Eating for its
own sake is a more or less sensu
ally pleasing experience when
sober; quite possibly, the sensory
crossover resulting from synes
thesia makes it even better. A

stoned individual eats every last
one of those honey-and-mustard
pretzels not because he or she is
hungry, but because it causes him
or her to experience unusual plea
surable sensations in other parts
of the body.
Another theory is more bio
chemical in nature. THC, the active
ingredient in marijuana, works by
binding to specific molecules (called
cannabinoid receptors) in the brain.
Neurons which have cannabinoid

receptors will become active when a
person ingests THC, and they will
send signals to other neurons, and
so forth.
Thus, by masquerading as a
neurotransmitter, THC can initi
ate cascades of neural activity in
the brain. This activity can mani
fest itself in one's consciousness
as simple visual hallucinations
(e.g., bright speckles just outside
the field of vision), as complete
thoughts (most of which, given
their origins, aren't worth
remembering in the morning) or
as biological urges.
Although hunger itself is a
fairly complex phenomenon, we
can say (simplistically) that you
know that you're hungry when
certain neurons, whose job it is
to keep themselves abreast of

your nutritional and energetic
state, find something lacking and
communicate to the centers of
higher cognition. Up and up the
ladder goes the message, until
(several levels of abstraction
later), some combination of neu
ral firings informs you that
you're hungry.
As we discussed earlier, THC
can stimulate cascades of neural
activity. Some researchers in the
field of psychopharmacology
have hypothesized that occa
sionally these cascades interact
at some point with the portion of
the neural network that regu
lates hunger. Since neurons
have very little idea where their
input is coming from, the
'hunger net' neurons can be
fooled into firing by receiving
signals not from the cells which
actually monitor energy status
but rather from neurons which
have been artificiallv activated
by THC.
As I've said before in this hum
ble space, the literature on the
effects of marijuana is in a sorry
state, so the best I can offer in
response to this thought-provok
ing question are these two some
what tenuous (though individual
ly quite tenable) theories.

Chris Patil would like to personal
ly thank Stewart Richardson for
his articulate defense of the facts
about marijuana in last Friday's
Daily. Drop your scientific ques
