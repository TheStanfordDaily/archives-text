# Human DNA traced to ancestors
## Researchers compare genes in humans, chimps

Though evolution is often
traced through archaeological
finds such as bones, rock carvings
and fossils, molecular biologists
at Stanford are tracking evolu
tion in a different way — on a
microscopic level.
Research being conducted
under the supervision of Luigi
Luca Cavalli-Sforza, professor
emeritus of genetics, traces the
changes that occur over time in
I)NA to determine the relation
ships between various peoples.
"The lab focuses on examining
human evolutionary history
using genetic markers," said
graduate student Joanna Moun
tain. Just as archaeologists
use fossils to piece together a pat
tern of evolution, these
researchers are comparing the
genes of different populations —
humans and chimpanzees, for
example — to find out when these
differences emerged.
Enormous amounts of data are
analyzed to calculate a gene cor
relation frequency, a percentage
of the genes which are the same
in different populations. Cou
pling this with knowledge of
genetic mutation rates allows
researchers to place the popula

tions on an evolutionary time
line.
This information is represent
ed in a genetic family tree, which
shows when certain populations
began to branch out from one
another.
In some cases, the information
provided by geneticists has
offered independent support of
archaeological data.
"Our research suggests an ear
lier arrival into Australia than
some archaeologists believe, "
Mountain said. Some archaeolo
gists say humans entered Aus
tralia 30,000 to 40,000 years ago,
while others maintain it was clos
er to 60,000 years ago. According
to Mountain, the research done at
Stanford tends to support the
estimate of 60,000 years.

are compared, patterns can be
seen among the DNA of individu
als within a particular popula
tion.
Out of the 3 billion base pairs
in the human genome, only cer
tain parts are singled out for com
parison.
DNA from mitochondria — the
organelles that produce energy
for a cell — is especially valuable
because it is inherited only
through the mother. Unlike DNA
in the cell's nucleus, there is no
recombination, or "crossing over"
of genes.
Tracing the history of a gene,
in this case, becomes easier
because there is no ambiguity
about where it originates. Mito
chondrial DNA also evolves rapid
ly enough to provide a useful rate
of mutation.
