## A 						little R & R Tennis looking for a grand slam

Three hundred and twenty
four wins, thirty-six losses. That's
women's tennis coach Frank
Brennan's 14-year record at Stan
ford.
By Saturday it will be 326-36.
To usher in the beginning of

the dual-meet sea
son, Hawaii and
Washington come
to Stanford Ten
nis Stadium this
Thursday and Fri
day, each match
starting at 1:30
p.m. And, barring
inclement weath-

er, both should return home with
losses to the second-ranked Cardi
nal.
"(Against Hawaii) we're not in
much danger of losing," Brennan
said. Washington, although
"much improved," according
Brennan, is yet unranked and also
should not present much of an
obstacle.
Stanford does not plan on
fielding its regular starting six
against these two squads, but will
mix up the lineup in order to play
some of its lesser-experienced
players.
Fart of this decision is based on
necessity — the Cardinal's top two
players can't play anyhow. Senior
Laxmi Poruri, the top-ranked
player in the country, is presently
away at a pro tournament and
may not be back until the week
end.
Sophomore Kim Shasby,
ranked sixth nationally in the pre
season, is still recovering from the
foot injury that kept her out of the
Pacific 10 Indoor Championships
last weekend.
But it would be a mistake to
assume that these opening meets
are being taken lightly by the
Stanford team.
"Our goal is to go undefeated in
the dual-meet season," Brennan
said. "That's extremely difficult to
do, because there are a lot of good

'[Against Hawaii]
we're not in much
danger of losing.'

teams, and we play them all."
Stanford will be dependent
upon some of its younger players
for these first two wins. Freshmen
Katie Schlukebir and Sandra De
Silva will both play singles while
Emily Burt will see some action in
doubles competition.
Stanford's top recruit, Schluke
bir was ranked 50th in the coun-

try in the presea
son which was
the second-high
est ranking for a
freshman, behind
47th-ranked Ale
jandra Vento of
Miami.
She had an
impressive fall

season, most recently reaching the
quarterfinals of the top flight in the
Pac-10 Indoors before losing to the
eventual winner, Jane Chi.
De Silva, though not as herald
ed, has also had an impressive
beginning at the Farm. She was
able to win the third flight of sin
gles in the Pac-10 Indoors handily,
with her toughest match being
against teammate Wendy Sacks in
the finals.
Burt starts her first Stanford
tennis season with much Cardinal
athletic success already under her
belt.
Stanford women's tennis' first
two-sport athlete, she started for
the women's soccer team, which
finished third in the nation earlier
this year.
"She'll probably play doubles
most of this year," Brennan said.
"She volleys really well and
knows the doubles game. Fur
thermore, the fact that she's
small is not as much of a detri
ment when there are two people
to cover the court."
Other Stanford players expect
ed to begin their dual meet season
on Thursday include 24th-ranked
senior Kristine Kurth, senior
Emma Woodhouse, who won the
second flight of singles competi
tion at the Pac-10 Indoors, and
sophomores Sacks and Beth
Berris.
