# Cardinal gym flips over Jennings
## Freshman gymnast receives praise for solid performances 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
Freshman Katie Jennings, regarded by
many as the Farm's top gymnastics recruit
last year, has no regrets about having chosen
Stanford over Florida, Arizona State, Utah,
Fenn State and Michigan — colleges that all
had teams which qualified for Nationals last
season.
"After I went on all the recruiting trips, I
realiz.ed that the athletes were isolated at
other schools," Jennings said. "Here, every
one is equal.
"1 also loved the Stanford campus and felt
really comfortable with the team. Everyone is
really nice and accepting."
Though the academics were a tough
adjustment from high school, Jennings is
finding life at Stanford to be easier than life
during her days of training and studying in
high school.
"Everyone here is such a hard worker — it
is inspiring, but not cutthroat," Jennings
said. "It is so nice to see everyone here have
as much, or more, to do than me."
An average day for Jennings after she
became an elite-level gymnast at the age of 13
consisted of about three hours of gymnastics
practice in the morning, school and then a
five-hour workout in the afternoon. Some
time after 8:30 p.m., Jennings would study
and sleep.
Jennings, who was her class valedictorian,
brought this learned discipline and skill at
managing time with her to Stanford, and is
successfully balancing 15 units this quarter
with gymnastics practice and competition.
"The time I spend in the gym is shorter
but more intense than what I was doing
before," Jennings said. "Gymnastics is still a
huge part of my life, but now it doesn't seem
to dominate as much."
Jennings became interested in gymnastics
at the age of five, when she was enrolled in a
summer recreation program in North Caroli
na. Later, she moved to Virginia, her current
home away from Stanford and joined a gym
nastics club. She was also playing soccer at the
time, but in sixth grade she decided to devote
her athletic ability solely to gymnastics.
During eighth grade, Jennings was having
a bad year and contemplated quitting, but
her coach talked her into waiting until
Nationals. Her fate was sealed when she
came in fourth and made the National Team.
After that, Jennings continued to be one of
the top 20 in the nation every year.
At the end of her sophomore year, Jen
nings suffered an overuse injury in her elbow,
which took about seven months to recuper
ate. By junior year, though, she was healed
and looking for a scholarship to college.
"When 1 was injured, I really doubted
sticking with gymnastics," Jennings said.
"But there were still so many goals I wanted

to accomplish.
"I am very happy gymnastics has gotten
me to the point where I am today. I love the
personal challenges and the experiences I've
gained from traveling and competing. I also
made so many close friends."
Though Jennings acknowledges thb sacri
fices she has made for gymnastics, such as
not being able to work on the yearbook in
high school or ski, she knows that it has all
been worth it.
Jennings quickly adjusted to the new men
tality necessary for college competition.
Where club gymnastics encourages individu
al successes, in college the sport is geared

completely toward the team.
"I want to do my best for the team. None
of us think about trying to get first place at
meets; it is beyond individual goals," Jen
nings said.
"It is a lot funnel* to compel, in, <sQl&ge,
and you always have someone rooting for
you."
Co-captain senior Mollie Brown thinks
Jennings definitely fit in with the team right
away. "I'm impressed with how well she' 3
adapted to college, she is very much a team
player. We can all really depend on her. She

also has a great sense of humor and
keeps us all laughing."
Jennings' main goal for the sea
son is to hit all of her routines con
sistently. She wants to perfect her
new vault — a front hand-spring —

and make national event finals on
bars, beam and floor.
"I just plan to keep improving,"
Jennings said. "I want to be a good
force on the team and be counted
on for all the events."
Cardinal assistant coach Lisa
Mitzel-Izzi is confident that Jen
nings, whose work ethic she
described as excellent and disci
plined, will be a big key for the team

going to Nationals.
"Katie is the kind of athlete that
always rises to the occasion,"
Mitzel-Izzi said. "Even if she didn't
have the best of workout weeks,
she'll compete excellently and be a
true fighter.
"As a freshman, she is a good
role model for being efficient, and
her performance pushes the other
girls to keep up with her."
