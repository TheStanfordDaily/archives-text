# Men's tennis to play Hawaii, San Diego
## Netters hope to beat the Toreros once they're over the U of H Rainbows 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
With great depth, a few nicks
and varied expectations, the Stan
ford men's tennis team officially
opens its dual-meet season this
week. Tomorrow, the Cardinal
will face the University of Hawaii,
and Saturday will witness a chal
lenging matchup with the Univer
sity of San Diego.
Stanford is coming off a more
than-respectable showing in Seat
tle last weekend at the Pac-10
Indoors, where the Cardinal took
two individual titles against top

caliber competition.
"We had a pretty good match
up there," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould. "Not a great
match, but a good match."
Stanford may not need much
more for their match against the
Rainbows. Last year, Stanford
played a solidly in Hawaii, coming
away with an easy win. Playing at
home this year, Stanford will be a
heavy favorite.
The No. 22-ranked University
of San Diego Toreros may pose
more of a problem. Playing with a
modified doubles format, Stanford
narrowly beat the Toreros 4-3 last

year, but San Diego went on to fin
ish the year with an excellent 16-4
record against top-flight competi
tion. Although San Diego lost last
year's No. 1 singles player to grad
uation, another talented player
returns in Sweden's Fredrik
Axsater, ranked 11th in the NCAA
collegiate preseason polls.
"San Diego always plays us
very close," Gould said. "They are
very well coached, and always get
the most out of their players."
It may be more difficult for
Stanford to get the most out of its
players as it battles the injury
bug.

"We have a lot of depth, but the
guys that remain are all banged
up," Gould said. "We have a lotta
nicks, but on the other hand, we
gotta have the match."
Those nicks include Jeff
Salzenstein's arm, Jim Thomas'
shoulder, Grant Elliott's elbow
and Robert Deven's leg. Although
all the injuries are all coming
along, some are still a ways from
ideal. Elliott's elbow problems
will keep him out of action, and
Thomas' rotator cuff will remain
the biggest question.
For both matches, the Cardinal
will also be without its No. 1 play
er, Michael Flanagan, who
received one of two wild-card bids
to compete in this weekend's
Volvo Tournament, which will
feature several professionals.
Brandon Coupe of San Jose State
received the other wild card.
Although the lineups for Stan
ford's matches will not be set
until the competition begins, the
six singles contests will be made
up of some combination of
Devens, Salzenstein, Thomas,
Chris Cocotos, Vimal Patel, Ricky
Becker and Billy Wright. To pro
tect against injuries and with the
season just beginning, coaches are
likely to try varied lineups.
Cocotos will team up with
Devens while Flanagan, his usual
partner, is out. Patel and Salzen
stein will make up another dou
bles tandem. Third doubles may
be played by Becker and Wright,
depending on the state of
Thomas' shoulder.
Dual meets this year will be
comprised of a new modified for
mat. Doubles will be played first,
with one point going to the team
which wins two of the three
matches. Singles follows, which
will be scored in the traditional
fashion.
Thursday's match against
Hawaii will begin at noon while
Saturday's match against San
Diego starts at 1:30. Both match
es will be featured on the Stan
ford Tennis Channel, found on
SUNet, Channel 11.
