# Synchro squad takes a trip to Davis Invite
## 
### Kyle Graham Editorial staff 
Many West Coasters would be
hard-pressed to distinguish Can
ton, Ohio, from Columbus, Ohio.
But the recent announcement that
this March's National Champi
onships will be held at the home of
the Pro Football Hall of Fame
rather than Columbus came as ter
rific news to the Stanford synchro
nized swimming squad.
In fact, the team, which will be
competing in the Davis Invitational
this weekend, views the change of
venue as a possible foreshadowing
of success at the upcoming champi
onships, as it allows them to escape
the dangers of arch-rival Ohio
State's "home pool" advantage.
Rapt attention is still being paid
to this Saturday's competition,
however. Even with the elimina
tion of the Buckeyes' home-pool
advantage, the Stanford synchro
squad acknowledges that a great
deal of hard work still separates
them from nationals.
"All coaches are looking at this
meet as a chance to see our swim
mers compete against each other,
to get a stake in the ground to mea
sure their performance later in the
season," said Cardinal assistant
coach Andy Maisel.
Northern California schools will
likely constitute the Cardinal's
competitors at the upcoming con
test, added Maisel, with California,
Sacramento State, the host Aggies
and Stanford all trying out routines
in the first intersquad meet of the
season.
Despite Stanford's nine-month
hiatus from similar competitions,
the squad will be forced to enduring
a grueling schedule in the upcom

ing two months. The team will
compete in meets on Feb. 12, 19
and 26, and then will host regionals
on March 6 at deGuerre before a
possible journey to Canton over
spring break.
At the Davis Invitational, 11
Stanford swimmers will compete in
varied events; the team will likely
emphasize the duet event, in which
four pairs of Stanford swimmers
will compete.
Debbie Downes and Georgia
Bauman will likely constitute one
of the four duet teams. Also on the
team are senior Kristna Evans,
sophomores Bridget Finn, Jodi
Michaels, Jenny Curtis, Julie
Davies and Jennifer Graves and
freshmen Amy Markezich, Eunice
Woods and Maia Young. Michaels
has a pinched nerve in her arm and
will be unable to compete in the
Davis tournament, though she
hopes to return later in the season.
Only having held an intrasquad
competition so far this season, the
team's goals for the Davis competi
tion are modest. "Our main goal in
the Invitational is to try out rou
tines," said Maisel.
Yet these routines will in large
part determine the squad's success
at the all-important regional and
national tournaments, and the
team is quite confident in the qual
ity of the routines themselves, even
if they have not yet been perfected.
Ixx)king toward both this week
end's meet and nationals, Michaels
said, "All the routines look really
good. Not ready for Nationals, but
very good. Not everyone swims (the
routines) all that well, hut the rou
tines themselves look great."
Even better, though, the team
won't have to compete in the chilly
Ohio State waters come March
