# EV residents to enumerate grievances
## 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
Apprehensive Escondido Village resi
dents will meet with administrators
tonight at the Escondido Village Center to
air their concerns regarding looming bud
get cuts and other assorted grievances.
"Budget cuts hit families especially
hard because they don't have other fi
nances to back them up," said Mary Lea
McAnally, a student at the Graduate
School of Business.
"It's not like they can get their parents
to cover the costs. They're maxed out on

loans," McAnally said.
Administrators themselves, though, are
not sure of what shape the budget cuts will
take for graduate students.
"The form is not clear to me," said
Assoc. Dean of Graduate Policy George
Dekker. "It seems unlikely that facilities
will be affected. . . . The cuts will probably
come out of staff."
Rodger Whitney, associate director of
Housing and Dining Services, also was un
aware of anything that would have great
impact on Escondido Village.
However, the graduate students say
thev also want answers on some long

standing complaints, including the pres
ence of toxic substances in the village, safe
ty from bike theft and apartment break
ins, and hazardous playground equipment.
"I'm not sure how much of the things
that go wrong are due to incompetence, or
[administration and staff) think this is the
way things should be," said Jim Hansen,
chairman of Rscondido's family council,
which organized the meeting.
Dekker said t hat while he is not in a role
to expedite the process, the bulk of the stu
dents' complaints already have money allo-
a ted for their reparations.
"My opinion about it . . . is
worthless," Dekker said. "Most of
it is going as fast as it can, but as for
my being able to solve the nitty
gritty problems, I'm not able to.
"Right now, I'm more con
cerned with getting more single
grad student housing," Dekker
said.
Some of the problems include
antiquated children's playground
equipment and the ineptitude of
gopher exterminators.
"Those playgrounds contravene
several federal safety regulations,"
McAnally said. "There's already
been a number of injuries â€” some
kids have lost teeth."
Hansen said that when he cor
nered a gopher exterminator last
month, the man said he was using
arsenic to kill the rodents. Hansen
later discovered that arsenic has
not been used for years, but said he
remains concerned at the expertise
of the staff.
"The fact is that they had people
applying poison who had no clue
what they were doing," Hansen
said.
According to Dekker, some of
the students' issues have been

around for years, but "ultimately
the system is only as good as the
people who run it.... Some are
obstructive."
But Dekker added that the sys
tem is much more efficient now
due to a more organized reporting
system.
The Escondido family council,
composed of elected graduate stu
dents and spouses of students, orig
inated last year as a branch of Uni
versity administrative offices to
give feedback on student needs and
voices. Gradually, though, students
within Escondido wanted to make
the group an autonomous voice of
activism for the community and
voted to make it independent.
"The administration cut us off,"
McAnally said. "They wanted us to
operate as a branch of the Univer
sity. ... There's no acrimony, but
we don't see eye to eye on the role
of the council.
"We don't want to preclude our
selves from acting as a tenants'
association, in case we had to orga
nize a rent strike [for example],"
McAnally added.
The meeting will begin at 7 p.m.
with an open forum to outline
issues. Administrators expected to
attend and make brief presenta
tions include Dekker, Whitney,
safety officer Janet Gleason, and
Chris Griffith, director of Escondi
do Village residence programs.
