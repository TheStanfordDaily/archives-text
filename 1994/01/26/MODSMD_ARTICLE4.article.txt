# Aid office offers financial help for L.A. quake victims

### Elise Wolfgram Editorial staff 
In an effort to ease the strain placed on families
who incurred losses in the recent Los Angeles earth
quake, the Financial Aids Office is encouraging af
fected students to discuss their financial situation
with the office.
According to Assistant Director of Financial Aids
Cynthia Rife, the office is willing to re-evaluate fi
nancial situations if a family incurs drastic losses.
Recognizing that a large number of Stanford stu
dents come from the Southern California region, the
office is now trying to inform students of their op
tions.
Officials estimate that the 6.6 quake caused more
than $7 billion of damage to Southern California.
Rife said she has received a few phone calls from
students so far. However, she said most students do
not yet have an exact figure on the damage to their
home or belongings, so they have not come to the of
fice.
"It's hard for people to make evaluations at this
point. Families might not know [the extent of the
damage!, but that shouldn't stop students from com
ing in," Rife said.
Rife added that the office has responded to natur
al disasters the same way in the past.
"We've done this before," Rife
said. "After Loma Prieta, we had
many students move off-campus
[in addition to students whose
parents incurred losses], and we
had to re-evaluate their financial
situations."
