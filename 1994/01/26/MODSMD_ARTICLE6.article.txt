## Author Stephen Carter selected by Casper 
### Elissa Lee Staff writer 
Yale law professor and Stanford
alumnus Stephen Carter, a controver
sial commentator on affirmative action,
has been selected as this year's Com
mencement speaker.
Carter was chosen by University
President Gerhard Casper from a
ranked list of 16 possible speakers sub
mitted by the senior class presidents.
The suggested list of speakers includ
ed South African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela, poet Maya An
gelou, television talk-show host David
Letterman, and authors Scott Turow
and Ken Kesey.
Carter is the author of "Reflections of
an Affirmative Action Baby" â€” an
analysis of the belief that African-Amer
icans must support affirmative action.
His book has sparked controversy and
often has been labeled conservative and
anti-affirmative action.
"To be black and an intellectual in
America is to live in a box, and on that
box is a label, not of my own choosing,"
states Carter in the first line of the book.
Carter's most recent book, about poli
tics and religion, is titled "The Culture
of Disbelief."
A member of the Stanford Class of' 76,
Carter earned his law degree at Yale Law
School. He returned to Yale as an assis
tant professor three years later, after

working as a law
clerk to Appeals
Court Judge
Spottswood Rob
inson and the late
Supreme Court
Justice Thurgood
Marshall.
Teaching clas
ses in constitu
tional law, con
tracts, and intel
lectual property,
Carter has been
a full professor

at Yale since 1991. Recognized as an ex
pert in those areas, he was also appoint
ed to the National Commission on Judi
cial Discipline and Removal by Presi
dent Bush.
"Carter is a gTeat person for the Com
mencement speaker. He is accomplished
and an excellent speaker," said Dana
Weeks, one of the senior class presi
dents. Weeks said she hopes Carter's
controversial views will spark discus
sion among students.
Casper has known Carter in a profes
sional role and tried to recruit Carter
when he was dean of the law school at
the University of Chicago.
"He's articulate," said Casper. "Since
I have seen him in action as a lively
mind, I was delighted."
