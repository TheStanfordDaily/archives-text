# Yale law prof to be graduation speaker
## Author Stephen Carter selected by Casper 
### Elissa Lee Staff writer 
Yale law professor and Stanford
alumnus Stephen Carter, a controver
sial commentator on affirmative action,
has been selected as this year's Com
mencement speaker.
Carter was chosen by University
President Gerhard Casper from a
ranked list of 16 possible speakers sub
mitted by the senior class presidents.
The suggested list of speakers includ
ed South African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela, poet Maya An
gelou, television talk-show host David
Letterman, and authors Scott Turow
and Ken Kesey.
Carter is the author of "Reflections of
an Affirmative Action Baby" — an
analysis of the belief that African-Amer
icans must support affirmative action.
His book has sparked controversy and
often has been labeled conservative and
anti-affirmative action.
"To be black and an intellectual in
America is to live in a box, and on that
box is a label, not of my own choosing,"
states Carter in the first line of the book.
Carter's most recent book, about poli
tics and religion, is titled "The Culture
of Disbelief."
A member of the Stanford Class of' 76,
Carter earned his law degree at Yale Law
School. He returned to Yale as an assis
tant professor three years later, after

working as a law
clerk to Appeals
Court Judge
Spottswood Rob
inson and the late
Supreme Court
Justice Thurgood
Marshall.
Teaching clas
ses in constitu
tional law, con
tracts, and intel
lectual property,
Carter has been
a full professor

at Yale since 1991. Recognized as an ex
pert in those areas, he was also appoint
ed to the National Commission on Judi
cial Discipline and Removal by Presi
dent Bush.
"Carter is a gTeat person for the Com
mencement speaker. He is accomplished
and an excellent speaker," said Dana
Weeks, one of the senior class presi
dents. Weeks said she hopes Carter's
controversial views will spark discus
sion among students.
Casper has known Carter in a profes
sional role and tried to recruit Carter
when he was dean of the law school at
the University of Chicago.
"He's articulate," said Casper. "Since
I have seen him in action as a lively
mind, I was delighted."

Although Carter is not very
well-known among Stanford's stu
dent body, Jean Fetter, assistant to
the president, said she "hopes that
students will be delighted to hear
from a distinguished Stanford
alumnus."
But with many students desir
ing a household-name speaker, the

choice may add to the increasing
student frustration over the selec
tion of commencement speakers.
Weeks and her fellow senior
class presidents — David Ray
mond, Sarah Rafanelli, and Peter
Liang — consulted with students
informally and ranked their choic
es before submitting the list of
finalists to Casper.
With reservations about
whether the first choice, Mandela,
could be secured, Casper said he
"took the next name off the list."
According to Weeks, finding
prospective speakers was difficult

because of Casper's desire to have a
speaker with Stanford connections.
"There was no agenda behind
this. ..Casper said. "I feel about
this somewhat strongly — the
Commencement speaker should
have some Stanford connection."
He said he considered not only
student response to the speaker
but also reactions from parents
and families.
"I think parents would like to
have known that their children
have gone to a (academic) institu
tion," said Casper. "The most
important audience, I think, are

the families."
Another factor considered by
the senior class presidents and
Casper was the importance of hav
ing an academic speaker. Accord
ing to Casper, ultimately it is a
"commencement of an academic
institution."
Commencement is scheduled to
be held June 12.
In the past, Commencement
speakers have included U.S. Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, Kirk Varnedoe,
a modern art expert, and Centenni
al Professor John Gardner of the
Haas Public Service Center.
