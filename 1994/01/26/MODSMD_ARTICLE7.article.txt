About 40 students, administrators
and staff discussed how the impending
budget cuts may affect female students
yesterday at an open forum sponsored by
the Women's Center.
In an informal meeting that failed to
reveal any specifics in terms of areas
likely to be cut, Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds, Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson and a number of
other administrators who oversee stu
dent services talked about campus pro
grams for women and listened to student
concerns.
Jackson said the goal of the budget
cutting process is to "see that the things
most crucial to students remain " The
Women's Center "will still be a good pro
gram," he said, mainly because previous
budget cuts prevented giving any sub

stantial amount of money to the center.
"Virtually nothing could be cut be
cause nothing has been given," said
graduate student Rebecca Bliss, the co
ordinator of the Women's Center. She
added that the Women's Center gets
much of its funding from ASSU special
fees.
"It was great to get a group of admin
istrators together so they could hear our
concerns, and we could get direct feed
back from them," Bliss said.
"Our goal in having this today is to
give students the opportunity to say
what programs are most valuable to
them," added senior Esther Conrad, the
chair of the Women's Center Advisory
Board.
Saying that meetings such as yester
day's forum help administrators hear
student opinions, Edmonds emphasized
