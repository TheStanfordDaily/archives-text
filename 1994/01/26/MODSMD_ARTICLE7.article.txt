# Leaders explore future for women's programs

### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
About 40 students, administrators
and staff discussed how the impending
budget cuts may affect female students
yesterday at an open forum sponsored by
the Women's Center.
In an informal meeting that failed to
reveal any specifics in terms of areas
likely to be cut, Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds, Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson and a number of
other administrators who oversee stu
dent services talked about campus pro
grams for women and listened to student
concerns.
Jackson said the goal of the budget
cutting process is to "see that the things
most crucial to students remain " The
Women's Center "will still be a good pro
gram," he said, mainly because previous
budget cuts prevented giving any sub

stantial amount of money to the center.
"Virtually nothing could be cut be
cause nothing has been given," said
graduate student Rebecca Bliss, the co
ordinator of the Women's Center. She
added that the Women's Center gets
much of its funding from ASSU special
fees.
"It was great to get a group of admin
istrators together so they could hear our
concerns, and we could get direct feed
back from them," Bliss said.
"Our goal in having this today is to
give students the opportunity to say
what programs are most valuable to
them," added senior Esther Conrad, the
chair of the Women's Center Advisory
Board.
Saying that meetings such as yester
day's forum help administrators hear
student opinions, Edmonds emphasized
that the budget-cutting process
has "had a lot of student
input. ... No one was shy on
input."
The forum began with a pre
sentation of the Women's Needs
Assessment Report, which was
ordered in 1989 by the Office of
Student Affairs and completed in
1992.
Diana Akiyama, acting dean of
Memorial Church and chair of the
committee that oversaw the
report, said that it was issued to
determine the quality of life and
the concerns of female students,
as well as what kinds of services
they require. The report's find
ings indicated the presence of
peer harassment in the residences
and an unsatisfactory classroom
climate for female students.
"None of the recommenda
tions have been implemented yet,
and we haven't seen any indica
tion that they would be," Bliss
said. But no definite answer
was given when Bliss asked
whether the report would contin
ue to be ignored.
The remainder of the meeting
was dominated by various admin

istrators discussing their offices
and how still-unspecified budget
cuts might affect the services they
provide.
For instance, Co well Student
Health Center Director Ira Fried
man talked about how the center
caters to the needs of female stu
dents. Saying he wanted to "reas
sure people that in terms of the
budget we will try to preserve the
core" of women's care, Friedman
emphasized that Cowell recog
nizes women's health care as a
key issue to primary care.
Ann Porteus, the acting direc
tor of Residential Education,
speculated as to how women
might be affected by further cuts
in dormitory programming. Dorm
programming is where a lot of
women get their information, and
cuts in that area would hurt the
residential educational experi
ence for females, she said.
Andree Sursock, the associate
director of the Undergraduate
Advising Center, discussed the
Women in Science and Engineer
ing Network, which pairs female
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents together in a mentoring
program.
Depending on the level of cuts,
the program "might be affected,"
she said. She added that she was
"optimistic" that the center

would find a way to continue the
program in a less costly manner if
necessary.
Following the administrators'
comments, the forum was opened
to questions and comments.
Graduate student Renee
Romano expressed concern about
the largely ignored needs of grad
uate school women and wondered
if there was any way to improve
services for female students in
spite of the budget cuts.
"Graduate women make up
only 30 percent of graduate stu
dents, yet they're believed to drop
out without their degrees in dis
proportionate numbers to that
percentage," Bliss said. A survey
by Cowell last spring found grad
uate women to be "the most
stressed, unhappy and under
served students on campus," she
added.
Senior Arbora Johnson, who
is a freshman academic adviser,
voiced her misgivings about the
classroom climate. She said the
lack of female teaching assis
tants often causes female stu
dents to find themselves in
uncomfortable situations with
out knowing how to respond. "It
seems to me that so many people
don't feel comfortable," she said.
"They don't know where to go
(for help]."
