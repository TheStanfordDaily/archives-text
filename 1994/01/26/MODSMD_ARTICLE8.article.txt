# An apple a day...
## Newton designers explain hardware 
### Charles Katz Staff writer 
Someone shook the tree a little and a Newton fell
onto Apple's head.
Three of the people who helped shake the tree to
create Apple's newest hardware package — the New
ton — discussed their project last night at Branner
and described what it is like to try to create some
thing new.
The Newton representatives are among the small
group of people responsible for designing the ma
chine. "Now, everything has a microprocessor, from
your radio to your phone; our job was to make it
smart," said Michael Tchao, the manager of product
planning and strategy for The Newton Group and a
member of Stanford's Class of '85.
The Newton was designed as a helper for the per
son on the go. "We tried to look at what it means to
have an assistant," said Andy Stadler, an Apple soft
ware engineer.
The purpose of the Newton is to "automate some
of the things that people always do," Tchao said to the
group of about 30 students at the program sponsored
by Branner Presents.
The Newton — a hand-held, computer-like instru
ment with a 3 inch by 5 inch screen — has many dif
ferent capabilities, Tchao said.
While there are many computerized personal as
sistants, the Newton is unique in that it can recog-
nize handwriting and convert it to
computer fonts. It also can store
names and phone numbers that
are easily accessible.
For instance, as the representa
tives demonstrated, if the user
writes "call Tony" on the screen,
the Newton will look up Tony's
number and display it. It can also
dial the number for the user if the

unit is attached to a phone line.
The Newton is also able to send
faxes and has an attachment to
receive written pager information.
"The Newton is an intelligent
pad of paper that can be used to
communicate in many different
mediums," Tchao said.
In addition to discussing the
project, the team talked about
what it was like to work for Apple
and create an original project.
"I never thought I'd work as
hard as I did [in college) after col
lege, but it was 10 times worse

than senior year," Stadler said.
The Newton project has been
around for six or seven years, but
the version that is out on the mar
ket only began to take shape four
years ago.
Steve Capps, who identified
himself as the "Newton nerd,"
said he started a "renegade, sub
versive" Newton team after he
became frustrated with how the
original project was progressing.
Capps said the original project
was not practical and would have
cost too much. He, along with

Tchao, began developing their
own version which eventually got
into the retail computer market.
The microprocessor, which sells
for about $700, is only in its infan
cy. The group explained that new
and better applications for the
Newton are being found each day.
Unlike other Apple projects,
like the Macintosh, the Newton
has been licensed to other compa
nies. A number of companies,
including Sharp, Motorola and
Siemens, are competing to make a
better Newton.
