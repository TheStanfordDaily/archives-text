Three of the people who helped shake the tree to

ton — discussed their project last night at Branner
and described what it is like to try to create some
thing new.
The Newton representatives are among the small
group of people responsible for designing the ma
chine. "Now, everything has a microprocessor, from
your radio to your phone; our job was to make it
smart," said Michael Tchao, the manager of product
planning and strategy for The Newton Group and a
member of Stanford's Class of '85.

group of about 30 students at the program sponsored

The Newton — a hand-held, computer-like instru

ferent capabilities, Tchao said.
While there are many computerized personal as
sistants, the Newton is unique in that it can recog-
