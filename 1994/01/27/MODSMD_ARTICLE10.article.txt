U.S. to defend S. Korea

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Pen
tagon is planning to send Patriot air
defense missiles to South Korea as "sen
sible, rational defense preparations" for
a potential North Korean Scud rocket
assault, a senior official said yesterday.
The move seemed likely to raise the
level of tension on the Korean penin
sula, where a million-man North Kore
an army stands just across the border
from a South Korean force bolstered
by 36,000 U.S. Army and Air Force
troops.
Tensions have been inflamed in
recent months by a standoff between
Washington and Pyongyang over
international inspections of the com
munist nation's nuclear program,
which the United States says is covert
ly pursuing nuclear bombs. North

Korea denies its nuclear facilities have
any military purpose.
Prince Charles shaken up
SYDNEY, Australia (AP) â€”
Britain's Prince Charles, eager to boost
his image after the breakup of his mar
riage to Princess Diana, has proved one
thing: he can stay cool under fire.
The 45-year-old heir to the throne
hardly flinched yesterday when a
young man ran out of a crowd, lunged
at him and fired two blank shots from
a starter's pistol during an outdoor cer
emony marking Australia's national
day.
Within minutes of his assailant's
arrest, Charles, unharmed, carried on
with his speech. He joked with the
crowd, and later assured guests at a
cocktail party that he was fine.
