# White House relents on health plan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The White
House offered concessions on the
scope of its health plan yesterday just
hours after President Clinton drew a
no-exceptions line on universal cover
age.
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole
pronounced the Clinton health plan
"in trouble," but Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., asserted that
Americans won't stand for a Republi
can filibuster.
The president's surrogates wasted
no time making conciliatory sounds
on the morning after the president
delivered a blunt threat to veto any
health reform plan that did not
include coverage for every American.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen
told business groups that Clinton was
willing to let more big companies self
insure rather than being forced into
the regional alliances where most
Americans would have to buy their

insurance.
White House press secretary Dee
Dee Myers also said that while Clinton
stands firm on universal coverage, the
timetable for achieving it is "some
thing that has to be worked out."
House Speaker Thomas Foley,
emerging from the White House strat
egy session, said, "It's possible you
will have some kind of a phase-in."
"His program is in trouble," Dole
said on NBC-TV. Repeating his argu
ment that the current system works
well for 85 percent of Americans, Dole
told Fox-TV, "We don't need a triple
bypass to take care of the health care
delivery system or this massive over
dose of government that President
Clinton proposes."
Bentsen acknowledged that big
business has problems with Clinton's
proposal to force all companies with
up to 5,000 employees into regional
insurance-purchasing alliances.

"You think the 5,000-employee
threshold ... is too high," he told the
National Association of Manufactur
ers and a pension group. "We hear
you. We're willing to discuss this one
and the other details of our plan."
"We got the concept right, but the
president couldn't have been more
clear when he said we're open for dis
cussion on this as well as other
issues," said Bentsen.
But Bentsen said he was troubled
by suggestions that only companies
with 100 or fewer workers should be
in the pools. That would be too small
to spread the risks around, he argued.
Clinton's case has been weakened
by months of Republican criticism and
insurers' attacks on his complex plan,
as well as misgivings voiced by some
Democrats. Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, the Finance Committee
chairman, recently said there was no
health care crisis.
