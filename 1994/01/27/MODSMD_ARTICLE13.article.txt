WHAT IS Housing and Din
ing Services trying to hide?
Maybe nothing — but the
world may never know.
The Daily's formal request for a
Housing and Dining Services budget
was denied by Keith Guy, director of
Housing and Dining Services, who
said in a memo that "it is not our
policy to release the details of any of
our budgets for public perusal."
After this memo was received,
persistent telephone calls by The
Daily to ask questions about the
budget were ignored.
Almost every student who pur
chases a Housing and Dining Ser
vices board plan wonders why they
pay between $13-$ 15 per day for
meals when they could dine out for
at least two meals per day for the
same price. The minimum quarterly
cost — spring quarter's "lite a la
carte" option for Manzanita Park,
Ricker and Stern — is $965.
When students realize that row
houses' and eating clubs' meal plans
cost significantly less, they become

even more confused and suspicious.
At ATO, a self-op, a board plan costs
$745 this quarter. Roth, another
self-op, is charging $720 this quar
ter. These houses also have the priv
ilege of open kitchens, and generally
more palatable selections.
Housing and Dining Services'
high board rates and refusal to show
outsiders their budget show an obvi
ous unwillingness to level with its
customers. Just because it has a
monopoly on student board plans
does not mean it can maintain a
covert, questionable operation and
not expect reproach.
Students have a right to know
what their money pays for, especial
ly when they are forced to buy a plan
as dorm residents. What are Hous
ing and Dining Services' expenses,
budget constraints and price deter
minants? Any why won't its employ
ees reveal that information?
Housing and Dining Services
ought to re-think the shady message
a private budget sends — a message
that does not sit well with students.
