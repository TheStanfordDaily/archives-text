# A 						sagacious group

SILENT outrage is rarely effec
tive in bringing about real
change. Sometimes a little
action is necessary. The founding
members of Students Against Geno
cide (SAGE) felt this way when they
formed the group, which aims to
raise awareness about and eventual
ly help end the fighting in Bosnia.
And though some may disagree
with their political stance, the
group's approach to student
activism is one to be commended.
Too often, students read the
papers, shake their heads about
what's going on in the world, and
then go on to class.
SAGE founders, however, felt
that this was not enough. The group
began as a network of a few con
cerned Stanford students who
wanted to do something about the
escalating violence in Bosnia. And
now, with up to 50 participants at its
meetings and a new office in Wash-

ington, D.C., the group is truly mak
ing its presence felt both here at
Stanford and throughout the
nation.
The group also plans to organize
dorm outreach programs, a candle
light vigil, and other campus events
to answer questions and increase
awareness about the atrocities in
Bosnia. And despite the thousands
of miles between Stanford and
Bosnia, the group's commitment
has not wavered.
Their attitude alone is enough to
convince other students to make a
similar effort on other issues. And
their rewards — such as their grow
ing national popularity, among
other things — prove that student
activism is far from dead. It's just
something that needs to be resur
rected from time to time — with a
little dedication and a conviction
that some things really do make a
difference.
