## Stop lying to grad students 
### 
A HIGHER PERCENTAGE of Stan
ford graduate students live under
the poverty line than residents of
East Palo Alto. This disgraceful census
statistic is a result of the "gap" — the dif
ference between the cost of living for a
Stanford student and the financial sup
port which the University gives to stu
dents.
I do not believe that Stanford is neces
sarily responsible for making sure that
students are able to live adequately. I do
believe that Stanford is responsible for
telling students the truth about the life
they are entering. Stanford should come
clean about the "gap."
In order to understand the source of
the gap, I did a little research. This col
umn is an effort to educate students
about the intricacies of the doctoral sup
port system, an expose of the systematic
lies told by the University, and a propos
al for change. With the support of stu
dents and faculty, we can make the Uni
versity more honest.
The doctoral support system is an
intricate house of cards. In large mea
sure, doctoral students at Stanford are
financially supported by their depart
ment. This support takes two forms: fel
lowships and assistantships. Fellowships
are outright gifts. Assistantships, the
way most doctoral students are support
ed, are jobs. In exchange for teaching or
research, a student receives a bi-weekly
paycheck (the stipend) and as a benefit,

tuition remission. The issue of tuition
remission is a complicated one, and
deserves a column of its own. Here, I will
focus on the stipend.
Stanford sets a minimum level for the
stipend — sort of a university minimum
wage. The minimum stipend wage is
$3,214 per quarter for 20 hours of work
per week. Certainly some departments
pay more than this rate, but many stu
dents have this amount as their sole
income.
This figure is not random. Careful cal
culations lead Stanford to claim that this
is a realistic estimate of the cost of living.
Unbelievably, the University unblush
ingly claims that a person can live here
for $1,000 a month.
This annual computation appears
each spring in a document called the
Average Graduate Student Expenses
Budget.
The University uses this budget for
two incompatible purposes, which cre
ates the "gap." First, it is used to deter
mine eligibility for Work Study and fed
eral loan funds. Second, it is "a guide to
the amount of money needed from all
sources for a period of study."
Federal guidelines mandate the Uni
versity to compute the"cost of atten
dance." This is a far cry from computing
the actual cost of living. By claiming that
the federally restricted computation
ALSO represents the living expenses of
the average student, Stanford leads stu

dents and faculty to believe that the
stipend is adequate to live on. This is a
lie.
Certainly, there are students who find
very cheap shared housing, and are thus
able to live within the income they earn
from an assistantship. However, this is
not true for most students. Most stu
dents who are paid at the minimum
stipend level find that there is a large gap
between the money they are paid and
their expenses.
The calculated Expenses Budget
includes four categories: Books/Supplies
($325), Living (rent, food & personal
expenses, $2,173), Local Transportation
($0) and Medical Insurance ($176). This
Budget is not a realistic portrait of stu
dent living expenses because:
1. Minimum stipend levels are pegged
to the calculated expenses of a single stu
dent living on-campus without a car. This
in no way represents the average doctor
al student.
Only 40 percent of graduate students
are accommodated in campus housing.
Since priority is given to first-year stu
dents, there is a heavy skew toward mas
ters students in campus housing. Most
single doctoral students are unable to


maintain a campus residence for
the six years it takes to earn a
degree. Most graduate students
own a car.
2. Many expenses are omitted
from the Expense Budget. Most sig
nificant of these is taxes. Federal
and state taxes are withheld from
the stipend check, so that the take
home pay of students is less than
the Expense Budget declares is the
"money needed" to live. ASSU fees
and the $115 Document Fee for
new students are also omitted.
3. Other figures are underesti
mated. Two examples are trans

portation and health.
Regardless of whether they live
on or off campus, most graduate
students own a car. Shopping and
commuting by car is simply the
most efficient strategy. The federal
restrictions include only the cost of
gas in the transportation computa
tion for ofT-campus students. Obvi
ously the real cost to students
includes insurance, car payments,
registration, gas, maintenance and
parking fees.
The cost of health insurance is
included in the budget, but other
health costs which students regu
larly incur are missing: an annual
$200 deductible; 20 percent co-pay
ments for physicians, prescriptions
and CAPS; birth-control devices;
dental and eve care; and medical

expenses for children.
For these three reasons, there is
a "gap" of several thousand dollars
per year between what students are
paid and what it costs them to live.
For some students circum
stances make the "gap" even larger.
There may be no summer funding
available to them. In the School of
Education they are asked to pay
$4,000 in first-year tuition. Outside
the sciences and engineering there
is little funding beyond the fourth
year. The cost of travel to profes
sional conferences is not paid in all
departments. The expenses associ
ated with research (travel for data
collection, interview transcription)
are often borne by the student.
How do students meet this
"gap"? Some rely on support from

their parents or spouses, others
work additional jobs while in
school, others take time off to earn
money, and others rely on loans
and credit-card debt.
Stanford needs to be honest with
incoming students about the exis
tence of the "gap." There is prece
dence for such honesty. In the mid
'7os, upon the recommendation of
the Committee on Graduate Stud
ies, some Stanford department
chairs sent discouragingly candid
letters to students admitted to doc
toral programs. These letters said
that job prospects in their field were
very weak, and students should be
wary of pursuing a degree if they
are doing it with the goal of getting
a job.
The newly published Graduate

Student Handbook makes a first
step in the direction of truth
telling, by saying that "the gradu
ate expense estimate is helpful as
an indicator of minimum annual
expenses. However, it is a common
experience for actual expense to
exceed this figure by several thou
sand dollars." Unfortunately, the
handbook is given to students after
they arrive. Newly admitted stu
dents only receive the misleading
Graduate Expenses Budget.
Stanford must stop lying.
Departments must:
• Tell newly admitted students
that their expenses are likely to
exceed the estimate.
• Provide them with the tools to
make their own computation (as
the Graduate Student Handbook

outlines).
• Tell newly admitted students
how students in their department
meet the gap. What is the average
time to degree and loan load upon
graduation?
If students were told the truth,
most would still attend Stanford.
Attrition would decline. Students
would be happier. And Stanford's
competitors would be forced to
come clean as well.
Stanford's administrators are
not taking these steps on their own.
Faculty and students must apply
pressure so that future generations
of students are told the truth. Hon
esty really is the best policy.

Chris cannot tell a lie. She loves
her editors.
