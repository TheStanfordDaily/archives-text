## Stop lying to grad students 
### 
A HIGHER PERCENTAGE of Stan
ford graduate students live under
the poverty line than residents of
East Palo Alto. This disgraceful census
statistic is a result of the "gap" — the dif
ference between the cost of living for a
Stanford student and the financial sup
port which the University gives to stu
dents.
I do not believe that Stanford is neces
sarily responsible for making sure that
students are able to live adequately. I do
believe that Stanford is responsible for
telling students the truth about the life
they are entering. Stanford should come
clean about the "gap."
In order to understand the source of
the gap, I did a little research. This col
umn is an effort to educate students
about the intricacies of the doctoral sup
port system, an expose of the systematic
lies told by the University, and a propos
al for change. With the support of stu
dents and faculty, we can make the Uni
versity more honest.
The doctoral support system is an
intricate house of cards. In large mea
sure, doctoral students at Stanford are
financially supported by their depart
ment. This support takes two forms: fel
lowships and assistantships. Fellowships
are outright gifts. Assistantships, the
way most doctoral students are support
ed, are jobs. In exchange for teaching or
research, a student receives a bi-weekly
paycheck (the stipend) and as a benefit,

tuition remission. The issue of tuition
remission is a complicated one, and
deserves a column of its own. Here, I will
focus on the stipend.
Stanford sets a minimum level for the
stipend — sort of a university minimum
wage. The minimum stipend wage is
$3,214 per quarter for 20 hours of work
per week. Certainly some departments
pay more than this rate, but many stu
dents have this amount as their sole
income.
This figure is not random. Careful cal
culations lead Stanford to claim that this
is a realistic estimate of the cost of living.
Unbelievably, the University unblush
ingly claims that a person can live here
for $1,000 a month.
This annual computation appears
each spring in a document called the
Average Graduate Student Expenses
Budget.
The University uses this budget for
two incompatible purposes, which cre
ates the "gap." First, it is used to deter
mine eligibility for Work Study and fed
eral loan funds. Second, it is "a guide to
the amount of money needed from all
sources for a period of study."
Federal guidelines mandate the Uni
versity to compute the"cost of atten
dance." This is a far cry from computing
the actual cost of living. By claiming that
the federally restricted computation
ALSO represents the living expenses of
the average student, Stanford leads stu

dents and faculty to believe that the
stipend is adequate to live on. This is a
lie.
Certainly, there are students who find
very cheap shared housing, and are thus
able to live within the income they earn
from an assistantship. However, this is
not true for most students. Most stu
dents who are paid at the minimum
stipend level find that there is a large gap
between the money they are paid and
their expenses.
The calculated Expenses Budget
includes four categories: Books/Supplies
($325), Living (rent, food & personal
expenses, $2,173), Local Transportation
($0) and Medical Insurance ($176). This
Budget is not a realistic portrait of stu
dent living expenses because:
1. Minimum stipend levels are pegged
to the calculated expenses of a single stu
dent living on-campus without a car. This
in no way represents the average doctor
al student.
Only 40 percent of graduate students
are accommodated in campus housing.
Since priority is given to first-year stu
dents, there is a heavy skew toward mas
ters students in campus housing. Most
single doctoral students are unable to
