## Res Ed should not oversee campus-wide programming 
### 
I SHARE THE DAILY'S concern
about Residential Education's
placement under Housing and Din
ing Services, but after reading The
Daily's editorial on Jan. 25, I was
immediately struck by the combination
of smugness and ignorance that it
demonstrated.
The editorial makes two troubling
assertions. It states: "At present 'resi
dential education' is defined by the set
of programs presented in the dorms."
Maybe that is the way the editorial
board, or even most of campus, defines
it, but that is far from accurate. Pro
gramming is only a small part of a job
that also includes administrative
responsibilities and a good deal of
counseling. Programming is also not an
end in itself; it is simply the most obvi
ous way Residential Assistants work to
promote community, intellectualism,
and personal growth.
As far as I am concerned, RAs do too
much programming. The job of an RA
is to facilitate the development of a
self-governing, inclusive and support
ive community. They put on certain
programs to help students get to know
each other, spark discussion of tough
issues or help students academically.
The primary function of an RA with
regard to programming is to help resi
dents develop their own programs.
When RAs, rather than residents, take
this responsibility, we get the kind of
spoiled dependence on Res Ed as
provider of programming and intellec
tualism that we see in The Daily's edi

torial.
The sad truth, however, is that many
RAs buy into the attitude displayed by
the editorial — that RAs exist to be pro
gram providers. I have known many
who continually knock themselves out
to provide programming that most resi
dents don't attend. Sometimes pro
grams conflict with extra-curriculars,
jobs or schoolwork, but the typical stu
dent chooses either to make a run to
Late Night, watch "90210," or play
"Streetfighter II." The oft-heard excus
es of "too much work" and "problem
set due tomorrow" are sometimes true,
but we all know how often we say we're
going to go study, and then wind up
blowing off our time.
Some RAs, however, come to see
themselves as failures if their pro
grams are not well attended. They get
more and more desperate in trying to
get apathetic and unwilling students to
attend, resorting to bizarre publicity,
bribery with food, and most often,
guilt-trips. The publicity goes unno
ticed, the food is eaten by students who
show up just before it gets served, and
the guilt-trips foster resentment that
further reinforces resident negativity
toward dorm events.
The editorial also states that "This
system |Res Ed programming) has led
not only to a geographically fragment
ed University intellectual community,
but one which is stagnant, as well."
Even if one accepts the false notion
that "Res Ed" exists to provide pro
gramming, it still would not, and

should not, be responsible for provid
ing campus-wide programming. Resi
dence staff members serve their house
communities and do not have the time,
nor the money, to put together cam
pus-wide programs. That is the mission
of campus organizations, who have the
time, the resources, and the expertise
to sponsor major events.
Last year there were many well-pub
licized events sponsored by student
organizations, residence halls, and
many other organizations. The Speak
ers Bureau put together two debates —
one about political correctness and one
about the women's movement, and two
panel discussions— the first about the
economy and the second about U.S.
foreign policy. Haas Center for Public
Service sponsored the You Can Make a
Difference Conference and numerous
Stanford In Government forums. The
Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion sponsored the Powwow, the Law
School brought Justice Antonin Scalia,
Roble worked to bring Ice T, Branner
sponsored Author Terry McMillan, and
the list goes on.
The bottom line, however, is the
bottom line — most of these programs
take an awful lot of money. As anyone
who has worked on these programs can
tell you, this money is hard to get.
Every dorm gets hit up by numerous
organizations every week for dona
tions. The Speakers Bureau, to the
contrary of assumptions made by past
Daily editorials, bargains every speaker
below the honoraria they get paid by

other universities— this is required by
the Bureau's charter. Fee refunds fur
ther sap the ability of organizations to
sponsor all-campus events.
Finally, the suggestion that massage
workshops be replaced by visits from
Supreme Court Justices is ludicrous. It
takes enough effort just to get popular
campus personalities to come to the
dorm, let alone find the resources. And
all of this fails to recognize the commu
nity-building value of many non-intel
lectual programs.
Nor does it take an expert to spark
intellectual discussion. Their presenta
tion is not the intellectual event, it is
the discussion that follows. Intellectual
environments exist when residents feel
comfortable enough to share with each
other their views about religion, fami
ly, life, love, etc.
The burden for creating a more
intellectual atmosphere rests squarely
on the shoulders of every individual
member of the student body. All you
need to do is think critically about
yourself and the world around you.
Question your politics. Question your
tunnel-vision pre-professionalism.
Question your fear of self-discovery and
self-disclosure. When more than a few
people are doing this, they will begin to
share their thoughts with each other,
only then producing the intellectual
campus the editorial claims to want.
