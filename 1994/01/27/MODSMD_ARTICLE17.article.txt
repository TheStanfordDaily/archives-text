# Lack of responsiveness dissatisfying to alumni
## 
### 
Congratulations to N'Gai Croal for
articulating what I (and perhaps many
others) have felt since my first days here
â€” that this is not a university adminis
tration responsive to the needs of its

students or student families.
Hence it is not surprising that while
Stanford ranks right at the top in aca
demics in national polls, it is nowhere
near the top in rankings of alumni satis
faction.
