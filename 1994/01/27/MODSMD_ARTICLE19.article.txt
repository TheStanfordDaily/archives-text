## Touché: Tulum world-class Stanford coach creates new breed of Cardinal fencers

You think your Mondays are
bad?
Every Monday, Stanford

men's fencing coach Zoran
Tulum wakes up knowing he'll
be crushed by 12 tons of force

during the week,
"I give about 10 lessons a day,
and each student makes 300

lunges against me," he explained.
"I took one of those dynamome
ters to measure pressure, and
each hit is about two pounds. For
a four-day work week, I get hit
with about 12 tons of force
against my chest."
Luckily, he has a 10-pound
leather vest to protect him, or
else Stanford would lose one of
its most dedicated coaches.
Six years ago, Tulum was
hired along with women's coach
Sherry Posthumus.
"We started building this pro
gram from scratch," he said.
"Stanford was nowhere."
Together, they have trans
formed Stanford into a force to
be reckoned with, winning three
individual NCAA titles in that
time, and probably finishing in
the top 10 again this year.
Tulum first picked up a fenc
ing weapon in his native country,
the former Yugoslavia, when he
was 11 years old. The first day,
he did some footwork and ended
up with sore muscles. That really
hooked him, as he challenged
himself to find out what was so
demanding about the sport.
"I was a very good tennis play
er. Maybe that's my biggest mis
take — that I didn't stay in ten
nis," he joked.
But Tulum was no slouch in
fencing, either. He won the
junior national championships in
all three weapons (foil, epee and
saber) when he was 19. He went
on to become national champion
eight times and won several
European Cups. However, he
remembered receiving what
seemed like millions of second
places.

Coach Zoran Tulum, a former world-class fencer, is now coach
ing Stanford amateurs to International fame.
Even his coach used to tell him,
"Silver sucks."
After four years of arduous
training, sometimes logging eight
hours a day, he made the Yugosla
vian Olympic team in 1980. But
his medal hopes were crushed
when he was forced to stay home
because of the Moscow boycott.
Moving on, Tulum decided to
finish his degree in architecture
and industrial design at the Uni
versity of Belgrade and graduated
in 1981. He then worked for the
next six years as an architect. But
he felt cooped up working in the
office and one day decided he
needed a break.
He took a year off and moved
to Brazil, but while he was attend
ing the U.S. National Champi
onships in Cleveland, he was
offered a position as an assistant
coach at Harvard. He accepted,

and that season, Harvard won its
first NCAA fencing title in epee
and Tulum was hooked.
After a couple of successful
years, Tulum was offered the job
of men's coach at Stanford. He
came for his interview, not really
expecting to get the job, but just
to enjoy the four-day vacation
more than anything. He arrived
20 minutes late and forgot to take
off his sunglasses for another 20
minutes. He was very relaxed and
cracked jokes. Two weeks later, he
had the job.
A year later, he also became
part of the coaching staff for the
U.S. National Team. His many
duties keep him extremely busy;
he works 12 to 14 hours a day
coaching, fundraising and doing
paperwork. Without scholarships,
he has to build his team from
physical education classes, and in
fact, over half of his fencers are
from P.E. sessions.
"The great thing is when
you're at the NCAA Champi
onships and your student is

receiving the award for first place
and he's wearing a Stanford hat.
That's a great moment," Tulum
said.
But success isn't everything.
Tulum said that the time-con
suming process of bringing a P.E.
student up to the varsity level also
gave him great satisfaction. He
gave the example of Glen Wong,
who graduated last year.
"Glen worked hard from P.E.
and became an NCAA All-Ameri
can," he said. "I picked him up
when he was a sophomore in a
P.E. class. He became team cap
tain and graduated with the high
est GPA among lettered seniors.
"That kind of thing makes me
happy."
This season, Tulum has been
concentrating on developing his
foil and epee squads, since most
of his foil team is training in
Europe. Also, with the support of
the Department of Athletics, he is
overseeing the conversion of part
of Roble Gym into a state-of-the
art fencing center. This new

home for Stanford fencing
promises to be a powerful recruit
ing tool.
"Next season, we'll just crush
Cal in our new home to celebrate
the 100 th year of fencing at Stan
ford," he predicted.
Tulum will be watching the
Stanford men's and women's
teams as they fence today at the
University of Pennsylvania ver
sus Penn, Temple and Rutgers.
Then on Saturday, they'll travel
to Penn State and fence against
eight other schools, including
Penn State and Notre Dame.
Tulum is only taking his epee and
saber squads.
"This trip I see only as experi
ence," he said. "I expect good
results from the two squads, but
we won't get first place in the
combined results without a foil
team."
The women's team, according
to coach Posthumus, has a chance
of going undefeated on the trip.
Their major obstacle is last year's
NCAA champion, Penn State.
