## Touché: Tulum world-class Stanford coach creates new breed of Cardinal fencers 
### Roger Han Staff writer 
You think your Mondays are
bad?
Every Monday, Stanford

men's fencing coach Zoran
Tulum wakes up knowing he'll
be crushed by 12 tons of force

during the week,
"I give about 10 lessons a day,
and each student makes 300

lunges against me," he explained.
"I took one of those dynamome
ters to measure pressure, and
each hit is about two pounds. For
a four-day work week, I get hit
with about 12 tons of force
against my chest."
Luckily, he has a 10-pound
leather vest to protect him, or
else Stanford would lose one of
its most dedicated coaches.
Six years ago, Tulum was
hired along with women's coach
Sherry Posthumus.
"We started building this pro
gram from scratch," he said.
"Stanford was nowhere."
Together, they have trans
formed Stanford into a force to
be reckoned with, winning three
individual NCAA titles in that
time, and probably finishing in
the top 10 again this year.
Tulum first picked up a fenc
ing weapon in his native country,
the former Yugoslavia, when he
was 11 years old. The first day,
he did some footwork and ended
up with sore muscles. That really
hooked him, as he challenged
himself to find out what was so
demanding about the sport.
"I was a very good tennis play
er. Maybe that's my biggest mis
take — that I didn't stay in ten
nis," he joked.
But Tulum was no slouch in
fencing, either. He won the
junior national championships in
all three weapons (foil, epee and
saber) when he was 19. He went
on to become national champion
eight times and won several
European Cups. However, he
remembered receiving what
seemed like millions of second
places.
