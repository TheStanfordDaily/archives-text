# Upset EV residents meet administrators
## Housing, communication top student concerns 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Frustrated Escondido Village resi
dents took a first step last night toward
resolving ongoing communication prob
lems with University housing officials.
In a two-and-a-half hour meeting at
Escondido ('enter, administrators field
ed questions from about 50 students re
garding specific housing problems and
ways to educate residents about the net
work of officials available to solve their
problems.
"I personally attach a lot of importance
to graduate housing," said Assoc. Dean of
Graduate F > olicy George Dekker, one of a

host of University officials present at the
meeting.
"The things you're talking about do
need to be addressed," he said. "I think
we're going to be going through a contin
uous budget crunch, but there are ways
we can make housing affordable."
The meeting was planned by Escondi
do's family council, a group of residents
concerned about graduate housing, in an
effort to deliver residents' concerns on is
sues — ranging from new bike racks to
lead paint and asbestos in buildings —
more directly to administrators.
"I've lost two bikes that were locked
to buildings," said Mary Lea
McAnally, a student at the Grad
uate School of Business who lives
in Escondido.
"Putting an eyebolt in every
one's patio can't be too onerous,"
she said. "That's what the police
say to do. . . . We talked about this
last April."
Though many of the residents
said concerns they have already
voiced to the administration often
go unresolved, Assoc. Director of
Housing and Dining Services
Rodger Whitney promised to
work more closely with Escondido
residents.
Escondido "is one of the most
difficult places to communicate
with at Stanford," Whitney said.
"There are a lot of issues here,
but we need your help."
Dekker also called for the resi
dents to try harder to make their

concerns clear to administrators.
"I think that you need to come to
some agreement about what are
the top issues," he said, asking
them to submit a list to him.
Despite such assurances, the
residents cited their earlier diffi
culties with problem solving in
Escondido, pointing out that
administrators have not always
fulfilled their promises.
"The University treats us like
garbage," one resident shouted
out in the middle of the meeting.
"What you have to recognize is
that we are human beings."
But Whitney argued that resi
dents must be willing to work with
the administration in order to
meet their goals. "However we
work on this, I think it's important
we do it in a joint way," he said.
Dekker also encouraged resi
dents to write to his office with
problems and questions. "I can't
tell you what kinds of situations
will come up," he said. "I think we
all see ourselves as graduate stu
dent advocates, and we're doing

what we can."
In addition to discussing gen
eral ways to better communicate
with residents, the administra
tors answered specific questions
regarding improvements in facili
ties and services.
Many of the inquiries related
to the cost of living in Escondido
and how upcoming budget cuts
will alter where that money goes.
"Money we collect for housing
and dining does not go into gener
al funds," Whitney said. "But we
will have to cut operations . . .
because of our internal plan."
The cuts will be absorbed by
"working toward being more effi
cient," he said.
Residents were also dissatisfied
with the manner in which the
administration spreads its housing
funds among all residences, argu
ing that Escondido should benefit
from the rents collected there.
"It is correct that all rents are
pooled," Whitney said. "But EV is
not paid for, and we still have debt
service coming from your rent."

He also pointed to the ongoing
capital improvement program,
designed to augment the quality
of both graduate and undergradu
ate residences over a period of
time.
"Thirty million dollars of the
I program 1 is being directed
toward EV," Whitney said, adding
that "the feeling is that you could
ghettoize campus by allowing
rents to be based on housing qual
ity.
"We have to work toward an
equitable solution that applies to
all students," he said.
Whitney, along with Director
of Graduate Residences Chris
Griffith, also talked about
improvements currently in the
works.
"Funds have been committed
for the new playground," said
Griffith. "We're sdso looking into
whether or not we need to put in
recreational areas like barbecues.
"We're collecting information
to help us make decisions," she
said.

ing that Escondido should benefit
from the rents collected there.
"It is correct that all rents are
pooled," Whitney said. "But EV is
not paid for, and we still have debt
service coming from your rent."

He also pointed to the ongoing
capital improvement program,
designed to augment the quality
of both graduate and undergradu
ate residences over a period of
time.
"Thirty million dollars of the
I program 1 is being directed
toward EV," Whitney said, adding
that "the feeling is that you could
ghettoize campus by allowing
rents to be based on housing qual
ity.
"We have to work toward an
equitable solution that applies to
all students," he said.
Whitney, along with Director
of Graduate Residences Chris
Griffith, also talked about
improvements currently in the
works.
"Funds have been committed
for the new playground," said
Griffith. "We're sdso looking into
whether or not we need to put in
recreational areas like barbecues.
"We're collecting information
to help us make decisions," she
said.
