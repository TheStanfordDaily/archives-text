# Buffalo wings, a court-side seat — what more can you ask?
## 6th Man rallies Cardinal fans 
### 
The funniest thing I read in
Sports Illustrated last year was a
quote from Arizona head basket
ball coach Lute Olson saying that
Maples Pavilion was one of the
hardest gyms in the country to play
in.
Sure, I thought, if you're trying
to fight narcolepsy.
But lately, a change has come
over Maples. With the subtlety of a
Brent Williams slam, the student
section has been resurrected,
transforming the crowd from a
corpse to a bear with a bee up its
butt.
For the most part, this change is
due to the new "Cardinal Sixth
Man Club." And, despite some
problems, it's the best thing that
could have happened to Stanford
school spirit.
What is this club, you ask? Well,
obviously, you haven't been to a
men's hoops game this year. The
Sixth Man Club is that mass of red

in the center of the student section.
The ones who chanted "SAT"
when .Jason Kidd handled the ball
last week. The ones who give the

referees all they deserve when they
make the typically horrendous
calls that always seem to go against
the Cardinal. The ones who are the
evidence against the claim that
"Stanford school spirit" is an oxy
moron.
The cluh started as the brain
child of the Sports Marketing
Department after last season, a

year which saw a dismal team play
in front of a dismal number of fans
with a dismal amount of spirit.
"It was a club we thought of to
get back the enthusiasm the stu
dents used to have," said Jim
Brungard from Sports Marketing.
"We knew there were some diehard
fans; we just had to find them."
So Jim got together with Half
time Sports bar and ofTered the fol
lowing deal — for $10 you get a
"Cardinal Sixth Man Club" T
shirt, center seats at all Stanford
home games and free food and
drink before the game at Halftime.
What a deal! T-shirts them
selves run about $10, so after a
couple dozen buffalo wings, club
members are far into the black. All
that's really asked of them is that
they provide some type of focused
crowd support for the home team.
For the club's inaugural year,


Rob
Ross
only 250 slots were available. The
last 20 or so were sold right before
the Cal game, but there are hopes
to sell 500 next year.
The reaction, at least from the
team, has been extremely support
ive of this instituted cheering. I
called coach Montgomery, and as
soon as I got the words, "I've got
questions about the Sixth-Man
Club" out of my mouth, he was
effusive with his praise.
"It's great!" he said yesterday.
"It's gotten us terrific student
involvement at games."
Montgomery went on to
describe that the Department of
Athletics had been trying to find a
way to get students more involved
in games for a while. Last year they
made tickets free to all Stanford
students, but attendance, instead
of rising, fell along with the team's
fortunes.
This year has been completely
different. In the past Stanford has
been notorious for its poor fan sup
port. Many times the students
didn't get out at all, and when they
did the cheering was sporadic and
timid at best. But this year, atten

dance is up, and the fan support
has been boisterous, rowdy and
focused. As a college basketball
crowd should be.
It's hard to separate crowd sup
port from team success. Thus,
comparisons to last year's dismal
crowds are misplaced. But consider
two years ago, Adam Keefe's senior
season. Crowds were big, but were
still lacking that distinct flavor
found in Cameron Indoor Arena
and McKale Center. Fans cheered,
but in a polite and tame manner, as
if afraid to upset the visiting team.
I remember standing up at a game,
only to be screamed at to sit back
down. That's pathetic; if you're sit
ting in the student section, get up
off your butt and cheer. If not, go
sit with the alums.
Now, the Sixth Man Club has
provided that rowdiness that
makes the college basketball expe
rience unique and memorable.
They've given Dion Cross a place to
smile after hitting a key three, and
Monte Buckley an audience to ges
ticulate at afler bringing the house
down with a slam. They've provid
ed the strength in numbers needed
to get Stanford students' apathetic
bodies out of their seats and into
the game.
Todd Laßocca, the unofficial
captain of this club, said that mem

bers are worried about drawing
technical fouls with their behavior.
No one wants that, but damn,
when was the last time that was a
worry at a Stanford sporting
event?
Sure, there are some problems.
The club is now made up of about
10-15 members who have no Stan
ford affiliation (according to
Laßocca). That should change next
year; it is the student section, for
goodness sakes. And hey, it's too
bad that no matter how long you
wait outside to get in, the best seats
are reserved. Bummer. In fact, a
letter to the editor that ran yester
day called these reserved seats
"bullshit."
"I don't understand (the writ
er'sl complaint," Laßocca respond
ed. "She says she's in favor of the
new basketball spirit, yet she's
against its epitome."
I agree. Even with large atten
dance numbers, like we had two
years ago, crowd support was lame.
The "Cardinal Sixth Man Club"
has revitalized the entire game-day
atmosphere. If it requires some of
the student section seats to be
reserved in order to create the
excitement that we had against
Cal, so be it.
This isn't the opera, nor is it
fair. It's college hoops. Deal.
