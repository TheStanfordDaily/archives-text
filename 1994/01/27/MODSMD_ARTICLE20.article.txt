# Buffalo wings, a court-side seat — what more can you ask?
## 6th Man rallies Cardinal fans 
### 
The funniest thing I read in
Sports Illustrated last year was a
quote from Arizona head basket
ball coach Lute Olson saying that
Maples Pavilion was one of the
hardest gyms in the country to play
in.
Sure, I thought, if you're trying
to fight narcolepsy.
But lately, a change has come
over Maples. With the subtlety of a
Brent Williams slam, the student
section has been resurrected,
transforming the crowd from a
corpse to a bear with a bee up its
butt.
For the most part, this change is
due to the new "Cardinal Sixth
Man Club." And, despite some
problems, it's the best thing that
could have happened to Stanford
school spirit.
What is this club, you ask? Well,
obviously, you haven't been to a
men's hoops game this year. The
Sixth Man Club is that mass of red

in the center of the student section.
The ones who chanted "SAT"
when .Jason Kidd handled the ball
last week. The ones who give the

referees all they deserve when they
make the typically horrendous
calls that always seem to go against
the Cardinal. The ones who are the
evidence against the claim that
"Stanford school spirit" is an oxy
moron.
The cluh started as the brain
child of the Sports Marketing
Department after last season, a

year which saw a dismal team play
in front of a dismal number of fans
with a dismal amount of spirit.
"It was a club we thought of to
get back the enthusiasm the stu
dents used to have," said Jim
Brungard from Sports Marketing.
"We knew there were some diehard
fans; we just had to find them."
So Jim got together with Half
time Sports bar and ofTered the fol
lowing deal — for $10 you get a
"Cardinal Sixth Man Club" T
shirt, center seats at all Stanford
home games and free food and
drink before the game at Halftime.
What a deal! T-shirts them
selves run about $10, so after a
couple dozen buffalo wings, club
members are far into the black. All
that's really asked of them is that
they provide some type of focused
crowd support for the home team.
For the club's inaugural year,
