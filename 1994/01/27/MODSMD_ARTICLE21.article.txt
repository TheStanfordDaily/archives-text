# Bashing Bruins by the Bay
## No. 1 UCLA visits Farm, faces red-hot Cardinal 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
After putting together its best effort of the season
in an 88-79 win over No. 23 California, the Stanford
men's basketball team faces its third nationally
ranked opponent in four games tonight, taking on
top-ranked UCLA at Maples Pavilion.
That's right, top-ranked UCLA. This week, the
Bruins moved into the top slot in both major polls for
the first time since 1983 after former No. 1 Kansas
lost at home to unranked Kansas State.
"The fact that they're No. 1 makes it a little bit
more special," said forward Brent Williams. "But no
matter what they're ranked, UCLA is still going to be
UCLA."
The Bruins (13-0 overall, 6-0 in the Pacific 10
Conference) have won their last five games against
Stanford (10-4, 3-2), including a 72-64 decision last
year at Maples Pavilion.
UCLA is the only undefeated Division I program
in the country, and with good reason. The Bruins
don't beat teams, they decimate them — their aver
age margin of victory is 20 points. All five UCLA
starters average double figures in scoring, led by
junior Ed O'Bannon's 18.9 points-per-game mark.
O'Bannon, a 6-foot-8, 215-pound forward,
anchors a quartet of frontcourt players that outre
bounds opponents by an average of 10 per game. An
All-Pac-10 selection last season, O'Bannon is on the
preliminary list of candidates for the John Wooden
award, college basketball's equivalent of the Heis
man Trophy.
"O'Bannon is a mobile power forward," said Car
dinal forward Andy Poppink. "He's got size, but he
can also take it outside."
At UCLA, the forward position is a family matter
— highly-touted freshman Charles O'Bannon fol
lowed his brother to Westwood last fall. Charles, a 6-
foot-6, 210-pounder, has wasted no time floundering
in the shadow of his older sibling, leading the team in
blocked shots while averaging over 12 points a game.
It is in the middle, however, where the Bruin big
men are downright big. The Z Boys, George Zidek
and Rodney Zimmerman, share time at center. Zidek
and Zimmerman, who weigh in at slightly under 500
pounds combined, eat up an average of 12 boards a
contest.
It doesn't get any prettier up top, where Shon
Tarver and Tyus I£<}ney combine to hit nearly 30
points a game on their own. Edney took Pac-10 Play
er of the Week honors after bucketing a career-high
26 points in a crucial win over No. 13 Arizona last
week.

David Harbour pushes a shot past a Golden Bear
defender. The Cardinal will need an equally
impressive performance from the post position in
order tc dethrone No. 1 UCLA today.
"They've got players who can
score at every position," Williams
said.
So what factors play into the
Cardinal's hands entering
tonight's game? For one, there's
something to be said for momen
tum. While UCIJ\ looked a bit slop
py in its last win, a 98-81 home vic
tory over Arizona State, Stanford
put it all together in defeating Cal
88-79 last weekend, with Poppink
and Williams playing their best
games of the season.
And then there's history. In 1988,
the Cardinal last hosted a top
ranked opponent, a 20-1 Arizona
squad. Before a sellout crowd at
Maples, Stanford shocked the Wild
cats 82-74.
Can history repeat itself?
"[UCLA's) No. 1 ranking is more
exciting than anything," Poppink
said. "It's not a chance you get all of
the time. It's definitely a motivation
al thing."
