# Grapplers travel to Fresno

### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
The Cardinal wrestlers will
compete in their final away meets
of the season as they travel to
Fresno State and Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo this weekend. An
added bonus to the trip will be
provided by Wyoming, who will
also compete at Fresno State.
The Cardinal's dual record,
now 2-3, was blemished this past
weekend when it lost to Cal

State-Bakersfield, 24-9. Head
coach Chris Horpel hopes to see
that record improve via victories
this weekend.
However, a win will not be easy
against No. 7 Fresno State. The
Bulldogs are led by two-time All-
American Jerry Abas, who will
wrestle at either 142 pounds or
150. Last year Abas took second
place in NCAA competition. Car
dinal sophomore Jimmy Aguirre
(142) or senior Lance Johnson
(150) will go up against Abas.

Horpel noted that although
Aguirre and Johnson would be
underdogs against Abas, both are
capable of pulling an upset. Co
captain Johnson sports an
impressive 5-0 record in dual
meet competition.
Fresno is also carried by
Dewayne and Nick Zinkin, two
brothers in an apparently long
family line of wrestling tradition.
Dewayne, who won the presti
gious Las Vegas Invitational in
December at the 134 division, was
ranked fifth in the nation earlier
this season. Stanford's Matt Cano
(126) and Jay Jackson (134) will
have their chances at an upset
against the Zinkins.
Cal Poly will also be a challenge,
although Horpel has greater opti
mism of winning against the Mus
tangs. Leading Cal Poly is Jake
Gaeir, who is ranked second in the
nation at 150 pounds.
Horpel said Cal Poly has a

slight edge in its match with the
Cardinal because of the way their
wrestlers match up against Stan
ford's competitors.
"The problem is that their best
wrestler is better than our best
wrestler," Horpel said.
The Cardinal has not wrestled
Wyoming before, although the
Cowboys are ranked in the top-30.
The remaining Cardinal com
petitors are Ramy Saad (118); Tod
Surmon (158), currently unde
feated in dual-meet competition;
Scott Chapman (158), who is
recovering from a sprained ankle;
Jason Gladden (177); Bryan Vani
man (190) and Scott Whitt in the
heavyweight division.
