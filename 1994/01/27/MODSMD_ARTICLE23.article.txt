						stroke of genius
## No. 1 swimmers at it again 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
Championship teams all have certain
things in common.
The Bulls. The Blue Jays. The Cowboys.
And the Stanford Cardinal men's swim
team.
These teams all know that the postseason
is the season â€” completely separate from
regular-season league play.
But all of these championship squads
know they have to work hard during the
year, making subtle changes, improving per
formances and chemistry at every chance
they get.
This weekend, the Cardinal men will
swim a home-and-away dual meet series,
hosting Loyola Marvmount at deGuerre Pool
on Friday, then traveling south to UC-Santa
Barbara on Saturday. Meet times are 1 p.rn
on Friday and 3 p.m. on Saturday.
AAer extending their perfect dual-meet
record to 6-0 with lopsided victories over Ari
zona and Anzona State last weekend, Stan

ford is in good position to finish the year
unbeaten. Last year, coach Skip Kennev's
squad posted a record of 8-0 on their way to
a second consecutive NCAA championship
While both Loyola Marvmount and UCSB
figure to be over-powered bv the talent-laden
Cardinal, many Stanford swimmers are look
ing forward to the opportunity to race and
make necessary adjustments to their swims.
Sophomore freestyler Joe Hudepohl takes
such a mentality into meets which figure to
see the score get out of hand in a hurry.
"Anytime you get a chance to race, it's good
for you," he said. "It's a chance to work on
the little things in your swims. Against a big
team like Michigan, you forget about some
important things like turns and starts. In
meets like these, you can think, 'What am I
doing right?' and 'What am I doing wrong?'
We can also really help each other."
Hudepohl also stressed the importance of
keeping focused both individually and as a
team heading into this weekend's meets.
