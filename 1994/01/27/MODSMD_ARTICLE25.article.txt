# Swimmers to shake up L.A.
## 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
Sorry, Los Angeles. Alter suf
fering through the devastating
effects of a major earthquake, you
may be in store for one of the
worst aftershocks in geologic his
tory.
Wreaking havoc and destroying
all in its path, the Stanford
women's swimming squad is pre
dicted to hit the area hard this
weekend.
The Cardinal, who have been
the world's worst natural disaster
in the eyes of their opponents, take
a 40-straight dual meet winning
streak to USC and UCLA this
weekend.
Don't look now, but this could
be the BIG one.
For the Trojans and the Bruins,
any hopes for a victory are on
shaky ground. Both teams have
not lost a meet all year, but it
doesn't take a seismologist to know
that both undefeated records could
tumble under the pressure of Stan
ford, which has measured near
11.0 on the Richter Scale in pools
across the country.
"USC could be the most

improved team at the [Pacific 10
Conference] championships,"
coach Richard Quick said of the
Cardinal's opponents on Friday.
"They have one of the best swim
mers in the world right now in
Kristine Quance."
But don't let a 6-0 (2-0 in the
Pac-10) record fool you. The Tro
jans should not give Stanford
many problems on a team-wide
scale. Quance has the nation's best
times in the 100 breaststroke (1
minute, 1.76 seconds), 200 breast
stroke (2:12.21) and 400 Individual
Medley (4:12.89). Several other
individual matchups may be com
petitive, and on the whole the Tro
jans will give the Cardinal more
competition to help better Stan
ford's times.
"There is a lot of positive com
petition within our team," said
junior Becky Crowe. "These are
some of my best friends, and there
is no negative competition. It's all
positively channeled."
On Saturday the Cardinal will
trek to the other side of Los Ange
les, meeting the Bruins in a swim
ming pool that was originally
thought to have earthquake dam
age last week. "There was some

concern at UCLA labout the
earthquake]", Quick said. "I don't
know what the status of the pool
is, but we're going down there to
swim no matter what."
UCLA is currently ranked
sixth in the country with a 6-0
record in dual meet competition,
2-0 in the Pac-10. Stanford,
ranked first in the nation, is 12-0
against the Bruins. UCLA is 17-2
in its last 19 dual meets, but both
losses have come at the hands of
the Cardinal.
"UCLA is probably the second
best team in the Pac-10 right now,"
Quick said. "We're going to have to
be very ready twice this weekend,
against both of these teams."
Already qualified for the NCAA
tournament from Stanford are
Jenny Thompson, Lea Loveless,
and Crowe. The team hopes to con
tinue to add to that list this week
end.
"I would anticipate that, if it is a
nice day with nice weather, we will
have more qualifiers," Quick said.
"A lot of [swimmers] want to
[qualify] in the next four weeks,"
Crowe said. "These next three
meets will be the most competitive
for us."
