# Survey: Stanford ranks second in patent money
## 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
A survey released last week revealed
that Stanford earned more than $25 mil
lion for licensing inventions during the
1992 fiscal year. And, according to the li
censing office, the University topped that
during the 1993 fiscal year by garnering
$31.2 million in royalties.
The 1992 survey by the Association of
University Technology Managers
ranked Stanford second out of 98 partic
ipating universities, behind the Univer
sity of California school system, in the
amount of royalties earned through

patents.
Katharine Ku, director of the Office of
Technology Licensing, said she is unsure
how the 1993 figure compares to other
universities' 1993 earnings.
"We're definitely continuing to grow
income-wise," said Sally Hines, the of
fice's manager of human resources.
However, much of the royalty money
Stanford receives comes from two
patents which will both expire within a
few years.
Hines said the increase in 1993 royal
ties was due to more income from one of
these patents — a patent related
to DNA — which brought in $20
million last year. Stanford shares
with the UCs the U.S. and
Japanese patent for technology
related to DNA, which Ku called
"the basic patent that underlies
the biotechnology industry."
By the time of their expiration,
the DNA patents will have grossed
about $170 million, making them
the most lucrative patents in Stan
ford history. According to Genetics
Prof. Leonard Herzenberg, the
financial loss incurred when the
patent expires will be "important
but not crucial."
The other major Stanford

patent — for technology to synthe
size music — has yielded the Uni
versity about $4 million annually
over the last 17 years, Ku said.
The University will lose consid
erable money when these two
patents expire. The patents have
comprised up to 68 percent of the
licensing office's revenue over the
years. The music patent expires in
April, while the DNA patent will
expire in December 1997. Ku said
she did not know exactly how
much will be lost.
Ku, who is a past president of
the national technology associa
tion, said she is not worried about
this impending loss.
"I think that university licens
ing will continue to play an impor
tant part for researchers, the Uni
versity and the nation," she said.
The effect of the royalty loss is

also minimized by the fact that the
revenue is not budgeted by the
departments, which instead keep
the money in a discretionary fund
for one-time costs.
The royalties are paid to several
University areas as well as the
inventor, Hines said. First, the
Office of Technology Licensing
takes 15 percent for administra
tive fees to cover its operating bud
get. Direct expenses such as legal
fees and distribution costs are then
deducted. The inventor, depart
ment and school split the remain
ing portion — which is approxi
mately 80 percent of the total roy
alties received.
Music Prof. John Chowning,
who invented the FM synthesizer,
said that his department has been
planning for the revenue loss and,
with help from the School of

Humanities and Science, has built
an endowment to let the depart
ment "continue to do the things
that we do."
However, he said, "The idea of
patent and licensing is not the
driving force (behind music-relat
ed inventions) because there are a
lot of ideas that never take shape
as far as the music industry goes."
According to the survey results,
Stanford issued 44 patents and had
165 licenses that generated royal
ties in the 1992 fiscal year. Ku said
that these numbers are "about the
same" as in previous years.
All together, the surveyed uni
versities took in more than $172
million from licensing their inven
tions during the 1992 fiscal year.
This showed a rise of 30 percent in
the universities' income from com
mercial licensing.
