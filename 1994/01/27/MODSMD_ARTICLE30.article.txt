# No frills, just

### Michael G. Nichols 
K, imagine you're in a
112 M band. You're all sitting
around waiting for an
interview in some small club's
grungy backstage room. And
then you realize there's a prob
lem: you don't have a name.
Think quick. The bands who in
fluenced your music are the
Kinks, the Buzzcocks, the Pixies,
the Beatles They're names
are short, your songs are short,
so why not call yourselves some
thing straight and to the point?
How about Flop?
While most bands might re
ject such a name, fearing an
omen of failure, Flop embraced
the idea in their ever-casual style
and went on from there. Having
joined together from local Seat
tle bands, Flop started playing
their own breed of pop a few
years ago, releasing their first EP
in the summer of 1990.
Since then Rusty Willoughby,
Paul Schurr, Nate Johnson and
Bill Cambell have hit the club
scene hard in a town where the

competition is rough and the cafe, double-late
espresso, mocha decaf is strong. Despite the
odds, however, Flop has carved its own niche.
After countless local gigs, a featured track on a
compilation, another 7-inch, two imports and
an LP, the band landed a deal with Epic to pro
duce its latest album "Whenever You're
Ready."
7 his hard hitting, aggressive rock-pop
album is not your typical Seattle
freshly-pressed-flannel-wearing
got-a-goatee-don't-1-look-hip-1-am-going-
through-a-trauma-'cuz-I-think-1-am-Nir-
vana release. Quite the contrary, in the music
of this-get-up-and-shake-your-butt quartet,
grunge lurks only in the shadows, not in the
spotlight. Although they have been compared
to everyone from David Bowie to Cheap Trick,
they are not easily classifiable. They are part
late '60s / early '70s fun-rock reworked into a
heavy rhythm guitar soundgarden. And al
though perhaps too stylistically repetitive, they
are definitely hip.
But do they fit the part?
Not in the least. Flop has the look of a group
of guys who would say, "Hip? Who, us?" Yes,
it's definitely accidental cool in the case of Flop
and "Whenever You're Ready." Wflloughby,
the band's lead vocalist and almost exclusive
songwriter, says their listening habits are di
verse. From "Elvis the king, [to] a lot of old
jazz, [to] Elvis Costello. Anything really — but
it's got to be bad."
Not only does the band avoid listening to
and imitating the "next big thing," they aren't
even sure what they themselves sound like.
"We really have the least perspective on
that," continues the singer, "because we don't
listen to our own albums... someone outside
could better answer that question than us."

And answer it the critics have. One going so
far as to call their songs "Buzzcocks meets
Ziggy Stardust meets the Turtles ... guaran
teed to make your nipples hard." More tem
perately, they are the first band since the
Sidewinders to capture the English Power Pop
spirit — that post-Sex Pistols pop infused with
energy and violence. "Basically it's a loud line
up," explains Willoughby. "One with a
stripped-down drum set, some guitars and
amps and that's it," adds bassist Schurr.
ut for all of their simple, no-frills at •
titude they aren't your average no
nonsense band. For Flop nonsense is
an important part of life. Their lyrics, for in
stance, aren't laden with meaning or a mes
sage. When asked where they come from,
Willoughby said he wasn't sure. "Out of a hat 1
guess. They don't really have any specific
meaning or message ... every song is differ
ent, there's no increase or decrease in continu
ity from one to another— they're just songs."
Mightn't there be a message in this lack ofa
message, though? In a strange way, yes.
Willoughby, also the band's spokesman, be
lieves "it's fine for music to have a message —
ours just doesn't." But this is something Flop
may have gotten flack about, since the other
relatively quiet band members put in their two
cents. Guitarist Campbell actually believes
that "you can't convey a message through
rock, and anyone who chooses to try to in this
medium is going to fail."
A message for Flop would have to be some
thing of substance, something hard to fit into
one of their 18 short songs on "Whenever
You're Ready." Schurr finds music with a mes
sage something that has fallen prey to "politi
cal shortcuts" and doesn't have a real heart to
it. Besides, why make up a message for your

band if you don't have one? In a day of lyrics
crammed with soap-water social critiques,
Flop believes in sincerity. "I think it makes
sense for some bands to have a cause. Take the
Clash, for instance. 1 mean, if we had grown up
poor like them in a terrible low-class neigh
borhood, maybe it would make sense," justi
fies Willoughby.
112 Flop did have a message, what would it
* i be? Take shorter showers? Save a tree?
# No. "Maybe how slow people drive in
Ballard," Schurr thinks out loud. "Or what
about: hey kids, stay in school, don't be cool
and don't join a rock band," offers Willoughby.
Yes, Flop will continue to say what's on its
mind, and play it, too. Not only does a song
not need to say anything, it doesn't need to say
much. With many tracks barely at the three
minute mark, Flop believes short and sweet is
the best plan of action. When asked why their
songs are so brief, Schurr responds "1 think the
more appropriate question is why are so many
songs so long?"
Willoughby agrees. "The dance and
rhythm oriented nature of songs today makes
them artificially long ... songs are based
around clubs instead of themselves. Basically
some songs are beat-oriented, and we're just
beat-ofT oriented." Besides, short has its ad
vantages. "If the songs are short we can wrap
things up earlier and then go hangout with the
chicks." Willoughby muses.
In a more serious vein, Campbell points
out that "so many songs have the mandatory
four-bar intro and then the theme riff and the
mandatory gratuitous guitar solo. How much
music is in that?"
While many of Flop's songs do sound musi
cally similar, they never fall into the style formu
la of radio ripe rock. They often start out with an

intro that sets up a mood for the
song rather than its melody. They
also jump right into the music. Ag
gressive pop like Flop can't afford to
think too much before it acts or
even before it ends. "Why drag a
song out?" asks Schurr. "Once
you've done the chorus a couple of
times why not just wrap it up? Peo
ple have short attention spans and
who wants to hear a verse and cho
rus more than twice?"
lop also believes that
spending a lot of time in
the studio is no good.
"Whenever You're Ready," for in
stance, was recorded in two weeks
and mixed in the same amount of
time. This helps keep up the
album's energetic feel, since band
members are still into the groove
of each song. "We started record
ing quickly early on because we
had to pay for it," explains
Willoughby, "and now 1 guess we
just don't know how to do it any
other way."
But the short studio sessions

also help to keep the album close to the stage.
Although not all of the songs were composed
with the idea of performance, a vast majority
move easily from the sound you get at home to
the sound you get on the stage. "Live music is
for the fun of it," Willoughby believes. The in
your-face feel of Flop is unquestionably born
from their attempt to "record our music as a
live and spontaneous sound," adds Schurr.
"Besides, we might start to get bored — any
more time (recording] might mess it up."
So far, not messing things up has been pret
ty easy for Flop. After two years together as a
band, they recorded some covers to serve as a
demo for record companies. Frontier records
liked the work so much they decided to release
it. And so, "Flop & The Fall of the Mopsqueez
er" the album and band were born. Unsure of
what was to follow the band got together and
recorded "Whenever You're Ready," only to
sign a contract with Epic shortly after. On top
of all that, Flop was listed by Spin magazine
among the "Best Unheard Bands of 1992."
Some might say that Flop has lead a
charmed life and that they're headed for even
greater success. According to Willoughby,
however, they "never really strived for it."
Campbell and Schurr don't even consider
Flop charmed, only "fortunate" or "lucky."
But whatever name you give it, the path that
Flop has taken isn't too bad.
The lamp in the hotel room starts to flicker
and goes out. Schurr applauds vigorously, and
nothing happens. He looks at it in disap
pointment. "It's not even a 'Clapper.' "
There are many things this band has to
learn about the world of musical fame, but
there are a few things the music world can
learn from them: there's still a place for rock
dance music, there's still a place for pop. And
that place now belongs to Flop. ■
