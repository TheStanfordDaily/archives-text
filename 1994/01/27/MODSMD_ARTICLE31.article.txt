# Sadding the Chorale
## The 						Stanford Chamber Chorale's 'Broadway Cafe' 
### Kimberly Chrisman 
It all started with a pun
The country-western connotations of the
phrase "Stanford Chorale" were too rich to
pass up. So the 27-member Stanford Cham
ber Chorale's fourth annual "Broadway Cafe"
production, "Gunfight at the Stanford
Chorale," became a rip-roaring romp set in
Brigadoon, Wyoming.
"Broadway Cafe," a musical revue featuring
sweets and show tunes, was originally con
ceived as a fund-raiser for the Chorale's loftier
pursuits — performing and recording cham
ber music. The first show was written without
a theme; a murder plot was added at the last
minute, and a tradition was born. Since then,
the Chorale has lampooned "Star Trek," soap
operas and, now, the Wild West.
This year's theme gives Chorale members
an excuse to shed their tuxedos and evening
gowns for boots, bandannas and Stetsons. It
also means plenty of gun jokes, twangy accents
and corny lines like, "You're prettier than a
field of corn in May."
"We wanted it to have a more definite set
ting," said producer Ross King, a graduate stu
dent and three-year Chorale veteran. "Last
year it was a soap opera, and there wasn't any
thing to separate it from real life."
If this year's "Broadway Cafe" has a more
precise setting than usual, its plot is as random
as ever — a real-life horse opera with a touch
of "The Twilight Zone" and a Bobbitt joke or
two thrown in for good measure.
Freshman Akiko Fujimoto, clad in cow
girl garb from Goodwill, attempted to ex
plain: "It's about a bunch of Stanford stu
dents who take a trip to a Western town, and
there's this evil dentist.... Um, it has a
happy ending."
"There's always a line towards the end
where one of the characters has to explain the
plot for the audience," said Thayer Coburn, a
senior making his third "Broadway Cafe" ap
pearance. This year's show is no exception.
1 don't sleep much'
Depending on who you talk to, "Broadway
Cafe" is either the "most creative" or "most
unusual" thing Chorale does. Or both.
Written and produced entirely by the per
formers themselves, "Gunfight at the Stanford
Chorale" showcases the group's unique skills
— musical and otherwise.

"The show was largely created around the
talents of the performers," said graduate stu
dent Michelle Geoffrion-Vinci. Thus, its char
acters include a tap-dancing bus driver, trom
bone-playing prostitutes and a singing cow
boy named Joe Montana.
"It's a very versatile group of people," Geof

frion-Vinci said.
And a very busy one. In addition to being
full-time students and grad students, many
Chorale members moonlight in a cappella
groups and Ram's Head Theatrical Society.
Chorale rehearsed "Gunfight at the Stanford
Chorale" in only three weeks, simultaneously

prepping for an upcoming classical concert
with the University Singers on Feb. 23.
"1 don't sleep much," admitted Youngmoo
Kim, a graduate student in electrical engineer
ing. King said this year's "Broadway Cafe" was
the toughest yet to mount, due to a smaller,
less experienced group with fewer graduate
students in music.
Chorale members have compensated by
playing multiple roles and sharing costuming
and choreography duties — "whatever you
have time for," said senior Erin Browne.
"It's easy to put together, especially with all
this talent," said Coburn. "We can ad lib if nec
essary."
'Let your bra straps down'
But "Broadway Cafe" 's silly costumes and
high-kicking dance sequences are just a back
drop for the music of Broadway, delivered in
Chorale members' classically-trained voices.
The singers pick their songs before the show is
written; then they are more or less seamlessly
worked into the script.
"Gunfight at the Stanford Chorale" in
cludes songs from such Broadway classics as
"Little Shop of Horrors," "Guys and Dolls,"
"Crazy for You" and, of course, "Brigadoon"
and "Oklahoma!" It also features little-known
numbers from little-known musicals like "As
sassins" and "Closer Than Ever."
Although the show is a group effort, the
Chorale is "not an ensemble so much as a
bunch of individuals," said Coburn. "The
songs and duets are what make 'Broadway
Cafe' happen "
Still, it's a far cry from the masses and can
tatas that make up Chorale's standard fare.
"It's difficult to move from a classical reper
tory to something like this, but it's also a lot of
fun," said junior Matthew Francis. "It's time to
just let your bra straps down and have fun."
But Chorale's not about to give up Bach for
Broadway.
"This is fun," Fujimoto said. "But classical
music is the real challenge." ■
