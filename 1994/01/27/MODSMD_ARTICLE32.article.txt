# Avoiding dramatic impasse — Ram's Head follies
## Story by Sarah Katz and Ed Yoon 
### 
In 1911, when tuition was still free, a
group of Stanford men planned a satiri
cal variety show to be performed before
the annual violence-prone Stanford-Califor
nia football game. They faced grim re
sources: there was no music department, no
drama department and the men's gymnasi
um was the only theatrical venue. But Stan
ford's appetite for student-run drama was
voracious, and the number of aspiring ac
tors, dancers, singers and writers could sus
tain several of the grandest stage produc
tions.
Adopting their name from a long-since
lost wall decoration, Ram's Head Theatrical
Society remains the largest and oldest stu
dent organization for drama on campus,
producing Big Game Gaieties, Spontaneous
Generation performances, Winter One Acts
and the jewel in their crown, the infamous
spring show. Now armed with venues such as
Memorial Auditorium, tutorials with drama
department mavens, a budget in the tens of
thousands of dollars and money stashed in
the bank, Ram's Head has weathered its share
of misadventures and flops.
Many say that the past few years have been
especially hard. A lack of artistic vision, tan
gled communications with the Drama De
partment, raging tempers, rumors and back
stabbing have plagued Ram's Head, and have
caused some to question whether Ram's
Head can continue to create high-caliber the
ater in an atmosphere of lean financial sup
port and small audiences.
A Close Bunch
Those familiar with the hours, frustration
and ennui associated with a major stage pro
duction know that working behind the
scenes breeds an inevitable familiarity.
"I've never worked so hard in my life and
been so happy with what I was doing," says
junior Alison Duxbury, who's been working
with Ram's Head since her freshman year and
is now a member of the Ram's Head board of
directors. Describing her stint as run crew
chief for "Cabaret," the spring show two years
ago, she says,"I would be yelling cues at night
in my sleep. 1 was constantly thinking about
it. My roommate thought I had gone nuts."
The hours spent working in close confines
with the same people, day after day, natural
ly lead to a close camaraderie among Ram's
Head members. But many of the organiza
tion's members say lately this closeness has
become more detrimental than beneficial.
The "techies" — those involved with tech
nical production such as lighting, stage man
agement and set crew — are one example of
how close people in Ram's Head can become.
Although the group represents a small frac
tion of the organization's 400-member ros
ter, their skilled labor and willingness to sac
rifice hours of their life make the "techies" in
dispensable to the organization's survival,
says Duxbury. Adds Dave Andre, a member
of last year's board of directors: "Ram's Head
has been described as a tight core of techies

surrounded by actors."
The closeknit nature of the troupe's core is
evidenced by rituals such as "Brenting" — a
rite named after previous Ram's Head mem
ber Brent Chism that involves meeting at the
Coffee House Wednesday nights — and a
code of "techie rules" that "cannot be di
vulged," says Melissa Wilson, the current ex
ecutive producer of the group. "They'd kill
me if 1 told you," she says with a laugh. She is
willing to divulge, however, that an unofficial
motto of the organization is "Ram's Head
will get you laid."
"I guess there's some truth to that. It can (
be an incestuous situation," she says, adding '
that "the retreat is known as the orgy ... and '
it was." i

However, this camaraderie can exclude
those who might bring a new perspective to
the organization, says Andrew Shakman.
Shakman, who graduated last year and is cur
rently at USC, was the assistant director of

"Into the Woods" in 1991 and the
producer of "Cabaret" a year later.
"Ram's Head is a somewhat in-

sular organization, and unfortu
nately they therefore have a hard
time bringing in new blood," i

Shakman says. "Actore are out
side the community. They
don't feel like it's their orga
nization."

"Ram's Head is a very in
bred organization," says ju- i
nior Gabe Tissian, writer k
of "Night Baseball," a M
Winter One Act that M
went on to win the New
York Playwright's Fes
tival Award last year.
"A small group runs it, and

there are a lot of power plays going on.
Because it's so small and so few peo-

pie have all the decision
making power, they're not re
sponsive to what the vast ma
jority of people want at Stan
ford"

Open auditions for shows are
a way to bring in new actors, but
because of the loyalties involved in
the casting of plays, "auditions
usually become much less than
open," Tissian adds.

Shakrnan says that he feels the or
ganization suffers from a lack of ener
gy because it is unable to bring in the
"new blood" it needs, and that this in
turn affects the enthusiasm for the
shows that the organization chooses to
produce.

"The [organization's] fundamental
weakness is that it churns out shows, not
because anyone wants to do them, but be
cause we need to do a show," he says. "There's
not a lot of heart and soul behind them."
As an example, Shakman cites "Cabaret"
as a successful show because of the number of
people who came together to work on it, de

spite the fact that the production lost a sig
nificant amount of money. Although Gai
eties usually brings in more than enough to
pay for any loss of money in the spring show,
"Cabaret" s $43,000 budget drained even
this coverage. "It was not a success financial- i
ly," Shakman says, "but we got 160 people j
working on the show. We've got to keep new i
people coming. Ram's Head has that inten- I
tion but it doesn't work," he says.
Michael DeGusta, a junior who managed <
Gaieties his freshman year and produced 1
"West Side Story" last year, echoes Shakman's <
sentiments. DeGusta says the main problems I
Ram's Head faces lie in a lack of concern for 1
producing good theater. "It doesn't seem to
be at the center," he says. "Just —

doing shows just

to do
shows is
not good
enough.

There's no
critical ex
amination
of, 'How can
we make this
a better

show?' "
DeGusta says that inept communication
and bickering have become such serious
problems that he hasn't worked in Ram's
Head this year, in part because he was tired of
dealing with same frustrations again and
again. He also claims there are a significant

number of former Ram's Head mem
bers who have left for similar reasons.
"For experienced people it's diffi
cult to do a good job within the cur
rent context," he says. "Ifl wanted to
design the spring show I'd like to
know the director was somewhat

knowledgeable. ..

I'd like to know the producer had an interest
in having my design implemented so that I
wouldn't he rowing the boat by myself. Also,
I don't like to learn from third-party sources
that someone didn't like my ideas."
DeGusta says that he has nothing against
inexperienced people. After all, he says,
"everyone starts that way." But some of Ram's
Head's fumblings have been

esp e -

ing, he
says. He
recounts
a story
where he
and a
friend
came dur
ing re
hearsal for
Gaieties
last

year
and saw that no
one had told the
all-frosh run
crew what their
responsibilities
were, though the
schedule had al
ready called for
dress rehearsal.
"No one
told them what
to do," DeGusta

says."The stage manager would call a cue 1
and they didn't know what to do. Then one of i
the set designers covered up the stage with a t
test sprayer in the middle of the stage. Every- 1
one was yelling at each other, one of the crew
members was crying and the crew was being i
called in to work from 3 p.m. to 1 a.m. with- 112
out a break. You just don't treat people like c
that." i
DeGusta says the board of directors <
should shoulder some of the blame. "Last t
year I don't know how many times the board
of directors argued whether the Ram's Head i
logo should go vertical or horizontal," he j
says. "There wasn't one thing that the board >
did that affected the course of Ram's Head,
whether in regard to relations with the drama I
department, or dealing with artistic issues. It t
needs focus and direction, and there isn't a |
desire to move forward. There's
no critical examina- I

'How

can we make this a
better show?' "

New Direction for the Ram?
In response to its critics, however, those
currently at the helm of Ram's Head ac
knowledge its past problems, but argue that
it has found a new sense of purpose that
stresses openness and communication
among its many members. "Ram's Head is

having more of an identity, more of a belong
ing," says Duxbury. "It's more of a communi
ty, a more cohesive group. If we keep people
happy then it has an identity."
Senior Stephanie Cawthon, another
member of the board of directors, said she
feels that the dynamics of the group are
changing for the better. "There's not a lot of
animosity," she said. "It's a cohesive group
and there's positive energy that hasn't been
there before."
This year, the energy seems to be stimulat
ing an organization which in recent times has
grown weary from the high intensity in
volved in producing ambitious productions.
"People in our organization burn out very
fast, but Gaieties didn't burn anybody out
this year," Cawthon observes. "If you see peo
ple coming back, that's good."
And while Cawthon recognizes that Ram's
Head is insular, she says that the closeness
criticized by so many of her peers is in
evitable in a drama organization. "When
you're involved with a show, you're involved
with the people in the show; when you're not,
you're not. People only know people within
the show," she says.
However, Cawthon admits that definite
changes could still be made. For example,
Cawthon feels that "Gaieties could be more
experimental than it is. Now, people are al
lowed to do Gaieties over and over again,"
she said. "It's ironic — we get excited when
we see new people coming in, but then we
don't utilize them."

Sophomore Akin Salawu said he
feels that Ram's Head's main problem
goes deeper than a lack of energy or a

dearth of new faces on the stage of
Memorial Auditorium. Instead, Salawu be
lieves Ram's Head is guilty of failing to exam
ine the type of shows that it produces.
"I wish Ram's Head wouLd do something
other than musicals. [It] would be an excel
lent group to do more plays because they
have the monev and they're fa-

mous," he says. Currently, the only
non-musicals Ram's Head does on
a yearly basis are the One Acts.
To address this perceived lack of stu-

dent drama at the University, Salawu
helped form Ergo, a "non-musical
theater group" for which "you don't
have to be able to sing and dance."
"Ram's Head does very well — it
makes theater fun, but we've managed to

do that too," he savs.
While Cawthon admits that the group
"could be more innovative" when it comes
to the selection of the spring show, she cau
tions that there are a number of reasons why
Ram's Head has always chosen a musical for
its final production of the year. For example,
as a student-run organization, Ram's Head is
forced to compete with the Drama Depart
ment, which tends to do non-musical pro
ductions.
"If we did serious drama, we would cut
out all those people who want to sing and
dance," Cawthon says. "A musical gets every
one on campus." Cawthon also points out
that, while non-musical drama can be found
through the Drama Department, there are

no other musicals on campus.
Cawthon says that Ram's Head "would
love to know" what kind of plays the student
body wants to see. "They don't tell us," she
explains, adding, "we can do almost any
thing."
Ram's Head may in fact benefit from the
competition of Salawu's new drama group,
Tissian says, since currently there is "no cap
italist incentive" for the group. "Ram's Head
should either be more open and diverse, or
there should be more student drama associa
tions," he advises.
Despite the organization's current prob
lems, supporters of Ram's Head believe there
is a brighter future for the group. "The
'Cabaret' year was the toughest we've ever
had," Cawthon says."From there we're build
ing back up. We're on a cycle — there has
been a downturn, but I do think there's an
upturn coming."
An E.P. With An Agenda
Executive producer Melissa Wilson, who
was elected last spring by the board of direc
tors, is more blunt. "We call 'Cabaret' the 'C'-
word," she says. "1 think everyone would
agree 'Cabaret' was the low point of Ram's
Head. It wasn't fun, and so interest dropped
away. The technical director went overboard
and every techie was burned out. It was ex
hausting. I swear 1 came down with chronic
fatigue syndrome with 'Cabaret.' It just bled
everyone."
Wilson has made a concerted effort to
change the way Ram's Head operates. She has
taken three goals to heart: accountability for
all members to both Ram's Head and parties
outside the group, such as Events and Ser
vices and the Drama Department; creating a
distinct identity for Ram's Head that's inclu
sive and open; and leadership visibility.
"Everyone knows me and can call me with
problems," she says. "Now producers of
shows say, 'Come to me if you have questions
or go to Melissa if you have a problem.' "
Wilson acknowledges that her agenda for
Ram's Head was born out of the numerous
problems that the group was mired in during
its previous years. "The Ram's Head I came to
was not a happy place," she says. "Writer and
directors vied for control in Gaieties. There
were some egos, and we had a board that had
a lot of egos. There was an sense of insanity
about it, but that's my perception. It's very
easy to be personally involved when you de
vote so much to a show. There were lines
drawn, people were allied with certain peo
ple, and there was a lot of emotionalism and
people took things personally. A lot of people
got alienated.
" The board knows my mission and under
stands it," she asserts. "No politics. No ru
mors. No backstabbing. We don't always
argue policy, policy, policy."
As an example of this year's turnaround,
she cites that all key technical positions for
the spring show have been filled, positions
that normally are assigned in March. The hir
ing of next year's executive producer as well
as the establishment of the spring show selec


Dongmin Shim - Daily
tion committee is also occurring this quarter,
which is earlier than usual. Movie nights,
parties and retreats have been expanded to
keep morale high. Service awards recognize
those who devote unacknowledged hours to
Ram's Head projects. A newsletter, known as
the Ram's Horn, keeps members up to date
on the group's activities. Actors now receive a
set of Ram's Head guidelines before every
production.
"There's no question Ram's Head is
stronger than it was one or two years ago,"
Wilson says without hesitation. Relations
with the Drama Department, once strained,
"are much better now," she says, mostly be
cause "we cleaned up our act." Proud of this
year's Gaieties, she argues it was better than
the previous two years' shows.
"It had sound problems," Wilson admits,
but she points out that "we never get on
Mem Aud stage until just before the show.
Until then we practice behind the Knoll in
trailers."
As for those former Ram's Head members
who have been disillusioned with their expe

rience, Wilson says that "I think they'd find it
a different organization. It's a totally different
bunch of people."
A Failed Winter One Act
When asked about the last-minute cancel
lation of one of the Winter One Acts this year,
Wilson groans, but is unafraid to discuss an
embarrassing situation that vividly illustrates
the thorny problems and conflicting person
alities that any dramatic production must
surmount.
"Cancelling One Acts is pathetic," says De-
Gusta. "This is a small, simple show, yet they
still couldn't keep it going or communication
flowing." lan McCrudden, director of 1991 's
acclaimed "Night Baseball" and member of
the Inside Outside acting troupe, says,"l
think that [the cancellation] is really shame
ful. Ultimately it's the failure of Ram's Head.
They committed to doing the show."
"Winter One Acts was not pleasant," Wil
son admits. According to Wilson, the writer
of the original play, "Yi-Chin," had some cre
ative differences, especially concerning the
ending, with the director. After some wran
gling, a compromise was achieved, and the
writer was to turn in the rewritten version be
fore winter break.
But the new script came in late. Just days

before opening night, the writer saw a re
hearsal and realized that the older version of
the play, one that he had rejected, was going
to be performed.
"We were embarrassed," said Wilson.
"The writer should have trust that his work
will be performed. The director was fired,
and we presented the option to the writer,
'We can pull the play or put in your ending
and you can direct it.' We wanted to see the
play done, but the writer said no, I can't do
this. We honored that. I couldn't make it
right with the writer but I honored his wish
es."
Wilson says that the director called her
earlier during discussions about the play, but
she said that such issues were best settled be
tween the producer of Winter One Acts, the
writer and the director, and that she, as exec
utive producer, should only step in if "it be
came an organizational problem." But by the
time the problem surfaced just days before its
first performance, any remedy was too little,
too late.
"! don't feel like the producer or I were
working with accurate information," Wilson
says, and she says she's unsure whether there
was much more she or the board could have
done to prevent the cancellation of the play.
Nevertheless, she says, "in another year it

would have been a crisis situation." And on a
side note, she adds that "the director of the
Winter One Act is a firosh and is still in Ram's
Head, and doing a great job in 'Guys and
Dolls/ 1 don't want to give the impression
that we kicked him out of the organization."
A "Hearty Animal"
Recovering from the trials and tribula
tions that have plagued its recent history,
Ram's Head members hope that this year's
spring show, "Guys and Dolls," may be just
the remedy that the tired organization needs.
"This is the time for the happy, upbeat
Broadway show," explains Duxbury, and her
sentiments are echoed by Wilson. The selec
tion of the show came down to a decision be
tween "Guys and Dolls" and another musi
cal, "Sweeney Todd," but Wilson says"l
wanted a happy musical."
As Ram's Head works through personnel
problems, cancelled shows and all the other
difficulties that disturb its daily existence,
members feel they can take heart from the
strength and resilience of their mascot — a
ram bearing the unlikely name of Turalura
Goldfarb.
Explains Andre, "Good year or bad year,
the Ram keeps on marching on. It's a hearty
animal." ■

Cawthon feels that "Gaieties could be more
experimental than it is. Now, people are al
lowed to do Gaieties over and over again,"
she said. "It's ironic — we get excited when
we see new people coming in, but then we
don't utilize them."

Sophomore Akin Salawu said he
feels that Ram's Head's main problem
goes deeper than a lack of energy or a

dearth of new faces on the stage of
Memorial Auditorium. Instead, Salawu be
lieves Ram's Head is guilty of failing to exam
ine the type of shows that it produces.
"I wish Ram's Head wouLd do something
other than musicals. [It] would be an excel
lent group to do more plays because they
have the monev and they're fa-

mous," he says. Currently, the only
non-musicals Ram's Head does on
a yearly basis are the One Acts.
To address this perceived lack of stu-

dent drama at the University, Salawu
helped form Ergo, a "non-musical
theater group" for which "you don't
have to be able to sing and dance."
"Ram's Head does very well — it
makes theater fun, but we've managed to

do that too," he savs.
While Cawthon admits that the group
"could be more innovative" when it comes
to the selection of the spring show, she cau
tions that there are a number of reasons why
Ram's Head has always chosen a musical for
its final production of the year. For example,
as a student-run organization, Ram's Head is
forced to compete with the Drama Depart
ment, which tends to do non-musical pro
ductions.
"If we did serious drama, we would cut
out all those people who want to sing and
dance," Cawthon says. "A musical gets every
one on campus." Cawthon also points out
that, while non-musical drama can be found
through the Drama Department, there are

no other musicals on campus.
Cawthon says that Ram's Head "would
love to know" what kind of plays the student
body wants to see. "They don't tell us," she
explains, adding, "we can do almost any
thing."
Ram's Head may in fact benefit from the
competition of Salawu's new drama group,
Tissian says, since currently there is "no cap
italist incentive" for the group. "Ram's Head
should either be more open and diverse, or
there should be more student drama associa
tions," he advises.
Despite the organization's current prob
lems, supporters of Ram's Head believe there
is a brighter future for the group. "The
'Cabaret' year was the toughest we've ever
had," Cawthon says."From there we're build
ing back up. We're on a cycle — there has
been a downturn, but I do think there's an
upturn coming."
An E.P. With An Agenda
Executive producer Melissa Wilson, who
was elected last spring by the board of direc
tors, is more blunt. "We call 'Cabaret' the 'C'-
word," she says. "1 think everyone would
agree 'Cabaret' was the low point of Ram's
Head. It wasn't fun, and so interest dropped
away. The technical director went overboard
and every techie was burned out. It was ex
hausting. I swear 1 came down with chronic
fatigue syndrome with 'Cabaret.' It just bled
everyone."
Wilson has made a concerted effort to
change the way Ram's Head operates. She has
taken three goals to heart: accountability for
all members to both Ram's Head and parties
outside the group, such as Events and Ser
vices and the Drama Department; creating a
distinct identity for Ram's Head that's inclu
sive and open; and leadership visibility.
"Everyone knows me and can call me with
problems," she says. "Now producers of
shows say, 'Come to me if you have questions
or go to Melissa if you have a problem.' "
Wilson acknowledges that her agenda for
Ram's Head was born out of the numerous
problems that the group was mired in during
its previous years. "The Ram's Head I came to
was not a happy place," she says. "Writer and
directors vied for control in Gaieties. There
were some egos, and we had a board that had
a lot of egos. There was an sense of insanity
about it, but that's my perception. It's very
easy to be personally involved when you de
vote so much to a show. There were lines
drawn, people were allied with certain peo
ple, and there was a lot of emotionalism and
people took things personally. A lot of people
got alienated.
" The board knows my mission and under
stands it," she asserts. "No politics. No ru
mors. No backstabbing. We don't always
argue policy, policy, policy."
As an example of this year's turnaround,
she cites that all key technical positions for
the spring show have been filled, positions
that normally are assigned in March. The hir
ing of next year's executive producer as well
as the establishment of the spring show selec

tion committee is also occurring this quarter,
which is earlier than usual. Movie nights,
parties and retreats have been expanded to
keep morale high. Service awards recognize
those who devote unacknowledged hours to
Ram's Head projects. A newsletter, known as
the Ram's Horn, keeps members up to date
on the group's activities. Actors now receive a
set of Ram's Head guidelines before every
production.
"There's no question Ram's Head is
stronger than it was one or two years ago,"
Wilson says without hesitation. Relations
with the Drama Department, once strained,
"are much better now," she says, mostly be
cause "we cleaned up our act." Proud of this
year's Gaieties, she argues it was better than
the previous two years' shows.
"It had sound problems," Wilson admits,
but she points out that "we never get on
Mem Aud stage until just before the show.
Until then we practice behind the Knoll in
trailers."
As for those former Ram's Head members
who have been disillusioned with their expe

rience, Wilson says that "I think they'd find it
a different organization. It's a totally different
bunch of people."
A Failed Winter One Act
When asked about the last-minute cancel
lation of one of the Winter One Acts this year,
Wilson groans, but is unafraid to discuss an
embarrassing situation that vividly illustrates
the thorny problems and conflicting person
alities that any dramatic production must
surmount.
"Cancelling One Acts is pathetic," says De-
Gusta. "This is a small, simple show, yet they
still couldn't keep it going or communication
flowing." lan McCrudden, director of 1991 's
acclaimed "Night Baseball" and member of
the Inside Outside acting troupe, says,"l
think that [the cancellation] is really shame
ful. Ultimately it's the failure of Ram's Head.
They committed to doing the show."
"Winter One Acts was not pleasant," Wil
son admits. According to Wilson, the writer
of the original play, "Yi-Chin," had some cre
ative differences, especially concerning the
ending, with the director. After some wran
gling, a compromise was achieved, and the
writer was to turn in the rewritten version be
fore winter break.
But the new script came in late. Just days

before opening night, the writer saw a re
hearsal and realized that the older version of
the play, one that he had rejected, was going
to be performed.
"We were embarrassed," said Wilson.
"The writer should have trust that his work
will be performed. The director was fired,
and we presented the option to the writer,
'We can pull the play or put in your ending
and you can direct it.' We wanted to see the
play done, but the writer said no, I can't do
this. We honored that. I couldn't make it
right with the writer but I honored his wish
es."
Wilson says that the director called her
earlier during discussions about the play, but
she said that such issues were best settled be
tween the producer of Winter One Acts, the
writer and the director, and that she, as exec
utive producer, should only step in if "it be
came an organizational problem." But by the
time the problem surfaced just days before its
first performance, any remedy was too little,
too late.
"! don't feel like the producer or I were
working with accurate information," Wilson
says, and she says she's unsure whether there
was much more she or the board could have
done to prevent the cancellation of the play.
Nevertheless, she says, "in another year it

would have been a crisis situation." And on a
side note, she adds that "the director of the
Winter One Act is a firosh and is still in Ram's
Head, and doing a great job in 'Guys and
Dolls/ 1 don't want to give the impression
that we kicked him out of the organization."
A "Hearty Animal"
Recovering from the trials and tribula
tions that have plagued its recent history,
Ram's Head members hope that this year's
spring show, "Guys and Dolls," may be just
the remedy that the tired organization needs.
"This is the time for the happy, upbeat
Broadway show," explains Duxbury, and her
sentiments are echoed by Wilson. The selec
tion of the show came down to a decision be
tween "Guys and Dolls" and another musi
cal, "Sweeney Todd," but Wilson says"l
wanted a happy musical."
As Ram's Head works through personnel
problems, cancelled shows and all the other
difficulties that disturb its daily existence,
members feel they can take heart from the
strength and resilience of their mascot — a
ram bearing the unlikely name of Turalura
Goldfarb.
Explains Andre, "Good year or bad year,
the Ram keeps on marching on. It's a hearty
animal." ■
In 1911, when tuition was still free, a
group of Stanford men planned a satiri
cal variety show to be performed before
the annual violence-prone Stanford-Califor
nia football game. They faced grim re
sources: there was no music department, no
drama department and the men's gymnasi
um was the only theatrical venue. But Stan
ford's appetite for student-run drama was
voracious, and the number of aspiring ac
tors, dancers, singers and writers could sus
tain several of the grandest stage produc
tions.
Adopting their name from a long-since
lost wall decoration, Ram's Head Theatrical
Society remains the largest and oldest stu
dent organization for drama on campus,
producing Big Game Gaieties, Spontaneous
Generation performances, Winter One Acts
and the jewel in their crown, the infamous
spring show. Now armed with venues such as
Memorial Auditorium, tutorials with drama
department mavens, a budget in the tens of
thousands of dollars and money stashed in
the bank, Ram's Head has weathered its share
of misadventures and flops.
Many say that the past few years have been
especially hard. A lack of artistic vision, tan
gled communications with the Drama De
partment, raging tempers, rumors and back
stabbing have plagued Ram's Head, and have
caused some to question whether Ram's
Head can continue to create high-caliber the
ater in an atmosphere of lean financial sup
port and small audiences.
A Close Bunch
Those familiar with the hours, frustration
and ennui associated with a major stage pro
duction know that working behind the
scenes breeds an inevitable familiarity.
"I've never worked so hard in my life and
been so happy with what I was doing," says
junior Alison Duxbury, who's been working
with Ram's Head since her freshman year and
is now a member of the Ram's Head board of
directors. Describing her stint as run crew
chief for "Cabaret," the spring show two years
ago, she says,"I would be yelling cues at night
in my sleep. 1 was constantly thinking about
it. My roommate thought I had gone nuts."
The hours spent working in close confines
with the same people, day after day, natural
ly lead to a close camaraderie among Ram's
Head members. But many of the organiza
tion's members say lately this closeness has
become more detrimental than beneficial.
The "techies" — those involved with tech
nical production such as lighting, stage man
agement and set crew — are one example of
how close people in Ram's Head can become.
Although the group represents a small frac
tion of the organization's 400-member ros
ter, their skilled labor and willingness to sac
rifice hours of their life make the "techies" in
dispensable to the organization's survival,
says Duxbury. Adds Dave Andre, a member
of last year's board of directors: "Ram's Head
has been described as a tight core of techies

surrounded by actors."
The closeknit nature of the troupe's core is
evidenced by rituals such as "Brenting" — a
rite named after previous Ram's Head mem
ber Brent Chism that involves meeting at the
Coffee House Wednesday nights — and a
code of "techie rules" that "cannot be di
vulged," says Melissa Wilson, the current ex
ecutive producer of the group. "They'd kill
me if 1 told you," she says with a laugh. She is
willing to divulge, however, that an unofficial
motto of the organization is "Ram's Head
will get you laid."
"I guess there's some truth to that. It can (
be an incestuous situation," she says, adding '
that "the retreat is known as the orgy ... and '
it was." i

However, this camaraderie can exclude
those who might bring a new perspective to
the organization, says Andrew Shakman.
Shakman, who graduated last year and is cur
rently at USC, was the assistant director of

"Into the Woods" in 1991 and the
producer of "Cabaret" a year later.
"Ram's Head is a somewhat in-

sular organization, and unfortu
nately they therefore have a hard
time bringing in new blood," i

Shakman says. "Actore are out
side the community. They
don't feel like it's their orga
nization."

"Ram's Head is a very in
bred organization," says ju- i
nior Gabe Tissian, writer k
of "Night Baseball," a M
Winter One Act that M
went on to win the New
York Playwright's Fes
tival Award last year.
"A small group runs it, and

there are a lot of power plays going on.
Because it's so small and so few peo-

pie have all the decision
making power, they're not re
sponsive to what the vast ma
jority of people want at Stan
ford"

Open auditions for shows are
a way to bring in new actors, but
because of the loyalties involved in
the casting of plays, "auditions
usually become much less than
open," Tissian adds.

Shakrnan says that he feels the or
ganization suffers from a lack of ener
gy because it is unable to bring in the
"new blood" it needs, and that this in
turn affects the enthusiasm for the
shows that the organization chooses to
produce.

"The [organization's] fundamental
weakness is that it churns out shows, not
because anyone wants to do them, but be
cause we need to do a show," he says. "There's
not a lot of heart and soul behind them."
As an example, Shakman cites "Cabaret"
as a successful show because of the number of
people who came together to work on it, de

spite the fact that the production lost a sig
nificant amount of money. Although Gai
eties usually brings in more than enough to
pay for any loss of money in the spring show,
"Cabaret" s $43,000 budget drained even
this coverage. "It was not a success financial- i
ly," Shakman says, "but we got 160 people j
working on the show. We've got to keep new i
people coming. Ram's Head has that inten- I
tion but it doesn't work," he says.
Michael DeGusta, a junior who managed <
Gaieties his freshman year and produced 1
"West Side Story" last year, echoes Shakman's <
sentiments. DeGusta says the main problems I
Ram's Head faces lie in a lack of concern for 1
producing good theater. "It doesn't seem to
be at the center," he says. "Just —

doing shows just

to do
shows is
not good
enough.

There's no
critical ex
amination
of, 'How can
we make this
a better

show?' "
DeGusta says that inept communication
and bickering have become such serious
problems that he hasn't worked in Ram's
Head this year, in part because he was tired of
dealing with same frustrations again and
again. He also claims there are a significant

number of former Ram's Head mem
bers who have left for similar reasons.
"For experienced people it's diffi
cult to do a good job within the cur
rent context," he says. "Ifl wanted to
design the spring show I'd like to
know the director was somewhat

knowledgeable. ..

I'd like to know the producer had an interest
in having my design implemented so that I
wouldn't he rowing the boat by myself. Also,
I don't like to learn from third-party sources
that someone didn't like my ideas."
DeGusta says that he has nothing against
inexperienced people. After all, he says,
"everyone starts that way." But some of Ram's
Head's fumblings have been

ing, he
says. He
recounts
a story
where he
and a
friend
came dur

hearsal for
Gaieties
last

year
and saw that no
one had told the
all-frosh run
crew what their
responsibilities
were, though the
schedule had al
ready called for
dress rehearsal.
"No one
told them what
to do," DeGusta

says."The stage manager would call a cue 1
and they didn't know what to do. Then one of i
the set designers covered up the stage with a t
test sprayer in the middle of the stage. Every- 1
one was yelling at each other, one of the crew
members was crying and the crew was being i
called in to work from 3 p.m. to 1 a.m. with- 112
out a break. You just don't treat people like c
that." i
DeGusta says the board of directors <
should shoulder some of the blame. "Last t
year I don't know how many times the board
of directors argued whether the Ram's Head i
logo should go vertical or horizontal," he j
says. "There wasn't one thing that the board >
did that affected the course of Ram's Head,
whether in regard to relations with the drama I
department, or dealing with artistic issues. It t
needs focus and direction, and there isn't a |
desire to move forward. There's
no critical examina- I

'How

can we make this a
better show?' "

New Direction for the Ram?
In response to its critics, however, those
currently at the helm of Ram's Head ac
knowledge its past problems, but argue that
it has found a new sense of purpose that
stresses openness and communication
among its many members. "Ram's Head is

having more of an identity, more of a belong
ing," says Duxbury. "It's more of a communi
ty, a more cohesive group. If we keep people
happy then it has an identity."
Senior Stephanie Cawthon, another
member of the board of directors, said she
feels that the dynamics of the group are
changing for the better. "There's not a lot of
animosity," she said. "It's a cohesive group
and there's positive energy that hasn't been
there before."
This year, the energy seems to be stimulat
ing an organization which in recent times has
grown weary from the high intensity in
volved in producing ambitious productions.
"People in our organization burn out very
fast, but Gaieties didn't burn anybody out
this year," Cawthon observes. "If you see peo
ple coming back, that's good."
And while Cawthon recognizes that Ram's
Head is insular, she says that the closeness
criticized by so many of her peers is in
evitable in a drama organization. "When
you're involved with a show, you're involved
with the people in the show; when you're not,
you're not. People only know people within
the show," she says.
However, Cawthon admits that definite
changes could still be made. For example,
Cawthon feels that "Gaieties could be more
experimental than it is. Now, people are al
lowed to do Gaieties over and over again,"
she said. "It's ironic — we get excited when
we see new people coming in, but then we
don't utilize them."

especially hard. A lack of artistic vision, tan
gled communications with the Drama De
partment, raging tempers, rumors and back
stabbing have plagued Ram's Head, and have
caused some to question whether Ram's
Head can continue to create high-caliber the
ater in an atmosphere of lean financial sup
port and small audiences.
A Close Bunch
Those familiar with the hours, frustration
and ennui associated with a major stage pro
duction know that working behind the
scenes breeds an inevitable familiarity.
"I've never worked so hard in my life and
been so happy with what I was doing," says
junior Alison Duxbury, who's been working
with Ram's Head since her freshman year and
is now a member of the Ram's Head board of
directors. Describing her stint as run crew
chief for "Cabaret," the spring show two years
ago, she says,"I would be yelling cues at night
in my sleep. 1 was constantly thinking about
it. My roommate thought I had gone nuts."
The hours spent working in close confines
with the same people, day after day, natural
ly lead to a close camaraderie among Ram's
Head members. But many of the organiza
tion's members say lately this closeness has
become more detrimental than beneficial.
The "techies" — those involved with tech
nical production such as lighting, stage man
agement and set crew — are one example of
how close people in Ram's Head can become.
Although the group represents a small frac
tion of the organization's 400-member ros
ter, their skilled labor and willingness to sac
rifice hours of their life make the "techies" in
dispensable to the organization's survival,
says Duxbury. Adds Dave Andre, a member
of last year's board of directors: "Ram's Head
has been described as a tight core of techies

surrounded by actors."
The closeknit nature of the troupe's core is
evidenced by rituals such as "Brenting" — a
rite named after previous Ram's Head mem
ber Brent Chism that involves meeting at the
Coffee House Wednesday nights — and a
code of "techie rules" that "cannot be di
vulged," says Melissa Wilson, the current ex
ecutive producer of the group. "They'd kill
me if 1 told you," she says with a laugh. She is
willing to divulge, however, that an unofficial
motto of the organization is "Ram's Head
will get you laid."
"I guess there's some truth to that. It can (
be an incestuous situation," she says, adding '
that "the retreat is known as the orgy ... and '
it was." i

However, this camaraderie can exclude
those who might bring a new perspective to
the organization, says Andrew Shakman.
Shakman, who graduated last year and is cur
rently at USC, was the assistant director of

"Into the Woods" in 1991 and the
producer of "Cabaret" a year later.
"Ram's Head is a somewhat in-

sular organization, and unfortu
nately they therefore have a hard
time bringing in new blood," i

Shakman says. "Actore are out
side the community. They
don't feel like it's their orga
nization."

"Ram's Head is a very in
bred organization," says ju- i
nior Gabe Tissian, writer k
of "Night Baseball," a M
Winter One Act that M
went on to win the New
York Playwright's Fes
tival Award last year.
"A small group runs it, and

there are a lot of power plays going on.
Because it's so small and so few peo-

pie have all the decision
making power, they're not re
sponsive to what the vast ma
jority of people want at Stan
ford"

Open auditions for shows are
a way to bring in new actors, but
because of the loyalties involved in
the casting of plays, "auditions
usually become much less than
open," Tissian adds.

Shakrnan says that he feels the or
ganization suffers from a lack of ener
gy because it is unable to bring in the
"new blood" it needs, and that this in
turn affects the enthusiasm for the
shows that the organization chooses to
produce.

"The [organization's] fundamental
weakness is that it churns out shows, not
because anyone wants to do them, but be
cause we need to do a show," he says. "There's
not a lot of heart and soul behind them."
As an example, Shakman cites "Cabaret"
as a successful show because of the number of
people who came together to work on it, de

spite the fact that the production lost a sig
nificant amount of money. Although Gai
eties usually brings in more than enough to
pay for any loss of money in the spring show,
"Cabaret" s $43,000 budget drained even
this coverage. "It was not a success financial- i
ly," Shakman says, "but we got 160 people j
working on the show. We've got to keep new i
people coming. Ram's Head has that inten- I
tion but it doesn't work," he says.
Michael DeGusta, a junior who managed <
Gaieties his freshman year and produced 1
"West Side Story" last year, echoes Shakman's <
sentiments. DeGusta says the main problems I
Ram's Head faces lie in a lack of concern for 1
producing good theater. "It doesn't seem to
be at the center," he says. "Just —

doing shows just

to do
shows is
not good
enough.

There's no
critical ex
amination
of, 'How can
we make this
a better

show?' "
DeGusta says that inept communication
and bickering have become such serious
problems that he hasn't worked in Ram's
Head this year, in part because he was tired of
dealing with same frustrations again and
again. He also claims there are a significant

number of former Ram's Head mem
bers who have left for similar reasons.
"For experienced people it's diffi
cult to do a good job within the cur
rent context," he says. "Ifl wanted to
design the spring show I'd like to
know the director was somewhat

knowledgeable. ..

I'd like to know the producer had an interest
in having my design implemented so that I
wouldn't he rowing the boat by myself. Also,
I don't like to learn from third-party sources
that someone didn't like my ideas."
DeGusta says that he has nothing against
inexperienced people. After all, he says,
"everyone starts that way." But some of Ram's
Head's fumblings have been

esp e -

ing, he
says. He
recounts
a story
where he
and a
friend
came dur
ing re
hearsal for
Gaieties
last

year
and saw that no
one had told the
all-frosh run
crew what their
responsibilities
were, though the
schedule had al
ready called for
dress rehearsal.
"No one
told them what
to do," DeGusta

says."The stage manager would call a cue 1
and they didn't know what to do. Then one of i
the set designers covered up the stage with a t
test sprayer in the middle of the stage. Every- 1
one was yelling at each other, one of the crew
members was crying and the crew was being i
called in to work from 3 p.m. to 1 a.m. with- 112
out a break. You just don't treat people like c
that." i
DeGusta says the board of directors <
should shoulder some of the blame. "Last t
year I don't know how many times the board
of directors argued whether the Ram's Head i
logo should go vertical or horizontal," he j
says. "There wasn't one thing that the board >
did that affected the course of Ram's Head,
whether in regard to relations with the drama I
department, or dealing with artistic issues. It t
needs focus and direction, and there isn't a |
desire to move forward. There's
no critical examina- I

'How

can we make this a
better show?' "

New Direction for the Ram?
In response to its critics, however, those
currently at the helm of Ram's Head ac
knowledge its past problems, but argue that
it has found a new sense of purpose that
stresses openness and communication
among its many members. "Ram's Head is

having more of an identity, more of a belong
ing," says Duxbury. "It's more of a communi
ty, a more cohesive group. If we keep people
happy then it has an identity."
Senior Stephanie Cawthon, another
member of the board of directors, said she
feels that the dynamics of the group are
changing for the better. "There's not a lot of
animosity," she said. "It's a cohesive group
and there's positive energy that hasn't been
there before."
This year, the energy seems to be stimulat
ing an organization which in recent times has
grown weary from the high intensity in
volved in producing ambitious productions.
"People in our organization burn out very
fast, but Gaieties didn't burn anybody out
this year," Cawthon observes. "If you see peo
ple coming back, that's good."
And while Cawthon recognizes that Ram's
Head is insular, she says that the closeness
criticized by so many of her peers is in
evitable in a drama organization. "When
you're involved with a show, you're involved
with the people in the show; when you're not,
you're not. People only know people within
the show," she says.
However, Cawthon admits that definite
changes could still be made. For example,
Cawthon feels that "Gaieties could be more
experimental than it is. Now, people are al
lowed to do Gaieties over and over again,"
she said. "It's ironic — we get excited when
we see new people coming in, but then we
don't utilize them."

Sophomore Akin Salawu said he
feels that Ram's Head's main problem
goes deeper than a lack of energy or a

dearth of new faces on the stage of
Memorial Auditorium. Instead, Salawu be
lieves Ram's Head is guilty of failing to exam
ine the type of shows that it produces.
"I wish Ram's Head wouLd do something
other than musicals. [It] would be an excel
lent group to do more plays because they
have the monev and they're fa-

mous," he says. Currently, the only
non-musicals Ram's Head does on
a yearly basis are the One Acts.
To address this perceived lack of stu-

dent drama at the University, Salawu
helped form Ergo, a "non-musical
theater group" for which "you don't
have to be able to sing and dance."
"Ram's Head does very well — it
makes theater fun, but we've managed to

do that too," he savs.
While Cawthon admits that the group
"could be more innovative" when it comes
to the selection of the spring show, she cau
tions that there are a number of reasons why
Ram's Head has always chosen a musical for
its final production of the year. For example,
as a student-run organization, Ram's Head is
forced to compete with the Drama Depart
ment, which tends to do non-musical pro
ductions.
"If we did serious drama, we would cut
out all those people who want to sing and
dance," Cawthon says. "A musical gets every
one on campus." Cawthon also points out
that, while non-musical drama can be found
through the Drama Department, there are

no other musicals on campus.
Cawthon says that Ram's Head "would
love to know" what kind of plays the student
body wants to see. "They don't tell us," she
explains, adding, "we can do almost any
thing."
Ram's Head may in fact benefit from the
competition of Salawu's new drama group,
Tissian says, since currently there is "no cap
italist incentive" for the group. "Ram's Head
should either be more open and diverse, or
there should be more student drama associa
tions," he advises.
Despite the organization's current prob
lems, supporters of Ram's Head believe there
is a brighter future for the group. "The
'Cabaret' year was the toughest we've ever
had," Cawthon says."From there we're build
ing back up. We're on a cycle — there has
been a downturn, but I do think there's an
upturn coming."
An E.P. With An Agenda
Executive producer Melissa Wilson, who
was elected last spring by the board of direc
tors, is more blunt. "We call 'Cabaret' the 'C'-
word," she says. "1 think everyone would
agree 'Cabaret' was the low point of Ram's
Head. It wasn't fun, and so interest dropped
away. The technical director went overboard
and every techie was burned out. It was ex
hausting. I swear 1 came down with chronic
fatigue syndrome with 'Cabaret.' It just bled
everyone."
Wilson has made a concerted effort to
change the way Ram's Head operates. She has
taken three goals to heart: accountability for
all members to both Ram's Head and parties
outside the group, such as Events and Ser
vices and the Drama Department; creating a
distinct identity for Ram's Head that's inclu
sive and open; and leadership visibility.
"Everyone knows me and can call me with
problems," she says. "Now producers of
shows say, 'Come to me if you have questions
or go to Melissa if you have a problem.' "
Wilson acknowledges that her agenda for
Ram's Head was born out of the numerous
problems that the group was mired in during
its previous years. "The Ram's Head I came to
was not a happy place," she says. "Writer and
directors vied for control in Gaieties. There
were some egos, and we had a board that had
a lot of egos. There was an sense of insanity
about it, but that's my perception. It's very
easy to be personally involved when you de
vote so much to a show. There were lines
drawn, people were allied with certain peo
ple, and there was a lot of emotionalism and
people took things personally. A lot of people
got alienated.
" The board knows my mission and under
stands it," she asserts. "No politics. No ru
mors. No backstabbing. We don't always
argue policy, policy, policy."
As an example of this year's turnaround,
she cites that all key technical positions for
the spring show have been filled, positions
that normally are assigned in March. The hir
ing of next year's executive producer as well
as the establishment of the spring show selec


Dongmin Shim - Daily
tion committee is also occurring this quarter,
which is earlier than usual. Movie nights,
parties and retreats have been expanded to
keep morale high. Service awards recognize
those who devote unacknowledged hours to
Ram's Head projects. A newsletter, known as
the Ram's Horn, keeps members up to date
on the group's activities. Actors now receive a
set of Ram's Head guidelines before every
production.
"There's no question Ram's Head is
stronger than it was one or two years ago,"
Wilson says without hesitation. Relations
with the Drama Department, once strained,
"are much better now," she says, mostly be
cause "we cleaned up our act." Proud of this
year's Gaieties, she argues it was better than
the previous two years' shows.
"It had sound problems," Wilson admits,
but she points out that "we never get on
Mem Aud stage until just before the show.
Until then we practice behind the Knoll in
trailers."
As for those former Ram's Head members
who have been disillusioned with their expe

rience, Wilson says that "I think they'd find it
a different organization. It's a totally different
bunch of people."
A Failed Winter One Act
When asked about the last-minute cancel
lation of one of the Winter One Acts this year,
Wilson groans, but is unafraid to discuss an
embarrassing situation that vividly illustrates
the thorny problems and conflicting person
alities that any dramatic production must
surmount.
"Cancelling One Acts is pathetic," says De-
Gusta. "This is a small, simple show, yet they
still couldn't keep it going or communication
flowing." lan McCrudden, director of 1991 's
acclaimed "Night Baseball" and member of
the Inside Outside acting troupe, says,"l
think that [the cancellation] is really shame
ful. Ultimately it's the failure of Ram's Head.
They committed to doing the show."
"Winter One Acts was not pleasant," Wil
son admits. According to Wilson, the writer
of the original play, "Yi-Chin," had some cre
ative differences, especially concerning the
ending, with the director. After some wran
gling, a compromise was achieved, and the
writer was to turn in the rewritten version be
fore winter break.
But the new script came in late. Just days

before opening night, the writer saw a re
hearsal and realized that the older version of
the play, one that he had rejected, was going
to be performed.
"We were embarrassed," said Wilson.
"The writer should have trust that his work
will be performed. The director was fired,
and we presented the option to the writer,
'We can pull the play or put in your ending
and you can direct it.' We wanted to see the
play done, but the writer said no, I can't do
this. We honored that. I couldn't make it
right with the writer but I honored his wish
es."
Wilson says that the director called her
earlier during discussions about the play, but
she said that such issues were best settled be
tween the producer of Winter One Acts, the
writer and the director, and that she, as exec
utive producer, should only step in if "it be
came an organizational problem." But by the
time the problem surfaced just days before its
first performance, any remedy was too little,
too late.
"! don't feel like the producer or I were
working with accurate information," Wilson
says, and she says she's unsure whether there
was much more she or the board could have
done to prevent the cancellation of the play.
Nevertheless, she says, "in another year it

would have been a crisis situation." And on a
side note, she adds that "the director of the
Winter One Act is a firosh and is still in Ram's
Head, and doing a great job in 'Guys and
Dolls/ 1 don't want to give the impression
that we kicked him out of the organization."
A "Hearty Animal"
Recovering from the trials and tribula
tions that have plagued its recent history,
Ram's Head members hope that this year's
spring show, "Guys and Dolls," may be just
the remedy that the tired organization needs.
"This is the time for the happy, upbeat
Broadway show," explains Duxbury, and her
sentiments are echoed by Wilson. The selec
tion of the show came down to a decision be
tween "Guys and Dolls" and another musi
cal, "Sweeney Todd," but Wilson says"l
wanted a happy musical."
As Ram's Head works through personnel
problems, cancelled shows and all the other
difficulties that disturb its daily existence,
members feel they can take heart from the
strength and resilience of their mascot — a
ram bearing the unlikely name of Turalura
Goldfarb.
Explains Andre, "Good year or bad year,
the Ram keeps on marching on. It's a hearty
animal." ■
In 1911, when tuition was still free, a
group of Stanford men planned a satiri
cal variety show to be performed before
the annual violence-prone Stanford-Califor
nia football game. They faced grim re
sources: there was no music department, no
drama department and the men's gymnasi
um was the only theatrical venue. But Stan
ford's appetite for student-run drama was
voracious, and the number of aspiring ac
tors, dancers, singers and writers could sus
tain several of the grandest stage produc
tions.
Adopting their name from a long-since
lost wall decoration, Ram's Head Theatrical
Society remains the largest and oldest stu
dent organization for drama on campus,
producing Big Game Gaieties, Spontaneous
Generation performances, Winter One Acts
and the jewel in their crown, the infamous
spring show. Now armed with venues such as
Memorial Auditorium, tutorials with drama
department mavens, a budget in the tens of
thousands of dollars and money stashed in
the bank, Ram's Head has weathered its share
of misadventures and flops.
Many say that the past few years have been
especially hard. A lack of artistic vision, tan
gled communications with the Drama De
partment, raging tempers, rumors and back
stabbing have plagued Ram's Head, and have
caused some to question whether Ram's
Head can continue to create high-caliber the
ater in an atmosphere of lean financial sup
port and small audiences.

"Ram's Head does very well — it
makes theater fun, but we've managed to

do that too," he savs.
While Cawthon admits that the group
"could be more innovative" when it comes
to the selection of the spring show, she cau
tions that there are a number of reasons why
Ram's Head has always chosen a musical for
its final production of the year. For example,
as a student-run organization, Ram's Head is
forced to compete with the Drama Depart
ment, which tends to do non-musical pro
ductions.
"If we did serious drama, we would cut
out all those people who want to sing and
dance," Cawthon says. "A musical gets every
one on campus." Cawthon also points out
that, while non-musical drama can be found
through the Drama Department, there are

no other musicals on campus.
Cawthon says that Ram's Head "would
love to know" what kind of plays the student
body wants to see. "They don't tell us," she
explains, adding, "we can do almost any
thing."
Ram's Head may in fact benefit from the
competition of Salawu's new drama group,
Tissian says, since currently there is "no cap
italist incentive" for the group. "Ram's Head
should either be more open and diverse, or
there should be more student drama associa
tions," he advises.
Despite the organization's current prob
lems, supporters of Ram's Head believe there
is a brighter future for the group. "The
'Cabaret' year was the toughest we've ever
had," Cawthon says."From there we're build
ing back up. We're on a cycle — there has
been a downturn, but I do think there's an
upturn coming."
An E.P. With An Agenda
Executive producer Melissa Wilson, who
was elected last spring by the board of direc
tors, is more blunt. "We call 'Cabaret' the 'C'-
word," she says. "1 think everyone would
agree 'Cabaret' was the low point of Ram's
Head. It wasn't fun, and so interest dropped
away. The technical director went overboard
and every techie was burned out. It was ex
hausting. I swear 1 came down with chronic
fatigue syndrome with 'Cabaret.' It just bled
everyone."
Wilson has made a concerted effort to
change the way Ram's Head operates. She has
taken three goals to heart: accountability for
all members to both Ram's Head and parties
outside the group, such as Events and Ser
vices and the Drama Department; creating a
distinct identity for Ram's Head that's inclu
sive and open; and leadership visibility.
"Everyone knows me and can call me with
problems," she says. "Now producers of
shows say, 'Come to me if you have questions
or go to Melissa if you have a problem.' "
Wilson acknowledges that her agenda for
Ram's Head was born out of the numerous
problems that the group was mired in during
its previous years. "The Ram's Head I came to
was not a happy place," she says. "Writer and
directors vied for control in Gaieties. There
were some egos, and we had a board that had
a lot of egos. There was an sense of insanity
about it, but that's my perception. It's very
easy to be personally involved when you de
vote so much to a show. There were lines
drawn, people were allied with certain peo
ple, and there was a lot of emotionalism and
people took things personally. A lot of people
got alienated.
" The board knows my mission and under
stands it," she asserts. "No politics. No ru
mors. No backstabbing. We don't always
argue policy, policy, policy."
As an example of this year's turnaround,
she cites that all key technical positions for
the spring show have been filled, positions
that normally are assigned in March. The hir
ing of next year's executive producer as well
as the establishment of the spring show selec

tion committee is also occurring this quarter,
which is earlier than usual. Movie nights,
parties and retreats have been expanded to
keep morale high. Service awards recognize
those who devote unacknowledged hours to
Ram's Head projects. A newsletter, known as
the Ram's Horn, keeps members up to date
on the group's activities. Actors now receive a
set of Ram's Head guidelines before every
production.
"There's no question Ram's Head is
stronger than it was one or two years ago,"
Wilson says without hesitation. Relations
with the Drama Department, once strained,
"are much better now," she says, mostly be
cause "we cleaned up our act." Proud of this
year's Gaieties, she argues it was better than
the previous two years' shows.
"It had sound problems," Wilson admits,
but she points out that "we never get on
Mem Aud stage until just before the show.
Until then we practice behind the Knoll in
trailers."
As for those former Ram's Head members
who have been disillusioned with their expe

rience, Wilson says that "I think they'd find it
a different organization. It's a totally different
bunch of people."
A Failed Winter One Act
When asked about the last-minute cancel
lation of one of the Winter One Acts this year,
Wilson groans, but is unafraid to discuss an
embarrassing situation that vividly illustrates
the thorny problems and conflicting person
alities that any dramatic production must
surmount.
"Cancelling One Acts is pathetic," says De-
Gusta. "This is a small, simple show, yet they
still couldn't keep it going or communication
flowing." lan McCrudden, director of 1991 's
acclaimed "Night Baseball" and member of
the Inside Outside acting troupe, says,"l
think that [the cancellation] is really shame
ful. Ultimately it's the failure of Ram's Head.
They committed to doing the show."
"Winter One Acts was not pleasant," Wil
son admits. According to Wilson, the writer
of the original play, "Yi-Chin," had some cre
ative differences, especially concerning the
ending, with the director. After some wran
gling, a compromise was achieved, and the
writer was to turn in the rewritten version be
fore winter break.
But the new script came in late. Just days

before opening night, the writer saw a re
hearsal and realized that the older version of
the play, one that he had rejected, was going
to be performed.
"We were embarrassed," said Wilson.
"The writer should have trust that his work
will be performed. The director was fired,
and we presented the option to the writer,
'We can pull the play or put in your ending
and you can direct it.' We wanted to see the
play done, but the writer said no, I can't do
this. We honored that. I couldn't make it
right with the writer but I honored his wish
es."
Wilson says that the director called her
earlier during discussions about the play, but
she said that such issues were best settled be
tween the producer of Winter One Acts, the
writer and the director, and that she, as exec
utive producer, should only step in if "it be
came an organizational problem." But by the
time the problem surfaced just days before its
first performance, any remedy was too little,
too late.
"! don't feel like the producer or I were
working with accurate information," Wilson
says, and she says she's unsure whether there
was much more she or the board could have
done to prevent the cancellation of the play.
Nevertheless, she says, "in another year it

would have been a crisis situation." And on a
side note, she adds that "the director of the
Winter One Act is a firosh and is still in Ram's
Head, and doing a great job in 'Guys and
Dolls/ 1 don't want to give the impression
that we kicked him out of the organization."
A "Hearty Animal"
Recovering from the trials and tribula
tions that have plagued its recent history,
Ram's Head members hope that this year's
spring show, "Guys and Dolls," may be just
the remedy that the tired organization needs.
"This is the time for the happy, upbeat
Broadway show," explains Duxbury, and her
sentiments are echoed by Wilson. The selec
tion of the show came down to a decision be
tween "Guys and Dolls" and another musi
cal, "Sweeney Todd," but Wilson says"l
wanted a happy musical."
As Ram's Head works through personnel
problems, cancelled shows and all the other
difficulties that disturb its daily existence,
members feel they can take heart from the
strength and resilience of their mascot — a
ram bearing the unlikely name of Turalura
Goldfarb.
Explains Andre, "Good year or bad year,
the Ram keeps on marching on. It's a hearty
animal." ■
In 1911, when tuition was still free, a
group of Stanford men planned a satiri
cal variety show to be performed before
the annual violence-prone Stanford-Califor
nia football game. They faced grim re
sources: there was no music department, no
drama department and the men's gymnasi
um was the only theatrical venue. But Stan
ford's appetite for student-run drama was
voracious, and the number of aspiring ac
tors, dancers, singers and writers could sus
tain several of the grandest stage produc
tions.
Adopting their name from a long-since
lost wall decoration, Ram's Head Theatrical
Society remains the largest and oldest stu
dent organization for drama on campus,
producing Big Game Gaieties, Spontaneous
Generation performances, Winter One Acts
and the jewel in their crown, the infamous
spring show. Now armed with venues such as
Memorial Auditorium, tutorials with drama
department mavens, a budget in the tens of
thousands of dollars and money stashed in
the bank, Ram's Head has weathered its share
of misadventures and flops.
Many say that the past few years have been
especially hard. A lack of artistic vision, tan
gled communications with the Drama De
partment, raging tempers, rumors and back
stabbing have plagued Ram's Head, and have
caused some to question whether Ram's
Head can continue to create high-caliber the
ater in an atmosphere of lean financial sup
port and small audiences.
A Close Bunch
Those familiar with the hours, frustration
and ennui associated with a major stage pro
duction know that working behind the
scenes breeds an inevitable familiarity.
"I've never worked so hard in my life and
been so happy with what I was doing," says
junior Alison Duxbury, who's been working
with Ram's Head since her freshman year and
is now a member of the Ram's Head board of
directors. Describing her stint as run crew
chief for "Cabaret," the spring show two years
ago, she says,"I would be yelling cues at night
in my sleep. 1 was constantly thinking about
it. My roommate thought I had gone nuts."
The hours spent working in close confines
with the same people, day after day, natural
ly lead to a close camaraderie among Ram's
Head members. But many of the organiza
tion's members say lately this closeness has
become more detrimental than beneficial.
The "techies" — those involved with tech
nical production such as lighting, stage man
agement and set crew — are one example of
how close people in Ram's Head can become.
Although the group represents a small frac
tion of the organization's 400-member ros
ter, their skilled labor and willingness to sac
rifice hours of their life make the "techies" in
dispensable to the organization's survival,
says Duxbury. Adds Dave Andre, a member
of last year's board of directors: "Ram's Head
has been described as a tight core of techies

surrounded by actors."
The closeknit nature of the troupe's core is
evidenced by rituals such as "Brenting" — a
rite named after previous Ram's Head mem
ber Brent Chism that involves meeting at the
Coffee House Wednesday nights — and a
code of "techie rules" that "cannot be di
vulged," says Melissa Wilson, the current ex
ecutive producer of the group. "They'd kill
me if 1 told you," she says with a laugh. She is
willing to divulge, however, that an unofficial
motto of the organization is "Ram's Head
will get you laid."
"I guess there's some truth to that. It can (
be an incestuous situation," she says, adding '
that "the retreat is known as the orgy ... and '
it was." i

However, this camaraderie can exclude
those who might bring a new perspective to
the organization, says Andrew Shakman.
Shakman, who graduated last year and is cur
rently at USC, was the assistant director of

"Into the Woods" in 1991 and the
producer of "Cabaret" a year later.
"Ram's Head is a somewhat in-

sular organization, and unfortu
nately they therefore have a hard
time bringing in new blood," i

Shakman says. "Actore are out
side the community. They
don't feel like it's their orga
nization."

"Ram's Head is a very in
bred organization," says ju- i
nior Gabe Tissian, writer k
of "Night Baseball," a M
Winter One Act that M
went on to win the New
York Playwright's Fes
tival Award last year.
"A small group runs it, and

there are a lot of power plays going on.
Because it's so small and so few peo-

pie have all the decision
making power, they're not re
sponsive to what the vast ma
jority of people want at Stan
ford"

Open auditions for shows are
a way to bring in new actors, but
because of the loyalties involved in
the casting of plays, "auditions
usually become much less than
open," Tissian adds.

Shakrnan says that he feels the or
ganization suffers from a lack of ener
gy because it is unable to bring in the
"new blood" it needs, and that this in
turn affects the enthusiasm for the
shows that the organization chooses to
produce.

"The [organization's] fundamental
weakness is that it churns out shows, not
because anyone wants to do them, but be
cause we need to do a show," he says. "There's
not a lot of heart and soul behind them."
As an example, Shakman cites "Cabaret"
as a successful show because of the number of
people who came together to work on it, de

spite the fact that the production lost a sig
nificant amount of money. Although Gai
eties usually brings in more than enough to
pay for any loss of money in the spring show,
"Cabaret" s $43,000 budget drained even
this coverage. "It was not a success financial- i
ly," Shakman says, "but we got 160 people j
working on the show. We've got to keep new i
people coming. Ram's Head has that inten- I
tion but it doesn't work," he says.
Michael DeGusta, a junior who managed <
Gaieties his freshman year and produced 1
"West Side Story" last year, echoes Shakman's <
sentiments. DeGusta says the main problems I
Ram's Head faces lie in a lack of concern for 1
producing good theater. "It doesn't seem to
be at the center," he says. "Just —

doing shows just

to do
shows is
not good
enough.

There's no
critical ex
amination
of, 'How can
we make this
a better

show?' "
DeGusta says that inept communication
and bickering have become such serious
problems that he hasn't worked in Ram's
Head this year, in part because he was tired of
dealing with same frustrations again and
again. He also claims there are a significant

number of former Ram's Head mem
bers who have left for similar reasons.
"For experienced people it's diffi
cult to do a good job within the cur
rent context," he says. "Ifl wanted to
design the spring show I'd like to
know the director was somewhat

knowledgeable. ..

I'd like to know the producer had an interest
in having my design implemented so that I
wouldn't he rowing the boat by myself. Also,
I don't like to learn from third-party sources
that someone didn't like my ideas."
DeGusta says that he has nothing against
inexperienced people. After all, he says,
"everyone starts that way." But some of Ram's
Head's fumblings have been

esp e -

ing, he
says. He
recounts
a story
where he
and a
friend
came dur
ing re
hearsal for
Gaieties
last

year
and saw that no
one had told the
all-frosh run
crew what their
responsibilities
were, though the
schedule had al
ready called for
dress rehearsal.
"No one
told them what
to do," DeGusta

says."The stage manager would call a cue 1
and they didn't know what to do. Then one of i
the set designers covered up the stage with a t
test sprayer in the middle of the stage. Every- 1
one was yelling at each other, one of the crew
members was crying and the crew was being i
called in to work from 3 p.m. to 1 a.m. with- 112
out a break. You just don't treat people like c
that." i
DeGusta says the board of directors <
should shoulder some of the blame. "Last t
year I don't know how many times the board
of directors argued whether the Ram's Head i
logo should go vertical or horizontal," he j
says. "There wasn't one thing that the board >
did that affected the course of Ram's Head,
whether in regard to relations with the drama I
department, or dealing with artistic issues. It t
needs focus and direction, and there isn't a |
desire to move forward. There's
no critical examina- I

'How

can we make this a
better show?' "

New Direction for the Ram?
In response to its critics, however, those
currently at the helm of Ram's Head ac
knowledge its past problems, but argue that
it has found a new sense of purpose that
stresses openness and communication
among its many members. "Ram's Head is

having more of an identity, more of a belong
ing," says Duxbury. "It's more of a communi
ty, a more cohesive group. If we keep people
happy then it has an identity."
Senior Stephanie Cawthon, another
member of the board of directors, said she
feels that the dynamics of the group are
changing for the better. "There's not a lot of
animosity," she said. "It's a cohesive group
and there's positive energy that hasn't been
there before."
This year, the energy seems to be stimulat
ing an organization which in recent times has
grown weary from the high intensity in
volved in producing ambitious productions.
"People in our organization burn out very
fast, but Gaieties didn't burn anybody out
this year," Cawthon observes. "If you see peo
ple coming back, that's good."
And while Cawthon recognizes that Ram's
Head is insular, she says that the closeness
criticized by so many of her peers is in
evitable in a drama organization. "When
you're involved with a show, you're involved
with the people in the show; when you're not,
you're not. People only know people within
the show," she says.
However, Cawthon admits that definite
changes could still be made. For example,
Cawthon feels that "Gaieties could be more
experimental than it is. Now, people are al
lowed to do Gaieties over and over again,"
she said. "It's ironic — we get excited when
we see new people coming in, but then we
don't utilize them."

Sophomore Akin Salawu said he
feels that Ram's Head's main problem
goes deeper than a lack of energy or a

dearth of new faces on the stage of
Memorial Auditorium. Instead, Salawu be
lieves Ram's Head is guilty of failing to exam
ine the type of shows that it produces.
"I wish Ram's Head wouLd do something
other than musicals. [It] would be an excel
lent group to do more plays because they
have the monev and they're fa-

mous," he says. Currently, the only
non-musicals Ram's Head does on
a yearly basis are the One Acts.
To address this perceived lack of stu-

dent drama at the University, Salawu
helped form Ergo, a "non-musical
theater group" for which "you don't
have to be able to sing and dance."
"Ram's Head does very well — it
makes theater fun, but we've managed to

do that too," he savs.
While Cawthon admits that the group
"could be more innovative" when it comes
to the selection of the spring show, she cau
tions that there are a number of reasons why
Ram's Head has always chosen a musical for
its final production of the year. For example,
as a student-run organization, Ram's Head is

ment, which tends to do non-musical pro

that, while non-musical drama can be found

no other musicals on campus.

body wants to see. "They don't tell us," she
explains, adding, "we can do almost any

Ram's Head may in fact benefit from the
competition of Salawu's new drama group,
Tissian says, since currently there is "no cap

should either be more open and diverse, or

tion's members say lately this closeness has
become more detrimental than beneficial.
The "techies" — those involved with tech
nical production such as lighting, stage man
agement and set crew — are one example of
how close people in Ram's Head can become.
Although the group represents a small frac
tion of the organization's 400-member ros
ter, their skilled labor and willingness to sac
rifice hours of their life make the "techies" in
dispensable to the organization's survival,
says Duxbury. Adds Dave Andre, a member
of last year's board of directors: "Ram's Head
has been described as a tight core of techies

surrounded by actors."
The closeknit nature of the troupe's core is
evidenced by rituals such as "Brenting" — a
rite named after previous Ram's Head mem
ber Brent Chism that involves meeting at the
Coffee House Wednesday nights — and a
code of "techie rules" that "cannot be di
vulged," says Melissa Wilson, the current ex
ecutive producer of the group. "They'd kill
me if 1 told you," she says with a laugh. She is
willing to divulge, however, that an unofficial
motto of the organization is "Ram's Head
will get you laid."
"I guess there's some truth to that. It can (
be an incestuous situation," she says, adding '
that "the retreat is known as the orgy ... and '
it was." i

However, this camaraderie can exclude
those who might bring a new perspective to
the organization, says Andrew Shakman.
Shakman, who graduated last year and is cur
rently at USC, was the assistant director of

"Into the Woods" in 1991 and the
producer of "Cabaret" a year later.
"Ram's Head is a somewhat in-

sular organization, and unfortu
nately they therefore have a hard
time bringing in new blood," i

Shakman says. "Actore are out
side the community. They
don't feel like it's their orga
nization."

"Ram's Head is a very in
bred organization," says ju- i
nior Gabe Tissian, writer k
of "Night Baseball," a M
Winter One Act that M
went on to win the New
York Playwright's Fes
tival Award last year.
"A small group runs it, and

there are a lot of power plays going on.
Because it's so small and so few peo-

pie have all the decision
making power, they're not re
sponsive to what the vast ma
jority of people want at Stan
ford"

Open auditions for shows are
a way to bring in new actors, but
because of the loyalties involved in
the casting of plays, "auditions
usually become much less than
open," Tissian adds.

Shakrnan says that he feels the or
ganization suffers from a lack of ener
gy because it is unable to bring in the
"new blood" it needs, and that this in
turn affects the enthusiasm for the
shows that the organization chooses to
produce.

"The [organization's] fundamental
weakness is that it churns out shows, not
because anyone wants to do them, but be
cause we need to do a show," he says. "There's
not a lot of heart and soul behind them."
As an example, Shakman cites "Cabaret"
as a successful show because of the number of
people who came together to work on it, de

spite the fact that the production lost a sig
nificant amount of money. Although Gai
eties usually brings in more than enough to
pay for any loss of money in the spring show,
"Cabaret" s $43,000 budget drained even
this coverage. "It was not a success financial- i
ly," Shakman says, "but we got 160 people j
working on the show. We've got to keep new i
people coming. Ram's Head has that inten- I
tion but it doesn't work," he says.
Michael DeGusta, a junior who managed <
Gaieties his freshman year and produced 1
"West Side Story" last year, echoes Shakman's <
sentiments. DeGusta says the main problems I
Ram's Head faces lie in a lack of concern for 1
producing good theater. "It doesn't seem to
be at the center," he says. "Just —

doing shows just

to do
shows is
not good
enough.

There's no
critical ex
amination
of, 'How can
we make this
a better

show?' "
DeGusta says that inept communication
and bickering have become such serious
problems that he hasn't worked in Ram's
Head this year, in part because he was tired of
dealing with same frustrations again and
again. He also claims there are a significant

number of former Ram's Head mem
bers who have left for similar reasons.
"For experienced people it's diffi
cult to do a good job within the cur
rent context," he says. "Ifl wanted to
design the spring show I'd like to
know the director was somewhat

knowledgeable. ..

I'd like to know the producer had an interest
in having my design implemented so that I
wouldn't he rowing the boat by myself. Also,
I don't like to learn from third-party sources
that someone didn't like my ideas."
DeGusta says that he has nothing against
inexperienced people. After all, he says,
"everyone starts that way." But some of Ram's
Head's fumblings have been

ing, he
says. He
recounts
a story
where he
and a

hearsal for

last

year
and saw that no
one had told the
all-frosh run
crew what their
responsibilities
were, though the
schedule had al
ready called for
dress rehearsal.
"No one
told them what
to do," DeGusta

says."The stage manager would call a cue 1
and they didn't know what to do. Then one of i
the set designers covered up the stage with a t
test sprayer in the middle of the stage. Every- 1
one was yelling at each other, one of the crew
members was crying and the crew was being i
called in to work from 3 p.m. to 1 a.m. with- 112
out a break. You just don't treat people like c
that." i
DeGusta says the board of directors <
should shoulder some of the blame. "Last t
year I don't know how many times the board
of directors argued whether the Ram's Head i
logo should go vertical or horizontal," he j
says. "There wasn't one thing that the board >
did that affected the course of Ram's Head,
whether in regard to relations with the drama I
department, or dealing with artistic issues. It t
needs focus and direction, and there isn't a |
desire to move forward. There's
no critical examina- I

'How

can we make this a
better show?' "

New Direction for the Ram?
In response to its critics, however, those
currently at the helm of Ram's Head ac
knowledge its past problems, but argue that
it has found a new sense of purpose that
stresses openness and communication
among its many members. "Ram's Head is

having more of an identity, more of a belong
ing," says Duxbury. "It's more of a communi
ty, a more cohesive group. If we keep people
happy then it has an identity."
Senior Stephanie Cawthon, another
member of the board of directors, said she
feels that the dynamics of the group are
changing for the better. "There's not a lot of
animosity," she said. "It's a cohesive group
and there's positive energy that hasn't been
there before."
This year, the energy seems to be stimulat
ing an organization which in recent times has
grown weary from the high intensity in
volved in producing ambitious productions.
"People in our organization burn out very
fast, but Gaieties didn't burn anybody out
this year," Cawthon observes. "If you see peo
ple coming back, that's good."
And while Cawthon recognizes that Ram's
Head is insular, she says that the closeness
criticized by so many of her peers is in
evitable in a drama organization. "When
you're involved with a show, you're involved
with the people in the show; when you're not,
you're not. People only know people within
the show," she says.
However, Cawthon admits that definite
changes could still be made. For example,
Cawthon feels that "Gaieties could be more
experimental than it is. Now, people are al
lowed to do Gaieties over and over again,"
she said. "It's ironic — we get excited when
we see new people coming in, but then we
don't utilize them."

Sophomore Akin Salawu said he
feels that Ram's Head's main problem
goes deeper than a lack of energy or a

dearth of new faces on the stage of
Memorial Auditorium. Instead, Salawu be
lieves Ram's Head is guilty of failing to exam
ine the type of shows that it produces.
"I wish Ram's Head wouLd do something
other than musicals. [It] would be an excel
lent group to do more plays because they
have the monev and they're fa-

mous," he says. Currently, the only
non-musicals Ram's Head does on
a yearly basis are the One Acts.
To address this perceived lack of stu-

dent drama at the University, Salawu
helped form Ergo, a "non-musical
theater group" for which "you don't
have to be able to sing and dance."
"Ram's Head does very well — it
makes theater fun, but we've managed to

do that too," he savs.
While Cawthon admits that the group
"could be more innovative" when it comes
to the selection of the spring show, she cau
tions that there are a number of reasons why
Ram's Head has always chosen a musical for
its final production of the year. For example,
as a student-run organization, Ram's Head is
forced to compete with the Drama Depart
ment, which tends to do non-musical pro
ductions.
"If we did serious drama, we would cut
out all those people who want to sing and
dance," Cawthon says. "A musical gets every
one on campus." Cawthon also points out
that, while non-musical drama can be found
through the Drama Department, there are

no other musicals on campus.
Cawthon says that Ram's Head "would
love to know" what kind of plays the student
body wants to see. "They don't tell us," she
explains, adding, "we can do almost any
thing."
Ram's Head may in fact benefit from the
competition of Salawu's new drama group,
Tissian says, since currently there is "no cap
italist incentive" for the group. "Ram's Head
should either be more open and diverse, or
there should be more student drama associa
tions," he advises.
Despite the organization's current prob
lems, supporters of Ram's Head believe there
is a brighter future for the group. "The
'Cabaret' year was the toughest we've ever
had," Cawthon says."From there we're build
ing back up. We're on a cycle — there has
been a downturn, but I do think there's an
upturn coming."
An E.P. With An Agenda
Executive producer Melissa Wilson, who
was elected last spring by the board of direc
tors, is more blunt. "We call 'Cabaret' the 'C'-
word," she says. "1 think everyone would
agree 'Cabaret' was the low point of Ram's
Head. It wasn't fun, and so interest dropped
away. The technical director went overboard
and every techie was burned out. It was ex
hausting. I swear 1 came down with chronic
fatigue syndrome with 'Cabaret.' It just bled
everyone."
Wilson has made a concerted effort to
change the way Ram's Head operates. She has
taken three goals to heart: accountability for
all members to both Ram's Head and parties
outside the group, such as Events and Ser
vices and the Drama Department; creating a
distinct identity for Ram's Head that's inclu
sive and open; and leadership visibility.
"Everyone knows me and can call me with
problems," she says. "Now producers of
shows say, 'Come to me if you have questions
or go to Melissa if you have a problem.' "
Wilson acknowledges that her agenda for
Ram's Head was born out of the numerous
problems that the group was mired in during
its previous years. "The Ram's Head I came to
was not a happy place," she says. "Writer and
directors vied for control in Gaieties. There
were some egos, and we had a board that had
a lot of egos. There was an sense of insanity
about it, but that's my perception. It's very
easy to be personally involved when you de
vote so much to a show. There were lines
drawn, people were allied with certain peo
ple, and there was a lot of emotionalism and
people took things personally. A lot of people
got alienated.
" The board knows my mission and under
stands it," she asserts. "No politics. No ru
mors. No backstabbing. We don't always
argue policy, policy, policy."
As an example of this year's turnaround,
she cites that all key technical positions for
the spring show have been filled, positions
that normally are assigned in March. The hir
ing of next year's executive producer as well
as the establishment of the spring show selec

tion committee is also occurring this quarter,
which is earlier than usual. Movie nights,
parties and retreats have been expanded to
keep morale high. Service awards recognize
those who devote unacknowledged hours to
Ram's Head projects. A newsletter, known as
the Ram's Horn, keeps members up to date
on the group's activities. Actors now receive a
set of Ram's Head guidelines before every
production.
"There's no question Ram's Head is
stronger than it was one or two years ago,"
Wilson says without hesitation. Relations
with the Drama Department, once strained,
"are much better now," she says, mostly be
cause "we cleaned up our act." Proud of this
year's Gaieties, she argues it was better than
the previous two years' shows.
"It had sound problems," Wilson admits,
but she points out that "we never get on
Mem Aud stage until just before the show.
Until then we practice behind the Knoll in
trailers."
As for those former Ram's Head members
who have been disillusioned with their expe

rience, Wilson says that "I think they'd find it
a different organization. It's a totally different
bunch of people."
A Failed Winter One Act
When asked about the last-minute cancel
lation of one of the Winter One Acts this year,
Wilson groans, but is unafraid to discuss an
embarrassing situation that vividly illustrates
the thorny problems and conflicting person
alities that any dramatic production must
surmount.
"Cancelling One Acts is pathetic," says De-
Gusta. "This is a small, simple show, yet they
still couldn't keep it going or communication
flowing." lan McCrudden, director of 1991 's
acclaimed "Night Baseball" and member of
the Inside Outside acting troupe, says,"l
think that [the cancellation] is really shame
ful. Ultimately it's the failure of Ram's Head.
They committed to doing the show."
"Winter One Acts was not pleasant," Wil
son admits. According to Wilson, the writer
of the original play, "Yi-Chin," had some cre
ative differences, especially concerning the
ending, with the director. After some wran
gling, a compromise was achieved, and the
writer was to turn in the rewritten version be
fore winter break.
But the new script came in late. Just days

before opening night, the writer saw a re
hearsal and realized that the older version of
the play, one that he had rejected, was going
to be performed.
"We were embarrassed," said Wilson.
"The writer should have trust that his work
will be performed. The director was fired,
and we presented the option to the writer,
'We can pull the play or put in your ending
and you can direct it.' We wanted to see the
play done, but the writer said no, I can't do
this. We honored that. I couldn't make it
right with the writer but I honored his wish
es."
Wilson says that the director called her
earlier during discussions about the play, but
she said that such issues were best settled be
tween the producer of Winter One Acts, the
writer and the director, and that she, as exec
utive producer, should only step in if "it be
came an organizational problem." But by the
time the problem surfaced just days before its
first performance, any remedy was too little,
too late.
"! don't feel like the producer or I were
working with accurate information," Wilson
says, and she says she's unsure whether there
was much more she or the board could have
done to prevent the cancellation of the play.
Nevertheless, she says, "in another year it

would have been a crisis situation." And on a
side note, she adds that "the director of the
Winter One Act is a firosh and is still in Ram's
Head, and doing a great job in 'Guys and
Dolls/ 1 don't want to give the impression
that we kicked him out of the organization."
A "Hearty Animal"
Recovering from the trials and tribula
tions that have plagued its recent history,
Ram's Head members hope that this year's
spring show, "Guys and Dolls," may be just
the remedy that the tired organization needs.
"This is the time for the happy, upbeat
Broadway show," explains Duxbury, and her
sentiments are echoed by Wilson. The selec
tion of the show came down to a decision be
tween "Guys and Dolls" and another musi
cal, "Sweeney Todd," but Wilson says"l
wanted a happy musical."
As Ram's Head works through personnel
problems, cancelled shows and all the other
difficulties that disturb its daily existence,
members feel they can take heart from the
strength and resilience of their mascot — a
ram bearing the unlikely name of Turalura
Goldfarb.
Explains Andre, "Good year or bad year,
the Ram keeps on marching on. It's a hearty
animal." ■
