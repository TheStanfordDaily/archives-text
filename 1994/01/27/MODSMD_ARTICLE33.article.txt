# An innocent man
## Day-Lewis a bright spot in Sheridan's 'Name of the Father' 
### 
A politically charged tale of one man's
struggle against an abusive police state and
government whitewash, "In the Name of the
Father" relies on a compelling story that
crosses several genres. However, the movie is
so concerned with grabbing you by your
emotional lapels and shaking you around
that it feels as though you're watching a suc
cession of orchestrated scenes rather than
gaining deeper access into a man's terribly
transformed life.
Based on the book "Proved Innocent" by
Gerry Conlon, the film begins by presenting

a young Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis), a
Belfast kid who could care less about politics
or the "Irish question" or his conservative fa
ther fretting about his shiftless ways. Sent to
London by his parents, supposedly to shape
up, Conlon finds himself thrown into a
ghastly interrogation room where he's
forced to confess to a horrific IRA bombing
of a British pub. Under the guise of a ludi
crous Prevention of Terrorism Act — which
allowed the police to detain suspects for
seven days without charges — Conlon be
comes the victim of a panicked British jus

tice system looking to calm a terrified public.
Director Jim Sheridan's hand lies firmly
within the pedestrian Hollywood school,
which is most evident in occasional scenes
that evoke "L.A. Law" courtroom drama and
ABC movies dealing with father-son recon
ciliation. The film's most intense moments
burst from its first few minutes as Conlon
flees from assault rifle-toting British soldiers
in a bombed-out Belfast (to the strains of
Jimi Hendrix's "Voodoo Child") only to
meet a band of ticked-off IRA partisans
nearly discovered by the chase. After the
opening's over, however, the remainder of
the films collapses into a torpid state and
never fully revives.
The film tries to squeeze dramatic juice
from a series of melodramatic legal scenes
and conversations with tough IRA thugs or
prisoners, but all of them seem to possess an
air of flimsy superficiality — the characters
arc sketchily drawn and the direction overly
scripted. The screenplay seems exactly what
it is: a snatch here and there of disjointed
scenes from Conlon's book that travel from
emotional highs to lows, stopping for mo
ments of comic relief that seem selfcon
sciously placed, without telling us more
about Gerry Conlon or his father, Guiseppe.
Though does an able job of
being the wannabe hippie who doesn't give
a crap about anything besides free love and
drugs, launching into emotional tirades
with frothy spontaneity, by the end of the
film he's still nebulous and ill-defined —
though perhaps more grim-faced and polit
ically informed. Pete Postlethwaite, as his

long-suffering father, wears his fatigue on a
sad Irish mug, hut ultimately he's no more
than a collection of unstained character
virtues: patience, fatigue and a belief that
righteousness will prevail.
The film's most engrossing conflict aris
es when Conlon is imprisoned with his fa
ther and must choose between his father's
pacifist ways or the steely resistance of the
IRA terrorist who masterminded the pub
bombing.
Unfortunately, Sheridan only outlines the
conflict: we see two warm-hearted father fig
ures — one obviously a sickly saint, the
other virile but seemingly violent without
reason — and not much more than that.
Rather than deepening the tension between
these two forces that pull at Gerry Conlon,
exploring their subtleties or highlighting
their temptations, Sheridan causes it to sud
denly evaporate in a single melodramatic
scene.
From then on, with its most arresting
conflict gone, Gerry Conlon's legal battles to
free himself become the only dramatic issue,
leaving the film to limp toward its end. Here
Sheridan shifts his direction into standard
courtroom fare, allowing for typically im
passioned oratory from Emma Thompson,
who plays Conlon's barrister. Instead of
showing us the transformative power of vio
lence — both in the hands of the state, and
those claiming to represent "the people" —
we are treated to a Perry Mason-like ending
that ignores how violence can totally and
tragically alter a man's life.
