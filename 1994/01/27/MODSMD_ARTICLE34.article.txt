"Blink" has the same appeal as that of a
good formula detective novel, with a slight
twist, of course.
Madeline Stowe ("Short Cuts," "The Last of
the Mohicans") plays Emma Brody, a blind
woman who receives a corneal transplant and
regains the sight she lost as a young girl. Emma
is not your usual frail blind woman — a fid
dler in an Irish band who lives by herself, she is
refreshingly independent, foul-mouthed and
bad-tempered. After she becomes the key wit
ness in a murder investigation, detective John
Hallstrom ("Benny and Joon" 's Aidan

Quinn) — surprise,
surprise — can't help
himself from reluc
tantly falling in love
with her.
Despite the pre
dictability of the out
come, it is fun to see
these two get to know
each other.
The scriptwriter
hinges the plot on a
little-known medical
phenomenon dubbed
"retroactive halluci
nation," where recipi
ents of such trans-

plants don't register images until many
hours after their new eyes have "seen" them.
In order to show Emma's new vision, direc
tor Michael Apted ("Coal Miner's Daugh
ter," "Gorillas in the Mist") used special lens
es and computer animation to distort the
images seen from Emma's point of view. At
first, the result is a grotesque, disorienting
world complete with hallucinations that
cause her to question her sanity.
For example, Emma believes she saw her
neighbor's murderer leave the apartment
building, but with her confusing new sight,
she can't be sure whether the man was real or
imagined.
As John comes to believe her story, it be
comes obvious that she is being stalked by the
killer. As in "Jacob's Ladder," part of the sus
pense is what the protagonist will see next,
and whether it is really occurring or merely a
frightening hallucination.
As Apted's first pure thriller, "Blink" pos
sesses all the requisite components of a good
formula flick, however, the list of suspects
known to the audience is glaringly short,
making the mystery somewhat less com
pelling. "Blink" is less about tracking down a
killer than one woman's struggle to live her
life on her own terms, and a man's resistance
to love. Emma's blindness is just the catch.
Fortunately, the two lead characters arc
engaging enough to make this gimmicky
story rise above the standard I lollywood fare.
