It's not often that a preview captures the
whole movie and more. But with "Intersec
tion," a new flick starring Sharon Stone and
Richard Gere, glimpsing the preview costs
the viewer almost nothing — only the aston
ishing sight of watching Stone play a fairly
good, if somewhat ambitious, human being.
"Intersection" is fundamentally a movie
about a choice — the successful architect
Vincent Eastman (Gere) must decide be
tween his success-oriented wife (Stone) and
his caring upbeat lover Olivia (Lolita Davi
dovich) before he gets into a brutal car acci
dent.
Eastman's need to decide his future is rein
forced by his daily office encounters with the
wife from whom he is separated, and lying in
the middle of this decision is the talented
daughter of his marriage.
However, because the first scene includes
the beginning of a car accident, it is unclear
whether Eastman has a premonition of his
fate or if the filmmakers are just being
screwy.
Gere's pondering pose fills the screen
many times over. There's the "I'm not sure
what to do" shot from the left and the"I just
can't decide, I'm in agony" shot from the
right as well as a plethora of others from
every which way. The best parts of the movie

are the flashbacks that Eastman has about his
relationships with the women he loves.
Gere's portrayal evolves into that of a man
who is hard to like, although easy to under
stand.
Merits of the movie include a solid perfor
mance by perky Davidovich who does a good
job at snatching the audience's sympathies.
Also, there is an entertaining characteriza
tion of social-climbing Mrs. Eastman and her
WASP-y family; and contrary to what one
might expect from a Sharon Stone film, there
weren't any vulgar sex scenes.
Overall, one can't deny that there were a
lot of good shots of a quite handsome cast
and one cute car. This movie had the poten
tial to be good and has been lessened only by
corny scenes and poorly delivered lines.
Rather than crossing this "Intersection," fol
low "Cable Way."
