# Sister With a Voice
## NdegéOcello's stunning 'Lullabies' not meant for bedtime 
### 
First, you take a 24-year-old sister —
young, gifted, black and gay — with a mad
deningly sensual voice and a penchant for de
constructing the colonized mind. Next, you
introduce her to funk, hook her up with
Madonna's Maverick recording label and
Warner Bros, distribution, and set her
demons free. What do you get?
As her former manager Greg Tate aptly
puts it, you get "The Future of the Funk."
Me' Shell Ndcg£Ocello is her name and
"broken-hearted revolutionary love songs"
arc her main game. Born in Berlin and raised
in our very own brown skin capital D.C.,
Me' Shell's lyrics are as dcliciously contradic
tory and complex as her own auspicious be
ginnings imply.
In her debut solo album "Plantation Lul
labies," Me' Shell Firmly establishes herself as
a funkmastcr. A former Howard music
major, she plays the piano, keyboards, guitar,
bass, programs drums and does her own
background vocals.
She also writes all of her songs, taking the
term one woman show to its outer limits. On
"Plantation Lullabies," Ndeg£Ocello tackles
everything from capitalism and the projects,
to beauty standards and black male / female
relationships.
A woman truly dedicated to thuggin'
against the system, Me' Shell never takes the
easy way out. In a track called "Shoot'n Up
and Gett'n High," she signifies on the alien
ation and the social decay that create the con
ditions ripe for drug abuse. And unlike hip
hop contemporary Tupac Shakur who —
when forced to contemplate "why we're
crazy" — can only "blame [his] mother for
turning his brother into a crack baby,"
Me' Shell thankfully looks for deeper, sys
temic causes.
She croons, "He lives about three train
stops away / it's a train ride away from heav

en / signified by politics, low-income hous
ing, birth control, and abortion / The capi
talistic hand around my throat / shoot'n up
dope just to cope / in this dehumanizing so
ciety, we both found Clod when he OD'd."
The woman is deep.
And no subject escapes her relentless
scrutiny. In another track, entitled "Soul On
Ice," Me' Shell challenges black men for buy
ing into a white standard of beauty, or, in her
words, their desire for "snow-white passion
without the hot comb." Fortunately for us,
this song contains no "Cave Bitch" antics a la
Ice Cube.
Instead, with lines like, "brotha, brotha,
are you suffering from a social infection / a
misdirection / excuse me but does your
white woman go better with your Brooks
Brothers suit?" and"I am a reflection ofyou /
black and b1ue....," Me' Shell does much bet
ter than simply rant at white women. She
puts the onus where it belongs — on black
folks to start recognizing one another.
The whole album is very carefully engi
neered to fit NdegeOcello's artistic vision.
Down to the album cover, which Warner
Bros, told her to change, saying that black au
diences wouldn't be able to relate to its ab
stract images. She fought, however, telling
them straight up that "black people are the
creators and founders of abstract."
You go girl.
The fight was definitely worth it. The
cover alone is an experience. Inset in the CD
cover is the almost subliminal message, "Al
ternative Hiphop... is Dead Silence."
On the inside cover, pal Tate drops the sci
ence on hip-hop, part of which reads,
Hip-hop is the inverse of capitalism
Hip-hop is the reverse of colonialism
Hip-hop is the world the slaveholder made,
sent into niggafide future shock. ..
Deal with it.

The songs are bold, daring, and above all,
funky. There arc love songs about men. There
are love songs sung to women. In one song,
she encourages the audience to step into the
projects where she found love. In another.

she taunts listeners with tales of infidelity.
Rigid categories will never confine her.
Me' Shell is a real Sister With a Voice and she's
going for hers.
