# "Too High to Die" Meat Puppets

### 
"Too High to Die" is the latest chapter in
the long history of the Meat Puppets, a hand
founded by brothers Curt and Cris Kirkwood
with Derrick Bostrom in Tempe, Ariz, in 1982.
They quickly became famous in under
ground circles as the first "cowpunk" band,
combining Southwestern country with the
kind of hard-core punk that makes you want
to beat up brick walls. Since then, their music
has mellowed dramatically and become much

more melodic.
While the Meat
Puppets are un
known to many,
their influence is
widespread. They
Might Be Giants rev
erently play a cover
of "Whirlpool" from
"Forbidden Places."
After the Puppets
toured with Nirvana,
the Kirkwood broth-

ers played support on the Seattle groups
"MTV Unplugged" appearance.
"Too High to Die" is an excellent assort
ment of 13 new Meat Puppets songs. They
consist of clean guitar-driven rock ranging
from head-banging riffs to acoustic ballads,
colored with a tinge of country.
The album opens with "Violet Eyes," a great
song driven by a fast Pearl Jam-like guitar riff
Songs like "We Don't Exist" and "Elaming
Heart" show the characteristic Puppets sound
with catchy, Byrds-like harmonies, strange
lyrics and driving, echoing guitars.
Most of the songs on the album are in this
vein, plus several semi-acoustic songs. Ex
ceptions include the psychedelic "Never to Be
Found," the bluesy "Roof With a Hole" and
the obligatory country shuffle, "Comin'
Down." There is also an unlisted track, an
acoustic remake of "l.ake of Fire," with a
singer who sounds suspiciously like Kurt
Cobain.
The Meat Puppets have produced another
winner. Go see them when they come to town
— this band is at the root of much of today's
music.
