# "Enter the Wu-Tang" Wu-Tang Clan
## 
### 
Straight from conservative stronghold
Staten Island comes — surprisingly — one of
the hottest new underground hip-hop
groups today: the Wu-Tang Clan.
Prince Rakcem "The Rza," The Method
Man, U-God, Rebel Ins, Shallah Raekwon,
Ghost Face Killer, Ol' Dirty Bastard and The
Genius "The Gza" hail from the Shaolin pro
jects where drive-by shootings, high unem
ployment and abject poverty are common
place. In their debut release "Enter The Wu-
Tang: 36 Chambers," this motley crew of rap
mayhem have channeled their experiences
and energies to wage war against sucker
MC's, trading Tech Nine "spray" for decapi
tating lyrics and beats.
"Bring I)a Ruckus," the album's first cut,
warns that a devastating rhythmical force is
preparing to carve a place for itself in the
world of hip-hop and the beatdown is gonna
make "Mortal Kombat" look like child's play.
Full of simple drum beats and catchy hooks,
"Ruckus" accentuates the posse's collage of

rap styles that, together, sound like a freestyle
battle about to turn into a lyrical riot.
Eschewing the Black-on-Black Love
theme that mainstream African-American
leaders preach to their constituents, "Shame
on a Nigga" chides rival emcees who want to
play petty games with the hardest hip-hop
pers on the scene. These second-rate adver
saries are threatened with musical execution
if they mess with the Clan.
The group takes-five long enough to let
member The Method Man catch wreck on a
solo effort. On "Method Man" this lyrical
master's signature flow weaves its way over
and around a hodge-podge of break beats
and riffs, warning would-be contenders to
stay clear of him and his homies or face the
consequences.
The Wu-Tang Clan is another talented
group contributing to the immortality of the
Hip-Hop Nation. This collection of con
frontational and danceable tracks is sure to
be popular on the street as well as the clubs.
Sucker MC's better protect their necks from
the slashing Shaolin lyrics of these ghetto
bastards.
