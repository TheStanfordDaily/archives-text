# "The Quiet Revolution" Ronny Jordan

### 
Categories. I'm the type of person who
likes to categorize things, and putting music
into neat little boxes, in most cases, is a rela
tively easy thing to do. But "The Quiet Revo
lution," Ronny Jordan's latest album, presents
a dilemma. If variety is the spice of life, then
his album is a necessity for anyone's cupboard.
"The Quiet Revolution" is indeed a revolu
tion. On top of Jordan's astounding guitar
performance, there are SWV-ish (Jade, Mary
J. Blige, etc.), rap and spoken word vocals,
drum programming (with a little Miami
styled bass) and even some scratching. For a
contemporary jazz artist, Ronny Jordan has
broken new ground. Voted best musician by
Blues & Soul Magazine and College Radio
Japan, Jordan is a worldwide phenomenon.
"Revolution" opens with "Season For

Change," a track in which fellow jazz / rap fu
sionist Guru returns Jordan's favor (although
his uncommonly weak lyrics do not return the
favor in full) by laying down the vocals. The
experimental nature of the first track sets the
stage for the rest of the album.
The variety of "The Quiet Revolution" is
refreshing. No two songs are alike. And it sat
isfies jazz aficionados, R&B enthusiasts and
everyone in between. "The Jackal" (by far the
album's best track) even got me to appreciate
the art of spoken word (even though my clos
est encounter with it was an unsavory episode
of "MTV Unplugged").
Like the Digable Planets' "Reachin' (A New
Refutation of Time and Space)," Jordan's "The
Quiet Revolution" fits no one category. It's an
innovative combination of modern black
music forms — jazz, rap, funk, etc — that
runs circles around the more traditional offer
ings of pop radio. Kudos go out to Ronny Jor
dan for putting some variety on the market.
