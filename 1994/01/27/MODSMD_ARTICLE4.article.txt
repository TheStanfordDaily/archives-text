# Writing requirement needs revision, coordinators say
## 
### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Although all freshmen are required to
take at least one quarter of English, coor
dinators of the Writing and Critical
Thinking program say that Stanford stu
dents are still not writing enough.
Some Stanford freshmen, however,
feel they are already writing too much.
Their complaints come at a time when
the Commission on Undergraduate F'du
cation hasjust begun to examine the Uni
versity's writing requirement in greater
depth. Though the commission is months
away from making any changes to Stan

ford's educational system, freshman Eng
lish professors already have some sugges
tions for how their program could be im
proved.
"If I had my druthers, I would have
everyone take two quarters of freshman

English, and. even a third in the junior
year," said English Prof. Joyce Moser,
who serves as associate director of the re
cently renamed Writing and Critical
Thinking program. "The more you write,
the better you get at it."
These suggestions are in keeping with
the goals of the freshman English pro
gram .
"We are here to help students improve
their skills in speaking and writing. The
current requirement satisfies, but 1 would
like to see more," said English Prof. Ken
neth Fields, the director of the program.
As the requirement stands now, all
freshmen must take at least one quarter

of a class specifically designated for the
program. Those who scored a four or five
on a high school Advanced Placement
English examination are exempt from
further classes; the rest of their class
mates are required to take another quar
ter.
But high scores on an AP exam do not
necessarily mean a student is well pre
pared to write at a college level, Moser
said.
"Getting a four or five is not proof that
you have had a strong high school back
ground," she said.
Moser, who teaches classes in the pro
gram, said that the difference between

students who have low scores and those
who have high scores is frequently not
very significant.
"Everyone who gets in here is smart.
Some people have had more experience
than others, but they pick it up fast," she
said.
A more stringent requirement would
be beneficial because students need to
keep up the momentum of writing in
order to continue doing it well, Moser
added.
Writing and Critical Thinking "is in-

tense — you write something,
and get it back — you get into the
rhythm of thinking of yourself as
a writer. If you stop, you can lose
some of that," she said.
The experience gained from
the act of writing is important no
matter how proficient the person
is, said English Prof. Bliss
Carnochan, who taught a section
in the program last year.
"I don't care if you're a fresh
man or have written five books —
everyone revises and revises," he
said. "How do you do that in one
quarter?"
But, while their professors
envision an expanded version of
Writing and Critical Thinking,
many freshmen currently in the
program think that even one
quarter is too much.
"Freshman English is a little
redundant," said freshman liana
Weiner. "(The professor] says,
'I'm going to teach you how to
write a thesis paper,' and I'm
thinking, 'I wrote a thesis paper
sophomore year in high school.' "
Despite the redundancy,
Weiner said she enjoys her

English class and believes that
writing is important. But she
feels that, at least in her case,
"one quarter is sufficient to give
you a nice basis."
Some freshmen, however, say
they feel that the program as it
stands now is not necessary at
all.
"It probably helps, but I think
you can get (those skillsl in any
class where you have to write
papers," said freshman Charlie
Page.
Most upperclassmen, though,
are generally supportive of the
program. A poll conducted by
The Daily last quarter found that
53.6 percent of the upperclass
men polled thought that fresh
man English should at least be
kept the same, and 18.5 percent
felt that the program should be
expanded.
"I'd say that's pretty strong
feedback" in support of the pro
gram, Fields said.
Some upperclassmen agree
with Moser's assessment that
freshman English is important
because of the writing experi
ence. "I don't know if I learned a
lot, but I practiced writing, and
that helps," said senior Manuel
Mejia.
An electrical engineering

major, Mejia said he does not get
a real opportunity to write in any
of the classes required for his
major — a situation which is not
uncommon in a university where
so many students go into the sci
ences. While students who ulti
mately go into writing-oriented
majors may get plenty of writing
experience in their Stanford
careers, freshman English may
be the last chance for many sci
ence majors to practice their
composition skills.
"It's clear that in a great
many majors, students are not
asked to write until their thesis,"
said Fields. "Then professors
complain their students are not
writing well."
To address this problem, the
School of Engineering has a
Technical Communications Pro
gram to help students learn the
professional writing skills they
will need as they go into engi
neering careers. Instituted in
1976 as a peer tutoring program,
it now uses graduate students
from language-oriented depart
ments to help students write lab
oratory reports or dissertations.
The electives offered by the
program are designed to "give
students practical experience
they will need as professionals,"

said David Lougee, a lecturer in
the School of Engineering and
the head of the program. As a
result, although the program
may build on writing skills that
students have learned in their
earlier writing classes, "things
are stressed in I technical) writ
ing that don't get analyzed in
freshman English," he said.
Writing may be required more
often of non-engineering majors.
But to ensure that these stu
dents are attentive to their writ
ing even after they finish their
freshman requirements, the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences employs a program called
Writing Across the Curriculum,
which builds on the skills that
students learn in their freshman
English classes.
The interdisciplinary program
— which includes the Physics
and Biology Departments as well
as less-technical majors like psy
chology — uses pre-existing,
writing-oriented courses to allow
students to hone their writing
skills and "apply them in subse
quent work," said Claude
Reichard, a lecturer in the
English Department and a con
sultant to the writing program.
The program "emphasizes try
ing to work revision into assign

ments so students are writing
throughout the quarter,"
Reichard said.
The various components of
the Writing and Critical Think
ing program will all be consid
ered as the Commission on
Undergraduate Education's sub
committee to examine the writ

ing requirement begins its work.
Last week, History Prof.
James Sheehan, the chair of the
commission, told the Faculty
Senate that the subcommittee
will join forces with the School of
Humanities and Sciences, which
is currently conducting a regular
review of the program.
