# Writing requirement needs revision, coordinators say

### Sarah Katz Staff writer 
Although all freshmen are required to
take at least one quarter of English, coor
dinators of the Writing and Critical
Thinking program say that Stanford stu
dents are still not writing enough.
Some Stanford freshmen, however,
feel they are already writing too much.
Their complaints come at a time when
the Commission on Undergraduate F'du
cation hasjust begun to examine the Uni
versity's writing requirement in greater
depth. Though the commission is months
away from making any changes to Stan

ford's educational system, freshman Eng
lish professors already have some sugges
tions for how their program could be im
proved.
"If I had my druthers, I would have
everyone take two quarters of freshman

English, and. even a third in the junior
year," said English Prof. Joyce Moser,
who serves as associate director of the re
cently renamed Writing and Critical
Thinking program. "The more you write,
the better you get at it."
These suggestions are in keeping with
the goals of the freshman English pro
gram .
"We are here to help students improve
their skills in speaking and writing. The
current requirement satisfies, but 1 would
like to see more," said English Prof. Ken
neth Fields, the director of the program.
As the requirement stands now, all
freshmen must take at least one quarter

of a class specifically designated for the
program. Those who scored a four or five
on a high school Advanced Placement
English examination are exempt from
further classes; the rest of their class
mates are required to take another quar
ter.
But high scores on an AP exam do not
necessarily mean a student is well pre
pared to write at a college level, Moser
said.
"Getting a four or five is not proof that
you have had a strong high school back
ground," she said.
Moser, who teaches classes in the pro
gram, said that the difference between

students who have low scores and those
who have high scores is frequently not
very significant.
"Everyone who gets in here is smart.
Some people have had more experience
than others, but they pick it up fast," she
said.
A more stringent requirement would
be beneficial because students need to
keep up the momentum of writing in
order to continue doing it well, Moser
added.
