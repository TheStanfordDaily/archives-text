# "Dead Air" Heatmiser
## 
### 
Launch into 1994 with one of 1993 s most
intriguing albums, Heatmiser's "Dead Air."
Although currently known only on the small
club scene, Heatmiser has the potential to be
come a popular band among young Ameri
can rockers.
The first and best song, "Still," has the po
tential to be a slacker anthem. I,ead singer Neil
Gust expresses the wish to have a less compli
cated life "and not move... and not think." He
later dabbles in the metaphysical, proclaiming,
"1 don't want to be here in my body." This is a
clear indication of the Heatmiser's advanced
thinking skills; one of the members (bassist El
liot Smith) is an Oberlin College graduate.
Such philosophical thinking continues as
Gust sings "Can't Be Touched," a song that ex
presses disillusionment with reality.

But overall, the band Heatmiser most
closely resembles is Fugazi. Gust's singing,
accentuated by frequent rises and falls, is
much like Fugazi lead singer lan McKaye's in
style. Though Gust's choirboy voice isn't as
harsh as McKaye's, he uses it the same way,
especially on "Dirt."
Although the lyrics on some songs are in
teresting, most of them are barely dis
cernible; they normally get drowned out by
the band's choppy guitar style. This sound is
their most notable facet. It sounds as if the
guitar is sending a series of melodic Morse
code messages, with continuous short, yet
distinct, pauses between chords. Although
this music is not fluid, there is a sense of com
pleteness to the songs, as if a higher being de
termined that they should be played that way.
Maybe one day Heatmiser will discover
the solution to popularity. Gust dying his
hair purple is definitely a positive career
move for a band with a lot of potential.
