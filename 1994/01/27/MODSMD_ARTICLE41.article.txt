Blue
Incredible sound design and art di
rection make "Blue" a unique visual
audio experience But the story be
longs only to Juliette Binoche, who
provides a perfect portrayal of a
woman in pain, attempting to achieve
self-liberation by cutting herself off
from emotion. "Blue" is a rarity — an
accessible, engaging work of art. R
Heaven and Earth
Oliver Stone s latest brilliant creation
— the true story of a Vietnamese
woman who worked for the Vietcong
before violence turned her away —
stands out among Vietnam films be
cause of its emphasis on the Viet
namese perspective. Newcomer
Hiep The Le and veteran Tommy Lee
Jones deliver poignant performances
which reflect the pain and terror of
their characters' lives R
Mrs. Doubtfire
Without Robin Williams, this film
would be just another boy-dresses
as-girl-flick He carries it just a notch
into the land of almost-innovative

entertainment — with a serious
message hidden just below the sur
face. With adequate support from
the rest of the cast, Williams' flick
deals with parenthood and divorce
while always keeping one hand on
the funny bone. PG-13
Naked
An experience that could, at best, be
called painful, Mike Leigh's latest
takes the worst view of male-female
relations and pushes it to an ex
teme. With the story of a drifter who
sexually and emotionally abuses
women, Leigh suggests that all
women are masochists through an
overtly misogynistic film. UNRATED
The Pelican Brief
Picture Julia Roberts. She could al
most pass for your average law stu
dent — the kind who uncovers the
devious conspiracy behind the
deaths of two Supreme Court jus
tices. But this premise is no more
believable in Alan J. Pakula's film
than it is in John Grisham's best
selling novel. No one can accuse

Pakula of original ideas; every scene
of the movie is lifted verbatim from
the novel. Instead of watching the
"Great Julia Roberts Comeback,"
order a "Mystic Pizza." PG-13
Philadelphia
The first major industry film about
AIDS, "Philadelphia" does not deny
the existence of either gay men or
homophobes. Instead it places
polar opposites in close proximity,
watching their reactions while not
whitewashing their differences.
Bringing Denzel Washington and
Tom Hanks together and exposing
homophobia to public scrutiny lift
the film above the level of mere PC
rhetoric. PG-13
Schindler's List
The haunting images of Steven
Spielberg's "Schindler's List" over
come the film's characters, leaving
moments more important than peo
ple. The story of German entepre
neur Oskar Schindler and the more
than 1,100 Jews he saves leads to
an examination of the many faces of

evil. With indelible pictures of death
and degradation, "Schindler's List"
captures the truth of more than six
million murders R
Shadowlands
Capturing the contradictory nature
of C.S. Lewis, a famous scholar who
lives in seclusion and a children's
author who knows no children, is
the task of Anthony Hopkins. "Shad
owlands" is the tale of what happens
to Lewis' sedate life with the en
trance of loud-mouthed poet Joy
Gresham. Ultimately a standard love
story, "Shadowlands" does find a bit
of musty magic along the way. PG
The Summer House
A kind of working-class "A Room
With a View," "The Summer House"
warms your heart with its tale of a
distressed English girl engaged to
marry an annoying, unpleasant
man. Although the story starts out
awkward and cliched, it eventually
becomes an interesting, multi-di
mensional tale about love and free
choice. UNRATED
