The timeless tale of love and seduction, Andrew Lloyd
Webber's "The Phantom of the Opera," has been in San Fran
cisco for a while, and the good news is that the production
will be hanging around a few months longer. The show has
been extended through August at the Curran Theatre, 445
Geary St., San Francisco. Tickets are available through all
BASS ticket outlets or by phone at 776-1999.
