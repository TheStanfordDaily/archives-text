# Reasons to rent...

### 
In 1958, Alfred Hitchcock re
leased "Vertigo," cited by critics as
his masterwork. However, the fol
lowing year he directed a film that
for pure charm and class ranks by
itself in Hitchcock's pantheon.
"North by Northwest" has sev
eral small flaws — for example,
Cary Grant's mother is played by

an actress four years
younger than Grant him
self. But the irresistible per-

formances of Grant, James Mason
and lesse Royce Landis, as well as
Hitchcock's directorial skills,
transform what could have been a
mere delightful jaunt into a seri
ous message about the insecurity
of any man's identity. Bernard
Herrman's memorable, cliff
hanging score doesn't hurt, either.

Furthermore, "North by North
west" contains many small scenes
and miscues that are sure to he ap
preciated by the intense Hitchcock
fan. Look for the director's manda
tory cameo appearance (in the
opening credits), as well as the re
action of the small boy in the
Mount Rushmore cafeteria scene.
Go rent "North by North
west," young man.
