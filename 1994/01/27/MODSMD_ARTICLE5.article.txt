# From press room to comedy circuit
## Fitzwater flays past and present politicos 
### Josh Green Staff writer 
It wasn't the White House
press room â€” no fancy presiden
tial seal, no clicking cameras, no
screaming reporters.
But Marlin Fitzwater was no
fish out of water in Cubberley Au
ditorium last night when he ran
smoothly through a speech that
had the audience of about '250
laughing all the way.
Fitzwater displayed a candor
and sense of humor that he often
could not publicly express in his
10 years of serving as White
House press secretary under
Presidents George Bush and
Ronald Reagan.
Starting off with a steady
stream of jokes and anecdotes,
Fitzwater made it clear he
wouldn't hold anything back
when he talked about the Republi

Four: If you have an affair, what
ever you do, don't tell Arkansas
state troopers about it.
"You have to have a thick skin
and a thin mind," Fitzwater said.
Fitzwater even took shots at
former Clinton press secretary
George Stephanopoulos, pointing
out that TV had not been kind to
him because he "looks like he's
15."
"Some people say George
Stephanopoulos did more for my
reputation than George Bush,"
Fitzwater quipped.
Fitzwater conceded that
Stephanopoulos was sharp and
beat him in the six months of pres
idential campaigning.
"I would wake up in the morn
