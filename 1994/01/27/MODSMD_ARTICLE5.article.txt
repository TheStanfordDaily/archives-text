# From press room to comedy circuit
## Fitzwater flays past and present politicos 
### Josh Green Staff writer 
It wasn't the White House
press room — no fancy presiden
tial seal, no clicking cameras, no
screaming reporters.
But Marlin Fitzwater was no
fish out of water in Cubberley Au
ditorium last night when he ran
smoothly through a speech that
had the audience of about '250
laughing all the way.
Fitzwater displayed a candor
and sense of humor that he often
could not publicly express in his
10 years of serving as White
House press secretary under
Presidents George Bush and
Ronald Reagan.
Starting off with a steady
stream of jokes and anecdotes,
Fitzwater made it clear he
wouldn't hold anything back
when he talked about the Republi
cans' defeat in the 1992 election.
"Now, being rejected by 50 mil
lion people is no day at the beach,
let me tell you," Fitzwater said.
"Why did we lose the election? We
didn't understand the economic
needs of the country, we were out
of touch and we ran a crummy
campaign."
Fit/water's talk ranged from
his assessment of Clinton's first
year in office to a recounting of

the Gulf War experience. No polit
ical figure was safe as he criticized
and praised politicians from both
sides of the political divide.
As the longest-serving presi
dential aide in White I louse histo
ry, Fitzwater outlined four basic
rules of survival in Washington.
"One: If you've ever run a stop
light, don't write it in a diary.
Two: Whitewater Development is
not a Colorado rafting trip). Three:
If Bobby Inman ever comes to
your house, hide the newspapers.
Four: If you have an affair, what
ever you do, don't tell Arkansas
state troopers about it.
"You have to have a thick skin
and a thin mind," Fitzwater said.
Fitzwater even took shots at
former Clinton press secretary
George Stephanopoulos, pointing
out that TV had not been kind to
him because he "looks like he's
15."
"Some people say George
Stephanopoulos did more for my
reputation than George Bush,"
Fitzwater quipped.
Fitzwater conceded that
Stephanopoulos was sharp and
beat him in the six months of pres
idential campaigning.
"I would wake up in the morn
ing, and that son of a bitch would
have a story on the wire respond
ing to something I said before I
even said it!" Fitzwater joked.
He generally made positive
comments about President Clin
ton's performance in office. But
Fitzwater did say that Clinton
sounded mysteriously like "The
Gipper," his former boss, in his
State of the Union address the
night before.
Clinton's staff "wants to know
how he can be more like Ronald
Reagan," Fitzwater said. "I sug
gested that he sleep through Cab
inet meetings — it always worked
for us."
Fitzwater couldn't let Clinton
get away with his public jogging
displays either.
"I mean, jogging to McDon
ald's is a bit like reading Madon
na's book in church," Fitzwater
said.
Fitzwater did predict that Clin
ton, if he followed his present

course, would probably win re
election.
"As for (Ross) Perot, he's only
a refraction of his former shad
ow," Fitzwater said.
Stan ford-in-Government
helped bring Fitzwater to Stan
ford because he was a former
insider who is now out of the
Washington political machine,
according to junior Susie
Thomas, director of public policy
forums for SIG.
"I knew Mr. Fitzwater would
be funny after I talked to him a
couple of times on the phone,"
Thomas said. "He's very down to
earth."
Fitzwater knows a number of
people at Stanford, including
Senior Hoover Fellows Martin
Anderson and John Cogan, and
former Secretary of State George
Shultz. Cogan was the deputy
director of the Office of Manage
ment and Budget under Bush.
Fitzwater said, "I would
always go over to [ Cogan | to ask
him about (Hoover fellow and
1992 vice-presidential candidate
James) Stockdale. I'd say, 'What

the hell is this guy talking about?'
Fitzwater had nothing but
good things to say about Provost
Condoleezza Rice, whom he
worked with on an arms control
agreement under Bush.
"She is truly an incredible
woman," he said.
In a serious part of his speech,
Fitzwater recounted some per
sonal episodes working under the
Bush administration. He remem
bered how on Feb. 27, 1991, he
watched Bush trace Iraqi lines of
retreat on a military map with his
fingers. Finally, Bush declared
that the war would come to an
official end that night.
Fitzwater defended Bush's
decision not to pursue Saddam
Hussein into Baghdad, and point
ed to the recent U.S. failure to
capture General Mohamed Far
rah Aidid in Somalia as evidence
that pursuing an individual lead
er is not feasible.
"It's not wrong to keep out of
war, or back out of a bad situa
tion. But it is harmful to let
uncertainty and indecision make

U.S. foreign policy," Fitzwater
said.
Fitzwater said he doubted he
would go back to being a press
secretary, because he realized
after leaving politics how much of
a "straitjacket" his mind had been
in.
"Everything I said had to be
the president's words and ideas,"
he said. "Now I can say all of the
fool things I said tonight."
Fitzwater said he rose to the
top mostly by chance. Growing up
on a Kansas farm, he went to
Kansas State University "just like
every other guy in Kansas," grad
uating with a degree in journal
ism.
After following a girlfriend to
Washington, Fitzwater soon
found that no newspaper was
going to hire him. He worked for
the government instead, and, for
17 years, worked his way up the
public relations ladder before he
was drafted as press secretary by
Don Regan, secretary of the trea
sury. According to Fitzwater, he
wasn't even a Republican when
he went to Washington.

Fitzwater displayed a candor
and sense of humor that he often
could not publicly express in his
10 years of serving as White
House press secretary under
Presidents George Bush and
Ronald Reagan.
Starting off with a steady
stream of jokes and anecdotes,
Fitzwater made it clear he
wouldn't hold anything back
when he talked about the Republi
cans' defeat in the 1992 election.
"Now, being rejected by 50 mil
lion people is no day at the beach,
let me tell you," Fitzwater said.
"Why did we lose the election? We
didn't understand the economic
needs of the country, we were out
of touch and we ran a crummy
campaign."
Fit/water's talk ranged from
his assessment of Clinton's first
year in office to a recounting of

the Gulf War experience. No polit
ical figure was safe as he criticized
and praised politicians from both
sides of the political divide.
As the longest-serving presi
dential aide in White I louse histo
ry, Fitzwater outlined four basic
rules of survival in Washington.
"One: If you've ever run a stop
light, don't write it in a diary.
Two: Whitewater Development is
not a Colorado rafting trip). Three:
If Bobby Inman ever comes to
your house, hide the newspapers.
Four: If you have an affair, what
ever you do, don't tell Arkansas
state troopers about it.
"You have to have a thick skin
and a thin mind," Fitzwater said.
Fitzwater even took shots at
former Clinton press secretary
George Stephanopoulos, pointing
out that TV had not been kind to
him because he "looks like he's
15."
"Some people say George
Stephanopoulos did more for my
reputation than George Bush,"
Fitzwater quipped.
Fitzwater conceded that
Stephanopoulos was sharp and
beat him in the six months of pres
idential campaigning.
"I would wake up in the morn
ing, and that son of a bitch would
have a story on the wire respond
ing to something I said before I
even said it!" Fitzwater joked.
He generally made positive
comments about President Clin
ton's performance in office. But
Fitzwater did say that Clinton
sounded mysteriously like "The
Gipper," his former boss, in his
State of the Union address the
night before.
Clinton's staff "wants to know
how he can be more like Ronald
Reagan," Fitzwater said. "I sug
gested that he sleep through Cab
inet meetings — it always worked
for us."
Fitzwater couldn't let Clinton
get away with his public jogging
displays either.
"I mean, jogging to McDon
ald's is a bit like reading Madon
na's book in church," Fitzwater
said.
Fitzwater did predict that Clin
ton, if he followed his present

course, would probably win re
election.
"As for (Ross) Perot, he's only
a refraction of his former shad
ow," Fitzwater said.
Stan ford-in-Government
helped bring Fitzwater to Stan
ford because he was a former
insider who is now out of the
Washington political machine,
according to junior Susie
Thomas, director of public policy
forums for SIG.
"I knew Mr. Fitzwater would
be funny after I talked to him a
couple of times on the phone,"
Thomas said. "He's very down to
earth."
Fitzwater knows a number of
people at Stanford, including
Senior Hoover Fellows Martin
Anderson and John Cogan, and
former Secretary of State George
Shultz. Cogan was the deputy
director of the Office of Manage
ment and Budget under Bush.
Fitzwater said, "I would
always go over to [ Cogan | to ask
him about (Hoover fellow and
1992 vice-presidential candidate
James) Stockdale. I'd say, 'What

the hell is this guy talking about?'
Fitzwater had nothing but
good things to say about Provost
Condoleezza Rice, whom he
worked with on an arms control
agreement under Bush.
"She is truly an incredible
woman," he said.
In a serious part of his speech,
Fitzwater recounted some per
sonal episodes working under the
Bush administration. He remem
bered how on Feb. 27, 1991, he
watched Bush trace Iraqi lines of
retreat on a military map with his
fingers. Finally, Bush declared
that the war would come to an
official end that night.
Fitzwater defended Bush's
decision not to pursue Saddam
Hussein into Baghdad, and point
ed to the recent U.S. failure to
capture General Mohamed Far
rah Aidid in Somalia as evidence
that pursuing an individual lead
er is not feasible.
"It's not wrong to keep out of
war, or back out of a bad situa
tion. But it is harmful to let
uncertainty and indecision make

U.S. foreign policy," Fitzwater
said.
Fitzwater said he doubted he
would go back to being a press
secretary, because he realized
after leaving politics how much of
a "straitjacket" his mind had been
in.
"Everything I said had to be
the president's words and ideas,"
he said. "Now I can say all of the
fool things I said tonight."
Fitzwater said he rose to the
top mostly by chance. Growing up
on a Kansas farm, he went to
Kansas State University "just like
every other guy in Kansas," grad
uating with a degree in journal
ism.
After following a girlfriend to
Washington, Fitzwater soon
found that no newspaper was
going to hire him. He worked for
the government instead, and, for
17 years, worked his way up the
public relations ladder before he
was drafted as press secretary by
Don Regan, secretary of the trea
sury. According to Fitzwater, he
wasn't even a Republican when
he went to Washington.
It wasn't the White House
press room — no fancy presiden
tial seal, no clicking cameras, no
screaming reporters.
But Marlin Fitzwater was no
fish out of water in Cubberley Au
ditorium last night when he ran
smoothly through a speech that
had the audience of about '250
laughing all the way.
