# Snowboarding: not just an attitude anymore
## Overcoming the rebel image, 'alternative' sport offers exciting new challenge 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
Some of you might know them
as those pesky little mountain
hoggers who just had to be dif
ferent from everybody else. Or
perhaps you've encountered
them blocking a run while rest
ing on their rear-ends. But for
snowboarders themselves,
they're the only ones who really
know how to have fun on the
slopes.
And if you've never tried
snowboarding yourself, you
might find that you'd like to be
different too.
"It's so fun, you just can't be
lieve how fun it is," said Debbie
Keelin, owner of Mad Dog Snow
board Shop in Palo Alto. "With
all the things that you can do, it's
like surfing on snow."
Keelin and her son first
opened their shop last year as a
family business. They chose to
sell snowboarding equipment
because it is the family's sport
and serves to bring them togeth
er in a common interest.
"I was a skier all my life, and
one day my son wanted to start
snowboarding," Keelin said. "I
saw how much fun it was and got
started, too."
The sport itself first emerged
on the mountains 12 years ago
and has grown in popularity ever
since. Whether or not snow
boarding began as a snow form of

skateboarding is questionable,
but there is little doubt that the
sport is definitely emerging as a
change from the norm.
"It feels so much different
from skiing," said freshman
Steve Smith, a three-year snow
boarder. "It's just a fiat board,
you make broad turns, and it's so
easy to catch an edge."
Smith's love of snowboarding
grew out of his experience as a
skateboarder and also as a skier.
He skied for five years before
testing his talents on a snow
board, and for Smith the switch
was for good.
"I just started snowboarding
to get real good at it," Smith said.
"If you've got a background in
skateboarding or surfing, it's
easier to catch on."
Nowadays, most ski areas
cater to snowboarders as well as
skiers. Some resorts even have
separate snowboard parks, re
flecting the growing popularity
of the so-called alternative sport.
Unfortunately, the relation
ship between skiers and snow
boarders has been anything but
cordial. The emergence of snow
boarding has meant more con
gestion on the slopes, and the
presence of the snow surfers has
angered some of the traditional
skiing population.
"I know a lot of skiers who feel
animosity toward us," Smith
said. "I think it's associated with
the skater-kid group. With the

distinctive clothes, they incorpo
rate that image with bad atti
tudes and snowboarders."
Smith admits that some
snowboarders act as though they
own the mountain. "The good
ones will get down fast, and with
those there's a good chance that
you will get cut off by a snow
boarder."
The truth remains, however,
that snowboarding is no longer
just for the grunge crowd.
"Somebody was really intelli
gent and innovative, and gave
skiing a whole new perspective,"
Keelin said. "At first it was an
underground, hard-core activity,
but everybody's doing it now."
Although snowboard clothing
is unique and clearly the brain
child of the earlier fashions of
the skateboarding age, it has
taken on a modern-day twist.
"It's really phenomenal," said
Helen Silderberg, an employee
at Pacific Mountaineering in
Palo Alto. "Although the cloth
ing looks very grunge, it's still
made of the best fabrics, Gore-
Tex and all the rest."
If you're looking to save
money, don't automatically
think that the equipment neces
sary for snowboarding provides
a cheaper snow sport alterna
tive. Although snowboarders are
without poles, the total cost of
equipment including board,


Aaron Green Daily
boots and bindings is generally
just as expensive as a complete
set of ski gear.
"The price is the same, but the
snowboard industry has really
changed with the advance of tech
nology," Keelin said. "When you
buy snowboards today you can
keep them forever — there's no
change in equipment with age."
The success of Keelin's shop is
testimony to the rise in snow
board interest. For the first four
months in the summer after the
store opened last May, Keelin
sold $20,000 in skates and cloth

ing. In the three winter months
since then, the store sold $60,000
fri snowboarding equipment and
winter clothing.
Until the next snow phenom
ena invades the crisp mountain
air, the oddities of snowboarding
will continue to draw intense in
terest.
"The soft swaying back and
forth, just like surfing, the way it
cuts through the waves," Smith
said. "With one foot in front of
the other, it's definitely a totally
different experience."
And it's an experience that
more and more people want to live.
"Kids just don't ask for skis
for Christmas anymore," Keelin
said. "They want snowboards."

board Shop in Palo Alto. "With
all the things that you can do, it's
like surfing on snow."
Keelin and her son first
opened their shop last year as a
family business. They chose to
sell snowboarding equipment
because it is the family's sport
and serves to bring them togeth
er in a common interest.
"I was a skier all my life, and
one day my son wanted to start
snowboarding," Keelin said. "I
saw how much fun it was and got
started, too."
The sport itself first emerged
on the mountains 12 years ago
and has grown in popularity ever
since. Whether or not snow
boarding began as a snow form of

skateboarding is questionable,
but there is little doubt that the
sport is definitely emerging as a
change from the norm.
"It feels so much different
from skiing," said freshman
Steve Smith, a three-year snow
boarder. "It's just a fiat board,
you make broad turns, and it's so
easy to catch an edge."
Smith's love of snowboarding
grew out of his experience as a
skateboarder and also as a skier.
He skied for five years before
testing his talents on a snow
board, and for Smith the switch
was for good.
"I just started snowboarding
to get real good at it," Smith said.
"If you've got a background in
skateboarding or surfing, it's
easier to catch on."
Nowadays, most ski areas
cater to snowboarders as well as
skiers. Some resorts even have
separate snowboard parks, re
flecting the growing popularity
of the so-called alternative sport.
Unfortunately, the relation
ship between skiers and snow
boarders has been anything but
cordial. The emergence of snow
boarding has meant more con
gestion on the slopes, and the
presence of the snow surfers has
angered some of the traditional
skiing population.
"I know a lot of skiers who feel
animosity toward us," Smith
said. "I think it's associated with
the skater-kid group. With the

distinctive clothes, they incorpo
rate that image with bad atti
tudes and snowboarders."
Smith admits that some
snowboarders act as though they
own the mountain. "The good
ones will get down fast, and with
those there's a good chance that
you will get cut off by a snow
boarder."
The truth remains, however,
that snowboarding is no longer
just for the grunge crowd.
"Somebody was really intelli
gent and innovative, and gave
skiing a whole new perspective,"
Keelin said. "At first it was an
underground, hard-core activity,
but everybody's doing it now."
Although snowboard clothing
is unique and clearly the brain
child of the earlier fashions of
the skateboarding age, it has
taken on a modern-day twist.
"It's really phenomenal," said
Helen Silderberg, an employee
at Pacific Mountaineering in
Palo Alto. "Although the cloth
ing looks very grunge, it's still
made of the best fabrics, Gore-
Tex and all the rest."
If you're looking to save
money, don't automatically
think that the equipment neces
sary for snowboarding provides
a cheaper snow sport alterna
tive. Although snowboarders are
without poles, the total cost of
equipment including board,

boots and bindings is generally
just as expensive as a complete
set of ski gear.
"The price is the same, but the
snowboard industry has really
changed with the advance of tech
nology," Keelin said. "When you
buy snowboards today you can
keep them forever — there's no
change in equipment with age."
The success of Keelin's shop is
testimony to the rise in snow
board interest. For the first four
months in the summer after the
store opened last May, Keelin
sold $20,000 in skates and cloth

ing. In the three winter months
since then, the store sold $60,000
fri snowboarding equipment and
winter clothing.
Until the next snow phenom
ena invades the crisp mountain
air, the oddities of snowboarding
will continue to draw intense in
terest.
"The soft swaying back and
forth, just like surfing, the way it
cuts through the waves," Smith
said. "With one foot in front of
the other, it's definitely a totally
different experience."
And it's an experience that
more and more people want to live.
"Kids just don't ask for skis
for Christmas anymore," Keelin
said. "They want snowboards."
