# Stanford ski team shoots into new season
## Cardinal blends old and young 
### Todd Bernstein Staff writer 
Stanford is known for its ath
letic diversity, but the Farm has
never been thought of as a "ski
school."
Despite this fact, there is a se
lect group of students who make
up a very talented Stanford ski
team which hits the slopes week
ly at Lake Tahoe.
The men's and women's
teams, which compete regularly
against squads from California
and Nevada, have enjoyed great
success this year.
After taking third place in its
first two competitions of the sea
son, the women's team is poised
and ready to take their skis on
the road to Monmouth, Calif.,
for the regional championships
on Feb. 19 and 20.
Leading possibly the best
women's team Stanford has seen
in recent years is senior Margie
Backstrom. Backstrom, a Boze
man, Mont., native, has been
skiing since she was 11. Her rac
ing career began in high school
as she competed on slalom and
giant slalom courses. Her efforts

qualified her for the Junior
Olympic team an impressive five
times.
So how does such an experi
enced and talented skier find her
way to Stanford?
"By the time I was done with
high school, I was burnt out,"
Backstrom said. "I didn't want
my college decision based on ski
ing. I wasn't good enough to go
straight from high school to an
NCAA team."
Stanford's program seems
the perfect fit for Backstrom,
who wavers between skiing seri
ously and just going out there to
have fun.
"It's great here. My sopho
more season I was serious about
(skiing] and I qualified for the
National Collegiate Skiing Asso
ciation (NCSA) nationals in
Lake Placid," Backstrom said.
The atmosphere surrounding
the Cardinal team seems to be
perfect for Backstrom as well.
"It's a lot of fun. The competi
tion is great and everybody is re
ally laid back," she said.
