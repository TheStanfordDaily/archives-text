# Stanford ski team shoots into new season
## Cardinal blends old and young 
### Todd Bernstein Staff writer 
Stanford is known for its ath
letic diversity, but the Farm has
never been thought of as a "ski
school."
Despite this fact, there is a se
lect group of students who make
up a very talented Stanford ski
team which hits the slopes week
ly at Lake Tahoe.
The men's and women's
teams, which compete regularly
against squads from California
and Nevada, have enjoyed great
success this year.
After taking third place in its
first two competitions of the sea
son, the women's team is poised
and ready to take their skis on
the road to Monmouth, Calif.,
for the regional championships
on Feb. 19 and 20.
Leading possibly the best
women's team Stanford has seen
in recent years is senior Margie
Backstrom. Backstrom, a Boze
man, Mont., native, has been
skiing since she was 11. Her rac
ing career began in high school
as she competed on slalom and
giant slalom courses. Her efforts

qualified her for the Junior
Olympic team an impressive five
times.
So how does such an experi
enced and talented skier find her
way to Stanford?
"By the time I was done with
high school, I was burnt out,"
Backstrom said. "I didn't want
my college decision based on ski
ing. I wasn't good enough to go
straight from high school to an
NCAA team."
Stanford's program seems
the perfect fit for Backstrom,
who wavers between skiing seri
ously and just going out there to
have fun.
"It's great here. My sopho
more season I was serious about
(skiing] and I qualified for the
National Collegiate Skiing Asso
ciation (NCSA) nationals in
Lake Placid," Backstrom said.
The atmosphere surrounding
the Cardinal team seems to be
perfect for Backstrom as well.
"It's a lot of fun. The competi
tion is great and everybody is re
ally laid back," she said.

seaaon.
women's success this year can be
attributed to the efforts of senior
Ali Salomon. For Salomon, skiing
is second nature.
Having skied since the age of
four, Backstrom finds compet
ing for Stanford a nice change
from her experience as a high
school skier. "The competition is
plenty difficult," Salomon said.
"But it's great because it's a
team competition. The team is
really supportive and even when
you don't have a good run, every
one is there rooting for you."
Unlike the veteran women's
team, the men are a young group
with promise of vast improve
ment based on its raw talent.
Senior team captain Brendan

Kiernan hopes to bring it all togeth
er for the men this year. While Kier
nan has raced since sixth grade, ski
racing has never been a favorite.
"Skiing is one of the most im
portant things in my life, but
there's a lot more to skiing than
ski racing," Kiernan said. "The
competition to me is in some
ways irrelevant."
While Kierman's goals may
lay beyond his next race, as the
men's captain, he realizes his
role on the youthful team.
"The men's team is much
more of a developmental squad,"
Kiernan said. "We are taking
athletes and giving them coach
ing and experience to try to make
them into better ski racers."
One such athlete is sopho
more Rob Weber, who had never
raced competitively before com
ing to Stanford.

"[The transition) is a bit diffi
cult," Weber said. "In free-skiing
I know what I'm doing, but it
seems like everything's thrown
out the window in the gates."
Weber, currently the treasur
er of the ski team, not only en
joys the competition, but also
finds the camaraderie of the Car
dinal squad inspiring.
"It's great to get off campus
and go to Tahoe," Weber said.
"The crowd isn't the normal
crowd. Everyone up there is equal
— all labels are thrown out. It's a
fun-loving group."
The ski teams have three
more competitions before re
gional in February. With strong
performances in these prelimi
nary events and a good showing
at regionals, who knows —
maybe Stanford will be consid
ered a "ski school" after all.
