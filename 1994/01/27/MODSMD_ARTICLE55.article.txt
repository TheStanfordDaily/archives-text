# Skiing in California...
## Stanford students of every ability can find nearby alpine opportunities 
### Greg Collins Sarah Nagae Editorial staff 
Although many people flock
to the Bay Area for the almost
year-round sunshine, it is also
situated near several top ski re
sorts. From the traditional Lake
Tahoe weekend trip to off-the
beaten-track locations like Bear
Valley or Mt. Shasta, world-cal
iber skiing is only five or six
hours away from the Stanford
campus.
Very few recreational sports
offer the quick gratification of
skiing. With only one or two
lessons over a weekend, a novice
skier can become comfortable
enough to survive a day on the
slopes without hundreds of
bumps and bruises. By combin
ing the speed and freedom of ski
ing with a beautiful natural envi
ronment, a trip to the slopes pro
vides a great escape from the
daily grind of college life.

TAHOE
Lake Tahoe, the area which
first pops into most peoples'
minds when they think of North
ern California skiing, is by far
the most popular destination of
Stanford dorm ski trips.
Boasting nearly 15 alpine re
sorts including giants such as
Heavenly, Northstar, Alpine
Valley and Squaw Valley, Tahoe
boasts California's premiere ski
ing. While the drive can take as
little as four hours with clear
roads and light traffic, a five
hour trek is a more realistic esti
mation once weather and chain
time are taken into account.
SQUAW VALLEY
Located near the north end of
Lake Tahoe is Squaw Valley
USA, arguably the most lavish
ski resort in California and host
of the 1968 Winter Olympics.
Spreading 4,000 acres of slopes
over six Sierra peaks, this re

sort's vast expanses of skiing op
tions are serviced by 32 lifts.
The base lodge, at a 6,200-foot
elevation, has restaurants,
shops and several lodging choic
es. A quick trip in the Super Gon
dola drops skiers off at 8,200 ft.,
where the High Camp Bath and
Tennis Club offers a variety of
recreational opportunities. Be
sides being a hub for many of the
top ski runs, there is an outdoor
100 x 200 ice rink and indoor fa
cilities like heated tennis courts
and a swimming lagoon/spa
which provide a nice escape from
the frigid outdoor conditions. A
150-passenger cable car also
transports skiers from the base
lodge up to the higher runs.
Twenty-five percent of the
terrain garners an easy rating,
with several beginner runs locat
ed at the top of the mountain.
This allows even the first-time
skier a view of the entire resort
without having to brave a run
more advanced than his or her

ability. At 45 percent, the inter
mediate slopes take up much of
Squaw's skiing area. The re
maining 30 percent is left to the
experts, as these black-diamond
runs have often been the back
drops for filmmakers shooting
their "extreme skiing" seg
ments.
"Squaw is really big. You can
be there for a week and not get
bored because there is such a va
riety," said Christina Dixon, a
Stanford senior who has skied
since she was six years old.
However, along with all this
splendor, Squaw Valley's prices
are a bit steeper than other re
sorts. With lifts operating 9 a.m.
— 4 p.m. on weekdays and 8:30
a.m. — 4 p.m. weekends and hol
idays, an adult all day lift ticket
costs $41. A half-day ticket can
be purchased for $28.
Consecutive-day lift ticket
packages can be purchased at a
reduced rate. A two-day ticket
costs $78, and three or more day
packages can also be purchased
at roughly $30 a day.
Squaw's ski rental shop offers
over 1,500 sport and high-per
formance skis, boots and poles. A
sport package rents for $20 a
day, and a high performance set
goes for $32. Snowboarding
packages rent for $25 and $32,
respectively.
The Squaw Valley Ski School
offers a variety of programs to
suit a skier's ability. Available
anytime for $26, the lessons do
not have a set time limit, maxi
mizing the learning experience.
Private lessons are available for
$50 per hour.
Located 196 miles from San
Francisco via all-weather Inter
state 80, Squaw Valley USA is
just two miles off Highway 89.
HEAVENLY
Situated on the south side of
the lake, Heavenly is Tahoe's
second largest resort with 4,800
acres and 16 chairlifts, two ex
press chairs and a tram which
zips from the parking lot to the
upper mountain. Skiers may not
only choose which runs to tackle,
they can also pick what state
they ski in, as part of the resort
lies in California while the other
half of the mountain is across the
border in Nevada.
With a top elevation of 10,040
ft., Heavenly's slopes provide
3,500 feet of vertical drop with a
wide variety of terrain. Begin
ning skiers can master the fun
damentals, not to mention try to
stay upright, on the gentle runs
which comprise 20 percent of the
mountain. The majority of Heav
enly is designated as intermedi
ate while 35 percent of the runs
are black diamonds — only for
the experienced or the particu
larly gutsy.

A straight shot on Highway 50
from Sacramento, Heavenly pro
vides an enticing alternative to
the bustle on the northern side
of the lake. Although a full day of
skiing at Heavenly will cost $40
if purchased at the mountain,
$35 discount tickets are sold at
most Safeway stores in Northern
California.
NORTHSTAR AND
ALPINE MEADOWS
While Squaw and Heavenly
frequently share the spotlight as
Tahoe's two finest resorts, both
Northstar and Alpine Meadows
are tempting alternatives to the
crowds and glitter of these more
lavish mountains.
Located between Truckee and
King's Beach off Highway 167,
Northstar spans 1,800 acres and
offers a 2,200 ft. vertical drop.
Blue circles mark half of the
mountain's runs while first
timers and experts share their
claim to the remainder of the
slopes.
"I like skiing at Northstar be
cause the advanced runs are re
ally intermediate so you feel like
a total stud when you're skiing,"
said sophomore Becky Pearson
of Northstar's difficulty.
While some may not consider
some of Northstar's harder runs
to be truly deserving of the black
diamond qualification, the Back
side Express quad chair leads to
eight truly advanced slopes. On
runs with names like Rapids and
Burn Out, almost any skier's
legs as well as resolve are guar
anteed to face a test on North
star's second face.
A high speed, six-passenger
gondola transports skiers from
Northstar Village at the base of
the mountain to the day lodge
where two of the three express
chairs, the two triple chairs and
three double chairs begin.
While a Northstar lift ticket
will still set the all-day skier back
$40, the resort limits its daily lift
ticket sales so the slopes do not
become overcrowded on popular
weekends.
Sheltered from the fierce
winds which often whip over the
slopes at Squaw, Alpine Mead
ows' 2,000 acres provide a more
sedate environment for skiers of
all abilities. Even though Alpine
is located a mere five miles south
of Squaw off Highway 89, the
area frequently registers much
warmer temperatures.
Two express quad chairs, plus
nine other lifts deliver skiers to
well-groomed, mainly interme
diate runs which cover the re
sort's 1,600 foot vertical span.
Beginners will feel comfortable
traversing over 25 percent of
Alpine's slopes while those look
ing for moguls and steep faces
will find these challenges on 35
