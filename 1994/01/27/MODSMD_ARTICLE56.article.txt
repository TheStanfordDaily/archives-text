percent of the area's terrain.
A portion of the $41 adult lift
ticket price goes to the mainte
nance and operation of Alpine's
snow-making machines which
provide artificial flakes on 11
runs. While the noise generated
by these machines often disturbs
the serenity of the mountain am
biance, low snowfall necessitates
their use.
BEAR VALLEY
Although Bear Valley is less
well-known than its northern
counterparts, many consider
this Central Sierra resort a desir
able option to Lake Tahoe main
ly because of its lower prices and
relatively easy access. A mere
four-hour drive from campus
when the roads are clear, Bear
Valley is located along Highway
4 two hours northeast of Stock
ton.
"One of the biggest reasons
students would want to ski here
is the cost," said Bear Valley
manager Eric Bottomley. "You
can ski on weekends for $25 and
it's only $20 on weekdays mak
ing it an easy and cheap day
trip."
With an overall difficulty
level similar to the smaller
Tahoe resorts, Bear Valley's ter
rain consists of 30 percent be
ginner runs, 40 percent inter-

mediate and 30 percent of the
mountain categorized as ad
vanced. The slopes are divided
into two sections with the upper
part mostly comprised of easier
runs and a much steeper lower
portion perfect for the experi
enced skier.
With 11 lifts servicing 1,280
acres, lift lines are an uncommon
sight at Bear Valley, although a
high-speed chair has yet to find
its way to the hill.
MT. SHASTA
A second Central Sierra ski
ing alternative lies at Mt. Shas
ta, 250 miles north of San Fran
cisco. Mt. Shasta Ski Park is
California's newest resort and
boasts 22 alpine runs stretch
ing out over 1,100 vertical feet.
The park is located just 10 miles
east of Interstate 5 via Highway
89, enabling easy access even in
the harshest of weather condi
tions. Although the trip may be
slow going in the beginning due
to traffic around the North Bay,
1-5 is usually clear of traffic
from Vacaville to all points
north.
Rising 14,162 feet, the sum
mit of Mt. Shasta provides an
awe-inspiring backdrop for all
kinds of skiing. Mt. Shasta Ski
Park prides itself on its friendly
atmosphere, giving special at-

tention to families and begin
ners.
Although Shasta only offers
300 acres of skiing area, there
are options for every level of
skier. Of the 22 runs, seven are
beginner, eight are intermedi
ate, and seven are advanced. For
night skiing, the Marmot Ridge
Lift has seven runs, broken
down into four beginner/novice
and three intermediate runs.
Overall costs at Mt. Shasta
are also aimed toward the begin
ner. All-day adult lift tickets (9
a.m.-4 p.m. or 12:30-10 p.m.)
cost $26, or $21 on weekdays. A
half day ticket (12:30-4 p.m. or 4-
10 p.m.) costs $17, while $32
supplies a full 11 hours of skiing.
A weekend or holiday three-day
pass runs a very affordable $68.
Along with the special week
day lift ticket prices, Mt. Shasta
offers two other weekly specials.
On Tuesdays, all lift tickets cost
only $16, and Wednesday and
Thursday nights are two for one
nights. Bring a friend and ski for
half price.
All-day ski rentals cost $17,
while half-day or night rentals
will cost $14. Snowboard rentals
cost $22 for a full day, or $16 for
half-day or night rentals.
Mt. Shasta Ski School offers
several options for the first-time
skier. Available to both skiers
and snowboarders is a group les
son package which includes one
or two lessons, rental equipment
and a special beginner lift ticket.
The one lesson package costs
$30, with the two lesson package
running at $40.
General group lessons are
also available. Lasting one-and
one-half hours and beginning at
10 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. daily,
these provide first-time skiers
with valuable survival tips be
fore letting them loose on the
slopes. One lesson costs $18 and
can be taken in the morning or
the afternoon, or the two-lesson
package can be purchased for
$28, with both a morning and an
afternoon lesson. Private
lessons cost $35 for a one-hour
session.
Mt. Shasta also provides a
new 25-kilometer cross-country
trail system. The Ski Park
Nordic Center has power-tilled
track and skating lanes for skiers
of all ages and abilities. All-day
passes cost $8, or $6 for a half
day pass. Rental packages are
available for $10 (all day) or $7
(half day), with lessons at the
same price as downhill skiing.
The Nordic Center is open Fri
days through Sundays as well as
holiday dates.
From the height and beauty of
Squaw Valley and the hustle and
bustle of Heavenly to the more
mellow atmosphere of Bear Val
ley, skiers of all abilities should
be able to find a resort to meet
their skiing needs.

percent of the area's terrain.
A portion of the $41 adult lift
ticket price goes to the mainte
nance and operation of Alpine's
snow-making machines which
provide artificial flakes on 11
runs. While the noise generated
by these machines often disturbs
the serenity of the mountain am
biance, low snowfall necessitates
their use.
BEAR VALLEY
Although Bear Valley is less
well-known than its northern
counterparts, many consider
this Central Sierra resort a desir
able option to Lake Tahoe main
ly because of its lower prices and
relatively easy access. A mere
four-hour drive from campus
when the roads are clear, Bear
Valley is located along Highway
4 two hours northeast of Stock
ton.
"One of the biggest reasons
students would want to ski here
is the cost," said Bear Valley
manager Eric Bottomley. "You
can ski on weekends for $25 and
it's only $20 on weekdays mak
ing it an easy and cheap day
trip."
With an overall difficulty
level similar to the smaller
Tahoe resorts, Bear Valley's ter
rain consists of 30 percent be
ginner runs, 40 percent inter-

mediate and 30 percent of the
mountain categorized as ad
vanced. The slopes are divided
into two sections with the upper
part mostly comprised of easier
runs and a much steeper lower
portion perfect for the experi
enced skier.
With 11 lifts servicing 1,280
acres, lift lines are an uncommon
sight at Bear Valley, although a
high-speed chair has yet to find
its way to the hill.
MT. SHASTA
A second Central Sierra ski
ing alternative lies at Mt. Shas
ta, 250 miles north of San Fran
cisco. Mt. Shasta Ski Park is
California's newest resort and
boasts 22 alpine runs stretch
ing out over 1,100 vertical feet.
The park is located just 10 miles
east of Interstate 5 via Highway
89, enabling easy access even in
the harshest of weather condi
tions. Although the trip may be
slow going in the beginning due
to traffic around the North Bay,
1-5 is usually clear of traffic
from Vacaville to all points
north.
Rising 14,162 feet, the sum
mit of Mt. Shasta provides an
awe-inspiring backdrop for all
kinds of skiing. Mt. Shasta Ski
Park prides itself on its friendly
atmosphere, giving special at-

tention to families and begin
ners.
Although Shasta only offers
300 acres of skiing area, there
are options for every level of
skier. Of the 22 runs, seven are
beginner, eight are intermedi
ate, and seven are advanced. For
night skiing, the Marmot Ridge
Lift has seven runs, broken
down into four beginner/novice
and three intermediate runs.
Overall costs at Mt. Shasta
are also aimed toward the begin
ner. All-day adult lift tickets (9
a.m.-4 p.m. or 12:30-10 p.m.)
