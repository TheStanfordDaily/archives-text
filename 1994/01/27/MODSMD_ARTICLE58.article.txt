## Cross country skates to new heights

When most people hear the
term "skiing," they automatical
ly think of chair lifts and parallel
swishes down steep, glistening
slopes.
While the majority of skiers
prefer to travel the mountain in
a vertical direction, cross-coun
try skiing has established itself
as a popular alternative to the
high costs and crowds which
often accompany downhill ski
ing.
The main difference between
downhill and cross-country is
the mode of propulsion. Down
hill skiers use a lift to move them
up the slopes and then rely on
gravity to bring them down.
Cross-country skiers must pro
pel themselves into the wilder
ness or through courses specifi
cally designed as Nordic courses.
They traverse not only flat sur
faces, but at times also climb and
descend slopes as steep as any
downhill trail.
Because cross-country skiers
are required to provide their own
momentum, an entirely differ
ent type of ski is needed. These
skis have free-heel bindings
which keep the heel of the boot
off the ski surface to provide a
wider range of motion and better
traction.

Some cross-country skis are
designed to move in pre-made
snow grooves for an experience
know as track skiing. This is the
most common and well-known
of the four kinds of cross-coun
try skiing.
"When most people think
cross-country, they are thinking
of track-skiing," according to
The Pacific Mountaineer's
Keren Seymour.
Many cross-country areas fea
ture tracks which vary in size
from flat two-mile loops to hilly
routes which extend up to 25
miles and can take a full day to
manuever.
Next in popularity to these
pre-made tracks are completely
fiat areas designated for "skat
ing," a type of cross-country ski
ing done on extremely thin skis.
Unlike the pre-cut pathway
which characterizes track ski
ing, the skier must create his or
her own course by breaking
paths through the snow.
The extra energy necessary to
carve one's own trail makes
skating the most aerobic and
hardest of the four methods of
cross-country skiing. To build
strength necessary for interna
tional competition, many
