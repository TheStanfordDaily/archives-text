# The 						other skiing
## Cross country skates to new heights 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
When most people hear the
term "skiing," they automatical
ly think of chair lifts and parallel
swishes down steep, glistening
slopes.
While the majority of skiers
prefer to travel the mountain in
a vertical direction, cross-coun
try skiing has established itself
as a popular alternative to the
high costs and crowds which
often accompany downhill ski
ing.
The main difference between
downhill and cross-country is
the mode of propulsion. Down
hill skiers use a lift to move them
up the slopes and then rely on
gravity to bring them down.
Cross-country skiers must pro
pel themselves into the wilder
ness or through courses specifi
cally designed as Nordic courses.
They traverse not only flat sur
faces, but at times also climb and
descend slopes as steep as any
downhill trail.
Because cross-country skiers
are required to provide their own
momentum, an entirely differ
ent type of ski is needed. These
skis have free-heel bindings
which keep the heel of the boot
off the ski surface to provide a
wider range of motion and better
traction.

Some cross-country skis are
designed to move in pre-made
snow grooves for an experience
know as track skiing. This is the
most common and well-known
of the four kinds of cross-coun
try skiing.
"When most people think
cross-country, they are thinking
of track-skiing," according to
The Pacific Mountaineer's
Keren Seymour.
Many cross-country areas fea
ture tracks which vary in size
from flat two-mile loops to hilly
routes which extend up to 25
miles and can take a full day to
manuever.
Next in popularity to these
pre-made tracks are completely
fiat areas designated for "skat
ing," a type of cross-country ski
ing done on extremely thin skis.
Unlike the pre-cut pathway
which characterizes track ski
ing, the skier must create his or
her own course by breaking
paths through the snow.
The extra energy necessary to
carve one's own trail makes
skating the most aerobic and
hardest of the four methods of
cross-country skiing. To build
strength necessary for interna
tional competition, many

in their training. According to
Seymour, skating "is the fastest
growing area of cross-country
skiing."
Light-touring, a third varia
tion of cross-country skiing, uses
skis similar to downhill skis yet
with slight differences. The
Nordic skis have a metal edge
and a wax pattern on the bottom
to allow greater traction as the
skier pushes him or herself over
the ground.
Like skating, light-touring
does not require tracks as the
skier is free to navigate any
route, whether skiing through
meadows or pushing over
rugged, "back-country" terrain.
The skier is able to tailor his or
her pathway according to indi
vidual ability. "Even my grand
mother could go light-touring,"
said Seymour.
A last form of cross-country
skiing is known as telemarking
which combines aspects of both
downhill and nordic skiing.
While telemarkers can be found
on the downhill slopes, the dis
tinctly cross-country skis re
lease at the heel, requiring the
skier to make quick turns and
cuts to the side. Telemark skis
are specially designed to make
such traversing easier and
sharper.

Telemarking rates as the
most expensive type of cross
country skiing, with a weekend
rental running around $40,
while light touring registers as
the cheapest form with rental
costs close to $25.
Purchasing the equipment
requires a bigger investment,
though the total package is
not as expensive as downhill
gear. Light touring skis run
close to $230, while top of the
line telemark skis can cost up
to $400.
Regardless of whether you
wish to rent or buy, cross-coun
try skiing can be a rewarding ex
perience. The four different
types of skiing offer a style suit
ed for enthusiasts or beginners
regardless of age or ability.
Widely known as the best
overall aerobic workout pro
vided by any indoor or outdoor
sport, cross country is an opti
mal combination of physical
challenge, grace and excite
