# New ski technology provides cutting edge
## 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
Unless you harbor a sado-masochistic
enjoyment of aching feet and torn liga
ments, avoid the ski slopes if you are tech
nologically ignorant.
In a world where many high-tech ad
vances have become ends in themselves,
even the societal niche filled by recreation
has fallen prey to technology worship.
With upgrades in everything from skis
themselves to the wax which makes them
slick, ski technology has incorporated key
innovations of technics developed in other
fields of society.
"Anybody who hasn't tried a pair of
skis on in three or four years will be
amazed," said Jim Havens, assistant
manager of Heavenly Sports in Lake
Tahoe. "Using today's ski equipment is
like the difference between doing 80 mph
in a Volkswagon Bug and doing 80 in a
Beamer."
Havens pointed to several key ad
vances in ski and boot technology.
"The nicest thing about skis is that
they're lighter in weight, easier in turn
ing, and smoother at speed than any ski
made a couple of years ago," he said.
One such make, the cap ski — uses a
monocoque stretcher instead of using
wood or foam to absorb and disperse the
weight under the boot to the rest of the
ski. Cap skis contain "technology used in
Formula 1 racecars which distributes the
weight directly to the edges of the skis,
giving incredible edge grip on hard snow,"
according to Havens.
The Perimeter Edge Control System
by Olin also distributes weight along the
edges of the skis due to the addition of
small ridges running along the sides.
Havens predicted that this technology,
which works "like a tuning fork," will be
utilized by virtually all major ski-makers
in the coming years.
Ski manufacturers have already
brought incredibly lightweight skis
onto the market by using high-tech ce
ramic materials. These lighter skis,
while providing added comfort for the
skier, have a hefty pricetag, starting
about $250 upwards to $500 for cutting
edge-models.
Along with ski advances, waxes have
also improved in recent years. Toko's

flourinated wax (which costs $50 per
ounce) is reputed to provide remarkable
anti-static protection.
"[Toko] will make you ski faster than
(a) greased weasel," Havens said.
The hottest thing happening in the
area of boot technology appears to be cus
tom-molded footbeds and bootliners.
According to Jackson Hoyan of Snow
Country Magazine, "This one improve
ment will do more for your skiing than an
entire year on the hill."
Most specialty ski shops provide the
service of custom-molding, a process in
which the footbed or bootliner is literally
molded around your foot as you wait.
This process provides a custom-fit that
will keep a skier's feet warm and com
fortable, both necessary qualities for a
good day on the slopes, according to
Havens,
Two popular brands of custom-molds
are the Thermoflex from Reichle, which is
heat-activated and consists of EVA foam
and a lycra cover, and Zip-Fit, which uses
a silicon injection of the sort used by den
tists, Havens said.
Technological advances have not only
improved many skiers' performances,
they have also led to safer trips to the
slopes.
Anybody who has ever ventured onto a
ski slope knows the importance of a bind
ing that releases when you, or in most
cases, your knee, wants it to. Fortunately,
binding manufacturers have caught on
and adapted bindings accordingly.
"There is a new toepiece that releases
at an angle of 180 degrees so there is more
angle of release Ithan there previously
was)," said Greg Chandley, the General
Manager of Helm of Sun Valley, a ski shop
in San Mateo.
However, "only 60 or 70 percent of
bindings have that capability," Chandley
said.
This means that most rental skis
don't have the release yet. In addition,
the newer bindings are found mostly on
middle-end rather than low- or high-end
skis because they are "geared towards re
lease rather than retention," Chandley
said.
Response among some skiers to recent
technological innovations is not as recep
tive as one might expect.
"They talk about these amazing new

bindings, but you're still gonna break
your ass," said Cliff Brown, a Stanford ju
nior who tore ligaments in his knee dur
ing a recent ski outing in Lake Tahoe.
"If you look at the skis from five years

ago and you look at the skis today, by far
the biggest difference is the cosmetics,"
added junior Jon Carter.
Not even the very newest in technology
can please everyone on the mountain.

was)," said Greg Chandley, the General
Manager of Helm of Sun Valley, a ski shop
in San Mateo.
However, "only 60 or 70 percent of
bindings have that capability," Chandley
said.
This means that most rental skis
don't have the release yet. In addition,
the newer bindings are found mostly on
middle-end rather than low- or high-end
skis because they are "geared towards re
lease rather than retention," Chandley
said.
Response among some skiers to recent
technological innovations is not as recep
tive as one might expect.
"They talk about these amazing new

bindings, but you're still gonna break
your ass," said Cliff Brown, a Stanford ju
nior who tore ligaments in his knee dur
ing a recent ski outing in Lake Tahoe.
"If you look at the skis from five years

ago and you look at the skis today, by far
the biggest difference is the cosmetics,"
added junior Jon Carter.
Not even the very newest in technology
can please everyone on the mountain.
