# Monthly rebate to reduce student phone bills
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Instead of receiving a hefty one-time rebate
in May, students will soon see smaller reduc
tions in each monthly phone bill as Communi
cation Services spreads the wealth over the en
tire year.
In past years, the non-profit service has
doled out its surplus earnings by crediting stu

dent bills each May. But some students "grad
uated with a credit on the books" and had to get
a check from the Bursar's Office, said Commu
nication Services Manager Anne Crowley.
"That was a headache for the students and the
bursar "
Also, those who were not at Stanford in May
whether they stopped out, graduated early
or left for another reason — complained that
the old system was unfair, Crowley said.

So, beginning with the March phone bill, a
percentage of the charge for each student's bill
able calls will be deducted. That percentage
will be determined separately each month,
Crowley said, hut will probably be comparable
to the 10-11 percent refunded last year
Crowley said the rebate system allows Com
munication Services — which took over in
1990 as the only campus telephone service —
to remain competitive with spe
cial programs offered by compa
nies like MCI, AT&T and Sprint.

Students don't have to call on
weekends or call one person the
most to get a rebate, Crowley
said.
"We feel that with this month
ly rebate we can offer every stu
dent an opportunity to get a lower
rate," she said.
