# CUE seeks out fundamental experiences of education
## 'We must try to answer the question: Is there some core of experiences everyone should have?' 
### Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writer 
It is a question that creeps into the mind
of every student racing through a physics
problem set five minutes before it is due. It
is a question that haunts every undergrad
uate staring at a blank computer screen at
three in the morning.
It lingers over the head of every faculty
member and administrator even tangen
tially related to undergraduate education.
And, as University President Gerhard
Casper told a gathering of reporters last
June, it is the fundamental dilemma that

the Commission on Un
dergraduate Education
must solve:
"What," asked Cas
per, "are we doing here?"
"There isn't one sin
gle answer," said Gary
Ernst, dean of the
School of Earth Sci-

ences. "If there was,
then all of higher education in America
would look the same. But it doesn't, be
cause there are different ways to skin that
academic cat."
Commission chair James Sheehan

agreed. "We have to
start from the fact
that we prepare dif
ferent students to do
different kinds of
things," he said. "A
student who gradu
ates with a degree in
engineering has a
much different expe-

rience from someone in classics."
At the same time, Sheehan acknowl
edged that "we must try to answer the
question: Is there some core of experiences
evervone should have?"

Answering that query, though, requires
an examination of what students want,
what is expected of them and where they
hope to go. As a result, the issue of what,
fundamentally, a Stanford education
should provide remains the meat and pota
toes on the commission's menu.
Agreement on the essentials
There is some agreement on the basic
skills all Stanford graduates should pos
sess, and the commission intends to flesh
them out.

"There are no surprises here,"
Sheehan said, citing "writing and
critical thinking, knowledge of a for
eign language [andj some set of
quantitative proficiencies."
Casper rattled off many of the
same essentials.
"I have often said that first of all
I undergraduate issues) is the ques
tion of intellectual skills," he said.
"That means the ability to analyze
complex issues, identify core prob
lems and a means of solving them
and the ability to communicate
clearly in writing."
Of growing importance, both
claim, is the expectation that all stu
dents possess basic scientific knowl
edge, as the world enters a new era
of dizzying technological advances.
"One thing I worry about is
whether we are doing enough on
these fronts," Sheehan said, in refer
ence to the study of science and tech
nology'.
Ernst argued that undergradu
ates need technical exposure, includ
ing facility with computers, in order

to manage everyday life.
"All students must understand
science and technology, or they will
be incapable of dealing with the
future," he said. "Computer literacy
— yes, that's got to happen."
Casper also maintained that
being adept at comprehending new
technologies will better enable stu
dents to grapple with inevitable
changes in the future.
"Everyone agrees that the time
between major scientific changes is
shortening," he said. "Thus the abil
ity of students to cope with new
knowledge after they graduate from
Stanford is essential."
Clarifying values
But, while most emphasize the
practical skills expected of students
today, there are philosophical ques
tions about values and responsibility
that present more complex, amor
phous difficulties.
They include matters as ostensi
bly simple as how to live with one
another. "Everyone should be
knowledgeable about interpersonal
relationships," Ernst said.
"The more elusive set of goals is
best expressed in the (Cultures,
Ideas and Values) program, and how
the [course] catalog describes it —

namely, as preparation for being an
effective citizen," Sheehan said. "We
have to think very hard about that,
look carefully at the CIV program,
and whether it is fulfilling this goal,
whether it is meeting other goals or
whether we should re-formulate its
purpose."
He added that CIV, together with
the World Cultures and American
Cultures requirements, "represent
the effort to train the student to
examine a set of values."
Casper also pointed to "the abili
ty to clarify values" as an objective of
Stanford learning.
According to senior Eddie Garcia,
chair of the student group conduct
ing a study parallel to the commis
sion's, the attainment of these deep
er ideals and higher purposes has
become for him the foremost objec
tive of undergraduate experience.
"I think undergraduate educa
tion is about... learning about the
world with a goal in mind, to give
back to the community, to go back
and share what you know,"he said.
"But I guess I'm an idealist."
Worrying about jobs
Indeed, the tension between edu
cation for its intrinsic value and for
somewhat more mundane practical

demands is further clouded by the
specter of a shrinking job market
and the sluggish economy that
promises to confront Stanford grad
uates.
"We must be absolutely mindful
that students are also very worried
about jobs — I have no question we
have to keep that in mind," Casper
said.
He pointed to a recent national
survey done by UCLA which showed
that 72 percent of current freshmen
feel that getting a good job is very
important and 59 percent said it is
essential or very important to be
well-off financially.
"There was a time when a Stan
ford degree was a ticket into the mid
dle class — a guarantee of a certain
kind of life," Sheehan said. "People
are much more skeptical about that,
and it would be foolish not to realize
that."
Ruth Schneider, director of the
Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter, said that in general, prospective
employers are "very happy with the
product" the University churns out.
At *he same time, she listed an
array of qualities that recruiters are
looking for in Stanford undergradu
ates. They include facility in prob
lem solving, developing independent

projects, having team skills, leader
ship potential, communication skills
and"the ability to think on your
feet" and converse on any level.
Such demands, she suggested,
call for a degree of specialization in
undergraduate course loads.
'Learning how to learn'
Despite these realities, however,
Sheehan rejects the notion that
Stanford should suddenly assume
the character of a glorified trade
school.
"It's not clear that we should
respond to [these pressures] by
teaching courses solely in computer
programming," he said. "I don't
think that's the sort of preparation a
Stanford education should give
you."
What sort of preparation should
it provide, then? Most feel that,
when all is said and done, a Stanford
education should inspire its students
to study more, explore new avenues
and tap into a wide range of intellec
tual reservoirs.
For Ernst, that means encourag
ing more undergraduates to pursue
advanced degrees. "The important
thing is not to specialize too early
[and] to go on for at least a master's
degree," he said. "You have to have a

master's degree to do anything of
consequence."
While Sheehiin was reluctant to
argue that Stanford undergraduates
should optimally go to graduate
school, he agreed with Ernst's
assessment that Stanford should
prevent students from pigeonholing
themselves.
"I don't think the University
should push students in any particu
lar direction," he said. "But we
should try our best to be sure stu
dents are aware of their options, and
that we give them the advice and
encouragement to make a sensible
decision ... or decide not to decide."
Garcia — who said his group will
likely craft a statement on its per
ception of the central purpose of an
undergraduate education — said
that perhaps an education's greatest
task is to give students the opportu
nity to "learn how to learn."
That ideal, Casper contends,
resides at the heart of Stanford's
mission — technological changes,
curricular reforms and commissions
on undergraduate education aside.
"As important as whatever you
acquire at a university is the ability
to acquire new information," he
said. "It will always be true that
learning is a lifelong endeavor."
It is a question that creeps into the mind

should optimally go to graduate
school, he agreed with Ernst's
assessment that Stanford should
prevent students from pigeonholing
themselves.
"I don't think the University
should push students in any particu
lar direction," he said. "But we
should try our best to be sure stu
dents are aware of their options, and
that we give them the advice and
encouragement to make a sensible
decision ... or decide not to decide."
Garcia — who said his group will
likely craft a statement on its per
ception of the central purpose of an
undergraduate education — said
that perhaps an education's greatest
task is to give students the opportu
nity to "learn how to learn."
That ideal, Casper contends,
resides at the heart of Stanford's
mission — technological changes,
curricular reforms and commissions
on undergraduate education aside.
"As important as whatever you
acquire at a university is the ability
to acquire new information," he
said. "It will always be true that
learning is a lifelong endeavor."
It is a question that creeps into the mind
of every student racing through a physics
problem set five minutes before it is due. It
is a question that haunts every undergrad
uate staring at a blank computer screen at
three in the morning.
It lingers over the head of every faculty
member and administrator even tangen
tially related to undergraduate education.
And, as University President Gerhard
Casper told a gathering of reporters last
June, it is the fundamental dilemma that

the Commission on Un
dergraduate Education
must solve:
"What," asked Cas
per, "are we doing here?"
"There isn't one sin
gle answer," said Gary
Ernst, dean of the
School of Earth Sci-

ences. "If there was,
then all of higher education in America
would look the same. But it doesn't, be
cause there are different ways to skin that
academic cat."
Commission chair James Sheehan

agreed. "We have to
start from the fact
that we prepare dif
ferent students to do
different kinds of
things," he said. "A
student who gradu
ates with a degree in
engineering has a
much different expe-

rience from someone in classics."
At the same time, Sheehan acknowl
edged that "we must try to answer the
question: Is there some core of experiences
evervone should have?"

Answering that query, though, requires
an examination of what students want,
what is expected of them and where they
hope to go. As a result, the issue of what,
fundamentally, a Stanford education
should provide remains the meat and pota
toes on the commission's menu.
Agreement on the essentials
There is some agreement on the basic
skills all Stanford graduates should pos
sess, and the commission intends to flesh
them out.

"There are no surprises here,"
Sheehan said, citing "writing and
critical thinking, knowledge of a for
eign language [andj some set of
quantitative proficiencies."
Casper rattled off many of the
same essentials.
"I have often said that first of all
I undergraduate issues) is the ques
tion of intellectual skills," he said.
"That means the ability to analyze
complex issues, identify core prob
lems and a means of solving them
and the ability to communicate
clearly in writing."
Of growing importance, both
claim, is the expectation that all stu
dents possess basic scientific knowl
edge, as the world enters a new era
of dizzying technological advances.
"One thing I worry about is
whether we are doing enough on
these fronts," Sheehan said, in refer
ence to the study of science and tech
nology'.
Ernst argued that undergradu
ates need technical exposure, includ
ing facility with computers, in order

to manage everyday life.
"All students must understand
science and technology, or they will
be incapable of dealing with the
future," he said. "Computer literacy
— yes, that's got to happen."
Casper also maintained that
being adept at comprehending new
technologies will better enable stu
dents to grapple with inevitable
changes in the future.
"Everyone agrees that the time
between major scientific changes is
shortening," he said. "Thus the abil
ity of students to cope with new
knowledge after they graduate from
Stanford is essential."
Clarifying values
But, while most emphasize the
practical skills expected of students
today, there are philosophical ques
tions about values and responsibility
that present more complex, amor
phous difficulties.
They include matters as ostensi
bly simple as how to live with one
another. "Everyone should be
knowledgeable about interpersonal
relationships," Ernst said.
"The more elusive set of goals is
best expressed in the (Cultures,
Ideas and Values) program, and how
the [course] catalog describes it —

namely, as preparation for being an
effective citizen," Sheehan said. "We
have to think very hard about that,
look carefully at the CIV program,
and whether it is fulfilling this goal,
whether it is meeting other goals or
whether we should re-formulate its
purpose."
He added that CIV, together with
the World Cultures and American
Cultures requirements, "represent
the effort to train the student to
examine a set of values."
Casper also pointed to "the abili
ty to clarify values" as an objective of
Stanford learning.
According to senior Eddie Garcia,
chair of the student group conduct
ing a study parallel to the commis
sion's, the attainment of these deep
er ideals and higher purposes has
become for him the foremost objec
tive of undergraduate experience.
"I think undergraduate educa
tion is about... learning about the
world with a goal in mind, to give
back to the community, to go back
and share what you know,"he said.
"But I guess I'm an idealist."
Worrying about jobs
Indeed, the tension between edu
cation for its intrinsic value and for
somewhat more mundane practical

demands is further clouded by the
specter of a shrinking job market
and the sluggish economy that
promises to confront Stanford grad
uates.
"We must be absolutely mindful
that students are also very worried
about jobs — I have no question we
have to keep that in mind," Casper
said.
He pointed to a recent national
survey done by UCLA which showed
that 72 percent of current freshmen
feel that getting a good job is very
important and 59 percent said it is
essential or very important to be
well-off financially.
"There was a time when a Stan
ford degree was a ticket into the mid
dle class — a guarantee of a certain
kind of life," Sheehan said. "People
are much more skeptical about that,
and it would be foolish not to realize
that."
Ruth Schneider, director of the
Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter, said that in general, prospective
employers are "very happy with the
product" the University churns out.
At *he same time, she listed an
array of qualities that recruiters are
looking for in Stanford undergradu
ates. They include facility in prob
lem solving, developing independent

projects, having team skills, leader
ship potential, communication skills
and"the ability to think on your
feet" and converse on any level.
Such demands, she suggested,
call for a degree of specialization in
undergraduate course loads.
'Learning how to learn'
Despite these realities, however,
Sheehan rejects the notion that
Stanford should suddenly assume
the character of a glorified trade
school.
"It's not clear that we should
respond to [these pressures] by
teaching courses solely in computer
programming," he said. "I don't
think that's the sort of preparation a
Stanford education should give
you."
What sort of preparation should
it provide, then? Most feel that,
when all is said and done, a Stanford
education should inspire its students
to study more, explore new avenues
and tap into a wide range of intellec
tual reservoirs.
For Ernst, that means encourag
ing more undergraduates to pursue
advanced degrees. "The important
thing is not to specialize too early
[and] to go on for at least a master's
degree," he said. "You have to have a

master's degree to do anything of
consequence."
While Sheehiin was reluctant to
argue that Stanford undergraduates
should optimally go to graduate
school, he agreed with Ernst's
assessment that Stanford should
prevent students from pigeonholing
themselves.
