# CUE seeks out fundamental experiences of education
## 'We must try to answer the question: Is there some core of experiences everyone should have?'

It is a question that creeps into the mind
of every student racing through a physics
problem set five minutes before it is due. It
is a question that haunts every undergrad
uate staring at a blank computer screen at
three in the morning.
It lingers over the head of every faculty
member and administrator even tangen
tially related to undergraduate education.
And, as University President Gerhard
Casper told a gathering of reporters last
June, it is the fundamental dilemma that

the Commission on Un
dergraduate Education
must solve:
"What," asked Cas
per, "are we doing here?"
"There isn't one sin
gle answer," said Gary
Ernst, dean of the
School of Earth Sci-

ences. "If there was,
then all of higher education in America
would look the same. But it doesn't, be
cause there are different ways to skin that
academic cat."
Commission chair James Sheehan

agreed. "We have to
start from the fact
that we prepare dif
ferent students to do
different kinds of
things," he said. "A
student who gradu
ates with a degree in
engineering has a
much different expe-

rience from someone in classics."
At the same time, Sheehan acknowl
edged that "we must try to answer the
question: Is there some core of experiences
evervone should have?"

Answering that query, though, requires
an examination of what students want,
what is expected of them and where they
hope to go. As a result, the issue of what,
fundamentally, a Stanford education
should provide remains the meat and pota
toes on the commission's menu.
Agreement on the essentials
There is some agreement on the basic
skills all Stanford graduates should pos
sess, and the commission intends to flesh
them out.
