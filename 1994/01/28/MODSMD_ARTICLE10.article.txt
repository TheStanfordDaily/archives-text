## Heymann resigns top Justice position Deputy attorney general cites differences with Reno 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Deputy Attor
ney General Philip Heymann, a veteran
of four administrations who served as
right-hand man to Janet Reno, resigned
unexpectedly yesterday — a move they
both attributed to differences in manage
ment style and chemistry.
And a special assistant to Reno, Lula
Rodriguez, who is under Justice Depart
ment investigation over alleged vote
fraud in a Miami-area election, also
resigned, spreading turmoil to the top of a
third key Cabinet department.
The sudden moves at Justice followed
recent high-level changes at the Defense
Department, where the secretary
resigned and his proposed replacement
withdrew recently, and the State Depart
ment, where the No. 2 man left last year.
There has been speculation that Reno
herself has fallen from favor in the White
House, which President Clinton denied as
recently as last week. A special counsel
has been named to investigate financial
dealings in Arkansas including some by
the department's No. 3 official, Webster
Hubbell, when he was a law partner to
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Reno, a former state prosecutor, is the
first attorney general in recent memory
to operate without a chief of staff.
Instead, she relied heavily on Heymann,
who served at Justice in the Johnson
administration, worked for the Watergate
special prosecutor during the Nixon

administration and ran Justice's criminal
division during the Carter administra
tion.
Most of Reno's priority programs were
sent to Heymann's office for handling,
including a review of mandatory mini
mum criminal sentences, a report on the
FBl's bloody siege of the Branch Davidian
complex in Waco, Texas, and the depart
ment investigation of Rodriguez, which
was later transferred to the internal
watchdog unit.
Heymann's departure brought an
instant Republican attack on Reno. Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., told reporters,
"The Justice Department ... is being run
by someone who could qualify for the
original amateur hour and who has been
less than what this nation should be
demanding as an attorney general."
At the White House, spokeswoman Dee
Dee Myers denied that the administration
was embarrassed by the resignation. "Cer
tainly not. I think Phil Heymann served
well for a year. I think he made clear what
his reasons were for leaving," she said.
Reno disputed any notion of disarray.
"I think the American people understand
. . . how one goes through the process of
building a team in which people are com
patible, in which their styles are the
same," she said.
Reno and Heymann sat side-by-side to
announce his departure at her regularly
weekly news conference.
