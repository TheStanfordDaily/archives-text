Kevorkian charges dismissed

PONT I AC, Mich. <AP) - Dr Jack
Kevorkian was released from house arrest yes
terday by a judge who overturned Michigan's
ban on assisted suicide and dismissed two of
three charges against him.
Oakland County Circuit Judge Jessica Coop
er was the third judge to reject the ban, put in
effect about a year ago to stop Kevorkian.
The judge dismissed assisted suicide charges
in the Oakland County deaths of a 72-year-old
woman with Lou Gehrig's disease and a (il
year-old man with bone cancer. Both died in
Kevorkian's apartment building last fall.
One charge, over the death of a man with
Lou Gehrig's disease, is pending against
Kevorkian in neighboring Wayne County.
Like Wayne County Circuit Judge Cynthia
Stephens before her, Cooper ruled the state
Legislature violated the state constitution when
it passed the assisted suicide ban because it
tacked on a felony provision to a bill intended to
set up a commission to study death and dying.
The previous rulings striking down the law
in Wayne County are being appealed. Assistant
Oakland County Prosecutor Errol Shifman said
his office would appeal Cooper's ruling.

Elvis worship a religion?

(AIM â€” A British television documentary mak
ing its U.S. premiere tonight raises the question
of whether Elvis worship h>-us become a religion.
"The King and Me," produced by Tullstar Pro
ductions and part of the weekly series "The
Human Factor," will Ik> shown on The Faith and
Values Channel. The cable network, which reach
es 20 million homes, will show the half-hour doc
umentary again on Monday and next Thursday.
How well the late rock 'n' roll superstar has
stayed alive in the popular imagination is indicat
ed in the alleged sightings of Flvis regularly
reported in supermarket tabloids. "The Two
Kings," a new book from Bantam Books, satirizes
the phenomenon by comparing Elvis to Jesus.
Depending on how the question is worded,
several national polls in recent years have
found from 6 percent to 16 percent of Ameri
cans believe Elvis still may be alive.
"The King and Me" producers estimate up to
a million people worldwide are devoted follow
ers of Elvis. Those interviewed make it clear
they do not consider FHvis to be God, and some
note Elvis himself would discourage such spec
ulation.
