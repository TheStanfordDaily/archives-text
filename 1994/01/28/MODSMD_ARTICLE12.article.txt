PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Her

the U.S. Figure Skating Association
have said Harding could be removed

attack.

planned assault on Nancy Kerrigan,"
Harding said. "I am responsible, how
ever, for failing to report things 1
learned about the assault when I
returned home from nationals.
"Many of you will be unable to for
give me for that," she said. "It will be
difficult for me to forgive myself."
Her statement came as her ex-hus
band, Jeff Gillooly, spoke to investiga
tors for the second consecutive day in
what a source said was an attempt to

cut a deal in exchange for implicating
Harding in the Jan. 6 attack.
Harvey Schiller, executive director
of the USOC, issued a statement say
ing the organization "is deeply con
cerned with statements made today by
Tonya Harding relative to her stated
knowledge of the attack on Nancy Ker
rigan at the national championships."
The figure skating association said
Harding would be on the list of official
entries in the Lillehammer Games
submitted to the USOC, but the asso
ciation has appointed a hearing panel

to investigate, a first step in the pro
cess that could lead to her removal
from the team.
The USOC noted that the women's
figure skating roster can be changed as
late as Feb. 21.
Schiller said Harding's name would
be on the U.S. roster submitted to
international Olympic officials Jan.
31, but added that the USOC "is pre
pared under constitutional proce
dures, to initiate any action deemed
appropriate relative to the conduct of
any athlete entered in the Games."
