# Chicken pox vaccine proven safe
## FDA panel completes tests; final approval still pending 
### 
BETHESDA, Md. (AP) — A vaccine for chicken
pox, long awaited by parents, moved a step closer to
market yesterday.
An advisory committee to the Food and Drug
Administration decided the experimental vaccine
has proven safe and effective for use by children
and adults, but the FDA still must approve the vat
cine.
The panel stopped short of recommending imme
diate FDA approval of the vaccine, saying some ques
tions remained unanswered, including whether to
give children one shot or two and whether it could Ix
given at the same time as children get their measles
immunizations.
"It will save lives, lives that are precious and can
never be replaced," said Rebecca Cole, a North Caroli
na woman who has fought for approval of the vaccine
since her 12-year-old son died of chicken pox in 198.5.
Chicken pox afflicts about 4 million people a year,
mostly children. Typically, it's a nuisance disease,
keeping bump-covered children out of school and
their parents out of work for about a week. Some doc
tors have contended a vaccine is unnecessary.
But chicken pox can be deadly in infants, adults
and people with immune problems. It kills up to 90
people a year and hospitalizes another 9,000.
A chicken pox vaccine has been used in high-risk
children in Japan for 20 years with no known ill
effects and for almost 10 years there in healthy chil
dren. Japanese figures show only one or two percent

of the vaccinated children contract chicken pox.
Merck & Co. is seeking FDA approval to market in
the United States a chicken pox vaccine called Vari
v;ix, which is made of the same strain of chicken pox
virus that the Japanese vaccine uses.
As with any vaccine, it has some mild side effects,
typically redness or swelling of the vaccine site, said
Merck scientist Dr. Jo Whitr.
Merck officials produced studies of 11,000 people
who had received the vaccine. The few who later con
tracted chicken pox got very mild cases, company offi
cials said.
The advisory committee said Merck proved the
vaccine was effective over the short term but may not
protect adequately for more than four or five years.
"The need for booster shots has not been deter
mined," said the FDA's Dr. Phillip Krause. The advi
sory committee agreed and said the government and
Merck should immediately study whether everyone
would need a booster shot.
Another question about the vaccine is whether it
affects the number of people who get shingles, a very
painful rash caused when the chicken pox virus con
tinues to live within its victims and resurfaces
decades later.
The FDA has not set a date to consider whether to
approve the vaccine, but officials said privately it
could come soon. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention is poised to approve guidelines for use of
the vaccine next month.
