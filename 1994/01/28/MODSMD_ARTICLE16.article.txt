Does Stanford have a
persecution complex? When
high-level University admin
istrators were putting the finishing
touches on a report on the status of
women faculty at Stanford last fall,
it was proposed to keep the study's
findings confidential.
After all, it was a report for the
provost and the results weren't
exactly anything to brag about:
Stanford was lagging behind other
schools in the recruitment of
women faculty. Female professors
and staffers were quoted as saying
that the University creates a hostile
environment for women.
The administrators feared that if
they released the report, media
attention to the problem would
smudge Stanford's image and scare
away potential women faculty.
Although the report was eventu
ally made public, the incident illus
trates something even more unflat
tering about the University than its
dearth of women faculty — its lack
of openness.
Stanford has a long tradition of
involving faculty in LTniversity
affairs, including staff members
and students in policy-making deci
sions, making the Stanford commu
nity part of the process — and let
ting them know what's going on.
Many argue this is what makes
Stanford unique — why we're dif
ferent from other universities and
corporate America. But this year,
that openness has given way to a
siege mentality where input is
seemingly unwanted and spin con
trol is the top priority.
Faculty, staff and students have
been largely disenfranchised in the
current budget-cutting process. In
previous years, Stanford formed
committees of faculty and students
to provide input and advice. Admin
istrators would be forthright about
what changes they were consider
ing. And although the process was
assailed by some as too political, at
least decision-makers didn't seem
to fear constructive criticism.
The University shouldn't fear
negative news as if it were a death
knell. It should be an opportunity
to publicly face the facts and com
mit to change.
Now, though, most members of
the Stanford community believe

their input will fall on deaf ears.
The feeling of family, of dealing
with a crisis as a group, has faded.
Everyone is simply waiting for deci
sions to come from the top.
It didn't start — and it won't end
— with budget cuts. Many were
upset with the scant input that was
solicited during the drafting of the
new sexual harassment policy. It's
becoming more difficult for stu
dents to meet with administrators.
University departments refuse to
release their budgets.
This dread of public scrutiny is
rubbing off on students as well. At
recent meetings of ethnic commu
nities, student leaders attempted to
exclude Daily reporters from cover
ing the proceedings. Let us give you
a call and tell you what happened
after the meeting is over, they told
me. The message was clear. They
didn't want to risk negative press.
There's a danger in this behavior.
When organizations repeatedly
refuse to accept questions and criti
cism, and only discuss matters on
their terms, the public slowly
begins to lose interest. In times
such as these, it is important that
the Stanford community and The
Daily itself be especially mindful of
being lulled into complacency.
In Stanford's classrooms, stu
dents are taught to question, to
learn, to become involved. Ironical
ly, outside the lecture hall, faculty,
staff members and other students
are learning to sit passively as
changes occur, unable to question,
unable to become involved.
How should Stanford deal with
this problem? Robert Rosensweig, a
former president of the American
Association of Universities and
adviser to former University Presi
dent Richard Lyman, summed it up
rather well:
"When people say they have an
image problem, it is overwhelming
ly likely that they really have a real
ity problem," he said. "Attend to
substance, and soon enough the
appearances will take care of them
selves."
