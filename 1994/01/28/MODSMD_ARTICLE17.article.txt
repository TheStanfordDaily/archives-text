## Toss the pre-fab, bucko! 
### 
WHAT A LONG, strange trip it's
been. . . . Last time I noticed, it
was October. Next thing I know
it's almost February and The Daily's edi
tors are saying, "You're outta here."
Funny how time flies when you've got
a weekly deadline.
So here we are, my last column. I had
this big, inspiring valedictory message all
ready, but then I realized that it was the
same one from my high-school gradua
tion. I wondered why I was starting a col
umn with "Parents, members of the
school board . . .
Scratch that one. Besides, I've never
been inspirational, so why should I start
now?
Then I thought 1 should end on a
cheerful note. Chris Golde did a beautiful
job of that last week, though, and there's
really no point in doing a poor imitation.
That would be so cheap.
I do have a few loose ends to tie up.
(Or, in my case, "split ends." But that's
another story.)
I want to give a nod to my adoring
public (Hi, Grandma!). You've been ter
rific. I never would have made it to this
breathtaking literary pinnacle without
you.
I'd like to give a dainty little curtsy to
my critics, too. They have charged me
with wasting this forum, this chance for
searing social criticism. Well, golly! I'm
shocked! Here I was, thinking that writ
ing columns about sneezing was going

to change the world. I'm so disillu
sioned.
But I think that's just it — many of us
are getting to be a tad disillusioned. The
old pre-fab ideologies and social type
casting are wearing a little thin. We're
beginning to notice that in spite of our
best intentions and worst rhetoric, we're
not changing much of anything, includ
ing each other's opinions. We can give up
and all become a bunch of morose
accountants for the I.R.S. . . .
Or we can laugh.
(You knew this sermon was coming,
didn't you? Well, it's my last column and
I'm entitled.)
This issue's columnists prove my
point exactly. We've all had a few fans
and a number of self-appointed judges.
There have been right-wing, left-wing,
intense and literary columns . . . and me.
I guess I'm supposed to be the chaser for
all that deep thought. At any rate, this
page has seen a real diversity of opinion
no matter what you think of the way it
was expressed. None of us fit well into the
stock roles that Stanford society wants to
assign us.
Yet, even though there are the colum
nists and innumerable other people who
don't fit the mold, the thought police still
have a stranglehold on our campus. I'm
not talking about political correctness —
it's only half of the problem. I'm talking
about the professors and students and
TAs and RAs who demand that we spout

a given message all the time.
There's the liberal speech and the con
servative speech, with minor adjust
ments for the specific topic. There's the
"alternative" lifestyle and the Greek or
Greek-oid one. There isn't a lot of room
for creativity after our lives have been
packed with these and other ready-made
agendas.
The thing is, it's all pretty gosh-darn
silly. Take a step back. Look at us from
an outsider's perspective for a minute.
We rush around, pouring our hearts into
other people's words which we recite
whenever we can. We pride ourselves on
our political awareness, no matter where
we are on the spectrum, and feel guilty if
we give up a chance to rant.
I didn't use this column as a political
forum because we've all heard it before.
Other people writing in this issue did a
better job than I would have, especially
when my heart's not in it. What 1 did try
to do was to point out some of the things
that make us ridiculous, lovable and
human.
I'm not a nihilist. I believe it's possible
to work for change. But to do it in good
faith I think we also must remember that
whatever our efforts, we cannot escape
being merely human and wonderfully
inane.
