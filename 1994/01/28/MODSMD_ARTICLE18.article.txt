## Bosnian genocide is affront to University's value system 
### 
DO YOU RECOGNIZE that geno
cide is being committed against the
citizens of Bosnia?
I posed the question to University
President Gerhard Casper as we chatted
hurriedly in the middle of the Quad. The
question is not insignificant. Since the
start of the latest Balkan War, approxi
mately 200,000 people have been killed
and 3.5 million refugees created. Yet,
apart from a handful of intellectuals, the
response from the academic community
has been inaudible.
Why should Bosnia concern us any
way? The war in Bosnia stands as a direct
challenge to much of what is taught here.
To students of international relations
and history, Serbia's unabated quest for
territory and its sponsorship of genocide
to attain this goal defies the UN system
of "multilateralism" and raises serious
doubts of the feasibility of "collective
security." In response to Serbian fascism,
the United States has done little more
than offer new currency to the terms
"appeasement" and "isolationism."
To students of social psychology, law,
ethics and applied philosophy, the debate

over Bosnia's right to self-defense raises
questions over the very sense in which
such rights may be described as "inher
ent."
To all of us, the concept of
"bystander" takes on new relevance as
we too, through our silence, desecrate the
moral imperative of the post-Holocaust
era: "Never Again."
Why is the academic world so reluc
tant to condemn those responsible for
this genocide?
Casper explained why he, as University
president, could not speak out on this
issue. He believes that the university
should be an inviting, participatory forum
for all students. His concern is to encour
age a pluralistic community and a "mar
ketplace of ideas." He therefore refuses on
principle to endorse political causes.
As a future educator, I share his con
cerns for pluralism and openness. Yet I
am extremely disturbed by the presi
dent's inability to respond to a genocide
which has been denounced by the World
Court, the Pope, the Jewish and Muslim
communities and respectable human
rights organizations such as Refugees

International.
Casper admitted that there may come
a moment when he would have to put
aside his principles as University presi
dent and follow his own conscience.
"What would that take?" I asked.
Stanford, as an institution, has taken
a political stand in the past. Not that long
ago it divested from South Africa. The
president for his part is always prepared
to speak out on Holocaust Remembrance
Day. While he was sympathetic to the
plight of the Bosnians and recognized the
immorality of the Serbian-Croatian pro
posal to partition Bosnia on ethnic lines,
Casper stopped short of denouncing
genocide.
The response troubled me. Few of us
would suggest that apartheid and fascism
are ever justifiable or tolerable. I believe
that Dr. Casper the individual agrees
with me — but that is not enough. More
over, I am sure that he recognizes that
Stanford is far from the kind of pluralis
tic forum he envisages.
The analogy of the university as a
shopping market where students are free
to endorse products of their choice has

many shortcomings. First, the university
is not and cannot be an apolitical setting.
Second, the assumption that all ideas are
equal often provides a cloak of legitimacy
for Holocaust revisionists and those like
the Serbian nationalist News Analysis
Group. They argue for a platform from
which they spread falsehoods that spring
from hatred, racism and antisemitism.
As a policy analyst, I came to Stanford
to gain further knowledge with a view to
applying it to the real world. This is a
critical moment for the University. Stan
ford's response will determine whether it
is an ivory tower, blind to the realities of
genocide, mass rape and ethnic engineer
ing — or a true center of knowledge.
A "Great University" should be able to
recognize the contradictions which the
destruction of Bosnia poses to our value
system and intellectual traditions. Surely
the mission of the university should be to
align itself politically when necessary,
rather than ignoring the significance of
real world events. It is necessary now!
