# University cap on grad income is paternalistic
## 
### 
Chris Golde's column yesterday was
right on the mark. I would like to add to
her comments a couple of problems con
cerning graduate financing that she did
not discuss.
Golde notes that many graduate stu
dents seek to supplement their incomes in
several ways, including part-time jobs. I
have been employed for over a year in the
Stacks Division at Green Library to earn
extra money.
According to the policy of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, however, I am
restricted to working eight hours per

week. And recently, when a graduate resi
dent assistant position opened up in Man
zanita Park, where I live, I discovered that
I was ineligible for any additional paid
employment. This, I was told by one of
the deans, was for my own benefit: the
University does not want its graduate stu
dents to be overburdened with outside
commitments
I was fairly outraged by the paternalism
of such a comment. In the first place, nei
ther my library wages or a graduate resi
dent assistant salary comes as a gratuity;
they are given for services rendered. In the
second place, many graduate students
have non-academic time commitments and
obligations. Some participate in music
groups or service organizations; some even
raise families. The University, fortunately,

does not see any need to interfere with
such activities. But that it should first
define and then enforce a maximum
income level adds insult to injury.
This income level also restricts one's
ability to obtain student loans. Having
recently experienced difficulty making
ends meet, I thought I might apply for a
small student loan, deferring some of my
financial burden until I graduate.
No such luck! I didn't get beyond the
front desk of the Financial Aids OfFice
before I was told that I couldn't get any
loans at all, my stipend being more than
my fictive "expenses." Supposedly, I don't
need any more money. That I am under
financial stress is clear enough to me!
I do recognize and appreciate that at
Stanford, many students are better-sup

ported than elsewhere. But the "gap" con
tributes mightily to the stress of being a
graduate student, it interferes with one's
attention to research and teaching, and I
suspect that it discourages many scholars
from finishing their degrees, however
much they love their work.
To what extent do financial factors
affect the attrition rate among graduate
students? Why aren't there exit surveys to
determine the causes of dropping out? I
consider the lack of such surveys not only
academically negligent, but — if funded
graduate students leave their programs
after two or three years, due at least part
ly to economic strains — financially irre
sponsible as well.
