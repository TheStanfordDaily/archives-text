The choice of Yale Law School
professor and noted constitution
al law .scholar Stephen L. Carter
as this year's Commencement
speaker has met with rave re
views from the Law School but
ambivalence from the masses.
Carter, a 1976 Stanford gradu
ate, is the William Nelson
Cromwell Professor of Law at
Yale Law School and author of
two widely acclaimed books. "Re
flections of an Affirmative Action
Baby" offers a critique of affirma
tive action policies, and his most
recent work, "The Culture of Dis
belief," examines the relationship
between religion and American
government.
Dean of the Law School Paul
BreÂ»t said he held Carter in high
regard and was pleased with the
choice.
