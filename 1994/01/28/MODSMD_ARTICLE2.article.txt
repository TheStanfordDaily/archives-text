The choice of Yale Law School
professor and noted constitution
al law .scholar Stephen L. Carter
as this year's Commencement
speaker has met with rave re
views from the Law School but
ambivalence from the masses.
Carter, a 1976 Stanford gradu
ate, is the William Nelson
Cromwell Professor of Law at
Yale Law School and author of
two widely acclaimed books. "Re
flections of an Affirmative Action
Baby" offers a critique of affirma
tive action policies, and his most
recent work, "The Culture of Dis
belief," examines the relationship
between religion and American
government.
Dean of the Law School Paul
Bre»t said he held Carter in high
regard and was pleased with the
choice.
"l think it's terrific," he said,
adding that the Law School has
been trying independently to per
suade Carter to come to Stanford
to speak about the views
expressed in his recent book on
religion and his work in progress
about the congressional confirma
tion process.
Law Prof. Kathleen Sullivan, a
noted constitutional law scholar,
pointed out in praise of Carter
that "very few law professors have
written one . . . blockbuster non

fiction book . . . much less two."
Sullivan added that President
Clinton's mention of "The Cul
ture of Disbelief' in a speech last
year makes Carter the only law
professor whose work is "recom
mended reading" from Clinton.
But despite the enthusiasm of
legal scholars, some members of the
senior class were not as impressed
with the choice of Carter.
Senior Andrew Byrnes, politi
cal director of the Stanford
Democrats, said he was "some
what disappointed." He said
recent moves by what he
described as a conservative Uni
versity administration made him
suspicious at "the selection of a

somewhat obscure speaker . . .
who just happens to be a conser
vative himself."
In his book on affirmative
action, Carter agreed that some of
his views could be labeled conser
vative but pointed out that his
views in other areas "are suffi
ciently to the left that I do not
imagine the conservative move
ment would want me." His lack of
an ideological niche, Carter wrote,
"is fine with me, for it is best for
intellectuals to be politically
unpredictable."
Brest also resisted the tempta
tion to pigeonhole Carter. "I
think his views are somewhat
ambivalent. I'm not certain I

agree with him, but I certainly
respect him."
Byrnes also said he was disap
pointed that a more widely known
speaker was not chosen. "There's
been concern in the past . . . that,
given the caliber of the school, we
haven't really pulled the big
names," he said.
Dana Weeks, one of the senior
class presidents, said Stanford
students' disappointment with
Carter's selection left her "really
unimpressed with the student
body" in light of Carter's distinc
tion in academic circles.
"I don't think that this 'house
hold name' thing sits with me,"
Weeks said. She added that

"household names" like Michael
Jackson, Tonya Harding and
Lorena Bobbitt would make
unsuitable commencement speak
ers.
Weeks denied the claim that
the choice was made based on
Carter's affirmative action ideolo
gy, saying that the people
involved in the recommendation
all have different views.
Senior Meaghan Reilly said
that while she had never heard of
Carter, her satisfaction would
depend on what the speaker has
to say. She pointed out that
Whoopi Goldberg, though
famous, had not been an impres
sive Centennial speaker.

"Sure, it's nice to have some
one famous ... if they have some
thing valuable to say."
Senior Scott Lundberg said he
didn't know who Carter was, but
"he sounded like a pretty sharp
guy" and he was satisfied with the
choice. However, Lundberg said
he "certainly would have enjoyed
[hearing] someone more famous."
Senior Mariko Ishimori said,
"I've heard [Carter's] name . . .
but I don't really know who he
is."
Carter was chosen from a list
of 16 possible speakers submitted
by the senior class presidents to
University President Gerhard
Casper.
