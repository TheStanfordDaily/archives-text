# Stanford scholars on Clinton's first year
## Clinton's intended revolution anything but sweeping John H. Bunzel

Make no mistake about
it: the ideological conservatives
who defended Ronald Reagan
against all comers and were willing to
forgive him for just about anything are
prepared to wage a relentless attack on
President Clinton because they see
him (as they never saw Jimmy Carter
or Walter Mondale or Michael
Dukakis) as the most formidable
adversary they have faced since
Eranklin Roosevelt was in the White
House.
In their view, Mr. Clinton repre-

_ sents a massive
assault on every
thing they hold

dear, including the cardinal principle
of Reaganism — that government is
the problem, not the solution. "New
Democrat" or old, the President is
112 iercely opposed not because of topical
issues like Whitewater or Troopergate
but because (among other reasons) he
is committed to the unpardonable sin
of wanting to use government to help
solve problems a majority of Americans
want solved.
Take the problem of health care. I
am old enough to remember that every
time in the last 50 years proposals for
universal health coverage were intro
duced by the Democrats in Congress,
Republican cries of "socialized

medicine" were heard across the land
and that ended that.
But not now. The political climate
has changed. The Republicans,
although opposed to Clinton's health
care, want to "reframe" the debate and
offer a serious alternative.
The smartest of the Republicans
understand that if universal access to
health insurance is approved, as The
New York Times' E.J. Dionne, Jr. has
said, the middle class will never allow
it to be repealed, just as it never
allowed Social Security or Medicare to
be wiped off the books. That's another
reason Republicans view Mr. Clinton
as a dangerous political threat.
President Clinton has also scored a
political victory by outflanking the
law-and-order Republicans on such
issues as crime and welfare. He has
successfully taken on the National
Rifle Association and made "war on
violence" a major commitment. Equal
ly important, he has not allowed con
servatives to continue to monopolize
(lie "welfare issue."
Instead, he has taken the lead in
defining the goal of his public assis
tance programs as "moving people out
of dependency and into work." And,
once again, he has opened up for public
debate the issue of what government
should (and shouldn't) do to help those

who need help.
Clinton meant it when he promised
to bring about "changes" in America. I
will not list here all of his legislative
accomplishments in 1993, from the
earned-income tax credit and family
leave bill (that George Bush vetoed) to

publicly funded family planning clinics
where discussion of abortion is now an
option. And remember all the talk
about gridlock? Gone.
This is not to say, however, that
there has been a "Clinton Revolution"
similar to the Reagan Revolution of
1981, when (as the Wall Street Journal
has observed) scores of strongly ideo
logical appointees "chartered a course

for the country far different from the
one it had been on."
The fact is the pace of change under
Mr. Clinton has been anything but
sweeping, largely because the political
left in the Democratic Party has lost its
leverage in the face of a rightward turn
in voter sentiment in last year's elec
tions.
Still, the good news from Mr. Clin
ton's vantage point is that in one year
he has sought to change the govern
ment's role and direction, to override
the conservative Reagan-Bush era, and
to reform and move beyond the old
style "welfare state" liberalism with
which the Democratic Party has been
so long identified.
But there is bad news too. I leave
aside specific foreign policy issues,
such as whether the president's trum
peting of nuclear non-proliferation as a
bedrock principle will result in his
stopping the North Korean nuclear
bomb program. The larger global prob
lem is that he has yet to develop a
grand strategy to deal with the post-
Cold War world.
Another uneasy but persistent con
cern is a cloud floating over the presi
dent's head. Mr. Clinton is viewed by
millions of voters as

falling short of the
high ethical

standards he set for himself. For all of
his high intelligence and political
skills, there continue to be nagging
suspicions about his truthfulness and
his personal values — the issue of cred
ibility, to which Republicans are likely
to direct some of their strongest criti
cism. Thus far, however, the negative
stories about the Clintons' business
dealings and the President's personal
life are considered by the voters to be
of only modest importance.
An "iffy" prediction: If President
Clinton succeeds in getting most of his
legislative program through Congress;
and if his approval ratings remain high
(presently around 60 percent); and if
more voters continue to approve rather
than disapprove of the job he is doing
— in particular, his handling of the
economy, for which he will get either
credit or blame — he will be re-elected
in 1996.
Those are big "ifs." But in politics
more things are contingent than cer
tain — which is why I distrust predic
tions, especially about the future.
