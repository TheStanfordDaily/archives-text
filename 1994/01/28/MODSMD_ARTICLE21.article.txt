# Financing Clinton's goal
## Universal health care Victor R. Fuchs 
### 
THE RECENT CALL by sev
eral governors for a state
by-state approach to
health-care reform has a readily
understandable appeal. We are a
large, heterogeneous nation. We
have a federal system of govern
ment. Most health care is locally
produced and delivered. Most
Americans, myself included, fear
the growth of a huge, centralized
bureaucracy. Finally, a state-by
state approach permits more flex
ibility and experimentation
There is just one overriding

problem. A
state-based

system can
not realize President Clinton's
goal of universal coverage that is
equitably financed. Such an
approach may begin with high
hopes, but over time it will self
destruct because it is so easy for
individuals and business firms to
move across state lines.
Imagine two neighboring
states such as California and Ari
zona, which differ in the health
benefits they offer and in the level
of taxes or mandated premiums
required to support those bene
fits. The sick, the disabled and the
elderly will understandably be
attracted to the state with the
generous benefits. The healthy,
the young, and individuals and
firms who wish to avoid costly
taxes and mandates will prefer the
other state.
At first the differential migra
tion may be small, but it will set
in motion a political and econom
ic dynamic that will increase
rapidly. In the state with gener
ous benefits, differential migra
tion will lead to higher health
expenditures, an eroding tax base
and higher tax rates. The other
state will experience lower expen
ditures, an expanding tax base
and lower tax rates. Thus the
incentive to migrate will grow,
and the expenditure and tax dif
ferentials will get ever larger.
Consider the experience of Cal
ifornia, with its generous pro
gram of Aid to Families With
Dependent Children. This state,
with only 12 percent of the U.S.
population, accounts for more
than 25 percent of the nation's
AFDC payments. It is not surpris
ing that the effective tax rate on
residential property in Los Ange
les is double the average of the
nation's 50 largest cities, nor is it
surprising that even California
based firms are building their
new plants in neighboring states.
New York City has followed a
similar scenario of generous ben
efits, exploding welfare caseloads
and a shrinking tax base. In order
to combine compassion with effi
ciency, some problems must be
approached nationally.
Advocates of a state-by-state
approach to health insurance
point to Hawaii to support their
case, but that state's situation is
exceptional. Hawaii is separated
from the mainland by almost
2,500 miles of ocean, and its econ
omy is based primarily on tourism
and defense installations. Most
other states are much more vul
nerable to migration of individu
als and firms. Consider, for
instance, the greater possibilities
and incentives for movement
between Massachusetts and New

care deliv
ery. The
key to wise
health poli
cy is to
make a
sharp dis
tinction
between the
delivery of
health care
and the
financing of
health
insura nee,
between
what
should be
kept decen
tralized and
what must
become the
responsibil-

Hampshire, or New York and New
Jersey, or Illinois and Indiana.

The need for a national system
of finance becomes evident when
we realize that there are only two
reasons why 35 million Ameri
cans are uninsured. First, most of
them are too poor or too sick to
afford insurance. Second, there
are those who can afford to pay
but are unwilling to do so. To
achieve universal coverage, there
must be subsidization for the first
group and compulsion for the see
oHd. No 1 state, br 'nation, 6kn
achieve universal coverage with
out subsidization and compul
sion. The challenge is to find a
stable, equitable financing mech
anism that accomplishes both
objectives.
In my judgment, a national
value-added tax, earmarked for
health insurance, offers the best
combination of efficiency and
fairness. It is more efficient than
a payroll tax, which discourages
hiring by discriminating against
labor. It is preferable to an
income tax because it encourages
rather than discourages saving. It
is fair because no family can
escape its impact through tax
loopholes, and the burden rises
roughly in proportion to family
spending. But it must be uniform
across the nation.
Higher taxes on cigarettes and
alcohol can contribute to financ
ing health care while discourag
ing harmful behaviors, but their
revenue potential can only sup
plement a value-added tax, not
replace it. Moreover, the "sin
taxes" will be most effective if
they are uniform across the
nation in order to prevent evasion
through cross-state purchasing.
While financing must be cen
tralized, the governors are correct
in asserting that the organization
and delivery of care can and
should be decentralized. The
diversity among states in geogra
phy, population size and density
and cultural norms suggest that
it would be foolish to try to
impose a uniform national system
of health

ity of the federal government

THE RECENT CALL by sev
eral governors for a state
by-state approach to
health-care reform has a readily
understandable appeal. We are a
large, heterogeneous nation. We
have a federal system of govern
ment. Most health care is locally
produced and delivered. Most
Americans, myself included, fear
the growth of a huge, centralized
bureaucracy. Finally, a state-by
state approach permits more flex
ibility and experimentation
There is just one overriding

problem. A
state-based

system can
not realize President Clinton's
goal of universal coverage that is
equitably financed. Such an
approach may begin with high
hopes, but over time it will self
destruct because it is so easy for
individuals and business firms to
move across state lines.
Imagine two neighboring
states such as California and Ari
zona, which differ in the health
benefits they offer and in the level
of taxes or mandated premiums
required to support those bene
fits. The sick, the disabled and the
elderly will understandably be
attracted to the state with the
generous benefits. The healthy,
the young, and individuals and
firms who wish to avoid costly
taxes and mandates will prefer the
other state.
At first the differential migra
tion may be small, but it will set
in motion a political and econom
ic dynamic that will increase
rapidly. In the state with gener
ous benefits, differential migra
tion will lead to higher health
expenditures, an eroding tax base
and higher tax rates. The other
state will experience lower expen
ditures, an expanding tax base
and lower tax rates. Thus the
incentive to migrate will grow,
and the expenditure and tax dif
ferentials will get ever larger.
Consider the experience of Cal
ifornia, with its generous pro
gram of Aid to Families With
Dependent Children. This state,
with only 12 percent of the U.S.
population, accounts for more
than 25 percent of the nation's
AFDC payments. It is not surpris
ing that the effective tax rate on
residential property in Los Ange
les is double the average of the
nation's 50 largest cities, nor is it
surprising that even California
based firms are building their
new plants in neighboring states.
New York City has followed a
similar scenario of generous ben
efits, exploding welfare caseloads
and a shrinking tax base. In order
to combine compassion with effi
ciency, some problems must be
approached nationally.
Advocates of a state-by-state
approach to health insurance
point to Hawaii to support their
case, but that state's situation is
exceptional. Hawaii is separated
from the mainland by almost
2,500 miles of ocean, and its econ
omy is based primarily on tourism
and defense installations. Most
other states are much more vul
nerable to migration of individu
als and firms. Consider, for
instance, the greater possibilities
and incentives for movement
between Massachusetts and New

care deliv
ery. The
key to wise
health poli
cy is to
make a
sharp dis
tinction
between the
delivery of
health care
and the
financing of
health
insura nee,
between
what
should be
kept decen
tralized and
what must
become the
responsibil-

Hampshire, or New York and New
Jersey, or Illinois and Indiana.

The need for a national system
of finance becomes evident when
we realize that there are only two
reasons why 35 million Ameri
cans are uninsured. First, most of
them are too poor or too sick to
afford insurance. Second, there
are those who can afford to pay
but are unwilling to do so. To
achieve universal coverage, there
must be subsidization for the first
group and compulsion for the see
oHd. No 1 state, br 'nation, 6kn
achieve universal coverage with
out subsidization and compul
sion. The challenge is to find a
stable, equitable financing mech
anism that accomplishes both
objectives.
In my judgment, a national
value-added tax, earmarked for
health insurance, offers the best
combination of efficiency and
fairness. It is more efficient than
a payroll tax, which discourages
hiring by discriminating against
labor. It is preferable to an
income tax because it encourages
rather than discourages saving. It
is fair because no family can
escape its impact through tax
loopholes, and the burden rises
roughly in proportion to family
spending. But it must be uniform
across the nation.
Higher taxes on cigarettes and
alcohol can contribute to financ
ing health care while discourag
ing harmful behaviors, but their
revenue potential can only sup
plement a value-added tax, not
replace it. Moreover, the "sin
taxes" will be most effective if
they are uniform across the
nation in order to prevent evasion
through cross-state purchasing.
While financing must be cen
tralized, the governors are correct
in asserting that the organization
and delivery of care can and
should be decentralized. The

phy, population size and density
and cultural norms suggest that
