# White House image improves over year
## After Gergen joins, the 'public relations operative is not seen, and not heard' Steven Chaffee 
### 
ONE WAY of looking at Bill Clinton's
presidency is m terms of its relations
with the media. The first year can he
divided rather cleanly into two phases:
Before Gergen, and After Gergen.
The appointment to the White House staff
of David Gergen abruptly ended a series of
public misadventures, and the president has
been mostly on track with the press since.
Even before Clinton took office some

, newspaper columnists
were declaring his admin-

istration a failure. Early
on his staff publicized the search for candi
dates for Cabinet positions, and several
prominent nominees could not pass all the
litmus tests. Major positions remained
unfilled.
The president seemed to reporters uncer-

tain of his priori
ties. He was
being sucked
into embarrass
ing struggles
with his own
people over plans
that he had
scarcely men
tioned in his
1992 campaign.
By May of
1993 the per
centage saying
they "approved"
of the job Clin
ton was doing as
President was no
higher than the
43 percent that
had voted for
him It is hard to
govern when you

are seen as lack

inn public support. Knter (terpen.
A great public relations operative is not
seen, and not heard. The audible dither of
indecision that had been emanating from the
White House ceased abruptly when Gergen
joined the team.
He brought in a thorough understanding
of two counterforces. First, he understands
the media, not so much because he was a
journalist — he had, rather, been a TV com

mentator — but because in prior Republican
administrations he gained experience in
working opposite the press. Second, Gergen
understands how Republican leaders will
respond to events and issues. An ability to
anticipate the other side's perspective is
invaluable to a politician.
It is possible to attribute too much to Ger
gen, or to any one person. Perhaps it has
been someone else on Clinton's staff who has
understood how to neutralize Ross Perot, for
example. Clinton's two famous successes
have been pushing through his budget bill,
which implemented Perot's campaign
demand to cut the deficit, and the North
American Free Trade Act (NAFTA), which
was sponsored by George Bush and other
Republicans and which Perot fought long
and loud. Clinton has received good marks
from the press for both these victories, and
Perot's star is in eclipse.
We should not think of "the media" as
monolithic. First, there are local publishers
of major daily newspapers, an autocratic and
thoroughly conservative ensemble. They
have applauded, in their editorials, both the
deficit reduction effort and NAFTA. Some of
them might even endorse Clinton in his next
campaign, which is of course already under
way.
Second, there are the East Coast colum
nists and television commentators, an elite
corps that tends to be politically internation
alist and economically market-oriented, "hey
applauded the NAFTA victory, although
attributing more than is reasonable to the
debating skills of Vice President Albert Gore.
These phrasemakers admire winners, and
they are still looking for Clinton to assert
strong leadership abroad.
Finally, there are the beat reporters who
cover politics. Many of them are, like other
educated working people, liberal on domestic
issues. But they try not to let their politics
intrude on their journalism, and they appre
ciate being treated as friends. Ronald Reagan
got on famously with them, George Bush less
so.
They are still wondering just how much of
a leader BUI Clinton can be, and whether he
is a good guy. Daily they test him with
embarrassing questions, and occasionally he
responds testily. The president cannot expect

an easy ride if Whitewatergate turns out to
he a "good story" for the media.
Clinton currently stands well above 50
percent in the polls. But the press is still
waiting for him to put his concerted political
power behind a major policy initiative of his
own. Largely ignored is the fact that on sub
stance Clinton has enjoyed a remarkably
good first year, as presidencies go. His pro
posals have had the highest success rate with
the Congress of any newly elected president
since Dwight Eisenhower, and he has vet to
use his veto power
But for a Democratic president to work
effectively with a Democratic Congress gets
written off as a foregone conclusion, as easy as
the economic recovery, the decline in the rate
of serious crime, and the defusing of chronic
conflict in the Middle Fast and South Africa.
These achievements are seen as having
fallen into Clinton's lap, and he can no more
collect credit for them than can Gergen for
the quiet revolution he effected in the White
House this past year.
For the press' part, it has shaken free of at
least one canard, the myth that it pursues a
liberal agenda. Robert Lichter, a conserva
tive scholar who complained throughout the
Reagan-Bush years of the rough handling his
favored presidents got from the press, report
ed last spring that in its first four months the
Clinton administration received the most
negative media treatment of any presidency
he had studied in his long series of content
analyses. The media's basic agenda is to mar
ket a product of news and commentary prod
uct that will keep them ahead of their com
petitors. Presidents come and go, but the
news business is forever
Is Bill Clinton getting the press he
deserves? Probably no president does It is
not the role of the press to guarantee fair
ness, but simply to cover what the press
defines as news, and then to offer commen
tary on that from various critical perspec
tives. The White House today seems to
understand how that ongoing process works,
and to function within the constraints a free
press system imposes on those in positions of
high power.

cover politics. Many of them are, like other

got on famously with them, George Bush less
so.

Clinton currently stands well above 50
percent in the polls. But the press is still
waiting for him to put his concerted political
power behind a major policy initiative of his
own. Largely ignored is the fact that on sub

good first year, as presidencies go. His pro
posals have had the highest success rate with
the Congress of any newly elected president
since Dwight Eisenhower, and he has vet to
use his veto power
But for a Democratic president to work
effectively with a Democratic Congress gets
written off as a foregone conclusion, as easy as
the economic recovery, the decline in the rate
of serious crime, and the defusing of chronic
conflict in the Middle Fast and South Africa.
These achievements are seen as having
fallen into Clinton's lap, and he can no more
collect credit for them than can Gergen for
the quiet revolution he effected in the White
House this past year.

Clinton administration received the most
negative media treatment of any presidency

Is Bill Clinton getting the press he

press system imposes on those in positions of
high power.

ONE WAY of looking at Bill Clinton's
presidency is m terms of its relations
with the media. The first year can he
divided rather cleanly into two phases:
Before Gergen, and After Gergen.
The appointment to the White House staff
of David Gergen abruptly ended a series of
public misadventures, and the president has
been mostly on track with the press since.
Even before Clinton took office some

, newspaper columnists
were declaring his admin-

istration a failure. Early
on his staff publicized the search for candi
dates for Cabinet positions, and several
prominent nominees could not pass all the
litmus tests. Major positions remained
unfilled.
The president seemed to reporters uncer-

tain of his priori
ties. He was
being sucked
into embarrass
ing struggles
with his own
people over plans
that he had
scarcely men
tioned in his
1992 campaign.
By May of
1993 the per
centage saying
they "approved"
of the job Clin
ton was doing as
President was no
higher than the
43 percent that
had voted for
him It is hard to
govern when you

are seen as lack

inn public support. Knter (terpen.
A great public relations operative is not
seen, and not heard. The audible dither of
indecision that had been emanating from the
White House ceased abruptly when Gergen
joined the team.
He brought in a thorough understanding
of two counterforces. First, he understands
the media, not so much because he was a
journalist — he had, rather, been a TV com

mentator — but because in prior Republican
administrations he gained experience in
working opposite the press. Second, Gergen
understands how Republican leaders will
respond to events and issues. An ability to
anticipate the other side's perspective is
invaluable to a politician.
It is possible to attribute too much to Ger
gen, or to any one person. Perhaps it has
been someone else on Clinton's staff who has
understood how to neutralize Ross Perot, for
example. Clinton's two famous successes
have been pushing through his budget bill,
which implemented Perot's campaign
demand to cut the deficit, and the North
American Free Trade Act (NAFTA), which
was sponsored by George Bush and other
Republicans and which Perot fought long
and loud. Clinton has received good marks
from the press for both these victories, and
Perot's star is in eclipse.
We should not think of "the media" as
monolithic. First, there are local publishers
of major daily newspapers, an autocratic and
thoroughly conservative ensemble. They
have applauded, in their editorials, both the
deficit reduction effort and NAFTA. Some of
them might even endorse Clinton in his next
campaign, which is of course already under
way.
Second, there are the East Coast colum
nists and television commentators, an elite
corps that tends to be politically internation
alist and economically market-oriented, "hey
applauded the NAFTA victory, although
attributing more than is reasonable to the
debating skills of Vice President Albert Gore.
These phrasemakers admire winners, and
they are still looking for Clinton to assert
strong leadership abroad.
Finally, there are the beat reporters who
cover politics. Many of them are, like other
educated working people, liberal on domestic
issues. But they try not to let their politics
intrude on their journalism, and they appre
ciate being treated as friends. Ronald Reagan
got on famously with them, George Bush less
so.
