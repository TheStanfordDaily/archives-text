I WANT TO BE A STANFORD Com
mencement speaker. One of the few,
the proud, the unknown. One of only
a handful of individuals who get to waltz
up to the podium at Stanford Stadium
on a flaming June day amid the buzz of
the crowd — each person asking their
neighbor who the hell I am. One of a
long list of mid-to-upper level adminis
trators, well-respected but poorly publi
cized scholars with decent resumes and
decent houses in decent suburbs.
The minivan drivers of the world,
that is where the glory falls. World
records, No. 1 TV shows and presiden
cies do not an acceptable speaker make,
at Stanford that is. Policy wonks from
the LBJ administration, yes. "20/20" 's
headliner of the year, nyet. Stanford has
moved beyond the detestable search for
flair and charisma, focusing instead on
meat-and-potatoes stability. Bye-bye
Michelle Pfieffer, we want Donna Reed.
Sign me up.
For the last 21 years I've been misguid
ed, misled ... bamboozled if you will. I
thought life was all about earning that

championship ring, going that extra mile,
winning one for the Gipper. I sold my soul
to visions of expensive cars with p<x>r gas
mileage and loose men with rich tastes.
I wanted to be a household name. A
Koppel, a Packard, a Sigourney Weaver.
All this time, following the wrong path.
But now I see a higher purpose, I dream
of a more meaningful existence. For
once in my overachieving, reaching-for
the-sky life I see my real calling in life.
Just another face in the crowd.
So I'm changing my ways. No more
nipple references. No more work on my
thesis. A widely beheld figure such as a
graduation speaker cannot afford to
waste her time on awe-inspiring accom
plishments. No cures for AIDS, no sav
ing the whales, no five-night winning
streaks on "Jeopardy!" A person of such
status must spend all her time laying
low, keeping out of the headlines, turn
ing the other cheek to cosmopolitan life.
Fie on fame, fortune and world-wide
recognition — give me anonymity or
give me death. I want to live a life befit
ting a woman who will stand in front of

a couple thousand graduates throwing
around blow-up dolls, waving to a crowd
of thousands as if their near-sighted par
ents could actually see them, wearing
Birkenstocks with their Armani ties
bearing the bazillion-degree heat to
deliver a thought-provoking speech
about Stanford's graduates being the
future of America.
Ask not what your country can do for
you.
A life of competence. A life full of low
profile, semi-successful ventures even
Maury Povich would scoff at. A life of
continual plodding along my slow-track
Habitrail, raising nary an eyebrow while
kicking up as little dust as possible. Hon
ing "good"-ness to an art form, scoffing
at the multi-billionaire television/stock
market/political bigwigs on the cover of
Time magazine knowing that I, not they,
will grip the podium come spring.
I have a dream.
Junior undersecretary of agriculture?
Sorry, President Laßouche, a bit too
flashy for my tastes. Paper pusher? ... I
like it. Weatherwoman on Live 105? It's

got a nice ring to it, but I don't think it
meshes with my career plans. Silicon
Valley? Not a chance. Too much innova
tion, too much genius. I want a position
with stability, ignominy, impotency.
Make me an offer I can't refuse.
Those Stanford people aren't looking
for glitz. Glamour is for the anti-intellec
tual rayon-wearing, pinky-ringed masses.
Stanford wants no-name, low-key per
sonalities to make the audience drool.
Only a true scholar, an elitist name-drop
per would appreciate Stanford's speak
ers. Dianne Feinstein was a fluke — she
was damn lucky they let her through the
door with those impressive accomplish
ments and name recognition like that.
Stanford is making a statement.
Teaching each and every one of our par
ents in grand style that the $100,000
they poured into this institution does not
merit a Las Vegas headliner. Nor a White
House aide. Not even a MacNeil-Lehrer
posterchild. The big name which sucked
in Mommy and Daddy's little baby is
hardly enough to suck in someone whose
name rolls off the tongue effortlessly.

Less is more.
As Stanford gives its graduates their
final pat on the tuckus, kicking them out
of the nest, it is not looking for some
individual who has reached the top of his
of her field — someone who will drill it
into parents' brains that they ate cat
food all those years for a good cause.
As my parents, my grandparents and
a few friends from home come to this
Mecca that I have raved about for four
years, they will funnel into the stadium
expecting to be dazzled, wined and dined
. . . impressed, at the very least. Hut this
tiny satisfaction, the whipped cream and
cherry on top that says "this is one of
the top schools in the nation" is not to
be. Another obscure Stanfordite lays in
the wings, ready to bring about a collec
tive yawn to the crowd.
It doesn't get any better than this.
Members of the Class of '94 are not bitter
whatsoever.

As Stanford gives its graduates their
final pat on the tuckus, kicking them out
of the nest, it is not looking for some
individual who has reached the top of his
of her field — someone who will drill it
into parents' brains that they ate cat
food all those years for a good cause.
As my parents, my grandparents and
a few friends from home come to this
Mecca that I have raved about for four
years, they will funnel into the stadium
expecting to be dazzled, wined and dined
. . . impressed, at the very least. Hut this
tiny satisfaction, the whipped cream and
cherry on top that says "this is one of
the top schools in the nation" is not to
be. Another obscure Stanfordite lays in
the wings, ready to bring about a collec
tive yawn to the crowd.
It doesn't get any better than this.
Members of the Class of '94 are not bitter
whatsoever.

I WANT TO BE A STANFORD Com
mencement speaker. One of the few,
the proud, the unknown. One of only
a handful of individuals who get to waltz
up to the podium at Stanford Stadium
on a flaming June day amid the buzz of
the crowd — each person asking their
neighbor who the hell I am. One of a
long list of mid-to-upper level adminis
trators, well-respected but poorly publi
cized scholars with decent resumes and
decent houses in decent suburbs.
The minivan drivers of the world,
that is where the glory falls. World
records, No. 1 TV shows and presiden
cies do not an acceptable speaker make,
at Stanford that is. Policy wonks from
the LBJ administration, yes. "20/20" 's
headliner of the year, nyet. Stanford has
moved beyond the detestable search for
flair and charisma, focusing instead on
meat-and-potatoes stability. Bye-bye
Michelle Pfieffer, we want Donna Reed.
Sign me up.
For the last 21 years I've been misguid
ed, misled ... bamboozled if you will. I
thought life was all about earning that

championship ring, going that extra mile,
winning one for the Gipper. I sold my soul
to visions of expensive cars with p<x>r gas
mileage and loose men with rich tastes.
I wanted to be a household name. A
Koppel, a Packard, a Sigourney Weaver.
All this time, following the wrong path.
But now I see a higher purpose, I dream
of a more meaningful existence. For
once in my overachieving, reaching-for
the-sky life I see my real calling in life.
Just another face in the crowd.
So I'm changing my ways. No more
nipple references. No more work on my
thesis. A widely beheld figure such as a
graduation speaker cannot afford to
waste her time on awe-inspiring accom
plishments. No cures for AIDS, no sav
ing the whales, no five-night winning
streaks on "Jeopardy!" A person of such
status must spend all her time laying
low, keeping out of the headlines, turn
ing the other cheek to cosmopolitan life.
Fie on fame, fortune and world-wide
recognition — give me anonymity or
give me death. I want to live a life befit
ting a woman who will stand in front of

a couple thousand graduates throwing
around blow-up dolls, waving to a crowd
of thousands as if their near-sighted par
ents could actually see them, wearing
Birkenstocks with their Armani ties
bearing the bazillion-degree heat to
deliver a thought-provoking speech
about Stanford's graduates being the
future of America.
Ask not what your country can do for
you.
A life of competence. A life full of low
profile, semi-successful ventures even
Maury Povich would scoff at. A life of
continual plodding along my slow-track
Habitrail, raising nary an eyebrow while
kicking up as little dust as possible. Hon
ing "good"-ness to an art form, scoffing
at the multi-billionaire television/stock
market/political bigwigs on the cover of
Time magazine knowing that I, not they,
will grip the podium come spring.
I have a dream.
Junior undersecretary of agriculture?
Sorry, President Laßouche, a bit too
flashy for my tastes. Paper pusher? ... I
like it. Weatherwoman on Live 105? It's

got a nice ring to it, but I don't think it
meshes with my career plans. Silicon
Valley? Not a chance. Too much innova
tion, too much genius. I want a position
with stability, ignominy, impotency.
Make me an offer I can't refuse.
Those Stanford people aren't looking
for glitz. Glamour is for the anti-intellec
tual rayon-wearing, pinky-ringed masses.
Stanford wants no-name, low-key per
sonalities to make the audience drool.
Only a true scholar, an elitist name-drop
per would appreciate Stanford's speak
ers. Dianne Feinstein was a fluke — she
was damn lucky they let her through the
door with those impressive accomplish
ments and name recognition like that.
Stanford is making a statement.
Teaching each and every one of our par
ents in grand style that the $100,000
they poured into this institution does not
merit a Las Vegas headliner. Nor a White
House aide. Not even a MacNeil-Lehrer
posterchild. The big name which sucked
in Mommy and Daddy's little baby is
hardly enough to suck in someone whose
name rolls off the tongue effortlessly.

Less is more.
