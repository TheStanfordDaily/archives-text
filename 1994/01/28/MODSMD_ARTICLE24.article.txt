# Students confront reality of L.A. riots
## Film, discussion highlight sources, impacts of 1992's urban unrest 
### September Trevino 
Shouts mid screams pierce the
aflerinxjn air as bands of angry
mobs fill the streets. Men in uni
forms attempt to keep the peace
and yet are forced to retreat into the
distance. Hundreds of fearful citi
zens take shelter from the unrest,
scurrying back to their homes.
While this sounds like a
description of a war zone, it's actu
ally 50 minutes of raw footage
from the 1992 Ix>s Angeles riots.
Last night, more than 30 students
came face to face with this reality
at a panel discussion and screen
ing of CNN's "Anatomy of A
Riot," an investigative report on
the Los Angeles uprisings.
The panel, hosted by Lantana
House and sponsored by the You
Can Make A Difference Confer
ence, included Sidly Dickson, asso
ciate dean of the Law School;
Michael Wong, director of a group
addressing Asian-American vio
lence; and Alma Medina, a second
year School student and resi
dent of South Central Los Angeles.
As a prelude to the film and the
discussion, Jeremy Cohen, Lan
tana's resident fellow and modera
tor of the panel, started the
evening by challenging people to
focus their attention on the upris

ing two years ago and to think
about "what we can do next?"
The film highlights the atroci
ties that wreaked havoc on the city
for three straight days. As build
ings burned. . ngry mobs vandal
ized property and looted business
es while hundreds of police officers
attempted to regain peace. Neigh
bors banded together to save
burning buildings, recognizing
that if the building went down in
flames, their jobs would follow.
While the film captivated the
audience, the discussion it sparked
helped students to better under
stand the forces that contributed
to the uprising.
"You can't really understand
that riot unless you really under
stand ... the political, the econom
ic, and the social conditions" pre
sent before the uprising, Dickson
said. Rather than emphasizing
racial issues, she focused on the
economic hardships that may have
contributed to the ensuing social
unrest.
"The real fundamental issue is
the class issue," she said. "If we
don't see it, we're really missing
the boat."
She encouraged people to think
about what life was like for the
residents of South Central before
the riots, emphasizing the dehu

manizing conditions the commu
nity has been compelled to endure.
Wong recognized that "The
Rodney King incident doesn't hap
pen once every 10 years or 20
years, it happens every day." He
suggested that race relations in
America have become a huge prob
lem especially when the issues and
concerns of less-publicized ethnic
groups, such as Asians and Lati
nos, an 1 overlooked by the media
and the world at large.

Medina reminded the audience
that they cannot look at the Los
Angeles riots in isolation. She
encouraged them to remember
that "we all fit into the process."
Despite the images portrayed
in the film, Medina is hopeful.
"Some of us (South Central resi
dents) are at school. We're trying
to get ahead.... Don't let yourself
believe that people are not strug
gling daily" to better their lives,
she said.
