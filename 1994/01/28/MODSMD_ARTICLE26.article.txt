## 'Too many mistakes' — UCLA edges Cardinal 69-65 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
Unranked Stanford came within a heart
beat of knocking off undefeated, top-ranked
UCLA, losing 69-65 before another raucous
sell-out crowd at Maples Pavilion last night.
With the Cardinal down 67-65 and 12 sec

onds to play, the potential go-ahead shot, a
three-pointer from Stanford forward Andy
Poppink, missed its mark.
"You've got to take that shot," said coach
Mike Montgomery. "He had a clear look If it
goes down, you've got a one-point lead and
who knows?
"Hut it didn't go down."

Nothing was going down for Stanford last
night — after hitting a season-high nine three
pointers against Cal last week, the Cardinal
(10-5 overall, 3-3 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
slopped its way to a 4-for-22 performance
from the three-point line last night.
"Shots were open," said forward Brent
Williams. "Shots were there. But we couldn't
hit some hig ones."
Montogmery agreed. "We just made too
many mistakes tonight. You can't miss shots
at all the points in the game that we missed
them," he said. "But we seem to be ahle to
hang with people."
Indeed. The outcome appeared clear
enough when UCLA (14-0, 7-0) took a 65*53
lead with just over five minutes to go in the
game.
Then Williams, who finished with a season
high '24 points, finished a Brevin Knight alley
oop at the 4:54 mark, bringing the Cardinal
within 10.
A minute later, I'oppink hit a layup, cutting
the gap to 65-57. But Knight failed on two
consecutive layup attempts, missing his first
shot and being rejected by Ed O'Bannon on
the second.
"He's got to learn to kick it out on some of
those," said Montgomery. "Things just
weren't going to go his way."
With 1:25 remaining, Dion Cross brought
the Cardinal back into the game, hitting a
long-range three-pointer with Charles O'Ban
non in his face.
"He hit that one from about 30 feet," said
UCLA coach Jim Harrick.
Six seconds later, Knight hit two free
throws, making the score 65-62, Bruins.
Knight's free throws were his only two points
in the game, but the freshman finished with
eight steals and nine assists.
At the 0:47 mark, UCLA's George Zidek
put the Bruins back up by five, tipping in an
O'Bannon miss. But with 22 ticks remaining,
Cross was fouled in three-point land. The
sophomore, who finished with 16 points, net
ted three consecutive free throws, bringing
Stanford within two at 67-65.
Bruin point guard Tyus Edney, fouled on
the ensuing inbounds play, missed the front
end of a one-and-one.
But the junior was fouled again after I'op
pink's errant three-point attempt. Edney hit
both ends of his second one-and-one attempt,
sealing the Bruin victory.
"We just didn't have enough people out
there who were on," said Montgomery. "It
would have been interesting to see what would
have happened if we played a little better."
Despite shooting an anemic 36 percent
from the field and missing nine of 24 free
throw opportunities, the Cardinal hung with

After trading baskets with
Stanford for much of the first
half, the Bruins jumped to a 26-18
lead with eight minutes left in the
period. But the Cardinal went on

an 8-0 run, tying the contest at 26
on a bucket by Darren Allaway.
"I think (the Bruins] were very
beatable tonight," said Williams.
"We're a little down."
"They're a pretty gritty group

night in another critical Pac-10
