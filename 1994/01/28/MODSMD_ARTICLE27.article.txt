Revenge.
After losing to the Washing
ton Huskies by less than a point
last season, the Cardinal women
gymnasts will be seeking
vengeance tonight at 7:IU) when
they face the Huskies and Sac ra
mento State Hornets in Burn
ham Pavilion.
After hist weekend's meet
against Arizona State and Alaba
ma, Stanford is currently ranked
Kith m the nation, while Wash
ington occupies the 19th slot.
Sacramento State is in a differ
ent conference, the Big West,
and has not participated in any
meets to date.
Cardinal assistant coach
Robert Shawler is certain of the
gymnasts' ability to beat both
teams.
The Stanford squad hopes
that tonight's meet will trigger a
winning streak, especially since
they have already faced the
toughest teams they will com
pete against in the regular sea
son.
"I think we will dominate,"
senior Mollie Brown said. "We
have two meets under our belt
and we have done well.
"Personally, I am ready to hit
the routines I know I can do."
The Cardinal gymnasts have
had a fantastic workout week,
according to Shawler. I heir
vault scores should continue to
improve, especially with junior
Jenny Ward and junior Meegan
Lanning competing new vaults
that are each potentially worth a
10.
Furthermore, sophomore
Hillary Anderson and freshman
Katie Jennings have become
more consistent in hitting their
vaults, and freshman Ariel Pas
sanisi is improving hers as well.

Uneven bar routines were a
focus of practice this week, as
one workout included 50 consec
utive routines among the gym
nasts.
In addition, t lie Stanford team
hopes to continue their solid per
formance on beam and strong
showing on floor, which Shawler
touts contains "choreography
that is outdoing everyone (Stan
ford's compel itors)."
"We need to add more spark to
our routines and have fun with
them; that is when we do our
best," Lannin said. "I want to
catch all my release moves on
bars, nail my vault and turn
heads on the floor."
Due to a sore Achilles' tendon,
Junior Jene Elzie will not be
competing floor and, possibly,
vault in this upcoming meet.
Washingt on's strongest
events are vault and bars,
though their top van Iters
Joan Greve, who holds the school
record, and Courtney Cabolt,
their top freshman recruit — are
out because of injuries. Conse
quently, leading the Huskies on
vault this meet should be Kileen
Castillo, a gymnast Shawler
coached two years ago.
Other gymnasts to watch for,
according to Husky head coach
Bob Levesque, are Katherine
Williams on bars, Kristy Nee
bling on floor and Stacy Connol
ly on the beam
Tonight will be Washington's
first away meet They earned an
overall score of 185.3 at their
first meet and then won the
Husky Classic, in which they
competed against Utah State,
Boise State and Alaska.
"If we can stay on the appara
tus, we will give Stanford a run
for their money," Levesque said.
"But they have a good team, and
I will be satisfied if we can stay
within a point of them."
