# The 						crowd 'reminded me of the earthquakes back home.'

Even though they weren't
rewarded with a W, they still
gave it their all.
The Stanford faithful
trudged over to Maples Pavil
ion in record numbers, they
shouted their lungs out, and
they didn't quit till the final
buzzer.
The Cardinal's top-ranked
opponent couldn't help but
notice them last night.
"In this league, everywhere
at home is tough to play," said
UCLA head coach Jim Harrick.
"They're all tough when

you've got a
pretty good team
(like Stanford)."
The Cardinal
enthusiasts
seemed especial
ly pumped for
last night's chal
lenge.
The line for
the student
entrance, filled
with hundreds of
patient fans,
spilled out to
Campus Drive
more than an
hour before
game time.
When they did
finally gain
admittance,
finding an empty
seat proved a dif
ficult task.
Clearly, this
was no ordinary
basketball game.
"(The crowd)
is always excel
lent when you
get a number
one team coming
in," said Stan
ford head coach

Mike Montgomery. "People get
up for that."
The boisterous fans didn't
waste any time psyching them
selves for such a noteworthy
contest. In fact they estab
lished a rowdv mood long
before tipoff.
Whether they were heckling
UCLA's cheerleaders or cheer
ing when Cardinal superfan
Jerry Rice entered the arena,
one thing was for certain — the
Bruins would have to overcome
the frenzied Stanford crowd as
well as the Cardinal players.
The atmosphere became

even harsher for UCLA when the
noise level escalated after the Stan
ford squad jumped out to a 10-4
lead.
"It got pretty loud," Bruin guard
Tyus Edney said bluntly.
Hut making ear-piercing sounds
wasn't the only weapon employed
by Cardinal aficionados.
Every time a UCLA player
attempted a free throw, the entire
student section jumped on the boun
cy Maples Pavilion door, creating
tremors for all the players on the
court. The constant shaking
arguably had an irritating affect on
the Bruin squad which shot a measly
41.7 percent from the charity stripe.

"It reminded me of the earth
quakes back home," said Edney,
who flailed on a crucial free-throw
attempt late in the game.
Even when the UCIJ\ advan-
Uige reached double figures with
just a few minutes remaining, the
Cardinal faithful didn't let down
one bit.
And to the crowd's delight, the
Stanford squad roared back, forc
ing the game's outcome down to
the wire and creating a chance for
the team to pull off the impossible.
The overzealous Cardinal fans
deserved an exciting finish after
giving the Stanford team such an
energetic performance.
"Our job as a basketball team is
to give them a product they can
enjoy," Montgomery said. "We're
going to get them all back for USC,
right?"
