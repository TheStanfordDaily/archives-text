Flanking Super Bowl Sunday this year
will be a pair of Stanford men's volleyball
matches against Loyola Mary mount and
UC-Irvine.
The sixth-ranked Cardinal (2-3) will
take on the Lions at Maples Pavilion on
Saturday — game time, 5:30 p.m. Then,
after a brief football respite, Stanford will
be at it again, this time against the
Anteaters on Monday at 7 p.m.
These two matches will christen the
beginning of the regular Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation season for the young
Cardinal squad. Last year, Stanford
topped the Pacific Conference of the
MPSF with an overall 18-6 mark and a
No. 2 national ranking.
This season, Stanford looks to improve
upon that mark in hopes of securing a
Final Four berth; however, the long trek
to Fort Wayne, Ind., begins with matches
against the last year's Mountain Division
cellar-dwellers — LMU and Irvine
Loyola currently stands at 0-1 in MPSF
action, with the loss coming at the hands
of Hawaii in a 15-12, 15-6, 15-12 no con
test. The Lions field an extremely young
team of underclassmen with a combined
four years of collegiate experience among
the starting six.

Junior outside hitters Jason McEntee
and Charlie Mattson will lead the Lion
attack. Loyola completes the lineup with
three junior college transfers and one true
freshman.
Stanford head coach Ruben Nieves is
cautious about the Loyola matchup,
despite having slaughtered the Lions 15-
9, 15-5, 15-11 in Southern California last
year.
"Loyola did not participate in the UC-
Santa Barbara Tournament like the rest
of the league teams (two weeks ago), so 1
haven't had a chance to see them play,"
Nieves said. "But 1 know they are a tough
and scrappy team, and I'm glad we're
playing them at home and not down
south."
Irvine clung to the bottom rung of the
MPSF ladder last season, but with the
return of their star opposite hitter Leland
Quinn, the Anteaters look to put up a
good fight against the Cardinal.
Standing at an even 1-1, with matches
against Princeton and Pacific today and
tomorrow before heading to Maples on
Monday, Irvine will look to shell the Car
dinal blockers with powerful hitters on
both sides.

out the UCSB Tourney.
Although the Stanford has
already had practice at pounding
the Anteaters in the UCSB tour
nament (15-7, 15-7), Nieves is
wary of their full potential with
Quinn on the court.
"They are a tall and dangerous
team," Nieves said. "We just have
to hit and block real well in order
to control the game.
"They weren't playing their
best when we beat them earlier,
and we already know that they're
capable of throwing more offense
at you than you can handle."
In order to be effective against
that constant bombardment, the

Cardinal will be searching for a
consistency that was not present
during their last road trip to
Penn State, where they dropped
two of three matches to the No. 5
Lions.
"We've gained tremendous
playing experience during the pre
season," Nieves said. "But the only
thing lacking was consistency.
"We're trying to work on stay
ing positive during the rough
spots and not compounding the
problem, because we might
struggle seme at times, but that
should not throw us completely
out of sync."
However, the Cardinal should
find synchronicity this weekend,
as Stanford begins its season
with hopes of at least a MPSE
title and maybe even a little
more.
