## Cardinal nine begin season today against fifth-ranked Titans at Sunken Diamond 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
The Cardinal baseball team faces a big
challenge as it kicks off its season today as
it opens a three-game series against fifth
ranked Cal State-Fullerton at Sunken Dia
mond. The games are scheduled to begin at
2:00 p.m. today and 1:00 p.m. on Saturday
and Sunday
Stanford enters thus season ranked 12th
in the nation, and hopes to bounce back
from a subpar 1993 effort. The Cardinal's
27-28 record last season was only its sec
ond losing season in over 45 years. Last
season, Stanford traveled to Fullerton and
took only the opening game of the three

gume set.
The Cardinal returns 17 letter-winners
from last year's team, including all eight
position players, but its pitching staff has
been weakened by the departure of Willie
Adams and Andrew Lorraine, the aces of
the rotation, to the professional drafl.
"Our pitching staff is very young,"
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess said.
We have a lot of good arms, but they're all
without a lot of experience. w
Sophomore southpaw Dan Reed, who
posted a 4-5 record in 1993 with a 4.95
earned-run average last year, will be the
starting pitcher for the Cardinal in today's
game. Marquess believes Reed has
the tools to become an outstand
ing pitcher. "I'm looking for Dan
to take that next step and become
one of the top pitchers in the
[Pacific 10 Conference)," Mar
quess said. "He got better and bet
ter with each outing last season
and I expect that improvement to
continue in 1994."
Leading the offensive charge
for Stanford is junior first base
man Dusty Allen, who has started
113 of 117 games over the past
two seasons. His batting average
dipped from .296 during his fresh
man year to .247 last season, but
Marquess expects that he will
improve significantly and be a
major contributor to the 1994
Stanford squad. "I expect Dusty
to bounce back this year and
become a force in the middle of
our lineup," Marquess said. "He
has tremendous power and the
ability to hit for average."
Also expected to make a large
contribution is sophomore catcher
A.J. Hinch, whose .350 batting
average from a season ago earned
him Most Valuable Freshman
team honors. "It will Ik? hard for
A.J. to match what he did as a
freshman," Marquess said. "He is
without question one of the top
catchers in college baseball
today."
Cal State-Fullerton comes into
the season ranked fifth in the

country, and returns six starting
position players and three start
ing pitchers from last year's
squad, which finished 35-19 and
ended the season with a third
place finish at the Central II
Regional, just missing capturing a
berth to the College World Series.
The Titans are led offensively
by preseason AU-American out
fielder Dante Powell, who hit .355
with 12 home runs and 57 RBI
while stealing 42 bases last sea
son.
"He's going to be a first-round
draft pick," Marquess said. "He
can steal some bases, hit for
power, makes a lot of things hap
pen and cause a lot of problems
for you."
Cal State-Fullerton's pitching
staff is equally impressive, with
starters Dan Ricabal (11-3, 3.48
ERA, 106 strikeouts in 1993) and
Mike Parisi (10-3, 4.71, 63 K) set
ting the pace.
"It's going to be tough for us
early because they throw a lot of
breaking balls. The problem
they'll present for us is that they
just have an outstanding pitching
staff," Marquess said. "They were
good last year and they're all
back."
This weekend's series at
Sunken Diamond will be a test of
sorts to see how far Stanford's
young squad has progressed.
"I think |Cal State Fullerton'sl
ranking is legitimate," said Mar
quess. "They're probably one of
the top seven or eight teams in the
country. It will be a good test for
us."
