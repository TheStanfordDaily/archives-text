# L.A. poses double threat to hoops

The lOth-ranked Cardinal women's basketball
team flies into earthquake-ravaged Southern Cali
fornia this weekend looking to shake up the Pacific
10 Conference standings in a pair of crucial contests
As the halfway point of the Pac-10 schedule nears,
second-place Stanford (11-3, 4-1 in the Pac-10) can
approach or even grah the conference lead if it
knocks off UCLA (8-7, 3-3) tonight and stops pace
setting USC (13-1, 6-0) on Sunday afternoon.
Despite having played only one game in the last 13
days, the Cardinal should, if recent history holds,
clear any rust out of its system tonight at Pauley
Pavilion, to which returns after splitting two
in Arizona Stanford simply owns the Bruins, having
won their last 10 meetings overall and the last three
at Pauley bv 14 points or more, including a 71-54
waxing there last season
Yet UCLA could keep things interesting with a
weapon all-too-familiar to Cardinal
volleyball and basketball fans alike.
Natalie Williams, a 6-foot-1 senior
forward who played out a spiking
scholarship in 1992, has been hop
ing it up in her basketball finale,
leading the Bruins by large margins
in both scoring (a conference-lead
ing 22.7 points per game) and
rebounding (12.2 per contest).
Employing the principle that two
bodies are better than one, the Car
dinal hopes to neutralize Williams'
abundant athleticism with its top
inside tandem. Junior forward
Rachel Hemmer, coming off her
worst output of the season (four
points, two rebounds) last week in
Berkeley, must return to the form
that makes her Stanford's statisti
cal leader (15.1 ppg, 7.7 rpg). Mean
while, junior center Anita Kaplan
looks to roll with the momentum
she picked up at the end of last
week's contest and improve on her
season marks (15.0 ppg, 7.3 rpg).
Beyond Williams, UCLA dis
plays very little in its showcase.
Bookend 6-1 senior forward Amy
Jalewalia (14.6 ppg) poses the Bru
ins' only other scoring threat, while
5-6 senior point guard Detra Lock
hard (4.9 assists and 3.5 steals per
game) might provide a pesky chal
lenge to the Cardinal on both ends
of the court.
However, no challenge in the
Pac-10 looms as large as Stanford's
Super Bowl Sunday showdown at

the Lyon Center with the eighth
ranked Trojans, Led by former USC
great Cheryl Miller, the Women of
Troy pose a legitimate threat to the
Cardinal's five-year stranglehold on
the conference title and would be
one of only two undefeated teams in
the nation right now if not for a con
troversial last-second three-pointer
by lowa that sent them to their only
defeat last month.
Appropriately, one of the
nation's top players, 6-5 senior for
ward Lisa I ieslie, leads one of its top
teams. Leslie paces the Trojans and
stands among the top 10 in the con
ference in scoring (20.9 ppg),
rebounding (12.6 rpg), steals (3.0
per game) and blocked shots (a con
ference-leading 3.4 per game, near
ly two more than her closest com
petitor).
In addition to facing the threat
posed by Leslie, Hemmer and
Kaplan must also pay heed to
USC's 6-3 freshman center, Tina
Thompson. Thompson scores at a
12.5-point clip, and is sixth among
Pac-10 rebounders with 8.9 a game.
Stanford starting guards Jamila
Wideman, Christy Hedgpeth and
Kate Paye must also contend with
the Trojans' Nicky McCrimmon,
who is second in the conference
with 6.1 assists per game and boasts
a 12.3 ppg scoring average.
Both games may be heard on
KZSU (90.1 FM), with Marc
Oppenheimer and Scott Walker
announcing the action. Tonight's
contest tips offat 7 p.m., while Sun
day's tilt comes to you during the
Super Bowl pregame show at 1 p.m.
