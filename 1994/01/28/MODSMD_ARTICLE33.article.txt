Freshman Katie Schlukebir slaps a backhand toward her opponent
in yesterday's duel meet against Hawaii. It was actually a dual duel
meet, as both the Stanford men and women's tennis teams domi
nated the Rainbows, neither squad giving up a set. The women's
team squares off against Washington today at 1:30 at the Stanford
Tennis Stadium. Full results from yesterday's and today's matches
can be found on Monday's sports page.
