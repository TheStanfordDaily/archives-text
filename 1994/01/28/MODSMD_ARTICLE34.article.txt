# The 						Diversions ...
## Swimsuit Issue 
### 
So it's winter quarter and
it's cold. Your nipples are
hard enough to cut glass
and your Neener's shrunk to the
size of a JuJußee. Your entire
body is as white as spring's butt.
It's rainy out and your jelly roll is
as big as it has ever been.
You've been eating cookies.
And just when your life as a
hermit is peaking into oblivion
those bastards at Sports Illus
trated come out with their darned
Swimsuit Issue to play Hungry
Hungry Hippos with what's left of
your self esteem.
Well if they can do it...
Which brings us to this: The
Diversions Swimsuit Issue Spe
cial. A cornucopia of your col
leagues bearing their bums. Our

elite team of photographers

and world-famous models —
many of whom have never been
seen before — are proud as a
new pappy to present to you per
haps the greatest collaboration
of swarthy Stanford swimwear
chic ever collected.
Each one has gone through
the PC/don't-objectify-me cen
sor. So go on ahead — clip em
out and paste 'em on the fridge.
Shot on location in exotic
parts of Stanford and beyond,
Diversions spared no expense to
bring you the finest quality drool
drivel ever to hit the independent
press. (Sorry. No free football
phone included with this one.)

I never did urxletsland whal ttose guys on GJligan s Island were Itunking It I were stuck on lhal island Ifwse g»ls I «o>*) have
been at over rial Mrs Homret



Watch the testosterone ooze as Stanford's very own Mendicants take time out from their crooning to strip for your
pleasure. No more teasing everyone with lurid images of quivering pectorals bulging under those polyester jer
seys — now you know the truth.


Why it (t that it you toast an artghsh muffin it's one of the tastiest darned things you'll ever eat. but try biting
into one raw and if H taste like a shoe horn. Must be them heat activated nooks and crannies

effects of the cold.
