# Senate expected to confirm Gould
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
After months of waiting in a
surprisingly sunny purgatory
in California, Law Prof.
William Gould may soon be
heading for policy wonk heaven
Washington, D. C. â€” as head
of the National Labor Relations
Board.
Gould is now likely to become
the first African-American chair
man of the board which acts like a
court for union representation
disputes, deciding unfair practice
suits and monitoring union elec
tions.
President Clinton nominated
Gould to the post last June, but
opposition from Senate Republi
cans has delayed his confirmation.
Clinton's nomination of Charles
Cohen to the NLRB, expected as

early as today, should appease Re
publicans and speed Gould to con
firmation by the end of February,
according to board spokesman
David Parker.
Gould was a pawn in a compli
cated game played primarily be
tween the White House and Sen.
Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, the
highest-ranking Republican on
the Senate Labor and Human Re
sources Committee.
The White House hoped that
Gould would be confirmed in July,
but delays in paperwork exacer
bated by White House legal coun
sel Vincent Foster's suicide de
layed confirmation hearings until
October.
Although Gould said hearings
"went fabulously" for him, Repub
licans and business lobbyists later
campaigned against him. Kasse
baum, who was not at the hear
ings, claimed that Gould would
have a pro-labor bias because his
legal writings suggest reforms in
labor relations such as making it
easier for workers to approve
union representation under cer
tain circumstances.
Gould accuses his critics of dis
torting his words and taking a few
suggestions out of context.
"There have been numerous lies
told about my views," he said yes
terday, decrying critics' claims
that he would seek to eliminate
secret-ballot elections for union
representation.
He also dismissed critics'
claims that as chairman, he could

overturn standing Supreme
Court decisions.
"Any first-year law student"
could discredit that claim, he said.
"They don't even understand the
law."
Gould, who has taught at
Stanford since 1972, has been an
arbitrator and a mediator for
more than 30 years and served on
the NLRB in the 19605.
"Not one single management
labor lawyer I know has opposed
my nomination," Gould added.
"My views advocate a balanced
treatment of rights and obliga
tions for both sides" in labor dis
putes, he said.
Nevertheless, Kassebaum and
other Republican senators raised
enough opposition to prevent a
vote on the confirmation of Gould
and that of Margaret Browning,
who would fill a vacant Democratic
seat on the NLRB. Republicans

sought to delay the confirmation
proceedings until they were
assured that a suitable candidate
would be nominated for an empty
Republican seat on the board. They
sent a list of names of pro-manage
ment lawyers to the president.
Cohen was apparently on the list.
Kassebaum has said she has
nothing personal against Gould.
She has also said, "This is not an
attempt to keep Gould dangling.
This is a key position on the board
for us. It was the logical point for
us to draw the line in the sand."
The board consists of five
members, split three to two along
party lines. Since one member left
for private legal practice in
November and Gould and Cohen
have not been confirmed, the
board has been left with only two
members, and has been unable to
decide cases. It currently has a
backlog of about 600 cases.
