# Curing health care
## C. Everett Koop to speak at forum examining medical reform issues 
### Frank Guinan 
In the wake of President Clin
ton's push for universal health
coverage, the Stanford Health
Policy Forum will convene an all
day conference tomorrow to ad
dress the issues that are at the
center of this national debate.
The Stanford Medical Students
Association's conference on
health care reform will deal, in
general, with the issue of "how re
form will impact . . . health care
professionals and the communi
ty," said second-year medical stu
dent and student organizer
Richard Chen.
Among the featured speakers

at the event in Kresge Auditorium
are former U.S. Surgeon General
C. Everett Koop and Rep. Anna
Eshoo, D-Stanford.
The forum will open with an
address by Business School Prof.
Alain Enthoven, a health econo
mist who came up with many of
the ideas used in Clinton's plan
but has recently become a vocal
critic of it. Dr. Philip Lee, assis
tant secretary for health at the De
partment of Health and Human
Services, will also give an address
discussing the Clinton plan.
Second-year medical student
and student organizer Munish
Gupta said the purpose of the
forum is to explore various facets
of medicine. "There is a lot more
to medicine than just the science
part," Gupta said. "There are
political, economic and social fac
tors involved. . . . This forum
should provide a better sense of
what reform is all about and make
us more familiar with the non-sci
entific aspects of medicine."
Eight morning and afternoon
workshops are scheduled for the

day and will focus on more specif
ic topics, such as the cost and
quality of health care and the use
of preventive medicine.
Another such workshop will
look at how health care reform
will affect medical education. It
will discuss how medical school
curricula will change as physi
cians begin to move into a man
aged care environment. Dr. Marc
Nelson, assistant dean for medi
cal education at Stanford, will be
one of the speakers at this work
shop.
A panel discussion titled, "The
Impact of Health Care Reform on
the Practice of Medicine," is also

scheduled in the afternoon. Stu
art Shear, health and science
reporter for the "MacNeil/Lehrer
News Hour," will moderate this
discussion.
All together, there will be more
than 35 speakers at the forum,
the most notable of whom will be
Koop, who will give the closing
address. Koop, a member of the
National Academy of Sciences as
well as many other professional
societies, has become renowned
for his efforts at educating the
public on many health issues.
Titled "Towards a Healthier
America? The Impact of Health
Care Reform," the forum will

draw together many different
views on the Clinton health plan.
"Since it is an open forum," Chen
said, "we have tried hard to pro
vide all sides of the issue."
"There will be a wide range of
people coming," Gupta added. "It
should be a healthy debate."
The conference is the eighth
annual health forum that the
medical students at Stanford
have organized. "This conference
is entirely medical student-run,"
Chen said. Past forums have cov
ered such topics as prenatal care,
overpopulation and AIDS.
The forum is expected to
attract approximately 600 people,

and national media coverage is
expected. So far, between 350 and
400 seats have already been
reserved. Half of those who have
pre-registered are students, while
the other half are physicians and
nurses from local hospitals and
various members of the commu
nity.
Other sponsors of this health
conference include the Pew Com
mission for the Health Profes
sions, Stanford University Hospi
tal, the Stanford Medical Alumni
Association, the ASSU Speakers
Bureau, the ASSU Program
Board and the Packard Founda
tion.
