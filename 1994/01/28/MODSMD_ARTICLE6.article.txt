# Other schools also facing budget woes
## 
### Andy Dworkin Scott Van Winkle Staff writers 
Stanford, in many ways, is a cutting-edge
institution. The terra cotta tower has been at
the forefront of many movements that have
swept American higher education, including
multiculturalism, granting employee benefits
to domestic partners and founding interdisci
plinary academic programs.
And it was Stanford's spot at the head of an
other national trend — the indirect-cost con

troversy — that is causing some of the Univer
sity's current budget woes.
But for once, Stanford is running with the
pack. Budget shortfalls are striking universi
ties all across the country, due to nationwide
economic constraints. And, as at Stanford,
many universities are cutting their budgets for
the short term and looking for ways to reorga
nize to save money in the long run.
Stanford's cuts
Over the next three years, Stanford is aim
ing to cut about $20 million from its operating

budget, which is projected to be $473 million
this year. Most of the cuts, announced by
Provost Condoleezza Rice in November, are to
come from administrative areas. Academic
programs are also looking at ways to improve
efficiency, and some weak programs could be
axed.
The administrative areas will cut their bud
gets between 5 percent and 10 percent each
year until fiscal year 1997. The cuts will be fi
nalized by Rice, who will review proposals from
the heads of each administrative
unit on what to cut or change in
that unit. Some positions may be
eliminated to reach the budget tar
get.
This is Stanford's third
announced budget reduction in
this decade, cuts that will total
about $85 million. In 1990, then-
Provost James Rosse announced a
swift $22 million reduction, called
repositioning. Then, in 1992,
another $43 million in cuts were
announced in response to indirect
cost reimbursement reductions,
cuts that are still being phased in.
Where the efforts differ is in
their processes: Both the earlier
plans allowed for more University
wide input than the current pro
posal.
Rice has also stressed the need
to examine the ways Stanford
works, to see if there are areas
that should be entirely restruc
tured. Since some of Stanford's
revenue shortfalls are caused by
potentially long-term changes —
for example, lower donations of
unrestricted funds or changes in
indirect-cost recovery rules — the
administration is seeking solu
tions more permanent than one
time cuts. Changing the opera
tions of some areas to increase
efficiency could provide the kind

of long-term decrease in costs that
Rice has said the University
needs.
Trimming budget fat
Many other universities across
America are also exploring new
ways to trim budget fat and tighten
financial belts.
The schools are all faced by the
same problems that drain rev
enues. Administrators at other
schools cited the same issues —
indirect-cost rate reductions,
increased financial aid burdens and
sluggish alumni contributions —
that Stanford officials frequently
mention as the reason for the cur
rent wave of cuts here.
Yale University, for instance,
faces continuing budget shortfalls
over the next few years, according
to university spokesperson Cyn
thia Atwood, in part because of a
five-year program to repair aging
campus facilities. This year's $913
million budget forecasts a deficit of
about $14 million.
The University of California
system has also been faced with
severe budget shortfalls recently.
Even if a budget proposed by Gov.
Pete Wilson — which includes a 3.2
percent increase for higher educa
tion spending — passes this year,
the system will have to permanent
ly pare about $53 million from its
budget. That means the system
will have had to cut a total of $433
million in the past four years.
UC-Berkeley — the system's

main campus and one of Stanford's
main rivals — is now suffering a
$31 million cut in its budget.
And MIT is presently undergo
ing a "re-engineering" effort to
bringdown its $10.1 million deficit.
Top-down cuts
Just as the causes of these bud
get shortfalls are the same, so are
many of the schools' responses.
Yale is currently working on a
five-year plan to reduce its deficit,
partly by restructuring, but mostly
by cutting administrative areas,
said Peter Brooks, a professor of
comparative literature at Yale and
a member of the university's bud
get committee.
At Yale, like at Stanford, each
administrative unit has been asked
to create a plan to cut its own bud
get, and present that plan to the
budget committee — a group made
up largely of top administrators
which will make final decisions.
Brooks said that in general he
believes this "has been a very
thoughtful and widely consulta
tive" process.
But budget cuts have not always
been so quiet at Yale. In 1991, the
University was ready to make
severe cuts in its school of arts and
sciences that would have eliminat
ed five departments entirely.
While there were a few "good
faculty" on the committee that rec
ommended the initial cuts, Brooks
said that they accepted the guide
lines the university administration

laid down, as well as "a much too
alarmist view of the budget,"
which led to the severe proposal.
Those recommendations soon
encountered stiff resistance.
"The faculty, when this report
came to it, went into revolt,"
Brooks said. Many faculty mem
bers formed their own committee
and came out with a plan for much
more modest cuts that preserved
all the departments.
This alternate plan, which the
administration has accepted, will
cut faculty positions by 5 percent
over the next five years through
attrition. However, At wood said,
the cuts are "not cutting into
course offerings" and that the uni
versity is "not targeting any one
department" in this process.
Brooks added that the fallout
from the faculty revolt also led,
directly or indirectly, to the resig
nation of Yale's provost and presi
dent at the time, Frank Turner and
Benno Schmidt.
"The way the original restruc
turing was handled seemed high
handed," he said.
If some budget plans seemed to
the Yale faculty to come from on
high, there is no doubt about it at
UC-Berkeley. Since the UC system
is funded as a whole, Berkeley is
given a campus budget that has
been decided by a system-wide
committee.
This has meant serious
changes in class offerings
throughout the UC system. To

meet its $31 million budget short
fall this year, UC-Berkeley is elim
inating over 335 classes, including
all first-year Spanish courses.
Early retirement has been respon
sible for the elimination of 132
faculty positions, while a graduate
program in art practice has been
suspended. UC faculty have
received no general salary increas
es for the past two years, and will
take a one-time, 3.5 percent pay
cut this year.
At Berkeley, like at Stanford,
the decision of what cuts to make
are made by a top administrator
after consulting with others on
campus. The school's academic
senate works on making cuts to
academic departments, while indi
vidual units help decide what to cut
in administrative areas, said cam
pus spokeswoman Marie Felde.
The campus has also hosted "town
hall" meetings to get input on the
budget, she added.
In addition to immediate budget
cuts, Felde said Berkeley now has
an Academic Planning Board that
has been "systematically looking at
the academic future of the univer
sity" to try to make the school
more efficient in the long run.
These cuts have not been pain
less. "When you see your income
drop while expenses arAund you go
up, it's hard," Felde said.
MIT is trying to reduce a $10.1
million deficit from a budget of
about $400 million through "re
engineering" — a term that has
become a mantra for MIT budget
cutters.
Last November, MIT President
Charles Vest told the community,
"We need to take a fundamental
look at how we operate." That has
translated into cuts of about 400
administrative positions over the
next three to four years and 50 fac
ulty positions over the next 10
years.
The details of the cuts at MIT
will be decided by the school's
provost and senior vice president
after consultation with faculty,
staff and administrative commit
tees. Budget cutting committees
from the school's academic council
have been especially involved, and
have included faculty and staff
members.
MIT is also soliciting input
through an e-mail "suggestion
box." Stanford has a similar device
— people can e-mail budget-cut
ting suggestions to "budget.sav
ings(«Torsythe."

Optimistic restructuring
Strangely, administrators at
many of the schools are somewhat
optimistic — at least about their
restructuring efforts. The hope is
that new ways can be found to
structure and run certain amis of
the university to simultaneously
improve efficiency and reduce
costs.
SUmford officials and MIT Pres
ident Charles Vest sound eerily
similar in discussing the re-engi
neering efforts at their respective
schools.
Rice: "We have to think about
how we do our work, whether we
can do it in other ways and
whether there are programs which
we might well be able to do with
out. ... To do the same with less
we have to restructure and look at
where there may be inefficiencies."
Vest: "We need to look at what
we do, why we do it, and how we do
it — and design ways to work dif
ferently and more efficiently, not
just harder. . . . (The university
should] come up with wholly differ
ent ways, not simply improved
ways, to achieve the essential pur
pose."
Vice President for Faculty and
Staff Services Barbara Butterfield
has said that Stanford's current
process "is a time to think bigger
thoughts — to suppose we com
pletely change the way we do
things."
And the dean of Stanford's
School of Engineering, James Gib
bons, said the cuts will be difficult,
but Stanford will "come out as a
healthier institution."
Vest echoed this optimism. "We
will look to the future and under
take the improvement and
strengthening of MIT as an excit
ing challenge," he said. "When fin
ished, I believe we will have more
interesting, more effective, more
satisfying jobs."
At Yale, too, there is a hint of a
positive outlook. Brooks said he is
"fairly optimistic" about the post
budget cutting future at Yale.
And UC Chancellor Chang-Lin
Tien has said the budget woes are
an opportunity as well as a difficul
ty.
"We can make good changes,
because we've been forced to make
changes," Berkeley's Felde said.
"But I can't deny it hurts people."
