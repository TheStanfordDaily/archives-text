# Open meetings introduce OMD director candidates
## 
### Julie Tsai Stuff writer 
Yesterday marked the last open forum
introducing the four finalists for the direc
torship of the Office of Multicultural De
velopment, and the search committee will
decide by Monday whom to recommend to
the provost.
In the last week, Judith Little, interim
director of the office; Clare Phillips, the of
fice's associate director; Sally Dickson, as
sistant dean of the Law School; and Sue
Von Gee, an affirmative action administra
tor at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter, presented their views and answered
questions on affirmative action and the di
rection of the office in front of staffers from
all levels of the University.
On Monday, Little, who had her speech
translated in sign language, said she
viewed the multicultural oflice director as
the "interpreter for the University."
"[The office) communicates to power
brokers what the staff sees as important,
but it can also serve as a conduit of mes
sages from the University to the staff, Lit
tle said.
The directorship, vacated by Sharon

Parker last spring, involves the coordina
tion and analysis of affirmative action data
for staff. The office also works with other
departments of the University to develop
programs.
All of the candidates mentioned the feel
ing among staff that they are second-class
citizens. Dickson called it the "hierarchy â€”
faculty, students, then 'us.' "
Dickson, who is a resident fellow in Uja
maa, the African-American theme house,
stressed the importance of refocusing the
office's activities on affirmative action staff
programs but nevertheless presented a
progressive view including the notion of
multiculturalism.
"Multiculturalism and affirmative ac
tion are linked," said Dickson in her forum
last Friday. "Affirmative action is the (just)
legal action for inclusion."
Recalling a conversation with an alum
na, Dickson said the woman complained
about Stanford's progressiveness and that
Stanford was not t he same anymore, that it
had "changed."
"Well, multiculturalism is not the same,
Stanford is not the same. Things change,"
Dickson said.
"There's a serious problem in
this country . . . we're all going to
have to settle our differences.
The opportunity of the OMD is
critical with all the changes the
University is undergoing," Dick
son added.
Yesterday, Phillips outlined
her vision for the office with
charts on the evolution of affir
mative action. She added that she
has a passion for the work that
goes beyond career aspirations.
Stressing compliance and pre
vention, Phillips said, "The office
hasn't had a vision for a while;
it's been floating in the ozone. . . .
I'm not just doing this because I
want to be a University manager;
I'm doing it because I like it," she

said.
Amid discussion about the
University's failure to implement
the proposals of the University
Committee on Minority Issues
(UCMI), Phillips said the recom
mendations for staff were still
feasible.
Gee, who has been at Stanford
since 1977, expressed opinions
similar to Phillips during her
forum last Thursday and tried to
present a broader perspective on
the work and influence of the
multicultural office.
Gee was responsible for
designing the Equal Employ
ment Opportunity/Affirmative
Action program currently used at
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter.
Noting multiculturalism's
effects on students, Gee said,
"The diverse educational experi
ence is also relevant to the world
they will eventually inherit."
