Mechanical engineering students celebrated
Taco Bell's upcoming Tresidder Union arrival yes
terday with their presentation of the design project
"Taco Hell" in the center of the Quad
The project "involved building a device out of
humble materials to ingest a taco and expel it with
in five minutes," said Lecturer Tony Hu, who
teaches ME 101, Visual Thinking. "Considering
current events, such as Taco Bell coming to Tresid
der, (the teaching assistants and instructors) as
signed this project," he said.
Each group of four was allowed only limited
quantities of foamcore; PVC tubing; plastic forks,
knives, and spoons; rubber bands; paper plates;
string; Saran Wrap; paper cups; hot melt or white
glue; Alka Seltzer and official Taco Bell 59 cent
tacos. They came up with various ideas to meet "the
challenge" — transforming and expelling the tacos
into a toilet.
No group members were allowed to touch any of
the tacos or enter a 20-foot diameter "Circle of Ir
radiation." The tacos sat in a box on a 30-inch high

pedestal in the circle.
After three weeks of brain
storming, students came up
with several creative ways to
ingest and expel.
Senior Traci Neist designed
an "arm and a pseudo man."
"The arm grabs the tacos and
places them in the pseudo man
who sits on the toilet and expels
the tacos and glue globs, which
are used to transform the
tacos," she said.
While some aimed for high
scores in the "pig factor" —
the number of tacos processed
within the allotted time —
sophomores Jim Cassidy and
Salma Qarnain chose to
transform only one taco with
their conveyer belt and cata
pult.
Their group hoped to do
well in the elegance category,
described in the assignment as
"taco processing gestalt, engi
neering excellence, creativity,
craftsmanship and aesthet
ics."
According to sophomore
Deena White, whose "skiing
motif' had tacos sliding down a
slope, a large amount of time
was spent not only building but
also brainstorming.
In the past, students' first
ME 101 projects have included
passing and shooting a basket
ball through a hoop, shooting a
football through a goal post and
throwing frisbees.
