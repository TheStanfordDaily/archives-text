Campus Interviews on February 18-19, 1994 at the CPPC
for the
International Trainee Programs of
Robert Bosch Corporation and Siemens AG
Bosch and Siemens will interview Stanford students for their trainee programs which offer a variety of
career opportunities. While the emphasis is on graduate degrees and post docs, undergraduates who
meet certain specific requirements might possibly qualify. Backgrounds in business administration and
economics, engineering-economic systems, industrial engineering and engineering management,
mechanical and electrical engineering, computer sciences, and physics are preferred. As the majority of
the training will most likely occur in Germany, working knowledge of the German language is
desirable.
Since both companies operate worldwide, we specifically encourage applications of interested students
from diverse national and cultural backgrounds.
Sign up for interviews with the on-campus recruiting program at the
Career Planning and Placement Center (CPPC)
