CELEBRATION OF BLACK
LIBERATION
"Celebrating Black Minds: Innovators
From Our Ancestors to Our Children"
Keynote Speakers: Associate Dean of
Chapel, Reverend Floyd Thompkins, Jr.,
co-founders of the S O A R program,
A J Robinson and Jamell Walker, and
local students ranging from elementary to
high school age.
This year the committee has worked
diligently to have a community-based eel-
ebration. In the past, Stanford has
focused on bringing in notable speakers
from outside of our community. For BLM
1994, the focus has been redirected to
acknowledge the accomplishments of
those nearer to us. We will exalt the
achievements of ordinary people working
everyday to bring extraordinary change
To that end, we have invited several local
innovators to share their ideas and plans
for change with us.
