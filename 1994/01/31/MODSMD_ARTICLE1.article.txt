## Pundits ponder remedies for U.S. health care 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
The nation's former top doctor
stressed the need for increased
taxes on tobacco, alcohol and
firearms as a way to pay for rising
health care costs at a health policy
conference on campus Saturday.
Former Surgeon Genera! C.
Everett Koop emphasized the im
portance of health care reform in
his closing address at a day-long
forum titled "Towards a Healthier
America? The Impact of Health
Care Reform."
"There are three things that
cause a lot of health problems â€”
smoking, alcohol and violence,"
Koop said.
He advocated taxing cigarettes
$'2 per pack. He said a higher tax
would have a positive impact on
smoking rates, as it did in Canada.
A port ion of the tax money could be
used to help tobacco farmers diver
sify into other fields, he said.
Koop also expressed concern
that President Clinton's health
care plan doesn't mention alcohol,
which the former surgeon general
said is another source of high
health care costs.
Koop's remarks capped a con
ference that drew about 750 stu
dents, physicians, politicians and
community members. The event
featured speeches and workshops
on the impact of health care re
form.
In a speech littered with anec
dotes, Koop discussed the ethical
challenges of health care reform.
He stressed the importance of pro
tecting people's health from politi
cal and economic considerations.
"My aim as surgeon general was to
place the health of the American
people over politics," he told the
Kresge Auditorium audience.
Although Clinton's plan is "cer
tainly not perfect, anything would
be better that the non-system we
have today," he said.
