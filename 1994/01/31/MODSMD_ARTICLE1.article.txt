## Pundits ponder remedies for U.S. health care 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
The nation's former top doctor
stressed the need for increased
taxes on tobacco, alcohol and
firearms as a way to pay for rising
health care costs at a health policy
conference on campus Saturday.
Former Surgeon Genera! C.
Everett Koop emphasized the im
portance of health care reform in
his closing address at a day-long
forum titled "Towards a Healthier
America? The Impact of Health
Care Reform."
"There are three things that
cause a lot of health problems —
smoking, alcohol and violence,"
Koop said.
He advocated taxing cigarettes
$'2 per pack. He said a higher tax
would have a positive impact on
smoking rates, as it did in Canada.
A port ion of the tax money could be
used to help tobacco farmers diver
sify into other fields, he said.
Koop also expressed concern
that President Clinton's health
care plan doesn't mention alcohol,
which the former surgeon general
said is another source of high
health care costs.
Koop's remarks capped a con
ference that drew about 750 stu
dents, physicians, politicians and
community members. The event
featured speeches and workshops
on the impact of health care re
form.
In a speech littered with anec
dotes, Koop discussed the ethical
challenges of health care reform.
He stressed the importance of pro
tecting people's health from politi
cal and economic considerations.
"My aim as surgeon general was to
place the health of the American
people over politics," he told the
Kresge Auditorium audience.
Although Clinton's plan is "cer
tainly not perfect, anything would
be better that the non-system we
have today," he said.
Koop also suggested a tax on
ammunition and guns because of
the impact that violence has on
health care costs. "If we are at all
serious about health care reform,
we cannot pass those costs on to the
rest of us," Koop said.
"There is no panacea, there are
no easy answers.. . there are only a
series of very difficult choices,"
Koop said.
Koop was joined by other

experts on health care reform,
including Asst. Secretary of Health
and Human Services Philip Lee,
Rep. Anna Eshoo and Stanford
Prof. Alai l \nthoven.
Enthover., a professor at the
Graduate School Business and the
Medical .'school, spoke about his
managed competition health care
concept, which had an early influ
ence on Clinton's plan.
Enthoven said he wants to "try
to introduce market forces into the
health '.are system." But he point
ed out the flaws in Clinton's plan,
including its reliance on "back-up
price controls," which he said "set

the market up for failure."
Lee's speech provided an
overview of the Clinton plan. He dis
cussed the three elements necessary
to solve the health care crisis — the
perception of crisis, presidential
leadership and a consensus on what
to do. Of the three, reaching consen
sus is al! that is left to do, he said.
"I hope that by next November
the president will have signed a bill
guaranteeing universal health care
coverage," lx»e said. "We do have, I
think, a historic opportunity."
After the opening addresses,
participants attended various
workshops, which focused on such
issues as the impact of health care
reform on primary care providers
and medical education.
A panel discussion, which
focused on the impact of health
care on the practice of medicine, fol
lowed the workshops.
Panelists included a nurse, the
chair of the American Medical
Association's board of trustees, the
vice president of Blue Cross of Cal
ifornia, the dean of medicine at
Johns Hopkins University and var
ious physicians, as well as Koop and
Eshoo.
Organizers were happy with the
results of the forum. "I was really
surprised at the turnout," said
coordinating committee member
David Kim, a second-year medical
student. "It reflects how important
this topic is."
Participants were also pleased
with the day-long event.
Rose Okello, a professor of
health education at San Francisco
State, said she was impressed with
Koop's speech, which "addressed
all the issues."
Second-year Stanford law stu
dent June Lin enjoyed Enthoven's
speech because "it showed me what
the issues were.... I didn't know
the specific details about the vari
ous health plans."
