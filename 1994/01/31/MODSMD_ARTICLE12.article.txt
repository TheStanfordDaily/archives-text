## Editor's welcome 
### 
ARE WE there yet? That
depends on where we want
to go. But no, we may not
ever get there. Because "there" will
always be a little further and a lit
tle more difficult to reach than
where we are at any given moment.
Still, that's where we're headed.
And this volume at The Daily, we're
aiming to take our coverage a little
further, dig a little deeper, get a lit
tle nosier, maybe even noisier, and
print informative, provocative and
entertaining pieces every step of
the way.
But reassessment and regroup
ing is not as easy as it sounds —
neither for The Daily nor for the
rest of campus. Halfway through
the school year, we've all settled
comfortably into a routine, and if
anyone tried to prod us into doing
something new or different, we
would likely get defensive and
somewhat irritable.
All the more reason for a shake
up and a second, more critical look
at ourselves — at students, faculty,
staff, the administration, The
Daily, everyone.
Are we happy with the way
things are? Are we doing anything
to change it? Are we taking the
right approach to budget cuts? Our
education? Are we making our voic
es heard? Or are we hiding behind
anonymous words and empty
rhetoric? Have we made a differ
ence in the University? In the com
munity? Do we care?
If the answers to these questions
leave us unsatisfied, now is the
time to change our course.
For The Daily, this means sever
al things, including, most impor
tantly, a renewed commitment to
providing more diverse, in-depth
and thoughtful coverage of the
campus throughout our paper.
It's an ever-present goal, but
sometimes, admittedly, we fall
short. As newspaper types, we can't
exactly be faulted for being short
sighted.
But sometimes we become so
overwhelmingly concerned with
the next day's news that we forget
to consider the big picture and the
long run. We shouldn't.

Luckily, re-examination is a tra
dition at The Daily; we switch vol
umes at mid-year. This means a
whole new cast of editors takes
charge of the paper, filled with ide
alism and new ideas that run the
gamut from minor changes in
appearance to the perennial goal of
overall improvement.
However, other areas will under
go a process more akin to a facelift.
Specific changes in store for this
volume include different elements
on the Opinions page. There will
only be four community columnists
this volume; the fifth columnist
slot will allow different campus fig
ures — from administrators to fac
ulty to students — to air their
views in a "Friday Forum" section.
In addition, when we're finished
saying what needs to be said in our
editorials, we will not ramble on.
Period.
We will also move our humor
page, Diversions, into a smaller
space underneath the Friday classi
fieds.
To sum it up, we will look at
everything from a fresh perspec
tive. This volume will no doubt be
challenging. And my blueprint for
it looms way above my own five
foot-tall frame.
But it is precisely by reaching
upward to meet these challenges
that we will grow the most. And
while taking a good, long look at
ourselves may at times be daunt
ing, it certainly can't hurt.
This is how we can best find out
where we are and how we can final
ly get to the place where we're
going.
