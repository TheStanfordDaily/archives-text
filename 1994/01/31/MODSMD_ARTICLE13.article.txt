## Memoirs of a bachelor pad 
### 
MY HOUSE has no furniture.
Take a look at the credits at the
bottom right-hand corner of
this page. Look at the fourth name
down, above where it says Advertising
Manager. That's my roommate Brad.
We're good roommates. We watch
ESPN together, we don't get in each
other's way, and we don't have any fur
niture.
Well, that last part isn't exactly true.
When I moved in with Brad at the end
of the summer, the apartment was
blessed with furniture. We had couches,
tables, chairs and shelves.
We had shelves! Do you realize how
much we take shelves for granted in our
society? Shelves are such a sign of
strength. Shelves say, "Hey, don't put
all that stuff on the floor. Put it up
here. I can hold it for you." I have no
shelves. All my stuff is on the floor.
When the person who was occupying
my room left, she took all her stuff and
left our house naked. Brad and I each
have a bed and a lot of boxes. Brad has a
computer and a stereo. I have a Disc
man and a pair of high-top cross train
ers. It is now late January and we final
ly have two love seats, a bean bag and a
TV in the family room.
"Life away from Stanford" is not all
it's cracked up to be. Realize what you
have when you live in a dorm. Shelves
are right up there. Dorm rooms are
heated. Complain all you want about
leftover points, but you don't have to
eat pasta every night.

In our apartment we use the stove
more than we use the heater. We cook
pasta two ways: for lunch, and for dinner.
There are certain essential lessons
you only learn once you leave Stanford
housing. I can't believe frosh nowadays
get four years of guaranteed housing.
As convenient as it is, it's a bad idea.
I'm not saying I had to ride my bike
back and forth to campus, uphill both
ways, but I learned a lot about living on
my own. I pay rent checks every month,
I take out the garbage, and I try to do
my work while UNLV battles UC-Santa
Barbara at midnight on the tube.
However, campus housing has one
thing the real world can never have:
hallways. They are the greatest thing
about college life, especially when you
first get here. You never know when the
guy down the hall is going to bust out
his guitar and you join him in the hall
for a chorus of "Michael Rowed the Boat
Ashore." You could be up until 4 a.m.
talking to some dude from South Dako
ta about the National League MVP in
1988. And what about sports? You could
have a Dorm Olympics if you really
tried. Make up a flag, invite all the
dorms of the world. You'd go far, baby.
But once you get that piece of paper
— Stanford's answer to the Nestle's
$100,000 Bar — it's different. You've
got sinks that stay leaky because you're
too lazy to call the landlord. You've got
cold, two-love-seat, pasta-cooked-in,
hardwood floor apartments and a nine
to-five schedule. And you hate it

because when you don't know what to
do on your free weeknights, there's no
one down the hall to give you any
advice.
Looking back, junior year is the best
or worst — year here. If you've
planned every minute detail of your
Stanford career, you set aside this time
to go overseas, maybe stop out, or final
ly get to Sunken Diamond (a rite of pas
sage for all Stanford students). On the
other hand, if you are getting by in your
classes, but petrified by the "Stanford
lessness" that awaits you, you know you
can pick your major early in the year
and rationalize yourself to death by say
ing, "Only $30,000 for a master's
degree? What a steal!"
My advice is to do it all. Take 20 units
every quarter with no sports, no music,
no art. Live on campus all your life.
Don't go to any basketball games, and
don't you even dare say you like the
Hand, (let a master's, write your disser
tation, invent a new graduate decree.
Maybe you'll find happiness in that.
Just make sure you have somewhere
to sit.

in communication. He and Brad hope
you all buy ads, so they can eat chicken.

My advice is to do it all. Take 20 units
every quarter with no sports, no music,
no art. Live on campus all your life.
Don't go to any basketball games, and
don't you even dare say you like the
Hand, (let a master's, write your disser
tation, invent a new graduate decree.
Maybe you'll find happiness in that.
Just make sure you have somewhere
to sit.
