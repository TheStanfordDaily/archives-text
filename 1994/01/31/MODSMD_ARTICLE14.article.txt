## Daily needs to improve coverage of graduate issues 
### 
THE DAILY needs a stronger gradu
ate student voice. Between the
Supercollider and Viennese Ball
are all those Ph.D.'s who brought us the
knowledge to build SLAC some 20 years
ago, and with it the mind set, staff fund
ing, and cultural heritage to put on a
Viennese ball. I don't remember when
the Ball first came to Stanford, but I do
remember elementary school field trips
to SLAC before the frosh class was born.
And now, as I sit in Stanford classes for
the first time this year, I realize that
both our daily newspaper and undergrad
uate students could benefit from a little
more dialogue with their elder statesmen
and women.
The Jan. 24 front page story on the
Graduate School of Business exhibition
of the AIDS quilt was a notable exception
to the daily dearth of graduate news.
Last quarter, The Daily's coverage of the
$35 graduate student refund on student
activities, while important, signals two
things: first, student activities and
undergraduate socialization probably
isn't the best way for most graduates,
many of whom have families, to develop
a dialogue with our undergraduate com
patriots. Second, if this fee revolt was the
primary graduate news story of Autumn
1993, The Daily hasn't looked very far

for a multiplicity of stories that repre
sents our population.
Between energetic activism and abject
nihilism is life. Reality. A lot of us grads
have simply lived enough longer to taste
life's sweetness, bitterness and many
shades in between. I would in no way
insist that the difference between ages 30
and 20 develops a profound change in
wisdom. It has, however, given me just a
little more experience in what it feels like
to succeed and fail. And while I still sub
scribe more than ever to the credo of
carpe diem, I can say that living a Jack
Kerouac existence of day-to-day life can
get exhausting if you aren't reaching for
something out there.
I can't remember who said "Make no
little plans," and I don't have
"Bartlett's" handy at my computer. But
to put this in beer commercial lingo, any
one who has taken a CS course knows
that she/he who doesn't "go for the
gusto" from day one has a good chance of
not making it early on. Likewise, in the
workplace it's tough figuring out what I
have talent at, or finishing anything bet
ter than with mediocrity. I haven't met
too many people at Stanford who'd be
happy with a mediocre lifestyle, whether
your gig is bucks or some other self-ful
fillment.

And after all these years, Stanford
still seems to me like the most together,
intelligent, and multicultural place m the
universe, particularly compared to the
dog-eat-dog, close-minded, interpersonal
ly-deprived environment I faced as an
undergraduate at Cornell from 1981-
1986. 1 hope that by 1994 Cornell may
have thawed out its climatically and
socially frigid community since the
demise of the 12-year Republican regime
and the advent of coffee houses to
upstate New York. I haven't been back.
Furthering this bi-coastal contrast, at
Stanford I learned crucial, early-life
lessons in individual respect and dignity
while attending the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center 13 years
ago (then GPU). As a closeted gay high
school student, I found a world of accep
tance and possibility at Stanford. At Cor
nell, I unlearned a lot of these early
lessons in respect for myself and for oth
ers, testing HIV positive in 1985. After
the shell shock, two years later I really
came to learn the meaning of carpe diem.
The life of an undergrad naturally tends
toward the extreme, but the intensity of
daily life takes on whole new meaning
when living with a terminal illness.
In retrospect Cornell has made me
realize that Stanford's value of respect,

dignity, and Socratic discipline — mean
ingful dialogue — form the foundation to
creating both purposeful daily life and
future plans that you hope to hell will
have some meaning for yourself and your
community. These life experiences
should be better represented in The
Daily, by the sum total of its population.
Nearly a decade has passed since I left
Cornell and tested HIV positive, and
exactly one year has elapsed since I
turned 30. I often find myself surprised
that I'm still very much alive and
healthy, but not really enjoying life. Dori
an Gray had 10 years on me before the
mirror cracked, but he wasn't having fun
anymore .... So rather than face a self
loathing demise I must make plans once
more, and it is no surprise that Stanford
is once again the first step toward trying
to make a better future. Like everyone
on campus, the graduate population at
Stanford represents a diversity of hopes
and aspirations that deserve to be voiced
in our daily newspaper: Wo look like you,
sound like you, sometimes even act like
you .... Hell, we are you.
