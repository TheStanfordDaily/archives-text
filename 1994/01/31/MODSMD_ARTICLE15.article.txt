# Keep Casper's personal habits out of interview
## 
### 
Two issues in the Jan. 21 Daily high
light administration styles and trends
which can only be deplored. One details an
interview with University President Ger

hard Casper and the other relates to a
newly created position at the Vice Provost
level.
Presidential views need not always con
cern the fundamental matter of education
al policy and goals, to be sure, but there is
absolutely no need for a disclosure of those
about growing a beard, eating apples, bor
ing lectures heard from the back row at

the University of Chicago, etc. The editori
al staff interviewer who pressed for the
explicit spelling of a "terrible" word ought
to be reassigned before engaging in similar
"friendly" exchanges elsewhere on cam
pus.
Adding another administrator (to an
already large staff) who will take charge of
faculty recruitment and development as

well as the burden of makingjunior facul
ty members "more comfortable" evidences
wishful thinking; does anyone imagine
that individual departments will welcome
outside guidance or direction in these mat
ters? I doubt it.
