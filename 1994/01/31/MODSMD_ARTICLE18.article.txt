## Cardinal stomps rough Trojans, 76-67 Strong bench effort, 31-of-45 from foul line boosts Stanford to a much needed victory 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
USC learned on Saturday night
that when you are playing against
the Stanford men's basketball
team, it takes more than a pair of
aggressive forwards to pull off a
victory.
In one of the most physical con
tests of the season for the Cardinal,
Stanford (11-5, 4-3 Pacific 10 Con
ference) survived a tenacious inside
attack by the Trojans, prevailing at
Maples Pavilion 76-67.
Although the Cardinal never
trailed during the game, USC (10-
7, 3-5) kept things relatively close
by dominating on the offensive
boards.
"They were playing three big
guys, and we knew that was going
to be a problem," said Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery. "It's
hard to hold your spot, and we
didn't have time to go into the
weight room (at halftime)."
Ijed by big men Lorenzo Orr (6-
foot-7, 200 pounds) and Tremayne
Anchrum (6-5, 235), the Trojans
grabbed almost twice as many
offensive rebounds as the Cardinal,
enabling their players to score on
many follow-up shots near the bas

ket. Orr and Anchrum alone
teamed up for 15 boards and 31
points on the night.
"Under the basket on rebounds,
USC is really good at getting posi
tion," explained Stanford forward
Andy Poppink, sophomore.
Farther away from the hoop,
however, the Trojans performed
rather unimpressively. USC
guards Brandon Martin and Burt
Harris converted on only three of
15 shot attempts.
In some ways, Stanford benefit
ed from the Trojans' aggressive
style, as it earned 45 free-throw
opportunities. While getting fouled
accounted for a substantial portion
of the Cardinal's point total, it also
prevented Stanford from executing
its typical fast-paced offense.
"It had to be a boring game to
watch because it was slow and slug
gish," said Poppink, who scored 12
of his 18 points from the charity
stripe.
Less than five minutes into the
contest, the Cardinal stretched a
slim two-point lead into a less sub
stantial eight-point advantage
thanks to a barrage of spectacular
plays.
Sophomore Dion Cross started
things off on one of the few Stan

ford fast-breaks by driving past
several USC defenders to lay the
ball through the hoop. On the
ensuing Trojan possession, fresh
man Brevin Knight swiped the ball
from Martin and fed senior Brent
Williams for a wide-open double
pump slam dunk. The next time
the Cardinal touched the ball,
Cross buried a 19-foot jumper from
the corner.
From that point, Stanford's
advantage never shrunk to more
than five points, and for most of
the game, it stayed in double-digits.
The Cardinal's ability to hold a
comfortable lead for the remainder
of the game was particularly note
worthy considering that Knight
and Williams fell into foul trouble
early on.
"At one point, they were down
to having used almost everyone on
the bench in the first half," said
USC coach George Raveling. "We
had a multitude of opportunities."
Yet the Trojans, who have lost
five games in a row, failed to capi
talize on any chances which Stan
ford may have allotted them.
"If this was a first-aid course,
they'd say 'stop the bleeding, pro
