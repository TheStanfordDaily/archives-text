# Women's hoops loses two
## 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
The champion rode into town on Super
Bowl weekend, all momentum and quiet con
fidence and even a hint of the swagger that
had accompanied its past glory.
Yet instead of improving its chances for a
sixth-straight Pacific 10 Conference title and
adding to the four-game winning streak it
owned heading into Southern California, the
Cardinal women's basketball team got buf
faloed by two outstanding individual perfor
mances and left the scene with a pair of
crushing defeats.
Friday night Natalie Williams provided
the spark as unheralded UCLA knocked off
lOth-ranked Stanford 80-73 before a sparse
crowd of 1,283 at Pauley Pavilion. The senior
forward, who pounded her way to 24 points
and 16 rebounds on 9-of-14 shooting, con
vert etl two layups to open the game and ral
lied her team to leads of 13-2 and 17-6 en
route to a 40-30 halftime advantage in a
game that the Bruins (10-7, 5-3 in the Pac
-10) would never trail.
After the intermission, the Cardinal (11-
5, 4-3) looked inside to junior forward Rachel
Hemmer and junior center Anita Kaplan in
an effort to slow Williams and gain more
high-percentage opportunites after connect
ing on just 14 of its 33 first-half field goal
attempts.
Hemmer and Kaplan answered the call,
turning a spree of offensive rebounds into 18
of Stanford's 25 points in the first 13 min
utes of the second period. While the Cardi
nal's two leading scorers were both headed
for "double-doubles" — Hemmer finished
the evening with 21 points and 12 rebounds
(both team highs) and Kaplan added 16
points and 10 boards — Stanford only man
aged to close the gap to 62-55 at the seven
minute mark.
I'CLA's other offensive weapons then
kicked into gear, as senior guard Detra I/ock
hart (17 points, five assists, six steals) and
senior forward Amy Jalewalia (21 points)
accounted for the next eight Bruin points
and the margin st<x>d at 70-61 with 4:31
remaining.
Four-consecutive short jumpers by

Kaplan, sophomore forward Bobbie Kelsey,
junior guard Kate Paye and Kaplan again
helped the Cardinal make it interesting at
72-69 with three minutes left. But the teams
then traded misses and Stanford resorted to
fouls when it did not force steals out of a full
court press defense. UCLA hit 8-of-ll free
throws down the stretch to seal Stanford's
fate and secure the Bruins' first win over the
Cardinal since 1988.
With much of the luster removed from an
anticipated one-two conference matchup yes
terday with eighth-ranked USC, Stanford
succumbed to the Trojans 115-1, 8-0) and the
dominant play of senior forward Lisa Leslie
before a Super Sunday matinee crowd of
1,077 at the Lyon Center.
The Cardinal again fell victim to a slow
start, as USC led 17-2 afler eight minutes of
play and appeared to run any comeback hopes
out of the arena. Leslie tallied nine of her
career-high 34 points in the early spurt, and
passed former Stanford great Val Whiting as
the all-time leading scorer in Pac-10 history
on a layup five minutes into the game.
USC maintained its 2-1-2 full-court pres
sure defense and a double-figure lead for
much of the first period, but with the Tro
jans holding a 36-26 edge at the two-minute
mark, Cardinal freshman forward Tar a H;ir
rington came off the bench to throw in all
eight of her points as Stanford closed to 38-
36 at the break.
Freshman forward KateStarbird, who led
the Cardinal with 18 points, had the hot
hand when the teams came out of the locker
room, scoring six of Stanford's first 10 points
and giving her team a 46-44 advantage.
"We were riding a wave of optimism after
closing the first half strong," she explained.
"We actually had them scared."
The Cardinal extended its margin to as
many as six, but an unl)owed used a
59-59 stalemate at the nine-minute mark to
embark on a tear in which she netted eight of
the Trojans' next 12 points as USC seized a
71-61 lead with four minutes remaining and
never looked back.
With the losses, the Cardinal slipped
three-and-a-half games back of the front
running Trojans as the midpoint of the con
ference schedule approaches after this week.
