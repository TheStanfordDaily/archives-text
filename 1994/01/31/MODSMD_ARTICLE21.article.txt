# Women's swimming drowns USC, UCLA
## 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — There were very
few surprises this weekend in the world
of sports.
Dallas won the Super Bowl. Bud Light
won the Bud Bowl. And the Stanford
women's swim squad made a clean sweep
of two dual meets in Southern California.
Tell us something that we didn't
already know.
The Cardinal drowned USC 173-127
Friday, then slapped the UCLA Bruins
174-124 Saturday to keep its unbeaten
(and unchallenged) winning streak alive.
"This was a very good two-day effort
of competing and performing for our
team," coach Richard Quick said of the
Los Angeles road trip. "Both USC and
UCI.A will be in the top ten at NCAAs,
and it was not automatic that we were

going to win or dominate these meets."
Perhaps not automatic, but the Cardi
nal performed like clockwork. Stanford
made it look easy, overcoming the travel
fatigue and a 5.0 aftershock that woke
the team up in the middle of the morning
to extend its record to 5-0 in the Pacific
10 Conference.
USC threatened Stanford early, look
ing for the upset. But the Cardinal, led by
the combined six victories from junior
Jenny Thompson, senior Lea Loveless,
and freshman Sarah Anderson, subdued
the feisty Trojans.
"USC was prepared to knock us oft,"
said Loveless, who qualified for the
NCAA tournament in Indianapolis in the
100 meter backstroke. "That was their
goal, and it was good practice for us in
preparation for NCAAs."
Thompson qualified for the big tour
nev in the 50 and 100 freestvle races,

while junior Becky Crowe barely
squeaked by the automatic qualification
time in the 200 butterfly.
"If the qualifying times came, then we
would be excited," Loveless said. "But
that wasn't necessarily our goal."
Crowe provided much of the excite
ment over the weekend. She pulled out
first-place finishes in all four of her indi
vidual events, and three of those victories
were by less than one second over the sec
ond-place finisher.
"(These were) very good, very tough
meets," Quick said. "We won, but we won
ugly."
The victories were only ugly in that
both the Trojans and the Bruins still had
slim hopes for victories after the first few
events. On the whole, the meets were
controlled bv the Cardinal.
"We were looking to swim hard
and see how we competed with
them," Loveless said. "It was a
hard weekend mentally."
It was an even tougher week
end for the Stanford diving
squad, which crawled sluggishly

through a difficult road trip.
The only Cardinal to capture a
victory was freshman Britt Mat
tern on the three-meter diving
board against UCLA.
Overall, however, the Cardi
nal delivered a stellar perfor
mance.
"The meets weren't too close
because we were ready and very
tough," Quick said.
