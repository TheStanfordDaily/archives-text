# Cardinal slammed by Titan bats

### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
They don't call 'em Titans for
nothing.
Fifth-ranked Cal State Fuller
ton pounded out 26 runs and 37
hits to take two of three games
from the No. 12 Cardinal this past
weekend at Sunken Diamond.
Stanford's young and inexperi
enced starting rotation took much
of the pounding.
On Friday, sophomore Dan
Reed was chased after only 3 1/3
innings. Fullerton immediately
capitalized on Reed's wildness, and
t he Stanford bullpen was unable to
keep the game close against the
explosive Titan hitters as the Car
dinal fell 12-2.
Ail-American center fielder
Dante Powell led the offensive
charge for Titans, going 4-for-6,
including a towering homer deep
into the pine trees in left with one
out in the sixth inning.
"1 Powell] is a great talent and I
think he's one of the premier col
lege players in the country," said
Stanford coach Mark Marquess.
"He should be a first round pick [in
the professional draft 1."
Fullerton right-hander Mike

Parisi stifled the Cardinal all day,
allowing only two runs on eight
hits iri seven innings of work while
getting out of tough situations by
leaving numerous Cardinal run
ners stranded on base.
"Our offense came through big
for us, and it really made it easier,"
Parisi said. "Wo just battled
through and pick»»d up the win."
The Cardinal bounced back on
Saturday, holding off a late Titan
rally to prevail 7-6. "This is a huge
win," said senior right fielder Rod
Meyer. "This is the kind of game
we couldn't win last year "
Sophomore Todd Rartels not
only started his first game for the
Cardinal, lie also picked up his first
collegiate win, giving up only throe
runs and nine hits through seven
innings.
"Todd has gotten a lot better
from last year," said sophomore
catcher A.J. Hinch, Bartels' bat
tery mate. "He came out today and
put his best against their best and
ho came out on top."
In the third game, the Cardinal
found itself behind early by scores of
6-0 and 7-4, but fought back to tie
the game at seven with three runs
in the bottom of the fifth inning.
Highly touted freshman right

hander Jason Middlebrook couldn't
make it out of the second inning and
his relief, fellow freshman Mark
Will iams, also had trouble slowing
down the Titan offense, only record
ing one out in the fourth inning.
Freshman Tom Reimers then
stepped m to pitch 7 2/3 innings of
relief, allowed only one run.
Despite his excellent relief, the
Cardinal was unable to get any
thing going against the equally
tough Titan bullpen, as Cal State
Fullerton scored the go-ahead run
in the eleventh inning and Stan
ford fell, 8-7.
Even after dropping two of
three to the Titans, Marquess
believes Stanford's aggressive style
of offensive play will pay dividends
as the season progresses.
"We got a couple of RBI base
hits on 3-0 counts, and we were
really pleased with that," Mar
quess said. "We want to be aggres
sive with the bat."
However, the spirit on the Car
dinal team is still very high, as it
expects to do well this season.
"Today we showed everyone
here that we a\n play with the big
boys and that we're going to sur
prise a lot of people this year," Bar
tels said.
