# Unlucky grapplers drop weekend set

Faced with a barrage of Bull
dogs, Cowboys and Mustangs,
the Stanford wrestlers found
neither wins nor luck on the
road this weekend as they suf
fered three disappointing dual
losses, dropping their dual
record to 2-6.
The first loss came Friday
against No. 7 Fresno State. The
Bulldogs nearly shut out the Car
dinal, coming away with nine of
the ten matches and winning the
meet 34-2.
One of the initial signs that
luck wasn't on Stanford's side
occurred when Cardinal Matt
Cano (126 lbs.) lost by one point

to
Fresno's Nick Zinkin. Leading for
most of the match, Cano injured
his knee and succumbed to a last
second takedown in the final peri
od to lose the match, 8-7.
Sophomore Ed Medina filled in
for Jimmy Aguirre (142), who did
not wrestle due to a sprained
neck, which he injured earlier
this week in practice. Medina,
who normally wrestles at 134,
could not secure a win for the
Cardinal. Co-captain Jay Jackson
(134) fared similarly as he lost to
Nick Zinkin's brother Dewayne,
7-3.
Stanford's sole win came from
sophomore Tod Surmon (158),
and even that victory was bitter
sweet. While his win should have

contributed three points to the
team score, the official awarded
the Cardinal only two points after
Surmon threw his headgear from
the excitement following his win.
"It would have been difficult to
beat [Fresno), but they beat us
easier than they should have,"
said head coach Chris Horpel.
At the start of the following
meet against Wyoming, it looked
like the Cardinal might compen
sate for its previous loss. Despite
his knee injury, Cano beat Cow
boy Troy Gunther 16-6 to put the
Cardinal on the board. Jackson
contributed more points toward
the Stanford total as he won his
match by forfeit.
