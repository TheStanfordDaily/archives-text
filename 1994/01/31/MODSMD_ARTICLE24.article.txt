# Women's tennis blasts Rainbows, Huskies
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
The Stanford women's tennis team
began its dual-meet season with two
home matches against Hawaii and
Washington over the weekend. In the
process, it found that if there is parity
among collegiate women's tennis teams,
it certainly doesn't extend too far down.
Despite missing two of its top players,
the second-ranked Cardinal (2-0)
smashed both of these unranked foes in
the friendly confines of the Stanford
Tennis Stadium. Stanford dropped only
two sets total and displayed an imposing
depth over the two days.
"The first one against Hawaii |Thurs-
day! went pretty well," said Stanford
head coach Frank Brennan. "We were a
little flat and they were pretty good so it
was a fairly competitive match."
"Competitive" is a bit misleading in
this context. The Rainbows were unable
to win a set against a sloppy but effective
Cardinal lineup, which won all nine
matches. Perhaps the most competitive
of the nine matches Thursday afternoon
was the number one singles match
which Stanford senior Kristine Kurth
won 7-5, 6-4, the longest match of the
afternoon. The other five singles match
es and three doubles matches were much
shorter, marred only by Stanford play,
which Brennan found somewhat lack
adaisical.
"I think it's a tough week academical
ly for the kids so they weren't quite
ready for [Hawaii]," he said. "I think
they were a little bit complacent."

"Not that we had any struggles, but it
wasn't pretty," he added.
Friday's matchup against Pacific 10
Conference rival Washington saw almost
identical end results, hut contained
much better tennis. Fielding the same
lineup as against the Rainbows, Stan
ford won eight of nine matches, losing
only the number one doubles match.

'That first doubles match
got away from us ... It
didn't start well and it
didn't end well. Hopeful
ly it doesn't happen
against USC or Cal or
something.'
— Frank Brennan

"Today was significantly better
because Washington is significantly bet
ter than Hawaii, and the scores were
about the same, so therefore we raised
our game quite a bit," Brennan said.
Some of the most outstanding play
came from Kurth, again playing in the
number one singles slot. She blasted
Lisa Proctor 6-0, 6-1 with strong ground
strokes and a nasty service-return game
that had Proctor crisscrossing the court
after every second-service.
"Lisa Proctor is a nice, solid player,"
said Brennan. "And Kristine just embar

rassed her. She |Proctor| ran off the
court."
Kurth was also involved in the only
Stanford loss so far in this young season.
She and freshman Emily Burt, her num
ber one doubles partner, lost an intense
match to Huskies' Kim Frost and April
Appel 6-3, 7-6 (9-7).
"That first doubles match got away
from us," Brennan said. "It didn't start
well and it didn't end well. Hopefully it
doesn't happen against USC or Cal or
something.
"It just didn't click today."
The team was missing senior Lax mi
Poruri, who was playing in a pro tour
nament in Austin, Texas, and sopho
more Kim Shasby due to a minor anklr
injury. When these two are healthy,
both will play singles and doubles
Therefore, the team of Burt/Kurth was
most likely the only doubles team that
saw action this weekend which will stay
together the rest of the season. At times
the team meshed well, behind a speedy
Burt and a hard-hitting Kurth, but laps
es and sloppy play at critical moments
cost the team the match to a consistent
Husky duo.
"They're a new team and they will
learn to play together and hopefully get
it worked out," Brennan said. "They can
really play some great doubles."
Stanford's next dual meet is at home
tomorrow against Fresno State at 1:30
p.m. Some lineup changes may occur for
the Cardinal as Shasby may be healthy
enough to play doubles. Poruri will be
back, but Brennan was unsure if she
would play.
