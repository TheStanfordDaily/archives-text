# Men's swimming tops UC-Santa Barbara

### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
For the Stanford men's swim
team, this weekend's win over
UC-Santa Barbara was largely a
learning experience.
In improving their unblem
ished dual-meet record to 7-0,
the Cardinal used the non
league competition to give their
freshmen travelling and racing
experience. Despite leaving
behind several top racers, Stan
ford had little difficulty in out
distancing the Gauchos.
Distance swimmer Kevin
Radvany, freshman, took the
opportunity and turned in first

place finishes in the 500 and
1000-yard freestyles.
"I was happy with my
swims," Radvany said. "It was a
long ride [to UCSB]. There was
enough competition between
the team to race well. We
weren't so much racing Santa
Barbara as we were racing each
other."
Radvany, who hails from
Titusville, N.J., is enjoying his
role on the Cardinal's two-time
defending NCAA champion
squad.
"It's different here," he said.
"The team is great and a lot
closer than my (club| team at
home."

Phil Trinidad, another fresh
man, has experienced a new
style of training since arriving at
Stanford.
"I've never done this much
speed work before," he said.
"We're doing a lot of high inten
sity work. The level of athleti
cism and the level of swimmers
here is so high. It takes every
thing up a couple of notches
when you get to train with the
best swimmers in the world.
"I'm training harder than
ever and doing things different
ly and better," Trinidad contin
ued. "It's taking its toll right
now, but I know in the end it
will be good."
