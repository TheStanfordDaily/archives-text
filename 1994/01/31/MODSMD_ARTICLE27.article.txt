# Tennis demolishes Hawaii and San Diego
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Even without the full services of
two of its top players, the Stanford
men's tennis team was nearly
invincible in its first two dual
matches of 1994. Against the Uni
versity of Hawaii Thursday and
the University of San Diego Satur
day, the Cardinal dropped only two
sets in 12 singles and six doubles
matches.
Although senior Michael Flana
gan, Stanford's No. 1 singles and
doubles player, and sophomore Jim
Thomas did not see action in the

two matches, the Cardinal did not
seem to need them.
"I'm very, very pleas<*d with the
guys," said Stanford head coach
Dick Gould of the team's play.
"They competed well and played
intelligently."
Stanford jumped all over the
Rainbows Thursday, winning by a
final score of 7-0. Though it would
have been easy for the Cardinal to
look past a team that it beat easily
in the fall, Stanford avoided sloppy
play with simple domination.
"It was a good workman-like
job," Could said. "It was nice to
have a good match for us before

Saturday."
Stanford went up 1-0 after tak
ing all three doubles matches,
which were played in the new
eight-game pro-set format. Chris
Cocotos, senior, teamed up with
senior Robert Devens in Flana
gan's absence to win their match 8-
2. Senior Vimal Patel and sopho
more Jeff Salzenstein had some
trouble, but pulled out their match
9-8. Ricky Becker, sophomore, and
Billy Wright, senior, scored per
fectly at third doubles, 8-0.
Singles featured more of the
same, with every Stanford player
winning in straight sets. Of partic

ular interest was Thomas' win at
sixth singles in his first appearance
since injuring his rotator cuff.
Undoubtedly the most impres
sive performance of the day
belonged to Becker, who beat his
Rainbow opponent 6-0, 6-0 to fin
ish the day without dropping a
game.
"Ricky moved well, and set up
his points very well," Gould said.
Saturday saw Stanford face a
much more talented team in the
San Diego Toreros. Although most
matches up and down the lineup
