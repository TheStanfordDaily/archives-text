# Tennis demolishes Hawaii and San Diego
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Even without the full services of
two of its top players, the Stanford
men's tennis team was nearly
invincible in its first two dual
matches of 1994. Against the Uni
versity of Hawaii Thursday and
the University of San Diego Satur
day, the Cardinal dropped only two
sets in 12 singles and six doubles
matches.
Although senior Michael Flana
gan, Stanford's No. 1 singles and
doubles player, and sophomore Jim
Thomas did not see action in the

two matches, the Cardinal did not
seem to need them.
"I'm very, very pleas<*d with the
guys," said Stanford head coach
Dick Gould of the team's play.
"They competed well and played
intelligently."
Stanford jumped all over the
Rainbows Thursday, winning by a
final score of 7-0. Though it would
have been easy for the Cardinal to
look past a team that it beat easily
in the fall, Stanford avoided sloppy
play with simple domination.
"It was a good workman-like
job," Could said. "It was nice to
have a good match for us before

Saturday."
Stanford went up 1-0 after tak
ing all three doubles matches,
which were played in the new
eight-game pro-set format. Chris
Cocotos, senior, teamed up with
senior Robert Devens in Flana
gan's absence to win their match 8-
2. Senior Vimal Patel and sopho
more Jeff Salzenstein had some
trouble, but pulled out their match
9-8. Ricky Becker, sophomore, and
Billy Wright, senior, scored per
fectly at third doubles, 8-0.
Singles featured more of the
same, with every Stanford player
winning in straight sets. Of partic

ular interest was Thomas' win at
sixth singles in his first appearance
since injuring his rotator cuff.
Undoubtedly the most impres
sive performance of the day
belonged to Becker, who beat his
Rainbow opponent 6-0, 6-0 to fin
ish the day without dropping a
game.
"Ricky moved well, and set up
his points very well," Gould said.
Saturday saw Stanford face a
much more talented team in the
San Diego Toreros. Although most
matches up and down the lineup
were battles, the little victories
were won by the Cardinal, adding
up to a 6-1 win.
Cocotos and Uevens won their
match at No. 1 doubles, 8-6, com
ing though after a 6-6 tie. Likewise,
Becker and Wright won 8-5 at No.
3 doubles after a tie at 5-5. Patel
and Salzenstein, jumping out to a
7-2 lead at second doubles, held off
their opponents to win 8-4.
The featured singles match of
the day was in Court No. 1, where
the llth-rated singles player,
Devens, faced Frederik Axsater,
ranked No. 10 nationally in singles.
Devens won 6-4, 6-4 in a match
which was even closer than the
score belies.
"Hobby stayed in a match
against a great player," Gould said.
"To get ahead, stay ahead and close
it out was quite an accomplish
ment."

At No. 2 singles, Salzenstein
continued his great play in his
match against Torero Emmanuel
Udozorh, winning 6-2, 6-3.
Though Salzenstein had a bit of
trouble with his serve, Gould
pointed out that it is nothing which
is not correctable.

'To get ahead, stay
ahead and close it out
was quite an accom
plishment.'

"Jeff attacked well, especially
with his backhand volley," Gould
said.
Cocotos also won his singles
match in straight sets against
Robert Pavliska at No. 3 singles, 6-
3, 6-3, showing himself to be a ver
satile player in the process.
"|Cocotos| played his points
very intelligently," Gould said. "He

played within himself, and mixed
his style of play effectively."
On the back courts, Stanford
was slightly less effective. At No. 4
singles, Fatel lost to Torero oppo
nent Philippe Hofmann 6-3, 6-3.
Although Patel played well in dou
bles, a tough opponent wore him
down in singles.
"Vimal did the best his could,"
said assistant head coach John
Whitlinger. "He was a little under
the weather, and [Hofmann! made
him hit a lot of balls. That's tough
when you're not feeling 100 per
cent."
Becker looked good at fifth sin
gles, winning 6-3, 6-3 against
Hobby Hrdina. Wright, taking over
for a continually shoulder-ham
pered Thomas at No. 6 singles, was
also very effective against his oppo
nent, beating J.J. Shobar 6-2, 6-3.
"Ricky and Hilly both did a good
job once they became patient and
didn't rush their shots,"
Whitlinger said. "In both of those
matches 1 felt good about how they
played."
