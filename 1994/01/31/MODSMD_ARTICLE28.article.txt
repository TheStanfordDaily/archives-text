# Gymnasts get revenge
## 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
After falling to Washington by
less than a point last season, the
13th-ranked Stanford women's
gymnastics team repaid the loss
with a vengeance last Friday by
beating the No. 19 Huskies in
Burnham Pavilion.
Winning each event and reel
ing in a final team score of
188.325, Stanford dominated
both Washington (186.025), and
the Sacramento State Hornets
(174 .425) of the Big West Confer
ence. Freshman Katie Jen
nings won the meet with a score
of 38.450 and sophomore Hillary
Anderson's 37.925 earned her
second place.
While pleased with the victory
over a Pacific 10 Conference foe,
neither the Cardinal coaches nor
the gymnasts thought the team's
performance was up to par.
"We are doing some very big
skills and we really increased our
difficulty from last year, but we
need to hit our routines more
consistently," said head coach
Breck Greenwood.
"We also need to do better at
practice — we have some great
days, but we have a few average
days too."
It took the Stanford team
awhile to warm up to competi
tion, with four out of the six gym
nasts falling on at least one of
their two vaults. Because the
Huskies and the Hornets were
plagued with falls as well, Stan

ford's score of 46.875 was enough
to capture first place. Washing
ton and Sacramento State scored
46.575 and 45.550, respectively.
Junior Jene Flzie won this
event with a powerful vault that
earned a 9.700, with second and
third places going to Husky gym
nasts Fileen Castillo and Chris
tine Niebling. Though they each
fell on the landings of their first
vaults, Jennings and junior Mee
gan Lannin finishing their sec
ond vaults solidly, earning
respective scores of 9.475 and
9.400.
"We are doing new vaults and
are really pushing it," Greenwood
said. "We are making them in
practice, but when the team gets
anxious at meets, they become
tight and don't stay aggressive."
The team improved only
slightly on their uneven bar per
formance, with three gymnasts
taking falls. The other three Car
dinal performers made up for the
lost points and took the top three
places on this event. Anderson
finished first with a score of
9.750, while Jennings followed
with a score of 9.700 and Flzie
shared third place and a score of
9.675 with Washington's Cather
ine Williams.
The overall bar score for the
Cardinal was 46.700, surpassing
the Huskies' 45.425 and the Hor
nets' 43.150.

the beam were unexpected.
Greenwood noted Lannin's
improved ability to perform solid
dismounts, yet the gymnast still
did not stick her bar dismount.
"It was just one of those
flukes," Lannin said. "I knew
before I landed that I wasn't
rotated enough, but it's not going
to happen again."
Stanford began to regain its
composure on the beam, winning
the event with a team score of

46.825. First and second places
went to Anderson (9.675) and
Jennings (9.575) while Husky
gymnast Stacy Connolly took
third place with a score of 9.550.
Washington had an overall score
of 46.400 and Sacramento State
had 42.175.
The enthusiastic crowd grew
silent after two of Stanford's top
beam workers, Elzie and junior
Tina Snowden took surprising
falls off the apparatus. For Elzie,
Friday's fall off the beam was only
the third in her entire career at
Stanford.
The Cardinal finally reached its
potential, delivering a vibrant per

formance on the floor exercise.
Though first place went to Wash
ington's Christine Niebling, who
had a score of 9.725, Snowden and
Jennings were close behind in sec
ond place, each with scores of 9.700
Each of the other gymnasts
performing on the floor — Lan
nin, Anderson, Elzie and sopho
more Linda Chun — were crowd
pleasers as well, executing rou
tines filled with character.
"The crowd loves our rou
tines," assistant coach Robert
Shawler said. "The team just
needs to be more confident, and
know that they can do their tricks
successfully."
