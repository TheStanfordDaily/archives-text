# Cost-effective, 'more intimate care'
## Midwifery service back in practice at Stanford Hospital 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
In our times of trauma centers and
dual heart-liver transplants, midwives
may seem like an anachronism from the
pages of a Dickens novel. Rut they're
back.
Recognizing the benefits of the per

sonal care that trained professional mid
wives can provide, Stanford Hospital has
incorporated a midwifery service into its
gynecology and obstetrics clinic.
The decision to institute the service
was made last June, and it has been in
operation since last September, accord
ing to Jean Rasch, a midwife at the hos
pital. Previously, midwives were only al

lowed to accompany patients as private
practitioners.
Rasch said a midwife ideally has con
tinuous personal contact with a patient
from preconception counseling through
the sixth week after birth Afterward,
she said, patients are still welcome to
come in for birth-control counsel
ing.
By contrast, in clinics without
midwives, patients may see a dif
ferent practitioner at each stage
of pregnancy. Rasch said nurse
midwifery gives patients "more
intimate care," and more pre
dictability about who will accom
pany them through labor. In addi

tion, it gives patients a safety level
equal to that offered by typical
medical practices. The cost to the
patient remains the same.
Today's midwives are a far cry
from the stereotypical self
trained matrons: they must be
registered nurses who have had
additional training in board
approved nurse-midwifery pro
grams.
A graduate of the nurse-mid
wifery program at UC-San Fran
cisco, Rasch has 11 years of expe
rience in private practice as a

nurse-midwife and divides her
time between Stanford and the
Sand Hill Women's Medical
Group.
Rasch is currently the only
midwife working at the hospital,
but the clinic is interviewing can
didates for another full-time mid
wife position and hopes to hire a
third by next January.
Rasch said midwifery has only
recently grown in popularity
"because midwives were not as
accepted historically," as igno
rance about the profession — cou

pled with the "economic threat"
they posed to other elements in
the health care industry — kept
the midwives out.
"[Physicians] didn't want to
share the turf and they didn't
want to share the dollars," she
said.
Rasch said the midwife mys
tique is fading away, and people
are finally beginning to accept
that nurse-midwives and other
non-physician health profession
als can provide care of equal or
superior quality at a lower cost.

"If you extend [health care
employment) into experts other
than physicians you'll be more
cost effective," she said.
Rasch said the hospital's mid
wifery service is also indicative of
a general trend away from acute
care toward "a whole new model"
of lifetime personal health care.
She pointed out that Surgeon
General Jocelyn Elders and Presi
dent Clinton seem to "really want
to put the emphasis into wellness
and health maintenance and
health prevention" rather than

acute care.
Rasch credited the institution
of the midwifery service to the
"combined vision" of Mary Lake
Polan, chair of gynecology and
obstetrics at the Medical Center,
Cecele Quaintance, coordinator
of maternity programs at the hos
pital and Maurice Druzin, a pro
fessor of gynecology and obstet
rics.
Polan said women today want
"personalized, low-tech care. I
think this is actually going to give
better patient care."
