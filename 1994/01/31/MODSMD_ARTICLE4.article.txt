# Stanford loses NCAA drug-testing lawsuit
## Athletes must comply to retain eligibility 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Knding a seven-year legal battle between
Stanford and the NCAA, the California
Supreme Court Friday ruled that the Uni
versity must allow its athletes to be tested
for drugs by the NCAA in order to maintain
NCAA eligibility.
In a 6-1 decision, the court found that the
right to privacy granted in the state consti
tution does not prevent the NCAA from con
ducting monitored collection of urine sam
ples, which are analyzed to determine
whether students have taken substances
ranging from performance-enhancing
steroids to marijuana to birth-control pills.
The decision closed the case, originally
filed in 1987 by a Stanford diver and later
joined by the University. Stanford had been
the only university to be exempted from
NCAA tests.
While it rejected the application of a right
to privacy in the Stanford case, the court's
ruling noted for the first time that the
state's right to privacy can be applied to pri
vate institutions. The implications of the de
cision are uncertain, but legal experts say it
may have a broad impact on drug testing
and other privacy-related issues in the
workplace.
Previous rulings had found that the
NCAA failed to demonstrate a "compelling
need" that wouldjustify the invasion of pri
vacy. The state's high court, however, ruled

that private institutions need not meet this
strict standard.
"I'm gratified that the court found that
the right to privacy applies to private insti
tutions," said Susan Harriman, who repre
sented the plaintiffs before the court.
Writing for the majority, Chief Justice
Malcom Lucas said, "We will not perpetuate
this kind of error by continuing to say 'com
pelling' when we mean merely 'legitimate'
or 'important.' . . . We should say what we
mean and mean what we say."
The court added that athletes have a "di
minished expectation of privacy," as Lucas
put it, because they submit themselves to
such things as physical examinations and
locker-room showers. Regular workers do
not have such diminished expectations, the
court decided.
Dissenting Justice Stanley Mosk said the
decision was a big step backward. "Today,
the majority take away from Stanford stu
dent athletes — and all other Californians
— the right of privacy guaranteed by" the
California Constitution," he wrote. "At the
same time, they grant the NCAA — and any
other intruding party — a right of publicity
based on nothing more than their own views
of good and bad policy."
New Stanford testing program
The NCAA will now be able to select
Stanford athletes at random for drug test-
ing during national championship
events in all sports. The athletic
association will also be able to con
duct on-campus tests for football
and track and field athletes.
Stanford Athletic Director Ted
Leland said the University will also
begin to develop its own drug test
ing and education policy in the
coming months. He added that the
program would be "subject to a
community-wide discussion" and
will "center around the issue of the
health and safety of our athletes."
Leland stressed that the Uni
versity would comply fully with
the court's ruling. "I'm comfort
able telling our players, 'No, you
have to do this,' " he said.
"In a way, I'm glad it's over, so
that now we can get on with it,"he
added.
Leland said the suit had
become a "public relations prob
lem" because it made it look like
Stanford was trying to cover up
drug abuse by athletes. But he

added, "We believe in our hearts
that Stanford athletes have com
peted clean."
He said the length of the law
suit complicated the case. "We
were arguing that there was no
evidence that performance
enhancing drugs were being used,"
he said, "and that just doesn't
stand up to 1994 scrutiny."
Still, Leland said the suit had
the positive result of encouraging
the NCAA to remodel its drug
testing program.
Pointing out that the NCAA no
longer bans certain ingredients in
over-the-counter cough medicines
and no longer asks students if
they are on the pill, Leland said,
"This new program is light years
ahead" of the NCAA standard
established in 1986, which was the
subject of the lawsuit.
"The NCAA program in 1986
was wrong. This one is better," he
added.
On the other hand, Stanford
graduate Simone LeVant, who filed
the original lawsuit, maintained
her position that the "most egre
gious aspect" of the testing — mon
itored urination — remains and is a

violation of the right to privacy.
The former captain of the div
ing team said she filed suit
because "there was a presumption
of guilt on the part of the NCAA,
and that athletes then had to
prove their innocence."
Mixed reactions
Sophomore volleyball player
Cary Wendell, who was tested at
the World University Games this
summer, said "above anything
else it's kind of a pain." She said
that being tested after competi
tion is difficult because athletes
could be separated from team
mates for a long time while
attempting to produce urine.
"Urinating in front of someone
is not the (most fun) thing in the
world, but it's all right with me,"
she said.
Swimmer Jenny Thompson,
who has also been tested as part of
international competition, said
she didn't think the tests were
degrading "because I know it's
helping to keep the sport clean."
But she objected to testing for
"street drugs" such as marijuana.
"Testing for performance-enhanc

ing (drugs) should be the point of
testing. Marijuana is not going to
enhance my performance in any
way, so that . . . would be an inva
sion of privacy."
Junior Justin Armour, who
has played both football and bas
ketball for Stanford, said he
thought testing for all drugs was
justified. "Athletes are role mod
els," he said, "and I think it's
important to send [fans] a drug
free message."
The lawsuit was filed in 1987 by
lieVant and lawyers hired by the
American Civil Liberties Union.
Soccer player Jennifer Hill, foot
ball player Barry McKeever and
the University later joined the law
suit so that rulings would apply to
all University athletes.
In 1988, Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge Conrad
Rushing ruled against the NCAA,
issuing a permanent injunction
that exempted Stanford athletes
from NCAA testing.
The decision was upheld by the
State Court of Appeals, but Fri
day's ruling overturned that deci
sion without the possibility of
appeal.
