# Stanford loses NCAA drug-testing lawsuit
## Athletes must comply to retain eligibility 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
Knding a seven-year legal battle between
Stanford and the NCAA, the California
Supreme Court Friday ruled that the Uni
versity must allow its athletes to be tested
for drugs by the NCAA in order to maintain
NCAA eligibility.
In a 6-1 decision, the court found that the
right to privacy granted in the state consti
tution does not prevent the NCAA from con
ducting monitored collection of urine sam
ples, which are analyzed to determine
whether students have taken substances
ranging from performance-enhancing
steroids to marijuana to birth-control pills.
The decision closed the case, originally
filed in 1987 by a Stanford diver and later
joined by the University. Stanford had been
the only university to be exempted from
NCAA tests.
While it rejected the application of a right
to privacy in the Stanford case, the court's
ruling noted for the first time that the
state's right to privacy can be applied to pri
vate institutions. The implications of the de
cision are uncertain, but legal experts say it
may have a broad impact on drug testing
and other privacy-related issues in the
workplace.
Previous rulings had found that the
NCAA failed to demonstrate a "compelling
need" that wouldjustify the invasion of pri
vacy. The state's high court, however, ruled

that private institutions need not meet this
strict standard.
"I'm gratified that the court found that
the right to privacy applies to private insti
tutions," said Susan Harriman, who repre
sented the plaintiffs before the court.
Writing for the majority, Chief Justice
Malcom Lucas said, "We will not perpetuate
this kind of error by continuing to say 'com
pelling' when we mean merely 'legitimate'
or 'important.' . . . We should say what we
mean and mean what we say."
The court added that athletes have a "di
minished expectation of privacy," as Lucas
put it, because they submit themselves to
such things as physical examinations and
locker-room showers. Regular workers do
not have such diminished expectations, the
court decided.
Dissenting Justice Stanley Mosk said the
decision was a big step backward. "Today,
the majority take away from Stanford stu
dent athletes — and all other Californians
— the right of privacy guaranteed by" the
California Constitution," he wrote. "At the
same time, they grant the NCAA — and any
other intruding party — a right of publicity
based on nothing more than their own views
of good and bad policy."
