# Winds of Freedom gears up
## Group plans study of undergrad education 
### Romesh Ratnesar Editorial staff 
Two months after gaining national expo
sure with a symposium that condemned
Stanford for bowing to political correctness,
the conservative campus organization
Winds of Freedom is kicking into high gear,
planning an independent study of under
graduate education and an outreach cam
paign next month targeting 60,000 alumni.
Since its creation last fall, Winds of Free
dom has attracted approximately 1,400 stu
dent and alumni members. The group is run
jointly by The Stanford Review and the In
terscholastic Studies Institute, a non-profit
education group in Bryn Mawr, Pa., that
handles publicity and finance for conserva
tive groups at various college campuses.
According to Chris Long, vice president
for programs at the institute, the Stanford
group is currently the largest and "farthest
along" of all such groups, which exist at
Duke, Washington and Lee, Yale, Princeton
and Vassar.
Junior Adam Ross, one of the organiza
tion's directors, said the group will distribute
its first newsletter "in a couple of weeks."
The letter will be sent to about 60,000 alum

ni who graduated between 1940-1970.
In addition, the organization has already
put together a group to conduct a study of
undergraduate education, in parallel with
the University's Commission on Undergrad
uate Education.
Ross said the group consists of "alums,
students, faculty and Hoover fellows" and
will "examine all aspects of the curriculum . .
. to see what the University should over
haul."
"The alumni had shown interest in get
ting involved in some specific effort," Long
said, in explaining the impetus for the study.
Ross said that, similar to the University's
commission, the Winds of Freedom pane!
has split into seven sub-groups and expects
to issue a report in mid-March. He added
that though there are as yet no plans to meet
with the University's commission, the group
is "already studying their findings very
closely."
Winds of Freedom was attacked after the
November symposium by critics who
claimed the organization was focused on
rolling back recent multicultural reforms to
the University's curriculum.
