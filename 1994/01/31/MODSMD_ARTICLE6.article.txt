# 'Setting our innate intelligence in motion'
## New technique may help migraines 
### Nina Wasow 
After years of treating mi
graine headaches with conven
tional medicine, Stanford re
searchers are now studying a pos
sible treatment which aims to im
prove the efficiency of the body.
Known as the Raimondi tech
nique, the treatment involves no
intellectual analysis, physical
contact, machinery or speech. It is
simply a holistic treatment that
involves one person treating an
other by restoring communica
tion between the body's instruc
tions and the body's functions,
said study director Kenneth Epp
ley, a theoretical physicist at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator.
In Eppley's opinion, the body
contains a blueprint for how it can
function most efficiently. He said
the Raimondi technique works by
restoring the connection between

a person's body parts and that
blueprint, helping the body to
heal itself. This is done using elec
tromagnetic field signals.
"We have a great deal of intelli
gence in our bodies that can deal
with all sorts of health problems.
But normally, we don't have the
ability to access it Raimondi al
lows us to do this," Eppley said.
The study and technique are
based on the fact that the body
has different ways of sending in
formation and signals — through
DNA, biochemicals, enzymes and
nerve impulses, among others. In
addition, certain cells have been
discovered in the brain which
have a high concentration of mag
netite crystals that are responsive
to weak electromagnetic fields.
According to Eppley, these
fields are another method for
transferring information and sig
nals. "They are an essential pail
of the body's communication sys
tem." he said.
The experiment consists of fill
ing out a brief computerized ques
tionnaire concerning the subject's
current state of relaxation. Then,
the person sits in a chair for 25
minutes, relaxed. Since it is a dou
ble blind study, participants can
not know whether they are receiv
ing the Raimondi treatment or a
control. They wear a mask and lis
ten to a tape of ocean sounds for
this purpose, as well as to keep
them relaxed.
Another person, physically
trained and conditioned in the Rai
mondi technique, begins to practice
the technique, activating the field
signaling system between them
selves and the subject through sim
ple physical movements.
"Simple physical movements
done by the (Raimondi) practition
ers are like a switch to begin the
process and stop it," Eppley said.
"The movements themselves do
not create the effect of a treat
ment."
Eppley said the technique is
like a program installed in the
physiology of the practitioner,
which is accessed by going
through the proper protocol,
including the movements.
Practitioners have refined a
"conditioned reflex", said Eppley.
"It's like learning to talk— every
one has the potential, but it has to
be developed by training. It's a vol
untary action—the person isn't
necessarily conscious of the field
signals being transmitted," he said.
The study is being run in col
laboration with the Stanford Rai

inondi Technique Volunteers, a
non-official organization of facul
ty, staff and students. Other Rai
mondi volunteer groups are active
in various parts of the country,
particularly in Dallas and Seattle.
Participants are paid $25 for their
time. The study is being funded by
donations from the Raimondi Vol
unteers group.
Spanish Prof. Michael Pred
more is a member of the Raimondi
volunteer group. He said, "If you
prick your finger, your system
knows how to heal. Why can't we
fix more difficult and serious
health problems? Raimondi is just
a way of setting our innate intelli
gence in motion."
Predmore also mentioned the
unexplained remissions that are
sometimes entered by people suf
fering terminal illnesses, such as
cancer. He said they are not ran
dom, but actually cases of the body
taking over and triggering the
healing.
Predmore said he was suffer
ing from sharp burning sensa
tions in the soles of his feet, which
were affecting his ability to walk.
Doctors had been unable to help
him with the problem, so he
attended a weekend seminar and
became a Raimondi practitioner.
He now treats himself and his
wife with the Raimondi technique
for about 15 minutes every day.
One participant in the current
study said she was experiencing
extremely severe headaches
accompanied by nausea on a regu
lar basis. She was receiving medi
cal attention for her problem —
getting frequent shots of demerol,
a narcotic which dulled the pain
for up to two days. But, she said,
the pain was so severe that some
times she couldn't drive to the
doctor. She said she was even
fired from her job for missing

work because of her terrible
headaches.
So, she decided to get the treat
ment. The participant attended a
Raimondi meeting, and found that
the treatment "helped temporari
ly — for a few hours or so. It con
trolled the nausea and pain so that
I was able to get to a doctor."
However, the effects of the Rai
mondi treatment were not as long
lasting, nor did they offer as much
relief as the drugs she was taking.
"I was part of the study on Fri
day, but I actually developed a
headache during the experiment,
which wasn't supposed to happen,"
she said. The participant asked to
remain nameless because she has a
pending wrongful dismissal case
with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.
Eppley said the woman was a
member of the control group, and
was not receiving the Raimondi
technique when she got a
headache. He added that later
when she received the treatment
her headaches actually improved.
At least one Stanford doctor
questioned the Raimondi tech
nique. Headache and Neurology
Clinic physician Lawrence Honing
had never heard of the Raimondi
technique. He said he was familiar
with the matter of nerve cells that
respond to electromagnetic fields,
but when the Raimondi technique
was described to him he comment
ed, "It doesn't sound like anything
medical to me."
Eppley, however, said the Rai
mondi technique has uses beyond
headache cure. It has been found
through a 6-person pilot study and
additional reports that this treat
ment aids some people with back
and neck pain, insomnia, premen
strual syndrome, digestive prob
lems, anxiety and athletic perfor
mance, he claimed.

but when the Raimondi technique
was described to him he comment
ed, "It doesn't sound like anything
medical to me."
Eppley, however, said the Rai
mondi technique has uses beyond
headache cure. It has been found
through a 6-person pilot study and
additional reports that this treat
ment aids some people with back
and neck pain, insomnia, premen
strual syndrome, digestive prob
lems, anxiety and athletic perfor
mance, he claimed.
After years of treating mi
graine headaches with conven
tional medicine, Stanford re
searchers are now studying a pos
sible treatment which aims to im
prove the efficiency of the body.
Known as the Raimondi tech
nique, the treatment involves no
intellectual analysis, physical
contact, machinery or speech. It is
simply a holistic treatment that
involves one person treating an
other by restoring communica
tion between the body's instruc
tions and the body's functions,
said study director Kenneth Epp
ley, a theoretical physicist at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator.
In Eppley's opinion, the body
contains a blueprint for how it can
function most efficiently. He said
the Raimondi technique works by
restoring the connection between

a person's body parts and that
blueprint, helping the body to
heal itself. This is done using elec
tromagnetic field signals.
"We have a great deal of intelli
gence in our bodies that can deal
with all sorts of health problems.
But normally, we don't have the
ability to access it Raimondi al
lows us to do this," Eppley said.
The study and technique are
based on the fact that the body
has different ways of sending in
formation and signals — through
DNA, biochemicals, enzymes and
nerve impulses, among others. In
addition, certain cells have been
discovered in the brain which
have a high concentration of mag
netite crystals that are responsive
to weak electromagnetic fields.
According to Eppley, these
fields are another method for
transferring information and sig
nals. "They are an essential pail
of the body's communication sys
tem." he said.
The experiment consists of fill
ing out a brief computerized ques
tionnaire concerning the subject's
current state of relaxation. Then,
the person sits in a chair for 25
minutes, relaxed. Since it is a dou
ble blind study, participants can
not know whether they are receiv
ing the Raimondi treatment or a
control. They wear a mask and lis
ten to a tape of ocean sounds for
this purpose, as well as to keep
them relaxed.
Another person, physically
trained and conditioned in the Rai
mondi technique, begins to practice
the technique, activating the field
signaling system between them
selves and the subject through sim
ple physical movements.
"Simple physical movements
done by the (Raimondi) practition
ers are like a switch to begin the
process and stop it," Eppley said.
"The movements themselves do
not create the effect of a treat
ment."
Eppley said the technique is
like a program installed in the
physiology of the practitioner,
which is accessed by going
through the proper protocol,
including the movements.
Practitioners have refined a
"conditioned reflex", said Eppley.
"It's like learning to talk— every
one has the potential, but it has to
be developed by training. It's a vol
untary action—the person isn't
necessarily conscious of the field
signals being transmitted," he said.
The study is being run in col
laboration with the Stanford Rai

inondi Technique Volunteers, a
non-official organization of facul
ty, staff and students. Other Rai
mondi volunteer groups are active
in various parts of the country,
particularly in Dallas and Seattle.
Participants are paid $25 for their
time. The study is being funded by
donations from the Raimondi Vol
unteers group.
Spanish Prof. Michael Pred
more is a member of the Raimondi
volunteer group. He said, "If you
prick your finger, your system
knows how to heal. Why can't we
fix more difficult and serious
health problems? Raimondi is just
a way of setting our innate intelli
gence in motion."
Predmore also mentioned the
unexplained remissions that are
sometimes entered by people suf
fering terminal illnesses, such as
cancer. He said they are not ran
dom, but actually cases of the body
taking over and triggering the
healing.
Predmore said he was suffer
ing from sharp burning sensa
tions in the soles of his feet, which
were affecting his ability to walk.
Doctors had been unable to help
him with the problem, so he
attended a weekend seminar and
became a Raimondi practitioner.
He now treats himself and his
wife with the Raimondi technique
for about 15 minutes every day.
One participant in the current
study said she was experiencing
extremely severe headaches
accompanied by nausea on a regu
lar basis. She was receiving medi
cal attention for her problem —
getting frequent shots of demerol,
a narcotic which dulled the pain
for up to two days. But, she said,
the pain was so severe that some
times she couldn't drive to the
doctor. She said she was even
fired from her job for missing

work because of her terrible
headaches.
So, she decided to get the treat
ment. The participant attended a
Raimondi meeting, and found that
the treatment "helped temporari
ly — for a few hours or so. It con
trolled the nausea and pain so that
I was able to get to a doctor."
However, the effects of the Rai
mondi treatment were not as long
lasting, nor did they offer as much
relief as the drugs she was taking.
"I was part of the study on Fri
day, but I actually developed a
headache during the experiment,
which wasn't supposed to happen,"
she said. The participant asked to
remain nameless because she has a
pending wrongful dismissal case
with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.
Eppley said the woman was a
member of the control group, and
was not receiving the Raimondi
technique when she got a
headache. He added that later
when she received the treatment
her headaches actually improved.
At least one Stanford doctor
questioned the Raimondi tech
nique. Headache and Neurology
Clinic physician Lawrence Honing
had never heard of the Raimondi
technique. He said he was familiar
with the matter of nerve cells that
respond to electromagnetic fields,
but when the Raimondi technique
was described to him he comment
ed, "It doesn't sound like anything
medical to me."
