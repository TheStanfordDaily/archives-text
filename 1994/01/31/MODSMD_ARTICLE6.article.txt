# 'Setting our innate intelligence in motion'
## New technique may help migraines

After years of treating mi
graine headaches with conven
tional medicine, Stanford re
searchers are now studying a pos
sible treatment which aims to im
prove the efficiency of the body.
Known as the Raimondi tech
nique, the treatment involves no
intellectual analysis, physical
contact, machinery or speech. It is
simply a holistic treatment that
involves one person treating an
other by restoring communica
tion between the body's instruc
tions and the body's functions,
said study director Kenneth Epp
ley, a theoretical physicist at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator.
In Eppley's opinion, the body
contains a blueprint for how it can
function most efficiently. He said
the Raimondi technique works by
restoring the connection between

a person's body parts and that
blueprint, helping the body to
heal itself. This is done using elec
tromagnetic field signals.
"We have a great deal of intelli
gence in our bodies that can deal
with all sorts of health problems.
But normally, we don't have the
ability to access it Raimondi al
lows us to do this," Eppley said.
The study and technique are
based on the fact that the body
has different ways of sending in
formation and signals â€” through
DNA, biochemicals, enzymes and
nerve impulses, among others. In
addition, certain cells have been
discovered in the brain which
have a high concentration of mag
netite crystals that are responsive
to weak electromagnetic fields.
According to Eppley, these
fields are another method for
