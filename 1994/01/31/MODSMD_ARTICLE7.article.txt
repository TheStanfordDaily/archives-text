of the new show "Keep Ya' Head Up!".

I'm good at talking. She calls me
the next Oprah Winfrey," she said.

show as her senior project in

students to see what it's like to be

part of a radio station."

think are important in their com
munity for the show. Echols said
future topics will include teen preg
nancy and emergency services.
The first program, which aired
last Friday, focused on (he Center

would have gone home and done
some homework, but would have
just mostly hung out."
