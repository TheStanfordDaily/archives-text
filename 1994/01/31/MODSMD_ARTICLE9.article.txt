## ANC lets whites vote on homeland 
### 
KHUMA, South Africa (AP) â€” The
African National Congress offered yes
terday to let pro-apartheid whites vote
for their own homeland, but said a black
government would retain power to veto
the results.
ANC President Nelson Mandela
appealed to militant whites to accept the
offer and avert bloodshed.
But the right-wing Afrikaner Volks
front angrily rejected the proposal and
vowed to establish its own homeland by
force if necessary to avoid living under
black rule.
That militant stance could be fatal,
Mandela told an adoring crowd of several
thousand squeezed into a stadium in the
black township of Khuma yesterday.
"We know how to fight," he said,
referring to the ANC's 30-year guerrilla
war, suspended in August 1990 after the

white government introduced reforms to
end apartheid.
Under the ANC proposal, whites could
vote April 27 on whether to establish a
whites-only homeland. The ballot would
be separate from national elections April
27-29 for a new, multiracial government.
The ANC is expected to win those elec
tions.
Whatever the outcome of the home
land vote, the newly elected government
would have final say on the issue, a con
dition unacceptable to white extremists
who have threatened war.
"I want to appeal to the right wing not
to do anything that would drag our coun
try into a conflict that would kill many
innocent people, black and white," Man
dela said. "We are appealing to the right
wing not to talk about violence so easily.
We know what war means."

The black, Zulu-dominated Inkatha
Freedom Party and right-wing white
groups fear domination by the ANC,
which has overwhelming support among
South Africa's black majority. They have
demanded constitutional guarantees of
ethnic autonomy for their followers
before they agree to take part in the elec
tion. The ANC has refused, saying that
would mean a return to apartheid-style
homelands.
Inkatha, the ANC's main rival for
black support, stopped short of calling
an election boycott yesterday but said
the party would not participate unless
its demands for Zulu autonomy were
met.
The Afrikaner Volksfront also is
threatening to boycott the vote. It
installed its own government Saturday to
lead the fight for a white nation.
