# Group plans to evaluate Honor Code
## Council to survey students, profs about merits of code 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
After longer-than-expected delays, a review of the
Honor Code by the Student Conduct Legislative
Council will begin within the next few weeks to deter
mine the code's effectiveness.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds
announced in October that the Honor Code will un
dergo an examination this year, its first since 1976.
The code came under attack last year after several
well-publicized cheating incidents.
The council's initial goal will be to design a set of
surveys for students, faculty and possibly teaching
assistants to gather opinions on the advantages of
and problems with the Honor Code, according to Ju
dicial Affairs officer Sally Cole.
"Our hope is to conduct the survey and analyze the
results by the end of spring quarter as to whether the
Honor Code as a policy can continue to work," Cole
said.
Assoc. Psychology Prof. John Dupre, a council
member, said the group does not have any particular
agenda. "It's mostly just going to be an attempt to as
sess how effective both students and faculty feel [the
Honor Code] is, effective in producing a climate in
which academic honesty and integrity can be main
tained," he said.
Dupre said the review is something that is normal
ly conducted periodically and does not solely attribute
it to the cheating incidences last year.
As it stands, the Honor Code grants privileges
such as unproctored examinations in exchange for
students' signatures on pledges of honesty and acad
emic integrity.
Council member Steven Chaffee, a communication
professor, said many members of the SCLC, including
himself, have already begun preparing themselves by
reading up on honor codes and past studies at Stan
ford and other universities. "To some extent I am ap
proaching it as a research-action project," he said.
"As a student here and a professor here, I've al
ways liked Ithe Honor Code] when it works," he
added. "But it also places extra
burdens on people. It's also prob
ably a matter of constant reedu
cation of the students and the fac
ulty."
Cole added that one particular
area that needs to be examined is
the "reporting requirement."
"The problematic aspect of the
Honor Code," she said, "is the
part that requires the student to
report any cheating that they wit
ness."

Although the group had origi
nally been scheduled to meet at
the beginning of winter quarter,
difficulties with filling faculty
positions on the council led to
postponement. In addition, Cole
said the group plans to begin
meeting even though one faculty
position remains vacant.
Currently the committee is
made up of Cole, five professors,
four undergraduates and one
graduate student.
While Dupre said the group
hopes to conclude their delibera
tions this year, he admitted that
that time frame is doubtful given
the group's late start.
