Governors focus on crime
WASHINGTON (AP) — Governors gave their
blessing yesterday to the rush in Washington to
crack down on crime hut urged President Clinton
and Congress to balance tough treatment of con
victs with a healthy dose of prevention aimed at
troubled children.
The call for more early intervention in schools
and with single-parent families was delivered to
Clinton at a two-hour White House meeting with
the National Governors Association. The gather
ing wjts dominated by discussion of crime and
health aire reform.
"It is very important that we take both the
carrot and the stick, that we not only invest in
prisons but that we invest in children," said
Democratic Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont. "We
know that more prisons have to be built and we
need to put more people behind bars. But we also
know that is not going to solve the problem in the
long run."
Governors emerged from the meeting saying
they believed Clinton shared their goals, but were
more skeptical of Congress.
"They're responding to the polls," said Kansas
Gov. Joan Finney. "The governors are really try
ing to do what they believe is the right thing to
do, rather than just react in an attempt to be re
elected. "
Smoking, drug use up
WASHINGTON (AP) — Smoking and drug
use among American teen-agers are increasing
after a decade of decline, a study showed yester
day, and its author warned that "the stage is set
for a potential resurgence of cocaine and crack
use."
University of Michigan researchers said they
noticed a relaxing of attitudes about the dangers
of drugs among eighth-, 10th- and 12th-graders
in a yearly survey.
"These attitudes and beliefs, specifically the
dangers believed to be associated with the use of
these drugs . . . play a critical role in deterring
use," said Lloyd Johnston, who directed the
study. "When they begi'i to soften, as they did
last year, an increase in use can be expected."
He said the issue of drug use "fell ofT the radar
screen," during the previous decade and "we may
have been lulled into a false sense of security."
The study found a three or four percentage
point rise in the last year or two among students
who reported any use of marijuana in the previ
ous 12 months. In 1993, nine percent of eighth
graders smoked marijuana, 19 percent of 10th
graders and 26 percent of 12th-graders.
