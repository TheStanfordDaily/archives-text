# Federal Reserve to raise interest rates
## Higher rates will control inflation, chairman says 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Fed
eral Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan put the country on
notice yesterday that the central
bank would "at some point" begin
pushing interest rates higher in
order to keep inflationary pres
sures from getting out of control.
While the Fed chairman was
vague about the timing of such a
rate increase, he gave a strong
indication in congressional testi
mony that rate hikes could come
at any time.
He said the issue of when to
raise interest rates would be dis
cussed by the Fed's top policy
making committee, the Federal
Open Market Committee, when it
meets this Thursday and Friday.
While raising interest rates
has the effect of slowing borrow
ing and economic activity,
Greenspan sought to assure
members of the -Joint Economic
Committee that the Fed's actions
would not be an effort to end the

current recovery.
"Such an action would not be
taken in order to cut off or limit
the economic expansion, but
rather to sustain and enhance it,"
Greenspan said in his testimony.
Increasing interest rates are
something the central bank has
not done since the spring of 1989.
As the country slumped into a
recession and then endured a
painfully long and weak recovery
period, the central bank moved to
cut interest rates to their lowest
levels in three decades.
But Greenspan signaled yes
terday that this period was com
ing to an end.
He said short-term interest
rates are at "abnormally low" lev
els currently, and he said that the
central bank must avoid the mis
takes of the past when policy
makers waited too long to
respond to inflationary pressures.
Greenspan said that while
there were no current visible

signs of growing inflationary
pressure, policy-makers could not
afford to be complacent.
"By the time inflation pres
sures are evident, many imbal
ances that are costly to rectify
have already developed, and only
harsh monetary therapy can
restore the financial stability nec
essary to sustain growth," he said.
"This situation regrettably has
arisen too often in the past,"
Greenspan told the committee.
The Clinton administration,
which has made low interest rates
the centerpiece of its economic
program, has been insisting lately
that there was no need for the
central bank to tighten credit con
ditions because inflationary pres
sures were nonexistent.
However, many private
economists have been forecasting
that the Fed would soon move to
boost the short-term rates —
possibly as soon as the end of
February.
