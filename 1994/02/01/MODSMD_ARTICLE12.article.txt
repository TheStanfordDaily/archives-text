MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) - U.S.
Marines in a convoy carrying American
diplomats opened fire near a crowded
food distribution center yesterday, and
at least five Somalis were reported
killed and many were wounded.
A U.S. spokesman said the Marines
shot afler the convoy was fired on by at
least two Somali gunmen. Somali wit
nesses said no one shot at the Ameri
cans and speculated the Marines fired
because they believed several hundred
Somalis in the street outside the food
center were trying to block the convoy.
U.S. officials said the convoy of three
Humvees and two cars carrying two
American diplomats was on its way to
meet with representatives of clan leader
Mohamed Farrah Aidid's coalition.
The U.S. spokesman, Stevenson
Mcllvaine, said the 22 Marines in the
convoy reported they were fired on
around 11 a.m. by at least two Somali
gunmen, one from the bush mid anoth
er from outside a building. He said they

believed they hit two gunmen.
No American was injured but one
Humvee was struck by two bullets and
another by one shot, Mcllvaine said.
The commander of Bangladeshi
troops guarding a nearby traffic circle
said that there could have been snipers
but that his men did not see any. "The
first fire that attracted our attention was
American fire," said Maj. K.G. Haider.
Haider also said he felt the Marines
fired "indiscriminately toward the
crowd."
Mcllvaine disagreed with the wit
nesses' accounts on nearly all points. He
said the Marines know only to fire in
self-defense.
About 5,000 American servicemen
are still in Somalia as part of the U.N.
peacekeeping force, but the U.S. contin
gent is gradually withdrawing to meet
President Clinton's order to be gone by
March 31.
The U.S. mission began Dec. 9, 1992,
when a U.S.-led multinational militarv

force landed to protect relief supplies in
this Horn of Africa country where
350,000 people died the previous year
from famine and clan warfare. At least
32 Americans died in Somalia since the
humanitarian mission began.
Moments afler yesterday's shooting,
dozens of Somalis shouting "Ameri
cans, Americans! See what they did!"
picked up the bodies of wounded and
dead, put them on wheelbarrows and
rolled them away.
Somalis said at least five people died.
Mumi Greek, a Somali who said he
was walking near the food center,
blamed the incident on the Americans.
"The food distribution was late and
many people were waiting outside the
center in the street. U.S. soldiers
arrived in four Humvees and were lead
ing a bulletproof Chevrolet station
wagon," he said in an interview
moments after the shooting.
"Before they even got to the crowd
they opened fire with the .50-caliber

machine gun mounted on the first
Humvee. Then they opened fire with a
MK-19 grenade launcher. The first
shots were directly into the crowd and
many people were wounded. No shots
were fired at the U.S. troops," he said.
Mcllvaine described the incident as
the worst attack on a U.S. convoy since
July, when two U.S. convoys were hit.
"I wouldn't use the word ambush. I
don't know if it was an organized effort.
But it certainly was an attack. And it
certainly was alarming," he said.
He said the convoy was heading to a
meeting with representatives of Aidid's
coalition because they wanted to com
plain of increasing violence on that
road. There were coming to a stop at the
Ethiopia mediator's residence in the
area to talk to officers of Aidid's coali
tion when gunfire broke out, he said.
"This was disturbing because I
thought things were going well toward
peace in the last few weeks," Mcllvaine
said.
