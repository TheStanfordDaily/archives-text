### 
PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Tonya
Harding's ex-husband has accused
Harding of helping plan the attack on
Nancy Kerrigan, his lawyer said yester
day. The lawyer said he divulged the
accusation in hopes of getting Harding
knocked off the U.S. Olympic team.
"The truth is, she was in on it from
the beginning. That's what Jeff said. 1
believe that to be the truth. It will be
corroborated by other evidence," said
Ronald Hoevet, the lawyer for Hard
ing's former husband, Jeff Gillooly.
Harding said last week she became
aware of the plot only after the Jan. 6
assault. But Hoevet, whose allegations
were first reported in today's New York
Times, said that Harding was involved
in planning the attack since early
December, after she finished fourth at a
skating contest in Japan.
He said much of Gillooly's account
could be corroborated by phone logs and
bank records.
Hoevet said the U.S. Olympic Com
mittee "cannot wait for the criminal
justice system to run its course. That
will not happen before the Olympics.
She has at least violated the unspv>rts

manlike conduct code. They've got to
find a way to take action."
The Winter Olympics begin Feb. 12
in Lillehammer, Norway.
Gillooly, Harding's live-in ex-hus
band at the time of the assault, will
plead guilty today to racketeering, said
Judy Snyder, Hoevet's law partner.
Prosecutors said they would release
today portions of Harding's Jan. 18
interview with authorities in which she
implicated Gillooly.
The five-member panel appointed by
the U.S. Figure Skating Association to
consider whether Harding should
remain on the Olympic team meets for
the first time today in Colorado
Springs, Colo. According to Multnomah
County Deputy District Attorney Norm
Frink, the Harding investigation may
not be completed before the final
women's figure skating roster is set on
Feb 21.
Also yesterday, Nike's chief executive
officer Philip Knight announced that
the company will contribute $25,000 to
help Harding defend herself if the U.S.
Olympic Committee attempts to remove
her from the team before she is found

either guilty or innocent.
Gilloolv said in his confession that
Harding got Kerrigan's room number
at the hotel where the skaters were
staying during the national champi
onships in Detroit, The Portland Orego
nian reported.
The attack was to have occurred in
Kerrigan's room, where she would he
hit in the leg and bound with duct tape,
according to the report, but that part of
the plan fell through and Kerrigan was
hit instead after a workout at an arena.
A source told The Associated Press
that the Westin Hotel clerk who alleged
ly gave Harding the room number has
been brought to Portland, where a
grand jury is investigating the case.
Harding, who has not been charged,
has denied that she had anything to do
with planning the attack. She has said
she only found out that those around
her were involved when she returned to
Portland on Jan. 10.
As part of a plea bargain, Gillooly
reportedly will be sentenced to two
years in prison, fined $100,000 and will
face no other charges in connection
with the attack.
