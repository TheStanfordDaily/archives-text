Administration should
not restrict options for
Commencement speaker

SPIKE LEE. Paul Tsongas.
Marlin Fitzwater. These fig
ures have all graced the cam
pus in the past year. Indeed, Stan
ford attracts many accomplished
scholars, researchers and celebrities.
Yet this well seems to have dried
up recently when talk of Commence
ment rolled around. Graduation
from college is a major milestone,
and should be marked by notewor
thy speakers who can draw on their
life experiences as they send 1,600
graduating seniors into the world.
But in the last few years, the speak
ers — though widely respected —
have fallen short.
It's unfair to prejudge this year's
speaker, Yale Law Prof. Stephen
Carter, who University President
Gerhard Casper picked last week
from a list submitted to him by the
senior class presidents. Carter may
give a great speech, he may not. Still,
most seniors were a little bit disap
pointed when they heard his name
for the first time and asked,
"Stephen who?"
Stephen Carter is a Stanford
alumnus who is widely respected in
his field and has authored two books
on legal and cultural issues.
Other names on the list of 16 sug
gested speakers included Nelson
Mandela, Maya Angelou, David Let
terman and Scott Turow.
Yet many of these proposed speak
ers may have been ineligible because
of the constraints Casper has placed
on the choice of a graduation speak
er. Last week, he said he felt "some
what strongly" that the speaker
should have some sort of Stanford
connection. And while Stanford pro
duces many successful individuals,
the pool of speakers is still consider
ably smaller than it would be if the
"Stanford connection" was not a
deciding factor.

Casper also said he felt having an
academic speaker was important to
show parents that their children
attended a serious institution. But
Stanford does not need to use its
Commencement speaker selection to
prove its academic integrity. And is
an academic really the right one to
send many graduates away from
academics for the first time?
Perhaps a more inclusive deci
sion-making process could be used
in the the future to select a welcome
Commencment speaker.
Currently, the senior class presi
dents submit a list of suggestions to
Casper and then wait for the deci
sion to be handed down to them.
However, graduate students, who
also attend the ceremonies, should
also be included in the process. A
speaker should ultimately be chosen
through open consultation among
the senior class leaders, graduate
school representatives and Casper.
The University should keep this in
mind, as well as try to look outside
the academic sphere and outside
Stanford in its search for a speaker.
The choices of journalist Ted Koppel
in 1986, cartoonist Garry Trudeau in
1989 and founder of the Children's
Defense Fund Marian Wright Edel
man in 1990, all demonstrated a
good balance between academic and
"real world" experiences and showed
that a Stanford connection is not
always the most important thing.
Lastly, the choice of a Stanford
related speaker this year still sadly
neglects the fact that the University
will graduate its 100 th class this
June — an occasion that could have
been recognized in its aim to keep
the ceremonies Stanford-focused.
An effort should at least be made to
incorporate this distinction into the
graduation festivities.
In sum, after working four or
more years to earn a diploma at one
of the world's finest universities, the
graduating class should be rewarded
with a truly memorable commence
ment — one in which the graduation
speaker is chosen by many people on
the basis of several different criteria.
It's time to start thinking about
the 101st class.
