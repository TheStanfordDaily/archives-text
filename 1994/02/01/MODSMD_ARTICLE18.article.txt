## Homophobes and panelists 
### 
I COULDN'T BELIEVE the ques
tion: "Well, first of all, are you
straight?"
I had almost grown used to careless
assumptions since I cut a foot and a half
of my hair last year. But this woman
was an LGBCC panelist in my dorm,
and I never anticipated having to
explain myself to her, too.
My first reaction when the panelist
asked me the loaded $10,000 question
was a "fight or flight" response: "Yes!"
I said quickly, in an "of course" tone. I
immediately regretted it.
I flashed back to the Toad the Wet
Sprocket concert in Frost Amphitheater
last year. In the break between the
opening act (who can forget Marvin the
Mandolin Man?) and Toad's appear
ance, my friends and I were trying to
chill and have a good time. On stage
were two alternative types from a cam
pus band. One guy behind me kept an
obnoxious running commentary on
them that no one wanted to hear.
"Look at those fags! What butt
pirates!" (I could go on, but you get the
picture.)
This continued for a few minutes,
until I finally decided I had to do some
thing about it.
"Excuse me, you're being really
offensive. Please stop." I said.
"Hey, I was only kidding — can't you
take a joke?" the guy protested defen
sively.
"That's not a joke — it's called homo

phobia, and it's not funny."
I turned back around, shaking, and
thought that would be the end of it. But
I was wrong:
"Dyke," I heard from behind me.
"What did you say?" I was incredu
lous.
The guy lifted his hands as if to say,
"Hey, it wasn't me."
Summoning up my last ounce of
courage, I said, "There are worse things
in this world." And that was that.
Think about the stereotypes sur
rounding gays. Lesbians are women
with short hair; they wear Doc Martens
(along with three-fourths of this cam
pus); they don't dress well (what about
k.d. lang?).
Gay men are all effeminate (oh yeah,
take that Rock Hudson, for instance);
all gay people listen to the Smiths; all
gay men love Madonna; they all dress
well (which prompted one of my friends
to say he must be a lesbian trapped in a
man's body).
Some of these things could probably
be included as elements of gay culture.
However, as in any culture, there are
huge differences between their mem
bers — on appearance, politics, music,
you name it. I sat in Group Communi
cation last week and listened to the very
vocal disputes among the Chicano-Lati
no-Mexican-American group — all
based on what they prefer other people
to call them. No one would have dared
to make the blanket statements about

that group that I hear every day about
gays. You have to wonder where the dif
ference lies.
Fear. I'm certainly not immune to it.
I wish I had the strength to answer "I
don't know" when people ask me about
my sexual orientation, because I believe
that sexuality is a continuum, even a
messy one. I have several gay friends,
and have always considered myself
"queer positive." Okay, I admit it, I
tend to drop the issue when people
assume I'm gay. Hut the person making
assumptions is as much to blame as I
am.
So, Mr. Homophobe and Ms. Pan
elist, this one's for you. I realize I'm
probably offending you just as much as
you did me. So let it fly. Give me every
thing you've got. And while you're chal
lenging what I think, throw some of
that righteousness your own way. Actu
ally do some thinking about this stuff.
Next time there is a "be-in" at the
CoHo, make it over there and meet over
a mocha. Maybe in time you'll have bet
ter things to argue about — like whose
turn it is to buy.
