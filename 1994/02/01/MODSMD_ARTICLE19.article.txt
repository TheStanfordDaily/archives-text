## Cardinal Sixth Man Club wrongly segregates students 
### 
IN REGARDS to the Cardinal Sixth
Man Club, columnist Rob Ross
buries in the fourth to last para
graph of his Jan. 27 column the fact
that prime student seats are saved for
those students (and non-students) will
ing to fork over $10 as part of a market
ing gimmick for a commercial enterprise
conveniently located on the other side of
the El Camino. He dismisses this fact
with a single word — "bummer."
Here's another word — "segrega
tion." More specifically, segregation of
Stanford students based on economics.
Similarly situated Stanford students
are treated differently based on eco
nomics.
While $10 may not be much to pay
for most Stanford students, the larger
principle is that this policy of "pay-for
spirit" intentionally segregates the stu
dent body based on one's financial abili
ty to have seats held.

Starting from the premise that all
seats are free to students and are (or at
least were) available on a first-come,
first-serve basis, the $10 amounts to an
add-on tax imposed if one wants to sit
in center court seats. Thanks, but no
thanks, I'll sit at the back of the bus,
er, I mean gym.
The logical next step, of course, is to
pay for saved seats at football games.
Student seats at football games do not
include a segregated section, roped off
with the sanction and stamp of Univer
sity approval for those students willing
to pay a separate fee above and beyond
the cost of a student ticket to a football
game. Student tickets to football games
now cost the same for all Stanford stu
dents. There is no special seating sec
tion. Similarly situated Stanford stu
dents are treated similarly in this
regard. Students camp out or get in line
and then dash up the steps to secure

seats. The quickness of one's feet, not
the thickness of one's wallet, secures
the best seats at football games.
Ross, of course, does not remember
Paul Wiggin or a 1-10 football team at
Stanford in 1983, when spirit — and
attendance — at football games was
sorry. But the University did not sud
denly decide to buy student spirit by
selling off for an extra $10 the best stu
dent seats. Instead, the coach got fired,
the team improved and wound up in
the Gator Bowl three years later thanks
to John Paye, Brad Muster, Toi Cook
and company.
Ross states that "for the most part"
the increased spirit at Maples Pavilion
is due to the Cardinal Sixth Man Club.
This proposition, of course, ignores the
fact that this year's team is vastly
improved over last year's club. Hey,
this is an exciting team. The tandem of
Brevin Knight and Dion Cross gener-

ates a spark that was missing last year.
Ross contends, however, that even
when the Cardinal had Adam Keefe two
seasons ago, Maples was "still lacking
in that distinct flavor found in
Cameron Indoor Arena."
That's interesting. Does Duke Uni
versity also officially rope off a special
section of bleacher seats for its students
who are willing to pay an extra fee?
Does paying $10 create spirit at
Maples? Or does paying $10 isolate and
segregate seating otherwise available
for all Stanford University students?
Hey, let the people in the Cardinal
Sixth Man Club pay $10, get a T-shirt
and get some food. Just don't hold seats
for them that all other Stanford Uni
versity students have, or at least had,
an equal opportunity in which to sit.
