# N'Gai Croal: fly in the buttermilk
## Worse than food service: a rancid media meal 
### 
I hat s the trouble with everybody — you 're
all so bored. You've had the universe
explained to you and you 're bored with it.
So now you just want cheap thrills and
plenty of 'em and it doesn't matter how
tawdry or vacuous they are as long as it's
new — as long as it flashes and fucking
bleeps in 40 different colors.
—Johnny, in Mike Leigh's film "Naked"
JOHNNY MAY BE BRITISH, but his
words apply just as well to America's
ever-voracious media machine.
Inquiring minds hunger for the juicy
details of the day's succulent scandals.
Once-reputable news organizations now
gleefully serve up a full helping of tabloid
treats. But what about truth? Objectivity?
Comprehensive reporting?
Those ingredients aren't spicy enough,
so they've been dropped from the recipe
and we don't miss them one bit.
Troopergate, the Brothers Menendez
and L'Affaire Bobbitt all gave us a taste of
news favoring of slime over substance. But
the best example of media excess has been
its handling of the allegations that Michael

Jackson molested 13-year-old Jordan
Chandler, son of "Robin Hood: Men in
Tights" screenwriter and Beverly Hills
"dentist to the stars," Evan Chandler.
From the moment the story broke, the
press focused almost exclusively on Jack
son. In fact, you won't see the names of
Jackson's accusers in any major U.S. news
paper or magazine. Hut you can easily find
the most salacious "details" about Jackson
that were leaked from the Los Angeles Dis
trict attorney's office, the Chandlers'
lawyers and any other party that stood to
gain from Jackson's misfortune. You don't
need to pick up the Weekly World News or
watch "A Current Affair" to do it, either —
Newsweek, The New York Times or "ABC
World News Tonight" will suffice.
Now if Jackson's guilt was all that the
evidence showed, the press would be per
fectly justified in its actions. However, the
facts that have emerged from the case
point to a Chandler family that at best
placed no value — other than a dollar fig
ure — on the welfare of its son and at
worst, lied about the entire thing.
When the story first broke, it was

reported that Evan Chandler allegedly
offered to keep quiet about the molestation
in exchange for a $20 million movie deal.
Both Jackson's private detective, Anthony
Pellicano and Chandler claim they were
trying to entrap the other. But what kind
of person tries to entrap the man who
molested his son instead of going directly
to the police?
We don't know.
Jordan's mother, June Schwartz, who
divorced Chandler 11 years ago, was in the
midst of an acrimonious custody battle
when the allegations arose. A conversation
between Chandler and Schwartz's new
husband was taped and leaked to the
press, in which he said, "If I go through
with this I win big time. I will get every
thing I want. The mother is going to lose
the son and Michael's career will be over."
Is there a relationship between the cus
tody case and Chandler's charges against
Jackson
We don't know.
The Los Angeles District Attorney's
office has been investigating the allega
tions against Jackson since August. They

raided his home, interviewed scores of
current and former Jackson employees,
as well as other children that spent time
at his estate and even took pictures of his
naked body to corroborate Jordan's depo
sition. How is it that over six months
later, no criminal charges have been
filed?
We don't know.
Finally, Chandler and Jackson have
settled out of court for an undisclosed sum
of money — anywhere between 10 million
and 30 million dollars. If Chandler had
pursued the criminal charges against
Jackson, he could still have filed suit in
civil court. His former attorney, promi
nent children's rights lawyer Gloria Allred
said in September that "My client wants to
have his day in court. He wants the truth
to come out. He's ready." Soon after that,
Allred resigned with no explanation. Why?
And what kind of father is satisfied with
taking money — no matter how much —
from the man whom he believes molested
his son?
We don't know the answer to that,
either.

Crucifixion am't no fiction
—Public Enemy, "Welcome to the
Terrordome "
In the wake of the settlement, the real
story in the Jackson-Chandler case isn't
whether Jackson is guilty or innocent. The
story is a media that failed to ask the ques
tions of the Chandler side that could have
shed some light on the entire affair. A press
that used Jackson's name to push its prod
uct while throwing any concept of objectiv
ity or even-handedness to the winds.
Still, they couldn't have done this with
out our help. If we weren't so content to lap
up the paltry morsels of information they
served us, without ever asking whether
there was anything better on the menu,
the entire media restaurant would have
been forced to improve. But we were only
too happy to watch as another icon that we
built up was brought crashing down to
earth, snickering all the while.

I hat s the trouble with everybody — you 're
all so bored. You've had the universe
explained to you and you 're bored with it.
So now you just want cheap thrills and
plenty of 'em and it doesn't matter how
tawdry or vacuous they are as long as it's
new — as long as it flashes and fucking
bleeps in 40 different colors.
—Johnny, in Mike Leigh's film "Naked"
JOHNNY MAY BE BRITISH, but his
words apply just as well to America's
ever-voracious media machine.
Inquiring minds hunger for the juicy
details of the day's succulent scandals.
Once-reputable news organizations now
gleefully serve up a full helping of tabloid
treats. But what about truth? Objectivity?
Comprehensive reporting?
Those ingredients aren't spicy enough,
so they've been dropped from the recipe
and we don't miss them one bit.
Troopergate, the Brothers Menendez
and L'Affaire Bobbitt all gave us a taste of
news favoring of slime over substance. But
the best example of media excess has been
its handling of the allegations that Michael

Jackson molested 13-year-old Jordan
Chandler, son of "Robin Hood: Men in
Tights" screenwriter and Beverly Hills
"dentist to the stars," Evan Chandler.
From the moment the story broke, the
press focused almost exclusively on Jack
son. In fact, you won't see the names of
Jackson's accusers in any major U.S. news
paper or magazine. Hut you can easily find
the most salacious "details" about Jackson
that were leaked from the Los Angeles Dis
trict attorney's office, the Chandlers'
lawyers and any other party that stood to
gain from Jackson's misfortune. You don't
need to pick up the Weekly World News or
watch "A Current Affair" to do it, either —
Newsweek, The New York Times or "ABC
World News Tonight" will suffice.
Now if Jackson's guilt was all that the
evidence showed, the press would be per
fectly justified in its actions. However, the
facts that have emerged from the case
point to a Chandler family that at best
placed no value — other than a dollar fig
ure — on the welfare of its son and at
worst, lied about the entire thing.
When the story first broke, it was

reported that Evan Chandler allegedly
offered to keep quiet about the molestation
in exchange for a $20 million movie deal.
Both Jackson's private detective, Anthony
Pellicano and Chandler claim they were
trying to entrap the other. But what kind
of person tries to entrap the man who
molested his son instead of going directly
to the police?
We don't know.
Jordan's mother, June Schwartz, who
divorced Chandler 11 years ago, was in the
midst of an acrimonious custody battle
when the allegations arose. A conversation
between Chandler and Schwartz's new
husband was taped and leaked to the
press, in which he said, "If I go through
with this I win big time. I will get every
thing I want. The mother is going to lose
the son and Michael's career will be over."
Is there a relationship between the cus
tody case and Chandler's charges against
Jackson
We don't know.
The Los Angeles District Attorney's
office has been investigating the allega
tions against Jackson since August. They

raided his home, interviewed scores of
current and former Jackson employees,
as well as other children that spent time
at his estate and even took pictures of his
naked body to corroborate Jordan's depo
sition. How is it that over six months
later, no criminal charges have been
filed?
We don't know.
Finally, Chandler and Jackson have
settled out of court for an undisclosed sum
of money — anywhere between 10 million
and 30 million dollars. If Chandler had
pursued the criminal charges against
Jackson, he could still have filed suit in
civil court. His former attorney, promi
nent children's rights lawyer Gloria Allred
said in September that "My client wants to
have his day in court. He wants the truth
to come out. He's ready." Soon after that,
Allred resigned with no explanation. Why?
And what kind of father is satisfied with
taking money — no matter how much —
from the man whom he believes molested
his son?
We don't know the answer to that,
either.

Crucifixion am't no fiction
—Public Enemy, "Welcome to the
Terrordome "
In the wake of the settlement, the real
story in the Jackson-Chandler case isn't
whether Jackson is guilty or innocent. The
story is a media that failed to ask the ques
tions of the Chandler side that could have
shed some light on the entire affair. A press
that used Jackson's name to push its prod
uct while throwing any concept of objectiv
ity or even-handedness to the winds.
Still, they couldn't have done this with
out our help. If we weren't so content to lap
up the paltry morsels of information they
served us, without ever asking whether
there was anything better on the menu,
the entire media restaurant would have
been forced to improve. But we were only
too happy to watch as another icon that we
built up was brought crashing down to
earth, snickering all the while.
