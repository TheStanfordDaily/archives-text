## Lee gearing up for Olympics Assistant coach overcomes knee injury to compete again 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
Dave Lee's wrestling resume would
fill a book. A very thick, heavy book filled
with startling feats and virtually every
accomplishment a wrestler might dream

about. And numbers - lots of numbers.
When he was a senior in high school,
Lee went 50-0 in dual meet competition
with 46 pins. In fact, his entire high
school career record is 177-7; six of those
losses occurred as a freshman.
In his first two years at Stanford, he

captured Pacific 10 Conference cham
pionships, placing fifth at 167 pounds
at the NCAAs as a sophomore. Trans
ferring to Wisconsin for the next two
years, he won a national championship
as a senior.
And this is only the first chapter.
Clearly, numbers and dates only tell
the surface of the story to a man who
lives and breathes wrestling.
Lee, now in his fifth year as assistant
coach of the Cardinal wrestling team,
can rattle off enough wrestling achieve
ments to make anyone's jaw drop a mile.
What makes him a star, however, is the
attitude he's had ail along.
"The one quality you have to have is
desire," said Lee. "If you want it bad
enough, you am reach the highest of
goals."
Lee began his long reign of wrestling
victories as a four-year-old, when he and
his friends belonged to intense youth
wrestling programs that traveled
throughout the nation.
"I grew up as a wrestler," said Lee.
"(The programs] encompassed more
than just the sport. It was a lifestyle."
Once he was in high school, Lee was
wrestling year-round, participating in
freestyle club teams during the off-sea
son. The sport was fun and challenging,
and best of all, Lee discovered that he
was good at it.
Because he gave all of his time to the
sport, Lee's intense dedication paid off
time and time again — he was the first
three-time California state champion,
and took first-team Ail-American honors
as a senior. Since Lee, there have been
only four others to win the state champi
onship three times, and two of those
have come to Stanford (sophomore
Jimmy Aguirre and freshman Scott
Chapman).
Lee's decision to come to Stanford
was influenced by the presence of Dave
Schultz, a world champion and potential
Olympian, who was coaching at the time.
Following his sophomore year, Lee fol
lowed Schultz to Wisconsin when the
Cardinal wrestling program faced major
budget cuts.
"Wisconsin was a very intense experi
ence. Wrestling is very important in the
Big 10 [Conference]," Lee said.
In 1989, Lee returned to Stanford and
