# Batters face off against St. Mary's

### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
The Cardinal baseball team contin
ues its non-conference schedule today
with a game against St. Mary's College
at 2 p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
Stanford enters the week with a 1-2
record after dropping two of three
against fifth-ranked Cal State-Fuller
ton at Sunken Diamond last weekend.
The last game was a tough 8-7 loss in
which Stanford had rallied from 6-0 and
7-4 deficits to tie up the game, only to
fall in the 11th inning.
"[The third Fullerton gamel was a
tough loss," said sophomore Cale
Carter, the Cardinal center fielder. "We
were able to tie it up, but I thought we
should have won it since it was such a
great effort by Tom [Reimers, fresh
man |."
The No. 12-ranked Cardinal will
hope to rebound today against an
unranked St. Mary's team, which fin

ished the regular season 19-34 in 1993.
Last year, Stanford opened its season
by defeating the Gaels 14-2 at Sunken
Diamond and 9-5 at Guisto Field the
next day. In his career, Stanford coach
Mark Marquess is 24-6 against St.
Mary's, having lost only twice in 19
meetings since 1983.
The return of a veteran pitching staff
should make the Gaels much more com
petitive this season, and many expect
them to contend in the West Coast Con
ference.
St. Mary's will likely start senior left
hander Eric Mooney, who posted a 5-6
record a year ago with a stingy 3.54
ERA, while sophomore Dan Reed will be
the starting pitcher for the Cardinal. In
his last outing, the season opener
against Fullerton last Friday, Reed was
chased after only three innings.
"Reed wasn't really sharp with his
breaking ball," Marquess said. "He
tended to fall behind a lot of hitters, and
they were able to capitalize."

Reed will try to regain his 1993 form
today against a St. Mary's team which
scored an impressive 4.50 runs per
game last year. Offensively, they are led
by outfielder Demetrius Pittman, who
has batted .329 over the past two sea
sons.
"IPittman's) a great athlete," said
Marquess. "He gets on base a lot and
steals a lot of bases and makes a lot of
things happen."
Despite shortcomings in its pitching
staff, the young Stanford team showed
an aggressive style last weekend that
netted them numerous scoring opportu
nities against the tough Titan pitching
staff. The Cardinal will carry that same
aggressive style into today's game
against the Gaels.
"Playing aggressive is the way to
play," said Stanford right fielder Rod
Meyer, a senior. "That's the way that
(Coach Marquessl has always taught
us, and that's the way we've always
played."
