# Let's hope four is enough
## Deal with it, Buffalo

WASHINGTON, D.C. - To
those abuse-loving mon
grels in Orchard Park,
N.Y., who are already chanting to
the Bills "Make it five in '95": do
us all a favor and stop this charade
of atrocity.
Like a "Police Academy" sequel

that no one want
ed to see, the Buf
falo Bills made yet
another return to
the NFL's Cham
pionship game.
Four times they
have played, and
four times they
have lost, a pat
tern that was only

good enough for second best.
After the Bills defeated the
Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC
Championship game a week ago,
the team's supporters held signs
aloft that said "We're back. Deal
with it America." Unfortunately,
America has dealt with it — too
many times. Many a second half of
recent Super Bowls has been spent
in anticipation of the newest Nike
ad, or to see who will win the bet
ting pool. When the Bills are
involved, the game itself becomes
an afterthought.
This time, though, all of us

watched it again. As soon as the
matchup was set with the Dallas
Cowboys, every rational observer
of pro football could anticipate the
result. But because it was the
Super Bowl, we watched anyway.
We convinced ourselves that Buffa
lo could make it a good game. That

maybe, just
maybe, they
would finally
win the trophy.
And for
a half, the Bills
had us fooled.
Leading 13-6 at
the break, Buf
falo made us all

endure the
abysmal Wavy Lays Country
Music Outback Steakhouse Poulan
Weed Eater Alamo Halflime Rodeo
Roundup, so that we would see if
they could hold on for two more
quarters.
But during the intermission at
the Georgia Dome, the Cowboys
realized in good conscience that
they simply could not lose to these
perennial runners-up. At the same
time, the Super Bowl Curse again
appeared in the Bills' locker room.
In the second half, the Bills

came out and played like the
Bills we all know — and have all
come to dread.
The Cowboys scored unan
swered points, leaving the Bills
short again.
There would be no tale of the
little engine that could, or of
David slaying Goliath. The Bills'
train took another detour south,
with Goliath pushing it onto
that downward track.

The Bills have now ensured
their dubious place in history.
For the most part, it is still true
that nobody even remembers
who finished second. But in the
Bills' case, they have made it so
that we cannot forget their
place.
Please Buffalo, do not remind
us again next year in Super Bowl
XXVIV.

David Schwartz watched the
Super Bowl on the East Coast for
the first time in his life. But no
matter the time zone, the Bills
proved to be awful again.
