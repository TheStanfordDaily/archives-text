# Goodbye Lions, Anteaters
## Spikers notch two wins 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
The 'Eaters ate it last night, as Stanford
pummeled a UC-Irvine club to the tune of a
15-7, 15-11, 17-15 sweep.
On Saturday, the Cardinal (3-3, 2-0 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) toyed
with Marymount for a couple of
games before putting the match on ice with a
15-7, 14-16, 12-15, 15-1, 16-14 final score.
Against the Anteaters, however, it was all
Stanford. Sophomore opposite hitter Matt
Fuerbringer pounded 29 kills for a .575 hit
ting percentage, while sophomore Mike
Lambert complemented him with 19 kills
and 10 digs from the outside hitting position.
"Lambert and Fuerbringer are world
class athletes," said Irvine head coach Andy
Reed. "They are amazing, and I don't think
many people can stop them."
The unstoppable duo paced the Cardinal
during the pivotal third game, as Stanford
coughed up a early 4-1 lead and was forced
to claw its way back from an eventual 9-13
deficit for the win.
Spurred on by several Cardinal hitting
errors and a Stanford rotation error, the
Anteaters (1-4, 0-3) relied on the play of
junior middle blocker Scott Clarey to give
Stanford a serious scare.
But according to Irvine's top hitter
Leland Quinn, "(Stanford] just got tough at
the end and refused to lose. That's what
good teams are supposed to do, and they are
a very good team."
Fueled by freshman setter Stewart
Chong, the Cardinal fought back from 9-13
to tie the score at 14 with a Fuerbringer

stuff. But Irvine refused to lay down and
die, as they notched another point before
Fuerbringer and Lambert registered two
consecutive side-outs for the Cardinal.
Carrying that momentum into the final
moments of the match, Stanford knotted
the score at 15 and then pushed ahead to
16-15 on a huge save by senior Joe
Burghardt, which was converted to a point
via a Fuerbringer fastball over the net.
The Anteaters' fate was then sealed by a
Lambert stuff' on the final point of the
game, to give the Cardinal a tight 17-15
winning margin.
"We let it slip a little during that third
game because of hitting errors," said Cardi
nal head coach Ruben Nieves. "Our passing
is getting better, but still, four or five of
their points came on our passing errors."
Always looking to improve on the young
Cardinal squad, Nieves also jw)inted to sev
eral missed scoring opportunities during
the third game as an area Stanford has to
work on.
Beside that, the Cardinal played a solid
match hist night without its top player,
senior Canyon Ceman. The National Player
of the Year was resting in Cowell Student
Health Center while his teammates were
pounding the guts out of the Anteaters.
Ceman has been suffering from lymph
node and circulation problems in his left leg,
as an infection has caused his left leg to swell
to twice its normal size. This has been a
recurring problem for Ceman, as he suffered
a similar infection this summer while play
ing in the World University Games.

Outside hitter Mike Lambert puts away UC-lrvine with a powerful spike.
The setter will probably sit out
next weekend's matches against
San Diego State and UC-San
Diego, as Chong and sophomore
Matt Renshaw assume the setting
duties.
"Canyon is the center of our
team, but Stewart played great in
filling in for him," said senior mid
dle blocker Brian Garrett. "He
runs a different tempo game, but
we put it together and pulled

through."
The Cardinal did have Ceman
on Saturday though, as Stanford
handed LMU its second loss
against no wins this season.
Once again it was the
Fuerbringer story, as the two big
hitters combined for 61 kills, more
than half of Stanford's total
offense. The rest of the scoring was
evenly distributed between Garrett
and freshman Michael Hoefer,
with 16 kills apiece.
Overall, Stanford trampled the
Lions with an overwhelming .520
hitting percentage compared to a
weak .345 showing by LMU.
