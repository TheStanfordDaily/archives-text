# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
For Volume 205's inaugural Athletes of the
Week, we have chosen two members of the
Stanford athletic family for their perfor
mances last weekend against the USC Trojans
and UCLA Bruins. Matchups against the Uni
versity of Second Choice often bring out the
best in the Cardinal, and the Bruins always
give Stanford a run for the money. This

week's selection of men's basketball player
Dion Cross and women's swimmer Lea Love
less did not let the Stanford faithful down,
supplying a last-second near-comeback and
glimpses of things to come later this season.
Cross, a sophomore guard from Woodson,
Ark., fueled the Cardinal comeback against
UClj\ Thursday night with his long-range
bombs and helped pace Stanford in scoring
against USC on Saturday. Pouring in 33
points in the two games, Cross' offensive pres
ence forced defensive changes by UCIJ\ and
USC.
Against the Bruins, his three free throws
with 22 seconds left in the game trimmed the
Cardinal deficit to 67-65, setting up one of the
most dramatic endings in recent Maples histo
ry. Cross finished the game with 16 points on
5-of-10 shooting and 4-of-5 free throws.
In Saturday's 76-67 win over USC, Cross
poured in 17 points on 6-of-12 shooting and 4-
of-4 from the free throw line. Part of a bal
anced Stanford scoring combination, his out
side shot helped open up the inside for Andy
Poppink, who led the Cardinal with 18 points.

loveless, a senior from Crestwood, N.Y.,
qualified for the NCAA tournament in Indi
anapolis with her time in the 100-meter back
stroke against USC Saturday, helping the Car
dinal to a weekend sweep of the Trojans and
UCIA
"We were looking to swim hard and see how

we competed with them," Loveless snid. "It was
a hard weekend mentally."
Blowing away the competition in the 100
backstroke, she became one of three Cardinal
swimmers to qualify for nationals, along with
juniors Jenny Thompson and Becky Crowe.
She also won the 200 backstroke, helping Stan
ford post two quality wins over tough teams.
