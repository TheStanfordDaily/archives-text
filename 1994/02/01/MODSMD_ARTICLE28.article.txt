# Domination the name of the game
## Synchro in control 
### Kyle Graham Staff writer 
Other Cardinal sports teams
may talk about dominance, but they
can't hold a candle to Stanford's
synchronized swimming squad.
On Saturday, the Cardinal incin
erated its rivals at the Davis Invita
tional, building a veritable fire-line
around the awards table.
Not only did members of the
squad finish first and second in
every event, but they also took third
place in every competition in which
they competed.
In the singles event, sophomores
Julie Davies and Jen Graves
scorched their rivals from Sacra
mento State and UC-Davis, tying
for first. Freshman Eunice Woods
also placed highly in the singles
competition.
"Eunice really impressed the
judges with her routine," said team
member Kristna Evans.
Stanford's opponents could not

escape the Cardinal in doubles com
petition, either, as the Georgia Bau
man-Debbie. Downes and Evans-
Amy Markezich pairings took first
and second places, respectively.
After a similarly searing perfor
mance in the trio competition, the
team took first place in the team
category for their "jungle" routine.
The squad saw their blistering
performance as an opportunity to
try out new routines and garner
experience. "[Meets like this] defi
nitely give you a chance to get out
jitters from the first week ... it also
gives us a chance to get feedback
from judges about our routines,"
said assistant coach Karen Madsen.
Though burned beyond recogni
tion by Stanford's performance, the
Sacramento State squad finished a
distant second, with the Anteaters
of Davis placing third.
Over the next month, the Cardi
nal squad hopes to further refine
their routines in meets in Ohio,
Washington and Arizona.
