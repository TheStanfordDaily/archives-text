# Black Liberation Month kicks off today
## New events focus on variety of achievments in black community 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Ordinary people working to bring about ex
traordinary change are the focus of this year's
Black Liberation Month, "Celebrating Black
Minds: Innovators From Our Ancestors To Our
Children," which begins today.
Although this year's celebration includes sev
eral new events, its purpose remains the same —
to celebrate black achievement and increase
awareness about black issues.
"When people think of black achievement
they think of sports or entertainment figures,"
said junior April Bell, a coordinator for the
month's activities. "It's fine to celebrate that,
but we also need to celebrate the other achieve
ments.

"Our goal is to make people think about the
other arenas that we've been successful in," she
added.
New events this year include a fashion show
and "Hiding out," a one-woman stage produc
tion presented by an East Palo Alto theater
artist.
"Hiding Out" is a dramatic rendition of three
women's lives and their relationships with God.
It will be performed Feb. 9 in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium.
An Oriki theater production, which will be
presented Feb. 18 in Dinkelspiel, will feature a
fashion show chronicling the history of African
people from ancient times to the present.
"People complained that we have the same
thing every year. This year we decided to have
something different," Bell said. "We're trying to

have different types of programs that appeal to
different people."
Another change this year will be the absence
of renowned keynote speakers from outside the
Stanford community, such as Jesse Jackson Jr.
who spoke last year.
"This is the first year we've had Stanford peo
ple as keynote speakers, to my knowledge," Bell
said.
Keynote speakers this year include the Rev.
Floyd Thompkins Jr., the associate dean of
Memorial Church, and students A.J. Robinson
and Jamell Walker, who co-founded a mentor
ing program called Students Offering Alternate
Realities. The three will speak at 7 p.m. on Feb.
5 in Kresge Auditorium.
Organizers decided to have
speakers from the local communi
ty to highlight the accomplish
ments of "ordinary people," Bell
said.
"We wanted to have speak ordi

miry people working for extraordi
nary change," she said. "You don't
have to be some big star to make a
change. You can just be an ordinary
person with an idea and act on it."
Robinson said he decided to
speak because "as I'm graduating,
I want to somehow inspire the
younger students to pick up where
we left off."
"I want the freshmen and

sophomores to pick up the ball and
hopefully make a change because
there's a lot more that needs to be
done," he said.
Black Liberation Month "serves
to remind us of what needs to be
done," Robinson said. "Hopefully,
it will transform ideas into behav
ior."
Other events for the month
include a soul food dinner on Feb.

10, a Valentine's Day workshop
on Feb. 14, a gospel extravaganza
on Feb. 20, a career workshop on
Feb. 24 and Club Ujamaa on Feb.
26.
"I encourage people to partici
pate because there's so much they
can learn from other people . . . not
just from a textbook," Bell said.
"Or they can just come as a
study break," she added.
