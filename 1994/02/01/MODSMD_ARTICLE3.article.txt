Ordinary people working to bring about ex
traordinary change are the focus of this year's
Black Liberation Month, "Celebrating Black
Minds: Innovators From Our Ancestors To Our
Children," which begins today.
Although this year's celebration includes sev
eral new events, its purpose remains the same â€”
to celebrate black achievement and increase
awareness about black issues.
"When people think of black achievement
they think of sports or entertainment figures,"
said junior April Bell, a coordinator for the
month's activities. "It's fine to celebrate that,
but we also need to celebrate the other achieve
ments.

"Our goal is to make people think about the
other arenas that we've been successful in," she
added.
New events this year include a fashion show
and "Hiding out," a one-woman stage produc
tion presented by an East Palo Alto theater
artist.
"Hiding Out" is a dramatic rendition of three
women's lives and their relationships with God.
It will be performed Feb. 9 in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium.
An Oriki theater production, which will be
presented Feb. 18 in Dinkelspiel, will feature a
fashion show chronicling the history of African
people from ancient times to the present.
"People complained that we have the same
thing every year. This year we decided to have
something different," Bell said. "We're trying to

have different types of programs that appeal to
different people."
Another change this year will be the absence
of renowned keynote speakers from outside the
Stanford community, such as Jesse Jackson Jr.
who spoke last year.
"This is the first year we've had Stanford peo
ple as keynote speakers, to my knowledge," Bell
said.
Keynote speakers this year include the Rev.
Floyd Thompkins Jr., the associate dean of
Memorial Church, and students A.J. Robinson
and Jamell Walker, who co-founded a mentor
ing program called Students Offering Alternate
Realities. The three will speak at 7 p.m. on Feb.
5 in Kresge Auditorium.
