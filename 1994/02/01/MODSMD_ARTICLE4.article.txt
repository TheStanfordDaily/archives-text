area hardest hit by the recent Los Angeles earthquake.
Civil Engineering Prof. Haresh Shah said yesterday
that Stanford has a lot to learn from the disaster.
Presenting a talk on "The Northridge Earthquake"
before almost 200 people, Shah sought to deliver back
ground information, provide a view of the damage and
consider how failures in Southern California relate to
the rest of the state, nation and world.
"Everything we're seeing in Northridge has direct
ramifications for the Stanford area," he said. "With all
of the research that we do, and all of the good buildings
we build, earthquake risk is higher now than ever be
fore."
The majority of significant quakes in California, in
cluding the one that hit just two weeks ago, occur on
faults that scientists are not even aware of prior to the
time that they become active, he said. Because of the
constant risk, it is important to develop new goals and

methods for dealing with earth
quakes.
Noting that past goals cen
tered on minimizing structural
damage and loss of life, Shah
pointed out that developed coun
tries and communities within
them, such as Stanford, need to
assess whether "we will be able to
fulfill our mission" given a mod
erate to large quake.
For Stanford, this means

deciding what will enable the
community to continue doing
research and providing basic
instruction. For businesses, this
translates into designing for min
imum economic disruption,
rather than just aiming to mini
mize structural impact.
Shah's slide show — which
was compiled on an exhibition to
the quake area with Stanford pro
fessors and students — served to
emphasize both the strengths
and the weaknesses of current
engineering practices.
Photos of damaged parking
compounds and apartments

showed that such buildings were
especially vulnerable. Shah
repeatedly pointed out pictures of
contorted and collapsed struc
tures and of entire floors crushed
due to stresses created by
improper construction.
Single-story residences were
cited as victories in preventative
engineering, though Shah noted
that the contents of many
"looked like they had been put
through a huge cement mixer."
The dramatic pictures served
to underscore just how fortu
itously timed the Northridge
earthquake and others in the

recent past have been. Scenes
depicting fallen cement canopies
and grotesquely twisted buildings
made it clear that, had the quake
struck during peak hours of use,
fatalities could have been much
higher.
Damage and fatality projec
tions, Shah said, must be made
despite the fact that knowledge in
the field of seismology is stagger
ingly primitive. For example,
experts estimate that the quake,
which killed 61 people, could have
killed up to 2,000 had it occurred
during the business day instead
of at 4:30 a.m.
