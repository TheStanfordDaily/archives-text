# ASSU meeting to feature proposal on restructuring
## Provost will answer questions as well 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
The second draft of a bill which
would halve the size of the ASSU
Senate and allow student voters to
decide among four districting
plans will be discussed at tonight's
senate meeting.
In addition, Provost Condoleez
za Rice will respond to questions
from senators and students at the
7 p.m. meeting. Senators plan to
raise questions about graduate
housing and race relations, said
Senate Chair Greg Waldorf. "It'll
be worth seeing."
The senate restructuring bill,
proposed in its initial form two
weeks ago by undergraduate sena
tor Gabe Lucas, is scheduled to
come up for a vote next week.
And because it requires an
amendment to the ASSU Consti
tution, if the bill passes the senate,
it will require ratification by a two
thirds majority of students in a
special election this month.
The revised proposal under
consideration tonight would allow
students to select among under-

graduate district
ing proposals
during the regu
lar spring elec
tion. Under the
plan, senate elec
tions would then
be held each fall.
If the student

body passes theL
amendment, "the

senate will be instructed to puf
forward four plans and the voters
will decide" among them during
the spring general election, Lucas
said. "One of the plans is the cur
rent at-large system."
The second plan would man
date six geographical districts and
four based on class standing â€” the
manner prescribed under Lucas'
original proposal.
"The other two plans will be de
vised by the senate," Lucas said.
"I'm doing this in faith that the
senate will choose a wide variety of
plans."
Despite Lucas' assurances that
his new proposal will provide
