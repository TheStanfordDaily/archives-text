# ASSU meeting to feature proposal on restructuring
## Provost will answer questions as well 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
The second draft of a bill which
would halve the size of the ASSU
Senate and allow student voters to
decide among four districting
plans will be discussed at tonight's
senate meeting.
In addition, Provost Condoleez
za Rice will respond to questions
from senators and students at the
7 p.m. meeting. Senators plan to
raise questions about graduate
housing and race relations, said
Senate Chair Greg Waldorf. "It'll
be worth seeing."
The senate restructuring bill,
proposed in its initial form two
weeks ago by undergraduate sena
tor Gabe Lucas, is scheduled to
come up for a vote next week.
And because it requires an
amendment to the ASSU Consti
tution, if the bill passes the senate,
it will require ratification by a two
thirds majority of students in a
special election this month.
The revised proposal under
consideration tonight would allow
students to select among under-

graduate district
ing proposals
during the regu
lar spring elec
tion. Under the
plan, senate elec
tions would then
be held each fall.
If the student

body passes theL
amendment, "the

senate will be instructed to puf
forward four plans and the voters
will decide" among them during
the spring general election, Lucas
said. "One of the plans is the cur
rent at-large system."
The second plan would man
date six geographical districts and
four based on class standing — the
manner prescribed under Lucas'
original proposal.
"The other two plans will be de
vised by the senate," Lucas said.
"I'm doing this in faith that the
senate will choose a wide variety of
plans."
Despite Lucas' assurances that
his new proposal will provide


Waldorf
"flexibility," some senators
remain unconvinced that district
ing should be considered at all.
Graduate senator Sanford
Dickert argued that the proposal
will harm the ASSU. "Lucas'
reduction of the number of sena
tors essentially dilutes the effec
tiveness of each senator per stu
dent," he said.
"His use of a multiple-choice
ASSU and his lack of assertiveness
are indicative of the legislative
lethargy that he says he's trying to
solve," he said.
Graduate senator Nawwar Kas
rawi echoed objections /oiced ear
lier by graduate senator Neil
Crellin about Lucas' lack of com
munication with other senators
and students in formulating his
proposal.
"When I spoke to him, he
already had most of these ideas
already worked out," he said. "I
respect that some changes to the

constitution are needed, but I
think it would be more effective if
we had a more constructive discus
sion of what we're trying to do."
Kasrawi added that there was
little consultation with people
both inside and outside of student
government. "I haven't heard
from him since the last senate
meeting when I spoke against the
bill," he said. "I think it's been a
disorganized process."
And according to Dickert, some
groups of students will be less rep
resented in the revised senate.
"The reduction of the senate could
homogenize the viewpoint of the
senate — not allowing for an open
discourse of open views and opin
ions," he said.
If Lucas wishes to improve the
effectiveness of the ASSU, he
should seek the cause of the prob
lem rather than applying a legisla
tive band-aid to the symptoms."
In spite of such protests, Lucas
said he wants the issue to come
before the students. "This |newl
bill is very much modified in
response to the discussion with sen
ators last week," he said. "I took
very seriously what people said."
