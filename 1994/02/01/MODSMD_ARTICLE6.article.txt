# Pro Fros to radiate with 'Pure Energy'
## Surcharge will aid funding of activities 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
The woÂ»-'.ii of Stanford is going
to bf "Pure Energy" for prospec
tive freshmen in April. But energy
has its costs.
This year that cost comes in the
form of a $25 surcharge for high
school seniors attending Prospec
tive Freshman Week, which will
take place between April 18 and 25.
According to Asst. Director of
Admissions Elise Maar, the deci
sion to charge for the formerly-free
program was a result of the last
round of budget reductions. "We
decided that this year we would
charge a small fee of $25 which
would enable us to keep feedingthe
pro fros," she said, addingthat stu
dents will also get a Pro Fro Week
T-shirt for their money.
Maar said the charge will not
bar any prospective freshman
from attending Pro Fro Week be
cause a grant program currently
covers travel costs for needy stu
dents. This grant will be extended
to cover the charge.
In addition to funding changes,
Maar said the week will have an in

creased focus on the importance of
academics at the University. Se
nior Katie Geib, one of the week's
coordinators, said the theme,
"Pure Energy," reflects the
strength and importance of Stan
ford's studies.
"We're trying to bring in the
idea .. . that we both work hard
and play hard," she said.
"It's spring quarter so it's
sunny and there's all this stuff
going on. It's not hard to sell Stan
ford as a fun place, but in the past
some students have felt that it
wasn't really academic so they
went off to Harvard or Yale," Geib
added. "It's a matter of making
programming both academic and
fun."
"We kind of tossed around ideas
like 'Shades of Stanford,' but that
wasn't really zippy," said sopho
more Kathy Lipscomb, another co
ordinator. "I'm not really certain
why we came up with 'Pure Ener
gy' but it sounded cool."
Geib said many of last year's
programs will be repeated this
year. Additions will include acade
