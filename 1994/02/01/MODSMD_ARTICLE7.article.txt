Two Stanford employees surrendered to
Stanford F'olice last week after being impli
cated in an embezzlement scheme where one
suspect allegedly diverted departmental
funds for an East Coast vacation and other
personal expenses.
Martha Campbell, a secretary for the Stan
ford Integrated Manufacturing Association,
and Jeffrey Aldrich, an operations manager
at the Center for Design Research, turned
themselves in Thursday in connection with
the theft of $2,300. Both were arrested and
released on bail.
Campbell, who is in charge ofSIMA's travel
budget , allegedly billed SIMA for student trav
el and then spent the money herself. Campbell
used the funds for a week-long trip to upstate
New York and Montreal last October as well as
to pay her rent, according to Stanford Police
Sgt. John McMullen. Campbell will be charged
with grand theft at their arraignment within
the next few weeks, he said, adding that no spe
cific date has been set. According to McMullen,

she is on administrative leave.
Police started the investigation after a de
partmental audit revealed budget discrepan
cies. "I guess she just got carried away and
saw the opportunity," McMullen said.
Aldrich allegedly became involved in the
scheme when he paid money back to the de
partment. Portions of the missing money
were deposited into Aldrich's account at the
Stanford Federal Credit Union, according to
McMullen.
In an interview, Aldrich said the deposits
were made without his knowledge. Aldrich
shares a Redwood City home with Campbell
and said that it was normal practice for them
to deposit money into each other's accounts
to pay for rent and utilities He was out of
town at the time of t he alleged illegal deposit,
he said.
Aldrich denied accompanying Campbell on
her East Coast trip and helping her spend the
embezzled funds. He was on a business con
ference in Cincinnati during the trip and met
her on the East Coast, he said, but did not
travel with her or accompany her
on departure or arrival.
Aldrich will be charged for
be<ng an accessory to the crime
after the fact at his arraignment,
McMullen said.
Campbell allegedly obtained the
embezzled money in the form of

traveler's checks from the campus
American Express office,
McMullen said.
She then allegedly took an addi
tional $750 in traveler's checks
from American Express when she
was accidentally given too many
checks. When American Express
called her later, McMullen said,
Campbell denied she had the
checks.
However, the used checks were
returned to the office with Camp

bell's signature on them from loca
tions up and down the East Coast,
McMullen said. "That was the
icing on the cake," he said.
Campbell did not return phone
calls yesterday.
Campbell and Aldrich have
since paid back the money from
SIMA but have yet to return
American Express' $750,
McMullen said. Campbell and
Aldrich told police they want to
pay back that money as well.
