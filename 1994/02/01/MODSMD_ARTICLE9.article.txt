# No rain may mean no Lake Lag

Without heavy rains by spring quarter, Lake
Lagunita's chances of hosting windsurfers and
sailors this spring may be rather cloudy.
Light showers have not provided local lakes and
reservoirs with enough water to overcome the mild
drought Stanford is currently experiencing, accord
ing to University Water and Sewer Superintendent
Larry Andrews. Eelt Lake — a reservoir in the
foothills whose runoff helps fill Lake Lag each
spring — is currently below normal levels, he said.
"We need continuous rain. A little bit of rain once
in a while will not help us," Andrews said.
While Lake Lag has been filled for the past two
years, it was dry from 1988 to 1991 because of Cali
fornia's seven-year drought.
Blake Middleton, head of Stanford's wind surfing
and sailing program, said he is worried about the
low water supply. Also a member of the Lake Com
mission, Middleton helps shape activities that make
use of the lake.
As head of a self-funded program, he relies on
money received from sailing and wind surfing class-

es to finance boats, repairs and insurance policies. He
said he needs to raise $40,000 for the annual budget,
which will be near impossible if Lake Lag is not filled.
"We need money from recreational classes in
order to stay afloat," he said. Lack of water in the
lake has forced Middleton to hold courses off cam
pus in past years, causing students to lose interest
and reducing the popularity of his classes.
Middleton and Andrews said Lake Lag's fate
depends on winter quarter weather patterns. The El
Nino phenomenon — the warm oceans in South
America — determines the weather patterns
throughout the entire country. Besides influencing
this summer's Midwest flooding, El Nino should
bring heavy rainstorms to Stanford this year,
though they have yet to occur.
Even if the mild drought persists, Andrews said
Stanford's fountains will continue to flow. Although
the fountains have been flowing since last year, they
were empty the two previous years because of the
severe drought.
But Middleton has not given up hope. "A few
good storms could do the trick for us," he said. He
added that he's even placing faith in less scientific
approaches including "rain dances."
