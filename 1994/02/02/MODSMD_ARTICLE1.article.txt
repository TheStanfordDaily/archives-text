# Rice, senate discuss cuts
## CTL may receive more funds 
### Charles Katz Jim Luh Staff writers 
Provost Condoleezza Rice discussed the Universi
ty's impending budget cuts with the ASSU Senate
for the first time last night, reciting her familiar ac
count of the reasons behind the University's finan
cial shortfalls and answering questions from sena
tors.
The only new budget information revealed during
the meeting was that the Center for Teaching and
Learning may receive additional funding rather than
cuts. Rice added that the Career Planning and Place
ment Center and the Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter also will receive special consideration during the
budget process.
Opening her 90-minute discussion, Rice cited the
oft-repeated reasons for the University's budget
problems.
After describing the University's four large
sources of income — indirect cost compensation
from the federal government, endowment funds, un
restricted alumni gifts and tuition — Rice pointed
out that the University has been running on a deficit
for the past three years and therefore is inhibited
from taking steps forward in such areas as classroom
technology.
"I can't manufacture money," she said.
Rice said that because the cuts cannot be distrib
uted equally and each unit must be considered indi
vidually, she has asked all central administrative
units to submit proposals for cutting their budgets
by 5 to 10 percent each year for the next three years.
"This is not a game. This is not restructuring the
University for some other motive," she said. "Insti
tutions that don't respond to change die on the bat
tlefield."
Responding to a question about the future of tu
toring, Rice revealed that University President Ger
hard Casper has made a small allocation from the
president's discretionary fund to the CTL.
"The CTL has a very bright future," Rice said.
She said budget plans might include "investment,
not a cut," in the CTL and similar programs like the
UAC and the CPPC.
Undergraduate senator Mork Murdock asked
Rice why there is little student input in the Umver-
sity's budget policy and whether
changes might be made in the
future to accommodate more stu
dent input.
Rice replied that the changes
being made now do not constitute
a budget "crisis" and thus student
input was not essential at the
early planning stages.
"I don't think we can mobilize
the University every time the
budget comes up," she said. "It is
simply efficient to ask the people
who know the units best."
Murdock went on to question
»,he timing of the Provost's
Office's release of budget infor
mation, saying that if the ASSU
had received more information on
budget changes it could have had
more impact.
Rice responded that the budget
"has to be on my timetable"
which is in turn dictated by the
University timetable, but she

added that in the future "maybe
we could find ways . . . for earlier
input."
She also said that exact dollar
figures for budget cuts were not
as pertinent to decision-making
as information about how func
tions and services would be affect
ed.
Responding to a question
about why the administration
placed more emphasis on cutting
rather than improving
"mediocre" student services, Rice
reiterated her point that funds
are limited and that "tough choic
es" have to be made.
"Stanford doesn't have any
room for something that's
mediocre," she said. "My instincts
tell me that not everything in this
University is excellent. . . . We'd
better ask ourselves some hard
questions about units that
aren't."
In a non-budget question, Rice
was asked for her opinions on
Commencement speaker Stephen
Carter's views on affirmative
action. She said that affirmative

action "has for the most part been
a tremendous benefit ... to the
United States."
However, she said, "there are
down sides, particularly if you are
part of a targeted minority," as
minority employees might be
unsure whether they got their
jobs based on merit or on their
status as minorities.
In regular ASSU business,
SPOON Hunger Relief Network
requested and received unani
mously a reserve computer for
centralizing and storing their
accumulated computer data.
The ASSU Speakers Bureau
was granted by unanimous vote
the ability to approve speakers
whose honoraria are less than
$6,000. Before this bill, honoraria
of more than $2,500 had to be
authorized by the full senate,
slowing the efficiency of the
bureau, senators claimed.
The senate also approved the
quarterly appropriation of $5, 899
for the ASSU Publications Board.
The board received $30,000 in
requested funds from student

publications.
Meanwhile, the senate passed
$15,000 in funding for the Pro
gram Board, amounting to half of
the total requests but $6,000
more than the board is allotted
each quarter. The board
announced it will make up the dif
ference from its reserves.
In committee appointments,
sophomore Geoffrey Shaevitz was
approved to be part of the Tech
nology and Education subcom
mittee on the Commission on
Undergraduate Education. Geolo
gy and Environmental Sciences
graduate student Juliet Crider
and freshman Leticia Madrigal
were appointed to the Sexual
Harassment Policy Advisory
Panel.
After the meeting, Senate
Chair Greg Waldorf disclosed
that the ASSU will sponsor an
open forum with University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper on his
informal proposal of a three-year
bachelor's degree. The date and
place of the forum are to be
announced.
