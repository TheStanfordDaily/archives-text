Provost Condoleezza Rice discussed the Universi
ty's impending budget cuts with the ASSU Senate
for the first time last night, reciting her familiar ac

The only new budget information revealed during
the meeting was that the Center for Teaching and

by 5 to 10 percent each year for the next three years.

"The CTL has a very bright future," Rice said.
She said budget plans might include "investment,
