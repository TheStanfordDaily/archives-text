# Students tackle Res Ed, advising issues
## 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
In the midst of a labyrinth of ever-lengthen
ing committee titles and ethereal terminology,
members of the Student Advisory Group on
Undergraduate Education's steering committee
met with students last night in sssOkada House
to discuss issues related to the University's aca
demic environment.
The session was part of a series of dorm dis
cussions planned by the group to receive input
on undergraduate education.
The steering committee was joined by repre
sentatives from the Commission on Undergrad
uate Education's subcommittee on academic
environment, who encouraged the 20 students
gathered last night to informally discuss all the
things they love and loathe about advising and
residential education — the chosen topics for
this particular session.
In future sessions at other dormitories, the
committee will garner student input on other
undergraduate issues. They will report their
findings to the advisory group's administrative
committee, which will in turn report to the Com
mission on Undergraduate Education.
The advisory group was formed last fall in
the wake of student leaders' complaints that the
commission did not have adequate student rep

resentation. The group has since been conduct
ing a parallel examination of all aspects of the
undergraduate program.
Comments and questions such as, "I'm still
not sure what Res Ed is," and, "Where is the
UAC?" repeatedly arose in the discussion last
night, as students and advisory group members
attempted to work out the pros, cons and whats
of the topics at hand.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg, a member of the
commission, opened the discussion on the "vex
ing" subject of advising, saying the commission
had considered everything from trying to get
faculty more involved in the process to "ditch
ing" faculty, and hiring professional advisers.
He admitted that the latter option would be
costly and might lead to a more centralized
advising system — a prospect which many stu
dents did not find attractive.
Senior Jason Frazzano, a resident assistant
at Roble Hall, said that even the present system
seems too impersonal at times.
"You can't sit in a room with eight people you
never see and an adviser you eat dinner with
once a quarter, and discuss taking risks that will
determine the outcome of your life," Frazzano
said.
Weisberg also spoke of the problem of sopho
mores, who often have drifted away from their
freshman advisers but do not yet have an advis

er within their major.
"Sophomores have fallen into the gap," Weis
berg said.
After sophomore and commission subcom
mittee member Chide Sladden read the official
functions of Res Ed so that everyone could get a
firmer grip on exactly what it is, the discussion
moved on to the currently jeopardized system.
"Some administrators have been questioning
the value of Res Ed," said senior Eddie Garcia,
the advisory group's chair.
Most students felt the concept of residential
education, which includes the idea of dorm pro
grams and staff assembled with the goal of cre
ating a community atmosphere, was important
in some form.
However, some felt that the "agenda" of Res
Ed is often intrusive.
"You can't just shove programs down peo
ple's throats," senior Jim Chu said. "I think one
reason people join housed fraternities is that
they're sick of the Res Ed agenda "
But Derek Miyahara, Okada's resident fel
low, downplayed the significance of programs.
He said that RAs are the most important part of
residential education.
"It's really about the staff," Miyahara said. "I
could pick a staff that just takes aire of keys and
vacuum cleaners and stuff like that, and this
would be a very different place."
