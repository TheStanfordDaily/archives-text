# President may lift Vietnam embargo
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton's top advisers are recommending
that he lift the longstanding U.S. trade
embargo with Vietnam, and the presi
dent is likely to take that step, senior
administration officials said yesterday.
A "consensus" memo to lift the embar
go was prepared for the president several
days ago, representing the views of the
State and Defense departments as well as
Clinton's senior staff, said one official.
"An administration recommendation
to the president is pending at the White
House. There's been no final decision,"
the official said.
White House officials had been sched
uled to discuss the embargo at a meeting
yesterday, but the session was put off for
a few days, pending consideration of the
matter by the president, said another
administration official. Both officials
insisted on anonymity.
The consensus is the product of meet
ings going back to December, the second
official said.
Clinton advisers weighing in on the

issue were Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, Defense Secretary Les
Aspin and national security adviser
Anthony Lake.
Assistant Secretary of State Winston
Lord made a mid-December visit to Viet
nam, returning with a favorable report
on Hanoi's cooperation in determining
the fates of 2,200 U.S. servicemen from
the Vietnam War.
A majority of Clinton's advisers
believe that lifting the embargo would
improve chances for getting more cooper
ation from Hanoi in determining the fate
of Americans still unaccounted for in the
Vietnam war, said the administration
officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
There were varying views among Clin
ton's aides on the potential benefits to
the United States of lifting the embargo,
the officials said.
One of the officials said there had been
considerable progress on the POW-MIA
issue over the past year, and that improv
ing relations with Vietnam would help

that process.
Voting 62 to 38, the Senate approved a
non-binding amendment last week urg
ing Clinton to lift the embargo.
However, representatives of POW
MIA families are lobbying the White
House against such a move, arguing the
embargo should be maintained until
Vietnam has done all it can to help
resolve the cases of Americans still unac
counted for.
Washington imposed an embargo
against North Vietnam in 1964. It
extended the embargo to cover the whole
country after South Vietnam fell to Com
munist North Vietnam in 1975.
Clinton has said he will not lift sanc
tions until he is satisfied Hanoi has fully
cooperated in the accounting of Ameri
cans listed as missing from the Vietnam
War.
White House officials, congressional
delegations and military officers who
have visited Vietnam the last two months
say Hanoi is not holding anything back in
regard to MIAs.
