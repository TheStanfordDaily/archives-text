### 
WASHINGTON (AP> - President
Clinton selected Deval Patrick, who
rose from poverty to partner in a presti
gious Boston law firm, to be the
nation's chief civil rights enforcer yes
terday. Clinton asserted conservative
critics of Patrick "don't give a rip about
civil rights."
Patrick won immediate praise from
rights activists and from members of
the Congressional Black Caucus who
had been critical of Clinton's failure to
fill the Justice Department post during
more than a year in office.
Conservatives, however, had opened
fire on Patrick as a "stealth Guinier"
even before Clinton announced the
nomination at the White House.
They tried to link Patrick's views to
those of his one-time co-worker, Lam
Guinier, Clinton's first nominee to the
Justice Department post. Clinton with
drew her nomination last June after
conservative criticism of her legal writ
ings, some of which Clinton said sur
prised even him.
But in the Oval Office yesterday,

Clinton declared that both Patrick and
Guinier "have had distinguished
careers in trying to enforce the civil
rights laws of the country." And he
rebuked critics of Patrick.
"A lot of those people are going to be
exposed because they never believed in
the civil rights laws, they never believed
in equal opportunity, they never lifted a
finger to give anybody in the minority
race a chance in this country," he said.
"If they attack his record, it means just
exactly what we've all expected all
along: They don't give a rip about civil
rights."
Patrick, a native of Chicago's rough
south side, brought his wife and two
daughters to the ceremony. "I am hum
bled," he said, "because I know that I am
standing here on the shoulders of . . .
those courageous advocates of every type
and kind who had the guts to stand up in
some court somewhere and give the Con
stitution life. I pledge to be true to that
legacy."
Civil rights leaders, many upset over
Clinton's refusal to fight for Guinier,

took a favorable view
"Patrick has exceptional legal and
civil rights credentials," said Ralph
Neas, director of the Leadership Con
ference on Civil Rights, a coalition of
major groups. "I'm confident that a
strong bipartisan majority in the Sen
ate will confirm his nomination" as
assistant attorney general in charge of
the civil rights division.
Elaine Jones, director-counsel of the
NAACP Legal Defense and Educational
Fund, where Patrick and Guinier both
worked in the mid-1980s, said, "The
president has selected well. Deval
Patrick is an American success story.
. . . He is a very able lawyer who has a
healthy dose of commitment to poor
people and an overwhelming sense of
fairness."
As a partner in Hill & Barlow, for
merly home to Massachusetts gover
nors William Weld and Michael
Dukakis, Patrick represented without
charge black borrowers scammed into
taking high-interest loans for home
improvements.
