Rights report released
WASHINGTON (AP) - Massive
numbers of civilians were killed last
year in armed conflict from Europe to
Africa and the Middle East, the State
Department said yesterday in its annu
al human rights report.
The report also alleged government
abuse of power in dozens of countries,
with political prisoners in China per
haps numbering in the thousands.
The report, which covers events in
i993, found that slavery still exists in
some countries and that women, par
ticularly in South Asia, suffer abuses
on an appalling scale.
Hut of all the risks to individual
rights, it said, none posed a greater
threat than armed conflict.
"In Bosnia, Sudan, Burundi, Soma
lia, Angola, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Georgia
and elsewhere, armed conflict led to
massive numbers of civilian deaths,

refugee flows and human rights abus
es," according to the report.
Gillooly pleads guilty
PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Jeff
Gillooly pleaded guilty to racketeering
yesterday and struck a deal with prose
cutors to testify that his ex-wife, Tonya
Harding, approved the assault on Nancy
Kerrigan.
Under the deal, Gillooly will be
exempt from any other charges, includ
ing those that may grow out of a federal
investigation. He agreed to serve 24
months in prison and pay a $100,000
fine.
Gillooly's lawyer, Ron Hoevet, said
his client hoped Harding would also
admit her involvement in the plot.
"Denial is no longer plausible,"
Hoevet said. "The truth about this
bizarre crime has now been revealed."
Harding has denied the allegations.
