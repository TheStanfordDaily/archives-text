## Editorials NCAA: A good call 
### 
IN EVERY loss, there's a small
victory. Case in point: Friday's
conclusion of Stanford's seven
year legal battle with the NCAA.
Although the University lost the
lawsuit — which challenged the
legality of monitored drug testing
of college athletes — Cardinal ath
letes and fans came away as win
ners.
The California Supreme Court
ruled that monitored urine tests do
not violate the right to privacy
granted by the state's constitution.
Since a Cardinal diver filed the
suit with the University in 1987,
Stanford has been the only school
exempted from the NCAA tests.
Since then, however, the contest
ed NCAA testing methods — which
detected some over-the-counter
medicines in addition to illegal
drugs — have improved. These new
methods have effectively mitigated
the fear of false-positive results.
Now, Stanford athletes must

compete on a level playing field
with their opponents.
With multi-million dollar con
tracts and endorsements awaiting
many athletes upon leaving the
Farm, the pressure to get a compet
itive advantage by taking drugs is
widespread. The improved tests
should provide a fair incentive for
athletes to stay away from such
substances.
Although some athletes have
objected to monitored tests, the
court rightly stated that athletes
already give up some of their priva
cy rights by submitting themselves
to physical examinations. A moni
tored urine test does not represent
a significant loss of privacy
University officials have previ
ously said that they don't object to
the NCAA's revised policy; they
just wanted to see the case through
until the court's final decision.
That decision made, it is time for
Stanford to move on.
