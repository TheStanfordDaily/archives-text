From jan. 16 to jan. 28,
people passing by Old Union
may have noticed that the
door to the Asian American Activi
ties Center was boarded up and
draped with "Caution" tape.
The temporary closing, con
ceived by Asian-American commu
nity leaders on campus, was
intended to dramatize the possible
effects that budget cuts may have
on ethnic centers. To those stu
dents who frequent the activities
center, the impact of the shut
down was probably quite salient.
But to those who don't, the two
by-fours and yellow tape were
nothing more than another hyper
bolic stunt in a long and tired
series of melodramatic tactics
employed by yet another group
that feels threatened by possible
budget cuts.
In times like these, when the
University must make hard choic
es about what programs to spare

and which to sacrifice, groups
seeking support against budget
cuts should expend their efforts
broadening their support base bv
reaching out to the greater Stan
ford community — not inspiring
fear in their own members.
Many groups may lament hav
ing to "justify their existence" over
and over again. But every year,
thousands of new students arrive
on campus and thousands leave,
and as such, the time-consuming
process of education must contin
ue if organizations hope to rally
the broad-based support they must
receive in order to merit funding.
Perhaps the two-week closing
has served to bring the Asian com
munity together. If so, that's fine,
but one has to wonder what kind
of impact — if any — such a
provincial protest has on those
who don't use the center and
those making the financial deci
sions.
