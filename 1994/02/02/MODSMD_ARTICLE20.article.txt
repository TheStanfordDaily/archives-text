## Bitter, Big Ben and 90210 
### 
THIS ENGLAND sure is a funny
place. I'm not sure when —
between the time I stepped out of
the airport onto a curb painted with
"LOOK RIGHT" and the instant
moments ago when I finally found one
of those gargantuan plug adapters for
my computer — the reality started sink
ing in that I am 6,000 miles away, in a
very foreign country across the
Atlantic.
Sure, everyone here supposedly
speaks the same language. That's what
I have been told, at least. But when
french fries are called chips and chips
are called crisps, beer is bitter (not in
taste but in name), sidewalks are pave
ments, saying "pass the water" at din
ner is asking someone to urinate and
bangs are not hair but a plural form of
coital slang, it does often seem as if the
English speak a foreign language.
Even more mystifying are the decep
tive pronunciations of place names,
such as Leicester (LE-ster) Square,
Worcester (WOO-ster) and Magdalen
(MAUD-lin). These lingual twists are
fabled to have been developed precisely
to confound foreigners, so that the
British could identify who was genuine.
Not to mention that darn driving-on
the-wrong-side-of-the- street thing. One
can easily gauge the tourist density of
any area by the frequency of strategical
ly placed "LOOK RIGHT" and "LOOK
LEFT" signs on the pavement. I cringe
to think of how many poor Americans

had to be splattered by double-decker
buses before the sidewalks — I mean
pavements — were painted.
An intangible dread takes hold of me
every time I cross the street, looking
right, suspecting that a speeding vehicle
will blindside me from the left — an
instinct developed by twenty years of
crossing the street the American way. It
is that same ambiguous lack of trust in
the unfamiliar that leads us to perceive
the British as an alien culture defined
somewhere between the royal family
and Benny Hill.
But what do all the differences really
mean? That we poor Americans in Eng
land have to do our best to nurse our
quivering, uprooted egos, seeking out
McDonald's and Pizza Huts to mitigate
our homesickness?
Or perhaps the solution is to revel in
that brief surge of adrenaline you get
when you cross the street, looking right,
waiting for the double-decker bus to
mow you over on the left. There's some
thing challenging, eye-opening and
incredibly exciting about traveling,
existing in a different place — be it else
where in the United States, across an
ocean, or an ocean and a couple of conti
nents — beyond mere see-the-sights
and-go tourism.
While my perceptions of the British
were formed by such bizarre sources as
"Masterpiece Theatre" and "Monty
Python" movies, British perceptions of
us seem to originate from less serious

aspects of Americana. Imagine my sur
prise and horror when I met a group of
British students whose primary images
of Americas were derived from "Beverly
Hills, 90210" and "Baywatch." It's a
two-way educational process.
Sadly, it seems in England the differ
ences may he breaking down. KFC,
Domino's, Safeway, the Gap and even 7-
Eleven have made inroads into English
culture; the same can be said for most
major movies and many television
shows, ranging from"The Flintstones"
to "Blossom." I may have escaped from
the States, hut definitely not from many
aspects of American culture, in its good,
bad and indifferent forms.
But for now, I will gather my courage
to truly explore and experience Eng
land. 1 will learn to ask for the "female
toilet" and not the "women's bath
room"; 1 will forgo McDonald's for some
"Doner Kebab Vans" fare (affectionate
ly known as the "death vans"); and
finally — someday — I will resist the
temptation to check over my left shoul
der for that speeding double-decker bus.
