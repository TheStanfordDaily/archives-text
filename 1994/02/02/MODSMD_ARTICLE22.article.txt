## Test scores unfairly gauge minority student abilities 
### 
MY LETTER is in response to a
series of newspaper articles on
the minority admissions and
affirmative action policies at Stanford
University. What few people realize is
that affirmative action was created to
integrate qualified blacks and Latinos
into education and the labor force while
leaving in place the system of white
dominance. The real irony is that many
conservatives who now oppose affirma
tive action because it does not help the
truly disadvantaged welcomed the elimi
nation of the long range and expensive
programs designed that did help the
truly disadvantaged such as CETA,

OEO, LEAA, 010, etc.
Only the relatively cheap programs
— black capitalism and affirmative
action for qualified workers and stu
dents — remained because the primary
benefits go to elite whites. Powerful
white institutions were able to maintain
control by admitting the most vocal and
potentially dangerous elements, quali
fied blacks. This allowed such institu
tions to appear to be benevolent and
gratuitous while increasing their pool of
qualified applicants. At the same time,
they were able to reject those persons
most crippled by discrimination and
radical capitalism, blacks and Latinos

outside of the labor market and poor
whites.
Diversity is a valuable commodity in
any institution of higher learning. How
ever, the use of test scores as a basis for
merit serves to assist only one group
non-poor whites, and their continued
use is alone cause for suspicion. Test
scores tend to include more non-poor
white students who perform below their
test level in school and exclude more
black students, poor and non-poor, who
would perform above their test level in
school. That is, whites, rather than
blacks, are represented in numbers and
ratios greater than their skill and ability

would warrant.
Universities should openly state that
their admissions policies are designed to
not only be diverse but also to atone for
their former near total exclusion of
black and Latino students and the con
tinued non-meritorious preferences
given to white students in the nation as
a whole. Such principled confessions are
something that neither Stanford, nor
the Regents in the Bakke case, nor
other schools have apparently been will
ing to make.
