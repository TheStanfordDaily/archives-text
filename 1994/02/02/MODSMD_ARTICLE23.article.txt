# Athletics Department should reconsider high fees, student seating
## 
### 
The controversy over the Cardinal
Sixth Man Club only serves to confirm
a much more serious problem with this
University's Department of Athletics.
The department has clearly forgotten
that its purpose is to serve the stu
dents of Stanford University. Some
examples of its recent failures to do
this:
• The student football seats used to

be on the 50-yard line (for those of
you too young to remember). But the
department realized that they could
sell those seats for much more than
the price of a student ticket, so they
moved the seats to the 35. When an
uproar ensued, they found a "compro
mise," giving students the bottom few
rows at midfield — from which nobody
can see anyway — and then advertis
ing his fact to try to appease the stu
dent's well-justified anger.
• Class fees are unjustified. I have
taken a number of golf classes at
Stanford. The fee for these has risen
from just $10 three years ago to $35
this year. Why? One of the managers

at the driving range told me that the
increase was necessary because "the
golf class takes up space that cus
tomers would pay to use." Pardon me?
The driving range is a tax-free Univer
sity facility because it is a "teaching
facility."
• According to the time schedule,
the tournament golf class cost $75.
The fee was $90 when the first week of
class rolled around. Why so high?
Because the class takes up tee times
and they have to be able to justify it to
the members. Excuse me? Last I
checked the golf course was owned by
the University. The members are privi
leged to use it.

• There are fees for aerobics, fenc
ing and martial arts. Exactly how
much equipment do these sports con
sume in a quarter?
While I commend the athletic
department for being self-sufficient in
this time of budget cuts, this nickel
and-diming of students must stop. All
athletic programs should be free to
students. If you really need that $35
for my golf class, take it out of the
$8,000 check I wrote at the beginning
of the quarter. Or better yet, raise the
price of Jerry Rice's basketball ticket.
He can afford it. I can't.
