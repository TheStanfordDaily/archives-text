## Computers to 'think' with fuzzy logic chip 
### Christian Chabot 
Despite the success of digital computers
in recent years, scientists agree that the
underlying basis of nearly all computer
information, zeros and ones, just doesn't
get you very far in the real world.
Fuzzy logic, a technique at the forefront
of computer technology, could circumvent
this prodigious obstacle by making a com
puter "think" like an organism, allowing
computers to deal with the fact that most
statements are not black or white.
lon Opris, a researcher in Stanford's
Department of Electrical Engineering, has
developed several new implementations in
this field.
"If a problem doesn't have a well
defined model or if it has no model at all, it
may still be approached based on a hunch,"
Opris said. In fact, basing decisions on
"hunches" is the underlying basis of fuzzy
logic because many of the conditions which
a machine needs to operate on may not be
clearly defined — they are fuzzy.
Fuzzy logic attempts to make comput
ers more versatile by moving beyond the
traditional "set theory" of current comput
ers. In set theory, objects, numbers and
words do or do not belong to a given set. A
day is either windy or not windy; it's just
that simple.
In an attempt to mimic the logic of
organisms, fuzzy logic assigns numbers to
statements which are between zero and

one, allowing information to belong par
tially to a given set. A day at Stanford, for
example, might be 70 percent "windy" and
30 percent "not windy."
Through such designations, scientists
can describe a broader spectrum of actual
possibilities — the day just described
might be "just right" overall.
In the world of fuzzy logic, zero and one
still represent false and true, respectively,
but there is a whole range of numbers
between zero and one which designate the
degree of truth of a given statement.
Fuzzy logic is quickly being assimilated
into commercial products across the world,
and many leading companies are begin
ning to take it quite seriously. In Japan, for
instance, fuzzy logic has swept across the
commercial world.
Washing machines, air conditioners,
cars, humidifiers and other consumer
products boast the ability to make fine dis
tinctions between critical variables and
then integrate this information into their
performance.
Some washing machines, for example,
measure the dirtiness of the water as the
cycle progresses and adjust the length of
the cycle accordingly. In this way, fabrics
from which dirt is removed rather slowly
receive longer washing times.
Opris is currently working on imple
menting rules of fuzzy logic into a set of


Jeff Sorrentino - Daily
chips which he refers to as
"fuzzy logic controllers."
The actual rules of fuzzy
logic are being transformed into
silicon chips, for use in analog
applications.
His methods make some
fuzzy logic implementations
smaller, simpler and operable
under lower power.
According to Stanford's
Office of Technology Licensing
several companies have
expressed interest in Opris'
advances and may soon inte
grate them into their products.
