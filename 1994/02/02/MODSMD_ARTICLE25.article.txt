# Surveys evaluate environmental damage
## Nobel laureate describes system used to assess costs in oil-spill lawsuits 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Recent environmental disasters, such as
the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, have illus
trated the difficulty of assigning a dollar value
to a location that most people are unlikely ever
to actually see or use.
But according to Kenneth Arrow, a profes
sor emeritus in the Department of Economics,
a system called contingent valuation can be
employed to evaluate damage in such situa
tions as the Exxon spill — which fouled a
largely unknown region on the Alaska coast
line.
"When you come to assigning a value to the
pure existence of a resource, you cannot use
simple methods of valuation," said Arrow, a
1972 winner of the Nobel Prize in economics.
Under the contingent valuation system, in
order to assess the dollar value of the environ
ment harmed in an incident, a poll is conduct
ed to determine how much money an average
person would be willing to pay to avoid a
recurrence of such damage.
This result can then be multiplied by the
total number of households in the country —
about 100 million for the United States — to
determine the cost of the damage, Arrow said.
In the Exxon Valdez incident, such a poll
yielded an average price tag of $37 per house
hold, prompting the state of Alaska to sue
Exxon for $3.7 billion and to finally settle for
$1.25 billion.
In light of the legal issues involved in eval
uating environmental damage, the Depart
ment of Commerce appointed a committee,
with Arrow and MIT Prof. Robert Solow as
chairs, to investigate the use of contingent val
uation in settling lawsuits.

"The claim was being made that contingent
values were meaningless — a lot like 'pain and
suffering' in cases involving personal injury,"
Arrow said.
In order to clarify the results of valuation
polls, a number of studies were conducted by
psychology researchers.

'On the whole, people seem
to react positively to the idea
of environmental cleanup,
regardless of how much will
be secured.'

According to Arrow, the results often
showed that, for example, people would pay
the same amount of money to save one lake as
they would to save 50.
"This has been replicated quite a few
times," he said. "On the whole, people seem to
react positively to the idea of environmental
cleanup, regardless of how much will be
secured."
But those who conduct the actual surveys
used in lawsuits contested such findings, say
ing that because they spend an average of
$800,000 to conduct in-person polls as accu
rately as possible, they should be foolproof,
Arrow said.
Another argument brought against contin
gent valuation involves the question of prov
ing that the dollar amount determined by a
poll is a fair indication of what environmental

damage should actually cost.
"External checks of validity are difficult,"
Arrow said, pointing out that individuals have
no real stake in the area of the environment to
which they are assigning a dollar value.
However, to the method's defense, he said
that about 40 percent of those surveyed gen
erally say they would spend nothing to pre
vent future environmental damage.
"We can't reject contingent valuation as a
principle," Arrow said. "We can tell courts to
take it with a big grain of salt . . . but there is
some important information contained in
these polls."
The findings of Arrow's committee,
released early in 1993, suggested ways to
improve the process, which are now being
implemented by Congress.
"We urged that a great deal of emphasis be
placed on what is out there to replace the area
that was harmed," he said, referring to the
frequently small size of environmental dam
age when compared to the amount available.
In the Exxon Valdez example, Arrow said
that only one-tenth of the 1,000 miles of
shoreline at Prince William Sound were dam
aged.
The surveys "should take a variety of cir
cumstances and consider each as a part of a
whole," Arrow said. "People might question
whether they could pay $35 for every place
that could be potentially damaged."
Though the process is still under review,
Arrow emphasized that courts have already
used contingent valuation in making deci
sions.
"There are a lot of issues surrounding these
surveys," he said. "But they have shown
themselves to be a valid technique for evaluat
ing damages."
