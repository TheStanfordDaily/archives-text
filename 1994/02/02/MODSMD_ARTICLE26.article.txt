# Computer agents to speed information access
## Technique promises smarter programs The 						Agent Paradigm 
### Kevin Armstrong 
In the near future, computers
may possess their own mental
states and may have decision-mak
ing capabilities, giving them more
human characteristics than ever
before.
Programmed entities, known as
"agents," will make this possible by
carrying out tasks and functions
ranging from handling electronic
mail to searching databases and
traversing the envisioned "infor
mation superhighway."
For example, an e-mail agent
running from one of Stanford's
mainframe computers could make a
request over the network for infor
mation on the ancestry of the horse,
while another agent specializing in
database retrieval at the Museum of
Natural History in Washington,
D.C. could receive the request and
forward relevant information.
Additional agents at libraries,
other museums or even on person
al computers could receive the mes
sage and respond — all contribut
ing to a process which would cut
down on the man-hours spent sift
ing through large numbers of files
for pertinent information.
According to Yoav Shoam, an
associate professor of computer sci
ence at Stanford who is conducting
new research on the creation and
development of these agents, the
framework can be defined as "fix
ing the [mental statel of the
(agents) to consist of components
such as beliefs, capabilities and

decisions."
In other words, agents commu
nicate with each other using cer
tain action messages. They can
inform each other, request assis
tance and decline to act towards
other agents all without human
interference.
Under these guidelines, the
presence of a mental state within
the agent becomes a necessity.
Current research into agent-ori
ented programming revolves
around the definition of such a
mental state, which is generally
defined by the agent's beliefs, pre
vious decisions, commitments and
abilities.
Created in the late 1980s, agent
oriented programming stems from
earlier research into artificial intel
ligence and object-oriented pro
gramming, which revolves around
the use of program modules that
interact within the computational
system to perform a series of tasks.
Though not a direct offshoot of
such techniques, agent-oriented
programming can be viewed as a
specialized form of object orienta
tion, geared towards navigating the
"global information village" that
the international community is
building, Shoam explained.
Current research, from Stan
ford to Silicon Valley computer
firms, can be divided into two sepa
rate areas — the interpretation of
the abstract notions involved in
creating agents and the application
of agents to various tasks.
The research into abstraction

seeks to further answer the ques
tions of mental states and interac
tions between agents by defining
knowledge, commitment and
intention for an agent.
Application research focuses
more closely on programming
agents to accomplish tasks and ful
fill requirements.
In addition, the rules for inter
agent work must be coded, much as
the rules of the road are defined for
automobiles, to insure smooth but
not overly restricted operation.

Agents already in use, called
"knowbots," are used to search
networks for reference citations to
aid research efforts. Researchers
are also studying impacts on indus
try, where robots and clerk termi
nals are used as the physical imple
mentations of software agents.
These software agents, quickly
coming to the forefront of software
technology, are likely to rise in
importance as the fundamental
hurdles of agent interaction are
overcome.
