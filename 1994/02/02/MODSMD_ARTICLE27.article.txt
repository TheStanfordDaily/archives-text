## Smoking 'buzz' is a lack of oxygen

Q: Why do 1 get a buzz when
I smoke a cigarette?
— Up in Smoke
A: I am sure that this
week's kind contributor
realizes that certain types
of smoke are among my favorite
discussion topics.
Nonetheless, 1 will assume
that Mr. Smoke is referring to
tobacco cigarettes, which do
indeed produce a "buzz," or a
sensation of lightheadedness,
though not in as straightfor
ward a manner as, say, anoth
er type of cigarette might.
Given that this is Califor
nia, and Stanford to boot,
many members of the reader
ship will be healthy go-getters
with entirely virgin lungs.
Consequently, for those of who
you have never smoked (or for
those of you who took one
'cause all the other girls in the
sorority were doing it — and
after all you had had a few
beers, and who's going to tell
Daddy anyway? — but didn't
inhale), let me tell you that the
phenomenon to which this
week's question refers is
widespread and common.
Many cigarette smokers
experience a rush or buzz from
smoking the first cigarette of
the day or a cigarette of
unusually high strength. The
effect is qualitatively different
from an alcohol buzz and
leaves the smoker feeling as
though he or she just finished
hyperventilating into a plastic
bag or suddenly stood up from
a comfortable chair. 1 would
bet that it isn't the reason why
most smokers stay with the
habit, but what the hell do I
know?
One folk explanation for the
cigarette buzz is simple but
probably wrong. Because it
will provide me with an excel
lent segue into the correct
answer, I will describe it any
way.
Cigarette smoke comes
from a flame, right? And fires
require oxygen, right? So,
since a smoker is inhaling
through a flame, and the oxy
gen in each breath is being
depleted by that flame, then he
or she should be getting less
oxygen than when breathing
normally, right? And oxygen
deprivation leads to the feeling

of lightheadedness, right?
Right?
Well, no. Most smokers
don't take every inhalation
through the butt end of a
Camel, and the level of oxygen
depletion from a flame that
small is pretty low. But
although the explanation in
the above paragraph was
wrong, the last sentence was
right on the money: Oxygen
deprivation is the key to the
smoker's buzz. Nicotine makes
a contribution, but its effects
are surprisingly small.
The lit end of a cigarette
(i.e. the end most people don't
put in their mouth, at least not
on purpose) is not especially
well ventilated as fires go.
Consequently, a good deal of
the combustion going on in the
tip of a smoke is insufficiently
oxygenated, and the combus
tion reaction can't go quite to
completion.
Normally, combustion
involves the consumption of
oxygen and some combustible
substance (like wood, or tobac
co) and the production of
water and carbon dioxide.
When oxygen isn't present in
sufficiently high proportion,
however, the insidious carbon
monoxide (CO) is produced as
well.
Molecules of CO have the
nasty habit of binding tightly
to hemoglobin — the
protein/iron combination that
carries oxygen throughout
your body via the bloodstream.
Through some ridiculous
quirk of Mother Nature (e.g.
that she didn't expect any of
the kids to {*o around sucking
carbon monoxide into their
lungs), CO binds hemoglobin
more tightly than oxygen does.
Therefore, even a little CO
goes a long way toward lower
ing the oxygen levels in the
blood.
Here is where the oxygen
deprivation comes in. Smoking
a cigarette involves pulling
CO-rich air into the lungs,
where CO displaces oxygen
from hemoglobin and prevents
proper oxygenation of body tis
sues, including the brain.
The brain is a hog for oxy
gen, consuming the gas at a
rate out of proportion to its
size (and, in the case of some
people, to its utility). Conse
quently, it's one of the first
organs to suffer when blood
