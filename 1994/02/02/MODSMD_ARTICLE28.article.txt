## More than just a wacky sport 'The spirit of the game' lures Cussen to ultimate 
### Kerri Kanuka 
If Terry Cussen, co-captain of
the men's ultimate frisbee team,
hasn't wall-papered his room
this year with discs, it's because
his time outside of practice is
spent studying the big red play
book.
"You can never know every
thing," Cussen said, after con
fessing he had taken the Stan
ford bible of ultimate frisbee
plays home to read over winter
break. The book has been passed
on for more than 25 years, grow
ing larger with the words of ulti
mate wisdom contributed year
after year by the most experi
enced players.
"Everyone has their theories,
but it is often better to just play
the way you feel," said Cussen, a
senior.
While the team has tradition
ally been one victory short of
going to nationals, Cussen and
teammates are again approach
ing this season with that elusive
goal in mind. "I want to go this
year — I'm sick and tired of los
ing," he said.
Cussen, born and raised in
Bolten, Mass., began playing ulti
mate frisbee his freshman year.
Encouraged by a dorm mate to
join the team, Cussen became
addicted after one practice.
"The more I played, the more
I liked it,"he said.
Cussen is especially attracted
to the aspect of friendly competi
tion, referred to as "the spirit of
the game," which is essential.
Although the game is played
according to set rules, there are
no referees, so players must rely
on each other's honesty. Eor
example, if a player catches a disc
out of a designated area, it is
essentially up to that player to

call himself out of bounds.
"All players must abide by the
rules and practice good sports
manship," Cussen said. "They
must avoid name-calling, inten
tional fouling, and attempts to
injure other players. [The spirit
of the game) is so that everyone
plays fair."

'It's an intense, emo
tional, and physically
demanding sport
It is not a casual
game.'
— Terry Cussen

Though this creative philoso
phy can cause uncertainty at
times, as in a 'your-word
against-mine' conflict, Cussen
believes that the spirit assumes a
greater respect for the nature of
the game. Further, he thinks
that the crucial understanding
draws people into the sport,
encouraging individuals to
befriend teammates and oppo
nents.
"You play at your best, but at
the same time, you allow your
opponent to play at his best,"
Cussen said.
Known by his teammates by a
variety of nicknames including
"The Claw" and "Manimal,"
Cussen also enjoys the social
aspect of the sport. Between
practices and tournament week
ends, the team has had plenty of
time to get to know each other on
and off the field.
Ultimate has gained a reputa
tion all over the country as a
unique and somewhat wacky

sport. Stemming from the '60s, it
surfaced as a sub-culture of its
own as players often smoked pot
before games and wore their hair
in dreadlocks. Cussen described
the Stanford men's team as lean
ing toward the conservative end
of the ultimate spectrum.
"Most ultimate players are a
little quirky or a little weird,"
Cussen said. "They are athletic
and pretty good at a lot of things,
but are often not quite good
enough to play mainstream
[sports)."
Ultimate players will often
wear brightly colored skirts dur
ing a game to build confidence,
adopting an "I'm so cool, I'm so
good" attitude, according to
Cussen, who will occasionally
don his own "sweet skirt."
While some people think of
ultimate frisbee as a game of
catch played with a dog that can
jump, it is actually much more
complex. The object of the game
is to get the disc moving down
the field, passing it from player
to player, until it is caught in the
end zone for a point.
Cussen said he loves the
quickness and constant move
ment of ultimate. "When the disc
is moving — that's one of the
beautiful things of the sport," he
said.
If the disc is dropped at any
time, it is immediately turned
over to the other team. Since the
frisbee is typically moving all the
time, players need to be in excel
lent physical condition and must
outsmart the opponents to get
past them.
"It's an intense, emotional,
and physically demanding sport,"
Cussen said. "It is not a casual
game. The level of psyche is so
important in any victory, just as
in any sport. You can't just play

well, you must play to win."
Last summer, Cussen and co
captain Brian Cameros played at
the World Flying Disc Champi
onships in Madison, Wis., with a
professional team called Fuchsia
Shock out of Rochester, N Y. The
tournament gave Cussen an
opportunity to watch the best
players and top teams in action.
While pleased with his perfor
mance in this tournament,
Cussen is still not sure if he
wants to play professionally after
graduating from Stanford.
For now, Cussen has his

hands full as co-captain of the
Stanford squad. Without a coach,
the captains are not only respon
sible for planning playing strate
gies and organizing practices,
but they also handle the team
administration and make all its
executive decisions.
Cussen's many roles consume
a lot of time, yet he still manages
the tasks with ease. His team
mates consider him a strong
leader who allows the other play
ers to concentrate exclusively on
their games.
"Terry is definitely the first

person to encourage and chastise
people on the team," said junior
Jeremy Dobbie. "He lets you
know (how you can improve] in a
very positive, stoic and quiet
manner."
While Cussen takes his leader
ship position seriously both on
and off the field, it is a pure love
for the sport which draws Cussen
to the ultimate field. Every day
of disc dives and catches brings
Cussen satisfaction: "something
that went right, when everything
falls into play — that is so much
fun."

Leading the men's ultimate frisbee team as both a co-captain and a player with three years of experi
ence, junior Terry Cussen is hooked to the disk game out of pure love of the sport.
If Terry Cussen, co-captain of
the men's ultimate frisbee team,
hasn't wall-papered his room
this year with discs, it's because
his time outside of practice is
spent studying the big red play
book.
"You can never know every
thing," Cussen said, after con
fessing he had taken the Stan
ford bible of ultimate frisbee
plays home to read over winter
break. The book has been passed
on for more than 25 years, grow
ing larger with the words of ulti
mate wisdom contributed year
after year by the most experi
enced players.
"Everyone has their theories,
but it is often better to just play
the way you feel," said Cussen, a
senior.
While the team has tradition
ally been one victory short of
going to nationals, Cussen and
teammates are again approach
ing this season with that elusive
goal in mind. "I want to go this
year — I'm sick and tired of los
ing," he said.
Cussen, born and raised in
Bolten, Mass., began playing ulti
mate frisbee his freshman year.
Encouraged by a dorm mate to
join the team, Cussen became
addicted after one practice.
"The more I played, the more
I liked it,"he said.
Cussen is especially attracted
to the aspect of friendly competi
tion, referred to as "the spirit of
the game," which is essential.
Although the game is played
according to set rules, there are
no referees, so players must rely
on each other's honesty. Eor
example, if a player catches a disc
out of a designated area, it is
essentially up to that player to

call himself out of bounds.
"All players must abide by the
rules and practice good sports
manship," Cussen said. "They
must avoid name-calling, inten
tional fouling, and attempts to
injure other players. [The spirit
of the game) is so that everyone
plays fair."

'It's an intense, emo
tional, and physically
demanding sport
It is not a casual
game.'
— Terry Cussen

Though this creative philoso
phy can cause uncertainty at
times, as in a 'your-word
against-mine' conflict, Cussen
believes that the spirit assumes a
greater respect for the nature of
the game. Further, he thinks
that the crucial understanding
draws people into the sport,
encouraging individuals to
befriend teammates and oppo
nents.
"You play at your best, but at
the same time, you allow your
opponent to play at his best,"
Cussen said.
Known by his teammates by a
variety of nicknames including
"The Claw" and "Manimal,"
Cussen also enjoys the social
aspect of the sport. Between
practices and tournament week
ends, the team has had plenty of
time to get to know each other on
and off the field.
Ultimate has gained a reputa
tion all over the country as a
unique and somewhat wacky

sport. Stemming from the '60s, it
surfaced as a sub-culture of its
own as players often smoked pot
before games and wore their hair
in dreadlocks. Cussen described
the Stanford men's team as lean
ing toward the conservative end
of the ultimate spectrum.
"Most ultimate players are a
little quirky or a little weird,"
Cussen said. "They are athletic
and pretty good at a lot of things,
but are often not quite good
enough to play mainstream
[sports)."
Ultimate players will often
wear brightly colored skirts dur
ing a game to build confidence,
adopting an "I'm so cool, I'm so
good" attitude, according to
Cussen, who will occasionally
don his own "sweet skirt."
While some people think of
ultimate frisbee as a game of
catch played with a dog that can
jump, it is actually much more
complex. The object of the game
is to get the disc moving down
the field, passing it from player
to player, until it is caught in the
end zone for a point.
Cussen said he loves the
quickness and constant move
ment of ultimate. "When the disc
is moving — that's one of the
beautiful things of the sport," he
said.
If the disc is dropped at any
time, it is immediately turned
over to the other team. Since the
frisbee is typically moving all the
time, players need to be in excel
lent physical condition and must
outsmart the opponents to get
past them.
"It's an intense, emotional,
and physically demanding sport,"
Cussen said. "It is not a casual
game. The level of psyche is so
important in any victory, just as
in any sport. You can't just play

well, you must play to win."
Last summer, Cussen and co
captain Brian Cameros played at
the World Flying Disc Champi
onships in Madison, Wis., with a
professional team called Fuchsia
Shock out of Rochester, N Y. The
tournament gave Cussen an
opportunity to watch the best
players and top teams in action.
While pleased with his perfor
mance in this tournament,
Cussen is still not sure if he
wants to play professionally after
graduating from Stanford.
For now, Cussen has his

hands full as co-captain of the
Stanford squad. Without a coach,
the captains are not only respon
sible for planning playing strate
gies and organizing practices,
but they also handle the team
administration and make all its
executive decisions.
Cussen's many roles consume
a lot of time, yet he still manages
the tasks with ease. His team
mates consider him a strong
leader who allows the other play
ers to concentrate exclusively on
their games.
"Terry is definitely the first

person to encourage and chastise
people on the team," said junior
Jeremy Dobbie. "He lets you
know (how you can improve] in a
very positive, stoic and quiet
manner."
