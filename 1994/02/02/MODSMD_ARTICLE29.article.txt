# Ex-Cardinal O'Brien topples Connors
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
SAN JOSE — Last night, for about
two hours, 6,500 people hated Alex
O'Brien. Hut that's what you get for beat
ing one of the best men's tennis players
ever to complain about a line call.
In his two-set win over tennis' bad
boy-turned-ambassador Jimmy Connors
in the first round of the San Jose Open,
O'Brien heard nary a word of encourage
ment from a crowd so close to his alma
mater.
Well, perhaps a few words.
"A lot of my friends from Stanford
came out," O'Brien said after his 6-4, 7-5
victory last night in the San Jose Arena.
"It was great to hear them, because I
knew not too many people would be
cheering for me."
It's a far cry from O'Brien's days on
the Farm, which spanned from 1988-'92.
During his stay, O'Brien was a four time
AU-American and won collegiate tennis'
Triple Crown (the single, doubles, and
team title) his senior season, the first per
son to do so in more than 10 years.
Not only has the cheering changed
O'Brien has found what was once his
strength in the collegiate ranks is now a
liability on the pro tour.
"Mentally Alex is one of the toughest
players I've ever had," said Stanford's
head tennis coach Dick Gould during
O'Brien's senior season. "I would hate to
play him. If you let up, he would be all
over you."
But now O'Brien feels that mental
toughness is an area of weakness.
"Mentally, {the pro tourl is really a
grind," O'Brien said. "The good players
know how to go week in and week out and
win matches. I'm not able to put it all
together every day yet.
"I don't play [one point at a time] very
well. I have a problem that when I get
down 30-Love in a game I'll just kind of
throw it in."
O'Brien's young career has been filled
with dips and valleys. After completing
an immensely successful senior year,
O'Brien became a professional and con
tinued his rise towards the top. He was

so6n ranked 82nd ih fHo world before the
rigors of professional tennis began to
affect his play.
"I struggled a little bit and dropped
down (about 60 places)," O'Brien said.
He is currently ranked 130 th, but last
night's win will change that. O'Brien now
advances to the second round, where he
will meet fifth-seeded Karsten Braasch of
Germany Thursday.
At Stanford, O'Brien made an rare
decision for a top men's tennis player at
that time — he elected to stay in school
and get his diploma. Other talented team
mates opted to join the pro rank afler
only a few years on the Farm, including
Jared Palmer and Jonathan Stark, both
of whom are ranked ahead of O'Brien.
But O'Brien would never change the
decision to remain in college and get his
degree.
"1 had a great time in college," he said.
"I wouldn't trade it for being top-10 in
the world right now. I am very happy that
I graduated."
Connors is ranked only 368 th, the sec
ond-lowest ranked entrant in the 32-man
draw at the San Jose Open, but in a
match against the most famous left-han
der in tennis, one does not only face Con
nors himself. O'Brien was also up against
the Connors magic, the Connors mys
tique and the Connors theatrics. A for
mer UCLA Bruin, Connors captured the
NCAA singles title in 1972, his freshman
year, and has gone on to secure 109
career titles, including one Austrian
Open, two Wimbledons and five U.S.
Opens.
O'Brien was predictably in awe of a
man who won his fust U.S. Open while
O'Brien was still a toddler.
"I was playing a living legend,"
O'Brien said. "It's a great honor to be on
the same court as he is."
Before the match O'Brien went to an
old mentor for tips on facing this "living
legend."
"I talked to Coach Gould before the
match and he said he hadn't seen [Con
nors | play in twenty years, so he really
didn't have much advice," O'Brien said.
While at age 43 his physical abilities
have waned, yet Connors is still the same

crowd-pleasing, six-gun waving character
who made that improbable run to the
semi-finals at the U.S. Open in 1991.
Against the former Cardinal he twirled
his racket, made faces at the chair umpire
and gave the spectators a rollicking good
time. In spite of these antics, O'Brien
thought Connors went a little easy on
him.
"Jimmy was great; he was really nice
to me today," O'Brien said. "He didn't
stall or do some of the stuff he's done to
other people. I guess he treated me with a
little respect. That surprised me a little."
Connors, in a press conference filled
with ruminations about professional
golf, Jennifer Capriati and the over-35
tour, found time to pay homage to the
Stanford alum who handled him in
straight sets.
"He hit the ball well," Connors said.
"He got to a lot of balls and ended up
serving quite well. He played very well."
