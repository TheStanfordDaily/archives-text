# 'Strategic plan' for ethnic centers, creative restructuring in works
## Re-engineering process slow, provost says 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
The effort to trim about $20 million from
the University budget is moving a little slower
than expected, but most administrative units
have submitted their blueprints for budget
cuts at this point, Provost Condoleezza Rice
announced.
By Jan. 15, all administrative units were
scheduled to have given Rice proposals on how
they would reduce their budgets between 15
percent and 30 percent over three years.
Rice said that most of those proposals have

now been submitted, although some have been
sent back to administrators so they can include
more detail or to try to plan more creatively.
Such ongoing changes to the proposals
demonstrate the less definite, more creative as
pect of a process where administrators are
being asked not just to cut budgets, but to re
think and restructure the way they work, Rice
said.
"Because we're going to be trying to empha
size these restructuring and re-engineering is
sues, you can't necessarily expect people to de
velop a plan within a particular time frame,"
said University Budget Director Tim Warner

In an interview Monday, Rice also released
an updated calendar for the cuts, announced
several "town hall" meetings to discuss the
cuts, and gave a few discreet glimpses of what
certain areas may look like in a few years.
Rice stressed the differences between these
current cuts and the past two budget-cutting
efforts the University has made — the $22 mil
lion "repositioning" in 1990 and $43 million re
duction announced in 1992.
Both of those efforts were more traditional
cuts, whore units were given fairly certain bud-
get targets to reach and strict
timetables. This time, however,
Rice stressed the re-engineering
aspect of the cuts — looking at
changing the structure and meth
ods of activities to save money
rather than just cutting them.
More change, more slowly
Of the $20 million the Universi
ty is now looking to cut, Rice said
only about the first $5 million to
$6 million is likely to come in the
form of more traditional cuts, and
the remaining $14 million to $15
million dollars in savings will have
to be realized through changing,
not cutting.
"In year one I think we will iden
tify further reductions in budget,
and then in years two and three
we're going to be very dependent on
efforts of restructuring and re-engi
neering. I think we knew that going
in, but it's even clearer now than it
was," Rice said.
That means the process is slow
er than in the past and deadlines
are somewhat looser. Rice said she

and the different academic units
will interact often and individually,
so that she may send a budget plan
back to a unit for changes, or they
may send new proposals to the
provost.
"It's going to be a longer process
of development of plans and of
implementation," Rice said.
"Because we're going to be try
ing to emphasize these restructur
ing and re-engineering issues, you
can't necessarily expect people to
develop a plan within a particular
time frame," Warner said. "So
what we're focusing on now is to
try to get as much information and
planning around next year's bud
get as we can, because that's really
the main thing we have to take to
the [Board of] Trustees in June.
"Some of these other efforts are
going to extend well beyond the
timetable for the June budget; it's
going to go into the summer, into
next year," he said. "This is a pro
cess that's not going to sort of start
and finish on a date that everybody
can predict with targets that
everybody can predict. I think the
way to think of it is more as a con
tinuing management process . . .
that has a three-year window to it
right now but that ... is probably

going to extend beyond that as
conditions change, as we learn
more and as various other changes
take place."
Cuts through attrition
To conduct this repositioning,
Rice said, Stanford employees must
"think about different ways to do
the work — we're going to have to
think about contracting out" some
services, and changing the manage
ment and structure of others.
Rice admitted that staff cuts are
likely in this budget change, but
predicted that there would be fewer
cuts now than during the 1990
repositioning effort. Warner said a
couple of hundred positions were
scheduled to be cut in 1990 — a
number which dropped to 40 or 50
layoffs after some employees were
moved or were cut through attri
tion.
If and when employees are cut,
Rice said Stanford hopes to reduce
most positions through attrition —
about 15 percent of employees leave
each year, she said. She said that
seniority would be a factor in decid
ing what positions to cut, but added
that the most important criterion
will be how important a given pro
gram is to the University. Rice said

Stanford is committed to having a
retraining program for laid-off
employees.
Also Monday, Rice released a
new schedule for the budget
changes. Academic schools are slat
ed to submit their budget plans on
March 1, and the University budget
will be developed from late March
through April. Although the budget
is usually presented to the Board of
Trustees in April, Rice said that
because this is a slower budget pro
cess, it will be presented in June
this year.
Rice also announced periods of
time whert town meetings on the
budget will be held this quarter.
Because she has only received the
first proposals of how units might
make cuts of 5 percent to 10 percent
a year over three years, Rice said she
had few specifics to offer. She did,
however, give hints of what certain
areas might look like.
Nothing "earth-shattering"
In the Student Affairs office —
which runs such diverse functions
as academic advising and Tresidder
Union — Rice said budget cuts
would not be "earth-shattering."
With respect to the ethnic cen
ters, which are under student

affairs, Rice said a "strategic plan"
for the ethnic centers is being devel
oped and should be finished within
a few days.
Rice addressed the student
activism that has surrounded
potential cuts to the centers by say
ing that she never said the ethnic
centers would have to cut 30 per
cent of their budgets, but rather
that the 30 percent figure, like the
15 percent figure, was a "planning
parameter" for student affairs as a
whole.
Rice added, however, that the
ethnic centers must hxik at their
value and whether to restructure,
like iill other areas.
"I asked physics to justify their
existence, I asked the ethnic centers
to justify their existence," she said.
She also said that the union of
Stanford's financial aid and admis
sions offices was not meant to sig
nal an end to need-blind admis
sions.
"One can never promise forever
that we're going to be able to keep
(need-blind admissions) but I think
we're committed to it for as long as
we can maintain it, and I consider it
to be a very important part of what
makes Stanford Stanford and what
makes the United States a place

where people can think about
upward mobility," she said. "It's
philosophically very important to
us."
Rice also said the University
must look at "a lot of different pos
sibilities" for changing Tresidder
Union to make it more efficient and
serve more students. She said "dif
ferent management scenarios" —
including perhaps contracting the
management of the union to an
outside company — should be con
sidered. She added, however, that
outside management is not being
considered for dormitory food ser
vice.
She also said that care is being
taken not to restructure or cut aca
demic advising in any way that
might interfere with the work of
the Commission on Undergraduate
Education.
Cowell Student Health Center is
also unlikely to change much in this
process because of current changes
in the University health system as a
whole, she said.
Meanwhile, a blueprint for cuts
in Library and Information
Resources is not due until Feb. 15
because the unit has academic as
well as administrative functions,
she said.
