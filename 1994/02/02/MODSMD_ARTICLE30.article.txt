# Dueling to stay warm
## Fencers demonstrate talent, seek experience on chilly trip east 
### Roger Han Staff writer 
The Stanford men's and women's fencing teams
encountered stifT competition, as well as bone-chilling
temperatures, when they traveled to the East Coast
this past weekend.
The Cardinal women split their matches against
ten schools, 5-5, and were led by sophomores Morgan
Hoch and Stephanie Wien. The two finished with 23-
16 records in individual bouts. Overall, the women
won 83 bouts and lost 77.
The Stanford women downed Rutgers, Farleigh
Dickinson, Duke, North Carolina and Northwestern,
and but came up short against Temple, University of

Pennsylvania, Princeton, St. John's and Penn State
The losses to UPenn and Princeton were by mere 9-7
margins.
A snowstorm disrupted the schedule Thursday when
the Stanford fencers endured a hour delay at UPenn,
then competed in a meet which lasted eight hours.
"It was probably one of the most disorganized
matches in all my life," said Stanford women's coach
Sherry Posthumus.
The win against a tough Farleigh Dickinson squad
was a first for Stanford, said Posthumus. The Cardinal
took the hotly contested bout, 9-7. They were, howev
er, overmatched against defending NCAA champion
Penn State, who swept the Cardinal 16-0.
"Penn State just ran all over us," she said. "The

women were just in awe â€” a little starstruck. But
overall 1 really was pleased with the way they did."
Because most of his foil team redshirted this year,
Stanford men's coach Zoran Tulum only took Stan
ford's epee and saber teams on the trip intending it to
be an opportunity for the two teams to gain experience
for next year.
While the men's epee team showed signs of
promise, the Cardinal finished with only two wins
against the nine schools it faced, beating Duke and
Johns Hopkins. Tulum praised the efforts of senior
Douglas Vanderbilt, who won more than half his
bouts. Only two years removed from a fencing gym
class, Vanderbilt competed like a much more experi
enced fencer, Tulum said

Young and inexperienced, the men's saber team lost
all of lUs matches, although several were as close as 5-
4. In individual bouts, however, the Stanford fencers
were almost even in wins and losses. The Cardinal
sabermen hung tough with the NCAA champion Nit
tany Lions squad, but eventually lost the bout 6-3.
"The results are saying that we do have talent,"
Tulum said. "But we need more experience to fence
the stronger teams."
At Penn State Saturday, the women faced seven
schools and fenced 28 bouts each Wien said the gruel
ing schedule took its toll late in the day.
"We fenced Princeton second to last We were lead
ing at first, but we were really tired and lost our con
centration," she said.
