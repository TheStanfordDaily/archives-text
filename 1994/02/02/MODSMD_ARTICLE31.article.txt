# Gaels sweep by baseball
## Tenth inning rally unable to redeem Cardinal 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
After a total of 43 runs had been
scored in the three previous games
at Sunken Diamond, a total of one
unearned inn on only five hits was
scored in yesterday's game.
The Cardinal baseball team fell
in the 10th inning to unranked St.
Mary's College 1-0. The loss drops
Stanford's record to 1-3 and puts
its No. 12 ranking in jeopardy as it
travels to Fresno State this Friday.
Stanford no-hit the Gaels for
nine innings, and the score
remained deadlocked at zero until
the top of the tenth inning, when a
throwing error by Stanford short
stop Eric Sees, freshman, allowed
the Gaels to score.
The Cardinal staged a late two
out rally in the bottom of the tenth,
with senior pinch-hitter Nate Olm
stead singling to right and Sees
doubling to left, setting up runners
at second and third with two outs.
This rally fell short, however, as
sophomore Brian Dallimore struck
out against Jeff Scarpitti (1-0), giv
ing St. Mary's the upset victory.
Unlike Stanford's three previ
ous games, pitching dominated

this contest. Cardinal southpaw
Dan Reed (0-1), sophomore, who
had been shelled in last Friday's
12-2 loss to Cal State Fullerton,
put together six innings of no-hit
pitching, rarely allowing the ball
out of the infield.
"I had pretty good success on
with my changeup, "Reed said.
"On Friday, I got into a lot of down
counts and my fastball had nothing
on it."
Reed was replaced by freshman
right-hander J.D. Brammer after
the sixth inning, and Brammer
shut out the Gaels for two more
innings before giving way to sopho
more left-hander Mike Robbins (0-
1). The four Cardinal hurlers sur
rendered only one hit.
Meanwhile, St. Mary's left
handed Eric Mooney baffled the
Cardinal hitters for seven innings,
allowing only two hits and two
walks.
"He did a good job," said Stan
ford first baseman Dusty Allen,
junior. "He really worked us away,
and was effective with his breaking
ball."
Despite Mooney's successful
outing, Stanford still had a chance
to win the game in the bottom of

the ninth inning, loading the bases
with one out against Scarpitti. I his
opportunity was lost, however,
when both second baseman junior
Jed Hansen and Allen struck out to
end the rally and send the game
into extra innings.
"On the offensive side of the
game we didn't play well at all,
Allen said. "We've got to capitalize
on a good pitching performance. If
we had put a couple of runs on the
board, we would have won."
Stanford's defense was marked
by sloppy play as well. The Cardi
nal committed three errors, one of
them allowing the eventual win
ning run to score. In stark contrast
to last weekend's run-fest against
Cal State Fullerton, the Cardinal
has now failed to score in 17
innings. Cardinal coach Mark Mar
quess was puzzled at his team's
lack of consistency.
"I thought their pitching staff
played well," Marquess said. "We
really didn't have trouble with any
pitches in particular, but it was a
combination of everything."
The Cardinal will try to bounce
back this Friday as they travel to
Fresno for a weekend series with
the Bulldogs.
