# Perfect court record
## Women's tennis wins 4th straight 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
If yesterday's women's tennis match
was a fight, then the Stanford team
squared off against Fresno State with
at least one hand tied behind its collec
tive back. Yet the second-ranked squad
was able to score an 8-0 knockout in the
friendly confines of the Stanford Tennis
Stadium.
The tied-hand analogy refers to the
fact that the Cardinal (4-0) faced the
Bulldogs (2-2) without its three top sin
gles players. Seniors Kristine Kurth
and Laxmi Poruri both only played dou
bles to give some of their younger, more
inexperienced players some singles
action. Sophomore Kim Shasby contin
ued to sit out of both her singles and
doubles matches due to a foot injury,
although she is practicing.
In place of this top trio, some
younger Stanford players got a chance
to swing their rackets. And swing they
did, as the Cardinal only dropped one
set in six singles matches, showing off

the strength of head coach Frank Bren
nan's bench.
"We have a lot of depth," Brennan
said. "The players we put on the courts
today were very motivated."
Playing number one singles for the
first time in her very young Stanford
career, freshman Katie Schlukebir con
tinued to impress with a decisive 6-0, 6-
1 victory over Mary Fallara. She then
teamed up with Poruri, the top-ranked
player in the country, to form Stan
ford's number one doubles team which
promptly dismissed the Bulldog team of
Fallara-Amy Gallagher 6-2, 6-3.
Poruri has just returned from play
ing in a satellite pro tournament in
Austin, Texas, where was able to reach
the quarterfinals after winning four
grueling matches just to qualify. In
playing with the freshman, Poruri has
some feelings of deja vu.
"It's a reversal of what Teri
Whitlinger and I did my freshman
year," Poruri said. "I looked to Teri for
guidance and how to respond to pres
sure. But Katie is very mature."

Sophomore Beth Be iris garnered the
Cardinal's second win hy beating Gal
lagher in singles 6-1, 6-2, followed by
senior Emma Woodhouse's 6-3, 1-6, 6-1
victory against Marta Pitarch.
"I was pleased with Emma Wood
house," Brennan said. "She wasn't let
ting any loose points get away against
Pitarch and that's a good sign for her."
Freshmen rounded out two of Stan
ford's last three singles slots. Sandra De
Silva played at number four singles and
crushed Samantha Romero 6-0, 6-1
while Emily Burt beat Ann Papi in the
sixth singles slot, 6-1, 6-1. Sophomore
Wendy Sacks nailed down the last Car
dinal singles victory 6-1, 6-2.
In doubles action, the only other
team to play was Stanford's number
two team of Kurth-Burt. Another
senior/freshman combo, these two
rebounded from their tough loss to
Washington on Saturday to beat Papi-
Viki Potter 6-1, 6-3. The third doubles
match of Berris-Woodhouse vs. Pitarch-
Smith was cancelled; thus, only eight
total matches were played.
