# Dean steps down, opts for teaching
## Earth Sciences' five-year head Ernst will return to classroom, research 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
After five years as dean of the
School of Earth Sciences, Gary
Ernst is going to return to teach
ing and research full-time.
Ernst is leaving the position ef
fective Sept. 1. In a memo to
Earth Sciences staff and faculty,
Ernst said his resignation will let
him "devote my energies more
completely 'to the environmental
programs in the IGeological and
Environmental Sciences] Depart
ment as well as Earth Systems. It
is also high time to crank up my
research programs a bit, too."
Ernst has been out of town for
several days and could not be
reached for comment on his resig
nation.
A national search likely will be
conducted ta find a new dean, but
Provost Condoleezza Rice said
that search probably will not
begin this year. In the meantime,
Rice said an interim dean will like
ly be appointed.
Ernst has presided over a time
of great change for the School of
Earth Sciences, beginning with
the Loma Prieta earthquake that

struck soon after he came to Stan
ford in 1989. That earthquake
damaged the Geology Corner and
forced some Earth Sciences facul
ty to move.
Since then, Ernst has overseen
an ongoing effort to raise $30 mil
lion for the school and the con
struction of the new Green Earth
Sciences Building. Also during his
tenure, the school created the en
vironmentally-oriented Earth
Systems major and merged its Ge
ology and Applied Earth Sciences
Departments last year to form the
new Geological and Environmen
tal Sciences Department.
Ernst provided "bold, new di
rections for the School of Earth
Sciences," said Johnathan Steb
bins, an associate professor of ge
ological and environmental sci
ences. Stebbins said Ernst has
worked to link Earth Sciences
with other disciplines and played
a major part in raising funds for
the new Green building.
Stebbins also called the Earth
Systems program, which Ernst
helped to start and teaches in, "a
real success story."
