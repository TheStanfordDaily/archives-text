# Division laid off in Facilities shake-up
## 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
Due to a sudden staff shake-up
announced last week, the acting
manager of University projects, as
well as the entire project engi
neering division of Facilities, were
laid off Monday.
"This is not part of the
provost's budget cuts," said
Kernel Dawkins, associate vice
president for Facilities and acting
director of Facilities project man
agement "We just needed to thin
out some of the layers of manage
ment."
In eliminating the eight posi
tions, Dawkins laid off two man
agers, four engineers and the two
division secretaries in what was
Facilities' second reorganization
within a year.
The engineering unit previous
ly administered the contracting of
campus building renovations and
maintenance. In the future, the
projects division will hire outside

contracting management firms.
A higher-level position that
had been left unfilled — the direc
tor of project management — will
oversee the building contracting
administration and maintenance.
Facilities is now looking for some
one to hire for thejob.
Dawkins also said the unfin
ished projects which had been
handled by the now-dissolved
group have been temporarily dis
tributed to various other divi
sions, such as utilities, and that
the former employees likely will
be consulted by phone. Specific
plans for the long-term should be
resolved by the end of the week,
according to Dawkins.
Most of those laid-off were
long-time University employees.
Engineer UlfTeigen, for instance,
had been working at Stanford for
nine years.
