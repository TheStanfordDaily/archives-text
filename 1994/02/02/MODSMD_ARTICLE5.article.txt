# Division laid off in Facilities shake-up
## 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
Due to a sudden staff shake-up
announced last week, the acting
manager of University projects, as
well as the entire project engi
neering division of Facilities, were
laid off Monday.
"This is not part of the
provost's budget cuts," said
Kernel Dawkins, associate vice
president for Facilities and acting
director of Facilities project man
agement "We just needed to thin
out some of the layers of manage
ment."
In eliminating the eight posi
tions, Dawkins laid off two man
agers, four engineers and the two
division secretaries in what was
Facilities' second reorganization
within a year.
The engineering unit previous
ly administered the contracting of
campus building renovations and
maintenance. In the future, the
projects division will hire outside

contracting management firms.
A higher-level position that
had been left unfilled — the direc
tor of project management — will
oversee the building contracting
administration and maintenance.
Facilities is now looking for some
one to hire for thejob.
Dawkins also said the unfin
ished projects which had been
handled by the now-dissolved
group have been temporarily dis
tributed to various other divi
sions, such as utilities, and that
the former employees likely will
be consulted by phone. Specific
plans for the long-term should be
resolved by the end of the week,
according to Dawkins.
Most of those laid-off were
long-time University employees.
Engineer UlfTeigen, for instance,
had been working at Stanford for
nine years.
The engineers interviewed
Mondav said thev were baffled
and hurt by the move, and divi
sion manager Tom DiPressi said
that work on unfinished projects
— worth hundreds of millions of
dollars — probably would be
wasted.
"The toxic gas project, that's
down the drain. We had projects
going on with the central energy
facility and Green Library, too,"
DiPressi said. "There was no
analysis done."
DiPressi said he wrote letters
to University President Gerhard
Casper and Provost Condoleezza
Rice criticizing the layoffs.
"Regarding the move, I have
not seen a (transition) plan. I
have not been consulted on devel
oping a plan either," DiPressi
added.
Dawkins, who came to Stan
ford just nine months ago, said
that the decision had been in the
works for months.
Several people familiar with
the situation speculated that part
of the reason for the shake-up
may have been problems at the
Stauffer buildings — a project
managed by the division that
went severely over budget and
led to the departure of one of the
engineering project managers in
September.
Dawkins denied that the sin
gle incident was directly respon
sible for the layoffs and insisted
that the decision was based on
eliminating bureaucracy.
"It was a long process in the
examination of project manage
ment," Dawkins said.
But the engineers said they
had no warning of the layoff
bomb dropped last week.
"I still haven't gotten over the
shock," said Teigen. "There was
no warning on such drastic man
agement. [Theyl earlier talked
about each group making a 5 to
10 percent cut."

Dawkins said he ordered the
workers' immediate release to
allow them time to search for
new jobs full-time. The laid-off
workers will receive one month's
salary plus severance pay.
In addition, DiPressi said two
plainclothes policemen were out
side the door when he was
informed of his layoff. The police
men were also present in the
building during the other layoff's.
Dawkins said the security was
brought in so that the employees
would not do anything in a fit of
emotion "that they might regret
later."
One of the laid-off employees
may stay with the University.
Valerie Veronin —- the acting
manager of University projects
— has been at Stanford for 15
years, and Dawkins said she is
negotiating with the University
for another position. "If she
leaves, it will be her decision to
leave," he said.
DiPressi and the other engi
neers said they feel the decision
was not an economic one.
"We're completely self-sus
taining. We earn our expenses,"
DiPressi said. "We don't have a
job if there's no building (to
build). We're paid per project,
and we're not allowed to make a
profit."
DiPressi said that surplus
over the estimated cost of the
division's projects — which
amounted to $70,000 last year —
goes toward the unit's overhead
costs.
Wayne Paulsen, another divi
sion engineer, expressed similar
sentiments.
"I don't think it's cheaper, but
apparently someone thinks it is,"
Paulsen said. "A consultant
doesn't have the same (institu
tional) knowledge basis or the
interest in the University."
According to Dawkins, the
future costs will be "considerably
less," but he declined to quantify
how much because of current
negotiations.

according to Dawkins.
Most of those laid-off were
long-time University employees.
Engineer UlfTeigen, for instance,
had been working at Stanford for
nine years.
The engineers interviewed
Mondav said thev were baffled
and hurt by the move, and divi
sion manager Tom DiPressi said
that work on unfinished projects
— worth hundreds of millions of
dollars — probably would be
wasted.
"The toxic gas project, that's
down the drain. We had projects
going on with the central energy
facility and Green Library, too,"
DiPressi said. "There was no
analysis done."
DiPressi said he wrote letters
to University President Gerhard
Casper and Provost Condoleezza
Rice criticizing the layoffs.
"Regarding the move, I have
not seen a (transition) plan. I
have not been consulted on devel
oping a plan either," DiPressi
added.
Dawkins, who came to Stan
ford just nine months ago, said
that the decision had been in the
works for months.
Several people familiar with
the situation speculated that part
of the reason for the shake-up
may have been problems at the
Stauffer buildings — a project
managed by the division that
went severely over budget and
led to the departure of one of the
engineering project managers in
September.
Dawkins denied that the sin
gle incident was directly respon
sible for the layoffs and insisted
that the decision was based on
eliminating bureaucracy.
"It was a long process in the
examination of project manage
ment," Dawkins said.
But the engineers said they
had no warning of the layoff
bomb dropped last week.
"I still haven't gotten over the
shock," said Teigen. "There was
no warning on such drastic man
agement. [Theyl earlier talked
about each group making a 5 to
10 percent cut."

Dawkins said he ordered the
workers' immediate release to
allow them time to search for
new jobs full-time. The laid-off
workers will receive one month's
salary plus severance pay.
In addition, DiPressi said two
plainclothes policemen were out
side the door when he was
informed of his layoff. The police
men were also present in the
building during the other layoff's.
Dawkins said the security was
brought in so that the employees
would not do anything in a fit of
emotion "that they might regret
later."
One of the laid-off employees
may stay with the University.
Valerie Veronin —- the acting
manager of University projects
— has been at Stanford for 15
years, and Dawkins said she is
negotiating with the University
for another position. "If she
leaves, it will be her decision to
leave," he said.
DiPressi and the other engi
neers said they feel the decision
was not an economic one.
"We're completely self-sus
taining. We earn our expenses,"
DiPressi said. "We don't have a
job if there's no building (to
build). We're paid per project,
and we're not allowed to make a
profit."
DiPressi said that surplus
over the estimated cost of the
division's projects — which
amounted to $70,000 last year —
goes toward the unit's overhead
costs.
Wayne Paulsen, another divi
sion engineer, expressed similar
sentiments.
"I don't think it's cheaper, but
apparently someone thinks it is,"
Paulsen said. "A consultant
doesn't have the same (institu
tional) knowledge basis or the
interest in the University."
According to Dawkins, the
future costs will be "considerably
less," but he declined to quantify
how much because of current
negotiations.
