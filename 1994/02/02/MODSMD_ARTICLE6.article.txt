# Taco Bell to open in March
## Blueprint glitch delays opening 
### Elissa Lee Staff writer 
The much-anticipated Taco Bell — once sched
uled to open in Tresidder Union at the beginning of
this quarter — will not begin business until the last
week of March, at the earliest.
But the projected spring-quarter opening may
not even be met because problems with architectur
al drawings have prevented Tresidder from obtain
ing the necessary building permits.
"We met with representatives from Taco Bell and
some of the drawings had to be redone," said Tresid
der Director Bobbi Braden.
According to Braden, the drawings required revi
sion because they failed to accommodate equipment
that Tresidder staff and Taco Bell agreed to have in
side the restaurant.
Although the blueprints are due back in two to
three weeks, it is unclear how long it will take to ob
tain the necessary building permit, thus pushing
back the proposed opening until the beginning of
spring quarter, Braden said.
Plans for bringing Taco Bell to campus were fi
nalized in November The restaurant, which will be
located at the front desk of the recreation center, will
offer a limited menu and stay open for business until
2 a.m.
