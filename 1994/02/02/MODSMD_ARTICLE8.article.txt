# Conflict policy gives Stanford more ownership
## 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
Any discoveries made by Stanford faculty mem
bers using University resources will be claimed by the
University under a proposed policy on faculty conflict
of commitment and interest released yesterday by
the Committee on Research.
The long-awaited policy, which was delayed for
several months because of extensive discussions, lays
out the guidelines that faculty members will be re
quired to follow while balancing their University re
search and teaching with any outside activities.
"The real intent of this policy is to educate — to let
people know what conflicts of interest are Most fac
ulty and stall would not anticipate that they would
find themselves in conflict of interest situations,"
said Biology Prof. Craig Heller, the chair of the com
mittee.
The policy will be the subject of several open fo
rums before it reaches the Faculty Senate for discus
sion and approval March 3.
Several of the policy's 10 provisions simply for
malize practices already followed by some of the Uni
versity's departments.
What Heller and other committee members said
they believe is the most contro
versial part of the new policy is
the question of "intellectual prop
erty rights."
Under Stanford's existing poli
cy, the rights to any new discover
ies belong to the faculty inventor
if the discovery is made using out
side grants or gift funds. But if
the research is done solely using
University funds, the patent
belongs to Stanford.
However, since most faculty
members receive a mix of support
from several sources, they are
placed in a difficult position when
it comes time to determine who
owns the new technology.
"You put a faculty member in a
conflict of interest situation by
saying, 'What funding source
were you working under when
you came up with this idea?' "
said Assoc. Dean of Research Pat
Devaney, a committee member.
Under the proposed policy, all
technologies discovered by Stan
ford faculty members must be
disclosed to the University. Anv

discoveries made using Universi
ty funds, even in conjunction
with outside grants, will auto
matically belong to Stanford,
although the inventor will share
in the royalties.
"This will be, for some faculty,
a big change in what they perceive
of their rights in terms of employ
ment," said Heller. However,
Heller said he believes that the
policy will not dampen faculty
research activities or the number
of grants that faculty receive.
"It's in the best interest of the
sponsor," Heller said. "The Uni
versity has the staff to make sure
that patents are filed. It's a
headache for the individual to do
all that." Heller added that he
believes "entrepreneurial spirit"
will remain high because the
inventor receives the royalties
without having to go through the
filing process.
The only exception to the
"intellectual property rights"
stipulation are such things as
books, articles or works of art and
music, which are "the normal
outcome of scholarly academic
activity," Heller said.
Because faculty members have
some degree of academic freedom,

"these (products] are historically
copyrighted. The University does
not take control unless the grant
supporting the work specifies it,"
he said.
The policy also will require fac
ulty members to inform the Uni
versity on an annual basis of all
their outside commitments and
interests. These disclosures will
then be reviewed by school deans
or committees made up of faculty
representatives "to see whether
any serious problems exist,"
Heller said.
Heller and Devaney said they
expect some dispute over the
specifics of the policy. "The facul
ty themselves have asked to have
more guidance — the idea itself
is not controversial. But the spe
cific components of it will proba
bly be debated quite a bit,"
Devaney said.
Stanford's current conflict of
interest policy was formulated in
the 19605, Heller said. The com
mittee began creating a new poli
cy in 1992 after University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper suggested
the issue needed re-examination.
"The past policy doesn't quite
match the needs of events hap
pening today," Heller said.
