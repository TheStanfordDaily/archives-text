### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
Any discoveries made by Stanford faculty mem
bers using University resources will be claimed by the
University under a proposed policy on faculty conflict
of commitment and interest released yesterday by
the Committee on Research.
The long-awaited policy, which was delayed for
several months because of extensive discussions, lays
out the guidelines that faculty members will be re
quired to follow while balancing their University re
search and teaching with any outside activities.
"The real intent of this policy is to educate â€” to let
people know what conflicts of interest are Most fac
ulty and stall would not anticipate that they would
find themselves in conflict of interest situations,"
said Biology Prof. Craig Heller, the chair of the com
mittee.
The policy will be the subject of several open fo
rums before it reaches the Faculty Senate for discus
sion and approval March 3.
Several of the policy's 10 provisions simply for
malize practices already followed by some of the Uni
versity's departments.
