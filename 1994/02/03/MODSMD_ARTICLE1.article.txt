# Conservative controversy?
## Winds of Freedom's credibility in question 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writers 
Since appearing on the Stanford scene
three months ago, Winds of Freedom has
rapidly grown into what may be the na
tion's largest group of conservative alum
ni and students, boasting more than
1,400 members and a mailing list of
60,000.
Such growth showcases a restless and
increasingly resonant voice of alumni dis
gruntlement, and has inspired significant
concern among some students and ad
ministrators.
Although the group insists only that it
is committed to restoring a "traditional
liberal arts education," and channeling
"the tremendous dissatisfaction of alum
ni," its critics claim that Winds aims to
roll back the University's recent multicul
tural reforms.
Yet despite the national prominence
the group has achieved, an examination
by The Daily has unveiled an organization

that is very much consumed with keeping
its finances and operations secret, even as
it aspires to grab headlines.
Also under dispute are published
claims that three prominent Stanford
alumni have contributed to the organiza
tion despite their denial of any involve
ment.
Hut perhaps most striking is the
group's pattern of backtracking and eva
sion and its tendency to produce contra
dictory answers to questions as mundane
as who controls the group and whether
money donated to The Stanford Review
helps fund Winds.
Highly publicized beginnings
An idea originally conceived by several
members of The Review staff, Winds got
off the ground last fall with a highly pub
licized conference on undergraduate edu
cation and a mailing to about 20,000
alumni, most of whom had previously
contributed to The Review.
