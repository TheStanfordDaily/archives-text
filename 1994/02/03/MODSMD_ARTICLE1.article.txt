# Conservative controversy?
## Winds of Freedom's credibility in question 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writers 
Since appearing on the Stanford scene
three months ago, Winds of Freedom has
rapidly grown into what may be the na
tion's largest group of conservative alum
ni and students, boasting more than
1,400 members and a mailing list of
60,000.
Such growth showcases a restless and
increasingly resonant voice of alumni dis
gruntlement, and has inspired significant
concern among some students and ad
ministrators.
Although the group insists only that it
is committed to restoring a "traditional
liberal arts education," and channeling
"the tremendous dissatisfaction of alum
ni," its critics claim that Winds aims to
roll back the University's recent multicul
tural reforms.
Yet despite the national prominence
the group has achieved, an examination
by The Daily has unveiled an organization

that is very much consumed with keeping
its finances and operations secret, even as
it aspires to grab headlines.
Also under dispute are published
claims that three prominent Stanford
alumni have contributed to the organiza
tion despite their denial of any involve
ment.
Hut perhaps most striking is the
group's pattern of backtracking and eva
sion and its tendency to produce contra
dictory answers to questions as mundane
as who controls the group and whether
money donated to The Stanford Review
helps fund Winds.
Highly publicized beginnings
An idea originally conceived by several
members of The Review staff, Winds got
off the ground last fall with a highly pub
licized conference on undergraduate edu
cation and a mailing to about 20,000
alumni, most of whom had previously
contributed to The Review.
Winds was advertised as a
"joint project" of The Review and
the Intercollegiate Studies Insti
tute (ISI), a 50,000-member orga
nization based in Bryn Mawr, Pa.,
that oversees conservative stu
dent groups at more than 1,000
colleges and universities nation
wide.
The symposium, attended by
80 alumni and a handful a faculty
members and students, featured
panel discussions on aspects of
Stanford's education. Among
those who participated were
Hoover Institution Senior Fellow
Martin Anderson, Wall Street
Journal editor and Stanford
alumnus Tim Ferguson and Jean
Fetter, assistant to University
President Gerhard Casper. The
event also included a lavish $100-
per-plate dinner with Lynne
Cheney, former head of the
National Endowment for the
Humanities.
Many of those in attendance
lashed out at what they perceived
as Stanford's surrender to politi
cal correctness in recent years.
Some decried the change from
Western Culture to the Cultures,
Ideas and Values program, the
proliferation of ethnic theme
houses and the creation of a Uni
versity speech code.
"These were very aggressive
alumni — I didn't know such peo
ple existed," said German Prof.
Gerald Gillespie, who attended
the conference. "There was great
discontent among the alumni
with what the University had
done, at least since the mid-80s
until when Casper came here."
The symposium — which
began with the group's executive
director, senior Christopher Grey,
holding a full-fledged press con
ference — attracted national

media attention in the following
weeks. Stories about the group
appeared in the San Francisco
Chronicle, the Sacramento Bee,
the Dallas Morning News and the
Boston Globe.

or espouse the prin
ciples of Winds.
They're a little bit out
in right field — actu
ally, they're com
pletely in right field.'
— Charles Schwab

In trumpeting the group's
startling success, the four news
papers reported that Winds had
received support from three
prominent Stanford alumni:
Charles Schwab, founder of the
discount-brokerage company that
bears his name; David Packard,
co-founder of Hewlett-Packard
Co.; and Stephen Bechtel, Jr.,
chairman of the Bechtel Group.
Contribution questions
But when reached by The Daily
this week, all three denied ever
having contributed to the Winds
of Freedom.
"The story was erroneous,"
said Jeff Berger, a spokesman for
Bechtel. However, representa
tives for Bechtel and Packard
acknowledged that both had
donated to The Review within the
past few years.
The mention of Schwab's
name in the reports on Winds has
invited the most scrutiny, espe
cially since his being named to the
Stanford Board of Trustees in
December.
A press release issued by Stan

ford Students for an Informed
Community — a newly formed
campus organization opposing
Winds — claims that Schwab has
"strong ties to the Winds of Free
dom."
As recently as last week, Chris
Long, the vice president for pro
grams at ISI who handles Winds'
account, said Schwab "contribut
ed reasonable but modest sums —

not any more
than other alum
ni have done."
But in an
interview last
week, Schwab
denied any sup
port for Winds.
"I don't agree
(with) or espouse
the principles of

Winds," he said. "They're a little
bit out in right field — actually,
they're completely in right field."
In a Jan. 25 letter to Winds
obtained by The Daily, Mary B.
Templeton, senior vice president
and general counsel at Charles
Schwab & Co., wrote that "Mr.
Schwab has never endorsed the
Winds of Freedom project and has
not contributed any funds to the
project."
The letter goes on to say that
Schwab had "responded to a
request for funds to support the
operating expenses of [The
Review] by donating $250.00" in
1992. Templeton also demanded
that Winds immediately stop the
use of Schwab's name in "this or
any other context."
Asked about the contributions
last week, Grey told The Daily
that Schwab had not responded to
Winds' invitation to the confer
ence or its solicitation for dona
tions. He did say that Schwab had
"given money to The Review a
couple of times."
During the same conversation,
Grey said that donations to The
Review, in essence, constituted
donations to Winds.

"Winds of Freedom is part of
The Review," he said. "Its budget
comes from money raised by The
Review and supporting activities.
Winds is another way of getting
our message out, getting more
people involved. It's an offshoot."
4 A joint project'
None of the newspapers
attributed the information con
cerning Schwab, Bechtel and
Packard, but sources told The
Daily that the names of the three
donors were proffered by Grey —
which he denied last night.
Grey contends that he said
only that Bechtel and Packard
gave funds to The Review. "It's
been misconstrued from the
start," he said. He declined to
comment further, deferring all
questions to Winds' director,
junior Adam Ross.
In a conversation later last
week, Long said that "money
raised for Winds is put in a sepa
rate account to raise money for
the conference and newsletter."
He also said that Winds acts as an
"umbrella group" over The
Review, and that Winds' excess
funds will at "some point be
donated to The Review."
"Eventually, the hope is there
will be enough money to fund The
Review," Long said.
Ross, Winds' director and offi
cial spokesperson, refused to dis
cuss Winds' relationship with
either The Review or ISI, other
than to say it is "a joint project."
Ross, who is also editor in chief
of The Review, refused to talk to
The Daily, responding only to
written questions submitted to
him. He would not comment on
any questions involving the
finances and membership of both
The Review and Winds, including
whether Schwab had contributed
to either organization. He also
would not discuss whether The
Review has ever given money to
Winds.

At the same time, Ross, in his
statement to The Daily, called
himself "the official spokesman
for the organization." He said all
other statements "should be con
strued as the opinions of individu
als, not the organization."
Ross, who recently replaced
Grey as the group's leader, was
named to the post by The
Review's board of directors,
which also serves as the board of
directors for Winds.
Winds has only two
definite goals: elimi
nation of the Univer
sity's speech code
and the restoration of
a Western civilization
requirement.
— Adam Ross
Winds is a "non-profit organi
zation. It derives its non-profit
status from (ISI), also a non-prof
it organization, which is commit
ted to helping Winds get off the
ground," Ross wrote. He also said
that "some (of Winds') operations
are run out ISl's office in Bryn
Mawr."
Rising opposition
The organization's tactics in
attracting speakers to the Novem
ber conference have also come
under question. Fetter, who mod
erated one of the panels said,
when initially approached, she
"didn't know what I was accept
ing."
Fetter, a former dean of
undergraduate admissions, said
Grey called her in September and
said he was "helping organize a
conference on undergraduate

education at Stanford — that's
how the invitation was extend
ed."
She said the conference sound
ed "like a noble cause," and
agreed to appear. But she soon
discovered that the conference
was "limited to a small number of
students," and only after ques
tioning Grey on that issue was she
told that Winds was the sympo
sium's sponsor.
At the conference, Fetter was
the lone voice defending Universi
ty policies amid a barrage of criti
cism from attendees.
"Don't imply by association
that I'm a supporter of them," she
said.
Winds is also running into stu
dent opposition. Stanford Stu
dents for an Informed Communi
ty is planning to hold a news con
ference tomorrow to discuss
"how, up to this point, Winds has
kept its actions under wraps and
how it's hard to keep tabs on
them," said senior Nicole
Sanchez, one of the group's orga
nizers.
Sanchez said she fears that
University administrators are
being pressured by Winds, espe
cially in regards to students of
color.
Ross downplays such criti
cisms, saying that Winds has only
two definite goals: elimination of
the University's speech code and
the restoration of a Western civi
lization requirement.
"Other than these two planks,
Winds has no specific checklist,"
Ross wrote in his statement.
In addition, Winds is planning
to form a sub-group to examine
undergraduate education, in par
allel to the University's Commis
sion on Undergraduate Educa
tion.
"We hope to play an active role
in the debate to overhaul the cur
riculum and change the Universi
ty in a positive direction," Ross
wrote.
