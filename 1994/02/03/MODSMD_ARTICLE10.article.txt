Perry cautious about Korea
WASHINGTON (AP) - The United
States should pursue an aggressive diplo
matic effort to avoid a "nightmare sce
nario" of nuclear war in Korea, William
Perry told senators yesterday at his confir
mation hearing to be defense secretary.
International sanctions against North
Korea could be around the corner, he said.
Perry, now the No. 2 official at the Pen
tagon, would replace Les Aspin, who
resigned under pressure in December.
Perry told the senators he supports
sending Patriot missiles to South Korea.
He said a final decision by President Clin
ton awaits consultation with the South
Korean government.
Asked whether the United States
should continue to press for human rights
reforms in China or seek China's support

in dealing with North Korea, Perry said he
backed efforts to improve China's human
rights stance.

DENNIS, Mass. (AP) â€” Figure skater
Nancy Kerrigan was pronounced physical
ly and mentally fit for the Olympics yes

knocked her out of the national champi
onships.
"If there were any doubt or any ques
tions about Nancy Kerrigan's skating con
dition, she answered them for us this
afternoon," said Chuck Foster, the secre

one of the four judges who watched Kerri

expect that she is going to do very well in
Norway."
