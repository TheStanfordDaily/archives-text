## Editorial Good idea, bad policy Sixth Man Club should change unfair seating rules to be real boosters 
### 
STRANGE BEINGS have visit
ed Maples Pavilion lately dur
ing men's basketball games.
You may have seen these red
shirted denizens jumping up and
down after each Cardinal basket,
screaming at the referees whenever
possible, or slam dancing in the
bleacher section as a three-pointer
swishes through the net.
They are members of the Sixth
Man Club, the brainchild of Stan
ford's sports marketing gurus. For a
mere $10, members of the club get a
red T-shirt, free food at Halftime
Sports Bar and a guaranteed seat in
the front of the student bleachers for
all men's basketball home games.
The club was created this year to
give a shot in the arm to limpid fan
support.
And one look at a typical crowd
this year shows it worked.
However, the club has serious
flaws that must be rectified to clari
fy its purpose.
While the club has brought new
life to a crowd that last year looked
like it was watching croquet, its
guaranteed-seating policy is bla
tantly unfair.
This is especially evident when
students who wait hours to get into
Maples to attend games get turned
away because Sixth Man Club mem
bers have taken up so much of the
student bleachers — as was the case
in the sold-out Cal and UCLA games.
With 250 members, the club can
take up one-fourth of the total stu
dent seating, all of which is sup
posed to be free and open to Stan
ford students. And at the Stanford-
USC game, a section for Sixth Man
that was roped off but was not filled
completely was still restricted to
other non-members.
Clearly, all students should have
equal access to seats. Paying $10 for
virtual "season tickets" hardly seems
fair to those who missed entering the

club or simply don't want to pay for
seats which should be free.
Furthermore, fans who get to
Maples hours before the game starts
can be expected to be at least as sup
portive and enthusiastic as any of
the "sixth men."
The club has its merits, which
include encouraging fan support and
rallying student spirit. But paying a
fee for a T-shirt and food should not
give members priority seating over
students who have waited hours in
line to get in to a sold out game.
In addition, if the goal of the
sports marketing group was to
involve more of the Stanford com
munity in men's basketball, it
should have made more of an effort
to widely publicize the club to those
who are not diehard fans.
Most of the members of the Sixth
Man Club would cheer the Cardinal
anyway. So the club serves only to
dress them in red, organize them
into a large mass in the center of the
student section, and relieve them of
their line-standing duties.
The club could breed an unkind
sense of elitism that makes some
fans better than others based on
how much they are willing to pay to
become a member.
A reasonable alternative for next
season would be to allow club mem
bers to sit together and properly raise
Cain, but still require them to stand
in line along with all other students.
This means their free-food session at
Halftime will be cut short, but that is
the price they must pay. "Devoted"
fans will compromise chow time if
they really want a spectacular view.
The type of organization of
diehards currently in place has
reached its immediate goal. The roar
of the crowd heard outside Maples
during every game is something
Stanford sorely missed in the past.
But now, it is time for sports mar
keting to reconsider the equity
implications of their tactics. By
allowing some fans the best seat in
the house at every game, the Sixth
Man Club effectively deprives all
others of the same opportunity.
Membership shouldn't have this
many privileges.
