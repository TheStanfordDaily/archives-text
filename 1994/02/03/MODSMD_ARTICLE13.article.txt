## Meyeran archi-torture 
### 
IN THE SUMMER of 1990, my family
went to Europe. It was there that my
younger brother Josh responded to the
onslaught of churches and other sights by
coining a phrase — "archi-torture."
Josh was complaining about the sheer
quantity of buildings we saw more than
their quality. But the other night while
talking about Stanford aesthetics, a friend
and I decided that "archi-torture" needed
re-definition.
Specifically, I'm talking about Meyer
Library. It's just about the ugliest and
most unimaginative building I've ever
seen — anywhere. I'm no art critic, but I
feel comfortable in calling it an architec
tural disaster.
My first question is — what the hell
happened? This is Stanford University,
allegedly one of the greatest institutions of
higher education in the world. Imagine
how the architect pitched his blueprint for
Meyer to the Stanford Board of Trustees
(or whoever paid for it):
Architect: Picture it. A massive cube.
Huge. We'll hollow out the inside. There'll
be a huge, 30-foot shaft in the middle. It'll
be filled with air.
Trustee: Air. I see. But will it have win
dows?
Architect: Will it have windows? Does a
bear have claws? This thing will have so
many windows it'll look like ... I don't
know. A building with a thousand win
dows.
Trustee: That's a lot of windows.
That's good. And will it be big?

Maybe they weren't morons. Maybe
they were drunk. Or better yet, stoned.
After all, it was the sixties. Maybe they
were even tripping. Oh, the possibilities.
Architect: Cubes, man. There'll be a big
cube. You know. A cube.
Trustee: The walls. The walls are
breathing.
Architect: Right, man, right. Air.
There'll be air. And space for the air. And
a thousand eyes, man. It'll have a thou
sand eyes and peer right into your soul.
Trustee: I'm dizzy. I'm going to vomit.
Somehow, somebody liked it. Liked it
enough to shell out big bucks to build it.
Soon, Stanford had its very own version of
the Parthenon. Of course, it wasn't
ancient Greece, and they fOrgot the Acrop
olis. It was the 19605. Everywhere else,
funk was the craze. But the Meyer archi
tects hailed from the '50s, when geometry
was in. Straight lines and squares, espe
cially.
To complement the fine work the
designers inflicted on Meyer's exterior,
Stanford brought in equally talented deco
rators to furnish the inside. There's noth
ing like the soft, sensual feel of those vinyl
chairs. And I can't think of more pleasing
colors than olive green and puke yellow.
It's the kind of genius that brings a tear to
your eye.
Now we're stuck with it. We've got one
of Auguste Rodin's greatest sculptures in
front of the world's ugliest building. And
worst of all, Meyer's too damn big to elim
inate. Somebody tried to burn it down, but

concrete isn't flammable.
So where do we go from here? With
something more trivial — like famine or
war — I'd have a quick response, hut with
Meyer, there are no easy answers.
Nevertheless, some friends and I put
our minds to work. Like the A-Team, sans
Murdock, we came up with a viable solu
tion in minutes. Picture this.
Floor one: Malibu Grand Prix. Take
out the books, leave the shelves as obsta
cles. Floor two: a huge, rubber-padded
room, fillet! with primitive drums. The
perfect place for taking out aggression
Floor three: a roller-rink. Floor four: a
disco that plays only Earth, Wind, and
Fire.
And in the center, where the air shaft
is, the grand-daddy of them all: bungee
jumping.
Before the University knew it, Meyer
would be bringing in more dollars than an
administrator could shake a stick at. Plus,
we'd have one less library — one that no
one uses, at that. Instead, we'd have some
place to do more of what we all need R-E-
L-A-X.
