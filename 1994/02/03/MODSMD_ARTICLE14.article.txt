## Schell focused on NCAAs in 50-meter freestyle

Speed.
In any sport, speed captures the
attention and imagination of fans and
casual observers alike.
Stanford swimmer Bill Schell has
speed. The 50-yard freestyle, a furious
sub-20 second sprint, is his specialty.
In comparison to the other sprinters on
the Cardinal squad, Schell, a senior
who hails from Camp Hill, Pa., focuses
almost all his attention on the quick
once-to-the-wall-and-back race. He
does it in workouts and in all of Stan

ford's meets. And he has done it faster
than anyone else in school history.
Since he began swimming competi
tively around age 12 for the local swim
club, Schell has always been "a 50 guy."
Upon arriving at Stanford, Schell
gained valuable experience swimming
on Cardinal relays at the NCAA Cham
pionships. Two years later, he was in
the hunt for the individual NCAA title
in the 50 free. In finishing third with a
time of 19.49 seconds, Schell shaved .08
off teammate Erik Maurer's Stanford
record.
Stanford coach Skip Kenney calls
Schell's ascent to the top of the Cardi

rial's all-time sprint list "an amazing
story."
"When Bill came here, he was lack
ing strength, flexibility, and a great
kick, three of the things you need to be
a great sprinter," Kenney said. "Of all
the athletes I've coached in my 15 years
here, no guy is more self-made than
Bill. I'm very impressed and he's been
fun to watch because with determina
tion he has made himself into a great
swimmer."
Kenney enjovs working with Schell
to improve his performance. "He is very
coachable," he said. "If I told him that
running around Hoover Tower 20 times
would improve his 50, he'd do it. Some
guys arrive here extremely gifted and
you're not surprised by things they do.
Bill worked his butt off and made
changes to get where he is."
Because it happens so fast and every
fraction of a second is crucial, the 50
free requires a large amount of mental
as well as physical preparation.
"At our level, a lot of it is mental,"
Schell said. "There's not much physical
difference among the top swimmers. In
terms of stroke and technique, you
know that if you mess up once — if you
don't have each part of the race down,
you really miss a lot."
One aspect of the sprint which Schell
uses to his advantage is the all-impor
tant start. Reaction to the gun is the
key, as a false-start results in disquali
fication on the first offense.
"I'm typically the first person off the
blocks, and that's all reaction time,"
Shell said. "At NCAAs you almost have
to know when the gun will go off.
"I get into the water as quickly as I
can and get up and get going. When I
hit the water, I get my kick going, and
turn it all on. That is the fastest point
of the race."
Schell said there are ways he can
gauge how he is doing in a race. "I want
to set up for the wall properly — the

race boils down to the start, the turn
and the wall. The wall is the most criti
cal point. The wave coming off the wall,
especially at NCAAs, is incredible. If
I'm first to the wall, I'm confident that
I'm going to win.
I'm typically the first per
son off the blocks, and
that's all reaction time.'
- Bill Schell
"I want to turn tight and quick.
You're on your side coming off the wall,
and you kick like anything," Schell con
tinued. "Because you're on your side,
this is the one time you can see your
competition. It's a big mental thing. At
that point you know where you stand.
From there, you just keep looking for
the wall."
In his most important competitions,
Schell achieves all of this without
breaking his rhythm once to catch a
breath.
Because Schell's primary event is so
specialized, Kenney often has Schell on
a slightly different training regimen
than his other athletes.
"Bill's race requires less endurance
and more technique, quickness and
reaction time," Kenney said. "You
don't want to over-train a sprinter. You
can train the quickness out of him."
"I don't have a huge training base,"
Schell added. "In the fall, we do some
over-distance work and I get kicked
around a bit in practice. Skip has a say
ing for me though, 'When you swim
easy, go easy, but when you do some
thing fast, you go all out.' For me, there
are pretty much two extremes. I do less
pace and distance than Joe [Hudepohll
who swims the 200 free and Brian |Ret

terer| who does backstroke. I do more
turnover and speedwork."
Kenney noted that Schell takes some
good-natured kidding from his team
mates because of his specific training
needs.
"Sometimes Bill comes out to prac
tice a little later than the other guys
and they give him a hard time," he said.
"It just takes less time for him to do
what he needs to do. The guys tease
him, but when it comes time to swim a
relay or a 50 free he scores big points
and they appreciate that."
Schell has been a great asset to Stan
ford's relays, especially the 200 free
relay and the 200 medley relay. At last
year's NCAAs, he swam the first leg of
the winning 200 free relay and was a
member of the second-place 200 medley
relay. In 1992, Schell was a part of the
American record 200 free relay at
NCAAs. This year, he is looking to cap
off his illustrious Stanford career with
another team title and hopes to capture
one of his own.
"For the team, to win and break the
record (for total points) would be
great," Schell said. "People have said
that this is the greatest team ever. It
would be nice to win the 200 free relay,
which we've won the past two years.
We'd also like to win the 200 medley
relay which we got second to Arizona in
last year. Individually, I'd love to win,
everyone does. I want to contribute as
much as I can to the team."
Kenney said that after so much
devotion to the sport, he thinks Schell
has an excellent chance of achieving his
goals at NCAAs.
"If you could take me back three
years, I'd say, 'Yeah, I'm surprised',"
Kenney said. "But after watching him
work so hard, it shows that so much of
athletics is determination."
For Bill Schell, it's a sweet combina
tion of determination, strength, pre
paredness, and lightning-fast speed.

to set up for the wall properly — the

race boils down to the start, the turn
and the wall. The wall is the most criti
cal point. The wave coming off the wall,
especially at NCAAs, is incredible. If
I'm first to the wall, I'm confident that
I'm going to win.
I'm typically the first per
son off the blocks, and
that's all reaction time.'
- Bill Schell
"I want to turn tight and quick.
You're on your side coming off the wall,
and you kick like anything," Schell con
tinued. "Because you're on your side,
this is the one time you can see your
competition. It's a big mental thing. At
that point you know where you stand.
From there, you just keep looking for
the wall."
In his most important competitions,
Schell achieves all of this without
breaking his rhythm once to catch a
breath.
Because Schell's primary event is so
specialized, Kenney often has Schell on
a slightly different training regimen
than his other athletes.
"Bill's race requires less endurance
and more technique, quickness and
reaction time," Kenney said. "You
don't want to over-train a sprinter. You
can train the quickness out of him."
"I don't have a huge training base,"
Schell added. "In the fall, we do some
over-distance work and I get kicked
around a bit in practice. Skip has a say
ing for me though, 'When you swim
easy, go easy, but when you do some
thing fast, you go all out.' For me, there
are pretty much two extremes. I do less
pace and distance than Joe [Hudepohll
who swims the 200 free and Brian |Ret

terer| who does backstroke. I do more
turnover and speedwork."
Kenney noted that Schell takes some
good-natured kidding from his team
mates because of his specific training
needs.
"Sometimes Bill comes out to prac
tice a little later than the other guys
and they give him a hard time," he said.
"It just takes less time for him to do
what he needs to do. The guys tease
him, but when it comes time to swim a
relay or a 50 free he scores big points
and they appreciate that."
Schell has been a great asset to Stan
ford's relays, especially the 200 free
relay and the 200 medley relay. At last
year's NCAAs, he swam the first leg of
the winning 200 free relay and was a
member of the second-place 200 medley
relay. In 1992, Schell was a part of the
American record 200 free relay at
NCAAs. This year, he is looking to cap
off his illustrious Stanford career with
another team title and hopes to capture
one of his own.
"For the team, to win and break the
record (for total points) would be
great," Schell said. "People have said
that this is the greatest team ever. It
would be nice to win the 200 free relay,
which we've won the past two years.
We'd also like to win the 200 medley
relay which we got second to Arizona in
last year. Individually, I'd love to win,
everyone does. I want to contribute as
much as I can to the team."
Kenney said that after so much
devotion to the sport, he thinks Schell
has an excellent chance of achieving his
goals at NCAAs.
"If you could take me back three
years, I'd say, 'Yeah, I'm surprised',"
Kenney said. "But after watching him
work so hard, it shows that so much of
athletics is determination."
For Bill Schell, it's a sweet combina
tion of determination, strength, pre
paredness, and lightning-fast speed.

Senior Bill Schell has made himself into a world-class swimmer in the 50-metei
freestyle with hard work and great reaction time.
Speed.
In any sport, speed captures the
attention and imagination of fans and
casual observers alike.
Stanford swimmer Bill Schell has
speed. The 50-yard freestyle, a furious
sub-20 second sprint, is his specialty.
In comparison to the other sprinters on
the Cardinal squad, Schell, a senior
who hails from Camp Hill, Pa., focuses
almost all his attention on the quick
once-to-the-wall-and-back race. He
does it in workouts and in all of Stan

ford's meets. And he has done it faster
than anyone else in school history.
Since he began swimming competi
tively around age 12 for the local swim
club, Schell has always been "a 50 guy."
Upon arriving at Stanford, Schell
gained valuable experience swimming
on Cardinal relays at the NCAA Cham
pionships. Two years later, he was in
the hunt for the individual NCAA title
in the 50 free. In finishing third with a
time of 19.49 seconds, Schell shaved .08
off teammate Erik Maurer's Stanford
record.
Stanford coach Skip Kenney calls
Schell's ascent to the top of the Cardi

rial's all-time sprint list "an amazing
story."
"When Bill came here, he was lack
ing strength, flexibility, and a great
kick, three of the things you need to be
a great sprinter," Kenney said. "Of all
the athletes I've coached in my 15 years
here, no guy is more self-made than
Bill. I'm very impressed and he's been
fun to watch because with determina
tion he has made himself into a great
swimmer."
Kenney enjovs working with Schell
to improve his performance. "He is very
coachable," he said. "If I told him that
running around Hoover Tower 20 times
would improve his 50, he'd do it. Some
guys arrive here extremely gifted and
you're not surprised by things they do.
Bill worked his butt off and made
changes to get where he is."
Because it happens so fast and every
fraction of a second is crucial, the 50
free requires a large amount of mental
as well as physical preparation.
"At our level, a lot of it is mental,"
Schell said. "There's not much physical
difference among the top swimmers. In
terms of stroke and technique, you
know that if you mess up once — if you
don't have each part of the race down,
you really miss a lot."
One aspect of the sprint which Schell
uses to his advantage is the all-impor
tant start. Reaction to the gun is the
key, as a false-start results in disquali
fication on the first offense.
"I'm typically the first person off the
blocks, and that's all reaction time,"
Shell said. "At NCAAs you almost have
to know when the gun will go off.
"I get into the water as quickly as I
can and get up and get going. When I
hit the water, I get my kick going, and
turn it all on. That is the fastest point
of the race."
Schell said there are ways he can
gauge how he is doing in a race. "I want
to set up for the wall properly — the
