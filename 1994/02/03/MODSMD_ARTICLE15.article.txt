Home sweet home.
Still licking its wounds from a
punishing three-game in-state
road odyssey, the Cardinal
women's basketball team returns
to Maples Pavilion to take on the
Oregon Ducks tonight.
After boasting a three-game
winning streak, a No. 10 ranking
and an arm's-length reach to the
top of the Pacific 10 Conference
standings just two weeks ago,
Stanford (11-5, 4-3 in the Pac
-10) had to recover from a slow
start to defeat archrival UC-
Berkeley at Cal Jan. 21. But the
Cardinal fell flat on its face last
week in Los Angeles, where
UCLA and USC handed Stan
ford its first back-to-back losses
and lowest ranking (No. 14) in
nearly six years.
Yet while the Cardinal finds
itself stuck at fifth place in the
Pac-10, it also finds a friendly
arena and potentially friendlier
matchup in tonight's contest.
Stanford enjoys tremendous sue

cess both at home — where it has
won 98 of its last 101 games and
seven straight — and against the
Ducks (11-5, 5-2), from whom
the Cardinal has taken 12
straight decisions, including an
84-69 rout in Maples last season.
While Stanford must win
tonight to retain its slim chances
of stealing the conference crown,
Oregon brings more to the con
test than just its Donald Duck
mascot. In fact, the Ducks, who
received three votes in the latest
Associated Press poll and are
riding a modest four-game win
ning streak, stand to gain
national respect and a share of
second place if they can pull off
the upset.
Attempting to make that
upset happen for Oregon will be a
trio of seniors that account for 58
percent of the team's offensive
production. Forward Debbie
Sporcich leads the Ducks in scor
ing and rebounding, netting 16.9
points per game and 9.8 rebounds
a contest (including 10.4 rpg in
Pac-10 play). Considered one of
the top all-around threats in the

conference, Sporcich stands to
lead Oregon in those categories
for the third and fourth consecu
tive seasons, respectively, and
already places 10th on the all
time Pac-10 rebounding list.
Center Sara Wilson joins
Sporcich on the Ducks' frontline
and poses another problem for
the Cardinal's redoubtable inside
duo of juniors Rachel Hemmer
and Anita Kaplan. Averaging an
impressive 16.1 ppg in confer
ence play, Wilson pulls down 8.4
boards per contest and shoots 58
percent from the field while scor
ing in double figures in every
Pac-10 game to date.
Meanwhile, point guard
Missy Croshaw (11.6 ppg) heads
an Oregon backcourt contingent
that will square off with Stan
ford's freshman Jamila Wide
man, senior Christy Hedgpeth
and junior Kate Paye, who
should be completely recovered
from a sprained ankle suffered
in practice last week.
Play tips off at 7:30 p.m., and
will be carried live by KZSU 90.1
FM.
