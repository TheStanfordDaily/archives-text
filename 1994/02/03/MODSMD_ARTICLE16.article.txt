# Men hope to rebound in Oregon
## Weekend trip will help clear up Pac-10 standings 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
The Stanford men's basketball
team travels north this weekend to
face unranked Oregon and Oregon
State in one of the season's more
dangerous series.
Dangerous? On paper, the
Ducks and Beavers appear to be
easy prey for the up-and-coming
Cardinal â€” the two squads have
combined to win only three confer
ence games on the season thus far.
The teams' miserable records,
however, may only make this
weekend's action more unpre
dictable. Sandwiched between last
Thursday's matchup with then
top-ranked UCLA and next week's
game versus No. 12 Arizona, Stan

ford may be in position for a let
down against this weekend's less
heralded opponents.
"Every Pac-10 game is impor
tant, especially at this point in the
season," Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery said. "We need to be
into both of these games."
Tied for fifth place in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference with a 4-3
record, a pair of wins this week
end would move the Cardinal (11-
5 overall) further away from the
.500 mark in conference play,
often the benchmark for postsea
son consideration in men's bas
ketball.
While the Ducks (6-10, 2-5 in
the Pac-10) have struggled in the
early-going, the team put together
its best conference performances

on the season last weekend in Ari
zona. After staying with the Wild
cats all game in a 98-86 loss at
McHale Arena, Oregon came with
in six of Arizona State, losing by a
84-78 margin.
Oregon State (5-11, 1-6) boasts
Brent Barry, son of former NBA
great Rick Barry, and not much
else. With no legitimate big men
on their roster, the Beavers have
struggled underneath, giving up
an average of 10 rebounds per
game more than they've collected.
The Cardinal's performance on
the boards against USC, however,
was hardly a testament to the art
of rebounding. The Trojans domi
nated the offensive boards 15-8 in
a game that was sloppily played on
both sides.
