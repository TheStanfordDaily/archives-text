# Diversity statement to be examined by Fac Sen
## 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
While a national controversy over the ac
creditation of colleges and universities con
tinues, Stanford will takeadecisivestep into
the fray at today's Faculty Senate meeting
as members discuss standards for diversity.
Following the lead of the California State
University Academic Senate and UCLA, the
senate will debate two resolutions question
ing the feasibility of regionally evaluating di
versity in student bodies, hiring policies and
curricula.
The issue is addressed in a policy state
ment submitted by the regional body re
sponsible for overseeing Stanford's evalua
tion, the Western Association of Schools and
Colleges.
The country's six regional accrediting
bodies are responsible both for ensuring aca
demic quality and certifying student federal
financial aid eligibility.

Calling for WASC to withdraw its "State
ment on Diversity," the Senate Steering
Committee's resolutions emphasize Univer
sity autonomy in policy-making and urge a
tougher stance against discriminatory be
havior towards gays and lesbians.
"On the one hand, WASC's statement
contains troubling language in regards to
sexual orientation," said Electrical Engi
neering Prof. Anthony Siegman. "But the
second, broader problem is whether the
statement is needed or useful."
As WASC elbows its way beyond simply
verifying standards of academic and institu
tional competence, Siegman said many feel
the regional body's statement "goes too far
. . . from what the academic accreditation
process is meant to be."
The University is "watching closely" to
make sure WASC does not overstep its
boundaries, said Geoffrey Cox, vice provost
for institutional planning. "Diver
sity shouldn't play much of a role
in the process of accrediting,
which is very different from say
ing that diversity is unimpor
tant."
Accrediting bodies have tradi
tionally focused their evaluations
on academic and institutional
standards, such as curriculum,
faculty tenure and the number of
books in an institution.
In Stanford's last evaluation,
the University volunteered to be
assessed in light of its own stan
dards for multiculturalism, Cox
said.
"Those goals arising from the
institution itself are legitimate
grounds to cover," he added. "The
great danger is imposing cookie
cutter standards across the
board."
'Far from perfect'
Beyond the statement's poten
tial threat to University autono

my in policy making, its attempt
to mollify both religious institu
tions and gay and lesbian activists
on the issue of sexual orientation
has left many dissatisfied.
"The statement does not pro
hibit but rather sanctions dis
crimination on the basis of sexual
orientation," English Prof. Ron
Rebholz said. "I find that idea
simply intolerable."
Debate centers around the
statement's assertion that an
institution can "prohibit" certain
behavior of students, faculty and
staff — making discriminatory
firing and admission policies
acceptable if they are performed
without "disrespect."
"The diversity statement
seems to say that it's all right to
fire people (based on sexual orien
tation) provided you don't do it
with any animosity," Rebholz
said, adding that the language of
the final draft was softened at the
urging of conservative religious
institutions.
But Stephen Weiner, WASC's
executive director, said he would
urge the senate not to base its
assessment of the statement's

comprehensive value on a single
point, calling the final draft "a
good-faith effort."
"My hope is that [the senate|
will recognize that the statement
reaches far beyond the issue of
sexual orientation," he said. Stan
ford might follow the CSU Aca
demic Senate's decision to accept
the final draft while registering
objections to its treatment of sexu
al orientation, Weiner suggested.
Admitting that the statement
is "far from perfect," he stressed
that "the language of the final
draft represents progress over
where we've been before. It's the
most that can be reasonably said
while at the same time respecting
the tenets of faith these institu
tions are founded upon."
Dr. Robert At well, president of
the American Council on Educa
tion and WASC evaluation team
member, also said he would "tend
to disagree with the Stanford Fac
ulty Senate's resolution."
"The statement simply says
that an institution needs to give
some attention to the issue of
diversity but doesn't say how,"
Atwell said.

Referring to the charge that
the document allows for discrimi
nation against gays and lesbian,
At well said he saw "no evidence
that that is the case. If it was it
would concern me as well."

'Stick to our own knitting'
The debate over WASC's
"Statement on Diversity" follows
on the heels of a larger battle
between the WASC and the other
five voluntary regional bodies and
the federal government. Over the

last several years, the accrediting
associations have drawn fire both
for broadening their powers and
shirking their responsibilities.
While colleges and universities
resent what they perceive as an
increase in bureaucracy and regu
lation, the federal government
has criticized the associations for
inadequacy in their cooperative
role of determining which colleges
are eligible to receive federal
financial aid for students.
Attempting to avoid further
government intervention, the six
bodies met last weekend to decide
upon a common plan of action.
The associations agreed to devel
op a new set of common standards
for accreditation, to publish insti
tutional evaluations and to gradu
ally extract themselves from the
business of certifying federal
financial aid.
"The main issue was dissolving
the accrediting associations
responsibility to serve a gate-keep
er function for federal govern
ment," said Atwell, who served as
co-chair of the conference.
"Some of us believe that it is
not appropriate to ask accrediting

bodies to monitor federal funds,"
he continued, "that we should
stick to our own knitting, which is
ensuring academic quality land]
the Feds should monitor their
own financial aid."
While Atwell said he believes the
weekend's decisions represent "a
major moment in accreditation
reform," he added that they have no
direct implications on policies like
WASC's since "the set of common
standards are as yet unspecified."
Weiner agreed the conference's
changes are a "healthy thing" for
the exploration of diversity, say
ing that setting the issue of basic
standards aside will allow region
al agencies "time to think deeply
about what quality means beyond
minimums."
It is, however, the prospect of
regional accrediting bodies with
the time and incentive to tran
scend traditional boundaries that
worries university officials across
the nation.
"Whoever undertakes the pro
cess, we feel strongly that they
should define the accrediting role
very narrowly and stick to it," Cox
said.

'Stick to our own knitting'
The debate over WASC's
"Statement on Diversity" follows
on the heels of a larger battle
between the WASC and the other
five voluntary regional bodies and
the federal government. Over the

last several years, the accrediting
associations have drawn fire both
for broadening their powers and
shirking their responsibilities.
While colleges and universities
resent what they perceive as an
increase in bureaucracy and regu
lation, the federal government
has criticized the associations for
inadequacy in their cooperative
role of determining which colleges
are eligible to receive federal
financial aid for students.
Attempting to avoid further
government intervention, the six
bodies met last weekend to decide
upon a common plan of action.
The associations agreed to devel
op a new set of common standards
for accreditation, to publish insti
tutional evaluations and to gradu
ally extract themselves from the
business of certifying federal
financial aid.
"The main issue was dissolving
the accrediting associations
responsibility to serve a gate-keep
er function for federal govern
ment," said Atwell, who served as
co-chair of the conference.
"Some of us believe that it is
not appropriate to ask accrediting

bodies to monitor federal funds,"
he continued, "that we should
stick to our own knitting, which is
ensuring academic quality land]
the Feds should monitor their
own financial aid."
While Atwell said he believes the
weekend's decisions represent "a
major moment in accreditation
reform," he added that they have no
direct implications on policies like
WASC's since "the set of common
standards are as yet unspecified."
Weiner agreed the conference's
changes are a "healthy thing" for
the exploration of diversity, say
ing that setting the issue of basic
standards aside will allow region
al agencies "time to think deeply
about what quality means beyond
minimums."
It is, however, the prospect of
regional accrediting bodies with
the time and incentive to tran
scend traditional boundaries that
worries university officials across
the nation.
"Whoever undertakes the pro
cess, we feel strongly that they
should define the accrediting role
very narrowly and stick to it," Cox
said.
While a national controversy over the ac
creditation of colleges and universities con
tinues, Stanford will takeadecisivestep into
the fray at today's Faculty Senate meeting
as members discuss standards for diversity.
Following the lead of the California State
University Academic Senate and UCLA, the
senate will debate two resolutions question
ing the feasibility of regionally evaluating di
versity in student bodies, hiring policies and
curricula.
The issue is addressed in a policy state
ment submitted by the regional body re
sponsible for overseeing Stanford's evalua
tion, the Western Association of Schools and
Colleges.
The country's six regional accrediting
bodies are responsible both for ensuring aca
demic quality and certifying student federal
financial aid eligibility.

Calling for WASC to withdraw its "State
ment on Diversity," the Senate Steering
Committee's resolutions emphasize Univer
sity autonomy in policy-making and urge a
tougher stance against discriminatory be
havior towards gays and lesbians.
"On the one hand, WASC's statement
contains troubling language in regards to
sexual orientation," said Electrical Engi
neering Prof. Anthony Siegman. "But the
second, broader problem is whether the
statement is needed or useful."
As WASC elbows its way beyond simply
verifying standards of academic and institu
tional competence, Siegman said many feel
the regional body's statement "goes too far
. . . from what the academic accreditation
process is meant to be."
The University is "watching closely" to
make sure WASC does not overstep its
boundaries, said Geoffrey Cox, vice provost
for institutional planning. "Diver
sity shouldn't play much of a role
in the process of accrediting,
which is very different from say
ing that diversity is unimpor
tant."
Accrediting bodies have tradi
tionally focused their evaluations
on academic and institutional
standards, such as curriculum,
faculty tenure and the number of
books in an institution.
In Stanford's last evaluation,
the University volunteered to be
assessed in light of its own stan
dards for multiculturalism, Cox
said.
"Those goals arising from the
institution itself are legitimate
grounds to cover," he added. "The
great danger is imposing cookie
cutter standards across the
board."
'Far from perfect'
Beyond the statement's poten
tial threat to University autono

my in policy making, its attempt
to mollify both religious institu
tions and gay and lesbian activists
on the issue of sexual orientation
has left many dissatisfied.
"The statement does not pro
hibit but rather sanctions dis
crimination on the basis of sexual
orientation," English Prof. Ron
Rebholz said. "I find that idea
simply intolerable."
Debate centers around the
statement's assertion that an
institution can "prohibit" certain
behavior of students, faculty and
staff — making discriminatory
firing and admission policies
acceptable if they are performed
without "disrespect."
"The diversity statement
seems to say that it's all right to
fire people (based on sexual orien
tation) provided you don't do it
with any animosity," Rebholz
said, adding that the language of
the final draft was softened at the
urging of conservative religious
institutions.
But Stephen Weiner, WASC's
executive director, said he would
urge the senate not to base its
assessment of the statement's

comprehensive value on a single
point, calling the final draft "a
good-faith effort."
"My hope is that [the senate|
will recognize that the statement
reaches far beyond the issue of
sexual orientation," he said. Stan
ford might follow the CSU Aca
demic Senate's decision to accept
the final draft while registering
objections to its treatment of sexu
al orientation, Weiner suggested.
Admitting that the statement
is "far from perfect," he stressed
that "the language of the final
draft represents progress over
where we've been before. It's the
most that can be reasonably said
while at the same time respecting
the tenets of faith these institu
tions are founded upon."
Dr. Robert At well, president of
the American Council on Educa
tion and WASC evaluation team
member, also said he would "tend
to disagree with the Stanford Fac
ulty Senate's resolution."
"The statement simply says
that an institution needs to give
some attention to the issue of
diversity but doesn't say how,"
Atwell said.
