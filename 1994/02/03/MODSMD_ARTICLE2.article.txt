While a national controversy over the ac
creditation of colleges and universities con
tinues, Stanford will takeadecisivestep into
the fray at today's Faculty Senate meeting
as members discuss standards for diversity.

senate will debate two resolutions question

curricula.
The issue is addressed in a policy state

Colleges.

bodies are responsible both for ensuring aca

ment on Diversity," the Senate Steering
Committee's resolutions emphasize Univer
sity autonomy in policy-making and urge a
tougher stance against discriminatory be
havior towards gays and lesbians.

contains troubling language in regards to
sexual orientation," said Electrical Engi
neering Prof. Anthony Siegman. "But the
second, broader problem is whether the
statement is needed or useful."
As WASC elbows its way beyond simply
verifying standards of academic and institu
tional competence, Siegman said many feel

. . . from what the academic accreditation
process is meant to be."
The University is "watching closely" to
make sure WASC does not overstep its
boundaries, said Geoffrey Cox, vice provost
