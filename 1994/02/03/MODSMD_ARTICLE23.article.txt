Jeremiah Tower, that cocky-looking
Bay Area chef featured on Dewar's
ads and owner of Stars, the feeding
trough for San Francisco's most chi-chi
elite, has now declared: Palo Alto is "indeed
the rising star of fine dining in areas outside
San Francisco." That's right, people, he even
used the word indeed. And he should know,
seeing that Stars is one of the top-grossing
restaurants in the United States.
I guess it was inevitable. When you pack all
the doctors from the Stanford Medical Cen
ter, the professors, the provost and Gerhard
and various trogs from the faculty ghetto, you
have a market that lusts for foiegras, balsalmic
vinegar and sun-dried tomatoes. Something
other than two cheese quesadillas and a ba
nana on a Sunday morning. Palo Alto packs
175,000 people in a three and a half mile ra
dius, not counting the famished masses
clutching wads of fifties and hundreds while
they squat in their Los Altos, Portola Valley,
Woodside, Menlo Park and Athcrton hovels.
And it's not just Tower quacking about
the P.A. scene, though he's one of the big
boys. The whole bon-appetit crowd is all a
flutter about Palo Alto. Wolfgang Puck, an

other chef turned-celebrity who got the
idea of sprinkling gourmet pizzas with top
pings like Louisiana shrimp and Cajun
sausage for the peristaltic pleasure of movie
stars in LA., also froths at the mouth to
open a restaurant at the city of the Tall Stick.
Apparently, so docs the guy who owns the
Fog City Diner (a burger joint where you
can't use the American Fxpress card. Who
pays for a burger with American Express?).
All the excitement seems to confirm ca
sual observation. It used to be all the Penin
sula gourmands could brag about was the 4-
to-1 ratio of Chinese restaurants per capita,
all with confusing names of "China "
(You fill in the blank with "Delight," "Lion,"
"Pleasure," "Flower").
Then came Gordon Biersch, with its mi
crobrewery, chic black lamps that extend 20
feet from the ceiling and deep-fried Maui
onion rings. Osteria, the tres cool and

crowded white-tablecloth Italian joint on
Hamilton, became the coveted restaurant of
the town where you had to reserve about a
quarter in advance to get rude service and a
plate of noodles. Then II Fornaio whipped
out the big guns with classy outdoor dining
decor and a partition that separates the din
ers from bohemian proletariat — such as
Stanford students. And let us not review the
litany of coffee houses and cafes that have
metastasized throughout the city.
Hven getting a bagel has gotten to become
a pain. The Bagel Works, Bagel Factory and
I loley Bagel weren't good enough, so we had
to have Noah's come in and demolish the
competition with its Semitic decor and its
decidedly liberal interpretations of bagel
preparation. The Empire Bar and Grill and
The Blue Chalk Cafe rose to fight a fierce
battle for the hearts and intestines of the
young and yuppie crowd. Mandarin

Gourmet and Ming's turned Chinese food
from a lime-green table, orange chair dining
experience into something with "ambience."
So the supposed march of evolution
sends us onward and upward. Tower plans
to open a Stars outlet on I.ytton Ave. in what
is now the Gatehouse, promising to attract
hordes of frenzied "Gourmet-reading
elites and other upscale eating ventures. But
what do we lose in this nod to the well
heeled culinary aesthetes?
What of the college traditions — the pizza
joint with poor lighting, pie-by-the-slice and
wooden tables carved by generations of col
lege students? What of places like Jing Jing's
— a.k.a. "Can We Get Some More Water,
Please?" — with its Price Club decor and food
designed to induce tearing and sweating,
where they try Lemon Chicken and Shredded
Orange Peel Beef for pennies a bite?
What of the late night greasy spoon
where students can squeeze seven people in
one booth, order chili fries and mess with
the salt shaker? All pipe dreams now. We can
hope something of the University remains
on University Avenue but they seem distant
hopes indeed. ■
