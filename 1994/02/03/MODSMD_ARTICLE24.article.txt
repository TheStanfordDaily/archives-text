# ANIMATED DELIVERANCE
## THE 						MAN WHO BROUGHT CARTOONS TO PRIME TIME 
### ED YOON 
With his faded jeans, hiking boots and a
pile of sandy hair, Dave Silverman takes a swig
at a bottle of ale and looks eminently comfort
able, approachable, and well — normal — at
the Coffee House.
Sure he was born in 1957. Sure he's a direc
tor of "The Simpsons," someone who lives in
LA. and can truly say his job pays his rent and
food, someone who hobnobs with the likes of
James Brooks and other entertainment
moguls. But somehow he effortlessly blends
in, at first glance resembling a grad student in
philosophy or English — and equally devoid
of self-importance or pretense.
Having just drawn scores of Maggies,
Marges and Barts for a rabid crowd of Simp
sons fans at Kresge Auditorium, obliging
everyone who wants a picture, Silverman is
primed for an impromptu interview before
flying back to Los Angeles to resume work on
the show. He talks quickly, popping off jokes
and scenes from various episodes, imitating
Homer, Al Facino and Edward G. Robinson,
throwing in references from films he's seen
without missing a beat.
LUORHIHG HO HOURS A WEEH
"I was drawing ever since I was a kid," says
Silverman. "I'm largely self-taught — I had
some classes but I never sat down and really
studied. I'm too impatient. I'd just rather draw
and figure it out on my own."
In high school Silverman thought he was
going to be an architect, but after a few com
mercial art classes, one of his teachers told him
to go into commercial art. He went on to win
several film contests as a teenager, one with a
pair of clay animation films entitled "A Look at
the '20s" and " The Louisiana Purchase."
After attending the University of Maryland
for two years, Silverman transferred to UCLA
to pursue clay animation wholeheartedly at
the film department, but he soon got caught
up in traditional animation. "The first class we
took was basic drawing animation, and I said,
'Wait, I can draw, I can make it move, hey, this
is neat!' And it gets into your blood."
After leaving UCLA in 1983 and bouncing
around freelance jobs for a bit, Silverman's
Jucky opportunity arrived in 1984. While at
tending another film contest Silverman met
Bill Kopp, another animator. Working togeth
er on a project, Silverman also met fellow ani
mator Wes Archer, the man who "had the con
nection with Klasky Csupo, the company that
got the Tracey Ullman contract. It was origi
nally gonna be Bill and Wes — they had
money for only two animators. But two days
into it they made this desperate call saying,
'We're gonna need your help'."
That plea sealed Silverman's fate. "We did
everything," he says. "We didn't paint the cells
but we die! all the drawing. It was like 70 hours
a week. We were working really insane hours."
But Silverman loved the freshness of the
Simpsons, a segment of "The Tracey Ullman
Show," with its radical departure from such
shows as He-Man and the Smurfs, its adult
humor and sarcastic style. Nevertheless, he ad
mits, "the first season is a vague haze to me. I

think I need a hypnotist to get it out."
"It was fun because there was no other good
animation being done. It was all trash, and we
just felt like we were doing animation our
selves, it's not going overseas and it's going on
national TV. Okay, so it's this fourth network,
but it's on prime time. It was our drawings
moving up there on prime time and when you
have that you can point to it and say, 'I did
that'."

Silverman had little time to gloat on his lau
rels, however. Recalling a scene between Bart
and Lisa where they fight over which channel
to watch on TV, one that takes less than a
minute of screen time, Silverman says,"I re
member animating that at one in the morning
after a Tracy Ullman party, the same night of
her first episode. We had four or five of these
ready, and .. .1 animated that scene until four
in the morning. I had no life."
After several seasons of this sort of dehu
manization, triumph finally arrived when
"The Simpsons" liecame an independent se
ries. Silverman recalls a meeting with lames L.
Brooks, writer, producer and director whose
credits include "Terms of Endearment" and
"I'll Do Anything." It was Brooks who helped
convince Barry Diller, chairman of the Fox
Network, to risk putting on an expensive ani
mated series about a dysfunctional family on
prime time TV.
"Jim Brooks came up to me at a party and
he said to me, 'Remember that time at one of
those Tracy Ullman parties when you came up
and introduced yourself?' He said that meet

ing convinced him that we could make an an
imated series out of this.
The rest, of course, is animation history.
"The Simpsons" has become a cult phenome
non, boasting 107 episodes as a series and still
holding its own in the ferocious Thursday
night prime time market. Throughout, it has
managed to maintain its graphic, typically-
Matt Groening visual style, irreverent humor
and unpredictable plotlines. And that's what

keeps it fresh for Silverman, even after seven
years and countless renderings of the bug
eyed and overbite-ridden Simpsons family.
"I think the show is on the edge, and from
an individual standpoint it just looks different
from everything else," he says. "It's not
grounded in the Disney, Warner Bros.,
Hanna-Barbera style of animation that every
body tries to ape to some extent. The thing
that makes it so difficult for our animators is
that it doesn't follow the same conventions
that those styles do.
"As far as the humor goes what I like about
it is that it's very sarcastic and there's a lot of
dark humor, but when we have something
with heart in it — like when we show they ac
tually love each other — it's cliche, but because
it's so dark all the way through, it's a lot of light
at the end of the tunnel."
EfTIPH/ISIZinG THE STORV
Silverman anticipates some changes. "The
stories are going to flesh out more," he says,
and it appears Silverman is a firm believer in
the art of storytelling. "Now it's just gag, gag,

gag. Storytelling makes the gags work better."
He also promises episodes featuring an Itchy
and Scratchy Land amusement park and an
other with "A Clockwork Orange" theme.
Having helped nurse "The Simpsons" from
its infancy to its current maturity, Silverman
finds himself overseeing and guiding the vari
ous directors and artists assigned to work on
the show.
A typical day for Silverman will include
going over a storyboard with one director,
working with a layout artist on another
episode, watching a color screening late at
night, or attending a read-through of a story to
get a sense of the show.
Like a teaching assistant, Silverman is the
answer-man for tips on how to direct a diffi
cult scene, how to direct the action simply and
most effectively and how to instruct layout
artists to convey a certain mood, pose or feel
ing. Then there are instructions on how the
camera moves, the point of view of the cam
era, the blocking of the "actors," the staging,
the transitions and the timing. And some
times Silverman will have to step in, pen in
hand, because he's the only one who can ani
mate the scene.
Somehow, with a staff of fifteen writers and
dozens of layout artists, storyboarders and
others, the process of telling funny stories
never seems to grow stale. "Everyday is differ
ent," he says. "It's always fresh. That's the trick
of it. You gotta keep it funny. Animation is less
spontaneous than film. Animation is like
.00001 percent inspiration compared to the
perspiration. Execution is just so much slower
compared with an actor or director of live ac
tion, but when 1 hold the 'X' sheets [sheets that
contain frame by frame direction of drawings]
1 see the action in my head."
The future seems to bode well for Silver
man — he's had several offers to direct live ac
tion features as well as animated features,
though he's understandably reticent in dis
cussing them. He's directing less now — "if 1
direct an episode next season, it'll be at the end
of the season, show twenty-two or something"
— but he might be doing more with other spe
cial projects.
Silverman plans to stick to a personal style
of sarcastic humor and fantasy. Uninterested
in moody action-animation like the "Batman"
series, he says that "1 would do something fan
ciful, something with humor, something with
heart. And something with fantasy. I do like
fantasy," he says. With a wide, loopy grin he
says,"I like big sets and funny effects." Then
instantly straightening up and serious: "But
I'd like it to mean something, because if it
doesn't mean anything, nobody cares. You
spend all that cash on some scene and the au
dience goes...
Silverman lets out a long, coma-inducing
yawn, the kind that seizes those within the film
and television industry with numbing dread,
the kind that sends shows to the film morgue
and execs running for cover. But it's unlikely
Silverman, with his rollicking sense of humor
and taste for the experimental and the absurd,
will be putting anybody to sleep soon. ■

but it's on prime time. It was our drawings
moving up there on prime time and when you
have that you can point to it and say, 'I did
that'."

Silverman had little time to gloat on his lau
rels, however. Recalling a scene between Bart
and Lisa where they fight over which channel
to watch on TV, one that takes less than a
minute of screen time, Silverman says,"I re
member animating that at one in the morning
after a Tracy Ullman party, the same night of
her first episode. We had four or five of these
ready, and .. .1 animated that scene until four
in the morning. I had no life."
After several seasons of this sort of dehu
manization, triumph finally arrived when
"The Simpsons" liecame an independent se
ries. Silverman recalls a meeting with lames L.
Brooks, writer, producer and director whose
credits include "Terms of Endearment" and
"I'll Do Anything." It was Brooks who helped
convince Barry Diller, chairman of the Fox
Network, to risk putting on an expensive ani
mated series about a dysfunctional family on
prime time TV.
"Jim Brooks came up to me at a party and
he said to me, 'Remember that time at one of
those Tracy Ullman parties when you came up
and introduced yourself?' He said that meet

ing convinced him that we could make an an
imated series out of this.
The rest, of course, is animation history.
"The Simpsons" has become a cult phenome
non, boasting 107 episodes as a series and still
holding its own in the ferocious Thursday
night prime time market. Throughout, it has
managed to maintain its graphic, typically-
Matt Groening visual style, irreverent humor
and unpredictable plotlines. And that's what

keeps it fresh for Silverman, even after seven
years and countless renderings of the bug
eyed and overbite-ridden Simpsons family.
"I think the show is on the edge, and from
an individual standpoint it just looks different
from everything else," he says. "It's not
grounded in the Disney, Warner Bros.,
Hanna-Barbera style of animation that every
body tries to ape to some extent. The thing
that makes it so difficult for our animators is
that it doesn't follow the same conventions
that those styles do.
"As far as the humor goes what I like about
it is that it's very sarcastic and there's a lot of
dark humor, but when we have something
with heart in it — like when we show they ac
tually love each other — it's cliche, but because
it's so dark all the way through, it's a lot of light
at the end of the tunnel."
EfTIPH/ISIZinG THE STORV
Silverman anticipates some changes. "The
stories are going to flesh out more," he says,
and it appears Silverman is a firm believer in
the art of storytelling. "Now it's just gag, gag,

gag. Storytelling makes the gags work better."
He also promises episodes featuring an Itchy
and Scratchy Land amusement park and an
other with "A Clockwork Orange" theme.
Having helped nurse "The Simpsons" from
its infancy to its current maturity, Silverman
finds himself overseeing and guiding the vari
ous directors and artists assigned to work on
the show.
A typical day for Silverman will include
going over a storyboard with one director,
working with a layout artist on another
episode, watching a color screening late at
night, or attending a read-through of a story to
get a sense of the show.
Like a teaching assistant, Silverman is the
answer-man for tips on how to direct a diffi
cult scene, how to direct the action simply and
most effectively and how to instruct layout
artists to convey a certain mood, pose or feel
ing. Then there are instructions on how the
camera moves, the point of view of the cam
era, the blocking of the "actors," the staging,
the transitions and the timing. And some
times Silverman will have to step in, pen in
hand, because he's the only one who can ani
mate the scene.
Somehow, with a staff of fifteen writers and
dozens of layout artists, storyboarders and
others, the process of telling funny stories
never seems to grow stale. "Everyday is differ
ent," he says. "It's always fresh. That's the trick
of it. You gotta keep it funny. Animation is less
spontaneous than film. Animation is like
.00001 percent inspiration compared to the
perspiration. Execution is just so much slower
compared with an actor or director of live ac
tion, but when 1 hold the 'X' sheets [sheets that
contain frame by frame direction of drawings]
1 see the action in my head."
The future seems to bode well for Silver
man — he's had several offers to direct live ac
tion features as well as animated features,
though he's understandably reticent in dis
cussing them. He's directing less now — "if 1
direct an episode next season, it'll be at the end
of the season, show twenty-two or something"
— but he might be doing more with other spe
cial projects.
Silverman plans to stick to a personal style
of sarcastic humor and fantasy. Uninterested
in moody action-animation like the "Batman"
series, he says that "1 would do something fan
ciful, something with humor, something with
heart. And something with fantasy. I do like
fantasy," he says. With a wide, loopy grin he
says,"I like big sets and funny effects." Then
instantly straightening up and serious: "But
I'd like it to mean something, because if it
doesn't mean anything, nobody cares. You
spend all that cash on some scene and the au
dience goes...
Silverman lets out a long, coma-inducing
yawn, the kind that seizes those within the film
and television industry with numbing dread,
the kind that sends shows to the film morgue
and execs running for cover. But it's unlikely
Silverman, with his rollicking sense of humor
and taste for the experimental and the absurd,
will be putting anybody to sleep soon. ■

With his faded jeans, hiking boots and a
pile of sandy hair, Dave Silverman takes a swig
at a bottle of ale and looks eminently comfort
able, approachable, and well — normal — at
the Coffee House.
Sure he was born in 1957. Sure he's a direc
tor of "The Simpsons," someone who lives in
LA. and can truly say his job pays his rent and
food, someone who hobnobs with the likes of
James Brooks and other entertainment
moguls. But somehow he effortlessly blends
in, at first glance resembling a grad student in
philosophy or English — and equally devoid
of self-importance or pretense.
Having just drawn scores of Maggies,
Marges and Barts for a rabid crowd of Simp
sons fans at Kresge Auditorium, obliging
everyone who wants a picture, Silverman is
primed for an impromptu interview before
flying back to Los Angeles to resume work on
the show. He talks quickly, popping off jokes
and scenes from various episodes, imitating
Homer, Al Facino and Edward G. Robinson,
throwing in references from films he's seen
without missing a beat.
LUORHIHG HO HOURS A WEEH
"I was drawing ever since I was a kid," says
Silverman. "I'm largely self-taught — I had
some classes but I never sat down and really
studied. I'm too impatient. I'd just rather draw
and figure it out on my own."
In high school Silverman thought he was
going to be an architect, but after a few com
mercial art classes, one of his teachers told him
to go into commercial art. He went on to win
several film contests as a teenager, one with a
pair of clay animation films entitled "A Look at
the '20s" and " The Louisiana Purchase."
After attending the University of Maryland
for two years, Silverman transferred to UCLA
to pursue clay animation wholeheartedly at
the film department, but he soon got caught
up in traditional animation. "The first class we
took was basic drawing animation, and I said,
'Wait, I can draw, I can make it move, hey, this
is neat!' And it gets into your blood."
After leaving UCLA in 1983 and bouncing
around freelance jobs for a bit, Silverman's
Jucky opportunity arrived in 1984. While at
tending another film contest Silverman met
Bill Kopp, another animator. Working togeth
er on a project, Silverman also met fellow ani
mator Wes Archer, the man who "had the con
nection with Klasky Csupo, the company that
got the Tracey Ullman contract. It was origi
nally gonna be Bill and Wes — they had
money for only two animators. But two days
into it they made this desperate call saying,
'We're gonna need your help'."
That plea sealed Silverman's fate. "We did
everything," he says. "We didn't paint the cells
but we die! all the drawing. It was like 70 hours
a week. We were working really insane hours."
But Silverman loved the freshness of the
Simpsons, a segment of "The Tracey Ullman
Show," with its radical departure from such
shows as He-Man and the Smurfs, its adult
humor and sarcastic style. Nevertheless, he ad
mits, "the first season is a vague haze to me. I

think I need a hypnotist to get it out."
"It was fun because there was no other good
animation being done. It was all trash, and we
just felt like we were doing animation our
selves, it's not going overseas and it's going on
national TV. Okay, so it's this fourth network,
but it's on prime time. It was our drawings

answer-man for tips on how to direct a diffi
cult scene, how to direct the action simply and
most effectively and how to instruct layout
artists to convey a certain mood, pose or feel
ing. Then there are instructions on how the
camera moves, the point of view of the cam
era, the blocking of the "actors," the staging,
the transitions and the timing. And some
times Silverman will have to step in, pen in
hand, because he's the only one who can ani
mate the scene.
Somehow, with a staff of fifteen writers and
dozens of layout artists, storyboarders and
others, the process of telling funny stories
never seems to grow stale. "Everyday is differ
ent," he says. "It's always fresh. That's the trick
of it. You gotta keep it funny. Animation is less
spontaneous than film. Animation is like
.00001 percent inspiration compared to the
perspiration. Execution is just so much slower
compared with an actor or director of live ac
tion, but when 1 hold the 'X' sheets [sheets that
contain frame by frame direction of drawings]
1 see the action in my head."
The future seems to bode well for Silver
man — he's had several offers to direct live ac
tion features as well as animated features,
though he's understandably reticent in dis
cussing them. He's directing less now — "if 1
direct an episode next season, it'll be at the end
of the season, show twenty-two or something"
— but he might be doing more with other spe
cial projects.
Silverman plans to stick to a personal style
of sarcastic humor and fantasy. Uninterested
in moody action-animation like the "Batman"
series, he says that "1 would do something fan
ciful, something with humor, something with
heart. And something with fantasy. I do like
fantasy," he says. With a wide, loopy grin he
says,"I like big sets and funny effects." Then
instantly straightening up and serious: "But
I'd like it to mean something, because if it
doesn't mean anything, nobody cares. You
spend all that cash on some scene and the au
dience goes...
Silverman lets out a long, coma-inducing
yawn, the kind that seizes those within the film
and television industry with numbing dread,
the kind that sends shows to the film morgue
and execs running for cover. But it's unlikely
Silverman, with his rollicking sense of humor
and taste for the experimental and the absurd,
will be putting anybody to sleep soon. ■
