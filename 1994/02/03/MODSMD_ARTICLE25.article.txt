# Alternative Beckett
## Four Plays on Two Stages 
### Marine Berringer 
Samui I Bet ki 1 1 is difficult to understand,
some claim, and the directors of the
Drama Department's cutting-edge
production of four of his short plays, two for
the stage and two for radio, do not argue. In
fact, they openly admit it.
"Most people who see, and even do Beck
ett don't understand him," claimed lan Mc-
Crudden. "Beckett On Stage," a coupling of
two of Beckett's playlets for the stage, "Not 1"
and "Krapp's Last Tape," is currently under
McCrudden's direction. The complement
ing couple consists of "Cascando" and
"Radio I," directed by Volker Schachenmeyr
and combined under the title "Beckett On
Air." The two, "Air" and "Stage," can be com
bined into one evening of theater or taken in
separately.
"Beckett is wrought with philosophical
questions, and if those don't interest you,
Beckett might not interest you," McCrudden
said. "It's not just for entertainment."
Better known for earlier works such as
"Endgame" and "Waiting for Godot," Beck
ett's work has generally been classified as
Theater of the Absurd, but even this term de
fies definition. One certainty of all his works,
however: do not expect a plot. And if there is
one, it's not important.
Beckett writes "non-narrative, non-plot
oriented situations," explains Schachenmeyr.
His goal, unlike McCrudden, does seem to be
entertainment. "Fven if people don't under
stand, they have a sight and sound experi
ence — purely sensory." In his presentation,
sound in particular is the dominating force.
Indeed, when Beckett wrote the plays for the
radio, sound was meant to be the only force.

McCrudden and Schachenmeyr seem to
be approaching their similar works from op
posite ends of the philosophical spectrum.
McCrudden, a Modern Thought and Litera
ture major, designed his production as part
of his senior thesis project with considerable
support from the Drama Department.
" They had the two projects which com
plemented each other — not necessarily aes
thetically, but in theory, maybe," McCrudden

hypothesized.
McCrudden became interested in Bcckett
as a freshman. He so frustrated his Resident
Assistant ("She couldn't stand mc — the
loud music, walking around naked...," heex-

plains) that she went
to the Dean of Un
dergraduate Hous
ing.
The Dean called
McCrudden's Resi
dent Fellow, who ex
plained the situation
to him, then proceed
ed to take McCrud
den for a walk. "He
gave me 'Murphy,'
Beckett's first novel
— I don't know why,
exactly." After that,
McCrudden began to
read more and more
of his plays, poetry
and prose. Finally,
after taking a class it
just "clicked."
As a Modern
Thought and Litera-

ture major, McCrudden is not required to do
the shows, only a thesis paper. 1 le decided on
the project as a means to demonstrate his un
derstanding, his status as a "learned reader of
Beckett," as he puts it.
"The best way to show understanding is
through action, in performance. I'm inter
ested in the relationship of these works
with his later prose — why he went to the
stage."
McCrudden originally constructed the
project last year when studying at the Samuel
Beckett Center for Theatre Studies at Trinity
College in Dublin, Ireland, where Beckett
studied. When the one-act play ("Night
Baseball," written by student Gabe Tissian)
that he was directing went on to win the New
York Playwright's Festival Award last year,
however, he was forced to put the project on
hold.
"It's hard as [an undergrad] to get support
like the |Drama) department has given me.

Charles Lyons, my thesis advisor, was very
excited by the project. [He] has been a men
tor to mc," McCrudden said, and went on to
explain how others' confidence in you gives
you confidence in yourself.

Perhaps because
of his academic
study of Beckett,
McCrudden can
seem pretentious in
his assertions of "un
derstanding Beck
ctt." His dedication
and passion for the
works manifests it
self when he speaks
of them. It seem as if,
to him, the only real
theater is Beckett
theater.
Any explanation
of the playlets being
produced would be
beyond vain. When
trying to describe
how the two,
"Krapp's Last Tape"
and "Not 1," are re-

lated, there is a strong bond. Both plays
demonstrate the limits of constructing one's
own identity through narrative.
"You can never tell the same story twice,"
McCrudden said. "You can never get at who
you were because you are unsure of what you
are now."
TllAl's ENURIAiNIVUfNI
Volker Schachenmeyr, a second year grad
uate student, has been interested in non-tra
ditional theater for quite a while. "Fascist
aesthetics, cathedral-like performance space,
animation, contemporary opera — specta
cle." This is how he describes his preferences
in theater. Theater of the Absurd could defi
nitely fit this bill.
His interest in Beckett, and in particular
the radio plays "Radio I" and "Cascando,"
stems from the "sense of people struggling to
locate themselves," he claims. "I liked the
idea of one character [ in "Cascando"] deal

ing with sound — music and voice. The
story she hears is a beautiful poem.
"It points out one of the most attractive
features of Beckett."
Born in Ireland, Beckett voluntarily be
came an "expatriate" in Paris, alternating his
writing between French and English, but al
most always translating to the other language
afterward. Both plays in "Beckett on Air"
were originally written in French: "Radio I"
in 1961 and "Cascando" the year after. While
"Cascando" was translated (by Beckett) to
English and broadcast on the BBC almost
immediately after it was written, "Radio I"
was not published in English until 1976
(Beckett's attitude was that it had been su
perseded by "Cascando").
Schachenmeyr has found the production
an interesting experiment in sound, partic
ularly due to the large array of modern
sound editing devices available to him, as
well as the assistance of sound composer
Marco Trevisano of the Center for Comput
er Research in Music and Acoustics
(CCRMA).
Schachenmeyr's innovative approach
could be termed interactive, or even virtual
theater. Working with plays which were
originally meant to be heard and not seen,
he has attempted to create a medium in
which Beckett's world is suggested, while
not inhibiting the mind to create its own
perception. In a radio play, he explains, the
mind can go as far as the imagination can
take it. You arc not bounded by visual lim
itations. By creating a limited, stimulating
visual environment, Schachenmeyr seeks
to send the mind above and beyond that
limit.
"We're looking for people who are ad
venturous, people who arc looking for a
new theater experience," he said. "Maybe
they're bored with traditional theater,
they're looking to stretch the boundaries of
perception."
Both directors seem to agree on this idea.
Their audiences will be questioning and
open-minded, above all else. Who cares if
there is no plot, right? We're above all that.

questions, and if those don't interest you,
Beckett might not interest you," McCrudden
said. "It's not just for entertainment."
Better known for earlier works such as
"Endgame" and "Waiting for Godot," Beck
ett's work has generally been classified as
Theater of the Absurd, but even this term de
fies definition. One certainty of all his works,
however: do not expect a plot. And if there is
one, it's not important.
Beckett writes "non-narrative, non-plot
oriented situations," explains Schachenmeyr.
His goal, unlike McCrudden, does seem to be
entertainment. "Fven if people don't under
stand, they have a sight and sound experi
ence — purely sensory." In his presentation,
sound in particular is the dominating force.
Indeed, when Beckett wrote the plays for the
radio, sound was meant to be the only force.

McCrudden and Schachenmeyr seem to
be approaching their similar works from op
posite ends of the philosophical spectrum.
McCrudden, a Modern Thought and Litera
ture major, designed his production as part
of his senior thesis project with considerable
support from the Drama Department.
" They had the two projects which com
plemented each other — not necessarily aes
thetically, but in theory, maybe," McCrudden

hypothesized.
McCrudden became interested in Bcckett
as a freshman. He so frustrated his Resident
Assistant ("She couldn't stand mc — the
loud music, walking around naked...," heex-

plains) that she went
to the Dean of Un
dergraduate Hous
ing.
The Dean called
McCrudden's Resi
dent Fellow, who ex
plained the situation
to him, then proceed
ed to take McCrud
den for a walk. "He
gave me 'Murphy,'
Beckett's first novel
— I don't know why,
exactly." After that,
McCrudden began to
read more and more
of his plays, poetry
and prose. Finally,
after taking a class it
just "clicked."
As a Modern
Thought and Litera-

ture major, McCrudden is not required to do
the shows, only a thesis paper. 1 le decided on
the project as a means to demonstrate his un
derstanding, his status as a "learned reader of
Beckett," as he puts it.
"The best way to show understanding is
through action, in performance. I'm inter
ested in the relationship of these works
with his later prose — why he went to the
stage."
McCrudden originally constructed the
project last year when studying at the Samuel
Beckett Center for Theatre Studies at Trinity
College in Dublin, Ireland, where Beckett
studied. When the one-act play ("Night
Baseball," written by student Gabe Tissian)
that he was directing went on to win the New
York Playwright's Festival Award last year,
however, he was forced to put the project on
hold.
"It's hard as [an undergrad] to get support
like the |Drama) department has given me.

Charles Lyons, my thesis advisor, was very
excited by the project. [He] has been a men
tor to mc," McCrudden said, and went on to
explain how others' confidence in you gives
you confidence in yourself.

Perhaps because
of his academic
study of Beckett,
McCrudden can
seem pretentious in
his assertions of "un
derstanding Beck
ctt." His dedication
and passion for the
works manifests it
self when he speaks
of them. It seem as if,
to him, the only real
theater is Beckett
theater.
Any explanation
of the playlets being
produced would be
beyond vain. When
trying to describe
how the two,
"Krapp's Last Tape"
and "Not 1," are re-

lated, there is a strong bond. Both plays
demonstrate the limits of constructing one's
own identity through narrative.
"You can never tell the same story twice,"
McCrudden said. "You can never get at who
you were because you are unsure of what you
are now."
TllAl's ENURIAiNIVUfNI
Volker Schachenmeyr, a second year grad
uate student, has been interested in non-tra
ditional theater for quite a while. "Fascist
aesthetics, cathedral-like performance space,
animation, contemporary opera — specta
cle." This is how he describes his preferences
in theater. Theater of the Absurd could defi
nitely fit this bill.
His interest in Beckett, and in particular
the radio plays "Radio I" and "Cascando,"
stems from the "sense of people struggling to
locate themselves," he claims. "I liked the
idea of one character [ in "Cascando"] deal

ing with sound — music and voice. The
story she hears is a beautiful poem.
"It points out one of the most attractive
features of Beckett."
Born in Ireland, Beckett voluntarily be
came an "expatriate" in Paris, alternating his
writing between French and English, but al
most always translating to the other language
afterward. Both plays in "Beckett on Air"
were originally written in French: "Radio I"
in 1961 and "Cascando" the year after. While
"Cascando" was translated (by Beckett) to
English and broadcast on the BBC almost
immediately after it was written, "Radio I"
was not published in English until 1976
(Beckett's attitude was that it had been su
perseded by "Cascando").
Schachenmeyr has found the production
an interesting experiment in sound, partic
ularly due to the large array of modern
sound editing devices available to him, as
well as the assistance of sound composer
Marco Trevisano of the Center for Comput
er Research in Music and Acoustics
(CCRMA).
Schachenmeyr's innovative approach
could be termed interactive, or even virtual
theater. Working with plays which were
originally meant to be heard and not seen,
he has attempted to create a medium in
which Beckett's world is suggested, while
not inhibiting the mind to create its own
perception. In a radio play, he explains, the
mind can go as far as the imagination can
take it. You arc not bounded by visual lim
itations. By creating a limited, stimulating
visual environment, Schachenmeyr seeks
to send the mind above and beyond that
limit.
"We're looking for people who are ad
venturous, people who arc looking for a
new theater experience," he said. "Maybe
they're bored with traditional theater,
they're looking to stretch the boundaries of
perception."
Both directors seem to agree on this idea.
Their audiences will be questioning and
open-minded, above all else. Who cares if
there is no plot, right? We're above all that.

Samui I Bet ki 1 1 is difficult to understand,
some claim, and the directors of the
Drama Department's cutting-edge
production of four of his short plays, two for
the stage and two for radio, do not argue. In
fact, they openly admit it.
"Most people who see, and even do Beck
ett don't understand him," claimed lan Mc-
Crudden. "Beckett On Stage," a coupling of
two of Beckett's playlets for the stage, "Not 1"
and "Krapp's Last Tape," is currently under
McCrudden's direction. The complement
ing couple consists of "Cascando" and
"Radio I," directed by Volker Schachenmeyr
and combined under the title "Beckett On
Air." The two, "Air" and "Stage," can be com
bined into one evening of theater or taken in
separately.

questions, and if those don't interest you,
Beckett might not interest you," McCrudden
said. "It's not just for entertainment."
