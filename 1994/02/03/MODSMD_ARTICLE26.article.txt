## music of the mind: the ingredients of the Soup 
### 
Not long ago, on a crisp Friday night in
January, a jazz septet with verve to
spare played a small East Bay club with
the ambiance of a black hole and a dinky audi
ence at least as dense. Someone must have told
the motley assembly of Cal-types, knotty
dreds, squares, and long-haired-Birkenstalk
ers, etc. that local jazz was a San Francisco
thing, that only a City crowd can cope with the
Bay Area's own private jazz scene.
And sho' 'nuff, the jazzified outfit — con
sidered by Bay Area rags like the Bay
Guardian, SF Weekly and the Chronicle's
Datebook to be a product of the Frisco scene
— admitted after playing a two-set show, that
the Berkeley session was a first... even though
several band members live but a stone's throw
away. But whose complaining other than the
writer? The septet, Alphabet Soup, played as if
Death had the next move in the chess game;
and the crowd, occasionally ditching weaker
amusements (reading, billiards and idle chat
ter) for the Soup's melodic chronic, dug the ef
fort too — like an old Blue Note side.
Still, you've got to wonder about a band,
that within a year of its founding, generated
enough talk to get invited to not only San
Francisco's increasingly prestigious jazz festi
val but Monterey's as well. On one level, the
Soup, devoted to a vein of musical expression
that morphs traditional elements of improv
with urban poetry, is normally up for whatev
er, believes vocalist Chris Burger. "We're down
to make fat music and to be conscious and
spread consciousness — not only musically
but by the power of word."
Then there's the realist approach taken by
band manager Gary: "Fuckin' B-Town — it's
nastiness. It's the first time we've taken this lit
tle [money] in...Not surprisingly the ma
jority of Burger's band mates identify with his
"art first" philosophy, leaving Gary to deal
with the business end all by his lonesome. And
that's probably a good thing. Not forgetting
Burger, Alphabet Soup is Kenny Brooks on
tenor sax, Sam Biggers on bass, Mike Blake on
vocals, Wilbur Crebs on double bass, Dredd
Scott on key boards and Jay Lane on drums,
the only member unable to attend the Berke
ley show. Lane, as are most of his band mates,
Brooks explains, are rarely into one thing at a
time. Just ask Crebs, jives Gary. He explains
that the bassist only just returned from a
recording session with Willie Nelson out of
state.
As the Soup has caught on though, its
members have scaled back their other activi
ties to concentrate on making the group the
best it can be. On an independently distrib
uted recording entitled "Up & Down Club
Sessions" (named for the San Francisco club
where the Soup and other major local bands
often kick funky grooves for City crowds) for

instance, members
Lane and Brooks
not only record two
tunes with the band
("The Music in My
Head" and "Up &
Down," or "Walkin'
Roots"), but also
hold key personnel
positions on several
other tracks as well.
"It's kind of
cool," believes Blake
(Da Mic for short),
"because we've all
had our opportuni
ties to set our own
paths in our own
ways and then come
back. Like I did a lot
of poetry. I was a
spoken word poet
and an actor and
shit. Then 1 got into
music... since then
shit has just mani
fested itself. People
[in the Soup] got
their own experi
ences academically
and musically that
have brought them
to this point. We're
everywhere from
Stravinsky to John
Coltrane, to Willie
Nelson to Miles

Davis to KRS-One. We're all of that. Quincy
Jones, Herbie Hancock, Guru."
He's not kidding either. Their sets are a wild
roller coaster ride made up of improvised riffs
strung together by musical phrases taken liter
ally from everyone Blake mentioned. In one
tune ("Walkin' Roots") Brooks, a straight
ahead jazz man trained at the New England
Conservatory of Music and Scott, a versatile
keyman with grungy panache, traded fours on
an old Charlie Parker riff that evolved into a
five-minute Bob James-esque solo for the
nonchalant musician. Cooler than a frozen
cucumber, Scott spits outs chords between
swigs of Corona Extra and Cheetos with the
barely perceivable precision of a humming
bird. Yep, kids he's that good.
Now imagine Burger's and Blaze's voices
dancing in and around these same melodies
with the randomness of a six-year-old ballet
dancer keyed-out on sugar and wearing her
best tutu. Pure madness.
"I trip sometimes on like how [Scott,
Brooks and Co.] hear the space," exclaims
Blake, his eyes a twinkle," 'cause sometimes 1
just make a slight reference to something in

the lyric (and I do a lot of freestyling), a slight
reference, and know I'm coming back on the
four, and everybody will like hear it. And I just
know that I can go into the change and every
one locks up ... and that's the math, that's the
math."
Well, part of it anyway. The other part re
sides in the rhythm section, layed down com
petently by the Soup's rhythm section Biggers
and Crebs. Perhaps the band's most mellow
members, moments after the show, Biggers
stole away to a corner back stage to catch zees,
while Crebs just sort of dissolved into thin

of the rhythm
gents give
them a

air. Comfortable in their roles as the
bands rhythm pillars, they plant

themselves in a comfortable posi
tion on stage and catch root while

Brooks, Blaze and Burger flutter
around the stage like a cloud of
pollen. It's an interesting dy-

namic to watch, because Big
gers and Crebs are slightly
older than their band mates —

as if their dress and nonchalant
demeanors don't suggest other

wise. Next to the dredded heads of

Blaze and Burger and the baseball
capped Brooks, who all dress in

baggies, sneakers and the
likes, the conservative,
down sensible garb

down
right squar
ish appeal.
Still take them out

of the Soup and the "pocket jazz" vanishes.
What's pocket jazz?
Practically every member of the hand has
an answer to that question.
"It's jazz that sits in the pocket," claims
Brooks.
Blaze thinks it's because the music "sinks
up ... because the math is always there. Re
gardless of how abstract the shit gets."
Crebs feels it's a matter of "control."
But Biggers is the most succinct. "Because
the groove is always in the pocket. We always
try to keep it in the pocket, so it's tight, so that
there's a nice foundation where everybody can
just sit in a big fat groove and enjoy the music."

Biggers statement does an adequate job
)f prefacing the'story of the band's

naming not to mention the under
lining concepts that define it.

But typical of Soup style,
his band mates have

his back to make

things lucid,
It was

Gary,
th e
band's man-

ager, who start
ed the Soup cook

ing. "He was the mas
termind behind the entire
idea in the first place," claims

roommate Brooks. While gigs for
his roommate and Shane, he got the

bright idea to take it a little further. "We
were doing trio gigs with another bass play
er at these hip-hop gigs,' remembers Brooks.
"We'd play like a jazz set, trio set and then the
DJ would come 0ut.... It was live, ya know,
people were really into that, so we just decid
ed to extend it, to just add some rappers. And
so initially we were doing some gigs with just
drums and bass, upright bass and a horn and
two rappers. And then, stuff happened and it
just kinda evolved into what it is now — over
time."
After the permanent gig began to feel right,
Brooks and Co. sought inspiration in an un

likely place: a multi-ethnic cartoon broadcast
on the local Public Broadcasting System sta
tion, KQEL). It was something "Soup," and be
cause "Alphabet Soup" sounded as good as
any other, they kept it.
"It was actually 'Vegetable Soup,"' remem
bers Brooks, "but we couldn't remember it
then .... And then later after we had played a
couple of gigs, we were like 'Yeah, Alphabet
Soup.' Then someone came over and we were
talking about it. And they were like, 'Ah

yeah, that shit was Vegetable Soup wasn't
it.' But we weren't going to change the

name at that point. But that car

toon was like a multiracial, edu
cational cartoon and that was
like part of it. So it really fit in

many different ways. The
Concept of Alphabet
Soup, you know what I'm
saying."

Still the elaboration
continues. "As opposed to
a melting pot," muses
Blake, "we think of a stew
— healthy ingredients,
hella vegetables, hella nu-

trients. And you can
taste them all."

Taking the
metaphor
to

bers and
in -

new
heights,

Butler
likens their

musicianship and

performances to the
stock ingredients of

soup and their audiences to
the broth. "We're the stock,

we're where it starts and spreads

out. You always start a soup with the

stock. The audience becomes broth if
they're involved. If not, they're just water

— water with no flavor."
And the soup keeps expanding and ex
panding (even on that bitter Friday night in
Berkeley). Months ago, Scott boasted in a SF
Weekly feature that the band barely knew each
other, and that in most cases, their gigs dou
bled as rehersals. It's likely that today he'd sing
the same song. But Scott, barring the times
when he churns chords of all flavor on-stage,
remains elusive for most of the actual inter
view. Brooks, when approached, however,
about the same subject has plenty to say.
"We've played so much together now that
I mean It's improvising, but it's on structures
. . . Ya know, somebody might right a little
thing and we'll just play it right on the spot...
. Do whatever to it — create arrangements on
the spot."
Opposed to forcing its musical expression,
however, the Soup are great endorsers of the
"Roll With it Baby" school of hard improv,
and things just seem to workout in most in
stances.
"Not to get all cosmic and shit," confides
Bla/e, "but we really know what we want hear,
and someone will play it. It's really like that.
It's like musician is playing. He may hear

something, and once he hears it, he plays the
notes so until everybody else picks that shit
up. It's just there ..."
It's gotten them at least as far

as Monterey, which
Butler remem-

credi
ble experience

and honor, even though the

band was forced to play short set. They're
used to 90 minutes on stage, the kind folks at
Monterey offered them 40 minutes of instant
fame — and shortly after, a tlock of record
deal pitches from the likes of Island and live.
Brooks remembers the Jive deal with particu
lar relish. "We could have had an eight record
deal, I mean it was really real. But that was sort
of a scary option fro all of these guys .... You
know the control factor....
"What happens when you sign a contract
like that, it can get really ugly. So, we just
wanted to remain in control lor a little while
longer, because we recognize how big it could

become. And, I mean, right now we're doing
fine as it is. Ya know, we're just enjoying the

music and just trying to
get it out there."
So the

Soup de
cided
to

run
with a

very flex
ible deal

from local in
dependent,
Prawn Song, Primus

bassist l.es Claypool's
label. It only binds the

group for one album and offers

solid distribution through Mam
moth, a subsidiary of Atlantic Records. So
even if the big-budgeted record may not be
the best thing for the immediate futureof the
band, they'll never feel as if it isn't an eventu
al option.
"It's gonna be small," confirms Brooks,
"low budget, but really true to the music. It's
not gonna be really highly produced, which
is one thing we thought about. We could
spend a lot of money to make a really 'radio'
record."
But why bother when pop isn't the slot of
choice.

Alphabet Soup will perform at the Coffee House
on Feb. 11 at Vp. rn. The (Concert is sponsored by
The Stanford Concert Network in association
with the 1994 "You Can Make A Difference
Conference."
