# Living in a dream world
## Story of The Accompanist' lacks historical reality 
### 
The murky line between passion and ob
session is further blurred in "The Accompa
nist," the latest in a string of recent French
films about beautiful, tormented people in the
world of classical music.
The German occupation of Paris in 1942
provides the rather flimsy backdrop for this
otherwise compelling psychological study ot
two women — an opera singer and her young
accompagnat rice.
When shy, gifted pianist Sophie Vasseur au
ditions for the feted diva Irene Brice, it's
I amour at first sight. And who can blame So
phie for adoring Irene? She's everything So
phie's not: beautiful, vivacious, elegant,
worldly and immensely wealthy. Irene is a gen
uinely nice person and a dedicated artist — an
altogether seductive combination.
"I know,"says Irene, by way of introduc
tion. "I'm very lucky." Speechless, Sophie kiss
es her upturned palm.
From her assigned place in Irene's slim
shadow, Sophie is the silent witness to a sym
phony of political and romantic intrigues.
"Secrets are a luxury," she says, and she can't
resist making Irene's many secrets her own.
Nor can Sophie resist the double-edged
sword of dazzle and drudgery that Irene offers
— a glittering social whirl that takes her from
slurping oysters in salons and kissing exotic
strangers on trains to delivering Irene's love
letters, doing Irene's ironing, reverently ac
cepting Irene's cast-off clothes and flowers.
Sophie wants nothing more than "to be in
dispensable to her — irreplaceable." But it be
comes increasingly, tragically clear that al
though Irene thrives on attention, she doesn't

much care where it comes from. She's a jalousc
mistress, and a fickle one.
It's a delicate balance, deiicately enacted by
the radiant Russian-born actress Elena Sa
fonova. As Sophie, Romane Bohringer re
sponds with a wide-eyed gaze that is simulta
neously frightened and hypnotized, enam
ored and indignant.
Her real-life father, Richard Bohringer,
plays Irene's dynamic husband, a business
man, bon v/vtfMf and rumored collaborates.
An abrasive presence on the periphery of the
film, Bohringer pere slowly, confidently as
sumes a central role, until "The Accompa
nist" is as much his story as Sophie's and
Irene's.
But one can't shake the feeling that "The
Accompanist" is nothing more than that — a
story. Director Claude Miller effectively juxta
poses the luxury Irene represents with So
phie's drab apartment (and drabber mother),
but leaves the day-to-day horrors of World
War II in the streets.
A cheap montage of newsreel images of
fiery air raids and death trains bound for con
centration camps is the closest Miller gets to
political commentary. Characters mechani
cally fill in extraneous historical details be
tween romantic liaisons. A perilous escape to
London never quite registers either danger or
discomfort.
Instead, Miller uses Irene's music as a shaky
bridge to higher, universal meaning. A who's
who of French and German composers are
called in to remind us that love — in any lan
guage — is inevitably accompanied by pain.
