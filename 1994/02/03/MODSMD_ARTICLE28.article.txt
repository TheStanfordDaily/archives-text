## What's Eating Gilbert Grape? 
### 
"Describing F.ndora is like dancing to no
music," muses Gilbert as he introduces the
small-town setting for "What's Hating
Gilbert Grape." Fortunately, this film has
more to offer than Endora. Sorrie darn good
acting coupled with effective artistic sym
bolism and imagery add flavor and force to
the story of the dysfunctional Grape family.
Gilbert Grape, played by Johnny Depp
("21 Jump Street," "Benny and Joon"), is
torn between personal desires and familial
obligations. He is the caretaker for his men
tally retarded brother, Arnie, and the man of
the house for his 600-pound mother whose

girth has kept her
couchridden since the
suicide of her hus
band seven years ago.
To complicate
Gilbert's troubles is
Becky (Juliette
Lewis), who just hap
pens into Endora and
opens Gilbert's eyes to
love and the possibili
ties which lie outside
his somber lifestyle.
Despite the ad
verse situation,
"Gilbert Grape" con-

tains uplifting notes of hope and renewal as
Gilbert finds the courage to break free from
the chains of a smothering family and haunt
ing past to pursue his own path of life, essen
tially resolving within himself "What's Eating
Gilbert Grape."
Gasting is key to making this story suc
cessful. While Depp is an adequate Gilbert,
his performance pales in comparison, to that
of Ixonardo DiCaprio, who is rumored to
receive an Oscar nomination for his
poignant and convincing portrayal of Arnie.
Lewis, also in the recent release "Romeo is
Bleeding," seems to be the perfect fit for the
character of Becky, the endearing, impish
beauty who subtly rocks Gilbert's world.
The superficially simple plot becomes
complicated by the intricate symbolism and
keenly selected metaphors woven through
out the story. The obese mother personifies
the enormous girth of circumstance which
bounds her two sons and two daughters to
their dreary life in Endora. Also, Amies pure
honesty is the voice of the family's greatest
unspoken fears and taboos, such as the death
of his father.
If you're purely interested in entertain
ment, or if you're looking for some good in
tellectual stimulation, be assured of a good
time amidst the wealth of tantalizing
metaphors, symbols and themes in "Gilbert
Grape."
