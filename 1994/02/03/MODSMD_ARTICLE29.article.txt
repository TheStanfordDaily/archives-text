# Romeo is Bleeding
## 
### 
Through an annoying voice-over narra
tion, the audicnce learns Jack Grimaldi (Gary
Oldman) is a cop on the Organized Crime
Task Force who gets himself into trouble by
listening to the "wrong voice" in his head.
This voice is probably the same one the pro
ducers listened to when they decided to make
"Romeo is Bleeding."
While a writer like Quentin Tarantino
proved in both "Reservoir Dogs" and "True
Romance" that gratuitous violence can be
entertaining, "Romeo is Bleeding" writer Hi
lary Henkin doesn't realize that to make the
violence watchable, there have to be some en
gaging characters and good dialogue.
Grimaldi leads a double life; he is supposed
to protect witnesses against the mob, but then
arranges for the witnesses to be hit before they
can testify. 1 lis real trouble begins when he is
contacted by a crime boss (Roy Scheider) to
arrange a hit on Mona Demarkov (Lena
Olin), a vicious, immoral Mafia hit woman
who has a penchant for sitting around with
her legs spread to show off her lingerie. Mona
offers Jack a sweeter deal: more money for
him if he can help her fake her death. Of
course, there's also a few extra personal perks.
Not that Jack needs any; he's already got a
wife (Annabella Sciorra) and a mistress (Juli
ette Ixwis) who will both ultimately suffer for

his crimes. Maybe Jack should have listened
to the voice that told him never to date Mona,
who is psycho enough to cut off her own arm,
and then ask him if he wants sex "with or
without." Too had for him.
What is especially frustrating about this
movie is that it wastes the talents of some very
fine actors on characters with no substance.
Although he has proven himself to be a very
versatile actor, all Oldman ("Dracula"True
Romance") is able to give Jack is a great New
York accent. Olin is reduced to flinging her
hair and legs around, and laughing maniacal
ly in her repeated attempts to kill Jack.
On the whole, there is no character devel
opment and nothing to incite the audience to
give a damn about what happens to any of
them. Since it's hard to sympathize with any
of them, there's no buildup of the suspense
needed to keep "Romeo" moving forward.
