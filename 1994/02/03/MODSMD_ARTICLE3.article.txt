### Gina Lee Staff writer 
Urging students to believe in themselves and think
positively, teacher Jaime Escalante spoke to an en
thusiastic standing room only crowd in Kresge Audi
torium last night.
Escalante, the teacher who inspired the movie
"Stand and Deliver," received a standing ovation be
fore he uttered his first word. Wearing a white cap
and gray-and-white striped shirt, Escalante began by

defining the termganas as "the desire and the key to
success in overcoming obstacles."
He used the underprivileged students he taught at
Garfield High School in East Los Angeles as an exam
ple of how all students possess potential.
In every year that he taught, at least one of his stu
dents received a perfect score on the math section of
the SAT, and his advanced placement calculus pass
rate was as high as 95 percent.
"I demanded more from them and they rose to the
level of my expectations," he said. "High schools are
not preparing students to stand and deliver for the
twenty-first century."
A teacher in his native Bolivia for 11 years, Es
calante immigrated to the United States in 1964.
After receiving his teaching accreditation, he went on
to teach advanced placement calculus at Garfield.
There he gained national renown for his motivation
al teaching methods.
Escalante emphasized the relationship between
parent and child as a driving force behind education.
Parents, he said, must learn to understand their
teenagers and maintain a balance between love and
discipline in the home.
By relating jokes and anecdotes, he stressed that
parents need to instill moral values in their children by
befriending them. "A friend is someone who after
lunch tells you that you have food in your face," he said.
Escalante teaches ethics along with mathematics
to his students. He addressed the problems of alcohol,
drugs and teen pregnancy in high schools today.
His mother, he said, was the source of his motiva
tion. A teacher herself, she inspired him to become a
teacher who encourages his students to strive for suc
cess.
In conclusion, Escalante said, "I do not create tal
ents, I discover them. I am proud to be a teacher."
Escalante received another standing ovation at the
close of his speech. After the applause died down,
sophomore Katie Friedman said, "I'd seen 'Stand and
Deliver' and it inspired me at the time, but I found
him just as inspirational in person."
