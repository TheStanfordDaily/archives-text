# Shoegazer pop special
## Swervedriver takes alternative rock to new levels 
### 
It's loud, alternative, distorted — and
great.
Yes, Swervedrivers most recent album,
"Mezcal I lead," is a memorable nine-song
collection.
Swervedriver is usually lumped in the
"shoegazer" or "swirly-pop" category (refer
ring to the swirling guitar effects these bands
often use). "Shoegazer" originated in the late
1980s in Manchester, England, combining
classic English pop vocals and song writing
with noisy, psychedelic guitar sounds and
New Wave dance beats. This type of music,
played by one-syllable bands such as I.ush,
Ride, blur and Curve, was well suited to the
emerging underground dance movement,
and was used accordingly by D.J.'s when raves
first appeared in England.
I tailing from Essex, England, Swervedriv
er claimed these roots on its first album,
"Raise." (There is even a song on it called
"Rave Down") However, the album doesn't
contain the profusion of guitar effects typical
to shoegazer bands, and most songs are
played with straight distortion. While some
songs are pop concessions, most are very at
mospheric, with noisy, droning guitars play
ing long, melancholy, minor-key progres
sions. While the album is good, it is not espe
cially diverse — it tends to grow somewhat
tiresome
"Mezcal Head" has a very different sound
than "Raise." Apparently, someone at A & M
decided that the band was marketable, be
cause the slight recording fuzz of the first
album was replaced by that expensive 96-
tracks-clear-as-glass major label sound. In
spite of this production effort, the songs are
much noisier than the band's previous work.
Rich guitar effects abound, with random

sound effects interspersed throughout, and
layers upon layers of distorted guitars. Even
on the pop radio songs, there is always an un
dercurrent of feedback or strange, quiet gui
tar sounds.
Pop radio songs, by the way, are
Swerved river's strong point. All the songs on
"Mezcal Head" are well written, but one
song, "Blowin' Cool," is simply amazing.
This song is so mind-numbingly catchy that
one must suspect the band of selling their
souls to the devil for one transcendent song.
This song has "Live-105 heavy rotation" tat
tooed all over it, but it is the stuff Radioheads
are made of.
The difference between Swervedriver and
Radiohead (metaphorically speaking) is that
the rest of Swervedrivers album is also very
strong. "For Seeking Heart," "MM Abduc
tion" and"I larry & Maggie" are also great al
ternative-pop songs, with slick, grungy gui
tar riffs, head-swaying rhythms, and sing
along vocal harmonies.
But even with the abundance of commer
cial stings, one factor keeps Swervedriver
from being just another MTV clone band:
the quality of the less accessible songs on the
second half of the album. These are closer to
the indie-rock roots of shoegazer music:
noisy, dissonant, and dynamic from loud and
hard to slow and psychedelic.
"Cirl on a Motorbike" ebbs and swells be
tween melodic pop and screaming feedback
discord. The longer "Duress" builds up slow
ly to a finale that could be taken from any
Sonic Youth album. The twelve-minute opus
"Never Lose That Eeeling / Never Learn" dis
plays every guitar noise Swervedriver has to
offer, yet is still one of the most melodic on
the album. The second half of the song,

"Never is a noisy psychedelic instru
mental reminiscent of late Pink Floyd, in
cluding a bizarre saxophone solo fading in
and out through the wall of guitar noise.
Lyrically, the band is like most bands of
this type: hazy and indecipherable. Of
course, it's not Bob Dylan; the emphasis is on
the music. The lyrics that can be gleaned
from the cover tell a story befitting the music,
a strange world of dreams and weariness and
surrealism. "Destination Satansville," a dri
ving song about being haunted by dreams of
disillusionment, reads, "I lay here calmly on
my bed and the trigger of my gun / And
should that no-good woman show up danc

ing from a dream I'll squeeze it tight and not
think twice and relish ev'ry scream." Other
songs are in a similar vein.
With nine good to outstanding tracks, two
mediocre songs ("A Change is Gonna Come,"
"You Find it Everywhere") and over an hour
of music, this is a solid album.
Swervedriver is currently on tour with
Therapy? (an Irish grunge-thrash outfit) and
Medicine, another shoegazer group. They
will play for the Bay Area Feb. 17 at the Tro
cadero Transfer (incidentally, a great place to
see a show). Their live show shouldn't be
missed.

much noisier than the band's previous work.
Rich guitar effects abound, with random

sound effects interspersed throughout, and
layers upon layers of distorted guitars. Even
on the pop radio songs, there is always an un
dercurrent of feedback or strange, quiet gui
tar sounds.
Pop radio songs, by the way, are
Swerved river's strong point. All the songs on
"Mezcal Head" are well written, but one
song, "Blowin' Cool," is simply amazing.
This song is so mind-numbingly catchy that
one must suspect the band of selling their
souls to the devil for one transcendent song.
This song has "Live-105 heavy rotation" tat
tooed all over it, but it is the stuff Radioheads
are made of.
The difference between Swervedriver and
Radiohead (metaphorically speaking) is that
the rest of Swervedrivers album is also very
strong. "For Seeking Heart," "MM Abduc
tion" and"I larry & Maggie" are also great al
ternative-pop songs, with slick, grungy gui
tar riffs, head-swaying rhythms, and sing
along vocal harmonies.
But even with the abundance of commer
cial stings, one factor keeps Swervedriver
from being just another MTV clone band:
the quality of the less accessible songs on the
second half of the album. These are closer to
the indie-rock roots of shoegazer music:
noisy, dissonant, and dynamic from loud and
hard to slow and psychedelic.
"Cirl on a Motorbike" ebbs and swells be
tween melodic pop and screaming feedback
discord. The longer "Duress" builds up slow
ly to a finale that could be taken from any
Sonic Youth album. The twelve-minute opus
"Never Lose That Eeeling / Never Learn" dis
plays every guitar noise Swervedriver has to
offer, yet is still one of the most melodic on
the album. The second half of the song,

"Never is a noisy psychedelic instru
mental reminiscent of late Pink Floyd, in
cluding a bizarre saxophone solo fading in
and out through the wall of guitar noise.
Lyrically, the band is like most bands of
this type: hazy and indecipherable. Of
course, it's not Bob Dylan; the emphasis is on
the music. The lyrics that can be gleaned
from the cover tell a story befitting the music,
a strange world of dreams and weariness and
surrealism. "Destination Satansville," a dri
ving song about being haunted by dreams of
disillusionment, reads, "I lay here calmly on
my bed and the trigger of my gun / And
should that no-good woman show up danc

ing from a dream I'll squeeze it tight and not
think twice and relish ev'ry scream." Other
songs are in a similar vein.
With nine good to outstanding tracks, two
mediocre songs ("A Change is Gonna Come,"
"You Find it Everywhere") and over an hour
of music, this is a solid album.
Swervedriver is currently on tour with
Therapy? (an Irish grunge-thrash outfit) and
Medicine, another shoegazer group. They
will play for the Bay Area Feb. 17 at the Tro
cadero Transfer (incidentally, a great place to
see a show). Their live show shouldn't be
missed.
