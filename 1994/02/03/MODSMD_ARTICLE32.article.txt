## "Jar of Flies" Alice in Chains 
### 
From the opening bass line on the new ep
by Alice in Chains, "Jar of Flies," it appears
that the foursome from Seattle arc travelling
into a well known territory. The saw-blade
guitar and bleak lyrics recall their previous
album "Dirt." I lowever it soon becomes clear
that the band is experimenting with this new
release. The result is a somewhat brighter
sound than anything they've ever done.
fast year's "Dirt," with it's drug-laden
lyrics and pounding guitars, was a master
work in grungy desolation. Frontman Layne
Staley guitarist and occasional singer Jerry

Cantrell seemed to
be plumbing the
depths of their souls,
scraping up every
thing for show.
Maybe they're done
scraping because
some of "Jar of Flies"
sounds oddly up
beat. Cantrell ends
"No Excuses" with
the surprising, "You
my friend /1 will de-

fend / And if we change, well I / love you any
way." Someone got up on the right side of bed
today for a change?
Acoustic guitars thrive on the album. Not
since their 1991 ep "Sap" have we heard any
thing like the mellow "Nutshell" or the down
right folkie "Don't Follow." Cantrell's
buzzing guitar remains just below the surface.
It bursts forward at just the right moments.
In a more experimental move, the band uses
a string section in two tracks to mixed results.
The sweeping, melodramatic strings of "I Stay
Away" nearly push the song into cheesy "No
vember Rain" territory. Hut in the instrumental
"Whale & Wasp" the haunting, restrained cello
sounds perfect against the whining electric gui
tar. It's the best track on the album, even with
out StaJey's dark, twangy vocals.
The last track, "Swing on This," begins
with a jazz-laden, syncopated rhythm and
bass line. The jazzy beat proves to be a great,
and new, trick for Alice in Chains. Swinging
into a driving chorus right out of "Dirt," they
find a happy medium of mixing their old fe
rocious sounds with something different. It's
as if they needed something new to try after
"Dirt." They seem to be toying with many in
teresting and tasty ideas without ever falling
too far from their angst-ndden roots, from
their dark, nearly scraped-clean souls.
