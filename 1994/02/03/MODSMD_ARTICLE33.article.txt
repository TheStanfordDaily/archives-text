# "Future Prophets" Blood of Abraham
## 
### 
Weak.
The adjective that describes what I
thought about Blood of Abraham's "Future
Prophets" the first time I listened to it. But it
began to grow on me after a while. While the
beats do not stand up in comparison to those
of albums such as Dr. Dre's "The Chronic"
and the vocal styles are not groundbreaking
like Snoop Doggy Dogg's, "Future Prophets"
is not the weak album I thought it was upon
first listen.
Produced by Eric "Eazy-E" Wright (of
N.W.A. fame) Blood of Abraham consists of
Benyad and Mazik, two rappers who have
something to say about the current state of
the nation. Although the packaging makes
an attempt to hide the fact that the group is
Jewish, the lyrics do not.
The social commentary is at times con
frontational and always controversial. With
track titles such as "Stick To Your Own
Kind," "Devils (>et No Dap," and "Niggaz
and Jew/. (Some Say Kikes)," Blood of Abra
ham's members have no qualms about ex
pressing their opinion. This inclination to

ward adversity may be a byproduct of the
producer, Fazy-F., who is not one shy away
from media attention.
Benyad and Mazik's lyrical skills prove to
be impressive. Not to say that Snoop Dogg or
Phife and Q-tip (of A Tribe Called Quest)
should run for cover, but I was surprised at
the verbal prowess of these neophyte rappers
in the world of hip-hop.
The lyrics on this album are by far superi
or to those of their producer (and veteran
rapper) Fazy-E. In what is undoubtedly
some kind of record, he says the word
"nigga" ten times in a segment of his guest
appearance.
For the most part, the beats on "Future
Prophets" are nothing special. They don't
stand out. Combined, the beats and rhymes
produce quality tracks that can keep your
attention, but if separated they could not
stand up on their own. An exception to this
weakness is "I'm Not The Man," a track with
a mellow bass line and excellent rhymes.
For a debut album, "Future Prophets" is a
good start. The group shows potential. With
better production and phatter beats, Blood
of Abraham could become a major group —
but at this rate they are destined to be
mediocre.
