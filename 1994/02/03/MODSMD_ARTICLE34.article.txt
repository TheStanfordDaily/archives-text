# "Tougher Than Tough" Various Artists
## 
### 
Have you ever wanted to experience reg
gae music beyond Bob Marley's "I.egend"
but have no idea where to start? Then this
four-CD box set might be for you. "Tougher
than Tough" also documents the ska move
ment that preceded reggae and the dance hall
rhythms that eventually replaced it.
Although the collection contains some
obscurities, it has a definite goal: to convey a
telling history of post-independence Jamaica
through changing musical styles and awe
some liner notes.
Disc 1 reflects the high-spirited Jamaican
mentality after being released from British
rule in 1962. Knter ska, a bouncy, uptempo
ancestor of reggae featuring happy and often
politically optimistic lyrics. Songs like Der
rick Morgan's "Forward March" embody the
perfect ska tune, with great syncopation and
lyrics. Although the sound quality of disc 1
leaves a bit to be desired, it's the best of the 4
CDs because of its consistency. Jimmy Cliff,
the Skatalites, and good ol' Bob himself are
among the featured musicians on this disc.

Discs 2 and 3 show the optimism giving
way and the upbeat tempos slowing down to
reggae. The disillusioned Jamaican popula
tion found enlightenment in religion, which
explains the theme of the box set's best song:
Culture's "Two Sevens Clash." Written in
1976, "Two Sevens Clash" foretells a prophe
cy of holy justice for all past wrongdoings on
the day of July 7, 1977. In traditional Ja
maican slang, Culture vocalist Joseph Hill
shouts, "What a livan bamba yay.. .when the
two sevens clash!" in front of an ethereal key
board arrangement that paints an intense
portrait of apocalypse.
The final disc is an indication of stability,
both in the current Jamaican state and in the
musical style prominent in Jamaica today.
Dance hall can best be described as reggae
gone techno. But like techpo, where every
song sounds like "James Brown is Dead," the
22 tracks compiled on disc 4 all bear resem
blance to Tenor Saw's "Ring the Alarm" — the
only redeeming dance hall tune on the set.
"Tougher Than Tough" is not four CDs of
consistently stunning singles. But as a histo
ry class combines highlights with less spec
tacular events, "Tougher Than Tough" does
the same with its songs.
