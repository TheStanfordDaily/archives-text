# "Not Just For Kids" Jerry Garcia and David Grisman
## 
### 
Jerry "Captain Trip" Garcia and David
"Dawg-Style" Grisman have put out another
bluegrass masterpiece album. Weaving gui
tar and mandolin lines around each other
with a fluency only attainable through years
of experience, these two masters have com
bined a rich knowledge of traditional folk
and children's music and recorded an album
of children's songs—but as the name implies,
this collection is "Not For Kids Only."
While the album doesn't have any type of
sure-to-please "Grateful-Dawg" (a favorite
tune from their first album), it makes up for
it with more subtle virtuoso playing and a
guaranteed good time. Highlights of the
album are "There Ain't no Bugs on Me,"
which gets you in the mood with a pretty
evening arrangement of bug sounds and
drifts into and out of clever rhymes and
melodic mandolin runs. Particularly cool are
the occasional chirping of a bullfrog and the
buzzing of horseflies. Jerry's acoustic guitar

work especially shines on this track.
Another fantastic tune is the classic "Jenny
Jenkins" which kicks off the album. Especial
ly groovy here is when Garcia and Grisman
sing the chorus: "I'll buy me a foldy-roldy,
tildy-toldy / Seek-a-double, use-a-cozza roll
to find me / Roll Jenny Jenkins, Roll." While
obviously a children's rhyme it just makes
you feel good (no intoxicants required).
The album encompasses a variety of mu
sical moods from the rollinggrooveof"Jenny
Jenkins" to the Dixie feeling of "A Horse
Named Hill" to the final mellow closer of the
disc, "A Shenandoah Lullabye." A number of
talented guests show up throughout the
album from Hal Blaine's percussion work to
Jon Rosenberg's piano and Joe Craven's fid
dle on "Arkansas Traveler." Also, you'll defi
nitely be familiar with a number of the
melodies from the songs you sang as a child.
Garcia did the cover art of him and Gris
man playing tunes to a crowd of happy
though bewildered children, a scene I'd love
to see. Also included with the CD are all the
lyrics to the songs, a boon to any parent
singing these songs with their kids. I know
I'm looking forward to the opportunity to
sing these tunes with my own children.
