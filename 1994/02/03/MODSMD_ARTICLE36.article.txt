Blink
With a foul-mouthed, bad-tempered
heroine (Madeline Stowe) who has
regained sight after years of blind
ness as the central character,
"Blink" proves to be a good detec
tive story with a twist. While she's
predictably stalked by her neigh
bor's murderer and falls in love with
the man who protects her, eerie hal
lucinations and space-age medical
advances help "Blink" stand out R
Blue
Incredible sound design and art di
rection make "Blue" an incredible
visual-audio experience. But the
story belongs only to Juliette
Binoche, who provides a perfect
portrayal of a woman in pain who
attempts self-liberation by cutting
herself off from of her emotions.
"Blue" is a rarity in a piece of com
mercial art — an accessible, en
gaging work of art R
In the Name of the Father
Despite appearances by Academy

Award-winning actors Daniel Day-
Lewis and Emma Thompson, "In the
Name of the Father" rarely rises
above melodrama. Instead of focus
ing on how violence can destroy the
life of an everyman, director Jim
Sheridan takes on a well-worn per
spective, opting for courtroom
drama straight out of "L.A. Law" and
"Perry Mason." R
Intersection
Dilemmas, dilemmas. Playing a suc
cessful architect who must choose
between his career-oriented wife
(Sharon Stone) and a caring, upbeat
mistress (Lolita Davidovich), Richard
Gere comes to a mid-life cross
roads. The pretty shots of the pretty
faces are offset by cheesy scenes
and cheesy lines R
Mrs. Doubtfii-e
Without Robin Williams, this film
would be just another boy-dresses
as-girl-flick. He carries it just a notch
past into the land of almost-innova
tive entertainment — with a serious

method hidden just below the sur
face. With adequate support from
the rest of the cast (Sally Fields,
Pierce Brosnan), Williams' first self
produced flick deals with parent
hood and divorce while always
keeping one hand on the funny
bone PG-13
Naked
An experience that could, at best, be
called painful, Mike Leigh's latest
takes the worst view of male female
relations and pushes it to an ex
treme. With the story of an intellectu
al drifter who sexually and emotion
ally abuses women, Leigh suggests
that all women are masochists
through an overtly misogymstic film
UNRATED
The Pelican Brief
Picture Julia Roberts. She could
almost (just almost) pass for your
average law student — the kind
who uncovers the devious con
spiracy behind the deaths of two
Supreme Court justices. But this

premise is no more believable in
Alan J. Pakula's film "The Pelican
Brief" than it is in John Grisham's
bestselling novel. No one can ac
cuse Pakula of original ideas;
every scene of the movie is lifted
almost verbatim from the novel. In
stead of watching the "Great Julia
Roberts Comeback," order out for
a slice of "Mystic Pizza." PG-13
Schindler's List
The dark, haunting images of
Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's
List" overcome the film's charac
ters, leaving moments more im
portant than people The story of
German entrepreneur Oskar
Schindler and the more than 1,100
Jews he saves leads to an exami
nation of the many faces of evil in
the Nazi regime With indelible pic
tures of death and degradation
burned in black-and-white film,
"Schindler's List" captures the
truth of the more than six million
murders carried out just a half cen
tury ago. R
