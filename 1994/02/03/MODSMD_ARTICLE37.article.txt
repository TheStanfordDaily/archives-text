# What It Means to Us
## Chekov's 'Uncle Vanya' 
### Ed Maklouf 
As I looked out mournfully over the aged audi
ence amassed in the Marines Memorial The
ater to see Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya" — an
ocean of shiny domes punctuated occasionally by the
wispy capitol of a relative youngster — I wondered
whether this performance had been block booked by
a Civil War survivors club, or whether it was indica
tive of the low esteem in which Chekhov's work is held
in the non-walking frame part of the population.
It is not surprising that few feel Chekhov has
much to say to us these days. Can we, modern citi
zens with everything to prove, bravely swiping our
meal card through life's rich cash register, really
have anything in common with 19th century Russ
ian estate owners and their miserable existence? I
think so.
Like many of us, Vanya is a sad case. He was an
intelligent, talented man who devoted his life to
support his brother-in-law, a bogus intellectual,
who has come with his beautiful second wife Yelena
to live on the country estate.
Vanya, played by 'lony Amendola, hates this pro
fessor bitterly but is in love with Yelena. He tells of
his misery to anyone who gives the slightest
prompting. In his incisive observations (he de
mands to know why it is immoral for Yelena to cheat
on her husband, who she dislikes, but moral to sup
press her true feelings) and in his grim humor, we
see what a success he might have been had he de
voted his life to his own development. Vanya is only
likable when he is drunk or courting Yelena.
Amendola performs the role magnificently, engag
ing our sympathy without making us feel we are look
ing at a potential saint who just took one wrong turn.
The other key character is the doctor, Astrov,
played by Wendell Pierce. He is not as embedded in
the archaic values of the family and his passionate
love of trees has resulted in something (the planting
of a forest) that might endure. The plain Sonia falls
in love with him but he too has fallen in love with
Yelena. Pierce is excellent; his frustration at being
unable to communicate with people who will talk
but not act stands out.
Actress Sharon Omi's portrayal of Sonia was the

most unfortunate aspect of this production. Ideally,
Sonia must show that she realizes and denies some
of the flaws in her situation and cohabitants. In
stead, Omi plays Sonia like a "90210" kid, without
any real dimension, and the part deserves more.
The minor parts all acquit themselves well. "Waf
fles" is a seemingly trivial comic part who is actually of
extreme importance to understand the play. He tells
how his wife ran away from him on the day after their
marriage, complaining that he was "facially repulsive."
"Waffles" maintains that he "Still has (his) pride" he
cause he supports the children she had by another
man and has remained chaste himself in her memory.
The absurdity here reveals that the problem with
the main characters is that they see enough of their
predicament for it to hurt. Vanya alone sees with
immense pain that what he requires is not just to
marry Yelena or to kill the professor but to have his
life back. He needs a new history. They all need a
new history.
Although this is not the best production of
"Uncle Vanya," it is still a very good one. The set was
superficially bizarre, consisting of a mildly irritating
bright green astroturf-covered slope in which was
embedded a small piano. The directing was effective
in making use of the interesting multi-level stage in
order to construct pretty images but it was clearly
designed to avoid and draw attention away from the
expressionist possibilities of such a stage, which 1
suppose was a good decision.
What would have been a superb, intimate, low
budget production had obviously been endowed
with extra cash. The good side of this was the beau
tiful costumes, but we were also provided with
thunder noises that did not really add anything to
the production.
This production is definitely worth seeing. It runs
until March, and although spending three or four
times the cost of a movie might seem extravagant, 1
believe there is more for us kiddies in the play than
there was for the Jurassic specimens lined up in front
of me. After all, we are only in the very early stages of
wasting our lives. And it is to people with a chance
that Chekhov would want to speak. ■
