# New Res Ed plan scrutinized
## RFs, Fac Sen subcommittee brainstorming alternatives 
### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
Two weeks after Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Mary Edmonds unveiled
plans to consolidate the Office of Resi
dential Education under Housing and
Dining Services, resident fellows con
cerned with the move are mobilizing to
suggest major revisions and even draft
alternate proposals.
In addition, a subcommittee of the
Faculty Senate's Committee on Under
graduate Studies is beginning to review
the mission and structure of Res Ed.
The Subcommittee on Residential
Education and Advising, reconvened
after several years of hiatus, met for the
first time this week to examine the "cur
rent, proposed and perhaps other struc
tures" of Res Ed and examine "how best
to integrate Residential Education into
the other goals of the University," said
Assoc. Prof, of Communication Jeremy
Cohen, chair of the subcommittee.
Under Edmonds' proposal, "round

the-clock" residential services, includ
ing housing and dining services, the
graduate housing office, the Mousing
Center and the Office of Residential Ed
ucation — rechristened the Office of
Residential Life — would report to Keith
Guy, currently director of housing and
dining services.
A new half-time faculty dean of resi
dential education would oversee the aca
demic activities in residences, including
dorm-based courses taught by resident
fellows. Provost Condoleezza Rice must
approve any restructuring proposal.
Edmonds, who met with resident fel
lows last Friday, has asked them to form
an advisory panel to help her with reor
ganization plans. The panel should be in
place within a week or two.
"I want them to look at the negative
and positive aspects of the new organiza
tion," said Fvdmonds, who expects them
to report by mid-April. "I want them to
look at the role and the reporting rela
tionship of the proposed dean of residen
tial education, if that is considered a pos

itive addition.
"My new organizational structure
stands," said Edmonds. But she added,
"Clearly, the RFs are major players and
I need to be sensitive to their concerns."
Compromising Res Ed?
While the idea for a new deanship has
been embraced by most resident fellows,
many have expressed discontent at
being subordinated to Housing and Din
ing Services and the proposed name
change.
"I'veyet to meet an RF who supports
[Edmonds'| idea," said EAST house
Resident P'ellow Jim Ketelaar, an assis
tant professor of history. "I don't see the
advantage of putting Res Ed under Food
Service. It would compromise the educa
tional aspect of Res Ed."
While acknowledging that a reconfig
uration of Student Affairs is inevitable
given the current budget situation and
"unwieldy" organization of the unit,
Serra Resident Fellow Ross Shac
ter said, "the problem is that most
RAs and RFs perceive ourselves
as educators more than service
providers" like the employees of
Housing and Dining Services.
In addition, some fellows felt
caught off guard when Edmonds
announced her proposal suddenly
on Jan. 14 and were upset that
they were not consulted before
the plan was announced.
"It was unclear if it was a pro
posal open for discussion or a fait
accompli," said Ketelaar.
"Communication could be bet
ter," said Shacter. "The initial
plan had a lack of input from RFs.
But it might just have been that
[Edmondsl wasn't free to discuss
it publicly with RFs until it met
certain approvals.
"I don't think she anticipated
some of the opposition," said
Shacter, who added that both the
RFs and the vice provost's office
are working to improve dialogue.
While Edmonds maintains that
her "original intent was to reorga
nize while retaining the flexibility

to deal with changes" that will be
suggested by the Committee on
Undergraduate Education, she
said RFs had been "asking a lot of
questions" about the plan and
that she "hadn't anticipated some
of the issues that arose."
Edmonds now says she is open
to suggestions. "The advisory com
mittee will provide a forum for me
to find out problems with the pro
posed reorganization and the role
of the new dean," said Edmonds,
who has already acknowledged
some of the concerns.
"There will be no name
change," she said. "There is a lot
of symbolism, sentiment and
identification with 'Res Ed' that I
was not aware of, and I relented
on that one immediately."
RFs brainstorm
This week, resident fellows
have been tossing around other
possible structures. On Sunday,
Larkin Resident Fellow Sue Har
vey e-mailed a proposal to other
RFs that would create a full-time
dean of residential education to
oversee Res Ed, the Undergradu
ate Advising Center, the Center
for Teaching and Learning and
the Haas Center for Public Ser
vice.

"This grouping is based on the
principle of similarity of function
as a basis for structural change;
that is, there seems to be a gener
al similarity in the nature of these
services," wrote Harvey in her
proposal. "Such a grouping might
also tend to attract resident fel
lows from the ranks of the faculty
and the academic staff a bit more
readily than [Edmonds*] proposed
arrangement."
Resident fellow positions are
now filled by staff members as
well as faculty. Out of the houses
with resident fellows, three-quar
ters have at least one faculty
member serving in the position.
While Harvey said her idea was
meant "to stimulate other alter
nate proposals," it has been well
received by other fellows.
"This is a very elegant propos
al that looks more workable and
would maintain the integrity of
Res Ed," said Ketelaar.
"The sentiment among most
of the resident fellows is that
[Edmonds' proposed] reorganiza
tional strategy was not capturing
the academic / intellectual and
program parts of Residential Edu
cation under one coherent
umbrella," said Casa Zapata Resi
dent Fellow Cecilia Burciaga.

"And that we are separated from
the other academic and program
partnerships with CTL, CPPC,
UAC and the public service cen
ter."

'That reorganization
al strategy was not
capturing the aca
demic / intellectual
and program parts of
Res Ed under one
coherent umbrella.'
— Cecilia Burciaga.

Structuring the dean's role
While most fellows seem excit
ed about the possibility of a dean
of residential education —
whether full or half time — most
agree that the role of this person
must be well defined.
"Many of us see this as an
opportunity — if that dean can be
a real leader for RFs and RAs,
that would really strengthen their
roles," said Shacter. "I think it

takes a lot of moral support from
within Res Ed for RAs to assert
themselves as intellectual leaders.
That's where I see the possibility
for some real change."
"The other problem is that the
dean position in this
reorganization is not completely
fleshed out," said Burciaga. "That
dean of Residential Education
would be appointed by Condoleez
za Rice and, we all assume, that
that half-time faculty appoint
ment would only be concerned
with the courses taught in the
residences.
"The plan right now calls for
the resident fellows to actually
report to Housing and Dining Ser
vices. The problem for me is how
to tear apart programming —
such as gender, race, class discus
sions — from courses," she said.
The SREA study
While the advisory panel and
other resident fellows begin
mulling over suggestions for Res
Ed, the Faculty Senate subcom
mittee, SREA, will be taking a
more structured approach to the
subject.
According to Cohen, SREA will
look at the history of Res Ed,
whose present form dates to 1973;

examine the structure of the pro
gram and its place in the Univer
sity; and solicit input from stu
dents, faculty, staff and educators
in similar programs at other Uni
versities.
History Prof. David Brady,
chair of the Faculty Senate's
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, said that while
Edmonds' proposal "generated
some unfounded jumping up
and down," the decision to
reconvene the subcommittee
was actually made earlier in the
school year.
"There is general agreement
that the problems with Res Ed
come on the Ed side," said Brady.
"It's a good idea to have aca
demics charged with the educa
tional aspects."
Despite all the cooks ready to
jump into the kitchen and prepare
new recipes for restructuring,
Edmonds says the situation is not
adversarial.
"It's not a 'we-they' situation,"
said Edmonds. "I'm hoping that it
brings up all sorts of issues. It can
only help."
"This is the most vocal I've
seen RFs in a long time," said
Ketelaar, who has been a resident
fellow for four years.
