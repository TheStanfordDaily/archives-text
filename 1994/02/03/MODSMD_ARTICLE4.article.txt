# New Res Ed plan scrutinized
## RFs, Fac Sen subcommittee brainstorming alternatives 
### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
Two weeks after Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Mary Edmonds unveiled
plans to consolidate the Office of Resi
dential Education under Housing and
Dining Services, resident fellows con
cerned with the move are mobilizing to
suggest major revisions and even draft
alternate proposals.
In addition, a subcommittee of the
Faculty Senate's Committee on Under
graduate Studies is beginning to review
the mission and structure of Res Ed.
The Subcommittee on Residential
Education and Advising, reconvened
after several years of hiatus, met for the
first time this week to examine the "cur
rent, proposed and perhaps other struc
tures" of Res Ed and examine "how best
to integrate Residential Education into
the other goals of the University," said
Assoc. Prof, of Communication Jeremy
Cohen, chair of the subcommittee.
Under Edmonds' proposal, "round

the-clock" residential services, includ
ing housing and dining services, the
graduate housing office, the Mousing
Center and the Office of Residential Ed
ucation — rechristened the Office of
Residential Life — would report to Keith
Guy, currently director of housing and
dining services.
A new half-time faculty dean of resi
dential education would oversee the aca
demic activities in residences, including
dorm-based courses taught by resident
fellows. Provost Condoleezza Rice must
approve any restructuring proposal.
Edmonds, who met with resident fel
lows last Friday, has asked them to form
an advisory panel to help her with reor
ganization plans. The panel should be in
place within a week or two.
"I want them to look at the negative
and positive aspects of the new organiza
tion," said Fvdmonds, who expects them
to report by mid-April. "I want them to
look at the role and the reporting rela
tionship of the proposed dean of residen
tial education, if that is considered a pos

itive addition.
"My new organizational structure
stands," said Edmonds. But she added,
"Clearly, the RFs are major players and
I need to be sensitive to their concerns."
Compromising Res Ed?
While the idea for a new deanship has
been embraced by most resident fellows,
many have expressed discontent at
being subordinated to Housing and Din
ing Services and the proposed name
change.
"I'veyet to meet an RF who supports
[Edmonds'| idea," said EAST house
Resident P'ellow Jim Ketelaar, an assis
tant professor of history. "I don't see the
advantage of putting Res Ed under Food
Service. It would compromise the educa
tional aspect of Res Ed."
While acknowledging that a reconfig
uration of Student Affairs is inevitable
given the current budget situation and
"unwieldy" organization of the unit,
