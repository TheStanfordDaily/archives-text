At a town meeting last night,
Dean of Students Michael Jackson
joined ASSU representatives and
students in debating ways to make
student government more effec

pros and cons of reducing the
number of ASSU Senators and
voting according to districts.

which, if approved by the student
bodv, could halve the number of

senators — said a smaller senate
would be more efficient.
"Basically, this bill will give
each senator a greater responsibil

asked.
But graduate senator Sanford
Dickert argued that reducing the
size of the senate would create
gaps in representation. "The
ASSU is a pool of leadership taT

size I don't know who is going to
do the job."
However, members of the
Council of Presidents echoed
Lucas' sentiment. "At the end of
the year, you still have senators
who have never talked to each

other," COP member Ying Ying
Goh said.

bill at its meeting Tuesday, stu
dents will have a chance to vote in
a special election. If the amend

jority, voters will choose from
among four districting proposals,
including the status quo, during
the regular spring election and
then vote for a new senate in the
fall.
Currently many senators feel

serve any community if they don't
