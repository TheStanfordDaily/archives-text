# Dean, COP debate districting
## 
### Charles Katz Staff writer 
At a town meeting last night,
Dean of Students Michael Jackson
joined ASSU representatives and
students in debating ways to make
student government more effec
tive.
During the meeting, which was
attended by just a trickle of stu
dents, participants outlined the
pros and cons of reducing the
number of ASSU Senators and
voting according to districts.
Undergraduate senator Gabe
Lucas — who authored a bill
which, if approved by the student
bodv, could halve the number of

senators — said a smaller senate
would be more efficient.
"Basically, this bill will give
each senator a greater responsibil
ity. Is that a bad thing?" Lucas
asked.
But graduate senator Sanford
Dickert argued that reducing the
size of the senate would create
gaps in representation. "The
ASSU is a pool of leadership taT
ent," he said. "If you reduce the
size I don't know who is going to
do the job."
However, members of the
Council of Presidents echoed
Lucas' sentiment. "At the end of
the year, you still have senators
who have never talked to each

other," COP member Ying Ying
Goh said.
If the senate approves Lucas'
bill at its meeting Tuesday, stu
dents will have a chance to vote in
a special election. If the amend
ment passes by a two-thirds ma
jority, voters will choose from
among four districting proposals,
including the status quo, during
the regular spring election and
then vote for a new senate in the
fall.
Currently many senators feel
that they lack power, COP mem
ber Ron Brown said. "They can't
serve any community if they don't
have power," he said.
Serving the community
became the crux of t he redisrict
ing issue. Jackson said that dur
ing his years as a Stanford stu
dent in the late 19605, each dorm
elected its own representative to
the senate and he felt that system
was an effective one.
However, a student at the
meeting pointed out a possible
disadvantage. "If you district vot
ing by dorms, the campus is less
likely to elect minority candi
dates," he said.
Districting by class would be a
better option, said COP member
Jason Snyder, since it would help
unify students. Currently, Sny
der said, "there is little cohesive
ness in each class."
Whatever decision students
make, Jackson said, "the admin
istration will work to make it
work out."
His main concern was not over
the districting of the senators,
but with the ASSU's pecuniary
aspects. "Reducing the size of the
ASSU is not where the action's

at. The money is," Jackson said.
Many people do not realize
that the ASSU is a multi-million
dollar association and that it has
been running at deficit the past
few years, Jackson said. To make
up for the shortfall, the organiza
tion has been forced to dip into its
endowment.
"What's important is to make
sure the ASSU is living up to its
fiduciary responsibilities," Jack
son said.

When participants raised the
question of whether the ASSU is
necessary at all, Jackson
squashed it immediately. It
would be a bad idea to allow the
Office of Student Affairs to dic
tate the allocation of student
funds, he said.
"I think it's great that stu
dents pitch plans for money to
other students," Jackson said.
"They don't have to go to mommy
and daddy and try to sell it."
