# Walsh lands solid recruiting class
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
A glance at Stanford's 1994 recruiting class in
dicates that the National Honor Society could put
together an impressive football team. The fifteen
member class head coach Bill Walsh unveiled yes
terday includes 13 Ail-Americans and nine Na
tional Honor Society members, forming a group
that is widely considered one of the best in the Pa
cific 10 Conference and in the top fifteen national
ly-
"l am very pleased with the young men that have
signed with Stanford," Walsh said in a press confer
ence yesterday."It was close to being a 100 percent
successful recruiting year."
Walsh noted the fact that this year's crop is
smaller than most, hut did not think that the
fewer number of scholarships the football team

had available had much effect on the quality of the
players selected. Moreover, Walsh emphasized the
national diversity of the incoming class, with only
two recruits coming from California, while four
hail from Texas, two from Alabama and one from
Florida.
In a shift typical of Walsh's approach to athletics
on the Farm, the head coach spent much of the be
ginning of his conference discussing the academic
prowess of these members of the class of 1998. And
the numbers back up his praise: the average grade
point average of these recruits is a 3.43, up from last
year's average GPA of 3.4. Furthermore, the aver
age SAT score of these 15 is well above 1,000.
"There isn't another school in the country that
can talk in these terms, or even approximate this
kind of (academic performance!, combined with
outstanding athletes," Walsh said.
To the cynical, an immediate
reaction to a head football coach
talking about the academic per
formance of his recruits is the
assumption that the group is
athletically under par. But the
numbers belie this assumption.
Four of these high school seniors
are ranked among the nation's
top-10 at their position, while
five others occupy top-20 slots.
Four of the 15 are All-Ameri
can offensive linemen, slated to
replace a unit that graduates
several of its top players from
last year. Another four are Ail-
American linebackers to help
beef up a questionable lineback
ing corps that was ineffective at
stopping the run last season.
An area of need that Stanford
was unable to fill, though, was
the defensive line. Only one
recruit played d-line in high
school — Anthony Willis of Mis
souri City, Texas — and Willis
missed much of his senior sea
son due to a broken leg.
"Anthony Willis is the most
important recruit most likely
because he plays defensive line,"
Walsh said. "He has the quick
ness, explosion and power we
need at all positions. He is criti
cal for Stanford . . . We would
have liked to have more defen
sive linemen on this list, but
there just weren't any."
As he has done in the past,
Walsh continued to emphasize
the difficulty of recruiting for an
academically rigorous school like
Stanford.
"These were the men who
could qualify and could play at
this level," Walsh said. "Had
they all been punters, I would
have had a hard time sitting
here with 15 punters to try to
elaborate on."
Walsh did not feel that a dis
appointing last season hurt the
team's recruiting too much, nor
did persistent rumors of his
stepping down due to health
problems, although both
weapons were used by opposing
coaches.
