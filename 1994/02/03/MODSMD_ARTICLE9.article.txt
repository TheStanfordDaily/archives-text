## Rival health care plan endorsed 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a rebuff to
the White House, a major business group
supported a rivjiJ health care plan yester
day as the "starting point" for reform. It
said President Clinton's approach was too
regulatory and relied on price controls.
President Clinton and Hillary Rod
ham Clinton had gone to extraordinary
lengths to try to head off the Business
Roundtable vote in favor of the managed
competition bill sponsored by Rep. Jim
Cooper, I)-Tenn., and Sen. John Breaux,
D-La., and others.
BF Goodrich Chairman John Ongsaid
the Cooper bill was "built around market
mechanisms" as opposed to the "govern
ment regulation ... and price controls" in
the White House bill.
"We are very disappointed," said
White House spokesman Jeff Eller. "We
think it was a mistake and we regret their
decision."
Cooper, whose bill eschews a mandate

on employers to pay for health insurance,
allied it "a strong boost for our bill."
"We already had a lot of small busi
nesses on our side. Now with big busi
nesses endorsing it, we have a stronger
hand," said Cooper, who was grilled yes
terday by fellow Democrats on a House
panel about his plan.
The move came after an unusually
aggressive campaign by President Clin
ton, Hillary Rodham Clinton and senior
cabinet officers to head off the vote of
confidence in the rival bill. Clinton said
he told the business leaders "their best
ntgotiating position ought to be to say
wh;*t they thought was wrong in our
bill" rather than endorsing Cooper.
The Cooper bill would not require
employers to buy insurance. It would
give subsidies for people with incomes up
to twice the poverty line and require
companies with fewer than 100 employ
ees to join insurance purchasing pools. It

would also sharply limit corporate tax
deductions for health care.
Ong said the business leaders had dif
ferences with Cooper's provisions,
including a sharp limit on how much
businesses could deduct in health costs.
The Roundtable is a group of 200
chief executives of some of the nation's
biggest corporations. A health care task
force, headed by Robert C. Winters, the
chairman of Prudential, a major health
insurer, had recommended backing the
Cooper plan.
A White House aide, Robert
Boorstein, said earlier that the Pruden
tial executive "has a big stake in which
bill gets through Congress."
The Cooper plan is the only major
reform bill with significant bipartisan
support. It has 57 sponsors from both par
ties in the House and four in the Senate.
Rep. Fred Grandy, R-lowa, and Sen. Dave
Durenberger are co-sponsors.
