# 'Giving back'
## $10M gift to fix up stadium 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Complete renovation of Stan
ford Stadium, estimated to cost
more than $12 million, took a
giant leap forward this week as
alumnus Louis Foster donated
$10 million to the cause.
The field at the stadium will be
named in honor of Foster, whose
gift is the largest in the history of
the Department of Athletics.
"We are absolutely thrilled to
receive a gift of this size for what
we consider to be a high-priority
purpose," said John Kates, direc
tor of major gifts at the depart
ment. "We also hope that this is
going to give I Foster I great plea
sure and we're really excited
about that."
According to Foster — who is
chairman of 20th Century Indus
tries, a large L.A.-based insurance
firm — the gift is part of his effort
to give back to the community.
"I believe people should step up
to the responsibility of giving back
whatever they possibly can, and I
hope this gift serves as nn example
in that way," Foster said in a
statement.
"This is a gentleman who came
to Stanford from the Upper Penin
sula of Michigan in the heart of
the Depression," Kates said. "He
credits Stanford with making him
a success."
Though the gift was announced
this week, Foster, Class of '35,
committed to donating the money
at the end of December, Kates
said. The department solicited a
donation from Foster as part of an
ongoing $34 million drive to
upgrade athletic facilities.
"Mr. Foster and his wife were
major contributors several years
ago," Kates said. "As we got this
campaign going, they were
prospects for another gift."
Foster served as senior manag
er of the track team during his
freshman year and is an avid fan
of Stanford football.
Stadium renovations for the
World Cup, such as significant
reconstruction of the press box and
replacing wooden seats with alu
minum ones, are already under
way. The World Cup renovations
are expected to reach $4 million
and will Ik? funded by World Cup
USA and a gift made last year.
According to Kates, Foster's
donation will be used for long
range renovations, such as widen
ing the concourse surrounding the
stadium and improving restroom
facilities.
"It will make the stadium a
much more comfortable and hos
pitable place," he said. Renova
tions using Foster's gift are sched
uled to begin later this year and
will be finished by the fall of 1995.
Kates said the stadium im
provements are only part of the
department's "Campaign 2000," a
$34 million effort to improve ath
letic facilities in general. But he
stressed the importance of Foster's
donation.
"The stadium is now 72 years
old and this was a wonderful gift
that helps us make headway.
"It would have taken us a long
time to get the money from other
donors," he added.
