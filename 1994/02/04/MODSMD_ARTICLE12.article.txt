Senate confirms Perry
WASHINGTON (AP) — Acting with unusual
speed, the Senate confirmed William Perry as
defense secretary yesterday, turning over com
mand of the Pentagon to a scholar, business
man and expert on high-tech weapons.
The 97-0 vote came slightly more than a
week after President Clinton named Perry,
until now the No. 2 man at the Pentagon, to
replace Les Aspin. Shortly after the Senate
vote, Perry was sworn in at the Pentagon.
"He does have the vision we need," said Sen.
Carl Levin, D-Mich., a member of the Senate
Armed Services Committee. "He is totally com
mitted to the security of this count ry."
Committee colleague John Warner, R-Va.,
predicted Perry would rank "among the finest"
of the 19 people to hold the job since its cre
ation after World War 11.
Perry takes over as the glow of Cold War vic
tory fades and the specter of nuclear weapons
proliferation and simmering regional conflict
emerges.
Quake tax approved
SACRAMENTO (AP) — A two-year, 1/4-cent
sales tax boost starting April 1 was stormily
approved yesterday by a Senate panel to help
rebuild quake-battered Los Angeles.
But lawmakers left little doubt that the $1.5
billion relief effort was tangled in election-year
politicking.
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, who
authored the bill, said his proposal would show
the federal government that California was
willing to foot part of the bill of the Jan. 17
Northridge quake, a 6.6 magnitude temblor
that killed 61 people and injured more than
9,000. Losses have been estimated at $15 billion
or more.
"We have to do something to demonstrate
that California is doing something and stepping
up to the plate," Brown said, noting t lie current
congressional debate over an $8.6 billion relief
package.
"It makes no sense, 17 days after the quake,
for the state government to have done nothing
but photo ops," Brown said.
The Senate Revenue and Taxation Commit
tee approved the bill on a 6-1 vote, with Sen.
Rob Hurtt, R-Garden Grove, opposed.
The panel changed the bill to a quarter-cent
over 26 months, as opposed to Brown's original
plan of a half-cent over 13 months.
