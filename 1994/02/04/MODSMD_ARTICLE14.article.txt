# Vietnam embargo lifted

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Clin
ton made a controversial gesture of reconcil
iation toward Vietnam yesterday, lifting the
19-year U.S. trade embargo against a nation
whose divisive war left a legacy of suspicion
over the fate of missing American soldiers
and airmen.
The move opens an important emerging
market for American goods in Southeast Asia
and was greeted with enthusiasm by U.S.
business interests already setting up opera
tions in the former enemy capital of Hanoi.
Clinton made his announcement after
describing his thinking in several private
meetings with veterans groups and anxious
family members of the missing servicemen.
Reaction from those groups was largely neg
ative.
Clinton said he was convinced the step
would further efforts to get a full accounting
of the missing Americans, and that his deci
sion was not based on enabling U.S. busi
ness to make profits there.
"We would lose leverage (on resolving MIA
questions with Vietnam) if there were no for
ward movement," Clinton said. He said there
had been much progress in recent months in
accounting for 2,238 American MLAs and
POWs in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
He added: "Whatever the Vietnam War
may have done in dividing our country in the

past, today our nation is one in honoring
those who served and pressing for answers
about all those who did not return."
Sen Republican leader Robert Dole of
Kansas said, "While many of my colleagues
think lifting the trade embargo on Vietnam
is the right course, I believe it is the wrong
decision at the wrong time for the wrong
reasons."
Clinton's decision to risk the wrath of
veterans groups was made easier by a non
binding 62-38 vote in the Senate last Thurs
day favoring an end to the embargo. Some
veterans and family groups maintain that
Vietnam has recovered the remains of hun
dreds of MlA's hut refuses to turn them over
to U.S. authorities.
Kven though Clinton minimized the ben
efits American businesses would receive, it is
no secret that Vietnam is regarded as ripe
territory for foreign investors. It is one of
Asia's fastest-growing markets and nearly
all other countries that had once joined in
the embargo have re-established commercial
ties with the communist nation.
Clinton's efforts to avoid military service
during the Vietnam War — and his opposi
tion to that war — made his decision all the
more sensitive. But Clinton said that every
American of his age knew someone who died
or was wounded in the fighting.
