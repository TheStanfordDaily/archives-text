## Editorials EV family matters

IF YOU'RE TRYING to convince
someone to change, it's best to
be very clear about how they
should improve. Last week's meet
ing between Escondido Village resi
dents and University housing offi
cials was a necessary step in voicing
residents' concerns about facilities.
However, the assembly demonstrat
ed how difficult it is for residents
and administrators to communi
cate.
The decentralized housing sys
tem in EV impedes student efforts
to organize around common con
cerns and diminishes the ability of
housing administrators to under
stand students' most pressing
issues. To improve the quality of
facilities and student life in EV each
group must clear present its needs.
The family council — the resi
dential group that initiated the
meeting — is an excellent model for
clarifying the myriad issues con
fronting graduate students and
their families in University hous

ing. The council accomplished the
vital first step in any negotiation —
an informative meeting.
However, the meeting that took
place lacked a clear agenda other
than to voice students' various con
cerns. In the future, residents need
to be more organized when they
petition the University A list of the
most pressing concerns — which
Assoc. Dean of Graduate Policy
George Dekker requested — would
have better focused the discussion.
Nonetheless, the difficulties in
dealing with graduate housing
should not be allowed to let housing
officials off the hook. Assoc. Direc
tor of Housing and Dining Services
Rodger Whitney termed himself a
"graduate student advocate." To
advocate well, both his staff and
Dekker's need to make pro-active
efforts to better understand and
address the problems EV residents
face.
Otherwise, all the talk may result
in no action.
