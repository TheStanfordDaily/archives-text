# A 						symbol of support

THANKS TO the efforts of a
few students, all of Stanford
will be able to experience the
human side of the AIDS epidemic
when part of the AIDS quilt comes
to the Graduate School of Business
at the end of this month.
The quilt — a world-wide pro
ject sponsored by NAME, a non
profit AIDS awareness group —
now includes over 26,000 separate
panels bearing the symbols of
AIDS victims.
Although the scope of the AIDS
epidemic is said to be impressed
upon viewers when the quilt is
seen in its entirety, a trip to see the
24 quilts— on display at Jackson
Business Library Feb. 28 through
Mar. 6 — would still humanize
what often seems to be an indi
gestible, mounting number of vic
tims.
Whether or not a person knows
someone with AIDS, researchers

estimate that if the virus continues
to spread at the current rate, every
person will know someone with the
disease in a matter of decades.
In addition to bringing the pan
els to campus this month, a small
number of students are working to
coordinate a display of a larger
portion at Stanford in 1995. The
Stanford community and student
groups — like the ASSU and the
community centers — should
embrace this effort by showing
their support and getting involved
in the project.
Stanford students and staff, like
the rest of the nation, still have
much to learn about the AIDS epi
demic. By hosting a section of the
six-year-old quilt, the University
has symbolically shown that it
wants to do more to stop the dev
astating disease. With hope, people
who visit the panels in a few weeks
will come away better informed.
