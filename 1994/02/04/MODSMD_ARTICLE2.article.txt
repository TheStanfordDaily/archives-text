The new eatery was discovered when employees
entered the building for an inspection before begin
ning seismic renovations, according to Chonna De
laney, an acting zone manager for Facilities. They
found a painted sign on the staircase that read
"Restaurant" with an arrow pointing upstairs.
Inside, employees found a makeshift table, as well
as two chairs, a stereo and some candles. Delaney said
she called the fire marshal because she was con
cerned that the candles posed a fire hazard.
The entrepreneurs gained access to the building
through windows which were sealed with nails, De
laney said. The windows have now been resealed.
The room's door lock had also been changed, said
Shirley Chen, the project manager in charge of the re
pairs.
Delaney has posted signs outside the building stat
ing that the person who owns the confiscated items
should call the facilities office.
Delaney said she has no idea how long the "restau
rant" was in operation.
Building 260 has been closed for a couple of years
due to earthquake damage. Renovation is scheduled
to begin in about a month.
