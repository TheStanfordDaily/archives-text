## ASSU Council of Presidents COP discusses successes, future goals 
### 
STUDENT government must be
judged on its ability to produce mea
surable results, rather than
rhetoric. With the support of our cabinet,
we have achieved precisely that — con
crete results — by striking a balance
between ensuring student services, rep
resenting student interests, and facilitat
ing communication:
• Campus Services: By working with
the administration and the ASSU Senate,
we fulfilled our campaign commitment
bv working with the University to bring
summer storage back to campus. To
bring you new and better services, we
founded the Entrepreneurial Grants Pro
gram which allocates $10,000 in start-up
capital to student service ventures, and
are now selecting among 22 student busi
ness proposals. In addition, we have
made improvements in Tresidder a prior
ity, becoming involved in such changes as
the advent of Taco Bell.
• Representation: We have persistent
ly voiced student concerns to decision
makers, through both formal and infor
mal channels. Understanding the impor
tance of budget restructuring, we have
met regularly with the Provost, acting as
a sounding board for changes impacting
student life.
We also created the Student Advisory
Group on Undergraduate Education to
work alongside President Casper's Com
mission on Undergraduate Education. So
far, SAGUE has placed students on CUE
subcommittees and has developed four

reports on campus-wide meetings for the
commission. Our group is also conduct
ing weekly forums in residences and
more campus-wide discussions.

'With four and one half
more months in our
administration, we are
not ready to sit back and
relax.'

• Communication: Our six town meet
ings so far have connected University
officials with over 100 students, provid
ing opportunities for all of us to examine
pressing campus issues with important
policy makers. To keep the campus in
tune with ASSU issues, we have pub
lished "Campus Currents," the ASSU
newsletter, and have initiated door-to
door walks in dorms. The Leadership
Summit facilitated student group net
working and better defined some funda
mental drawbacks of the ASSU as an
institution; this input is being acted upon
in the form of proposals to restructure
the ASSU Senate.
With four and one half more months
in our administration, we are not ready
to sit back and relax. In fact, we are chal
lenging ourselves to follow through with
our established projects as well as to ini

tiate several new ones.
We will continue to improve campus
services by fighting for cable television
and for a truly student-oriented "stu
dent" union. We will continue to advo
cate student interests with top adminis
trators, requesting that the University
adopt an "inflation plus two percent for
two years" tuition policy. We will utilize
your input from a campus-wide student
poll on undergraduate education and
student services. And we will continue
to communicate with the student body
through a follow-up Leadership Sum
mit, three more issues of "Campus Cur
rents," and more town meetings in
graduate and undergraduate resi
dences.
In this time of budget restructuring, it
is foremost in our minds to ensure that
Stanford continues to be a world-class
university. To this end, we put forth a
challenge to all community members —
genuine interaction and open communi
cation between administrators, faculty,
and students is the key to reach this goal
of continuing excellence.
We are proud of our successes thus
far, and hope to leave an example for
elected student leaders in the future.
Thank you for the opportunity to serve as
your Council of Presidents.
