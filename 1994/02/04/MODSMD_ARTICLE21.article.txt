## Ram's Head is more open, diverse than article suggests 
### 
WHILE INTERMISSION'S Jan.
27 article on Ram's Head was a
somewhat fair description of the
organization, it contained some omis
sions and errors which demand a
response. First of all, it is a mistake to
say that Ram's Head has difficulty
attracting new members. In the 1992
Big Game Gaieties, 26 out of 34 cast
members were new to the organization.
Of the 32 members of this year's Gai
eties, 25 were brand-new members. Of
those, nine were frosh, two went on to
perform in Winter One Acts, and five
will appear in "Guys and Dolls" this
spring. Of 29 members of the "Guys and
Dolls" cast, nine are new to the organi
zation.
The image of Ram's Head using the
same people in show after show partially
arises from the fact that many of the
new members are already performers,
highly visible on campus due to their
participation in a cappella groups, dance
troupes, or other dramatic projects. Still,
even some of these seasoned performers
are new to Ram's Head. While Gabe Tis
sian claims that our auditions are "much
less than open," being an active member
of Ram's Head does not guarantee you a
part in any show. Many an old-timer has
been disappointed by not getting cast in
the role he or she wanted. Trust us on
this one!
With respect to technical crews, last
year's run-crew for Gaieties was, as

Michael DeGusta pointed out, composed
entirely of freshmen. The Set Designer,
Assistant Choreographer, and Assistant
Stage Manager for "Guys and Dolls" are
all frosh. The Costume Designer for
"Cabaret" was a transfer from Brown
University.
Nor is it true that Ram's Head is a
"tight core of techies surrounded by
actors," a phrase which several of us had
never heard until your article. The first
difficulty is that such a distinction
between techie and actor is harder to
draw than your article suggests. Melissa
Wilson, current Executive Producer of
Ram's Head, has appeared in shows, but
also stage managed last year's Winter
One Acts, and has produced and
designed for other shows. Dan Goldman,
a member of the Board of Directors, has
appeared in and directed shows, but also
worked on the run crew for Cabaret. Jeff
Meador, who has done everything from
props for Gaieties to serving as Financial
Manager on the Executive Staff, has per
formed in "Little Shop" and "Cabaret,"
and will appear in a leading role in
"Guys and Dolls" this spring. This is
typical of many active Ram's Head mem
bers. We do whatever is needed to get
the show on the road. This year's Board
of Directors is comprised of three mem
bers who probably consider themselves
"techies," and two who might be called
"actors," but we work together just fine
to solve whatever puzzles may arise in

producing big shows.
While Ram's Head's regular season
consists of Gaieties, Winter One Acts,
and the Spring Musical, we have pro
duced and continue to produce Special
Projects, which can be any size or shape,
musical or non-musical. One of our most
recent Special Projects, Spontaneous
Generation, an improvisation group, has
turned into a regular part of our organi
zation.
We object to your article's characteri
zation of the student theatrical atmo
sphere to be one of competition. Ergo is
not the only other student theatrical
group on campus. The Asian American
Theater Project, the Committee for
Black Performing Arts, Teatro Chicano,
the Women's Performance Collective,
Stanford Savoyards and individual Dorm
Theater productions, while not all stu
dent groups, serve to support the arts at
Stanford, and the multitude of organiza
tions only strengthen each other.
We continue to share resources, indi
viduals, and even produce shows with
these other organizations. A recent coop
erative venture was last year's "Nu Stu
Revue," co-produced by Residential Edu
cation, Ram's Head, AATP, CBPA, and
the Drama Department. Our improv
group, SponGe, and the Drama Depart
ment's improv group Simps, have coex
isted just fine in the two and one half
years since they were formed, and even
do regular shows together. We look for

ward to Ergo's productions as further
enriching campus theater, and hope that
we can help each other to keep the arts
alive at Stanford.
Finally, we invite anyone interested
in live theater at Stanford to become
involved with Ram's Head. We are cur
rently in the midst of a production of
Guys and Dolls and are hiring musicians
and technicians. The hiring process for
next year's Gaieties has also begun, and
we should be hiring a Head Writer and
Writing Staff very soon. We also invite
you to come to our open Board meetings,
every other Thursday at 6 p.m. in
Drama 125.
A disproportionate number of those
interviewed for your article have been
inactive in Ram's Head for as long as
two years. Ram's Head is a living
organization, not a static one, and we
reiterate that many of those inter
viewed would find this year's Ram's
Head a very different place. While we
admit that not all of us love everybody
else all of the time, surely no organi
zation whose members spend days and
nights together for weeks on end can
be free of all fraction . . . even The
Daily!

We continue to share resources, indi
viduals, and even produce shows with
these other organizations. A recent coop
erative venture was last year's "Nu Stu
Revue," co-produced by Residential Edu
cation, Ram's Head, AATP, CBPA, and
the Drama Department. Our improv
group, SponGe, and the Drama Depart
ment's improv group Simps, have coex
isted just fine in the two and one half
years since they were formed, and even
do regular shows together. We look for

ward to Ergo's productions as further
enriching campus theater, and hope that
we can help each other to keep the arts
alive at Stanford.
Finally, we invite anyone interested
in live theater at Stanford to become
involved with Ram's Head. We are cur
rently in the midst of a production of
Guys and Dolls and are hiring musicians
and technicians. The hiring process for
next year's Gaieties has also begun, and
we should be hiring a Head Writer and
Writing Staff very soon. We also invite
you to come to our open Board meetings,
every other Thursday at 6 p.m. in
Drama 125.
A disproportionate number of those
interviewed for your article have been
inactive in Ram's Head for as long as
two years. Ram's Head is a living
organization, not a static one, and we
reiterate that many of those inter
viewed would find this year's Ram's
Head a very different place. While we
admit that not all of us love everybody
else all of the time, surely no organi
zation whose members spend days and
nights together for weeks on end can
be free of all fraction . . . even The
Daily!

27 article on Ram's Head was a
somewhat fair description of the
organization, it contained some omis
sions and errors which demand a
response. First of all, it is a mistake to
say that Ram's Head has difficulty
attracting new members. In the 1992
Big Game Gaieties, 26 out of 34 cast
members were new to the organization.
Of the 32 members of this year's Gai
eties, 25 were brand-new members. Of
those, nine were frosh, two went on to
perform in Winter One Acts, and five
will appear in "Guys and Dolls" this
spring. Of 29 members of the "Guys and
Dolls" cast, nine are new to the organi
zation.
The image of Ram's Head using the
same people in show after show partially
arises from the fact that many of the
new members are already performers,
highly visible on campus due to their
participation in a cappella groups, dance
troupes, or other dramatic projects. Still,
even some of these seasoned performers
are new to Ram's Head. While Gabe Tis
sian claims that our auditions are "much
less than open," being an active member
of Ram's Head does not guarantee you a
part in any show. Many an old-timer has
been disappointed by not getting cast in
the role he or she wanted. Trust us on
this one!
With respect to technical crews, last
year's run-crew for Gaieties was, as

Michael DeGusta pointed out, composed
entirely of freshmen. The Set Designer,
Assistant Choreographer, and Assistant
Stage Manager for "Guys and Dolls" are
all frosh. The Costume Designer for
"Cabaret" was a transfer from Brown
University.
Nor is it true that Ram's Head is a
"tight core of techies surrounded by
actors," a phrase which several of us had
never heard until your article. The first
difficulty is that such a distinction
between techie and actor is harder to
draw than your article suggests. Melissa
Wilson, current Executive Producer of
Ram's Head, has appeared in shows, but
also stage managed last year's Winter
One Acts, and has produced and
designed for other shows. Dan Goldman,
a member of the Board of Directors, has
appeared in and directed shows, but also
worked on the run crew for Cabaret. Jeff
Meador, who has done everything from
props for Gaieties to serving as Financial
Manager on the Executive Staff, has per
formed in "Little Shop" and "Cabaret,"
and will appear in a leading role in
"Guys and Dolls" this spring. This is
typical of many active Ram's Head mem
bers. We do whatever is needed to get
the show on the road. This year's Board
of Directors is comprised of three mem
bers who probably consider themselves
"techies," and two who might be called
"actors," but we work together just fine
to solve whatever puzzles may arise in

producing big shows.
While Ram's Head's regular season
consists of Gaieties, Winter One Acts,
and the Spring Musical, we have pro
duced and continue to produce Special
Projects, which can be any size or shape,
musical or non-musical. One of our most
recent Special Projects, Spontaneous
Generation, an improvisation group, has
turned into a regular part of our organi
zation.
We object to your article's characteri
zation of the student theatrical atmo
sphere to be one of competition. Ergo is
not the only other student theatrical
group on campus. The Asian American
Theater Project, the Committee for
Black Performing Arts, Teatro Chicano,
the Women's Performance Collective,
Stanford Savoyards and individual Dorm
Theater productions, while not all stu
dent groups, serve to support the arts at
Stanford, and the multitude of organiza
tions only strengthen each other.
We continue to share resources, indi
viduals, and even produce shows with

erative venture was last year's "Nu Stu
