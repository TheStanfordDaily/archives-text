# Column's criticism of Meyer Library unfair
## 
### 
Archi-torture? How can Dave Neiman
not appreciate the imposing presence of
Meyer Library, nestled ominously between
Green Libraiy and Sweet Hall? The
world's ugliest building? Come now. Pick
on someone your own size.
It's true that budget cuts have restrict

ed Meyer's once proud collection of books
to just one floor. The fourth floor is now
used by Green library workers displaced
by the earthquake and the second floor is
filled with computers, VCRs, tape
recorders and CD players.
Yes, the administration has changed
Meyer for the worst? and it may never
again be a mecca of social life and study
ing. This is no reason to heckle the struc
ture. Don't kick her while she's down.
We may never see a scantily clad stu

dent half-heartedly reading Descartes on
the fourth floor sun decks, be able to go to
Meyer with the knowledge that the cute
guy/gal from dV will be there, or disco on
the fourth floor.
We will, however, always be able to
throw a Frisbee from the Grand Staircase
or nap in a green or yellow chair near a
wall of windows that lets the real world in.
Long live Meyer!
