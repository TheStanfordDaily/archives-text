## Waltzing my bias away: the joys of the Viennese Ball 
### 
THE GODS ARE ANCiKY Not just
your minor annoyance kind of
anger, like when the Blockbuster
guy calls at 7 a.m. to tell the SAE who
had my room last year that his 17 porn
videos are overdue. Or even bitterness
anger like when someone swipes the
quesadilla you've been waiting 15 min
utes for at the Coffee House and you
have to order another.
Not even offended anger like when
someone changes the radio in the bath
room to Rush Limbaugh when you're in
the shower, so you have to hear about
the evils of welfare before you've even
started your bad hair day. I'm talking
uncontrollable anger, wrath, rancor.
Somehow I have offended the higher
beings in the universe in such a pro
found and inexcusable way that they
have sent down a curse upon my soul
more crippling than human compassion
could ever comprehend.
I got asked to the Viennese Ball.
It can't be, I scream in terror in the
middle of the night, awakened from this
hellish nightmare that has become my
life. It's just a cruel, sick joke designed

by my parents to scare me into feminini
ty. A heartless trick pulled by my draw
mates to pay me back for all the times I
flaked on Senior Pub Night. A devious
plot by a demented member of the male
species intent on forcing me into submis
sion, insisting that males traditionally
lead during a waltz.
Let's sit this one out.
Or perhaps it's just another example
of tin* used-car salesmen of the world
pulverizing the wills of otherwise intelli
gent individuals. You just wouldn't look
the same without an ill-fitting tux and
cummerbund that will ride up to your
armpits before you even make it out of
your dorm.
You just don't understand the sub
lime elegance of a dress made with
enough material to cover Sri Lanka and
hemlines so low you pick up enough
gravel and low-growing lichens off the
ground to start your very own landscap
ing business.
You just won't have a complete Stan
ford experience without freezing your
penis off sleeping out for tickets, forking
over thousands of dollars to your podia

trist after a freak waltzing accident, and
spending an entire evening wondering
what skits on Saturday Night Live
you're missing while maxxing out the
venue at the refreshment table.
She's not buying it.
It's actually ingenious. Fooling over
100 students with astronomical SAT
scores so adeptly that in their heart of
hearts they truly believe they would love
nothing better than to twirl around for
hours in a run-down gym five minutes
away from their dorms and pretend it's
a luxurious Hapsburg palace in Vienna.
Please pass the bratwurst.
I can't believe I'm going to be a part
of this. I can't believe I said yes. I can't
believe I didn't call back and say no to
his answering machine just seconds
after he had left.
I can't believe I bought a dress I will
never wear again in all my days, a dress
I will try and sucker my daughter into
wearing for Homecoming during her
freshman year in high school, thereby
beginning the great mother/daughter rift
that will torture us both until the end of
our therapist's patience.

I will have the counseling billed to the
Viennese Ball committee.
Can you imagine me, fair reader, as I
walked into Laura Ashley, that bastion of
lace and petticoats, in the Stanford Shop
ping Center, looking not to punch one of
the salesgirls in the stomach, but instead
for a little strapless slice of heaven? As
the woman (lashed me that "we don't let
your kind in here" look, and I defiantly
picked through rack after sickening rack
of floor-length monstrosities, smiling my
most radiant debutante smile and picking
my underwear in her condescending
direction.
Me, trying on dress after dress,
removing my best punk-rock-girl outfit
to be strangled by Victorian high lace
necks, suffocated by tight taffeta bust
lines made for the typical 12-year-olds
these dresses are marketed for, stum
bling over skirts which were all the rage
in the 1820s?
You've come a long way, baby.
Me, champion of all things anti-social,
zipping up one of these atrocities, looking
in dismay at the four already dejectedly
hanging sloppily from their perfect hang

ers. My two-sizes-too-big steel-buckled
piss-off shoes resting in the corner as I
took a big look at myself in the mirror,
somewhat pleased with what I saw.
Not exactly Buckingham Palace dur
ing croquet hour, yet hardly dowdy and
dumpy. Could it be? A semi-perfect retail
fit? I asked a woman in the dressing
room to help me adjust the back. She
was buying the same dress, but in red.
Said it was a great dress for dancing —
she herself was a big polka and waltz fan
— and pointed out all the complemen
tary features. Nothing quite like a good
waltz, she said. Great fun, she said.
Then, my guardian angel of fashion
advice whisked her away, leaving me to
twirl just once and see the skirt fill out.
Maybe it wouldn't be so bad after all.
I'm gonna sell the rights to Disney.

Tish's date might have had the futile
hope that she would not delve into this
topic, but she thinks he was just asking
for trouble.
