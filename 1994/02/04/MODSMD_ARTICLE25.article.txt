## Women's basketball drowns Ducks 81-60 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
Quack, quack, thud. Returning home to
snap a two-game losing skid, the Cardinal
women's basketball team used'a huge effort
by junior center Anita Kaplan to render the
Oregon Ducks dead in the water, 81-60,
before 3,151 in Maples Pavilion last night .
Kaplan scored early and often, netting 16
of her game-high 25 points in a first half that
endtxl 35-21 and all but clinched matters for
Stanford (12-5, 5-3 in Pacific 10 Conference
play). With tin' win, the Cardinal moved up
three spots in the Pac-10 standings and now
shares second place with UClj\ and the
Ducks (12-6, 5-3).
"I talktxl to the team earlier this week and
told them their back was against the prover
bial wall," said Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer. "I asked them, 'Who's going to
respond?'"
VanDerveer got her answer right away, as
Kaplan set the tone with an eight-foot
turnaround for the game's first basket. After
hitting another baseline shot, she converted
two layups and then ended a four-minute
Cardinal scoring drought with a five-foot
hook that gave Stanford 21-12 edge at the
8:21 mark.
"We needed Anita as a go-to player
tonight, because as long as she goes to the
basket, she's unstoppable," VanDerveer said.
But the game's star, who also pulled down
a team-high six rebounds, quickly deflected
her coach's praise, bestowing mxlit on the
(Cardinal's play makers.
"The guards did a good job passing and
shooting, and that opens things up for me
inside," Kaplan said.
Indeed, guard Christy Hedgpeth kicked in
12 of her 16 points as the Cardinal ictxl the
game after intermission. Her three-pointer
with 16 minutes remaining capped a 16-4
Stanford run that opened the second stanza
and forced first-year Ducks coach Jody Runge
to call a timeout with her team being "dou
bled up" at 51-25.

As it turmxl out, VanDerveer had also
takon time to talk with Hedgpeth, a senior
tri-captain, about her role on the team in the
wake of last week's disasters.
"I told Christy that we had 10 games It'll
after tonight and I asked her, 'How do you
want to go out of here?'" VanDerveer said.
Again, the coach got her answer in a big
way. In addition to (J-of-9 shooting from the
field and a close brush with a four-point play
at the 10:05 mark, Hedgpeth grabbed four
rebounds and dished out four assists.
In fact, it was a banner night of sorts for
VanDerveer, whose decision to confuse Ore
gon with a full-court pressure defense from
the outset of the contest provide! yet another
Cardinal highlight. Yet while Stanford creat
ed 23 turnovers and held the Ducks to an ane
mic 19-of-52 (36.5 percent) shooting on the
night, it coughed up the ball 19 times and
gave its opponent several opportunities to
even things up early.
"We didn't shoot well early," Rungesaidof
a first half that saw her team make just 7-of
-25 field goals. "But we couldn't make our
layups with a numbers advantage after beat
ing the press, and we were forced out of our
timing on our set offense."
Another cause of Oregon's misfortune
came with the loss of senior center Sara Wil
son, the team's leading scorer in conference
play, to a sprained ankle midway through the
first period.
But in the end, it was just too much Stan
ford, and particularly, too much Kaplan.
"We wanted to get in front of (Kaplan)
with our zone defense and make them lob,
but she just kept getting around us," Kunge
si lid.
With the Cardinal coming around and
snapping out of its two-game (link, it now
readies for tomorrow night's first encounter
with the Oregon State Beavers (12-5, 4-4),
who handily defeated California in Berkeley
bust night. Action gets underway at 7:30 p.m.,
