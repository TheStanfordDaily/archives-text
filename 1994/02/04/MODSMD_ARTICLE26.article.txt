# Gymnasts face Cal
## 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
"No matter what the sport,
you love to beat Cal."
Stanford's women's gymnas
tics team hopes to do just that,
said Stanford head coach Breck
Greenwood, when it faces the
Golden Bears tonight at 7:30 p.m.
on rival terrain.
While Stanford overcame the
Bears in two regular season
meets last year, the Cardinal
ended up with a lower score at
NCAA Regionals. This season,
the No. 1,3-ranked Stanford
squad simply plans on beating
them each time they meet, begin
ning tonight.
Yet the Bears are not expected
to go down without a light. Com
peting with a fully healthy team,
California will display its
strongest line up tonight.
"Our top six gymnasts will be
up on each event, so we'll have no
excuse if we lose," said Cal's head
coach Alfie Miller.
The No. 18 Bears lost their
first meet to Oregon State,
though a California freshman
took first place all-around, then
came back to win their next meet
against UC-Davis. At their last
meet, Cal beat San Jose State but
lost to Santa Barbara.
The Bears have proven most
steady on floor and vault.
Heather Schneider and Lisa
Washington should lead on the
event, while the strongest floor
performers are all-arounders
Candace Kwok, Sirinda Sin
charoen and freshman Mindy
Ornellas. While the team's high
est scoring potential is on the
beam, the performances often
lack consistency, according to
coach Miller. He pointed to Cindy
Torn as the one to watch on beam

and as well as bars.
However, he said the Cardinal
also has an impressive line-up.
"I've had my spies out, and
Stanford looks great — they are
in mid-season form early in the
season," Miller said. "1 would love
to hit all four events in one meet,
and I would love to win. The team
that will win will be the team that
is the most consistent. I'm look
ing forward to the rivalry."
The Cardinal is well-prepared
to face the challenge, after a
strong workout week focused on
consistency. The team hopes to
stick all its bar routines tonight,
as well as stand-up each of its
vaults, with a few gymnasts per
forming typically successful
vaults over riskier ones that are
worth more.
Sophomore Linda Chun will be
leading off the Cardinal on the
beam, a new addition to the line
up from last week. Moor partici
pants will be the same, though
routines may be slightly altered
since local judges critiqued rou
tines this week and suggested
some changes.
Though the Cardinal gym
nasts will miss last week's enthu
siastic crowd, they do not antici
pate the away meet negatively
affecting their performance.
"It is hard not having the
crowd on your side," freshman
Ariel Fassanisi said. "But we just
have to really go in there and 'see
red"' — a term coined by the gym
nasts which means focusing and
picturing the team as one unit.
Junior Tina Snowden agreed
the Cardinal just needs confi
dence. "Berkeley is a good team
this year, but we have to keep up
tradition and just go in and beat
them," she said. "We are used to
competing there. If anything,
we'll do better competing away."
