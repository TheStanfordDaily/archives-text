# Closing doors
## Kaplan scores a warm 25 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
The proverbial door was shut early on for the Ore
gon Ducks last night, but the Maples Pavilion ushers
could have done a better job closing the actual doors
for Cardinal center Anita Kaplan.
Plagued by back problems ever since her summer
visit to Taiwan for the Jones Cup, the 6-foot-5 center
was pestered last night by an unwelcome draft dur
ing the seven minutes she spent on the pine. Despite
being cold on the bench, she was hot on the court,
finishing with a team-high 25 points.
"Once I get warmed up my back is fine, but then 1
go back to the bench and they leave those doors
open," Kaplan said.
Other than her qualms about court climate con
trol, however, Kaplan had little else to complain
about after a game that saw her dominate the low
post from the opening minutes.
"Our wings were shooting the ball well from the
outside and that opened things up," said Kaplan.
Thanks to an effective interior passing game,
Kaplan scored 16 of her 25 points in the first half.
After averaging 13.3 points per game coming into
last night's matchup, Kaplan's increased offensive
output off 11 for 18 shooting from the floor
impressed her coach.
"We were able to get the ball to Anita and she
scored really well on the low block," VanDerveer said.
This year's Cardinal squad faces a kind of adver
sity that is new to them: a lack of bench depth.
"There's a different type of pressure on this year's
team. They don't have the luxury of being able to
bring someone in for them," VanDerveer said.
This challenge is particularly applicable to
Kaplan, who lacks a suitable backup at center — in
fact, she is the only center listed in the official roster.
"Our upperclassmen really have to set the tone.
That's why I'm so happy to see Anita play like she
did," VanDerveer said.
After two disappointing losses last weekend in
Southern California, Kaplan appears ready to accept
the challenge.
"I definitely think we had something to prove
I didn't feel so good about how I played last weekend.
Each and every one of us has to take it personally,"
Kaplan said.
And some additional help from the ushers might
be appreciated
