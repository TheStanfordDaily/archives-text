# Men's hoops pulls off a narrow victory
## Knight sinks game winner in final second, leads with 19 points 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
Freshman Brenin Knight hit another game
winning shot for the Stanford men's basketball
team, this one a five-footer with one second on
the clock, leading the Cardinal to a 69-67 win
over Oregon last night in Eugene, Ore.
Knight, who defeated Washington with a
buzzer-beater in the Cardinal's Pacific 10 Con
ference opener three weeks ago, salvaged a win
against a Duck squad which stormed back

from an 18-point deficit in the game's final
seven minutes.
"We'll take [the win) and get out of town,"
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery said. "It just
shouldn't have come down to the end like that.
You feel good about the win, hut you feel bad
about the way you completed the game."
Stanford (12-5 overall, 5-3 in the Pac-10),
which took a 33-29 advantage into the locker
room at halftime, controlled the action for
most of the second half. After Oregon's Orlan
do Williams hit a 3-pointer to open the second

period, the Cardinal went on an 8-0 run, taking
a 41-32 lead when Jim Morgan followed up an
Andv Poppink miss two minutes into the half.
Stanford took its largest lead of the night at
61-43 when Brent Williams hit a 3-pointer at
the 7:31 mark.
But the Cardinal, which has yet to win a
Pac-10 game bv more than 11 points, slowly
lost its edge and the game's momentum. The
Ducks' Williams trimmed the Stanford lead to
67-60 when he hit a 3-pointer with
2:20 remaining.
That's when things began to get
interesting. On the Cardinal's next
possession, forward Andy Poppink
missed a pair of free throws.
Williams, who finished with a
game-high 22 points for Oregon fe
ll, 2-6), was fouled in 3-point land
and hit two of three from the line,
cutting the margin to 67-62.
Stanford guard David Harbour
lost the ball on a traveling violation
during the Cardinal's next posses
sion, but a Williams 3-pointer for

the Ducks was short.
With 50 seconds remaining,
Harbour missed a pair of foul
shots. Oregon's Aaron Johnson
made it a 67-64 game when he put
in two free throws 11 seconds later.
The Ducks' full-court press,
which had yielded no turnovers in
the game's first 39 minutes, forced
a Cardinal 10-second violation on
the ensuing possession. With 21
seconds to go, Williams hit his
fourth three-pointer of the game,
this one a long-range bomb with
Harbour in his face, tying the con
test at 67.
That's when Knight, who led
Stanford with 19 points, took the
game into his hands. The point
guard dribbled through Oregon's

full-court pressure, setting up the
Cardinal ofTense with 13 seconds to
go. With both Dion Cross and
Brent Williams covered, Knight
dribbled left, using a Poppink
screen to launch his last-second
shot.
"We can't specifically design a
play because you don't know
what's going to happen," Mont
gomery said. "IKnight's] got kind
of a knack for doing that."
Williams finished with 15 points
and 10 rebounds for the Cardinal,
and Poppink added 12 points.

first Pac-10 road win in nearly two
