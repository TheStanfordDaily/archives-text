# Volleyball looking to spike UCSD, SDSU

### Kuthryn Yang Staff writer 
A Stanford men's volleyball team without set
ter Canyon Ceman is like a Chicago Hulls club
without Michael Jordan. Some things just will
not be the same.
1 lowever, even with Jordan's absence this sea
son, the Hulls remain a championship-caliber
team. Likewise, with Ceman sitting out this
weekend's matches against UC-San Diego and

San Diego State, the Cardinal (3-3 overall, 2-0 in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) should
still live up to its No. 5 ranking and administer a
thorough pounding of both Southern California
squads.
Hampered by a leg infection, Ceman, last
year's National Player of the Year, will look on
from the sidelines as the eighth-ranked Aztecs (0-
5, 0-3) rendezvous with the Cardinal in Maples
Pavilion at 7 p.m. Friday. Then the Tritons (2-1)
will invade the Farm with a 5 p.m. match the

next day at Burn ham Pavilion.
Afler posting an impressive 11-8 record and
placing third in league last year, San Diego State
was bracing for a fall this season after returning
just one starter from last year's rotation. Going
into the season unranked, the Aztecs shocked the
collegiate volleyball faithful with two impressive
wins over Ixmg Beach State and Santa Barbara,
before finally succumbing to No. 2 USC 'Tuesday.
