# Volleyball looking to spike UCSD, SDSU
## 
### Kuthryn Yang Staff writer 
A Stanford men's volleyball team without set
ter Canyon Ceman is like a Chicago Hulls club
without Michael Jordan. Some things just will
not be the same.
1 lowever, even with Jordan's absence this sea
son, the Hulls remain a championship-caliber
team. Likewise, with Ceman sitting out this
weekend's matches against UC-San Diego and

San Diego State, the Cardinal (3-3 overall, 2-0 in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) should
still live up to its No. 5 ranking and administer a
thorough pounding of both Southern California
squads.
Hampered by a leg infection, Ceman, last
year's National Player of the Year, will look on
from the sidelines as the eighth-ranked Aztecs (0-
5, 0-3) rendezvous with the Cardinal in Maples
Pavilion at 7 p.m. Friday. Then the Tritons (2-1)
will invade the Farm with a 5 p.m. match the

next day at Burn ham Pavilion.
Afler posting an impressive 11-8 record and
placing third in league last year, San Diego State
was bracing for a fall this season after returning
just one starter from last year's rotation. Going
into the season unranked, the Aztecs shocked the
collegiate volleyball faithful with two impressive
wins over Ixmg Beach State and Santa Barbara,
before finally succumbing to No. 2 USC 'Tuesday.
At the helm of the Aztecs
enterprise is 6-foot-6 junior
outside hitter John Hyden.
Averaging 6.22 kills per game
last year (fifth in the nation),
Hyden will hit in all six rota
tions.
"With John Hyden, San
Diego State has a potent offense
that's hard to stop," said Cardi
nal coach Ruben Nieves. "They
lost a lot of players last year,
but somehow they were able to
put everything together early
on."
However, that is not the case
with UC-San Diego. The Tri
tons are trying to shake a hor
rendous 1-18 mark, which land
ed them in the MPSF cellar last
season.
The Tritons biggest disad
vantage will be its small size.
Standing at 6-2, junior outside
hitter Steve Kremser is UCSD's
best all-around player, accord
ing to Nieves. Joining him on
this offense will be 6-6 junior
middle blocker Tyson Kerr â€”
the Triton's only spiker over 6-
4.
Meanwhile, five of Stanford's
six starters on Saturday will
tower above the 6-4 mark.
"I have confidence that our
team should beat both San
Diego and San Diego State this
weekend," Ceman said. "It's
irrelevant whether I'm in the
lineup or not, we're just a bet
ter team. With San Diego State
we might have to worry a little
though, because they are shap
ing up to be a pretty good team
themselves."
Nevertheless, with Ceman
out of the starting rotation,
Stanford has been concentrat
ing on building a solid offense
around the setting of freshman
Stewart Chong.
"Every setter sets different
ly, it's kind of like playing with
a different quarterback,"
Nieves said. "Our main focus
this week in practice was to get
used to Stewart on offense."
