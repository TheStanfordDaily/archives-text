# Swimmers host Texas
## 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
One would be well-advised not
to butt heads with a Longhorn.
Unless you're the Stanford
women's swimming squad. The
Cardinal will go head-to-head
tomorrow with perhaps the only
team in the nation capable of las
soing it down
The irony in the air should be
as thick as water when top
ranked Stanford meets second
ranked Texas at 1 p.m. in the de
Guerre waters. The Cardinal,
currently in the midst of a 42-
straight dual meet winning
streak, lost their last meet to a
Richard Quick-coached
Longhornsquad in 1988
"We've got to improve to beat
Texas," said Quick, now in his
sixth year as Stanford's coach.
"They're very strong in diving
and breaststroke, and those are
the two areas where we need to
really improve to compete with
them."
The meet should highlight
some fascinating races. Holding
the nation's best times in both
the 1000- and 1660* meter
freestyle, Cardinal freshman
Sarah Anderson will go up
against Texas' Toby Smith, who
has posted the second best times
in each of those events.
Lea Loveless, senior, has the
fourth fastest time in the nation
in the 100-meter backstroke,

while Texas' B.J. Bedford leads
tin' country with a time .22 sec
ond faster. In the 200-meter
backstroke, Loveless has a best
time in the 200 backstroke only
.04 behind the nation's best time
of Longhorn Whitney
11 edge pet h.
"The backstroke events are
key," Quick said. "We've also got
to break up their breaststroke
and get second or third in that
event."
Stanford's nation-leading 400-
meter freestyle relay team, which
qualified for the NCAA tourna
ment last weekend in Los Ange
les, will race against the third
ranked relay squad from Texas.
Stanford's Jenny Thompson, a
junior who is number one in the
country in the 200-meter individ
ual medley, will face the third
best 1M swimmer in Bedford.
Both teams are undefeated
this season, but a blemish will
exist for one team after Satur
day.
"Their (Texas') meet against
Florida (last weekend) was out
standing," Quick said. "If they
swim the times they've swum so
far and we swim the times we've
swum so far, they're going to
beat us."
Perhaps the greatest faults of
the Cardinal squad lies in diving
and breaststroke swimming.
"With the advantage they've got
in diving, we've also got to do very
well in the relays," Quick said.
