# Wrestlers gear up for full weekend
## Grapplers host Fullerton tonight, then head to All-Cal Invite 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
The same old issue keeps nag
ging wrestling head coach Chris
Horpel.
"The one thing I was con
cerned about at the beginning of
the year was inexperience," Hor
pel said. "Ultimately, that has
made us a pretty mediocre dual
meet team."
The Cardinal wrestlers will try
to raise their dual meet record of
2-6 against Cal State Fullerton in
Burnham Pavilion tonight.
Tomorrow they head to San
Francisco State for the All-Cal
Invite, featuring all seven
wrestling schools in California, to
determine the state champions of
college wrestling.
A victory against Cal State
Fullerton is no small order, espe
cially considering the temporary
absence of two key starters.
Senior co-captain Lance Johnson

(150 pounds) will be unable to
compete this weekend due to
knee surgery he is having today.
Sophomore Matt Cano (126) will
also forgo the weekend's competi
tions due to an injured knee.
Both athletes are determined to
recover in time for the Pacific 10
Championships, only two weeks
away.
"I'm going to work hard and
see what happens," Cano said. "I
don't think there's anyone in the
Pac-lOs that I can't beat when
I'm wrestling my best."
The two significant gaps in the
lineup will require some shuffling
around among the ten starters
this weekend. Sophomore Ed
Medina, normally a 134-pounder,
will drop weight to compete in
Cano's place against Fullerton.
Sophomore Tod Surmon, who
has had a successful record in the
158 division, will compete at 150.
This adjustment starts a chain
reaction that will drop most

starters one division below their
usual weight.
Fullerton has proved to have
widespread talent scattered
among its starters. Stanford
encountered the Titans both at
the Oregon Classic and the Las
Vegas Invitational in December.
Jeff Maes (126) and Kenny Work
man (142) are expected to be
Stanford's two biggest threats
while Christian Holiday (158)
and Dwayne Buth (190) placed
second in the Oregon Classic.
Horpel favors the Cardinal at
the 134 and 150 matches, as
Jackson and Surmon have had
impressive wins lately. Jackson
leads the squad in team points
and posts an overall record of 19-
6. Surmon, with an overall record
of 9-2, is currently third in team
points.
"(Fullerton | is favored,
although they may be going
through the same midseason
injuries we are," Horpel said.

Horpel is quick to credit the
Cardinal with achieving a great
deal of progress during the sea
son, although he says the second
stringers do not have the skill
and experience to optimally bal
ance out the team.
At the All-Cal Invite tomor
row, those second-stringers will
have a chance to compete as
teams are allowed to enter two
wrestlers in every weight divi
sion. Because the Cardinal is cur
rently suffering from injuries,
Horpel plans to bring only one
athlete for the 177, 190, and
heavyweight divisions.
"This will give exposure to
some guys who have been waiting
in the wings for a while," Horpel
said.
Horpel speculates that Fresno
State and Cal State Bakersfleld
will be at the top of the pack. "It
will be interesting to see how oth
ers do. A lot will depend on who's
banged up or not," he said.
