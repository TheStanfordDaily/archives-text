# Softball launches a new era

When Stanford's varsity softball team begins its sea
son Sunday with a visit to St. Mary's, it will hopefully
begin a new era in Cardinal softball, said head coach
Sandy Pearce.
This period will be launched by a new generation of
players, as the only returners from last year's club are
sophomore Toni Marengo, and juniors Caryn Okinaga
and Karla Starr. Last year's team struggled in the
Pacific 10 Conference, but this year's squad has been
granted a one-year exemption from the conference due
to the low number of players that were on the roster in
November.
The team will play a revised schedule against most
ly Division 1 opponents and will also be fully funded for
the first time. This increased funding has already paid
dividends, as Stanford has secured three recruits for
next year's club.
Pearce is no stranger to building softball programs
from scratch. When Pearce became head coach at UC-
Santa Barbara in July 1991, the softball program was
on the verge of elimination. Under her guidance, Santa
Barbara improved from 18-45 to 19-29 her first year
and 22-29 her second year.
Her husband, Andv Pearce, served as an assistant
coach with Sandy at Santa Barbara, and will also hold
that position at Stanford.
The key ingredient to building this year's team will
be the development of young pitchers. Young talent is
abundant on the Cardinal pitching staff, composed of
freshmen Angela Webb, Katie Beattie and Summer
Lee.
Coach Pearce has been focusing on the development

of her rookie hurlers, with an emphasis on the place
ment and movement of their pitches. While not neces
sarily an overpowering staff, each pitcher has the poten
tial to outsmart opposing batters, according to Pearce.
The young pitchers will be guided by Lynn Ander
son, the talented, experienced Cardinal catcher. A
sophomore transfer student, Anderson won all-confer
ence recognition last year as Yale's starting catcher.
"Lynn came in to the program new and was voted
captain," Sandy Pearce said. "She's a natural leader by
example and the girls respect her."
The starting infield is perhaps the team's biggest
strength. Beattie will start at first base and should pro
vide power and speed to the heart of the batting order.
At the "hot corner" will be third basemen Marengo, a
solid line drive hitter.
Up the middle, Stanford will rely on the strong
defensive skills of Lee at shortstop and Okinaga at sec
ond base. When not on the mound, Angela Webb will
also be a member of the infield. Freshman Shawna
Escobar, a speedy switch hitter, is expected to be a valu
able utility player.
Junior Eva Hunker and freshmen Melissa Atienza
and Megan Mackh, three former infielders, have been
working on using their defensive skills in their new
roles as Stanford's starting outfielders. Junior Allison
Barrett and sophomore Gemma Rowley should also see
considerable playing time patrolling the deep territo
ries, while sophomore Amanda Renteria should add
speed when she joins the team at the conclusion of the
basketball season.
When this youthful club swings into action this
weekend, they hope to prove that Stanford softball is on
the rise.
