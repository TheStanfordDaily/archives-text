## Hurlers at Fresno

The No. 12 Cardinal baseball team will leave the friendly confines
of Sunken Diamond Cor the first time this season as it travels to Fres
no State for a weekend series with the No. 38 Bulldogs. season,
the two teams met at Sunken Diamond and Stanford swept all three
games.
The Cardinal will face a much tougher Fresno State team than last
year, however. "I think the big difference is that it's very difficult to
beat them [at Fresno]," said Stanford coach Mark Marquess. " They
have tremendous fan support and they always play much better at
home than they do on the road."
Since most of Stanford's lineup consists of freshmen and sopho
mores, very few of the players have made the trip to Fresno. One
notable exception is Cardinal first baseman Dusty Allen, junior.
"It's a really tough place to play since they sell out almost every
game," Allen said. "It's a great atmosphere for baseball, though.
Maybe that will fire us up on offense."
The Cardinal will need precisely that if it hopes to bounce back
from a tough 1-0 loss to underdog St. Mary's on Tuesday. Stanford
continues to be inconsistent offensively — after scoring 16 runs in
three games against Fullerton last weekend, the Cardinal has now
failed to score in 15 innings.
The young Stanford pitching staff has responded to this lack of
run support by becoming ever more stingy.
Last Sunday, despite taking the loss, freshman Tom Reimers put
in a spectacular long-relief appearance, going 7 2/3 innings and only
allowing one run.
On Tuesday, sophomore lefthander Dan Reed had his best outing
of the season and arguably one of the best in his career, holding St.
Mary's hitless for six innings while striking out four and walking two.
