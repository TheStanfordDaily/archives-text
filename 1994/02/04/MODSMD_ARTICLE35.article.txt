While the rest of the team
takes a sorely needed break,
four members of the Stanford
men's tennis team will travel to
Dallas this weekend to compete
at the Rolex National Indoors
Tournament.
Senior Michael Flanagan,
ranked fourth in the Intercolle
giate Tennis Association's fall
rankings, was invited to the
tournament as an at-large
selection, based mostly on fall
tournament results. A native of
Dallas, Flanagan will be a
threat to capture the tourna
ment title in front of the home
crowd.
Flanagan will be accompa
nied in the singles draw by
sophomore Jim Thomas, the
No. 6-ranked player in the

Rolex-ITA fall rankings.
Thomas qualified for the tour
nament by winning the Rolex
Regional Championship last
fall, but has been troubled by
shoulder problems since.
Senior Vimal Patel and
sophomore Jeff Salzenstein,
who make up the seventh
ranked doubles team, were also
invited as an at-large selection.
The doubles team of Flana
gan and senior Chris Cocotos,
one of the top-ranked teams in
the country, was also offered an
at-large bid, but Cocotos
declined to make the trip.
The weekend's break will
give the rest of the team an
opportunity to "get well,"
according to head coach Dick
Gould.
