NEWARK. N.J. (AP) — A
priest whose fingertip was sev
ered in a fall had it reattached,
thanks to a parishioner who
found it six hours later and
brought it to the hospital on a.
paper plate.
Rev. Paul Lehman, pastor at
St. Antoninus Roman Catholic
Church, was waiting last
Friday at the University
Hospital emergency room when
parishioner Estelle Harris came
to visit.
Harris, who heard of the
priest's accident when she
arrived for noon Mass, said doc
tors suggested somebody look
for the missing finger.
"I went back to dig around in
the ice and snow," Harris said.
"I kept praying and begging
God to direct me to it. All of a
sudden there it was sitting on a
mound of snow."
She rushed back to the hospi
-

tal with the frozen finger on a
paper plate, and caught Lehman
being wheeled into surgery.
"I said, 'Father Paul, here's
your finger,' " she recalled. "He
took it, the elevator door closed
and they took him up. It was
very dramatic."
Billboard Bovine Suit
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
Undersea explorer Jacques
Cousteau has agreed to settle a
$1.2 million trademark-infringe
ment suit against Clover-
Stornetta Farms, which used a
cow named "Jacques Cowsteau"
in its advertising campaign.
Last year, the company put
up a billboard on a highway in
Sonoma County featuring its
longtime advertising symbol,
Clothe Cow, in a wet suit and
snorkeling gear.
Cousteau and his 300,000-
member organization filed a
federal court suit in November,

saying Cousteau was being
made to look like a pitchman
for the dairy and was subjected
to ridicule.
Clover said it was all in fun
and that Clo was no more likely
to be mistaken for a human
than she was in her past incar
nation as Christopher
Cowlumbus.
