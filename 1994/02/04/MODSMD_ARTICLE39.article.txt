# Greek leaders meet to plan rush activities, policies
## 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
There will be a few more groups, a few
more anticipatory events, longer parties
and a little less alcohol at Rush this year.
But prospective fraternity and sorority
members can look forward to all the fun
and foibles of the Greek selection process
their predecessors had, held this year April
4-18 for fraternities and April 5-12 for
sororities.
Wednesday night, leaders of Stanford
fraternities and sororities met with their
respective communities to make plans and
minor adjustments for both Rush and
Greek Week, three days of events that will
culminate in a campus-wide party. "It's to
build the bond of brotherhood," said Delta
Kappa Epsilon member Tom Baranowski
about the events.
In addition, the Interfraternity Council

voted on some logistical changes and
stricter enforcement of the Rush no-alco
hol rule. According to Baranowski, the
council's vice president of operations,
Rush monitors from other fraternities will
be present at parties to enforce the rule,
with violations carrying a fine of up to
$5,000.
"I personally know at least a handful of
fraternities |that violated the policy last
year)," Baranowski said. "It was more a
misunderstood policy than an unenforced
one."
Baranowski also said all of last year's
alcohol violations occurred in the first
week and were subsequently straightened
out. Though the University conducted
investigations of two incidents, one which
involved the sighting of a rushee and fra
ternity member at a bar, all were found not
guilty. This year, though, such an episode
would be penalized by the Interfraternity

Council.
Greek leaders doubted Delta Lambda
Phi, a new gay fraternity, would participate
in formal Rush with the campus' 18 other
fraternities since they are not a part of the
Interfraternity Council and do not have a
national charter. Delta Upsilon and Theta
Delta Chi, two unhoused fraternities, will
hold their inaugural Rushes this year. All
together, fraternities expect between 350
and 400 participants.
Kappa Delta Phi, the new Asian-Ameri
can sorority, will be holding separate
recruitment, or informal rush, the same
week of formal Rush. Rather than setting
up tents at Wilbur Field, recruits will like
ly be rushed in a less formal environment.
"We liked (the idea] better," said Char
lotte Khan, fundraising chair of the sorori
ty. "We're probably attracting a different
audience."
For the other six sororities, the expedi

tious Wilbur Field acquaintance parties
will be lengthened by 15 minutes apiece,
bringing the time to 30 minutes on the first
night and 90 minutes on the last.
"We wanted to increase the time that
rushees and sororities have to get to know
each other," said Katie Alberts, president
of the Intersorority Council.
In addition to the normal Rush week
activities and Greek Week plans, the soror
ities will hold dorm panels in each of the
freshman dorm clusters and starting Feb.
15 will provide Rush counselors â€” Greeks
temporarily dissociated from their sorority
for impartiality.
"It's a much more formal system than
frat Rush," Alberts said.
The Intersorority Council is also plan
ning a forum March 2 to discuss women's
issues in the Greek system. The forum will
cover issues of body image, sexual assault,
leadership and sexism.
