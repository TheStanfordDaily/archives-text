# Casper, Fac Sen reject statement on accreditation
## 
### Andy Dworkin Colleen Krueger Staff writers 
Aiming to protect Stanford
from the potentially invasive
overtures of its regional accredit
ing body, the Faculty Senate yes
terday voted to denounce the
Western Association of Schools
and Colleges' "Statement on Di
versity" and endorsed University
President Gerhard Casper's rejec
tion of the association's new eval
uation policies.
"No institution should be re
quired to demonstrate its commit
ment to diversity to the satisfac
tion of an external review panel,"
Casper said. "The commission is
attempting to insert itself in an
area in which it has no legitimate
standing."
While the country's six region
al accrediting bodies have tradi
tionally focused on academic and
institutional standards, WASC's
statement asks that the Universi
ty conform its diversity policies to
WASC standards. Accrediting as
sociations are responsible both for

certifying acade
mic quality and
granting federal
financial aid eli
gibility.
"(The State
ment on Diversi
ty] has gone well
beyond the tradi
tional role of ac
creditation,

which is to insure that institu
tions meet minimum standards of
education and resources," Casper
said.
The senate's Steering Commit
tee originally drafted two resolu
tions — one which rejected the
document for its presumptuous
meddling into University policy
and the other for its sanction of
discrimination on the basis of sex
ual orientation.
But while debating the resolu
tion addressing sexual orienta
tion, several senators expressed
concern that taking exception to
certain specific passages under
mined the University's over-rid


Rice
ing and fundamental objection to
imposed diversity standards.
"We don't want them to deal
with diversity at all," said Chem
istry Prof. John Brauman, adding
that he "didn't even want to think
about, much less address" the
statement's possible implementa
tion.
In the course of the meeting,
the resolution addressing discrim
ination on the basis of sexual ori
entation was incorporated into the
broader resolution on interven
tion. The combined measure
passed unanimously.
Casper's statement also reflect
ed dissatisfaction with WASC's
plan to evaluate schools primarily
on the quality of their teaching
and "on their ability to demon
strate positive outcomes for stu
dents."
"I will do everything possible to
resist this kind of intrusion on the
part of an outside agency," he said.
WASC, which asked its member
institutions to comment on the
proposed statement, will decide
whether to adopt the new policy
later this month.Crediting bodies
have customarily evaluated insti
tutions based on issues such as
curriculum, faculty tenure and the
number of books housed at the
school.
In other news, the senate heard
the results of a study on Universi
ty programs aimed at helping fac
ulty members obtain housing.
A report from the Committee
on Housing Policies and Programs
recommended that Stanford
change existing programs and add
new ones that will help faculty
members finance homes in the
expensive housing market around
the University.
The committee suggested that a
Graduated Payment Mortgage
plan — a plan that allows home
buyers to initially make lower pay
ments than their interest rates
would suggest — be added to types
of loans called "COIN/Lathrop"
and "10/30" loans.
Additionally, the group recom

mended a new program to help
people with COIN/Lathrop loans
refinance first mortgages. The
commission suggested that the
University adjust the interest
rates on Lathrop loans as the
housing market changes, and
asked that the University try to
offer loans at rates as competitive
as possible.
Provost Condoleezza Rice said
all of these recommendations are
being put into practice.
The committee made other sug
gestions that were not accepted,
however. The other proposals
included expanding the Housing
Alliance Program, or HAP, a pro
gram that adds to the salaries of
first-time home buyers. The com
mittee recommended that a new
HAP program for those who rent
property lx> started, as well as a
second HAP program for faculty at
the time they receive tenure.
Finally, the committee recom
mended exceptions to the current
HAP loan rules, including allow
ing loans to employees who want
to buy a house outside a 15-mile
radius from campus. Currently
only those who want to buy within
the 15-mile zone qualify for HAP.
Rice said she has rejected these
proposals, contending that they
are not financially feasible for the
University, especially when it is
trying to cut its budget.
Also yesterday, Rice announced
that Academic Secretary Marion
Lewenstein has decided to resign
from her post and return to full
time teaching in the Communica
tion Department. The senate's
Committee on Committees has
submitted a list of names to Rice,
who will choose people from the
list to serve on a search committee
to find a replacement for Lewen
stein.
"Marion has served us all very
well," Rice said. "My only regret is
that I didn't have longer to work
with her."
Casper also spoke briefly about
the budget cuts the University is
attempting to make. lie expressed
sympathy with those nervous
about the uncertainty of budget
cuts, and urged faculty members
to be wary of rumors that have
been circulating about the cuts.

ing body, the Faculty Senate yes
terday voted to denounce the
Western Association of Schools
and Colleges' "Statement on Di
versity" and endorsed University
President Gerhard Casper's rejec
tion of the association's new eval
uation policies.
"No institution should be re
quired to demonstrate its commit
ment to diversity to the satisfac
tion of an external review panel,"
Casper said. "The commission is
attempting to insert itself in an
area in which it has no legitimate
standing."
While the country's six region
al accrediting bodies have tradi
tionally focused on academic and
institutional standards, WASC's
statement asks that the Universi
ty conform its diversity policies to
WASC standards. Accrediting as
sociations are responsible both for

certifying acade
mic quality and
granting federal
financial aid eli
gibility.
"(The State
ment on Diversi
ty] has gone well
beyond the tradi
tional role of ac
creditation,

which is to insure that institu
tions meet minimum standards of
education and resources," Casper
said.
The senate's Steering Commit
tee originally drafted two resolu
tions — one which rejected the
document for its presumptuous
meddling into University policy
and the other for its sanction of
discrimination on the basis of sex
ual orientation.
But while debating the resolu
tion addressing sexual orienta
tion, several senators expressed
concern that taking exception to
certain specific passages under
mined the University's over-rid


Rice
ing and fundamental objection to
imposed diversity standards.
"We don't want them to deal
with diversity at all," said Chem
istry Prof. John Brauman, adding
that he "didn't even want to think
about, much less address" the
statement's possible implementa
tion.
In the course of the meeting,
the resolution addressing discrim
ination on the basis of sexual ori
entation was incorporated into the
broader resolution on interven
tion. The combined measure
passed unanimously.
Casper's statement also reflect
ed dissatisfaction with WASC's
plan to evaluate schools primarily
on the quality of their teaching
and "on their ability to demon
strate positive outcomes for stu
dents."
"I will do everything possible to
resist this kind of intrusion on the
part of an outside agency," he said.
WASC, which asked its member
institutions to comment on the
proposed statement, will decide
whether to adopt the new policy
later this month.Crediting bodies
have customarily evaluated insti
tutions based on issues such as
curriculum, faculty tenure and the
number of books housed at the
school.
In other news, the senate heard
the results of a study on Universi
ty programs aimed at helping fac
ulty members obtain housing.
A report from the Committee
on Housing Policies and Programs
recommended that Stanford
change existing programs and add
new ones that will help faculty
members finance homes in the
expensive housing market around
the University.
The committee suggested that a
Graduated Payment Mortgage
plan — a plan that allows home
buyers to initially make lower pay
ments than their interest rates
would suggest — be added to types
of loans called "COIN/Lathrop"
and "10/30" loans.
Additionally, the group recom

mended a new program to help
people with COIN/Lathrop loans
refinance first mortgages. The
commission suggested that the
University adjust the interest
rates on Lathrop loans as the
housing market changes, and
asked that the University try to
offer loans at rates as competitive
as possible.
Provost Condoleezza Rice said
all of these recommendations are
being put into practice.
The committee made other sug
gestions that were not accepted,
however. The other proposals
included expanding the Housing
Alliance Program, or HAP, a pro
gram that adds to the salaries of
first-time home buyers. The com
mittee recommended that a new
HAP program for those who rent
property lx> started, as well as a
second HAP program for faculty at
the time they receive tenure.
Finally, the committee recom
mended exceptions to the current
HAP loan rules, including allow
ing loans to employees who want
to buy a house outside a 15-mile
radius from campus. Currently
only those who want to buy within
the 15-mile zone qualify for HAP.
Rice said she has rejected these
proposals, contending that they
are not financially feasible for the
University, especially when it is
trying to cut its budget.
Also yesterday, Rice announced
that Academic Secretary Marion
Lewenstein has decided to resign
from her post and return to full
time teaching in the Communica
tion Department. The senate's
Committee on Committees has
submitted a list of names to Rice,
who will choose people from the
list to serve on a search committee
to find a replacement for Lewen
stein.
"Marion has served us all very
well," Rice said. "My only regret is
that I didn't have longer to work
with her."
Casper also spoke briefly about
the budget cuts the University is
attempting to make. lie expressed
sympathy with those nervous
about the uncertainty of budget
cuts, and urged faculty members
to be wary of rumors that have
been circulating about the cuts.
