Aiming to protect Stanford
from the potentially invasive
overtures of its regional accredit
ing body, the Faculty Senate yes
terday voted to denounce the
Western Association of Schools
and Colleges' "Statement on Di

President Gerhard Casper's rejec

institutional standards, WASC's

granting federal
financial aid eli
gibility.
"(The State

beyond the tradi
tional role of ac
creditation,

which is to insure that institu
tions meet minimum standards of
education and resources," Casper
said.
The senate's Steering Commit

tions â€” one which rejected the
document for its presumptuous
meddling into University policy
and the other for its sanction of
discrimination on the basis of sex
ual orientation.
But while debating the resolu
tion addressing sexual orienta
tion, several senators expressed
concern that taking exception to
certain specific passages under
mined the University's over-rid
