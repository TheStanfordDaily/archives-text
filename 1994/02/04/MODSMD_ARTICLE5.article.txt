# COP's tuition-cap plan: 2% above inflation
## 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
University administrators may not
have needed the Council of Presidents
to determine that students don't like
tuition increases, but that's just what
the COP told Provost Condoleezza Rice
in anticipation of Monday's Hoard of
Trustees meeting to decide next year's
tuition rates.
In recent meetings with Rice and

other University budget planners, the
COP suggested that the University cap
tuition increases at 2 percent above in
flation for the next two years.
Rice reportedly hasn't promised
anything, but she said yesterday that
she would take the COP's suggestion
into consideration before presenting
her tuition proposal to the trustees.
"It's great that the COP is thinking
about these issues," she said. But while
she said tuition will definitely increase,

she did not say whether she will pro
pose the COP's plan.
"I'm optimistic about the actual tu
ition rate being close to what we pro
posed," COP member Jason Snyder
said. "I'm sure they won't be as ex
treme as the past two years."
In 1991, the board agreed to keep fu
ture tuition increases to 1 percent
above the rate of inflation — a pledge
they soon broke. The following year,
trustees raised tuition by 9.5 percent,

and last year, the board approved a 7.5
percent increase, raising tuition to
$17,775, or $24,310 with room and
board.
According to COP member Ying-
Ying Goh, the student leaders did not
base their 2 percent figure on an analy
sis of the University's budget. She said
they decided on the number because it
was a "compromise" between the 1-
percent-above-inflation target and
the actual increases over the past
two years.
"We would like to go back to 1
percent (above inflation) or even
just keeping up with inflation,"
Snyder said, but he added that the
COP decided on 2 percent as a
"realistic, moderate increase" that
would serve as a "first, incremen
tal step."
If the COP's proposal is adopt
ed and inflation remains at a pro
jected 3 percent, tuition would be
$ 18,664 next year.
Goh said adoption of the pro
posal would be "a symbol of a com
mitment bv the University" to
hold tuition increases down.
Board chair John Freidenrich
was reluctant to discuss the pro
posal because he hadn't seen it,
but he said he did not like the idea
of a pledge.
"Commitments, pledges, 'read
my lips' kind of things don't work
very well," he said, "because
you're tying yourself into some
thing (when) you never know
what the future's going to look
like."
The previous target was a "rea
sonable thing to attempt to do,"
Freidenrich said, but he added
that "what looks appropriate at

one period may not be appropriate
in another period."
COP member Ron Hrown said
the inflexibility of a cap was real
ly the point of the proposal. "A
cap reminds the University that it
has to work within certain con
straints," he said, adding that
economics classes have taught
him that such caps give adminis
trators incentives to control costs.
Snyder also stressed the impor
tance of a two-year commitment,
but conceded that the board may
have other budgetary factors to
consider. "1 don't know what the
actual feasibility of |a board com
mitment 1 is, but if we are coming
up with a realistic proposal and
they are looking closely at it, we
can't really ask for anything
more," he said.
Hrown added that tuition
increases deter students from
enrolling and decrease alumni giv
ing. "It's tough for a lot of stu
dents to give to a school when they
still owe money," he said.
Freidenrich defended past
tuition increases as the result of
unexpected budget woes. "I would
have preferred that we increase
tuition less," he said, "but the
realities of operating the Universi
ty have forced us to look at all of
our revenue sources and all of our
costs."
Brown disagreed. "The spikes
that occurred over the past two
years have been too high," he said.
