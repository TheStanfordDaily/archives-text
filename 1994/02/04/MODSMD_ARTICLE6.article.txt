Hike thefts reached a record high last
year, according to statistics released this
week by the Stanford Department of Public
Safety.
The rate soared 21.5 percent to 829 re
ported thefts, up from 682 in 1992.
The yearly campus crime figures also
show low rates of violent crime and fewer
incidents of vehicular burglary.
"From a personal safety standard, (Stan
ford | is pretty safe," said Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer. "Property crime is
our biggest problem, because there's so
much stuff around here."
There has been a sharp upward trend in
the number of campus bike thefts since
1990, which Niemeyer attributes to
thieves' new-found ability to break the U

locks that many students use.
Police arrested approximately 12 bike
thieves last year, Niemeyer said. Most ar
rests were made as a result of students call
ing police to report suspicious activity.
Meanwhile, computer thefts increased
by 75 percent, from 24 in 1992 to 42 last
year. Niemeyer believes this increase is con
nected to a known felon whom police found
sleeping on campus in December.
The suspect, who has previously pled
guilty to two campus burglaries, was found
with records detailing sales of computers,
which Niemeyer speculates were related to
a black market operation that stretches to
the Philippines and other Third World na
tions. Police are continuing their investiga
tion.
Vehicle burglaries were down to 137, a
