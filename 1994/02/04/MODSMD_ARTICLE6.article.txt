# Computer, bike thefts soar
## 1993 crime stats show decline in auto burglary 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Hike thefts reached a record high last
year, according to statistics released this
week by the Stanford Department of Public
Safety.
The rate soared 21.5 percent to 829 re
ported thefts, up from 682 in 1992.
The yearly campus crime figures also
show low rates of violent crime and fewer
incidents of vehicular burglary.
"From a personal safety standard, (Stan
ford | is pretty safe," said Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer. "Property crime is
our biggest problem, because there's so
much stuff around here."
There has been a sharp upward trend in
the number of campus bike thefts since
1990, which Niemeyer attributes to
thieves' new-found ability to break the U

locks that many students use.
Police arrested approximately 12 bike
thieves last year, Niemeyer said. Most ar
rests were made as a result of students call
ing police to report suspicious activity.
Meanwhile, computer thefts increased
by 75 percent, from 24 in 1992 to 42 last
year. Niemeyer believes this increase is con
nected to a known felon whom police found
sleeping on campus in December.
The suspect, who has previously pled
guilty to two campus burglaries, was found
with records detailing sales of computers,
which Niemeyer speculates were related to
a black market operation that stretches to
the Philippines and other Third World na
tions. Police are continuing their investiga
tion.
Vehicle burglaries were down to 137, a

decrease of 53.5 percent. Accord
ing to Niemeyer, police have been
making a concerted effort to do
more patrolling. He also connect
ed the decrease to more people
using car alarms and pull-out car
stereos.
The number of reported cam
pus rapes stayed at zero for the
third straight year. Niemeyer
said this number merely reflects
how many people filed police
reports with the department.
There were only six aggravat
ed assaults and no reported sex
assaults last year. However,
other sex offenses — such as
peeping and indecent exposure —
jumped from 8 incidents to 22.
Trespassing crimes went up
to 35 incidents, a 94.4 percent
increase from 18 crimes the pre
vious year.

Police officers issued 37,706
parking citations last year, down
from 43,703 the previous year.
Police also issued 45 citations for
drunk driving in 1993.
There were no reported inci
dents of hate crimes last year.
Police define hate crimes as graf
fiti or flyers that are racist in
nature, said Niemeyer.
Eight cases of arson occurred
in 1993, up from five in 1992.
Dan Smith, manager of the
department's Special Services
Division, said that bike registra
tion is one of the main contribut
ing factors to the bike theft prob
lem. "Anything you can do to get
your bike back is worth doing,"
Smith said. Bikes can be regis
tered at either Tresidder Union
or the Transportation Office for
$3.50.
Students should also make
certain to lock their bikes to fixed
objects. "That way the thief has
to work out in the open," Smith
said.
