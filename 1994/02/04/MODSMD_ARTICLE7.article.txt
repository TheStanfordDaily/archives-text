### Vivien Wang Staff writer 
Like Joshua gathering his peo
ple and urging them to look back
at their past, the Rev. Floyd
Thompkins Jr. urged African-
Americans to remember their his
tory in a speech last night at Kres
ge Auditorium attended by about
80 people.
Part of a diverse program titled
"Celebrating Black Minds: Inno
vators from our Ancestors to our
Children" that kicked off Black
Liberation Month 1994, Thomp
kins held up the story of Joshua
from the Bible as an example for
the black audience. He urged
them to "look back and remem
ber slavery and see the struggle
of the journey.
"We used to look back and see
in slavery the dignity of people
who could exist in such terrible
conditions," he said.
Thompkins also stressed the
need for African-Americans to
fight mediocrity. He related a
tale of high school classmates
who argued about who got the
lowest grades. "How dare they!"
he thundered. "How dare they
believe that being black was low
and awesome. How dare we
believe that mediocrity is our
heritage. I expect black students
to be the best in what they do."
The reverend told the audi
ence that each of them would be
"the first black something." But
he said that being a pioneer was
more of a burden than an honor.
As a student at Princeton,
Thompkins was "the first black
to work in this town." At Stan
ford, he was the "first black to be
associate dean of the chapel." To
him, this signified "how long
they kept you out, how begrudg
ingly they let you in."
He reminded the audience
that Joshua warned against lack

of vision, which can destroy the
journey. "You see black people
who see themselves from the
eyes of the media, who have told
us we are not good enough," he
said. To him, the problem was
not "underfunding, but undervi
sion .. . Everything about you
when you look in the mirror God
intended to be there, that's who
you are.
"The question is not 'can you
be black?' but 'do you have the
strength to be black?' " he added.
Thompkins closed by para
phrasing Joshua, saying "you
can't make it trying to be who
you're not." He urged everyone
to know "who you are and where
your people are going. If we can
not be sure of who we are, then
the whole thing is over already."
In a similar vein, A.J. Robin
son, a senior majoring in political
science and psychology, stressed
the need for blacks to recognize
each other's successes. "Black
neglect is not only worse than
white racism, but leaves our chil
dren with scars."
He lamented that "we see it
happening yet we do not seem to
care ... we must care." As co
founder of Students Offering
Alternative Realities (SOAR), an
academic assistance and mentor
ing program for East Palo Alto
students, he said that "there is
no job more important than rais

ing the self-esteem of these
kids."
DeAdrea Fontaine, a SOAR
student and a junior at Carlmont
High School in East Palo Alto,
also spoke on black neglect. "We
ignore each other and do not
applaud each other's efforts. As
black teens, we need to change
our attitude, not to be so easily
discouraged."
Fontaine noted that blacks
have come a long way in society,
but "we're only halfway there.
Everyone has had their turn.
Don't you think it's ours?"
Jamell Walker, a junior
majoring in sociology and
SOAR's other co-founder, said
that "we want students to real
ize that we as a community care
about their well-being." She
added that she wanted East Palo
Alto youths to have as much
opportunity as their "Palo Alto
counterparts."
Also included in the program
was the debut of "Theatre at the
Crossroads," which featured
poetry reading by Natasha
Humphries and a speech perfor
mance by freshman Kalimah
Fergus. Junior Jennifer Grim,
principal flautist of the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra, played
Debussy's "Syrinx," and fresh
man Jabari Anderson sung an a
capella rendition of the Black
National Anthem.
