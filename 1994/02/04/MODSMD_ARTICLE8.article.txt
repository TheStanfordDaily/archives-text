# Students organize week to address body image

In an attempt to make students more
accepting of their bodies, three Stanford
seniors have organized a week dedicated
to addressing issues related to body image
and self-esteem, the first in the Universi
ty's history.
"Reclaiming Our Bodies: Examining
Body Image at Stanford" is a series of
panel discussions, speakers, and dorm
based activities that will take place Feb. 6-
10 Student coordinators Kamy Wicoff,
Andi Marmor and Elizabeth Springer
said the goal of the week is to raise aware
ness and provide positive reinforcement
for students about body image.
"As opposed to the traditional empha
sis upon the specific and severe manifes
tations of body image problems like
anorexia and bulimia, this week intends
to address how body image affects all

Stanford students: men and women,
freshman and seniors, techies and fuzzies
and students of all ethnicities," Springer
said.
The awareness week includes discus
sions between men and women about
body image, speakers including former
model Ann Simonton and Psychiatry Pro
fessor Regina Casper presentations by
Stanford athletes and sorority members,
and a panel discussion given by represen
tatives from the Disability Resource Cen
ter.
Wicoff, a resident assistant at the
Suites, said she thought of the idea for the
week when she saw the need to deal with
student misconceptions about body
image.
"I think this is a problem that occurs in
our society as a whole, but that it is more

prevalent at Stanford because
you're dealing with a group of
very driven, very capable people
who, when they come here, are
averaged out and experience a loss
of control," she said. "Our bodies
are one thing we can control, but
unfortunately, that form of con
trol can sometimes be detrimental
to our health and self-esteem."
Wicoff and Springer proposed
the idea for an awareness week to
Marmor, a member of REACH —
Research Education and Choices
for Health — a campus group
that deals with body image, self
esteem and eating disorders. The
three seniors then approached
several campus organizations,
including the Office of Residen
tial Education, with their plan.
Res Ed program assistant
Susan Cass said, "We are really
proud of the initiative these
women have taken."
The results of a 1990 Counsel
ing and Psychological Services
Health Survey showed that 48
percent of undergraduate women
and 33 percent of undergraduate
men were often or always unsatis
fied with their bodies. Dr. Karen
Huang, a staff psychologist at
CAPS, said that while most
women are concerned with weight
gain and loss, men tend to worry
about muscle mass and hair loss.
According to Huang, an indi
vidual's body image and self
esteem is dependent upon cultural
and societal pressures to live up to
a certain ideal. "Body image
encompasses the attitudes, per
ceptions, feelings, and reactions
that we have to our looks," she
said. "This may or may not corre
spond to how we actually look to
other people."
Along with CAPS, other cam
pus centers and organizations
that are sponsoring the week
include Res Ed, the Women's Cen
ter, the Disability Resource Cen
ter and the Inter-Sorority Coun

cil.
Marmor said the week is
intended to show that body image
can be a positive thing when peo
ple learn to appreciate and
respect their bodies as separate
from themselves. "Body image
. . . becomes a problem when peo
ple see their bodies as defining
who they are," she said.
A key goal of the week is to
raise awareness of how body
image and self-esteem affects all
segments of the Stanford popula
tion. Junior Muffy Davis, wheel
chair bound due to a skiing acci
dent five years ago, said she
hoped to inform others about
what body image means to people
with disabilities through her
panel discussion.
"I want students to realize
that with a disability, your body
image changes - your sense of self
comes more from your spiritual
side, rather than your physical
side," she said.
All of the scheduled program
ming for the week will take place
in various dorms and houses on
campus. Resident assistants are
encouraged to supplement the
week with in-dorm activities and
discussions on the issue. "Within
the safe community environment
of the dorm, we are hoping stu
dents may be more comfortable to
tackle intimate, personal issues
relating to body image and self
esteem," Springer said.
Women's Center Coordinator
Rebecca Bliss worked with
Wicoff, Marmor and Springer to
plan the schedule of events for
the Awareness week. The orga
nizers used a sample copy of a cal
endar from Brown University
which has had a body image
awareness week for the past five
years — provided by Bliss, a grad
uate of Brown.
The costs of the body image
awareness week equal about
$2,000, Springer said.
Other student collaborators
for the week include senior Alli
son Axtell and juniors Kara Imm,
Susan Thomas and Jinoos Yaz
dany.
