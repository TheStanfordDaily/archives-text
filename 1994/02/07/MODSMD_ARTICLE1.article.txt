# Hospital may have violated EPA standards
## New findings not expected to hamper continuing talks

While Stanford and the California Environmental
Protection Agency continue to bring the University
into compliance with state regulations, a new batch of
alleged violations has been thrown into the mix.
CEPA spokesman Allan Hirsch said the University
was informed in January about five alleged violations
stemming from an incident at Stanford University
Hospital in September. According to the Report of Vi
olation, a hospital employee combined two chemicals
to cause an exothermic reaction and then dumped the
hazardous mixture into the sanitary sewers.
The cited violations include unauthorized disposal,
failure to take precautions to prevent a release and
failure to make a hazardous waste determination.
Within the next few weeks, the University will
issue a report responding to the alleged violations,
said Larry Gibbs, Stanford's director of Environmen
tal Health and Safety. "Some of those we don't agree
were violations," he said. "We need to evaluate these
issues ourselves and determine if we agree that there
was indeed a violation."
However, Hirsch said the CEPA sees the violations
as important. "We view those violations very serious
ly. It was completely inappropriate for Stanford per
sonnel to have flushed those chemicals down the
drain. It shows that t here are still problems in the way
they are handling hazardous waste," he said. "We're
concerned that they were unable to activate their
emergency plan."
CEPA and the University are in an ongoing process
of negotiations stemming from violations as old as
1988. Twenty-eight of the violations were discovered
during an inspection in the spring of 1992 of the En
vironmental Safety Facility, the University's central
waste collection and storage site.
