# Islamic leader praised
## Speaker lauds Louis Farrakhan 
### Gina Lee Staff writer 
Imam Warith Deen Muhammad,
son of the Nation of Islam's late
founder, praised Louis Farrakhan
and condemned an earlier Black
Islamic leader in a speech Saturday
honoring Black Liberation Month.
Muhammad also criticized a Far
rakhan aide for anti-Semitic and
anti-white remarks the aide made
in a November speech at a New Jer
sey college.
"Minister Farrakhan's followers
will grow weaker and then wonder
why," he said to a crowd of more than
400 who filled Kresge Auditorium.
"They will realize they have been fed
food that creates malnutrition. Then
they will kx)k for fix*! that gives them
health and strength."
Muhammad said he was encour
aged by the disciplining of the aide
and saw it as a sign of hope for the
entire Nation of Islam, receiving
much applause from the audience
for the statement.
He called Farrakhan a "wise
man" and said that he hoped the
minister would preach in favor of a
united Muslim people with one reli
gion of Islam.

His speech became controversial
as Muhammad denounced the
teachings of an earlier Black Mus
lim leader, Wali Farad. He blamed
Farad for "appealing to the poor,
neglected black ghetto and the une
ducated naive black man."
He also accused Farad of "practic
ing false Islam," disagreeing with
Farad's claim that Islamics tire all
"God" and that the white man is a
"villain."
"The powerful truth of the Koran
finally drove me away from [Farad's]
teachings," he said.
Muhammad also spoke about the
fate and the general history of "the
black man."
In conclusion, Muhammad dis
couraged reverse racism and said
that African-Americans should lead
by example. "Our role in America
should be to lead Americans and if
we don't, something is wrong — ter
ribly wrong," he said.
During a question-and-answer
period, many Muslims in the audi
ence stood up and thanked Muham
mad for his inspirational role, some
chanting prayers in Arabic.
Before Muhammed's speech,
some Muslims prayed on the lawn
outside Kresge.
