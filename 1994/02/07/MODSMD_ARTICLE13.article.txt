New SAT introduced
PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) - High school stu
dents hoping to gain admission to college will take
a new version of the SAT beginning March 19
The new Scholastic Aptitude Test will not
contain a section on antonyms. Instead, it will
have more sentence-completion problems.
The verbal section will also contain fewer
reading passages, but the passages will be
longer. Students will also be asked to compare a
pair of passages on similar subjects.
In the mathematical section, students will be
allowed to bring along calculators. Further, the
new version will now have 10 free response
math questions.
"It's really a test requiring students to
think," said Anne Buckley of the College Board,
which helped to develop the test.
