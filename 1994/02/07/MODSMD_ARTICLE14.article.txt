SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) â€” U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali has asked
NAT() to approve air strikes on mortar
positions around Sarajevo to punish
attacks on civilians, a senior U.N. offi
cial said late yesterday.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organi
zation had been waiting for Boutros
(Jhali's request before authorizing the
air strikes. Bosnian Serbs have been
besieging Sarajevo for nearly two
years, and were blamed by most Sara
jevans for Saturday's attack on an
open market that killed 68 people.
"The secretary general sent a letter
this evening to NATO Secretary Gen
eral Manfred Woerner asking him to
take action to obtain as soon as possi
ble the authorization from the NATO
Council for the launching of air strikes

against artillery or mortar positions in
or around Sarajevo which are responsi
ble for attacks on civilian targets," the
official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
There was no immediate word on
when the NATO Council would meet,
but it was expected within the next two
days.
NATO voted in August to provide
air strikes if the United Nations
requested them. NATO leaders tough
ened their stance at a summit last
month in a bid to prevent a further
strangulation of Sarajevo.
The United Nations' top civilian
official for the former Yugoslavia,
Yasushi Akashi, said an emergency
meeting of the U. N. Security Council
was possible in the next two days. He
said he had been unable to reach agree

ment in talks yesterday with Bosnia's
government and Bosnian Serbs on a
cease-fire and monitoring of weapons
around Sarajevo.
The deadliest attack in the 22-
month siege of the capital, the explo
sion of a single mortar shell at the
market killed 68 people and wounded
more than 200, spurring more of the
debate that has paralyzed the interna
tional community for months.
Belgium's foreign minister urged
air strikes on Serb troops ringing Sara
jevo, and France demanded that
NATO set a deadline for the Serbs to
lift their siege or face military action
from the 16-member alliance.
But the European Union's media
tor, Lord Owen, said intervention
would do nothing to end a war that has
killed more than 200,000 Muslims,

Serbs and Croats. U.S. Defense Secre
tary William Perry backed away from
the threat of U.S. air strikes, calling
instead for a negotiated settlement.
Speaking in Munich, Germany,
Perry asked: "If air strikes are Act One
of a new melodrama, what is Act Two,
Act Three and the conclusion?"
In a statement issued from Wash
ington, Secretary of State Warren
Christopher said the first order of
business is to determine responsibility
for the attack, adding, "We do not rule
out the use of NATO air strikes once
responsibility has been fixed."
Three U.S. cargo planes evacuated
victims for treatment in Germany and
Italy yesterday.
U.N. experts were still analyzing
the shell's trajectory in an effort to pin
down blame for the attack
