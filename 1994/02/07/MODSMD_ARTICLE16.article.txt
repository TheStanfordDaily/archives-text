## Editorial Tuition hike blues 
### 
Students continue to get
less value for consistent
increases in their tuition

DURING these budget-cutting
times, 'doing more with less'
has been the mantra of the
University. Yet, when it comes to
tuition, this catch-phrase becomes
an ill-heeded tokenism. In fact, in
recent years it's been turned on its
head.
Tuition rose 9.5 percent in the
1991-92 school year and 7.5 percent
last year. During this time, there
have been continuing cuts in student
services and few genuine additions to
show for the extra charges. This dou
ble whammy is both unjust and
unnecessary.
Some may say this is an idealistic
suggestion, but it's also facing a
harsh reality — that students'
tuition dollars can't always be count
ed on to bear the brunt of the Uni
versity's financial troubles.
The ASSU Council of Presidents
put forth a commendable tuition
plan last week to the board of
Trustees when it proposed that
tuition should be capped at 2 percent
plus inflation for the next two years.
But this plan does not go far enough.
Granted, it is difficult to know
what the future holds in terms of
budget problems. However, this
should not keep the Board from
making a firm commitment to bring
ing the rate of tuition charges down
to the level of inflation, starting next
year.
The University is currently in a
transition phase, going from a cost
driven to a revenue-driven budget
model. In a revenue-driven model,
expenditures would reflect the
income of the University. This model
is much fairer to students because it
would keep the University from
spending more than it could afford
to and then billing students the
added costs in the form of tuition
hikes.
Otherwise, students end up paying

for Stanford's unprojected shortfalls,
as they do now.
Ideally, a revenue-driven budget
model would keep tuition increases
at the level of inflation.
In reaching this ideal revenue
driven budget, students, along with
the rest of the Stanford communi
ty, may be forced to suffer the
downsizing or loss of some unique
programs that characterize a Stan
ford education. However, many
students may prefer to sacrifice
some of these sacred cows in
exchange for finishing their loan
payments before they experience
mid-life crises.
While rising tuition costs are cou
pled with increases in financial aid,
much of this aid is in the form of
more student loans rather than
grants. With this in mind, students
and their families may feel that cost
cutting in the University is more
palatable than shelling out extra dol
lars to maintain services.
Further, an undergraduate de
gree is worth less today than ever
before. Many high-level occupations
require graduate school degrees and
therefore opt for a less expensive
undergraduate experience — for
example, a state school — in
exchange for a more costly and more
reputable grad school. If Stanford
does not reassure its students that it
is trying to keep tuition costs under
control, it is bound to lose prospec
tive students.
The University uses the transient
nature of the student population to
justify the dearth of explanation
about budget matters. But students
need to see a definite plan from the
board projecting when tuition will
rise with inflation and no higher. The
board's failure to take such action
has had visible ramifications — the
weak amount of alumni donations
serves as evidence. Only by verbaliz
ing a strong commitment to this
reduction can the board show stu
dents it cares about their precarious
financial situations.
Students are frustrated that their
increased payments are coupled with
cuts. It's time to focus on cost-cut
ting and let inflation dictate tuition
hikes.
