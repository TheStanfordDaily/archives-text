## A
						slice of life for everyone 
### 
LORENA Bobbitt was acquitted.
Women all over the country are
laughing. They're cheering.
They're throwing parties in honor of
the new Kathy Bates. "Misery in Man
assas" — that's what I call it.
Ever since June, men have been dou
bled over in pain. We're cringing. We're
all in a state of vicarious agony because
the Mr. Happy of one-time Mr. Happy
John Wayne Bobbitt became Mr. Unhap
py in the most bizarre story of 1993.
If nothing else, the Bobbitts' plight
puts marital rape higher on the public
agenda — as if we didn't have enough
to think about. It's an issue that has
not made the national spotlight until
now, though it has certainly been hap
pening for a long time. Imagine — you
feel so persecuted that you decide to
plan the ultimate revenge. Then you
carry it out.
In the aftermath of the act, both
were put on trial and both walked. John
was acquitted on charges of marital sex
ual assault, Lorena on charges of mali
cious wounding. What's the story there?
OK, he's a bastard. Throw him in jail
with his surgically repaired self. But
remember that she cut it off, and threw
it out of her car. I thought we had laws
in this country so people wouldn't go
around removing other people's geni
tals. Isn't it in the Second Amendment,
the part right after we have the right to
bear arms?

When you think about it, it's kind of
ironic. When juxtaposed, the names
"John" and "Wayne" conjure macho
images of big men doing manly things.
Someone named John Wayne has got to
be equipped. John Wayne Airport in
Orange County is a perfect example.
Let's take a look at the imagery, shall
we?
Eirst, we have airplanes. Enough
said. Second, we have hangars. Air
planes are pushed into these hangars
and come out when it's time to fly.
Third — thanks to anti-noise ordi
nances — immediately after takeoff,
the large metal tubes must quickly rise
over the valleys before reaching their
climax altitude. YoU'd thiftk those guvs
who made the Camel ads had their
hands all over this one.
What if the Duke came back and
heard about his namesake in Virginia?
What do you think he'd say? Maybe
something inquisitive like, "Well,
where's your true grit, partner?" Or he
might say something supportive like,
"Aw shucks, we got the technology. We
can rebuild ya." Or perhaps he'd go for
something informative such as, "Is that
a sausage in your pocket, or . . . wait a
second, that IS a sausage in your pock
et!"
At least they found it after Lorena
threw it out of her car window. What do
you think might have happened if they
didn't find it? It's kind of gross, but I

know you're all wondering. We won't
go into that.
1 make light of the situation that has
already been fixed — John's, not Lore
na's. But this is a very "sensitive" issue
for guys; we can't even watch short
stops take a bad hop down there, and
she thinks she's playing "Operation"
for adults. I'm not saying she didn't
have a right to be mad. But she com
mitted a serious crime. Apparently, a
jury of her peers said it was under
standable. I'm sorry, which was [he
Insane part?
So what's it going to be in 1994 9 Sil
icone gave us a lot to talk about a cou
ple of years ago. Maybe there'll be a
revival. I can see it now: "Men Who
Remove Their Wives' Implants" on the
next "Vicki!" It could be a good year for
butts, too. One thing is for sure —
there would be new meaning given to
"Full Moon in the Quad." Then again,
there's always that poem. . . . Never
mind. I'm no Pete Huyck. On second
thought, isn't that how this all got
started in the first place?

Jesse is currently accumulating hours
to get his pilot's license. He hopes to be
flying shuttles from SFO to John
Wayne by next quarter.
