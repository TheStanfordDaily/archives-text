## Winds of Freedom members are not extreme rightists 
### 
ANYONE WHO HAS read some of
the more than 200 pieces I have
published in the local press since
coming to Stanford 35 years ago knows
that my views reflect a reasoned and
metaphysically grounded centrism,
though some of my positions would
extend to moderate conservatism (e.g.
on the family). But so has the general
public's and even President Clinton's
of late.
1 say this not in self-defense (I gen
erally don't answer unserious attacks)
but in order to observe that, although
I have never worked in active collabo
ration with The Stanford Review
bunch or the Winds of Freedom group,

I am acquainted with their writings
and with them to some extent, and 1
consider it an outrageous assault on
the truth for Prof. Ronald Rebholz to
characterize them as extreme rightists
If that is what they are, then we
should have more of it, because they
strike me usually as decent, well
raised and intelligent young people.
But no reasonable person could call
them extremists, or fanatics.
But the liberals of the Rebholz
stripe have often admitted they no
longer believe in objective truth.
Everyone knows the left-wing Derrida,
Stanley Fish line, echoing the Hitler
doctrine on the effectiveness of lying

— all that matters is the cause.
But like me, the conservative or
centrist kids are traditionalists in this
sense: we think we have some idea of
what is true and good — e.g. we
"smell" a difference between "Mein
Kampf' and"The Critique of Pure
Reason" — and we certainly think you
can work toward it as a sort of beckon
ing lodestar.
It was when I discovered that men
dacity and bad faith ruled at Stanford
— for example, they never "came
clean" on the second-fiddle status of
the humanities here, never put a
"musician" dean in charge of our
"orchestra" — that 1 decided to bear

witness like a Russian dissident and
fight them, and the sold-out faculty,
from underground, in my journalistic
campaign.
Like Soviet Russia, Stanford and its
traitors to our wonderful cultural her
itage and its truths and beauties is
carrying a badly tarnished reputation
into the future.
Like Russia's, its errant era of
clumsy social engineering and revolt
against decency is doomed and proba
bly has only a few years to go. I hope 1
am still around to drink a toast with
those valiant youngsters.
