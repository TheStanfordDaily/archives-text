# PC-ness dulls coverage of key issues, silences the disclosure debate
## 
### 
Over half a century at Stanford, I
have assembled evidence that the
wind of freedom does not blow here.
In the old days there was conservative

political correctness. Now there is the
even worse opposite kind of PC cen
sorship.
At least The Daily seemed to pro
vide an open forum, but now I am
wondering. Some time ago I wrote a
letter criticizing Salman Rushdie.
While I detest the Iranian mullahs, he
was baiting them.
This is the wrong way to deal with
their fanaticism. When I called The

Daily to ask why my letter was not pub
lished, the staff member made it clear
to me that my viewpoint was not PC.
Now there is a worse case. The
Stanford Review in January properly
criticized the University's refusal to
release information on minorities.
Professor Stephen Krasner expressed
the private opinion of many faculty
members and of a large segment of the
public, as was evident from the

response to a report in the Jan. 26
San Francisco Chronicle.

The Stanford Daily apparently
chose to pass over this important issue
in silence. Is it a coincidence that at
issue was, among other things, the
over-representation of Asians, and The
Daily's former editor in chief ( Hajiv

Chandrasekaran| was an Indian?
