Student's murderers sentenced
A Santa Clara County Court judge sentenced
two men to life in prison without the possibility
for parole Friday for the murder of a Stanford
graduate student in 1990.
A jury in August convicted Surinder Bains, 36,
an employee in a Fremont electronics firm, of hir
ing co-worker Rafael Perez Hidalgo, a 39-year-old
San Bruno resident, to kill his former brother-in
law Gurmeet S. Shergill.
Shergill was fatally stabbed outside his home in
Sunnyvale on Sept. 23, 1990. An honors graduate
student in engineering at the time of his death,
Shergill had been enrolled in a cooperative pro
gram at Stanford in which he both took courses
for his master's degree and worked as a research
engineer at Intel Corporation.
Time for tuition awareness
"Financial Aid Awareness Week" is here again,
making its fourth annual appearance beginning
today in time to ensure that students know their
options and get their fair share.
Sponsored by the Financial Aids Office, the
event is primarily an attempt to alert students to
the fact that, while it may only be February,
September's tuition bill is just around the corner.

Cynthia Rife, assistant director of Financial
Aids, said that although this year's event "will be
scaled down from prior years" because there have
been fewer changes in procedure, there will still be
important opportunities for students to seek help.
Staff members from her office will be in Old
Union Room 322 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. today
through Friday.
Students who plan on taking advantage of the
additional assistance will need to bring 1993 tax
statements, Rife said.
While there were major changes in the applica
tion procedure last year, she said, this year's signif
icant changes have generally increased flexibility
and convenience.
A renewal form, mailed early in January, debut
ed this year with "basic demographic information,
such as Social Security numbers, addresses, birth
dates, etc." already completed, Rife said. Students
may choose to complete either the standard or the
renewal form.
In an attempt to compensate for changes in stu
dent need due to the recent earthquake in Los
Angeles, Rife said, the application deadline for Cal
Grants has been extended from March 2 to April 2.
Deadlines for most other federal and Stanford
sponsored financial aid applications remain set at
April 25.
