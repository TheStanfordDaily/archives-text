Happy coincidence or a sign of
things to come?
Timing its ascension to late-sea
son form with the completion of
the first half of its Pacific 10 Con
ference schedule, the Cardinal
women's basketball team held
serve at Maples Pavilion Saturday
night, damming the Oregon State
Beavers 88-67 before a moderate
crowd of 4,623.
In appearing to shake off any
effects of its conference road woes,
Stanford (13-5, 6-3 in the Pac-10)
completed a sweep of the Oregon

schools and ran its Pac-10 home
mark to 4-0. Meanwhile, the Cardi
nal avoided a possible tie with the
Beavers (12 6, 4-5) and claimed
sole possession of third place, one
game behind Washington and
three behind undefeated USC.
"We haven't executed better all
season," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer "We started off
with a complete package tonight
running on offense, defense,
rebounding and the half-court
game."
From the opening tap, the Car
dinal followed to near-perfection a
gameplan that concentrated on
half-court offense and holding an

athletic Oregon State squad in
check. Indicative of the plan's suc
cess were the numbers produced by
Stanford's dynamic inside duo, as
junior center Anita Kaplan led all
scorers for the second-straight
game with 22 points and 10
rebounds, while junior forward
Rachel Hemmer added 16 points
and a game-high 11 rebounds.
"When we needed to score, we
pounded the ball inside. We make
people stop Rachel and Anita,"
VanDerveer said.
The Beavers clearly could not
stop them, and lost much of their
