# Cardinal pounds Oregon St.
## Women's basketball executes near-perfect game plan 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
Happy coincidence or a sign of
things to come?
Timing its ascension to late-sea
son form with the completion of
the first half of its Pacific 10 Con
ference schedule, the Cardinal
women's basketball team held
serve at Maples Pavilion Saturday
night, damming the Oregon State
Beavers 88-67 before a moderate
crowd of 4,623.
In appearing to shake off any
effects of its conference road woes,
Stanford (13-5, 6-3 in the Pac-10)
completed a sweep of the Oregon

schools and ran its Pac-10 home
mark to 4-0. Meanwhile, the Cardi
nal avoided a possible tie with the
Beavers (12 6, 4-5) and claimed
sole possession of third place, one
game behind Washington and
three behind undefeated USC.
"We haven't executed better all
season," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer "We started off
with a complete package tonight
running on offense, defense,
rebounding and the half-court
game."
From the opening tap, the Car
dinal followed to near-perfection a
gameplan that concentrated on
half-court offense and holding an

athletic Oregon State squad in
check. Indicative of the plan's suc
cess were the numbers produced by
Stanford's dynamic inside duo, as
junior center Anita Kaplan led all
scorers for the second-straight
game with 22 points and 10
rebounds, while junior forward
Rachel Hemmer added 16 points
and a game-high 11 rebounds.
"When we needed to score, we
pounded the ball inside. We make
people stop Rachel and Anita,"
VanDerveer said.
The Beavers clearly could not
stop them, and lost much of their
capacity to do so when center
Kristina Lelas and forward Anette
Mollerstrom incurred two critical
fouls apiece during the Cardinal's
game-opening 12-3 run. With the
lane opened up, Kaplan connected
for six of her 14 first-half points as
Stanford extended to 20-9 with
9:50 remaining in the half.
A mutual assault on the nets
followed, as the teams traded seven
field goals in the next 1:15 and
allowed Cardinal freshman point
guard Jamila Wideman to gather
several of her six first-half assists,
en route to a game-high 10. When

the dust cleared, Stanford pushed
its advantage to as many as 21
points before heading to the locker
room up 39-22.
The Cardinal's 35-of-63 (.556)
shooting on the night, coupled with
the Beavers' miserable 27-of-71
(.380) mark, did not hurt Van-
Derveer's squad, either.
"When we get the ball inside, we
get much better shot selection, and
we make our players look better,"
VanDerveer said.
Hemmer looked particularly
good after the intermission, tossing
in 10 of her points while, ironically,
connecting on several turnaround
and fall-away jump shots.
"The defense knows I can go
around them, so they lay off of
me," Hemmer said. "When 1 get

the hall, I have to prove 1 can shoot
it the first couple of times."
VanDerveer explained Hedg
peth's second-consecutive display
of late-game exploits as a "sense of
urgency" that has gripped the
team's tn-captain.
"I told Christy that she didn't
want to waste any more games,"
VanDerveer said. "She wants to
leave the way she came in and not
watch other teams play on dur
ing the NCAA Tournament."
Hedgpeth agreed, citing the pre
vious weekend's back-to-back loss
es at UCLA and USC as motivation
for her improvement.
"We want to finish well and
show the NCAA that we are one of
the top teams in the nat ion," Hedg
peth said.
