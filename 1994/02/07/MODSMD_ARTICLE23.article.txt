# 'We're here and we're going to assert ourselves'
## Back on the winning track

The Stanford women's basket
hall team spared itself a trip to the
cart mechanic this weekend.
"This weekend was the test. If
we don't play well this weekend,
the wheels fall off the cart," said
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer after Saturday night's
game.
Two convincing victories over
two dangerous opponents allowed
the Cardinal to regain any lost con
fidence after disappointing losses
to USC and UCLA the previous
weekend.
According to VanDerveer, the

players went into their two games
against Oregon and Oregon State
with an attitude that said, "'Hey,
we're here and we're going to
reassert ourselves'."
And did they ever. Helped hy
stellar performances by Anita
Kaplan (25 points against Oregon,
22 against Oregon State) and
Christy Hedgpeth (20 points vs.
the Beavers), the Cardinal sent a
message to any and all doubters.
"We know that we can play with
anyone, whether it's I JSC or Wash
ington and they'll be coming back
here [to Maples]," VanDerveer
said, referring to two of the schools
whom Stanford has lost to on the
road.

The different makeup of this
year's squad from last year's
means that growing pains might
account for why it has taken the
Stiinford team half a season to
come together.
"When they shortened practice
on Nov. 1, it was really hard to get
a handle on how people could play.
Jamila's IWideman) not Molly
IGoodenbourl and Rachel's [Hem
merl not Val (Whiting)," Van-
Derveer said.
Not only the coach but also the
players had to adjust.
"In the first half of the season,
we learned a lot about ourselves,"
