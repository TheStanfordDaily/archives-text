The battle of the best turned out to be a old-fash
ioned Southern shellacking.
Texas' women's swimming squad moef ed into
defkierre pool Saturday with their guns a' blazing,
only to be sent back home 187-113 by way of Stan
ford's version of the O.K. Corral.
"Nobody wants to lose in a situation like this,"
said top-ranked Cardinal coach Richard Quick of his
team's thorough hammering of the second-ranked
Longhorns. "This meet was just as intense as it has
always been."
Between these two teams, perennial rivals for a
decade, there is certainly no Love(less) lost.
"This is very encouraging," said Lea Loveless,
who broke two pool records and captured four victo
ries in the highly touted meet. "It should be a good
springboard for the future."
Stanford's future now includes an undisputed
number-one ranking going into the NCAA champi
onships in March. But the Cardinal team is anything
but ready to compete for the crown.
"I was pleased with how we raced, but 1 wasn't
pleased with our times," Quick said of the Texas
meet. "I thought we would swim faster, and I don't
know for sure why we didn't."
Quick could not have hoped for a better outcome
in the meet (when you win 12 of 1(5 events there is
very little room for improvement), but the team is
evidently falling short of his high expectations

"We needed to swim faster today," Quick said.
"We've got to figure out how to get faster."
However, a faster Cardinal team is hard to imag
ine. Loveless' two pool records in the 100-yard and
200 backstroke were onlv a drop in Stanford's
achievement pool. Junior Jenny. Thompson wtm the
50 and 100 free, setting a personal season best and a
second-best in the nation in the 100. The Olympian
also won the 100 fly, remaining atop the nation in
that event.
"I don't want to take away from the fact that we
beat a very good team today," Quick said. "And we
had to race hard to do it. We just need to evaluate
what we could have done better.''
Obviously improvement is always needed, and in
light of the Cardinal's unmerciful punishment of
Texas there needs to be incentive to keep working
and to become even better.
Hut for many Stanford swimmers, swimming bet
ter will mean being better than the best.
Loveless won the 100 back in 54.09 seconds and
the 200 back in 1:55.77. In the 200 event, she beat
out American record-holder Whitney Hedgepeth
handily. In addition, Loveless swam the anchor leg in
the 400 free relay, coming from behind to beat the
Longhorns and remain tops in the nation in that
relay event.
"I was really hoping for this," Loveless said of her
spectacular day. "Hut 1 don't know if I was expecting
