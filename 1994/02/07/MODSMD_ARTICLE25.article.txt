### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
The Stanford women's gym
nastics team lost on Friday by
less than a point to California's
Golden Bears, who were able to
harness the crowd's energy at
their first home meet and tri
umph with an overall score of
189.675.
The Cardinal, who entered
the meet ranked 13th in the
nation, garnered a score of
188.800, and won both the beam
and the floor events. Despite the
squad's defeat, the Cardinal
team will get at least two more
chances to beat No. 18 Cal this
season.
"We did a good job," said Car
dinal assistant coach Robert
Shawler. "Thejudges were just a
little tight on us, and didn't give
us the edge we deserved."
Even though Stanford lost
the meet, Cardinal gymnasts
had a strong showing on each
event and in the all-around.
Junior .Jene Elzie came in lirst
place with an all-around score of
38.600, beating her previous sea
son high of 38.525. California's
Mindy Ornellas took second
place, and Stanford's sophomore
Hillary Anderson tied with Cal's
Cassie Shiyeoka for third place
with a score of 37.525.

"I feel wonderful about our
performance," Flzie said. "Per
sonally, 1 \s;is happy with all the
events, and felt I was solid on the
heanv For the rest of the meets,
1 plan to perform with (he same,
if not higher, level of confi
dence. "
Flzie t<h ik second on the vault
with a score of 9.750 another
season best with first place
going to California's Lisa Wash
ington Also leading the Cardinal
was junior Meegan Lannin, who
earned a score of 9.550. Further
more, freshman Ariel Passanisi
broke her previous best score
for the season with a 9.^75.
Though she comjH'ted in the
other three events, freshman
Katie .Jennings was unable to
compete on the vault due to a
recurring back injury. Anderson
filled in for her, performing a
vault for which she had little
time to warm up. Jennings
hopes to regain her confidence
and com[>ete in the all-around by
next week's meet.
Though two Cardinal gym
nasts fell on their first release
moves on the bars, overall the
routines and landings were very
solid. Lannin drastically
improved her season high of
9.()f>o by earning a 9.1(H), and
Elzie helped the team with her
score of 9.550. First place on the
bars went to Cal's Cindy Tom with
a 9.775, but Anderson took second
with a 9.650 and Jennings came in
third place with a 9.625.
"Everyone was swinging a bit
higher on bars," Shawler said.
"And we were still hot on beam and
floor."
The Cardinal gave one of its
best performances on beam, with
only one fall and few wobbles.
Anderson's score of 9.675 earned
her second place, and Elzie took
third with a 9.550. First place went

to Cal's Tom with a 9.775. Sopho
more Linda Chun was new to the
lineup this week, and earned a
9.250.
Stanford received their highest
floor score of the season — a
48.025. Elzie took first place with a
9.750, beating her previous high
score of 9.675, and junior Tina
Snowden came in third place with
a 9.625. Lannin and Jennings were
not far behind, sharing a score of
9.600. Chun received a 9.450,
which was also her highest score of
the season.
"We came back from a week of
midterms and injuries and did
well," Anderson said. "Our loss to
Berkeley will just give us incentive
to do better; it will make us more
hungry."
