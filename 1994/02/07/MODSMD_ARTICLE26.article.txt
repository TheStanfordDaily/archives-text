# Men barely hang on to beat Beavers
## Last-second three-pointer clangs off rim for OSU 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
For the second game in a row, the Stanford
men's basketball team was given a major scare
before recovering to pull out a crucial victory.
The Cardinal 113-5,6-3 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference) squeezed p;ist Oregon State 71-67 on
the road Saturday afternoon, but just like its
two-point win over Oregon hist Thursday night,
the final score should not have been so close
leading by 11 points with just 51 seconds to
play, the Stall ford squad suddenly found itself
in a position to lose the contest.
"We made some real silly errors and unfor
tunately made it a little too exciting in the end,"
said Cardinal forward Andy Poppink.
Oregon State (5-13, 1-8) outscored Stanford
10-1 in the game's final moments, before miss

ing a potential game-winning shot with under
10 seconds to play.
The I Wavers hit a pair of three-pointers, an
alley-oop dunk and a driving layup during that
stretch to quickly make the score 69-67.
Then on the next Cardinal possession, guard
David Harbour bounced a pass off Dion Cross'
leg and out of bounds, giving Oregon State a
golden opportunity to steal the game
Beaver forward Brent Barry's three point
attempt hit off the front rim, however, and was
rebounded by Stanford's Brent Williams.
Williams was fouled and sank two free throws
to preserve the win.
Cardinal coach Mike Montgomery was less
than complimentary about his team's sloppy
play in the final minute, which included several
missed free throws and a 10-second back-court
violation.

"At the end of the game, Oregon State got
aggressive, and we got passive and made some
not very bright plays." he said. "Not a classic
finishing-up performance."
Had the Beavers fully completed their last
minute comeback, it would have tarnished two
superb efforts by Williams and Poppink.
Williams, a senior, scored a career-high 27
points and grabbed 12 rebounds, while Pop
pink, a junior, amassed 24 points to go along
with a career-best MS boards.
According to Poppink, Oregon State's lack of
size created more opportunities than usual for
St an ford's f< irwards.
"They don't have a whole lot of bulk inside,"
h(> said. "1 was able to get some passes inside
that I don't always get."
