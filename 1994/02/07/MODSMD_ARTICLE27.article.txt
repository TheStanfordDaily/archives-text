### Roger Han Staff writer 
Four California schools crowded into Roble
Gym Saturday and were vanquished bv a con
fident Stanford women's fencing team. The
Cardinal women, behind a strong team effort,
crushed UC-Santa Cruz by a score of 15-1,
San Jose State 11-5, Long Beach State 14-2
and Cal State-Fullerton 14-2.

The Cardinal men, forced to field a foil
squad made up of reserve sabermen, won only
against Fuilerton, although the epee and
saber squads fenced well individually. The
epee squad lost only to Long Beach, 6-3, and
the saber squad's only loss was to San Jose,
also by a score of 6-3. Overall, the men lost 15-

12 to San Jose, 18-9 to Long Beach, 11-13 to
Santa Cruz and 14-13 to Fuilerton
Hut in the last match of the day, they
fenced Fuilerton a second time and pulled out
a '20-7 victory with epee going 9-0, saber 8-1,
and foil 3-6. The match was one of the hi*: t
showings of the year for the aber squad, said
sophomore Ed Jen.
"It was a good day for the women. Kvery
thing went right for everyone," said Stanford
women's coach Sherry Posthumus. " They've
done a good job of becoming a team unit, a lot
of it because of Iteam captain| Anna Cum
mins."
In fact, the Cardinal women out-touched
their opponents by a combined 288 to 131
margin. Most of their losses were by substi

tutes who Posthumus put in for experience
once the matches were won.
"We didn't break a sweat," said sophomore
Chloe Sladden.
The Cardinal epee squad so obviously out
classed Fuilerton that Stanford men's coach
Zoran Tulum forced his fencers to score the
five touches needed to win in five different
ways.
The Long Beach loss by the epee team was
one the Cardinal should have won, said sopho
more Krrol Hunter
"We didn't fence to our potential," he said.
"They were pretty good and a few mistakes
cost us the match. We're looking forward to
seeing Long Beach again at Western Regionals
and it 'll be a whole different story."
