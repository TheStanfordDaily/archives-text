# Cardinal dishes out punishment to Aztecs, Tritons
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Over the weekend, the men's
volleyball team redefined "by
the skin of one's teeth" with a
five-game nail-biter against No.
8 San Diego State, 15-4, 9-15,
15-13, 12-15, 15-13, before clos
ing out the homestand with a
easy four-game victory over UC-
San Diego.
In Saturday's match against
the Aztecs, Stanford (5-3 over
all, 4-0 in the Mountain Pacific-
Sports Federation) came out hot
with early 9-1 run. Aided by a
stellar defense, the Cardinal
held San Diego State's John
Hyden to a measly two kills in
the first game. Hyden, the
national leader in kills per
game, eventually earned his
share of spikes, notching a
game-high 37 kills despite the
slow start.
After that convincing game
one victory, the Cardinal could
not pull ahead, as the match
became a seesaw battle between
the two squads.
After conceding game two to
the Aztecs (2-2, 2-2), the Cardi
nal established a 2-1 advantage
going into the fourth game.
However, Stanford's offense
stalled, as it coughed up seven
consecutive points in the same
rotation, and San Diego State
scrapped by with a 15-12 victory.
That pushed the match to a
fifth and final game, which is
played in rally format on the col
legiate level. With sideouts
counting as scores, the Aztecs
dug themselves a shallow grave
in the outset with two consecu
tive service errors.

The Cardinal played consis
tently, and San Diego State
eventually handed Stanford the
match on a silver platter with
two more service errors to
account for points 14 and 15.
"In that last game, we sided
out 12 times," said Stanford
head coach Ruben Nieves.
"That's a great accomplish
ment, even though San Diego
State helped us out with their
service errors."

'We're going to have
different heroes on
different nights.'
— Ruben Nieves

Nieves' hero of the night was
sophomore swing hitter Mike
Lambert, who paced the Cardi
nal attack with a match-high
.576 hitting percentage, 23 kills
and seven digs.
"We're going to have differ
ent heroes on different nights,"
Nieves said. "And against San
Diego State, Mike just pounded
every ball that was set to him. It
was a great performance, and it
gave us an edge throughout the
match."
Freshman outside hitter
Matt Fuerbringer also helped
the Cardinal effort with 35 kills,
six digs and four blocks. Fresh
man setter Stewart Chong, fill
ing in for the injured Canyon
Ceman, tallied a career-high 68
sets to go along with his team
high eight digs.
However, after that hard
fought victory, the Cardinal suf

fered a letdown against a tradi
tionally weak UCSD squad (0-7,
0-s)on Saturday.
"This is a very common sce
nario in sports," Nieves said.
"After a difficult, emotional
match there is usually a letdown
going into the next one. We
know that; it's just a matter of
how we'll respond to it."
The Cardinal responded by
not playing up to its full poten
tial, but nevertheless pulling
out the match, 15-7, 15-5, 14-
16, 15-11. En route to finally
winning the contest, Stanford
spotted UCSD with only its sec
ond game victory in the season.
The Tritons' only other victori
ous game came against UC-
Santa Barbara.
"I'm happy with the way we
made Stanford fight for the
game," said UCSD head coach
Doug Dannevik. "We made Stan
ford play a lot of points, which is
very uncharacteristic for them."
On the bright side, Fuer
bringer racked up 24 kills for a
.462 hitting percentage on the
night, while senior outside hit
ter Joe Burghardt pitched in 18
kills and junior middle blocker
Brian Garrett registered 11
more for a team-high .571 hit
ting percentage.
Nevertheless, Burghardt
realized that, "We have to con
centrate on minimizing those
hitting errors. We're inconsis
tent sometimes and it gets real
ly frustrating."
The Cardinal will have a
chance to iron out any rough
edges with a bye this week
before facing Pacific on Feb. 15
and No. 3 Brigham Young the
following Saturday.

match."
Freshman outside hitter
Matt Fuerbringer also helped
the Cardinal effort with 35 kills,
six digs and four blocks. Fresh
man setter Stewart Chong, fill
ing in for the injured Canyon
Ceman, tallied a career-high 68
sets to go along with his team
high eight digs.
However, after that hard
fought victory, the Cardinal suf

fered a letdown against a tradi
tionally weak UCSD squad (0-7,
0-s)on Saturday.
"This is a very common sce
nario in sports," Nieves said.
"After a difficult, emotional
match there is usually a letdown
going into the next one. We
know that; it's just a matter of
how we'll respond to it."
The Cardinal responded by
not playing up to its full poten
tial, but nevertheless pulling
out the match, 15-7, 15-5, 14-
16, 15-11. En route to finally
winning the contest, Stanford
spotted UCSD with only its sec
ond game victory in the season.
The Tritons' only other victori
ous game came against UC-
Santa Barbara.
"I'm happy with the way we
made Stanford fight for the
game," said UCSD head coach
Doug Dannevik. "We made Stan
ford play a lot of points, which is
very uncharacteristic for them."
On the bright side, Fuer
bringer racked up 24 kills for a
.462 hitting percentage on the
night, while senior outside hit
ter Joe Burghardt pitched in 18
kills and junior middle blocker
Brian Garrett registered 11
more for a team-high .571 hit
ting percentage.
Nevertheless, Burghardt
realized that, "We have to con
centrate on minimizing those
hitting errors. We're inconsis
tent sometimes and it gets real
ly frustrating."
The Cardinal will have a
chance to iron out any rough
edges with a bye this week
before facing Pacific on Feb. 15
and No. 3 Brigham Young the
following Saturday.
