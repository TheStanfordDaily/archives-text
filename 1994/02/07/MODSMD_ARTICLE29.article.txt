# Swimmers drown UCLA, USC; show dominance before NCAAs
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
The Stanford men's swim
team didn't do anything to help
the rebuilding efforts in the city
of Los Angeles this weekend. The
top-ranked Cardinal showed both
UCLA and USC the type of disas
ter they can cause, upping their
record to 9-0 with just one dual
meet remaining on the schedule.
On Friday, Stanford blasted
the Bruins by a score of 145-95.
The Cardinal won all nine indi
vidual swimming events and both
relays on their way to victory.
Sophomore Joe Hudepohl was the
lone double winner for Stanford,
placing first in the 200-yard indi
vidual medley and the 100
freestyle. His time of 44.11 sec
onds in the 100 free was more
than two seconds faster than the
second-place finisher and just
two-tenths of a second off the
NCAA qualifying time.
While the score was lopsided
enough, things could have been
worse for the Bruins. Coach Skip
Kenney and company were
preparing for their showdown
with USC.
"On Friday, we swam an off
lineup," said senior Derek Weath
erford. "We swam two events
apiece and were getting readv for
USC."
Weatherford and his team
mates arrived at USC's McDon
ald's Swim Stadium fired up with
revenge on their minds. The Car
dinal decimated the Trojans 148-

90, avenging its last dual-meet
loss, which occurred two years
ago.
"There has been bad blood
between [Stanford and USC| in
the past," Weatherford said.
"Since my sophomore year, they
are the only team we've lost to.
On Saturday we swam out of our
minds."

'There has been bad
blood between [Stan
ford and USC] in the

The Cardinal set the tone in
the opening event, finishing 1-2
the 400 medley relay. As a result
of the team's incredible depth, no
opposing team has managed to
beat Stanford's B team in the
opening relay this season.
Weatherford's 100 backstroke
split time leading off the relay
was a pool-record 48.17. "We
wanted to get off to a fast start
and not look back," he said.
Using their top lineup, Stan
ford dominated the individual
events as well, winning eight of
nine races. Double winners
included Hudepohl (200 and 500
free), senior Bill Schell (50 and
100 free) and Weatherford (200
IM and 200 back).

"I'm pretty happy with my
swims," Schell said. "My times
were just slightly off what I swam
at Michigan. This was a good meet
for everybody. We did what we
needed to do. This will be a good
platform for Pac-lOs and NCAAs."
Only rival California stands
between Stanford and a second
consecutive undefeated dual-meet
season. As the head-to-head por
tion of the year winds down, Ken
ney's squad is looking forward to
some rest before the champi
onship meets.
"We're all pretty run down
right now," Weatherford said.
"We'll start resting this week. I'm
really tired and looking forward
to rest."
Weatherford, the defending
NCAA champion in the 200 back,
will shave for the conference
championships for the first time
this year in an effort to reach new
levels in his event.
"I'm shooting for a kind of
magical barrier, going under 1:40,
which would basically be an Amer
ican record," he said. The current
record of 1:40.64 is held by ex-
Cardinal star Jeff Rouse. "I want
to give myself as many chances as
possible. I'm really excited."
While excitement for UCLA
and USC was extremely limited
this weekend, the coming weeks
promise to be electric for Stan
ford. With rest and preparation
for the Pac-lOs and NCAAs in
sight, it's full-speed ahead for the
Cardinal, a thought that does not
excite the rest of the NCAA.
