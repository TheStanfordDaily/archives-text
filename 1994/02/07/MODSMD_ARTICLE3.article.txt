## Program explores uses of humor 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
About '200 people shared a good laugh
last night at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
"When Can I Laugh?" was the topic of last
night's program, which featured speeches bv
students and faculty members, skits, video
clips and a performance by a professional co
median. The Office of Multicultural Educa
tion, Multicultural Development Tommy
Lee Woon and Students Speaking About
Race and Culture (SSpARC) sponsored the
event.
The evening began with a video presenta

tion from America's Funniest I lome Videos.
Woon followed the clip with an introduction.
"Who doesn't enjov a great laugh?" he asked
the audience.
"laughter is so important, so power
ful. . . it allows us to express a great range of
feelings," Woon said. "Have you ever asked
yourself what gives you your sense of humor
or what makes you laugh?"
He said the program wiis "designed to ex
amine our sense of humor and where our
sense of humor collides with laughter."
Anthropology Prof. John Hick then dis
cussed the origin of laughter and humor. Al
though their exact origin is unknown, he

said that they are a "phenomenon that is pri
marily human."
Rick maintained that humor is "intrinsi
cally cultural." 1 lumor is a portrayal of ten
sion within society and laughter is a release
of that tension, he said. "You have tension,
you create humor, you laugh, you release
tension."
"We need to use humor very thoughtful
ly, very carefully," Rick warned.
Students presented a variety of skits that
involved laughter as the result of racist or
stereotypical jokes. These skits showed the
negative effects t hat laughter can have.
"We wanted to make people
think about how we use humor in
our society and how it can be dam
aging at times and healing at other
times," said SSpARC member
Sameer Bhatia, a freshman.
Students also shared some of their
personal experiences with laughter.
Sophomore Chris Donald began his
speech with a string of terms like "nig
ger," "white trash," and "Chinaman."
"The worst thing we've allowed
ourselves to do is laugh about
them," Donald said. "Laughing

about them trivializes them."
He reminded the audience of
what his grammar school teacher
told him â€” "It's okay to laugh with
somebody, but not at somebody"
Senior Rachel Maddow discussed
some of the stereotypes that come
with being a lesbian and how they
relate to laughter. "There are a lot of
things that aren't funny about being
queer," she said.
Although Maddow said she finds
it funny that an influx of gay porno
films called "Dishonorable Dis
charge" followed the gays in the mil
itary debate last summer, she only
thinks such a joke is amusing if the
person telling it is "informed about
the not-so-funny realities."

Reverend Dave from the
Church of 80 Percent Sincerity
closed the program. He discussed
the effect his birth defect has had
on him. "I was born with this face,"
he said of his disfigured face. "I
consider it a gift from God."
Dave said he doesn't always give
a serious answer when people ask
him what happened to his face.
Sometimes he tells people, "You've
heard of a bad hair day, I'm having a
bad face day,"he said.
He also spoke about the Church
of 80 Percent Sincerity. Calling it
the "church of choice for recovering
perfectionists," he said, "We have no
ideals at a 11.... We adjust our ideals
and practices with people."
