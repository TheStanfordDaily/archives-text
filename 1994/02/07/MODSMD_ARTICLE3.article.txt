### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
About '200 people shared a good laugh
last night at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
"When Can I Laugh?" was the topic of last
night's program, which featured speeches bv
students and faculty members, skits, video
clips and a performance by a professional co
median. The Office of Multicultural Educa
tion, Multicultural Development Tommy
Lee Woon and Students Speaking About
Race and Culture (SSpARC) sponsored the
event.
The evening began with a video presenta

tion from America's Funniest I lome Videos.
Woon followed the clip with an introduction.
"Who doesn't enjov a great laugh?" he asked
the audience.
"laughter is so important, so power
ful. . . it allows us to express a great range of
feelings," Woon said. "Have you ever asked
yourself what gives you your sense of humor
or what makes you laugh?"
He said the program wiis "designed to ex
amine our sense of humor and where our
sense of humor collides with laughter."
Anthropology Prof. John Hick then dis
cussed the origin of laughter and humor. Al
though their exact origin is unknown, he

said that they are a "phenomenon that is pri
marily human."
Rick maintained that humor is "intrinsi
cally cultural." 1 lumor is a portrayal of ten
sion within society and laughter is a release
of that tension, he said. "You have tension,
you create humor, you laugh, you release
tension."
"We need to use humor very thoughtful
ly, very carefully," Rick warned.
Students presented a variety of skits that
involved laughter as the result of racist or
stereotypical jokes. These skits showed the
negative effects t hat laughter can have.
