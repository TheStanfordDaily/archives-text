# EAST festival to highlight Asian link to the West
## 
### Vivien Wang Staff writer 
Taiko drums will bong, a Noh comedy from Japan
will take the stage and the seldom-heard ancient Chi
nese harp will play during Performance Night, the
culminating event for this year's expanded celebra
tion of EASTFest.
For the first time in its 11 -year history, EASTFest
— which begins today — will be lengthened from
one week to two, a change precipitated by the Ameri
can Studies theme house's co-sponsorship of the
event. The theme house, which became EAST
House's neighbor when it moved into Murray this
year, is sponsoring three of the 10 speakers.
"The physical location of Murray invited coopera
tion between the two dorms," said Edmund Yeh, an
EAST House theme assistant. "We had been explor
ing the possibility of an East / West fest... to exam
ine the role of Asia in the world and the impact of East
Asia on the West."
Yeh stressed that this was "a really immediate
issue" with an increasing number of graduates seek
ing jobs in Asia and the recent lifting of the Vietnam
trade embargo. The celebration is "a great opportu
nity for people to find out about East Asian culture,
and even a necessity because of its increasingly im
portant role," he said.
Yeh, who heads the entertainment committee for
this year's EASTFest, said the speaker series will
focus not only on economic and political issues, but
also "diversify into other areas: art, sociology, philos-
ophy, anthropology." The series is
"not just an examination of cur
rent events, but of relevant
issues."
Subtitled "Ten illuminating
discussions on contemporary
Asian issues," the series includes
two lectures on art, one each on
sociology, anthropology and phi
losophy, and others on current
issues, such as the nuclear prolif
eration on the Korean peninsula.
The series features six Stanford
faculty members, two senior
Hoover fellows and two visiting
professors.

EASTFest Performance Night,
scheduled for Feb. 19, will feature
campus groups such as the Stan
ford Chinese Folkdancing
Troupe, Stanford Taiko, Stanford
Samulnori Korean Drum and
Dance, and Stanford Indian
Dance Group.
In addition to performances,
there will be an exhibition room
in EAST's library which focuses
on five nations: China, Japan,
Korea, Thailand and the Philip
pines. The room will have a booth
for each country featuring maps,
information, statistics, clothing
and other knickknacks.
As head of the decorations
committee, theme assistant Carol
Shi is in charge of an exhibit
which will transform the library.

lobby and dining room. Shi
promised that the result will be
"colorful, not cut-and-dry," and
also mentioned the possibility of a
table displaying books on East
Asia by Stanford authors.
To tantalize the taste buds at
Performance Night, two to three
dishes each from China, Japan,
Korea, Vietnam, Thailand and
India will be offered. Theme assis
tant Krista Huerta, head of the
food committee, said there will
not be the "usual egg roll stuff.
We're trying to get foods that are
unique to that culture."
EASTFest's theme this year,
"Continuity and Change in Asia,"
is reflected in the posters and
fliers plastered around campus.
Eric Yoon, a theme assistant and

head of the publicity committee,
suggested that the butterfly on
each poster and flier "symbolizes
change, which describes the cur
rent situation in Asia."
Resident Fellow Jim Ketelaar, a
professor of Japanese history,
described previous EASTFests as
"cultural light," with "eat it, look
at-it, smell it" programming which
generally lasted less than a day.
It was only three years ago,
with Ketelaar's encouragement,
that a week-long speaker series
was initiated. This year's EAST-
Fest will be "more than twice as
much as before, and pretty com
prehensive" as well, lie said. To
Ketelaar, EASTFest is an exam
ple of "how residential education
reallv works."
