# Trustees to consider tuition hike today
## Board will also discuss increases in salaries 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
The Board of Trustees is meeting today
and tomorrow to consider how much to in
crease tuition — a figure which may be
around 5 percent — and how much to raise
faculty and staff salaries.
The board — a 32-person group that over
sees the management of the University —
will also consider, among other things, a
more detailed plan to restructure the Med
ical Center.
Provost Condoleezza Rice, who will tell
the board how much the University adminis
tration wants to increase tuition, refused to
comment on the tuition proposal except to
say that she will recommend an increase.
A source familiar with the board indicated
that the tuition increase might be around 5
percent. The source said that last year, the

trustee committee that determines tuition
levels set the goal of holding tuition to about
2 percent above inflation — which is cur
rently about 3 percent.
Council of Presidents member Jason Sny
der and graduate student Todd Flynn, who
are now both in their second years as mem
bers of that committee, said they do not re
call discussion of such a tuition cap.
The COP made a similar proposal last
week, asking Rice to recommend a tuition in
crease of no more than the rate of inflation
plus 2 percent for the next two years. Rice
said she would consider the proposal when
making her presentation to the board, but
made no promises.
A 5 percent increase would put tuition for
undergraduates at $18,664 next year, up
from $17,775 this year. The trustees will also
decide how much to increase room
and board costs.
In 1992, the board increased the
price tag for a year of classes by 9.5
percent, and the trustees raised the
cost by 7.5 percent last year.
Staff and faculty salaries will
also be discussed today and tomor
row. Rice said the administration
is proposing an increase in salary
pools for faculty and staff, but
would not discuss how big the
increase might be.
But Biology Prof. Patricia
Jones, chair of the Faculty Senate,
said she hopes the salary increase
will at least keep up with the rate

of inflation.
Jones added that the salary
level is "a very complex issue" that
is affected by factors including the
University's finances, the rate of
inflation and competition for
employees.
The trustees vote on increasing
salary pools, not individual
salaries. This leaves room for
administrators to adjust the
amount of raises to reflect individ
ual merit. Jones said the lower the
total increase in salary pool is, the
harder it is to reward on the basis
of merit.
Faculty salaries were increased
by about 2 percent two years ago,
and Jones said she believes last
year's increase was about 3.5 per
cent.
Among the other areas the

board will discilss is a plan to
restructure the Medical Center,
said board Chair John Freiden
rich.
The report is a more detailed
version of a plan announced by the
University last year to change the
way the Stanford Hospital, the
School of Medicine and Stanford
doctors relate to each other and
the health-care industry, said
Geoffrey Cox, vice provost for
institutional planning. The plan
aims to adapt Stanford to the
national changes in health care.
Today, the board will meet in a
number of separate committees to
discuss various aspects of the Uni
versity, Freidenrich said. Then, on
Tuesday, the board will meet as a
whole to discuss and vote on
issues.
