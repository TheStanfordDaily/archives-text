## Prototype planned for residences next year; students would pay a fee for extra channels 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
There may yet be hope for fans of Beavis,
Butt-Head and beach volleyball as the Uni
versity considers offering additional cable
channels on SUNet for those willing to pay
an extra fee.
A plan to add commercial channels to the
University cable service is in the works as
part of a joint effort between Libraries and
Information Resources and the office of the
vice provost for Student Affairs, according to
Director of Communications Services Jan
Thomson.
If all goes well, Thomson said, students in
a few lucky residences could be seeing the
outcome of the plan soon. "We're looking to
having a prototype in the next academic
year," she said.
Since the plan is still in its earliest stages,
Thomson said she is not yet able to comment
on what particular channels might be avail
able or how many additional channels might
be offered.
I lowever, she said the new offerings will
include "a mix of educational and informa
tional as well as entertainment" channels.
The additional channels would be offered
on a fee-for-service basis. Students in indi
vidual rooms would be able to choose be
tween just having the free SUNet service —

which currently includes local stations and
some cable channels like CNN — and sub
scribing to the commercial service with the
additional channels.
"We're looking at a number of technical
issues" now, Thomson said. "In about a
month everyone will be hearing more."
Thomson said once the technical issues
are resolved, "we're certainly going to be
looking for advice" from students and resi
dent fellows on the details of the new service.
A few ASSU senators have been pushing
for additional cable service for more than a
year. "Last year we decided that this is one of
t he issues we wanted to fight for," said under
graduate senator G race Casas-Silva, referring
to herself and undergraduate senator Phil
Lin. "What I want to do is speed up the
process."
"The whole issue [of adding cable chan
nels! has been under discussion for a long
time," Thomson said. With continued stu
dent demand, she added, "in the last year we
began to take another view."
Casas-Silva said the University's change
of heart came because of the purchase of a
technical device called a router, which will
allow Communications Services to control
which rooms get additional channels.
She added that the changes will come first
to dorms like Kimball and Sterling Quad
which have the proper SUNet wiring.
