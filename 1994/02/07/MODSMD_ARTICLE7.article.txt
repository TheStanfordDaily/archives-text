# Bachelors club fights social 'inadequacies'
## Group hosts Bay Area singles events

So you say the dating scene at
Stanford leaves something to be
desired?
The Stanford Bachelors club
an all-male group of Stanford
affiliates which throws 15 to 20
singles parties every year — has
the same complaint.
The non-profit club, founded
in 1959 under the umbrella of the
Stanford Alumni Association,
was "started by a few characters
who thought there were certain
inadequacies in social life and
fund-raising at Stanford," said
Bachelor member and former
club president Keith Slipper.
Comprised of Stanford alum
ni, faculty and current graduate
students, the club sponsors
events for Stanford and Bay Area
singles, with proceeds benefiting
various charitable organizations.
Recent beneficiaries have includ
ed Stanford Children's Hospital
and programs through the Haas
Center for Public Service.
The club's most recent party,
held last Wednesday at The Edge,
a Palo Alto night-spot, was at
tended by over 450 guests. The
event garnered almost $3,000 in

proceeds to be distributed be
tween the Red Cross' Los Angeles
Earthquake Relief program and

The official criteria for mem
bership in the Bachelors club is
affiliation with Stanford, but
most members are also single,
and currently all are men.
"[Women joining] has never real
ly come up as an issue," said Slip
per, who received a master's de
gree from Stanford in 1979. "We
haven't admitted any in the past,
but no women have approached
us about membership . . . there's
nothing in our bylaws prohibit
ingit."
Women do typically pay slight
ly less to get into Bachelor parties
than men do. However, Slipper
said this is a change from former
days, when women were admit
ted to parties for free.

functions, Slipper said he sees

let. "This group is not just for
women meeting men, it's probably
the best vehicle I've ever seen for
members of the same sex meeting
each other, and that goes for men
and women . . . you see the same
faces at different parties."
A typical Bachelors Club party
involves several hundred guests
— most of whom are not affiliated
with the University — in a
"sophisticated, classy atmo
sphere; there's a certain standard
of behavior that is almost auto
matic, and it's a very easy place to
meet people . . . it's not like going
to a bar," Slipper said.
The events are aimed at pro
fessionals between the ages of 21
and 45 and cost about $20,
though Stanford graduate stu
dents and undergraduates alike
can get into most parties free with
student identification. "There is
something to please everyone,

from a cocktail party atmosphere
to dancing," said John Kwan, the
South Bay events chairman "It
exposes us to a large variety of
guests."
In addition to social events,
interaction among club members
extends beyond the semimonthly
singles parties. "A lot of us end up
doing work with each other, and
even hire each other . . . it's a very
cohesive group in terms of the men
who are members as well as the
women who come to the parties."
The group regularly extends
its activities to include backpack
ing trips, sailing and skiing excur
sions, and trips to Napa Valley
and Monterey.
"One reason we have [smaller
trips 1 is as an incentive for people
to help.out at our big parties, said
Kwan. "Since we're non-profit we
can't pay people to work."
Slipper added that these small
er trips are "compensation, plus
an opportunity to get together in
a quieter environment."
Many meetings at Bachelors
Club events have flourished into

relationships, proving that
"things like this really do work,"
said Slipper. To date, he said,
"hundreds" of matches have been
made. "If we go back through the
presidents |of the club], almost all
of them have gotten married
eventually to women they've met
at our functions."
In spite of turnover within the
club as members marry and move
on, the Stanford Bachelors contin
ue their success, recruiting new
members and experimenting with
updated approaches to their
events.
Membership has sloughed off
somewhat since the club broke
away from the Alumni Associa
tion in the late 1980s because of
contract changes. "We became
quite an organization in our own
right ... we felt limited and [the
Alumni Association! felt limited,"
Slipper said.
The break, however, has not
stopped the club from remaining
one of the Bay Area's thriving sin
gles scenes, as well as a significant
community benefactor.
