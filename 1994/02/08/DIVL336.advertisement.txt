Would you cross the line?
Tuesday February Bth. the Stanford Humanists invites you to
explore your ethics.
Crossing the line is a game where everyone is faced with an ethical
or moral choice and must decide on which side of the line they
stand. You physically show what you think and "where you stand".
Here's a chance to declare your choices and explain them.
The Stanford Humanists meets every Tuesday at 7pm, in the
Sequoia Room on the 2nd floor of Tresidder.
We focus on humanity as the source of knowledge, values and
social systems and seek to explain these things without supernatural
deities.
SOME PEOPLE WILL SETTLE
FORNOTHING BUT THE BEST.
