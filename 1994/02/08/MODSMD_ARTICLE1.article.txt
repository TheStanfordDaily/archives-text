# Doubts on downsizing
## Senators unsure of passage of ASSU restructuring bill 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
Recent changes to a bill restruc
turing the ASSU Senate have bol
stered its chances for survival, but
senators say the outcome of
tonight's vote depends on the direc
tion of debate.
Passage of the bill may depend on
author Gabe Lucas' ability to con
vince a wary senate that the changes
will actually increase individual sen
ators' sense of responsibility, or at
least convince them to defer the de
cision to the student body.
Many senators are still undecid
ed. "There are some aspects of the
bill that are sort of vague for me,"
said undergraduate senator Grace
Casas-Silva.
The bill outlines a plan to cut the
size of the senate from 40 to 20 and
introduce some form of districting.
If it passes the senate tonight, a
special election will be held later
this month.
If two-thirds of the student body
vote in favor of the measure, the
ASSU Constitution will be amend
ed to enact the changes and the
senate will draft four districting
plans for voters to choose from dur
ing this spring's election. The re
duction in the size of the senate will

eliminate the position of non-vot
ing senator.
Because of the structural
changes, a new senate would then
be elected during fall quarter.
Several senators praised Lucas'
efforts to include other senators in
the revision process, which
changed the bill to allow students
to decide among districting plans.
"He's making a more concerted
effort now to reach out to people,"
said Deputy Senate Chair David
Golob.
When Lucas presented the first
version of his bill, which assigned
each senator to one of six geograph
ical districts, he was criticized for
his failure to involve other senators
and students in drafting the bill.
Some senators also attacked the
plan for its vagueness and its exclu
sive use of geographical districts,
which they said would dilute the in
fluence of minority and graduate
senators.
But despite Lucas' more inclu
sive revision process, there are still
reservations about the bill â€” per
haps enough to kill the measure
unless Lucas can convince the sen
ate of the plan's merits.
