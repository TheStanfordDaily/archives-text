# Doubts on downsizing
## Senators unsure of passage of ASSU restructuring bill 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
Recent changes to a bill restruc
turing the ASSU Senate have bol
stered its chances for survival, but
senators say the outcome of
tonight's vote depends on the direc
tion of debate.
Passage of the bill may depend on
author Gabe Lucas' ability to con
vince a wary senate that the changes
will actually increase individual sen
ators' sense of responsibility, or at
least convince them to defer the de
cision to the student body.
Many senators are still undecid
ed. "There are some aspects of the
bill that are sort of vague for me,"
said undergraduate senator Grace
Casas-Silva.
The bill outlines a plan to cut the
size of the senate from 40 to 20 and
introduce some form of districting.
If it passes the senate tonight, a
special election will be held later
this month.
If two-thirds of the student body
vote in favor of the measure, the
ASSU Constitution will be amend
ed to enact the changes and the
senate will draft four districting
plans for voters to choose from dur
ing this spring's election. The re
duction in the size of the senate will

eliminate the position of non-vot
ing senator.
Because of the structural
changes, a new senate would then
be elected during fall quarter.
Several senators praised Lucas'
efforts to include other senators in
the revision process, which
changed the bill to allow students
to decide among districting plans.
"He's making a more concerted
effort now to reach out to people,"
said Deputy Senate Chair David
Golob.
When Lucas presented the first
version of his bill, which assigned
each senator to one of six geograph
ical districts, he was criticized for
his failure to involve other senators
and students in drafting the bill.
Some senators also attacked the
plan for its vagueness and its exclu
sive use of geographical districts,
which they said would dilute the in
fluence of minority and graduate
senators.
But despite Lucas' more inclu
sive revision process, there are still
reservations about the bill â€” per
haps enough to kill the measure
unless Lucas can convince the sen
ate of the plan's merits.
"Right now 1 don't feel that [the
bill) has two-thirds to pass," under
graduate senator Mork Murdock
said. The main problem to be
resolved in debate, he said, is
whether Lucas' plan will "really
change the way student representa
tion works."
Graduate senator Nawwar Kas
rawi also expressed reservations.
"I'm a little happier in terms of the
process he went through. I'm still
not happy with the bill," he said,
"I'm concerned about the reduc
tion in the size of the senate," Kas
rawi said. "I'm also very concerned
that there has been little debate on
(the re-sizing] issue."
Kasrawi also raised objections to
the vagueness in the bill he said
arose from efforts to make the bill
more inclusive.

Kasrawi also said "very little
effort has been put into planning a
transition" to the new structure of
the senate. For instance, the plan
would require some senators to con
tinue their terms into the beginning
of the next academic year, although
some senators will be graduating.
The gravity of these concerns
makes it difficult to predict the out
come of tonight's vote, senators say.
"A lot of it depends on how much
support Gabe tries to get before
hand," Golob said.
Lucas said he has spent the last
week talking to senators and gather
ing support for his bill. But Golob said
the effort may be an uphill battle.
"I do think there are some under
graduates who don't feel that dis
tricting is a good idea," Golob said,
referring to concerns that interests
of minority and other student
groups would be diluted by geo
graphic districting. "That concern
alone may be enough to kill it."

Undergraduate senator Roberto
Milk also emphasized the impor
tance of retaining some at-large sen
ators so interests dispersed over the
campus can still be represented in
the senate.
"The only way that I will vote for
the bill is if it incorporates interest
based representation," he said, not
ing that many of the people who
approach him for senate-related
help do so on behalf of student
groups.
Lucas pointed out that a vote for
his bill would not necessarily be a
vote for redistricting or re-sizing
the senate; rather, it would be a
vote to let the students decide.
Passage of the bill "is by no
means ... an endorsement," Lucas
said. "It means the senate feels this
is a reasonably important issue to
put to the student iiody."
"If I were to vote for it, it would
be strictly to put it on the ballot,"
Kasrawi said.
