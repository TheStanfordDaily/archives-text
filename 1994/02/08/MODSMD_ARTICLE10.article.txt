## New budget sent to Congress Hundreds of programs will be reduced; no new tax increases 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton sent Congress a $ 1.52 trillion no
frills budget yesterday, declaring cuts in
hundreds of programs would achieve a
deficit-reduction record unequaled since
Harry Truman and show the world "we
mean business."
Clinton's federal spending plan for
1995 includes no new general tax increas
es, but it does propose more than tripling
the cigarette tax to 99 cents a pack to help
finance universal health care.
To find the money for expanding Head
Start, putting 100,000 new police officers
on the streets and increasing government
support for the high-tech jobs of tomor
row, Clinton asked lawmakers to make
cuts large and small
For example, he wants Congress to
slash operating support for urban mass
transit by '25 percent, cut home heating
subsidies in half and eliminate export
subsidies going to oil seed farmers.
Liberals complained the budget cuts
would hurt the poor. Conservatives said
the president virtually ignored the cost of
putting into effect his two most impor
tant initiatives — health care and welfare
reform.

Hut Clinton, speaking to business
executives in Houston, dismissed the
criticism, saying his new budget showed
the world that "we mean business" about
cutting the deficit. Still, he conceded his
plan would face a difficult time in
Congress.
"It's the toughest budget on spending
cuts that Congress has yet seen," Clinton
said.
For the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1,
Clinton proposed spending $34.3 billion
more than this year. That would push
the budget to a record level. But all of the
increase reflected higher spending on
mandatory programs such as Social
Security and interest payments on the
national debt.
Spending on the one-third of the bud
get affected by annual appropriations —
everything from paper clips to battleships
would actually decline by $7.7 billion
below the current level.
And for the first time since Truman
was president, the deficit will have
shrunk for three consecutive years, if
Clinton's forecasts prove accurate. The
president projected that the deficit for
1995 would drop to $176.1 billion. That

would be down from a projected deficit of
$234.8 billion this year. When Clinton
took office, it was expected that the 1995
deficit would be $302 billion.
"To his credit the president has pro
posed terminating some federal pro
grams, representing about one-fifth of 1
percent of the federal budget," said Sen
ate Republican Leader Bob Dole. "We
have seen most of the proposed cuts
before but congressional Democrats
refused to go along when Republican
administrations wielded the budget
knife."
While it took nearly a year for the
administration to get rid of a handful of
programs last year, White House budget
director Leon Panetta believed this year's
attack on an even larger number of pro
grams would be more successful.
Panetta said passage of the budget
was essential to keep long-term interest
rates low and the economic recovery on
track.
As with the program eliminations,
both the Reagan and Bush administra
tions tried to achieve many of the same
fee increases only to have them rejected
by Congress.
