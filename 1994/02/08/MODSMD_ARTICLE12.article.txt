# Clinton extends protection to Sarajevo
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Clinton
administration called on its allies yester
day to extend a protective shield to civil
ians in Sarajevo by threatening air
strikes if Bosnian Serbs continue their
attacks. No more empty threats, the
president said.
The aim is to end the siege of the
Bosnian capital, where 68 civilians were
killed and some '200 injured in an attack
on a Muslim marketplace on Saturday.
It would require a change of heart by
many of the European governments to
whom the Clinton administration has
assigned the primary responsibility for
ending the fighting in the Balkans.
In Houston, Clinton was asked why
the Serbs should take this latest threat of
air strikes seriously, given the West's
previous saber-rattling.
"Let's see what happens in the next

couple of days," the president said. "You
know what I feel about that. I don't think
we should have any more empty threats."
The NATO allies last year blocked a
U.S. appeal to both lift an arms embargo
against the Muslim-led government and
to bomb Bosnian Serb artillery and mor
tar sites if attacks continued.
Partly out of concern U.N. peacekeep
ers might get caught in the cross-fire. But
continued blood-letting in what Secre
tary of Suite Warren Christopher called
"unacceptable actions" by the Serbs was
expected this time to result in allied
unity.
"We expect the North Atlantic Council
will decide on a course of action, on an
overall strategy, within the next few
days," Christopher said after President
Clinton's senior advisers met for a second
dav at the White House.

The NATO meeting will be held on
Wednesday in Brussels, Belgium. The
ambassadors to NATO from the 16 allied
countries are expected to attend.
In Brussels, European Union foreign
ministers yesterday urged the NATO
nations to use all means to lift the siege of
Sarajevo, including the use of air power.
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali on Sunday asked the
NATO allies to authorize use of air power
in response to the shelling of Sarajevo.
About 200,000 people have died in
Bosnia-Herzegovina in 22 months of eth
nic conflict. Bosnian Serbs and Croats
have routed the Muslim-led government
from all but a fraction of the former
Yugoslav republic.
At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary
William Perry said, "air strikes are among
the options being considered now."
