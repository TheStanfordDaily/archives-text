Jordan starts new career
CHICAGO (AP) â€” Forget 80, here
comes Michael.
Michael Jordan made it official yester
day: The retired National Basketball
Association superstar agreed to a minor
league contract with baseball's Chicago
White Sox and is going to spring train
ing.
He said playing baseball was some
thing his father always wanted him to
do.
Jordan, whose father was slain last
summer, has said he was eager to meet a
strong challenge that basketball no
longer provided.
"I've never been afraid to fail," he
said. "That's something you have to deal
with in reality. I think I'm strong

enough as a person to accept failing. But
I can't accept not trying."
The former Chicago Bulls star agreed
to a contract with the Nashville Sounds,
the White Sox's affiliate in the Class
AAA American Association, and said he
would try to make it to the majors.
Schueler and Manager Gene Lamont
saw progress in Jordan's hitting but
both have also said it's a one-in-a-million
chance for him to make a major league
team, despite his athletic abilities.
"He'll have to earn it, nothing's going
to be given to him," General Manager
Ron Schueler said.
Jordan, 31, hasn't played baseball
since high school. He has been taking
batting practice from Schueler, a former
major league pitcher.
