## Editorial The
						people's choice Students should not be forced to cut senate size if they vote for reforms 
### 
Students should only
be allowed to express their
opinion when they are likely
to come to the right decision.
That's what the ASSU Senate's
revamped districting proposal
seems to imply, and senators should
seriously consider the message that
passing it in its present form would
send.
The proposed constitutional
amendment, sponsored by under
graduate senator Gabe Lucas,
would have two effects if ratified in
a special election: first, students
would be allowed to choose what
type of undergraduate districts the
senate would adopt, such as by
house or by class. There would also
be an option to leave the system as it
is, with all at-large senators.
Second, the amendment would
automatically reduce the size of the
senate from 40 members to 20
members â€” 10 graduate students
and 10 undergraduates.
Students would not have the
option of creating districts without
reducing the senate's size.
This discrepancy poses a serious
question about senators' commit
ment to democratic reform. They
know that students are likely to sup
port some type of districting. It has
been discussed for several years as a
way to make undergraduate sena
tors more accountable and respon
sive.
However, reducing the number of
senators is a very new proposal,
whose implications have not been
well discussed. Students are likely to
have some legitimate concerns.

Why should the senate's work
force be diminished if the new dis
tricts are supposed to make all sen
ators accountable? And why should
senators decide how many senators
there should be? Isn't that the right
of the electorate?
The main argument for shrink
ing the senate seems to be that it
currently does not often communi
cate or work together. Council of
Presidents member Ying-Ying Goh
noted that "at the end of the year,
you still have senators who have
never talked to one another."
That observation, however,
reflects poorly on most senators'
commitment to their job rather
than on the senate's size. Many
large parliamentary bodies function
with more effectiveness than the
relatively small ASSU Senate.
Taking a local example, the Fac
ulty Senate has 65 members, all of
whom are busy people. Yet the Fac
ulty Senate has no problem working
together on vital issues for its con
stituents. Ajid its districts are clear
ly delineated.
In the past year alone, the Facul
ty Senate has evaluated and recom
mended changes to the new sexual
harassment policy, raised important
concerns over the recruitment and
retention of graduate students, and
clearly asserted how much power
Stanford's accrediting body should
have over policies on diversity. The
ASSU could benefit by following
this model of many active, districted
senators.
The proposed amendment, how
ever, would force students to accept a
smaller senate if they want districts.
When the amendment goes before
the students, there should be an
option to keep the senate at its cur
rent size and make the 40 members
accountable through districting.
After all, a real democracy is sup
posed to let the people decide.
