## Stanford goes corporate 
### 
THEY'RE taking over. Biking to
class at any given time of the day,
you have to dodge so many conser
vative suits you'd think you were on Wall
Street. Interviewers scouting for corpo
rate America are making their yearly
descent upon Stanford again. And there's
no escape because they're everywhere —
making their confident treks from the
CPPC to the bookstore to the CoHo.
Am I the only person who has this
overwhelming urge to mow them down
with my bike, spill my coffee on their
starched white shirts, and choke them
with their ties? Really, I'm not generally
a violent person. Maybe it's because I've
only been in the CPPC once this year
clad in cut-offs and Birks for my Peace
Corps interview. Maybe it's the smug
disdain of being on the road to $30,000 of
debt by choosing to spend next year in
grad school. But I just don't get it.
In any case, a lot of seniors are trad
ing in spring break packages to Hawaii
for the two-year deluxe job package to
Oblivion, Inc. This absolutely floors me.
1 mean, their ad campaign is perfectly
honest: "Come work 70 hours a week for
us and have no life whatsoever for the
next two years and if we like you, we'll
send you to business school!" That's a
hell of a proposition, but no thanks. I like
having some semblance of a life. Yet 1
know people who elbow others out of the
way and trip over themselves to be the
first in line.

It's fun to watch these people on the
way to their interviews. Some look
uncomfortable in their suits and wobble
on their high heels. Others wear $300
outfits with tennis shoes and white ath
letic socks. I don't worry about those
people. They still have that endearing
touch of human failing in them. They
wear their Nikes defiantly, as if to say,
"Yeah, I really want this, but hey, I'm
still like you."
It's the people who put on the clothes
and immediately age about 20 years that
scare me — a lot. Not only do they seem
to sprout the crinkly eye wrinkles and
distinguished gray at the temples, but
they also adopt practices that are only
supposed to be performed by old people
— like carrying extra hose in your purse
and power walking to an interview with
your briefcase in one hand and a pair of
heels in the other. They can't be human.
These people look at me rushing to
class five minutes late with my baseball
hat and jeans, and think, "I'm in con
trol."
"So what am I?" I indignantly com
municate to them via telepathy.
"You're just another loser going into
debt," they reply, giving a disembodied
laugh and cold smile.
Okay, I admit it, I've never wanted to
grow up. The thought of paying utility
bills, killing insects and cleaning the
bathroom has always been more terrify
ing than empowering to me. Being an

RA, co-terming — they're all my ways of
delaying reality. But are the corporate
to-hes really so much more sophisticat
ed? Is choosing to be completely set up by
some consulting firm really so coura
geous? Or are people just scared of hav
ing to make it on their own in the real
world?
As for the people who are going the
corporate route, I wish them luck and
hope that these seniors get what they're
looking for — be it a job they're genuine
ly interested in, an excuse for having no
life, or the ongoing confirmation that
they are Smart People Going Places
Fast. As for me, I've decided to step off
the achievement track after more than
'20 years of defining myself along some
one else's standards. Maybe I'm just
avoiding rejection by not even dealing.
Maybe I'm questioning the kind of high
status success that has become second
nature for many of us here. In any case,
it's pretty damn liberating to putz along
my merry way for yet another year.
So, you think this'll hurt my chances
with McKinsey next year?
If I'm ever there, shoot me.

by sending telepathic messages to the
state lottery.
