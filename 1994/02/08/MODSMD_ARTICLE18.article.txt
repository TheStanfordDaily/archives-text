## Raimondi technique should be taken with grain of salt 
### 
THE JAN. 31 Daily article on the
"Raimondi technique," a method
for treating various disorders
using electromagnetic fields, was fas
cinating.
If true, this technique could open
up a whole new realm of possibilities
for the treatment of pain.
However, your readers should be
aware that, as described in the article,
the Raimondi technique bears many of
the hallmarks of medical pseudo sci
ence; that is, a treatment of unproved
effectiveness misrepresented as being
scientifically based. Consider the fol
lowing points.
• The research is led by a person
from a different field than the
research suggests. The study director,
we are told, is "Kenneth Eppley, a
theoretical physicist." How does Epp
ley's background in physics qualify
him to oversee clinical trials? Does he
have any experience in evaluating the
subjective reports of patients? People
are not particles — their responses are
affected by their beliefs and expecta
tions. Is this possibility being consid
ered by those conducting the
research?
• The treatment is described as

effective for subjective symptoms, not
objectively measurable dysfunction.
The article said the technique might
be able to fix problems related to
"back and neck pain, insomnia, pre
menstrual syndrome, digestive prob
lems, anxiety and athletic perfor
mance."
With the exception of athletic per
formance, all of the above are symp
toms that may only be evaluated by
the patients themselves; there is no
objective measurement of pain, for
example. Athletic performance —
which is highly susceptible to sugges
tion — is also subjective. Is the Rai
mondi technique useful in treating
anything directly measurable — the
time for a wound to heal, for example?
We are not told, so I must assume it is
not.
In fact, a treatment for self-report
ed symptoms already exists. It is quite
effective and amazingly cheap: the
placebo, or sugar pill. When a doctor
earnestly prescribes medication for
you and insists it will make you feel
better, you often will, even if the med
ication is ineffective; this is known as
the placebo effect. Any treatment for
self-reported symptoms must show

greater effectiveness than a placebo.
• Loose controls and anecdotal evi
dence are used in place of large, well
designed studies. The article states
that "since it is a double-blind study,
participants cannot know whether
they are receiving the Raimondi treat
ment or a control." Unfortunately,
this only describes half of a double
blind study. Just as it is important for
participants not to know whether they
are receiving the treatment, it is
equally important that those judging
the participants' responses not know
who received the treatment. This is
because motivations and desires of a
researcher may unconsciously affect
how that person evaluates evidence.
Simply put, a believer in the Raimondi
technique will tend to interpret a
patient's responses differently than a
non-believer will. This "Experimenter
Effect" is accounted for in well
designed studies.
The article does not state whether
such a controlled experiment has been
successfully carried out and published
in a peer-reviewed journal, so there is
no reason to believe it has. Until then,
anecdotal evidence, such as that pro
vided in the article, is simply irrele-

vant. There was plenty of anecdotal
evidence for the old technique of
"bloodletting" — many doctors were
convinced by their own experience
that the treatment was effective, and
would have scoffed at the idea that
bloodletting was actually counterpro
ductive.
Even if the Raimondi technique is
not shown to be scientifically sound,
this does not necessarily mean it is
useless; it is simply unscientific. For
example, it may be helpful as a ritual
or religious belief. Hut scientific
claims demand scientific rigor. And, as
always with an unorthodox claim, the
burden of proof is borne by the
claimant.
In the end, what determines the
scientific value of the Raimondi tech
nique is its effectiveness. In particu
lar, if the technique is ever offered by
practitioners for monetary gain, the
Stanford community — and indeed the
whole world — deserves to know
whether it is truly an effective treat
ment or an elaborate (and expensive)
sugar pill.
