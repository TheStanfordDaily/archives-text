# Ethnic center benefits Stanford community
## 
### 
In a recent Daily editorial titled
"Hurting the cause?" the editorial
board lamented the "melodramatic
tactics employed by yet another group"
facing possible budget cuts. The criti
cism was in reference to a decision by
Asian-American community leaders to
stage a mock board-up of the Asian
American Activities Center jn order to
raise awareness of the potential out
come of budget cuts.
Apparently, the point of the editori

al was to help the Asian-American
community come up with a better
strategy for lightening the blow of
looming cuts to that and other ethnic
centers.
But their statements did more to
belittle and marginalize than to offer
any real Assistance or valuable advice.
What the editorial board failed to
realize is that the center does not
serve a fringe group, nor does working
to preserve it constitute a "provincial
protest." The center represents the
Stanford community as a whole and
reflects our commitment to diversity
and inclusion.
The center benefits all Stanford stu

dents, both Asian-American and non-
Asian-American. As a non-Asian-
American member of Stanford Taiko, I
have witnessed the value of the center
first-hand. Not only have I been
exposed to a powerful art form that I
might otherwise have missed, I have
also become a member of an exciting
and dynamic Asian-American perform
ing group. And though I feel I have
contributed to Stanford Taiko, I feel
that the development of my identity in
the context of an Asian-American
group has been more important.
If the center's funding were signifi
cantly cut back or eliminated, Stanford
Taiko would have nowhere to meet,

nowhere to rehearse, and nowhere to
store its thirteen drums. Stanford
Taiko would be history, and I would
have missed the opportunity to partici
pate and to learn. As the recent clo
sure of the center demonstrated,
dozens of other student groups would
be displaced or would cease to exist,
affecting hundreds of students.
The Daily editorial board should
feel free to suggest different approach
es to garnering support for the Center,
but if it wishes to be taken seriously a
little less condescension would go a
long way.
