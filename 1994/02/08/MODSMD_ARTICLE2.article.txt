# Field narrowing in search for new dean
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Several months after the for
mer dean of the School of Educa
tion jetted off to Washington,
D.C., the process to select his suc
cessor is in full swing.
The committee searching for a
new dean at one point had almost
100 names on its list of possibili
ties but is now narrowing its na
tionwide search, said Lee Shul
man, who co-chairs the search
committee with Provost Con
doleezza Rice.
The new dean will follow in the
footsteps of Marshall Smith, who
was named undersecretary of edu
cation in the Clinton administra
tion last March. Smith took a leave
of absence from the faculty and re
signed as dean at that time. Acting
Dean Nel Noddings' term expires
in August.
Because of the numerous ways
in which the committee could
have found its candidates, there is
no formal number of applicants.
"A number of folks applied direct
ly in response to ads," Shulman

said. "Many were nominated by
members of the broad educational
community whom we wrote or
who saw the ads. Most of those
nominated had not applied. Also,
members of the Stanford faculty
nominated individuals from both
inside and outside the Universi
ty"
At this point the committee has
written to "all those whom we
would like to consider seriously"
and asked them to express interest
in the position, he said.
In addition to the approximate
ly 40 names on this list, there are
several internal nominees, "most
of whom have not expressed inter
est at this time."
"Mv personal opinion is that
the applicant / nominee pool is
superb, including a number of in
dividuals who could serve as dean
in a fine manner," Shulman said
"Since there are far more nomi
nees than applicants at this date,
we don't know how many of them
could be enticed to leave their
present positions for the pres
sures of Stanford deanship,
including unbelievably high
housing costs (and) occasionally
earthquakes."
The search committee will
attempt to narrow its focus to 10
or 12 finalists by the end of this
month, Shulman said. "Then we
begin the hard work of learning
much more about each person to
decide which three or four to
invite for interviews."
The committee's ultimate goal

is to provide a short list of three
candidates by early May to Uni
versity President Gerhard
Casper, who will make the final
choice.
Shulman said it is not unusual
for a search committee to consid
er people who had not directly
applied for the position.
"Just as an example, our for
mer dean, Marshall Smith, never
applied for the job, was nominat
ed from the outside and the
inside, had to be cajoled into even
making a visit . . . and ended up
being a great dean," Shulman
said. "So the process isn't all that
straightforward."
