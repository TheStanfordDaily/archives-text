Several months after the for
mer dean of the School of Educa
tion jetted off to Washington,
D.C., the process to select his suc

The committee searching for a
new dean at one point had almost

"Mv personal opinion is that
the applicant / nominee pool is
superb, including a number of in
dividuals who could serve as dean
in a fine manner," Shulman said
