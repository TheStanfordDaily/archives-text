# N'Gai Croal: fly in the buttermilk
## Farm labor: shovelling the administration's bull 
### 
town meeting (toun me'ting) 1 a meeting
of the qualified voters of a town to act
upon town business 2. Provost Con
doleezza Rice's upcoming I'li campaign
for budget cuts, where she will give stu
dents, staff and faculty the same, tired
non-information — if they let her
IMAGINE IF you will, a university. A
place where administrators exclude
the academic community and its staff
support from the decision-making pro
cess. Where administrators withhold cru
cial information, particularly comprehen
sive budget data, then mock those who
would engage them for not having that
data. And where top administrators use
an alleged budget deficit — remember,
we've never seen the line-item figures —
to restructure as they alone see fit.
You are about to enter The Stanford
Zone.
The current resident fellow revolt
against Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds' plan to place Residential
Education under the jurisdiction of Hous
ing and Dining Services is a perfect exam

ple of the "mobilization politics" that Rice
hits little respect for It's also a construc
tive, effective and long-overdue response
to an administration that brings these
problems on itself by making crucial deci
sions in a vacuum.
By drafting alternate plans to
Edmonds' plan, the mutiny many have
predicted is now coming to pass. EAST
house RF Jim Ketelaar says that he's "yet
to meet an RF who supports [Edmonds')
idea." President Casper and Rice constant
ly speak of the need to focus on the Uni
versity's academic mission. But assigning
Food Service to direct Res Ed has nothing
to do with academics — it's purely a busi
ness decision. This is par for the course
when the Administration speaks of mak
ing Stanford "lean and mean" — more
corporate than intellectual.
Now the lean meanies, led by Rice, will
hold a series of two-hour "town meetings"
to discuss the budget-cutting process,
along with other campus administrators.
1 use the term "discuss" loosely,
because it's hard to believe that Rice seeks
input when she's quoted in Campus

Report as saying, "We can't mobilize the
university community every time we go
through the budget process or students
won't study, faculty won't teach and staff
won't get any work done." Replace the
words "can't" with "refuse to," and we
have a far more honest statement than
any Rice has given to date.
Still, these town meetings can be pro
ductive. As long as concerned people come
prepared to shovel through the rhetorical
cow dung that Rice and company have
prepared for our consumption, perhaps
the truth beneath it can be uncovered.
1. Students, faculty and staff should
refuse to attend any town meeting unless
Rice asks Chief Financial Officer Van
Etten to make copies of the line-item Uni
versity budget and income statement
available to those who want it. What is
the point of talking to Rice about the bud
get if we don't the same information that
she has?
2. Request that Rice place a moratori
um on any statement that begins with the
words "These are the four sources of
Stanford's income . . . ." We know what

the four sources are. Perhaps if we actual
ly saw the budget, she could save her
energy to answer new questions.
3. Once these ground rules are in place,
attend every meeting with specific infor
mation in hand. And don't be afraid to
ask the same question over and over
again. Anyone who has tried to get a spe
cific answer out of Rice on the budget cuts
knows that it's like pulling teeth. But like
good dentists, we've got to keep tugging
until the truth comes loose.
5. Ask Rice to expound on the differ
ences between "excellent" and "mediocre"
student services. Could excellence or lack
thereof depend on the amount of institu
tional support the services receive?
6. Rice herself says of budget cuts and
restructuring, "It is simply efficient to ask
the people who know the units best." Pre
sumably, this doesn't include students or
faculty who use these units, since they are
only now being informed — not consulted.
So does Rice's quest to root out medi
ocrity extend to administrators such as
Edmonds, for not asking the RF's — who
know Res Ed best — about her proposed

changes?
7. Don't be afraid to engage the debate
on a business level. The less features a
product has (e.g. a car), the less customers
are expect to pay for it. Why does Stan
ford's corporate administration continue
to raise prices on tuition for a product
that has fewer and fewer features?
After gathering the few crumbs of fac
tual information from Rice's table and
exposing the sham of her town meetings,
it's time to emulate the RFs and propose
alternate plans for dealing with the bud
get and the restructuring of the Universi
ty. We students must create an institution
that won't take us back in time, but that
will prepare us for the future. A future
that Rice ar.d company won't be around
to see — or have to deal with.

N Gai Croal is willing to work with any
one who wants shovel through the admin
istration 's rhetoric. He can be reached at

doleezza Rice's upcoming I'li campaign
for budget cuts, where she will give stu
dents, staff and faculty the same, tired
non-information — if they let her
IMAGINE IF you will, a university. A
place where administrators exclude
the academic community and its staff
support from the decision-making pro
cess. Where administrators withhold cru
cial information, particularly comprehen
sive budget data, then mock those who
would engage them for not having that
data. And where top administrators use
an alleged budget deficit — remember,
we've never seen the line-item figures —
to restructure as they alone see fit.
You are about to enter The Stanford
Zone.
The current resident fellow revolt
against Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds' plan to place Residential
Education under the jurisdiction of Hous
ing and Dining Services is a perfect exam

ple of the "mobilization politics" that Rice
hits little respect for It's also a construc
tive, effective and long-overdue response
to an administration that brings these
problems on itself by making crucial deci
sions in a vacuum.
By drafting alternate plans to
Edmonds' plan, the mutiny many have
predicted is now coming to pass. EAST
house RF Jim Ketelaar says that he's "yet
to meet an RF who supports [Edmonds')
idea." President Casper and Rice constant
ly speak of the need to focus on the Uni
versity's academic mission. But assigning
Food Service to direct Res Ed has nothing
to do with academics — it's purely a busi
ness decision. This is par for the course
when the Administration speaks of mak
ing Stanford "lean and mean" — more
corporate than intellectual.
Now the lean meanies, led by Rice, will
hold a series of two-hour "town meetings"
to discuss the budget-cutting process,
along with other campus administrators.
1 use the term "discuss" loosely,
because it's hard to believe that Rice seeks
input when she's quoted in Campus

Report as saying, "We can't mobilize the
university community every time we go
through the budget process or students
won't study, faculty won't teach and staff
won't get any work done." Replace the
words "can't" with "refuse to," and we
have a far more honest statement than
any Rice has given to date.
Still, these town meetings can be pro
ductive. As long as concerned people come
prepared to shovel through the rhetorical
cow dung that Rice and company have
prepared for our consumption, perhaps
the truth beneath it can be uncovered.
1. Students, faculty and staff should
refuse to attend any town meeting unless
Rice asks Chief Financial Officer Van
Etten to make copies of the line-item Uni
versity budget and income statement
available to those who want it. What is
the point of talking to Rice about the bud
get if we don't the same information that
she has?
2. Request that Rice place a moratori
um on any statement that begins with the
words "These are the four sources of
Stanford's income . . . ." We know what

the four sources are. Perhaps if we actual
ly saw the budget, she could save her
energy to answer new questions.
3. Once these ground rules are in place,
attend every meeting with specific infor
mation in hand. And don't be afraid to
ask the same question over and over
again. Anyone who has tried to get a spe
cific answer out of Rice on the budget cuts
knows that it's like pulling teeth. But like
good dentists, we've got to keep tugging
until the truth comes loose.
5. Ask Rice to expound on the differ
ences between "excellent" and "mediocre"
student services. Could excellence or lack
thereof depend on the amount of institu
tional support the services receive?
6. Rice herself says of budget cuts and
restructuring, "It is simply efficient to ask
the people who know the units best." Pre
sumably, this doesn't include students or
faculty who use these units, since they are
only now being informed — not consulted.
So does Rice's quest to root out medi
ocrity extend to administrators such as
Edmonds, for not asking the RF's — who
know Res Ed best — about her proposed

changes?
7. Don't be afraid to engage the debate
on a business level. The less features a
product has (e.g. a car), the less customers
are expect to pay for it. Why does Stan
ford's corporate administration continue
to raise prices on tuition for a product
that has fewer and fewer features?
After gathering the few crumbs of fac
tual information from Rice's table and
exposing the sham of her town meetings,
it's time to emulate the RFs and propose
alternate plans for dealing with the bud
get and the restructuring of the Universi
ty. We students must create an institution
that won't take us back in time, but that
will prepare us for the future. A future
that Rice ar.d company won't be around
to see — or have to deal with.
