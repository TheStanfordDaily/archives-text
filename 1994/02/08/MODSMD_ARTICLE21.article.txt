## Tong and Stanford: a perfect match Texas transfer provides Cardinal with freestyling strength, eyes NCAAs 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
The world of college athletic recruiting can be
vicious and unkind. Just ask the University of
Texas swimming program, which got the real
southern shaft after one of the best freestylists
in the nation transferred to Stanford this year.
So why did sophomore Jessica Tong go from
being the 'lone star' of Texas to being a member
of the Cardinal's top-ranked squad? Academics,
friendships and swim competition might be
plausible reasons. But in this particular case,
they're not.
"I really wasn't a happy person," Tong said of
her one-year tenure with the Longhorns. "I had
bad allergies with the humid climate down there,
I was sick and I just couldn't swim fast."
Thus, mother nature proved to be a great
asset to the Cardinal.
"I really wanted Jessica when she graduated
from high school," Stanford head coach Richard
Quick said. "I was thrilled that she decided to
transfer."
Tong's swimming ways began when she was
five years old. "My mother threw me into a sum
mer swimming program," Tong said. "1 didn't
know what I was getting into."
What she was getting into was her true call
ing. She continued swimming until seventh
grade, when she gave up the sport for volleyball.
"I had visions of being a stud volleyball play
er," Tong said.
But the stud volleyball player turned into a
stud swimmer after her freshman year in high
school in Long Beach, Calif. After travelling to
Texas with a club team, she decided to give up
volleyball in favor of her better sport, swim
ming.
In her three years of high school swimming
she racked up a shelf load of honors. She won all
four of her events — the 50-, 100- and 200-yard
freestyle and the 100 backstroke — at the 1992
Junior Nationals competition. She also set
national records in all four events. She set the
national high school record in the 100 back and
won the California state championships 10 times
in her different events. And as if her swimming
accomplishments were not enough, she even
captured the state crown in volleyball after her
squad won the division one title.
Needless to say, Tong was a hot commodity
when college came around. She finally decided to
go to Texas, and her quirky reasons for choosing

one of the largest colleges in the nation were per
haps the same as any other graduate of a small,
private high school.
"1 just wanted to bust out and go to the
biggest school 1 could find," Tong said.
Ironically, it was the size factor that also
influenced her decision to leave Texas. The
school, with more than 50,000 students and a
huge emphasis on athletics, was just too much
for her.
"It was overwhelming," Tong said. "When
you go to a jock school you live with the team, eat
with the team .... It was rather confining, not
being able to take part in the regular college
activities."
In addition, the coach and athletic director
that Tong had originally signed with at Texas
left before she even arrived in Austin. The new
coach at Texas during 'long's freshman year was
a former athlete under Quick, ajid it was her
first time coaching a top-10 university squad. "It
just wasn't a strong enough program for me to
stay," Tong said.
However, she holds no grudges against her
former team or teammates. "My best friend still
swims there," she said.
While struggling in the pool, Tong enjoyed
the academic programs in Austin. She was in the
honors program, appropriately called the "bar
gain ivy league." And while the liberal arts pro
gram with the Longhorns did not suit her every
need, academics was not a driving force behind
her transfer, she said.
"I didn't swim a single best time last year,"
Tong said of her disappointing season with
Texas. "It was like 1 was going to this huge
swimming powerhouse school, but I was sacrific
ing academics for it, wasn't swimming well and
was sick, miserable and always calling home."
She has been happy since the move.
"Richard 1 Quick] has been really supportive,"
Tong said. "He knows what you need to do to be
the best in this sport and also do well in aca
demics."
Now that she is at Stanford, Tong hopes to
capitalize on her goals and add to her success.
She finished as an Ail-American in the 200 free
last year for Texas in the NCAA tournament,
but she has even greater goals for herself during
her Stanford fling.
"I want to win three NCAA titles for this
school," Tong said.
She also hopes to make the World Champi
onships and, perhaps, a trip to the Olympics.

"That would be a dream come true," she said of
the summer games. "I'm not going to say that
I'm going, but don't count me out."
This year she hopes to be a part of the nation
al record teams in the 400 and 800 free relays for
Stanford and place in the top four in all three of
her events at NCAAs. From the way her coaches
and teammates talk about her ability, she is
capable of reaching all of her goals.
"She's just a tremendous talent," Quick said.
"And she's a developing talent. She has an enor
mous future in competitive swimming."
Teammate Mary Ellen Blanchard agreed.
"She's a great asset in the sprinting area of our
team."
By transferring to Stanford, l ong put herself
on the same team as Olympian and national
champion Jenny Thompson. Thompson swims
some of the same events as Tong, but Tong has
been more than happy to step in and accept
whatever role she may play on the team.
"Jenny is one of my best friends," she said. "I
really respect her. She's the most amazing phys
ical presence, I love to watch her swim. Everyone
has goals to shoot for, and she helps me do that
every day."
As a member of the Cardinal squad, Tong
enjoys competing on an individual and team
basis. "Being on this team is far and away more
important than my individual goals," she said.
Last weekend Tong had the opportunity to
swim against her former teammates when the
Longhorns came to Stanford for a No. 1 versus
No. 2 dual meet. As it turned out, the Cardinal
crushed the Longhorns.
"It felt great to beat them," long said.
"They're my friends now, but when you step up
onto the blocks you're swimming against other
competitors."
Tong finished second behind Thompson in
her freestyle event, beating out rival B.J. Bed
ford from Texas. After the meet Bedford
approached her former teammate.
"She told me that she really wanted to beat
me," Tong said. "I told her that it's all fair in fun
and games."
Tong's positive attitude is recognized and
appreciated by her team. "Jessica is a very
happy-go-lucky person," Quick said.
"She's totally outgoing and has a great per
sonality," Blanchard said. "I'm glad we stole her
from Texas."
Looks like Tong is destined to be a star, be it
a lone star or a Cardinal star.

influenced her decision to leave Texas. The
school, with more than 50,000 students and a
huge emphasis on athletics, was just too much
for her.
"It was overwhelming," Tong said. "When
you go to a jock school you live with the team, eat
with the team .... It was rather confining, not
being able to take part in the regular college
activities."
In addition, the coach and athletic director
that Tong had originally signed with at Texas
left before she even arrived in Austin. The new
coach at Texas during 'long's freshman year was
a former athlete under Quick, ajid it was her
first time coaching a top-10 university squad. "It
just wasn't a strong enough program for me to
stay," Tong said.
However, she holds no grudges against her
former team or teammates. "My best friend still
swims there," she said.
While struggling in the pool, Tong enjoyed
the academic programs in Austin. She was in the
honors program, appropriately called the "bar
gain ivy league." And while the liberal arts pro
gram with the Longhorns did not suit her every
need, academics was not a driving force behind
her transfer, she said.
"I didn't swim a single best time last year,"
Tong said of her disappointing season with
Texas. "It was like 1 was going to this huge
swimming powerhouse school, but I was sacrific
ing academics for it, wasn't swimming well and
was sick, miserable and always calling home."
She has been happy since the move.
"Richard 1 Quick] has been really supportive,"
Tong said. "He knows what you need to do to be
the best in this sport and also do well in aca
demics."
Now that she is at Stanford, Tong hopes to
capitalize on her goals and add to her success.
She finished as an Ail-American in the 200 free
last year for Texas in the NCAA tournament,
but she has even greater goals for herself during
her Stanford fling.
"I want to win three NCAA titles for this
school," Tong said.
She also hopes to make the World Champi
onships and, perhaps, a trip to the Olympics.

"That would be a dream come true," she said of
the summer games. "I'm not going to say that
I'm going, but don't count me out."
This year she hopes to be a part of the nation
al record teams in the 400 and 800 free relays for
Stanford and place in the top four in all three of
her events at NCAAs. From the way her coaches
and teammates talk about her ability, she is
capable of reaching all of her goals.
"She's just a tremendous talent," Quick said.
"And she's a developing talent. She has an enor
mous future in competitive swimming."
Teammate Mary Ellen Blanchard agreed.
"She's a great asset in the sprinting area of our
team."
By transferring to Stanford, l ong put herself
on the same team as Olympian and national
champion Jenny Thompson. Thompson swims
some of the same events as Tong, but Tong has
been more than happy to step in and accept
whatever role she may play on the team.
"Jenny is one of my best friends," she said. "I
really respect her. She's the most amazing phys
ical presence, I love to watch her swim. Everyone
has goals to shoot for, and she helps me do that
every day."
As a member of the Cardinal squad, Tong
enjoys competing on an individual and team
basis. "Being on this team is far and away more
important than my individual goals," she said.
Last weekend Tong had the opportunity to
swim against her former teammates when the
Longhorns came to Stanford for a No. 1 versus
No. 2 dual meet. As it turned out, the Cardinal
crushed the Longhorns.
"It felt great to beat them," long said.
"They're my friends now, but when you step up
onto the blocks you're swimming against other
competitors."
Tong finished second behind Thompson in
her freestyle event, beating out rival B.J. Bed
ford from Texas. After the meet Bedford
approached her former teammate.
"She told me that she really wanted to beat
me," Tong said. "I told her that it's all fair in fun
and games."
Tong's positive attitude is recognized and
appreciated by her team. "Jessica is a very
happy-go-lucky person," Quick said.
"She's totally outgoing and has a great per
sonality," Blanchard said. "I'm glad we stole her
from Texas."
Looks like Tong is destined to be a star, be it
a lone star or a Cardinal star.

A welcome addition to the top-ranked Cardinal, Jessica Tong
receives a bit of advice from Stanford coach Richard Quick. This
weekend Tong competed against her former teammates of Texas.
She hopes to win three NCAA titles during her time at Stanford.
The world of college athletic recruiting can be
vicious and unkind. Just ask the University of
Texas swimming program, which got the real
southern shaft after one of the best freestylists
in the nation transferred to Stanford this year.
So why did sophomore Jessica Tong go from
being the 'lone star' of Texas to being a member
of the Cardinal's top-ranked squad? Academics,
friendships and swim competition might be
plausible reasons. But in this particular case,
they're not.
"I really wasn't a happy person," Tong said of
her one-year tenure with the Longhorns. "I had
bad allergies with the humid climate down there,
I was sick and I just couldn't swim fast."
Thus, mother nature proved to be a great
asset to the Cardinal.
"I really wanted Jessica when she graduated
from high school," Stanford head coach Richard
Quick said. "I was thrilled that she decided to
transfer."
Tong's swimming ways began when she was
five years old. "My mother threw me into a sum
mer swimming program," Tong said. "1 didn't
know what I was getting into."
What she was getting into was her true call
ing. She continued swimming until seventh
grade, when she gave up the sport for volleyball.
"I had visions of being a stud volleyball play
er," Tong said.
But the stud volleyball player turned into a
stud swimmer after her freshman year in high
school in Long Beach, Calif. After travelling to
Texas with a club team, she decided to give up
volleyball in favor of her better sport, swim
ming.
In her three years of high school swimming
she racked up a shelf load of honors. She won all
four of her events — the 50-, 100- and 200-yard
freestyle and the 100 backstroke — at the 1992
Junior Nationals competition. She also set
national records in all four events. She set the
national high school record in the 100 back and
won the California state championships 10 times
in her different events. And as if her swimming
accomplishments were not enough, she even
captured the state crown in volleyball after her
squad won the division one title.
Needless to say, Tong was a hot commodity
when college came around. She finally decided to
go to Texas, and her quirky reasons for choosing

one of the largest colleges in the nation were per
haps the same as any other graduate of a small,
private high school.
"1 just wanted to bust out and go to the
biggest school 1 could find," Tong said.
Ironically, it was the size factor that also
influenced her decision to leave Texas. The
school, with more than 50,000 students and a
huge emphasis on athletics, was just too much
