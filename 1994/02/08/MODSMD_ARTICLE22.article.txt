# Men's tennis challenges Spartans

### Mike Langford Staff writer 
What promises to be a fierce battle in the No. 1
singles court will highlight today's match pitting the
Stanford men's tennis team against its southern
neighbors from San Jose State.
"San Jose State is much improved from last
year," said Stanford head coach I)ick Gould. "They
have some guys returning, and have more depth.
It'll be a good match, especially at No. 1 singles."
Spartan senior Brandon Coupe's current nation
al ranking of No. 10 should move up after his semi
final showing at the prestigious Rolex National
Indoors Tournament, held last weekend in Dallas.
Even more impressively, Coupe qualified for the San
Jose Volvo tournament two weekends ago by beat
ing three touring professionals.
"I think he's one of the top five players in the
country," Gould said. "We've never beaten him."
On the other side of the net will be Stanford's No.
1 player, senior Michael Flanagan, who also compet
ed at Rolex Indoors. Flanagan won his first match at
the tournament, beating Oklahoma State's Tom
Janda. However, serving troubles plagued Flanagan
in his second-round match against Texas Chris
tian's Paul Robinson.
"Mike had trouble getting his first serve in, which
really hurt his whole game," said Stanford assistant

head coach John Whitlinger. "He couldn't get into a
rhythm. If his serve had gotten in, it would've been
a whole different match."
Stanford's other entrant in the singles draw at
the Rolex tournament was sophomore Jim Thomas.
Seeded fifth in the tournament, Thomas faced his
first real competition months after suffering an
injured rotator cuff earlier in the season. Although
he lost 7-6, 6-4 to North Carolina's David Caldwell,
Thomas "did a lot of good things," according to
Whitlinger.
"It was nice to see Jim get the chance to play,"
Whitlinger said. "He's not match-tough yet, but the
positive thing was just to get him playing."
For the first time this season, health will not be a
factor in the determination of the match-ups, and
for that reason Thomas will most likely play singles
today against the Spartans somewhere in the lineup.
Other singles' matches will most likely feature
Robert Devens, Jeff Salzenstein, Chris Cocotos and
Vimal Patel.
Patel and Salzenstein paired up for doubles at
Rolex, and performed above all expectation. In the
first round, the duo beat the second-seeded team of
Southern Alabama's Peter Kuhn and Clive Ullyet.
"I was very impressed (with the play of Patel and
Salzenstein]," Whitlinger said. "They stuck togeth-
