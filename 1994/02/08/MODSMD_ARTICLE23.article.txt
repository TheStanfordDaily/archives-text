# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
The February drizzle could not dampen
Stanford athletics this weekend as the figura
tive sun shown on swimmers, hitters and
hoopsters alike. Many teams are now embark
ing on the second halves of their regular sea
sons with each win becoming more and more
crucial as NCAAs loom on the none-too-distant
horizon. Both men's and women's basketball

teams unleashed their hydro-power against
the Oregon State Beavers Saturday night
while women's swimming pounded its suppos
edly closest competitor, No. 2 Texas, 187-113.
Amid the thick smattering of Cardinal wins
emerge this week's Athletes of the Week, Anita
Kaplan and Derek Weatherford. Both played
instrumental roles in key victories and should
navigate the women's basketball and men's
swim teams into the post-season waters.
In her 22-point performance Saturday
night, junior center Anita Kaplan topped the
Cardinal ranks in scoring while adding 10
rebounds in the squad's 88-67 victory.
Targeting the hoop for six points in the first
half of the contest, Kaplan catapulted the Car
dinal to an early lead and set the tone for the
rest of the night.
Her weekend performance was preceded by
an equally impressive showing last Thursday
against Oregon with 25 points. As the lone cen
ter on the Cardinal roster, Kaplan's early game
contributions have been pivotal not only on the
scoreboard but also as morale boosters.

As Kaplan's court work led the women
hoopsters this weekend at home, Weather
ford took on a similar role as a key figure in
Stanford's double victory weekend over
UCIJ\ and USC.
In the 100-yard backstroke, Weatherford,
a senior, posted a split time of 48.17 seconds,
setting a pool record at USC's McDonald's

Swim Stadium in the process.
Joining teammates Joe Hudepohl and Bill
Schell as Stanford's three "double winners"
in the Trojan meet, Weatherford also cap
tured the 200 IM and 200 back races. As the
Cardinal wraps up its dual-meet season,
Weatherford is looking to defend his 200
back national title.
