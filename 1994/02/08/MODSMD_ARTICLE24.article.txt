# Live from the Deandome
## Making the journey down Tobacco Road

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. - Col
lege basketball has a new
number-one team (again)
but this one should sit perched in
that spot for awhile. The Universi
ty of North Carolina is a team that
has earned its ranking.
Last Thursday, the state of
North Carolina

stood still as the
nation's top two
men's basketball
programs met in
Chapel Hill. The
visiting Duke
Blue Devils trav
eled twenty min
utes on highway
15-501 to clash
with the North

Carolina Tar Heels in the "Duel in
the Deandome."
Any matchup between these
perennial powerhouses is always
special. Remarkably, this
encounter had extra significance
because for the first time ever in
190 meetings, the schools entered
the game holding the top two posi
tions in the polls. Bragging rights
were at stake not only for Tobacco
Road, but also for the country.

And everyone in the Tar Heel
state knew this. All 21,592 seats in
the Dean E. Smith center were
filled. No. 1 Duke, accustomed to
the support of the Cameron Cra
zies, was determined to silence the
fans of the No. 2 Tar Heels.
For the first part of the first

half, the Devils
did just that,
playing tough
inside defense.
But the Tar
Heels managed
to pull within
two, 40-38, by
halftime.
Th e
scene was set for

big-time college
basketball at its best: two schools,
rich in tradition, replete with great
athletes; the two best teams in the
NCAA's finest hoops league — the
Atlantic Coast Conference. The
Duke-UNC rivalry is so intense
that local citizens argue over what
color blue the sky is (Duke's royal
blue or Carolina's baby blue). Even
the mascots mixed it up, as UNC's

hardwood when the Devil tried to
parade in front of the Carolina
student section.
A quick glance at the sidelines
revealed college basketball's mar
quee coaching minds standing
toe-to-toe. Yet on this night, Duke
coach Mike Krzyzewski was at a
disadvantage. His team had less
depth than his opponent's. Plus,
the game was played in a stadium

named for his counterpart.
These shortcomings surfaced
after the intermission, as the
Heels took over. The noise in the
Deandome was deafening, reach
ing a crucible as Tar Heel fresh
man Rasheed Wallace dunked
over Duke center Cherokee
Parks.
Carolina blew open the game,
and Duke, despite the efforts of
Grant Hill, could not recover.
Throughout the second half, ush
ers instructed the Carolina stu
dent section not to rush the court
until the Duke (or "Dork" as they
are called by the Carolina faith

ful) players left the court. The
scoreboard read UNC 89, Duke 78
as the buzzer sounded, and all
warnings were disregarded. The
party began.
As No. 2 was definitively No. 1
— at least for now — there was
much to celebrate. Franklin
Street, the main drag in Chapel
Hill, was shut off to traffic. A bon
fire was lit in the middle of the
street, and surrounding trees
were "decorated" in honor of the
Heels.
When 45 seconds remained in
the game and UNC was comfort
ably in front, the crowd chanted

"overrated" at Duke. Yet coach
Smith waved them off, saying
"there's still time, there's still
time." Coach Krzyzewski indicat
ed his "kids" would recover (and
they did Saturday against Clem
son), while both squads pointed to
Round 2 on March 5 at Duke's
Cameron Indoor Stadium.
Such is basketball on Tobacco
Road. And as the sun rose the
next day in the southeast, the sky
shined Carolina blue.

his thesis research to do some bas
ketball research.
