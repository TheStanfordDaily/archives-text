CHAPEL HILL, N.C. - Col
lege basketball has a new
number-one team (again)
but this one should sit perched in
that spot for awhile. The Universi
ty of North Carolina is a team that
has earned its ranking.
Last Thursday, the state of
North Carolina

stood still as the
nation's top two
men's basketball
programs met in
Chapel Hill. The
visiting Duke
Blue Devils trav
eled twenty min
utes on highway
15-501 to clash
with the North

Carolina Tar Heels in the "Duel in
the Deandome."
Any matchup between these
perennial powerhouses is always

encounter had extra significance
because for the first time ever in
190 meetings, the schools entered
the game holding the top two posi
tions in the polls. Bragging rights
were at stake not only for Tobacco
Road, but also for the country.

And everyone in the Tar Heel
state knew this. All 21,592 seats in
the Dean E. Smith center were
filled. No. 1 Duke, accustomed to
the support of the Cameron Cra
zies, was determined to silence the
fans of the No. 2 Tar Heels.
For the first part of the first

half, the Devils
did just that,
playing tough
inside defense.

Heels managed
to pull within

Th e
scene was set for

big-time college
basketball at its best: two schools,
rich in tradition, replete with great
athletes; the two best teams in the
NCAA's finest hoops league â€” the
Atlantic Coast Conference. The
Duke-UNC rivalry is so intense
that local citizens argue over what
color blue the sky is (Duke's royal
blue or Carolina's baby blue). Even
the mascots mixed it up, as UNC's
