# Wrestlers succumb to Fullerton

The Cardinal wrestlers are left with both
good and bad news after this weekend's frantic
schedule ofCal State-Fullerton Friday and the
All-Cal Invite Saturday at San Francisco State.
The 28-9 loss to Fullerton in Burnham
Pavilion Friday night falls under the bad news
heading, as Stanford could achieve just three
match victories out of the ten weight classes
against the Titans.
The Cardinal was clearly the less experi
enced of the two teams. Whereas nine of
Fullerton's starters were seniors, the Cardinal
started two juniors, four sophomores and four
freshmen. The absence of two key starters to
injuries, 126-pounder Matt Cano and senior
Lance Johnson (150 lbs.), further diminished
the starting experience.
"Stanford is a really young team, maybe
youngest in the [Pacific 10 Conference]," said
Titan coach Ardeshir Asgari. "They are very
talented, but experience does a lot."
The Cardinal had an early lead over Fuller
ton after junior Ramy Saad beat Titan Kevin
Mabry 3-1, in the 118 match. In what
appeared to be an even contest, Ramy scored a
two-point takedown in the last minute of the
final period to secure the win.
Saad attributes his first match win this sea
son to his changing attitude. "I'm more confi
dent in myself," said Saad. "I feel like I'm
wrestling at a higher intensity level."
Sophomore Ed Medina, filling in for Cano,
scored an early takedown against Jeff Maes
but could not evade enough shots to come

away with a win. Cardinal Jimmy Aguirre,
wrestling at 134 for the first time this year,
countered his teammate's loss with a crucial
8-4 victory over Farzin Daneshnia. Aguirre
scored two takedowns and an escape in the
final period to complete the win. This added
three points to the team score.
The final Cardinal win of the meet was at
the hands of sophomore Tod Surmon,
wrestling at 150 instead of his usual 158. In
the close match against Fullerton's James
Goswick, Surmon managed a takedown in the
third period to win it, 3-1.
Junior Jay Jackson(l42) suffered a disap
pointing loss to senior Kenny Workman, 7-2.
Jackson, who usually wrestles at 134, scored a
takedown in the second period, but Workman
accrued two-point reversals in the both the
second and final periods to stay ahead.
At 158, Titan Christian Holiday played cat
and-mouse with freshman Scott Chapman,
securing takedowns to every one of Chap
man's escapes. Freshman Jason Gladden had
a similar time with Laszlo Molnar, losing 12-6.
Gladden looked quick while evading Molnar's
shots, but could not come up with any suc
cessful shots of his own to rack up a takedown.
Freshman Bryan Vaniman aggressively
sought the takedown against Titan Cris
Abrego. The 177-pounder scored three escapes
but did not compensate for Abrego's two take
downs in the first period, losing 5-3.
Entering the final two matches of the meet,
the Cardinal team was behind 16-9. Unfortu
nately, it could not climb out of the hole, as
freshman Chris Serjak (190) and heavyweight
Scott Whitt were pinned by their opponents.

"Honestly, I was discouraged," said head
coach Chris Horpel. "We didn't wrestle up to
our potential, and I'm not content until that
happens." This loss makes the Cardinal 2-7 in
dual meet competition.
The following day, however, the Cardinal
encountered some better fortune. At the All-
Cal Invite, Stanford finished fourth out of the
seven California teams.
Stanford's Medina almost avenged his loss
to Titan Jeff Maes at the invite, but settled for
second place at 126 Also taking second place
was Jackson, who lost to Dewayne Zinkin of
Fresno State 4-2, in the 134 finals. Aguirre
took third place in the same division after los
ing to Zinkin in the semis.
"I felt I had wrestled well all tourney, but
that match I was a little off," said Aguirre.
Chapman took third place at 158 after los
ing to Fullerton's Holiday. Vaniman made it
to the semifinals, and lost in a 30-second tie
breaker where the top man wins the match.
Tomorrow the Cardinal wrestles in its final
dual meet against UC-Davis in Burnham
Pavilion. Horpel thinks the meet will be a
close one, especially due to significant holes in
the lineup from injuries. Cano and Johnson
will not wrestle, and Horpel is unsure whether
Medina will be able to cut weight to 126 in
time for the meet.
"We're a better tournament team (than
I)avis|, but we don't match up particularly well
with them in duals," Horpel said. "It's nice to
have five guys we can always rely on, but if their
good guys are better then ours, we have to rely
on some of the younger | wrestlers]. That makes
the meet chancy."
