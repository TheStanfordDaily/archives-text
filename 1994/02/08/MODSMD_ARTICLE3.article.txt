# Dr. Casper talks about body image

Psychiatry Prof. Regina Casper spoke about self-es
teem and anorexia nervosa last night, emphasizing the
shifting of the ideal body image according to cultural
changes.
"Ideal body image is really culturally determined,"
she told an audience of approximately 35 people as part
of Body Image Awareness Week.
Many women, however, subscribe to the notion of an
ideal body as determined by today's fashion magazines.
"Body image is a concept, not a reality, in our minds
... a superficial sense of shape, size and form of our
bodies," said Casper.
People concentrate on their bodies when something
goes wrong. "If someone drops something on your big
toe, you know you have a big toe," Casper said. "Pain
forces you to focus. Disturbances of body image bring
(your body | into your awareness."
"Women who are unhappy . , . diet in order to gain
control over their lives, which they do not think they
have," said Casper. They compensate? for perceived
shortcomings through self-controlled eating.
While body size can be measured, body image can
not, she said, referring to the conclusions of a study of

women's body image perceptions.
The study asked healthy women to
estimate the sizes of various parts
of the body and then compared
their estimates with accurate mea

surements.
It determined that women accu
rately judged length of arms fi\nd
width of shoulders, but overesti
mated width of hips and width of
face by at least 50 percent. The
study also discerned that anorexic
women gave similar estimates to
healthy women.
"Women in Western cultures

overestimate their sizes. . . . They
appear to themselves much bigger
than they are in reality," said
Casper.
This overestimation results
from high levels of sensitivity,
she said. "Once you become sensi
tive about your body ... you
inflate it in your mind," said
Casper.
Anorexic women easily refrain
from eating because their tongues
retain only a sweet taste among
the four taste perceptions, which
include sweet, salty, bitter and
sour.
Anorexia nervosa originated
when a group of women attempted
to lead a spiritual life through
excess fasting, according to
Casper.
Because of social situations and
individual variations, she said, no
two cases of anorexia nervosa are
alike. The restrictive anorexic who
fasts is introverted, meticulous
and self-controlled. The bulimic
anorexic who overeats is gregari
ous, outgoing and adventurous,
Casper said.
Yet not everyone with the above
personality traits has an eating
disorder, she added. Nor does a
person who diets excessively neces
sarily have an eating disorder, she
said.
Anorexia affects not only
teenage women who diet, but peo
ple of all ages, genders and back
grounds, Casper concluded. Only
those who ignore impossible stan
dards of perfection are truly con
tent, she said.
