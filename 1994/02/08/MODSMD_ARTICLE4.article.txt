# Asian American Studies moves slowly
## Plans to expand program threatened by possible departure of prof 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
In danger of losing one of two key professors,
students and faculty working to expand Asian
American Studies say their continued efforts are
injeopardy.
Asst. Comparative Literature Prof. David
Palumbo-Liu, an untenured faculty member
brought to Stanford along with Assoc. History
Prof. Gordon Chang four years ago, said he is con
sidering leaving Stanford.
"I am discouraged by the University's not fol
lowing through on various commitments it made
to Asian American Studies and faculty, and have
responded to inquiries of interest from other in
stitutions," Palumbo-Liu wrote in a statement to
The Daily.
Palumbo-Liu and Chang have both expressed
disappointment at the lack of the support they

have received from the administration.
But Dean of Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven said he does value the professors. "Both
Palumbo-Liu and Chang are key to the Asian Amer
ican Studies area. If either of them should leave it
would seriously impair the program," he said.
"We have not thought about what we would do
if one of them left because we are not taking for
granted their departure," Shoven added.
If Palumbo-Liu does decide to leave Stanford,
the administration could either hire someone to
fill Palumbo-Liu's vacancy or decide to hire some
one with a different specialty, Anthropology Prof.
Harumi Befu said.
Palumbo-Liu said he will be giving lectures at
both Harvard and Columbia universities in
March because they have expressed interest in de
veloping their Asian American Studies programs.
Prof. Jeffrey Schnapp, chair of the compara
tive literature department, said Palumbo-Liu has

not yet received any definite offers. If he is offered
a position at another university, Sehnapp said the
department will do everything possible to con
vince him to stay at Stanford.
Although the first efforts among students and
faculty to create an Asian American Studies pro
gram began about 20 years ago, no program was
ever established.
Because Cornell University, UCLA, UC-
Berkeley and a number of other schools have suc
cessfully established programs, Stanford stu
dents and faculty say the University is lagging be
hind.
A group of students and faculty is currently
working to establish an Asian American Studies
major, said Befu, who has previously taught cours
es in Asian American Studies at Stanford.
