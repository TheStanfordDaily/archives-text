# Asian American Studies moves slowly
## Plans to expand program threatened by possible departure of prof 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
In danger of losing one of two key professors,
students and faculty working to expand Asian
American Studies say their continued efforts are
injeopardy.
Asst. Comparative Literature Prof. David
Palumbo-Liu, an untenured faculty member
brought to Stanford along with Assoc. History
Prof. Gordon Chang four years ago, said he is con
sidering leaving Stanford.
"I am discouraged by the University's not fol
lowing through on various commitments it made
to Asian American Studies and faculty, and have
responded to inquiries of interest from other in
stitutions," Palumbo-Liu wrote in a statement to
The Daily.
Palumbo-Liu and Chang have both expressed
disappointment at the lack of the support they

have received from the administration.
But Dean of Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven said he does value the professors. "Both
Palumbo-Liu and Chang are key to the Asian Amer
ican Studies area. If either of them should leave it
would seriously impair the program," he said.
"We have not thought about what we would do
if one of them left because we are not taking for
granted their departure," Shoven added.
If Palumbo-Liu does decide to leave Stanford,
the administration could either hire someone to
fill Palumbo-Liu's vacancy or decide to hire some
one with a different specialty, Anthropology Prof.
Harumi Befu said.
Palumbo-Liu said he will be giving lectures at
both Harvard and Columbia universities in
March because they have expressed interest in de
veloping their Asian American Studies programs.
Prof. Jeffrey Schnapp, chair of the compara
tive literature department, said Palumbo-Liu has

not yet received any definite offers. If he is offered
a position at another university, Sehnapp said the
department will do everything possible to con
vince him to stay at Stanford.
Although the first efforts among students and
faculty to create an Asian American Studies pro
gram began about 20 years ago, no program was
ever established.
Because Cornell University, UCLA, UC-
Berkeley and a number of other schools have suc
cessfully established programs, Stanford stu
dents and faculty say the University is lagging be
hind.
A group of students and faculty is currently
working to establish an Asian American Studies
major, said Befu, who has previously taught cours
es in Asian American Studies at Stanford.
A survey conducted last year in an Asian Amer-
ican history class revealed "a signifi
cant interest for establishing Asian
American Studies as a major," said
sophomore Janice Liu, a member of
the group.
Students are currently research
ing the history of the movement to
create a program and also the ratio
nale behind it. They hope to present
their results at an Asian American
symposium during the spring quar
ter, Liu said.
Liu also expressed disappointment
at Palumbo-Liu's possible departure
from Stanford. "I think it's a catch-22

situation," she said. "The administra
tion says the initiating force must
come from the facuJty, but there may
be no facuJty."
While Befu said administrators
have not been very supportive of the
movement, Shoven disagreed.
"The administration is very aware
of the large student interest in Asian
American Studies and we should
serve that interest," Shoven said. He
added that hiring Palumho-Liu and
Chang was "a major step in the right
direction."
"In general Stanford is very
responsive to student and faculty
interest in research and education,"
Shoven said.
Befu argued that monetary consid
erations are a primary reason for the

lack of support in this time of budget
cuts. "It's always the reason," he said.
"Asian American Studies is at the bot
tom of [administrators'! priorities."
Befu pointed out that a major
exists for African-American students,
who compose 9 percent of the fresh
men class. Asian American students
make up 24 percent of the freshmen
class, he said, but have no major.
The administration is examining
the possibility of having current pro
fessors teach courses in Asian Ameri
can Studies as well as perhaps estab
lishing a concentration within a con
ventional major, Befu said.
"According to the University
administration the only way to get an
Asian American Studies program
started is through faculty initiative,

not through student demand," Befu
said. "However, we may not have the
faculty to initiate the program.
"I would like to see more positive
support from the administration," he
added. "That's what Palumbo-Liu
and Chang are missing. 'ITiey aren't
seeing any sign that the administra
tion is willing to support the program
and so that's why they're discour
aged."
"Palumbo-liu is one of the fore
most experts in Asian American liter
ature," said Susan Chow, a visiting
professor from the University of
Pennsylvania who is teaching a
course in Asian American Studies this
quarter. "His departure I would | leave
a big gap in the program. It would be
a very serious loss."
