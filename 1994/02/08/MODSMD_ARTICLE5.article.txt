# Faculty raise questions on conflict policy
## 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
In a discussion of Stanford's proposed conflict-of
interest policy yesterday, faculty debated whether
software qualifies as scholarly work or licensed tech
nology — a distinction that determines whether the
University will be able to claim ownership.
The software question was one of the issues raised
in an open meeting to talk about a draft of the Uni
versity's Faculty Policy on Conflict of Commitment
and Interest, recently released by the Committee on
Research. The proposed policy will go before the Fac
ulty Senate for debate March 3.
About 13 faculty members attended the meeting
to hear the committee explain the policy and to voice
their concerns. Although no drastic changes were
proposed, many people said the policy's wording is
too vague in some places.
Elliot Leventhal, professor emeritus of mechani
cal engineering, pointed to the ownership of software
invented by faculty members as one of the areas that
the policy fails to cover.
As the draft stands, all newly created software —
except for written material that would have been dis
seminated in printed form before the advent of com
puters — will be owned by Stanford if the technology
was invented using any University resources or
money from grants. Under the proposed policy, all
technological discoveries made under these circum
stances will belong to Stanford.
But Leventhal said that the policy does not draw a
distinction between software which is unquestion
ably a technological invention — such as computer
programs used to power a machine — and works such
as interactive teaching programs, which could be con
sidered scholarly materials. Creations such as arti
cles, which arise in the course of daily academic work,
are traditionally not claimed by the University.
"If I write a program to teach senior citizens to deal
with Medicare, an interactive program . . . it's more
than just printed text. When you depart from that,
you have to make a distinction," Leventhal said.
But committee members countered that an inter
active program could be compared to a textbook,
something typically considered a scholarly work.
