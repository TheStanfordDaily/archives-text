# Faculty raise questions on conflict policy
## 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
In a discussion of Stanford's proposed conflict-of
interest policy yesterday, faculty debated whether
software qualifies as scholarly work or licensed tech
nology — a distinction that determines whether the
University will be able to claim ownership.
The software question was one of the issues raised
in an open meeting to talk about a draft of the Uni
versity's Faculty Policy on Conflict of Commitment
and Interest, recently released by the Committee on
Research. The proposed policy will go before the Fac
ulty Senate for debate March 3.
About 13 faculty members attended the meeting
to hear the committee explain the policy and to voice
their concerns. Although no drastic changes were
proposed, many people said the policy's wording is
too vague in some places.
Elliot Leventhal, professor emeritus of mechani
cal engineering, pointed to the ownership of software
invented by faculty members as one of the areas that
the policy fails to cover.
As the draft stands, all newly created software —
except for written material that would have been dis
seminated in printed form before the advent of com
puters — will be owned by Stanford if the technology
was invented using any University resources or
money from grants. Under the proposed policy, all
technological discoveries made under these circum
stances will belong to Stanford.
But Leventhal said that the policy does not draw a
distinction between software which is unquestion
ably a technological invention — such as computer
programs used to power a machine — and works such
as interactive teaching programs, which could be con
sidered scholarly materials. Creations such as arti
cles, which arise in the course of daily academic work,
are traditionally not claimed by the University.
"If I write a program to teach senior citizens to deal
with Medicare, an interactive program . . . it's more
than just printed text. When you depart from that,
you have to make a distinction," Leventhal said.
But committee members countered that an inter
active program could be compared to a textbook,
something typically considered a scholarly work.
For example, Chemistry Prof.
Steven Boxer, a committee mem
ber, said that questions assigned as
homework from the end of a text
book chapter are just as interactive
as a computer teaching program.
Biology Prof. Craig Heller, the
chair of the committee, said that
the draft is in keeping with the
existing software policy created
recently by the University's Com
mittee on Academic Computing
and Information Systems. Howev
er, he said the committee would
take a closer look at the issue in
revising its draft.
Faculty also had complaints
about the vagueness of the policy
on the question of disclosure.
Although the draft states that fac
ulty members must disclose any
inventions and outside consulting

arrangements to the University on
an annual basis, "it is not clear
what the limit of disclosure is,"
said Steven Gorelick, associate
professor of geological and envi
ronmental sciences.
Others, like Industrial Engi
neering Prof. Warren Hausman,
expressed concern over the vague
ness of rules regarding the employ
ment of students in outside faculty
businesses.
But Heller explained that the
vagueness is a natural result of the
committee's attempt to come up
with a set of more general guide
lines for faculty rather than a spe
cific set of policy considerations.
"Our intent is to set the tone ...
this should be viewed as a docu
ment that sets procedure, not one
that crosses all the T's and dots all
the I's," he said. "Hopefully, it will
be viewed with common sense."
However, Heller added that the
committee will be examining some
of the issues brought up during

yesterday's discussion. "I know
that we have to clear up some of
the issues with respect to intellec
tual property rights and software,"
he said after the meeting.
The committee began work on
the policy at the beginning of the
1992-93 academic year at the
request of University President
Gerhard Casper. Casper "suggest
ed that there were real indications
that (Stanford] might be scruti
nized from the outside," Heller
said. "He wanted to m<ike sure our
house was in order."
The draft policy reflects this
request, 1 Toller said, adding that
Casper's concern probably
stemmed from the negative publici
ty that Stanford received after the
indirect-cost scandal four years ago.
" This is a clear statement —
what are our guiding principles,"
Heller said. "We don't want to
have to be in a situation where we
have to regain our credibility |after
the fact]."
