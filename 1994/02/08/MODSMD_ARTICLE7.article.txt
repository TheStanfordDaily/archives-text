# Imagination comes alive in roleplaying
## 
### Bryan Sun 
It's Saturday night, and the
study rooms of Meyer Library
begin their weekly transforma
tions.
In one room, a 1920s detective
investigates an abandoned ware
house in the outskirts of Chica
go. In another room, six rabbits
warily circle an angry duck,
preparing to fight to the death
for the rights to the sunny side of
the marsh. In the last room,
Snow White searches for her
Prince Charming through dark
forests and abandoned castles.
Welcome to the world of role
playing, where a roundtrip ticket
for a two-week African safari
only costs a few sheets of paper, a
pencil, a bag of dice and a good
imagination. Based on social in
teraction and collective creativi
ty, roleplaying groups at Stan
ford travel to different worlds

and times, meeting monsters of
the medieval period and rewrit
ing the outcome of Star Trek
episodes.
"The real challenge of role
playing is to really play a role,"
said freshman Jocelyn Goldfein.
"I like to play characters that are
really unlike me. For example,
I'm playing a high priestess, but
I'm not a religious person. But
since I have to plav the character,
I have to really get into her head
and find out why she does what
she does."
Despite the wide range of the
matic material, the basic format
of a roleplaying game is very sim
ilar. In the typical session, the
players all sit around a table
while the Gamemaster sits
across from them, narrating the
story and weaving a picture of
the world that the characters
play in. The players confer
among one another and tell the
Gamemaster what their respec
tive characters decide to do, and
the Gamemaster tells the play
ers what happens.
Roleplayer and graduate stu
dent Pierre Uszynski explained
that roleplaying games contain
different levels, the "character"
level and the "player" level. If
the player roleplays seriously,
he will actually act out the
quirks and attributes of his
character, down to the charac
ter's speaking accent and facial
twitch. This immersion into a
role can make the game more
serious and intense, roleplayers

The concept of roleplaying
began with "Dungeons and
Dragons," a fantasy roleplaying
system that allows anyone to
become a hero by exploring the
dangers of monster-filled dun
geons. In the years since the
introduction of "Dungeons and
Dragons", roleplaying games
have greatly expanded their
horizons.
Today, roleplayers can play in
almost any setting that they

like, from a fantasy medieval
adventure to a futuristic space
exploration mission. Graduate
student David Chappell, for
instance, was inspired when he
picked up a copy of 1001 Arabi
an Nights from the library.
Today, he runs a roleplaying
game based on an Arabian
theme.
When Uszynski came to Stan
ford seven years ago as a gradu
ate student, he couldn't find a
roleplaying group. "We tried to
formalize roleplaying, so we
started advertising for a group
of people to join in roleplaying
games. We posted notices in The
Daily and bulletin board and
computer systems, and eventu
ally found enough players to
start a game. That's how the
mailing list got started," Uszyn
ski said.
Today Uszynski's mailing list
stands under the name of
"Sfrafnord Roleplayers," a group
of players around the Peninsula
and Bay Area that share role
playing game information via
computer bulletin boards.
Uszynski said the group's name
is a play on words, although he
would not disclose the secret to
the meaning of the word
"Stafnord."
Although Uszynski stressed

that the Stafnord Roleplayers
include people from all across
the Bay Area, there are several
active groups playing on the
Stanford campus itself. Scott
Compton, a lab assistant in the
Biology Department, hosts one
of the currently running games.
Compton, a 13-year veteran of
roleplaying, runs a weekly game,
called "The Vanquishers of
Taeratheus."
The overall interest in role
playing has remained steady
over the years, Uszynski said,
noting that his mailing list for
roleplaying has remained close
to approximately 80 members.
According to some roleplayers,
roleplaying has been associated
with religious or suicidal
groups, stereotyped as a group
of people who become addicted
to fantasy. Many roleplayers
stress that this image is unjusti
fied, especially in the 19905.
"It's just like everything in
that if you get too into it, it can
be harmful," Compton said.
"It's not the game, it's the per
son that hurts himself."
Roleplayers feel they have an
edge over other entertainment.
As sophomore Malachi Pound
says, "It's easy, it's fun, it's
cheap, it never gets old. . . what
more could you ask?"

story and weaving a picture of
the world that the characters
play in. The players confer
among one another and tell the
Gamemaster what their respec
tive characters decide to do, and
the Gamemaster tells the play
ers what happens.
Roleplayer and graduate stu
dent Pierre Uszynski explained
that roleplaying games contain
different levels, the "character"
level and the "player" level. If
the player roleplays seriously,
he will actually act out the
quirks and attributes of his
character, down to the charac
ter's speaking accent and facial
twitch. This immersion into a
role can make the game more
serious and intense, roleplayers

The concept of roleplaying
began with "Dungeons and
Dragons," a fantasy roleplaying
system that allows anyone to
become a hero by exploring the
dangers of monster-filled dun
geons. In the years since the
introduction of "Dungeons and
Dragons", roleplaying games
have greatly expanded their
horizons.
Today, roleplayers can play in
almost any setting that they

like, from a fantasy medieval
adventure to a futuristic space
exploration mission. Graduate
student David Chappell, for
instance, was inspired when he
picked up a copy of 1001 Arabi
an Nights from the library.
Today, he runs a roleplaying
game based on an Arabian
theme.
When Uszynski came to Stan
ford seven years ago as a gradu
ate student, he couldn't find a
roleplaying group. "We tried to
formalize roleplaying, so we
started advertising for a group
of people to join in roleplaying
games. We posted notices in The
Daily and bulletin board and
computer systems, and eventu
ally found enough players to
start a game. That's how the
mailing list got started," Uszyn
ski said.
Today Uszynski's mailing list
stands under the name of
"Sfrafnord Roleplayers," a group
of players around the Peninsula
and Bay Area that share role
playing game information via
computer bulletin boards.
Uszynski said the group's name
is a play on words, although he
would not disclose the secret to
the meaning of the word
"Stafnord."
Although Uszynski stressed

that the Stafnord Roleplayers
include people from all across
the Bay Area, there are several
active groups playing on the
Stanford campus itself. Scott
Compton, a lab assistant in the
Biology Department, hosts one
of the currently running games.
Compton, a 13-year veteran of
roleplaying, runs a weekly game,
called "The Vanquishers of
Taeratheus."
The overall interest in role
playing has remained steady
over the years, Uszynski said,
noting that his mailing list for
roleplaying has remained close
to approximately 80 members.
According to some roleplayers,
roleplaying has been associated
with religious or suicidal
groups, stereotyped as a group
of people who become addicted
to fantasy. Many roleplayers
stress that this image is unjusti
fied, especially in the 19905.
"It's just like everything in
that if you get too into it, it can
be harmful," Compton said.
"It's not the game, it's the per
son that hurts himself."
Roleplayers feel they have an
edge over other entertainment.
As sophomore Malachi Pound
says, "It's easy, it's fun, it's
cheap, it never gets old. . . what
more could you ask?"
