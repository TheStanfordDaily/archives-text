Peeping incident at Tresickier
Stanford Police are searching for a suspect in a
"peeping Tom" incident reported last Friday.
A Stanford junior was using the women's bath
room in Tresidder Union when she noticed a man
standing in the stall next to her. He was allegedly
holding a heart-shaped mirror in the air in an
apparent attempt to see over the wall, according
to Stanford Police.
When the victim banged on the stall wall the
peeper replied, "I'm sorry," and then left the
restroom, Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said.
The suspect was described as a white male in
his 20s with long blond hair. He was wearing
black pants, Converse tennis shoes and carrying a
black, purple and aqua bag, Niemeyer said.
Deputy discovers drugs, gun
A Stanford Police deputy thought that there
was something strange going on when he noticed

a van with blacked-out windows sitting on old
Page Mill Road by the quarry at 1:15 a.m. Sunday
morning.
When the deputy approached the 1979 Dodge,
he heard people talking and smelled marijuana,
according to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemey
er. After contacting the passengers, a male and a
female, the officer conducted a search of the vehi
cle.
The male, 21-year-old Andrew Corey of Palo
Alto, admitted to carrying a shotgun in the vehi
cle, Niemeyer said. The 12-gauge shotgun was
found loaded and hidden under a mattress in easy
reach from the driver's seat.
Corey was arrested and released for the misde
meanor of carrying a loaded weapon.
Sandrine Clark, a 25-year-old Mountain View
resident, was arrested for possession of concen
trated cannabis, or hashish. She was also carry
ing paraphernalia to smoke the drug, Niemeyer
said.
