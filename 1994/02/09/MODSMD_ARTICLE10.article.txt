NORFOLK, Va. (AP) - Adm. Frank
B. Kelso II was accused by a military
judge yesterday of witnessing sexual
misconduct in the 1991 Tailhook scan
dal and trying to cover it up.
The judge dismissed charges against
three aviators who contended their
cases were tainted by the Navy chiefs
actions.
The judge, Navy ('apt. William T.
Vest Jr., also accused the Navy's top
brass of not paying attention to
instances of sexual misconduct at earli
er Tailhook meetings.
Had they done so, Vest said, "a high
probability exists that both the assaults
and much of the Navy's embarrass
ment could have been avoided

The dismissals leave only one case
pending in the investigation of the
scandal that damaged the Top Gun
image of Navy and Marine Corps avia
tors. Of 140 cases, no one was ever
court-martialed and about 50 received
administrative discipline.
"That fact that bere it is over two
years later and nothing has occurred,
to me it's outrageous," said Karen
Johnson, national secretary for the
National Organization for Women and
a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel.
Pentagon investigators concluded
that 83 women were assaulted or
molested at the convention, many of
them on the third floor of the Las
Vegas Hilton, where men lined the

hallway on Saturday night, Sept. 7,
1991, and grabbed women as they tried
to pass.
Kelso, chief of naval operations,
"manipulated the initial investigative
process and the subsequent (discipline)
process in a manner designed to shield
his personal involvement in Tailhook
'91," Vest wrote in his decision.
The judge concluded that Kelso was
"in error" when he testified that he
didn't go to the third floor that Satur
day night and didn't see any miscon
duct.
"This court specifically finds Adm.
Kelso visited the third deck patio at
some time during the evening hours,"
Vest wrote.
