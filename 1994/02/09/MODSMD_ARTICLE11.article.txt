Storm sweeps nation
(AP) — Yet another blast of a winter
that has rewritten record books blew snow
and freezing rain from one end of the
nation to the other yesterday, sending
motorists into pileups and closing schools.
A day after the storm's rain caused
mudslides in shaken southern California,
winter storm warnings and advisories
were posted from coast to coast.
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
postponed his first State of the City speech
and declared a limited snow emergency.
The city got 2 to 3 inches of snow an hour
during the morning and the city sent out
1,200 plows and 350 salt spreaders.
New Jersey state employees were sent
home at midday and Newark Internation

al Airport closed as almost 9 inches of
snow had fallen by evening, a record for
the date. New York's Kennedy Airport
also closed for part of the day.
Brown to run for governor
BURBANK, Calif. (AP) - Kathleen
Brown, the daughter of one former Cali
fornia governor and the sister of another,
formally launched her bid to perpetuate
the family dynasty, announcing her guber
natorial campaign yesterday.
Brown, 48, the state's treasurer, stood
in an aerospace contractor's plant and
declared "enough is enough," contending
incumbent Gov. Pete Wilson has failed
and she is the only candidate with a plan
that can help the recession-battered state.
