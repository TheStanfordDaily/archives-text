## Editorial Deciphering the code Council should consider how Stanford presents Honor Code to students 
### 
ANY STANFORD student
who has taken an exam has
heard the fateful words,
"Good luck and be sure to sign the
bottom of the blue book."
However, as last winter's cheating
incidents and the proposal for the
upcoming review of the Honor Code
demonstrate, the meaning of the sig
nature has become obscured
through the years.
In October, Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Mary Edmonds
announced that — partly in response
to last year's cheating problems —
the Honor Code would undergo its
first re-examination since 1976.
The Student Conduct Legislative
Council, composed of faculty, elected
students, and Judicial Affairs Offi
cer Sally Cole, will begin to evaluate
the Code within the next few weeks.
And while the time is ripe for a
review of the Honor Code, the SCLC
should nonetheless act cautiously.
Last week, Cole said that the
SCLC will use surveys to find out
"whether the Honor Code as a policy
can continue to work." However, the
code itself is not the culprit of the lax
attitude regarding collaborative
work and other dishonorable exam
taking techniques.
Rather, it is the introduction and
implementation of the code that
require the most attention.
In its present form, the Honor
Code is one of the best examples of
how Stanford treats its students like
adults. Calling itself "an undertak
ing of students, individually and col
lectively" the code says that exams
shouldn't be proctored and that the
faculty should refrain from "taking
unusual and unreasonable precau
tions" to prevent cheating.
However, for many students —
especially freshmen taking their
first test — these guidelines may

still be unfamiliar.
Stanford undergraduates first
encounter the Honor Code on the
admissions application, where
prospective students are asked to
sign a statement which says that
they embrace "the spirit" of the code.
When new students arrive, they
are supplied with a full copy of the
text as part of the packet of informa
tion waiting in their room. Resident
assistants and fellows are encour
aged to discuss it with new students
during orientation or the first few
weeks of school.
After that, students are on their
own. And this may be where part of
the problem originates.
Steps should be taken to ensure
that students are fully cognizant of
the text of the code and the implica
tions when the code is breached.
Perhaps professors should be
encouraged to discuss the code in
class. There could also be a more
coordinated effort to broach the sub
ject during orientation.
The procedure of enforcing the
code also calls for scrutiny. Perhaps a
student judiciary board, which sev
eral other schools have, might be
more in tune to weighing the actions
of its peers.
And finally, what happens when a
student dishonors the code? Few are
aware of the process and outcome.
How could this lack of information
be expected to deter others from
cheating?
The SCLC has not yet met, but
when it does, its initial goal, accord
ing to Cole, will be to conduct a sur
vey to compile complaints and praise
for the current code. It should also
try to do more to engage students in
the debate — after all, the code
exists for their benefit.
Throughout its examination, it
should keep in mind that while the
entire Honor Code is in need of a sec
ond look, its presentation and imple
mentation are the areas that beg for
the most attention.
The current version of the code
has served Stanford well for 18
years; with a few modifications, it
can serve us for at least 18 more.
