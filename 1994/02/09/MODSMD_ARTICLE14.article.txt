## Smarts and sweatpants 
### 
LAST SUMMER, one Saturday
night, we were returning home
from bar-hopping when one more
than-slightly-tipsy male individual was
loudly complimenting the women in our
car.
"You are sooo pretty," he said to my
friend in the passenger seat. Then,
turning to me, he bellowed, "You are
sooo smart."
So, the moment — marked by a sort
of absurd pathos — was not the most
stellar in my social career. But what
was more disturbing to me was that his
off-handed comment, among others,
seemed to epitomize his belief that,
when it comes to women, "pretty" and
"smart" are mutually exclusive.
Ah, it's a familiar concept to us
Stanford students. We've heard it all
before. "Nine out of 10 women in Cali
fornia are beautiful. The other one goes
to Stanford." Playboy magazine ranks
Stanford men number five, Stanford
women 300-something. Suspiciously,
the Ivy League schools seem to have
been accused of similar imbalances in
male-female attractiveness levels.
Since debates on such a subjective
issue don't tend to get very far, let us
assume for the sake of argument that
Stanford women are, in fact, "unattrac
tive." Now, two questions arise.
First, why would it be such a coinci
dence that, year after year, the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions picked out
all the less-than-beautiful women just

by reading their applications? These
admissions officers must be doing
something wrong. Perhaps Dean of
Admissions Jim Montoya could get a
clue from model searches and beauty
pageants — mandatory disclosure of
height, weight, and measurements for
every female applicant, plus head and
full-length photos. That ought to reme
dy the problem real quick.
Second, what exactly is unattractive?
What did Playboy and the rest of the
those-whose-opinions-matter decide
was beautiful and ugly? I decided to do
a little research, asking men (and even
a woman) who honestly believe that
Stanford women were, on the whole,
not much to look at.
"Stanford women don't spend time
on their appearances." "They never
wear makeup." "They wear sweats all
the time." The complaints were plenti
ful. Furthermore, a surprising contin
gency seemed to support the belief of
my aforementioned inebriated friend —
intelligent women simply aren't attrac
tive. "You see," one particularly analyti
cal type said, "pretty girls can get by on
their looks. The ugly ones have to be,
like, smart and articulate to succeed.
That's why they get into Stanford."
"So why is it," I asked, "that men
who get into Stanford, and are clearly,
like, smart and articulate — as you
obviously are — aren't all ugly?"
"It's different for men," was the only
response. No explanation necessary.

End of discussion.
It's different for men. Unfortunately,
he was right. Study after study has
proven that physical appearance weighs
far more heavily (pun intended) into
the way women are judged and evaluat
ed.
There is something profoundly
wrong with this picture when Stanford
women are graduating to become
Rhodes scholars, Peace Corps volun
teers and U.S. Senators while Playboy
magazine and company are denouncing
them as "ugly." The prevalence of those
who buy into the myth is equally dis
turbing.
Take a look around you. So maybe
we don't all wear makeup, and maybe
we find sweats and sneakers are a bit
more comfy than miniskirts and stiletto
heels. But maybe, just maybe, there's a
bit more to the concept of female beau
ty and worth than what Playboy maga
zine deems important.
Because if being "pretty" involves
dusting off my makeup kit and throw
ing out my sweats, I think I'll settle for
being "like, smart and articulate,"
thank you very much.

Angie is currently researching whether
the "nine out of 10" rule applies to
Oxford, too.
