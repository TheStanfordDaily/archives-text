## Graduation speaker Carter's views are not right-wing 
### 
WHEN I FIRST read that
Stephen Carter would be Stan
ford's commencement speaker,
it knocked the wind out of me. Snip
pets from Carter's "Reflections of an
Affirmative Action Baby" indicated
that the book would offer more of the
mindless pontificating constantly ema
nating from the right wing. However,
after digesting the full text, I would no
longer characterize it as right-wing.
Nor is it left-wing. It is mainstream to
a fault.
The fault lies in labeling as "dis
sent" ideas that are actually at the
heart of most affirmative action pro
grams and much of African-American
thought. To understand this sleight of
hand, consider what appear to be
Carter's fundamental points. First, he
advises that a college "take a good
hard look at the applicant pool to be
sure that it is not missing highly moti
vated students — some of them people
of color, some of them not — who
might not be sure things but who show
good promise of being positioned to
take advantage of what the school can
offer." He sets this up in stark con-

trast to programs designed to "fill a
quota" through the "circumventing or
eradicating of standards." He also
advocates what he calls an affirmative
action pyramid in which "the role of
preference narrows as one moves
upward" from undergraduate to grad
uate education and the professional
world.
The dangerous implication is that
these statements differ from current
affirmative action policies. These
statements are strange coming from a
Stanford alumnus. Every involvement
I've had with Stanford recruiting and
every conversation with graduate
admissions committee members has
indicated that what he advocates is
what is already in place. I know of no
one who advocates the complete aban
donment of standards against which
Carter inveighs throughout "Reflec
tions."
Beyond dangerous implications,
consider the absolute irresponsibility
when Carter, a Yale Law professor
involved with admissions, opens his
book with the statement "I got into
law school because I was black." It is

one of the few things he states boldly
(and repeatedly) without qualification.
Were there ever a statement in need of
qualification, this would be it — else it
is a slap in the face to every black
applicant denied admission to Yale
Law School.
Such irresponsibility plays directly
into the hands of those members of the
right wing who paint the mainstream
to be further left than it is. The folly
of such attempts was nowhere more
apparent than when George Bush
declared victory after signing a "modi
fied" 1990 Civil Rights Act which was
virtually identical to what he originally
labeled a quota bill. It never was a
quota bill. We see similar anti-quota
cries almost weekly in The Stanford
Review despite the dearth of evidence
that quotas are in effect anywhere at
Stanford. I view the lack of response to
such unfounded cries as the true fail
ing of the affirmative action move
ment. We need the Dean Jeans of the
world to write books about what affir
mative action is and is not.
To round out his vision, Carter
advises those given an opportunity not

to waste it. Instead, they must "bend
to their work with an energy that will
leave competitors and detractors alike
gasping in admiration." Such state
ments are naive, condescending and
hackneyed. They're the "good old-fash
ioned hard work" answer to how one
should overcome institutionalized bar
riers — the implication being that
hard work is lacking in those who have
not yet overcome.
Still, there are redeeming qualities
in Carter's book. He gives a well
informed, and at times entertaining,
discussion of what happens to dis
senters from the mainstream of black
thought. It's the story of people trying
to strip him of his birthright: denying
him his blackness because of his writ
ings. Juxtaposing these stories with
stale statements on affirmative action
provides Carter's smoke and mirrors.
He ends the book on a note of solidari
ty with the rest of African-American
intellectuals. If only he knew how
much in solidarity he already is.
