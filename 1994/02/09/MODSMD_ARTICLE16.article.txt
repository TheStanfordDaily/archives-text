# Professor's letter doesn't reflect well on Stanford
## 
### 
"Just once, I'd like to see a black, born
again Christian, lesbian, Navajo poet
depicted as a butcher of innocent people."
"White Plaza is more often filled with
wiffenpoof, lava-lamp, ratchet-jawed pur
veyors of simpish socialism-sold-by-the
drink than is Red Square."
"Is she a lesbian ? She doesn't know. Is
she a woman ?We don't know."
Are these the statements of "decent,
well-raised and intelligent" Stanford stu
dents, as Prof. Emeritus Robert Greer
Cohn implies in his Feb. 7 letter ("Winds
of Freedom members are not extreme

rightists")? Are these blatantly ignorant
quotes that appeared in recent issues of
The Stanford Review expressions of the
"wonderful cultural heritage" Prof. Cohn
claims to uphold and protect? Is this what
Stanford "should have more of?
I think it's a pathetic commentary on
Stanford University when a member of its
own tenured faculty steps forward in sup
port of such nonsense.
Isn't it an "outrageous assault on the
truth," Prof. Cohn, for you to characterize
the proponents of multiculturalism on this
campus (oh, I meant "Soviet Russia") as
"traitors"? I suppose not, considering that
the history of colonialism and racial
oppression seems to have no place in how
you would define "objective truth." So,
you and The Review think you have "some

idea of what is true and good"? Hmmm.
Perhaps it is this kind of antiquated
thinking, rooted in ignorance and para
noia, that is really to blame for Stanford's
allegedly "badly tarnished reputation." Of
course your views could never be charac
terized as fanatical, or be even remotely
linked to the "mendacity and bad faith"
that were recently blown onto this cam
pus.
As for the members of The Review, you
say you are "with them to some extent."
Yet they have failed to achieve their stat
ed objective to serve as a springboard for
intelligent debate on campus issues.
Instead, they revert to sensationalist and
blatantly racist tactics, which only pro
mote hatred and backward thinking at
this supposedly world-class institution.

In the future, I hope I am still around
to drink a toast with those valiant "black,
born-again Christian, lesbian, Navajo
poets." Cheers!
