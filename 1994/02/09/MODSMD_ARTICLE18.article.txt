## Research may prove black holes' existence May also help in determining mass, rotation rate 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Oscillations in the disks of hot gas
thought to surround black holes may
allow scientists to prove the existence of
these elusive objects.
In addition, theoretical research into
this phenomenon, carried out by Physics
Prof. Robert Wagoner and former doc
toral student Christopher Perez, could
provide new insight into the masses and
rotation rates of black holes.
Because the study is new, no con
crete observations of the oscillations
have been made yet, but according to
Wagoner, his research — dubbed
"diskoseismology" — should allow sci
entists to determine whether so-called
"black hole candidates" are indeed
black holes.
"We believe we have found a unique
signature for black holes," he said,
adding that examples might be found by
observing the day-to-day fluctuations in
the brightnesses of distant bodies with
a relatively small telescope.
In addition, two satellites to be
launched in the near future, the X-Ray
Timing Explorer and ARGOS, will
increase scientists' chances of predict
ing oscillations.
Wagoner's research began with the
simple observation that disks of gas
called "accretion disks" are often found
orbiting points in space from which X
rays are emanating — one sign of a
black hole's presence.
The disks are made up of matter
trapped from other celestial bodies by

the intense gravitational field of black
holes — which are so dense that even
cannot escape their surfaces.
The temperature within the accre
tion disk is very high because of friction
among the gas particles swept into a cir
cular path by the black hole.
As a result, it gives off energy in the
form of light which can be observed
from Karth, Wagoner said. In addition,
disturbances to the disks cause the
oscillations predicted under his model.
Under standard Newtonian mechan
ics, which could be employed if the gas
were orbiting an ordinary star, disturb
ing the disk would generate fairly simple
oscillations. However, because the black
holes' masses are so large — in some
cases 100 million times the mass of the
sun — general relativity must be applied
to the study of such an oscillation.
Under general relativity, when an
object draws near to another massive
object, the equations which determine
its physical properties change slightly.
Hut when the massive object is
extremely dense, these alterations
become very important. In the case of a
black hole, they are crucial in determin
ing orbital dynamics — creating the oscil
lations that Wagoner's research predicts.
"The oscillations will allow us to
probe the gravitational field of the black
hole," Wagoner said. "They do not exist
in Newtonian physics."
Though the origins of the predicted
oscillations are physically complex,
Wagoner said they should come in two
varieties: horizontal "pressure modes"
and vertical "gravity modes," each of

which would generate a unique frequen
cy of oscillation.
According to Wagoner, the period of
time over which the disks oscillate
ranging from milliseconds to days
mostly depends upon the mass of the
black hole.
Despite the seeming ease in observ
ing such a phenomenon, problems have
arisen in calculating the magnitude of
the oscillations.
Because the accretion disk is subject

ed to violent gravitational forces by the
black hole, its internal motion is likely
to be very turbulent — meaning that
particles are often moving randomly,
forming vast eddies and swirls.
In analyzing the effects of such tur
bulence, Wagoner found that it can act
both to amplify and dampen the pre
dicted oscillations.
As a result, he said, their amplitude
is probably only 1 percent of the total
energy output of the disk, making the

oscillations difficult to discern from the
relatively smooth energy flow which
otherwise emanates from the disk.
Even so, Wagoner believes a study of
accretion disks' energy outputs will pro
vide important clues about the black
holes hidden at their centers.
"What we're doing will inevitably
advance our understanding of the power
coming from these objects," he said. "Up
until now we have known relatively lit
tle about the physics of accretion disks."
