# Ernst looks forward to teaching, research
## Earth Sciences Dean will step down in September

Gary Ernst's passion for rocks has taken
him around the world, from central China to
southern Kazakhstan to the western Alps.
But the geochemist will also bo finding
adventure in campus laboratories and class
rooms when he steps down as dean of the
School of Earth Sciences in September.
"You renew yourself by doing teaching and
research," said Ernst, whose interests center
around studying rocks in the Earth's crust
that have recrystallized under pressure and
worked their way back up to the surface.
Despite his background in geology, Ernst
speaks enthusiastically about his school's
growing emphasis on the Earth's above
ground problems such as global warming, pol
lution and loss of biodiversity.
"If you tinker around with one part of (the
Earth], you are going to make changes —
unanticipated changes," he said. "Who should
be studying this but the Earth scientists?"
The increased emphasis on environmental
issues has helped revitalize the school, which
was suffering from a decline in popularity
when Ernst took over five years ago.
The number of undergraduate majors in
Stanford's smallest school — which includes
three departments: geophysics, geological and
environmental studies, and petroleum engi
neering — has quadrupled under Ernst's
reign, rising from just 20 to about 80 today.
With 62 majors, the new Earth Systems
program is responsible for much of that
increase. Its attractiveness, Ernst says, stems
from its incorporation of fields such as eco
nomics and law with a more traditional
emphasis on science.
"It's popular because it's so diversified," he
said. "It truly cuts across school boundaries."
Next year, Ernst says he plans to teach the
beginning geology class, a course in physical
chemistry of rocks and minerals and Introduc
tion to Earth Systems.
He'll also be back in the laboratory synthe
sizing minerals and rocks, trying to duplicate
temperatures and pressures deep in the
Earth. By studying rocks at the roots of moun
tain belts, Ernst hopes to learn more about
the Earth's history and how conditions have
changed with time.
Using remote sensing — satellite images of

the ground — he studies false-color spectra.
"Sometimes the remote sensing images allow
you to distinguish things you could never see
with the naked eye," he said.
While Ernst may be at home in the labora
tory, he also enjoys the mapping he does bv
spending weeks camping out and exploring
mountain ranges both in California and inter
nationally.
"Just to be able to sit and eat your lunch on
a little outcrop, and watch the birds and squir
rels — I love that," he said. "That's one of the
great things about Earth science."
Although he believes it's time for him to
step aside as dean, Ernst worries about the
problems he will pass on to his successor.
After slicing about $800,000 from the school's
operating budget over the past three years, he
said Earth Sciences has very little in the way
of discretionary funds.
"We threw all the seats out of the airplane

to keep flying," he added.
Part of the solution, Ernst says, can be
found in partnerships with industry. The
school currently has a $1 million deal with
Chevron and a partnership with the United
States Geological Survey for conducting fun
damental research.
In a time of belt tightening, he has been
trying to expand Earth Sciences. "It's like a
salmon swimming up a waterfall," he said. "It
takes a great expense of energy."
As the Commission on Undergraduate
Education reevaluates Stanford's distribution
requirements, Ernst emphasized the impor
tance of requiring students to at least get their
feet wet in an introductory class.
Today's students "will be voters going to
the voting booth and deciding on our future,"
he said. "They have to know how Earth sys-
