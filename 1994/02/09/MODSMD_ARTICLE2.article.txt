## Student Affairs hiring freeze lifted for Larimore replacement 
### Romesh Ratnesar Editorial staff 
The freeze on the replacement search
for Asst. Dean of Students Jim Larimore
has been lilted, Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds said last night.
The position may be filled as early as
mid-April, according to Larimore.
The decision addresses criticism by
student leaders that the administra
tion's inaction represented a waning
commitment to the campus' students of
color and ethnic centers.
Larimore, who also serves as director
of the American Indian Program Office,
announced his resignation in November
after nine years at Stanford. Edmonds
later halted any new hirings for vacant
permanent positions, citing an uncertain

financial outlook due to impending bud
get cuts.
However, Edmonds said she decided
to re-evaluate the freeze on a "case by
case basis" and has subsequently ap
proved the continuation of the Larimore
search.
"1 think it has become clear over the
last couple months that this is an impor
tant position to fill," Larimore said. "It
was a matter of the budget process wind
ing on." Larimore said be previously met
with Edmonds, Dean of Students
Michael Jackson and Provost Condoleez
za Rice and presented a "report that de
tailed the development of our program"
and its competitiveness with similar pro
grams at other schools.
Hut Edmonds stressed that the re
sumption of the search was ultimately

her choice. "I put the freeze on, I took it
off," she said. "It was clearly my deci
sion." She declined to discuss the rever
sal in detail and whether the decision re
flects a more benign budget picture.
"It's not a question of how deep the
cuts are," she said. "It's a matter of how
I decided to prioritize things."
She said that while the freeze on fill
ing other positions technically remains,
some of them may also be reconsidered,
depending on what is recommended to
her by administrative managers.
Larimoresaid he plans to begin adver
tising the opening by tomorrow and
hopes to convene a search committee
within the next week. "If we take an ag
gressive stance (on searching!, we will be
in position to have finalists by mid-
April, with an announcement
around May 1 or so," Larimore said.
Edmonds denied that the
search for Larimore's spot had
ever been abandoned. "Unlike
the rumors going around, the
position was never going to be
eliminated," she said. "Students
took [the freeze] the wrong way."

She called the moratorium a
"management tool."
"That's interesting to hear,"
Larimore said. "There was a
time, as Student Affairs was look
ing at what it could put on the
table, there was open speculation
that they might not fill this posi
tion, that this was one possible
area of savings."
Larimore announced his resig
nation in the wake of the disclo
sure that the University would
undergo the current round of
budget cuts. The subsequent

freeze became a rallying point for
the campus' ethnic centers, who
contended that the search halt
reflected a lack of administrative
concern for multicultural issues.
Indeed, Larimore praised
"concern from students" and
"very heartwarming level of sup
port from alumni" for assisting
the effort to lift the freeze.
Larimore said he intends to
leave his post "no later than Aug.
1," but will likely abdicate it if a
permanent replacement has been
selected before then.
