### Romesh Ratnesar Editorial staff 
The freeze on the replacement search
for Asst. Dean of Students Jim Larimore
has been lilted, Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds said last night.
The position may be filled as early as
mid-April, according to Larimore.
The decision addresses criticism by
student leaders that the administra

commitment to the campus' students of
color and ethnic centers.
Larimore, who also serves as director
of the American Indian Program Office,

"It's not a question of how deep the

some of them may also be reconsidered,
depending on what is recommended to
her by administrative managers.
Larimoresaid he plans to begin adver

hopes to convene a search committee
within the next week. "If we take an ag
