# Discovery may help in fight against cancer
## Untranslated DNA segments found to suppress tumor growth in mice 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Research is showing that DNA
strands previously thought to do
nothing may help suppress
tumors.
And according to Helen Blau, a
professor of molecular pharmacol
ogy at the Medical Center who
made the discovery, the finding
may mark a new step toward
understanding ways to fight can
cer.
These strands — which do not
appear to encode or translate into
a protein — were found to sup
press tumors in all but seven of 56
mice, even after they were subject-

Ed to a drug which would ordinar
ily cause cancer.
"It's very interesting in terms
of basic mechanisms that I a
strand | that doesn't encode a pro
tein could control growth," Blau
said, adding that researchers usu
ally ignore this part of the genetic
code and concentrate instead on
strands which do encode proteins.
"Sometimes they're so ignored
that they aren't even in the
databases," she said.
Hut in performing their experi
ments on this "junk DNA," Blau
and her colleagues used a particu
lar gene, known to contain
untranslated regions at its tail
end.

"We wanted to discover new
types of growth regulators and so
we worked with mutant cells,"
Blau said. The strands of' UNA
were then transcribed into those
cells in order to attempt to make
the mutant cells behave normally.
According to Blau, similar
untranslated regions can be found
in a wide variety of DNA speci
mens. "It's found in many organ
isms," she said. "There are
regions that appear to be highly
conserved in an evolutionary
sense."
Even so, questions remained
about why the addition of a singU
DNA strand would stop the tumor
growth entirely — a problem that

is thought to be related to a num
ber of different genes.
Hut Blau said this might be
simply another clue leading to the
fact that the untranslated strands
are the keys to stopping the can
cer.
Despite questions remaining
about this new field of study, she
said such untranslated regions are
likely to produce new discoveries
in the future.
"Sometimes these . . . regions
are even larger than the coding
regions," she said. "Our observa
tions really suggest that what
we've found in our experiments is
more than just a chance phe
nomenon."
