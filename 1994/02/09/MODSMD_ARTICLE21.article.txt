Q: W/iv can I see through
glass?
— Four-Eyed in Faisan
A: Basically, Four-Eyed,
the reason that you can
see through glass is that
there's no reason not to be able
to.
See (no pun intended), when
a light beam interacts with a
chunk of non-transparent mat
ter, the quantum-mechanical
entities (called photons) that
make up the beam can meet
one of several fates, any one of
which can prevent the photons
from being transmitted
through the chunk. With a
transparent substance like
glass, none of these processes
occur, and the photons make it
through.
Light, as Maxwell taught us,
is an electromagnetic phe
nomenon. When a beam of light
hits something, the photons
interact with the electrons
orbiting the atoms and
molecules of the substance.
In some materials, the spac
ing between electronic energy
levels is the same as the energy
of particular photons. These
materials can absorb light of
the colors corresponding to
those energies. If a particular
color is absorbed, the material
will appear to "be" the comple
mentary color. For instance,
leaves look green to us because
they do such a swell job of
absorbing green's complemen
tary color, red.
The energy-level spacings of
the silicon oxides in glass, how
ever, don't match the energies
of visible photons — so rather
than being absorbed, these
photons simply pass through
the glass.
(Photons of longer or short
er wavelength than visible light
— infrared or ultraviolet,
respectively — are absorbed by
the molecules in glass. One
consequence of the absorption
of LFV light is that it's much
more difficult to get a tan
through a window than it is
when you brave the elements
and put nothing but a rapidly

thinning ozone layer between
your skin and the sun. )
Some atoms and molecules
have "loose" (high-energy)
electrons, which can more or
less grab a photon as it comes
in and spit it out again, a pro
cess known as reflection. The
atoms of metallic elements gen
erally possess such high-lying
electrons, which is why pol
ished silver makes such a
handy mirror.
Again, the molecules that
compose glass have no such
loose electrons, so reflection
doesn't occur in the same way
as it does for metals. There's
nothing kicking the photons
back out, so they just plow on
through the glass.
I know what you're thinking
at this point: "Ah, but glass
does reflect light, as every
damned fool who's fixed his
hair in a car window knows."
Well, kind reader, this
damned fool knows that too,
but the important thing to
remember is that glass only
reflects light at its external
boundaries (e.g. the border
where the air stops and the
glass begins). If it did reflect
internally, a good deal of the
light entering a piece of glass
would indeed fail to make it out
the other side.
The lack of internal bound
aries and discontinuities in
glass permits refraction — the
bending of a light beam at
interfaces between two sub
stances — to be precisely con
trolled at glass-air boundaries.
This precision makes possible
such miracles of technology as
cameras, microscopes and con
tact lenses, just to name a few.
Another type of interaction
between light and matter is
scattering, which, simplistical
ly considered, is the process of
photons crashing into mol
ecules and careening off in ran
dom directions. This does hap
pen in glass to some extent, but
not enough that your average
mere human observer would
notice. See, glass — like the
similarly transparent air and
water — is a fluid and therefore
has similar scattering proper
ties.
