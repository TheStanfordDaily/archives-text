## Blocker-turned-hitter Burghardt shines in new role Consistency, fewer errors are primary goals of two-time NCAA kill leader 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
After being cut twice from his high school
volleyball team it took a little arm twisting
and a little pleading from his basketball
coach to land Joe Burghardt a spot on the
volleyball bench.
After paying his dues on the pine,
Burghardt assumed the starting middle
blocker position his junior year. En route to
garnering second team Ail-American honors,
the eventual Loyola High School valedictori
an metaphorphosed into one of the hottest
collegiate prospects in the nation.
By his senior year, the Los Angeles
native knew he had to choose from Stan
ford, Stanford or Stanford, and the fans on
the Farm have not been disappointed with
his choice.
After playing a reserve position his rookie
year, Burghardt stepped up to the big
leagues as a sophomore, promptly finishing
the season with a .505 hitting percentage —
No. 1 in the nation. Last year wasn't much
different, as Burghardt compiled a .560 per
centage — No. 1 in the nation, once again.
Despite those numbers, Burghardt was
asked to make a transition from the middle
blocking position to the swing hitter's role in
order to fill the holes created by the depar
ture of six seniors from last year's team.
"We're always looking to make better use
of our talent and personnel," said head coach
Ruben Nieves. "Moving Joe to the swing hit
ter position was an attempt to do that."
Burghardt has responded with solid per
formances at his new position; however, the
team captain is still striving to reach the
consistency that characterized his earlier
career.
"Sometimes I kind of feel like I'm a fresh
man again," said Burghardt, a senior. "I
make a lot of errors, and I probably account
for more mistakes than anyone on the
team."
That's understandable, considering the

spiker is now being called on to dig out the
serves and pass them to the setters instead
of taking the set and pounding it over the
net.
As Burghardt quickly discovered, trying
to receive a float serve is akin to trying to hit
a knuckleball in baseball. The only differ
ence is that Burghardt needs to nail the pass
everytime.
"The past few years Canyon (Ceman) has
had some of the best passers in the country
delivering the ball to him," Burghardt said.
"Now I'll make a bad pass, and he'll have to
run all over the place for the set."
That lament has to be taken with a grain
of salt, though, considering Burghardt is try
ing to fill the enormous shoes of both Dun
can Blackman and Ryan Moos — two former
Cardinal swing hitters who are now repre
senting the Stars and Stripes on the Olympic
team.
"It's been tough on him," Nieves said.
"Joe as a middle blocker is outstanding. He's
just been a top hitter — consistent from
match to match. He's lost some of that when
we asked him to switch positions.
"If Joe plays in the middle blocking posi
tion he's an All-American candidate this
year, but when we moved him to the outside
I'm not sure he's an All-American swing hit
ter. The point is that we need help in that
position, and Joe is the type of player who
would sacrifice that for the team."
If a position switch wasn't hard enough,
Burghardt is also battling a chronic bad
back.
Darryl Strawberry could not overcome
the pain of one herniated disc to swing a bat
for the Dodgers, but Burghardt has pound
ed, blocked and passed for the Cardinal in
every game and every practice this season,
despite three herniated discs in his lower
back.
"The guy has a lot of heart to play with a
painful injury like that," Nieves said.
Burghardt incurred his present injury
during his sophomore year in the Mountain

Pacific Sports Federation playoff.
"Burghardt was playing the best match of
his life when he went out with back pains in
the third game against UCLA," Nieves
recalled. "He also played a little in the NCAA
Final Four that year, but he was nowhere
near full strength."
Last year, after intense rehabilitation,
Burghardt was again down on his luck, as he
suffered a broken ankle in the MPSF play
offs.
"I don't want Joe to feel responsible for us
not going to the NCAA Finals last year or
I not | winning it the year before," Neives
said. "But I feel that if Joe had been at full
strength at the end of the last two seasons,
we would have won one, if not two titles. I
really feel that."
This season, Burghardt will have one last
shot at NCAA glory. The supporting cast is
different, with four new starters, and
Burghardt begins every game in unfamiliar
territory. However, the captain is confident
that the Cardinal squad will make his senior
year the most memorable in his collegiate
career.
"I think we have a better chance than last
year," he said. "When we play well we have
been extremely good, but we have to play
more consistently, starting with myself."
That attitude has made Burghardt an
indispensible player in the Cardinal lineup,
according to Nieves.
"Deep down Joe knows that he has accom
plished a lot," Nieves said. "But on the sur
face, Joe might be unsatisfied because he is
such a perfectionist. He demands so much
from himself. That's part of the reason why
he is so good.
"I have ultimate admiration and respect
for Joe. The way he represents Stanford, the
way he treats people and the way he goes
about his business is very classy. That's the
way it should be done."
Thank goodness his high school basket
ball coach realized that about Burghardt as
well.
