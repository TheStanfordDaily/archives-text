# Proposition 120: a good move for basketball?
## 
### 
Although everyone in the college basketball world
is talking about the revolving door of No. 1
teams or the Black Coaches Association's pro
posed boycott, another important issue looms on the
horizon. At the NCAA winter conference in January, a
new decision regarding eligibility surfaced and may
have a greater impact on college athletics than worry
ing about who's on top or the simple loss of one schol
arship.
This decision, labeled Proposition 120, allows for
college underclassmen to declare for the National
Basketball Association Draft and not lose their eligi
bility. In years past, a player ended his college career
as soon as he sent a letter to the NCAA officially
declaring his entrance in the draft. His college play
ing days came to an end, no questions asked.
Now, under the new rules, a player can declare for
the draft and then has 30 days afler the draft to
decide whether to sign with the pro team that picked
him or to return to college. However, early returns
suggest this proposition may open up more problems
than it solves.
With the new rule, the NBA team holds the rights
to a player for as long as he is in college plus one year.
The only way a player can get out of his obligation to
the team which selected him would be to sit out a full
year after he has left college, much like Ohio State
junior Jim Jackson tried to do last year before signing
with the Dallas Mavericks.
If Proposition 120 had been in place last year,
Jackson almost certainly would have returned for his

senior year rather than play with the lowly Mavs.
Still "property" of Dallas, he could have demanded a
trade or upped his salary demands in accordance to
now well he played during his senior year, if all that
failed, he could sit out a year and wait for the next
draft like he tried to do originally, but this time with
a college degree under his belt.
While this new rule seems to give "on the bubble"

players some pro
tection for not
getting picked,
there seem to be
several unre
solved issues
about how it will
affect top players.
Fir s t ,
underclassmen
can't sign with
agents to negoti-

ate contracts and keep their eligibility. Ail-American
sophomore Joe Slamdunk will be negotiating against
top NBA salary geniuses with mom and pop in his
corner If'he's lucky, he'll be an econ major and know
a little about contracts. If not, he could get screwed
over bv shady general managers tired of making
guaranteed multi-millionaires out of 20-year old kids.
Second, what's to keep clubs like Seattle or New
York, who have championship-caliber teams and
deep benches, from investing a late first-round pick
on a freshman like Jerrv Stackhouse from North

Carolina or Joe Smith from Maryland? Both players
will probably stay at least through their junior years,
but when they do come out, they are potential lottery
picks. Great teams will get better a little down the
road, while teams like the Kings or the Timber
wolves, perennial lottery-dwellers in need of immedi
ate help, will have to pick juniors or seniors they
know they can sign to play the next year.
Most NBA general managers feel this new rule
gives players more leverage, or as Atlanta Hawks
director of scouting Gary Wortman said, it protects
"kids from getting hung out to dry." However, college
coaches'jobs become much harder, as they now must
try to convince a player to stay in college when the
player knows exactly what team he will play for and
how much money he can expect to make. No more "I
wonder if I'll get picked." Now it becomes "I wonder
if I'll get picked by a good team."
Allowing college basketball players some sort of
"free agency" may lie somewhere down the road, hut
right now it looks like this new proposition is in
vogue. Unfortunately, it will most likely deplete the
college ranks of superstars, as they jump to the NBA
after their freshman or sophomore years. With NBA
salaries skyrocketing, I can't blame college under
classmen for taking the money and running.

As for Michael Jordan's new baseball career, if he
thinks facing the New York Knicks in a seven-game
series is scary, Greg has two words for him . . . Handy
and Johnson.
