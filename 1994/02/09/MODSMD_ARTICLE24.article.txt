## No. 2 men's netters triumph over Spartans 7-0 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Looking to solidify its lineup for NCAA
Indoors, the No. 2-ranked Stanford men's
tennis team looked impressive on its way to
a rout of Brandon Coupe and the rest of vis
iting San Jose State yesterday bv a score of
7-0. Stanford upped its overall record to 4-
0.
"It was a good win for us," said Stanford
head coach Dick Gould. "It's a good way to
start out these few matches leading up to
Indoors."
In the first of three dual matches this
week, the Cardinal was sharp in its treat
ment of the Spartans, whose record fell to
2-1 after yesterday's loss. Threatening
skies gave way to sunshine as the teams
began their doubles matches, and although
Stanford won all three doubles contests,
there was some difficulty along the way.
"I thought that, with the exception of
Vimal (Patel), we didn't play well in dou
bles," Gould said.
Seniors Michael Flanagan and Chris
Cocotos, though losing a service break
twice, beat the opposing team of Coupe-
Derek Del Rosario 8-6 at first doubles.
Likewise, at No. 2 doubles, Patel and
partner Jeff Salzenstein lost a break after
jumping out to a 7-1 lead. The pair eventu
ally won 8-3 over Spartans Ryan Marasigan
and Micholas lonesco.
No. 3 doubles featured a duo that had
never played together before. Stanford
freshman Grant Elliott and sophomore
Ricky Becker won 8-6 despite team inexpe
rience and twice getting broken.

But while the doubles matches may have
been a little "ragged," according to Gould,
singles showed the talent and depth the
Cardinal possessed.
At the top of the lineup, the All-Ameri
can Flanagan dominated one of the best
players in the nation in his win over the
Spartan's Coupe 6-4, 6-0. In his first loss to
a Stanford player in his four-year collegiate
career, Coupe left most of his game in San
Jose. But Flanagan didn't let him play well,
said Gould.
"Mike really kept the pressure on him,"
Gould said. "He didn't waste a lot of shots."
At second singles, Robert Devens faced
the most challenging match of the day
against Alan Alvistur. Without losing a
serve the entire match, Devens was never
able to put Alvistur away, finally winning 6-
4, 7-6 (8).
"In the end. Hobby made the shot he had
to," Gould said. "It wasn't always pretty,
but he got it done."
Salzenstein came from a less-than
tremendous showing in doubles to win his
singles match against Del Rosario in
impressive fashion 6-3, 6-2.
The bottom three singles matches were
even more electric. In a seeming three-way
race to get off the court first, the Nos. 4, 5
and 6 Stanford singles made short work of
their opponents. Cocotos at fourth singles
dispatched Marasigan, 6-0, 6-2; Patel
downed lonesco 6-1, 6-4 at No. 5, and sixth
singles saw a rejuvenated Jim Thomas com
pletely dominate his opponent Aaron
Downey, 6-0, 6-1.

With ultimate concentration, Robert Devens slams one down in the
men's victory over San Jose yesterday.
"Our performance today says
a lot for our depth overall, even
down to our seventh and eighth
guys," Gould said. "This win over
a much improved team is a credit
to us."
Friday may give Stanford
more chance to exhibit its depth
as it takes on UNLV. Although
Coach Could said he does not
know what to expect from the
Rebels, the match will give play
ers much needed match experi
ence heading into NCAA Indoors,
Feb. 24-27 in Louisville, Ken.
The match against UNLV starts
a 1 p.m.
According to Gould, the
toughest match of the three will
be against Pepperdine on Satur
day at noon.
"They have an outstanding
No. 1 doubles team," Gould said.
"And they have good singles play
ers."
The Waves' doubles team of
Cary Lothinger and Ari Nathan
were ranked No. 1 in the pre-sea
son Intercollegiate Tennis Asso
ciation rankings and Charles
Autfray was ranked No. 16 in
singles.
Nevertheless, Stanford's
depth up and down the line-up
should prove a nigh-impossible
task for Pepperdine to overcome.
"We'll be favored in these
matches, but we're going to take a
good hard look at the line-up, and
see if any adjustments are war
ranted," Gould said. "These
matches will help us to set the
line-up for Indoors. The next
three weeks will tell a lot about
who we are."

able to put Alvistur away, finally winning 6-
4, 7-6 (8).
"In the end. Hobby made the shot he had
to," Gould said. "It wasn't always pretty,
but he got it done."
Salzenstein came from a less-than
tremendous showing in doubles to win his
singles match against Del Rosario in
impressive fashion 6-3, 6-2.
The bottom three singles matches were
even more electric. In a seeming three-way
race to get off the court first, the Nos. 4, 5
and 6 Stanford singles made short work of
their opponents. Cocotos at fourth singles
dispatched Marasigan, 6-0, 6-2; Patel
downed lonesco 6-1, 6-4 at No. 5, and sixth
singles saw a rejuvenated Jim Thomas com
pletely dominate his opponent Aaron
Downey, 6-0, 6-1.

With ultimate concentration, Robert Devens slams one down in the
men's victory over San Jose yesterday.
"Our performance today says
a lot for our depth overall, even
down to our seventh and eighth
guys," Gould said. "This win over
a much improved team is a credit
to us."
Friday may give Stanford
more chance to exhibit its depth
as it takes on UNLV. Although
Coach Could said he does not
know what to expect from the
Rebels, the match will give play
ers much needed match experi
ence heading into NCAA Indoors,
Feb. 24-27 in Louisville, Ken.
The match against UNLV starts
a 1 p.m.
According to Gould, the
toughest match of the three will
be against Pepperdine on Satur
day at noon.
"They have an outstanding
No. 1 doubles team," Gould said.
"And they have good singles play
ers."
The Waves' doubles team of
Cary Lothinger and Ari Nathan
were ranked No. 1 in the pre-sea
son Intercollegiate Tennis Asso
ciation rankings and Charles
Autfray was ranked No. 16 in
singles.
Nevertheless, Stanford's
depth up and down the line-up
should prove a nigh-impossible
task for Pepperdine to overcome.
"We'll be favored in these
matches, but we're going to take a
good hard look at the line-up, and
see if any adjustments are war
ranted," Gould said. "These
matches will help us to set the
line-up for Indoors. The next
three weeks will tell a lot about
who we are."
