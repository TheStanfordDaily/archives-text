# Women's tennis to battle Tigers
## Poruri expected to dominate in team's No.1 singles spot 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
After three easy, early-season victories, the Stan
ford women's tennis team's season starts to intensi
fy today.
"Now each match gets a little more serious," said
head coach Frank Brennan. "Our chances of losing
to Hawaii were zero. Our chances of losing to Wash
ington were zero. Fresno State — zero. |University
of the Pacific) — one percent. University of San
Diego — five out of 100. San Diego State 10 out of
100 .... So were getting into the tougher stuff'. And
it's becoming more and more fun."

So if the Cardinal (3-0) repeated today's trip to
Pacific 100 times, the Tigers would emerge victori
ous once. And, with the lineup Stanford plans to field
in Stockton, don't expect that jackpot to be hit.
Brennan said the team would have its full lineup,
except Kim Shasby and Emma Woodhouse. There
fore, the top-ranked player in the country, Lax mi
Poruri, will join her teammates in the singles lineup
for the first time this season. Previously, she had
been playing in some professional tournaments and
was unable to play for Stanford.
And from the results, she has not been missed
Her teammates have yet to lose a singles match this
season, and have dropped a mere two sets to the com
petitors from Hawaii, Washington and Fresno State.
Senior Knstine Kurth, who has been playing in the
number one singles position in Poruri's absence, will
move down to number two Rounding out the start
ing six will be freshman Katie Schlukehir, sopho
more Beth Berris, freshman Sandra l)e Silva and
sophomore Wendy Sacks.
Sickness and injury have taken two from Stan
ford's lineup. Woodhouse, a senior who has been
playing number four singles, came down with a
stomach virus and will rest tomorrow.
Shasby, a sophomore, is a more serious case. An
All-American last year after sitting out her freshman
year due to injury, Shasby has yet to play in a dual
meet this season because she strained some liga
ments under the ball of her foot.
"The injury did not respond very well to what (the
trainers) were doing last week, so they started to get
a little more aggressive with it and we'll see," Bren
nan said. "She's trying to get ready and it's really
tough on her."
Without Shasby, Sacks will join Berris in the
number three doubles position. Poruri and Schluke
hir will play at number one for only the second time
this season, while Kurth and freshman Kmily Burt
continue together at number two.
In related news, the team signed two of its top
recruits. Ama Bleszynski, from Thousand Oaks
Calif, has committed to the Class of 1998. Standing
at 6-foot-2, she is the second-ranked recruit in the
country. Julie Scott, from Austin, Texas, will join
Bleszynski. Scott was heavily pursued by Texas
Duke and Florida, three of Stanford's biggest rivals'
Brennan said he was happy with the recruits "We
signed two really good girls," he said
