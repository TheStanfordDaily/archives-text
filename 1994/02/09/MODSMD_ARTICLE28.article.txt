## 8 business ideas include CD exchange, video-dating service 
### Rosalind Wang 
The Entrepreneurial Grants Board of the ASSU
announced yesterday that it has selected eight final
ists in the competition for a student-run business
giant totaling up to $10,000.
The projects under consideration as finalists
include two CD-exchange stores, a party lighting ser
vice, a silk screening business, a recording label, an
entertainment center and a video dating service.
Winners may be selected as early as next month.
The program was established last quarter by the
ASSU Senate to solicit ideas from students for an on
campus business to serve a student need. The senate
allocated $10,000 to be used as start-up costs for the
winning project.
The board originally planned to award the entire
amount of $10,000 to one winner, "but the appli
cants didn't request the full amount," said board
member John Moore. Instead, the board will likely
select multiple projects to receive smaller grants
totaling $10,000.
The number of projects chosen will depend on how
many "can be properly supervised," said graduate
senator Steve Abbott, a member of the grant board.
The students whose projects are selected will receive
a salary and founder's bonus, while the ASSU will
retain ownership of the businesses and any profits.
Finalist Jason Garoutte — who proposed a used
CD exchange — praised the program as "a fantastic
business opportunity. It provides free retail location,

free financial consulting and tremendous resources
for a student."
Applicants initially submitted short business pro
posals last month to the board, who then selected
ideas which demonstrated financial feasibility and
usefulness.
"We want to fund a project that is going to make
money. But just as important is that it is going to
provide a beneficial student service that is lacking on
campus," said undergraduate senator Roberto Milk.
According to Moore, the finalists distinguished
themselves by showing they had "a good idea of what
they wanted to do, had some business experience,
and seemed like they could make their ideas prof
itable for themselves and for the ASSU."
Finalists must submit a more detailed budget and
be interviewed by the board. The winners will be
picked by the end of the quarter, Moore said.
Council of Presidents member Jason Snyder, a
member of the board, dismissed concerns that other
ASSU programs will be hurt by the grants.
"This in no way whatsoever will impact the other
current business projects. This is a more innovative
way to invest our money, which will also serve the
students.
The finalists, chosen from a pool of 22 applicants,
include Jason Garoutte, Mark Greninger, Shane
Dyer, Ari Kurtz, Seth Spalding and the partnerships
of Benjamin Morgan and Ken Gunn; Chris Otto and
Joey Rosenblum; Chris Ooten and Ty Reed; and
Ryan Floyd, Peter Fenton and Ty Olson.
