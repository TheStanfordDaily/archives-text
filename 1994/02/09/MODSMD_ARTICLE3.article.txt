# Students celebrate Year of the Dog
## 
### Jo Marshall 
Although the ball fell in Times Square several
weeks ago, many Stanford students are gearing
up for another New Year's celebration this week
— this time to usher in the "Year of the Dog."
Tomorrow is the first day of the Lunar New
Year — also known as the Chinese New Year —
considered by many of the Asian community as
the most important holiday of the year.
Chinese, Korean, Taiwanese and Vietnamese
Stanford stafT and student organizations have
planned a series of events over the next few weeks
to welcome in the new year.
About 100 people were in White Plaza on Mon
day at lunchtime to listen to the Stanford Samul
nori, advertised as "a modern percussion form
with roots in traditional and modern Korea." The
performance was one of four cultural events
which the Asian American Student Association
organized to celebrate the holiday.
Other New Year celebrations earlier this week
included sword dancing and traditional music.
Tomorrow, students have the opportunity to re
ceive a lucky charm as they follow the San Jose
Youth Lion Dance through White Plaza.
"Usually we have the Lunar New Year cele
brations in the evening," said sophomore Tina
Kchen, AASA cultural education co-chair "But
this year we are having the events in White Plaza
during the day in order to involve more people
other than the Asian community."
Junior Howie Fung, co-chair of the Under
graduate Chinese American Association, said
UCAA is bringing in a guest speaker, Karen
Hwant, to talk about the origins of the Lunar
New Year. Hwant, a counselor at Counseling and
Psychological Services, will speak tomorrow

The Asian American Student Assocation has been gearing up for the
Year of the Dog all week with such performances and lectures.
night in the Asian American Activ
ities Center "in order to increase
people's awareness of Lunar New
Year," he said.
The Lunar New Year celebra
tions generally last for about 15
days, but not all of the Asian com
munity follows the same tradi
tions for celebrating the Lunar
New Year, according to Korean
graduate student Hjuk Jin
Cha."ln Korea we celebrate only 3
days," Cha said. "Also every year
we have a family principle. For

example, last year it was 'doing
good things.'"
Li Yong, a graduate student
from China, said that, in his fami
ly, celebrations for the Lunar New
Year traditionally center around
"visiting relatives and eating."
As a boy, Yong said he enjoyed
getting new clothes and"the
chance to play with firecrackers."
"When we used to go to the
neighbors' home they would give
us candy, so we would wear shirts
with big pockets to carry as much
as we could," Yong said.
In order to allow foreign stu
dents the opportunity to celebrate
the New Year while away from
home, Bechtel International Cen

ter will be hosting a New Year's
event organized by the Association
of Chinese Students and Scholars
at Stanford on Feb. 12.
"The evening will include Chi
nese food, ballroom dancing and a
Karaoke contest," said graduate
student Ping Jiang, cultural chair
for the ACSSS.
The lunar calendar is composed
of a symbolic cycle of 12 years and
each year is associated with a par
ticular animal. It is believed that
people born in that year are
endowed with the characteristics
of that animal. For example, peo
ple born in the Year of the Dog are
considered intelligent and deter
mined, yet guarded and critical.
