# Students celebrate Year of the Dog
## 
### Jo Marshall 
Although the ball fell in Times Square several
weeks ago, many Stanford students are gearing
up for another New Year's celebration this week
— this time to usher in the "Year of the Dog."
Tomorrow is the first day of the Lunar New
Year — also known as the Chinese New Year —
considered by many of the Asian community as
the most important holiday of the year.
Chinese, Korean, Taiwanese and Vietnamese
Stanford stafT and student organizations have
planned a series of events over the next few weeks
to welcome in the new year.
About 100 people were in White Plaza on Mon
day at lunchtime to listen to the Stanford Samul
nori, advertised as "a modern percussion form
with roots in traditional and modern Korea." The
performance was one of four cultural events
which the Asian American Student Association
organized to celebrate the holiday.
Other New Year celebrations earlier this week
included sword dancing and traditional music.
Tomorrow, students have the opportunity to re
ceive a lucky charm as they follow the San Jose
Youth Lion Dance through White Plaza.
"Usually we have the Lunar New Year cele
brations in the evening," said sophomore Tina
Kchen, AASA cultural education co-chair "But
this year we are having the events in White Plaza
during the day in order to involve more people
other than the Asian community."
Junior Howie Fung, co-chair of the Under
graduate Chinese American Association, said
UCAA is bringing in a guest speaker, Karen
Hwant, to talk about the origins of the Lunar
New Year. Hwant, a counselor at Counseling and
Psychological Services, will speak tomorrow
