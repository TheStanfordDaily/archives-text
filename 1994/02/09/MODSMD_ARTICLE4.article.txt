## Total University bill over $25K for first time

After two years of sharp tuition
growth, the Board of Trustees ap
proved a relatively modest 5 per
cent hike yesterday, raising the tu
ition fee to $ 18,669.
The increase means students
will pay $894 more to attend class
es next year, the smallest dollar in
crease since 1991.
Room and board costs will in
crease by 4 percent, to $6,796. The
combined hikes send the cost of at
tending Stanford over $25,000 per
year for the first time.
This year's increase is smaller
than last year's 7.5 percent tuition
hike and the 9.5 percent increase
approved two years ago. Adminis
trators said the smaller increase
shows that Stanford is aware of
tough financial times, while stu
dent leaders praised the moderate
hike and said they hoped for even
lower increases in the future.
"We are well aware of the finan
cial pressures on families given the
economy and the cost of educa
tion," said University Provost Con
doleezza Rice. "And while we feel
that a Stanford education is worth
a great deal, we wanted to try to re
main sensitive to those considera
tions."
The 5-percent increase is an ef
fort to maintain "cost-containment
during this time of budget reduc
tions," Rice said, adding that the

move would moderate the greater
burden that a large tuition hike
places on the financial aid office.
James Montoya, dean of under
graduate admissions, said the
high tuition increases of the past
few years had "raised questions
among some families over
whether high-quality education is
affordable."

The increase sends "good mes
sages" to parents, showing them
that Stanford is sensitive to finan
cial concerns, he said, adding that
admissions will still be need blind.
The tuition increases of the past
years don't seem to have deterred
students from applying to Stan

ford, Montoya said; applications to
the Class of 1998 were up 7 per
cent.
Most top-rank American univer
sities have raised their tuition sig
nificantly in recent years and also
have seen increases in applicants, he
added. Montoya said Stanford's
tuition is comparable to that of
other elite private universities.
Members of the Council of
Presidents said they were pleased
with the level of this year's
increase, and said the University
should continue to reign in future
tuition increases.
"Five percent is leaps and
bounds better than it was over the
past two years," said Jason Sny
der, a COP member and student
member of the trustee committee
that discussed the tuition increase.
Both Snyder and COP member
Ron Brown said that they hope
this is indicative of a larger com

mitment to keeping tuition down.
Last week, the COP proposed to
Rice and the board that tuition
hikes Ik 1 confined to the level of
inflation — which is currently
about 3 percent — plus an addi
tional 2 percent for the next two
years.
Three years ago, the board
pledged to hold tuition increases at
1 percent above inflation, but
abrogated the pledge in 1992.
Snyder said he hopes the Uni
versity will eventually aim to hold
tuition increases to the rate of
inflation, perhaps by the year
2000.
Although the figures the board
adopted are quite similar to the
COPs proposal, Rice stressed that
the COP "submitted their propos
al independently."
The factors considered by the
trustee committee that discussed
tuition included the rate of infla
tion, the University's current bud
get standing, how Stanford's
tuition currently compares to other
universities and how increases
financially affect students.

In other business, the trustees
voted yesterday to approve "in
concept" a plan to restructure the
Medical Center, but not any
specifics of the plan, said board
president John Freidenrich.
The Medical Center is hoping
the plan will help it compete in the
changing health-care market.
While specifics of the plan won't be
released until tomorrow after
noon, the plan generally changes
the structure of the Medical Cen
ter, integrates some of the services
it offers and tries to make the cen
ter more open to outside doctors.
It will create a not-for-profit
corporation called Stanford Health
System, Inc., that will oversee the
medical care provided at Stanford
Hospital, coordinate the clinical
work of hospital physicians, School
of Medicine faculty and communi
ty doctors, and oversee contract,
insurance and general administra
tive transactions.
The board did not, however,
vote on increasing faculty and staff
salary pools. Rice said her office is
still working on those proposals.
