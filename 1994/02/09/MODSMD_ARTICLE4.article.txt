## Total University bill over $25K for first time

After two years of sharp tuition
growth, the Board of Trustees ap
proved a relatively modest 5 per
cent hike yesterday, raising the tu
ition fee to $ 18,669.
The increase means students
will pay $894 more to attend class
es next year, the smallest dollar in
crease since 1991.
Room and board costs will in
crease by 4 percent, to $6,796. The
combined hikes send the cost of at
tending Stanford over $25,000 per
year for the first time.
This year's increase is smaller
than last year's 7.5 percent tuition
hike and the 9.5 percent increase
approved two years ago. Adminis
trators said the smaller increase
shows that Stanford is aware of
tough financial times, while stu
dent leaders praised the moderate
hike and said they hoped for even
lower increases in the future.
"We are well aware of the finan
cial pressures on families given the
economy and the cost of educa
tion," said University Provost Con
doleezza Rice. "And while we feel
that a Stanford education is worth
a great deal, we wanted to try to re
main sensitive to those considera
tions."
The 5-percent increase is an ef
fort to maintain "cost-containment
during this time of budget reduc
tions," Rice said, adding that the

move would moderate the greater
burden that a large tuition hike
places on the financial aid office.
James Montoya, dean of under
graduate admissions, said the
high tuition increases of the past
few years had "raised questions
among some families over
whether high-quality education is
affordable."

The increase sends "good mes
sages" to parents, showing them
that Stanford is sensitive to finan
cial concerns, he said, adding that
admissions will still be need blind.
The tuition increases of the past
years don't seem to have deterred
students from applying to Stan
