# ASSU restructuring bill defeated by wary senate
## 
### Charles Katz Jim Luh Staff writers 
Thwarting an attempt at governmental re
form, the ASSU Senate soundly defeated a
proposed constitutional amendment last
night that would have restructured the stu
dent legislature.
While most senators agreed that the sen
ate Ls in need of some form of restructuring,
many questioned whether the much-publi
cized plan proposed by undergraduate sena
tor Gabe Lucas would actually make the sen
ate more accountable and responsible. The
proposal received only 4 of the 14 votes it
needed.
The defeated proposal — originally intro
duced a month ago — called for a special elec
tion in which the student body would have
voted later this month on a constitutional
amendment to halve the size of the senate
from 40 to 20, move senate elections to the
fall, and require the senate to design four dis
tricting plans from which students would
choose
Some senators questioned the wisdom of
shrinking the senate and the assumption that
a smaller senate would automatically be more
efficient.
Others criticized the plan for not being well
thought-out and for not adequately setting
forth details such as the precise nature of the
districting plans.
The plan's critics also pointed out that if
elections were moved to the fall, freshmen
and first-year graduate l students would not be

familial enough with student government is
sues to make informed voting decisions.
Yet while they criticized Lucas' plan, the
senators applauded the motives behind his
plan, including improving the efficiency and
accountability of the senate.
"We should at least not stop here," said un
dergraduate senator Vanessa Alvarado. "I
think Gabe brought up an issue that is really
important for us to tackle."
The senate also quashed another govern
mental reform initiative — a proposal bv
graduate senator Neil Crellin to place on the
ballot a amendment to elimi
nate the Council of Presidents and leave the
ASSU without an executive branch.
Crellin said the victory of the"I Prefer Not
to Have a COP" slate — which had run on a
promise to eliminate 1 the COP once elected —
two years ago indicated that students were in
terested in the issue. But the measure re
ceived just 4 of the 14 votes that would be
needed to place it on the ballot.
Senate Chair Greg Waldorf also submitted
a proposal to place an amendment on a ballot
that would replace the COP with a President
and a Vice 1 President, thus making the execu
tive branch more accountable. That measure
will be voted on at the next senate meeting.
Although they defeated Lucas' proposal,
the senate reaffirmed its interest in reforming
student government One of the senators'
main objections to Lucas' bill was that it in
corporated three issues into one vote, as the
amendment would have forced students to
choose to halve the senate and
move elections to the fall in order to
pass a districting proposal.
Graduate senator Sanford Dick
er! suggested that Lucas' linkage of
the three issues was part of an
attempt to slip reforms past a stu
dent body that may want districting
but not necessarily a reduction in
the number of senators.
"My idea is that [shrinking the
senate! is the idea he definitely
wants through and |districting! is
the bait," Dickert said.
Alvarado echoed many senators'
desire to see each question resolved
individually. "I would feel a lot
more comfortable voting for the
three issues separately," she said.
Lucas and his supporters
emphasized that passing the
amendment would not necessarily
constitute tin endorsement by the
senate but would simply allow the
students to decide.
He said his opponents were

effectively saying, "God forbid we
actually ask the students what
should be done."
Regardless of the senators' per
sonal opinions, Lucas said, "I hope
we all agree that it is a reasonable
plan to put forth to the student
body."
But apparently not enough sena
tors agreed, as they questioned
whether the proposed changes in
the size and makeup of the senate
would actually improve the legisla
tive body.
Undergraduate senator Roberto
Milk said, "I think we can still com
promise on this and come up with a
better plan."
"What I have a problem with is
change just for change's sake," said
undergraduate senator Anietie
Ekanem.
Although the bill failed, Dickert
said the debate over Lucas' bill
focused on an important issue. "I
think the senate identified that
there is a problem with accessibility
and effectiveness of the senate.
Part of the problem is due to lead
ership within the COP and their
lack of transferal of experience to

the senate as a whole."
Lucas expressed disappointment
with the senate.
"People were afraid what this
bill might do to the current senate.
That tone is the wrong way" to
approach a major change in the
structure of the senate, Lucas said.
The debate on Lucas' bill was
preceded by a heated exchange
between Crellin and COP member
Ron Brown. Crellin questioned the
COP's reasoning behind proposing
a tuition increase 2 percent above
inflation, saying the COP should
have fought harder for a smaller
increase. The Board of Trustees
announced yesterday that tuition
will rise by 5 percent next year,
roughly the amount the COP pro
posed.
Crellin also said the COP's pro
posal was suspect, suggesting that
COP member Jason Snyder may
have had advance information
about the University's plans.
Crellin said the COP may have
proposed something that they knew
was already in the works in order to
improve their image. Brown
emphatically denied the charges.

a tuition increase 2 percent above
inflation, saying the COP should
have fought harder for a smaller
increase. The Board of Trustees
announced yesterday that tuition
will rise by 5 percent next year,
roughly the amount the COP pro
posed.
Crellin also said the COP's pro

about the University's plans.

Thwarting an attempt at governmental re
form, the ASSU Senate soundly defeated a
proposed constitutional amendment last
night that would have restructured the stu
dent legislature.
While most senators agreed that the sen
ate Ls in need of some form of restructuring,
many questioned whether the much-publi
cized plan proposed by undergraduate sena
tor Gabe Lucas would actually make the sen
ate more accountable and responsible. The
proposal received only 4 of the 14 votes it
needed.
The defeated proposal — originally intro
duced a month ago — called for a special elec
tion in which the student body would have
voted later this month on a constitutional
amendment to halve the size of the senate
from 40 to 20, move senate elections to the
fall, and require the senate to design four dis
tricting plans from which students would
choose
Some senators questioned the wisdom of
shrinking the senate and the assumption that
a smaller senate would automatically be more
efficient.
Others criticized the plan for not being well
thought-out and for not adequately setting
forth details such as the precise nature of the
districting plans.
The plan's critics also pointed out that if
elections were moved to the fall, freshmen
and first-year graduate l students would not be

familial enough with student government is
sues to make informed voting decisions.
Yet while they criticized Lucas' plan, the
senators applauded the motives behind his
plan, including improving the efficiency and
accountability of the senate.
"We should at least not stop here," said un
dergraduate senator Vanessa Alvarado. "I
think Gabe brought up an issue that is really
important for us to tackle."
The senate also quashed another govern
mental reform initiative — a proposal bv
graduate senator Neil Crellin to place on the
ballot a amendment to elimi
nate the Council of Presidents and leave the
ASSU without an executive branch.
Crellin said the victory of the"I Prefer Not
to Have a COP" slate — which had run on a
promise to eliminate 1 the COP once elected —
two years ago indicated that students were in
terested in the issue. But the measure re
ceived just 4 of the 14 votes that would be
needed to place it on the ballot.
Senate Chair Greg Waldorf also submitted
a proposal to place an amendment on a ballot
that would replace the COP with a President
and a Vice 1 President, thus making the execu
tive branch more accountable. That measure
will be voted on at the next senate meeting.
Although they defeated Lucas' proposal,
the senate reaffirmed its interest in reforming
student government One of the senators'
main objections to Lucas' bill was that it in
corporated three issues into one vote, as the
amendment would have forced students to
choose to halve the senate and
move elections to the fall in order to
pass a districting proposal.
Graduate senator Sanford Dick
er! suggested that Lucas' linkage of
the three issues was part of an
attempt to slip reforms past a stu
dent body that may want districting
but not necessarily a reduction in
the number of senators.
"My idea is that [shrinking the
senate! is the idea he definitely
wants through and |districting! is
the bait," Dickert said.
Alvarado echoed many senators'
desire to see each question resolved
individually. "I would feel a lot
more comfortable voting for the
three issues separately," she said.
Lucas and his supporters
emphasized that passing the
amendment would not necessarily
constitute tin endorsement by the
senate but would simply allow the
students to decide.
He said his opponents were

effectively saying, "God forbid we
actually ask the students what
should be done."
Regardless of the senators' per
sonal opinions, Lucas said, "I hope
we all agree that it is a reasonable
plan to put forth to the student
body."
But apparently not enough sena
tors agreed, as they questioned
whether the proposed changes in
the size and makeup of the senate
would actually improve the legisla
tive body.
Undergraduate senator Roberto
Milk said, "I think we can still com
promise on this and come up with a
better plan."
"What I have a problem with is
change just for change's sake," said
undergraduate senator Anietie
Ekanem.
Although the bill failed, Dickert
said the debate over Lucas' bill
focused on an important issue. "I
think the senate identified that
there is a problem with accessibility
and effectiveness of the senate.
Part of the problem is due to lead
ership within the COP and their
lack of transferal of experience to

the senate as a whole."
Lucas expressed disappointment
with the senate.
"People were afraid what this
bill might do to the current senate.
That tone is the wrong way" to
approach a major change in the
structure of the senate, Lucas said.
The debate on Lucas' bill was
preceded by a heated exchange
between Crellin and COP member
Ron Brown. Crellin questioned the
COP's reasoning behind proposing
a tuition increase 2 percent above
inflation, saying the COP should
have fought harder for a smaller
increase. The Board of Trustees
announced yesterday that tuition
