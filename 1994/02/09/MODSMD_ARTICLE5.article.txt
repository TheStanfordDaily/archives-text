Thwarting an attempt at governmental re
form, the ASSU Senate soundly defeated a
proposed constitutional amendment last
night that would have restructured the stu
dent legislature.
While most senators agreed that the sen
ate Ls in need of some form of restructuring,
many questioned whether the much-publi
cized plan proposed by undergraduate sena
tor Gabe Lucas would actually make the sen
ate more accountable and responsible. The
proposal received only 4 of the 14 votes it
needed.
The defeated proposal — originally intro
duced a month ago — called for a special elec
tion in which the student body would have
voted later this month on a constitutional
amendment to halve the size of the senate
from 40 to 20, move senate elections to the
fall, and require the senate to design four dis
tricting plans from which students would
choose
Some senators questioned the wisdom of
shrinking the senate and the assumption that
a smaller senate would automatically be more
efficient.
Others criticized the plan for not being well
thought-out and for not adequately setting
forth details such as the precise nature of the
districting plans.
The plan's critics also pointed out that if
elections were moved to the fall, freshmen
and first-year graduate l students would not be

familial enough with student government is
sues to make informed voting decisions.
Yet while they criticized Lucas' plan, the
senators applauded the motives behind his
plan, including improving the efficiency and
accountability of the senate.
"We should at least not stop here," said un
dergraduate senator Vanessa Alvarado. "I
think Gabe brought up an issue that is really
important for us to tackle."
The senate also quashed another govern
mental reform initiative — a proposal bv
graduate senator Neil Crellin to place on the
ballot a amendment to elimi
nate the Council of Presidents and leave the
ASSU without an executive branch.
Crellin said the victory of the"I Prefer Not
to Have a COP" slate — which had run on a
promise to eliminate 1 the COP once elected —
two years ago indicated that students were in
terested in the issue. But the measure re
ceived just 4 of the 14 votes that would be
needed to place it on the ballot.
Senate Chair Greg Waldorf also submitted
a proposal to place an amendment on a ballot
that would replace the COP with a President
and a Vice 1 President, thus making the execu
tive branch more accountable. That measure
will be voted on at the next senate meeting.
Although they defeated Lucas' proposal,
the senate reaffirmed its interest in reforming
student government One of the senators'
main objections to Lucas' bill was that it in
corporated three issues into one vote, as the
amendment would have forced students to
