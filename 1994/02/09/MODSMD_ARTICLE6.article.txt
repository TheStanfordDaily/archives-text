Complainants of sexual harassment on
campus now have access to a team of advis
ers and panelists recently appointed as part
of Stanford's new harassment policy.
Twenty-three faculty and staff members
from various departments on campus have
agreed to serve as a panel resource for the
University's sexual harassment procedural
process.
The new advisers and panelists are a key
element of Stanford's new sexual harass
ment policy, which was endorsed in mid-Oc
tober by the Faculty Senate and subse
quently implemented by University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper. The policy prohibits
any form of sexual harassment and in
cludes guidelines for procedural actions
and implementation processes and a glos
saryof related terms.

policy. Clinical Psychiatry Prof Laraine

Zappert, said the advisers and panelists are
an informal group to whom students, ad
ministration, faculty and staff can turn for
resolution of sexual harassment concerns.
"The idea of having a panel is to give
members of the Stanford community a va
riety of points of access in order to the work
through problems of the sexual harassment
issue," Zappert said
Prior to the implementation of the new
policy, the main avenue available to com
plainants was to report the sexual harass
ment to the head of their respective depart
ments.
The panel of faculty and staff members
is composed of six panelists and 17 advisers.
According to Zappert, the panelists serve as
assistants and consultants to the Universi
ty administration.
"They act as an opt ional resource to the
school or administrative officers responsi-
ble for investigating charges and
remedying situations where sexu
al harassment is found," she said.
The group of advisers is avail
able to discuss sexual harassment
charges or concerns with stu
dents, faculty and staff. "They are
a resource to the individual and
help facilitate the harassment
policy process," Zappert said.
The search for the panel began
in November, when Barbara But
terfield, vice-president of faculty
and staff services, sent letters to
department vice presidents, vice
provosts, deans and the Universi
ty Management Group to request
nominations.
The criteria for the panelists
and advisers included analytical
and communication skills, "a rep
utation for integrity, maturity,
and good judgment," the ability to
maintain confidentiality, experi
ence in dispute mediation, and a
two-year commitment to service
as panelists or advisors, according
to Butterfield's letter.
Zappert said the diversity of
departments represented in the
group of advisers and panelists is
an advantage because com
plainants of sexual harassment or
individuals concerned about the
issue have a wide range of choices
to consult.
"One doesn't necessarily have

to go to an adviser in one's own
department," she said.
School of Education Assoc.
Dean Myra Strober, who was
selected as an adviser, stressed
the importance of providing com
plainants with remedies at the
informal level.
"Our role is to help com
plainants see that they have
options," she said. "There are
resources and techniques available
for stopping the harassment with
out making a formal complaint."
According to Zappert, these
techniques include a face-to-face
talk with the accused harasser
requesting that the person stop

any improper actions. Another
technique is to write a letter to
the perpetrator, stating what the
harassing behavior consists of
and what the accused should do.
However, Zappert was quick to
point out that "these strategies
are effective only in instances
where there is no threat of physi
cal harm or sexual assault."
Another significant aspect of
the panel is the attention it pays
to the privacy of complainants
and those accused of sexual
harassment. "The panel works
carefully within the realm of con
fidentiality as prescribed by the
law," Zappert said.
