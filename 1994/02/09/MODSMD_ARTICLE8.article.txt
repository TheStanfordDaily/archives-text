## Clinton health plan under attack Congressional Budget Office claims plan will increase deficit 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — In a setback
for the White House, the Congressional
Budget Office said yesterday the Clinton
health plan would drive the federal
deficit $74 billion higher over the next
six years, not cut it by $58 billion as
billed.
In its long-awaited, independent
look at the White House proposal for
paying for universal coverage, the CBO
also concluded that the premiums
would be 15 percent more expensive
and should be listed as part of the fed
eral budget.
Republicans cheered the CBO's 81-
page analysis, saying it demonstrated
that President Clinton was proposing
"a massive new entitlement program,"
as Rep. Bill Archer of Texas put it.
"This is not a market-drive solution.
It is a massive intervention by the fed
eral government," Archer said. He and
other Republicans applauded the CBO
for resisting White House arguments
that most of the plan's costs should be
left off budget.
Democrats put their own spin on the
numbers. House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt said it confirmed

that Clinton's plan "is generally on tar
get" and would cut the nation's health
bill by $150 billion in the year 2004
alone — a 7 percent savings.
Clinton, after making an appeal for
health reform to workers at a General
Motors pickup plant in Shreveport, La.,
said the CBO deficit figures were "not a
problem."
"We'll fix that," said the president.
"That's a Washington policy wonk deal.
No serious person out here in the real
world will be too troubled by that."
But it was a blow to Clinton's con
tention that his plan can cover every
American by 1998 without imposing
any major, broad-based new taxes.
Clinton has repeatedly sold health
reform as key to getting the $4 trillion
deficit under control. Three major busi
ness groups turned their backs on the
Clinton plan in the past week.
CBO Director Robert D. Reischauer,
a Democratic economist clearly uncom
fortable with the news he was bringing,
sought to play down the deficit numbers.
But he said the Clinton Health Security
Act would add $74 billion in red ink
through the year 2000 and a total of

$126 billion from 1995 through 2004.
Still, Reischauer said that is only a
small fraction of the deficits the gov
ernment ran up in the past decade and
is likely to run up in the next 10 years.
He told the House Ways and Means
Committee such an increase must be
"balanced against the advantage of liv
ing in a nation where no one lacks
health insurance coverage."
Reischauer said that in the longer
run, after 2004, Clinton's plan "holds
out the promise of reducing the deficit."
Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell said the CBO was wrong to
insist that the health plan all be count
ed as part of the budget."It confuses a
federal requirement with a federally
funded program," he said.
House Republican Whip Newt Gin
grich declared the CBO report made
Clinton's plan "dead on arrival" and
said the House should get on with writ
ing its own bipartisan bill.
Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico,
the top Republican on the Senate Bud
get Committee, said even the CBO esti
mates of the costs of Clinton's program
"are too low."
