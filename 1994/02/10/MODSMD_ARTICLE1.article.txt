# Senators decide to look for solutions

### Charles Katz Staff writer 
The fire that heated discus
sions concerning the restructur
ing of the ASSU Senate on Tues
day has been reduced to barely
glowing embers. In a meeting last
night, 10 members of the senate
along with Senate Chair Greg
Waldorf, decided to hold off on
making any immediate changes
to the ASSU constitution.
Instead, the group decided to
assign people to look into possible
ways of changing the senate from
within, and not through amend
ments — such as the newly de
feated one suggested by under
graduate senator Gabe Lucas —
that the entire student body
would vote on.
Graduate senator Jerry Yang
summed up the tone of the meet
ing, by saying that he did not
know exactly what the problem
with the ASSU is. "[The senate]
has worked decently well this
year given the flimsy system. But
I think we're missing something;
I can't put my finger on it."
The general consensus among
the senators was that the senate
did need some form of changes.

However, what the actual reforms
would consist of eluded the meet
ing's participants. "We need to
define the problems," Yang said.
One specific problem the sen
ators did identify is the atten
dance policy for senators. Cur
rently, if senators miss three
consecutive meetings, they are
moved to the bottom of the vot
ing order, and if they miss five
consecutive, they are dismissed
from the senate.
All the senators agreed that
the policy should at least be
looked into. "Possibly, there
should be a by-law to change the

attendance policy," Waldorf said.
Having some sort of orienta
tion procedure for first-year sena
tors was also kicked around as a
possible reform. "There should be
a set of recommendations for new
senators to bring them up to
speed," Yang said.
The group also decided to con
duct some kind of survey to find
out what the senators felt their
purpose was as a governing body.
"[Lucas] saw that something
was broken and needs to be
fixed," said undergraduate sena
tor Peter Cousins. "We need to
investigate to see what's broken."
