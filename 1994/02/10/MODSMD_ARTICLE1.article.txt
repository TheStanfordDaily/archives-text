# Senators decide to look for solutions
## 
### Charles Katz Staff writer 
The fire that heated discus
sions concerning the restructur
ing of the ASSU Senate on Tues
day has been reduced to barely
glowing embers. In a meeting last
night, 10 members of the senate
along with Senate Chair Greg
Waldorf, decided to hold off on
making any immediate changes
to the ASSU constitution.
Instead, the group decided to
assign people to look into possible
ways of changing the senate from
within, and not through amend
ments — such as the newly de
feated one suggested by under
graduate senator Gabe Lucas —
that the entire student body
would vote on.
