## NATO allies give Serbs ultimatum Serbs must withdraw from Sarajevo within 10 days or face air strikes 
### 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - After
months of indecision, NATO allies yes
terday warned the Bosnian Serbs to
lift their murderous siege of Sarajevo
or face air raids.
The allies' ultimatum gives the
Serbs 10 days beginning midnight
tonight Greenwich Mean Time (7 p.m.
EST tonight) to withdraw their heavy
guns surrounding the beleaguered
city.
Earlier, the Serbs, apparently seek
ing to head off NATO air strikes,
arranged a quick cease-fire with the
United Nations and pledged to with
draw their artillery from around the
besieged city and put the guns under
U.N. monitoring.
The Serbs have more than 500
heavy guns ringing the Bosnian capi
tal, which they have been pounding for
nearly two years.
In a statement, the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization warned the Serbs
that if they fail to comply with the
deadline, their heavy weapons will "be
subject to NATO air strikes." The
deadline ends at midnight GMT (7
p.m. EST) Feb. 20.
If launched, the NATO air strikes
would be the alliance's first offensive
military action in 44 years.

The allies pledged to carry out raids
"against artillery or mortar positions
in and around Sarajevo . . . which are
determined by (U.N. peacekeepers) to
be responsible for attacks against civil
ian targets."
Diplomats said NATO Secretary-
General Manfred Woerner had imme
diately informed U.N. chief Boutros
Boutros-Ghali of the decision.
Boutros-Ghali had requested
authority to call NATO air strikes
after a mortar slammed into a crowded
market in Sarajevo last Saturday,
killing 68 people and wounding 200.
In their statement, the allies said
the "Bosnian Serbs bear the main
responsibility for the tragic loss of
civilian life" as a result of the siege of
Sarajevo.
The U.S.-French plan for an ulti
matum had met with some opposition.
Canada, which has some 2,000
peacekeepers in the region, was wor
ried that any air strikes would invite
reprisals from the Serbs and hinder
the delivery of desperately needed
humanitarian aid to the war's victims.
Russia, while not a NATO member,
has longstanding ties with the Serbs
and opposes air strikes against them.
Greece had expressed some opposi

tion, but Greek government
spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said
in Athens that his country — tradi
tionally sympathetic toward Serbs —
wouldn't block an allied decision to
bomb Serb targets.
To carry out any bombing runs, the
alliance may use 70 warplanes from
France, the Netherlands, Turkey,
Britain and the United States. Based
at southern European air bases, they
now enforce a no-fly zone over Bosnia
The French Defense Ministry said
the aircraft carrier Foch, now in
Toulon, has been put on alert to steam
to the Adriatic Sea if needed to assist
NATO allies. France is not a member
of NATO's integrated command.
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian
Serb leader, warned against any air
raids.
"We will shoot down every plane we
can" if attacked, he said. "In case of an
attack, we cannot guarantee safety to
any foreigner who finds himself on our
territory."
NATO nations are Belgium,
Britain, Canada, Denmark, France,
Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Lux
embourg, the Netherlands, Norway,
Portugal, Spain, Turkey and the Unit
ed States.
