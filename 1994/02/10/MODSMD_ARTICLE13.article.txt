PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Attorneys
for Tonya Harding filed a $20 million
lawsuit against the U.S. Olympic Com
mittee late yesterday, seeking to pre
vent it from interfering with her partic
ipation in the Lillehammer Games.
The 16-page suit, filed in Clacka
mas County Circuit Court in the sub
urb of Oregon City a half-hour before
the courthouse closed, admits that
people close to Harding have been
charged with conspiracy in the attack
on Nancy Kerrigan, but said no
charges have been filed against her.
The document points out that
Harding has complied with all rules
and regulations of the U.S. Figure
Skating Association.
It seeks $20 million in punitive
damages.

Earlier yesterday, Harding's ex
husband asked a court for permission
to travel to Norway to testify in the
U.S. Olympic Committee proceedings
against her.
Jeff Gillooly also asked that the
results of an FBI lie-detector test he
took as part of his plea bargain
arrangement be disclosed so he can
present them to the USOC commit
tee, which is scheduled to convene in
Oslo on Tuesday to determine
whether Harding should be removed
from the Olympic team.
"He wants to cooperate with the
USOC's fact finding in an attempt to
mitigate the injury he and others have
caused Nancy Kerrigan and her fami
ly," Gillooly's attorney, Ron Hoevet,
said in his motion.

A hearing was set for 5:30 p.m.
EST today for Multnomah County
Circuit Judge Donald Londer to con
sider the request.
Gillooly has pleaded guilty to rack
eteering for his role in the Jan. 6
attack on Kerrigan and has said Hard
ing was in on the plot and gave the
final go-ahead. In exchange for his
plea, he will be sentenced to two years
in prison and fined $100,000, and no
additional charges will be filed against
him.
Harding has denied Gillooly's alle
gations but has admitted she learned
that people around her were involved
in the plot when she returned from
the U.S. Figure Skating Champi
onships and did not report it to
authorities immediately.
