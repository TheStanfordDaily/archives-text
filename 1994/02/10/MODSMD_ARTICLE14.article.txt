PLO-Israel agree
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) - PLO leader
Yasser Arafat and Shimon Peres, Israel's
foreign minister, reached agreement yes
terday on critical security issues that
have stalled the Israeli-Palestinian peace
accord.
Although some matters remain in dis
pute, both sides called the agreement a
major step forward, as did President
Clinton in Washington.
Peres said he and the Palestine Liber
ation Organization chairman had settled
"five or six of the most complicated
issues" involved in turning over control
of the occupied Gaza Strip and West
Bank town of Jericho to the Palestinians.

But Peres added, "We didn't complete
our work."
The issues that Arafat and Peres had
discussed intensively for three days
included control of the crossings from
the autonomous Palestinian areas to
Egypt and Jordan, security for Jewish
settlers who remain in Gaza and how
much land around Jericho would be
ceded to Palestinian control.
Peres said the size of the Jericho area
has yet to be decided, but indicated the
others were agreed in principle and will
need to be worked out in detail. Egyp
tian sources, speaking anonymously,
said there also remained disagreement
about who actually would stand at the
borders.
