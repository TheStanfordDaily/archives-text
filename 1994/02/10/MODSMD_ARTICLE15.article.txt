## Editorials ASSU â€” think twice 
### 
GOOD IDEAS are in short
supply. Lucrative ones are
even more scarce. But the
ASSU appears willing to take the
chance on them.
In November, the ASSU
announced it would fund up to
$10,000 for a student business
idea that could eventually become
one of its business projects. The
main goals were to introduce more
students to the ASSU, give stu
dents business experience and to
make money.
Now, 22 applications later, it has
received a range of ideas. Among
the eight final ideas are two CD
exchanges, a video dating service,
a silk screening business, a record
ing label, a party lighting service
and an entertainment center.
None of these screams "cash cow."
But because few asked for the
full $10,000 start-up capital
either, the ASSU may spread the
wealth to a handful of these ideas.
Before it digs into its pockets and
decides how to divide the dough,

though, it should remember one of
its original goals: to make money.
While the eight final ideas dis
play an admirable entrepreneurial
spirit, few seem as though they
would attract the widespread
interest needed to sustain a suc
cessful venture. There's little
doubt that the services could be
useful to students in various ways.
The harder question is, would
they be lucrative enough to justify
spending up to $10,000 on them?
The ASSU should not feel com
pelled to bankroll a number of
small projects just because it can.
Although it may seem difficult to
renege on all or part of its $10,000
offer, this decision may seem more
shrewd in light of other potential
outcomes.
The ASSU should remember
that its money is ultimately the
students' money, and should treat
it as such when it decides on its
investments.
Because any way you divide it
up, $10,000 is no small change.
