RAPE AWARENESS has been
a hot topic on college campus
tes across the nation. Stanford
is no exception, and a recent group
formed to help victims of sexual
assault is a welcome addition to a
strong array of counseling and infor
mation resources on campus.
Sexual Assault Legal Advocates is
a new student-run group designed to
advise survivors of sexual assault on
their legal options. The group is
composed of 14 volunteer law stu
dents — most of whom have had
some experience in counseling sexu
al assault victims — who will provide
information in confidential sessions.
The group, which will officially
begin operating at the end of this
month, will be able to help people
with reporting an incident, seeking
judicial hearings on campus and get
ting over the fear of the criminal jus
tice system and civil lawsuits. These

are important issues about which
victims would not know as much if
these students did not volunteer
their services. Only two rape victims
in the last 15 years had a judicial
hearing through the University, said
a member of the group — hopefully,
this new group will encourage more
victims to step forward.
The group is a model for students
becoming actively involved in the
Stanford community. Beginning
with the idea of one person, second
year law student Isabel Traugott,
the group will hopefully prove to be
an invaluable service for Stanford
students.
Other students should follow her
lead and create new groups that will
have a positive impact on the com
munity. With more similarly con
ceived groups, students helping stu
dents will become an important part
of the Stanford experience.
