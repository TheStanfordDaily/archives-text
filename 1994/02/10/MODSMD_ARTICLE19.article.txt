## All's fair in love and movies 
### 
WOO BOY. It's almost Valentine's
Day again. And we all know how
wonderful it is to be in love. Or at
the very least, we've heard about it —
maybe from television or the movies.
Especially the movies. Cinematic lovers
are unreal. They make lust-packed eye
contact from a mile away. They always
know the right lines. And when they have
sex, it's like Russian ballet. Except usually,
they're naked.
Seeing how good those movie folks are
made me think. At first, I felt horrible. I
wondered what was wrong with me. But
once I stopped feeling sorry for myself, I
had a pocket-sized vision.
Why not try out some of the techniques
that I'd seen in the theater? Ninety-five
percent of the time, film lovers bring it on
home. The other five percent — who cares.
I started with the "Cinema Paradiso"
style. Her name was Honey. I saw her in
an upper-division electrical engineering
class, and right then, I knew she would
grow to love me. I walked right into the
room to introduce myself and to tell her I
loved her. As I reached out to meet her, I
knocked her newest project off the coun
tertop and onto the floor, shattering it into
a million pieces. It was then that we
shared our first words. They were so inti
mate, I'm embarrassed to reveal them
here. She wouldn't have shared them with
just anyone.
I tried to talk to Honey several other
times. But our love was so intense, she had

difficulty even looking at me. Finally, I
decided to wait outside her dorm window
for 100 days, or until she loved me,
whichever came first.
I never moved from my spot. I didn't
change my clothes, either. She always pre
tended not to see me. But she knew I was
there. Finally, 100 days had passed. It was
mid-July. I was sitting there in a ripped
shirt and underwear, and she had graduat
ed. I never saw her again.
But not to worry. There would be oth
ers. I'd seen a lot of movies.
So when I met Crystal, I knew that
"Say Anything" would do the trick. I got
a haircut. Bought myself a trenchcoat.
Got a little brother and taught him how
to kickbox. Before I knew it, I was stand
ing outside her dorm, holding a boom
box over my head and playing Julio Igle
sias, because I couldn't find any Peter
Gabriel.
Finally, Crystal came to her window,
and realized I was playing Julio for her.
"I love you," I yelled.
"Turn off that damn music!" she
shrieked back affectionately.
"I love you," I said again, turning the
music up. Soon the front doors of the dorm
opened. I watched the sensual sway of her
body as she approached. I imagined what it
was going to be like to finally kiss her. My
destiny was at hand.
But when she got close, Crystal wasn't
herself. She was somebody else, about six
foot-six and male — her boyfriend. He

kicked the living crap out of me. On top of
that, he took the boom box inside. I never
saw it again.
Still, I was undaunted. I believed in the
magic of movies and so I tried again. And
again. And again. With Samantha I tried
"Excalibur." A friend dressed up like Mer
lin and told me my lust would carry me.
But it didn't.
With Anastasia, it was "Do the Right
Thing." I showed up at her doorstep with a
Jumbo-sized bag of ice and told her I want
ed to rub it all over her body. But it was
winter, and she had a boyfriend, too.
I even did "Rocky" for Bernice. But
when I yelled "Bernice!" in White Plaza at
the top of my lungs, doing my best Stallone
imitation, she just didn't appreciate it.
In the end, nothing I did ever worked.
True love, I learned, could never be like it
was in the movies. In the movies, you
always had a second take if you needed it.
In the movies, you had a writer telling you
what to say and a director telling you how
to say it. In real life, you were on your own.
But with Valentine's Day coming, who
knows? I've seen some new movies lately.
You could be next.

Dave is thinking about using Mickey
Rourke's "9 1/2 Weeks" love strategy on
anyone remotely interested.
