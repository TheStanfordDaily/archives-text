## ASSU is a sham â€” challenge is to revamp old system 
### 
IFOR ONE am very disappointed in
the ASSU's lack of interest in
reforming itself. There is a press
ing need for revamping the ASSU Sen
ate, as student leaders of various orga
nizations agreed in a leadership con
ference sponsored by the COP last
quarter. Many student group leaders
feel that, at present, the ASSU Senate
is not representing the students what
soever and is an ineffective body in
these times of crises involving such
issues as storage, budget cuts and
tuition hikes. Furthermore, many
agreed that we were fortunate to have
some operational voice in the Universi
ty via the Council of Presidents.
The present problem with the ASSU
is that it does not represent the stu
dents. First, the nature of the election

selects apathetic senators. Every spring
quarter, a few "resume-oriented" people
run for the senate positions under color
ful popularity banners and slick names.
I won't mention names, but I am sure
you still remember their campaign slo
gans. Then they hibernate and re
emerge in next year's elections. What
did they do in the meantime? Under the
present system, to obtain quorum so
that the senate can even function, non
voting senators are given the right to
vote. Don't you agree that those sena
tors who actually attend the meetings
should represent the student body? Sen
ators also only do "just enough work."
To some, the definition of being a sena
tor is to attend a meeting and do noth
ing productive for two hours biweekly.
Seriously, I have heard of senators

leaving because the allotted two-hour
time they scheduled was up. At the lead
ership conference and Gabe Lucas'
meetings to revise the senate, there
were at most three senators attending
them. I ask, if the ASSU senators are
interested in reforming themselves or
interacting with concerned group lead
ers, why didn't they attend these meet
ings? I believe that the ASSU Senate
needs to be revamped.
In The Daily's Feb. 9 article, some
senators argue that too many issues
were being presented and forced onto
the student body. Well, sorry to tell my
"senators," but since you didn't come to
the meetings to listen, student leaders
and the students think you're a sham.
We want a radical change. For once in
its existence, I challenge the ASSU to

get its act together and by the spring
elections, present a few alternate plans
for the students to vote on, if the sena
tors don't like the "radical" Lucas bill
(which I prefer).
Remember that the U.S. Constitu
tion was the result of our founding
fathers deciding to dump the old, inef
fective Articles of Confederation and
rewrite them afresh. Likewise, the
ASSU Senate needs to throw out its old
system of organization and rewrite
itself so that it truly represents the stu
dent body and is an effective govern
ment.
