# Coverage of Islamic leader is misleading
## 
### 
After reading the Feb. 7 article
"Islamic leader praised: Speaker lauds
Louis Farrakhan," I find myself won
dering if the reporter and I had attend
ed the same talk. While Imam Warith
Deen Mohammed briefly referred to
Farrakhan in response to a question
from the audience, his lecture was nei
ther an endorsement nor a condemna
tion of political figures involved with
the Nation of Islam.
Imam Mohammed's history of the
Nation of Islam begins with the
appearance of its founder, W.D. Fard.
Central to the nation's doctrine was
the tainted and inferior derivative.
Fard's teachings appealed to the black
community of the early twentieth cen
tury, who in Imam Mohammed's
words bore "the psychological burden
of three hundred years" of bondage.
Members of the Nation of Islam famil
iarized themselves with the Koran,

although it became clear to many that
the message of the Koran was incom
patible with much of the Nation's doc
trine.
In his talk, Imam Mohammed
asserted that these teachings served
as "a tease" to attract blacks to the
Nation of Islam. Imam Mohammed
maintained that although the nation
was the catalyst for a good deal of
positive change in the black commu
nity, its doctrine is flawed. He fur
ther states that once many blacks
became exposed to the message of
equality in the Koran, they began to
question the nation and its tenets of
racial superiority. (Malcolm X is an
excellent example of this phe
nomenon). Thus, it is through the
nation of Islam that many African-
American Muslims have come to the
Islam that is embraced by one billion
qther Muslims worldwide.
Imam Mohammed broke from the
Nation of Islam, which at the time was
headed by his father, the Hon. Elijah
Mohammed. Louis Farrakhan
remained with the nation. In response

to a question from the audience during
his lecture, Imam Mohammed com
mended Farrakhan's denunciation of
his aide's anti-Semitic remarks of last
week. However, he also expressed hope
that Farrakhan would follow the path
of those who broke from the nation
and embraced orthodox Islam.
It is unfortunate that the article did
not address Imam Mohammed's histo
ry of black Muslims or his thoughts on
uniting the ethnically diverse Muslim
community in the United States.
Rather, the article juxtaposed a num
ber of statements which, when
removed from the context of the lec
ture, inaccurately represented the
message of Imam Mohammed.
