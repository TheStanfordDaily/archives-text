# Walkers' rights rolled over by speeding bikes
## 
### 
For the second time in many years I
have been hit by some jerk careening

down a Pedestrian/Bike Path on his
bicycle (and I emphasize "Pedestri
an").
In neither case did the clown bother
to apologize, let alone stop to make
sure he hadn't hurt me.
People are keen on touting the bicy
cle as a "great" means of "alternative"
transportation.
For those who complain that the
campus is less than "bicycle friendly,"
I'd suggest a mandatory refresher
course on safety, pedestrian rights,
and sheer courtesy for all University
bicyclists.
Personally, I'd like to see speed
bumps placed liberally along every
path on campus.
I realize that broad generalizations
are often times uncalled for, but if you
observe the bicycle traffic behavior on
campus for a day, especially in crowd
ed pedestrian areas, the only thing
that prevents more bicycle/pedestrian
accidents is the skilled deftness of
those walking.
