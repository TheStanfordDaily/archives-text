# Activists seek support for Cuba
## Bus displayed in White Plaza to protest U.S. embargo 
### Jose Jesus Gutierrez 
The big, yellow bus parked in
White Plaza yesterday has a route
far more interesting than the
average trip to school. In fact, its
schedule includes a stop in Cuba.
Yesterday, Asst. Drama Prof.
Rush Rehm and Sissy Wood —
both representatives of the Free
dom to Travel Campaign —
parked an old school bus in White
Plaza, seeking support for and
informing students about the
third U.S. / Cuba Friendship Car
avan.
The Freedom to Travel Cam
paign works to end the U.S.
embargo and travel ban against
Cuba. The campaign will send 15
school buses — full of supplies
and anxious volunteers — to
Cuba at the end of the month.
The supplies are routed through
Mexico and then shipped to Cuba.
The supplies include comput
ers, bikes, powdered milk, crutch
es, school supplies and Spanish

Bibles.
"It's a shoe-string operation,"
said Rehm.
Wood also said she was sur
prised by the number of students
who were uninformed about the
embargo. "Many didn't know it is
illegal to travel to Cuba," she said.
The Freedom to Travel Cam
paign was started as a protest
against the U.S. government's 33-
year-old economic embargo and
travel ban on Cuba. The campaign
claims the embargo not only causes
Cubans to suffer in poverty-strick
en conditions, but also infringes
upon citizens' right to travel.
"We're trying to change the
embargo. The United States is
keeping [the Cuban people] from
their basic necessities of life,"
Wood said. "And why can't we
travel wherever we want to?"
The group took its first trip in
November 1992, and its second in
August of last year. However, the
trips faced several obstacles
before they delivered the supplies.

The second attempt was seized
by the U.S. government at the
border in Laredo, Tx. There, in
107-degree heaf., it was held for 23
days. To demonstrate their dedi
cation to the cause, 14 of the par
ticipants subsequently went on a
hunger strike. Eventually the bus
was allowed to cross the border
into Mexico.
Although their "illegal" mis
sions succeeded in delivering sup
plies, both Rehm and Wood
agreed that very little progress
has been made. They also com
mented that the Torricelli Bill —
which prevents any U.S. trading
partner from trading with Cuba
— has made it more difficult to
provide Cuba with needed sup
plies.
Rehm said that no country
would choose to trade with Cuba
instead of the United States
because the latter has a lot more
money. In contrast, Cuba has
scarce natural resources and few
trading partners.
