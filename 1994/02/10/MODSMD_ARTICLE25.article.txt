## Men's basketball takes a U-turn in 1993-94 season Cardinal in hunt for NCAA tournament play 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
To most people who follow college bas
ketball even remotely, it seemed highly
unlikely.
Who would have guessed that a team
with a 7-23 overall record in the previous
season and a last-place finish in its con
ference could restore its pride so quickly?
And even more so, who would have
thought that with nine games remaining
on its schedule, this same team would
have a legitimate shot at qualifying for
post-season play?
Most likely, only the members on the
squad itself could have actually known
that such a dramatic recovery was possi
ble.
In a startling one-year turnaround,
the Stanford men's basketball team has
seized the attention of all its disbelievers,
tallying a much more respectable 13-5
win-loss record while sitting comfortably
in a tie for third place in the Pacific 10
Conference. In particular, the Cardinal
has caught the attention of its opponents.
"A lot of teams came in and thought
we weren't going to be that good, espe
cially looking at last year," said sopho
more forward Darren Allaway. "I don't
think we surprised ourselves as much as
we surprised other people in the Pac-10."
Indeed, after reviewing the pre-season
Pac-10 predictions offered by numerous
publications, Stanford's performance
midway through the conference season is
unexpected to say the least.
Street and Smith's picked the Stan
ford squad to finish eighth in the confer
ence, while NCAA Preview figured the
team would end up ninth. Even Playboy
Magazine hopped on the bandwagon,
saying that the Cardinal would wind up
dead last.
But before league play had even
begun, Stanford jumped out to a 7-2 non
conference record, demonstrating in the
process that this year's team would be
head and shoulders above last year's.
The Cardinal knocked off such quality
teams as Santa Clara and Virginia, need

ing only eight games to equal last year's
win total.
And when the team did lose, it was at
the hands of Wisconsin and Seton Hall,
two schools with traditionally strong bas
ketball programs. Both losses happened
on the road, and both games came down
to the wire.
The early-season contests set a posi
tive tone for Stanford which it would
carry into conference play.
"It gave us a certain amount of confi
dence," said coach Mike Montgomery.
"Confidence in terms of our ability to
play at the level of Seton Hall, Wisconsin
and Virginia."
Stanford has enjoyed more of the
same success since the beginning of its
Pac-10 season, off to its best conference
start since the 1988-89 season at 6-3.
The Cardinal has performed impres
sively in defeating Washington State,
USC and in almost dethroning then top
ranked UCLA.
But most of the players would agree
that the highlight so far was upsetting
cross-Bay rival California at Maples
Pavilion Jan. 20, sending a message to all
future opponents that this year's squad
is for real.
"We played really well in the Cal game
here," said senior center Jim Morgan. "I
think we proved to ourselves that we
could play with anybody."
What has changed, enabling Stanford
to re-emerge as a top-notch team?
The personnel.
With the addition of freshman point
guard Brevin Knight, the Cardinal now
boasts a lightning-quick player who
ignites the squad's fast-break offense and
who pesters the opposing team's play
maker all game long. Best of all, he
doesn't play like a college hoops rookie,
according to Montgomery.
"Brevin [has surprised mej from the
standpoint of having the poise to hang in
there," the eighth-year coach said.
"Freshmen sometimes have difficulty
adjusting."
Also, the return of juniors Andy Pop
pink and David Harbour, both of whom

were injured for most of last year, has
given Stanford two players who can score
often and who always hustle.
Defense.
"We've gotten our defensive intensity
up," said sophomore guard Dion Cross.
Indeed, the Cardinal's resilient
defense has stymied the opposition, forc
ing its opponents to commit an average of
17 turnovers each game.
Attitude.
Clearly, team morale is high this year,
and it keeps building with every big win
Stanford pulls off.
"We're a much more confident team
than last year because we know that on
any given night, we can beat anybody,"
Allaway said. "Last year we went into a
routine of getting beat, and then you
don't expect to win."
Home court advantage.
The Cardinal has lost just one game at
home so far. Led by the now famous
Sixth Man Club, the crowd has been par
ticularly frenzied this season, psyching
up the Stanford players and psyching out
their opponent.
"In the past we've had sellouts, but
it's been kind of quiet," Morgan said.
"Now, the opponents fear coming here.
It's a true home-court advantage."
No doubt, the Cardinal's season has
been a tremendously positive experience,
but that's not to say that the squad
hasn't had its lapses.
Against Arizona and Arizona State on
the road, for example, Stanford dug itself
into huge holes, trailing at the halftimes
by 23 points and 18 points, respectively.
"Our Arizona trip was our wake-up
call to start playing better," Cross said.
"Everybody was trying to make plays on
their own."
And hist weekend against Oregon and
Oregon State, the Cardinal almost blew
two double-digit leads in the final min
utes before managing to hold onto the
victories.
"Now it's getting to the serious time
where every game is important, home
and away," Morgan said. "You can't slip
at all. You've got to be ready to play."

Like senior Jim Morgan, shown here against UC-Davis, the Cardinal has gotten the jump
on many opponents this year, racing out to a 13-5 record halfway through the season.
