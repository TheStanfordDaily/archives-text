# Poruri is back!
## Tennis smacks UOP 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
Coach Brennan's forecast
was accurate. It does keep get
ting tougher each meet.
Just not much tougher.
Yesterday the Cardinal
women's tennis team white
washed the University of the
Pacific 7-0, boosting their record
to a perfect 4-0. But the Tigers
(3-3) were able to accomplish
what none of Stanford's first
three victims came close to â€”
challenge the Cardinal's top two
singles players. This unexpected
difficulty satisfied Stanford
head coach Frank Brennan's
prediction that each of these
early-season dual meets will be
more intense than the last.
"It was a good little test,"
Brennan said. "We struggled
some, but that's what makes us
stronger."
The struggles in Stockton
were mostly confined to the top
singles positions. Senior Ail-
Americans Laxmi Poruri and
Kristine Kurth were both chal
lenged by their lesser-known
UOP counterparts.
In Kurth's case, at the No. 2
singles slot, the challenge from
Tiger competitor Leslie O'Keefe
was almost more than she could
handle. Kurth dropped the first
set 7-6 and was losing 4-2 in the
second when she grabbed the
Tiger by the tail, winning four
straight games to snatch the
second set 6-4. She then
squeezed out a 6-4 third set win,
narrowly avoiding her first sin
gles loss of the season.

Poruri needed no such heroics
to nail down her first singles win
in as many tries. But the match
was tighter than expected, as
unheralded Tracee Lee gave
Stanford's captain a racquet-full
of competition in losing 6-4, 7-5.
"She will be a target all year,"
Brennan said of his prized pupil
Poruri, the top-ranked player in
the nation. "Her reputation is
such that no one is really afraid
to play her because they have
nothing to lose. She, on the
other hand, is expected to win.
"fPoruri] was a little tight.
She'll get looser as the season
progresses. She knows what she
needs to do."
The other four singles
matches were less competitive.
In the No. 3 slot, freshman
Katie Shlukebir continued her
dominating ways, spanking
Kanani Galolo 6-2, 6-1. Playing
in front of her hometown fans,
sophomore Beth Berris similar
ly disposed of Julie Radder 6-4,
6-2. The final two singles slots
were much the same, with
freshman Sandra De Silva beat
ing Tanya O'Neil 6-0, 6-1, and
sophomore Wendy Sacks mas
tering Molly White 6-2, 6-1.
In doubles, the biggest win
ner was darkness. Only one
match was completed, with
Poruri/Schlukebir defeating
Lee/O'Neil 7-5, 6-4 at No. 1
doubles. The other two, Kurth/
Emily Burt vs. White/Galolo
and Berris/Sacks vs.
O'Keefe/Radder were called due
to nightfall after a set of play. In
both cases, the first sets went to
the Cardinal.
