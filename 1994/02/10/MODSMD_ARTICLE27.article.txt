their final dual meet of the season last night in
Burnham Pavilion.

and Aggie Matt Santos circled the mat looking

third period.

overtime, Saad won in sudden-death. Saad
yanked his leg out of Santos' hold to score the
winning escape point.
Cardinal Brian Mcßeth wrestled a tight
match against Clint Hunter in the 126 divi

win. Hunter, who is a potential Pacific 10 Con

against Mcßeth in the first period.
The sophomore answered with a two-point
reversal and a takedown, but could not make
up for Hunter's early lead, losing narrowly 8-
6.
The Cardinal went on a huge run of victo

Jimmy Aguirre dominated Davis' Mike Col
