### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
Saving the best for last, the Stanford
wrestlers competed with talent and heart as
they walloped the UC-Davis Aggies, 28-10, in
their final dual meet of the season last night in
Burnham Pavilion.
"It was our best dual meet this season,"
said head coach Chris Horpel. "The team spir
it was better. (The wrestlers] not only wanted
to win for themselves, but for the team."
The Cardinal nabbed an early lead as junior

Ramy Saad began the meet at 118 pounds. He
and Aggie Matt Santos circled the mat looking
for shots but came away with an escape point
each. A stalling point for Saad and advantage
time for Santos tied them up at the end of the
third period.
Still even after two minutes of regulation
overtime, Saad won in sudden-death. Saad
yanked his leg out of Santos' hold to score the
winning escape point.
Cardinal Brian Mcßeth wrestled a tight
match against Clint Hunter in the 126 divi
sion, but was unable to come away with the

win. Hunter, who is a potential Pacific 10 Con
ference placewinner, scored two takedowns
against Mcßeth in the first period.
The sophomore answered with a two-point
reversal and a takedown, but could not make
up for Hunter's early lead, losing narrowly 8-
6.
The Cardinal went on a huge run of victo
ries once the 134 match began. Sophomore
Jimmy Aguirre dominated Davis' Mike Col
lier, winning 12-4. Aguirre led the entire
match, scoring a total of five take
downs while allowing none to his
opponent. This was Aguirre's sec
ond straight dual victory at 134
pounds after wrestling at 142 for
the majority of the season.
Co-captain Jay Jackson did not
wrestle, as Davis unexpectedly for
feited the 142 division. The Cardi
nal had anticipated a forfeit at 150,
but the Aggies gained the privilege
of reacting to Stanford's choice of
wrestlers at this weight because of
a pre-match coin flip. This allowed
them to manipulate a matchup
between Stanford's Ed Medina
and Dat Ngo at 150.
Although he had not expected
to compete, Medina wrestled like
he had planned a victory all week.
He beat Ngo 16-3, racking up a
total of five near falls and a take
down.
"I was pretty slow in the begin
ning, but once I got into it I felt
good," said Medina. Remarkably,
Medina competed at 126 pounds
last Saturday but weighed in at
147 against Davis.

Sophomore Tod Surmon posted
his third dual match victory in a
row with an enormous win over
Jason Mair in the 158 class. Sur
mon began the match with a take
down and three-point near fall and
never slowed down.
"I felt I kept the pressure on the
whole match," said Surmon.
Surmon shut out his hapless
opponent, 15-0, and pushing the
team score up to a 22-3 margin.
Freshman Ryan Barnes and
Aggie Joe Strusinski came out
fighting in the 167 match. Barnes
scored first in the opening period
with a takedown, but Strusinski
responded with two escapes to tie
the match entering the third peri
od.
Both athletes sought a winning
move, but Barnes found it first as
he scored an escape point. Strusin
ski tried to come back, but Barnes
held onto the narrow victory up to
the final seconds. The victory was
especially sweet for Barnes, as he
lost to the Aggie earlier this season
in Stanford's first meet against
Davis.
"My only goal was to compete
and improve. I didn't want to give
up," said Barnes. "[The match]
was too close, but I'll take it."

Although the Cardinal lost the
next two matches, it sported
impressive performances nonethe
less. Freshman Jason Gladden
(177) lost by only a point to Jim
Keck, who took second at the state
championships this past weekend.
"With the momentum behind
him, Jason really made a match
out of it," said Horpel.
At 190 pounds, freshman Chris
Serjak lost to Pat Guire, 20-7.
Guire, who took third place at the
state championships, led the rough
match from the start. He began a
run of takedowns in the second
period that Serjak could not
counter with anything more than
escape points.
The momentum carried right
through the heavyweight class as
freshman Bryan Vaniman beat
Tom Branca, 5-4. Vaniman took
an early lead with a takedown and
a three-point near fall in the first
period. Branca scored a takedown
in the third period, but could not
reverse the lead.
"I'm disappointed, but I've got
to hand it to Stanford," said Aggie
coach Tim Lajcik. "I thought we
had an advantage in some of the
matches, but they performed bet
ter than I expected."
