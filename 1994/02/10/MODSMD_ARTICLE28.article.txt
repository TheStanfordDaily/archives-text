# Men's hoops sets sights on Arizona
## Cardinal hopes to shut down high-scoring Stoudamire, Reeves

All eyes are focused on the Republic State this weekend, as the
Stanford men's basketball team takes on Arizona and Arizona State
in yet another crucial series at Maples Pavilion.
"These are two games that we need to win," said Cardinal guard
David Harbour. "Both of these games are serious for us."
Stanford (13-5 overall, 6-3 in the Pacific 10 Conference) kicks off
the second half of its season locked in a three-way tie for third place
in the Pac-10 with the No. 15 Wildcats (17-4, 6-3) and the Sun Dev
ils (11-7, 6-3). The Cardinal would take sole possession of third with
two wins.
This is easier said than done — Stanford was swamped on the road
by both schools earlier this season, losing 89-72 at Arizona and 78-67
at Arizona State.
In the Arizona game, relentless full-court pressure and a feisty
home crowd overpowered the Cardinal in the first half.
"It's the way [the Wildcatsl play," said guard Dion Cross. "They
press and they make you hurry it up, and you look at the scoreboard,
and you're down by 20."
Actually, the margin was 19 in the teams' first meeting this year
— Stanford fell behind 40-21 in the first half and by as many as 28 in
the second period, before making the game a bit more respectable in
the closing minutes.
Arizona is led by a potential All-America backcourt in Khalid
Reeves and Damon Stoudamire — the two combine to average over
41 points a game.
"As Stoudamire and Reeves go, so goes the team," Cross said.
Things didn't go so smoothly for Arizona last weekend — the 'Cats

fell out of first-place contention with a 74-69 loss to previously-win
less Washington.
Saturday's matchup with the Sun Devils might be even more
important to the Cardinal than tonight's game. While Stanford can
afford to lose to a nationally-ranked school like Arizona, their post
season chances are dependent on beating squads like Arizona State at
