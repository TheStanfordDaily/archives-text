# New liberal student group splits in two
## Members disagree over the organization's focus, plan to pursue separate goals 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
With the recent emergence of Winds of
Freedom, a conservative campus group, liberal
students have struggled to present an orga
nized response. However, the first attempt to
do so, a group called Stanford Students for an
Informed Community, has already split in two
over questions of tactics and focus.
Winds of Freedom, a six-month-old group of
conservative students, faculty and alumni co
sponsored by The Stanford Review, is dedicat
ed to promoting reform in curriculum, Univer
sity policy and student life.
Two weeks ago, about eight student leaders

formed the group "Stanford Students for an
Informed Community" in an effort to combat
conservative influence on campus.
A few members of the group who are also
members of the Stanford Democrats left the
group soon after it was formed and are already
in the process of developing a separate group to
oppose Winds of Freedom.
At issue seems to be what emphasis should
be placed on each of the various causes con
cerning the group. Students for an Informed
Community plans to focus on raising con
sciousness in the Stanford community, while
those alfiliated with the Stanford Democrats
would like to see a more direct attack on the
Winds of Freedom

Members of both groups agree broadly that
Winds of Freedom has too great an influence
on campus politics. "We felt like [the Winds of
Freedom wasl having an effect on the curricu
lum and nobody knew about it," said senior
Rachel Maddow, a member of Stanford Stu
dents for an Informed Community.
Stanford Democrats President Samantha
Halem, who is no longer a member of the new
group, agreed, saying, "I think people would be
very concerned if they found out what the
Winds of Freedom is up to."
These students say they are concerned in
part because they perceive a shift toward con-
servatism in the administration.
"It's changed so much just in the
three to four years I've been
here," said senior Nicole Sanchez,
spokesperson for Stanford Stu
dents for an Informed Communi
ty. "The attempt over past years
to turn Stanford into something
of a model institution has come to
a screeching halt," she added.
The combination of conserva
tive activism and re-evaluation of
all University activities has cul
minated in an "attitude we feel
from high-level administrators to
start steering Stanford back to a
time that doesn't exist any more,"
Sanchez said.
The debate over budget cut
suggestions for the four campus
ethnic centers served as "Roman
candles" that alerted student
group leaders to the shift and cre
ated the "network" that led to the

formation of the new group,
according to Maddow.
"The administration even
thinking that they could threaten
the ethnic centers with budget
cuts" is a sign of the shift toward
conservatism, said Sanchez. The
centers are "so crucial in shaping
the lives of students and faculty
members" that it is "preposter
ous" to consider eliminating
them, she added.
Both groups also agreed on the
need to reach out both to alumni,
who form a large part of the sup
port for campus conservative
activism, and to students who
may be unconcerned by the
changes that seem threatening to
the group, but neither group has
yet formed any specific plans to
meet either of these needs.
The students fear that alumni
are supporting conservative caus
es primarily because of a lack of
information. "Really [alumni]
haven't taken the time to talk to
students, aside from the five peo
ple at The Review," said Sanchez.

Student leaders are concerned
that students may also be unin
formed.
The split between groups came
as a result of a press conference
held by Stanford Students for an
Informed Community last Fri
day. Halem said she was "very
concerned" by what Sanchez said
at the conference and decided to
"take a different tack" in provid
ing a counterweight to conserva
tive sentiment.
Halem said she was particular
ly concerned that Sanchez did not
want her group to focus on oppos
ing the conservative group. "The
greater right-wing shift on cam
pus is secondary" to more con
crete targets, she said. "The way
for us to make an impact is to
fight the Winds of Freedom."
As part of that effort, Halem
and fellow Stanford Democrat
Carl Hampton plan to file to see
the financial information of the
Winds of Freedom under the Free
dom of Information Act next
week.
