With the recent emergence of Winds of
Freedom, a conservative campus group, liberal
students have struggled to present an orga

Winds of Freedom, a six-month-old group of
conservative students, faculty and alumni co
sponsored by The Stanford Review, is dedicat

Two weeks ago, about eight student leaders

formed the group "Stanford Students for an
Informed Community" in an effort to combat
conservative influence on campus.
A few members of the group who are also

those alfiliated with the Stanford Democrats
would like to see a more direct attack on the
Winds of Freedom

Stanford Democrats President Samantha
Halem, who is no longer a member of the new
group, agreed, saying, "I think people would be
very concerned if they found out what the
Winds of Freedom is up to."
These students say they are concerned in
part because they perceive a shift toward con-
