# Women's hoops travels to sunny Arizona
## 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
Its Pacific 10 Conference slate
may already be half-erased, but
the 14th-ranked Cardinal
women's basketball team heads to
the Arizona desert this weekend
still seeking that elusive combina
tion of road mastery and on-court
dominance.
While Stanford (13-5, 6-3 in

the Pac-10) has now blown past
four conference foes at Maples
Pavilion by an average of nearly
30 points, its 2-3 Pac-10 road
mark — which includes losses at
Washington, UCLA and USC and
uninspired victories at California
and Washington State — leaves
the squad in its present third
place predicament searching for
answers.
Yet if the Cardinal's recent his

tory with Arizona and Arizona
State provides any ,clues, those
answers may appear in short
order. The Cardinal simply owns
the Wildcats and Sun Devils, and
could use a pair of wins tonight
and Saturday, respectively, to
grab a share of second place and
set up a stretch drive with five-of
seven games at home.
First, however, comes
tonight's tussle in Tucson, where

sixth-place Arizona (10-7, 4-5)
boasts a mediocre 4-4 record at
the McKale Center this season.
True, the Cardinal tamed the
Wildcats for the 15th consecutive
time with an 87-64 victory at sold
out Maples on Jan. 15, and won
last year's road battle by an easy
79-60 count. But Arizona, which
has received votes in the Associat-
Ed Press poll at various times this
season, has all five of its starters
averaging in double figures and
could pull off the upset if things
go their way early.
Leading the Wildcats' charge
are a pair of senior forwards that
present an "inside-outside"
threat. Shawn Coder, who aver
ages 15.5 points per game and 16
in Pac-10 play, hits three-pointers
at a conference-leading .442 clip;
Kim Conway contributes 14.1
ppg, and leads the Pac-10 in nail
ing a lofty 59.7 percent of her field
goal attempts.
For any excitement tonight's
contest may provide, Saturday
night's Tempe tangle with last

place Arizona State (2-14, 0-8)
should amount to a routine tram
pling. Stanford stampeded by the
Sun Devils 113-61 at Maples on
Jan. 13, and has won 12 of the last
13 meetings, including an 86-76
decision at the Activities Center
last year.
While the Sun Devils place
nobody among the Pac-10's statis
tical leaders in scoring or
rebounding, sophomore point
guard Tamika Matlock stands
third in the conference with 5.6
assists per game. Senior forward
Nikki Thompson, ASU's leading
scorer with 15.1 ppg, also leads
the Pac-10 in steals with nearly
four per contest.
Both tonight's and Saturday's
action begin at 6 p.m. and may be
