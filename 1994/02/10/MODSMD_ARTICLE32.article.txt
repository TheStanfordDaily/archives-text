# Tumblers ready to roll in first dual meet

### Sam Wu Staff writer 
Stanford's two-time defending
national champion men's gym
nastics team will host its first
dual meet of the season against
Brigham Young and UC-Santa
Barbara tomorrow night in
Maples Pavilion. The Cardinal
men will join their female coun
terparts in co-ed competition this
Valentine weekend, but they will

be making war, not love, on the
Gauchos and current Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation-leading
Cougars.
"I know the BYU coach and his
philosophies," said Cardinal head
coach Sadao Hamada. "BYU is
trying to qualify for NCAA
regionals, so they must post high
scores. They're going to go hard
on everything and come after us."
After a three-week break from
formal competition, the Stanford

gymnasts are equally ready to
light up the scoreboard. In fact,
the Cardinal hopes to capture at
least 282 points out of 300 for the
meet.
Should the Cardinal obtain
such a score, Hamada expects
Stanford to beat the Cougars, by
far the more talented of the two
visiting squads. Last year, the
Cardinal split victories with BYU.
However, Hamada expects a Stan
ford victory this Friday.

"BYU's got tough kids, but not
great depth," Hamada said.
"They've got three or four good
gymnasts who can score as high
as 9.80 on their routines. But
after that, the quality of gym
nasts falls by a lot, and they'll get
scores around the 9.10-9.20 area.
Those scores just aren't good
enough to compete at the NCAA
level."
Victory is not the msyor con
cern for the Cardinal, however.
According to Hamada, the team
would like to gauge its progress
since the beginning of the year by
the scores in this meet.
"I'm not worried about win
ning or losing," Hamada said.
"The importance is the score. A
loss to BYU won't matter because
we know, once we peak, we'll beat
them anytime."
For the past two weeks, the
Cardinal has worked on improv
ing the consistency, execution and
quality of their routines, Hamada
said. Consistency was a primary
focus because there were a signifi
cant number of missed routines in
Stanford's U.S. Winter Cup Qual
ifier, an inter-squad event two
weeks ago. Another area of partic
ular concern is ring routines.
"Our rings aren't strong
enough," Hamada said. "There's

not much progress in that area.
I've asked the guys to come in for
an hour in the morning to get
stronger quicker."
Currently, sophomore Peter
Hegi and juniors Jing-Wei Liang
and Josh Stein lead the way for
the Cardinal on rings.
"I feel much stronger than I
was three weeks ago," Hegi said
about his ring routine. "I've been
working on my dismount and just
cleaning up my routine. I still
need to get stronger, though. I've
also worked on strength sequence
so I won't get tired for events
after rings. This weekend will be a
good chance to see how much I've
progressed."
Tomorrow's dual meet at 7:30
p.m. will be the final testing peri
od for a team determined to
become three-peat national cham
pions.
"The [season opener] Spartan
Open was just to test new rou
tines and early season health and
strength," Hamada said. "Start
ing right now, you get a better
idea of where the team is."
