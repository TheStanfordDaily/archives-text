# Tumblers ready to roll in first dual meet

### Sam Wu Staff writer 
Stanford's two-time defending
national champion men's gym
nastics team will host its first
dual meet of the season against
Brigham Young and UC-Santa
Barbara tomorrow night in
Maples Pavilion. The Cardinal
men will join their female coun
terparts in co-ed competition this
Valentine weekend, but they will

be making war, not love, on the
Gauchos and current Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation-leading
Cougars.
"I know the BYU coach and his
philosophies," said Cardinal head
coach Sadao Hamada. "BYU is
trying to qualify for NCAA
regionals, so they must post high
scores. They're going to go hard
on everything and come after us."
After a three-week break from
formal competition, the Stanford

gymnasts are equally ready to
light up the scoreboard. In fact,
the Cardinal hopes to capture at
least 282 points out of 300 for the
meet.
Should the Cardinal obtain
such a score, Hamada expects
Stanford to beat the Cougars, by
far the more talented of the two
visiting squads. Last year, the
Cardinal split victories with BYU.
However, Hamada expects a Stan
ford victory this Friday.

"BYU's got tough kids, but not
great depth," Hamada said.
"They've got three or four good
gymnasts who can score as high
as 9.80 on their routines. But
after that, the quality of gym
nasts falls by a lot, and they'll get
scores around the 9.10-9.20 area.
Those scores just aren't good
enough to compete at the NCAA
level."
