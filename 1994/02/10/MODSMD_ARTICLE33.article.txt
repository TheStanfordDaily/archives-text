# Women's gymnastics to face BYU, UCSB
## 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
This Friday's gymnastics meet should be one of the most
enthralling of the season as both the women's and men's teams
will be competing against Brigham Young University and UC-
Santa Barbara at 7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
"It should be really exciting to watch the strength and power
the men exude compared with the women's gymnastics, which is
more of a show for the audience," said Cardinal women's assistant
coach Lisa Mitzel-Izzi. "The women have very exciting tricks as
well, but their routines are more creative because of the dance
moves they can incorporate on two events (beam and floor)."
For this dual meet, the coaches have been pushing harder
workouts and have added some new skills to the gymnasts' rou
tines, which they hope will improve performance as well as scores.
The vault lineup is as yet undecided. Freshman Katie Jennings,
though definitely competing in the other three events, may not do
vault, in which case Linda Chun would fill in. Hillary Anderson,
another usual all-arounder, will just be competing bars and beam
because of a sore ankle.
Jenny Ward will be on the floor lineup this week, in place of
Anderson. Tina Snowden has
added a front tuck to her first
tumbling pass, which, if execut
ed, will add 2/10 to her score,
and Meegan Lannin is working
on changing her single full to a
double full in her last pass.
The Stanford team looks for
ward to the return of senior
Laurie West on the uneven
bars, who has an injured ankle.
Greenwood said she has been
working hard to rehabilitate,
and once she is able to perform
on the vault and floor as well,
should increase the team's over
all score by at least a point.
Although Stanford's women's
team did not meet with the BYU
Cougars last season, it has con
sistently defeated the Santa Bar
bara Gauchos. However, Santa

Barbara recently won a meet
against the California Golden
Bears, whom Stanford lost to by
less than a point last week.
"We are still in really early
season form," said BYU head
coach Brad Cattermole. "But we
have had moments of brilliance
on each event, and just need to
do what we are capable of at Fri
day's meet."
The highest-scoring Cougar
in the all-around is Cassie
Pauga. Leading BYU's team on
vault are Nanette Walker and
Christy Miles. Other Brigham
Young gymnasts to watch for are
U.S. National Team members
Liz Crandall, the top bar worker,
and Juliette Bangerter, who
excels on the uneven bars, beam
and floor.
Cattermole said BYU is look
ing forward to competing against
Stanford Friday. "We consider
[Stanford] to be one of the best
teams out there," he said.
