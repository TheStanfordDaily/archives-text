The long-awaited plan to
allow students to use Tresid
der Dollars to order pizza from
Domino's is expected go into
effect next week after a series
of delays.
Originally scheduled to
begin on Jan. 3, the plan was
postponed because of a delay
in the arrival of the equipment
needed to process the meal
cards and a printer to print
receipts for students.
The plan — first proposed
in November — calls for local
Domino's owner David Midlik
to accept Tresidder dollars for
pizza deliveries to the Stan
ford campus. Domino's will
pay Tresidder a monthly lease
of about $100 for use of the
equipment, and Tresidder will
also receive a small percentage
of the profits in order to pay
for the equipment's operation.

The plan was considered to
be one of former Tresidder
Union Assoc. Director Paul
Szczesiul's many projects,
according to Tresidder Direc
tor Roberta Braden.
Since his resignation two
weeks ago, many people on the
staff have had to share his
numerous responsibilities,
contributing to some sluggish
ness in completing projects.
According to Braden, the
card-reading equipment was
ordered well before Christmas
but was not installed by the
University until last week.
She said the delay was due
mainly to the fact that the Uni
versity receives many requests
for equipment installation
throughout the campus, and
that Tresidder basically had to
"wait their turn."
"I've been very anxious to
start this program," Midlik
said.
