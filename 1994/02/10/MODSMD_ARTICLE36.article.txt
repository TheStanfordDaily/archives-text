Women's Volleyball
Comprising "the nation's
best" recruiting class as labeled
by Volleyball Magazine, four
future Cardinal players signed on
with the women's volleyball team
last week.
"We signed every player we
went after," said coach Don
Shaw. "It's an extremely talented
class, one that will really raise our
level of athleticism."
Considered the nation's top
volleyball recruit, 6-2 outside hit
ter Kristin Folkl will arrive on the
Farm from St. Joseph's Academy
in St Louis, Mo. Not only the
nation's hottest volleyball
recruit, Folkl has also signed on
to play basketball at Stanford.
Kaineohe, Hawaii native Deb
bie Lambert will accompany Folkl
in the outside hitter position. The
6-0 volleyball and track Player of
the Year for Hawaii will carry on
a family tradition, joining her
brother Mike, a swing hitter on
the men's team.
Named the "top volleyball
recruit in Canada" by the Toronto
Star, 6-2 middle blocker Barbara
Ifejika should strengthen the Car
dinal's inside net game. Ifejika
was captain of her Mayfield Sec

ondary School team in Brampton,
Ontario and also played on the
Canadian Junior National Team.
Rounding off the list is local
product Lisa Sharpley, a 6-0 set
ter whose play on the Los Altos
High School team earned her two
All-American titles. "As good of
setting prospect as we've ever
had," according to Shaw, Sharp
ley should also provide the Cardi
nal with hitting and blocking
strength.
