We're all feeling simply lovely.
Lovely thoughts for a lovely occa
sion by a lovely writer for her
lovely readers, all quite lovely lovely lovely,
of course. As the holiday honoring Saint
Valentine thus fast approaches, rendering
us all so lov-ed and lover-ly, I have this sud
den urgent compulsion to say...
I don't know. There's just something about
you— I feel like I can tell you anything.
And you know those aren't just some
gooey words I heard in a chick flick. Those
feelings are, like, from the heart.
But that's just lovely, you know, if you're
like that Christian Slater from "Untamed
Heart," and I'm like Marisa Tomei even
though you're like not a busboy, and I'm like
not really a waitress, our situations are exact
ly the same except for that one thing and the
fact that it was a movie and the guy had a ba
boon heart, but still it's like Marisa said:
I'm going to give you my heart... and it's
okay, you don't have to give me yours back.
I have to confess though, I say this only
because I know what's in your greedy little
co-dependent emotional blood-sucker.
You know you want it bad.

You're itching to escape the harsh reality
of a chilly and solitary winter quarter to the
amnesiac dream of love love love love love
love, fully twice the size of Sandra Bern
hard's vision and equal to all the "Ghosts,"
"Dirty Dancings," and "Singles" of filmdom,
though I think the Seattle grunge scene is
considered by modish ones as slightly pass£.
You beautiful overachiever, you.
Everything has to be so perfect that love is
a many-splendored and hidden thing here at
Stanford. That Julia Roberts-Richard Gere
thing? It ain't gonna happen. You know in
real life he probably beat her up, dumped her
and gave her just half the dough he promised.
And they weren't anywhere near as neurotic
and insecure as your peers. Give it up.
Tell me the truth, darling.
You envy Michael Bolton. Not for his
lungs of steel bars and the voice to match.
Not even for the woolly mane that'd put a
sheep to shame. One envies Michael because

he is a sensitive man of the '90s who s not
afraid to be hurt and show it. And this is
something one feels because one can hear it
in every damn song.
Speaking of painful songs:
The flowers that you sent me have all died
away... / Could'vebeen so beautiful, could've
been so right / I think about what could've
been on a cold and lonely night.
—former teen queen Tiffany
"What could've been"— I think she's
talking about regret. How profound. How
lovely. But what to do this weekend?
For myself, dear heart, I look for inspira
tion to the words of the poor and perfect
Wesley of "The Princess Bride."
That pains you, your highness? Life is pain.
If this is so, and you have some lovely
strength of soul, a penchant for emotional
sadomasochism, a taste for brilliant movies,
and you're not afraid to introduce a little un
loveliness into your Valentine weekend, grab

your honey and go see "Farewell My Concu
bine." This is life in high art that will stick to
your gut and rip out your heart. While this
may not seem very attractive, at least you'll
remember it. And can you really truly incon
testably say that about lovely things?
I think not.
I don't mean to sound bleak, sugar lumps,
but didn't you know there are people who
dress in black for the occasion?
Truth be told, if you're feeling something
other than apathy for the day of the red and
the pink, expressing enthusiasm rather than
the accepted funereal demeanor, you're
probably chafing nerves. Get a grip and go
eat a grapefruit or something. Geez.
I'll admit it. I fell for "Untamed Heart"
hook, line and sinker. I thought "Flirting,"
an Australian film about curious boarding
school kids, was precious. But, naked cheru
bim with arrows and a day best described as
Mariah Carey-like give me the willies.
So no matter how lovely your mental
state this weekend, remember that "Today is
the greatest day I've ever known." Words to
live by from the beauteous Billy Corgan.
Cupid can bite me. ■
