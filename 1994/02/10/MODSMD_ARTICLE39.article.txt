# The
						Grays Like a 'good bike accident'
## 
### Michael G. Nichols 
you won't hear someone ask you, "Hey,
play that song by the Grays," because if
they did, you'd have to ask which one.
Why? Because the Grays are no one-hit-won
der. While their forthcoming album "Ro Sham
Bo" is packed with songs that are definite
radio-play material, each track is different,
making a solid musical statement all its own.
What's more, while some tracks like "The Very
Best Years" stand out on the release, they are all
good.
But what do the Grays sound like? How can
they be streamlined? In a word, traditional.
That's right, just good traditional rock. But
what does that mean? They're not pop, and
their not grunge, but somewhere in between.
They have a clean, very musical and melodic
sound that is at times reminiscent of the Beat
les or Elvis Costello, two bands the members of
the group "are always listening to," according
to vocalist, guitarist, keyboardist and bassist
Jon Brion. They don't put too much faith in
such comparisons. "The Beatles are more like
a genre of music than a particular style," said
Brion. "If you play melodic rock music with
guitars, you're Beatle-influenced."
But they are not working to remake anyone
else's music. The Grays are here to play what
they know best, their own breed of well round
ed, musical rock that is neither generically ag
gressive or painfully slow.
Caught in the middle
The spot that Brion, Jason Falkner (vocals,
guitars, keyboards and bass), Buddy Judge
(vocals and guitars) and Dan McCarroll
(drums) occupy, somewhere between stylistic
extremes, is a spot many bands seem to have
abandoned. Most new groups today seem to
write either one good song on an album that
all their other tracks sound like, or that none of
the other tracks even vaguely resemble.
Neither is true with the Grays. Part of their
strength comes from the fact that they have
liberally-defined roles. The unique and varied
sound they achieve comes from the fact that
they have three singer / songwriters. Brion,
Falkner and Judge all write alone, and then the
band puts the pieces together.
"It's like three records for the price of one,"
said McCarroll.
The unique fact that they do not define one
vocalist, guitarist, keyboardist or bassist also
helps keep them varied. Each songwriter per
forms his own piece after the band comes to a
consensus on the works they all like. In the
spirit of identity confusion, Brion said, "I
wouldn't say it's not the case that we weren't
not singing the songs that perhaps weren't
written by none of us."
Although each writes his own music, the
sounds on "Ro Sham Bo" are not disparate be
cause the Grays still work as a band. According
to Brion, their style evolved naturally and
without a conscious effort, "we automatically

started picking songs with
common ground... there are
particular things we like
about each others songs that
had a little of that cohesive
ness."
Cohesive the Grays are.
The first three tracks on "Ro
Sham Bo," three of the best
songs on the album, flow to
gether seamlessly. The whole
album, in fact, works together
to create a compilation of new
music that will be appealing

to a wide audience. What makes the music
most attractive is what it does not do to alien
ate, as much as it does to attract. In short, the
elements of each song have their place, and
fere's nothing added on to appeal to any sort
of crowd. We're talking low-cal music here,
with no additives, preservatives, or artificial
flavors.
All of this goes together to produce a very
danceable, very listenable style that has a
strange effect. One of its most notable traits is
the sudden familiarity of the songs. After a few
listens, tracks like "Same Thing" sound like the
voice of an old friend, like a tune you've been
listening to for years.
Though f his skill is something many bands
strive for, the Grays actually aren't sure how
they accomplished it. "You just try and write
things you think are pleasing to you ... and
our sensibility is melodic in the first place" ac
cording to Brion.
Judge agreed. "You can't set out to have fa
miliarity." But somehow, it's done anyway —
and done well.

The Grays have had a unique opportunity
to play and record as a band. All members of
former bands, including one member of Jelly
fish, the Grays are not new kids on the music
block. In fact, they had all quit the bands they
were in when they got together not to become
a group — just to jam.
And then it happened.
Unique, through and through
Coming together as a band was like "a good
bike accident," said McCarroll.
"We jammed one time," he said. "A mutual
friend who was outside the door made a
phone call and we started getting phone calls
the next day."
Incredible but true. A short six months
after grouping up, the Grays were in the stu
dio, making one of the finest new albums on
the music scene today.
From start to finish, the creation of "Ro
Sham Bo" was unique. Birthed from a jam ses
sion, the new band did not record their songs
and send them out to their newly interested

public. Instead, they set up live showcases for
interested labels. Filtering out the romancers
from the serious dancers, they "refused to
make demos for anybody... so that we didn't
have to then re-record songs when it was time
to make a record ... and so that they had to
come down and see the live show. There were
no pictures, the band had no name, the band
had no management" said Brion.
Not often does a group get away with es
tablishing their own set of rules for an indus
try that has people lined up outside its doors.
But, then again, the Grays are not your ordi
nary group. McCarroll playfully told me "to
hold on to this interview tape, because the
boys at Epic tell us we're going to be big."
I'm not so sure they're wrong. The Grays
don't have a commercial enough sound to be
headlining arenas in the near future, but then
again after the release of "Ro Sham Bo" they
won't be playing in the Coffee House any
more.
The band members are a little less sure of
the likelihood of success. Knowing what the
music world is like, the Grays don't have big
expectations for their first days as a band. But
this feeling comes from modesty and not any
lack of talent. Expect little and keep a good at
titude — this seems to be their mind set.
Falkner said jokingly that they only want "the
audience to outnumber the band on as many
occasions as possible." Continuing the
thought he adds, "If people stop playing pool
to watch a band, that's a good sign."
With tracks like "Both Belong," "Very Best
Years" and "All You Wanted," that shouldn't be
a problem.
Cool attitude
Perhaps the approach the Grays take to
music is what helps make them so good. This
was some common sense and a lot of experi
ence. Though none of The Grays quit music
before they joined together, they did quit their
former groups because, as McCarroll said,
"Bands are being married to three other peo
ple, and they're not even women." Despite this
belief, they have wed the work of three writers
and four musicians into one album. From
their past they took not so much an influence
but a knowledge of "how not to do things...
politically and personally," according to Judge.
One of the Grays' strengths is doing things
personally. For instance, they don't try to cre
ate an unnatural persona or aura about them.
The meaning behind their music is not mes
sage-oriented, but rather experience-oriented.
"There was no meeting where we sat down
and wrote a manifesto," said Brion. Rather,
their lyrics do come from the heart. In their
many songs about love — or lack there of—
for instance, the Grays don't follow any sort of
formula. They don't sing stories of love, but
stories of life. "I'm not very good at fiction,"
admitted Judge. The other members agree,

saying the songs come from
real personal experience.
Whether you had the expe
rience of seeing the Grays live
at the Coffee House or not,
plan on hearing their timeless
rock on the debut "Ro Sham
Bo." Besides, Stanford has a
special connection with the
band. Both of Falkner's "par
ents went here and met here...
so without Stanford [he]
wouldn't be here, and the
Grays wouldn't exist." ■
