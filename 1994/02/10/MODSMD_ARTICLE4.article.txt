While the fight for an Asian American Studies
program continues, Stanford staff member Karl
Knapper discussed a fledgling movement to de
velop a similar program in lesbian and gay studies
at a lunch-time lecture yesterday.
Knapper, a program administrator for the
Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project, suggested
a "two-pronged, interrelated approach" for estab

Knapper said that although it would be nice if
a wealthy alumnus donated a couple million dol

this would be unlikely unless research and course
development were taking place.

told the audience of about 50 at Tresidder Union.
"In this time of tight finances, I know it won't be
easy to institute a lesbian and gay studies pro
gram," he said.
"Course development to create an academical
ly rigorous and sustainable program in lesbian
and gay studies" is the second step in Knapper's
plan. And this would require a core group of fac

a program cannot happen without the interest
and support of faculty."
Ideally, a faculty colloquium, as well as a lec
ture series, would allow professors to share their
research and develop new courses, he added.
Stanford presently offers only a handful of
courses dealing with lesbian and gay studies â€”
not enough for a major in the discipline.
A group of staff, faculty and alumni are brain-
