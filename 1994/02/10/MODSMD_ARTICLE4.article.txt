# Speaker says Stanford should include gay and lesbian studies
## 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
While the fight for an Asian American Studies
program continues, Stanford staff member Karl
Knapper discussed a fledgling movement to de
velop a similar program in lesbian and gay studies
at a lunch-time lecture yesterday.
Knapper, a program administrator for the
Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project, suggested
a "two-pronged, interrelated approach" for estab
lishing such a program at Stanford.
Knapper said that although it would be nice if
a wealthy alumnus donated a couple million dol
lars to start a lesbian and gay studies program,
this would be unlikely unless research and course
development were taking place.
"When it comes to establishing a lesbian and
gay studies program at Stanford, I'm a pragma
tist, not an idealist," said Knapper who was a
member of the national steering committee for
the 1993 March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Equal Rights and Liberation.
Practically speaking, the first step is "fund
raising to find the resources to develop and sus
tain a lesbian and gay studies program," Knapper
told the audience of about 50 at Tresidder Union.
"In this time of tight finances, I know it won't be
easy to institute a lesbian and gay studies pro
gram," he said.
"Course development to create an academical
ly rigorous and sustainable program in lesbian
and gay studies" is the second step in Knapper's
plan. And this would require a core group of fac
ulty to lay the groundwork, he said. "Establishing
a program cannot happen without the interest
and support of faculty."
Ideally, a faculty colloquium, as well as a lec
ture series, would allow professors to share their
research and develop new courses, he added.
Stanford presently offers only a handful of
courses dealing with lesbian and gay studies —
not enough for a major in the discipline.
A group of staff, faculty and alumni are brain-
storming ways to implement a
lesbian and gay studies program,
Knapper said.
Reiterating the importance of
fundraising, he pointed to Har
vard and Yale as leaders in the
area of lesbian and gay studies,
saying that those universities
"have developed resources to
support continued scholarship in
the area of lesbian and gay stud
ies.
"I do not see why we can not
follow their example and do the
same thing," he added. "The Bay
Area is a hotbed of research in
lesbian and gay studies, and I
think we should take advantage
of that."
Knapper also stressed the
importance of learning from
other interdisciplinary programs
such as feminist studies. "Femi
nist studies took a long time to

get off the ground," Knapper
said. "I don't think that any of
these things will happen
overnight."
After Knapper's presentation,
he answered a few questions,
including an inquiry about how
graduate students can become
involved in the establishment of
a program.
"Graduate students are inte
gral to what's going on," Knap
per said. However, many gradu
ate students have difficulty
researching lesbian and gay
issues because some professors
don't consider it to be a "serious"
subject, he said.
When one student expressed
concern about discrimination
against lesbians and gays on cam
pus, Knapper pointed out the
necessity of having "a gay- friend
ly environment on campus" in
order to create a program.
"Just because things aren't
perfect now doesn't mean we
can't work to make it better," he
said.
