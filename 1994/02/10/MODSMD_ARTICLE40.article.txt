KJkM Hoop Players performance of
W Diderot's "Rameau's Nephew"
musing on the nature of mediocrity or re
structuring your personal stance towards
self-denegration, you will not forget Jose
"Paco" Farias simulating the universal bath
room activity — what his character affec
tionately calls "Oh, priceless shit!" It is the al
most constant flood of beautifully crafted
comic dialogues which makes this produc
tion a delight to watch.
The play is performed by seniors Zander
Teller and Farias and directed by Winter
Mead, visiting lecturer in drama and the
founder of the Red Hoop Players. The same
team staged Fdward Albee's "The Zoo Story"
last year, and Teller and Farias have acted to
gether in a number of productions, including
"Macbeth" and "Cloud Nine." All three of
them see major advantages to working with
the same people in a number of projects.
Teamwork works
Farias remarks that: "Winter can look at
something we did and say: 'God, that
sucked!"' Both Farias and Teller stress the
importance of their all being longstanding
friends.
"We had such a good time doing the first
production ... so this time the doing some
thing together came before the play itself," he
said.
This familiarity allows the three-man
team to work at their own pace. Farias de
scribes Mead's directing style as "Fly by the
seat of our pants." Mead prefers to "let the
play develop."
But the end result is anything but haphaz
ard. Mead began directing by doing some
careful research with the actors, to give them

a sense of the time in which they are acting.

Farias and Teller suit their respective
parts. Taking nothing away from either

of their careful characterizations, their
physical attributes enhance the pro
duction. The taller Teller in his ele
gant philosopher's robes combined

with the more compact and swarthy
looking Farias create an engaging

spectacle right from the outset.
Bum vs. the Philosopher
Farias plays Rameau, the
nephew of a successful and highly
acclaimed composer and musician
also named Rameau. However,
Rameau the nephew is a bum, a so
cial scrounger of epic proportions
who uses his fast wit and apparent
lack of moral scruples to keep him-

self fed.
"My charactcr is a genius but he's unrec
ognized," Farias said.
The stage dialogue is between him and
Teller's character, a philosopher whose name
we do not learn. The audience begins the play
feeling very much as if it is in the philoso
pher's position because he introduces
Rameau and comments on his actions. But as
the play progresses our empathy is drawn by
Rameau and we begin to look more critically
at the philosopher's aloof hypocrisy.
Teller's philosopher is not a straight man
any more than Rameau is a one-dimensional
clown. His relative silence punctuated by
comments is patronizing. He sees his profes
sion as being uniquely free from false

posturing. He seems to sympathize
with Rameau's plight, but he fails to

see his own mediocrity. When he dc
mands to know what use Rameau's
brilliant feigned coughing may be
put to, we want to know what use his

musings may be put to.
The comedy derives primarily
from Rameau's frantic

rantings. We are

swept along in
a torrent of
paradoxical
observations,
which re
quires Farias
to sustain
frantic energy
for the entire

perfor
mance.
A s

Mead observes, the sheer volume of words
that Rameau pours out at terrific speed is a
challenge in itself.

The very eloquence of
Rameau's self-denegra
tion hints at someone
who has considerable in-

sight. The audience
must sympathize with

Rameau as a human
rather than simply
look and laugh at
him like a clown.

It was his keen
ness of vision

about the
tran
sient

social status of his employers that caused his
dismissal. We come to see a man, who, how
ever amusing he may be, can see what he is
and wants (and probably deserves) is some
thing different. Accordingly, we are truly
touched by his tormented repetition of the
phrase: "I'm waiting, no one's coming."
Asking for a move
Mead's confidence in his acting duo shows
in the staging. There is basically nothing on
stage. The two characters move freely about
in an open space with checkered, chess
board-like tiling.
Mead describes the chess game metaphor
as "The single most important metaphor in
the entire play." He had his actors play a
game of chess during a run-through. Each
time a question was asked a new move could
be taken.
Farias won the first-act game when the
quick-fire questions resulted in a game of
speed chess, while Teller was able to triumph
in the more considered, strategic game of the
second act. The results influenced the way
the actors thought about their respective
gains and losses in the verbal chess match of
the play.
"If the games had come out differently, we
might have ended up with a totally different
play," Teller points out.
It is during the more emotionally charged
parts of the play that the ability of the two ac
tors really shows. The production can be
seen for what it is — not just a declaimed
philosophical dialogue, but an involving,
carefully directed and thoughtful look at two
humans who have much more in common
than is apparent at first sight.
Even if they don't see eye-to-eye on bath
room rhetoric.

Nephew," starting Wednesday, Feb. 9 through
Saturday, Feb. 12 at the Eleanor Prosser Studio
in Memorial Hall. Performances start at Bp. m.
