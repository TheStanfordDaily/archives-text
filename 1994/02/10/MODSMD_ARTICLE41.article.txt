# [...how's that for exploitation?]

I have many apprehensions about writing
an article on raves, namely because I like to
rave .... I enjoy the whole 'scene' and yet
here I am writing an article in a newspaper
geared toward an audience outside the sub
cultural circle. More than likely, I am con
tributing to the appropriation of a sub-cul
ture which prides itself on separation from
mass culture. And most importantly, I am
contributing to its death.
The rave scene in the Bay Area dates back
a few years. I don't know the exact date nor
the first rave, but I will go so far as to say that
ravers were around, at the latest, by 1989.
Originating in Manchester, England during
the mid-eighties (where the disaffected
youth truly have something to be disaffected
about), the rave scene transplanted itself
into the Los Angeles area.
With the effort in England to stem the
popularity of raves (where Parliament tried
to restrict rave events to which literally tens
of thousands of Generation X-ers went every
weekend, where techno was top-forty and
where an estimated 500,000 were regular Ec
stasy users), rave promoters turned west
ward to establish new headquarters.
In Los Angeles, first, then up to San Fran
cisco, and now in virtually every part of the
country, raves have spread from coast to
coast. This infiltration sends a code blue the
pigs and our parents who groan, "Please
don't let it be another one of those damn
youth uprisings."
So that's where the idea of rave came
from. But raves are undefinable. It's impos
sible to do a composite raver sketch. (Some
of you old skoolers or non-believers out
there may beg to differ. However, while it
may be true that most ravers are white, male,
between the ages of 17 and 24, wear

skater/grunge/seven
ties-style, believe me,
there's more diversity out
there than you know).

Unfortunately, mass media
has pigeonholed ravers and
when Twentieth Century Fox
comes out with the '90s version
of "Breakin'," white gloves,
backpacks, water bottles, whis
tles, Vicks vapor rub, trip

toys, Heidi braids, plat
form sneakers, Fresh
Jive wear and plenty

more 'sym
bols' of
raver iden-

tity will invade the
screen.
Thus far,

Newsweek has called
the rave movement a
return to infantilism
... "48 Hours" warns all

concerned parents in the
Bay Area that 70 percent to
80 percent of kids going to

raves on weekends are taking l
ecstasy ... let's see who else has
spewed .... Time magazine
thinks we combine hippie ideal
ism with technological know-how
(and that we subsequently think
Billy Idol's latest cyberpunk look is

phresh)... The New York Times asserts

that techno is just an extension of the "Nin

tendo Age" ... et cetera et cetera et
cetera.
Whatever — as if any of this were
true. I admit there was a point in time
when the rave scene had its heyday in
the Bay Area, when there was a real
sense that ravers were unified and

that as a subculture, we
were going to make an

impact. But now, as
is characteristic

of all sub-cultur
al movements, rave
is dead.
Not that no one
raves anymore.
Plenty of evidence
of the growing pop
ularity of raving ex
ists: rave hotlines
published in Bay
Area weekly readers,
sales of overalls at
their greatest ever, a
younger, high

school crowd raving
each weekend which
obviously does not
mind shelling out 20
duckets (or more, de-

pending on your dependencies),
Live 105's broadcast of the latest
cyberpunk techno favorites and even
Stanford's own 'X' parties on the row.

In light of all this, by stating "rave is dead"
1 mean that the word "rave" connotes some
thing so subjective that it's impossible to
pinpoint or articulate. It means too many
things to too many different people. Some
ravers really believe in a spiritual dimension
inherent to the rave experience.
Others feel that raves are purely hedonist
and can't be fun without some sort of drug.
Yet others advocate the view printed on a
flier handed out at a community rave last
March: "Rave culture is the new world order

We are dancing to make the world a
better place. We demonstrate trust and
the ability to 'all get along.' We are re
connecting with our natural world and
re-establishing our multi-racial family.
.. [t]his is our vision: we must... dis-

solve the boundaries our culture has sanc
tioned."
Personally, the attraction of raving stems
from the fact that 1 love dancing and raves
provide the most incredible opportunity for
people to grind or groove as crazily as they
desire. But trying to describe to you the 'en
ergy' I feel when dancing with a couple thou
sand people all high on life or drugs or both
and how this trips me out and blows my
mind is like trying to translate one language
to another. Something gets lost in the
process of putting this experience of dance
into words.
In addition to the ways in which ravers
describe themselves and the rave experience,
the perceptions of non-ravers impact the
whole scene. Ravers no longer solely exist for
themselves, they must contend with the la
bels and identities cast upon them by the
parent culture which recognizes its exis
tence.
Think about it — who's in charge of what
