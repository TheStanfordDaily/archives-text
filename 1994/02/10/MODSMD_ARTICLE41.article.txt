I have many apprehensions about writing
an article on raves, namely because I like to
rave .... I enjoy the whole 'scene' and yet
here I am writing an article in a newspaper
geared toward an audience outside the sub
cultural circle. More than likely, I am con
tributing to the appropriation of a sub-cul
ture which prides itself on separation from
mass culture. And most importantly, I am
contributing to its death.
The rave scene in the Bay Area dates back
a few years. I don't know the exact date nor
the first rave, but I will go so far as to say that
ravers were around, at the latest, by 1989.
Originating in Manchester, England during
the mid-eighties (where the disaffected
youth truly have something to be disaffected
about), the rave scene transplanted itself
into the Los Angeles area.
With the effort in England to stem the
popularity of raves (where Parliament tried
to restrict rave events to which literally tens
of thousands of Generation X-ers went every
weekend, where techno was top-forty and
where an estimated 500,000 were regular Ec
stasy users), rave promoters turned west
ward to establish new headquarters.
In Los Angeles, first, then up to San Fran
cisco, and now in virtually every part of the
country, raves have spread from coast to
coast. This infiltration sends a code blue the
pigs and our parents who groan, "Please
don't let it be another one of those damn
youth uprisings."
So that's where the idea of rave came
from. But raves are undefinable. It's impos
sible to do a composite raver sketch. (Some
of you old skoolers or non-believers out
there may beg to differ. However, while it
may be true that most ravers are white, male,
between the ages of 17 and 24, wear

skater/grunge/seven
ties-style, believe me,
there's more diversity out
there than you know).

Unfortunately, mass media
has pigeonholed ravers and
when Twentieth Century Fox
comes out with the '90s version
of "Breakin'," white gloves,
backpacks, water bottles, whis
tles, Vicks vapor rub, trip

toys, Heidi braids, plat
form sneakers, Fresh
Jive wear and plenty

more 'sym
bols' of
raver iden-

tity will invade the
screen.
Thus far,

Newsweek has called
the rave movement a
return to infantilism
... "48 Hours" warns all

concerned parents in the
Bay Area that 70 percent to
80 percent of kids going to

raves on weekends are taking l
ecstasy ... let's see who else has
spewed .... Time magazine
thinks we combine hippie ideal
ism with technological know-how
(and that we subsequently think
Billy Idol's latest cyberpunk look is

phresh)... The New York Times asserts

that techno is just an extension of the "Nin

tendo Age" ... et cetera et cetera et
cetera.
Whatever — as if any of this were
true. I admit there was a point in time
when the rave scene had its heyday in
the Bay Area, when there was a real
sense that ravers were unified and

that as a subculture, we
were going to make an

impact. But now, as
is characteristic

of all sub-cultur
al movements, rave
is dead.
Not that no one
raves anymore.
Plenty of evidence
of the growing pop
ularity of raving ex
ists: rave hotlines
published in Bay
Area weekly readers,
sales of overalls at
their greatest ever, a
younger, high

school crowd raving
each weekend which
obviously does not
mind shelling out 20
duckets (or more, de-

pending on your dependencies),
Live 105's broadcast of the latest
cyberpunk techno favorites and even
Stanford's own 'X' parties on the row.

In light of all this, by stating "rave is dead"
1 mean that the word "rave" connotes some
thing so subjective that it's impossible to
pinpoint or articulate. It means too many
things to too many different people. Some
ravers really believe in a spiritual dimension
inherent to the rave experience.
Others feel that raves are purely hedonist
and can't be fun without some sort of drug.
Yet others advocate the view printed on a
flier handed out at a community rave last
March: "Rave culture is the new world order

We are dancing to make the world a
better place. We demonstrate trust and
the ability to 'all get along.' We are re
connecting with our natural world and
re-establishing our multi-racial family.
.. [t]his is our vision: we must... dis-

solve the boundaries our culture has sanc
tioned."
Personally, the attraction of raving stems
from the fact that 1 love dancing and raves
provide the most incredible opportunity for
people to grind or groove as crazily as they
desire. But trying to describe to you the 'en
ergy' I feel when dancing with a couple thou
sand people all high on life or drugs or both
and how this trips me out and blows my
mind is like trying to translate one language
to another. Something gets lost in the
process of putting this experience of dance
into words.
In addition to the ways in which ravers
describe themselves and the rave experience,
the perceptions of non-ravers impact the
whole scene. Ravers no longer solely exist for
themselves, they must contend with the la
bels and identities cast upon them by the
parent culture which recognizes its exis
tence.
Think about it — who's in charge of what


it means to rave and be a raver? Is it Inter
mission, which might like me to convey the
goings-on of the San Francisco/Bay Area
rave scene and how and why you too can be
come a member in time for the next FMR,
Gathering, Wicked or Come/Unity and ful
fill your force-fed expectations?
Or does identity originate from those
hardcore rave disciples who rattle off the
names of the better D.J.s and the history of
music played at raves (from techno to house
to acid house and jazz to tribal to ambient)
like no tomorrow? Or how about those who
exhort the cathartic quality of collective
dancing? And the hangers-on who don't re
ally know that much about anything rave
like but rave anyway just bccause?
It seems that ravers and non-ravers alike
arc competing to make their perception the
authoritative interpretation of the rave scene.
Part and parcel of this great debate over what
makes a 'real* raver stems from the fact that
almost everywhere, raves have gradually been
forced by the authorities to become legiti
mate. The authorities are cracking down,
since those dancing lunatics pose a real and
serious threat to the society, and have been
requiring that rave promoters obtain permits
to rent spaces to hold their parties.
And as raves move into a more visible social
arena, raves have mutated. One of the more
humorous characterizations of the rave
[revolution appeared in the Los Angeles
Reader in spring 1992. Marking the changing
nature of raves, the article listed the new argot:
underground" characterizes "an illegal rave
(or one that embodies the spirit of the illegals),
usually held in warehouses, with or without
the owner's permission."
Rave, in itself, simply means "a dance
party with a psychedelic atmosphere of
swirling lights, lasers, incredibly loud acid
house music, and sweaty hordes." How funny
— I thought raves were supposed to be un
derground.
1 lonestly, while there may be a slew of peo-

pic out there who still believe this,
since the legitimization of

raves, parties have lost their
clandestine nature. The loss

of this certain je nc sais cjuoi
is unfortunate because part
of the beauty of raves lies in
the fact that they weren't
originally meant to confer
some level of status.
Kveryone was dancing
and nobody really knew
how to describe the crazi
ness and intensity of it all.
Or as Dave Scharf (one
of the first involved with
Rave-on-Sharon) said: "You

wcre dancing your brains
out in a whirling dervish kind

of thing . . . non-stop
sweat dancing with
everyone there and that
was the whole vibe —
that was what created the

whole rave — that's what
rave is .... You're dancing
with everybody, you're not
just with your little part
ner or whatever it is and

... that's what I realized
was the incredible attraction of
it." You danced and everyone

around you danced and nobody re
ally cared what you did. And in that
sense the experience was all-inclusive.

From the SAF. posse in Stanford sweat
shirts, to 50-year-old ex-hippies (including
those freaky older men, Timothy Leary, Ter
ence McKenna, and Bruce Fisner), to Ms. I
work-at-Apple Computer-during-the-day
and-rave-at-night, to yours-truly-with-a-10
a.m.-class-to-attend. Hell, yo' momma couid
have been there and no one would have
thought anything of it, because everyone
would be so into 'it' — so engrossed, so en
thralled. No "was-your-dad-a-thief" lines,

no freaking, no "can I see your I.D. please?"
This was entirely different, perhaps a revolt

to the club scene, to nightlife conven
tionality and pretensions.

Raves prospered in their
relative non-identity. The

whole thing was so
damned vague, uncus
tomary, almost unreal —
you didn't know where

the party was sup
posed to he, you drove
around in pursuit of

this secret location,
you didn't know why

everyone touched each
other and didn't mind (or
well, you did understand,

but it was still sort of
bizarre), you didn't really
know why you were doing

what you were doing with
hundreds of people
when rest of the

world was
sleeping or
just wak-

ing up
for
work.

A fine line exists
between what rave

sub-culture can
properly call its
own and who,
in fact, defines

the sub-culture. The uncertainty of owner
ship and the delicate interaction between
sub- and parent cultures leads to the dilem
ma: how long can something remain differ
ent? How long before "otherness" is re
duced to "sameness?" As more specialty
stores market the raver "look" and rave be
comes entrenched in a regular nightlife pro
gram, the authenticity of ravers diminishes.
As Dick Hebdige said in Subculture: the
Meaning of Style, "publicity and packaging
... must inevitably lead to the defusion of
the subcultures subversive power ... as
soon as original innovations which signify
'subculture' are translated into commodi
ties and made generally available, they be
come frozen." Well, Dick, you've hit the nail
on the head. The reason why so many old
timers consider rave so ... how do you say
dee-boring .. . results from the fact that its
authenticity depends on its resistance to
mass appropriation.
Like other sub-cultural experiences,
raves will undoubtedly lose their popular
ity as time passes. Like them, rave is
doomed to die out. More than likely, this
apathetically-stereotyped generation will
find something new with which to occupy
itself.
As Hebdige argues, "If a style is really to
catch on, if it is to become genuinely pop
ular, [sub-culture] must say the right
things in the right way at the right time. It
must anticipate or encapsulate a mood, a
moment." Once that moment has passed,
once rave has effectively been worn down
by exploitation and internal unrest, a new
group will devote themselves to yet anoth
er movement.
Whatever the final outcome of rave sub
culture will be, by no means do I intend to
cash in and stop raving just yet. Just like all
the people I've run into on campus who rave
or have raved in the past, 1 still find that rav
ing is incredible.
Yet we brace ourselves for the end. ■

— I thought raves were supposed to be un

1 lonestly, while there may be a slew of peo-

since the legitimization of

raves, parties have lost their

of the beauty of raves lies in

Kveryone was dancing
and nobody really knew
how to describe the crazi

Or as Dave Scharf (one

out in a whirling dervish kind

of thing . . . non-stop
sweat dancing with

around you danced and nobody re

sense the experience was all-inclusive.

From the SAF. posse in Stanford sweat

would be so into 'it' — so engrossed, so en
thralled. No "was-your-dad-a-thief" lines,

no freaking, no "can I see your I.D. please?"
This was entirely different, perhaps a revolt

to the club scene, to nightlife conven
tionality and pretensions.

Raves prospered in their
relative non-identity. The

whole thing was so
damned vague, uncus
tomary, almost unreal —
you didn't know where

the party was sup
posed to he, you drove
around in pursuit of

this secret location,
you didn't know why

everyone touched each
other and didn't mind (or
well, you did understand,

but it was still sort of
bizarre), you didn't really
know why you were doing

what you were doing with
hundreds of people
when rest of the

world was
sleeping or
just wak-

ing up
for
work.

A fine line exists
between what rave

sub-culture can
properly call its
own and who,
in fact, defines

the sub-culture. The uncertainty of owner
ship and the delicate interaction between
sub- and parent cultures leads to the dilem
ma: how long can something remain differ
ent? How long before "otherness" is re
duced to "sameness?" As more specialty
stores market the raver "look" and rave be
comes entrenched in a regular nightlife pro
gram, the authenticity of ravers diminishes.
As Dick Hebdige said in Subculture: the
Meaning of Style, "publicity and packaging
... must inevitably lead to the defusion of
the subcultures subversive power ... as
soon as original innovations which signify
'subculture' are translated into commodi
ties and made generally available, they be
come frozen." Well, Dick, you've hit the nail
on the head. The reason why so many old
timers consider rave so ... how do you say
dee-boring .. . results from the fact that its
authenticity depends on its resistance to
mass appropriation.
Like other sub-cultural experiences,
raves will undoubtedly lose their popular
ity as time passes. Like them, rave is
doomed to die out. More than likely, this
apathetically-stereotyped generation will
find something new with which to occupy
itself.
As Hebdige argues, "If a style is really to
catch on, if it is to become genuinely pop
ular, [sub-culture] must say the right
things in the right way at the right time. It
must anticipate or encapsulate a mood, a
moment." Once that moment has passed,
once rave has effectively been worn down
by exploitation and internal unrest, a new
group will devote themselves to yet anoth
er movement.
Whatever the final outcome of rave sub
culture will be, by no means do I intend to
cash in and stop raving just yet. Just like all
the people I've run into on campus who rave
or have raved in the past, 1 still find that rav
ing is incredible.

I have many apprehensions about writing
an article on raves, namely because I like to
rave .... I enjoy the whole 'scene' and yet
here I am writing an article in a newspaper
geared toward an audience outside the sub
cultural circle. More than likely, I am con
tributing to the appropriation of a sub-cul
ture which prides itself on separation from
mass culture. And most importantly, I am
contributing to its death.
The rave scene in the Bay Area dates back
a few years. I don't know the exact date nor
the first rave, but I will go so far as to say that
ravers were around, at the latest, by 1989.
Originating in Manchester, England during
the mid-eighties (where the disaffected
youth truly have something to be disaffected
about), the rave scene transplanted itself
into the Los Angeles area.
With the effort in England to stem the
popularity of raves (where Parliament tried
to restrict rave events to which literally tens
of thousands of Generation X-ers went every
weekend, where techno was top-forty and
where an estimated 500,000 were regular Ec
stasy users), rave promoters turned west
ward to establish new headquarters.
In Los Angeles, first, then up to San Fran
cisco, and now in virtually every part of the
country, raves have spread from coast to
coast. This infiltration sends a code blue the
pigs and our parents who groan, "Please
don't let it be another one of those damn
youth uprisings."
So that's where the idea of rave came
from. But raves are undefinable. It's impos
sible to do a composite raver sketch. (Some
of you old skoolers or non-believers out
there may beg to differ. However, while it
may be true that most ravers are white, male,
between the ages of 17 and 24, wear

skater/grunge/seven
ties-style, believe me,
there's more diversity out
there than you know).

Unfortunately, mass media
has pigeonholed ravers and
when Twentieth Century Fox
comes out with the '90s version
of "Breakin'," white gloves,
backpacks, water bottles, whis
tles, Vicks vapor rub, trip

toys, Heidi braids, plat
form sneakers, Fresh
Jive wear and plenty

more 'sym
bols' of
raver iden-

tity will invade the
screen.
Thus far,

Newsweek has called
the rave movement a
return to infantilism
... "48 Hours" warns all

concerned parents in the
Bay Area that 70 percent to
80 percent of kids going to

raves on weekends are taking l
ecstasy ... let's see who else has
spewed .... Time magazine
thinks we combine hippie ideal
ism with technological know-how
(and that we subsequently think
Billy Idol's latest cyberpunk look is

phresh)... The New York Times asserts

that techno is just an extension of the "Nin

tendo Age" ... et cetera et cetera et
cetera.
Whatever — as if any of this were
true. I admit there was a point in time
when the rave scene had its heyday in
the Bay Area, when there was a real
sense that ravers were unified and

that as a subculture, we
were going to make an

impact. But now, as
is characteristic

of all sub-cultur
al movements, rave
is dead.
Not that no one
raves anymore.
Plenty of evidence
of the growing pop
ularity of raving ex
ists: rave hotlines
published in Bay
Area weekly readers,
sales of overalls at
their greatest ever, a
younger, high

school crowd raving
each weekend which
obviously does not
mind shelling out 20
duckets (or more, de-

pending on your dependencies),
Live 105's broadcast of the latest
cyberpunk techno favorites and even
Stanford's own 'X' parties on the row.

In light of all this, by stating "rave is dead"
1 mean that the word "rave" connotes some
thing so subjective that it's impossible to
pinpoint or articulate. It means too many
things to too many different people. Some
ravers really believe in a spiritual dimension
inherent to the rave experience.
Others feel that raves are purely hedonist
and can't be fun without some sort of drug.
Yet others advocate the view printed on a
flier handed out at a community rave last
March: "Rave culture is the new world order

We are dancing to make the world a
better place. We demonstrate trust and
the ability to 'all get along.' We are re
connecting with our natural world and
re-establishing our multi-racial family.
.. [t]his is our vision: we must... dis-

solve the boundaries our culture has sanc
tioned."
Personally, the attraction of raving stems
from the fact that 1 love dancing and raves
provide the most incredible opportunity for
people to grind or groove as crazily as they
desire. But trying to describe to you the 'en
ergy' I feel when dancing with a couple thou
sand people all high on life or drugs or both
and how this trips me out and blows my
mind is like trying to translate one language
to another. Something gets lost in the
process of putting this experience of dance
into words.
In addition to the ways in which ravers
describe themselves and the rave experience,
the perceptions of non-ravers impact the
whole scene. Ravers no longer solely exist for
themselves, they must contend with the la
bels and identities cast upon them by the
parent culture which recognizes its exis
tence.
Think about it — who's in charge of what


it means to rave and be a raver? Is it Inter
mission, which might like me to convey the
goings-on of the San Francisco/Bay Area
rave scene and how and why you too can be
come a member in time for the next FMR,
Gathering, Wicked or Come/Unity and ful
fill your force-fed expectations?
Or does identity originate from those
hardcore rave disciples who rattle off the
names of the better D.J.s and the history of
music played at raves (from techno to house
to acid house and jazz to tribal to ambient)
like no tomorrow? Or how about those who
exhort the cathartic quality of collective
dancing? And the hangers-on who don't re
ally know that much about anything rave
like but rave anyway just bccause?
It seems that ravers and non-ravers alike
arc competing to make their perception the
authoritative interpretation of the rave scene.
Part and parcel of this great debate over what
makes a 'real* raver stems from the fact that
almost everywhere, raves have gradually been
forced by the authorities to become legiti
mate. The authorities are cracking down,
since those dancing lunatics pose a real and
serious threat to the society, and have been
requiring that rave promoters obtain permits
to rent spaces to hold their parties.
And as raves move into a more visible social
arena, raves have mutated. One of the more
humorous characterizations of the rave
[revolution appeared in the Los Angeles
Reader in spring 1992. Marking the changing
nature of raves, the article listed the new argot:
underground" characterizes "an illegal rave
(or one that embodies the spirit of the illegals),
usually held in warehouses, with or without
the owner's permission."
Rave, in itself, simply means "a dance
party with a psychedelic atmosphere of
swirling lights, lasers, incredibly loud acid
house music, and sweaty hordes." How funny
— I thought raves were supposed to be un
derground.

ecstasy ... let's see who else has

Whatever — as if any of this were
true. I admit there was a point in time
when the rave scene had its heyday in
the Bay Area, when there was a real
sense that ravers were unified and

that as a subculture, we
were going to make an

impact. But now, as
is characteristic

of all sub-cultur
al movements, rave
is dead.
Not that no one
raves anymore.
Plenty of evidence
of the growing pop
ularity of raving ex
ists: rave hotlines
published in Bay
Area weekly readers,
sales of overalls at
their greatest ever, a
younger, high

school crowd raving
each weekend which
obviously does not
mind shelling out 20
duckets (or more, de-

pending on your dependencies),
Live 105's broadcast of the latest
cyberpunk techno favorites and even
Stanford's own 'X' parties on the row.

In light of all this, by stating "rave is dead"
1 mean that the word "rave" connotes some
thing so subjective that it's impossible to
pinpoint or articulate. It means too many
things to too many different people. Some
ravers really believe in a spiritual dimension
inherent to the rave experience.
Others feel that raves are purely hedonist
and can't be fun without some sort of drug.
Yet others advocate the view printed on a
flier handed out at a community rave last
March: "Rave culture is the new world order

We are dancing to make the world a
better place. We demonstrate trust and
the ability to 'all get along.' We are re
connecting with our natural world and
re-establishing our multi-racial family.
.. [t]his is our vision: we must... dis-

solve the boundaries our culture has sanc
tioned."
Personally, the attraction of raving stems
from the fact that 1 love dancing and raves
provide the most incredible opportunity for
people to grind or groove as crazily as they
desire. But trying to describe to you the 'en
ergy' I feel when dancing with a couple thou
sand people all high on life or drugs or both
and how this trips me out and blows my
mind is like trying to translate one language
to another. Something gets lost in the
process of putting this experience of dance
into words.
In addition to the ways in which ravers
describe themselves and the rave experience,
the perceptions of non-ravers impact the
whole scene. Ravers no longer solely exist for
themselves, they must contend with the la
bels and identities cast upon them by the
parent culture which recognizes its exis
tence.
Think about it — who's in charge of what


it means to rave and be a raver? Is it Inter
mission, which might like me to convey the
goings-on of the San Francisco/Bay Area
rave scene and how and why you too can be
come a member in time for the next FMR,
Gathering, Wicked or Come/Unity and ful
fill your force-fed expectations?
Or does identity originate from those
hardcore rave disciples who rattle off the
names of the better D.J.s and the history of
music played at raves (from techno to house
to acid house and jazz to tribal to ambient)
like no tomorrow? Or how about those who
exhort the cathartic quality of collective
dancing? And the hangers-on who don't re
ally know that much about anything rave
like but rave anyway just bccause?
It seems that ravers and non-ravers alike
arc competing to make their perception the
authoritative interpretation of the rave scene.
Part and parcel of this great debate over what
makes a 'real* raver stems from the fact that
almost everywhere, raves have gradually been
forced by the authorities to become legiti
mate. The authorities are cracking down,
since those dancing lunatics pose a real and
serious threat to the society, and have been
requiring that rave promoters obtain permits
to rent spaces to hold their parties.
And as raves move into a more visible social
arena, raves have mutated. One of the more
humorous characterizations of the rave
[revolution appeared in the Los Angeles
Reader in spring 1992. Marking the changing
nature of raves, the article listed the new argot:
underground" characterizes "an illegal rave
(or one that embodies the spirit of the illegals),
usually held in warehouses, with or without
the owner's permission."
Rave, in itself, simply means "a dance
party with a psychedelic atmosphere of
swirling lights, lasers, incredibly loud acid
house music, and sweaty hordes." How funny
— I thought raves were supposed to be un
derground.
1 lonestly, while there may be a slew of peo-

pic out there who still believe this,
since the legitimization of

raves, parties have lost their
clandestine nature. The loss

of this certain je nc sais cjuoi
is unfortunate because part
of the beauty of raves lies in
the fact that they weren't
originally meant to confer
some level of status.
Kveryone was dancing
and nobody really knew
how to describe the crazi
ness and intensity of it all.
Or as Dave Scharf (one
of the first involved with
Rave-on-Sharon) said: "You

wcre dancing your brains
out in a whirling dervish kind

of thing . . . non-stop
sweat dancing with
everyone there and that
was the whole vibe —
that was what created the

whole rave — that's what
rave is .... You're dancing
with everybody, you're not
just with your little part
ner or whatever it is and

... that's what I realized
was the incredible attraction of
it." You danced and everyone

around you danced and nobody re
ally cared what you did. And in that
sense the experience was all-inclusive.

From the SAF. posse in Stanford sweat
shirts, to 50-year-old ex-hippies (including
those freaky older men, Timothy Leary, Ter
ence McKenna, and Bruce Fisner), to Ms. I
work-at-Apple Computer-during-the-day
and-rave-at-night, to yours-truly-with-a-10
a.m.-class-to-attend. Hell, yo' momma couid
have been there and no one would have
thought anything of it, because everyone
would be so into 'it' — so engrossed, so en
thralled. No "was-your-dad-a-thief" lines,

no freaking, no "can I see your I.D. please?"
This was entirely different, perhaps a revolt

to the club scene, to nightlife conven
tionality and pretensions.

Raves prospered in their
relative non-identity. The

whole thing was so
damned vague, uncus
tomary, almost unreal —
you didn't know where

the party was sup
posed to he, you drove
around in pursuit of

this secret location,
you didn't know why

everyone touched each
other and didn't mind (or
well, you did understand,

but it was still sort of
bizarre), you didn't really
know why you were doing

what you were doing with
hundreds of people
when rest of the

world was
sleeping or
just wak-

ing up
for
work.

A fine line exists
between what rave

sub-culture can
properly call its
own and who,
in fact, defines

the sub-culture. The uncertainty of owner
ship and the delicate interaction between
sub- and parent cultures leads to the dilem
ma: how long can something remain differ
ent? How long before "otherness" is re
duced to "sameness?" As more specialty
stores market the raver "look" and rave be
comes entrenched in a regular nightlife pro
gram, the authenticity of ravers diminishes.
As Dick Hebdige said in Subculture: the
Meaning of Style, "publicity and packaging
... must inevitably lead to the defusion of
the subcultures subversive power ... as
soon as original innovations which signify
'subculture' are translated into commodi
ties and made generally available, they be
come frozen." Well, Dick, you've hit the nail
on the head. The reason why so many old
timers consider rave so ... how do you say
dee-boring .. . results from the fact that its
authenticity depends on its resistance to
mass appropriation.
Like other sub-cultural experiences,
raves will undoubtedly lose their popular
ity as time passes. Like them, rave is
doomed to die out. More than likely, this
apathetically-stereotyped generation will
find something new with which to occupy
itself.
As Hebdige argues, "If a style is really to
catch on, if it is to become genuinely pop
ular, [sub-culture] must say the right
things in the right way at the right time. It
must anticipate or encapsulate a mood, a
moment." Once that moment has passed,
once rave has effectively been worn down
by exploitation and internal unrest, a new
group will devote themselves to yet anoth
er movement.
Whatever the final outcome of rave sub
culture will be, by no means do I intend to
cash in and stop raving just yet. Just like all
the people I've run into on campus who rave
or have raved in the past, 1 still find that rav
ing is incredible.
Yet we brace ourselves for the end. ■


I have many apprehensions about writing
an article on raves, namely because I like to
rave .... I enjoy the whole 'scene' and yet
here I am writing an article in a newspaper
geared toward an audience outside the sub
cultural circle. More than likely, I am con
tributing to the appropriation of a sub-cul
ture which prides itself on separation from
mass culture. And most importantly, I am
contributing to its death.
The rave scene in the Bay Area dates back
a few years. I don't know the exact date nor
the first rave, but I will go so far as to say that
ravers were around, at the latest, by 1989.
Originating in Manchester, England during
the mid-eighties (where the disaffected
youth truly have something to be disaffected
about), the rave scene transplanted itself
into the Los Angeles area.
With the effort in England to stem the
popularity of raves (where Parliament tried
to restrict rave events to which literally tens
of thousands of Generation X-ers went every
weekend, where techno was top-forty and
where an estimated 500,000 were regular Ec
stasy users), rave promoters turned west
ward to establish new headquarters.
In Los Angeles, first, then up to San Fran
cisco, and now in virtually every part of the
country, raves have spread from coast to
coast. This infiltration sends a code blue the
pigs and our parents who groan, "Please
don't let it be another one of those damn
youth uprisings."
So that's where the idea of rave came
from. But raves are undefinable. It's impos
sible to do a composite raver sketch. (Some
of you old skoolers or non-believers out
there may beg to differ. However, while it
may be true that most ravers are white, male,
between the ages of 17 and 24, wear

skater/grunge/seven
ties-style, believe me,
there's more diversity out
there than you know).

Unfortunately, mass media
has pigeonholed ravers and
when Twentieth Century Fox
comes out with the '90s version
of "Breakin'," white gloves,
backpacks, water bottles, whis
tles, Vicks vapor rub, trip

toys, Heidi braids, plat
form sneakers, Fresh
Jive wear and plenty

more 'sym
bols' of
raver iden-

tity will invade the
screen.
Thus far,

Newsweek has called
the rave movement a
return to infantilism
... "48 Hours" warns all

concerned parents in the
Bay Area that 70 percent to
80 percent of kids going to

raves on weekends are taking l
ecstasy ... let's see who else has
spewed .... Time magazine
thinks we combine hippie ideal
ism with technological know-how
(and that we subsequently think
Billy Idol's latest cyberpunk look is

phresh)... The New York Times asserts

that techno is just an extension of the "Nin

tendo Age" ... et cetera et cetera et
cetera.
Whatever — as if any of this were
true. I admit there was a point in time
when the rave scene had its heyday in
the Bay Area, when there was a real
sense that ravers were unified and

that as a subculture, we
were going to make an

impact. But now, as
is characteristic

of all sub-cultur
al movements, rave

Not that no one

ularity of raving ex
ists: rave hotlines
published in Bay
Area weekly readers,
sales of overalls at
their greatest ever, a
younger, high

school crowd raving
