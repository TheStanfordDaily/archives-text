# It's good going nowhere
## 'Reality Bites' delivers predictable fun 
### 
As my roommate and other unfortunates
like him would crawl on their hands and
knees through broken glass for a blissful
glimpse of Winona Ryder, a critical ap
praisal of "Reality Bites," another film for
whitebread college and post-college types,
commands only so much authority. Firmly
entrenched within the young romance
genre, the movie breaks no new ground in
terms of character or theme, but it's funny
and compelling as long as it makes fun of
Gap clothing, MTV and other shrines of
American youth and doesn't try to take itself
too seriously.
Most of the film centers on Lelaina Pierce
(Ryder), a pleasant college grad who works as
a production assistant for an inane Houston
talk show. In her free time she shoots video of
her roommates and fellow graduates as they
spout on about life, marriage and so on in the
90s while they smoke, watch reruns of "The
Jeffersons" and generally don't work.
Ethan Hawke plays Lelaina's roommate
and überslacker Troy Dyer, who reads Hei
degger's "Being and Time" in greasy diners,
can't finish his major or any job and sports a
de riguer goatee. Of course, he plays guitar in
a grunge band. Of course, you expect Lelaina
and Mr. Cool to scrog after whining and
whimpering at each other. And of course,
your expectations are absolutely correct.
Vickie Miner (Janeane Garofalo), the
rambunctious female of the house, keeps a
journal of sexual conquests complete with
partner's name and date and a mouth that
drips with sarcastic commentary. She's en
dowed with the film's zippy lines, but that's

about it for depth of character.
Sammy Gray (Steve Zahn) is the final and
most irrelevant member of the house, who
plays the film's gay character and that's it.
1 le's gay. That's it.
Shifting between banter scenes among the
above characters, the spine of the story rests
on Lelaina and her relationship with Mike
Grates (Ben Stiller), a self-effacing yuppie
who works for an M W-like channel. He likes
her and her work, even though he's a little
shallow, inarticulate and dumb (an amazing
contrast to Troy, the deep — though unem
ployed — subversive). So there's romantic
conflict, especially when the stakes go up —
M ike is excited by Lelaina's video and wants to
send it to his boss as an example of serious
work, something that speaks the truth about
our troubled generation. Or something like
that.
In any event, the movie's best moments
arise not so much from its predictable plot but
from scenes that squeeze laughs from the va
garies of college life — Vickie proudly demon
strates proper sweater-folding technique at
the Gap, lelaina wraps a couple paper towels
to create a makeshift coffee filter and Troy
refers to Mr. Roper, "Good l imes" and Domi
no's as part of his everyday vocabulary.
The dialogue, penned by 22-year-old Helen
Childress, is packed with all the "likes," "to
tallys" and "like totallys" endemic to the speech
of college campuses without being overdone.
Nevertheless, some of the older audience
might remain a little dazed and confused.
Director Ben Stiller admirably plays the
fumbling yuppie who drives a Saab, wears

overstated suits and doesn't even have the
guts to be self-important about it. He's the
movie's most unique character, but unfortu
nately his potential as a strong character lies
fallow. However, Stiller's direction is sure and
confident, the camera moving energetically
with a clear eye for bright colors and fast ac
tion appropriate to a film of this kind.
Despite its less-than-solid story, "Reality
Bites" feels like it was written by someone fa

miliar with the concrctc details and language
of white middle-class kids trying to enjoy
life, deal with relationships and face the
problems of the collegiate subculture. Hoi
stered by a young cast and an equally youth
ful director, it's an enjoyable though unsur
prising romp that stuffs in enough funny
moments to allow you to forgive its minor
problems.
