## Golden Gate 
### 
Just how bad is the latest David Henry
1 Iwang film "Golden Gate"? Let me count the
ways.
I could start with the weak film-noir
meets-"Dragnet" plot. Or maybe I could dis
cuss the ineffective white-man-absolves
guilt-by-absorbing-Chinese-culture spoof.
Or how about just sticking to the old standby
— can anyone say "poor acting"?
What Was Hwang thinking? Can this be
the same Tony-winning writer who tanta
lized us with the brilliant social and political
criticism of "M. Butterfly"?
Yet, I digress.
Set in 1950s San Francisco, "Golden Gate"

begins with rookie
FBI agent Kevin
Walker (Matt Dillon)
and his partner, Ron
Pirelli (Bruno Kirby)
eagerly tackling cases
by day, and partying
and getting laid by
night.
And all is well,
until the Bureau Chief
assigns Walker and
Pirelli to Chinatown,
a job that requires sur
veillance of innocent

Chinese laundry men.
Because Red Scare hysteria demands that
the FBI produce subversives to appease
white-picket-fence America, Walker is faced
with a decision. Should he manipulate the
law to trap the Chinese immigrants or should
he fight for justice and risk slipping down the
old career ladder?
The consequences of his decision leave
Walker searching for an elusive redemption.
"Golden Gate" continues, throwing that
quest together with cheesy Chinese legend,
an extremely unrealistic love story, and the
1968 Bay Area civil disobedience. Frankly, it
doesn't work.
Fart of the brilliance of "M. Butterfly"
comes from Hwang's masterful mix of satire
and seriousness. In "Golden Gate," only one
scene successfully holds up the grave end —
when Chen Jung Song (Tzi Ma), in a Fit of
frustration, thrashes several garbage cans in a
narrow alley, drawing a small crowd of judg
mental onlookers.
If "Golden Gate" hadn't been so pre
dictable, maybe the funny part would have
garnered a few laughs. Maybe the film-noir
approach let the air out of the serious scenes.
Or maybe the casting director should have
known that Dillon and black comedy sit
about as well as sardines and buttermilk.
Or maybe I Iwang should have written a real
story instead of insulting us with the vacuous,
whitey-bashing, PC exercise "Golden Gate."
