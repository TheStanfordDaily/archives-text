# I'll Do Anything

Art does a cruci imitation of life in James
L. Brooks' "I'll Do Anything," a modern-day
movie musical about movies whose songs
were unceremoniously cut at the eleventh
hour.
It's hard to see how music could have
made "I'll Do Anything" any worse. If any
thing, a few big production numbers would
have provided the laughs lacking in this
would-be romantic comedy.
Nick Nolte valiantly — albeit vainly —
attempts to save the picture in the lead roll of
Matt Ilobbs, a has-been actor who'll "do any
thing" to get a part.
His nice-guy gusto attracts an earnest
script-reader (Joely Richardson), who wants
to cast Hobbs in a remake of "Mr. Deeds
Goes to Town" — a project as improbable
as, well, a modern-day movie musical.
But reality sinks in when Hobbs' es
tranged wife dumps their precocious six
year-old daughter (Whittni Wright) on her
reluctant father for a permanent visit.
Brooks' remarkably game cast achieves
the baby-boomer bonhomie that made the
director's "Broadcast News" a hit. But the fa
miliar conflict between idealistic artists and
corrupt studios quickly wears thin.
Hollywood self-satire has been done better
in films from "Sunset Boulevard" to "The
Flayer." A spontaneous ballad or two might

have added a new twist, but little else in "I'll
Do Anything" is new. A callous producer and
a car phone leitmotif are especially ftn-ile
'HOs.
While " The Flayer" was wickedly funny,
"I'll Do Anything" is just wicked. In-jokes
come oft as either spiteful or self-congratula
tory, with broad cinematic winks telling us
we're supposed to laugh.
A spattering of "celebrity" cameos fall flat,
partly because the participants are satirizing
screen stereotypes, rather than themselves.
I 11 Do Anything" remains a musical in
all but the technical sense, with the requisite
over-acting, flimsy plot and cheesy dialogue.
You can practically smell the songs coming,
but they never do.
What might have been remembered as a
failed, but interesting experiment is doomed
to go down in history as an unequivocal, ut
terly unharmonious disaster.
