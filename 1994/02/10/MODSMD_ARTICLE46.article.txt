# Searching for 'God'
## Tori Amos breeds creativity in a sample jar 
### 
"You are cither talking into your frozen
peas, 'come in lemon pie, come in lemon pie,
get me out of this horrible Thanksgiving mo
ment of life,' or you're not. You are either in
touch with lizard people or you are not,"
wrote Tori Amos in her fanzine "Upside
Down."
It's cute and irreverent, but it gets old on
the new album "Under the Pink," her first
since the powerful "Little Earthquakes."
Consider the first track, "Pretty Good Year," a
precious alignment of spacey text and new
age piano technique. It's "The Long and
Winding Road," as interpreted by a histrion
ic Kate Bush with a few sniffles and tics
thrown in. Whatever happened to the con
cise, purposeful, angry song writing of "Little
Earthquakes"?
It returns with rancor on track two,
"God." While Amos grooves a muddy piano
with a bassist, a house beat throbs. "God,
sometimes you just don't come through,"
Amos barely sighs, "do you need a woman to
look after you?" A choir boy pops and Amos
wonders "why you always go when the wind
blows?" This is some of her best singing —
restrained, subtle — and any shortcomings
in the sensationalistic lyrics arc dwarfed by
her driving piano work. Amos has found a
terrific new balance: the groovy backup band
requires that the piano keep up with more
than sustained arpeggios, and the overall din
cancels the usual vocal dandering — Amos
has just enough room to sing the words and
none more.
Peace is declared on track eight, "Corn
flake Girl," the best song on the album. The
big sound of "God" returns in the form of
chiming mandolin, bass runs, Merry Clay

ton's throaty guest vocal and stabs of vibra
to-processed guitar. "Never was a cornflake
girl," Amos muses, "thought that was a good
solution hangin' with the raisin girls . . .
things are getting kind of gross and 1 go at
sleepy time this is not really happening."
Amos then rises to a kind of ethereal pitch
and retorts that the impossible — a rape —
is happening. It is a startling, revealing
work.
"Past the Mission" is another successful
track. The introduction is unusual — a few
seconds of Amos singing "I don't believe I
went too far" with a drum tapping the lead
in to an abbreviated funk-swing. The cho
rus is a pleasant bit featuring Trent Reznor
of Nine Inch Nails on backup vox. What is
Reznor doing here? Amos says "Look, one
day I am going to show up at one of
[Reznor's] shows with some oven-fried
chicken and you won't even know 'Head
Like a Hole,' you'll be like licking up this
chicken grease dripping down your chin,
I'll show him." Anyway, the vox-organ is
catchy.
"The Wrong Band" may perplex listeners
at first, but overall it is a good track. Ignore
the pseudo-Broadway quality of the intro
duction and you arrive at the really fine part
about the song: John Philip Shenale's use of
the vintage Arp synthesizer. He coaxes a hi
larious string noise around the vocals — one
which is so ironic that it threatens to ruin all
serious purpose.
Certain songs, such as "Baker Baker," are
disastrous. The lyrics are at fault here: it's just
impossible to succeed in an Amy Grant-like
interpretation of words like "Baker Baker
baking a cake make me a day make me whole

again."
"The Waitress" is
a peculiar exercise
in industrial tex
tures. To the pulse
of backwards
drums and metal
hits Amos admits
that she wants "to
kill this waitress .. .
that's an act of kind
ness." Amos then
screams "I believe
in peace, Bitch," and
we're stuck in a
twenty-second tor
rent of drums and
muttering that
doesn't work. Con
ceptually, it's not
too original — the
industrial textures
feel strained and
awkward. Maybe
Trent Reznor
should've helped.

Two slow, con
templative works, "Icicle," and "Cloud on my
Tongue," are not especially memorable. It
seems that Amos has invented a new kind of
stream-of-consciousness-schlock to match
the orchestra's vacuous wanderings.
The last two tracks area mixed bag. "Space
Dog," with its droning synthesizer bass,
choral samples and wah-wah embellish
ments, is a peculiar piece that is mysteriously
emphatic. "Yes, Anastasia," is apparently
about the Anna Anderson/Anastasia Ro
manov conspiracy. It features the same well

trodden piano/orchestra territory heard on
"Pretty Good Year," but more, because it's the
last track.
Amos has made some terrific progress
since her last album — the best cuts off
"Under the Pink" are the best songs she's
written. Although it seems that Amos has
overextended herself on some difficult con
cepts, this rash of van ity is a typical syndrome
among follow-up records. If Amos can pre
serve the balance she found on tracks like
"God" and "Cornflake Girl," she will succeed.
