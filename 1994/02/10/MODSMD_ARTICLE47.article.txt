## "The Beavis and Butthead Experience" various artists 
### 
Mothers, hide your children. Teenagers,
break your piggy banks. "The Beavis and
Butt-head Experience" is here.
In the words of Butt -head, "this kicks ass."
"Experience" is the first release from this
MTV pair made famous by their crass and
obscene humor. But never fear, this album
won't subject you to sixty minutes of scato
logical jokes, because "Experience" is a com
pilation of some of the best names in heavy
metal today.
But the scope of "Experience" does not
simply include, ear-bleeding, ass-kicking,

head-banging, se
cret-devil-sign-mak-
ing songs. It has
much more.
For instance, An
thrax's "Looking
Down the Barrel of a
Gun" is prefaced by a
five minute story of
Beavis and Butt-head
finding the Anthrax
tour bus, hanging out

with the band, becoming incredibly annoying
and getting booted off. And, despite their slim
vocabulary, some of the charming talcs on
"The B & B Experience" demonstrate suave
and crafty story telling paralleled only by the
likes of Garrison Keillor.
Musically this album is a healthy sam
pling. Megadeth's "99 Ways to Die," is solid,
clean and pleasantly aggressive. And what
heavy metal compilation would be complete
without the mandatory "Wayne's World 2"
stars Aerosmith? "These guys are the kings of
rock, there is none higher," believe Wayne
and Garth. With "Deuces are Wild," Steve
Tyler and Company help round out the
album with a tune neither fast nor slow.
Despite all the great bands featured here,
the gem of this compilation is a B & B origi
nal, entitled "Come to Butt head." This
smooth sounding love tune features croon
ing vocals overlayed by Beavis and Butt-head
alluring the audience with a pimple-faced
fantasy. With lines like "1 would like do
something that really sucks for your love /1
would like do homework," these guys are
smoother than John Travolta in "Saturday
Night Fever."
So, why not treat yourself to a little toilet
bowl humor? You're not going to get lines like
"We need a chick who has tattoos on her
butt" anywhere else.
