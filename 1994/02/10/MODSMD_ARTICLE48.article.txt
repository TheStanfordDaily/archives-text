# "Pop Heiress" Chainsaw Kittens
## 
### 
With their new album "Pop Heiress," the
Chainsaw Kittens stake their claim to he the
rulers of mid-1990s popular rock n' roll.
Band leader Tyson Meade attempts to cap
ture the undirected spirit of America's "Gen
eration X," with mixed results.
"Pop Heiress" features a more straight
forward rock n' roll stance. The musical feel
is much lighter than their last album
"Flipped Out In Singapore." Meade's lyrics,
which express a confusion on how to live life,
are matched by the lively and glittery music
of the three other band members.
However, "Sore On the Floor," the
album's first song, isn't an ordinary rock
song. It has a punk-rock feel, with the bass
line sounding as if it was lifted from the Ra
mones' "Blitzkrieg Bop." The lyrics indicates
the arrival of the band's new music style:
"You got your new motor / Come on and
hang on." Meade urges the listener to follow
along for the ride, that "You can hold my
hand."
"Pop Heiress Dies" reflects the black
mood of the album. Guitarist Trent Bell is a
bit more sensitive to Meade's state of mind,

using a swaying guitar style that surges
along with the lyrics.
Meade's heart has been wrenched, having
just lost an ideology, discovering it to be
false. "I try to tell her I want to believe
everything that she's been saying to me/
She is everyone / She dies." He is echoing
his generation's bewilderment with life.
The ideology which he so loved has just
died.
The rest of the first side of the album con
tinues in this confused and tortured vein. In
"Dive Into the Sea" Meade announces: "I
don't know what I need."
In contrast, the second half begins with a
new will for living in "I Ride Free," with lyrics
like "My new piece of paper / Says I do what
I please ... I Ride Free." It's from that point
on the band strives to be America's "Pop
Heiress."
In turn, the band loses its emotional in
tensity and just churn out uninspired, faux
emotional music, overlaid with their glittery
rock.
I was disappointed.
While the band showed the promise of
being the next rulers of pop rock with the ex
cellent first half of the album, the Chainsaw
Kittens tried too hard to prove they were
worthy. And they failed.
