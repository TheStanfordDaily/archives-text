# It's a bok n the wall...
## ...But Chef Cho serves up great dim sum seven days a week 
### Joey Rosenblum 
Have you ever been to China
Town? It's a groovy place with all
sorts of ornate gates and peddlers
and teas and spices and chatchkies.
And of course, there's all this fan
tastic Chinese food. But if your
means of transportation are limit
ed to a one-mile biking radius,
you've probably never sat down to
a San Francisco dim sum brunch
and watched those silver carts of
dumplings and egg rolls and un
easy-looking fish whiz by.
Frankly, you're missing out on
one of life's more easily attainable
pleasures â€” but fear not! I have
uncovered the secret location of a
fantastic and local dim sum plea
sure palace with gourmet food at
enticing, bargain prices.

Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating.
Cho's dim sum on California Av
enue isn't exactly a heart of China
Town gourmet eatery. And it isn't

exactly a palace of
palate pleasing de
lights delivered to
your table in shiny sil
ver spaceship carts.
But it is great, cheap
dim sum.
The menu consists
of potstickers, egg
rolls, three types of

steamed dumplings (which all have
the same filling and taste but come
in a variety of shapes), pork buns
(a.k.a. 'bao' for you Chin Chin pa
trons) and two kinds of soup: hot
and sour and won ton. Perhaps this

limited menu is what allows Chef
Cho to prepare such dishes of gus
tatory perfection, or maybe it's the
hot sauce, but each of these appe-

tizer-sized dishes
when combined in
any number of cre
ative permutations
with other menu
items provides a fast,
filling and cheap
meal.
Six bucks gener
ally satisfies the

healthy appetite, and I've eaten a
full two-course meal (soup and
then potstickers) for under four
dollars.
Probably his potstickers (pan
fried dumplings in either pork or

chicken for you dim
sum neophytes) are
Cho's best bet. That is,
he's generally got
some cooking. Be
cause with Cho's,
sometimes that's the
catch: you have to eat
what he's got ready.
He's only got limited

stove and pan space, so there's al
ways the chance that it'll take an
hour to prepare something if it's not
already cooking. Once 1 asked for
the three-in-one steamer (two of
each kind of steamed dumpling...)
and two pork buns and ended up
with potstickers and an egg roll. But
every item is great, and the superb
won ton soup has more won tons

than soup.
While Cho's hole-in-the-wall
restaurant is literally a hole in the
wall (the whole place, including
kitchen, is maybe one and a half
times the size of a Stern or Wilbur
dorm room), and maybe it doesn't
have the elegance of China Town,
it's sure to satisfy that dim sum
itch, even on the student's budget.
