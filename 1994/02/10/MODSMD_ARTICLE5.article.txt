# Ethnic centers to submit budgets to administration
## 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
Leaders of Stanford's four eth
nic centers envision a worst-case
budget scenario where centers
close for up to two days each week
and director's salaries shrink dra
matically, according to a draft pro
posal they are submitting to ad
ministrators today.
If the centers take a 30 percent
cut, the preliminary plan asserts
that directors would be forced to
decrease their work time by as
much as 50 percent, most student
staffers would no longer be paid

and centers would have to shut
down during the week.
"Each of the centers runs on a
skeletal budget," argues the ver
sion of the proposal available yes
terday. "Cuts of any level would
likely result in a reduction of
staff."
Less drastic changes would be
in store for the centers under al
ternate scenarios for 5 and 15 per
cent budget cuts, with suggestions
ranging from eliminating travel
budgets to slicing hours for sup
port staff.
