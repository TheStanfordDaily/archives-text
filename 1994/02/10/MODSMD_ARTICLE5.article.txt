# Ethnic centers to submit budgets to administration
## 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
Leaders of Stanford's four eth
nic centers envision a worst-case
budget scenario where centers
close for up to two days each week
and director's salaries shrink dra
matically, according to a draft pro
posal they are submitting to ad
ministrators today.
If the centers take a 30 percent
cut, the preliminary plan asserts
that directors would be forced to
decrease their work time by as
much as 50 percent, most student
staffers would no longer be paid

and centers would have to shut
down during the week.
"Each of the centers runs on a
skeletal budget," argues the ver
sion of the proposal available yes
terday. "Cuts of any level would
likely result in a reduction of
staff."
Less drastic changes would be
in store for the centers under al
ternate scenarios for 5 and 15 per
cent budget cuts, with suggestions
ranging from eliminating travel
budgets to slicing hours for sup
port staff.
A revised version of the draft
— currently a "work in progress,"
according to Asian American
Activities Center Director Rick
Yuen — will go to Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson, Vice
Provost and Dean for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds and
Provost Condoleezza Rice today.
"This draft is still for review
and comments," Yuen said. "We

are trying to submit a final draft
as quickly as possible. . . but qual
ity is more important than expedi
ency."
The goal is to make sure
administrators have information
on what the centers do in time for
the first in a series of town meet
ings next Wednesday afternoon,
Yuen said.
That meeting will focus on the
effort to slice 15 to 30 percent
from Student Affairs — one ele
ment of the University's overall
goal of trimming $18-20 million
from the operating budget by

1997.
The centers' long-term health
is endangered by the "lack of an
adequate budget funding for basic
items including supplies and
postage," the draft says, and there
is a "near absence" of funding for
travel, repairs and maintenance.
With an annual budget of $156,
573, the Black Community Ser
vices Center has the most funding
of the four centers. The American
Indian Program is next with
$151,635, and El Centro Chicano
follows with $142,202. The Asian
American Activities Center has

the smallest budget at $128,351.
Between 87 and 93 percent of
each centers' budget goes to pay
for staffing; the directors' salaries
alone range from about $45,500 to
more than $62,000, including
benefits.
The four centers each
described three possible budget
cutting plans. Common threads
included the elimination of advis
ing, community publications,
minority student and faculty
recruiting, support for graduate
students and programs such as
panels and speakers.

While seven pages of specific
suggestions for cutbacks make up
the proposal's core, most of the
draft details the centers' many
tasks and pleads their case.
"As one of the most racially
and ethnically diverse universities
in the country, Stanford is looked
to for leadership in addressing the
challenge of diversity and unity in
higher education," it reads.
It notes that although the 1989
University Committee on Minori
ty Issues report recommended
increased support for the centers,
their budgets have "remained at a

virtual standstill" for the past five
years.
The proposal also quotes from
an October 1993 memo from
Jackson to Edmonds complaining
that "the development of the cen
ters as institutionalized adminis
trative offices has been both spo
radic and haphazard."
Copies of the revised version of
the draft should be available
through the ethnic centers begin
ning this afternoon, said Ameri
can Indian Program director Jim
Larimore, who says he will spend
about a week soliciting input.
