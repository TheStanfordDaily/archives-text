### 
The Accompanist
As the latest French film about beau
tiful, tormented people in the world
of classical music, "The Accompa
nist" proves to be an engrossing
stroll through that never, never land
Still, any story set in Nazi-occupied
Paris should have some historical
focus. Unfortunately, that reality is
marginalized in this bittersweet love
story. PG
Blink
With a foul-mouthed, bad-tempered
heroine (Madeline Stowe) who has
regained sight after years of blind
ness as the central character,
"Blink" proves to be a good detec
tive story with a twist While she's
predictably stalked by her neigh
bor's murderer and falls in love with
the man who protects her, eerie hal
licinations and space-age medical
advances help "Blink" stand out R
Blue
Incredible sound design and art di
rection make "Blue" an incredible vi
sual-audio experience But the story
belongs only to Juliette Binoche,
who provides a perfect portrayal of a
woman in pain who attempts self-lib
eration by cutting herself off from of
her emotions. "Blue" is a rarity in a
piece of commercial art — an acces
sible, engaging work of art R

In the Name of the Father
Despite appearances by Academy
Award-winning actors Daniel Day-
Lewis and Emma Thompson, "In the
Name of the Father" rarely rises
above melodrama Instead of focus
ing on how violence can destroy the
life of an everyman, director Jim
Sheridan takes on a well-worn per
spective, opting for courtroom
drama straight out of "L.A Law" and
"Perry Mason," R
Intersection
Dilemmas, dilemmas Playing a suc
cessful architect who must choose
between his career-oriented wife
(Sharon Stone) and a caring, upbeat
mistress (Lolita Davidovich), Richard
Gere comes to a mid-life cross
roads. The pretty shots of the pretty
faces are offset by cheesy scenes
and cheesy lines R
Mrs. Doubtfire
Without Robin Williams, this film
would be just another boy-dresses
as-girl-flick. He carries it just a notch
past into the land of almost-innova
tive entertainment — with a serious
method hidden just below the sur
face With adequate support from
the rest of the cast (Sally Fields,
Pierce Brosnan), Williams' first self
produced flick deals with parent
hood and divorce while always

keeping one hand on the funny
bone. PG-13
Naked
An experience that could, at best, be
called painful, Mike Leigh's latest
takes the worst view of male-female
relations and pushes it to an ex
teme With the story of an intellectu
al drifter who sexually and emotion
ally abuses women, Leigh suggests
that all women are masochists
through an overtly misogymstic film.
UNRATED
Philadelphia
The first major industry film about
AIDS, "Philadelphia" does not deny
the existence of either gay men or
homophobes Instead it places
polar opposites in close proximity,
watching their reactions while not
whitewashing their differences.
Bringing Denzel Washington and
Tom Hanks together and exposing
homophobia to the public's scrutiny
lift the film above the level of mere
PC-rhetoric. PG-13
Romeo Is Bleeding
When director Peter Medak decided
to direct "Romeo Is Bleeding," he
listened to the wrong voice in his
head. Good casting can't save this
black comedy which really misses.
Ridiculous violence and silly sex

scenes prevent the movie from
going anywhere. About the only
thing going for "Romeo" is actor
Gary Oldman's flawless New York
accent. R
Schindler's List
The dark, haunting images of
Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's
List" overcome the film's characters,
leaving moments more important
than people The story of German
entepreneur Oskar Schindler and
the more than 1,100 Jews he saves
leads to an examination of the many
faces of evil in the Nazi regime. With
indelible pictures of death and
degradation burned in black-and
white film, "Schindler's List" cap
tures the truth of the more than six
million murders carried out just a
half century ago. R
What's Eating Gilbert Grape?
"Gilbert Grape" isn't just another
trite, "commg-of-age" flick. It's a
fresh portrayal of how reclusive
Gilbert (Johnny Depp) emerges
from the burdens of family hfe to find
love. The performances are excel
lent: Leonard DiCapricio, who plays
Gilbert's mentally retarded brother,
may receive an Oscar nomination
for his riveting work. Above all that,
there's a bunch of neat symbols and
metaphors! PG-13

the more than 1,100 Jews he saves
leads to an examination of the many
faces of evil in the Nazi regime. With
indelible pictures of death and

What's Eating Gilbert Grape?
"Gilbert Grape" isn't just another
trite, "commg-of-age" flick. It's a
fresh portrayal of how reclusive
Gilbert (Johnny Depp) emerges
from the burdens of family hfe to find
love. The performances are excel
lent: Leonard DiCapricio, who plays
Gilbert's mentally retarded brother,
may receive an Oscar nomination
for his riveting work. Above all that,
there's a bunch of neat symbols and
metaphors! PG-13
