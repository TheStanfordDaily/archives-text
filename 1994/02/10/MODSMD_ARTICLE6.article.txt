# ASSU encounters financial troubles
## Less University funds, smaller biz profits 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
The ASSU has entered some
unfamiliar territory lately as re
cent cuts in University funding
and losses from business projects
have put the association in its
worst financial state in years.
Beginning two years ago, the
University began curtailing its
funding of the ASSU. Two years
ago such funding was $154,517,
which was cut to $89,495 last year
and $47,540 this year.
In addition, an unfriendly eco
nomic climate and shortfalls in in
come from business projects have
forced the ASSU to take initia
tives to reevaluate its financial
structure.
"The main problem is the cut in
University funding," said ASSU

financial manager Brian Hillger.
Next year, Hillger said, the Uni
versity funding may be totally
eliminated, significantly affecting
the ASSU budget.
He said the elimination of Uni
versity funding may also lessen
the University administration's
supervisory power over the orga
nization's operations.
"I would anticipate that,
should there be no funding. . . op
erations will be more self-suffi
cient as well," he said.
Council of Presidents member
Ron Brown, a senior, said that
while University funding gives "a
good justification for University
supervision," eliminating that
funding would require the ASSU
to "reevaluate the role (of the ad
ministration] within the frame
work of an independent student
government."
Hillger said another cause of
the ASSU's income decline is low
interest rates, as interest income
from the group's running cash
flow constitutes "a large part" of
ASSU's revenues. Interest
earned on the ASSU's banking
fund, which is used by other stu
dent groups, has declined in the
past few years, he explained.

The ASSU is hoping to reduce
the level of cash kept on-hand by
placing the money in higher
yielding investments. The
increased interest payments
could then be used to fimd ongo
ing ASSU business.
The profits of the ASSU's
business projects have also been
falling short of expectations,
putting the ASSU behind on its
overall budget.
Last year, for example, ASSU
Type and Design experienced a
loss recorded in the ASSU busi
ness schedule as over $20,000.
Hillger emphasized that that fig
ure might not accurately reflect

the actual magnitude of the loss
as the figure did not include
accounts receivable that have
since been recovered.
This year, due to improvements
in operating efficiency, Hillger said
he expects Type and Design as well
as the ASSU's other business pro
jects to operate at a profit,
although the student govern
ment's income is still likely to fall
short of the operating budget.
Hillger said the ASSU hopes to
increase the profits of its business
projects by expanding into new
markets with their current pro
jects while at the same time cut
ting costs.
