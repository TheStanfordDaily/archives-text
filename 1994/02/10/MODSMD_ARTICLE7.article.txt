# Student wins pinball crown
## Defeats 600 competitors in international tournament

He may not be deaf, dumb or blind, but sophomore
Bowen Kerins sure plays a mean pinball.
So mean, in fact, that he shocked the pinball world
last weekend by pulling and paddling his way to vic
tory in the fourth annual International Pinball Asso
ciation championship in New York — the "largest
pinball tournament ever," according to Kerins.
Suddenly, the unassuming native of Newport, R.I.
finds himself caught in a media circus. He's already
been featured in the San Jose Mercury News and on
KRON-TV, but that could prove to be chump change
compared to what lies in store.
"I got a message from the Tonight Show," he said,

Pinball champion Bowen Kerins shows oft his skills in Tresidder Recreation Center yesterday.
Kerins won the fourth annua! International Pinball championship last week.
giddy with the thought of chatting
with Jay Leno. Unless, of course,
Letterman gets him first.
Kerins, a mathematics mtyor,
said his participation in the tour
nament was intended to be only a
diversion from a planned visit with
his family. "I didn't think I had a
chance of winning," he said.
Indeed, Kerins was the youngest of
the 600 competitors and had never
taken part in a national tourna
ment before his triumph late Sun
day night. He suggested that his
anonymity helped him out-tilt his
more famous competitors.
"There wasn't much pressure
because no one knew who I was,"
he said. "I tried to keep my mind
off the tournament."
At one point, Kerins found him
self effectively acting the lead in
"Tommy." "They were pumping

music into the room through loud
speakers — good stuff, like the
Beatles," he said. "I started singing
to the songs while I was competing,
just to take my mind ofT it."
In the final round, Kerins
racked up 3.1 billion points, out
distancing, among others, the
defending champion. He said
about 50 spectators, along with
reporters from CNN, MTV and
ESPN, watched his victory. For
his efforts, Kerins pocketed a cool
$4,000.
Kerins, who plays pinball about
five hours per week at Tresidder
and a local dive called The Key
stone, on El Camino Real, has
been popping quarters into
machines since he was 10. His
longest game lasted two and a half
hours.
He readily concedes that his
game might not please pinball
purists. "Some people play slow
and deliberate — that's really bor
ing for anybody who's watching,"
he said. "If I stop the ball it's only

for half a second. It's silly to do
nothing when people are watching
you find hoping that something
interesting happens."
Despite his current stature as
the wizard of all pinball wizards,
Kerins remains rather modest.
"Some people don't get the hang of
using the flippers at all," he said.
"But with enough practice, anyone
can learn. I guess I just had a 10-
year head start."
But in demonstrating his cham
pionship technique at the Tresid
der game room yesterday, Kerins
— through no intention of his own
— displayed what makes him the
best. While claiming he was play
ing below his ability, Kerins still lit
up the machine, knocking balls
into high-scoring tunnels and
walls with a distracted noncha
lance.
Soon enough he had garnered a
free game. Novice pinball players
might have rejoiced at their good
fortune.
Bo wen Kerins walked away.
