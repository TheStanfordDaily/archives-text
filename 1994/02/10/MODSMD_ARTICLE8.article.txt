says we need to listen to the horses.
The former head of the Environ
mental Protection Agency had the
audience of about 150 in Kresge Au
ditorium chuckling last night when
he spoke of a "new philosophy of
horse training" that he read about,
using it as a metaphor for a new
method of environmental regulation
of businesses.
Just as the new horse trainers have
given up on former strategies of
"breaking the horses' spirits," policy
makers must give up on outdated
strategies of "command and control"
regulation, Reilly said.
They must start working more

closely with industries to find more in
novative means of helping the envi
ronment, he said.
"After all, [businesses! are the ones
who run the races and pay the bills,"
he said.
The speech, titled " 'I'm Gonna
Make You a Star': A New Approach to
Protecting the Environment in Amer
ica and Around the World," is the
third in a series of five lectures by
Reilly presented by the Institute for
International Studies.
Besides his work on a new kind of
environmental policy, Reilly dis
cussed how difficult it is to be a guy
like himself.
"The predominant view of the EPA
in any administration is as an incipi
ent monster," Reilly said. "Environ
mental policy has the capacity for of

fending everybody."
Reilly gave examples of flexible
policies from his stint as administra
tor of the EPA under President Bush.
He cited one of his most noted accom
plishments, the passage of the Clean
Air Act of 1990, as an example of reg
ulation that allows more innovation
on the part of industry.
The anti-acid rain provisions in the
act departed from former policy by
setting a limit on sulfur dioxide emis
sions in terms of a maximum amount
allowed, without specifying what
technology should be used to reduce
them, Reilly said.
This policy, unlike those in the
past, allows companies themselves to
find the reduction measures that are
the most cost-efficient for them.
"They, more than anyone, have the

resources and knowledge to help the
environment," Reilly said of regulated
industries. "We made a genuine com
mitment to commercial performance,
not specific technological prescrip
tions. Conventional command and
control regulation has become very
time-consuming and expensive."
Reilly also spoke about voluntary
self-regulation, another strategy he
used during his term. One example
was a challenge to companies to re
duce emissions of highly toxic chemi
cals such as lead to less than the legal
maximum.
Reilly said politicians, industries
and reporters were initially skeptical
about the lighter approach.
"Journalistic questions amounted
