# Legal Office plans restructuring
## Layoffs, contracting work to outside firms being considered 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Senior staff writer 
Stanford's general counsel is examining
ways to restructure the Legal Office by con
tracting more work to outside law firms, a
move that may result in the layoff's of several
University attorneys.
Although the effort has been billed as a way
to cut costs and enhance services, sources
close to the office predict that a large-scale re
structuring will diminish the quality of legal
services the University receives.
No formal plans have been drawn up yet,
but under one scenario, all of the office's work
would be handled by one or more outside
firms. Other approaches include the use of
outside firms to handle portions of the office's

work or to provide a consulting service to the
University.
" If some firm comes in and says they can do
it for a million less, we have got to pay atten
tion," said General Counsel Michael Roster,
who is spearheading the restructuring effort.
"I have no answer to what the resulting pic
ture may look like. It could well be an office
much smaller than it was a year ago."
The 16-member office presently handles
about 95 percent of the University's legal
work, while the remainder — usually cases
that demand specialists in certain areas — is
sent to outside firms. In previous years more
work was done outside, but University budget
cuts have recently forced the Legal Office to
bring more work in-house to save money.
Now Roster and other top University ad

ministrators are turning that logic on its
head. They contend that by securing multi
year contracts with one or more large law
firms, the University can accomplish its legal
work for less. Such agreements, they say,
would provide the University with access to
more specialists and the informational re
sources available to large firms.
But several people familiar with the office
say that Stanford will be hard pressed to find
an outside firm that will offer, at a lower
cost, the same level and quality of service
that current staff provides. They also argue
that the plans will not result in long-term
savings but rather are part of the University
administration's effort to distance itself
from the indirect-cost debacle.
Bids due Feb. 21
Yesterday, more than 50
lawyers from 12 firms spent the
day in a Medical School classroom
learning about Stanford and the
Legal Office in preparation to bid
on all or a portion of the Univer
sity's legal work.
Possible bidders include the
large Los Angeles law firm Morri
son & Foerster — which Roster
used to work for — and a firm
founded by Board of Trustees
Chair John Friedenrich: Grey,
Carey, Ware & Friedenrich. Also
present at yesterday's forum
were Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro,
a large San Francisco firm, and
Crosby, Heafy, Roach & May, an
Oakland firm, among others.
University attorneys, several
of whom were intentionally
dressed in black, gave presenta
tions about their jobs.
Firms will have an opportuni
ty to make three different bids:
for all of the University's legal
work, for components of the
office's work — such as all litiga
tion or all tax work — and for
providing a "back-up consulting"
service to the office, Roster said.
Roster said the University will
decide which of the three options
to pursue after bids have been
submitted on Feb. 21.
A source close to the office who
refused to be identified said all
three options will involve layoffs.
If all the University's work is "out
sourced" — given to one or more
outside firms — the source said
the office will probably have a
skeleton crew, with a general
counsel and one or two senior
attorneys. The other options will
likely involve retaining more
lawyers on the staff, the source
said.
If all or a portion of the office
is out-sourced, Roster said the
outside attorneys would be
required to work on campus, pre
sumably in the Legal Office's cur
rent space in Building 170.
"A lot of people don't like the
idea of outside counsel because
they feel they won't know them,"
he said. "We will insist they stay
on campus." ,
Roster said Stanford is a lucra
tive client for many firms, espe
cially those not yet based in the
Bay Area who want to get a
foothold in the local market. By
signing one or more firms to a
large, multi-year contract, he
hopes to provide legal services for
a reduced cost.
"We need to get them to real
ize that they want us and get
them to cut prices," he said.
The University currently
spends nearly $5 million a year
on the Legal Office and between
$1 million to $2 million on out
side law firms. According to a
recent internal study, the Legal
Office's work costs the University
about $130 an hour.
Such costs, Roster said, are

"under average" for a university
Stanford's size. Still, he is deter
mined to further reduce costs and
provide the office with added
"elasticity."
"We have to ask ourselves, do
we have the right mix of what
should be done inside vs. what
should be done outside?" he said.
"We are hoping to get more spe
cialization and more expertise
and the ability to easily shift our
resources to where we need
expertise at any given time."
Short-term savings
Talk of staff cutbacks has
many in the Legal Office worried
about their futures, and some
attorneys privately concede such
plans will inevitably cause prob
lems for the University in the
long run.

'We have to ask our
selves, do we have
the right mix of what
should be done
inside vs. what
should be done out
side?'
— Michael Roster

Those close to the office say
the University may be able to
make a deal with one or more
firms at a reduced rate, but those
contracts will only last for two or
three years. When the contracts
are renegotiated, they say, the
firms will have the leverage to
significantly increase their prices.
"The way you deal with that
problem is through competition.
You say, 'we'll take it out to bid
again,' " said John Schwartz,
who was the University's general
counsel for 11 years before leav
ing last year. "But where that
takes you is again starting with
people who don't know the insti
tution."
Schwartz, who now works at
Systemix, a biotechnology firm in
Palo Alto, said issues like labor
relations, faculty tenure cases,
academic fraud and indirect costs
"depend heavily on a relationship
between the lawyers and the Uni
versity."
"How much is continuity
worth? It's a tough decision for
an institution," he said.
Schwartz said an outside firm
may be able to undercut Stanford
costs — but with a reduction in
quality. Large legal offices, he
said, would likely use "junior
attorneys" at Stanford.
Others close to the office said
the myriad demands placed on
the Legal Office by various parts
of the University, such as infor
mal phone calls regarding legal
issues or a solid understanding of
institutional history, also have
not been taken into account in

restructuring plans.
"The people making the deci
sions here don't have a firm grasp
of what this office does. We're
always being tapped for advice,
for counsel, by faculty, staff and
students," one source said. "It's
not clear, that given the Universi
ty's demands over our services,
that this will, in reality, be an
economic blessing."
Political motivations?
The office's recent growth,
however, has come under fire
from many within the University.
In the late 19705, Schwartz con
solidated the 13 attorneys work
ing in various parts of the Uni
versity in Building 170. The num
bers of lawyers in the office
Deaked at 20, with a correspond
ing increase in support staff.
"Faculty in any University
always feel that too much money
is being spent on administration,
and unless they have worked
with the Legal Office, many fac
ulty don't really know what the
office does," Schwartz said.
Others familiar with the office
also privately question whether
Stanford's indirect-cost debacle
and long-standing personality
conflicts have provided some of
the impetus to restructure the
office.
"The current administration
has gone out of its way to eschew
everything that has come before,
to say that this is now and things
like indirect costs are clearly
behind us. They want to say the
people involved are gone, that
we've purged the old guard," said
a staff member close to the Legal
Office.
Another official also called the
restructuring "political."
"I think a large part of it is

'How much is conti
nuity worth? It's a
tough decision for an
institution.'
— Jim Schwartz

political," the source said. "There
is this feeling that we need a
change after the indirect-cost
mess."
But Roster, who spent six
years at Morrison & Foerster
before coming to Stanford last
summer, said the idea to re-engi
neer the office started with him
and was based on his experience
in the private sector.
"I think it will be valuable for
the University to see what people
do in outside firms and see if we
can apply some of them here," he
said.
With 16 attorneys, Stanford
has one of the largest university
legal offices nationwide. Harvard
University, which has the largest
general counsel's office among
Ivy League schools, has 10 attor

neys on staff.
Some Stanford administrators
say the University needs a large
office because Stanford is like a
small city, complete with a hospi
tal, research facilities, extensive
student and faculty residences,
and 8,100 acres of land.
But now, many universities
are looking at ways to down-size
their legal operations to cut costs,
said Beverley Ledbetter, Brown's
general counsel and past presi
dent of the National Association
of College and University Attor
neys.
"In the '80s, people built up
their in-house staffs, but now
they are realizing that there is
some point at which the effective
ness of that ceases to be effec
tive," Ledbetter said.
At USC, officials decided last
year to gut their eight-attorney
legal office, replacing it with one
general counsel and two parale
gals who farm work out to sever
al outside firms.
"As far as I'm able to deter
mine, it has been effective," said
Robert Lane, USC's recently
appointed general counsel. "The
law is complex, and we're seeking
individual experts in certain
areas."
But Lane said it is still "too
early to tell" whether the univer
sity's decision will save money.
He stressed that the change was
motivated more by a desire to
"improve efficiency" than to cut
costs.
Outside expertise
Roster said he is exploring
options for change for reasons
other than controlling costs,
including providing the Universi
ty with better legal service.
After meeting with more than
50 faculty, administrators and
trustees when he was interviewed
for the general counsel position
last spring, Roster said he heard
"a widespread consensus among
[those he talked to] that they
wanted a little more outside
expertise."
"People I talked to raved
about the quality of the office,
but what I was hearing at times
was that, if there was any defect,
it was we did not the have exper
tise we needed in certain areas,"
he said.
Roster said he has been trying
to employ innovative ideas in
restructuring the office. For
example, he said that most large
firms do not have opportunities
for their junior associates to per
form litigation work, and that
such firms may agree to provide
litigation services to the Univer
sity at or below cost using junior
attorneys. But, he cautioned that
younger lawyers would be closely
supervised by senior associates or
partners.
"I am trying to look at a vari
ety of incentives and ways we can
work with outside firms," he said.
4 A lack of respect'
Regardless of any perceived

lack of experience in certain
areas, the attorneys on staff have
amassed an unblemished record
in court since the office was con
solidated.
Although the University has
settled numerous cases out of
court, Stanford has not lost a case
at the trial court level in the last
15 years.
They commend Roster and
other top administrators for their
desire to critically examine how
the office operates, but question
what will happen to long-term
University employees who work
in the office.
"I don't know anyone here
who doesn't agree that it's fine to
rethink things," said one individ
ual close to the office. "But we

resent the implication that every
thing that came before, just
because it came before, must be
changed. It's just a lack of respect
for the people who have chosen to
make Stanford its family."
If officials decide to go forward
with a large-scale restructuring,
several of the office's attorneys
may attempt to seek employment
with the new firm, the source
said.
Roster said personnel con
cerns will not influence his deci
sion to rethink the way the office
works.
"The fact that people have
been here for a long time is not a
factor," he said. "We have to look
at what's in the best interests of
the institution."
Stanford's general counsel is examining
ways to restructure the Legal Office by con
tracting more work to outside law firms, a
move that may result in the layoff's of several
University attorneys.
Although the effort has been billed as a way
to cut costs and enhance services, sources

recent internal study, the Legal
Office's work costs the University
about $130 an hour.
Such costs, Roster said, are

"under average" for a university
Stanford's size. Still, he is deter
mined to further reduce costs and
provide the office with added
"elasticity."
"We have to ask ourselves, do
we have the right mix of what
should be done inside vs. what
should be done outside?" he said.
"We are hoping to get more spe
cialization and more expertise
and the ability to easily shift our
resources to where we need
expertise at any given time."
Short-term savings
Talk of staff cutbacks has
many in the Legal Office worried
about their futures, and some
attorneys privately concede such
plans will inevitably cause prob
lems for the University in the
long run.

selves, do we have
the right mix of what
should be done
inside vs. what
should be done out
side?'
— Michael Roster

Those close to the office say
the University may be able to
make a deal with one or more
firms at a reduced rate, but those
contracts will only last for two or
three years. When the contracts
are renegotiated, they say, the
firms will have the leverage to
significantly increase their prices.
"The way you deal with that
problem is through competition.
You say, 'we'll take it out to bid
again,' " said John Schwartz,
who was the University's general
counsel for 11 years before leav
ing last year. "But where that
takes you is again starting with
people who don't know the insti
tution."
Schwartz, who now works at
Systemix, a biotechnology firm in
Palo Alto, said issues like labor
relations, faculty tenure cases,
academic fraud and indirect costs
"depend heavily on a relationship
between the lawyers and the Uni
versity."
"How much is continuity
worth? It's a tough decision for
an institution," he said.
Schwartz said an outside firm
may be able to undercut Stanford
costs — but with a reduction in
quality. Large legal offices, he
said, would likely use "junior
attorneys" at Stanford.
Others close to the office said
the myriad demands placed on
the Legal Office by various parts
of the University, such as infor
mal phone calls regarding legal
issues or a solid understanding of
institutional history, also have
not been taken into account in

restructuring plans.
"The people making the deci
sions here don't have a firm grasp
of what this office does. We're
always being tapped for advice,
for counsel, by faculty, staff and
students," one source said. "It's
not clear, that given the Universi
ty's demands over our services,
that this will, in reality, be an
economic blessing."
Political motivations?
The office's recent growth,
however, has come under fire
from many within the University.
In the late 19705, Schwartz con
solidated the 13 attorneys work
ing in various parts of the Uni
versity in Building 170. The num
bers of lawyers in the office
Deaked at 20, with a correspond
ing increase in support staff.
"Faculty in any University
always feel that too much money
is being spent on administration,
and unless they have worked
with the Legal Office, many fac
ulty don't really know what the
office does," Schwartz said.
Others familiar with the office
also privately question whether
Stanford's indirect-cost debacle
and long-standing personality
conflicts have provided some of
the impetus to restructure the
office.
"The current administration
has gone out of its way to eschew
everything that has come before,
to say that this is now and things
like indirect costs are clearly
behind us. They want to say the
people involved are gone, that
we've purged the old guard," said
a staff member close to the Legal
Office.
Another official also called the
restructuring "political."
"I think a large part of it is

'How much is conti
nuity worth? It's a
tough decision for an
institution.'
— Jim Schwartz

political," the source said. "There
is this feeling that we need a
change after the indirect-cost
mess."
But Roster, who spent six
years at Morrison & Foerster
before coming to Stanford last
summer, said the idea to re-engi
neer the office started with him
and was based on his experience
in the private sector.
"I think it will be valuable for
the University to see what people
do in outside firms and see if we
can apply some of them here," he
said.
With 16 attorneys, Stanford
has one of the largest university
legal offices nationwide. Harvard
University, which has the largest
general counsel's office among
Ivy League schools, has 10 attor

neys on staff.
Some Stanford administrators
say the University needs a large
office because Stanford is like a
small city, complete with a hospi
tal, research facilities, extensive
student and faculty residences,
and 8,100 acres of land.
But now, many universities
are looking at ways to down-size
their legal operations to cut costs,
said Beverley Ledbetter, Brown's
general counsel and past presi
dent of the National Association
of College and University Attor
neys.
"In the '80s, people built up
their in-house staffs, but now
they are realizing that there is
some point at which the effective
ness of that ceases to be effec
tive," Ledbetter said.
At USC, officials decided last
year to gut their eight-attorney
legal office, replacing it with one
general counsel and two parale
gals who farm work out to sever
al outside firms.
"As far as I'm able to deter
mine, it has been effective," said
Robert Lane, USC's recently
appointed general counsel. "The
law is complex, and we're seeking
individual experts in certain
areas."
But Lane said it is still "too
early to tell" whether the univer
sity's decision will save money.
He stressed that the change was
motivated more by a desire to
"improve efficiency" than to cut
costs.
Outside expertise
Roster said he is exploring
options for change for reasons
other than controlling costs,
including providing the Universi
ty with better legal service.
After meeting with more than
50 faculty, administrators and
trustees when he was interviewed
for the general counsel position
last spring, Roster said he heard
"a widespread consensus among
[those he talked to] that they
wanted a little more outside
expertise."
"People I talked to raved
about the quality of the office,
but what I was hearing at times
was that, if there was any defect,
it was we did not the have exper
tise we needed in certain areas,"
he said.
Roster said he has been trying
to employ innovative ideas in
restructuring the office. For
example, he said that most large
firms do not have opportunities
for their junior associates to per
form litigation work, and that
such firms may agree to provide
litigation services to the Univer
sity at or below cost using junior
attorneys. But, he cautioned that
younger lawyers would be closely
supervised by senior associates or
partners.
"I am trying to look at a vari
ety of incentives and ways we can
work with outside firms," he said.
4 A lack of respect'
Regardless of any perceived

lack of experience in certain
areas, the attorneys on staff have
amassed an unblemished record
in court since the office was con
solidated.
Although the University has
settled numerous cases out of
court, Stanford has not lost a case
at the trial court level in the last
15 years.
They commend Roster and
other top administrators for their
desire to critically examine how
the office operates, but question
what will happen to long-term
University employees who work
in the office.
"I don't know anyone here
who doesn't agree that it's fine to
rethink things," said one individ
ual close to the office. "But we

resent the implication that every
thing that came before, just
because it came before, must be
changed. It's just a lack of respect
for the people who have chosen to
make Stanford its family."
If officials decide to go forward
with a large-scale restructuring,
several of the office's attorneys
may attempt to seek employment
with the new firm, the source
said.
Roster said personnel con
cerns will not influence his deci
sion to rethink the way the office
works.
"The fact that people have
been here for a long time is not a
factor," he said. "We have to look
at what's in the best interests of
the institution."
Stanford's general counsel is examining
ways to restructure the Legal Office by con
tracting more work to outside law firms, a
move that may result in the layoff's of several
University attorneys.
Although the effort has been billed as a way
to cut costs and enhance services, sources
close to the office predict that a large-scale re
structuring will diminish the quality of legal
services the University receives.
No formal plans have been drawn up yet,
but under one scenario, all of the office's work
would be handled by one or more outside
firms. Other approaches include the use of
outside firms to handle portions of the office's

work or to provide a consulting service to the
University.
" If some firm comes in and says they can do
it for a million less, we have got to pay atten
tion," said General Counsel Michael Roster,
who is spearheading the restructuring effort.
"I have no answer to what the resulting pic
ture may look like. It could well be an office
much smaller than it was a year ago."
The 16-member office presently handles
about 95 percent of the University's legal
work, while the remainder — usually cases
that demand specialists in certain areas — is
sent to outside firms. In previous years more
work was done outside, but University budget
cuts have recently forced the Legal Office to
bring more work in-house to save money.
Now Roster and other top University ad

ministrators are turning that logic on its
head. They contend that by securing multi
year contracts with one or more large law
firms, the University can accomplish its legal
work for less. Such agreements, they say,
would provide the University with access to
more specialists and the informational re
sources available to large firms.
But several people familiar with the office
say that Stanford will be hard pressed to find
an outside firm that will offer, at a lower
cost, the same level and quality of service
that current staff provides. They also argue
that the plans will not result in long-term
savings but rather are part of the University
administration's effort to distance itself
from the indirect-cost debacle.
Bids due Feb. 21
Yesterday, more than 50
lawyers from 12 firms spent the
day in a Medical School classroom
learning about Stanford and the
Legal Office in preparation to bid
on all or a portion of the Univer
sity's legal work.
Possible bidders include the
large Los Angeles law firm Morri
son & Foerster — which Roster
used to work for — and a firm
founded by Board of Trustees
Chair John Friedenrich: Grey,
Carey, Ware & Friedenrich. Also
present at yesterday's forum
were Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro,
a large San Francisco firm, and
Crosby, Heafy, Roach & May, an
Oakland firm, among others.
University attorneys, several
of whom were intentionally
dressed in black, gave presenta
tions about their jobs.
Firms will have an opportuni
ty to make three different bids:
for all of the University's legal
work, for components of the
office's work — such as all litiga
tion or all tax work — and for
providing a "back-up consulting"
service to the office, Roster said.
Roster said the University will
decide which of the three options
to pursue after bids have been
submitted on Feb. 21.
A source close to the office who
refused to be identified said all
three options will involve layoffs.
If all the University's work is "out
sourced" — given to one or more
outside firms — the source said
the office will probably have a
skeleton crew, with a general
counsel and one or two senior
attorneys. The other options will
likely involve retaining more
lawyers on the staff, the source
said.
If all or a portion of the office
is out-sourced, Roster said the
outside attorneys would be
required to work on campus, pre
sumably in the Legal Office's cur
rent space in Building 170.
"A lot of people don't like the
idea of outside counsel because
they feel they won't know them,"
he said. "We will insist they stay
on campus." ,
Roster said Stanford is a lucra
tive client for many firms, espe
cially those not yet based in the
Bay Area who want to get a
foothold in the local market. By
signing one or more firms to a
large, multi-year contract, he
hopes to provide legal services for
a reduced cost.
"We need to get them to real
ize that they want us and get
them to cut prices," he said.
The University currently
spends nearly $5 million a year
on the Legal Office and between
$1 million to $2 million on out
side law firms. According to a
recent internal study, the Legal
Office's work costs the University
about $130 an hour.
Such costs, Roster said, are

"under average" for a university
Stanford's size. Still, he is deter
mined to further reduce costs and
provide the office with added
"elasticity."
"We have to ask ourselves, do
we have the right mix of what
should be done inside vs. what
should be done outside?" he said.
"We are hoping to get more spe

resources to where we need
expertise at any given time."

said.
With 16 attorneys, Stanford
has one of the largest university
legal offices nationwide. Harvard
University, which has the largest
general counsel's office among
Ivy League schools, has 10 attor

neys on staff.
Some Stanford administrators
say the University needs a large
office because Stanford is like a
small city, complete with a hospi
tal, research facilities, extensive
student and faculty residences,
and 8,100 acres of land.
But now, many universities
are looking at ways to down-size
their legal operations to cut costs,
said Beverley Ledbetter, Brown's
general counsel and past presi
dent of the National Association
of College and University Attor
neys.
"In the '80s, people built up
their in-house staffs, but now
they are realizing that there is
some point at which the effective
ness of that ceases to be effec
tive," Ledbetter said.
At USC, officials decided last
year to gut their eight-attorney
legal office, replacing it with one
general counsel and two parale
gals who farm work out to sever
al outside firms.
"As far as I'm able to deter
mine, it has been effective," said
Robert Lane, USC's recently
appointed general counsel. "The
law is complex, and we're seeking
individual experts in certain
areas."
But Lane said it is still "too
early to tell" whether the univer
sity's decision will save money.
He stressed that the change was
motivated more by a desire to
"improve efficiency" than to cut
costs.
Outside expertise
Roster said he is exploring
options for change for reasons
other than controlling costs,
including providing the Universi
ty with better legal service.
After meeting with more than
50 faculty, administrators and
trustees when he was interviewed
for the general counsel position
last spring, Roster said he heard
"a widespread consensus among
[those he talked to] that they
wanted a little more outside
expertise."
"People I talked to raved
about the quality of the office,
but what I was hearing at times
was that, if there was any defect,
it was we did not the have exper
tise we needed in certain areas,"
he said.
Roster said he has been trying
to employ innovative ideas in
restructuring the office. For
example, he said that most large
firms do not have opportunities
for their junior associates to per
form litigation work, and that
such firms may agree to provide
litigation services to the Univer
sity at or below cost using junior
attorneys. But, he cautioned that
younger lawyers would be closely
supervised by senior associates or
partners.
"I am trying to look at a vari
ety of incentives and ways we can
work with outside firms," he said.
4 A lack of respect'
Regardless of any perceived

lack of experience in certain
areas, the attorneys on staff have
amassed an unblemished record
in court since the office was con
solidated.
Although the University has
settled numerous cases out of
court, Stanford has not lost a case
at the trial court level in the last
15 years.
They commend Roster and
other top administrators for their
desire to critically examine how
the office operates, but question
what will happen to long-term
University employees who work
in the office.
"I don't know anyone here
who doesn't agree that it's fine to
rethink things," said one individ
ual close to the office. "But we

resent the implication that every
thing that came before, just
because it came before, must be
changed. It's just a lack of respect
for the people who have chosen to
make Stanford its family."
If officials decide to go forward
with a large-scale restructuring,
several of the office's attorneys
may attempt to seek employment
with the new firm, the source
said.
Roster said personnel con
cerns will not influence his deci
sion to rethink the way the office
works.
"The fact that people have
been here for a long time is not a
factor," he said. "We have to look
at what's in the best interests of
the institution."
Stanford's general counsel is examining
ways to restructure the Legal Office by con
tracting more work to outside law firms, a
move that may result in the layoff's of several
University attorneys.
Although the effort has been billed as a way
to cut costs and enhance services, sources
close to the office predict that a large-scale re
structuring will diminish the quality of legal
services the University receives.
No formal plans have been drawn up yet,
but under one scenario, all of the office's work
would be handled by one or more outside
firms. Other approaches include the use of
outside firms to handle portions of the office's

work or to provide a consulting service to the
University.
" If some firm comes in and says they can do
it for a million less, we have got to pay atten
tion," said General Counsel Michael Roster,
who is spearheading the restructuring effort.
"I have no answer to what the resulting pic
ture may look like. It could well be an office
much smaller than it was a year ago."
The 16-member office presently handles
about 95 percent of the University's legal
work, while the remainder — usually cases
that demand specialists in certain areas — is
sent to outside firms. In previous years more
work was done outside, but University budget
cuts have recently forced the Legal Office to
bring more work in-house to save money.
Now Roster and other top University ad

ministrators are turning that logic on its
head. They contend that by securing multi
year contracts with one or more large law
firms, the University can accomplish its legal
work for less. Such agreements, they say,
would provide the University with access to
more specialists and the informational re
sources available to large firms.
But several people familiar with the office
say that Stanford will be hard pressed to find
an outside firm that will offer, at a lower
cost, the same level and quality of service
that current staff provides. They also argue
that the plans will not result in long-term
savings but rather are part of the University
administration's effort to distance itself
from the indirect-cost debacle.
Bids due Feb. 21
Yesterday, more than 50
lawyers from 12 firms spent the
day in a Medical School classroom
learning about Stanford and the
Legal Office in preparation to bid
on all or a portion of the Univer
sity's legal work.
Possible bidders include the
large Los Angeles law firm Morri
son & Foerster — which Roster
used to work for — and a firm
founded by Board of Trustees
Chair John Friedenrich: Grey,
Carey, Ware & Friedenrich. Also
present at yesterday's forum
were Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro,
a large San Francisco firm, and
Crosby, Heafy, Roach & May, an
Oakland firm, among others.
University attorneys, several
of whom were intentionally
dressed in black, gave presenta
tions about their jobs.
Firms will have an opportuni
ty to make three different bids:
for all of the University's legal
work, for components of the
office's work — such as all litiga
tion or all tax work — and for
providing a "back-up consulting"
service to the office, Roster said.
Roster said the University will
decide which of the three options
to pursue after bids have been
submitted on Feb. 21.
A source close to the office who
refused to be identified said all
three options will involve layoffs.
If all the University's work is "out
sourced" — given to one or more
outside firms — the source said
the office will probably have a
skeleton crew, with a general
counsel and one or two senior
attorneys. The other options will
likely involve retaining more
lawyers on the staff, the source
said.
If all or a portion of the office
is out-sourced, Roster said the
outside attorneys would be
required to work on campus, pre
sumably in the Legal Office's cur
rent space in Building 170.
"A lot of people don't like the
idea of outside counsel because
they feel they won't know them,"
he said. "We will insist they stay
on campus." ,
Roster said Stanford is a lucra
tive client for many firms, espe
cially those not yet based in the
Bay Area who want to get a
foothold in the local market. By
signing one or more firms to a
large, multi-year contract, he
hopes to provide legal services for
a reduced cost.
"We need to get them to real
ize that they want us and get
them to cut prices," he said.
The University currently
spends nearly $5 million a year
on the Legal Office and between
$1 million to $2 million on out
side law firms. According to a
recent internal study, the Legal
Office's work costs the University
about $130 an hour.
Such costs, Roster said, are

"under average" for a university
Stanford's size. Still, he is deter
mined to further reduce costs and
provide the office with added
"elasticity."
"We have to ask ourselves, do
we have the right mix of what
should be done inside vs. what
should be done outside?" he said.
"We are hoping to get more spe
cialization and more expertise
and the ability to easily shift our
resources to where we need
expertise at any given time."
Short-term savings
Talk of staff cutbacks has
many in the Legal Office worried
about their futures, and some
attorneys privately concede such
plans will inevitably cause prob
lems for the University in the
long run.

'We have to ask our
selves, do we have
the right mix of what
should be done
inside vs. what
should be done out
side?'
— Michael Roster

Those close to the office say
the University may be able to
make a deal with one or more
firms at a reduced rate, but those
contracts will only last for two or
three years. When the contracts
are renegotiated, they say, the
firms will have the leverage to
significantly increase their prices.
"The way you deal with that
problem is through competition.
You say, 'we'll take it out to bid
again,' " said John Schwartz,
who was the University's general
counsel for 11 years before leav
ing last year. "But where that
takes you is again starting with
people who don't know the insti
tution."
Schwartz, who now works at
Systemix, a biotechnology firm in
Palo Alto, said issues like labor
relations, faculty tenure cases,
academic fraud and indirect costs
"depend heavily on a relationship
between the lawyers and the Uni
versity."
"How much is continuity
worth? It's a tough decision for
an institution," he said.
Schwartz said an outside firm
may be able to undercut Stanford
costs — but with a reduction in
quality. Large legal offices, he
said, would likely use "junior
attorneys" at Stanford.
Others close to the office said
the myriad demands placed on
the Legal Office by various parts
of the University, such as infor
mal phone calls regarding legal
issues or a solid understanding of
institutional history, also have
not been taken into account in

restructuring plans.
"The people making the deci
sions here don't have a firm grasp
of what this office does. We're
always being tapped for advice,
for counsel, by faculty, staff and
students," one source said. "It's
not clear, that given the Universi
ty's demands over our services,
that this will, in reality, be an
economic blessing."
Political motivations?
The office's recent growth,
however, has come under fire
from many within the University.
In the late 19705, Schwartz con
solidated the 13 attorneys work
ing in various parts of the Uni
versity in Building 170. The num
bers of lawyers in the office
Deaked at 20, with a correspond
ing increase in support staff.
"Faculty in any University
always feel that too much money
is being spent on administration,
and unless they have worked
with the Legal Office, many fac
ulty don't really know what the
office does," Schwartz said.
Others familiar with the office
also privately question whether
Stanford's indirect-cost debacle
and long-standing personality
conflicts have provided some of
the impetus to restructure the
office.
"The current administration
has gone out of its way to eschew
everything that has come before,
to say that this is now and things
like indirect costs are clearly
behind us. They want to say the
people involved are gone, that
we've purged the old guard," said
a staff member close to the Legal
Office.
Another official also called the
restructuring "political."
"I think a large part of it is

'How much is conti
nuity worth? It's a
tough decision for an
institution.'
— Jim Schwartz

political," the source said. "There
is this feeling that we need a
change after the indirect-cost
mess."
But Roster, who spent six
years at Morrison & Foerster
before coming to Stanford last
summer, said the idea to re-engi
neer the office started with him
and was based on his experience
in the private sector.
"I think it will be valuable for
the University to see what people
do in outside firms and see if we
can apply some of them here," he
said.
With 16 attorneys, Stanford
has one of the largest university
legal offices nationwide. Harvard
University, which has the largest
general counsel's office among
Ivy League schools, has 10 attor

neys on staff.
