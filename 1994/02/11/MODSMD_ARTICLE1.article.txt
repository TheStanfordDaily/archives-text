# Legal Office plans restructuring
## Layoffs, contracting work to outside firms being considered 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Senior staff writer 
Stanford's general counsel is examining
ways to restructure the Legal Office by con
tracting more work to outside law firms, a
move that may result in the layoff's of several
University attorneys.
Although the effort has been billed as a way
to cut costs and enhance services, sources
close to the office predict that a large-scale re
structuring will diminish the quality of legal
services the University receives.
No formal plans have been drawn up yet,
but under one scenario, all of the office's work
would be handled by one or more outside
firms. Other approaches include the use of
outside firms to handle portions of the office's

work or to provide a consulting service to the
University.
" If some firm comes in and says they can do
it for a million less, we have got to pay atten
tion," said General Counsel Michael Roster,
who is spearheading the restructuring effort.
"I have no answer to what the resulting pic
ture may look like. It could well be an office
much smaller than it was a year ago."
The 16-member office presently handles
about 95 percent of the University's legal
work, while the remainder — usually cases
that demand specialists in certain areas — is
sent to outside firms. In previous years more
work was done outside, but University budget
cuts have recently forced the Legal Office to
bring more work in-house to save money.
Now Roster and other top University ad

ministrators are turning that logic on its
head. They contend that by securing multi
year contracts with one or more large law
firms, the University can accomplish its legal
work for less. Such agreements, they say,
would provide the University with access to
more specialists and the informational re
sources available to large firms.
But several people familiar with the office
say that Stanford will be hard pressed to find
an outside firm that will offer, at a lower
cost, the same level and quality of service
that current staff provides. They also argue
that the plans will not result in long-term
savings but rather are part of the University
administration's effort to distance itself
