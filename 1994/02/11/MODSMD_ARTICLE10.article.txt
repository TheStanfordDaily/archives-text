## U.N. troops enforce Sarajevo truce 
### 
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) â€” Sarajevo fell quiet at noon yes
terday after a cease-fire called by besieg
ing Serb troops took effect under the
threat of NATO air strikes. Children
poked out of shell-scarred buildings and
ventured onto streets and playgrounds
near the front lines.
French peacekeepers and armored
vehicles took up positions to monitor the
truce with orders to shoot back if fired
upon. They apparently will act as a trip
wire for other NATO threats to call in
air power to protect U.N. troops or to
immediately retaliate for any renewed
shelling of the city.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion would need a one-time authoriza
tion from U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali or his special
envoy to former Yugoslavia to begin
attacks.
In Geneva, where leaders of Bosnia's
factions gathered for new peace talks,

Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic
threatened a walkout. He demanded a
public investigation of a mortar shelling
Saturday that killed 68 people in central
Sarajevo and prompted the threat of
NATO intervention.
While suspicion has fallen on the
Serbs, Karadzic claims it was a setup by
Bosnia's Muslim-led government to kill
its own people, blame the Serbs and win
international sympathy.
But Karadzic's generals cooperated
with U.N. soldiers to put a cease-fire into
effect at noon.
One French tank and six armored
cars lined up on the infamous "Sniper
Alley" near the Brotherhood and Unity
Bridge, with cannon and heavy machine
guns pointing toward Serb positions
across the Miljacka River. U.N. officials
said the soldiers had orders to shoot
back if fired upon.
The cease-fire got off to a better start
than many of the dozens of others that

have failed. The U.N. commander, Lt.
Gen. Sir Michael Rose of Britain, said "It
is a small beginning," Rose said. "So far
so good, but it is a very early stage."
But the cease fire was not without
problems. A government soldier, Jusim
Kulenovic, was wounded by a machine
gun bullet that hit both his legs about
four hours after the truce began. Kulen
ovic, who was posted about a half-mile
from the Brotherhood and Friendship
Bridge, could lose his left leg, doctors at
Sarajevo's main hospital said.
Rose said he gained a verbal agree
ment from the Serbs in talks Wednesday
to put their heavy weapons under U.N.
control, but not to move them at least 13
miles from Sarajevo as demanded by
NATO.
Gen. Manojlo Milovanovic, the Bosni
an Serb officer who negotiated the
agreement with Rose, was quoted as say
ing that "the withdrawal of the artillery
is out of the question."
