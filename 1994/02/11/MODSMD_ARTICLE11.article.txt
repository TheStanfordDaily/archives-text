# Clinton talks tough on Japanese trade
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - On the eve
of a summit meeting with Japan's new
leader, President Clinton's administra
tion took a hard line yesterday on a bit
ter trade dispute between the two
nations. Officials insisted the United
States would not accept a bad deal just
to get a face-saving agreement.
As negotiators worked behind the
scenes to try to bridge the differences,
various administration officials said the
United States could no longer tolerate a
trade deficit with Japan that has soared
by 20 percent in just one year and is
nearing $60 billion.
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa
was scheduled to arrive in Washington
late yesterday and to meet with Clinton
at the White House today for talks cen
tering on trade.
Clinton reached an agreement with
the Japanese last July that this meeting
would be the deadline for obtaining
market-opening agreements in four
areas — autos and auto parts, insur
ance, telecommunications equipment
and medical products.
However, the talks have deadlocked

over U.S. insistence on "objective crite -
ria" to measure progress. Numerical
benchmarks are needed to make sure
the new agreements have teeth and do
not end up like previous U.S.-Japanese
accords in failing to produce demonstra
ble increases in American sales, negotia
tors have said.
In an effort to break the logjam, the
Japanese sent Foreign Minister Tsuto
mu Hata a day early for a round of meet
ings with U.S. Trade Representative
Mickey Kantor, Secretary of State War
ren Christopher and Vice President A 1
Gore.
After an hour-long meeting with
Christopher, Hata said the Japanese
side was still optimistic that the dispute
could be resolved in time for Clinton
and Hosokawa to announce agree
ments.
However, Christopher sounded a
much more pessimistic tone, saying the
United States was disappointed that
with only a few hours to go before the
Clinton-Hosokawa meeting, there had
not been only "scant progress" in any
market-opening talks.

Asked what would happen if there is
no breakthrough, Christopher said,
"The United States is determined that
we would redress the great imbalance in
our trade and we will seek in a deter
mined way access for American busi
nesses in the Japanese market."
Other U.S. officials have raised the
specter of hitting Japan with trade sanc
tions if the framework talks do not suc
ceed, an outcome that most certainly
would spark retaliation from Japan and
plunge the world's two largest
economies into a full-fledged trade war.
This approach has been blasted as
"managed trade" by the Japanese.
Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers con
firmed that Clinton had met Tuesday
night with a secret Japanese envoy, Aki
tane Kiuchi, a former ambassador to
several countries, who was dispatched
by Hosokawa to determine whether
there was any basis for compromise.
He met with both Clinton and Gore.
U.S. officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he was told the United
States would insist on benchmarks
being included in the agreements.
