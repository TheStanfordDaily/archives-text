Israel-PLO pact incomplete
JERUSALEM (AP) â€” Despite a break
through in PLO-Israel talks, Israel's
prime minister Yitzhak Rabin said today
it would take at least a month to finalize
an agreement, and there would be no pris
oner releases or Israeli troop withdrawal
until then.
PLO leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres initialed
an agreement yesterday in Cairo, Egypt,
resolving security issues that had
blocked the start of Palestinian autono
my for two months.
New rounds of negotiations, expected
to be a lot less difficult than the previous
wrangle, will now begin.
The talks will attempt to settle differ
ences over several administrative issues,
trade policy, plans for Palestinian elec
tions tentatively scheduled for July, and
the size and legislative powers of a Pales
tinian self-rule authority in Gaza and
Jericho.
Rabin and Arafat would meet after

agreement was reached on all issues.
They will decide the size of the Jericho
autonomy enclave.
Study: Kids like beer ads
WASHINGTON (AP) - Those fun
filled beer commercials at halftime may be
influencing children to drink, according to
research that found fifth-graders reciting
slogans, reeling off brand names and saying
they intended to drink frequently later in
life.
"Their beliefs are being influenced, their
beliefs about the positive consequences of
drinking," said Joel Grube of the govern
ment's National Institute of Alcohol Abuse
and Alcoholism's Prevention Research
Center. Researchers counted 685 alcohol
ads during 122 televised sporting events.
Some researchers have linked drinking
among teenagers to exposure to ads. The
industry insists that it doesn't target
underage consumers and that even if
minors are exposed to the ads, it doesn't
influence their behavior.
