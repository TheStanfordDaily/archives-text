After rejecting WASC's
criteria, Stanford can't
forget diversity efforts

NO ONE denied the impor
tance of diversity at last
week's Faculty Senate dis
cussion. Yet the Western Associa
tion of Schools and Colleges' state
ment on diversity was unanimously
opposed.
And while at first glance, express
ing opposition to a diversity state
ment seems a dangerous step, the
senate's actions are well justified.
The real issue at hand was gov
ernance and autonomy. What right
did an outside academic review
panel have to judge schools on
diversity?
At the same time, though, as the
University rejects the notion of
diversity standards imposed by an
external review panel, it should
take this opportunity to redouble
efforts to live up to its own high
expectations.
WASC is a regional body of facul
ty members who accredit Stanford
and other west-coast institutions
based on academic criteria. All
schools must be a part of an accred
iting agency in order for their stu
dents to receive financial aid loans.
In its statement on diversity,
WASC said that the accreditation
process should consider certain
diversity criteria as well. However,
it allows for different interpreta
tions of diversity standards for dif
ferent schools, such as vocational,
religious, single-sex and two-year
institutions.
For example, it states that "reli

gious institutions have the right to
select students and faculty on the
basis of adherence to religious
beliefs," which in effect condones
discrimination based on sexual ori
entation.
While diversity is an important
issue in educational institutions,
the accrediting group's contradicto
ry ways detract from its signifi
cance. In addition, accrediting
agencies have received increasing
criticism about their inability to
handle even their academic and
financial-aid related evaluations.
And an academic accrediting
body, regardless of its intentions,
has no standing to judge schools on
diversity. The measure, if approved,
would also create an inordinate
amount of paperwork in the evalu
ation process.
The statement therefore ends up
as an intrusion upon universities'
autonomy and a feeble attempt to
usurp power.
However, as Stanford has clearly
rejected such intrusion from an
external agency, it should reaffirm
the commitments it has made to its
own diversity and academic stan
dards.
Stanford has always been a lead
er in diversity. And it should keep
up its efforts to ensure that it does
not fall behind. As demonstrated in
various reports this year, it has
recently fallen short in some areas
such as minority graduate stu
dents, as well as minority and
women faculty.
While Stanford was right to
reject a set of vague and vacillating
diversity standards from an outside
organization, it should now use this
occasion to refocus internally on
meeting its own standards.
