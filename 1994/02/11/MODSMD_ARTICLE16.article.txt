## Don't belittle students who take the corporate route 
### 
I READ WITH interest Liz Gorgue's
Feb. 8 column, "Stanford goes corpo
rate." Sadly enough, Liz is not the
only one who has "the overwhelming
urge to mow down" America's corporate
types on campus. Yes, it is that time of
year again, when Stanford students get a
harsh taste of the "real" world, and real
ize that there are different standards out
there. Many Stanford students choose to
go to graduate or professional schools;
many others choose to go out into the
work force. But whatever they choose to
do, that choice must be respected.
As a junior trying to decide whether to
get a job or go to graduate school after
college, I fail to understand why it is
acceptable and somehow "OK" to rag on
the students who go out into the work
force and "corporate America" in gener
al. We at Stanford are so caught up in
changing the world that we sometimes
fail to appreciate it as it is. Corporate
America is not only responsible for trash
ing the environment; it is also responsi
ble for sustaining America's economy, for
supporting research institutions, gradu
ate schools, labs, professional schools (we
see evidence of all this at Stanford) and
for producing the things that make it
possible for an industrial society to exist.
Stanford doesn't go corporate once a
year, by the way. Stanford's been "corpo
rate" for a while. Ever since one of the
California Big Four converted a stud
farm into a university in his son's memo
ry. Ever since two engineering students
at Stanford started a small business that

became a billion-dollar company and
spawned Silicon Valley. Stanford stu
dents have used this relationship to their
advantage — as they should.
The students who choose to go out
and serve corporate America make a
decision to live a certain way. I don't
know how Liz came to the conclusion
that "the two-year deluxe package from
Oblivion, Inc." offers "no life." Wherever
you work after Stanford, it will probably
not be a picnic — you will probably use
every little bit of what you learned at
Stanford, and maybe more, to succeed at
your job. But this does not mean that
you will not have a "life." I know gradu
ates that now work for consulting firms,
and they have more of a social life than
they ever did at Stanford.
Liz asks, "Are the corporate-to-bes
really so much more sophisticated? Is
choosing to be completely set up by some
consulting firm really so courageous?"
The fact is, no one can ever be "complete
ly set up." It is not the pinnacle of life's
achievement to be hired by a McKinsey
or a Goldman Sachs. At every stage in
life, there will be challenges, and hard
decisions to make. Yes, even after you go
to business school, you will have to find
another job that satisfies higher expecta
tions and offers better compensation.
Yes, even after you go to graduate school
and become a college professor, you will
experience a constant pressure to pub
lish. You have to work to succeed —
throughout life.
The Stanford graduates who work for

consulting firms are making a commit
ment to work intensely hard, and the
firm "sets them up" in return. It is
courageous, because they are working
hard at being productive, and are earning
the rewards for it. Choosing to go to
graduate school is no less courageous —
it's just a different choice.
And if we reason inductively, there's
not a whole lot of evidence to presuppose
(from what we see at Stanford, at least)
that graduate students will have swing
ing social lives. It's a hard choice to be a
graduate student. Graduate school, espe
cially at a place like Stanford, demands a
lot, and is not for the faint of heart. But
it is as productive as working for a con
sulting firm. The demands are as chal
lenging; the types of demands are differ
ent.
Going to graduate school is not post
poning reality, it is facing it — in a dif
ferent form. It means saying, "I love this
thing enough that I want to spend the
next few years, maybe my life, studying
it." It takes great courage and strength
of character to be able to make — and
live by — that statement.
No one goes to graduate school
because they are afraid of "paying utility
bills, killing insects and cleaning the
bathroom." It would be a sad commen
tary on four years at Stanford if that
was the reason a Stanford student chose
that route. I appreciate Liz's self-depre
cating tone, but I am sure that's not her
reason. She's probably found something
she's excited about and wants to pursue.

In the same way, I don't think that
Stanford students go out and work
because they want to delude themselves
that they're smart persons going places
fast.
Let's give these students a little more
credit. As smart, hardworking, accom
plished scholars, they have decided that
they want to go out into the work force.
They may be looking at Liz as they are
"power walking" to their interview and
saying, "I am in control." Or they may
not. But just like the graduate students
at Stanford, they have made a decision
about their lives — a decision to be pro
ductive.
That choice must be respected. This is
a time of great uncertainty for them, as
they interview and wait. Like the stu
dents waiting to hear from graduate and
professional schools, they deserve our
silent support, not the unenviable epithet
of people looking for "an excuse for hav
ing no life."
And as for corporate America, more
power to it. Let's understand that every
time we listen to a stereo, turn on an
electric bulb, or work on a computer, we
are using something corporate America
produced that makes our life infinitely
easier.
So you think this'll improve my
chances with McKinsey next year?
Probably not.
But if I'm not there, shoot me.

you work after Stanford, it will probably
not be a picnic — you will probably use
every little bit of what you learned at
Stanford, and maybe more, to succeed at
your job. But this does not mean that
you will not have a "life." I know gradu
ates that now work for consulting firms,
and they have more of a social life than
they ever did at Stanford.
Liz asks, "Are the corporate-to-bes
really so much more sophisticated? Is
choosing to be completely set up by some
consulting firm really so courageous?"
The fact is, no one can ever be "complete
ly set up." It is not the pinnacle of life's
achievement to be hired by a McKinsey
or a Goldman Sachs. At every stage in
life, there will be challenges, and hard
decisions to make. Yes, even after you go
to business school, you will have to find
another job that satisfies higher expecta
tions and offers better compensation.
Yes, even after you go to graduate school
and become a college professor, you will
experience a constant pressure to pub
lish. You have to work to succeed —
throughout life.
The Stanford graduates who work for

consulting firms are making a commit
ment to work intensely hard, and the
firm "sets them up" in return. It is
courageous, because they are working
hard at being productive, and are earning
the rewards for it. Choosing to go to
graduate school is no less courageous —
it's just a different choice.
And if we reason inductively, there's
not a whole lot of evidence to presuppose
(from what we see at Stanford, at least)
that graduate students will have swing
ing social lives. It's a hard choice to be a
graduate student. Graduate school, espe
cially at a place like Stanford, demands a
lot, and is not for the faint of heart. But
it is as productive as working for a con
sulting firm. The demands are as chal
lenging; the types of demands are differ
ent.
Going to graduate school is not post
poning reality, it is facing it — in a dif
ferent form. It means saying, "I love this
thing enough that I want to spend the
next few years, maybe my life, studying
it." It takes great courage and strength
of character to be able to make — and
live by — that statement.
No one goes to graduate school
because they are afraid of "paying utility
bills, killing insects and cleaning the
bathroom." It would be a sad commen
tary on four years at Stanford if that
was the reason a Stanford student chose
that route. I appreciate Liz's self-depre
cating tone, but I am sure that's not her
reason. She's probably found something
she's excited about and wants to pursue.

In the same way, I don't think that
Stanford students go out and work
because they want to delude themselves
that they're smart persons going places
fast.
Let's give these students a little more
credit. As smart, hardworking, accom
plished scholars, they have decided that
they want to go out into the work force.
They may be looking at Liz as they are
"power walking" to their interview and
saying, "I am in control." Or they may
not. But just like the graduate students
at Stanford, they have made a decision
about their lives — a decision to be pro
ductive.
That choice must be respected. This is
a time of great uncertainty for them, as
they interview and wait. Like the stu
dents waiting to hear from graduate and
professional schools, they deserve our
silent support, not the unenviable epithet
of people looking for "an excuse for hav
ing no life."
And as for corporate America, more
power to it. Let's understand that every
time we listen to a stereo, turn on an
electric bulb, or work on a computer, we
are using something corporate America
produced that makes our life infinitely
easier.
So you think this'll improve my
chances with McKinsey next year?
Probably not.
But if I'm not there, shoot me.

I READ WITH interest Liz Gorgue's
Feb. 8 column, "Stanford goes corpo
rate." Sadly enough, Liz is not the
only one who has "the overwhelming
urge to mow down" America's corporate
types on campus. Yes, it is that time of
year again, when Stanford students get a
harsh taste of the "real" world, and real
ize that there are different standards out
there. Many Stanford students choose to
go to graduate or professional schools;
many others choose to go out into the
work force. But whatever they choose to
do, that choice must be respected.
As a junior trying to decide whether to
get a job or go to graduate school after
college, I fail to understand why it is
acceptable and somehow "OK" to rag on
the students who go out into the work
force and "corporate America" in gener
al. We at Stanford are so caught up in
changing the world that we sometimes
fail to appreciate it as it is. Corporate
America is not only responsible for trash
ing the environment; it is also responsi
ble for sustaining America's economy, for
supporting research institutions, gradu
ate schools, labs, professional schools (we
see evidence of all this at Stanford) and
for producing the things that make it
possible for an industrial society to exist.
Stanford doesn't go corporate once a
year, by the way. Stanford's been "corpo
rate" for a while. Ever since one of the
California Big Four converted a stud
farm into a university in his son's memo
ry. Ever since two engineering students
at Stanford started a small business that

became a billion-dollar company and
spawned Silicon Valley. Stanford stu
dents have used this relationship to their
advantage — as they should.
The students who choose to go out
and serve corporate America make a
decision to live a certain way. I don't
know how Liz came to the conclusion
that "the two-year deluxe package from
Oblivion, Inc." offers "no life." Wherever
you work after Stanford, it will probably
not be a picnic — you will probably use
every little bit of what you learned at
Stanford, and maybe more, to succeed at
your job. But this does not mean that
you will not have a "life." I know gradu
ates that now work for consulting firms,
