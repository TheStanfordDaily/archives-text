## Tim Stanton Service is an essential part of education 
### 
MORE THAN 2,500 Stanford stu
dents engage in public and com
munity service through programs
affiliated with the Haas Center for Public
Service. Hundreds more manage and par
ticipate in service programs through their
fraternity or sorority, the ethnic student
community centers, their residences, or
religious groups. Ail of us should be proud
and appreciative of these efforts.
However, is this deep engagement by
Stanford students in community affairs
enough to learn about and solve persis
tent social problems? Probably not. Vol
unteerism is a critical element in strate
gies to alleviate human suffering and
build strong communities. However, as
John Dewey stated long ago, these experi
ences often leave it to chance whether stu
dents will actually gain an understanding
of the problems they encounter, or of the
consequences of their voluntary action.
While churches, YMCAs or local gov
ernments can effectively recruit and
supervise volunteers, institutions of
higher learning must have an education
al rationale for engaging in this work.
Colleges and universities must not only
exhort students to serve but also should
coordinate and support their service.
Structures should exist in and outside
the curriculum that allow students to
reflect critically on their service experi
ences in the context of what is known
theoretically about them.
For example, the Haas Center — in
partnership with the School of Humani

ties and Sciences — has worked with fac
ulty to help students make such "study
service" connections. Thanks to these
efforts, Stanford offers some 40 "service
learning" courses that allow students to
integrate public service experience with
academic study. The Community Service
Writing Program in the Program on
Writing and Critical Thinking is the
largest such effort, involving 300 to 400
frosh in writing for community organiza
tions each year. Service-learning lecture
courses and small, intensive seminars
also exist across the curriculum.
Opportunities for students to consider
their service work in substantive ways
exist outside the classroom as well. The
largest of these takes place tomorrow at
Kresge Auditorium when Stanford hosts
the "You Can Make A Difference Confer
ence." This year the topic is "Cities in
Crisis." The entire campus community is
welcome (contact the Haas Center for
more information). Non-credit seminars
and workshops related to public service
also take place regularly in dorms and
centers across campus.
President Emeritus Donald Kennedy
once asserted that a Stanford education
must produce students with "fundamen
tal knowledge, of diverse and demanding
kinds . . . confident capacity to think
clearly about new problems . . . and above
all, well formed and passionately held
belief." His view of education is one that
connects rigorous learning with the abili
ty both to apply that knowledge to new

problems and to induce new knowledge
from experience. Such learning, Kennedy
said, should be accomplished in the con
text of self-discovery gained through
value-oriented, "careful gourmet cooking
of intellectual struggle."
Community service experience, when
connected with rigorous, reflective
inquiry, can be used to reach this goal.
Public policy research questions and
basic community needs provide opportu
nities for students to discover knowledge
and develop new skills. Students can then
use the resulting service experience to
apply and test classroom generated
understandings of a great variety of intel
lectual questions in the humanities,
social sciences and even the "hard" sci
ences.
Such activities offer great opportuni
ties to connect this learning with ques
tions at both the personal (e.g., what is
my responsibility to others as a well edu
cated citizen?) and institutional (e.g.,
what is the relationship of scholarly
inquiry in my field to the common good?)
levels. The connection of service experi
ence with academic study — linking
responsible participation in "our untidy
world" with rigorous reflection and anal
ysis — provides both an essential founda
tion for students' personal and academic
development and important assistance to
communities off campus.
