## Bright lights, big flowers: my favorite Valentine 
### 
NO MAN IN HIS RIGHT MIND
would buy light-up tulips. A
dozen long-stemmed red licorice
whips, perhaps. Maybe even the blue
light dominatrix special at Frederick's of
Hollywood complete with a tasteful red
lace thong. At the very least a dinner for
two at Max's Opera Cafe, gastric distress
included free of charge.
But not light-up tulips.
Why do they give guys like this credit
card limits higher than my dad's, I won
dered as I caught my first glimpse of
them from the doorway. Why did they
ever let him out of the asylum, I gri
maced as I counted each hideously tacky
one of them standing tall and proud on
my desk, offering their sickly yellow
green glow in my darkened room.
Why didn't I fatally poison myself by
drinking a dispenser-full of rose hand
lotion when I was in the bathroom, I ago
nized, flicking the accompanying beauti
ful, large, expensive crystal vase to check
its authenticity.
Cha-ching.
Soon, Mr. Good Taste crept out from

behind the door, grinning that I-done
good grin in breathless anticipation of
the thank-yous with which he was to be
lathered. Reeking of that Old Spice reek
as he took another step closer, waiting
for the orgy of appreciation that was to
burst his way any second. Bowing his
head with that don't-restrain-your-ecsta
sy bow, waiting for the response the kind
saleswoman had guaranteed him as she
handed him a pen to sign his receipt.
Don Juan from hell.
There I was, a deer caught in head
lights, the angels on high demanding a
positive reaction. There I was, a study
fiend interrupted, a 20-page paper
demanding a return to more scholarly
pursuits. There I was, an unforgiving
cynic, my romantic reflexes demanding I
vomit on command.
I lowered my head. I tousled my hair.
I wrung my hands just once, then looked
up. "They're lovely. Thank you," I
smiled. "You shouldn't have." I walked
across the room to hug Mr. Retail Slut,
smiling my best Vaseline smile, giving
my best double-breast hug, swishing my

best long-hair swish.
Is it live, or is it Memorex?
Then, in an act of pure self-mutilation,
I turned to get the present I had lovingly
prepared for him. The box I had carefully
glued copies of my favorite Gustav Klimt
works on. The blank book I had affection
ately personalized and wrapped for him
to write his thoughts in. The jar I had
painstakingly painted for him to keep his
spirit in. The red and pink jellybeans I
had filled the box with, to add that extra
edible Bookstore something.
As I crossed the room, holding the
Faberge Egg of all Valentine's Day gifts,
I looked back at the radiating plastic flo
ral monstrosity which shed a sickly light
on the oily complexion of my companion.
His doofus grin still intact, I held the
treasured box out to him, a Hoover Dam
of tears carefully conserved by my eye
lashes.
The Crying Game.
Aggressively opening the box, Mr.
Sensitive happily popped a few jellybeans
into his mouth, fishing through the
candy to the book and jar. I sniffled a

strong-person sniffle and explained to
him the meaning of the 72 unique and
expressive facets of the box which I had
crafted for him.
He turned to me, his nosehairs shin
ing in the pale tuliplight. "Cool," he said,
formulating the sentence that I would
recite again and again to the Bridge
counselor over the phone. "God, you
thought about this a lot."
It's the thought that counts.
I swung around to take one last look
at my end of the bargain, my new avant
garde conversation piece, such a glaring
example of capitalism gone wrong.
After all, it's the thought that counts.
Like a good person, I said thank you
once again. Like a good person, I waved
at him as he disappeared out of sight.
Like a good person, I immediately invited
all 30-plus residents of my all-women's
floor in to join me in venomous ridicule
as soon as he was safely out of earshot.
They soon filed out of the room after
wagering bets on the amount of money
he had spent. On the number of hours I
would wait before I became dejectedly

disinterested with him. On the size of his
penis. After it all, I was left with the
tulips. Left to contemplate his poor fash
ion sense. Left to ponder the other men
in my life I found reasonably attractive.
Williams nabs the rebound.
And I remembered the Valentines of
yore. Back when I got only one tiny
Valentine each year. One anonymous
card from the same secret admirer. One
envelope with unrecognizable handwrit
ing script. One wonderful piece of mail,
postmarked "Davenport, lA," curiously
enough also the residence of my
grandpa.
The tulips have long since been given
to Goodwill. The man has long since been
kicked to the curb. The one wonderful
card, however, is still eagerly anticipated.
You always go back to the basics.

Tish laments that there will be no light
up tulips for her this lonely Valentine's
Day. Funny that.

Hollywood complete with a tasteful red
lace thong. At the very least a dinner for
two at Max's Opera Cafe, gastric distress
included free of charge.
But not light-up tulips.
Why do they give guys like this credit
card limits higher than my dad's, I won
dered as I caught my first glimpse of
them from the doorway. Why did they
ever let him out of the asylum, I gri
maced as I counted each hideously tacky
one of them standing tall and proud on
my desk, offering their sickly yellow
green glow in my darkened room.
Why didn't I fatally poison myself by
drinking a dispenser-full of rose hand
lotion when I was in the bathroom, I ago
nized, flicking the accompanying beauti
ful, large, expensive crystal vase to check
its authenticity.
Cha-ching.
Soon, Mr. Good Taste crept out from

behind the door, grinning that I-done
good grin in breathless anticipation of
the thank-yous with which he was to be
lathered. Reeking of that Old Spice reek
as he took another step closer, waiting
for the orgy of appreciation that was to
burst his way any second. Bowing his
head with that don't-restrain-your-ecsta
sy bow, waiting for the response the kind
saleswoman had guaranteed him as she
handed him a pen to sign his receipt.
Don Juan from hell.
There I was, a deer caught in head
lights, the angels on high demanding a
positive reaction. There I was, a study
fiend interrupted, a 20-page paper
demanding a return to more scholarly
pursuits. There I was, an unforgiving
cynic, my romantic reflexes demanding I
vomit on command.
I lowered my head. I tousled my hair.
I wrung my hands just once, then looked
up. "They're lovely. Thank you," I
smiled. "You shouldn't have." I walked
across the room to hug Mr. Retail Slut,
smiling my best Vaseline smile, giving
my best double-breast hug, swishing my

best long-hair swish.
Is it live, or is it Memorex?
Then, in an act of pure self-mutilation,
I turned to get the present I had lovingly
prepared for him. The box I had carefully
glued copies of my favorite Gustav Klimt
works on. The blank book I had affection
ately personalized and wrapped for him
to write his thoughts in. The jar I had
painstakingly painted for him to keep his
spirit in. The red and pink jellybeans I
had filled the box with, to add that extra
edible Bookstore something.
As I crossed the room, holding the
Faberge Egg of all Valentine's Day gifts,
I looked back at the radiating plastic flo
ral monstrosity which shed a sickly light
on the oily complexion of my companion.
His doofus grin still intact, I held the
treasured box out to him, a Hoover Dam
of tears carefully conserved by my eye
lashes.
The Crying Game.
Aggressively opening the box, Mr.
Sensitive happily popped a few jellybeans
into his mouth, fishing through the
candy to the book and jar. I sniffled a

strong-person sniffle and explained to
him the meaning of the 72 unique and
expressive facets of the box which I had
crafted for him.
He turned to me, his nosehairs shin
ing in the pale tuliplight. "Cool," he said,
formulating the sentence that I would
recite again and again to the Bridge
counselor over the phone. "God, you
thought about this a lot."
It's the thought that counts.
I swung around to take one last look
at my end of the bargain, my new avant
garde conversation piece, such a glaring
example of capitalism gone wrong.
After all, it's the thought that counts.
Like a good person, I said thank you
once again. Like a good person, I waved
at him as he disappeared out of sight.
Like a good person, I immediately invited
all 30-plus residents of my all-women's
floor in to join me in venomous ridicule
as soon as he was safely out of earshot.
They soon filed out of the room after
wagering bets on the amount of money
he had spent. On the number of hours I
would wait before I became dejectedly

disinterested with him. On the size of his
penis. After it all, I was left with the
tulips. Left to contemplate his poor fash
ion sense. Left to ponder the other men
in my life I found reasonably attractive.
Williams nabs the rebound.
And I remembered the Valentines of
yore. Back when I got only one tiny
Valentine each year. One anonymous
card from the same secret admirer. One
envelope with unrecognizable handwrit
ing script. One wonderful piece of mail,
postmarked "Davenport, lA," curiously
enough also the residence of my
grandpa.
The tulips have long since been given
to Goodwill. The man has long since been
kicked to the curb. The one wonderful
card, however, is still eagerly anticipated.
You always go back to the basics.

Tish laments that there will be no light
up tulips for her this lonely Valentine's
Day. Funny that.
