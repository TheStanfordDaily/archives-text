# Sluggish e-mail to speed up
## Upgrades next week 
### Jim Morris Staff writer 
A recent swell in the use of the
Stanford's computer network
caused an ugly mess this week,
paralyzing electronic mail mes
sages for up to three days.
Leland, Stanford's electronic
mailbox, will be upgraded to a
faster system late next week in
order to avoid the slowdowns that
delayed electronic correspon
dence for students over the last
several days. E-mail messages are
normally transmitted immedi
ately.
The sloth-like transmissions
this week were caused by a vari
ety of factors, from an increase in
total e-mail messages — up 50 to
75 percent from fall quarter — to
a few students "who tipped over
the problem" by sending 6,000
messages to Leland from three
computers on the second floor of
Sweet Hall, according to Dennis
Michael of Networking and Com
munication Systems.
"The increase in [network]
usage caught me by surprise six
months earlier than I thought,"
he said. Michael had originally
planned to replace the Leland
computer this summer, but has
immediately begun to install a
new $75,000 system that should
ride out the increasing wave of
messages until sometime next
year.
The new system, a Sun Mi
crosystems Server 1000, is ex
pected to prevent e-mail snarls on
Leland accounts and could be
twice as fast as the old system, ac
cording to Lance Nakata, sys
tems manager at Sweet Hall. The
new speed will be needed to deliv
er the 70,000-plus messages
reaching students each day.
The profusion of mailing lists
— a method that allows academic
departments, student groups and
individuals to send multiple mes
sages with the touch of a key —
has significantly contributed to
the increase from last year's aver
age of 40,000 messages per day,
according to Michael.
Currently, the campus' net
work can accommodate approxi
mately 70,000 transmissions per
day. But during the slowdown,
Leland was "maxxed out" —

meaning it exceeded the 70,000
threshold.
As a result, the network had to
store all incoming messages until
the excess e-mail — compounded
by a heavy surge in mailings last
weekend — could be delivered to
the individual accounts.
The shower of 6,000 messages
that contributed to the e-mail
fiasco may have been generated
by a few students going a step
beyond an assignment in the
Computer Science 1U class,
according to that class' lecturer
Ronald Burback.
"I could've been the instigator

who did it," said Burback, refer
ring to his assignment which
taught students how to program
Unix machines to execute
instructions automatically, much
like a plane on autopilot.
Another cause could be the
increase in network usage by stu
dents in their dormitory rooms.
Over 1,000 rooms have been con
nected to the campus network in
the past year. Students can access
library card catalogs, register for
classes, send e-mail or just browse
through the myriad services
available on the international
Internet.
