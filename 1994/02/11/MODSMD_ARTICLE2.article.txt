# Sluggish e-mail to speed up
## Upgrades next week 
### Jim Morris Staff writer 
A recent swell in the use of the
Stanford's computer network
caused an ugly mess this week,
paralyzing electronic mail mes

"The increase in [network]
usage caught me by surprise six
months earlier than I thought,"
he said. Michael had originally
planned to replace the Leland
computer this summer, but has
immediately begun to install a
new $75,000 system that should
ride out the increasing wave of
messages until sometime next
year.
The new system, a Sun Mi

Leland accounts and could be
twice as fast as the old system, ac

new speed will be needed to deliv
er the 70,000-plus messages
reaching students each day.
