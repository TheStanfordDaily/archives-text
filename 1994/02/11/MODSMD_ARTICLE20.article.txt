# Robin Kennedy to be office's first casualty
## 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Senior staff writer 
For one Legal Office employ
ee, the budget ax has already
fallen.
Assoc. University Counsel
Robin Kennedy, who has
worked in the office for nearly
seven years, said she has been
notified that she will be laid off
in the near future.
Kennedy, the wife of former
University President Donald
Kennedy, had until this year
spent half her time working as
a real estate lawyer and half as
the office's administrator, han
dling the department's budget
and day-to-day operations.
But when a full-time office
administrator was hired
recently, Kennedy said she was
told that "it just doesn't make
sense for you to stay on as a
half-time lawyer."
Kennedy said she is current
ly negotiating the terms of her
severance with the University
and has not yet been given a
termination date.
General Counsel Michael
Roster refused to comment on
Kennedy's situation, but said
that she is still working as a full
time attorney for the Universi
ty.
Kennedy said her dismissal
is not performance-related but
is part of the office's attempt to
reduce costs and examine ways
to contract more work to out
side law firms.
Kennedy, who holds bache
lor's and law degrees from
Stanford, has been working
for the University since 1980.
She began as director for
housing programs, where she
was responsible for on-cam
pus faculty and staff housing
issues. In 1985, she was
named the University's real
estate director and put in
charge of all campus lands
except for the Stanford Shop
ping Center.
In 1987, after becoming
engaged to Donald Kennedy,

she decided to leave her real
estate post because she "was
advised that because the posi
tion was so visible within the
Stanford community and so
visible in the local community
. . . that it might not be in the
best interests of the institution
and the presidency to continue
in that role."
As a result, she was given a
one-year position in the Legal
Office, and after a year, the job
became permanent. Although
some called her appointment to
the Legal Office nepotism,
Kennedy said she received no
special favors from her new
husband.
"I wasn't given the job
because I was married to the
president," she said.
She currently serves on the
board of directors of Stanford's
Hillel Foundation and is a
freshman adviser.
Kennedy, who is looking for
a new job, said her layoff, the
office's first since it was consol
idated in the late 19705, "just
broke my heart."
"It felt devaluing. It felt as
though it invalidated all of my
efforts and all of my accom
plishments and everything I
had built here," she said.
