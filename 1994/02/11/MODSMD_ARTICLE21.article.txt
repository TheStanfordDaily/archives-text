## Outpowered Cardinal overcome by Wildcats, 77-60 Stanford shut down by strong defense 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
The Stanford men's basketball
team's three-game winning
streak came to a resounding halt
last night, as Arizona overpow
ered the Cardinal 77-60 at Maples
Pavilion.

'You've got to take
away the inside oppor
tunities from a team
like Stanford. That was
the key — we kept it
out of the inside.'
— Lute Olson

"We got beat by a better bas
ketball team," said Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery. "That's
not very hard to figure out."
The Cardinal (13-6 overall, 6-4
in the Pacific 10 Conference) was
outplayed on both ends of the
court by a Wildcat squad anxious
to bounce back from its loss to
Pac-10 doormat Washington last
weekend.
"We have been mentally and
physically focused all week in
practice," said Arizona guard
Damon Stoudamire. "We needed
some wins badly on this trip."
The No. 15 Wildcats (18-4, 7-3)
combined a pair of standout per
formances from Stoudamire and
fellow guard Khalid Reeves with
40 minutes of physical defense in
handing the Cardinal its most
lopsided home loss of the season.
"We came in here looking for a
tough game," Stoudamire said.
"They seemed to never get into a
rhythm or a groove."
Despite shooting at a lacklus
ter 32-percent first-half clip,
Stanford matched the Wildcats
for the first 10 minutes of the

contest, taking a 17-13 lead when
forward Andy Poppink hit an 18-
footer at the 10:18 mark.
But Arizona, led by seven
points from Reeves, went on a 12-
0 run, going ahead 25-17 with
6:09 to play in the half.
Up 31-22 at the intermission,
the Wildcats slammed the door on
Stanford in the first five minutes
of the second half. Reeves set the
tone for the period with a steal
and a layup 15 seconds into the
half, as the Wildcats jumped to a
45-28 lead at the 15:25 mark.
It was all academic from that
point — Arizona never led by less
than 15 in the game's final 15
minutes.
"We came out really flat," said
Stanford forward Brent Williams.
Stanford was hounded all
night by a tenacious Arizona
inside defense that held Cardinal
big men Poppink, Williams and
Jim Morgan to 15 points, 20
below their combined season
average.
"You've got to take away the
inside opportunities from a team
like Stanford," said Wildcats
coach Lute Olson. "That was the
key — we kept it out of the
inside."
Offensively, Reeves and
Stoudamire combined for 53
points, including nine from three
point range. Reeves, second in the
Pac-10 in scoring with a 23.2
points-per-game average, finished
the night with 33.
"When they're playing well,
they're as good as any guards in
the country," Montgomery said.
The Cardinal faces Arizona
State tomorrow afternoon in a
matchup that takes on added sig
nificance after last night's loss.
Stanford must beat the Sun Dev
ils to remain in the upper division
of the Pac-10.
"The kids are going to have to
respond," Montgomery said. "The
key is to beat the people that you
have a chance to beat."
