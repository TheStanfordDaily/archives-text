# Three pointers decide contest
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
Good things came in pairs of threes for Ari
zona last night.
Relying on a barrage of timely three-point
bombs, the Wildcats took the air out of several
Stanford rallies, preventing the Cardinal from
keeping the game close in the final ten minutes.
The Arizona squad shot an astounding sea
son-high 61.1 percent (11-18) from long dis
tance, a statistic which was a bit surprising
even to its own players.
"We're not coming into the game looking to
shoot a lot of threes," said Wildcat guard
Damon Stoudamire. "But if the three pointer's
there, we'll take it. We're not shy about taking
them."
To the Cardinal's despair, the Arizona team
seemed to convert two of them at a time at
exactly the right moments. Consecutive three
point buckets by guards Khalid Reeves and
Reggie Geary broke a 17-17 tie and gave Ari
zona a 6-point advantage, a lead it wouldn't lose
for the game's duration.
"They shot the ball well from deep," said
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery. "Their
guards pretty much had the ability to score at
will."
In the second half, the Wildcats gave the
Cardinal team even more glimpses of their
uncanny shooting ability. Four minutes into
the period, Geary and Reeves busted another
couple of threes, increasing the Arizona advan
tage to 17 and making Stanford's uphill battle a
lot steeper.
Even when the Cardinal seemed on the way
to making a dent in the Wildcat's double-digit
lead, Arizona one-upped its opponent every time.
For example, after Stanford point guard
Brevin Knight nailed a trey at the seven-minute
mark, the Cardinal's first three-pointer of the
period, Reeves took little time to respond. The
senior guard hit a pair of threes in a 50-second
timespan, giving his defender, Knight, a taste of
his own medicine.
