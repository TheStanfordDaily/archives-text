# Three pointers decide contest
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
Good things came in pairs of threes for Ari
zona last night.
Relying on a barrage of timely three-point
bombs, the Wildcats took the air out of several
Stanford rallies, preventing the Cardinal from
keeping the game close in the final ten minutes.
The Arizona squad shot an astounding sea
son-high 61.1 percent (11-18) from long dis
tance, a statistic which was a bit surprising
even to its own players.
"We're not coming into the game looking to
shoot a lot of threes," said Wildcat guard
Damon Stoudamire. "But if the three pointer's
there, we'll take it. We're not shy about taking
them."
To the Cardinal's despair, the Arizona team
seemed to convert two of them at a time at
exactly the right moments. Consecutive three
point buckets by guards Khalid Reeves and
Reggie Geary broke a 17-17 tie and gave Ari
zona a 6-point advantage, a lead it wouldn't lose
for the game's duration.
"They shot the ball well from deep," said
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery. "Their
guards pretty much had the ability to score at
will."
In the second half, the Wildcats gave the
Cardinal team even more glimpses of their
uncanny shooting ability. Four minutes into
the period, Geary and Reeves busted another
couple of threes, increasing the Arizona advan
tage to 17 and making Stanford's uphill battle a
lot steeper.
Even when the Cardinal seemed on the way
to making a dent in the Wildcat's double-digit
lead, Arizona one-upped its opponent every time.
For example, after Stanford point guard
Brevin Knight nailed a trey at the seven-minute
mark, the Cardinal's first three-pointer of the
period, Reeves took little time to respond. The
senior guard hit a pair of threes in a 50-second
timespan, giving his defender, Knight, a taste of
his own medicine.
"There's nothing you can do
except try to stay as close to him as
possible," Knight said.
Indeed, throughout the contest,
the Cardinal sharp-shooters proved

no match for the Wildcat bomb
squad.
"All you have to do is look at the
statistics to see the story of the
game," Montgomery said. "Our
shooting percentage for threes was
30 percent vs. 60 percent for them.
You're just not going to win when
you're performing like that."
The fact that Arizona shot a pal

try four-for-28 on threes just one
week ago in losing to last-place
Washington made last night's out
burst more frustrating for Stanford.
The Cardinal learned the hard
way that the Wildcats had broken
out of any sort of slump in which
they may have been stuck.
"It's just a matter of concentra
tion," said Montgomery.
