# Swimming to challenge Cal
## 
### Regan Demas Staff writer 
They have never been the cleanest or kindest
of creatures. But they can also be unpredictable.
When the Bears come rummaging through de
Guerre pool on Saturday, looking for any signs
of points or tiny scraps of respect, the Stanford
women's swimming squad is bound to keep that
fact in mind.
The undefeated and top-ranked Cardinal, on
a record 43-straight dual-meet winning streak,
will host California in Stanford's final dual meet
of the season.
The Cardinal is coming off a blow-out victory
over No. 2-ranked Texas last weekend, and
while the competition this week will not equal
that of the last meet, Stanford is prepared for
the playing out of a typical Cardinal/Bear
matchup.
"Cal is a good team," coach Richar3 Quick
said of the mediocre Bears. "But we don't have
to swim all of our best events to win the meet.
We're going to take advantage of the opportuni
ty to work on our weaker events."
Since numerous Stanford swimmers will
compete in three races at the NCAA tournament
next month, Quick said he hopes these less com
petitive dual meets give his athletes a chance to
brush up on their weakest of the three and "try
to take a little pressure off their best events."
With two weeks until the Pacific 10 Confer
ence championships, only three Stanford indi
viduals and one relay team have qualified for the
national show. Jenny Thompson has finished
under the NCAA times in the 50-, 100- and 200-
yard freestyle, as well as the 100- and 200-yard
butterfly and the 200-yard individual medley.
Lea Loveless has gained entry in both the 100-
and 200-yard backstroke, while Becky Crowe
will compete in the 200 butterfly. In addition,
the 400-yard freestyle relay team of Jessica
Tong, Loveless, Lisa Jacob and Thompson have
secured a spot in the competition.
Still, Quick sees the need for improvement. "I
wish we were swimming a little bit faster. We
trained well [this week] and I know that there
are [faster times] in [our swimmers], it just
needs to come out in competition."
While Cal breaststrokers could pose a reason
able threat, the Bears are not likely to bring out
the best in Stanford. The Cardinal might have to
wait until the more competitive Pac-10 Champi
onships to accomplish qualifications for the
NCAA tournament across the board.
While the overall performance of the team is
lagging in Quick's eyes, he is very pleased with
the efforts of several athletes.
"I think Jenny Thompson, Lea Loveless and
Sarah Anderson are swimming the most consis
tent and very well," Quick said. "Becky Crowe is
doing an outstanding job, stepping into her roll
as our lead 200 butterflyer."
The Cal meet rounds off an intense four week
stretch of dual meets for the Cardinal, now 5-0
in the dual-meet season. The meet this weekend
begins at 1 p.m.
