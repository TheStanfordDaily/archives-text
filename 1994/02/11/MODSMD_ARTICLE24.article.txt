Proving that winning is not always as easy as "A-
B-C," the alphabetical trio of Christy Hedgpeth,
Rachel Hemmer and Tara Harrington combined for
61 points last night as the 14th-ranked Cardinal
women's basketball team dominated the Arizona
Wildcats 88-57 before 1,268 at the McKale Center in
Tucson.
Stanford (14-5, 7-3 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
wasted little time in exploiting undermanned Arizona
(10-8, 4-6), which dressed only nine healthy players
after losing leading scorer Shawn Coder to a knee
injury last Saturday.
After some sloppy play by both sides in the opening
minutes, Hemmer and Hedgpeth scored 11 of the
game's first 13 points as the Cardinal raced an 11-2
lead. Hemmer, a junior forward, hit a 12-foot jumper
to open matters and added a free throw during the
run for three of her 22 points. Meanwhile, Hedgpeth,
a senior guard, buried a pair of three-pointers and
converted two free throws for eight of her game-high
23.

The teams split the next 30 points, and with nine
minutes remaining in the first half, the Wildcats
hung tough at 26-17. But that proved to be the calm
before the storm, as Stanford's deliberate half-court
attack proceeded to break the game wide open.
Harrington, a freshman forward, started a 16-
point evening by nailing a trey and pushing the Car
dinal advantage into double-digits for good. She then
made a layup, two free throws and another three
pointer to close out the half as Stanford claimed an
incredible 53-21 margin at intermission.
"That was one of our best 15-minute spurts of the
season," said Cardinal head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"We proved that we can be athletic and quick and play
good defense."
The defense was so good, in fact, that only four
Wildcats contributed to the lowest one-half point total
of a Stanford opponent all season. Two of those scor
ers, senior forwards Kim Conway and Nikki Thomp
son combined for just 10 points and, more important
ly, five personal fouls in the first 20 minutes.
The latter figure played right into the Cardinal's
hands, as Arizona's zone defense effectively stopped
junior center Anita Kaplan (four points, two
rebounds), but left Hemmer and her other team

mates free.
"When we took Anita out early, it was like playing
with four perimeter players and one post," Van-
Derveer said. "Arizona decided that if you're going to
beat us, you're going to beat us from the outside."
Hemmer's effort notwithstanding, the Cardinal did
most of its damage from downtown, where it hit 10 of
18 three-point attempts and, according to VanDerveer,
"could have taken about 10 more." Hedgpeth connect
ed with five of her seven bombs, Harrington with three
of four and junior guard Kate Paye (three points, a
game-high six assists) and sophomore forward Bobbie
Kelsey (11 points, five rebounds) hit one apiece.
Few remained in the arena to notice that the Wild
cats outscored Stanford 36-35 in the second half to
provide the final 31-point margin, but VanDerveer,
ever the motivator, indicated that she will use that
fact to get the Cardinal ready for its next game.
"It was hard to play with a 30-point lead tonight
. . . but Arizona State has nothing to lose and they're
ready to play, so we better be too," VanDerveer said.
VanDerveer's squad will take on the Sun Devils
tomorrow night at 6 p.m. PST in Tempe. The game
