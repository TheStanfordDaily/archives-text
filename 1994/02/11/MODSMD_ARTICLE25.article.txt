# Undefeated women's tennis to battle UCSD, SDSU
## Netters hope to protect their record against No. 3 doubles duo in nation

Everybody's All-American.
At least, so far in the women's
tennis season. All the Stanford
women's singles players are
undefeated in dual-match play,
as the Cardinal has rocketed to a
5-0 record. And, although that
perfect team record should
remain free of blemishes, this
weekend presents the Stanford
players with their most stringent
test yet as they face the ranked
teams of University of California
at San Diego and San Diego State
at the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
UCSD presents the first hur
dle for the Cardinal netters today
at 1:30 p.m. The Tritons (1-0)
sport a No. 23 national ranking
and the No. 3-ranked doubles
team in the country. This duo,
composed of seniors Julie McK
eon and Laura Richards, will
pose a major challenge for Stan
ford's top team, senior Laxmi
Poruri and freshman Katie
Schlukebir.
"That should be a real inter
esting matchup for the fans to
see — the number-three team in
the country who basically built
their reputation last year playing
against our new number-one
team that we think is very good,"

said Cardinal head coach Frank
Brennan.
Stanford sophomore Beth
Berris played against this Triton
pair in the fall and was
impressed.
"They're very tough," Berris
said. "Laura Richards is kind of
scary out there and that's the
object in doubles — to scare peo
ple .... It will be a good match."
In singles both McKeon and
Richards garnered All-American
honors and are ranked 55th and
23rd, respectively, this year.
McKeon will most likely do battle
with top-ranked Poruri, while
Richards and Stanford senior
Kristine Kurth, ranked 24th in
the pre-season, should square off
at No. 2 singles. Poruri has been
playing in professional tourna
ments; Wednesday's dual meet
at University of the Pacific was
her first chance to play singles
for Stanford this season. In a
lackluster performance, she
defeated unheralded Tracee
Allen in two close sets, 6-4, 7-5.
"There's more pressure.
You're not just playing for your
self, but for a team."
Judging by the rankings
(which can often be misleading),

stifter challenge Saturday at noon,
when the Aztecs invade the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium. San Diego
State is ranked 20th, but on Tues
day, the squad lost to UCSD.
With injuries and sickness, Stan
ford's starting lineup continues to

shift. Poruri, done with the pro cir
cuit, will hold down the No. 1 singles
spot for the rest of the year. Kurth,
who was playing No. 1 in Poruri's
absence, is playing at No. 2 and
should continue to do so while
sophomore Kim Shasby recovers
from ligament damage in her foot.
Shasby has yet to play a dual-meet
match.
Schlukebir is next on Stanford's
singles lineup, followed by sopho

more Berris and senior Emma
Woodhouse. Woodhouse, who
missed the UOP dual match due to
illness, will not play singles today,
but will team up with Berris at No. 3
doubles. Rounding out the squad are
freshman Sandra De Silva, sopho
more Wendy Sacks and freshman
Emily Burt. Burt has not seen much
action in the singles lineup, but will
join Kurth to form Stanford's No. 2
doubles squad.
