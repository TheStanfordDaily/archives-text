# High-riding Cardinal faces Broncos in weekend series
## 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
The red-hot Stanford baseball
team is looking to put Broncos on
ice as it goes for its fourth win in
a row today, opening a three
game series against Santa Clara.
Last weekend, the No. 13-
ranked Cardinal won three
straight on the road against No.
38 Fresno State, marking the first
time in coach Mark Marquess' 17-
year tenure that a Stanford has
swept a three-game series from
the Bulldogs at Beiden Field.
"I think it was a great weekend
for this particular team," Mar
quess said. "To go into Fresno
and win three was quite an
accomplishment for any Stanford
team, but particularly for this one
since we were 1-3 going in there."
Batting .263 on the season,
center fielder Cale Carter has
been the Cardinal's offensive cat
alyst. Last weekend against Fres
no, the sophomore slammed a
double and two home runs.
"We've really been swinging
the bat much better recently,"

Carter said. "I was hitting the
counts pretty well this weekend,
and I was able to zone in on a good
pitch to hit."
Designated hitter Nate Olm
stead has also proven himself a
major offensive contributor. In
the three-game sweep, the senior
switch-hitter went 8-for-14 with
four RBIs, six runs scored, and
his first two home runs of the sea
son.
Stanford's young pitching staff
has made a particularly impres
sive debut in the early season con
tests.
"This pitching staff has done a
remarkable job and hopefully
they'll continue," Marquess said.
"With the exception of the veiy
first game against Cal State
Fullerton, we've had an opportu
nity to win [every] other game."
Righthander Todd Bartels (2-
0) picked up his second win in as
many starts on Friday, pitching 6
1/3 innings and allowing seven
hits and four earned runs while
walking none and striking out
four.
Meanwhile, righthander Jason

Middlebrook (1-0) was virtually
unhittable Saturday, allowing
only five base runners. Overall,
the freshman pitched seven
shutout innings to earn his first
victory in a Stanford uniform.
The biggest improvement on
the mound this season, however,
has been lefthander Dan Reed.
Reed (1-1) picked up his first win
of the year Sunday, bouncing
back from a tough first start in
the season opener.
"[Reed] has done an outstand
ing job," Marquess said. "After
the first outing where he got hit
pretty well against Cal State
Fullerton, he didn't give up any
hits against St. Mary's, and only
two or three to Fresno State."
Despite Stanford's recent suc
cess, Marquess still sees room for
improvement on all fronts.
"I think we could pick it up
quite a bit offensively and defen
sively, " Marquess said. "At times,
we've played some good defense
and at other times we've been
very sloppy."
