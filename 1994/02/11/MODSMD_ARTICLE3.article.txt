# Former model lashes out at images of women in media
## 
### September Trevino 
A woman lies seductively over a new
sports car. She dresses provocatively to sell a
new perfume or to advertise cigarettes and
alcohol.
Everyone sees these images in maga
zines, on television and in advertisements,
but does anyone ever stop to think about
their consequences? Ann Simonton is trying
to, and she's sharing her discoveries with
students.
In the spirit of Body Image Awareness
Week — a five-day program coordinated by
students from the Suites — Simonton,
founding coordinator of a group promoting
improved media images of women and chil
dren, spoke to more than 50 students in

Wilbur dining hall last night about the detri
ments of negative media portrayals.
Simonton, a former fashion model and
Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue cover girl,
presented a slide show to students and
shared personal experiences in her continu
ing struggle to combat the attitudes and in
stitutions she contends devalue and demean
women in contemporary society.
She related experiences of her participa
tion in beauty pageants. "It was never easy
to get in front of people and have them judge
me based upon how I looked," Simonton
said. After becoming involved in the femi
nist movement, she protested the Miss
America Pageant by dressing in a gown of

raw meat and calling herself
"Miss Behaving."
Simonton shared with the
audience the tragic ordeal of being
assaulted by a group of men on
her way to a modeling job.
Although she had positively iden
tified the suspects, she said they
were not convicted because there
was no witness. Simonton said the
failure to convict her assailants
demonstrates the "incredible
inequities in our judicial and
social systems. . . in a society that
blamed [her]" for the attack.
She recognizes that "gender
inequality is a part of our lives . ..

that we don't want to talk about."
Simonton suggests that this
inequality sells products and ulti
mately creates incentive to per
petuate these images.
"As far as Madison Avenue is
concerned, they'd love to have
this kind of tension and this kind
of inequality ... because it helps
sell products," she said.
She displayed a number of
advertisements that she claimed
portray women negatively by
depicting women as sexual objects
and trivializing their role within
society. Using the ads, Simonton
demonstrated the ways in which
the media encourages women to
diet and to take measures to alter
their appearance, concealing the
hazards involved.
In addition to critiquing the

media's portrayals of women,
Simonton highlighted the prob
lems in media messages to men.
She suggests that the media
demands men be rugged and
tough in order to achieve society's
standard of masculinity.
Ultimately, Simonton sug
gests, "You have to learn not to
obey what they're saying."
Rather, she encourages students
to discover information from
alternative sources and to combat
these images by conquering igno
rance.
After the address, freshman
Alison Whitman said the talk
"gave me a new perspective. I've
seen the ads before but I never
thought of them the way she pre
sented them. I think I'll be more
aware in the future."
