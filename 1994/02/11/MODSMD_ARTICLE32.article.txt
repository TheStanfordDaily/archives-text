Rush Limbaugh Named New-
Florida Citrus Spokesman
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) —
The latest pitchman for the
Florida Citrus Commission is
leaving a sour taste in some
mouths.
Rush Limbaugh starts his $1
million job Monday with the
commission — the same board

which decided Anita Bryant and
Burt Reynolds were too contro
versial to promote orange juice.
The right-wing radio and tele
vision talk show host, known
for bashing feminists and
President Clinton, will promote
Florida citrus during breaks
from broadcasting, The Miami
Herald reported today.

Democratic Gov. Lawton
Chiles was not pleased.
"He believes there are broad
er audiences to be reached,
because our orange juice leaves
a good taste with people and
should be promoted on pro
grams that represent good
taste," said Chiles spokesman
Ron Sachs.
