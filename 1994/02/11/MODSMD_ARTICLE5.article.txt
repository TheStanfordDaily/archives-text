# Fewer top frosh coming to Farm?
## University may implement early admissions, aggressive recruiting 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
Responding to fears that Stan
ford is failing to attract many of
the nation's top high school stu
dents, the University is consider
ing instituting more aggressive
recruitment policies, including a
program that would offer admis
sion earlier in an applicant's se
nior year.
While the issue of Stanford's
yield rate — the rate of accepted
students who chose to attend —
was addressed by both University
President Gerhard Casper and
the Faculty Senate earlier this
year, many were troubled by the
release of comparative admissions
statistics at this week's Board of
Trustees meeting.
The most disturbing of these
figures documents how Stanford

competes with Harvard Universi
ty for the nation's top scholars,
said Todd Flynn, graduate stu
dent representative to the Board
of Trustees Committee on Acade
mic Policy.
Among students who were ac
cepted at both institutions in
1993, 78 percent chose Harvard,
while only 22 percent chose Stan
ford, Flynn said.
Calling this comparative figure
"much lower than in previous
years," Flynn expressed "serious
concern that. . . Stanford is being
decimated by stiff competition
from other schools."
Responding to Flynn's re
marks, Dean of Admissions James
Montoya called the figures "ball
park but basically correct" since
they are based on reply cards with
90 percent return rate, but he
warned that the percentages must
be placed in context.
This year's yield rate among
students accepted at both Harvard
and Stanford does not, in fact, rep
resent a major change over last
year's figures, Montoya said.
The "significant slip" Flynn
referred to is actually in compari
son with 1987 — the year Stanford
was rated first in U.S. News and
World Report's national college
ratings, Montoya said.
While Montoya conceded that
some students are simply "lured
by reputation" to Harvard, he said
he is concerned that "students are
not choosing to come to Stanford
who should be here."
In response to concerns about
the University's yield rate, the
Faculty Senate Committee on
Admissions and Financial Aid
formed a study group earlier this
year committed to reviewing the
admissions calendar.
"The question on people's
minds should be, Ts the current
admissions policy supporting stu
dents in the admissions process?' "
Montoya said.
According to Montoya, the sen
ate study group will spend the next
few months "trying to build a better

model of admissions sensitive to
challenges high school seniors face."
Unlike Stanford, Harvard and
other Ivies have "early action" or
"early decision" programs. Early
decision programs grant admis
sion as early as the fall, but require
that accepted students commit to
enrollment; early action programs
require no such commitment. In
both plans, students are discour
aged from applying to more than
one school early.
"We've discussed the possibility
of an early plan," he said. "But
we've decided to broaden our scope
beyond traditional early admission
or early action plans (by consider
ing) models used by graduate
schools which would entail multi
ple filing periods."
In addition, the group will re
evaluate the use of alumni and the
Jordan scholar program in attract
ing top academic students. The
Jordan program recognizes 200
outstanding freshmen upon entry.
In a written statement, Flynn
criticized Stanford for its lack of
such special admission programs,
which have meant a "significant,
very noticeable effect on Stan
ford's yield rates for the top aca
demic students."
"Through policies of early
action, special recognition for out
standing students and required
interviews with alumni in their
admissions processes," Flynn
wrote, "these schools have been

successfully claiming a dispropor
tionate share of top students."
Speaking out against what he
called Stanford's "policy of benign
neglect," Flynn warned that "if we
do not respond to this new envi
ronment we risk a precipitous
decline in the academic quality of
our student body."
Nonetheless, Montoya urged
that the statistics do not represent
a dramatic change in the quality of
Stanford's incoming classes as
"the number of top-rated students
in each incoming class has doubled
over the last decade."
The declining rate of compara
tive yield can also be attributed to
the fact that Stanford is "attract
ing a group of students not there a
decade ago," Montoya said.
While in 1983 only 270 students
were accepted to both institutions,
there have been around 400 "com
mon admits" since 1987, meaning
that Stanford is attracting stu
dents who weren't even applying a
decade ago, Montoya said.
"If an Easterner gains admis
sion to one of the Ivys, it is very
difficult to turn down one of the
big three (Harvard, Princeton and
Yale)," Montoya said, adding that
the "focus is not Stanford vs. Har
vard."
"We forget that there are stu
dents at Stanford who were not
admitted to Harvard and students
at Harvard who were not admitted
to Stanford," he said.
