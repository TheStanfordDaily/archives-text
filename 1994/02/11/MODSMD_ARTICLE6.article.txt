The Board of Trustees and the
Board of Directors of Stanford
Hospital have given the green
light to a plan that aims to prepare
Stanford Medical Center for the

care. This has been especially true
in the Northern California market
in which Stanford competes.
"The movement to managed
care is resulting in smaller and
smaller margins of profit for all
health care providers," said Ken
Bloem, president of the hospital.

million last year and is projected
to have another, smaller loss this
year, according to a report the
task force on restructuring gave to
the Board of Trustees. The Facul

which faculty practice medicine
and take in income, is also project

money than it has in preceding
years," the report said.
Meanwhile, the School of Med
icine is projected to run a $4 mil
