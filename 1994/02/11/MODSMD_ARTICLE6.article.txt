# Medical Center's consolidation OK'd
## 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
The Board of Trustees and the
Board of Directors of Stanford
Hospital have given the green
light to a plan that aims to prepare
Stanford Medical Center for the
health care revolution.
The plan will merge the clinical
operations of the hospital, the
School of Medicine and closely af
filiated local physicians. The uni
fied clinical programs will be ad
ministrated by a new corporation
called Stanford Health Services.
The blueprint for the reform
was originally presented by Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
last June. The Board of Trustees
approved a revised plan early this
week.
The changes are an attempt to
make Stanford more competitive in
the changing national health care
market. The local and national
trend in recent years has been to
move away from traditional fee-for

service payment and toward "man
aged care" systems that seek to con
trol the amount spent on health
care. This has been especially true
in the Northern California market
in which Stanford competes.
"The movement to managed
care is resulting in smaller and
smaller margins of profit for all
health care providers," said Ken
Bloem, president of the hospital.
Reflecting such trends, the hos
pital had an operating loss of $8
million last year and is projected
to have another, smaller loss this
year, according to a report the
task force on restructuring gave to
the Board of Trustees. The Facul
ty Practice Program, through
which faculty practice medicine
and take in income, is also project
ed to make "significantly less
money than it has in preceding
years," the report said.
Meanwhile, the School of Med
icine is projected to run a $4 mil
lion deficit on its total 1993-94
operating budget of $62 million.
Other factors beside the
advancement of managed care are
contributing to these shortfalls,
Bloem said. For example, new
medical technology both forces
the hospital to spend more money
on technology and constantly
decreases the number of days
patients must stay in the hospital.
This serves to further reduce
profit margins.
"One-stop shopping'
The formation of SHS and
reorganization of the Medical
Center is expected to help these
financial worries in several ways,
according to the task force report.
Consolidating clinical areas of the
hospital and faculty practice
should make the organization
more efficient. In addition, the
Medical Center hopes to increase
the number of clinical physicians
it works with and increase the
number of patients coming to
Stanford for care.

According to the blueprint for
the change, SHS may "broaden
its base of primary care" through
several options "ranging from the
outright purchase of primary-care
practices to various contractual
agreements."
Bloem said is it "highly likely"
that the Medical Center will try to
form some sort of new relation
ships with primary-care doctors
— such as pediatricians or
internists — within a 10- or 12-
mile area.
Finally, the consolidation is
expected to make Stanford "one
stop shopping" for health care,
offering the range from basic care
to the most advanced medical
techniques, Bloem said. This
should make the Medical Center
more attractive to groups looking
for health care and more likely to
receive managed care contracts.
"One of the intents of the new
organization is to make it more
responsive to the market. To the
extent that it succeeds, it will fur
ther the research" and teaching
at the Medical School, said David
Mendelow, associate vice presi
dent for administration at the
Medical School.
The restructuring effort was

started by Casper over a year ago,
and was one of Casper's first
moves when he came to Stanford.
Since June, more than 100 people
have taken part in working
groups to examine specific areas
of the plan and produce the cur
rent detailed blueprint.
Changing finances
The plan will also change the
way patient money is collected
and disbursed. In the past, the
hospital has collected and paid
out its own income, as did the fac
ulty clinical program. Under the
new plan, however, SHS will col
lect all clinical income and dis
tribute it among participating
doctors, the Medical School, the
hospital and other areas covered
by SHS. How the money will be
disbursed will be decided by
agreements among the groups
under SHS.
At best, this will allow the col
lection and payment of money to
be more flexible. It will also help
give individual doctors and the
organization as a whole incen
tives to work more efficiently,
Bloem said.
At worst, the report warns,
"there are very real threats to the

academic enterprise" if the profit
margins that help fund academic
medicine continue to drop. Even
tually, the report pledges to use
all SHS proceeds — minus costs,
financial reserves and invest
ments — "to support the academ
ic mission of the clinical faculty."
Bloem admitted that restruc
turing is to some extent uncertain
— there is no guarantee that it
will in fact make the operations of
the Medical Center more efficient.
However, Bloem said, the admin
istrators making changes at the
Medical Center are trying to be
"very, very clear-eyed and
resolved to be highly cost effi
cient," so that faculty are ade
quately reimbursed.
The task force report also said
that efficiency will be improved by
merging some areas that might be
duplicated by different depart
ments at the hospital and faculty
clinics or School of Medicine. Now
separate financial information
and human resources depart
ments will begin to work together
under the plan. In this way, SHS
will allow for "further cost-cut
ting through combining opera
tions, for more effective market
ing and contracting and for

strategic investments and part
nerships," the report said.
The report states that layoffs
and changes in salary and benefit
levels are possible consequences
of such consolidation. But Donald
Tower — the executive director of
the Faculty Practice Program and
a member of the working group
that studied consolidation — said
it is too early to tell what depart
ments will be consolidated or
what the consequences of any
consolidation would be.
"Planning for the restructur
ing of the Medical Center is not
completed by any stretch of the
imagination," Tower said. "There
are certainly no current plans for
layoffs."
Starting to work together
Some departments have
already started to work together,
however, and are seeing positive
results. The information systems
departments at the hospital and
faculty clinics have been working
together for several years, said
Victor Arnold, director of infor
mation systems for the Faculty
Practice Program.
Two years ago, the hospital
and Faculty Practice Program

agreed to what Arnold called "a
treaty on networking," which
means both systems agreed to use
the same sorts of systems so they
could electronically communicate.
This has already allowed the two
groups to share information on
patient registration and insur
ance, and Arnold said the hospital
and clinics are trying to standard
ize patient medical records so
they can be sent back and forth.
Now, Arnold said, he is looking
forward to further cooperation.
This weekend, in fact, Arnold said
the Faculty Practice Program's
computer staff is moving, and
they will begin working in the
same space as the hospital's infor
mation systems workers.
Arnold said he had to be care
ful not to consolidate so much
that the department becomes too
large and unresponsive.
But, Arnold said, he thinks
these pitfalls have been avoided
and consolidation has been bene
ficial for information systems.
"I think we've got a new model
for the new health system that will
both save us money, consolidate
some areas" and provide more effi
cient services, Arnold said. "It's a 1
+ 1 + I=3 situation."
