# The
						ASSU's newest target for improvements: itself
## News analysis 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
The ASSU Senate, which has absorbed it
self with proposals of self-reform for the past
two months, has made no changes to its inter
nal structure. But that doesn't mean propos
als for change have been exhausted.
Instead, the senate is turning the looking
glass away from itself and toward the other
branch of student government â€” the Council
of Presidents.
Despite the failure of undergraduate sena
tor Gabe Lucas' proposed amendment to alter
the senate's composition and size, Senate
Chair Greg Waldorf has introduced another
bill which would replace the COP with a sin

gle president.
The proposal reflects the fact that the sen
ate has refocused its sights, looking at the
COP as the source of the problems of repre-

sentation and inaction which
have plagued the ASSU for
years.
"I simply think the stu
dents need one person to look

to as a president," Waldorf said, explaining
the impetus behind his proposal.
Deputy Senate Chair David Golob agreed,
pointing to such situations as tuition increas
es and student representation where "it
would be easier for the University and stu
dent body if there were one representative of
student input."

Combined with the success of the"I Prefer
Not to Have a COP" slate two years ago, Wal
dorf s criticism of the current system has led
some senators to the conclusion that the exec
utive branch is at the heart of the ASSU's
problems.
In fact, this sentiment led graduate sena
tor Neil Crellin to submit a somewhat ex
treme constitutional amendment to remove
the executive branch altogether. Though the
bill was defeated, it signaled general dissatis
faction among some senators with the COP.
However, COP member Jason Snyder said
the senate is missing the point by failing to
enact real change in its own organization and
workings.
"The executive branch is easier to ap

proach [with reforms], but easier doesn't
mean that it's the needed reform," he said.
"We're stronger in a group because we're
more representative of the students when
meeting with administrators."
In many ways, these new suggestions
aimed at the executive branch are simply
translations of those Lucas and other sena
tors brought forward in proposing to down
size and district the senate.
Combined with the growing dissatisfac
tion with the status quo, these proposals indi
cate that senators feel they must make some
reforms to the ASSU if it is to maintain its sta
tus as a viable institution.
