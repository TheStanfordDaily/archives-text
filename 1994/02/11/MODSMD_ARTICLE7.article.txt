# The 						ASSU's newest target for improvements: itself
## News analysis 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
The ASSU Senate, which has absorbed it
self with proposals of self-reform for the past
two months, has made no changes to its inter
nal structure. But that doesn't mean propos
als for change have been exhausted.
Instead, the senate is turning the looking
glass away from itself and toward the other
branch of student government — the Council
of Presidents.
Despite the failure of undergraduate sena
tor Gabe Lucas' proposed amendment to alter
the senate's composition and size, Senate
Chair Greg Waldorf has introduced another
bill which would replace the COP with a sin

gle president.
The proposal reflects the fact that the sen
ate has refocused its sights, looking at the
COP as the source of the problems of repre-

sentation and inaction which
have plagued the ASSU for
years.
"I simply think the stu
dents need one person to look

to as a president," Waldorf said, explaining
the impetus behind his proposal.
Deputy Senate Chair David Golob agreed,
pointing to such situations as tuition increas
es and student representation where "it
would be easier for the University and stu
dent body if there were one representative of
student input."

Combined with the success of the"I Prefer
Not to Have a COP" slate two years ago, Wal
dorf s criticism of the current system has led
some senators to the conclusion that the exec
utive branch is at the heart of the ASSU's
problems.
In fact, this sentiment led graduate sena
tor Neil Crellin to submit a somewhat ex
treme constitutional amendment to remove
the executive branch altogether. Though the
bill was defeated, it signaled general dissatis
faction among some senators with the COP.
However, COP member Jason Snyder said
the senate is missing the point by failing to
enact real change in its own organization and
workings.
"The executive branch is easier to ap

proach [with reforms], but easier doesn't
mean that it's the needed reform," he said.
"We're stronger in a group because we're
more representative of the students when
meeting with administrators."
In many ways, these new suggestions
aimed at the executive branch are simply
translations of those Lucas and other sena
tors brought forward in proposing to down
size and district the senate.
Combined with the growing dissatisfac
tion with the status quo, these proposals indi
cate that senators feel they must make some
reforms to the ASSU if it is to maintain its sta
tus as a viable institution.
"There's a perception that we're
not doing what we should be
doing," undergraduate senator
Mork Murdock said. "But a lot of
that is not based in reality."
Even so, sources in the senate
say the senate's push to restruc
ture may be indicative of a lack of
confidence in the system.
And because all amendments to
the ASSU Constitution must be
approved by two-thirds of stu
dents, some senators have suggest
ed that a wide range of choices —
including, perhaps, Waldorf s pro
posal — should be offered to stu
dents in the spring general elec
tion. That means students may
find themselves deciding on the
permanence and makeup of the
ASSU executive this spring.
Golob, for one, says he supports

putting these issues to a referen
dum. "I would like to see the
options [in Lucas' bill] put forward
to the student body separately," he
said.
In addition to questioning the
fundamentals of student govern
ment's structure, students and
administrators continue to voice
concerns that the ASSU is not
meeting their needs. "Students
are not being motivated to become
involved in the senate," Lucas
said.
"I think we are representing the
views of the students but the com
munication back and forth isn't as
strong as it could be," admitted
Murdock.
Problems with the relationship
between the ASSU, students and
the University have made senators
painfully aware of the shortcom
ings of the plan for student govern
ment which has survived largely
unchanged since the early 19705.
In fact, Waldorfs proposed sys

tem to elect a single president was
in use prior to the last ASSU con
stitutional convention held in 1969.
The COP came into existence
largely because students felt that
four people could better shoulder
the burden of governing than could
one. This argument has been used
many times to justify the existence
of this peculiar executive body.
With the senate's current track
record on restructuring, questions
remain about whether it will be
able to come up with any proposal
at all. Last year's dissolution of the
COP by the Prefer slate was
prompted, after all, by student vote.
But if senators are able to con
vince themselves that changes are
in students' best interests, they
may be willing to create real
reform.
"I think we ought to be able to
come up with some kind of propos
al to put before the students,"
Golob said. "In the end it should be
their decision to make."

reforms to the ASSU if it is to maintain its sta
tus as a viable institution.
"There's a perception that we're
not doing what we should be
doing," undergraduate senator
Mork Murdock said. "But a lot of
that is not based in reality."
Even so, sources in the senate
say the senate's push to restruc
ture may be indicative of a lack of
confidence in the system.
And because all amendments to
the ASSU Constitution must be
approved by two-thirds of stu
dents, some senators have suggest
ed that a wide range of choices —
including, perhaps, Waldorf s pro
posal — should be offered to stu
dents in the spring general elec
tion. That means students may
find themselves deciding on the
permanence and makeup of the
ASSU executive this spring.
Golob, for one, says he supports

putting these issues to a referen
dum. "I would like to see the
options [in Lucas' bill] put forward
to the student body separately," he
said.
In addition to questioning the
fundamentals of student govern
ment's structure, students and
administrators continue to voice
concerns that the ASSU is not
meeting their needs. "Students
are not being motivated to become
involved in the senate," Lucas
said.
"I think we are representing the
views of the students but the com
munication back and forth isn't as
strong as it could be," admitted
Murdock.
Problems with the relationship
between the ASSU, students and
the University have made senators
painfully aware of the shortcom
ings of the plan for student govern
ment which has survived largely
unchanged since the early 19705.
In fact, Waldorfs proposed sys

tem to elect a single president was
in use prior to the last ASSU con
stitutional convention held in 1969.
The COP came into existence
largely because students felt that
four people could better shoulder
the burden of governing than could
one. This argument has been used
many times to justify the existence
of this peculiar executive body.
With the senate's current track
record on restructuring, questions
remain about whether it will be
able to come up with any proposal
at all. Last year's dissolution of the
COP by the Prefer slate was
prompted, after all, by student vote.
But if senators are able to con
vince themselves that changes are
in students' best interests, they
may be willing to create real
reform.
"I think we ought to be able to
come up with some kind of propos
al to put before the students,"
Golob said. "In the end it should be
their decision to make."
