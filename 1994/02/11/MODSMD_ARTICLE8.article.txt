# Conference calls for urban renewal
## Focus sparked by L.A. riots 
### Nina Wasow 
Urban renewal and the aftermath of the 1992 Los
Angeles riots will be the primary issues discussed at
the 11th annual You Can Make A Difference confer
ence Saturday at Kresge Auditorium.
The event — a joint project of the Haas Center for
Public Service and the ASSU which is the largest stu
dent-run conference at Stanford — is titled "Cities in
Crisis: Promoting Urban Change," and is expected to
draw as many as 750 people. Among the scheduled
speakers are Rev. Floyd Thompkins, Law Prof. Sally
Dickson and San Jose mayor Susan Hammer.
The purpose of the event is "to empower students
with how to make a difference on an individual level,
and to realize that our professions
and public service don't have to
be separate," said junior Cathy
Amirfar, the conference organiz
er. "We will try and come up with
some solutions."
The subject of this year's con
ference was largely sparked by
the unrest in L.A. two years ago.
Also, Amirfar said she was
inspired after attending Dick
son's class on that subject last
spring. "The class was meant for
30 people, but about 150 showed
up. I realized that a lot of people
want to talk about this issue"

The day-long symposium will
consist of a variety of workshops
on welfare, crime, poverty, educa
tion, family issues, environment,
health care and youth in Ameria's
inner cities. Also, a service oppor
tunities fair and a film seminar
called "Anatomy of a Riot" will be
presented.
The conference will culminate
with a town meeting moderated
by Hammer, Los Angeles com
munity activist Tony Massengale
and KRON-TV anchor Belva
Davis.
According to conference pub
licity coordinator Kathy Viet, the
conference is designed to be not
just an abstract discussion, but a
launching pad for tangible
reform. "It lets students have dia

logue, with the goal of bringing
about change," she said. "These
aren't just talking heads. . .this is
a chance for people to channel
their ideas."
Amirfar added that the confer
ence will "try to come up with
some solutions."
The conference is funded by
the Haas Center for Public Ser
vice and ASSU. Viet said she
expects approximately half the
participants to be students. Peo
ple can drop in at any time during
the day, but the events will start
at 9:00 a.m. and end at 5:00 p.m.
Several events preceded the
conference. A concert today at the
Coffee House with pop-jazz group
Alphabet Soup will be the final
prelude to the conference.
