Dearest Eric,
No one has ever touched my heart
the way you have. You mean the
world to me I
Love always, Laura
Lorena,
To a women I admire and respect.
I am warmed by the strength,
beauty, and compassion that radi
ates from your smile.
Surely the cmelest question in
life must be "What if."
And for me, I am consigned to
reflect on mere possibles that now
will never be. I offer the good in
me silently for my cowardice and
lack of self-confidence
prevent me from doing more.
(Did you already know that?)
I wish you the best as you
approach graduation with the
hope that you may hold dear a
part of me as you have left an
indelible mark on my soul I will
miss your smile, your laugh, your
voice, your company.
You have touched my life as few
others have
These words I offer to you in
regret that I can give you no more.
To My Eucalyptus Love your
favorite Koala Bear
