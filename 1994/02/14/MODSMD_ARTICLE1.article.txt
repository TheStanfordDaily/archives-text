### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
History Prof. Judith Brown is
one of three finalists for the pres
idency of Goucher College in
Towson, Md., a small liberal arts
college located about 15 miles
north of Baltimore.
The other contenders are Judy
Jolley Mohraz, associate provost
for student academic affairs at
Southern Methodist University,
and Thomas E. Scheye, the
provost and acting president of
Baltimore's Loyola College.
Goucher's board of trustees
plans to make its selection by the
end of the month, according to a
report in Saturday's Baltimore
Sun.
"It's an exciting possibility â€”
I'd be interested in exploring it
and seeing what develops," said
Brown, a specialist on Renais
sance Italy. "I don't know what
my chances are. . . . These are
complicated decisions."
Goucher, an all-women's col
lege until 1987, currently has an
enrollment of about 1,000. If se
lected, Brown would succeed
Rhoda M. Dorsey, who has served
as president for the past 20 years.
Although she has no past affil
iation with the college, Brown
said she was contacted by repre
sentatives of the institution who
asked if she would be interested
in applying.
The three finalists were cho
sen from an initial candidate list
