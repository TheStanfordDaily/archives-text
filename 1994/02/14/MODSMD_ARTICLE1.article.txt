# Final cut
## History prof on short list to lead Goucher College 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
History Prof. Judith Brown is
one of three finalists for the pres
idency of Goucher College in
Towson, Md., a small liberal arts
college located about 15 miles
north of Baltimore.
The other contenders are Judy
Jolley Mohraz, associate provost
for student academic affairs at
Southern Methodist University,
and Thomas E. Scheye, the
provost and acting president of
Baltimore's Loyola College.
Goucher's board of trustees
plans to make its selection by the
end of the month, according to a
report in Saturday's Baltimore
Sun.
"It's an exciting possibility —
I'd be interested in exploring it
and seeing what develops," said
Brown, a specialist on Renais
sance Italy. "I don't know what
my chances are. . . . These are
complicated decisions."
Goucher, an all-women's col
lege until 1987, currently has an
enrollment of about 1,000. If se
lected, Brown would succeed
Rhoda M. Dorsey, who has served
as president for the past 20 years.
Although she has no past affil
iation with the college, Brown
said she was contacted by repre
sentatives of the institution who
asked if she would be interested
in applying.
The three finalists were cho
sen from an initial candidate list
of about 200 and each went
through a series of meetings with
campus groups last week.
Brown said she feels prepared
for the administrative position.
"I've had a variety of interesting
activities over the years," Brown
said. "I've had a lot of experience
with alumni and committees as
well as in the classroom."
At Stanford, Brown has served
on myriad committees since her
arrival in 1982 and currently
chairs the president's committee
on faculty and staff benefits. In
the late '80s, she served on the
task force which recommended
changing the Western Civiliza
tion requirement for freshmen to
Cultures, Ideas and Values.
Brown, who often teaches the
first quarter of the History track
in CIV, also serves as director of
the Institute for Research on
Women and Gender.
History Prof. James Sheehan,
who has taught the Cultures,
Ideas and Values course with
Brown, said Goucher "would be

lucky to have" his cohort.
"She has excellent values, fine
ability to articulate the basic val
ues of a university," he said. "She
is a fine scholar and a great teach
er — all the things that would be
important in a university presi
dent."
Despite the college's history
and the fact that two of the three
finalists are women, Brown said
she did not feel that gender would
be a deciding factor. "I thing
being a university president is
not an easy task for both women
and men anywhere. It's difficult
no matter who does it."
Brown said she "would hope to
make Goucher a more nationally
visible liberal arts college. I would
hope to attract a lot more minori
ty students and a lot of students
from different parts of the coun
try.
"It's a very good, small liberal
arts college. It had a very distin
guished history as a women's col
lege," she added.
However, Brown also indicat
ed some ambivalence at moving
East. "I would have a lot of fond
memories. I like this place," she
said. "It's a serious decision. I'm
weighing all the pros and cons."
