## Serbs begin turning over artillery to U.N. 
### 
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — Bosnian Serbs besieging Sara
jevo resumed turning in their big guns
yesterday after the United Nations
accepted a compromise plan.
The Muslim-dominated Bosnian
government expressed concern that
the Serbs were just buying time to pre
vent NATO air strikes that could
begin Feb. 21 if the guns ringing Sara
jevo are not pulled back.
The compromise allows Serbs to
turn in their heavy weapons at U.N.-
monitored Serb bases, rather than at
the Sarajevo airport as originally
planned, said Maj. Jose Labandeira, a
U.N. spokesman.
The Bosnian army objected. "Those
weapons can be returned to combat
positions very fast," said Bosnian
army Gen. Fikret Muslimovic.
"I am afraid that such an approach

and an attempt to appease the aggres
sion further would bring a hardening
of the Serbian position," said Haris
the Bosnian prime minister.
The Serbs earlier insisted they
would surrender their guns only if the
Bosnian infantry abandoned its front
line positions. But after heavy lobby
ing by U.N. officials the Serbs turned
over 13 heavy weapons yesterday,
bringing the total to 36 guns: 26 Ser
bian and 10 Bosnian.
The Bosnian Serbs are estimated to
have at least 500 heavy weapons. The
Bosnian army has about 50.
NATO has threatened to start air
strikes against the Serb guns if they
are not withdrawn at least 12 miles
from downtown Sarajevo by midnight,
Feb. 20.
But the U.N. commander for
Bosnia, Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose,

seems to be pursuing whatever strate
gy will work to get control over the
guns and enforce peace in the capital.
Rose, hustling to get his men in
place while the sky is still clear of
shrapnel and bullets, reinforced the
French-occupied cease-fire lines with
the first contingent of a 1,000-member
Malaysian battalion.
Rose told reporters he plans to form
a double-protection line, with French
troops facing the Serbs and
Malaysians facing the Muslim-domi
nated government side.
While the Bosnian Serbs have
rejected NATO's ultimatum, their
guns have been almost silent since
Thursday. One artillery round was
fired yesterday, and there were no
injuries.
An offensive by Croat fighters on
government-held Gornji Vakuf, 40

miles west of Sarajevo, cut the supply
route from the Croatian coast to
Tuzla, a Muslim enclave and aid cen
ter for hundreds of thousands of peo
ple in eastern Bosnia, U.N. officials
said.
About 200,000 people have been
killed or reported missing since the
war began in April 1992 when Bosnia
left the Serb-dominated Yugoslav fed
eration.
With the four-day Sarajevo truce
still shaky, the U.S. Embassy packed
the families of 35 diplomats out of Bel
grade, Yugoslavia. Dutch, British and
German officials also have urged their
citizens to leave Yugoslavia.
The pullout of dependents was a
precaution, against Serb reprisals in
the event of air strikes. Many in the
Serb-dominated Yugoslav government
and army support the Bosnian Serbs.
