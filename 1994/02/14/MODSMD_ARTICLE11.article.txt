Downhill gold
LILLEHAMMER, Norway (AP) — Tommy
Moe succeeded yesterday where Olympic offi
cials had failed: He brought everyone's atten
tion back to the Games.
Moe, an underdog American skiing just
hours after the resolution of the Tonya Hard
ing debacle, left thousands of Norwegians in
stunned silence when he won the men's down
hill gold over local hero Kjetil Andre Aamodt.
Moe's victory was the closest Alpine race in
Olympic history. He collected the first U.S.
men's Alpine gold in a decade and only the sec
ond ever.
"I didn't even have any thoughts in my
mind that I was going to win," said Moe, who is
competing in his second Olympics. "I just fig
ured, 'Hey, I'll ski the best I can.' "
Moe's fine performance was the first Ameri
can men's downhill gold since 1984. Billy John
son — who, like Moe, had never won even a
World Cup race — captured the first gold in
Sarajevo.
As for Aamodt, he now has a silver to go
with the gold and bronze he won two years ago
at Albertville, France.
If Aamodt couldn't win, there was a certain
justice in Moe's victory. The skier has a dozen
relatives in the Oslo area and plans to visit an
82-year-old uncle, Olvar Anderson, before
heading home.
'The Scream' stolen
OSLO, Norway (AP) — Despite a video of
two men stealing the country's most famous
painting — "The Scream" by Edvard Munch
— police said yesterday they had no clue as to
who the thieves were.
"We have received certain tips but nothing
firm," said police duty officer Ingebrigt Elde
gard. He said a reward may be posted.
Police were searching for a Mercedes sta
tion wagon the two men were believed to have
used when they drove away from the National
Art Museum on Saturday morning.
A video taken by a security camera, broad
cast on television, showed a man climbing a
ladder on the exterior of the museum and
entering the building through a window. Fifty
seconds later he handed the painting to his
waiting accomplice beneath the window.
Police and art experts said it was highly
improbable that the painting could be sold
since it is so well known. No ransom demand
has been made, Eldegard said.
