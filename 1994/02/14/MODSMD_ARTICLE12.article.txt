LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -
The money-losing Arkansas real
estate venture that has entangled
the first family in a federal probe
began generating a small income
months before President and Mrs.
Clinton sold their interest.
The Clintons decided not to
take any of the money before end
ing their 14-year relationship with
Whitewater Development Corp. in
December 1992, one of their
lawyers told The Associated Press.
In May 1992, Whitewater paid
off its remaining loans, enabling it
to begin making a little money.
Since then, those proceeds —
which total less than $200 a
month — have gone to the Clin
tons' former business partner,
James McDougal.
The Clintons have said they
invested and lost nearly $69,000
during their years as co-owners of
Whitewater.
They formed the venture in
1978 with McDougal and his wife
to build a vacation and retirement
community in Arkansas.
The venture is now a focus of a

federal investigation into a failed
Arkansas savings and loan owned
by McDougal and other business
dealings with ties to the Clintons.
The Clintons sold their half of
Whitewater to McDougal in
December 1992 for $1,000. They
have said they never made any
money on their investment.
During most of the Clintons'
involvement in Whitewater, rev
enues from the venture went to
pay off principal and interest on
the original $203,000 mortgage
the two couples used to buy the
property.
But after that loan was finally
paid ofTin 1992, McDougal said the
Clintons could have begun sharing
in the small proceeds. Instead, they
agreed to let McDougal — who had
been felled by a stroke and depres
sion and saw his financial empire
collapse — keep the money they
could have taken to cut their losses.
"For a few months, I suppose,
they could have been (receiving
income) if we'd had an agreement
on what they had coming,"
McDougal said.
