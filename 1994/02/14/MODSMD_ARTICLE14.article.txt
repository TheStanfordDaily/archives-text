## Editorial Yielding real results Stanford should revamp its admissions policies to raise student yield rates 
### 
NO ONE likes to lose to Har
vard. But, according to
statistics revealed last week,
it seems that Stanford's under
graduate admissions office has
recently been losing to our Cam
bridge competitor — badly.
Of the several hundred students
accepted to both schools last year,
nearly four out of five chose Crim
son over Cardinal, according by a
member of the of the Board of
Trustees' Committee on Academic
Policy. Even though the number of
students accepted by both Harvard
and Stanford has increased by 50
percent in the last 10 years, the
percentage of "common admits"
who choose to come to Stanford has
decreased.
The admissions office has rightly
identified this situation as a problem,
and is looking into ways to attract
more top applicants to the Farm.
A Faculty Senate study group
was formed earlier this year to try
to "build a better model of admis
sions sensitive to challenges high
school seniors face," according to
Dean of Admissions James Mon
toya. The ideas include instituting
some sort of early admissions pro
gram or even changing to a multi
ple-period filing system like gradu
ate schools. The group also plans to
look at the role of alumni and the
Jordan scholars program in
attracting students.
These ideas certainly merit dis
cussion, and many suggested ways
to improve the yield rate are simi
lar to ones that have been in place
at other institutions for years.
For example, some type of early
admissions program is long over
due. While many other schools
begin accepting students in the fall
under early decision programs,
Stanford currently waits until the
spring, when students may have

already decided to go elsewhere. In
addition, a multiple-period filing
system may help spread the
avalanche of paperwork that
admissions officials must deal with
in the spring.
The use of the Jordan scholar
program and alumni in attracting
students should also be examined
closely. Stanford could try having
alumni interviews like some Ivies
offer. These wouldn't necessarily be
an integral part of the admissions
process, but could give students —
who may not know anyone related
to Stanford — a perspective on the
Farm that glossy picture books and
statistics cannot provide.
Stanford should also look at the
goals of Pro Fro week in April. This
year, planners are trying to include
more academic-oriented program
ming in the week's activities to
emphasize Stanford's academics.
This is a good idea; spring quarter
at the Farm can give visitors the
impression that Stanford may be
too much fun to get any work done.
An increased focus on academics
should show prospective freshmen
that Stanford's commitment to in
class activities is strong.
The Jordan scholars program
also could use a boost. In its cur
rent form, the six-year-old program
tries to recruit admitted students
with strong academic records by
recognizing them as "Jordan schol
ars" in a letter sent with the offer
of admission. Perhaps the program
could be revamped to include bene
fits that would encourage the Jor
dan scholars to matriculate.
These efforts can do much to
address Stanford's lagging yield
rates. Stanford may not carry the
same reputation that a Harvard or
a Yale does, particularly on the East
coast. But age and reputation
should not be the prevailing factors
when students decide which school
to attend. And sub-zero winter
temperatures aren't necessary for a
superb academic institution.
By seriously re-examining its
admissions policies, Stanford can
be sure to bring other factors into
the picture, where they belong.
