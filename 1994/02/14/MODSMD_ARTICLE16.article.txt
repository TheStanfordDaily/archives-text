## Look-alike's life is no joke 
### 
I LOOK LIKE Jerry Seinfeld. You
know Mr. Seinfeld, don't you? He's a
comedian. He is the creator of the
self-titled second-highest rated T.V. show
in the country. He can often be seen
court-side at Knicks games, right
between Spike Lee and Tom Brokaw.
Suffice it to say he is "master of his
domain," and I look like him.
This is not something my publicist is
jamming down the throats of the talk
shows. That's because I don't even have a
publicist. But seriously.
It's a fairly close resemblance. We
have dark hair, but his is long and wavy
and mine is short and curly. My eyes are
green, his are brown. He has a long face
and mine is a bit wirW W«> gmmH li|c P
twins, don't we? No matter what tne sit
uation, though, someone is bound to
come up to me and say, "Hey, has anyone
ever told you . . . ?"
What is it that draws the comparison?
Is it that one day I will be destined for
greatness? Doubtful. Are my comedy
stylings as brilliant as said professional?
Unlikely. Is it my Jewish features — hair,
nose, lips? Probably. Not that there's
anything wrong with that!
Imagine someone coming up to you
saying, "You know, you could pass for
Mel Gibson's twin and no one would
know the difference." Or, "That plastic
surgery makes you look eerily like
Michael Jackson." How about, "Has any
one ever told you, you bear a striking
resemblance to Quazimodo?"

It all sounds like fun, right? I'd rather
eat sneezed-on pasta primavera.
I must admit, the first time anybody
said anything I was watching him do
stand-up with my parents. After he fin
ished, they said, "Hey Jess. ..." I was
doomed. I might as well have been having
a love affair with John Cheever.
Then the show came out and he got
more famous. That's when people started
to talk.
The first time anyone said anything
in public, I went along with it. Let's just
say we both had a bit of liquid courage in
us. I don't think she was all that
impressed because she spat her gum in
the napkin I signed and walked away.
thmi-h. There was no
-second spitter.
Whether or not she believed me, I was
left standing there, pretending I was
someone else. It was the only time, too.
Now, when the show comes on or his pic
ture appears anywhere I'll hear, "There
you are." or "C'mon, talk like him. Talk
like Jerry."
Since that night, I have not used my
quasi-famous countenance to get a job, a
seat at a Chinese restaurant, or laid. The
temptation is there, especially for the
third option, because I do a hell of an
impression.
But that's not me. I'm sorry, Jerry's
not here right now. He'll be back soon.
He's out getting the inside of his car
cleaned.
Nevertheless, it happens. I just smile

and say, "Yes, I know." I suppose they
could say worse things. I could have a
huge goiter on my neck.
I have friends that look like famous
people and I try not to mention their like
nesses because I know how much I hate
it. No one wants to hear how much they
look like someone famous, glamorous or
funny. Jerry can't not be funny.
Someone once told me that beauty is
so subjective. Well, if beauty is judged by
others then call me Jeff Gillooly, because
I always thought as long as you were
happy with yourself it didn't matter
what other people thought. Besides,
there are so many other things in life to
worry about like family, health and fur
niture. Vanity does you wrong most of
the time.
Why would I want to look like Jerry
Seinfeld anyway? He is carrying an entire
network on his back, he has front-row
seats at Madison Square Garden, and
he's a 38-year-old man dating an 18-year
old frosh at George Washington Univer
sity.
Did I mention I look like Jerry Sein
feld?

Jesse Johannesen is trying to find, some
one who looks like Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
He hopes his girlfriend doesn't mind.
