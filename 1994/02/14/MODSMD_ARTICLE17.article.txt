## New admissions strategies needed to reverse trends 
### 
I WRITE to clarify remarks quoted in
Friday's article ("Fewer top frosh
coming to Farm?"). While the direct
quotations represent my views, the inter
pretive phrases surrounding them do not.
For the record, the following quote,
which The Daily did not print, made up
more than 25 percent of my brief state
ment: "I want to emphasize that my
remarks are not intended as a criticism
of the Kennedy or Casper administra
tions. Indeed, the increasing competi
tion from other schools [for outstanding
high school graduates] is due, not to
Stanford's failure to attract outstanding
students, but to Stanford's success in
doing so."

Basically, many faculty and top admin
istrators have become concerned about
this: although Stanford retains its posi
tion second only to Harvard (which wins
more geographically sticky Easterners) in
getting top high school students, the yield
trend has turned significantly against the
University, influenced by selectively nega
tive national media exposure associated
with earthquakes and indirect costs. It
turns out that high school students are
significantly influenced by media reports,
such as the U.S. News and World Report
rankings of 1987.
Unlike our competitors such as Har
vard, we traditionally have not employed
early admissions, special inducements to

get top students, or alumni application
interviews leading to personal relation
ships with applicants. These tactics can
provide better information to counter
media selection bias. Thus we have
unutilized strategies available to counter
the misguided trend. Simply matching
these vigorous strategies could improve
our position significantly. Failure to do
so soon could continue the drop.
I feel that my constituents, the stu
dents, have the right and need to know
the situation, because the decision-mak
ers' choices will significantly affect future
Stanford classes. Also, public support will
make it easier for administrators to gain
organizational momentum on this issue,

along with the many other vital issues —
government negotiations, budget cuts,
new accreditation requirements and the
study of undergraduate education — with
which they are very successfully con
cerned.
Stanford worrying about yields is a bit
like the San Francisco 49ers worrying
about only winning a game by eight
points. Nevertheless, when those margins
start to decline, the fact that other teams
use more recruiters, and play the entire
first half before our own team even takes
the field, becomes a bit hard to accept.
