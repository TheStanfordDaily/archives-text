# Professors show poor understanding of the Asian-American myth
## 
### 
I am writing in response to Prof.
Emeritus Ronald Hilton's Feb. 7 letter
to The Daily, specifically his opinions on
the "over-representation of Asians" at
Stanford. I certainly agree with him
that the "wind of freedom" does not
blow at Stanford, as evidenced by the
ignorant assumptions that he and other
faculty members make about the experi
ences of Asians on and outside this cam
pus.
By mentioning the "over-representa
tion of Asians" at Stanford, I assume

Hilton is referring to the well-known
fact that Asians comprise almost a quar
ter of the undergraduate population
here, yet only three percent of the U.S.
population.
However, such comparison is based
conveniently on lumping at least 13 dis
tinctly different "Asian" ethnicities
together under one misleading category.
When this single label is used to expose
the supposed over-representation of
Asians in higher education, it feeds into
the "model minority myth," the popular
notion that Asian-Americans have over
come discrimination to become economi
cally well-off and better-educated than
the rest of the country.
Such an assumption has been used to
continue ignoring the needs of many
Asians who have not attained the

socioeconomic status of the supposed
"average" Asian-American — such as 90
percent of the Hmong community in
Fresno who insted of which is on welfare,
or Asian youths involved in gang or drug
related activities.
And at Stanford, the experiences of
Asians remain undervalued and under
represented. Hilton and Prof. Stephen
Krasner (in his remarks at the Jan. 6
Faculty Senate meeting) conveniently
did not mention that while nearly a
quarter of undergraduates are Asian,
none of the deans of the seven academic
schools are Asian, nor has there ever
been an Asian president or provost at
Stanford. In fact, Asians at Stanford
have historically been under-represent
ed among higher levels of administra
tive positions.

Moreover, the University continues
to dismiss repeated calls for an Asian
American Studies program at Stanford
that can be traced back to at least the
early 19705. Now, I don't seriously
blame Hilton and others for their bla
tantly uninformed opinions about the
experiences of Asians/Pacific Islanders
on and off this campus. They only sym
bolize the inability of traditional aca
demic values and curriculum to provide
future leaders with the skills to maneu
ver successfully in an increasingly plu
ralist society.
Yet, if the interests of Asians were
truly represented on campus, people like
Ronald Hilton and Stephen Krasner
never would have taught at Stanford.
