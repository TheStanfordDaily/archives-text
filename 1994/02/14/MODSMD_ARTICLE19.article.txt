### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
A late Stanford rally fell short in
a basketball game dominated by
spurts from both teams, as the
Cardinal men dropped a 71 -69 deci
sion to Arizona State at Maples
Pavilion Saturday.
"Those are tough ones," said
Cardinal coach Mike Montgomery.
"We were ready to play and we
played well in the first half, but we
couldn't finish it off."
Down by 17 points at halftime,
Arizona State (12-8 overall, 7-4 in
the Pacific 10 Conference), erased
that deficit in the first 11 minutes
of the second period, and led by a

Andy Poppink hit one of two free

But Sun Devil forward Hon
Reily hit a pair of foul shots five
seconds later, giving Arizona State
a 71-69 lead.
With two seconds remaining,
Cardinal guard Brevin Knight
missed two free throws, the second
one intentionally. But Stanford
was unable to secure the ensuing
rebound.
"That's kind of ASU basket
ball," said Sun Devil center James
Bacon, in referring to the streaks

that both sides ran off in the game.
"We've played like that all year."
Although the Cardinal took a
46-29 lead into the half, Arizona
State made a pair of locker-room
adjustments that stymied Stanford
after the break.
The Sun Devils, which forced
only three Cardinal turnovers
while playing their full-court man
to-man press in the first half,
switched to a 1-2-2 zone full-court
trap in the second period.
The change produced results —
Stanford turned the ball over 12
times in the second half.
