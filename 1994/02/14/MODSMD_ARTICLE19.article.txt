## Men's hoops drops heartbreaker to Arizona St. Defensive trap rallies Sun Devils after halftime 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
A late Stanford rally fell short in
a basketball game dominated by
spurts from both teams, as the
Cardinal men dropped a 71 -69 deci
sion to Arizona State at Maples
Pavilion Saturday.
"Those are tough ones," said
Cardinal coach Mike Montgomery.
"We were ready to play and we
played well in the first half, but we
couldn't finish it off."
Down by 17 points at halftime,
Arizona State (12-8 overall, 7-4 in
the Pacific 10 Conference), erased
that deficit in the first 11 minutes
of the second period, and led by a

62-52 margin with five minutes
remaining in the game.
Stanford (13-7, 6-5) stormed
back, tying the game at 69 when
Andy Poppink hit one of two free
throws with 22 seconds to play.
But Sun Devil forward Hon
Reily hit a pair of foul shots five
seconds later, giving Arizona State
a 71-69 lead.
With two seconds remaining,
Cardinal guard Brevin Knight
missed two free throws, the second
one intentionally. But Stanford
was unable to secure the ensuing
rebound.
"That's kind of ASU basket
ball," said Sun Devil center James
Bacon, in referring to the streaks

that both sides ran off in the game.
"We've played like that all year."
Although the Cardinal took a
46-29 lead into the half, Arizona
State made a pair of locker-room
adjustments that stymied Stanford
after the break.
The Sun Devils, which forced
only three Cardinal turnovers
while playing their full-court man
to-man press in the first half,
switched to a 1-2-2 zone full-court
trap in the second period.
The change produced results —
Stanford turned the ball over 12
times in the second half.
"Their trap took us out of our

momentum," guard Dion Cross
said. "We just didn't handle it."
"Our press became effective,"
Arizona State coach Bill Frieder
said. "That was the key to the sec
ond half."
Or one of the keys, that is.
Frieder himself played a large part
in the other change. With 1:09 to
play in the first half, the Sun Devil
coach was ejected for arguing vehe
mently with referee Charles Range.
Perhaps Range and company
felt guilty about giving Frieder the
first ejection of his career. Perhaps
the Cardinal was playing a more
aggressive style of basketball in the

second half. No matter the reason,
Stanford, after being charged with
only three fouls in the entire first
period, picked up three in the first
three minutes of the second half.
Arizona State, after shooting no
free throws before intermission,
was given 28 foul shots in the
game's final 20 minutes.
"I don't know if it was us or
what," Cross said. "But everything
we did (after Frieder was ejected),
the refs were on it."
After Arizona State trimmed the
Stanford edge to 22-19, Stanford
rattled off 13 straight points, tak
ing a 35-19 lead when Cross fin
ished a Knight fast-break pass with
4:28 to go in the half.
"This was tough," Montgomery
said. "But we're going to have to
rebound from this."
