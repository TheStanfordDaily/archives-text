# Conference addresses urban change
## 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Rev. Floyd Thompkins Jr. ordered the
audience to stand up and yell for hope at the
end of Saturday's You Can Make A Differ
ence conference, titled "Cities in Crisis: Pro
moting Urban Change."
Thompkins, the associate dean of Memo
rial Church, delivered the closing speech at
the day-long symposium, which drew about
400 participants. The event was jointly
sponsored by the Haas Center for Public
Service and the ASSU.
At the end of his speech, Thompkins cited

the example of Fanny Lou Hamer, a black
Mississippi woman who never completed the
third grade, yet went on to play a pivotal role
in the 1964 Democratic National Conven
tion.
This woman, who had more reason than
anyone to lose hope, had "I'm sick and tired
of being sick and tired" written on her tomb
stone, Thompkins said.
He told the Kresge Auditorium audience
to stand up and shout this phrase in order to
help "rekindle the flames of hope."
"I ask of you to revel in your idealism be
cause the greatest power in the universe is
your sense of right, your sense ofjustice," he

said.
Thompkins began his speech by asking,
"Why is such a conference necessary? Why
does it become more necessary every year?
"How did things get so bad? Why hasn't
anyone done anything about it?" he asked.
Thompkins pointed to fear as the real cri
sis of America. "Because of fear we've built
more prisons than schools," he said. "We are
people who have become ruled by our fear."
Claiming that "the rising tide of fear is
threatening our idealism," Thompkins said
"the chasm between fear and confidence is
traversed by only one bridge —
faith."
"Power is not limited with
what you do. There is a greater
power — the power of human
appeal," he said, adding that
there is "a basic humanity we can
appeal to."
Other conference events
included workshops, an "opportu
nities fair," a video presentation
and a town meeting. "Cities in
Crisis" was the 11th annual con
ference, which is the largest stu
dent-run conference at Stanford.
The town meeting was aimed
at inspiring a productive dialogue
among the audience by address
ing the problems and potential
solutions to urban crises. San
Jose mayor Susan Hammer, Los
Angeles community activist Tony
Massengale and KRON-TV
anchor Ysabel Duron participated
in the meeting.
The meeting dealt with a vari
ety of issues such as how media
coverage influences perceptions,
solutions to the homeless prob

lem and the importance of educa
tion.
Duron said that changing per
ceptions is an "ongoing battle."
She said the formation of a multi
cultural board at KRON-TV is
one example of how the media is
"trying to make changes."
According to Hammer, one of
the best ways to change percep
tions is to "get people involved"
through community service. "It
slowly changes the stereotypical
perceptions that we have about
various types of our society," she
said.
Hammer also pointed out that
around 80 percent of the popula
tion gets its daily news through a
30-second "sound byts." The
media has a responsibility to be
accurate, she said.
One audience member blamed
the media for unfairly portraying
contemporary issues. "The media
has a pre-determined agenda. ...
Their ears are closed to new infor
mation even when it's hitting
them in the face," the person
claimed.
Massengale disagreed, claim
ing that the media can be viewed
"as a potential ally, instead of an
enemy."
