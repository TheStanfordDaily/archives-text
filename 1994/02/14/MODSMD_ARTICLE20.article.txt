# Frieder's ejection fires up Devils
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
Normally, when a team's head
coach gets ejected before the game
has even reached halftime, one
might expect the squad to crumble
without his guidance.
Saturday the Arizona State
players faced that unfavorable
predicament when Sun Devil head
coach Bill Frieder was ejected for
arguing with the officials. Howev
er, they responded with a new
found fervor, and they saved the
crumbling for the Stanford team
instead.
"They're a very emotional team,
and they play off their emotions,"
said Stanford guard Dion Cross,
following the heartbreaking loss.
At one point late in the first
period, the Sun Devils' chances for
victory seemed hopeless.
Moments after Stanford for
ward Andy Poppink bowled over an
Arizona State player while
attempting a shot off the drive,
Frieder screamed continuously at
the officials for failing to call an

offensive foul on Poppink.
Frieder's excessive protesting
resulted in a technical foul, causing
him to become even more infuriat
ed. The head coach stormed onto
the court, arguing with any official
he could find and earning his sec
ond technical foul, an automatic
game ejection, in the process.
"Frieder had no business get
ting out of his coaching area and
coming onto the court," said head
official Charles Range. "That's
why we kicked him out."
One minute and nine seconds
later, a stunned Arizona State
squad stumbled into the halftime
locker room, trailing by seventeen
points. But rather than despair
about the sequence of events near
the end of the half, the Sun Devil
players used it as a rallying point.
"(At halftime), we were just
fired up," said center James Bacon.
"To see coach Frieder get kicked
out just doesn't happen often."
Doesn't happen often? Try
never.
Unlike some NCAA coaches
who purposely get thrown out

when their players need an extra
bit of motivation, Arizona State's
coach was honestly surprised by
his sudden ejection.
"I've never been thrown out
before. I very rarely get techni
cals," said Frieder, who has
coached in the college ranks for 14
years. "I've always had some kind
of warning (from the officials), and
I didn't get that."
Regardless of Frieder's inten
tions, his actions produced the
desired results.
Come second half, a different
Arizona State squad stepped onto
the floor, and it played with pas
sion â€” at Stanford's expense.
The Sun Devils rose to the chal
lenge of playing without Frieder,
most notably with an intensified
full court trap defense that smoth
ered the Cardinal.
"We knew they would come out
extremely aggressive," said Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery. "It
was two different halves of basket
ball."
Defense wasn't the only
aspect in which Arizona State
showed a marked improve
ment.
The Sun Devils dominated
the offensive boards, especially
down the stretch, taking pre
cious seconds away from Stan
ford's comeback attempt.
What appeared to be a back
breaker for the slow-starting
Arizona State team turned out
to be a blessing in disguise.
"I ought to do that more
often," said Frieder. "It's a hell
of a lot easier than being on the
bench."
