It idled, sputtered slightly, then kicked into
gear and roared as usual.
The Cardinal women's basketball team, fac
ing an Arizona State squad with just eight
players on its roster, parlayed a nominal 37-26
halftime edge into a solid 85-59 victory before
just 577 onlookers Saturday night at the Uni
versity Activities Center in Tempe, Ariz.
In maintaining a share of second place in
the Pacific 10 Conference, 14th-ranked Stan
ford (15-5, 8-3 in the Pac-10) ran its winning
streak to four games and completed its first
conference road sweep of the season. The Car
dinal also made it two-for-two on the year
against the woeful Sun Devils (2-16, 0-10), who
were playing their first game since the defec
tion of senior point guard Crystal Cobb
thinned their already-depleted ranks.
"The Arizona State game was a game we
had to win to achieve our season goals," said
Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer.
In addition to establishing some much
needed momentum to kick off the second half
of its Pac-10 season, the Cardinal kept stride
with Washington, who knocked off conference
leading USC in Seattle Saturday. That upset
pulled both the Cardinal and the Huskies with
in two games of the Trojans.
Yet while Stanford never let Arizona State
into Saturday's contest, it nearly put an easy
win in jeopardy with a late first-half funk. The
Cardinal had seized control early, grabbing a
15-4 advantage six and a half minutes into the
game and building it to 31-14 with six minutes
remaining in the period.
But the Sun Devils shook off the effects of
39 percent shooting and 19 first-half turnovers
to embark on a 12-6 run and close the gap to 11
at intermission.
"We needed to be more aggressive," said
Stanford junior forward Rachel Hemmer, who
led all scorers and rebounders with 24 and 11,
respectively. "We had good shots and pressure
defense, but we didn't finish our plays."
Part of the Cardinal's lack of aggression
may be traceable to a loss of focus in the wake
of last Thursday's convincing victory over Ari
zona.
"ASU came out hard and we weren't con
centrating or giving our best effort," said
senior guard Christy Hedgpeth, who added 19
points to the Stanford cause. "We weren't tak
ing care of the ball."
VanDerveer agreed, citing her squad's supe
rior talent as a possible reason for its letdown.
"The players knew there was no way ASU
would beat us, but that we would help them,
and we helped them at the end of the first
half," VanDerveer said.
The Cardinal ceased its gen
erosity in the second stanza,
pulling out of the gate with a
Hedgpeth steal and layup and
capping a 29-11 period-opening
run with a seven-point scoring
streak by Hemmer.
The spurt pushed Stanford's
lead to 66-37 with 11 minutes
remaining.
Hedgpeth and Hemmer, in
fact, provided much of the offense
for the Cardinal in the last 20
minutes, netting 34 of the team's
48 second-half points as Stanford
never let its lead shrink below 18
down the stretch.
Two freshmen supported the
efforts of the leading scorers, as
forward Kate Starbird added 13
points and six rebounds while
guard Jamila Wideman scored
seven points and split her 10
assists evenly between the halves.
Sophomore guard Tiffany Kra
henbuhl led the Sun Devils with
18 points, but played tentatively
after committing her fourth foul
early in the second half. Sopho
more forwards Nikki Thompson
and Molly Tuter added 11 apiece,
while Tuter matched Hemmer
with 11 rebounds.
