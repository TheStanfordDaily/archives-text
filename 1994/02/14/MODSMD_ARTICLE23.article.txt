# Women's tennis wins two over top-25 teams
## Lineup changes due to injury can't stop Cardinal in identical 6-1 wins 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
There were a few surprises at the
Stanford Tennis Stadium this weekend.
But the end result was not one of
them, as the No. 2-ranked Stanford
women heat No. 23 University of Cali
fornia at San Diego 7-2 on Friday, then
returned a day later to sweep 20th
ranked San Diego State 9-0. The Cardi
nal boosted its record to 7-0 with this
pair of wins.
The first surprise was freshman
Sandra De Silva's win at No. 4 singles
Friday. The win itself was not that sur
prising, as De Silva is undefeated in sin
gles so far into this young season.
Rather, the manner in which the "W"
wa3 attained was different from usuals.
Kara Brady, her opponent from UCSD,
took an early 4-3 lead in the first set
with her looping, off-speed style of play.
But after this adjustment period, De
Silva won nine straight games to take
the match 6-4, 6-0.
De Silva attributed this dramatic
reversal to a strategy change.
"It was a little tough in the begin
ning because I was going for too much
and making errors," she said. "But in
the second set I decided to just keep the
ball in the court. . . being more patient
was the key."
Wendy Sacks' match at No. 6 singles
on Friday was also somewhat surpris
ing. The sophomore dominated the first
set over freshman Julie Baird and won
6-2. Turnabout was quick, though, as a
major lapse in concentration cost Sacks
the second set 6-0. The third set was
more competitive than the first two,
but Baird's momentum from her sec
ond-set shutout was too much for her
opponent to handle as Sacks fell, 6-4.
The key game of the match was the
first game of the second set, which

Baird was able to win, then build upon.
"If I had just capitalized on winning
the first set and won the first game of
the second set, it would have been
over," Sacks said.
Head coach Frank Brennan also
stressed the importance of this key

game.
"You come out fresh in the first
game of the second set," Brennan said.
"That one game makes a big statement.
. . . Certainly Wendy created a monster
there by letting this girl get rolling in
the second set."

Cardinal freshman Katie Schlukebir
didn't let anybody get rolling. Playing
in the No. 3 singles slot, the budding
star destroyed Kristine Smith 6-0, 6-1.
"I had a lot of confidence," Schluke-

bir said. "I was mentally prepared
for this match."
Friday's biggest surprise was in
doubles alignment. The Tritons
boast one of the top doubles teams
in the country in the seniors Julie
McKeon and Laura Richards. But
instead of pairing these two
against Stanford's top duo of
Poruri and Schlukebir, UCSD
head coach Sherri Stevens decided
to split her aces, pairing McKeon
with Evan Doyle at No. 1, leaving
Richards to play with Brady at No.
2.
"We're trying to strengthen the
total team doubles," Stevens said
of the switch. And, predictably, the
move weakened her top doubles

team, which was demolished by
Poruri/Schlukebir 6-0, 6-0, but bol
stered her No. 2 team, which upset
the Stanford team of Kristine
Kurth and Emily Burt 6-2, 6-3.
Kurth, a senior, and Burt, a
freshman, have had an up-and
down dual-match season so far,
and Friday's match reached a new
low. Although both played well
individually, the team aspect was
never present.
"They have to play as a team,"
Brennan said. "When they play
well as a team, they're one of the
best in the country ... as well as
you play individually, you can't
beat a good team."
From the opposing perspective,
coach Stevens said the key to her
team's win was their aggressive
volleying. "They took the net
away from Stanford," she said.
Friday's remaining matches

against UCSD (1-1) were anything
but surprising. In No. 1 singles,
Poruri continued to dominate,
clobbering McKeon 6-2, 6-2.
Kurth and Richards collided in
No. 2 singles and, unlike in dou
bles, Kurth prevailed 6-4, 6-1.
The senior Ail-American said
that it took some time to acclimate
to Richards' top-spin and slice
filled style that was much akin to
Brady's play at No. 5 singles.
Sporting a red "Craftsman" hat,
Beth Berris did a workmanlike job
at No. 4 singles against Doyle.
After being down 3-2, the sopho
more ground out a 6-4, 6-1 victory
to remain undefeated in dual
match play. In doubles she teamed
with senior Emma Woodhouse to
blow out Baird/Smith 6-2, 6-1.
On Saturday the only surprises
were several Cardinal lineup
changes. The flu bug struck the

Stanford team, as Sacks and Burt
were both too sick to compete
against the Aztecs (1-3). But
Emma Woodhouse had recovered
enough from her illness to play
both singles and doubles (which
she was unable to do Friday), so
the only lineup shuffling neces
sary was in doubles, where Berris
and Kurth formed the No, 2 team,
and Woodhouse and I)e Silva
played at No. 3. Woodhouse also
played No. 5 singles, but will
return to her No. 6 singles slot
when sophomore Kim Shasby
returns from an injury.
Albeit with a different partner,
Kurth was able to bounce back
from Friday's doubles loss to post
9 6-2, 6-1 win agafffSt Lisa Alipez
and Jennifer Nguyen. The "team"
element, so conspicuously missing
against UCSD, reappeared Satur
day.
