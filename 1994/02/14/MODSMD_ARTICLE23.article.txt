# Women's tennis wins two over top-25 teams
## Lineup changes due to injury can't stop Cardinal in identical 6-1 wins

There were a few surprises at the
Stanford Tennis Stadium this weekend.
But the end result was not one of
them, as the No. 2-ranked Stanford
women heat No. 23 University of Cali
fornia at San Diego 7-2 on Friday, then
returned a day later to sweep 20th
ranked San Diego State 9-0. The Cardi
nal boosted its record to 7-0 with this
pair of wins.
The first surprise was freshman
Sandra De Silva's win at No. 4 singles
Friday. The win itself was not that sur
prising, as De Silva is undefeated in sin
gles so far into this young season.
Rather, the manner in which the "W"
wa3 attained was different from usuals.
Kara Brady, her opponent from UCSD,
took an early 4-3 lead in the first set
with her looping, off-speed style of play.
But after this adjustment period, De
Silva won nine straight games to take
the match 6-4, 6-0.
De Silva attributed this dramatic
reversal to a strategy change.
"It was a little tough in the begin
ning because I was going for too much
and making errors," she said. "But in
the second set I decided to just keep the
ball in the court. . . being more patient
was the key."
Wendy Sacks' match at No. 6 singles
on Friday was also somewhat surpris
ing. The sophomore dominated the first
set over freshman Julie Baird and won
6-2. Turnabout was quick, though, as a
major lapse in concentration cost Sacks
the second set 6-0. The third set was
more competitive than the first two,
but Baird's momentum from her sec
ond-set shutout was too much for her
opponent to handle as Sacks fell, 6-4.
The key game of the match was the
first game of the second set, which

Baird was able to win, then build upon.
"If I had just capitalized on winning
the first set and won the first game of
the second set, it would have been
over," Sacks said.
Head coach Frank Brennan also
stressed the importance of this key

game.
"You come out fresh in the first
game of the second set," Brennan said.
"That one game makes a big statement.
. . . Certainly Wendy created a monster
there by letting this girl get rolling in
the second set."

Cardinal freshman Katie Schlukebir
didn't let anybody get rolling. Playing
in the No. 3 singles slot, the budding
star destroyed Kristine Smith 6-0, 6-1.
"I had a lot of confidence," Schluke-
