# Top-ranked men's gymnastics destroys BYU, UCSB

The message was loud and clear.
Stanford's two-time defending
national champion men's gymnastics
team reclaimed its familiar No. 1 rank
ing as it full-twisted and double-backed
all over Brigham Young and UC-Santa
Barbara in Maples Pavilion Friday.
The CCardinal scored 282.35 out of 300
total points, the highest tally recorded
in the nation that weekend. The for
mer Mountain-Pacific Sports Federa
tion-leading Cougars put up a valiant
struggle with 272.3 points, while the
Gauchos earned a mere 259.65 points.
"I didn't care whether we won or
not," said head coach Sadao Hamada.
"I said before our target was 282
points. We got that, and that score has

two meanings. One of our goals was to
test where we are. Now we know, if we
want to, we can score 282 points. Sec
ondly, 282 points has a psychological
effect on other teams. Other teams are
going to look at us and say, 'Wow'."
Future Stanford opponents might
also say "Wow" when they discover the
manner in which the Cardinal tri
umphed in its first dual meet of the
year. The defending champions fin
ished first in all six exercises.
Senior tri-captain Mark Booth led
the way on the pommel horse and par
allel bars, posting scores of 9.70 and
9.65 respectively. Junior tri-captain
Josh Stein and sophomore Andrew
Manson also put in a holler for the Car
dinal's veterans. Stein's 9.75-point out
ing on floor exercises gave him a share
of first-place honors in that event, and

Manson's 9.50 ring routine bested all
others.
"I'm feeling pretty confident,"
Booth said. "I was particularly pleased
with the pommel horse and parallel
bars. They're not yet at NCAA level,
but all that has to be done is to add dif
ficulty and refine the routines."
Typical of the season so far, Stan
ford's freshman gymnasts combined to
capture the remaining events. On the
high bar, Senior National Developmen
tal Team member Jamie Ellis outpaced
the field with a 9.75. With the same
score, lan Bachrach matched Stein on
floor exercises.
Finally, although Keith Wiley post
ed a 9.70 and 9.55 on floor exercises
and high bars respectively, it was his
lowest score of the day, 9.45, that gave
him a title on the vault.

"The freshmen are doing a great
job," Hamada said.
To top it all off, junior Jing-Wei
Liang captured the all-around crown,
scoring 56.5 points out of 60.
As for team performance, Hamada
was impressed by the squad's perfor
mance on the high bar and, in particu
lar, floor exercises.
"We scored 48.15 (out of 50) on floor
exercises," Hamada said. "That's by
far the best performance in that event
by six guys in a long time. And that's
without Mark Booth, who's usually
very strong in the event."
Booth expressed overall satisfaction
with Stanford's team progress.
"Everyone looked really good," he
said. "We're eliminating small errors
