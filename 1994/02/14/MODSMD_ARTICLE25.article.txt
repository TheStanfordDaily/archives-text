# Fun, fun, fun
## Women's swimming beats Cal 193-94 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
This weekend Stanford women
swimmers decided to take a break from
the heated competition. Ironically, they
achieved this goal while also creaming
the California Bears 193-94 in the Car
dinal's last dual meet of the season.
Swimming some of their off-events
and enjoying the relaxed meet environ
ment, Stanford swimmers moved to 6-0
in dual meet competition this year and
improved the nation's longest winning
streak to 44 straight dual meet wins
dating back to February 1988.
"We just wanted to take a break from
stressing about making cuts in our big
events," sophomore Lisa Jacob said.
"We wanted to have some fun with it."
Judging by the success the Cardinal
had in winning all but one of the 15
events, fun may not be the best word to
describe Stanford's performance. The
Cardinal even won both the one and
three-meter diving events, dominating
the Bears across the board.
"It was a good meet for us," Coach
Richard Quick said. "I told the team
that we would swim I relaxed 1 as long as
we kept winning."
The team followed orders nicely, not

only winning their events but placing
two Cardinal swimmers in the top two
finishers in all but two pool events.
Stanford even spread their wealth
around — no Cardinal won more than
one individual event, allowing for 11 dif
ferent Stanford athletes to capture indi
vidual victories.
"We had some really solid improve
ments this week," Becky Crowe said.
"We swam better than we did qgainst
(No. 2-ranked) Texas last week."
Several Cardinal swimmers almost
made the cut for the NCAA tourna
ment. Kerry O'Hanlon came close in the
200-yard backstroke, and both Jessica
Tong and Mary Ellen Blanchard almost
made qualifying times.
"A lot of our swimmers weren't com
peting in their best events, but they still
did very good in them," Quick said.
"These athletes are just very versatile."
The transition from the dual meet
season to the approaching Pacific 10
Conference Championships will demand
even more versatility from the team.
Many Cardinal swimmers have yet to
reach qualifying times in their desired
events, and the team is hoping for even
more improvement in the next month of
rigorous final preparations for NCAAs
March 17-19.

"We've got to get a lot better at the
Pac-10 Championships," Quick said.
For several Stanford athletes it was
their last competitive swim at deGuerre
pool. Mary Edwards finished out her
career as a Cardinal by winning the 100
free. In addition, Lea Loveless rounded
out her season at home by capturing
first place in the 1000 free, beating the
second place finisher by over 19 sec
onds.
"We were laid-back, it was sunny out
side, the pressure was off . . . that's the
story of the meet," Crowe said.
Other winners on the afternoon
included Jenny Thompson, who won the
200 individual medley by over 15 sec
onds. Tammy Shannon beat out fresh
man Sarah Anderson by 0.71 second in
the 200 free, while Anderson captured
her own victory in the 200 fly.
"I don't know if we were really
expecting to [qualify more swimmers to
NCAAsJ," Shannon said. "We're not
rested yet."
The team plans to rest and shave
just before the big tournament, contin
uing a tough training schedule until
that point. Stanford waits longer to cul
minate their training than most teams,
a strategy that has proved successful in
years past.
