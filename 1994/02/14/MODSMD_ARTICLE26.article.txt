# Men's tennis defeats Pepperdine and UNLV
## Top-ranked Ail-American Flanagan injures wrist in Saturday's doubles action, team wins all its matches against 'a pretty good team' 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Playing without its top singles and dou
bles player and facing one of the best teams
in the country, the Stanford men's tennis
team showed why it is considered among
the best of the best as it tamed the Pepper
dine Waves 6-1 Saturday. The day before
that, also playing without senior Ail-Amer
ican Michael Flanagan, Stanford left the
UNLV Running Rebels in the dust by a
score of 6-1.
"Overall, I'm very pleased with the way
the team played," said head coach Dick
Gould. "Especially after Mike went out."
In Friday's match against UNLV,
Flanagan took a spill in doubles action and
sprained his wrist. The injury took Flana
gan out of the singles lineup, moving every
one up one notch.
The Cardinal responded by winning
every match against what Gould termed "a
pretty good team." Especially impressive
was sophomore Ricky Becker, who filled in
at the No. 6 singles slot and won his match

against Marcus Ekstrand 1-6, 6-3, 6-2.
However, the injury bug was not fin
ished with Stanford on the day. During a
changeover in his No. 1 singles match,
senior Bobby Devens felt his back tighten
up. With his back plaguing him, Devens
went on to lose 3-6, 1-6, and would be fur
ther hampered on Saturday.
In its toughest match of the season,
Stanford set the tone quickly against Pep
perdine. Freshman Grant Elliott paired up
with Becker for No. 3 doubles. Even
though the pair had played together only
once before, they dominated the highly
regarded Pepperdine doubles team of
Chris Hill and Jake Bragonier 8-0.
"I think that No. 3 doubles getting off
the court so quickly really pepped everyone
up," Gould said.
Needing one of the two remaining dou
bles matches to get the important doubles
point, Stanford found itself matched
against two excellent teams. In Flanagan's
absence, senior Ail-American Chris Coco
tos paired up with Devens for No. 2 dou
bles action, but the duo dropped the match

to a tough tandem of Simon Aspelin and
Troy Budgen by a score of 8-5.
In what was undoubtedly the match of
the weekend, Stanford's usual second dou
bles team of All-American Vimal Patel and
sophomore Jeff Salzenstein faced the
nationally ranked preseason No. 1 team of
Ari Nathan and Cary Lothringer. Down a
break for much of the match, Patel-Salzen
stein broke back late and took the set to a
tie-break at 8-8. Although the two-some
faced match-point against at 5-6, they won
four of the next five points and got the win

and the doubles point.
"The key to the whole match against
Pepperdine was the play of Jeff and
Vimal," Gould said.
Ahead 1-0 going into singles, Stanford
was not out of the woods yet. Devens, still
hampered by his back, lost to pre-season
No. 12-ranked Charles Auffray.
However, Devens' would be the only
loss on the day for the Cardinal. Salzen
stein, continuing his excellent play,
breezed by Nathan 6-1,6-2 at No. 2 singles.
Cocotos, down a break 4-6, 6-3, 1-2, won

No. 3 singles by default. Patel rolled over
Aspelin at No. 4 by a score of 6-1, 6-2.
Thomas, showing no signs of the previous
ly injured shoulder, got a tough win
against Pepperdine's No. 5 player, Jacopo
Lo Monaco, by a score of 6-3, 1-6, 7-5.
Becker again rose to the occasion at No. 6,
winning 6-3, 6-4 against Hill.
However, with few exceptions the
matches were very close, and could have
swung the score away from the Cardinal.
"I was glad to get away with two wins
[on the weekend)," Gould said.
