Enough with the Broncos —
bring on the Cowboys.
Stanford continued its streak
of clutch hitting and solid pitch
ing this weekend and won two of
three games from the Santa
Clara Broncos. The No. 13 Car
dinal improved its record to 6-4
on the season and won its sec
ond-straight non-conference
series.
Stanford scored first in Fri
day's game at Santa Clara's
Buck Shaw Stadium, getting
three runs on six hits in the first
inning off Bronco righthander
John-Paul Rizzo (1-0). But from
there, Rizzo settled down and
allowed just three more hits, and
Santa Clara came up with.a big
four-run rally in the bottom of
the sixth inning to take a 5-3
lead.
The Cardinal put up another
run in the top of the seventh to
close to 5-4, but was unable to
get anything else going against
Bronco relievers John Spaulding
and Jim Lorge, who closed out
the game and picked up his sec
ond save of the season.
Stanford jumped ahead early
again on Saturday, at Sunken
Diamond, building a 10-0 lead
after four innings and getting
four runs in both the second and
third innings, chasing Santa
Clara pitcher Miles Kelly (1-1)
after only 1 2/3 innings.

Cardinal centerfielder Cale
Carter had two hits and three
RBI, including a two-run single
with the bases loaded, and senior
designated hitter Nate Olmstead
continued with his hot bat with
two hits and three RBI in three
at-bats.
"They really weren't trying to
pitch around me," Carter said.
"They kept coming inside with
the fastball and I was able to get
the big hit."
But the story of Saturday's
game was Cardinal southpaw
Dan Reed (2-1), who picked up
his second-straight win. The
sophomore pitched seven
innings and allowed no runs on
only five hits, while walking
three and striking out five.
In his past three starts, Reed
has Ditched 18 2/3 innings and
has allowed no runs on eight
hits, and has lowered his earned
run average to a 1.64, lowest
among Cardinal starters.
Stanford saved its best for
last on Sunday, when Cardinal
righthander Todd Bartels and
hardthrowing Bronco righthan
der Bobby Palithorpe squared
off at Buck Shaw Stadium.
Going into the contest, Stanford
coach Mark Marquess anticipat
ed a tough battle against
Palithorpe.
"IPalithorpe] is unusual in
college baseball today, in that
he's a real power pitcher, so we
expect to see an 88-90 mile-an
hour fastball and a good, hard

•slider," "H* will
be the best pitcher we've faced to
date."
The Santa Clara offense went
to work early for Palithorpe,
scoring two unearned runs in
the bottom of the first inning on
an error by Cardinal third base
man Brian Dallimore and a balk
by Stanford righthander Todd
Bartels.
Meanwhile, Palithorpe was
nearly untouchable early, and
would finish with seven strike
outs.
"In the beginning of the game
(Palithorpe] was throwing really
hard and was able to get the ball
by us," Carter said. "He was

" feally on top of his game."
But Bartels settled down, and
the Cardinal came back in the
late innings, scoring a run in the
top of the fifth inning and four
in the top of the sixth, a rally
culminated by right fielder Rich
Crowe's grand slam with one out
in the sixth.
"The bases were loaded with
only one ®ut, and my job really
was just to make sure I got the
ball in the air deep enough to
score a run," Crowe said. "I was
sitting on the fastball, because
he beat me with the a fastball
earlier, and I just got a hold of
it."
Crowe's monstrous slam off

Palithorpe (0-1) not only gave
the Cardinal a 5-2 lead, but gave
Bartels (3-0) his third consecu
tive win, with freshman Tom
Reimers pitching two perfect
innings and picking up his third
save.
Overall, Bartels went seven
innings and surrendered only six
hits and one earned run, while
walking none and striking out
four.
"Coming out of the first
inning, (BartelsJ gave up two
runs on plays we should have
made," Carter said. "But he
stayed tough and battled. He
was in complete command of his
