# Individual efforts marred by loss to strong BYU tumblers
## Women gymnasts beat UCSD, lose overall by less than a point 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
Though the Cardinal women
gymnasts received their highest
team score of the season and
defeated UC-Santa Barbara on
Friday, their 190.050 points
were not enough to win the
meet, as Brigham Young Uni
versity narrowly won with a
score of 190.925 in Maples
Pavilion.
"I am disappointed that we
lost," said Stanford's head
coach Breck Greenwood. "But
we added new things to our rou
tines and succeeded in executing
them. There were good emo
tions, and overall, it was a good
meet."
Junior Jene Elzie won the
meet with a 38.800 all-around
score, her highest this season.
Freshman Katie Jennings took
second place with a 38.350, and
third place went to BYU's
Cassie Pauga.
Because of a sore back, Jen
nings had not planned on com
peting on vault, therefore not
being in the all-around.
However, she was put in the
vault line-up at the last minute
when sophomore Linda Chun
pulled herself out of the event.
"Every week, it seems some
one comes through to vault that
wasn't planning on it," said
assistant Cardinal coach Robert

Shawler.
The Santa Barbara Gauchos
won the vault competition with
a score of 47.150. Stanford and
BYU tied for second with a score
of 47.050.
First place on the vault went
to BYU's Nanette Walker, and
Elzie tied with Santa Barbara's
April Sargent for second place.
Junior Meegan Lannin was not
far behind with a score of 9.650
and junior Tina Snowden broke
her season high with a score of
9.150.
Stanford gave its best
uneven-bar performance of the
season, receiving its highest
score of 48.075 and having no
falls. Still, BYU won this event
with a score of 48.275. First
place went to Stanford sopho
more Hillary Anderson, a usual
all-arounder who only competed
bars and beam due to a sore
knee. Her score of 9.800 beat
her previous season high, as did
Elzie's 9.725, which earned her
third place.
Chun overcame previous
trouble with her release move,
catching it to earn a 9.450, her
season high. Jennings and Lan
nin tied their own previous high
scores of 9.700 and 9.400,
respectively.
Senior Laurie West, who is in
the process of rehabilitating an
injured ankle, was new to the
bar line-up this week and

earned a score of 8.500.
The Cardinal team was less
solid on the beam this meet
than usual, earning a 46.925.
There were four falls and many
wobbles.
Yet Anderson performed a
strong, steady routine which
earned her first place and a sea
son-high score of 9.750. Due to
her injury, Anderson had not
even practiced beam all week
other than to do mental
imagery.
Anderson plans to be back in
the all-around next week. She
wants to add a double pike to
her floor routine and another
release move to her bar routine.
The Stanford team gave its
usual strong, charismatic per
formance on floor, receiving a
high score of 48.000. All three
places went to Cardinal gym
nasts, each beating their own
previous season high scores.
Elzie and Snowden tied for
first, sharing a score of 9.825,
and Jennings was not far behind
with a 9.800. Snowden, as well
as junior Jenny Ward, per
formed routines with new tum
bling passes.
According to Greenwood,
minor injuries on the team are
stopping the gymnasts from
training as hard as they would
like. The team took the weekend
off to get some rest and regain
its strength.
