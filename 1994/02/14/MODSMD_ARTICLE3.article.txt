# Giants' manager Baker reveals long road to top
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Editorial staff 
Despite his distinguished 15-
year baseball playing career and
status as the winningest rookie
manager in National League his
tory, Dusty Baker says he never
planned for much of a career on
the diamond.
"Most of my life has been filled
with things I didn't want to do,
but turned out for the best," said
Baker, the manager of the San
Francisco Giants, in a casual talk

at the Law School Friday. "I didn't
choose to play baseball, baseball
chose me."
Baker told the overflow crowd
at Law School Room 180 that if he
could do it over, he might have
chosen to hit the books rather
than the cowhide when he gradu
ated from high school in the late
19605.
"The only thing I regret, mid
way through my life ... is not
being on a major college campus,"
he said, adding that his "grades
weren't good enough" to gain
admittance into Stanford.
Now, he feels "intrigued and
honored every time I step on the
Stanford campus."
Baker's appearance was spon
sored by the Stanford Law Associ
ation and the Stanford Entertain
ment & Sports Law Society and
was hosted by Law Prof. William
Gould, President Clinton's nomi
nee to head the National Labor
Relations Board.
In introducing Baker, Gould
said his "most vivid memories are
seeing photographs in the Los
Angeles Times of Dusty going
back for a fly ball with his sun
glasses down," in reference to
Baker's career as an outfielder for
the L.A. Dodgers.
In a gentle, unassuming tone,
Baker touched on a variety of per
sonal subjects, including the
beginning of his professional

career in 1967, as a member of the
Atlanta Braves.
"That was a time of a tremen
dous amount of racial unrest, par
ticularly in the South," said
Baker, who is African-American.
"But I got a better awareness of
what the total country's attitude
was — there are good people all
over the country. There is actual
ly more education and opportuni
ty in the South than out here in
the West, and people are much
closer racially."
He also discussed his stint in
the Marines during the Vietnam
War, explaining that he entered
with reluctance but has come to
realize the value of service.
"If I have one tip, it's to be in
as many different walks of life as
possible, and find out what makes
people tick," he said. "The more
we get together as people, and
find out why we are as we are, the
better chance we have."
After the conclusion of his
career in the mid-'Bos, Baker said
he "didn't want anything to do
with baseball." But his fledgling
career as a stockbroker effectively

ended with the stock market
crash of 1987, forcing him to re
enter the game.
He said he was extended the
opportunity to coach the Giants
partly as a result of the com
ments of former Dodgers general
manager A 1 Campanis, who said
on "Nightline" that blacks did
not have the "necessities" to
serve in leadership positions in
sports.
"All of a sudden, there was a
big wave to get blacks into broad
casting and baseball, but it was
like a big riot — after the riot, you
sweep things under the rug and
don't think about it anymore," he
said.
After five years as a coach for
the Giants, Baker was named
manager last year, and exceeded
all expectations by leading San
Francisco to 103 wins, one shy of
the N.L. West title. Asked for his
strength as a manger, he said, "I
give orders better than I take
them."
Baker fielded several questions
from the audience after his
address, ranging from his views

on expansion and realignment to
NCAA regulations on student
athletes.
He said he objects to proposed
rules that would tighten academic
college entrance requirements for
scholarship athletes. "I think they
hurt minority groups more than
anybody," he said. "I just hope we
never limit the number of kids
who can go to school."
Meanwhile, he downplayed the
importance of skyrocketing player
salaries. "What astounds me is
that Barbra Streisand is paid $10
million a night to sing," he said.
"Everyone loses sight of the prob
lem — the problem isn't the play
ers, the problem is the fact that
owners can't control each other's
spending."
Gould, who has served as an
arbiter in hundreds of salary dis
putes between players and own
ers, closed the discussion by sug
gesting a closer relationship with
his guest.
"Now you see why," he said, "if
the Senate doesn't confirm me,
I'd love to be Dusty's bench
coach."

with reluctance but has come to
realize the value of service.
"If I have one tip, it's to be in
as many different walks of life as
possible, and find out what makes
people tick," he said. "The more
we get together as people, and
find out why we are as we are, the
better chance we have."
After the conclusion of his
career in the mid-'Bos, Baker said
he "didn't want anything to do
with baseball." But his fledgling
career as a stockbroker effectively

ended with the stock market
crash of 1987, forcing him to re
enter the game.
He said he was extended the
opportunity to coach the Giants
partly as a result of the com
ments of former Dodgers general
manager A 1 Campanis, who said
on "Nightline" that blacks did
not have the "necessities" to
serve in leadership positions in
sports.
"All of a sudden, there was a
big wave to get blacks into broad
casting and baseball, but it was
like a big riot — after the riot, you
sweep things under the rug and
don't think about it anymore," he
said.
After five years as a coach for
the Giants, Baker was named
manager last year, and exceeded
all expectations by leading San
Francisco to 103 wins, one shy of
the N.L. West title. Asked for his
strength as a manger, he said, "I
give orders better than I take
them."
Baker fielded several questions
from the audience after his
address, ranging from his views

on expansion and realignment to
NCAA regulations on student
athletes.
He said he objects to proposed
rules that would tighten academic
college entrance requirements for
scholarship athletes. "I think they
hurt minority groups more than
anybody," he said. "I just hope we
never limit the number of kids
who can go to school."
Meanwhile, he downplayed the
importance of skyrocketing player
salaries. "What astounds me is
that Barbra Streisand is paid $10
million a night to sing," he said.
"Everyone loses sight of the prob
lem — the problem isn't the play
ers, the problem is the fact that
owners can't control each other's
spending."
Gould, who has served as an
arbiter in hundreds of salary dis
putes between players and own
ers, closed the discussion by sug
gesting a closer relationship with
his guest.
"Now you see why," he said, "if
the Senate doesn't confirm me,
I'd love to be Dusty's bench
coach."
