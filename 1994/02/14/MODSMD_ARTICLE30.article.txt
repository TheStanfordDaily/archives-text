will be housed on the second floor.
• Social science reference materials, and government documents,
will be housed on the first floor of Green West, current location of
Jonsson Government Documents Library.
• A "grand corridor* will connect Green West to Green East. In
addition, a stairwell will be built, connecting the humanities and
social sciences centers in Green West.
• The door of Green West facing the Quad will be opened for
access to main library services.
• Current location of card catalogs near main entrance of library
will become an "information center" for reference services.
• Various rooms on the upper floors of the two wings of Green will
be seminar and reading rooms devoted to specific subjects.
• Ground and second floors of Meyer Library may be used as
expanded media centers, research and instructional functions,
