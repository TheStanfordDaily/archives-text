# Magazine delves into translation techniques
## 
### T.W. Mark Hung 
A new Stanford magazine fo
cused on the technique of transla
tion may not yet delve into the an
cient Egyptian language of hiero
glyphics. However, "two lines: the
Stanford Translation Annual" is
currently accepting works trans
lated from other less exotic —
though more practical — lan
guages.
Graduate student Antonia
Saxon, the founder of the maga
zine, noticed that Stanford has a
large multilingual community
which does translations in the

course of its own work. However,
until now there has been no com
prehensive outlet for such pieces.
After calling an organizational
meeting earlier this year, Saxon
said strong support was shown
from both students and faculty
for a magazine that would publish
works translated from any lan
guage.
While the magazine includes
translations of foreign works, the
editors also felt that "it would be
worthwhile to look at the activity
of translation for its own sake,"
