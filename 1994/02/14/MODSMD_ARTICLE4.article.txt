# Magazine delves into translation techniques
## 
### T.W. Mark Hung 
A new Stanford magazine fo
cused on the technique of transla
tion may not yet delve into the an
cient Egyptian language of hiero
glyphics. However, "two lines: the
Stanford Translation Annual" is
currently accepting works trans
lated from other less exotic —
though more practical — lan
guages.
Graduate student Antonia
Saxon, the founder of the maga
zine, noticed that Stanford has a
large multilingual community
which does translations in the

course of its own work. However,
until now there has been no com
prehensive outlet for such pieces.
After calling an organizational
meeting earlier this year, Saxon
said strong support was shown
from both students and faculty
for a magazine that would publish
works translated from any lan
guage.
While the magazine includes
translations of foreign works, the
editors also felt that "it would be
worthwhile to look at the activity
of translation for its own sake,"
said Saxon. "Therefore, we asked
people to submit not only their
translations, but short pieces
about the particular challenges
and problems their selections
presented."
Besides the more conventional
translations of literary works, the
magazine is also looking to
include such works as legal docu
ments, advertising, reportage and
oral histories. This distinguishes
it from translation magazines at
other universities, which usually
only include literary works.
"The theme for the first issue is
'Battlefields,' in both the literal
and metaphorical sense," said
Mark Francis, financial officer and
editor. Submissions from Stan
ford students and faculty include a
Russian piece set in a prison camp,
a Chinese work on a cat fight,
journalism from Bosnia and a one
act play by a Cuban writer.
Seed money and matching
funds for the annual were
obtained from the Institute for

International Studies, and contri
butions were also received from
several departments, including
English, History, French and
Italian, Comparative Literature
and the Center for East Asian
Studies (CEAS). In addition,
CEAS also provided for office and
computer facilities.
Aji editorial board composed of
six graduate students from vari
ous language departments over
sees the content of the magazine.
A still expanding six-member fac
ulty advisory board helps resolve
any difficulties with the transla
tions submitted by the contribu
tors, as well as other technical
problems, such as copyright
issues.
"Probably a dozen more people
could be on the [advisoryl board,
but because they don't know
about us, or we didn't know
about them, they're not working
with us," said Saxon. "We are
particularly interested in people
who specialize in African, Native
American and Latin American
indigenous languages."
Advertising through fliers, the
group has been successful in
soliciting a response from the

Stanford community. The cur
rent issue already has over 15
submissions. "We have been real
ly gratified by the response," said
Saxon. "We hove more submis
sions than we may be able to use,
and we are st;ll receiving
inquiries."
However, Saxon indicated that
it has been somewhat disappoint
ing that there has been only one
Spanish submission, given the
large Latino population on cam
pus. In addition, a faculty member
who teaches Latin American liter
ature turned down an invitation to
be on the faculty advisory board.
"The first issue is targeted for
the spring quarter, and it should
be around 100 pages," said Fran
cis. "It will be distributed
through bookstores and direct
mailings." Three hundred copies
are currently planned for the first
issue, said Saxon.
The magazine is also looking
for more submissions from
undergraduates and others in the
Stanford community, especially
in the areas of Sanskrit, Ameri
can Indian languages, Latin
American pieces and African lan
guages.
