# Plan to restructure library raises fears about decreased use
## Changes may be 'forbidding' to undergrads 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
A group of professors has raised
questions recently about a plan in the
works to separate Green Library's
general reference resources into two
parts and move them into the current
ly closed Green West building.
"The plans to change and restruc
ture the architecture are going to cost
money," said History Prof. Barton
Bernstein. "When the University is in
a time of expensive budget cutting,
should they be taking a system that
works well and deplete the personnel
and divide the collection?"
Professors also worry that the ma
jority of undergraduates would not use
the new system, which would split the
library between a humanities and spe
cial collections center and a social sci

ences resources center.
"It could be formidable and forbid
ding, while the current reference sys
tem is so user-friendly," History Prof.
Kennell Jackson said.
The-, project, which was originally
designed during the University's first
round of budget cuts three years ago,
should be completed in the fall of 1997,
said Karen Nagy, the director for acad
emic information services for the li
braries.
It will cost $30-40 million to repair
damage to Green West caused by the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, while
the costs for the new reference rooms
and a "grand corridor" connecting
Green East and West are still undeter
mined.
The Board of Trustees has already
approved $37 million for the pro
ject, money that will come from
Federal Emergency Management
Agency funds — currently at
about $15 million — and from
fund raising.
"Of course there will be some
activation costs," Nagy said, "but
we tend to absorb these things as
business as usual." Whatever is
done will have to be done within
the budget approved by the board,
she said.
Academic concerns
Faculty members have voiced
concerns ranging from budget
questions to the perception that
the proposed division is artificial
and will confuse and intimidate
undergraduates.
In a letter printed last month in
Campus Report, a group of history
professors said the reorganization
could "destroy the unity between
the collection and its attending
staff as well as damage some of
the interdisciplinary studies that
cannot be easily divided into

humanities or social sciences.
Some of that concern has
diminished after a meeting two
weeks ago between some faculty
members and University Library
Director Michael Keller, in which
Keller explained the reasoning
behind the reorganization.
Two professors who attended
the meeting — Jackson and
English Prof. Ron Rebholz —
praised Keller, who will be meet
ing with the History Department
this week, for being responsive.
"It looks to me like they are
taking in my concerns," Rebholz
said. "I don't think the plan is
intolerable."
Many of those questions, how
ever, still remain. "They believe
that by consolidating reference
and curation, they will get more
out of the expertise in their staff,"
said History Prof. Nancy Koll
mann, a former member of the
Faculty Senate's Committee on
Libraries. "Our concern is . . . will
patrons still be served so well by
dividing reference? Because uni
fied, it is working perfectly well."
As well as spreading the refer
ence staff thin, the split could also
damage disciplines such as
African-American Studies, which

are neither purely social science
nor humanities, Bernstein said.
"How do you draw the line?"
he said. "People will be scurrying
back and forth uselessly (between
the two centers)."
Jackson compared the new ref
erence rooms to the library's rare
books collection. "It was a funere
al place — large, quiet, posh —
and nobody went to it,"he said.
The two new rooms will probably
have "a little more jumping and
jive," he added, but may also end
up unused.
Rebholz was also concerned
about the availability of the cura
tors and whether they might be
intimidating to undergraduates.
But Keller said there are no
plans to limit the curators to be
available from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
weekdays by appointment only,
contrary to some of the rumors
that faculty have heard. "The
curators will be generally avail
able and make their own sched
ules," he said.
William McPheron, curator
for English and American litera
ture, said he does not think the
new system will be much different
from the current system. The
planners just have to make sure
the curators are visible and acces
sible, he said.
"There's a big advantage in
that there will be much more and
much better space for study and
research," McPheron said.
"Green West was a non-public
space anyway. They're taking
prime space and opening it up."
'An ornate process'
Faculty and library adminis
trators agree that if the plan is to
work, the Stanford community
needs to be informed of the
changes and taught how to use
the new system.
Bernstein said he first heard of
the plan early in winter quarter,
despite the fact that it has been in
the works for at least three years.
The academic departments were
never systematically informed, he
said.
Kollmann said library adminis
trators seem to understand that
"the positive benefits (of the plan)

have to be understood in-house
and on campus."
"It's a rethinking of how
users use the library," she said.
"They have got to do a lot to draw
undergraduates into this pro
gram. . . . They need a mqjor edu
cation and public relations
effort."
Nagy agreed, saying "We need
to explain what's going on and
have another round of education
and discussion. We will be doing
some more publicity."
There was no attempt to hide
the plan over the past three years,
she said.
"We did quite a lot of consulta
tion and presented the plan to the
Faculty Senate and to the Univer
sity Cabinet. ... It was quite an
ornate process," she said.
Librarians at other schools —
particularly at Princeton and
Columbia, which both have sepa
rate humanities and social science
reference centers — were also
consulted, Nagy said.
The library directors will con
tinue to consult faculty and staff
for the details of the project, she
added. "We're not doing anything
with any finality."
Doing more with less
The plan to re-arrange Green's
reference materials was largely
influenced by budget constraints.
When the libraries were facing
budget reductions of about 10
percent to 15 percent in 1990, the
senate's committee on libraries
asked for recommendations on
ways to "preserve Stanford's
greatness in libraries," Keller
said.
Then there were the Universi
ty's $43 million cuts of 1991,
which overall meant the libraries
had to operate on a staff reduced
by about 25 percent. Because of
this, administrators began to look
for a new and different way to
operate the libraries.
While the current general ref
erence desk is doing an admirable
job assisting students, there are
still many ways to improve, Keller
said. "We want to allow the refer
ence collection to grow and do
that with less."

The two rooms will mean
"more space for more reference
materials and source material,
and that collection can grow and
change and expand and contract,"
he said.
The information center would
be placed on the first floor —
where the card catalog presently is
— to act as a "switch," Keller said.
"Three quarters of the questions
asked at the reference desk are
directional questions," he said,
which the new information center
could easily address. More compli
cated questions would be referred

to either of the two centers.
Also in the works is a proposal
to move reserves from Meyer back
into Green so that Meyer can be
turned into a complete media cen
ter.
Keller also wants to better con
nect the two sides of Green by
building a "grand corridor" that
would go through the second
floors of Green West and Green
East. He did not have an estimate
of its cost.
"[Green] would be one building
instead of two buildings joined at
the hip," he said.
