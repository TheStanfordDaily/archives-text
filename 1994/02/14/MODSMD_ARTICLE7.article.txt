# Mid-quarter reports due in CUE meeting
## Education group to discuss progress today 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
The Commission on Undergraduate
Education will undergo an education
of sorts itself this afternoon, as the
seven information-gathering subcom
mittees report their progress at the
commission's first meeting since early
January.
History Prof. James Sheehan, who
in addition to chairing the commission
serves as a chair for the subcommittee
on distribution requirements, will re
port to the group how his subcommit
tee plans to garner student input.
The group will convene several
focus groups of about eight to 10 stu
dents who talk to subcommittee mem
bers about their experiences with the
requirements.
"In terms of information, I can't
think of anything more important"
than student experiences, said Shee
han. Students help the committee de
termine "if these requirements are in

fact doing what they're supposed to,"
he said.
Sheehan added that he hoped a
phone poll — which will be conducted
by the Council of Presidents this quar
ter — would help to gather students'
thoughts.
Vice Provost for Institutional Plan
ning Geoffrey Cox's subcommittee,
which focuses on the academic calen
dar, has been looking mostly at data
such as enrollment figures. Cox said
the data are helpful because they show
things like how many students take
enough classes to graduate in three
years and what kinds of students cur
rently opt to take classes during sum
mer quarter.
As part of its area, Cox's subcom
mittee is considering ways to get stu
dents to find the summer quarter "a
more interesting option," he said.
Subcommittees consisting of com
mission members and students were
formed at the beginning of this
quarter to study particular areas
of interest more specifically. They
are expected to issue final reports
to the commission at the end of
the quarter.
Some subcommittees are fur
ther along than others. Senior
Shayne Spalten, a member of the
subcommittee studying majors,
said her subcommittee had
already talked to the chairs of
several departments and the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
as well as meeting with student
focus groups, and hopes to send a
questionnaire to alumni later this
quarter.
Spalten said she was

impressed by how devoted com
mittee members were. "People in
the process are really interested
in coming up with solutions and
not just going through the
motions," she said.
Spalten said her subcommittee
hoped to "create some kind of def
inition of what's a good m^jor."
Junior Luz Herrera, the only
undergraduate member of the
commission, said progress in her
subcommittee studying breadth
requirements was "still slow."
Herrera was hopeful that the
distribution requirements would
eventually be reduced, however,
saying, "We're definitely not
increasing DRs."
Ideas the subcommittee is
looking at include grouping dis
tribution requirements into four
general areas, although exactly
how such a grouping would fit

with current requirements is still
unclear, Herrera said. "I think
anything's going to be better
than what we have now," she
added.
The commission was formed
last spring by University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper to review all
aspects of undergraduate educa
tion at Stanford. The group
began meeting in October.
There are a total of seven sub
committees studying various
areas of an undergraduate educa
tion: academic calendar, academ
ic environment, teaching tech
nique and use of technology, writ
ing, language, breadth and major
requirements.
There is also a working group
"trying to get new ideas and make
sure we aren't missing any
thing," as Sheehan put it, that
will report at today's meeting.
