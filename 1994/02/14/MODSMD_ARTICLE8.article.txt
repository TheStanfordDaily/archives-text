## Student group re-enacts shelling of 68, urges action 
### Vanessa Hua 
Hoping to increase campus awareness and
to send a message to the U.S. government,
Students Against Genocide (SAGE) drama
tized last week's shelling of a Sarajevo mar
ket with a staged massacre in White Plaza
Friday.
A group of approximately 50 students —
consisting of SAGE members and interested
onlookers — re-enacted the deaths of the 68
civilians killed in the shelling by fallingon top
of each other when each victim's name was
read.
The protest attracted coverage from sev
eral local television and newspaper reporters,
but most students in White Plaza seemed
more interested in a fund-raising event by
the Stanford crew team. In total, about 10-15
students watched the demonstration.
Stanford's SAGE chapter is the first es
tablished student "wing" of a national um
brella organization protesting the actions of
Bosnian Serbs in the two-year war in Bosnia-
Herzegovina. Twenty other branches of
SAGE have formed on other college campus
es, according to Brad Blitz, the Stanford
group's head and an international education
graduate student.
The group was originally formed last
spring as a division of the California Coali
tion Against Ethnic Cleansing, but has since
become independent from the coalition.
"Ethnic cleansing is genocide by any other
name. Right now is one of those rare, defin
ing moments to show who we are as a people
and as a nation," Blitz said on Friday. "We

must pressure President Clinton. The Bosni
ans have a right to defend themselves, to use
force if necessary to stop the genocide."
He added that American citizens should
pressure Congress to ignore the United Na
tions' arms embargo against Bosnia and send
weapons to the Bosnian army.
Organizers encouraged passers-by to join
the group, playing a Shafron, a Jewish holy
instrument, and handing them protest signs.

Student leader Sheri Fink shouted into the
megaphone, "Are you ready to die? This is
what it means to die, when civilians are tar
geted.
"Let's not be witnesses anymore," she
said. At that point, the name of each of the
massacre's victims was read, and students
representing the names pretended to die. The

students remained on the ground
for about three minutes, chant
ing "Save Sarajevo, lift the
embargo."
After the re-enactment, the
group lit a torch commemorating
the I Oth anniversary of the Winter
Olympics in Sarajevo. Blitz point
ed out the contrast between the
city in 1984 and its current state.
Participants expressed some
surprise at the relatively small
turnout for the event, which last
ed about 30 minutes.
"Where are all the students?"
asked Joe Higgins, a spectator at
the protest. "[Stanford students]
need to connect with what people
care about."

Junior Shelley Shick Valdes,
who participated in the protes ,
said, "I can't believe that people
are just standing there and li"
tening to music when we are tr >
ing to help people dying.
"They aren't giving any sup
port. It's outrageous," she said.
Blitz said the situation in
Bosnia warranted more atten
tion. "The people who died had
names and histories. It's now
more important than ever to
show support. [Thursday], they
shelled another marketplace in
Sarajevo."
To increase awareness, SAG?,
plans to follow on the protest by
hosting "BosniAid" tomorrow in
Memorial Auditorium. Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist Roy
Guman and former State Depart
ment official Stephen Walker are
slated to speak.
