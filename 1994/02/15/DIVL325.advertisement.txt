Harry Wu
Bitter Winds
A Memoir of My Years in China's Gulag
(Published by John Wiley and Sons, Ltd., $22.95)
Harry Wu was born in Shanghai in 1937. The son of a wealthy banker,
he was sent to an elite Jesuit boys' school before attending the Beijing
Geology Institute as an undergraduate. On April 27, 1960, he was
arrested by Chinese authorities and, without ever being formally
charged or tried, spent the next nineteen years in hellish prison labor
camps. He accepted an offer to be a visiting scholar at the University
of California, Berkeley in 1985 and resettled in the United States. He
has lectured internationally about his experiences in prison, has testified
before the United States Congress, and was awarded the Freedom
\ Award by the Hungarian Freedom Fighters' Federation in 1991. He has
been featured in stories by Newsweek and "60 Minutes," and is the sub
j ject of a British ITV documentary about the Chinese prison system.
Bitter Winds is an invaluable personal record of persistent, barbaric
abuses of human freedom in our time. An inspiring, gripping story of
one man's indomitable will to live, it is a testimony to the extraordinary
courage of the human spirit.
Harry Wu also wrote Laogai: The Chinese Gulag.
He is currently a resident scholar at the Hoover Institution.
