# Welfare crisis drains treasuries
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — One in seven
children is on welfare, more than one in 10
Americans buys groceries with food
stamps and the number of births to unwed
mothers is climbing toward one in three.
That's a crisis to President Clinton,
who argues that the nation's welfare
system must be revolutionized. Conser
vatives agree, but many liberals ques
tion the need for drastic action, espe
cially if the administration pays for
reform by wringing savings from other
programs for low-income families.
One thing is certain: Caseloads are
mushrooming and costs are soaring,
draining federal and state treasuries.
Conservatives also see a crisis of ille
gitimacy and dependency. They say wel
fare is "illegitimacy's economic life-sup
port system" and responsible for a per
manent class of broken families.

"The welfare system is in a crisis... .
. Millions of families are trapped in wel
fare programs that rob them of their
dignity and deny them opportunity,"
said Rep. Rick Santorum of Pennsylva
nia, the senior Republican on the House
Ways and Means Subcommittee on
Human Resources.
"The system sanctions and even
encourages children to have children.
We need to fix America's welfare system
and we need to do it now," he said.
Clinton has said he'll introduce legis
lation this spring to do just that. Under
his plan, single parents on welfare
would get the education, training and
child-care they need to find work and
then leave the rolls within 24 months.
In the short term, however, it is
cheaper to just keep writing welfare
checks than setting up training, work

and day-care programs for single moth
ers, many of them high-school dropouts
with little work experience.
Widespread child-care shortages and
quality problems also could complicate
reform, according to Rep. Ron Wyden,
D-Ore. the chairman of the House Small
Business subcommittee on regulation.
Last week, Wyden said welfare
reform could strain a child-care system
that already is overburdened and
underfinanced.
"The current welfare system is the
most pernicious government program
of the last quarter-century. . . . We have
lost large parts of an entire generation
because of the terrible human wreckage
left in its wake," William Bennett and
Peter Wehner of Empower America, a
conservative advocacy organization,
wrote recently.
