## Editorial Eliminate the COP? 
### 
ASSU Senate should let
students decide if four
presidents are too many

WHAT EFFECT DOES a
council of four presidents
instead of a single presi
dent have on the ASSU? Account
ability to students is lower and
the potential for passing the buck
is higher, for starters.
The experiment that began in
1969 of having four chief execu
tives lead the ASSU is a mistake
and should be abandoned. The
change was intended to divide the
various responsibilities of the
presidency and create "a stronger
Executive Office." Judging by the
election of "I Prefer Not to Have
a COP" and the lack of student
confidence in the COP's leverage
in dealing with important issues,
the four-member system has
failed.
It's true that no one individual
can run every aspect of the
ASSU's myriad business projects,
advocate student needs to the
University and provide legislative
leadership to the senate. But
effective leaders should know
how to delegate, and the presi
dent should be judged by his or
her choice of appointments to
various jobs.
Having a council also makes
the leadership of the student gov
ernment relatively anonymous.
How many students could point
out the current members of the
COP in a panel discussion? Even
during their campaign, COP
slates identify themselves by a

common name, like "I Prefer Not
to Have a COP," rather than by
the names of the candidates.
The bureaucratic image of a
"council of presidents" also
makes concerned students wary
of getting the run-around. Stu
dents are more likely to seek out a
president — another student like
themselves — rather than try to
deal with the organizational quag
mire of four equal co-executives.
Senate Chair Greg Waldorf has
authored a constitutional amend
ment that would return the exec
utive branch to one president and
one vice president. Electing a sin
gle president would make the
organization more accountable to
the needs of students because the
leadership would be focused on a
single person. For example, the
president would be the contact
person for students and adminis
trators alike, reducing confusion
about who deals with what issues.
The senate should vote tonight
to place the Waldorf amendment
on the ballot. Students would be
able to approve the measure in a
special election before the general
election during spring quarter.
Students themselves should call
their senators before tonight's meet
ing and let them know that they
support a return to a responsive sys
tem of student government. The
senate also has an e-mail address —
senate@deathstar — which for
wards messages to all senators.
Making it easier for students to
identify their leaders and make
criticisms of their actions will
inevitably increase the ASSU's
accountability.
And if there were only one per
son in charge, it would be awfully
rare to hear, "Sorry, that's anoth
er president's job."
