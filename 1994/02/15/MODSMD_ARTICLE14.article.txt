## The
						mid-quarter frenzy 
### 
IT'S MIDTERM season on the Farm.
But then again, when isn't it? Think
of all the many reasons you love Stan
ford — the view of the Quad driving up
Palm drive on a sunny day, studying at
the pool in February, chillin' at the Co Ho
with friends and pitchers of Weinhard's.
Then think of the phenomenon that
ensures that you go months at a time
without enjoying these — those months
when midterms wreak havoc with our
lives and leave us contemplating life from
that giant Taco Bell called Meyer.
Fuzzies have it pretty good when it
comes to this terrible affliction. You're
told to read a few thousand books and
condense them to a few pages in a period
of 50 minutes. No quotes, no page refer
ences, zip, nada. Cake, really.
I mean, think of how much you have
to work with — the largest chunk of
studying time comes in deliberating
whether the Cliff's or the Monarch
Notes will do you right. Papers are a lit
tle harder to maneuver. But hey, you're
never told to bring in all the material
you were supposed to have covered over
the quarter — selective reading is key.
Looking through notes is always a good
call, assuming you've made it to class.
But hey, what else are ASSU Lecture
Notes takers for? Going to class is their
job, not yours. Before you know it, it's
all a distant blur, and you even get a
week's respite between midterms and
finals. What would you do without

Dead Week?
And we wonder why they call us
fuzzies ....
Techies, on the other hand, don't get
off so easily. Your midterms start the sec
ond week of the quarter and run until
finals. You're tested on whole textbooks
in excruciating detail. But hey, at least
those weekly problem sets keep you on
top of things. And you go to classes even
less than the fuzzies do, since most profs
basically repeat the textbook.
Of course, this means that you don't
really have to do any reading either, pro
vided you make it to class — a tough
trade-off. Unless, of course, you bag them
both in favor of watching them on tape in
Terman. Let's see, that means you could
cover a class meeting three times a week
for 50 minutes over 10 weeks ... all in 25
hours! How sweet!
All in all, it evens out. But this is com
ing from an ex-techie, so maybe it's just
becoming increasingly easier to delude
myself as the pain of 16-hour problem
sets recedes farther into oblivion.
During midterms, your friends
become disembodied voices on your
machine and typewritten notes over e
mail. Thank God for the miracle of mod
ern technology. You decide to call your
friends, forgetting that they, too, are
operating under the same siege mentality
you are. No one is home.
You call your machine and find mes
sages from the people you just tried to

reach. If you 're lucky they'll let you know
where you can find them — but if you're
like me, you never let them know where
you are, and change locales every few
hours in fear that someone will somehow
ferret you out. Desperate for any human
interaction you can find, you head to the
computer lab ... 42 new messages!
But wait a minute, you think — this is
so wrong. Is this what you came to Stan
ford for — bonding with that voice over
the Green Library intercom, living on
black coffee and cigarettes, spending
more time on the network than with your
draw group?
Subvert the dominant paradigm. Cast
off those technological shackles that
have subjugated you in the past. Peel
away that study machine exterior and
toss it aside for a couple of hours ... or
weeks, for that matter. Ask someone on
a date. Expose your true colors by hang
ing out with your buddies. Expose a lot
more by streaking naked through the
Quad.
Is anybody out there?
Darn, I knew I should have sent it out
over e-mail instead.
