## Director says study of Raimondi technique is rigorous 
### 
I WISH to reply to Walter Mann's
Feb. 8 letter concerning my
research study on Raimondi tech
nique. I am slightly offended that
Mann assumes that physicists are more
ignorant of correct research design
than are electrical engineers. He
should also be less quick to assume
that the information presented in a
newspaper article is complete. In fact,
the study under question follows a true
double blind protocol. The test instru
ment is a headache log of the sort typi
cally used in clinical trials of the effec
tiveness of pharmaceuticals on
migraines, as published in journals
such as Headache and Cephalagia.
Subjects rate the intensity of their
headaches on a 10-centimeter visual

analog scale, record the duration of the
headache in hours, the level of nausea,
dizziness, and photophobia on a scale
of zero to three where zero is none, one
is mild, two is moderate, and three is
severe. The record is kept for at least
two weeks before and after the experi
mental session. The completed log
forms will be entered into a computer
by an assistant who is blind to the sub
jects' treatment condition. Because of
the random assignment and double
blind design, any effects due to expec
tations will be identical for the treat
ment and control groups.
Mann may have been misled by the
quotes from the subject, which were
dramatic but unfortunately resulted in
some confusion. The subject had previ

ously reported a large reduction in
headache frequency after a Raimondi
treatment. However, when she spoke to
the reporter, she focused only on the
effects of the treatment in alleviating
her headache in progress. The study is
examining only prevention of
headaches, not effects on a headache in
progress. The fact that she reported an
improvement from a prior treatment
(not subsequent as stated in the story)
and no improvement from the control
is suggestive but has no relevance to
the data being collected for the study.
The original article did not make it
clear that I made no claims concerning
the effectiveness of Raimondi tech
nique for any particular conditions,
merely stated that there were many

anecdotal reports of benefits. (These do
include objectively measurable things,
such as reaction time.) I completely
agree with Mann that anecdotal
reports and case studies are not rigor
ous enough to completely rule out
placebo effects and selection bias. That
is the whole point of doing the present,
more tightly controlled study.
I wish to clarify that Raimondi tech
nique is never suggested as a substi
tute for conventional medical treat
ment. It is not specific for any particu
lar medical condition, but appears to
have a general tonic effect. It is recom
mended in an adjunctive role only.
