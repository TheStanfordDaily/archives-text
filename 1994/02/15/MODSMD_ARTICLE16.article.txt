## Sleepless at Stanford: a president's nightmare 
### 
The scene opens in a tastefully decorated
master bedroom at two a.m. on a Tuesday
morning. The president of Stanford, a
prestigious northern California university,
wakes up from a troubled rest.
I HATE THIS insomnia. (He picks up a
fancy leather-bound diary and begins to
write, speaking his scribblings as he
writes.)
Dear Leland:
Why did I ever encourage my students
to think critically about the world around
them? I meant the comment in a purely
intellectual sense. But now, they have
turned their stratospheric GPAs and SAT
scores on my job.
(To the audience.) Those ingrates.
Don't they appreciate what I've done for
them? I dragged this institution's image
out of the gutter and began the process of
restoring it to its former glory. I've started
to refocus Stanford on its academic mis
sion. This is what the Board of Trustees
hired me to do. But so far, this community
doesn't appreciates the work that I've
done. (Puts his head in his hands. After a

brief pause, he gets up and begins to pace
bcu k and forth.)
Admittedly, I have been guilty of saying
one thing and doing another. I did say that
the ethnic centers were underfunded —
then propose that their budgets be cut fur
ther. But there are only four sources of
University income — (The audience boos.)
I'm sorry, I don't mean to sound like a bro
ken record.
But students have to understand that
their playing at politics makes my job very
difficult. Believe me, I know that divest
ment from South Africa, the abuse of
migrant workers on Stanford land own
land and reforming the traditional curricu
lum are very important. (Looks out at audi
ence.) Message is: I care.
But I get hundreds of letters from con
servative alumni who say, "If I see one
more story about [ethnic studies programs,
queer be-ins, Take Back the Night march
es] on the cover of The Daily, you can for
get about my check." So if the net effect of
my restructuring efforts is to depoliticize
the student body, they should understand
that it's business, never personal.

(The president walks back to his desk
and opens a drawer to take out a newspa
per. He looks at the front page, then turns to
page five. As he reads, his expression
changes from one of self-satisfaction to
pained angst.)
Which brings mo to another source of
my discontent — The Daily. Why do they
have to report on the resident fellow revolt
over Residential Education, the political
agenda behind my purging of the
Office, etc.? Why don't they just follow the
lead of Campus Report and portray the
campus positively? (As he delivers this last
line, he pulls on a grotesque monster mask,
then walks stage right — hands behind his
back — as though someone Ls leading him
away in handcuffs.)
(Snarls angrily.) And I would have got
ten away with it too, if it wasn't for those
darned kids. (Pulls off his mask and sits at
the edge of stage, tired. JAch, my blood pres
sure — I'm a little veklempt.
Only positive thoughts, only positive
thoughts.
Well, appointing a woman who says that
she's "been black all [her) life," as provost

was a masterstroke. And she's got the best
sidekicks possible — a pair of lame duck
Deans for student affairs who pretend to
advocate on behalf of students, but really
soften them up for the cuts I'm planning to
make. I mean, does the Students of Color
Coalition realize how silly it looks arguing
about ethnicity with threvj black adminis
trators?
Genius — if I do say so myself.
The larger student response has been
even better than I'd hoped for. Winds of
Freedom distracted people from what I
was doing, making campus liberals think
that Winds was the real enemy. I'll admit,
Students for an Informed Community had
me scared for a brief moment. But when
the Democrats in the group broke away to
focus on Winds — taking the heat off of me
once again — I breathed easily once more.
The Democrats couldn't have played their
petty political games at a better time.
(Chomps a cigar.) I love it when a plan
comes together. (Thepresident is now com
pletely underlit, looking like something
from"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.")
And most of the students, staff and

Before drifting off, the president wonders,
"Who was that masked man that waved
and said hello to me and my provost last
Wednesday evening in the Quad?" His
restless nights occur on Tuesdays.


faculty are too apathetic to openly
protest what I'm doing. It's no secret
that I've alienated many of them from
the University by not letting them par
ticipate in decision-making processes,
keeping budget information secret, and
being unresponsive to their concerns.
But who cares? (Points at the audience.)
If people don't have the courage to
express their dissatisfaction with my
tenure, then it really doesn't matter
what they think.
(The laughter of a thousand villains can
be heard in the background over the sounds
of thunder. Lightning flashes, howling
winds blow across the stage and wolves bay
at the moon. This cacophonous symphony
lulls the president back to sleep.)

The scene opens in a tastefully decorated
master bedroom at two a.m. on a Tuesday
morning. The president of Stanford, a
prestigious northern California university,
wakes up from a troubled rest.
I HATE THIS insomnia. (He picks up a
fancy leather-bound diary and begins to
write, speaking his scribblings as he
writes.)
Dear Leland:
Why did I ever encourage my students
to think critically about the world around
them? I meant the comment in a purely
intellectual sense. But now, they have
turned their stratospheric GPAs and SAT
scores on my job.
(To the audience.) Those ingrates.
Don't they appreciate what I've done for
them? I dragged this institution's image
out of the gutter and began the process of
restoring it to its former glory. I've started
to refocus Stanford on its academic mis
sion. This is what the Board of Trustees
hired me to do. But so far, this community
doesn't appreciates the work that I've
done. (Puts his head in his hands. After a

brief pause, he gets up and begins to pace
bcu k and forth.)
Admittedly, I have been guilty of saying
one thing and doing another. I did say that
the ethnic centers were underfunded —
then propose that their budgets be cut fur
ther. But there are only four sources of
University income — (The audience boos.)
I'm sorry, I don't mean to sound like a bro
ken record.
But students have to understand that
their playing at politics makes my job very
difficult. Believe me, I know that divest
ment from South Africa, the abuse of
migrant workers on Stanford land own
land and reforming the traditional curricu
lum are very important. (Looks out at audi
ence.) Message is: I care.
But I get hundreds of letters from con
servative alumni who say, "If I see one
more story about [ethnic studies programs,
queer be-ins, Take Back the Night march
es] on the cover of The Daily, you can for
get about my check." So if the net effect of
my restructuring efforts is to depoliticize
the student body, they should understand
that it's business, never personal.

(The president walks back to his desk
and opens a drawer to take out a newspa
per. He looks at the front page, then turns to
page five. As he reads, his expression
changes from one of self-satisfaction to
pained angst.)
Which brings mo to another source of
my discontent — The Daily. Why do they
have to report on the resident fellow revolt
over Residential Education, the political
agenda behind my purging of the
Office, etc.? Why don't they just follow the
lead of Campus Report and portray the
campus positively? (As he delivers this last
line, he pulls on a grotesque monster mask,
then walks stage right — hands behind his
back — as though someone Ls leading him
away in handcuffs.)
(Snarls angrily.) And I would have got
ten away with it too, if it wasn't for those
darned kids. (Pulls off his mask and sits at
the edge of stage, tired. JAch, my blood pres
sure — I'm a little veklempt.
Only positive thoughts, only positive
thoughts.
Well, appointing a woman who says that
she's "been black all [her) life," as provost

was a masterstroke. And she's got the best
sidekicks possible — a pair of lame duck
Deans for student affairs who pretend to
advocate on behalf of students, but really
soften them up for the cuts I'm planning to
make. I mean, does the Students of Color
Coalition realize how silly it looks arguing
about ethnicity with threvj black adminis
trators?
Genius — if I do say so myself.
The larger student response has been
even better than I'd hoped for. Winds of
Freedom distracted people from what I
was doing, making campus liberals think
that Winds was the real enemy. I'll admit,
Students for an Informed Community had
me scared for a brief moment. But when
the Democrats in the group broke away to
focus on Winds — taking the heat off of me
once again — I breathed easily once more.
The Democrats couldn't have played their
petty political games at a better time.
(Chomps a cigar.) I love it when a plan
comes together. (Thepresident is now com
pletely underlit, looking like something
from"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.")
And most of the students, staff and

Before drifting off, the president wonders,
"Who was that masked man that waved
and said hello to me and my provost last
Wednesday evening in the Quad?" His
restless nights occur on Tuesdays.


faculty are too apathetic to openly
protest what I'm doing. It's no secret
that I've alienated many of them from
the University by not letting them par
ticipate in decision-making processes,
keeping budget information secret, and
being unresponsive to their concerns.
But who cares? (Points at the audience.)
If people don't have the courage to
express their dissatisfaction with my
tenure, then it really doesn't matter
what they think.
(The laughter of a thousand villains can
be heard in the background over the sounds
of thunder. Lightning flashes, howling
winds blow across the stage and wolves bay
at the moon. This cacophonous symphony
lulls the president back to sleep.)
