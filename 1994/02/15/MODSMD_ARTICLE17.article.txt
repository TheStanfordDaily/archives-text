## Freshman Wideman impresses as starting guard Despite a rocky beginning, Wideman's consistency and intense defense distinguish her as a team and court leader 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
Basketball fans who think Brevin Knight is Stan
ford's best freshman point guard might want to
think again.
Although Knight's play has won him some much
deserved attention, fellow first-year guard Jamila
Wideman has made a successful debut of her own on
the Cardinal women's basketball team.

Starting in all 20 games
this season, Wideman's abili
ty to lead the team on the
floor has been of crucial
value to the Cardinal's 15-5
record.
"Jamila has come in as a
freshman and established
herself as a team leader,"
said center Anita Kaplan.
"She's a true point guard."
The numbers speak for
themselves. Throughout 20
games she has registered 96
assists, including 25 in the
last three. These stats cur
rently tie her at fifth in the

Pacific 10 Conference with 4.8 assists-per-game aver
age. Add the facts that she has played 29.3 minutes
per game (second on the team to Rachel Hemmer),
has scored in double figures five times and has made
1.8 steals-per-game, and one gets an idea of what a
successful freshman year Wideman has had.
"She is a pleasure to work with every day. She's
very consistent," said Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer.
Yet consistency was lacking for Wideman in some
of the season's early games, a shortcoming which she
attributes to the growing pains of a new player at the
position.
"There was definitely an adjustment period," said
Wideman, a team tri-captain. "I realized as a fresh
man and as a point guard that it is important to
establish yourself as a threat and to make people
guard you, so I forced shots and passes instead of let
ting it come to me."
Despite the rough start, VanDerveer has stuck
with the freshman for a variety of reasons. One is
Wideman's interpersonal capabilities.
"You can tell Jamila something and then she'll go
out and do it. ... I have a lot of confidence in her. We
communicate well and she communicates well with
the other players," VanDerveer said. "The most
important thing for a point guard is to be an exten
sion of the coach on the floor."
Wideman admitted having an eager ear for what
her coach tells her.
"It is IVanDerveer's] responsibility as a coach to
make you the best you can be," Wideman said. "She
has a lot to teach and there is a lot I want to learn."

'Defense is something I
could do before I could play
offense — it's easier to get
into the game that way. Your
shot can come and go, but
your defense is always there.'
— Jamila Wideman

VanDerveer also said she appreciates Wideman's
tenacious defense. The 5-foot-6 Wideman makes no
bones about why her defensive play is so important to
her game.
"Defense is something I could do before I could
play offense — it's easier to get into the game that
way," she said. "Your shot can come and go, but your
defense is always there. Our offensive success has a
lot to do with how we play defensively."
Jamila attributes some of her success to a hard-

nosed attitude on the court
that she developed while
playing "a much more physi
cal game" in a league in
which every other team con
sisted of all boys.
Noting that "even at the
age of six or seven [she] was
very aware of' the attitudes
of parents who didn't think
she was good enough to be on
the court with the guys,
Wideman said, "I had to earn
respect once I was there.
Having that kind of attitude
makes you more aggressive
and assertive."

Her attitude helped her to become the starting
point guard at Amherst Regional High School in
Massachusetts for six straight years.
"My mom was a little worried," Wideman said of
the decision to play varsity ball as a 4-foot-6, 80-
pound seventh-grader. "She thought I would be too
small. But the coach talked her into it."
As a high school senior, Wideman led her team to
the Massachusetts state title and was named to
numerous All-American lists. But pone of her accom
plishments provided her with a preferred position
coming into her first year on the Stanford team.
"While I was being recruited by Stanford, I wasn't
promised a startingjob — and I liked that," Wideman
said. "It was apparent from the beginning that it was
going to be whoever earned the position."
By earning the premier spot, Wideman steps into
the shoes of a select group of Stanford point guards
who have started as freshmen: Virginia Sourlis ('B6),
Jennifer Azzi ('9O), Sonja Henning (*9l) and of
course, Brevin Knight ('97).
And what about the comparisons that Wideman
and Knight will inevitably invite in the coming years?
Without a doubt a few are already being entertained.
"No one on the team thinks of Jamila as a fresh
man. I don't think the men think of Brevin as a
freshman," VanDerveer said.
And according to Wideman, "I love watching
Brevin play. He really came in and took control of his
team. He does a lot to create — which is what I'm
working on."
It seems that Wideman herself could teach specta
tors a thing or two.
