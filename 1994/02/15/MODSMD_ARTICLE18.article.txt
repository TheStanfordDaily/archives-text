# No. 7 spikers set to clash with Pacific
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Still basking in the afterglow of a weekend
tournament win, University of the Pacific will
get a harsh dose of reality tonight as it squares
off against the No. 7-ranked Cardinal men's vol
leyball squad at 7 p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.
Posting an impressive 5-3 overall record with
a 3-1 showing in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation, the Tigers have exceeded even their
own pre-season expectations and are threaten
ing to become the MPSF Cinderella team of
1994.
After upending No. 8 San Diego State last
week, the Tigers returned to their den over the
weekend and shredded Lewis University, UC-
Santa Cruz and California en route to winning
their own tournament.
"They have been putting together some good
matches lately, but we still have a hell of a lot
more talent," said junior middle blocker Brian

Garrett. "Man for man, we clearly have the bet
ter team."
Nevertheless, Stanford (5-3, 4-0) is still wary
of the fact that Pacific will field six returning
starters tonight, including 6-foot-5 middle block
er Jeff Hall who led the Tigers with 247 kills last
season. Flanking him on the outside will be 6-3
outside hitter Darren Lance, who trailed Hall by
only one kill, tallying 246 on the season.
However, the Cardinal will counter tonight
with the return of its biggest offensive weapon,
senior setter Canyon Ceman, who has been out
with a leg infection.
"Stewart [Chong] has done a great job filling
in, but having Canyon back gives us an extra
boost," said senior swing hitter Joe Burghardt.
"He is the best in the nation."
In addition to Ceman's return, head coach
Ruben Nieves might shuffle the lineup around
and insert Burghardt back in as middle blocker
for half the rotation. That would require start
ing either sophomore J.B. Taylor or freshman

Aaron Garcia in Burghardt's place.
"Joe is a really good middle blocker," said
freshman middle blocker Mike Hoefier. "He'll
still be passing when he's in the back row, but
with this set-up 1 sophomore| Mike Ijambert will
be able to hit in all six rotations."
One of the major offensive catalysts on the
Cardinal squad, Lambert might be asked to pass
less and pound more, if this rotation is imple
mented. "This might help the team out, and
that's all that's important," Burghardt said.
Other than that shift in the lineup, Stanford
is not anticipating any problems against the
Tigers tonight. "All we have to do is just play our
game," Garrett said. "We don't have to do any
thing special. That's been the case all year long,
but sometimes we made matches out of nothing.
Hopefully that won't be the case against Pacif
ic."
After facing Pacific, the Cardinal will return
to Burnham Saturday to take on No. 3 Brigham
Young, its biggest MPSF matchup so far.
