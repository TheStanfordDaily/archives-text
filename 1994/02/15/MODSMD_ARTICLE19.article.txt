# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Power. The force behind a Laxmi Poruri
serve slammed down on the Stanford Stadium
Court. Agility. The grace displayed by Mark
Booth intricately swinging and twisting
around the pommel horse. Style. The ease with
which Rachel Hemmer lofted her 24 into the
hoop this weekend.
The list could go on as Stanford sports fin

ished another three days filled with displays of
athletic prowess â€” squishing Weenies and
squelching Waves.
Jene Elzie and Dan Reed stood out from the
baseball and the women's gymnastics teams to
merit this week's Athletes of the Week. Their
weekend performances both displayed power,
agility and style of their own.
In a remarkable seven-inning outing on Sat
urday, left-handed pitcher Reed foiled the Bron
co bats in a run-less showing on the way to
Stanford's 10-1 win. Leading the Cardinal (7-4)
to take two of three from Santa Clara over the
weekend series, he allowed only five hits, strik
ing out five batters and walking only three.
A true "South" paw, Reed hails from
McLean, Va. During his first season on the
Farm, he racked up 17 wins and finished third
among the hurling squad with a 4.95 earned
run average. Considered one of the Cardinal's
top pitchers in his second season, Reed's 18 2/3
innings have so far fulfilled the expectation.
While on the mound, he has not allowed a sin
gle runner, and only eight hits. Reed currently
holds a team low 1.64 ERA.

Just as Reed's moundwork enlivened the
Sunken Diamond this weekend, Elzie captured
the limelight on the joint women's and men's
gymnastics meet in Maples. The versatile com
petitor garnered first place in the all-around
with a score of 38.800 against UCSB and BYU.
She also captured first on the floor with a 9.825

and landed her vault for a second in the event.
The El Cerrito, Calif, native is regaining her
ifcomentum afler an injury limited most of her
competition to the bars last year. Dominating
the Pac-10 on the one event she attacked, Elzie
became one of the first NCAA regional cham
pions from Stanford, along with teammate
Hillaiy Anderson.
