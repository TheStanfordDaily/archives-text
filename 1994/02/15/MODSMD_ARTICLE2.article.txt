## Commission reports subcommittees on schedule in information gathering 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Yesterday's meeting of the
Commission on Undergraduate
Education revealed that the group
is on schedule and subcommittees
are intent on researching how
Stanford undergraduates learn,
commission members said.
The afternoon gathering was
the first meeting of the commis
sion as a whole since Jan. 10, when
the members split into seven sub
committees. Each subcommittee
is trying to collect more informa
tion on a particular area of under
graduate education.
No specific proposals were
made at yesterday's meeting, but
commission chair and History
Prof. James Sheehan said that
none were expected. Much of the
meeting was spent discussing the
different methods subcommittees
are using to gather information
and what the commission should
do in spring quarter, he said.

"All (subcommittees) appear to
be on schedule and making
progress on their particular
tasks," Sheehan said. Most of the
subcommittees have been meeting
once a week, and one has met
twice a week, he added.
Sheehan said the subcommit
tees were "intended to set people
to work especially on those areas
where we needed to gather more
information. . . . We're looking for
as many ways to gather informa
tion as we can."
Committees yesterday dis
cussed their various methods of
getting input, said Wanda Corn, a
commission member and director
of the Humanities Center. The
methods cited include student
focus groups and calling randomly
selected students
Several groups expressed inter
est in surveying students on their
opinions, Sheehan said.
"By and large, all the commit-
tees have done some sort of
information gathering," Corn said.
"I think the subcommittees are all
working very hard. .. .We're going
to understand much better after
this quarter how Stanford stu
dents and Stanford faculty feel
about learning and teaching."
Both Sheehan and Corn said
that, while the subcommittees are
working well, they are not covering
every area of undergraduate edu
cation.
Sheehan said some issues that
are "important" but didn't require
more data gathering haven't been
covered by subcommittees, but will
likely be discussed more by the

whole commission. Such issues
include the "goals, values and gov
ernance" of education, he said.
Corn agreed that the subcom
mittees haven't been all inclusive.
Some subcommittees have
touched on the same areas that
might be ripe for further study, or
found new areas to study, she said.
"I think it would be wrong to
assume we're not going to have
another subcommittee along the
line," she said.
In addition to checking on the
subcommittees' progress, the com
mission also charted its future
course yesterday. Members sched
uled the next meeting of the full
commission for Feb. 28, when sub
committees will give further
progress reports and the commis
sion will create an "inventory" of
what areas a fmal report should

discuss, Sheehan said.
The following meeting is sched
uled for March 14, when the group
will hopefully create a more
detailed list of topics for the report,
he said. Beginning next quarter,
the commission will meet weekly
as a whole.
Sheehan said all the subcom
mittees should report by the end of
this quarter or at the beginning of
next quarter. Then the whole com
mission will discuss the reports
and find areas of consensus and
disagreement.
Then, over the summer, one
person — perhaps Sheehan him
self — will write a report summa
rizing the commission's work,
which will be given to University
President Gerhard Casper, he said.
Sheehan said he assumes that
report will be a public document.
