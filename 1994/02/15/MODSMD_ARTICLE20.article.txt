# Sixth Man welcome addition to Maples
## 
### 
LET'S SETTLE this once
and for all: the Sixth Man
Club is a great thing for
Stanford men's basketball and
should be continued. Period.
The club, a brainchild of the
Stanford Sports Marketing
Department, has vastly im
proved fan support for men's
basketball games at Maples
Pavilion. No longer is Maples a
placid place, and more impor
tantly, no longer is the student
section empty.
As usual here at Stanford,

there are vari
ous individuals,
and groups, who
are whining
about the club,
complaining
among other
things that it
segregates the
student section
and is economi- [
cally elitist.

These people have done their
best to paint themselves as the
current en vogue category of cit
izens in Stanford's society — as
"victims." Sorry, folks, you're
not victims. You have no one to
blame for your plight but your
selves.
At the beginning of the bas
ketball season, Sixth Man was
open to everybody. Fliers were
posted all around campus,
advertisements were placed in
this newspaper, and informa
tion about the club was avail
able at the basketball games
themselves. By now, everyone is
familiar with the deal: 10 bucks
gets you a t-shirt, pre-game
meals before every game at
Halftime Sports Bar, and
reserved center court seats.
To those who claim that they
could not join the club because
of its $10 price tig: get real. You
should be grateful that you are
able to attend the games at all.
Contrary to popular perception,
student fees are not the reason
why students get in free to bas
ketball games. Those fees go

towards academic services —■
none of that money goes to the
Athletic Department. As such,
athletics has to look for alter
nate sources of revenue.
It is the generosity of load
establishments such as Fry's
Electronics and Pepsi (whose
logos adorn the billboards sur
rounding the court) who donate
money to the department which
subsidizes student tickets. So
please, stop complaining about
something you should be paying
for. Only two short years ago, at

the end of
the Adam
Keefe era, a
student sea
son ticket
was $20, and
that did not
include any
food or
reserved
seating.
For

t he past two seasons, the games
have been free. My question to
the complainers is this: where
were you last year?!? I covered
the Stanford men's basketball
team hist season, and I watched
every home game. The stands
were empty. Aside from the
UCLA, Cal and Arizona games,
a center court seat could be
found even after tip-off. Many of
the people now in the club were
some of the few loyal diehards
who came to the other games
last year against the non-mar
quee teams.
It wasn't until the men's bas
ketball team started winning
again this year that the fickle
complainers who were nowhere
near Maples last season jumped
on the bandwagon and l)egan
showing up to the games. Then,
after discovering the Sixth Man
Club, they complained about
not having prime seats.
Well tough. The club was
designed to ensure that the
team would have a core group of

fans that would show up to the
games regardless of the team's
position in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence standings. The Cardinal
squad knows that it has a certain
group of supporters that will be
at every contest to cheer their
efforts, and to get their
adrenaline pumping. Indeed, as
the club's name implies, to be
the Stanford basketball team's
sixth man.
The stands are not segregated
by economics. If you're too cheap
to shell out an Alexander Hamil
ton, then you deserve to sit
where you sit. Be happy you're
not in the rafters. Consider, for a
moment, how students are able
to attend games at other schools:
• At Pac-10 rival UCLA, stu
dents enter a lottery for the
right — yes, the right — to pur
chase tickets. If they are lucky

enough to be chosen, they then
pay $7 a ticket for each game.
• At the University of North
Carolina, the tickets are free,
but all students must go to the
ticket office in advance to get
tickets for the upper level. If you
want floor seats in Chapel Hill,
students must sleep out for each
game.
• At Duke, tickets are also
free, but students pay with their
time. Students must camp out
for every game in order to
ensure a spot in Cameron Indoor
Stadium — where the entire
floor level is reserved for stu
dents. This camping trip can be a
simple overnight, or, as is the
case when the game is against
archrival Carolina, a two-week
ordeal.
At Stanford, students have it
easy. Fifteen minutes before the
game, they can stroll to Maples,
flash their student identification
card, and sit in floor seats. No
sacrifice of time or money is

needed. This is taken for grant
ed. And now some would carp
because others are willing to pay
extra to get a better view.
The irony is, those who are
yelling the loudest are the same
types of people who only showed
up for the Cal and UCLA games.
Just last week against Arizona,
which was ranked No. 16 at the
time, the student section wasn't
even packed. Where were you
guys then? Probably writing let
ters to The Daily, watching "The
Simpsons" or doing your home
work when you should have been
cheering on your team.
Too bad for you. Either sup
port your team or keep quiet
about the club. The choice is
yours. The members of the Sixth
Man Club have already made
theirs.
