# Baseball overcomes Wyoming 6-0
## Pitching efforts of Middlebrook and Rada, Hansen's home run propel Cardinal 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
After a 1-0 loss to St. Mary's two weeks ago,
some were beginning to have doubts about the
Cardinal's ability to compete in the Pacific 10
Southern Division and secure a berth in the
College World series.
Since that time, however, Stanford has qui
etly laid those doubts to rest, putting together
outstanding pitching and a consistent offense
to win six of seven games. Wyoming, the latest
victim of this scoring spree, fell to the Cardi
nal yesterday 6-0 before 298 fans at Sunken
Diamond.
Despite some wildness early in the game,
Stanford starter Jason Middlebrook (2-0) was
almost untouchable on the mound, blowing
away many of the Cowboy hitters with a fast
ball clocked at 96 miles per hour.
"Jason struggled a little bit with his con
trol, but he kept going out there and compet
ing each inning," said Cardinal catcher A.J.
Hinch, Middlebrook's batterymate. "His
velocity is overwhelming and he has great con
trol."
The freshman right-hander flirted with a
no-hitter into the seventh inning, before
Wyoming shortstop Ed Crippen's clean single
to right with one out spoiled his bid.
"[Crippen] was putting pretty good alu
minum on the ball all day, and when I got in

the hole [in the count], I wasn't getting my
slider over, so I went with my fastball since I
needed a strike," Middlebrook said. "He hit it
— he was a good hitter."
That would be the only hit that Wyoming
would get, however, as Middlebrook was
relieved by fellow freshman Ben Rada, who
retired all eight batters he faced, striking out
two in the process. Middlebrook ended up
pitching 6 1/3 innings and surrendering the
one hit, while walking six and striking out six.
"He's got a lot of confidence, he's a big time
competitor, and he goes right after hitters,"
Hinch said. "I don't think he's intimidated by
anybody."
Offensively, Stanford struck first in the
fourth inning with sophomore Cale Carter lac
ing a two-run single to left field off Wyoming
starter Chris Brocious. Carter finished two
for-four with two RBIs.
"He came right after me with a fastball on
the inner half of the plate," Carter said. "I just
tried to be aggressive and made good contact."
The Cardinal struck again in the fifth
inning, scoring three more runs, highlighted
by second baseman Jed Hansen's two-run
home run deep off the scoreboard in left.
Hansen also added a triple, two singles, and
two stolen bases to cap off a perfect four-for
four showing and break out of a season-long
slump.
"Today was a good first step to get [Jed]

swinging the bat consistently like he can,"
said Stanford coach Mark Marquess. "We're
going to need him to play well for us, and he
will. This is a good start for us."
Stanford scored another run to ice the
game in the seventh inning on an RBI single
by freshman shortstop Eric Sees. On the day,
the Cardinal was aggressive on the basepaths
and essentially did what it pleased on offense,
pounding out 11 hits and stealing five bases.
The Cardinal will try to improve its non
conference record today as it hosts Sacramen
to State at 2 p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
Spectators can expect a high scoring game
if past trends are any indication. The Hornets
are 2-2 this season, dropping two of three this
past weekend to UC-Santa Barbara. Against
the Gauchos, Sacramento State scored 20
runs, but their pitching staff gave up 33 in the
three games.
First baseman Josh Kirtlan and outfielder
Ray Brown have led the charge for Sacramen
to State offensively this season, each compil
ing a .412 batting average. In just four games,
the Hornets have bashed six home runs, two
of those coming from the bat of shortstop
Mike Carpentier.
"They're a good, solid team and they
always seem to play us well," Marquess said.
"It'll be a good test for us. We've got to con
tinue to swing the bat well and hopefully we'll
get good pitching again."
