# Synchro twirls to first, third
## 
### Kyle Graham Staff writer 
There is no truth to the rumor that the Cardinal
synchronized swimming team is so good that it had
to split its team in two to give its opponents any
chance at victory.
However, the Stanford squad did indeed engage
in a bit of collegiate mitosis over the weekend, send
ing half of the team to Washington, half to Ohio
State. And, despite the split, the two squads gar
nered impressive results in their respective meets,
finishing first in Seattle and a respectable third in
Columbus.
In the team's first-ever competition against the
Huskies, the Cardinal placed first in the singles,
doubles and team competitions. Meanwhile, the
Huskies took the top position in trios, the only
event in which Stanford did not compete.
For the Cardinal, sophomore Julie Davies took
first place in the singles event, with freshmen Brid
get Finn and Maia Young, sophomore Jodi Michael
and junior Jenny Curtis also turning in strong per
formances.
"I thought the meet went well. . . . We're getting
adjusted to each other and getting more used to

each other in the water," Young said.
The half-squad which traveled to Columbus
found the Ohio waters somewhat less friendly, as
the perennially strong Buckeyes took the top posi
tions in all events. However, the Cardinal swim
mers mustered several strong performances.
Stanford's stellar combination of senior Debbie
Downes and Bauman took third in the duet contest,
and the trio of Downes, Bauman and sophomore
Jen Graves placed third in their competition.
Overall, the Cardinal's third-place finish in the
Columbus competition was dictated more by the
number of swimmers who competed for Stanford
than by the team's overall showing. After Ohio
State's clean sweep of the meet's top positions,
Stanford posted most of the top performances, but
fell behind the University of Richmond in the over
all standings due to the Virginia school's larger
number of competitors.
Cardinal coach Vickey Weir viewed the week
end's meets as both an opportunity to reflect on the
season to date and peer into the not-so-distant
future.
"It was really good to see how Ohio State looks,"
Weir said. "It was also interesting to see how far
we've progressed, but we also have a ways to go."
