# Graduate projects to enlighten consumers
## 
### Grace Cua Dy 
About 40 graduate students
who pooled their engineering and
marketing expertise to develop bi
cycle-lighting systems will see the
result of two quarters of intensive
work when 100 selected con
sumers assess their products
Thursday night.
This year, the students in "In
tegrated Design for Manufactur
ing and Marketability" developed
several bicycle-lighting systems
which will be appraised on how
well they guide cyclists around
campus as well as their price and
manufacturing design.
"The interesting thing about
the class is that it is not divided
into engineers and MBAs," said
Ered Bould, a teaching assistant
for the class. "The teams are pret
ty mixed, with engineers con
tributing to the cost operations
and the MBAs involved in the
manufacturing of the product."
The three-year old course is

team taught by Mechanical Engi
neering Design Prof. David
Beach, Operations Management
Prof. William Lovejoy and V.
(Seenu) Srinivasan, a marketing
professor.
Past projects have included can
crushers and juice makers, but ac
cording to Lovejoy "there wasn't
much market potential for these
products, though there were a few
very commendable designs."
This year there is a possibility
of actually marketing several of
the exceptional designs, he added.
The course is divided into 10
teams, each composed of two
MBA graduate students and two
engineering students as well as a
team coach from companies such
as Apple and Hewlett-Packard.
The teams conduct market re
search, design and manufacture
the product, and must compete
against each other in a simulated
market.
However, according to Lon van
Geloven, another TA, "there was
less competitiveness and secrecy
this year. There was a lot more
cooperation among teams in
sharing of processes, informa
tion, sourcing and manufacturing
than from previous years."
In the past, a panel of design
experts evaluated the students'
products. This year is different,
however. "We have the opportu-

nity to go directly to the con
sumers and get their assess
ment," Bould said.
In the fall, the teams were
required to collect data from
about 300 consumers and build a
product based on that market
research. Some teams geared
their products to people who were
more concerned with being seen
by cars, noting that the campus
itself was pretty well lit.
The bike lights were assessed on
characteristics such as light inten
sity, unit costs, weight, detachabili
ty and operation costs. The teams
were limited to price ranges from

$10 to $75, Lovejoy said.
The students will present their
products using slides, videos and
photographs to 100 consumers,
one-third of the original 300 sur
veyed. The consumers will then
fill out another survey based on
the product demonstrations.
"To most of the people the
course was an enlightenment on
all the different aspects required in
manufacturing," Bould said. "For
example, a lot of engineers work in
only theoretical aspects. ... It is
great for the students to see their
work progress from the drawing
board to actual products."
