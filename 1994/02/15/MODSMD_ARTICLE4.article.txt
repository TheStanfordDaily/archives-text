# Casper, students discuss merits of three-year degree proposal
## 
### Charles Katz Jim Luh Staff writers 
While the Board of Trustees recently
raised tuition 5 percent, University
President Gerhard Casper is looking for
a way to cut it 25 percent — by encour
aging a three-year undergraduate degree
program.
Casper joined a group of ASSU Sena
tors and a few interested students last
night in an ASSU-sponsored discussion
of the possible implications of offering a
three-year program.
Although there is no formal proposal

yet, Casper said the Commission on Un
dergraduate Education is looking into
the three-year option as part of their
myriad responsibilities.
The rising costs of education now af
fect almost all students, Casper said, not
just those receiving financial aid. By cut
ting down the number of years suggested
for earning a degree, he added, some of
that financial burden can be alleviated.
Although he admitted that one reason
for the traditional four-year college expe
rience is to facilitate a maturing process,
he questioned the cost of that experi
ence.
"College is all about maturing . . . but

at $25,000 a year?" he said.
Recent changes in technology allow
ing long-distance interactive education
and advances in multi-media technology
will make it possible for future students
to complete introductory course work
away from a classroom, Casper said.
He noted that programs such as the
Stanford Instructional Television Net
work already allow people to do course
work from off-campus locations.
Technological progress will inevitably
have an impact on education and Stan
ford will have to adapt to survive, Casper
said. Such circumstances are "not
what I like. I shudder at much of it,
but it is going to happen," he
added.
But technological advance
ments will never completely elimi
nate the benefits of an on-campus
education, including working
closely with professors and learn
ing from fellow students, he said.
"These aspects of learning are not
likely to be replaced by any infor
mation technology."

While graduate senator Jerry
Yang, who earned his Stanford
undergraduate degree in three
years, agreed that technology will
change the face of education, he
questioned the wisdom of offering
a specific three-year plan, given
that students can already graduate
a year early if they want to.
Casper challenged Yang's con
tention that a three-year degree is a
serious option now. "We don't stand
in the way, but that is, I think, all we
are doing," Casper said.
Currently, he said, the Univer
sity does not encourage a three
year program, but 20 percent of
students earn two bachelor

degrees or a co-terminal degree in
four years.
Since one-fifth of the student
body can essentially finish in three
years, he said, the University
should not encourage students to
stay four years unnecessarily.
With all the talk about shorten
ing a student's stay at Stanford, at
least one student said he believes
the four-year program is not
enough time and degree require
ments should be increased in
order to achieve a truly broad edu
cation.
"I wish I could stay here
longer," senior Ahmad Rahman
said.
