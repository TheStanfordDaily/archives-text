# Casper, students discuss merits of three-year degree proposal

While the Board of Trustees recently
raised tuition 5 percent, University
President Gerhard Casper is looking for
a way to cut it 25 percent â€” by encour
aging a three-year undergraduate degree
program.
Casper joined a group of ASSU Sena
tors and a few interested students last
night in an ASSU-sponsored discussion
of the possible implications of offering a
three-year program.
Although there is no formal proposal

yet, Casper said the Commission on Un
dergraduate Education is looking into
the three-year option as part of their
myriad responsibilities.
The rising costs of education now af
fect almost all students, Casper said, not
just those receiving financial aid. By cut
ting down the number of years suggested
for earning a degree, he added, some of
that financial burden can be alleviated.
Although he admitted that one reason
for the traditional four-year college expe
rience is to facilitate a maturing process,
he questioned the cost of that experi
ence.
"College is all about maturing . . . but

at $25,000 a year?" he said.
Recent changes in technology allow
ing long-distance interactive education
and advances in multi-media technology
will make it possible for future students
to complete introductory course work
away from a classroom, Casper said.
He noted that programs such as the
Stanford Instructional Television Net
work already allow people to do course
work from off-campus locations.
Technological progress will inevitably
have an impact on education and Stan
ford will have to adapt to survive, Casper
