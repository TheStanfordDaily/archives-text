# Webb, Union arbitration delayed by dispute over terms of contract
## 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Efforts to arbitrate a dispute over who
may live in Webb Ranch trailers have
stalled even though the decision to bring
in an independent arbitrator was made
four months ago.
Difficulties in obtaining an arbitrator
have delayed settlement of the housing
disagreement between the Webbs and the
United Stanford Workers, said union
Deputy Trustee Jon Showalter.
A clause in the arbitration contract
states that the arbitrator must be able to
meet with the concerned parties within

seven days of selection. Since most also hold
regular jobs, "no arbitrator is going to be
able to see us in seven days," Showalter said.
In 1991, the University offered eight
housing trailers, originally from Manzani
ta Park, to anyone willing to pay the mov
ing costs. The Webbs, who have leased the
237-acre vegetable and berry farm from
Stanford since 1922, paid the costs and the
trailers now reside at the ranch. The trail
ers were meant to replace several older
trailers deemed "unfit for human occu
pancy" by San Mateo county health offi
cials last year.
The dispute arose when the USW
claimed that the Webbs were illegally

denying housing to the workers by allow
ing non-workers occupancy of the trailers.
According to Showalter, the arbitrator
will decide "who is in control of the trailers
that were donated."
The Webbs claim that they should be re
sponsible for determining who gets to live
in the trailers, while the union contends
that it is the workers' decision, he said.
An arbitrator was selected in mid-No
vember, according to Showalter, but be
cause of scheduling conflicts he was un
able to find time to hear the grievances
within the required seven-day period.
