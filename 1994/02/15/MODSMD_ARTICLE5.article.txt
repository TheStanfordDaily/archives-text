# Webb, Union arbitration delayed by dispute over terms of contract
## 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Efforts to arbitrate a dispute over who
may live in Webb Ranch trailers have
stalled even though the decision to bring
in an independent arbitrator was made
four months ago.
Difficulties in obtaining an arbitrator
have delayed settlement of the housing
disagreement between the Webbs and the
United Stanford Workers, said union
Deputy Trustee Jon Showalter.
A clause in the arbitration contract
states that the arbitrator must be able to
meet with the concerned parties within

seven days of selection. Since most also hold
regular jobs, "no arbitrator is going to be
able to see us in seven days," Showalter said.
In 1991, the University offered eight
housing trailers, originally from Manzani
ta Park, to anyone willing to pay the mov
ing costs. The Webbs, who have leased the
237-acre vegetable and berry farm from
Stanford since 1922, paid the costs and the
trailers now reside at the ranch. The trail
ers were meant to replace several older
trailers deemed "unfit for human occu
pancy" by San Mateo county health offi
cials last year.
The dispute arose when the USW
claimed that the Webbs were illegally

denying housing to the workers by allow
ing non-workers occupancy of the trailers.
According to Showalter, the arbitrator
will decide "who is in control of the trailers
that were donated."
The Webbs claim that they should be re
sponsible for determining who gets to live
in the trailers, while the union contends
that it is the workers' decision, he said.
An arbitrator was selected in mid-No
vember, according to Showalter, but be
cause of scheduling conflicts he was un
able to find time to hear the grievances
within the required seven-day period.
"Webb Ranch continues to use a
technicality in the contract to
block arbitration," Showaiter said.
But Terry O'Connor, the attor
ney representing the Webbs, said
the family has no "interest in
delaying the arbitration." He said
that scheduling conflicts are nor
mal during arbitration processes.
O'Connor added that another

list of possible arbitrators has been
requested from the Federal Media
tion and Conciliation Service, and
he foresees the process being com
pleted within the next few months.
Once the arbitration hearing
begins, the dispute could be settled
within about 30 days.
The union is considering ways
to speed up arbitration, Showalter
said. Going to court and "getting
an order to compel arbitration" is
one possibility, he added.
"It's not a question of whether,
it's a question of when," he said.

"What I hate is that what we're
involved in now is a war of dueling
lawyers. It does nothing to solve
the problem; all it does is pay the
lawyers."
Others have expressed their dis
appointment at the halted arbitra
tion process as well. "This is the
same kind of cruel and mean-spir
ited behavior that we've come to
expect from the Webbs. ... It's dis
gusting," said English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz, who has taken an
active part in the Webb Ranch dis
putes in recent years.
