# 'People in Washington are like the people in the Land of the Lotus Eaters'
## Hoover begins conference on Congress 
### Kyle Graham Staff writer 
The Hoover Institution kicked off a three-day
conference on the subject of congressional ac
countability yesterday with two panel discus
sions and a keynote speech by former U.S. Attor
ney General Griffin Bell.
During his speech last night at the Faculty
Club, Bell spoke of the need for term-limit legis
lation in the United States, ruling the recent U.S.
District Court decision which found term-limit
legislation passed by Washington state unconsti
tutional.
Speaking in a thick Southern drawl, Bell said,
"People in Washington are like the people in the
Land of the Lotus Eaters in Homer's 'Odyssey';
they all ate the lotus and forgot about going
home."
Bell, who served as attorney general from
1977-79 during the Carter Administration, has
more recently acted as lead counsel for LIMIT,
a group seeking to advance term-limit legisla
tion.
He said his support for term limits lies in a de
sire for "getting our government under control,"
and suggested a 12-year cap on congressional ser
vice for both houses of Congress.
The panel discussions, held earlier in the
day at Hoover's Stouffer Auditorium, were en
titled "Gridlock Reports: The Impact of Uni
fied Party Government" and"Budget Re
ports: The Budget Process and Its Reform,"
and included participants from Stanford,
Hoover, the U.S. Congress, the Brookings In-

stitution and other academic
groups.
In the first panel, there was a
sharp divide among the panelists
as to the nature and relative
malignancy of congressional grid
lock.
"The message that I take away
from the panel so far is 'gridlock
is good,' " said panelist and
Hoover Senior Fellow Martin
Anderson, who was on one edge

of the spectrum.
Other panelists for the after
noon's first discussion included
U.S. Rep. Norman Mineta, Politi
cal Science Prof. David Brady,
Harvard University Prof. Morris
Fiorina and Barbara Sinclair, pro
fessor at UC-Riverside.
After a short recess, the confer
ence took up the subject of con
gressional budget reform, with
panelists such as former U.S. Rep.
William Frenzel, a self-described
"recovering congressman";
Hoover Senior Fellows John
Cogan, Michael Boskin and
Annelise Anderson; Stanford Eco

nomics Prof. Roger Noll and Uni
versity of Maryland Prof. Allen
Schick.
Both Bell's speech and the
panel discussions will be made
available to PBS affiliates nation
wide via satellite, according to
Richard Sousa, associate director
for operations at Hoover.
The conference — funded by a
grant from the Taube Family
Foundation — will continue
through Wednesday, and will
include discussions on the
strengthening of political parties,
campaign finance, term limits and
congressional reform.
