conference on the subject of congressional ac

District Court decision which found term-limit
legislation passed by Washington state unconsti

Speaking in a thick Southern drawl, Bell said,
"People in Washington are like the people in the
Land of the Lotus Eaters in Homer's 'Odyssey';
they all ate the lotus and forgot about going
home."
Bell, who served as attorney general from
1977-79 during the Carter Administration, has
more recently acted as lead counsel for LIMIT,

He said his support for term limits lies in a de

The panel discussions, held earlier in the
day at Hoover's Stouffer Auditorium, were en
titled "Gridlock Reports: The Impact of Uni

and included participants from Stanford,
Hoover, the U.S. Congress, the Brookings In-
