# Recent false fire alarms trouble Roble

Roble residents have had some rude awak
enings recently. Twice in the last few weeks, at
approximately 4:45 a.m., blasts from the
dorm's fire alarms have jerked slumbering stu
dents out of bed and into the cold of morning.
University Fire Marshal Joseph Leung said
the incidents were not planned drills or pranks,
but were most likely activated by momentary
water surges into the sprinkler system pipes.
These surges occur because sprinkler sys
tems and the domestic water supply are con
nected to the same network of underground
piping. Leung — who replaced retired Univer
sity Fire Marshal Raymond Gamma in Febru
ary — said that since the water supply is sub
ject to constant and unpredictable variations in
pressure — such as flushes of toilets and wash
ing machine cycles — such surges inevitably

occur from time to time.
These surges, which send water flowing
through the sprinkler system pipes, activate
the main flow switch which activates the alarm.
Leung said these surges are different than
other pipe problems, major and minor leaks.
When major leaks — such as those caused by a
ruptured pipe — activate alarms, clearing a
building's fire alarm control panel and reset
ting the alarm system is impossible.
In the case of both Roble alarms, however,
the responding fire captain's reports indicate
that the control panel was cleared and the sys
tem reset, excluding the possibility of any major
leak. Minor leaks do not supply the pressure re
quired to activate the alarms in the first place.
Surges can only cause false alarms in resi
dences that have sprinkler systems. Other
dorms on campus — many of which do not have
sprinkler systems — do not have the same

types of unexpected problems with their alarm
systems. Leung said another building where a
similar problem has occurred is the Medical
Center's Blake-Wilbur building.
Leung said that while it is impossible either
to predict or prevent these water surges, it is
possible to reduce the probability of their acti
vating the system's alarms. He added that he
has taken immediate steps to remedy Roble's
problems.
After contacting Operations and Manage
ment shortly following the Feb. 2 false alarm,
Leung requested that the time delay — a mech
anism alerted by the flow of water into sprin
kler pipes which sounds the alarm after a spec
ified interval — on the main flow alarm switch
be increased from 30 to 60 seconds. As former
Fire Protection Engineer of San Jose's Fire De-
partment, he said he has imple
mented this increased time delay
with success in the past.
An increased delay would simply
reduce the likelihood of alarm acti
vation as a result of a momentary
surge of water into sprinkler sys

tern pipes. Such a delay has no
effect on a sprinkler system's
response to a fire, which is triggered
by a heat-sensitive mechanism.
Much more frequent than
alarms activated by momentary
water surges are those resulting
from prank pulls of manual
alarms. Statistics compiled by
Captain Bruce Hallberg of the
Palo Alto Fire Department reveal
a high incidence of such pranks in

recent years on campus. In 1991
and 1992, there were approxi
mately 50 manual pulls; the num
ber jumped to 60 in 1993.
In response to the number of
false alarms, students who live in
Roble express annoyance and indif
ference toward the alarms. Sopho
more Monique Rocca, a resident in
Roble said, "every time [I hear a
fire alarm], I just lie in bed and
debate whether or not to get up."
