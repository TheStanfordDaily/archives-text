# Alleged gay harassment protested
## Students gather at Arrillaga weight room for 'be-in' 
### Cindy Yu Staff writer 
Members of the gay community demonstrated
last night in the weight room of Arrillaga gym to
protest an alleged harassment of a lesbian woman at
the facility last week.
Protesters included about 40 members of the gay
community as well as other concerned students.
Participants passed out fliers describing the Feb. 8
incident, in which a women wearing a "Queer
Nation" T-shirt was allegedly threatened by a man
while lifting weights.
The demonstrators remained at the gym for approx
imately 45 minutes, beginning at 9 p.m. While they
were easily identifiable by their number, the protesters
did not disrupt activities in the weight room.
"[Our purpose] is just to be a presence at the gym
and show that it's not a threatening atmosphere,"
senior Nicole Sanchez said.
Senior Rachel Maddow, who was one of the pri
mary organizers of the "be-in," said she hopes the
protest will "spark discussion" so something will be
done about the situation. "The point is not to make
a scene, but to raise consciousness of the incident
and the uncomfortable atmosphere of places espe
cially like the gym," Maddow said.
Organizers scheduled the be-in at exactly the
same time the alleged incident occurred one week
earlier in hopes that the person involved with the
incident or any witnesses would be present.

Although the purpose of the demonstration was
geared toward making the weight room more com
fortable for women and specifically lesbians, members
of the gay male community were also present. "This
type of violence can be extended to men as well. It
occurs to all gay people," senior Jason Menayan said.
"I really sympathize with what they have to go
through. There should be no reason why anyone
can't come here if they want to," said sophomore
Alex Schafran, who came to support the gay com
munity as well as to work out.
But not everyone viewed the protest as positively.
"I wouldn't be working tonight if I knew this would
happen, " said freshman Chris Serjak, who supervis
es the gym on Tuesday and Thursday nights. "I
don't get paid enough to put up with this."
Serjak, who was also working the night of the
alleged incident, said the problem was not brought
to his attention. "If they have a problem, we're here
to take care of it... or they can at least tell us. If it
came down to it, we have the power to ask someone
to leave," Serjak said.
Many bystanders supported the demonstration.
"I think it's wonderful that they can come in here
and express themselves freely. Hopefully things will
change," said freshman Ed Stuever.
Stanford Hospital employee Andre Scruth said he
has seen problems like last week's alleged incident
before. "There should be a sign saying that any mis
conduct or improper actions will result in the person
being thrown out," he said.
