David i an's case closed
SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Prosecutors played
tapes yesterday of Branch Davidians discussing
plans to ignite and spread a fire as authorities
prepared to rush their compound, then rested
their case against 11 cult members.
Defense attorneys attacked the credibility of
the FBI surveillance tapes, which include frag
ments such as, "Got any fuel?" "Start the fire?"
"I want a fire around the back" and "Let's keep
that fire going."
Cult leader David Koresh and 78 others —
including 18 children — were killed in the infer
no on April 19 at the compound near Waco.
Fighteen had been shot.
Prosecutors say the fire was set as part of a
suicide pact. Their last witness, Texas Ranger
Joe Haralson, read a statement that defendant
Graeme Craddock made to a grand jury on April
20 in which Craddock said that the Davidians
expected to "undergo a long siege."
"We all understood what we were there for,"
Craddock said in the statement.
The fire ended a 51-day standoff that had
begun with a botched raid by the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Four
agents and about six Davidians were killed in
the initial assault as authorities stormed the
compound trying to arrest Koresh on weapons
charges.
Defense attorneys said the Davidians acted
in self-defense. The 11 cult members charged
with murder and murder conspiracy face up to
life in prison if convicted.
U.S. wins another gold
LILLFHAMMFR, Norway (AP) - Two
races, two gold medals, two surprising winners.
The U.S. ski team — most often modified with
"much-maligned" — is turning a lack of respect
into a lode of medals.
The revived skiers, who spent a decade out of
the Olympic winner's circle, collected their sec
ond gold in as many races yesterday with anoth
er unlikely medalist — Diann Roffe-Steinrotter,
who hadn't won an international race since the
Reagan Administration.
The skier, the "old timer" of the women's
team at 26, picked up her Super-G gold on a day
when the grande dame of the Olympics scored a
bronze. Finland's 38-year-old Marja-Liisa
Kirvesniemi, competing in her record-tying
sixth Olympics, finished third in cross-country
skiing.
