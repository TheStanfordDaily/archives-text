## U.S. to impose sanctions on Japan 'Punitive tariffs' result of violation of cellular phone trade agreement 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Clinton
administration accused Japan yester
day of a "clear cut and serious" viola
tion of a cellular phone trade agree
ment and took the first step toward
imposing millions of dollars of punitive
tariffs.
U.S. officials made clear that the
retaliation planned in the telephone
case was just the first in a series of hard
line actions that would be taken follow
ing the breakdown of market-opening
"framework" talks last Friday.
U.S. Trade Representative Mickey
Kantor refused to discuss what other
retaliation was being contemplated but
he left no doubt that the administration
planned to keep pressure on Japan to
lower its $60 billion trade surplus with
America.
"All we're asking for is a two-way
street, that their markets be compara
bly open to our markets," Kantor said.
"We hope we can achieve that by the
various actions we'll take over the next
few months."
Congressional sources said they
expected the administration to
announce either today or tomorrow
that it was re-implementing a lapsed

section of U.S. trade law that provides
for retaliatory tariffs against countries
deemed to be "unfair traders" if negoti
ations fail to open the markets.
In the cellular case, Kantor said he
determined that Japan had failed to live
up to the terms of a 1989 agreement in
which it had promised to open its cellu
lar phone market to Motorola Inc.
Kantor said this was a "classic case of
the determination of Japan to keep its
markets closed, particularly to leading
edge U.S. products."
Kantor said the United States would
publish in the next 30 days a list of
Japanese products that could be subject
to punitive tariffs of up to 100 percent.
Kantor refused to say what products
would be targeted but he said the total
would be "several hundred millions of
dollars," equal to the sales lost by
Motorola.
Motorola President Christopher B.
Galvin estimated that his company was
suffering $250 million to $300 million
annually in lost sales because of Japan's
barriers. He praised the administra
tion's actions and expressed hope Japan
would relent so that sanctions would
not be necessary.

"We are disappointed and frustrated
that the Japanese government remains
committed to a policy that limits its
own consumers access to technology
available in the rest of the world," he
said.
The higher tariffs would not go into
effect until American consumers had a
chance to comment on the proposed
product list. This will give U.S. and
Japanese negotiators a second chance to
reach agreement, but U.S. officials say
if the issue is not resolved in the next
two months, the trade sanctions will
take effect.
In 1989, the Bush administration
threatened to raise tariffs on Japanese
products — from color televisions to
tape recorders — because of Japan's
failure to live up to an earlier agreement
to give Motorola access to its cellular
phone market.
Sanctions were averted in that case
when Japan pledged to take corrective
actions. The failure of that agreement is
the basis of the current dispute.
"After nine years of negotiations and
three agreements, it clearly is long past
time for results on this issue," Kantor
said.
