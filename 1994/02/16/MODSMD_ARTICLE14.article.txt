# Kelso agrees to retire, signals 'end of Tailhook'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Adrn.
Frank Kelso II agreed yesterday to
retire two months early, saying the
Navy needed a new chief because he
had become "the lightning rod" for
criticism over the Tailhook sex
abuse scandal.
"This issue . . . won't go away.
The lightning keeps striking all the
time, so I think it's best for the Navy
to give it another leader," the four
star admiral said.
Kelso's announcement that his
retirement would be moved up to
April 30 came in return for testimo
nials attesting to his personal
integrity from Defense Secretary
William Perry and Navy Secretary
John Dalton.
Because of the endorsements, he
said, "we can finally close this diffi
cult chapter" of Tailhook. He said
neither Perry nor Dalton asked him
to step down.
After the 1991 convention of the
Tailhook Association, a booster
organization of Navy and Marine
Corps aviators, female officers and
other women alleged they had been
molested during drunken debauch
ery in a Las Vegas hotel hallway.
In a ruling last week, a Navy
judge accused Kelso of witnessing

sexual misconduct at the convention
and with interfering in the subse
quent investigation.
But Perry said the Pentagon's
inspector general "found no credible
evidence" that Kelso had specific
knowledge of the sexual misconduct
and found "no evidence" that Kelso
sought to thwart investigations into
the scandal.
Perry has recommended to Presi
dent Clinton that he nominate
Kelso for retirement at his full four
star rank and"the president has
indicated his intention to make that
recommendation to the Senate,"
Pentagon spokesman Dennis Boxx
said yesterday evening. Senior level
military officers of Kelso's rank
serve at the pleasure of the presi
dent and must be confirmed by the
Senate.
Kelso could have demanded a for
mal military court of inquiry to try
to clear his name, but the process
would have taken months. Instead,
the admiral said he would bring his
37-year naval career to a close
slightly earlier than he had
announced.
The former submariner survived
an attempt by Dalton to fire him last
fall when that decision was over

ruled by then-Defense Secretary Les
Aspin.
Adm. Jeremy M. Boorda, the
four-star admiral in charge of
NATO's operation in Bosnia, has
been recommended to President
Clinton as the top candidate to
replace Kelso, Pentagon sources
said.
Pentagon spokeswoman Kathleen
deLaski said a replacement was
expected to be named soon.
Some members of Congress were
not appeased by Kelso's action.
Fourteen congresswomen, led by
Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.,
signed a letter to House Armed Ser
vices Committee Chairman Ronald
Dellums, D-Calif., urging "immedi
ate review and action" of the Navy's
Tailhook investigation.
The lawmakers said sexual
harassment at military service
academies and other sectors of the
military show Tailhook was not an
isolated incident.
Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.,
the ranking Republican on the Sen
ate Armed Services Committee, said
the admiral "deserves the thanks
and well wishes of all Americans"
and had served the country with dis
tinction.

"I've made the decision to request
retirement and I'm ready to go on,"
Kelso said.
The admiral said he had become a
target for criticism because he was
the senior naval officer attending
the aviators' convention in Las
Vegas. "I felt responsible for it. I
wish we had been able to be smart
enough to see it and to never let it
happen. I can only address what has
occurred and get on with it. My
responsibility as a leader is to do the
right thing and try to fix the prob
lem," he said.
"I think this is the end of Tail
hook," he added.
Meanwhile yesterday, senior Pen
tagon officials they are looking into
the circumstances surrounding
Navy Lt. Paula Coughlin's resigna
tion from the Navy in order to "have
a good understanding of the reasons
she submitted her resignation."
Coughlin, whose complaint about
an assault launched the investiga
tion, announced last week that she
was resigning her commission as of
July 1.
She said the assault "and the
covert and overt attacks on me that
followed have stripped me of my
ability to serve."
