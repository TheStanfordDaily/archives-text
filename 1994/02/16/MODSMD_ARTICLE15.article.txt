						Paramount victory: Viacom beats out QVC
## Five-month takeover battle will cost Viacom billions more than originally expected 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Viacom clinched a hard
fought victory yesterday for Paramount Communi
cations, sending rival suitor QVC Network into
defeat after a five-month takeover brawl.
But Viacom Inc., a cable channel operator, now
faces more problems — running the huge entertain
ment and publishing company while completing a
planned merger with video retailer Blockbuster
Entertainment Corp.
The victory for Viacom was a significant per
sonal achievement for its steely chairman, Sumn
er Redstone, who vowed from the outset that this
corporate marriage would "never be torn asun
der."
He defeated a tenacious Barry Diller, who once
ran Paramount Pictures and is resolved to build his
own interactive multimedia empire using QVC, a

cable shopping channel, as his base.
Viacom's victory came at great cost. It will have
to borrow billions more than originally planned to
buy Paramount, which owns a film studio, Simon
& Schuster books, Madison Square Garden, the
New York Knicks and the New York Rangers.
Paramount Communications Inc. and Viacom
agreed in September on an $8.2 billion cash and
stock merger including about $1.1 billion in cash.
The final price is about $10 billion in cash and stock
including $6.6 billion in cash.
Viacom, owner of MTV, Showtime and Nick
elodeon and other cable channels, said nearly 91.7
million Paramount shares, or about 74.6 percent of
the total, were tendered as of midnight under terms
of its buyout offer.
QVC Network Inc. said its bid attracted only 10.4

million shares and it dropped its tender offer in com
pliance with bidding rules.
Viacom will keep its tender offer open until
March 2 so those who tendered to QVC can resubmit
their shares to Viacom.
Martin Davis, chairman and chief executive of
Paramount, said the board "has obtained the best
value for shareholders under bidding procedures
that have operated smoothly and have effectively
provided stockholders with a meaningful choice
between two impressive proposals."
Analysts say Viacom faces a daunting task of
reversing the recent disappointing performance of
Paramount's moviemaking division and with get
ting management to refocus after the distraction of
watching a bidding war that started just after Labor
Day stretch into the new year.
