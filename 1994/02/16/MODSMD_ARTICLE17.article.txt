## Editorial Legal maneuvering University should make sure that reforms don't lower quality of services 
### 
THE FIRST thing we do, let's
kill all the lawyers." This is a
quick suggestion from Shake
speare's "Henry VI" on how to
undermine a town's infrastructure.
And yet, the University may be
doing just that when it reforms
how it obtains legal services. In
Stanford's case, though, the
lawyers' lives will be spared. It is
only their jobs and years of exper
tise and dedication that may be sac
rificed in hopes of saving money.
However, the potential outcome
could be just as dire.
Currently under consideration
are three proposals to restructure
the University's Legal Office in an
effort to cut costs while also gaining
more outside expertise. The Univer
sity may contract out all of its legal
work, contract out only part of it, or
obtain "back-up consulting" ser
vices from outside firms.
The University Legal Office now
employs 16 attorneys, while the
largest legal office in the Ivy
League — Harvard's — employs
just 10. However, Stanford's office,
according to one justification,
serves a much larger area than
other schools do.
By now Stanford must certainly
have considered the trade-offs
between retaining a sizable legal
office of its own and relying on out
side lawyers to handle its litigation.
Going to the outside may bring
in more expertise in special areas,
as well as purge the University of
its haunting indirect-cost-related
past. It may also reduce expens
es. Keeping the legal work within
the University may mean fewer
cost savings, but will ensure a
level of expertise based on years
of work.
No one will know whether there
will be significant cost savings from
downsizing the Legal Office and

contracting out work until a few
years down the line.
At best, the restructuring of the
Legal Office may save money. At
worst, it may not save anything and
may instead severely cripple the
University's legal resources.
It may also undermine the trust
of University employees in other
departments. They have now heard
the words that no one dared to
utter before: "The fact that people
have been here for a long time is
not a factor .... We have to look at
what's in the best interests of the
institution."
While this statement made by
General Counsel Michael Roster
may have been specific to the Legal
Office, it casts doubts on the larger
picture of administrative restruc
turing.
Is this callous indifference an
anomaly from the rest of the Uni
versity's talk on restructuring,
which is always well-cushioned
with regret and reassurance, or is it
indicative of the administration's
true sentiment? Certainly, these
words are a clear departure from
Provost Condoleezza Rice's talks,
town meetings and question-and
answer sessions on budget cuts, in
which she has never failed to
express empathy toward the Uni
versity community.
What the Legal Office is doing is
not necessarily a bad thing. Cre
ative restructuring in tough finan
cial times may be justified and even
necessary to thrive. But the office
needs to remember that while expe
rience and dedication can be gam
bled away overnight, it takes much
longer to build up these beneficial
characteristics.
The Legal Office, along with the
rest of the University, needs to
move cautiously in the restructuring
process, especially when the net
costs and benefits are so unclear. It
should reconsider the worth of
human capital, and remind itself
that sometimes even draconian mea
sures won't yield the desired results.
And the same question will
remain when all this is over: Was it
worth it?
