## London's Bobbitt Observer 
### 
I REMEMBER the first time I watched
television news here in England. The
segment on U.S. news was headlined
by the latest developments in the Michael
Jackson trial (complete with an in-con
cert crotch-grabbing clip), President
Clinton getting hit in the face by a foot
ball and the whole Nancy Kerrigan-
Tonya Harding deal.
And we wonder why the British have
such warped perceptions of America —
although, in all fairness, we could hardly
absolve the royal-family and Parliament
scandal-obsessed American media from
doing the same to England. Having
acknowledged as much, I will now take
my liberty in critiquing the British media.
I was just getting used to nightly
updates on Michael Jackson on the
evening news when I opened to the World
News section of The Observer, only to
stumble upon a full-page account of the
"gripping" moral dilemma, the "raging"
debate that has "divided" America.
Imagine my dismay to see Lorena Bob
bitt's face plastered over the headline,
"Cut that divides a nation."
It gets worse: "Emasculation or eman
cipation? America lies divided this week
end on the morality of the now infamous
Bobbitt case, waiting for Tuesday's ver
dict on whether Lorena Bobbitt was tem
porarily insane when she severed her
husband's penis with a kitchen knife."
So maybe The Observer can fairly
claim that America is "sordidly fascinat
ed" with this marital dispute that makes

the Charles and Di separation look tame,
but somehow I just don't see a nation
"taking sides," waging the Bobbitt Civil
War, as it waits "glued to live court TV"
for the verdict. (Now if there was a
Michael Jackson trial . . . .)
But even worse: What happens when a
country that doesn't quite understand
American feminism — in spite of Mar
garet Thatcher, who is actually a man in
drag, I've been told by more than one
English person — decides to philosophize
on the Bobbitts?
Suffice it to say hundreds of thou
sands of British newspaper readers have
just read that in the States — that crazy,
radical place it is — Lorena Bobbitt has
achieved the status of "feminine folk
hero."
It's "Thelma and Louise time for
American women" as the crazed female
masses pour out into the streets, gaining
another "burst of feminist energy," rid
ing from the angry momentum of the
Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings
and the lack of female politicians, The
Observer's overseas correspondent
writes.
Comedienne Kate Clinton's New
Year's Eve benefit bash for Lorena Bob
bitt, at which "she served 'Slice' brand
soft drinks and cocktail sausages" is cited
as an indicator of the castration frenzy
that has suddenly gripped American
women. No joke.
So, where in the States, the curious
British reader must ask, are the most

radical of the radicals and what are they
doing about all this?
"In San Francisco, the fringes of the
movement headed out on to the streets
with 'Lorena was right!' posters, and
gave the victory sign, adding a scissor
motion for good measure."
And just think how close Stanford is to
that bastion of rampant feminism — all
you men better pack you bags before
those Thelmas and Louises show up with
their machetes.
Well, at least The Observer stopped
short of portraying it that extremely,
ending the lengthy article with a conces
sion of sorts — "feminist" author Judith
Levine's speculation that "she did not
expect to see hordes of women roaming
on the streets with butcher's knives."
Phew. Thank God. Maybe there is hope
yet for those crazy Americans.
Enough said. In the end, all we can do
is get a good laugh out of the whole thing
and never underestimate the cross-cul
tural power of tabloid news. It's almost
comforting to know that Americans were
probably not the only ones who flocked to
supermarket shelves last year to catch a
glimpse of Fergie's nipples.

Angle would just like to say, "See, Tish,
you 're not the only columnist who can use
the word 'nipples" And she can even say
it all the way from Oxford.
