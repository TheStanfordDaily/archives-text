# Bosnia panel sparks audience outburst
## American, Bosnian and Serbian perspectives lead to heated program 
### Charles Katz Staff writer 
As audience members angrily shouted
their partisan viewpoints, three officials
representing American, Bosnian and
Serbian perspectives kicked off a nation
al campaign to help the people of Bosnia-
Herzegovina last night.
Even the informational video shown
at the beginning of the program sparked
unrest in the audience of 300 students
and community members in Memorial
Auditorium.
While pictures showing the horrors of
Serbian concentration camps leveled
against Bosnians, especially Muslims,
were displayed, some audience members

shouted "lies," while others cringed in
horror and told the other audience mem
bers to "shut up."
Co-sponsored by a number of campus,
local and national organizations, includ
ing Students Against Genocide and the
B'nai B'rith Hillel, the program was de
signed to begin a fund-raising and letter
writing campaign for BosniAid at more
than 200 college campuses.
The speakers also elicited divided and
unrestrained debate among audience
members, and, by the end of the evening,
the entire audience was vocal and rest
less. SAGE leader Brad Blitz had to re
peatedly remind the audience to be quiet,
and he also pointed to the three police of
ficers standing in the back of the audito

rium to ensure the peace.
Stephen Walker, a former State De
partment official who resigned in protest
of the U.S. policy in Bosnia, said the
United States should encourage the
United Nations to lift the arms embargo
leveled against Bosnia because "once
Bosnia got its independence, [it gained!
inalienable rights to defend itself accord
ing to the UN constitution" and fight the
Serbian aggression.
Walker, who is now the executive di
rector of the American Committee to
Save Bosnia, suggested that the United
States is partly to blame for the atrocities
that are going on in Bosnia. "The bottom
line is genocide is taking place
because ... of the arms embar
go." He explained that because of
the American government's
actions, "we're complicit in the
crimes."
Sven Alkalaj, the charge
d'affaires of the Bosnian Embassy
to the United States, described in
great detail many of the atrocities
that have occurred in his country
at the hands of the Serbian forces.
Speaking of the concentration
camps set up by the Serbians, he
said, "People were tortured, dis
membered and killed. Guards
pour acid on the fresh wounds of
the prisoners and laugh."
Alkalaj noted the use of rape of
Bosnian women by Serbian forces

as an instrument for perpetuating
fear. He also emphasized that the
war in Bosnia is "not a civil
war. . . . It's a case of aggression
and genocide on the part of the
Serbian government."
He asked, among other things,
for immediate air strikes of Ser
bian artillery sights. "This kind of
appeasement [is reminiscent] of
the appeasement of Nazi Ger
many," Alkalaj said.
Stojan Cerovic, a Serbian and
President of the Belgrade-based
Anti-War Action Center, called
for peace among the multi-ethnic
Bosnian community. "They're
only called Muslims, Croats and
Serbs because someone gave them
uniforms," said Cerovic, who is
currently a fellow at Harvard
University.
Cerovic explained that the war
did not start spontaneously, say
ing it was planned by the current

Serbian government. He said the
United Nations should not be try
ing to make peace with those who
started the war. "Those who
make war . . . cannot make
peace," he said.
Cerovic also disputed the
notion that the war is caused by
ancient racial hatred. "The hatred
was created by the war, not the
other way around," he said.
After the speakers' presenta
tions, time was allotted for audi
ence questions. Shortly after
wards, the order began to break
down.
Many questions were raised as
to the source of the apparent
genocide. The answers were
remarkably similar from all three
sides. Walker echoed the panels'
idea that the war is not a war of
ethnic hatred, but rather "a war
of aggression planned by the Bel
grade government."

Walker also said the American
policy in former Yugoslavia has
been a "failure," noting the
250,000 dead and the three mil
lion refugees. "We look like fail
ures because we are failures."
The meeting concluded with
many unanswered questions.
There were approximately 150
questions written down and sub
mitted to the panel of which only
about five were answered.
The plethora of unrepresented
questions and viewpoints caused
the audience to erupt in anger, as
many people said the panel did
not address the atrocities that the
Bosnians and Croatians are com
mitting against the Serbians.
Walker responded to the audi
ence's reaction by saying although
all sides are committing atrocities,
"the Serb aggression is the root of
the conflict — that's how it all
started."
