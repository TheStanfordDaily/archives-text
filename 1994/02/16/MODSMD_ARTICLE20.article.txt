## Colleges need to improve counseling, communication 
### 
HIGHER EDUCATION in Ameri
ca reminds me of an old Sid Cae
sar routine. Sid plays a common
house fly buzzing around a kitchen.
Suddenly the homeowner enters, and
Sid decides to take refuge on a raisin
cake where he won't be noticed.
"Hey, you're not a raisin," he says,
looking up. Then he looks carefully
around. "And you're not a raisin, and
he isn't a raisin. Hey, this isn't a raisin
cake."
In our investigation of higher educa
tion we're looking for raisins. If raisins
belong in a raisin cake, then educators
belong in higher education.
An educator is someone who accepts
a professional duty to educate someone
else. An educator has a trust responsi
bility with no divided loyalties. An
educator doesn't try to serve a client
and someone else with conflicting
interests at the same time. An educa
tor isn't an agent of society. An educa
tor is entitled to make a living, but is
not permitted to exploit his or her
clients — that is to say, the ethics of
the marketplace are not applicable to
an educator.
An educator has a trust relationship
with a client and adheres to the highest
degree of honor, honesty, and good
faith. An educator has no conflicts of
interest. An educator doesn't conceal
any information from a client, doesn't

give partial information, and doesn't
try to teach what is not the best inter
est? of the client to learn.
An educator never says, "What's
best for me and for my client." An edu
cator treats the client like a plant that
must grow according to its own nature
and never forces a client to follow a
predefined role or be a clone of the
educator. An educator never encour
ages a client to grow up too fast or
remain dependent too long. An educa
tor never harms clients or betrays
their interest. An educator cares about
the whole personality of a client — the
feelings and emotional growth of a
client, as well as their intellectual
growth.
In defining an educator I'm not try
ing to create a perfect person or even an
outstanding person, only a professional
who has a sense of responsibility and
ethics with respect to a client that a
doctor, lawyer or priest has.
The university system is called
"higher education" because it is the
summit of the educational hierarchy.
Certainly its central function is to edu
cate students. An institution that does
not have educators cannot be called an
educational institution.
A teacher can be an educator, but in
the modern university most aren't.
Their primary allegiance is to their
research discipline, for that controls

their professional career. If they don't
do research, they won't win tenure.
Moreover, university faculty play the
role of trainers in the same sense of
getting animals to perform a certain
way.
Similarly, university administrators
place their goals and ambitions ahead
of students. Do they want a bigger and
more financially-sound university?
They then stuff as many students as
they can into overcrowded dorms and
mass lecture halls.
Faculty and administrators in the
university are not acting in the stu
dents' best interest — although they
may be benefiting some students. After
all, the farmer may be solicitous of the
health and welfare of his prize bulls,
but he is raising them for slaughter,
not because he loves them.
There are at least two areas where
educators are badly needed in the mod
ern university. The first is academic
counseling, a notoriously underfunded
and ignored area in higher education.
Large universities are confusing and
disorienting environments. Students
need good academic counselors who will
guide them in their intellectual develop
ment as well as keeping a look out for
their emotional needs. For example,
ambitious parents may push their kid
into the wrong field. The wise academic
counselor would gently ease the student

into his or her true vocation.
The second area where educators are
needed is to act as agents representing
students in tenure review committees,
budget hearings, and curriculum dis
cussions. Too often the university is
tailored to the needs of administrative
conveniences, or defers to powerful
departments and entrenched interests.
No one represents students, and stu
dents are routinely kept out of universi
ty governance on the basis of their
naivete and inexperience. Yet making
major decisions affecting students with
out having qualified agents represent
ing them is rather like letting students
engage in a giant lawsuit and denying
them counsel.
Somehow higher education has built
up the conceit that it is wonderful with
out realizing how far it has truly drifted
away from its educational function. It
welcomes students, it takes their
money, and it promises them an educa
tion. But it doesn't have any educators
— just a lot of people who seem to
think that as long as they get theirs,
students should be happy.
Like Sid Caesar we can look around
us and say to the research faculty,
"You're not an educator." And we can
say to the administrator, "You're not
an educator." And we can say, "Hey,
this isn't an educational institution!"

cator treats the client like a plant that
must grow according to its own nature
and never forces a client to follow a
predefined role or be a clone of the
educator. An educator never encour
ages a client to grow up too fast or
remain dependent too long. An educa
tor never harms clients or betrays
their interest. An educator cares about
the whole personality of a client — the
feelings and emotional growth of a
client, as well as their intellectual
growth.
In defining an educator I'm not try
ing to create a perfect person or even an
outstanding person, only a professional
who has a sense of responsibility and
ethics with respect to a client that a
doctor, lawyer or priest has.
The university system is called
"higher education" because it is the
summit of the educational hierarchy.
Certainly its central function is to edu
cate students. An institution that does
not have educators cannot be called an
educational institution.
A teacher can be an educator, but in
the modern university most aren't.
Their primary allegiance is to their
research discipline, for that controls

their professional career. If they don't
do research, they won't win tenure.
Moreover, university faculty play the
role of trainers in the same sense of
getting animals to perform a certain
way.
Similarly, university administrators
place their goals and ambitions ahead
of students. Do they want a bigger and
more financially-sound university?
They then stuff as many students as
they can into overcrowded dorms and
mass lecture halls.
Faculty and administrators in the
university are not acting in the stu
dents' best interest — although they
may be benefiting some students. After
all, the farmer may be solicitous of the
health and welfare of his prize bulls,
but he is raising them for slaughter,
not because he loves them.
There are at least two areas where
educators are badly needed in the mod
ern university. The first is academic
counseling, a notoriously underfunded
and ignored area in higher education.
Large universities are confusing and
disorienting environments. Students
need good academic counselors who will
guide them in their intellectual develop
ment as well as keeping a look out for
their emotional needs. For example,
ambitious parents may push their kid
into the wrong field. The wise academic
counselor would gently ease the student

into his or her true vocation.
The second area where educators are
needed is to act as agents representing
students in tenure review committees,
budget hearings, and curriculum dis
cussions. Too often the university is
tailored to the needs of administrative
conveniences, or defers to powerful
departments and entrenched interests.
No one represents students, and stu
dents are routinely kept out of universi
ty governance on the basis of their
naivete and inexperience. Yet making
major decisions affecting students with
out having qualified agents represent
ing them is rather like letting students
engage in a giant lawsuit and denying
them counsel.
Somehow higher education has built
up the conceit that it is wonderful with
out realizing how far it has truly drifted
away from its educational function. It
welcomes students, it takes their
money, and it promises them an educa
tion. But it doesn't have any educators
— just a lot of people who seem to
think that as long as they get theirs,
students should be happy.
Like Sid Caesar we can look around
us and say to the research faculty,
"You're not an educator." And we can
say to the administrator, "You're not
an educator." And we can say, "Hey,
this isn't an educational institution!"
