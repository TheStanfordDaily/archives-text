# Three-year degree option would weaken education
## 
### 
While costs of a Stanford education
are certainly burdensome to non
upper-class families, and notwith
standing my respect for presidential
wisdom, I am not certain this institu
tion or any other American university
should encourage three-year degrees.

Some of us deplore Stanford's generos
ity in granting advanced placement
credits, the usual basis for these 20
percent of degrees obtained in three
years.
American high school education is
woefully inadequate compared with that
provided by the United States' main
first-world competitors. Many U.S. insti
tutions actually grant a full year of cred
its to European and Japanese students
in recognition of this gap. It is critical to

catch up in college — and in the main
American students to this well — and to
have time to catch up. The current poli
cy—to let graduate in three years those
students who can —seems more prudent
than creating the institutional option for
what will statistically turn out to be a
second-rate college education on top of,
on average, an already second-rate high
school education.
