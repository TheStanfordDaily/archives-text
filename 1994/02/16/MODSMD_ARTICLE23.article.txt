## Electric fields can damage membranes similar to cells Research may provide clues about effects on organisms 
### Julie Sauer Staff writer 
Stanford chemists have determined that electri
cal fields can disrupt membranes similar to those of
living cells, providing clues about how organisms
react to nearby sources of electricity.
Though the findings do not provide conclusive
evidence about the effects electrical fields generated
by power lines have on humans, Chemistry Prof.
Harden McConnell, who conducted the research,
said his experiments could provide a model for
future investigations into possible health hazards.
McConnell, along with postdoctoral fellows Ka
Yee C. Lee and Jurgen Klinger, is studying how spe
cific lipid films react to electric fields.
Because the experimental lipid films — called
Langmuir films — somewhat resemble living cell
membranes which are composed of lipid and protein
molecules they have been used historically as a
model for living organic membranes.
The researchers subjected the film to electrical
fields like those which power lines emit in weak
doses, but McConnell emphasized that the laborato
ry research was not intended to prove possible harm
ful effects of power lines on humans.
The experiments involved a membrane placed in
a covered dish, floating on the surface of water. A
wire was then run through a vertical tube in the
cover and attached to a power source and the pres
sure within the dish was varied.
Because electric fields vary with distance from a
wire, the effects of different levels of exposure could
be measured. In order to monitor the membrane's
condition, McConnell used a technique called fluo
rescent microscopy.
"If I had to make a bet, I'd bet that there is no sig
nificant effect of electromagnetic radiation on people

or animals at low levels," he said, adding that addi
tional research could provide conclusive evidence
one way or the other.
The lipid membrane composition of living cells is
carefully regulated by enzymes whose regulation
depends sensitively on growth temperature. For
example, animals and microorganisms that inhabit
cold environments contain an abundance of unsatu
rated fatty acids, like those found in the legs and feet
of Swedish reindeer.
Ten years ago in McConnell's lab, researchers
observed the onset of a phase separation — where
the uniformity of an organic membrane is disrupted
— at the growth temperature of cells. McConnell
described the relation between cell membrane stabil
ity and temperature.
"If you take bacteria and grow them at a high
temperature and measure the membrane properties,
you find that they start to phase separate at a high
temperature," he said. "If you grow [bacteria] at a
low temperature . . . you find that phase separation
takes place at a low temperature."
These results suggested to McConnell that cells
prefer to remain close to their phase separation tem
perature, allowing a membrane to be flexible and hold
intact the proteins that are imbedded in its lipid layers.
Because of their sensitivity to temperature, lipid
films can be more easily disrupted as they near the
temperature for phase separation. Near this temper
ature, the electrical fields disturb the membrane
considerably.
The electrical field affects cell membranes
because they consist of lipid and protein molecules
which contain unlike charges. The electrical forces
are able to separate the molecules by attracting and
repelling them according to their charges.
As a result, application of electric fields makes
membrane lipids nonuniform and causes proteins to

aggregate. Proteins that have been disrupted and
clustered provide a signal to trigger cell action, caus
ing the membrane proteins to activate and perform
their specific functions.
Disturbing the membrane in this manner may
cause killer cells to attack other cells in the sur
rounding area, a response similar to that which
makes asbestos a carcinogen.
When asbestos fibers enter the lung,
macrophages — these killer cells designed as one of
the body's lines of defense — recognize them as for
eign invaders and try to attack the asbestos but
instead kill the surrounding cells.
Though electrical fields have been shown to cause
membrane disturbances, protein aggregation and
increased possibility of killer-cell response, the effect
of long-term electrical field exposure on human cells

is uncertain.
McConnell hypothesized about possible harm to
humans from a field generated by power lines,
explaining that "over a long period of time I could
imagine that it might be deleterious. This is pure
speculation."
He started the membrane experiments to mea
sure very fundamental characteristics of lipid films,
including electrical properties and properties of fluid
mechanics. As a longer term goal, he also wanted to
discover the effect of electrical fields on proteins in
cell membranes.
The researchers are interested in using electrical
fields to manipulate membrane protein molecules.
They are also studying the process of cell-cell recog
nition, whereby cells recognize certain protein
molecules in the lipid membranes of other cells.
