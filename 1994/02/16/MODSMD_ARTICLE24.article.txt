Why are some things sticky?

A: Which things? I can think of why
particular things might be sticky,
Mr. Anonymous — especially if you have
noticed a decrease in your visual acuity
or unusual growths of hair on your
palms.
Eut certainly you didn't pose your
question out of a desire to have me pub
licly conjecture about your nastier pri
vate recreations. Rather, I assume, you
were motivated by a desire to learn a bit
about the physical chemistry of sticki
ness, or "adhesion."
Adhesion is the result of molecular
forces that act across the surface of con
tact between two substances and cause
the contacting surfaces to resist separa
tion.
The physical basis of adhesion forces
is in many cases anyone's guess. About
the only thing that stickiness
researchers agree about is the fact that
no single explanation is sufficient to
account for all adhesion phenomena.
One model that many lay people find
intuitively acceptable is the mechanical
theory of adhesion. Here, one imagines
a mechanical interlocking of compo
nents. For example, carpenters often
roughen wood with sandpaper before
gluing it; one might assume that this
introduction of irregularities to the sur
faces to be joined provides a way for the
glue to enter and "lock" with the wood.
Despite the ease with which one can
grasp such a concept, mechanical mod
els aren't really capable of adequately
explaining most adhesion. To really
understand what makes things stick,
you have to delve down to the molecular
level.
The motion of molecules across an
interface, called "diffusion," can some
times be responsible for adhesiveness.
Diffusion makes the largest contribu
tion to adhesion when the interface sep
arates two very similar (or identical)
substances. When the two surfaces
come in contact, the long polymeric
molecules that make up the adhesive
diffuse across the area of contact, blur
ring the interface and making separa
tion more difficult. The self-stickiness
of chewing gum is a familiar example of
diffusion-controlled adhesion.
Electrical forces can also play a part
in stickiness. When two pure metal sur
faces come in contact, one may want to
give up a few electrons to the other.
This transfer of negative charge results

in a net positive charge at the electron
donating surface, and a surplus of nega
tive charge at the accepting surface.
Since positive and negative charges
attract, the two surfaces will stick.
Electrostatic forces play a big role in
adhesion between metals, but when it
comes to the organic polymer molecules
that make up the adhesives in tape, glue
and Post-Its™, other intermolecular
forces take control.
The most significant of these are the
so-called van der Waal's forces, once
thought to be a consequence of the elec
trostatic attraction that resulted from
synchronizing the movements of elec
trons in neighboring molecules, but now
believed to be a quantum-mechanical
phenomenon.
Individually, van der Waal's forces
are extremely weak, but they are easy to
come by and fairly nonspecific. Added
up over a long molecule, their effects
can dominate those of other factors and
produce adhesion.
In epoxy glues, chemical bonds actu
ally form between the adhesive and its
substrate (usually paper or wood).
Adhesion that depends on chemical
bond formation is more or less irre
versible: Once the bonds are formed,
any amount of stress applied at the
interface is no more likely to rupture
the adhesive bond than it is to break
bonds within the original material.
Intermolecular forces — whether
van der Waal's or bonding in nature —
will result in adhesion only if the
molecules of the adhesive can contact
the substrate's surface in a special way
known technically (I'm serious) as "wet
ting."
Wetting occurs when the so-called
"cohesive" forces between molecules of
a would-be glue are weaker than the
adhesive forces between these
molecules and the substrate. If the
cohesive forces are too strong, then the
glue will just sit on the surface, like a
bead of water on a newly waxed car.
When these forces are strong
enough, however, the glue will "wet"
the surface, spreading out to form a
thin, tacky layer. Due to the strong
intermolecular forces, the glue
molecules will then penetrate the inter
facial surface to maximize the energetic
benefits reaped from such interactions.
Wetting, spreading and penetration
— and you thought this stuff would be
boring.
