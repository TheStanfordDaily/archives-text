# Crick describes consciousness of sight
## Explains how brains view images, objects 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
It is not an obvious step to move from
researching the nature and structure of
DNA to psychological phenomena.
But Francis Crick, who along with
James Watson discovered in 1953 the
intricate double-helix structure of one of
the building blocks of life, has since
devoted his time to studying visual con
sciousness — how the brain receives and
interprets what we see.
"The basic question is how to explain
consciousness," he said in a lecture deliv
ered last Friday. "But whenever you tell
someone that this is your topic, they
always reply 'what is it?' "
Using slides to further explain his
points, Crick first contrasted organisms'
vision with the workings of a video cam
era and computer.
Because of the sheer amount of
information involved in sight and the
need to "identify" objects which we see,
he said that the brain must use a sys
tem which looks at an image as a whole
rather than the specific elements which
make it up.
In addition, Crick said the brain must
be able to keep up with images in real
time — interpreting what we see as soon
as we receive the information. This pro
cess is carried out by the large number of
neurons connecting the eye to the brain
which can act in parallel to relay the
images quickly.
With such complex tasks to perform,
he said it is surprising that "the brain is
not so large as to be unwieldy."
After introducing these questions, he
said his research has also delved into the

mechanisms within our minds which
interpret visual cues in addition to the
specific physiology behind sight.
Crick said significant advances have
been made in understanding how the
brain is able to distinguish the images fed
to it through the eyes, but he admitted
that "we are only beginning to understand
the answer to the question of how we see."
In attempting to garner such an
understanding, he believes different
forms of consciousness can be related to
each other. "I would make the basic

assumption that they . . . have some
thing in common," he said.
However, because of the complexities
involved in understanding the very nature
of thought, his research has instead
focused more on the ways in which the
brain accomplishes pattern recognition.
"A lot of experimental work has been
done on the specifics of the visual system
of man," he said, adding that "As of yet,
there has not been enough to know the
answer to the fundamental questions of
visual consciousness."
