# Scientists continue the search for genetic clues about cystic fibrosis
## 
### Kara Howland 
Cystic fibrosis, a genetically inherited
disease discovered only 55 years ago,
continues to claim lives despite the fact
that scientists have been successful in
describing its nature and activity.
According to Stanford researchers,
knowledge about the disease is continu
ally increasing.
The disease "affects the bodily func
tions in many ways," said Psychology
Prof. Jeffrey Wine, who has dedicated a
great deal of his time to the research of
the disease. "The lungs lose their ability
to maintain a sterile surface and are
gradually destroyed by ineradicable
colonies of bacteria."
Because the disease is genetic, in
order to inherit the trait a child must
inherit both recessive genes from the
parents. Only being carriers, the parents
exhibit no traits of the disease.
The disease affects the exocrine
organs — including the respiratory,
digestive, and reproductive tracts — to a
varying degree, so that if a child inherits
a mild form of the disease, he or she may
not even realize it until late in life or it
may not be detected at all.

Though mild forms may result in
infertility, asthma or chronic bronchitis,
some people inherit a form so severe that
they die within the first days of life.
Current methods for detecting this
disease before birth are inaccurate. This
is in part due to the high number of
mutations in this particular gene.
"The first description [of cystic fibro
sis] in the English language was by
Dorothy Anderson in 1938," said Phylis
Gardner, an assistant professor at the
School of Medicine. Anderson found the
gene while studying children with mal
absorption syndrome, which leads to
malnourishment. Because autopsies of
the pancreas found it to be abnormal, she
called it cystic fibrosis of the pancreas.
A doctor treating Anderson's patients
realized that there was some reason that
they were particularly prone to dehydra
tion by measuring the electrolytes in
their sweat.
Because the sodium and chloride con
tent in the patients' sweat was elevated
above the normal level, doctors suggested
that this was not just a disease of the pan
creas but in fact a disease of other organs.
In addition, these increased levels
now make up an integral part of the tests

used to detect the disease's presence.
Gardner explained the toll the disease
takes on the pancreas, saying that "the
pancreas is affected because the duct
that secretes [the] digestive enzyme gets
a thick mucus in it.
"Since the enzyme can't go forward, it
goes backwards," she said. It then effec
tively digests the pancreas.
In the lungs, the mucus promotes the
growth of bacteria, which can result in
pneumonia and other infections.
In the intestines the major complica
tions can occur at birth where some new
borns have problems with bowel obstruc
tions which may result in death.
By the 1980s the life expectancy for
people afflicted with the disease had
risen into the twenties, and in 1989, sci
entists cloned the gene which causes cys
tic fibrosis.
According to Wine, the best way to
learn how to treat the disease is through
animal studies and experimentation.
"There is a mouse model for cystic fibro
sis," he said.
However, because key differences
exist between the symptoms experienced
by humans and mice, this research will
not necessarily result in a cure.
