# Unbeaten tennis stomps on Rebels

### Hob Ross Senior staff writer 
UNLV's head coach Ola
Malmquist best summed up yes
terday's women's tennis dual
meet:
"We were pretty much out
classed by Stanford," he said
after his Running Rebels (3-1)
fell 9-0 at Stanford Tennis Stadi
um. "They might have the best
team in the country."
Stanford head coach Frank
Brennan was equally straight
forward about his team's domi
nation. "I was very happy with
this match," he said. "This was
one of the best dual matches
Stanford has played in a couple
years. We played a team of high
quality and walked right
through them. It was really a
wonderful match."
From the first serve, Stanford
(8-0) dominated. The tone was
set by senior captain Laxmi
Poruri, who smashed freshman
Marianne Vallin 6-2, 6-2 at No. 1
singles. Vallin, a baseline player
from Sweden, is just of! a strong
showing in the National Indoors
Tournament a couple weeks ago.
In that tournament, Vallin
defeated Jane Chi, a highly
ranked player from UCLA who
won the Pacific 10 Conference
Indoor Championships, before
losing in the semi-finals. But
Vallin had no such success
against Poruri, the top-ranked
player in the nation.
"She's a great player who
made me play badly," Vallin said.
"She was better today, but I
can't say I played well." Vallin
stressed the closeness of the
match, as she was unable to con
vert on game point five times.
"We had a couple close games
that could have turned things
around, but they went my way,"

Poruri said. "I think when she's
on it will be more difficult, but I
don't think she was on today."
Poruri then teamed with
freshman Katie Schlukebir to
knock off UNLV's No. 1 doubles
team of Vallin/Rachel Clark 6-0,
6-2.
"They were just too good,"
said Clark. "There's just nothing
you can do."
Clark had the same reaction
when describing her match at
No. 5 singles against Cardinal
senior Emma Woodhouse, which
Woodhouse won 6-0, 6-0.
"She was just better than
me," Clark said. "I wasn't just
blown away, but when the game
got close she had that extra
whatever-it-took to win."
Woodhouse's serving was
part of that "whatever-it-took."
"I think the main thing was
that I was serving really well
today," Woodhouse said. "That
gave me some free points."
Woodhouse continued serving
well in her doubles match, where
she and her partner Beth Berris
won 6-2, 6-2 over UNLV's Shiera
Stuart and Janelle Barr. This
Cardinal senior/sophomore pair
is undefeated at No. 3 doubles.
Stanford's No. 2 doubles
team, on the other hand, has
been struggling. The duo of
senior Kristine Kurth and fresh
man Emily Burt most recently
dropped a two-set match to a duo
from the University of California
at San Diego on Friday. Yester
day, the team reversed their for
tunes somewhat by winning a
tough match over Becky
Markosian and Ljiljana Kordic 7-
5, 7-5.
In both sets of this time-con
suming match, Stanford was up
5-3. But with strong returns and
