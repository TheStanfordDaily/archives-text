## Synchro coaches find deGuerre love In their 15th year, Weir and Maisel lead the team they founded together

Does love spring eternal in the depths of
deGuerre pool?
Fifteen years ago, reserve water polo goalie
Andy Maisel was lifeguarding at a Stanford
swimming hole when he noticed a visitor who,
he relates, "would come and swim in the morn
ings. It was obvious that she was a swimmer,
especially compared to most of the people who
come to the pool." The two struck up a conver
sation, in which "she mentioned that she was a
synchronized swimmer, but it didn't sink in just
then."
Later, Maisel met a student who wanted to
start a synchronized swimming team at Stan
ford but needed a faculty or staff sponsor. "I
said that I knew someone who might be inter
ested," recalls Maisel. "I gave [the woman
whom I had met earlier] a call, and then we
started to go out."
That "someone" whom Maisel called was
Vickey Weir, now in her 15th year as Stanford's
synchronized swimming coach and 11th year as
the wife of Maisel, the assistant coach.
Those 15 years have seen 13 top-five finishes
in the NCAA Championships, seven consecutive
second-place showings, and the birth of a
daughter, Sabrina, now three.
Although she and Maisel hit it off immedi
ately, Weir, who since 1976 has served as a
teacher and nursing instructor at the Stanford
Hospital, was more recalcitrant about re
immersing herself in a sport she had left behind
three years before.
Maisel relates, "Her first reaction when she
found out that there was a student who wanted
her to help start a team was, 'Heck, no.' But
then they got her to work one day a week, then
two .... "
Moreover, the nascent team did not exactly
have the committed support of the Department
of Athletics. "We were told at the time by the
Athletics Department that there was no way
we'd be successful, and that we'd never be a var

sity sport. I believed the second part for a long
time," Maisel says.
Yet Weir, Maisel and the team quickly proved
their doubters wrong. Beginning their work in
the January of 1979, the squad improved rapid
ly enough to finish fifth in the nation in the
1980 U.S. Collegiate National Championships.
Since then, the Stanford synchronized swim
ming team has been one of the Farm's most
unqualified — and unheralded — success sto
ries. In addition to the squad's string of com
petitive titles, the team was granted varsity sta
tus this season, boosting hopes that the squad
will finally topple perpetual national champion
Ohio State.
These results clearly satisfy both Weir and

Maisel; yet both coaches take even more pride in
their close relationships with their swimmers.
"The [synchronized] swimming team was
always been an extended part of our family, in
that we look after them and care about them,"
says Weir.
Perhaps part of the squad's success arises
from Weir's ability to translate her classroom
teaching abilities to the waters of deGuerre
pool. "Basically, coaching and working at the
hospital are similar in that they're both teach
ing positions," says Weir.
The couple's lives away from the nation's
natatoriums are as fascinating as their on-Farm

activities. Weir, who hails from
Dayton, Ohio, began swimming at
the age of eight, then earned her
undergraduate degree at Ohio
State. She worked her way
through college in jobs including a
stint as a dolphin accompanist
with her sister's circus troupe as it
traveled throughout South Ameri
ca.
Dolphin accompanist?
"Well, yes," says Weir. "I would
swim synchro routines alongside
dolphins."
Maisel, on the other hand, had a
more traditional, albeit well
rounded, collegiate and post-grad
uate career, graduating from Stan
ford in 1978, then attending Har
vard Business School and return
ing to the Bay Area in 1983. Later
that same year, he and Weir were
married.
The couple manages to keep

their coaching and married lives
separate, with Weir unequivocally
the boss in the former role. "We
discuss things concerning the
team, but ultimately I get the final
call (in all synchro decisions)," says
Weir. "But we usually see eye-to
eye."
This division of powers is abet
ted by the distinct roles which
Weir and Maisel each play in the
synchro program. "Andy takes
care of the recruiting, conditioning
and the music cutting; I handle the
training, the exercises and other
technical (in-pool) activities," adds
Weir.
Indeed, it is easy to see — both
in the pool and out — that the pair
gets along swimmingly.
"I don't think that our relation
ship evolved because of synchro,"
says Maisel. "I think it developed
in spite of synchro."
Does love spring eternal in the
depths of deGuerre pool? The
answer is as clear as the waters in
which Vickey Weir and Andy
Maisel first met.

started to go out."
That "someone" whom Maisel called was
Vickey Weir, now in her 15th year as Stanford's
synchronized swimming coach and 11th year as
the wife of Maisel, the assistant coach.
Those 15 years have seen 13 top-five finishes
in the NCAA Championships, seven consecutive
second-place showings, and the birth of a
daughter, Sabrina, now three.
Although she and Maisel hit it off immedi
ately, Weir, who since 1976 has served as a
teacher and nursing instructor at the Stanford
Hospital, was more recalcitrant about re
immersing herself in a sport she had left behind
three years before.
Maisel relates, "Her first reaction when she
found out that there was a student who wanted
her to help start a team was, 'Heck, no.' But
then they got her to work one day a week, then
two .... "
Moreover, the nascent team did not exactly
have the committed support of the Department
of Athletics. "We were told at the time by the
Athletics Department that there was no way
we'd be successful, and that we'd never be a var

sity sport. I believed the second part for a long
time," Maisel says.
Yet Weir, Maisel and the team quickly proved
their doubters wrong. Beginning their work in
the January of 1979, the squad improved rapid
ly enough to finish fifth in the nation in the
1980 U.S. Collegiate National Championships.
Since then, the Stanford synchronized swim
ming team has been one of the Farm's most
unqualified — and unheralded — success sto
ries. In addition to the squad's string of com
petitive titles, the team was granted varsity sta
tus this season, boosting hopes that the squad
will finally topple perpetual national champion
Ohio State.
These results clearly satisfy both Weir and

Maisel; yet both coaches take even more pride in
their close relationships with their swimmers.
"The [synchronized] swimming team was
always been an extended part of our family, in
that we look after them and care about them,"
says Weir.
Perhaps part of the squad's success arises
from Weir's ability to translate her classroom
teaching abilities to the waters of deGuerre
pool. "Basically, coaching and working at the
hospital are similar in that they're both teach
ing positions," says Weir.
The couple's lives away from the nation's
natatoriums are as fascinating as their on-Farm

Synchro coaches Vickey Weir and Andy Maisel pose on the deGuerre deck where their
partnership began.
activities. Weir, who hails from
Dayton, Ohio, began swimming at
the age of eight, then earned her
undergraduate degree at Ohio
State. She worked her way
through college in jobs including a
stint as a dolphin accompanist
with her sister's circus troupe as it
traveled throughout South Ameri
ca.
Dolphin accompanist?
"Well, yes," says Weir. "I would
swim synchro routines alongside
dolphins."
Maisel, on the other hand, had a
more traditional, albeit well
rounded, collegiate and post-grad
uate career, graduating from Stan
ford in 1978, then attending Har
vard Business School and return
ing to the Bay Area in 1983. Later
that same year, he and Weir were
married.
The couple manages to keep

their coaching and married lives
separate, with Weir unequivocally
the boss in the former role. "We
discuss things concerning the
team, but ultimately I get the final
call (in all synchro decisions)," says
Weir. "But we usually see eye-to
eye."
This division of powers is abet
ted by the distinct roles which
Weir and Maisel each play in the
synchro program. "Andy takes
care of the recruiting, conditioning
and the music cutting; I handle the
training, the exercises and other
technical (in-pool) activities," adds
Weir.
Indeed, it is easy to see — both
in the pool and out — that the pair
gets along swimmingly.
"I don't think that our relation
ship evolved because of synchro,"
says Maisel. "I think it developed
in spite of synchro."
Does love spring eternal in the
depths of deGuerre pool? The
answer is as clear as the waters in
which Vickey Weir and Andy
Maisel first met.
