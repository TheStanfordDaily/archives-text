# Reflections of a boarder
## Learning to shred can be a painful process 
### 
IMUST admit, I was a skier in the
beginning. Long before the sport of
snowboarding became popular and the
slopes were mostly filled with downhillers,
I was among them.
My winter Saturdays during junior high
were spent riding up to the mountain on the
ski school bus and skiing along trails in
groups of about 20 noisy pre-teens. We actu
ally spent the majority of the day sitting in
the lodge drinking hot chocolate and gossip
ing about who was going out with who.
While those adventures were certainly
the highlight of my adolescent weekends,
when I got into high school I wanted to try
something new. That's when the lure of
The Board started to take hold.
I had, of course, seen snowboarders on
the slopes. In the time before the sport had
really caught on, almost all the boarders I
saw were grungish-looking teenage boys.
They traveled down the hill in packs,
pulling jumps in their baggy snow pants
and outlandish hats — this was not a
group I saw myself fitting in with.
Beyond the image, however, something
drew me in. Maybe it was the grace with
which these guys seemed to glide back and
forth in the snow. Maybe it was the
heights they achieved off the jumps.
Maybe it was that they seemed to be hav
ing such a good time. So I decided to give it
a shot — after all, what could it hurt?
My opportunity came the winter of my
junior year in high school. A friend of mine
was going up who had snowboarded a cou
ple of times and said she would teach me
the basics. I went through the rental
ordeal, much the same process as renting
skis. After I found a pair of boots that
more or less fit I was then told to stand
with my feet together and was pushed for
ward to determine if I was "regular" foot
or "goofy" foot. Since I had automatically
taken a step with my left foot, I was issued
a regular board.
With all the necessary gear, I was ready

to hit the slopes. Little did I know that my
entire first day would consist of just that.
My first challenge, after mastering the art
of hooking my boots into the bindings, was
to get off of the chairlift. Since snowboard-

ers need one foot unattached to maneuver
onto the chair, gliding down the get-off
ramp is not as simple as on skis.
While I tried to slide down the small hill,
one foot hooked in and the other positioned
on the board next to it, I quickly discovered
that staying upright was a momentous feat
in itself. I wound up hitting the snow with
in seconds of leaving the chair, employing a
rather interesting hopping/rolling motion
to get myself off to the side.
I used my roll-and-hop movement,
together with an equally impressive crawl
ing maneuver many times that day. I could
stand up all right, but it was the turning
thing that got me. Ideally, one rides a
snowboard like a skateboard with feet to
the side and body oriented forward. As a
beginner, however, my travel was limited
to two basic directions — across the hill
facing forwards or across the hill facing
backwards.
The angles at which I fell unfortunately
followed the same pattern, I either kissed
the snow or smacked down on my rear end.
During the first half of that day I spent 90
percent of my time in one of these two ori-
