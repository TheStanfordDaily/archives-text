# Students discuss CIV, system
## Flexibility, structure debated 
### Sandy Lee Staff writer 
The current failures of the distribution require
ment system and possibilities for its restructuring
dominated the discussion at a town meeting held by
members of the Student Advisory Group on Under
graduate Education at Roble Hall last night.
The third open meeting held by the group this
quarter was attended by about 30 students, in addi
tion to three faculty members of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education and the three student
members of the commission's subcommittee on
breadth requirements.
Information from the student group's meetings
will be compiled for a report to be issued to the com
mission this spring as a way to include more student
input in the process of undergraduate education re
form.
The discussion on what role the DR system should
play and its mission became at times an active debate
on the contradictory merits of flexibility and struc
ture, giving students the opportunity to articulate
their views by drawing on personal experience.
Students centered their concerns regarding Cul
tures, Ideas and Values on the course's inability to ex
pose both Western and multicultural thought with
sufficient depth.
Though the majority of students said flexibility
should be the most significant consideration in re
vamping the DR system, the discussion was hardly
one-sided. Several students expressed strong opin
ions that the University needed to play a greater role
in structuring undergraduate education.
History Prof. James Sheehan, who serves as both
the commission chair and DR subcommittee chair,
said the subcommittee is slowly working its way to
ward alternate versions of the DR system.
"There should be some requirements encouraging
students to have a broad experience, but there's a
consensus that the way we do things now is not the
best possible," Sheehan said.
Senior Eddie Garcia, the advisory group's chair,
began the informal talk by asking what the DR sys
tem should accomplish. While several students sug
gested the possibility of a core curriculum to add
depth to their general education,
most students said the University
should not regulate students'
general education any further.
They felt that a structured core
curriculum would be too limiting,
leaving no room or time in their
schedules to expose themselves to
other areas.
Sheehan agreed that a
revamped DR system should not
include a core curriculum, saying
that Stanford's lack of a core tra
dition makes it nearly impossible
to establish one today.
Sophomore Jolie Dyl said a core
curriculum "would be duplicating
the problems with CIV — too
much and not getting anywhere."
Although many sentiments sug
gested a mutually exclusive rela
tionship between breadth and
depth, junior Luz Herrera, a com
mission member, said that a DR
system could have both flexibility
and substance. Such a reformed
system could have fewer DR areas
with an increased number of
requirements in each area, she said.
Sheehan said that in the

breadth-depth ratio, the current
system is weighted more heavily
toward breadth. He speculated
that the new system might have
only four required areas: writing
and critical thought, foreign lan
guage, quantitative skills and
CIV.
Although the need for some
change — whether it be adding
more depth to the current system
or redesigning it completely —
was a unanimous sentiment
among participants at the meet
ing, sophomore Laura Goodrich, a
subcommittee member, said "the
subcommittee is not trying to
make radical changes. We want to
change aspects that need to be
changed."
The most common concerns
raised by students are related to
the "incoherence" among CIV
tracks and the superficiality of
the DRs which are "taken just for
the sake of taking them," she
said.
The disparity in difficulty and
content among the CIV tracks, as
well as the failure of CIV as a
means of increasing exposure to
different ways of thinking, were
cited as ongoing problems by
freshman residents at the meet
ing.
