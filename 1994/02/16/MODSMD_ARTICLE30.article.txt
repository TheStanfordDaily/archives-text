## Men's volley pounds Tigers 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Swatting at paper Tigers, the Stanford men's
volleyball squad demolished the University of
Pacific (5-4 overall, 3-2 in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) last night to the tune of a 15-
11,15-6,15-9victoiy.
En route to perfecting a 5-0 league record, the
Cardinal played one of its most consistent
matches of the year. Powered by the return of
senior setter Canyon Ceman, Stanford pounded
out 74 kills against only 24 errors for a sparkling
.424 hitting percentage.
Despite those impressive statistics, Stanford
struggled early on before taking control of the
match. Falling behind 6-0 in the first game, the
Tigers jumped on several Cardinal passing and hit
ting errors before Stanford collected itself and rat
tled off a mini-rally to finally tie the score at 11-11.
A Joe Burghardt ace put Stanford ahead to
stay, and Ceman sealed the Tigers' fate with one
of his seven kills to end the match.
"We're a team that needs rhythm, and early
on we were trying to adjust to a new lineup," said
junior swing hitter Eric Wells. "After we found
our groove, we were confident that we'd win it."
Fielding a new look on the court last night,
head coach Ruben Nieves moved Burghardt back
to the middle blocking position and inserted Wells
as the passer. That move freed Mike Lambert
from passing duties, and the sophomore outside
hitter responded with a game-high 25 kills.
"We had a good passing match," Nieves said.
"This lineup gives Mike more opportunities to
hit, as well as giving us more defense and ball
control. We do give up a little on the block, but
overall there's more good than bad."
The Cardinal emphasized all the good parts
during the second game, as they jumped to a 6-0
lead and smothered the Tigers 15-6. Again,
Ceman tamed the Tigers with
another kill to end the game.
"After our slow start in the first
game it was our pride that pushed
ahead," Ceman said. "We knew
we're the better program, and we
knew that we have more individual
talent."
Despite the thrashing his Tigers
took at the expense of Stanford's
big hitters, UOP coach Joe Wort
mann still insisted that "Stanford
looks a little shaky for a top-five
team."
If there were any doubts in
Wortmann's mind, they should
have been erased with the Cardi
nal's performance during the final
game. Outhitting Pacific .571 to
.357, Stanford bombarded the
Tigers with a barrage of powerful
jump serves and kills before Pacific
finally fell 15-9.

"We wanted to beat them
badly," Lambert said. "Sometimes
our problem is inexperience, and
we tend to drag out our matches,
but tonight we wanted to put it
away in three, and we did just
that."
After shutting down the Tigers,
the Cardinal now turns its atten
tion to its Saturday match against
No. 3 Brigham Young. Perhaps the
toughest team to hit the Burnham
Pavilion parquet this season, BYU
is in position to challenge Stan
ford's perfect record.
However, despite the Cougars'
potential, the Cardinal will field a
stronger team than last night, as
freshman opposite hitter Matt
Fuerbringer will rejoin the starting
core after sitting out of the Pacific
match with a sprained ankle.
"If [Wortmann] thinks we're
shaky for a top-five team right now,
we'll just have to prove ourselves
against BYU," Nieves said. "If we
can handle BYU, then we definitely
know that we belong."
