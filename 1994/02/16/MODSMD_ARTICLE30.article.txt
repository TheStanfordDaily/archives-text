Swatting at paper Tigers, the Stanford men's
volleyball squad demolished the University of
Pacific (5-4 overall, 3-2 in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) last night to the tune of a 15-
11,15-6,15-9victoiy.
En route to perfecting a 5-0 league record, the
Cardinal played one of its most consistent

from passing duties, and the sophomore outside
hitter responded with a game-high 25 kills.
"We had a good passing match," Nieves said.
"This lineup gives Mike more opportunities to
hit, as well as giving us more defense and ball
control. We do give up a little on the block, but
overall there's more good than bad."
The Cardinal emphasized all the good parts
during the second game, as they jumped to a 6-0
lead and smothered the Tigers 15-6. Again,
