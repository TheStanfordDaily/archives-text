# Hornet bats sting baseball 7-0
## Cardinal lineup overpowered by Sacramento pitching 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
For the second straight day, a shutout was
thrown at Sunken Diamond yesterday. Unfortu
nately for the Stanford baseball team, however, the
opponent did the honors.
The Sacramento State Hornets blanked the Car
dinal 7-0, dropping Stanford's record to 7-5 on the
season and improving Sacramento State's to 3-2.
The maligned Hornet pitching staff, which had
given up 33 runs in its three previous games, limited
the Cardinal to only four hits and allowed only one
runner as far as third base.
The Cardinal fell behind early when the Hornets
put up four runs in the second inning. With two
outs, Stanford righthander Mark Williams had an 0-
2 count on Sacramento State third baseman Derek
Brown and looked poised to get out of the inning
unscathed. But Brown poked Williams' next pitch
into right field, giving the Hornets a 1-0 lead and
bringing freshman catcher Jason Quintel to the
plate. Quintel slammed Williams' first offering deep
into the pine trees in left, giving Sacramento State a

4-0 lead.
"Hitting [in the] nine [slot], I Iknew) that he
[was) going to be coming with the fastball on most of
the first pitches," Quintel said." So I was just look
ing fastball, and he gave it to me belt-high, and 1 hit
it."
Williams was replaced by freshman relief ace Tom
Reimers after five innings, but Sacramento State
continued its offensive onslaught with solo home
runs by second baseman Robert Perry in the seventh
inning and Brown in the eighth inning, both off
Reimers.
Stanford was unable to catch up against Hornet
freshman Matthew Myers, who surrendered only
two hits in six innings of work. Myers displayed
excellent control, walking no batters and getting
into few deep counts.
"[The Stanford batters] were really geared up to
hit the fastball," Myers said. "They're great hitters,
and we just got them on a good day. We were pitch
ing well and they just couldn't seem to hit it."

Too many wiffs and not enough dings led to a Cardinal defeat yesterday against Sacramento State.
State offense for his poise on the
mound.
"I knew we were going to score
a lot of runs today," Myers said.
"We've hit nine home runs now
in three games .... I felt real
comfortable out there and my
catcher did a great job."
A Cardinal offense that had
pounded out 11 hits and six runs
just a day before against
Wyoming was simply unable to

put key hits together and get into
sync offensively.
Stanford Coach Mark Mar
quess stressed that the Cardinal
needs more consistent scoring to
realistically compete in the tough
Pacific-10 Southern Division.
"Offensively, we're still not
doing a good enough job," Mar
quess said. "We need to pick that
up if we're going to hope to do
well in our league."
The Cardinal hopes to regain
its offensive firepower when it
travels to Hawaii to open a three
game series with the University
of Hawaii Rainbows on Friday.
