# Softball falls in season openers
## 
### Randy Reback 
Last weekend, the Stanford
Softball team underwent a prover
bial "baptism of fire," as the team
began its season with the Spartan
Kick-Off Tournament in San Jose.
Struggling to handle the heat of
opposing pitchers' fastballs, the
Cardinal lost a total of six games
against San Jose State, St. Mary's,
and Santa Clara.
Since Stanford's only scrim
mage and scheduled opener were
both rained out, the tournament
was the first time the team has
faced a real opponent. Most of the
young Cardinal lineup had never
come up against collegiate pitching.
The Cardinal offense got off to
a slow start Saturday, managing
only ten hits in three games
against its Bay Area opponents.
Freshman shortstop Summer Lee
was a bright spot in the Stanford
batting order, stroking four hits
on the day.
On the mound, freshmen start
ing pitchers Angela Webb and
Katie Beattie combined to allow
only four earned runs in the three
games. However, these strong
outings were marred by a defense
which committed nine errors. At
the end of the day, the Cardinal
posted losses to Santa Clara by a
score of 3-0, St. Mary's 2-0 and
San Jose State 8-0.
"We weren't ready the first
game, and it showed," said head
coach Sandy Pearce. "We made
errors and didn't do the little
things that we needed to, such as
hitting the cut-off and making the

routine plays. We need to get to
the point where we just react.
Right now we're thinking about
what we have to do."
The Cardinal offense showed
signs of improvement Sunday.
Sophomore catcher Lynn Ander
son, the team's captain, drove in
the first two runs of the season
with a first-inning triple against
Santa Clara.
"As a team, we're learning to be
more selective at the plate," said
third baseman Toni Morengo.
"Our eye improved from game to
game, but we also have to improve
on getting runners in during key
situations."
While the offense may have
improved, Stanford's pitching
proved less effective Sunday.
Showing signs of fatigue, the staff
yielded a total of twenty earned
runs during the three games.
Webb and Beattie continued to
move the ball around well, but had
simply been "overworked" accord
ing to Pearce. Stanford lost Sun
day to Santa Clara 9-2, St. Mary's
6-0 and San Jose State 16-0.
The Cardinal will have another
chance to rack up its first win
when it visits University of Cali
fornia at Davis for a double-head
er this afternoon. Webb is expect
ed to start the opener for the Car
dinal, while Beattie will take the
mound in the nightcap.
"We have a good chance going
in against UC-Davis," Pearce said.
"They have a good hitting team
that should challenge our pitch
ers. We'll be able to see how much
we took away from the weekend."
