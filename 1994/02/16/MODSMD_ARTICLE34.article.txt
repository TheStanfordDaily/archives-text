Sunlight streams
in through a sea-facing
picture window, waking

you from deep slumber
beneath a cozy down com
forter. The smell of fresh cof
fee and warm scones with
honey wafts up from the
kitchen. You rise to face the
splendor of the Pacific Ocean,

and another day of luxurious
living at a Bed and Breakfast.
If you've ever pictured your
self partaking in such Martha
Stewart-esque gracious living, a
trip to a Bed and Breakfast or
an Inn may be the getaway for

you. From Napa and Sonoma
Valleys, through San Francisco
and down to the beaches of
Cartnel and Monterey, the Bay
Area offers a wide variety of such
establishments.
Planning such a weekend
does, however, require some
advanced scheduling. The B&B
routine has a few complexities
that — while contributing to a sea
soned visitor's experience — may
surprise and even alarm the
unaware vacationer. Thinking
about these options ahead of time
will maximize your hard-earned
vacation time and money.
Your first step is to figure out
if you're looking for a B&B or an
Inn. While the line of distinction
is often blurry, a traditional B&B
will be far more homey and infor
mal than an inn. Guests generally
share one breakfast table, and are
more likely to get to know the
innkeepers themselves.
Inns tend to offer more
rooms, Filling the gap between
hotels and B&Bs. Often offering
both a complimentary breakfast
and an optional dinner, inns cater
to a crowd that enjoys the intima
cy of a smaller establishment with
out the inquisitive tendencies of
the make-new-friends B&B crowd.
Once you've made this deci
sion, you're best bet is checking
out a B&B guide, found in the
travel section of libraries and
bookstores. There are several,

ranging from " Hie Non-Smoker's
Guide to West Coast Bed and
Breakfasts" to the more general
national guide books. I'd recom
mend a California edition, as
these include smaller and more
inexpensive establishments along
with their famous counterparts.
One word of warning: many
B&Bs will be listed as "Kids
Welcome 45" or "B&B #214."
I bis simply means they belong to
a national organization; many o!
these are just houses with an extra
room. While one might not expe
rience the same level of elegance
as in a more professional lodge,
the family atmosphere is enough
to draw crowds in its own right
not to mention the small pricetag.
Guide books will also denote
shared or private bathrooms.
While sharing shower and toilet
facilities for a night may not be a
big deal to many, the overly-mod
est among you may want to pay a
few extra bucks for a pi ivate bath.
Once you've picked out your
destination, call at least a month
in advance. Weekends fill up as far
as two to three months in advance,
and may have pricier rates. Also,
many B&Bs have policies that dic
tate weekend visitors must slay
both Friday and Saturday nights.
Like all reservations, you may
have to guarantee it with a credit
card.
Many B&Bs and inns now
offer a complimentary afternoon
tea or wine-tasting, served around
check-in time. Breakfasts vary,
from full family-style farm break
fasts around a large table to petite
continental fare served in bed,
well ... if you so choose.
One final warning: honey
mooners tend to flock to these
romantic resorts. While they may
seem cute and harmless, sitting at
breakfast with the blushing couple
the next morning can make the
sticky-sweet honey on your scone
pale in comparison.

Tucked away in the lush
hills of the Central California
coast is the quaint hamlet of
Cambria, populated by
artists, writers and semi-rustic
F.A. "burnout" cases.
Barbara and Mel
Schwimmer, innkeepers of
the J. Patrick House Bed and
Breakfast Inn, are two such
L.A. refugees. Though
they've only recently become
the proprietors of the rustic
log cabin main house and
country-style "backyard" inn,
their warm hospitality would

make one think they've been
doing this for years.

The previous
owner was
apparently a

die- h a r d
Irish
woman.

Th c
in n

is named for her Irish father,
and each of its eight bed
rooms is named after an Irish
County.
Most of the rooms are in
the separate "inn," which
resembles a farmhouse and is
separated from the cabin by a
small but colorful garden.
The rooms have a certain
Irish country charm to them;
each room has a wood-burn
ing fireplace and its own pri
vate bath. Rooms are deco
rated with pine antiques and
floral prints, and contain
queen- or king-size beds.

I'o ensure you have a
restful stay,

there are

no ph ones, televisions or
radios in the rooms — but if
you get bored, you can be
entertained by your neigh
bors, since the walls are a lit
tle thin.
The main house is an
authentic log cabin, built
about 10 years ago.
Furnished witn an eclectic
but pleasant combination of
antiques and large art deco
prints, the living room is an
inviting place to have wine
and cheese from 5:30 p.m. to
6:30 p.m., after you check in.
The morning meal is
served in an airy breakfast
room attached to the back of
the log cabin, from 7:30 a.m.
to 9:30 a.m. While the food
was good — fresh fruit salad,
fresh breads and muffins with
delicious apricot cream

cheese — it was a little
disappointing to

receive almost
exactly the same

fare two morn
ings in a row.

The inn is
located just
up the hill

from a
charming
part of town,
with two

excellent
restaurants,
Robin's and

lan's, as well as a
host of art galleries
and shops, it is six
miles south of
Hearst Castle.

Looking
for that per
fect getaway

spot, removed
from the bustle of

Stanford and city life
yet still close enough
for a short, weekend
stay? The small seaside
village of Mendocino is

just the place. The town x
provides a dose of simple
living, not to mention spec
tacular beachscapes and hik
ing trails, all within four
hours of campus.
Mendocino is nestled on
the north coast, accessible
from both Highway One or
128 which branches off from
101. 'Fhe coastal route (Hwy
1) takes a bit longer but the
ocean views are well worth
the extra time. Fhe equally
scenic 128 winds through
Anderson Valley, home to
many small wineries with tast
ing rooms right oil the high
way that will pour you a free
sampling of wine.
Quaint, rustic inns, as
well as bed and breakfasts,
abound in Mendocino,
although many target wealthy
tourists and charge anywhere
from $75 to $150 a night. A
better option for students
with a limited budget is the
more affordable McFlroy's
Inn on Main street.
