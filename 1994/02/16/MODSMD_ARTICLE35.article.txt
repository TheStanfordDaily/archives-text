We can't all be from
Seattle. It's good to know,
however, that leaving the
Pacific Northwest doesn't
mean abandoning quality
espresso forever. In fact, the
area surrounding Stanford
houses several quality coffee
shops that can provide the
perfect twenty-something
first date atmosphere, a solid
study environment or just a
good cup of joe.
Perhaps the best-known
coffee shop in the area is Cafe
Borrone. Located just north
of Stanford, up El Camino to
Menlo Park, Borrone serves
up an appealing blend of
ambiance and beverage.
Adjacent to the extensive
Kepler's Books, the combina
tion of espresso junkies and
bibliophiles makes Borrone a
coffee shop with an attitude.
The small cafe and sur
rounding patio is always
packed with Stanford's nou
veau sophisticates — and a
few Paly High-ers straining to
match their nonchalance. A

lively place to see and be seen,
Borrone would not be an ideal
spot for a silent study session
or a clandestine encounter.
Their extensive menu of
coffee drinks includes all of
the standards, with a few
Borrone originals thrown in.
A favorite among many
Stanford students is the frost
ed mocha ($3.50), a cold
shake-like drink which
chunks of real coffee beans.
Coffee costs $1, but refills will
set you back two quarters.
Lattes ($1.85) and mochas
($2.10) are very reasonably
priced.
Cafe Borrone is open until
11 p.m. Monday through
Thursday, Friday and
Saturday until midnight and
Sunday until 5 p.m.
Closer to home, the up
and-coming Rodger's offers
an intimate, airy atmosphere
— and some of the biggest
and most original hot drinks
in town. Rodger's is located
just off University, on
Ramona Street.

Not much in the way of
Bohemian atmosphere,
Rodger's is clean, bright and
populated with a predomi
nantly young-professional
crowd.
Served in Rodger's own
huge bowl-shaped mugs, their
drinks are as delicious as they
are distinctive. Mocha
Monkey ($3), a banana-fla
vored mocha, and Almond
Moo ($3.25), a sweet and
soothing variation on tradi
tional steamed milk, top the
list.
Rodger's prices are a little
high, but you get more bever
age for your buck. Coffin; is 85
cents, with one free refill. A
latte will set you back $2.25; a
mocha $2.50.
While the menu is very
limited, the cafe offers soups,
gourmet sandwiches and
breakfast pastries. Euro-types
will find the baguette and brie
combination particularly
appealing. Rodger's is open
Monday through Thursday
until 10 p.m., Friday and
Saturday until 11:30, and
Sunday until 10 p.m.
At Palo Alto's Caffe

Verona, you can bask in
Borrone's brand of coffee
house cool without running
into an old flame or shouting
across the table to be heard.
Spacious and tastefully-deco
rated, Verona has the feel of a
purist's coffee shop — minus
the grime. Located on
Hamilton, which runs parallel
to University, the cafe is
accessible without being over
run.
Offering the most exten
sive beverage menu we came
across, Verona's serves the
basics up at competitive
prices. Coffee is $1, with free
refills; tack on a mysterious
15 cents for decaf. Mochas
($2.30) and lattes ($2) are
delicious and piping hot.
In addition, a large selec
tion of pasta, panini sand
wiches, salads and soups are
available, though interested
diners will have to make it
there before 9:HO p.m. The
cafe is open for drinks and
pastries until 11 p.m. Monday
through Thursday, midnight
on Friday and Saturday, and
5 p.m. on Sunday.
