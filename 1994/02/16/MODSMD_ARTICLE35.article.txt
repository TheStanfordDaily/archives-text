We can't all be from
Seattle. It's good to know,
however, that leaving the
Pacific Northwest doesn't
mean abandoning quality
espresso forever. In fact, the
area surrounding Stanford
houses several quality coffee
shops that can provide the
perfect twenty-something
first date atmosphere, a solid
study environment or just a
good cup of joe.
Perhaps the best-known
coffee shop in the area is Cafe
Borrone. Located just north
of Stanford, up El Camino to
Menlo Park, Borrone serves
up an appealing blend of
ambiance and beverage.
Adjacent to the extensive
Kepler's Books, the combina
tion of espresso junkies and
bibliophiles makes Borrone a
coffee shop with an attitude.
The small cafe and sur
rounding patio is always
packed with Stanford's nou
veau sophisticates — and a
few Paly High-ers straining to
match their nonchalance. A

lively place to see and be seen,
Borrone would not be an ideal
spot for a silent study session
or a clandestine encounter.
Their extensive menu of
coffee drinks includes all of
the standards, with a few
Borrone originals thrown in.
A favorite among many
Stanford students is the frost
ed mocha ($3.50), a cold
shake-like drink which
chunks of real coffee beans.
Coffee costs $1, but refills will
set you back two quarters.
Lattes ($1.85) and mochas
($2.10) are very reasonably
priced.
Cafe Borrone is open until
11 p.m. Monday through
Thursday, Friday and
Saturday until midnight and
Sunday until 5 p.m.
Closer to home, the up
and-coming Rodger's offers
an intimate, airy atmosphere
— and some of the biggest
and most original hot drinks
in town. Rodger's is located
just off University, on
Ramona Street.

Not much in the way of
Bohemian atmosphere,
Rodger's is clean, bright and
populated with a predomi
nantly young-professional
crowd.
Served in Rodger's own
huge bowl-shaped mugs, their
drinks are as delicious as they
are distinctive. Mocha
Monkey ($3), a banana-fla
vored mocha, and Almond
Moo ($3.25), a sweet and
soothing variation on tradi
tional steamed milk, top the
list.
Rodger's prices are a little
high, but you get more bever
age for your buck. Coffin; is 85
cents, with one free refill. A
latte will set you back $2.25; a
mocha $2.50.
While the menu is very
limited, the cafe offers soups,
gourmet sandwiches and
breakfast pastries. Euro-types
will find the baguette and brie
combination particularly
appealing. Rodger's is open
Monday through Thursday
until 10 p.m., Friday and
Saturday until 11:30, and
Sunday until 10 p.m.
At Palo Alto's Caffe

Verona, you can bask in
Borrone's brand of coffee
house cool without running
into an old flame or shouting
across the table to be heard.
Spacious and tastefully-deco
rated, Verona has the feel of a
purist's coffee shop — minus
the grime. Located on
Hamilton, which runs parallel
to University, the cafe is
accessible without being over
run.
Offering the most exten
sive beverage menu we came
across, Verona's serves the
basics up at competitive
prices. Coffee is $1, with free
refills; tack on a mysterious
15 cents for decaf. Mochas
($2.30) and lattes ($2) are
delicious and piping hot.
In addition, a large selec
tion of pasta, panini sand
wiches, salads and soups are
available, though interested
diners will have to make it
there before 9:HO p.m. The
cafe is open for drinks and
pastries until 11 p.m. Monday
through Thursday, midnight
on Friday and Saturday, and
5 p.m. on Sunday.
Primarily known for its


Burt Herman - Daily
legendary bakery goods, The
Prolific Oven is developing a
reputation as an excellent cof
fee shop in its own right.
Located next to Florentine's
Restaurant on Waverly, The
Prolific Oven is the perfect
place for an after-dinner
espresso or sweet treat.
Low-hanging lamps and
fans, combined with a yeasty
bakery smell, give The
Prolific Oven a down-to-earth
feel. Patrons and courteous
counter-help are free from the
pretentious airs that domi
nate many such establish
ments, a welcome change.
Their espresso menu is
pretty basic: a small coffee is
87 cents, lattes and mochas
are $2.11 and $2.33, respec
tively. A friendly worker
offered us the secret to their
heavenly hot chocolate: as a
bakery, they simply break
pieces off of the five- and 10-
pound bars of milk chocolate
they use in their tempting
desserts and make cocoa from
"the real thing" — not pow
ders like most of their com
petitors.
The Prolific Oven is open

until 7 p.m. on Monday
nights, 10 p.m. Tuesday
through Thursday, and week
ends until midnight.
And finally, for deprived
Northwesterners, Starbucks
Coffee recently added a
University Avenue site to its
growing fleet of espresso
shops.
Although the University
store offers in-shop seating, it
hasn't lost the highly-pol
ished, metropolitan feel of
Starbucks' original java-on
the-run locations. While
Starbucks isn't exactly a poet
ry-reading kind of place, its
simple, smart atmosphere is
certainly conducive to a power
coffee break or a quality chat.
One of the more technical
espressories, Starbucks' cof
fee drinks are created with
uniformity and precision. Try
a cup of one of Starbucks'
many coffee blends for 85
cents, or bargain lattes
($1.50) and mochas ($1.75).
Starbucks is open Monday
through Thursday until 10
p.m., Friday and Saturday
until 11 p.m. and Sundays
until 8 p.m.
