A skinny espresso macchiato grande? If the jargon of
trendy coffee drinks has you a bit in the dark, here's a
short guide to some of the more popular espresso terms.
Espresso: The term is commonly used to refer to a
variety of mixed coffee drinks made from a specific
blend of beans and brewed using a special rapid method.
If you ask for an espresso, however, don't be surprised
when you're given a small shot of very concentrated,
syrupy coffee; purists will assume you mean a caffe
espresso.

steamed milk to fill the glass. Vanilla, almond, and
other flavors can be added.
