## OUT OF A PLANE AND INTO THE GREAT WIDE OPEN 
### 
Story by Tish Williams Photos by Burt Herman and Vincent Ho

"Hmm... 13, 500 feet? I
bet if your parachute didn't
open, your body would
bounce when it hit the
ground," comforted my most
reassuring of companions as I
rubbed my knotted stomach
and shifted my glance ner
vously out die car window.
Here I was, a day after
turning in my honors thesis
and on the verge of gradua
tion, getting ready to jump
out of a plane. All $100,000 of
my parents' hard-earned
tuition money, playing gravity
roulette. A reasonably sane
individual throwing away all
my dreams of dying in a spec
tacular coup attempt in the
Caribbean for an anonymous
death in the middle of cow pie
central.
So much for higher edu
cation.
We pulled into the small
Hollister airport and I quickly
jumped out to inspect
"Skydive Hollister," the estab
lishment which was to Like my
life in its hands in exchange
for "the highest first-time
freefall jump" in California.
There were no Harleys
parked out front. No
Marlboro men comparing tat
toos. No women armwresding
each other on the picnic
bench outside the Skydive

1 lollister office.
I walked up to the recep
tionist, who had made over
100 jumps herself. Tandem
jumping? It's perfectly safe,
she assured. 1 he Mack truck
of parachuting — indestruc
tible, she joked. Exhilaration
without the risk, she stressed.
Then she whipped out the
forms. In a matter of minutes,
I had promptly signed my life
away, initialed my under
standing of all the horrible
deaths I could die in the
course of the next couple
hours and relinquished all my
rights to suing the skin-tight
black jumpsuits off my gra
cious hosts.
Pretty sneaky, sis.
Now enthusiastically
anticipating the jump ahead, I
was hustled into a room with
my four fellow beginners to
watch a video on tandem
jumping. To the background
strains of Van Halen's
"Jump," my comrades and I
learned the five or six basic
rules of our jump — most of
which entailed not getting in
the instructor's way.
After hearing the line-up
of Skydive 1 lollister's veritable
cornucopia of reasonably
priced offerings (video
footage or still photos of the
jump, T-shirts, coffee mugs,

etc.), we met
with our tan-

dem instructors
and were given

jumpsuits and goggles.
I crossed my fingers
for a real pro. Someone who
would forgive the fact that my
small attention span had kept
me from remembering any
steps of the jump. Someone
with brains, brawn and the
expertise needed to get me on
the ground anything less than
a vertebrae pancake.
Someone who came up
and introduced herself to me
with a smile and a few jokes
about me being nervous and
her not planning any life
threatening maneuvers din
ing our six minutes strapped
together in the air.
Beth, the master of my
fate, covered all the instruc
tions with me as we executed a
perfect dry run on the pave
ment of the runway, waiting
for the plane. I was in g<x>d
hands, she assured me,
adding that she had made
over 2,000 jumps in her
career.
While the other first
timers waited for the next
plane, the veterans and 1
packed ourselves like multi
colored sardines into a small
plane with no seats. Beth then

attached
the hooks

that would
keep me from

bouncing on the
grassy fields whit h got

smaller and smaller out
the plane window. I was
giddy with anticipation as the
old-timers joked with me
about Beth's medication and
her mental instability.
At 3,000 feet, I looked out
my window and remarked
about how high up we were, to
the friendly ridicule of my
jaded comrades. Come 12,000
feet 1 was getting ready to wet
rny pants as everyone began
checking their hooks and
straps one last time, and I
looked out the window to see
Monterey Bay and thousands
of acres of cowland rolling out
to the ocean.
Instantly, everyone began
filing out of the plane, those
nearest to me giving tnc a
thumbs up for good luck.

Beth
and I

crab
walked to

the open door
of the plane as it
finally dawned on
me that I was
doing one of the
most insane
things of my
entire life.

I looked out
at the coastline,
felt the wind whip
ping against my
face, heard the
"ready, set, go,"
and with no fear

of Cod or the laws of
physics, I jumped out
of a moving airplane,
mysteriously remem
bering to arch and to
keep my hands safely
out of Beth's wav.

F or
an en-

tire min
ute, I sped

toward the
ground at 120

miles per hour,
floating in com
plete sensory over
load. I lie wind roared
in my ears and my
chest pounded with
i he excitement of
1,000 accd finals as I
achieved the closest to
nirvanic peace one
can while being video
taped.
Suddenly, Beth
tapped me on the
shoulder and opened
our parachute, the
noise and the wind
subsided and I began
yapping like a hyper
active child about how
awesome skydiving
was and when could 1
go again and how
long would it be
before 1 could become
an instructor t<x>.
Beth pointed out
all the geographical
landmarks in the adja
cent vicinity as we took
a skytoui of Santa Cruz
and Monterey. Soon,
however, our trip was

drawing to an close.
We practiced a few
landings in the air and
then breezed through
the real thing, execut
ing our flair and land
ing standing up, the
mightiest of all world
conquerers.
The sun was set
ting by this point, as
everyone gathered
their parachutes and
hiked to the van which
would take us back to
the airport. Yours
truly, overwhelmed
and still in a state of
bliss from the experi
ence, barely noticed
the passing of time on
the drive back. Half
consciously, I returned
my equipment to the
front desk and the
receptionist smiled
and gave me my fust
time skydiver diploma
and complimentary
bumper sticker.
My companions,
eager to get some din
ner and head back to
campus, piled back
into the car, ready to
leave cow country and
skydiving behind. I
craned my neck to
keep the airport in
view, gripping my
video in one hand and
my diploma in the
other, devising wily

schemes to explain to
my parents that I not
only jumped from a
plane, but that I was
planning to make it
my career.
Bombs away.
