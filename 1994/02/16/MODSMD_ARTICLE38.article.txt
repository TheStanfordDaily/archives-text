Story by Sarah Nagae

A peek outside reveals ;i
glorious blue sky — a perfect
day to shove aside that course
reader and problem set and
step into nature.
Anyone from the lirsi time
explorer to the trail-worn,
experienced mountaineer c.in
enjoy the many hiking oppor
tunities around Stanford. A lit
tie preparation and a lew free
hours are the only require
ments for an outing lh;i( will
expose you to the natural won
ders and beauty lluit can be
lound minutes from campus.
I liking, like any other out
door activity, lakes a bit of pre
t rip planning in order to
insure a safe and pleasurable
experience. But since hiking
does not require as miu h
equipment as other activities
like skiing or rock climbing,
you will probably find you
already have all the necessary
supplies. If not, there are
many stores in the area which
specialize in backpacking and
hiking gear.
Ilie first and most impor
tant item is, of course, the
proper footwear. Hiking
boots, which have become
popular not only for their
intended purpose hut also as
fashionable everyday shoes,
come ill a wide range of styles
and prices.
Support and comfort are

I lit' keys to l In* right pair of
boots, as ;i twisted iiitkle or a
throbbing blister will keep
even the most enthusiastic
hiker oil the lr;iils. When
shopping lor hiking boots, In
sure to ask tbi' salesperson
whit h brands be or she would
suggest, t.iking into account
your skill level and how much
hiking you plan to do.
l ake your time Hying on
dilfcrcnl brands and styles of
boots so you get a good sens*'
ol bow they leel. It's ;ilso wise
to make a couple of laps
around the store, walking and
running to make sure the lit is
right.
Most places also have a
tamp tluit allows you to test
how the boots led on a down
hill slope. Use the ramp to
make sure that your foot
doesn't slip around in the lx>ot
too much, but that the lit still
allows for adequate move
ment.
The thickness of your
sin ks is ;ilso a factor to consid
er in determining the light
si/e — so try the boots on with
the socks you plan to wear hik
ing. Wool or a similar synthet
ic material provide the most
cushioning and will also wick
moisture away from your feet.
While some of the more
expensive boots cost anywhere
from $80 $ 150, a good pair

can be found lor $(i()-$70.
Some stores near campus
wliieli carry wide selections are
I he Pacific Mountaineer in
Palo Alto, Redwood Trading
I'ost and Any Mountain
Limited in Redwood C.ity,
Oshman's Sporting (ioods in
Mountain View and R.K.I, in
San Carlos.
These stores also supply
the other hiking necessities
you will need lor your excur
sion, starting with a backpack.
A standard pack should he
large enough to tote all that
you will need lor a day hike,
including extra clothes and a
water lx>ttlc.
Shorts and a 'T-shirt con
stitute the typical California
hiking attire and arc usually
adequate for warm days. But
the air can quickly cool once
the sun g<x's down, so he sure
to carry a sweatshirt or wind
hreaker. A hat or visor is rec
ommended for protection
from the sun, and a bandanna

.ilso (onics iii handy as head
wear or to wipe the sweat oil
allei a partu ulai ly steep < hint).
He sure to also throw hi
siiiisc reen, sunglasses, and a
small liiNt aid kit in< hiding

A compass will keep you head
ed in the right direction, hut
you'll also want to pick up a
trail map as you plan your
route.
Don't forget a camera to
capture that particularly
inspiring panoramic view, or
your friends as they pose at

mit. Other necessities include
change, kleenex, a pocket
knife, a whistle, lire starter or
matelies, a cup, moleskin, pain

If you're planning on a
full day hike, pack a nutritious
lunch including lots of carlx»-
hydrates. Kven if you are only
out for the morning or after
noon, bring some food along
