Story by Michael Slemmer Photos by Burt Herman

Looking across San
Francisco Bay while standing
on the pier at Fisherman's
Wharf, you can't see much
perhaps the flashing spotlight
on Alcatraz Island and some
houses dotting the hills on the
other side.
Yet if you asked any of
the inhabitants of Marin
County, the seemingly wild
landscape which lies just north
of San Francisco, they would
tell you that there is no better
place to live — or to visit.
Driving north from the
Golden Gate Bridge, the first
landmarks you see are the
headlands, the brown hills vis
ible from across the Bay. They
are marked by a tourist-rid
den road which, winding its
way west from the freeway,
offers a spectacular view of the
city.
Here, people roam
throughout bunkers left over
from the second World War,
and a windy one-way road will
take you to Point Bonita, a
small peninsula containing an
old naval base.
But the best is yet to
come. To see the less-traveled
sights, follow Highway 101
further north.
After passing through the
Waldo tunnel (which locals
call the Rainbow tunnel

because of
the colors
[> a in t e d
above its
entrance),
the scen
ery chan
ges to rol
ling green
hills, with
the Bay to
the right
and small
towns off
the road.
Several
miles nor
th, High
way 1 div
erges from
the main
road head
ing over
the head
lands to
ward the
ocean.
After
( Ii m b in g
to the top
of the hills,
the road

plunges back down in a windy
segment of road that you
might remember from the
movie Basic Instinct, bringing
the ocean into view.
In this first valley, you can
turn left onto a small road
that is marked only hy an
unusual Fnglish restaurant
called the Pelican Inn.
Though the food at the
inn doesn't stand up to the
seafood available elsewhere in
Marin, its atmosphere makes
it an excellent place to eat
lunch or dinner without the
distractions of herds of other
people.
Following the road to the
left you reach a small, isolated
cove. Alter walking across a
wooden bridge (or hopping
from rock to rock) to cross a
creek, you will find Muir
Beach. On weekdays, the
beach is usually unpopulated.
Fncased by rex ky outcrop
pings on either side, the
beach is both secluded and
beautiful — an excellent place
to walk or sit, though the
water is too cold for swim
ming.
If you're daring, you can
walk along the rocks to the
right of the beach where, from
time to time, people sunbathe
in the nude. Here you will
find another cove where the

locals come down from their
houses to relax.
Two other great destina
tions near the Marin coastline
are beautiful but tend to
attract more tourists than
Muii Beach.
Driving further along
Highway 1 will bring you to
Stinson Beach, a wide
expanse of white sand and
beach houses reminiscent of
beaches in southern
California. Because the water
is shallower, it is often warm
enough to swim in sunny
weather.
On the way to Stinson
Beach, there is a turnoff to
the right which leads to Muir
W<xxls, one of the lew places
in California where you can
see Sequoia trees — giant red
woods which grow to enor
mous heights and often live
for thousands of years.
Willi in the Muir Woods
National Monument, there
are enough trails to get away
from people, though the gift
shop seems to attract a large
number of visitors. Despite
the crowds, the canopy of
trees is spectacular, making it
perpetually cool and shady

within tlit*
park.
Walking
thro u g h
the woods,
you might
notice a
sign for
the Dipsea
trail, where
a seven
milt- race is
held every
year from
the town of
Mill Valley
to Stinson
Beach.
Mill Val
ley can be
reached by
turning left
off High
way 101 at
the Blithe
dale Road
exit, just
north of
the turnoff
for Muir
Beach.
The town
represents
the epito
me of the
Marin life-

style. The residents are laid
back and friendly, and back in
the hills, people walk their
clogs along the narrow streets.
It's the kind of place where
yot don't have to lock your
d<x>r.
After following Blithedale
into town, you can turn left
onto Throckmorton Street,
site of the Sequoia Cinemas
where the annual Mill Valley
film festival is held.
Further along, you enter a
small square marked by
shops, restaurants and the
Depot, a place where resi
dents sit and read the newspa
per in the afternoon.
The more adventurous
visitor can follow Blithedale
back into the hills and look at
the houses perched on steep
hillsides. But be careful
only the locals know which
roads are one-way.
If you want to see just how
varied Marin's inhabitants can
be, turn right on a street
called Kldridge. Follow it to
house number 424. . . . That's
where Fig-Pen — the Grateful
Dead's deceased keyboardist


used to live.
More importantly, Mill
Valley oilers an opportunity to
(liml) Mount Tamalpias
the tallest of the mountains
which are visible from
throughout Marin. Ix>ng ago,
the Miwok Native Americans
would not venture to the top
of the mountain because they
considered it a sacred location.
I'o find the trail, drive
down lUithedale until you see
Lee Street going off to the
right. Just beyond Lee, there
is a dirt fire road which
winds its way I<> the right into
the hills.
11 iking up t lie trail, you
will reach a ridge whi< h you
can follow to the "Hoo-koo
ee-koo" Trail leading to the
top of Ihe mountain a
scenic location offering views
of San Francisco and north
ern Marin. If you're afraid of
getting lost, you can always
pick up a trail map at the
Mill Valley Visitors' Center,
next door to the Depot.

If you don't feel like hik
ing, there is a road which
also goes to the top of the
mountain. Io find it, you'll
have to turn left off
Throckmorton Street (which
goes through the town's cen
ter) onto Miller Avenue.
When you get to the 2
a.m. Club, turn right and fol
low the road up the moun
tain to a street called
Panoramic I lighway.
The highway will eventu
ally lead you to the lop of the
mountain, but watch for
trails going off the left of the
toad. For example, one small
walking route — called the
Sun Trail — takes you to an
unusual Cerman tourist club
where you can drink all the
beer you can find.
Seafood restaurants are
another of Marin's special
ties. I urn right instead of left
from Highway 101 onto
Hlithd.de Road. Here, you
will find a road leading to
Tiburon, a small peninsula
pointing out into the San
Francisco Bay.
Following the road to the
end of the |>oint, you will find a
strip of shops and fabulous
restaurants located next to the

water. They
all offer
views of Sail
Franc is c o
which, at
night, can
be quite
impressive.
II u i
whether you
choose to
end your
day in Ma
rin eating in
Tiburon or
watching the
sun set over
the Pacific a*
Muir beach,
you are
guaranteed
to enjoy
your visit.
And il
you're too
tired to
drive home,
you can stay
at the
Pelican Inn.
They'd love
to have you.

The author used to live in
Mill Valley when he was a
kid, hut has still never actu

ally entered the 2 a.m. Club.
And just in ease you were
wondering, he used to live
at 424 Eldridge. You should
see the soundproof room.

Story by Michael Slemmer Photos by Burt Herman

Looking across San
Francisco Bay while standing
on the pier at Fisherman's
Wharf, you can't see much
perhaps the flashing spotlight
on Alcatraz Island and some
houses dotting the hills on the
other side.
Yet if you asked any of
the inhabitants of Marin
County, the seemingly wild
landscape which lies just north
of San Francisco, they would
tell you that there is no better
place to live — or to visit.
Driving north from the
Golden Gate Bridge, the first
landmarks you see are the
headlands, the brown hills vis
ible from across the Bay. They
are marked by a tourist-rid
den road which, winding its
way west from the freeway,
offers a spectacular view of the
city.
Here, people roam
throughout bunkers left over
from the second World War,
and a windy one-way road will
take you to Point Bonita, a
small peninsula containing an
old naval base.
But the best is yet to
come. To see the less-traveled
sights, follow Highway 101
further north.
After passing through the
Waldo tunnel (which locals
call the Rainbow tunnel

because of
the colors
[> a in t e d
above its
entrance),
the scen
ery chan
ges to rol
ling green
hills, with
the Bay to
the right
and small
towns off
the road.
Several
miles nor
th, High
way 1 div
erges from
the main
road head
ing over
the head
lands to
ward the
ocean.
After
( Ii m b in g
to the top
of the hills,
the road

plunges back down in a windy
segment of road that you
might remember from the
movie Basic Instinct, bringing
the ocean into view.
In this first valley, you can
turn left onto a small road
that is marked only hy an
unusual Fnglish restaurant
called the Pelican Inn.
Though the food at the
inn doesn't stand up to the
seafood available elsewhere in
Marin, its atmosphere makes
it an excellent place to eat
lunch or dinner without the
distractions of herds of other
people.
Following the road to the
left you reach a small, isolated
cove. Alter walking across a
wooden bridge (or hopping
from rock to rock) to cross a
creek, you will find Muir
Beach. On weekdays, the
beach is usually unpopulated.
Fncased by rex ky outcrop
pings on either side, the
beach is both secluded and
beautiful — an excellent place
to walk or sit, though the
water is too cold for swim
ming.
If you're daring, you can
walk along the rocks to the
right of the beach where, from
time to time, people sunbathe
in the nude. Here you will
find another cove where the

locals come down from their
houses to relax.
Two other great destina
tions near the Marin coastline
are beautiful but tend to
attract more tourists than
Muii Beach.
Driving further along
Highway 1 will bring you to
Stinson Beach, a wide
expanse of white sand and
beach houses reminiscent of
beaches in southern
California. Because the water
is shallower, it is often warm
enough to swim in sunny
weather.
On the way to Stinson
Beach, there is a turnoff to
the right which leads to Muir
W<xxls, one of the lew places
in California where you can
see Sequoia trees — giant red
woods which grow to enor
mous heights and often live
for thousands of years.
Willi in the Muir Woods
National Monument, there
are enough trails to get away
from people, though the gift
shop seems to attract a large
number of visitors. Despite
the crowds, the canopy of
trees is spectacular, making it
perpetually cool and shady

within tlit*
park.
Walking
thro u g h
the woods,
you might
notice a
sign for
the Dipsea
trail, where
a seven
milt- race is
held every
year from
the town of
Mill Valley
to Stinson
Beach.
Mill Val
ley can be
reached by
turning left
off High
way 101 at
the Blithe
dale Road
exit, just
north of
the turnoff
for Muir
Beach.
The town
represents
the epito
me of the
Marin life-

style. The residents are laid
back and friendly, and back in
the hills, people walk their
clogs along the narrow streets.
It's the kind of place where
yot don't have to lock your
d<x>r.
After following Blithedale
into town, you can turn left
onto Throckmorton Street,
site of the Sequoia Cinemas
where the annual Mill Valley
film festival is held.
