# Budget cuts prompt changes at Tresidder
## Possibility of outside management for union 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
As restructuring within the University
continues, the future of Tresidder Union is
under examination, spurred on by the im
petus of budget cuts.
The potential changes have worried
many longtime Tresidder managers and
employees, who say that the split between
the union's retail operations and its student
services is likely to widen.
A task force of students, faculty, admin
istrators and staff will be formed in the next
few weeks to "streamline" the student
union's business operations, including the
possibility of an outside company managing
Tresidder's retail affairs, said Provost Con
doleezza Rice.
"We are going to examine alternatives

for Tresidder," Rice said. "The idea would
then be to take a look at what we might be
doing to serve students more effectively and
more efficiently."
"The goal of the task force is to write a
proposal for outside companies to bid for re
tail space in an effort to reduce our retail
deficit," said Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Mary Edmonds.
"There's a possibility that we could get a
sizable part of our (Student Affairs budget)
reductions through Tresidder," Edmonds
added. Like other administrative units, Stu
dent Affairs expects to lose 15-30 percent of
its budget to cuts over the next three years.
While Rice conceded that management
of Tresidder's retail operations could "con
ceivably" shift to an outside firm, she
stressed that the prospect of
internal supervision will also be
examined.
"Frankly, it's hard to imagine
a company just waiting to manage
Tresidder," Rice said.
The decision to "change
Tresidder from within or with
out" depends entirely on the task
force, Edmonds said. But some
administrators warned against
handing control of the union to an
outside firm.
"We've worked hard to build
Tresidder carefully, taking into
account that it's the center of the
community," said Tresidder's
director Bobbi Braden. "I'm not
sure you can get that from outside
companies."
Besides the fact that Tresidder
is "losing a million-plus (dollars) a
year," Rice said she worries that
the University is not making full
use of the union's possibilities,
noting that the building is
"mobbed at lunch time" but rela
tively quiet the rest of the day.
The University currently sub
sidizes Tresidder, covering any
deficit in its operating budget
with money from Stanford's gen
eral fund.
In January, the Office of Stu
dent Activities was removed from
Tresidder's authority and placed
directly under the Dean of Stu
dents' Office — separating stu
dent activities from retail services
as part of the budget reduction
process.
"In fairness to the current

staff, it is very difficult to balance
student needs and activities with
running an efficient retail opera
tion," Rice said.
Now, with the move toward
external management for retail
affairs, the gap between student
and retail activities seems to be
widening. The separation of these
two goals, however, worries
Braden.
While Braden appreciates the
"innovative economic outlook"
that an outside agency could
bring to the union, she said she
hopes that whoever assumes the
administration of Tresidder takes
students into account.
Braden said she and others
from within Tresidder are plan
ning to submit their own propos
al, regardless of the task force's
recommendations.
Stressing that the internal pro
posal will be "based on the change
in direction we were mandated in
December," Braden said their rec
ommendations will "focus on
retail operations as opposed to
balancing the retail side with stu
dent activities."
"As I understand it, our goal in
retail services is to decrease the
amount of money we are getting
from general funds," Braden said.
While the specifics of the pro
posal are not yet available, the
plan will focus on both improving
and expanding Tresidder's leased
operations, Braden said.
Saying she is "concerned"
about the possibility of losing
staff, Braden added that it's "not
clear how many (staff members)
would be lost, and if any or all
staff would be retained under out
side management."

Whatever changes are imple
mented "need to happen immedi
ately in terms of staff," Braden
said. "If you're going to get these
kinds of budget reductions, we'll
need a little lead time.
"There are good people here
who have served this community
for quite a while," she said, adding
that some staff members have
already chosen to leave Tresidder
in the face of budget cuts.
Others remain somewhat puz
zled by the recent developments
and looming reforms.
"Everything seems very con
fusing to me right now," said one
Tresidder retail official. "We've
worked very hard here and I know
a lot of people just want to know
what's really going on."
"We're just wondering what
tomorrow is going to be like," the
official added.
Director of the Office of Stu
dent Services Nanci Howe said it
is "too early to tell" how the
changes will affect student activi
ties.
"Clearly the direction of serv
ing students will continue, but its
now a question of how we imple
ment this goal," Howe said.
"What are we willing to spend to
reach this end?"
The task force, which will rely
on market research, focus groups
and last year's Stanford Book
store survey, will concentrate on
both existing retail services and
innovative possibilities for the
future, Rice said.
While she realizes that the pro
posal may not be published until
next fall, Rice said she "would
hope that they could report their
findings by the end of the year."

running an efficient retail opera
tion," Rice said.
Now, with the move toward
external management for retail
affairs, the gap between student
and retail activities seems to be
widening. The separation of these
two goals, however, worries
Braden.
While Braden appreciates the
"innovative economic outlook"
that an outside agency could
bring to the union, she said she
hopes that whoever assumes the
administration of Tresidder takes
students into account.
Braden said she and others
from within Tresidder are plan
ning to submit their own propos
al, regardless of the task force's
recommendations.
Stressing that the internal pro
posal will be "based on the change
in direction we were mandated in
December," Braden said their rec
ommendations will "focus on
retail operations as opposed to
balancing the retail side with stu
dent activities."
"As I understand it, our goal in
retail services is to decrease the
amount of money we are getting
from general funds," Braden said.
While the specifics of the pro
posal are not yet available, the
plan will focus on both improving
and expanding Tresidder's leased
operations, Braden said.
Saying she is "concerned"
about the possibility of losing
staff, Braden added that it's "not
clear how many (staff members)
would be lost, and if any or all
staff would be retained under out
side management."

Whatever changes are imple
mented "need to happen immedi
ately in terms of staff," Braden
said. "If you're going to get these
kinds of budget reductions, we'll
need a little lead time.
"There are good people here
who have served this community
for quite a while," she said, adding
that some staff members have
already chosen to leave Tresidder
in the face of budget cuts.
Others remain somewhat puz
zled by the recent developments
and looming reforms.
"Everything seems very con
fusing to me right now," said one
Tresidder retail official. "We've
worked very hard here and I know
a lot of people just want to know
what's really going on."
"We're just wondering what
tomorrow is going to be like," the
official added.
Director of the Office of Stu
dent Services Nanci Howe said it
is "too early to tell" how the
changes will affect student activi
ties.
"Clearly the direction of serv
ing students will continue, but its
now a question of how we imple
ment this goal," Howe said.
"What are we willing to spend to
reach this end?"
The task force, which will rely
on market research, focus groups
and last year's Stanford Book
store survey, will concentrate on
both existing retail services and
innovative possibilities for the
future, Rice said.
While she realizes that the pro
posal may not be published until
next fall, Rice said she "would
hope that they could report their
findings by the end of the year."
As restructuring within the University
continues, the future of Tresidder Union is
under examination, spurred on by the im
petus of budget cuts.
The potential changes have worried
many longtime Tresidder managers and
employees, who say that the split between
the union's retail operations and its student
services is likely to widen.
A task force of students, faculty, admin
istrators and staff will be formed in the next
few weeks to "streamline" the student
union's business operations, including the
possibility of an outside company managing
Tresidder's retail affairs, said Provost Con
doleezza Rice.
"We are going to examine alternatives

for Tresidder," Rice said. "The idea would
then be to take a look at what we might be
doing to serve students more effectively and
more efficiently."
"The goal of the task force is to write a
proposal for outside companies to bid for re
tail space in an effort to reduce our retail
deficit," said Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Mary Edmonds.
"There's a possibility that we could get a
sizable part of our (Student Affairs budget)
reductions through Tresidder," Edmonds
added. Like other administrative units, Stu
dent Affairs expects to lose 15-30 percent of
its budget to cuts over the next three years.
While Rice conceded that management
of Tresidder's retail operations could "con
ceivably" shift to an outside firm, she
stressed that the prospect of
internal supervision will also be
examined.
"Frankly, it's hard to imagine
a company just waiting to manage
Tresidder," Rice said.
The decision to "change
Tresidder from within or with
out" depends entirely on the task
force, Edmonds said. But some
administrators warned against
handing control of the union to an
outside firm.
"We've worked hard to build
Tresidder carefully, taking into
account that it's the center of the
community," said Tresidder's
director Bobbi Braden. "I'm not
sure you can get that from outside
companies."
Besides the fact that Tresidder
is "losing a million-plus (dollars) a
year," Rice said she worries that
the University is not making full
use of the union's possibilities,
noting that the building is
"mobbed at lunch time" but rela
tively quiet the rest of the day.
The University currently sub
sidizes Tresidder, covering any
deficit in its operating budget
with money from Stanford's gen
eral fund.
In January, the Office of Stu
dent Activities was removed from
Tresidder's authority and placed
directly under the Dean of Stu
dents' Office — separating stu
dent activities from retail services
as part of the budget reduction
process.
"In fairness to the current

staff, it is very difficult to balance
student needs and activities with
running an efficient retail opera
tion," Rice said.
Now, with the move toward
external management for retail
affairs, the gap between student
and retail activities seems to be
widening. The separation of these
two goals, however, worries
Braden.
While Braden appreciates the
"innovative economic outlook"
