Story by Ed Yoon Graphic by Jackie l^iu

Ancient
Euro pe a n
spring festi
vals tended
to consist of
young men
and women
prancing

about naked
while worship

ping pagan deities
under moonlit
nights. While the
Quad will probably

not be the venue for
these sorts of rites any time
soon, there are other Bay
Area festivals — besides

the World Pumpkin
Weigh-Off and

National
Livestock
k Show —

where pre
p r of e s -
sional,
hip col
legiate
types
can
sample

exotic food, interesting
music and other wares pre
sented on a warm San
Francisco day. Here we sam
ple some traditional favorites
of the Bay Area, all with low
sticker prices:
The Japanese have long
considered the viewing of the
cherry blossom trees — which
bloom a magnificent pink and
white for a few precious days
before dying — to Ik* a tradi
tional reminder of the tran
sience of life. 'I he blossoms are
all gone in Golden Gate Park
by now, but the 27th annual
Northern California Cherry
Blossom Festival will last for a
while.
Rejoice, oh Japanophiles,
everything besides green
lizards with atomic breath will
make an appearance: bonsai,
flower arrangements, samurai
antiques, kotos, kimonos and
every species of sushi imagin
able. The festival features
dancers and taiko drummers
from Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka
and Nagano, shrine carriers
from Osaka and rice pounders
from Tochigi Prefecture.
Don't forget the film festi
val, a taiko drum concert fea
turing troupes from Japan, San
Francisco and Sacramento,
and a parade led by venerable
film actor Tatsuya Nakadai —
who played the grim, pensive
samurai in Akira Kurosawa's
