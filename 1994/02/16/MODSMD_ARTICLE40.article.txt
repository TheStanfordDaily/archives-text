Encounter
the magic of
the Bay Area's
spring 1
\ festivals

Story by Ed Yoon Graphic by Jackie l^iu

Ancient
Euro pe a n
spring festi
vals tended
to consist of
young men
and women
prancing

about naked
while worship

ping pagan deities
under moonlit
nights. While the
Quad will probably

not be the venue for
these sorts of rites any time
soon, there are other Bay
Area festivals — besides

the World Pumpkin
Weigh-Off and

National
Livestock
k Show —

where pre
p r of e s -
sional,
hip col
legiate
types
can
sample

exotic food, interesting
music and other wares pre
sented on a warm San
Francisco day. Here we sam
ple some traditional favorites
of the Bay Area, all with low
sticker prices:
The Japanese have long
considered the viewing of the
cherry blossom trees — which
bloom a magnificent pink and
white for a few precious days
before dying — to Ik* a tradi
tional reminder of the tran
sience of life. 'I he blossoms are
all gone in Golden Gate Park
by now, but the 27th annual
Northern California Cherry
Blossom Festival will last for a
while.
Rejoice, oh Japanophiles,
everything besides green
lizards with atomic breath will
make an appearance: bonsai,
flower arrangements, samurai
antiques, kotos, kimonos and
every species of sushi imagin
able. The festival features
dancers and taiko drummers
from Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka
and Nagano, shrine carriers
from Osaka and rice pounders
from Tochigi Prefecture.
Don't forget the film festi
val, a taiko drum concert fea
turing troupes from Japan, San
Francisco and Sacramento,
and a parade led by venerable
film actor Tatsuya Nakadai —
who played the grim, pensive
samurai in Akira Kurosawa's

finest films — from City Hall
to Japantown. Most events are
free, and take place at the
Japan Center, Post and
Buchanan Streets, over the
weekends of April 16-17 and
23-24. For info, call (415) 563-
23 IS.
What's that? Didn't care for
the Academy Awards? Well,
neither did the folks behind
the 37th Annual San Francisco
Film Festival. Dedicated to the
destruction of all that is banal,
vapid and dumb in current
filmmaking, the SFIFF will l>e
showcasing over 100 films from
37 countries — selected from
over 1,000 entries — to "recog
nize and celebrate the most
innovative achievements in
shorts, documentaries, non
theatrical film, video and televi
sion production from around
the world."
Fhe oldest and largest
competition of its kind in the
United States, the SFIFF lias
long l>een a mecca for film afi
cionados, with showings spread
throughout the city and also in
Palo Alto. Films to look for:

Encounter
the magic of
the Bay Area's
spring 1
\ festivals

Story by Ed Yoon Graphic by Jackie l^iu

Ancient
Euro pe a n
spring festi
vals tended
to consist of
young men
and women
prancing

about naked
while worship

ping pagan deities
under moonlit
nights. While the
Quad will probably

not be the venue for
these sorts of rites any time
soon, there are other Bay
Area festivals — besides

the World Pumpkin
Weigh-Off and

National
Livestock
k Show —

where pre
p r of e s -
sional,
hip col
legiate
types
can
sample

exotic food, interesting
music and other wares pre
sented on a warm San
Francisco day. Here we sam
ple some traditional favorites
of the Bay Area, all with low
sticker prices:
The Japanese have long
considered the viewing of the
cherry blossom trees — which
bloom a magnificent pink and
white for a few precious days
before dying — to Ik* a tradi
tional reminder of the tran
sience of life. 'I he blossoms are
all gone in Golden Gate Park
by now, but the 27th annual
Northern California Cherry
Blossom Festival will last for a
while.
Rejoice, oh Japanophiles,
everything besides green
lizards with atomic breath will
make an appearance: bonsai,
flower arrangements, samurai
antiques, kotos, kimonos and
every species of sushi imagin
able. The festival features
dancers and taiko drummers
from Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka
and Nagano, shrine carriers
from Osaka and rice pounders
from Tochigi Prefecture.
Don't forget the film festi
val, a taiko drum concert fea
turing troupes from Japan, San
Francisco and Sacramento,
and a parade led by venerable
film actor Tatsuya Nakadai —
who played the grim, pensive
samurai in Akira Kurosawa's

finest films — from City Hall
to Japantown. Most events are
free, and take place at the
Japan Center, Post and
