# Fresh Choices
## A
						look at up-and-coming eateries around Stanford 
### 
Story by Beth Berselli and Allison Short

Are you sick of ordering
pizza? Looking for a restau
rant where you won't run
into half your freshman
dorm? Tired of ducking wait
ers to bring home a few
lousy muffins? Well, it's
time to give your tastebuds a
change and explore some of
the unique, quaint restau
rants which surround cam
pus. We found four "little
known" area restaurants,
each with a distinctive
atmosphere and culinary
style: China Delight, Portola
Valley Kitchen, The Country
Gourmet and Hearts Cafe. If
you're looking to get away
from the crowd and
encounter delicious, innova
tive food, these diamonds-in

the-rough will
be for you.

China Delight
203 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-6065

China Delight lives up to
its name â€” it is truly a
delight to dine at this 12-
table restaurant. Located in
an unobtrusive storefront on
University Ave., this eatery
provides a mellow atmos
phere, complete with flowery
wallpaper and lace curtains.
Walking through the door,
you can feel the stresses of
Stanford life melt away as
you prepare for a tasty
Chinese meal.
What's unique about
China Delight is its top
notch service. Upon entering
the door, we were seated at a
table and had menus in our

hands
with

in 10
seconds.
Many patrons of
China Delight are regulars

The restaurant
offers a tradi
tional menu of
Szechuan
Mandarin food,
with few sur
prises

who have established a
friendly rapport with the
staff. (A waitress and a cus
tomer held a lively discus
sion about the NCAA cham-

pion s hi p
playoffs as
we dined.)
On other
visits, the
personable
waitress has
offered a

soup or
appetizer free
of charge as we
looked over the
menu.
The restau-

rant offers a tradi
tional menu of

Szechuan Mandarin food,
with few surprises hut over
all excellent taste. Twelve
luncheon specials, which
include an appetizer,
steamed rice and soup, are
available for under $5. We
had the Chicken Chow Mein,
which may he touristy, but
nonetheless left us in culi
nary ecstasy. The Szechuan
Crispy Chicken's sweet,
crunchy morsels are compli
mented by a saltier dish
we liked the Beef with
Broccoli. With great service
and good, inexpensive food,
it's no wonder so many peo
ple keep coming back to
China Delight.

Portola Valley Kitchen
884 Portola Rd.
Portola Valley

If you are a seafood lover
and curious to experiment
with spicy Thai food, Portola
Valley Kitchen has a method
of uniquely combining these
two culinary genres and pro
ducing excellent results.
Portola Valley Kitchen is
situated in a rustic setting
on Portola Road about a 10-
minute drive or a long,
scenic bike ride from cam
pus.
