# Fresh Choices
## A 						look at up-and-coming eateries around Stanford 
### 
Story by Beth Berselli and Allison Short

Are you sick of ordering
pizza? Looking for a restau
rant where you won't run
into half your freshman
dorm? Tired of ducking wait
ers to bring home a few
lousy muffins? Well, it's
time to give your tastebuds a
change and explore some of
the unique, quaint restau
rants which surround cam
pus. We found four "little
known" area restaurants,
each with a distinctive
atmosphere and culinary
style: China Delight, Portola
Valley Kitchen, The Country
Gourmet and Hearts Cafe. If
you're looking to get away
from the crowd and
encounter delicious, innova
tive food, these diamonds-in

the-rough will
be for you.

China Delight
203 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-6065

China Delight lives up to
its name — it is truly a
delight to dine at this 12-
table restaurant. Located in
an unobtrusive storefront on
University Ave., this eatery
provides a mellow atmos
phere, complete with flowery
wallpaper and lace curtains.
Walking through the door,
you can feel the stresses of
Stanford life melt away as
you prepare for a tasty
Chinese meal.
What's unique about
China Delight is its top
notch service. Upon entering
the door, we were seated at a
table and had menus in our

hands

Many patrons of
China Delight are regulars

The restaurant
offers a tradi
tional menu of
Szechuan
Mandarin food,
with few sur
prises

who have established a
friendly rapport with the
staff. (A waitress and a cus
tomer held a lively discus
sion about the NCAA cham-

pion s hi p
playoffs as
we dined.)
On other
visits, the
personable
waitress has
offered a

soup or
appetizer free
of charge as we
looked over the
menu.
The restau-

rant offers a tradi
tional menu of

Szechuan Mandarin food,
with few surprises hut over
all excellent taste. Twelve
luncheon specials, which
include an appetizer,
steamed rice and soup, are
available for under $5. We
had the Chicken Chow Mein,
which may he touristy, but
nonetheless left us in culi
nary ecstasy. The Szechuan
Crispy Chicken's sweet,
crunchy morsels are compli
mented by a saltier dish
we liked the Beef with
Broccoli. With great service
and good, inexpensive food,
it's no wonder so many peo
ple keep coming back to
China Delight.

Portola Valley Kitchen
884 Portola Rd.
Portola Valley
851-3287

If you are a seafood lover
and curious to experiment
with spicy Thai food, Portola
Valley Kitchen has a method
of uniquely combining these
two culinary genres and pro
ducing excellent results.
Portola Valley Kitchen is
situated in a rustic setting
on Portola Road about a 10-
minute drive or a long,
scenic bike ride from cam
pus.
Inside the rather small


(lark restaurant, the restau
rant cultivates a country
image — with brick walls,
wood paneling and flowered
seat cushions. The crowd
appeared to be mainly locals
who were familiar with the
owners; not many young
people were present.
Although the menu seems
to specialize in dinner fare —
with its hefty seafood and
Thai specials — the restau
rant also serves lunch and a
special $9.95 Sunday
brunch.
For lunch, there are
soups, salads and sandwich
es, in addition to the seafood
and Thai dishes.
If you want a traditional
Thai lunch, the Portola fried
rice is a delicious combina
tion of rice, eggs, chicken
and vegetables. For some-

thing a little spicier but just

also a good bet

Most of the lunch items

are reasonably priced at
about $5 to $7.
The dinner menu is more
expensive ($10 to $15 per
platter) and probably not
priced for the typical college
student. Seafood dinner spe
cials include crab cakes and
fresh halibut. Recommended
Thai dishes include a chick
en dish simmered in green
curry with coconut milk, and
a mixture of seafood
in a hot chili sauce. If you
don't mind spending a few
extra bucks and are in y*

the mood for a
scenic bike

ride,

the Thai food is definitely
worth the trek.

The Midwest
sandwich, slices
of turkey breast,
melted Swiss
cheese, sprouts
and tomatoes
served hot, is
unusual but deli
cious

p]ven if the country charm
of this casual little eatery
doesn't win your heart, the
healthy and tasty meals will.
In addition to offering tradi
tionally healthy items, the
menu includes some more
exotic dishes — Lemon Mahi
Stirfry, Roasted Eggplant
Parmesan and Greek Salad
to name a few.
The Midwest sandwich
slices of turkey breast, melt
ed Swiss cheese, sprouts and
tomatoes served hot — is a
somewhat unusual combina
tion, hut is absolutely deli
cious. Considering

its monstrous size, it is well
worth the $5.45 price tag.
For dessert, the apple crisp
is a sure bet. With fresh
apples, real whipped cream
and a splash of brandy it's
scrumptious. Dinner spe
cials, including a still-gener
ous half-slice of lasagna
accompanied by a small
salad, please both the palate
and the pocketbook. Also,
try the featured pizza spe
cials for delicious and innov
ative combinations.
A medium-sized restau
rant, Country Gourmet pro
vides a pleasant ambiance,
furnished with paisley wall
paper, hanging plants and
quaint knick-knacks. The
patio seating is a nice treat.
Although it is a modified
self-service restaurant, the
service is still fast and
friendly.
Hearts Cafe
201 California Ave.
Palo Alto
322-1285
If you're feeling a bit
romantic, celebrating an
occasion or just want to
indulge yourself, Hearts is
the perfect place to splurge
for that special meal.
Also titled the Cuisina
Creativa, or creative kitchen,
Hearts sticks to this cre
ativeness with its wide vari
eties of pastas and Italian
specialties.

The name Hearts suits
the restaurant per-

fectly; this fuzzy,
romantic feel

is cap

tured in the pink wall behind
the quaint bar and the
homey, inviting atmosphere.
Besides the regular lunch
and dinner menus, Hearts
offers a unique breakfast on
the weekends which looks
tempting and is reasonably
priced at about $5 to $6. The
breakfast menu mainly con
sists of omelets — prepared

in 10 unusual ways. Other
items like ricotta cheese pan
cakes and fresh fruit are also
available.
For a typical lunch, the
prices are rather steep, espe
cially for busy students who
are unable to enjoy the
restaurant's ambiance for
very long. Sandwiches and
salads are around $7 and
pastas are slightly more
expensive.
The dinner menu seems
to be more inviting to cou
ples wishing to spend a quiet
evening together or for those
celebrating a special occa
sion.

After starting off
the meal with freshly
prepared garlic bread
with olive oil and moz-

zarella, choose between
several different types of
angel hair pasta or fet
tuccini dishes, which cost

at least $10.
Other entrees, like veal
piccata, filet mignon,
salmon and lobster fettucci
ni, are $12 and up.
If you and your date have

some extra cash and
are looking to
escape food service
and try some
authentic Italian
food, Hearts is the
wav to go.
