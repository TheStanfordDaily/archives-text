If you get hungry again
(you can come back here at
the end of the day) and
haven't yet exhausted the
credit limit on your Visa, try
Greens, arguably the City's
best vegetarian restaurants,
fucked in one of the ware
houses, Greens also has a
wonderful view of the Bay.
After enjoying a close-up
view of the Bay, head up
Divisidero for a great panora
ma. You'll pass by some beauti
fiil well-kept homes built at the
turn of the century. When you
reach Union Street, turn around
and look north â€” the view is
spectacular. Right now you're in
the heart of San Francisco's
Cow Hollow district.
Head east on Union.
After a couple blocks of beau
tiful refurbished Victorians,
you'll come upon a lovely
medley of small shops, bou
tiques, galleries, bistros and
cafes. Far from the bustling
crowds of Union Square, Cow
Hollow is an upscale yet
quaint place where you're sure
to sight some native City
dwellers.
If you're feeling frisky after
reading the adult fortune
cookies, stop in at Carol

l)oda's Champagne and
Lingerie Boutique at 1850
Union St., No. 1. Just like the
naughty fortune cookie shop,
this place is also tucked in a lit
tle alley, allx'it less dingy. Doda
was the woman who led the
movement to legalize topless
dancing in the 19605, when
she became the first woman to
bare her breasts as part of a
respectable nightclub show.
Other shops include
Culot's, a men's undergar
ments store; the Enchanted
Crystal, where for $20 they'll
make a miniature glass sculp
ture for you; Oggetti, an odor
iferous stationery store with
swirly "Florentine" papers;
and Bay Moon, which sells
jewelry handcrafted by
California artists.
When you get hungry,
you can stop at Bepples' Pies.
Try the chocolate mousse,
wild boysenberry or the
pecan, 'Fhey also have muffins
and meat pies. If you're more
in the mood for a latte, drop
into one of the numerous cof
fee houses that dot the street.
More fun places can be
found at 1980 Union. You
can't miss the "wedding hous
es," two identical Victorian
houses built by a man for his
two daughters who were get
ting married at the same time,
fry Aud's Fun Things for
postcards, lunny books, a
wind-up crab or a Matisse
poster. Stardust also has
unusual items.

After drinking a beer at
t he brass rail of the Union Ale
II ouse, downstairs from
Aud's, head over to dinner at
This restaurant fea
tures traditional Italian fare,
in a decidedly medieval set
ting. Waiters wear court cos
tumes, and the dining room
has wrought-iron light fixtures
and wooden benches. Even
the patrons can get dressed
up in crowns and jesters' hats.
If time permits, other
places you might want to
check out include The
Cartoon Art Museum at 665
3rd St. in the Print Center
Building. The museum will
teach you everything about
the history of cartoons.
Admission is $2 for students.
Call ahead, because it's cur
rently closed for renovations.
Nearby, on 3rd Street is
San Francisco's new Yerba
Gardens Complex. A multi
cultural, multi-media art cen
ter that features small muse
ums and galleries.
From the South of Market
area, you might want to head
into the Mission District,
where you can check out San
Francisco's oldest building,
Mission Dolores. Com
missioned by Junipero Serra
to honor St. Francis of Assisi,
this adobe building at 16th
and Dolores features beautiful
stained glass windows and
Native American paintings.
There is also a museum with
artifacts and a fascinating

cemetery.
Also in the Mission, at 444
DeHaro St., you can lour one
of the few remaining teddy
bear factories in the United
States at the Basic Brown
Bear Factory and Store.
Tours are offered on
Saturdays only, at 11 a.m. and
2 p.m.
In addition to a bevy of
small taquerias, the Mission
boasts Nicaragua, a hole-in
the-wall place with plastic
tablecloths, cheesy artwork
and delicious fried plantain
and cheese dinners. 'I"he food
is inexpensive.
Before heading back to
the Farm, stop in at one of the
city's late-night cafes in the
Mission. A number of the
trendy and hip coffee shops in
the area spotlight countercul
ture, and you're txuind to find
live music. Try Cafe Babar, at
995 Guerrero St.; Cafe Beano
at H7B Valencia; <>i Cafe
Istanbul, at 525 Valencia,
where they have l>elly dancing
on Wednesday and Saturday
nights and live music on
Fridays.
From this area, it's easy to
get back to Stanford. You can
pick up the 7K SamTrans bus
along Mission, or, by car,
head down Mission to Army
Street to catch 101 south.
With any luck, you'll return
with some interesting sou
venirs, a fully belly and a host
of wacky stories about "the
other" San Francisco.
