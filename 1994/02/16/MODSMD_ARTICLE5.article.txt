The ASSU Senate broke with tradition
last night by approving the placement of all
student group special-fee requests on this

still collect signatures to be placed on

designate a chair before the election.
Waldorf said the main motivation behind
his bill was not to "slam on the COP" but
simply to engender more executive account
ability.
But some senators and members of the
COP warned that the executive's responsi
