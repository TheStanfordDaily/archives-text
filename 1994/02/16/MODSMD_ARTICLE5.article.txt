# ASSU votes to put all fee requests on ballot
## 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate broke with tradition
last night by approving the placement of all
student group special-fee requests on this
spring's election ballot. But it also contin
ued its recent trend of delaying proposals
for reform in student government.
The senate passed the fee requests of 34
student groups, the first time since 1988
that all requests presented had been grant
ed placement on the ballot.
Student groups must receive over 50 per
cent approval from voters in order to receive
their requested funds.
Deliberations on fee requests involved lit
tle dispute last night, apart from some minor
changes in groups' budgets to comply with
fee-request rules in the ASSU constitution.
If a group's request had been denied, they
wuuld have had to collect signatures from
1,400 students to gain placement on the ballot.
Graduate senator Edward Sharp, how
ever, noted that any student group whose
special fee either did not appear on last

year's ballot or was rejected by voters must
still collect signatures to be placed on
April's ballot, regardless of the senate's de
cisions last night.
In other business, the senate debated a
bill authored by Senate Chair Greg Waldorf
to offer to voters a proposed constitutional
amendment that would replace the Council
of Presidents with two officials â€” a presi
dent and a vice president. But due to con
cerns voiced by several senators about the
workload of the executive branch, Waldorf
offered to amend the bill to provide simply
that a Council of Presidents slate clearly
designate a chair before the election.
Waldorf said the main motivation behind
his bill was not to "slam on the COP" but
simply to engender more executive account
ability.
But some senators and members of the
COP warned that the executive's responsi
bilities could not be handled by one person.
"I think it's overwhelming for one per
son to do a job that can be done by a whole
committee," said undergraduate
senator Lan Phan.
COP member Jason Snyder
noted that the COP must often
represent the students in meet
ings with University officials and
that one person would not have
time to fill the role.
"You really can't send a cabinet
member to an official function,"
Snyder said. "We have so many
meetings we divide between us . ..
. What we're talking about is a
more representative approach to
dealing with University officials."
Waldorf disagreed, saying
"knowing how much work I do as
(senate) chair, I can't believe a
president and a vice president
can't get this done."
However, as his main goal was
simply to introduce more
accountability, Waldorf offered to
alter his proposal to require only
that COP slates designate a chair
before election. Currently, COP
slates are required to designate a
chair only after they are elected.
The amended proposal is sched
uled to be voted on in two weeks,
and if approved by two-thirds of
the senate, will appear on the gen
eral election ballot this spring.
Undergraduate senator Gabe

Lucas subsequently attempted to
introduce a bill to the senate that
would call a special election for stu
dents to decide on a constitutional
amendment that would give the
senate authority to introduce dis
tricted representation for senators.
Lucas had previously introduced
a proposal that would have halved
the size of the senate and allowed
the students to choose from four
districting plans. That plan was
defeated last week amid criticisms
that it combined several distinct
issues into one vote and did not pro
vide clear choices to students.
According to ASSU rules, Lucas is
barred from re-introducing altered
versions of defeated amendments.
But Lucas said his bill was an
entirely new proposal. The new
measure would have moved elec
tions to the fall and allowed the
senate to propose districting ini
tiatives for the students to vote
on, but would not institute size
changes or the multiple-choice
format of Lucas' previous bill.
Waldorf, citing the judgments of
the senate parliamentarian, gradu
ate senator Sanford Dickert, said
Lucas' bill was essentially a revised
version of his previous bill and thus
could not be reconsidered.
Lucas expressed disappoint
ment with Waldorf s dismissal of
his bill and noted that Dickert had
been the chief opponent of his
previous bill.

Earlier, Snyder and fellow COP
member Ron Brown denied allega
tions that the COP had previous
knowledge of a tuition hike plan
adopted by the Board of Trustees
and had proposed an identical
plan to improve their image.
Senators brought up allega
tions that Snyder, who serves on
the trustees' committee on aca
demic policy, had attended a
meeting last year where a propos
al to keep tuition at 2 percent
above inflation was discussed.
The COP proposed before the
trustees' decision last week that
tuition hikes be held at 2 percent
above inflation for the next two
years. The trustees eventually
approved a 2 percent plus infla
tion increase for next year.
But Snyder said he was never
present at any meeting where
such a plan was discussed.
In response to a question from
Dickert as to why the COP
endorsed a 2 percent plus inflation
plan rather than a plan for a lower
increase, Snyder said the COP
wanted to propose a "realistic
number" that would be compatible
with the University's move toward
revenue-driven budgeting.
He added that the COP's long
term goal is to return tuitiop
increases to inflation and that the
two percent proposal was an
"incremental step in getting to
that point."
