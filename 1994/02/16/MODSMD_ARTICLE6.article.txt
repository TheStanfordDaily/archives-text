# East Palo Alto farm fights for its future
## 'Green Street Farm' faces financial woes 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Something strange is going
on at 857 Green Street in East
Palo Alto — the noise of chick
ens clucking sounds an unlikely
protest against wailing sirens in
the distance.
Leroy Musgraves, a 47-year
old former student of the Cre
ative Writing Program at Stan
ford, is taking the lessons he
learned as the son of Arkansas
sharecroppers and sharing them
with East Palo Alto students, ex
convicts from San Francisco and
anyone else willing to lend a
hand to work the soil.
Musgraves has taken a one
acre plot of land in the center of
an East Palo Alto residential
district and converted it into the

"Green Street Farm," complete
with 43 chickens.
But the future of the project,
which Musgraves started two
years ago, is in jeopardy.
Threatened by funding prob
lems, Musgraves had until yes
terday to come up with
$206,000 to buy the land.
Musgraves was able to work
out a temporary deal with the
help of $168,000 in donations and
loans from the community. He
hopes to pay back the rest of the
money in monthly installments,
but stressed that eventually all
the money must be paid back.
The owner of the land, Rev.
Lyrte Gully, does not want the
farm to close, according to Mus
graves, but she has had to pay

taxes on the land and is no longer
able to afford the loss.
Records of all donations are
being kept. "Just in case some
thing goes wrong, we'll send all
those people their checks back,"
Musgraves said. "We're not in the
clear yet."
The farm has yet to turn a
profit, but Musgraves said he
believes that the farm will become
profitable in about two years.
The farm is run as a for-profit
corporation, because Musgraves
refuses to take the tax shelters
available to non-profit groups. "I
cannot tell students to create
their own economic status when
we don't have it," Musgraves said.
Musgraves is also using his
writing skills to help the farm out
of its financial difficulty. An
album is being recorded which
features Musgraves' poetry along

with nutritional information.
Future profits will be used to
expand the operation and buy a
larger lot, while still keeping the
East Palo Alto site as a model,
Musgraves said.
Students from local schools
have come to the farm to learn
more than just how to work the
land. Musgraves believes that
basic skills such as reading and
mathematics can be taught
through farm work. "You have to
be able to read the back of a seed
packet," Musgraves said.
Other visitors to the farm have
included ex-convicts from San
Francisco and troubled youths.
Walking among the rows of
dirt, Musgraves points out rows of
young onions that were planted
by juvenile delinquents as part of
their court-mandated community
service.
While the Green Street Farm
must deal with the typical prob
lems of gophers and snails, other
problems are unique to the urban
location. "I've been in the garden

when bullets whizzed past me,"
Musgraves said.
Even with the shortcomings,
Musgraves stressed the unique
ness of having this agricultural
community in the middle of an
urban area. "This acre can pull
people from any metropolitan
area," Musgraves said.
Musgraves said he also hopes
to impart the lessons of nutrition
to the community. "My main
focus is to get African-American
people healthy," Musgraves said.
Everything on the farm is done by
hand, and no pesticides or herbi
cides are used.
East Palo Alto used to be filled
with small one-acre farms until
developers built homes on the lots
about 10 years ago, Musgraves said.
"This is great soil; it would be a
crime to cover this up with a
house," Musgraves said. "East
Palo Alto could survive on food
that is grown within its bound
aries."
The Green Street Farm has
grown corn, scarlet beans, green

beans, mustard, cabbage, green
onions, watermelons, almonds
and walnuts, among other crops.
The goods are sold through the
local farmer's market, as well as
to corporations and individuals.
Musgraves has tried to sell the
goods within the community, but
financial difficulties have forced
him to start looking outside East
Palo Alto for customers.
Musgraves started farming at
the age of four on his parents'
land. "Instead of playing cops and
robbers, we ployed farmers and
bridge builders," Musgraves said.
The chickens move toward
Musgraves, as he brings out the
feed bag. He tosses the grains to
the clucking horde, identifying
Rhode Island Red roosters from
Plymouth Boardrock hens.
"By the time I was seven, I
could pick the best cows for milk,"
Musgraves said, adding that he
also learned how to care for chick
ens and work the land efficiently.
"You learn how to do it because
you have to."

Palo Alto — the noise of chick
ens clucking sounds an unlikely
protest against wailing sirens in
the distance.
Leroy Musgraves, a 47-year
old former student of the Cre
ative Writing Program at Stan
ford, is taking the lessons he
learned as the son of Arkansas
sharecroppers and sharing them
with East Palo Alto students, ex
convicts from San Francisco and
anyone else willing to lend a
hand to work the soil.
Musgraves has taken a one
acre plot of land in the center of
an East Palo Alto residential
district and converted it into the

"Green Street Farm," complete
with 43 chickens.
But the future of the project,
which Musgraves started two
years ago, is in jeopardy.
Threatened by funding prob
lems, Musgraves had until yes
terday to come up with
$206,000 to buy the land.
Musgraves was able to work
out a temporary deal with the
help of $168,000 in donations and
loans from the community. He
hopes to pay back the rest of the
money in monthly installments,
but stressed that eventually all
the money must be paid back.
The owner of the land, Rev.
Lyrte Gully, does not want the
farm to close, according to Mus
graves, but she has had to pay

project two years ago to teach others how to farm.
taxes on the land and is no longer
able to afford the loss.
Records of all donations are
being kept. "Just in case some
thing goes wrong, we'll send all
those people their checks back,"
Musgraves said. "We're not in the
clear yet."
The farm has yet to turn a
profit, but Musgraves said he
believes that the farm will become
profitable in about two years.
The farm is run as a for-profit
corporation, because Musgraves
refuses to take the tax shelters
available to non-profit groups. "I
cannot tell students to create
their own economic status when
we don't have it," Musgraves said.
Musgraves is also using his
writing skills to help the farm out
of its financial difficulty. An
album is being recorded which
features Musgraves' poetry along

with nutritional information.
Future profits will be used to
expand the operation and buy a
larger lot, while still keeping the
East Palo Alto site as a model,
Musgraves said.
Students from local schools
have come to the farm to learn
more than just how to work the
land. Musgraves believes that
basic skills such as reading and
mathematics can be taught
through farm work. "You have to
be able to read the back of a seed
packet," Musgraves said.
Other visitors to the farm have
included ex-convicts from San
Francisco and troubled youths.
Walking among the rows of
dirt, Musgraves points out rows of
young onions that were planted
by juvenile delinquents as part of
their court-mandated community
service.
While the Green Street Farm
must deal with the typical prob
lems of gophers and snails, other
problems are unique to the urban
location. "I've been in the garden

when bullets whizzed past me,"
Musgraves said.
Even with the shortcomings,
Musgraves stressed the unique
ness of having this agricultural
community in the middle of an
urban area. "This acre can pull
people from any metropolitan
area," Musgraves said.
Musgraves said he also hopes
to impart the lessons of nutrition
to the community. "My main
focus is to get African-American
people healthy," Musgraves said.
Everything on the farm is done by
hand, and no pesticides or herbi
cides are used.
East Palo Alto used to be filled
with small one-acre farms until
developers built homes on the lots
about 10 years ago, Musgraves said.
"This is great soil; it would be a
crime to cover this up with a
house," Musgraves said. "East
Palo Alto could survive on food
that is grown within its bound
aries."
The Green Street Farm has
grown corn, scarlet beans, green

beans, mustard, cabbage, green
onions, watermelons, almonds
and walnuts, among other crops.
The goods are sold through the
local farmer's market, as well as
to corporations and individuals.
Musgraves has tried to sell the
goods within the community, but
financial difficulties have forced
him to start looking outside East
Palo Alto for customers.
Musgraves started farming at
the age of four on his parents'
land. "Instead of playing cops and
robbers, we ployed farmers and
bridge builders," Musgraves said.
The chickens move toward
Musgraves, as he brings out the
feed bag. He tosses the grains to
the clucking horde, identifying
Rhode Island Red roosters from
Plymouth Boardrock hens.
"By the time I was seven, I
could pick the best cows for milk,"
Musgraves said, adding that he
also learned how to care for chick
ens and work the land efficiently.
"You learn how to do it because
you have to."
