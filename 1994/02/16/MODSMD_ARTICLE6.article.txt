# East Palo Alto farm fights for its future
## 'Green Street Farm' faces financial woes 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Something strange is going
on at 857 Green Street in East
Palo Alto — the noise of chick
ens clucking sounds an unlikely
protest against wailing sirens in
the distance.
Leroy Musgraves, a 47-year
old former student of the Cre
ative Writing Program at Stan
ford, is taking the lessons he
learned as the son of Arkansas
sharecroppers and sharing them
with East Palo Alto students, ex
convicts from San Francisco and
anyone else willing to lend a
hand to work the soil.
Musgraves has taken a one
acre plot of land in the center of
an East Palo Alto residential
district and converted it into the

"Green Street Farm," complete
with 43 chickens.
But the future of the project,
which Musgraves started two
years ago, is in jeopardy.
Threatened by funding prob
lems, Musgraves had until yes
terday to come up with
$206,000 to buy the land.
Musgraves was able to work
out a temporary deal with the
help of $168,000 in donations and
loans from the community. He
hopes to pay back the rest of the
money in monthly installments,
but stressed that eventually all
the money must be paid back.
The owner of the land, Rev.
Lyrte Gully, does not want the
farm to close, according to Mus
graves, but she has had to pay

Leroy Musgraves, a former Stegner creative writing fellow at Stanford, gives water to
the chickens at the Green Street Farm in East Palo Alto. Musgraves started the farming
project two years ago to teach others how to farm.
