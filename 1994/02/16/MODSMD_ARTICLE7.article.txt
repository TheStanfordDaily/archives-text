Congressmen should spend more
time with their constituents and be
held responsible for their actions, say
the experts who participated in the
panel discussions at the Hoover Insti
tution Conference on Congressional
Accountability yesterday.
Former Attorney General and
Hoover Fellow Edwin Meese, Rep.
David Dreier, Senior Hoover Fellow
Henry Rowen, UC-Berkeley Political
Science Prof. Nelson Polsby and Wash
ington Post reporter Tom Edsall dis

cussed Congress' need to improve itself
in a panel discussion on changing rules
to make the House of Representatives
more accountable.
The discussion was preceded by a
panel considering term limits, all part

limits would vary with the level of leg

length of terms would result in ama

"Term limits won't create an ama
teur Congress, yet just as I wouldn't
want to be treated by amateur doctors,
I don't want amateurs dealing with our
Congress," said Political Science Prof.
Douglas Rivers.
Although the panel was divided on
the benefits of term limits, experts in
the discussion on changing congres

sional rules agreed that members of the
House of Representatives should spend
more time with their constituents
rather than spending the majority of
their time in session in Washington.
Dreier stated that congressmen
should be held responsible for their ac
tions through more open forums, even
tually leading to a better balance be
tween Republicans and Democrats in
the House.
Although Dreier agreed that Con

that it is "important for us not to bash
