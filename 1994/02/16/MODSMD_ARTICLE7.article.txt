# Experts push for more accountability in Congress
## 
### Elissa Lee Staff writer 
Congressmen should spend more
time with their constituents and be
held responsible for their actions, say
the experts who participated in the
panel discussions at the Hoover Insti
tution Conference on Congressional
Accountability yesterday.
Former Attorney General and
Hoover Fellow Edwin Meese, Rep.
David Dreier, Senior Hoover Fellow
Henry Rowen, UC-Berkeley Political
Science Prof. Nelson Polsby and Wash
ington Post reporter Tom Edsall dis

cussed Congress' need to improve itself
in a panel discussion on changing rules
to make the House of Representatives
more accountable.
The discussion was preceded by a
panel considering term limits, all part
of a three-day conference at Hoover on
the effectiveness of elected officials.
Bruce Cain, a political science pro
fessor at UC-Berkeley, compared term
limits to "ink-blot tests" during the
first discussion, which was taped to be
shown at a later date on the Public
Broadcasting System. "You can tell
more about yourself than about term
limits," Cain said.

According to Cain, the effect of term
limits would vary with the level of leg
islature and the length of the limit.
Cain sided with opponents of term lim
its, stating that limitations on the
length of terms would result in ama
teur and inexperienced politicians.
"Term limits won't create an ama
teur Congress, yet just as I wouldn't
want to be treated by amateur doctors,
I don't want amateurs dealing with our
Congress," said Political Science Prof.
Douglas Rivers.
Although the panel was divided on
the benefits of term limits, experts in
the discussion on changing congres

sional rules agreed that members of the
House of Representatives should spend
more time with their constituents
rather than spending the majority of
their time in session in Washington.
Dreier stated that congressmen
should be held responsible for their ac
tions through more open forums, even
tually leading to a better balance be
tween Republicans and Democrats in
the House.
Although Dreier agreed that Con
gress is in need of change, he stated
that it is "important for us not to bash
it but work as diligently as we can
to improve it."
The larger issue that the pan
els dealt with was government's
size and authority.
Meese discussed the imbalance

of power between state and federal
government. "Congress spends
time on the regulation of the most
minute degree instead of focusing
on national issues," said Meese.
"Congress should be restored to its
original service â€” public policy."
The panel on changing rules
discussed the government's large
role in providing aid to earthquake
victims in Southern California.

According to Dreier, although the
government encouraged the pur
chasing of private insurance, it is a
knee-jerk reaction to turn to the
government for help.
As a congressman representing
the Claremont area, Dreier did
vote for federal aid for his con
stituents, but he said he sees the
need for limiting government.
"The more power you have the

more restraint you have to use,"
Meese agreed.
Panel discussions on strength
ening political parties and cam
paign finance were held earlier
during the day. The conference
ends tomorrow morning with a
panel on congressional reform.
It is being attended by approxi
mately 30 experts on congression
al reform and political science.
