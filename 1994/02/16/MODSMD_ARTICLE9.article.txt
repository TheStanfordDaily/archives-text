# Daily named state's top college paper
## 
### 
For the second year in a row, The Stanford
Daily earned honors as the best student newspa
per at a four-year California college.
The award for "general excellence," given by
the California Newspaper Publishers Association,
was announced at the Association's 108 th Annu
al Convention at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly
Hills, Calif, on Saturday.
The Daily was selected from among 10 entries
in the four-year colleges category. Second place
was awarded to The Daily Nexus, the newspaper
for the University of California at Santa Barbara.
In addition to categories for four-year and two

year colleges, nearly 400 daily and weekly news
papers from around the state were judged in more
than 20 news and advertising categories.
Participants in the collegiate categories sub
mitted newspapers from three consecutive publi
cation days between September 1992 through
August 1993. The Daily's entry included coverage
of the 1992 elections.
The Daily won the award last year for its cov
erage of the campus and area reaction to the Rod
ney King beating verdict in April 1992, and also in
1990 for its coverage of Mikhail Gorbachev's first
visit to campus.
