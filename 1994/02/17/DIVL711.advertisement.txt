STROME-SUSSKiND
& COMPANY
Financial Analyst position
(for Bachelors degree candidates)
What is Strume-Suskind & Co.?
Strome Susskind is a hedge fund manager. We currently have approximately $1 billion under
management in our investment partnerships. The amount under management has grown rapidly
from the firm's inception, which was a little under two years ago. The historical investment
performance of our principals has been first-rate; for 1993, we have generated an investment
return of over 160% in our main fund.
The partnerships invest primarily in publicly traded securities, although we also make private
placement investments and venture capital investments. We invest in a variety of markets (stocks,
bonds, currencies, etc.) worldwide, and will take long positions as well as sell short. We employ
leverage and derivative products to increase our exposure and/or hedge our risks.
What role will Analysts play at Strome-Susskind?
We need people to work under the guidance of a senior analyst to conduct extensive fundamental
research into our investment ideas. We invest our partners' money aggressively and in a relatively
concentrated fashion. Accordingly, we conduct extensive due diligence before committing capital.
An Analyst's responsibilities will primarily involve researching industries and analyzing companies'
competitive positions. This research would entail analyzing financial statements, building
computer models, screening stocks, interviewing Wall Street analysts, and questioning company
representatives and industry participants. An Analyst may also analyze specific markets,
commodities, countries, and other investments that offer high potential returns.
An Analyst's compensation will be based on the firm 's results and the Analyst's direct contribution.
Compensation will be competitive with investment banking and management consulting positions.
What qualifications are required?
Candidates must be bright, very hard working, and have a minimum GPA of 3.5. Analysts must
also be capable of directing their own work, while working under the guidance of a Senior Analyst.
A strong knowledge of accounting and financial statement analysis as well as a genuine interest in
investing are essential.
