# Report shows faculty favor failing grade
## 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
About 75 percent of faculty support making acad
emic transcripts more detailed and bringing back a
failing grade, according to a report scheduled for pre
sentation at today's Faculty Senate meeting.
The annual report from the Committee on Acade
mic Appraisal and Achievement includes information
from a 1993 faculty survey on grading.
Of the more than 700 respondents, the report
reads, about three in four favored "a more 'historical'
transcript" that might include dropped or retaken
classes. About the same number felt "failing perfor
mances" should be recorded on transcripts.
The committee will likely propose a change in the
format of transcripts in the future, said Geology Prof.
Gail Mahood, chair of the committee. But, Mahood
stressed, it is too early to tell whether the committee
will propose that the "F" grade be reinstated.
Indeed, there are no proposals up for a vote tomor
row, and Mahood said the committee is "still actively
discussing" the survey results and their implications.
Still, Mahood said the commit
tee will soon propose a move to a
more historical transcript. Such a
document would list more infor
mation than the current student
transcripts, which Mahood called
"records of achievement."
The difference between the two
types of transcript is that the cur
rent form only lists a student's
academic successes, whereas a
more historical transcript could
include, for example, notations for

classes a student drops or retakes.
Mahood said the committee is still
discussing exactly what changes
to propose.
"The faculty have expressed a
desire to move toward the histori
cal record," Mahood said. "We will
come up with recommendations
that will lead to a fnore historical
transcript."
Mahood said the committee
will make proposals for action at
the April 28 senate meeting, when
the full, final results of the faculty
survey are presented.
A vote on any proposal is tenta
tively scheduled for the May 26
meeting.

In addition to the survey, the
committee's annual report sug
gests that the senate should
examine whether Stanford should
require transfer students to live
on campus for two years before
graduation. Currently, a student
can have 45 units of advanced
placement credit and 90 units of
transfer credit, and so could spend
just one year on campus before
graduation.
The senate is also scheduled to
vote today on guidelines for inter
disciplinary academic programs.
The proposal standardizes the
way such academic programs are
set up and reviewed.
