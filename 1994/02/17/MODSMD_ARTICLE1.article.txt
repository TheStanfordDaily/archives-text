# Report shows faculty favor failing grade

### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
About 75 percent of faculty support making acad
emic transcripts more detailed and bringing back a
failing grade, according to a report scheduled for pre
sentation at today's Faculty Senate meeting.
The annual report from the Committee on Acade
mic Appraisal and Achievement includes information
from a 1993 faculty survey on grading.
Of the more than 700 respondents, the report
reads, about three in four favored "a more 'historical'
transcript" that might include dropped or retaken
classes. About the same number felt "failing perfor
mances" should be recorded on transcripts.
The committee will likely propose a change in the
format of transcripts in the future, said Geology Prof.
Gail Mahood, chair of the committee. But, Mahood
stressed, it is too early to tell whether the committee
will propose that the "F" grade be reinstated.
Indeed, there are no proposals up for a vote tomor
row, and Mahood said the committee is "still actively
discussing" the survey results and their implications.
