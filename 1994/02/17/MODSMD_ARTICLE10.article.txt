# Hoover meeting concludes
## Panelists discuss congressional accountability 
### Jose Jesus Gutierrez Staff writer 
The Hoover Institution concluded its
three-day Conference on Congressional
Accountability yesterday by attempting
to identify "what Congress has done to
reform itself â€” an inquiry some pan
elists suggested lacked a clear-cut
response.
Political Science Prof. Barry R.
Weingast, also a senior fellow at
Hoover, moderated yesterday's panel,
which included Thomas E. Mann, direc
tor of the governmental studies pro
gram at the Brookings Institution;
David Dreier, U.S. Representative and
Ranking Minority Member from Cali
fornia; and UC-Berkeley Political Sci
ence Prof. Nelson W. Polsby, also Direc
tor of the Institute of Governmental
Studies.
The three panelists unanimously
agreed that Congress must undergo
reform, but indicated that congression
al modification plans often fall short of
public expectations. As a result, the
panel focused much of its attention on
ways to further improve congressional
operations.
"The American people don't want a
little change around the edges," Dreier
said.
In response, Mann said the public's
wants "mismatch" those of Congress,
and that citizens should provide con
structive suggestions that may
strengthen Congress instead of weak
ening the institution with negative cri
tiques.

Polsby said the public "doesn't give a
flying fig" about what's actually going on
in Congress. "People want reform, but
they show they don't know or care about
the structure of Congress," he said.
Because of the lack of public partici
pation, the panelists suggested that
external change must come before
internal change; citizens should be
involved by establishing a balance
between their political awareness and
their criticisms.
Although it is imperative for the
public to acquire knowledge of the
issues, the panel cautioned that it must
do so carefully. Mann said people are
too often exposed only to one-sided
media reports and "30-second TV
blurbs" that tend to degrade Congress.
Furthermore, Mann said the "salary
increases, the fraud cases" that are
being exposed "create an impression
about the institution as a whole that is
not very well connected to how the
place works, what its purposes are, or
what the constitutional design is."
However, according to the panelists,
the problems do not end once the public is
educated. Dreier said the internal strug
gles between the majority parties hinder
any minority party attempts at change.
"[The Reform Committee] tried three
times to enact bills, however, each one
was rejected [by the majority group]."
Besides the obvious need for cooper
ation between the two groups, other
major changes mentioned included the
reduction of congressional staff and the
need for parallelism between the House
and the Senate.
