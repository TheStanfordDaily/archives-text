A photo on the back page of yesterday's Daily was incorrectly
identified as Stephen Walker, a former State Department official.
In fact, the photo was of Bosnian charge d'affaires Sven Alkalaj,
who also spoke at Bosni-Aid on Tuesday evening.
An article on library restructuring in Monday's Daily inaccu
rately quoted Michael Keller as saying that "three quarters of the
questions asked at the reference desk are directional questions."
According to Keller, he actually stated that "about 25 percent of
the queries are those which subject specialists might best handle,
25 percent are questions which require the attentions of trained
and experienced reference staff using multiple reference sources,
25 percent are quick, easy answer questions which can be handled
by a single source, and the remainder are basically directional."
