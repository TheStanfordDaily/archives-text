# Unidentified man uses housing for free

While most Stanford students gasp
at their quarterly housing bill, one
enterprising person found a way to
live in both Branner Hall and Gover
nor's Corner for free.
A 24- or 25-year-old white man,
who went by the alias of Paul Zim
merman, defrauded the University of
$422 in rent by claiming to be a visit
ing scholar.
According to Jody Nyberg, residen
tial office coordinator at Branner, the
man told her that he was working on a
paper as a guest of the Political Sci
ence Department.
He asked to stay for three days in
the guest room at Branner, beginning
Jan. 27. The room is normally rented
to guests who have a Stanford affilia
tion, Nyberg said.
"I believed him â€” he had all the

right words, rang all the right bells,"
Nyberg said.
The lodger was wearing a dark
three-piece suit and prescription
glasses. "He dressed the part," Stan
ford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said.
While it is normal procedure to pay
at check-in, the suspect told Nyberg
that the Political Science Department
would be paying the bill and offered to
take the invoice to the department.
Nyberg said she asked the "schol
ar" about payment, but he made
excuses about not being able to leave
because of problems with passport
documents.
She then checked with the Political
Science Department and confronted
the impostor with his unpaid bill and
lack of department affiliation in a
series of notes. When Nyberg threat
ened to enter the apartment and con
fiscate his belongings on Feb. 7, the

man disappeared.
He then allegedly went to Stern
Hall. Employees referred him to Gov
ernor's Corner because there was no
room, according to Niemeyer.
At Governor's Corner the man
used a different alias and said he was
obtaining a room for his parents, said
Sharon Wong, residential office coor
dinator at Governor's Corner.
The man said he did not have his
wallet with him and would pay later,
Wong said.
After two nights Wong said she
entered the room to collect payment,
but instead found it vacated with the
key lying on the table.
Niemeyer said that the descriptions
of the suspect given at both Branner
and Governor's Corner match.
Police are searching for a single
suspect described as a 5 foot 4 to 6
inch male with a medium build and
brown hair.
