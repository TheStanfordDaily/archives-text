# Library director explains Green restructuring
## 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
University Library Director
Michael Keller explained details of
the proposed plan to reorganize
Green Library's general reference
materials and answered faculty ques
tions in a well-attended meeting yes
terday with the History Department.
The meeting was called to address
faculty concerns about the restruc
turing, which proposes to split the
library's resources between a human
ities / special sections collection and a
social sciences center.
Faculty had previously expressed

concern that the changes would be
unfriendly to undergraduates and too
expensive.
Keller called his discussion with
the history professors "a very pleas
ant talk" in which he explained "the
motivation for the plan" and took fac
ulty through the blueprints of the
prospective renovations.
Professors then had a chance to
pose questions on everything from
the breakdown of costs to the possi
bility of making the process of book
renewal at Green electronic.
"Essentially, he gave us the pic
ture of a new building that's going to
be very exciting," said Prof. David

Kennedy, chair of the History Depart
ment.
Kennedy said the meeting was
"very helpful" in enabling faculty to
better understand what the changes
will entail.
"He significantly reduced [con
cerns]," said Kennedy.
However, he added that he "didn't
think there was a particularly high
level of concern in the department in
the first place."
Keller also said he felt the discus
sion was positive. "It's always posi
tive to sit down with faculty and stu
dents and talk about what irks
them," he said.
