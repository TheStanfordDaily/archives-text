Haitian leader to return
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The State
Department implored exiled Haitian
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide yester
day to meet with parliamentarians who
are promoting a plan to restore him to
office.
Aristide already has dismissed the
proposal as irresponsible and has
declined to meet with the Haitian parlia
mentarians since last Friday.
State Department spokeswoman
Christine Shelly touted the plan and sug

gested there was concern among officials
that Aristide was frittering away an
opportunity to end Haiti's political
impasse.
The proposal "has some very positive
elements in it," she said. "We certainly
would still like to see the Haitian parlia
mentarians actually sit down in a face
to-face meeting with President Aristide."
The parliamentarians have been here
for more than a week and met yesterday
with Under Secretary of State Peter
Tarnoff and other senior administration
officials.
