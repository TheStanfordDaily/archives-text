SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) â€” Bosnian Serbs besieging Sarajevo
have pledged for the first time to remove
their heavy guns or put them under U.N.
control by NATO's deadline, U.N. com
manders said yesterday.
"We do have guarantees from the
Bosnian Serb side," Gen. Jean Cot, chief
of U.N. peacekeeping forces in former
Yugoslavia.
NATO threatened last week to send
jet fighters to attack any howitzers, mor
tars or anti-aircraft guns not withdrawn
from the hills overlooking the battered
city by Sunday midnight.

U.N. troops will surround weapons
that cannot be moved due to snow and
the weapons will be made inoperable,
Clinton officials said.
A cease-fire was declared a week ago
and U.N. peacekeepers have been dicker
ing with Bosnian Serb forces over about
500 heavy weapons menacing the city
from the snow-covered slopes.
But Cot said he had obtained "guaran
tees" from the Bosnian Serb and that the
outgunned Muslim-led Bosnian army
defending Sarajevo also promised to turn
in its heavy weapons.
"There are guarantees that as of the

20th of February, weapons from the Serb
side and the Bosnian side will be under
our control," Cot said.
The NATO alliance reaffirmed its ulti
matum at a meeting of NATO envoys
yesterday in Brussels, Belgium.
There were few outward signs of com
pliance. U.N. officials confirmed no new
weapons had been placed under their
control since Sunday, when 36 were
reported to have been surrendered.
Both sides have generally lived up to
the truce around Sarajevo, but military
commanders in Bosnia are notorious for
reneging on promises.
