# U.S. embargo impedes Cuba

GENEVA (AP) â€” Rather than helping
bring change to Cuba, the U.S. embargo is
impeding the communist government's tenta
tive efforts to open up the economy and intro
duce political reforms, according to a U.N.
report released yesterday.
The report by human rights investigator
Carl-Johan Groth of Sweden said excessive
control by Cuban authorities continued to lead
to a systematic violation of basic rights like
freedom of expression.
Groth submitted the 34-page report yester
day to the U.N. Human Rights Commission. It
was based mainly on interviews with exiles and
rights groups in the United States and on writ
ten testimony from organizations inside Cuba.
Cuba refused to admit the investigator,

arguing the mission was illegal and politically
motivated by U.S. pressure.
The study listed dozens of people jailed, and
cited estimates that the Caribbean nation held
2,000 to 5,000 political prisoners.
Timid reforms introduced by Castro in a bid
to shore up the collapsing economy faced polit
ical opposition from within the government,
the report said.
But it held that the economic embargo
imposed by the United States more than 30
years ago also blocks change and makes
reforms far more expensive.
"The embargo ... is creating political barri
ers to more far-reaching action at a time when
the urgent reactivation of the economy is neces
sary from a humanitarian standpoint," it said.
