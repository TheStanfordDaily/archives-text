# Compensation battle for veterans declines
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - American
soldiers can reach remote hot spots
within days or even hours, but many
wait years to get hearings on injuries
they might have suffered.
The Veterans Affairs Department
acknowledges it is now losing the battle
of coping with the tens of thousands of
new claims for compensation and pen
sions coming in every year. Four years
ago the backlog of pending claims was
377,000. By the end of fiscal year 1995,
the VA estimates it could hit 870,000.
On average, it takes more than 200

days to get an initial compensation
claim processed, and then more than
two years to get a decision from the
Board of Veterans Appeals.
VA Secretary Jesse Brown said the
backlog "remains one of the foremost
concerns" in the Veterans Benefits
Administration, predicting that claims
completed will actually decline in the
immediate future because of new legal
requirements and the more complex
nature of today's claims.
Veterans' groups are up in arms
over the delays. "We believe that a cri

sis situation, approaching a state of
emergency, currently exists in VA's
Compensation and Pension Service,"
Joseph Violante of Disabled American
Veterans testified before Congress.
Appeals board delays "have become
unconscionable and intolerable."
John Hanson of the American
Legion said other issues "must not be
allowed to overshadow the true crisis"
in the claims process and"the impact
this is having on the lives of tens of
thousands of veterans and their fami
lies."
