Libraries' restructuring
could lower quality and
inconvenience students

ON THE LOWER level of
Green Library, amid loom
ing, darkened stacks, Stan
ford students feel the chill of fear
in their hearts.
They know their search for "the
right book" could take hours, even
days of jogging up and down the
huge reading areas in Green.
The Faculty Senate's Committee
on Libraries' recent proposal for
restructuring the library system
will likely keep students running,
and could reduce the efficiency and
harm the reputation of Stanford's
libraries.
All in the name of budget cuts.
Stanford's libraries have taken a
severe budgetary beating in the last
few years. The libraries have been
slapped with a 25 percent cut from
1990 to 1993 — their current oper
ating budget is $24 million. Faced
with serious staff reductions, the
libraries began to scramble to find
new ways of operating without
compromising quality.
The question is whether that is
possible.
A new restructuring plan calls
for a split between a humanities
and special collections center and a
social sciences resources center in
Green. The two centers would be on
two different floors in the Green
West area, currently shut down
because of damage from the 1989
Loma Prieta Earthquake. Other
changes include shifting an Infor
mation Center into the card catalog
area and replacing the first floor
reference area with current periodi
cals.
Under the new plan, Meyer will
be turned into a giant media center,
moving the reserves to Green as
well.
Faculty members have voiced
concerns over the splitting of the
library into two different areas. One

faculty member said the new system
could be "formidable and forbid
ding."
Many areas of study cross the line
between humanities and social sci
ences. Students looking for different
resources will likely be sent dashing
from one floor to another if the ref
erence areas are not unified.
Also, universities are often judged
by the quality of their libraries, liter
ally the "storage places of knowl
edge" for institutions which search
for new knowledge.
Yet, libraries are easy targets for
budget crimping in times of financial
crisis, and most students can't be
distracted from their daily activities
to defend the library system.
But this is an issue which should
have student input, since many stu
dents regularly frequent libraries.
Karen Nagy, director for academic
information services for the
libraries, said that there was "a lot of
consultation" and that the plan was
presented "to the Faculty Senate
and to the University Cabinet." Still,
students seemed wholly unaware of
the changes until they were
announced as a definite plan. How
many students attend Faculty Sen
ate and University Cabinet meet
ings?
A more student-inclusive plan
ning process may have given the pro
ject directors a better idea of what
students wanted. Currently one or
two student representatives sit on
the Faculty Senate's Committee on
Libraries. But this voice is not
enough. Planners should solicit
more input from students through
surveys, which could be distributed
at the libraries, to find out what is
the best way to balance access and
budget efficiency.
Everyone gets hurt during budget
cutting, as we're finding out now.
But Stanford libraries should be at
the bottom of the list of "creative
restructuring," especially after they
have already suffered a 25 percent
cut in their budget. Overhauling the
system risks a lower quality library
and unhappy students and faculty.
Sometimes restructuring may not
be the answer.
