# Waste disposal incident hinders talks with EPA
## 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
Two bags of improperly disposed chemical waste
discovered at the Stanford Medical Center last week
are the latest in a series of problems with the Univer
sity's handling of hazardous materials.
While stories differ on the exact nature of the inci
dent, Harvey Chock, the University's associate direc
tor of health and safety, said this may affect the set
tlement currently being negotiated between Stanford
and state agencies over past health and safety viola
tions.
Two technicians transporting bags of medical
waste from the Stanford Medical Center to the Envi
ronmental Safety Facility last Thursday noticed that
two of the bags actually contained hazardous chemi
cal and radioactive waste, according to Gary Schell, a
Stanford health and safety engineer.
Schell said that contrary to proper safety proce
dures, the bags were opened and searched for infor
mation that would identify their source. When he
found out what had happened, Schell said he notified
county health and safety authorities, who told him to
quarantine the bags.
While Chock acknowledged that the bags con
tained "some flammable and corrosive materials and
some poisons," he said investigators had not as yet
uncovered any radioactive materi
al, though the investigation is
ongoing.
Chock said one of the bags was
already ripped and the other was
opened because management
wanted to identify the source of
the waste immediately.
"It was a problem at our facili
ty; we wanted to handle it right
away," Chock said. "The proce
dures we followed were sound."
Chock said last week's improp
er disposal incident was "relative
ly isolated" but admitted that it
"reflects a couple failures in our
safety systems," which he said are
currently under review.
However, Schell — who is
involved in a lawsuit against the
University alleging that he suf
fered negative repercussions for
trying to improve Stanford's com
pliance with health and safety

regulations — said this most
recent incident was indicative of
health and safety problems that
have plagued Stanford over the
past six years.
Allan Hirsch, a spokesman for
the California Department of
Toxic Substances Control, said it
is unclear how the most recent
incident might affect the settle
ment currently being negotiated
over more than 50 environmen
tal, health and safety violations
from as far back as 1988.
The University and the state
are close to a final settlement in
their negotiations, Hirsch said,
adding that he hopes to reach an
agreement "within a matter of
weeks."
He said the settlement will
include agreements "both on the
final steps [the University needs]
to take to come back into compli
ance and also a financial penalty."
Hirsch could not estimate the
amount of the fine but said the
violations "have been quite exten
sive. . . . We feel that the penalty

would have to be fairly signifi
cant."
But Jim Blarney, a hazardous
materials specialist for the Santa
Clara County Department of
Environmental Health, said Stan
ford's violations have been "typi
cally paperwork violations landl
smaller violations" and did not
constitute a serious problem.
Lawrence Gibbs, Stanford's
Director of Environmental
Health and Safety, said negotia
tions have resulted in significant
progress toward resolution. But
Gibbs said the process has not
been easy.
"The dilemma that everyone is
facing," Gibbs said, "is that we're
dealing with interpretation of reg
ulations" that were designed for
an industrial environment rather
than a laboratory environment
like Stanford's.
He said that despite the diffi
culty of applying the regulations,
"our goal is to be compliant [and
tol ensure that there's clarity on
what's required."
