## Escaping a jock's identity 
### 
DURING ONE of the past sum
mers, I read an article about a
professional football player who
had committed suicide. A veteran of
several years, he had been traded and
failed to make his new team. His peers
talked about how great a player he had
been. One of his former coaches
praised his skills, saying that "he was
football."
Suicide is extreme, but athletic iden
tity-crippling occurs constantly —
especially at a place like Stanford,
where so many people have played a
sport at one time or another. Athletics
are extraordinarily addictive to those
who participate in them seriously.
Ultimately, a good number of athletes
are left unbalanced, no longer loving
the sports they once enjoyed, and
unable to step away to find out who
they really are.
From a young age, children are
taught about the glory of athletics, and
gravitate toward it like gold. I did. Wal
ter Payton, Dave "Home Run or Strike
Out" Kingman, Magic — they were my
idols, and I wanted to do what they did.
I got my chance. I played soccer for
14 years, and gradually became a fairly
accomplished player. I played all year
round, at the most competitive level I
could. As I grew older, I got even more
into it. I woke up mornings, hours
before school, to run and practice more.
By the time I was a senior in high

school, I was two things to my peers —
a brain and an athlete. I did exception
ally well and people appreciated my
accomplishments. I walked around
with my head high — perhaps with a bit
of arrogance.
It was one of the most unhappy
times of my life. I had a vague sense
that my identity had essentially become
two-dimensional, but was unsure what
to do about it. Simultaneously, I had
lost my love for soccer. Playing had
become more of a crutch than anything
else. It made me feel good about myself,
so I did it.
When I arrived at Stanford, I half
heartedly decided to try out for the soc
cer team. I knew that L had lost the
drive to excel, but I had no choice. Soc
cer was who I was. When tryouts were
over, I found myself without the one
thing that had defined a good portion of
my life. The respect others gave me and
the confidence I had in myself vanished.
Looking back, I don't think it was ever
really there.
So I spent my freshman year in a
stupor, mourning my lack of stature
and direction, and envying the athletes
around me that I thought had it. To
compensate for my insecurity, I tried to
be more arrogant. I also became more
depressed. Academically, I felt lost and
unmotivated. Everything started to
come apart. By the beginning of my
sophomore year, I knew that I had a lot

of problems that soccer had kept me
from facing, and that I needed to deal
with them.
Confronting those fears was far and
away the most difficult challenge I ever
had to facc. None of the struggles 1 had
as an athlete even came close. With soc
cer, I could always improve my game
with extra practice. When it came to my
identity, there was no simple regimen I
could follow.
It took a good deal of courage and
work to get through it all right. But
with time, I found new avenues other
than athletics for my intensity and
desire. I pursued them with the confi
dence that comes from determination
and enjoyment, instead of the arrogance
that stems from insecurity. And oddly
enough, I found that people respected
me more for it.
Finally, I started to love playing soc
cer again. The intensity has returned,
and I play as often as I can. My new
thing is doing a bicycle kick in a game.
When IMs come in the spring, it'll hap
pen. Guaranteed.

In last Friday's pick-up soccer game,
Dave "Antelope" Briggs led colors tc
victory over a poorly conditioned whites
squad.
