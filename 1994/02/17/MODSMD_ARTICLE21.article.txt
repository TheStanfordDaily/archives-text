## Administration-bashing in Croat's columns getting old 
### 
YET AGAIN Tuesday arrived on the
Stanford campus. And like most
Tuesdays, I opened my Stanford
Daily only to be greeted by another column
by N'Gai Croal [Feb. 15] informing me of
the Stanford administration's sinister plot
to undermine my education.
As a loyal patron of The Daily, I've had
enough. In this week's episode, Croal clev
erly penned a one-act play in which Presi
dent Casper delivers a monologue to an
audience while writing in his diary. Croal
used the monologue to portray President
Casper as a conniving man who follows
only his own agenda because "... most of
the [Stanford! students, staff, and faculty
are too apathetic to openly protest what
[he is] doing."
Isn't this the same article that Croal has

written every Tuesday for the past two
months? Oh sure, the names change from
time to time. Croal seems to work on a
rotating system. Next week I'm sure we
will be back to defiling Provost Condoleezza
Rice, or Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds, or Dean of Students
Michael Jackson. But substantively, the
articles are all the same: the administration
is stabbing the students in the back, mainly
with budget cuts.
Good God man, enough is enough. We
get your point. I even agree with some of
your thoughts and opinions. But I don't
equate the fact that budgets must be
trimmed with some overall sinister plot by
the administration to get rid of ethnic cen
ters, or move the University in a more con
servative direction. When there isn't

enough money for everyone, then everyone
must help to make up the difference.
Maybe Croal would prefer we just get rid of
one big department, say History or Human
Biology, so only a very few have to suffer
from budget cuts. I prefer the community
sharing approach.
Additionally, Croal's marginalizing of
black administration members is very dis
turbing. He would have us believe the only
reason Provost Rice, and Deans Edmonds
and Jackson were appointed was to make it
more difficult for the Students of Color
Coalition to argue about ethnicity. This
twisted affirmative action program present
ed by Croal is ridiculous. Could it be that
those administrators were appointed based
on merit and not evil intentions? According
to Croal, Casper's "masterstroke" was

appointing Rice, who has said she's "been
black all [her] life." Well who are you to
doubt her? Just because a black person
doesn't agree with your opinions doesn't
mean they are not black.
The fact that I even get to Croal's article
means I am reading The Daily and know of
what is going on with the administration
and budget cuts. I can form my own opin
ions. If Croal thinks the "apathetic" stu
dents at Stanford are simply picking up
The Daily on Tuesday and flipping to his
article for the "real" news about the admin
istration, then he needs a reality check.
Croal gets prime-time space in the most
circulated campus newspaper, and he
shouldn't abuse that honor.
