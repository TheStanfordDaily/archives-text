# Criteria for initiating new studies programs unclear and too broad
## 
### 
Perhaps I'm missing something
that's obvious to all, but could some
one explain the criteria for starting a

new academic program that are
assumed by those who call for a les
bian and gay studies program to be
started at Stanford? ["Speaker says
Stanford should include gay and les
bian studies", Feb. 101 Does any cul
ture or sub-culture qualify? Any his
torically ignored or oppressed culture
or sub-culture? Any culture or sub
culture whose members have made a

substantial (and distinctive) contribu
tion to human civilization or to the
world more generally? Does the work
ing class qualify? The upper class?
The criminal? The intellectual? The
athletic? The military? The academic?
The shy? The ill? The ugly? The
genius? The orphaned? The bald? The
deviant? The handicapped?
It's interesting that in a fairly long

article about a speech in favor of a les
bian and gay studies program, there
was no mention of the principle upon
which such a recommendation is
based. Is it really so obvious? I hope
other Daily readers will be good
enough to shed some light on this mat
ter for those of us who are in the dark.
