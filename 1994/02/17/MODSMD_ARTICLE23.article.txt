## Hegi climbs ladder of success Sophomore gymnast's dream now a reality for Cardinal 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
Just who is that dashing young
man gracing the Stanford men's
gymnastics poster?
His name is Peter Hegi, a
sophomore from Dallas, Texas.
The high bar and rings specialist
had dreamed of becoming a Cardi
nal gymnast since his freshman
year in high school, but little did
he suspect he would someday end
up on the team placard.
Yes, Hegi can now look at his
poster and see the realization of
his goal. However, as with others
who have dreams, Hegi not only
struggled to fulfill his wish but
still fights hard today to secure
what he has already earned.
"I didn't expect to compete
much when I got here," Hegi said.
"I went from the best person in
my gym to the bottom of the
totem pole. My skill level wasn't
as good as the other gymnasts
here. It was neat to be around so
many great gymnasts but it was
also frustrating."
At first, gymnastics remained
relatively uncomplicated for Hegi.
Like many others before him, he
began his gymnastics career in
tumbling school as a kindergart
ner. Then, in second grade, Hegi
enrolled in gymnastics classes at
Southern Methodist University.
In sixth grade, it was on to the
Metroplex Gymnastics Club
developmental team in Dallas,
where he began formal competi
tion in Class IV gymnastics (Class
I represents the most competitive
level of five total divisions).
Two years later, the young ath
lete climbed to Class II and quali
fied for the Junior Olympic
National Championships. Hegi's
success continued in competition
with his high school squad, dur
ing which he won three Texas all
around championships, four state

titles on the rings, two state titles
on floor exercises and two state
parallel bar championships.
Unfortunately for Hegi, how
ever, it was with the more impor
tant Metroplex club team that he
encountered his first major frus
trations.

top two or three guys

pionship.'

In 10th grade, Hegi captured
both the Texas state and southern
regional championships in Class
II with Metroplex and was the
third highest qualifier for Junior
Olympic Nationals. However, he
stumbled at nationals and placed
much lower than he expected.
"I was overwhelmed and
couldn't concentrate," Hegi said.
As a junior in high school, Hegi
would relive the same frustrating
scenario. He had an exceptional
season in Class I and was expect
ed to finish high at nationals
when he fell victim to stomach
flu.
Hegi finally broke the curse his
senior year, when he again won
state and regionals and finished
fifth nationally in both floor exer
cises and rings. But in the larger
scheme of things, he was not out
of the woods yet.
Although Hegi eventually ful
filled his dream and became a
Stanford gymnast, in his fresh
man year as a Cardinal, Hegi sud
denly found his dream in a posi
tion more precarious than ones he
had faced before. Hegi was now

amongst the defending national
champions.
However, Hegi did emerge as a
valuable gymnast his freshman
year, as injuries plagued Stanford
in 1993. As a result, the unsus
pecting freshman not only com
peted in most dual meets, but was
also thrust into league, regional,
and national championship com
petitions. "Baby Jesus," as team
members call Hegi for his all
around purity, did in fact con
tribute to the Cardinal's salvation
— a second straight NCAA title.
"It was amazing last year,"
said head coach Sadao Hamada.
"Hegi was basically an alternate
on some of the events. I also put
in (current senior tri-captain)
Chris Sey, who was good. But
Peter was more impressive. I
couldn't have asked more from
him."
First, at the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Champi
onships, Hegi replaced current
junior tri-captain Josh Stein on
the high bar and posted a 9.40, his
best mark at the time as a Cardi
nal.
Then, at NCAA Western
Regionals, current senior tri-cap
tain Mark Booth ruptured his
Achilles tendon and Baby Jesus
came through again. Hegi flour
ished on the high bar and rings,
scoring a 9.50 and 9.60, respec
tively.
Finally, in the NCAA finals
against Nebraska, Hegi managed
to post a 9.25 on the high bar and
9.20 on rings. The scores were
representative of 9.75 and 9.70
performances because of the dif
ferent scoring system used during
NCAA finals, where a 9.0 instead
of a 9.50 is the base tcore given to
routines.
"Peter is not as ilexible as the
other gymnasts, and his athletic
ability is about average," Hamada
said. "But he's sincere, hard

working, very coachable, self
motivated, and patient. That's
why he can stay in this competi
tive environment."
Hegi recognizes his fight is not
yet over, however.
"I'm about the fifth or sixth
guy (out of six) on both rings and
high bar," Hegi said. "I want to be
one of the top two or three guys
and help the team to another
NCAA championship. All I can do
is get the routines ready and keep

in tip-top shape so if and when
Sadao calls on me, I'll be confi
dent and he'll be confident in
me."
On rings, Hegi is currently
working on strength to hold his
form in maneuvers such as the
maltese, where one holds oneself
horizontally on the apparatus.
For high bar, Baby Jesus is look
ing for more flair and more
aggression in moves like the
Reverse Hecht, where one swings

chest first over the bar, releases
the bar, and catches it again on
the way down.
"This year, Peter has to fight
for his NCAA spot," Hamada said.
"Everyone will definitely con
tribute on our way back to
NCAAs, but only nine guys will go
— it's tough competition for him
right now. Peter's definitely good
on rings and high bar. If he does
the right thing, he can keep going
a lot further."

high bar," Hegi said. "I want to be
one of the top two or three guys
and help the team to another
NCAA championship. All I can do
is get the routines ready and keep

in tip-top shape so if and when
Sadao calls on me, I'll be confi
dent and he'll be confident in
me."
On rings, Hegi is currently
working on strength to hold his
form in maneuvers such as the
maltese, where one holds oneself
horizontally on the apparatus.
For high bar, Baby Jesus is look
ing for more flair and more
aggression in moves like the
Reverse Hecht, where one swings

chest first over the bar, releases
the bar, and catches it again on
the way down.
"This year, Peter has to fight
for his NCAA spot," Hamada said.
"Everyone will definitely con
tribute on our way back to
NCAAs, but only nine guys will go
— it's tough competition for him
right now. Peter's definitely good
on rings and high bar. If he does
the right thing, he can keep going
a lot further."

Sophomore Peter Hegi performs a bar routine last weekend against BYU and UC-Santa Barbara. Hegi
surprised many with his contributions to the team last year and looks to help the Cardinal win a third
straight National Championship.
Just who is that dashing young
man gracing the Stanford men's
gymnastics poster?
His name is Peter Hegi, a
sophomore from Dallas, Texas.
The high bar and rings specialist
had dreamed of becoming a Cardi
nal gymnast since his freshman
year in high school, but little did
he suspect he would someday end
up on the team placard.
Yes, Hegi can now look at his
poster and see the realization of
his goal. However, as with others
who have dreams, Hegi not only
struggled to fulfill his wish but
still fights hard today to secure
what he has already earned.
"I didn't expect to compete
much when I got here," Hegi said.
"I went from the best person in
my gym to the bottom of the
totem pole. My skill level wasn't
as good as the other gymnasts
here. It was neat to be around so
many great gymnasts but it was
also frustrating."
At first, gymnastics remained
relatively uncomplicated for Hegi.
Like many others before him, he
began his gymnastics career in
tumbling school as a kindergart
ner. Then, in second grade, Hegi
enrolled in gymnastics classes at
Southern Methodist University.
In sixth grade, it was on to the
Metroplex Gymnastics Club
developmental team in Dallas,
where he began formal competi
tion in Class IV gymnastics (Class
I represents the most competitive
level of five total divisions).
Two years later, the young ath
lete climbed to Class II and quali
fied for the Junior Olympic
National Championships. Hegi's
success continued in competition
with his high school squad, dur
ing which he won three Texas all
around championships, four state

titles on the rings, two state titles
on floor exercises and two state
parallel bar championships.
Unfortunately for Hegi, how
ever, it was with the more impor
tant Metroplex club team that he
encountered his first major frus
trations.

top two or three guys

pionship.'

— Peter Hegi

In 10th grade, Hegi captured
both the Texas state and southern
regional championships in Class
II with Metroplex and was the
third highest qualifier for Junior
Olympic Nationals. However, he
stumbled at nationals and placed
much lower than he expected.
"I was overwhelmed and
couldn't concentrate," Hegi said.
As a junior in high school, Hegi
would relive the same frustrating
scenario. He had an exceptional
season in Class I and was expect
ed to finish high at nationals
when he fell victim to stomach
flu.
Hegi finally broke the curse his
senior year, when he again won
state and regionals and finished
fifth nationally in both floor exer
cises and rings. But in the larger
scheme of things, he was not out
of the woods yet.
Although Hegi eventually ful
filled his dream and became a
Stanford gymnast, in his fresh
man year as a Cardinal, Hegi sud
denly found his dream in a posi
tion more precarious than ones he
had faced before. Hegi was now

amongst the defending national
champions.
However, Hegi did emerge as a
valuable gymnast his freshman
year, as injuries plagued Stanford
in 1993. As a result, the unsus
pecting freshman not only com
peted in most dual meets, but was
also thrust into league, regional,
and national championship com
petitions. "Baby Jesus," as team
members call Hegi for his all
around purity, did in fact con
tribute to the Cardinal's salvation
— a second straight NCAA title.
"It was amazing last year,"
said head coach Sadao Hamada.
"Hegi was basically an alternate
on some of the events. I also put
in (current senior tri-captain)
Chris Sey, who was good. But
Peter was more impressive. I
couldn't have asked more from
him."
First, at the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Champi
onships, Hegi replaced current
junior tri-captain Josh Stein on
the high bar and posted a 9.40, his
best mark at the time as a Cardi
nal.
Then, at NCAA Western
Regionals, current senior tri-cap
tain Mark Booth ruptured his
Achilles tendon and Baby Jesus
came through again. Hegi flour
ished on the high bar and rings,
scoring a 9.50 and 9.60, respec
tively.
Finally, in the NCAA finals
against Nebraska, Hegi managed
to post a 9.25 on the high bar and
9.20 on rings. The scores were
representative of 9.75 and 9.70
performances because of the dif
ferent scoring system used during
NCAA finals, where a 9.0 instead
of a 9.50 is the base tcore given to
routines.
"Peter is not as ilexible as the
other gymnasts, and his athletic
ability is about average," Hamada
said. "But he's sincere, hard

working, very coachable, self
motivated, and patient. That's
why he can stay in this competi
tive environment."
Hegi recognizes his fight is not
yet over, however.
"I'm about the fifth or sixth
guy (out of six) on both rings and
high bar," Hegi said. "I want to be
one of the top two or three guys
and help the team to another
NCAA championship. All I can do
is get the routines ready and keep

in tip-top shape so if and when
