# Men's hoops looks for another win over Cal
## Stanford journeys to Bears' Harmon Arena in crucial game for NCAA tourney hopes 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
Postseason aspirations loom in the back
ground tonight as the Stanford men's bas
ketball team travels to Harmon Arena, fac
ing No. 18 California at 9 p.m. in a nation
ally-televised matchup.
"We've got to play well now if we're
going to think about the postseason," Car
dinal forward Andy Poppink said. "This is
real big, considering what happened last
weekend."
After losing to No. 16 Arizona by a 77-60
margin last Thursday, Stanford (13-7 over
all, 6-5 in the Pacific 10 Conference) squan
dered a 19-point second-half lead in drop
ping a 71-69 heartbreaker to Arizona State
on Saturday.
With five of its remaining seven games
on the road, the Cardinal faces an uphill
battle in securing ail NCAA Tournament
bid. Stanford's current No. 5 ranking in the
Pac-10 is almost definitely insufficient for
NCAA consideration. The Pac-10 has never
received five NCAA bids, and the last time
the conference garnered four was 1988-89.
The Golden Bears (16-5, 8-3), who had a
six-game winning streak snapped by Ari
zona last weekend, feature two of the con
ference's most dangerous weapons in All-
American candidates Lamond Murray and
Jason Kidd. Murray leads the Pac-10 in
both scoring (23.8 points per game) and
rebounding (8.4 boards per game). Kidd
recorded a school-record 18 assists in his
last game against Stanford.
Cal scores quickly and in bunches. In a
88-79 loss to Stanford last month, the
Bears turned a 13-point Cardinal lead into

a five-point Cal advantage over a nine
minute span.
"They are streaky," Cardinal coach Mike
Montgomery said. "If we're not scoring
consistently, Cal has the ability to turn
things around in a hurry."
Especially at miniscule Harmon Arena.

is both the smallest and loudest
arena in the conference. For the
past nine years, every Cal home
game played at Harmon has been
sold out.
"It's a tough environment,
especially when they get the
momentum," Montgomery said.
"But we've played well there in
the past."
"We get excited about playing
there more than anything else,"
Poppink said.
The Bears are ailing — fresh
man guard Randy Duck brought
the number of sidelined Cal hoop
sters to three after he broke his
arm against the Sun Devils last
weekend. Only seven scholarship
players will suit up for Cal
tonight.
Which is good news for Stan
ford — the Cardinal will probably
not face the kind of full-court
press which both Arizona schools
used last weekend.
"You're limited in the things
you can do by the people you
have," California coach Todd
Bozeman said.
In the two teams' first meeting
of the season, Cardinal forwards
Poppink and Brent Williams com
bined for 45 points and 21
rebounds. Look for Stanford to go
inside again tonight.
"We have the same game
plan," Poppink said. "It's going to
be fun."
