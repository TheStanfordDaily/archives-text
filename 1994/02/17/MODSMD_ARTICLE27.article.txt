# Women gymnasts go to Fullerton, UCSB
## 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
In the past 19 years, Stan
ford's women's gymnastics
team has never defeated Cal
State Fullerton on Titan turf.
But never say never. The
gymnasts hope to change this
custom Friday at 7:30 p.m.
when they take on the Titans.
The Cardinal then travels to
UC-Santa Barbara for Satur
day's 7 p.m. meet, where they
will try to make it two wins
over the Gauchos this year.
Stanford, currently ranked
No. 15 nationally by its aver
age season score, plans to put
together its strongest lineup
Friday night, with a team goal
to hit all its routines. Head
coach Breck Greenwood noted
that on Saturday, however,
the lineup will be altered.
"We're going to take a few
calculated risks against Santa
Barbara," said Greenwood, as
the team will attempt more
difficult moves.
Freshman Katie Jennings,
after suffering some back
injuries, will be back in the
all-around. Hillary Anderson,
a sophomore who has been
having problems with one of
her knees, will compete on all
the events but vault. Senior
Laurie West, who is rehabili
tating an injured ankle, will
be in the uneven bar lineup
and has added more difficulty
to last week's routine.
Anderson is adding a third
release move to her bar rou
tine, which is more than most
gymnasts attempt. Junior
Tina Snowden is upgrading
her first tumbling pass on
floor, and junior Meegan Lan
nin is working on adding a
whip back to her tumbling
pass that ends with a double
back tuck.

Coach Greenwood looks
forward to competing against
Fullerton, his alma mater
and where he began coaching.
The Titans dropped out of the
national rankings last week
after a bye, but were ranked
as high as No. 17 this season.
Greenwood anticipates a
challenging match and a large
crowd at the meet.
"[Fullerton] is a perennial
powerhouse," Greenwood
said. "The team is usually
always in the top 20 in the
nation, and are usually at
their best this time of the sea
son."
Of Santa Barbara, Green
wood said he expects they will
be stronger than they were
last week since they will be at
home this Saturday. But he
also knows that this Stanford
team often performs the best
at away meets.
According to Fullerton
assistant coach Julie Knight,
the Titan team is especially
strong on bars and beam this
year, never having had to
count more than two falls on
beam. Gymnasts to watch for
are all-arou nders Celeste
Delia, Cristi Clifford and
Alexis Locke, and Karena
Mills on beam and floor.
"We have a friendly rivalry
with Stanford," Knight said.
"We want to win. Stanford
has been scoring about a
point higher than us and they
have their best team ever, but
we feel we have a chance."
Santa Barbara has a very
strong vaulting team that
features April Sargent and
Marge Hoeffler. According to
head coach Tim Rivera, the
team's strongest all-arounder
is Lauren Yee, who he com
pared to Stanford's senior
Jene Elzie. Although the team
is young, he feels it can defeat
Stanford.
"We have never beaten Stan
ford, but our team is very
pumped up to win this week
end," Rivera said. "It will be a
close meet."
Stanford junior Jenny Ward,
a transfer from Fullefton, has

overcome the nervousness
which plagued her at last year's
meet against the Titans. She
hopes to get a season-high score
on vault this weekend, and exe
cute her new tumbling pass on
floor. According to Ward, the
confidence level of the whole
Cardinal team is up.
"[Fullerton] lacks depth this
year, so if we perform how
we've been performing, we can
win that meet," Ward said. "I
think this weekend we should
break some'records."
