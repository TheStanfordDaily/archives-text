Although this edition of the Winter
Olympics is sure to pass by before
that last midterm lays waste to
you, fear not. That ever-going, made-for-
Hollywood, truth-is-stranger-than-fiction
figure skating melodrama is sure to leave a
bad taste in your mouth in the months and
years to come.
Never behind the times here at Intermis
sion, I offer the following suggestions to the
entertainment powers-that-be on how to
prolong our agony in the most humane way
possible. For if we are to be subjected to
countless renditions of the Nancy Kerrig
an/Tonya Harding story, we might as well
have some fun with it.
Undoubtedly, there's going to be some
sort of movie about this whole affair. Ru
mors abound that a full-length feature will
chronicle this timely tale of intrigue and
conspiracy.
If that's the case, Oliver Stone would be a
natural choice. Perhaps he can uncover
some secret tape which will either implicate
or emancipate America's best-known brat.
Or he can dredge up a "magic crowbar" the
ory that defies logic and the laws of physics.

Drag it out over three hours and you've got
enough fun, entertainment and revenue
generating controversy to garner an Oscar
nomination.
Now that we've got a director, let's find a
cast. Everyone has their own choices for
who would play the scheming Tonya.
Newsweek likes Jennifer Jason-Leigh; Drew
Barrymore's name has been bandied about
as well. And while they would make good
choices, why not choose that other bitch-of
the-month—Shannon Doherty?
A match made in heaven! Certainly a
part to dye for!
For America's sweetheart and covergirl
of the moment, we need an actress who ex
udes class and elegance. Who better fits such
a description than a real Cover Girl, the
Wonder Woman of our happy childhoods?
That's Lynda Carter, for those of you who
have consciously blocked out the late '70s.
Such grace, such beauty. And anyone

who can fly invisible jets and block bullets
with her wrists could play a figure skater,
bum knee and all.
Now we're having fun. Why not throw in
Wilford Brimley as the thug, for good mea
sure? Sure, he's a little old and a little portly,
but, hey, anyone who's seen "The Firm"
knows that Mr. Quaker Oats can be a bad,
bad man.
Certainly, a movie's not a bad idea. But a
made-for-television docudrama/miniseries
more justly befits a story of such magnitude.
Something along the lines of that Mike
Tyson special last year might do nicely. A
special episode of "Unsolved Mysteries"
could work too.
I'd prefer something clever, like a reprisal
of "Twin Peaks." No one's considered the
possibility that dancing midgets from an
other dimension provided Tonya with her
motivation. Or that "All-American Nancy"
is anything but your average world figure

skating queen. Throw in some kinky sex and
graphic violence and there's no reason the
television version of the story couldn't get
the same kind of ratings and attention
"NYPD Blue" has.
Unfortunately, all we can really expect
from this whole affair is to see dreamy
Nancy and stumpy Tonya night in and night
out on "Hard Copy" and "Inside Edition."
There's always a place for the two on tabloid
television. As we speak, visions of the figure
skaters mud wrestling are probably snaking
in Geraldo's head.
But wait a minute. The story's not over.
Rest assured, regardless of the outcome,
cheesy screenwriters everywhere are pre
pared to resolve this tiff in the most ex
ploitative way possible. Tonya could be the
vengeful woman scorned or misunder
stood victim of false accusation. And win or
lose, Nancy's story already typifies that
"Triumph of the Human Spirit" theme we
in the audience just eat up. Her "based-on
a-real-life" story proves that Hollywood's
right in saying "it's not whether you win or
lose."
It's how you play the marketing game. ■
