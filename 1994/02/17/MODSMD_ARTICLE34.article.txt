# Ben Stiller A sweet bite of success
## 
### Ed Yoon 
The Pan Pacific hotel, a swank pad of
metal, marble and glass, stretches twenty
one floors — most of it empty space — up
ward, allowing an unobstructed fall from its
top level to its minimalist fountain on the
first floor. The majority of the tenants —
white-haired patricians, sporting immacu
lately pressed suits and ramrod posture —
probably think Ben Stiller is one of the valets,
only the valets are more spiffily dressed.
Twenty-eight and unshaven for what
looks like several days, flopping about in a
multi-layered J. Crew/L.L. Bean/Gap outfit,
Stiller apologizes for being late as he opens
the door to his room, the Olympic Suite on
the twenty-first floor. Just returning from a
screening of "Reality Bites" at San Francisco
State, he looks a little tired from the obligato
ry junket to pitch the film. "It's been hectic,"
he said.
And the yuppie haircut he sports as the
shallow Michael Grates in "Reality Bites"
seems to have grown out — a lot. Neverthe
less, he's a gracious host, careful with his
words and attentive to questions. He even
looks you in the eye when he speaks, instead
of staring at the evening San Francisco sky
line that fills the room.
An easy slide into showbiz
Stiller is self-effacing, almost apologetic,
about the streak of luck that's landed him on
the top floor of the Pan Pacific. The product
of Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, he remem
bers jetting over to Hollywood for "The Fd
Sullivan Show," meeting movie stars and
making movies with his Fujica Super 8

camera.
After attending college for nine
months, he quit, went back to
New York, and almost immcdi-

ately picked up roles. At 19 he ap
peared in an off-Broadway play, and
later landed supporting jobs in films

like "Fmpire of the Sun" and "Next of
Kin."

When he wasn't acting, Stiller made short
films, mostly with a satirical edge. His " The
Hustler of Money," a take-off of "The Color
of Money," impressed the producers of "Sat
urday Night Live," who aired it in 1987 and

subsequently hired Stiller as a writer in 1989.
Later, he directed the half-hour comedy show
"Back to Brooklyn" for MTV and then creat
ed "The Ben Stiller Show" in 1990.
After a short-lived tenure at Fox, "The Ben
Stiller Show" garnered an Fmmy for Stiller as
co-writer. By then Stiller was ready for some
thing other than parodies. But it took a while
before he was ready to go ahead. "I was di
recting episodes on Fox and I would get
scripts a year or two before 'Reality Bites'," he
says. "They were stupid movies, stupid
movies. 'Problem Child 2', stuff like that."
As for "Reality Bites," a film about four re
cent college grads trying to face issues like a
grim job market and — what else —ro-
mance, Stiller immediately felt drawn to the
story. "I felt they were real characters," he
says."I could identify with them emotional
ly, I could understand their problems because
I felt those myself."
Immediately the exasperated question
pops up: is this another twenty-something
movie, another breathless attempt to charac
terize the so-called undefinable generation

that everyone tries to define anyway? "I

didn't want to make a twenty-

something movie," he says."I

liked the characters in the

story and I wanted to

tell a love story."

We 11...

And

that's

what

"Reality

Bites" mainly

amounts to — a

young romance tale

with few surprises. But in

the meantime it skillfully packs

in authentic details of the college-

aged, white-middle class. For instance,
the characters, all friends living in a ram
shackle house in Houston, share in a drink
ing game involving past episodes of "Good
Times." A statement on the cultural empti

ness of America's future leaders, on the disre
pair of America's youth, perhaps?
"It's easy to be nostalgic for the past," says
Stiller. "That's the main thing. No other agen
da with it." So much for the social criticism.

Being rabbinical about the hype
The rest of the story about the making of
"Reality Bites" seems equally without com
plication. After working on the script for ten
months with twenty-something writer Helen
Childress — "I wanted to streamline it more,
make it more a love story" — Stiller pitched
it to all the studios, mostly getting the

thumbs down.
That is until 21-year-old

Winona Ryder read the script

and was excited by it.

"Then the script col

who also wanted
it." Jersey Films
signed on to do the film
and it finished production for
a paltry $11 million, going on to

be a hot-ticket item at The Sundance

Film Festival, a Hollywood hive that has
come to be the venue for the up-and-coming
and the young-and-fresh.
Stiller seems almost resentful of the hype,
then almost resiliently philosophical about
his fortunes.
"It's such bullshit," Stiller said. "I'm not
trying to get my next job before my next
movie gets out. They love untested talent. If
you're young, you've got no track record, no
failures. It's so fleeting. It all comes and goes
so quickly."
Nevertheless, Stiller isn't about to point
fingers and adopt a holier-than-Hollywood
attitude. "I don't feel like an outsider to the
Hollywood system," he says."I moved there

three or four years ago, and I got work."
And he's comfortable with the studio sys
tem, especially since relations with Jersey
Films on "Reality Bites" were cordial, even
helpful. "If I do a non-mainstream film then
1 would go independent," he grants, but oth
erwise he's completely willing to swim the
mainstream as well.
As for the future, Stiller wants to stretch
out and explore other genres. "I want to make
a lot of different kinds of movies," he says.
"This movie was challenging for me person-

ally, dealing with rea*characters on a real

level. My instincts are to work from a

situation."

Though Stiller is familiar
with his comedic skills, he says he

wants to direct other films. "I

don't want to be pigeonholed
as a comedy director. I want

a diverse range of films. I like

thrillers, plot-oriented stories,

character comedies, broad parodies.
"I approach things first as an actor,

then as a director, then as a writer," he says."I
knew acting would be how I got in — I think
any way you can get your foot in the door is
valid. I don't consider myself a writer — I like
collaborating with writers. I consider myself
more of a director."
Right about then somebody rings the
doorbell of the Olympic Suite. Once. Twice.
"Jesus Christ, man," Stiller mutters, and then
realizes he should probably answer it — he
seems genuinely annoyed at having to break
off the interview.
It's someone from the hotel, dropping off
a square of chocolate for Stiller. He returns to
the table, unwrapping the bar of chocolate
from its wax paper, and after a momentary
look of shcepishness — perhaps wondering if
he should share it with us — he realizes he's
clutching a fancy bar of chocolate during an
interview, then pops it into his mouth and
munches on it.
Still adjusting to the Hollywood life, Stiller
seems content to stroll his way down the ca
reer path, seemingly uninterested in beating
drums or chasing down some vision of cine
matic glory. But if reality bites for Stiller, the
taste is sweet indeed. ■
