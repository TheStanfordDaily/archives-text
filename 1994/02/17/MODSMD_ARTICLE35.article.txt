# An Ancient Big Bang Theory
## Stanford Taiko, from 'Karada' to 'Hanabi' 
### Eddie Ong 
What does it take to be in a taiko
group? Strong hands? The ability
to quickly coordinate rhythms?
You might need these traits, but as Stanford
Taiko proves, there is much more to perfor
mance drumming than just skill learning.
The students who comprise the group — all
undergraduates—treat taiko not as a stop-over
activity but as a discipline that can only be mas
tered with dedication. Stanford Taiko, a group
with about 20 members, also shows that the ac
complishments and rewards that result from
dedication arise from a collective effort, not just
from the work of a single individual.
Taiko has its roots in ancient Japan. The
"taiko," meaning "drum," was a sacred instru
ment used to ward off supernatural forces that
were thought to damage crops. The sound of
the taiko symbolized thunder, and people be
lieved that this drum would bring in a much
needed rain to rescue an endangered harvest.
Although StanfordTaiko's goal is not to pro
tect us from drought-causing spirits, the cam
pus group still maintains the element of"Kara
da" set forth by its ancient drum-playing pre
decessors. "Karada" is the discipline emphasiz
ing lx)dy strength, power, and stamina — a dis
cipline evident during a regular Stanford Taiko
rehearsal, where the members spend at least
twenty minutes doing calisthenics before even
touching the drums.
'laiko director Joe Kimura, a senior, said the

activity requires a lot of stamina. "Taiko is both
a music and a sport," he said.
Indeed, Taiko's physical nature was most
convincing when the group practiced "Hachi
jo," a piece better known as "The Deadliest
Song." Ibr ten minutes, players aggressively
pounded their instruments with a force that
made the walls of the encompassing Asian
American Activities Center resonate like crazy.
Exhausted from the performance, the sweat
drenched members then played 'Hachijo' two
more times without complaint. This persis
tence demonstrates "Karada" at its best. Taiko
member junior Susan Kanagawa said Hachijo
is extremely taxing physically.
"So much energy is needed to play "Hachi
jo" effectively — after the third practice, we
were collapsing all over the place," she said.
"But we can't do that in a real performance."
"Karada" is also needed for the visual aspect
of taiko. In a given song, players will constantly
move to other drums while adopting a different
stance and drumming style for each new post.
This variation creates a flow-like pattern that al
lows for nuances in choreography. A sluggish
looking group could ruin the overall perfor
mance even if the music is superb.
"Getting the choreography down pat is the
hard part for most taiko members," Kimura
said. " They are initially not used to exaggerated
expressions, such as vigorous arm-waving or
yelling."

The strength and stamina associated with
"Karada" might lead one to assume that Stan
ford taiko merely produces loud percussive
noise. But don't be fooled — its ensemble has
many subtle components that can be heard if
one listens closely, from three different drums
to its newest addition, sophomore Nicole
Leong on flute.
The flute is an appropriate solo instrument
because it easily stands out. But what about a
drum solo in the presence of other drums? That
is a challenge. It takes a quality player to master
the solo without being drowned out by the
other drums. But the beauty of taiko is that there
are many solos in one song — no "hogging."
Solos are spontaneous, which makes them
more difficult Flowever, many of the Stanford
Taiko players have become adept soloists
through dedication to their craft — the quest
for the perfect solo is challenging but satisfying.
A sure test of dedication is the acceptance of
new challenges. Previously, all of the songs were
of the pre-written traditional variety. Now,
however, veterans like junior 1 liroshi Tanaka
have taken the initiative to write originals.
Tanaka has already composed "Hanabi,"
meaning "firecracker" in Japanese. "Hanabi"
contains several movements that started out as
pieces of a puzzle, where each piece was a frag
ment of the song.
" 1 would conjure up images of fireworks and
think about how the different cracking and

blasting sounds could be translated and put to
gether into a musical form," he said.
Such creativity has inspired other members
to start composing their own songs as well.
But the final product involves more than just
the brainstorming of one individual. Tanaka
said any song, be it traditional or original, in
volves collaborative input when it comes to
choreography or stage expressions associated
with the music.
Stanford Taiko's purpose and existence have
met with challenges since 1990, when it was a
SWOPSI class. But through dedication and a
cooperative mentality, the group has grown to
be quite a respected musical organization.
So how does Taiko maintain such dedica
tion? "Through close bonding, and the mere
enjoyment from playing the drums," said
member junior Felix Lin. The lasting impres
sion Stanford Taiko gives to new students in the
freshman orientation program "Faces of the
Community" and the huge turnouts it receives
at auditions in the fall are no fluke.
But seeing is believing, so check them out
yourself.

Tonight at 6:30 p.m., Stanford Taiko will be
hosting a performance at Soto House in Wilbur.
Also, it will be one of a handful of talented acts
at Saturday night's EAST Test at 7p.m. Taiko's
audio-visual prowess, which it is known for, will
surely add flavor to the festival.
