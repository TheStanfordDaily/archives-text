That night it seems it must be all over. I hope it will go on tomorrow but I
don't know how.

So goes "Mad Forest," the Caryl Churchill
play that depicts life before, during and
after the 1989 overthrow of repressive
Romanian president Nicolae Ceausescu
through the eyes of two families — the
Vladus and the Antonescus.
Directed by Sonya Kuftinec, a third-year
Ph.D. student in drama, the three-hour,
multi-media production covers more issues
than a MacNeil-Lehrer news hour.
"It's a heavy play that's not something to
go to if you're not in that good of a mood,"
says sophomore Gabriella Teodorescu, who
plays Lucia. "It really makes you think a lot."
In the first act, Churchill deftly tackles the
Romanian culture of silence. A plethora of
pauses and terse dialogue — spoken either in
codified language or with the radio on full
blast — forces gestures and actions to reveal
what characters cannot say for fear of politi
cal and personal repercussions.
One such scene starts with Lucia visiting a
doctor, hoping to have an abortion. Teodor
escu, who was born in Romania and had
lived there for eight years before immigrating
to the United States with her family, de
scribes the difficult action.
"I'm facing a doctor and [her] words are,
'You're a slut,' and 'One more child is one
more worker'. But in the meantime, on this
notepad, I'm writing down how much an
abortion would cost and she writes down
where we will meet and what time. Basically,

I'm going to get an abortion.'

Romania had outlawed abortion and birth
control as well. Women were supposed to
bear a certain number of children to balance
the Romanian population growth with that
of the Hungarians, the largest ethnic minori
ty group living in their country.
At the same time, however, Ceausescus
radical economic policy — exporting all of
Romania's resources to eradicate the foreign
debt, thereby eliminating dependence on the
West — had driven the standard of living too
low for the average family to support those
children.
As a result, at least 15,000 Romanian
women died between 1965 and 1989 from
back-room abortions while thousands of
other women gave children up to orphan
ages, says Teodorescu.
"There's this complete subtext," she con
tinues, now referring to the play. "|The audi
ence has] to realize what's going on. You all
spoke in that silence."
And within the pages of Churchill's script,
silence speaks volumes.
Kuftinec cites the writing as one reason
she chose to direct "Mad Forest." "I was real
ly interested in the way Churchill took an
event, a current event — the Romanian revo
lution, and wrote around it. Didn't try to cre
ate a documentary, but worked to look at the
social context."

In addition to her Eastern European her
itage, Kuftinec's interest in

how theatre intersects
with politics also led her

to "Mad Forest." For

her, the play's theme posed intriguing
questions.
"What was the life of the individual
within this large event and how did the
event work with the individual's mindset?
How did they affect each other? How do
these people, in a way, contribute to their
own oppression?"

Churchill bulldozes through uncharted
territory, mapping out answers to some of
these questions in the second act. Com
prised of a series of monologues, this act
introduces 11 new characters, each of
whom addresses the audience and relates
where they were and what they saw happen
during revolution.
Based on interviews Churchill held
while visiting Romania, the monologues
supply stinging realism to an already pow
erful play.
Freshman Hristo Stephanov, who wit
nessed the events on television from his
home in Bulgaria, relates his own story
with similar intensity. (Ceausescu had just
returned from Iran and had decided to
reaffirm his authority through a speech in
response to the events in Timosoara — i.e.
the government shooting demonstrators
supporting a Hungarian priest held pris
oner by the secret police).
"[Ceausescu] was speaking and sud
denly people started booing, just started
whistling and shouting stuff. Of course,
you couldn't hear anything but it was like a
very frightening noise — the crowd being
silent, sort of a clapping noise.
"You can't really hear a single clap, but you
know it's that sound," he describes, slowly
simulating a clapping motion. "And then the
sound totally changes. It's like the nice wind
on the beach that suddenly turns into a ty

| saw] a totally different studio and somebody
translating while everything is going on ...
and then I realized that they had just set up a
table in front of a camera in the T.V. building
and they were reading speeches and stuff.
"They had just started transmitting Ro
manian programs on the second channel of
Bulgarian T.V.," Stephanov continues. "1 ac
tually saw the trial .... When they actually

Romanian People, Their Mindset.

phoon. [Ceausescu] just stopped. I think he
got really scared. He couldn't say anything.
"Some people started climbing on top of
the buildings and the policemen just couldn't
contain the crowd," he explains. "[Ceauses
cu] called a helicopter to come to the top of
the building."
After flying him, his wife and his body
guards from the scene, Ceausescus en
tourage realized the danger and ditched the
dictator and his wife in the countryside, ac
cording to Stephanov.
"One day, I just turned on the T.V. ... I

shot [the Ceausescus), they showed that. It
was really, really scary. It's not like the vio
lence in the movies you see here."
At first, Stephanov, who plays Mihai in
"Mad Forest," didn't believe a two-hour play
could adequately capture the history and sig
nificance of the events. But now, he says, he
sees the short scenes as depicting realistic
fragments of Romanian life.
"I think the play tells very well about the
soul of the Romanian people, their mindset."
" I here's no one truth," Kuftinec says. "It's
hard to read a history book about the Ro
manian revolution, or about anything in Ro-

l iLUUSTR \1 K V\\ X BI DM 1

mania for that matter, first of all, it's a culture
that communicates through myth and story
telling. If a metaphor can relate a truth better
than the actual truth, [Romanians] will pick
a metaphor, an exaggeration because the
facts are less important that the idea."
Quite fittingly, the third act opens
with two metaphorical characters, a
vampire and a dog. The dog whines
about his previous master mistreating him,
then begs the vampire to take care of him.
After vainly shooing the dog, the vampire
asks it it it would like to become a vampire,
too. The dog says yes and the scene ends with
the vampire sinking his teeth into the dogs
neck.
A simplistic analysis would interpret the
vampire as symbolizing Romania's new
leader lon lliescu and the dog as representing
the defeated Romanian people. But Kuftinec
sees another level to the scene.
"Hegel writes about the master-slave di
alectic. The master is only the master when
the slave recognizes the master's authority
and power. It's a scene about someone be
coming a slave, someone participating in
their own enslavement in order to get some
thing — security, food.
"There is a transaction that has to do both

with power and authority, but it's a trans
action the dog makes. And that's, I think,
the most important element of the scene..
. the individual's participation in his or her
own oppression."
A scathing criticism, indeed.
Hegel and Kuftinec, however, aren't the
only ones to espouse this belief. According
to Kuftinec, the idea also surfaced in Czech

leader Vaclav Havel's 1989 state of the
union address which told the people they
could no longer blame the communist sys
tem for their grievances, they had to look
within.
"There would be no Ceausescu if there
weren't 20 million Romanians allowing
themselves to live within that system,"
Kuftinec adds.
"What do you do with the people who
compromise themselves just to save their
families, or just have food for their chil
dren?" Teodorescu asks. "How do you deal
with just such things as the language ol the
past? People who still speak in that social
ist realism or the jargon of the past?
They're not meaning anything bad by it,
but other people get very offended."
The third act continues with the Vladus
and the Antonescus raising many of these
same questions as they attempt to adjust to
Iliescu's Romania.
In the Stanford production's finest scene,
Radu (Geoff Sobelle) discovers his mother,
Flavia (Caroline Vix), may lose her job be
cause of her acquiescence under Ceausescus
regime. He stormily confronts Flavia while
she and Radu's father, Mihai, forcefully de
fend her.
Unfortunately, many in the 15-member
cast fail to ever reach this level of energy, a dy
namism crucial to a play that incorporates
lengthy pauses as expressions of tension.
"What the actor is trying to do is to play
these moments in which they're complicit in
feeling like they can't have conversation with
out the radio turned up," Kuftinec reminds.
"In some ways it's really difficult, especially
for students who are under 20, to really be
able to process that kind of experience
Because it's so minimally written, it's hard to
get a lot of information about the characters."
But even with so little information,
more can be done with the portrayals.
Dramaturg Tom Freeland, who bril
liantly plays nine or 10 dramatically different
characters in "Mad Forest," slips in and out of
roles so smoothly, it's hard to believe the
same man plays them all.
"The actors had to do so much, though, in
five weeks," Kuftinec says. "They had to learn
how to lambada, they had to learn to fight,

they had to learn a Romanian song, a Ro
manian poem, and the whole last scene is in
Romanian."
True, yet asking an audience to devote way
more than two hours of its attention to a
slow-moving, complicated production is
hardly fair.
Even more grating is Kuftinec's decision to
overlap dialogue in the entire second act and
much of the third. Although the effect works
on a theoretical level, in practice 20 or more
minutes of constant straining to understand
what is being said encourages the audience to
tune out altogether rather than clue in on one
character at a time.
Fortunately, the technical aspects of the
play work incredibly well. Low lighting in the
first act appropriately extends the heaviness
beyond what the laconic dialogue and nu
merous pauses lend to the mood.
"The first act is really very dark because
Romanians were only allowed one 40-watt
light bulb in the house, that's all," Kuftinec
says.
"In the late '80s, when Ceausescu was

selling off a lot of Romanian resources to
pay the foreign debt," she continues, "the
electricity would occasionally go out
You wouldn't have power, you didn't know
for how long, you didn't know if it would
come back on. You had to do a lot of things
in the dark."
Spotlights in the second act stress the indi
vidual voices, each competing to tell its story,
none of the characters listening to any other.
And in the third act the light opens up,
suggesting a new reality to which characters
must adjust.
Costumes add another touch of realism,
with the award for the best outfit going to
Lucia's early '80s designer denims, bright
pink jacket, and rhinestone-studded ankle
boots — all of which subtly emphasize her re
cent trip to America.
While the technical aspects of the show
enhance the themes, Stanford's production
of "Mad Forest" seems to fall victim to a di
rector and a cast, all of whom bit off far more
than they can collectively chew.
Although Churchill's depiction of Ro
manian life remains stimulating, you may
need to ingest a few gallons of Jolt before tak
ing your seat.

"Mad Forest" appears in Memorial Hall's Little
Theatre at 8 p.m., Wednesday-Saturday, Feb.
16-19 and 23-26. Tickets are $9general, $5 stu
dents/seniors and are available at the Box Of

"[Ceausescu] was speaking and sud

you couldn't hear anything but it was like a
very frightening noise — the crowd being

know it's that sound," he describes, slowly
simulating a clapping motion. "And then the

phoon. [Ceausescu] just stopped. I think he
got really scared. He couldn't say anything.
"Some people started climbing on top of
the buildings and the policemen just couldn't
contain the crowd," he explains. "[Ceauses
cu] called a helicopter to come to the top of
the building."
After flying him, his wife and his body
guards from the scene, Ceausescus en
tourage realized the danger and ditched the
dictator and his wife in the countryside, ac
cording to Stephanov.
"One day, I just turned on the T.V. ... I

shot [the Ceausescus), they showed that. It
was really, really scary. It's not like the vio
lence in the movies you see here."
At first, Stephanov, who plays Mihai in
"Mad Forest," didn't believe a two-hour play
could adequately capture the history and sig
nificance of the events. But now, he says, he
sees the short scenes as depicting realistic
fragments of Romanian life.
"I think the play tells very well about the
soul of the Romanian people, their mindset."
" I here's no one truth," Kuftinec says. "It's
hard to read a history book about the Ro
manian revolution, or about anything in Ro-

l iLUUSTR \1 K V\\ X BI DM 1

mania for that matter, first of all, it's a culture
that communicates through myth and story
telling. If a metaphor can relate a truth better
than the actual truth, [Romanians] will pick
a metaphor, an exaggeration because the
facts are less important that the idea."
Quite fittingly, the third act opens
with two metaphorical characters, a
vampire and a dog. The dog whines
about his previous master mistreating him,
then begs the vampire to take care of him.
After vainly shooing the dog, the vampire
asks it it it would like to become a vampire,
too. The dog says yes and the scene ends with
the vampire sinking his teeth into the dogs
neck.
A simplistic analysis would interpret the
vampire as symbolizing Romania's new
leader lon lliescu and the dog as representing
the defeated Romanian people. But Kuftinec
sees another level to the scene.
"Hegel writes about the master-slave di
alectic. The master is only the master when
the slave recognizes the master's authority
and power. It's a scene about someone be
coming a slave, someone participating in
their own enslavement in order to get some
thing — security, food.
"There is a transaction that has to do both

with power and authority, but it's a trans
action the dog makes. And that's, I think,
the most important element of the scene..
. the individual's participation in his or her
own oppression."
A scathing criticism, indeed.
Hegel and Kuftinec, however, aren't the
only ones to espouse this belief. According
to Kuftinec, the idea also surfaced in Czech

leader Vaclav Havel's 1989 state of the
union address which told the people they
could no longer blame the communist sys
tem for their grievances, they had to look
within.
"There would be no Ceausescu if there
weren't 20 million Romanians allowing
themselves to live within that system,"
Kuftinec adds.
"What do you do with the people who
compromise themselves just to save their
families, or just have food for their chil
dren?" Teodorescu asks. "How do you deal
with just such things as the language ol the
past? People who still speak in that social
ist realism or the jargon of the past?
They're not meaning anything bad by it,
but other people get very offended."
The third act continues with the Vladus
and the Antonescus raising many of these
same questions as they attempt to adjust to
Iliescu's Romania.
In the Stanford production's finest scene,
Radu (Geoff Sobelle) discovers his mother,
Flavia (Caroline Vix), may lose her job be
cause of her acquiescence under Ceausescus
regime. He stormily confronts Flavia while
she and Radu's father, Mihai, forcefully de
fend her.
Unfortunately, many in the 15-member
cast fail to ever reach this level of energy, a dy
namism crucial to a play that incorporates
lengthy pauses as expressions of tension.
"What the actor is trying to do is to play
these moments in which they're complicit in
feeling like they can't have conversation with
out the radio turned up," Kuftinec reminds.
"In some ways it's really difficult, especially
for students who are under 20, to really be
able to process that kind of experience
Because it's so minimally written, it's hard to
get a lot of information about the characters."
But even with so little information,
more can be done with the portrayals.
Dramaturg Tom Freeland, who bril
liantly plays nine or 10 dramatically different
characters in "Mad Forest," slips in and out of
roles so smoothly, it's hard to believe the
same man plays them all.
"The actors had to do so much, though, in
five weeks," Kuftinec says. "They had to learn
how to lambada, they had to learn to fight,

they had to learn a Romanian song, a Ro
manian poem, and the whole last scene is in
Romanian."
True, yet asking an audience to devote way
more than two hours of its attention to a
slow-moving, complicated production is
hardly fair.
Even more grating is Kuftinec's decision to
overlap dialogue in the entire second act and
much of the third. Although the effect works
on a theoretical level, in practice 20 or more
minutes of constant straining to understand
what is being said encourages the audience to
tune out altogether rather than clue in on one
character at a time.
Fortunately, the technical aspects of the
play work incredibly well. Low lighting in the
first act appropriately extends the heaviness
beyond what the laconic dialogue and nu
merous pauses lend to the mood.
"The first act is really very dark because
Romanians were only allowed one 40-watt
light bulb in the house, that's all," Kuftinec
says.
"In the late '80s, when Ceausescu was

electricity would occasionally go out
You wouldn't have power, you didn't know
for how long, you didn't know if it would
come back on. You had to do a lot of things
in the dark."
Spotlights in the second act stress the indi
vidual voices, each competing to tell its story,
none of the characters listening to any other.
And in the third act the light opens up,
suggesting a new reality to which characters
must adjust.
Costumes add another touch of realism,
with the award for the best outfit going to
Lucia's early '80s designer denims, bright
pink jacket, and rhinestone-studded ankle
boots — all of which subtly emphasize her re
cent trip to America.
While the technical aspects of the show
enhance the themes, Stanford's production
of "Mad Forest" seems to fall victim to a di
rector and a cast, all of whom bit off far more
than they can collectively chew.
Although Churchill's depiction of Ro
manian life remains stimulating, you may
need to ingest a few gallons of Jolt before tak
ing your seat.

"Mad Forest" appears in Memorial Hall's Little
Theatre at 8 p.m., Wednesday-Saturday, Feb.
16-19 and 23-26. Tickets are $9general, $5 stu

That night it seems it must be all over. I hope it will go on tomorrow but I
don't know how.

So goes "Mad Forest," the Caryl Churchill
play that depicts life before, during and
after the 1989 overthrow of repressive
Romanian president Nicolae Ceausescu
through the eyes of two families — the
Vladus and the Antonescus.
Directed by Sonya Kuftinec, a third-year
Ph.D. student in drama, the three-hour,
multi-media production covers more issues
than a MacNeil-Lehrer news hour.
"It's a heavy play that's not something to
go to if you're not in that good of a mood,"
says sophomore Gabriella Teodorescu, who
plays Lucia. "It really makes you think a lot."
In the first act, Churchill deftly tackles the
Romanian culture of silence. A plethora of
pauses and terse dialogue — spoken either in
codified language or with the radio on full
blast — forces gestures and actions to reveal
what characters cannot say for fear of politi
cal and personal repercussions.
One such scene starts with Lucia visiting a
doctor, hoping to have an abortion. Teodor
escu, who was born in Romania and had
lived there for eight years before immigrating
to the United States with her family, de
scribes the difficult action.
"I'm facing a doctor and [her] words are,
'You're a slut,' and 'One more child is one
more worker'. But in the meantime, on this
notepad, I'm writing down how much an
abortion would cost and she writes down
where we will meet and what time. Basically,

I'm going to get an abortion.'

Romania had outlawed abortion and birth
control as well. Women were supposed to
bear a certain number of children to balance
the Romanian population growth with that
of the Hungarians, the largest ethnic minori
ty group living in their country.
At the same time, however, Ceausescus
radical economic policy — exporting all of
Romania's resources to eradicate the foreign
debt, thereby eliminating dependence on the
West — had driven the standard of living too
low for the average family to support those
children.
As a result, at least 15,000 Romanian
women died between 1965 and 1989 from
back-room abortions while thousands of
other women gave children up to orphan
ages, says Teodorescu.
"There's this complete subtext," she con
tinues, now referring to the play. "|The audi
ence has] to realize what's going on. You all
spoke in that silence."
And within the pages of Churchill's script,
silence speaks volumes.
Kuftinec cites the writing as one reason
she chose to direct "Mad Forest." "I was real
ly interested in the way Churchill took an
event, a current event — the Romanian revo
lution, and wrote around it. Didn't try to cre
ate a documentary, but worked to look at the
social context."

In addition to her Eastern European her
itage, Kuftinec's interest in

how theatre intersects
with politics also led her

to "Mad Forest." For

her, the play's theme posed intriguing
questions.
"What was the life of the individual
within this large event and how did the
event work with the individual's mindset?
How did they affect each other? How do
these people, in a way, contribute to their
own oppression?"

Churchill bulldozes through uncharted
territory, mapping out answers to some of
these questions in the second act. Com
prised of a series of monologues, this act
introduces 11 new characters, each of
whom addresses the audience and relates
where they were and what they saw happen
during revolution.
Based on interviews Churchill held
while visiting Romania, the monologues
supply stinging realism to an already pow
erful play.
Freshman Hristo Stephanov, who wit
nessed the events on television from his
home in Bulgaria, relates his own story
with similar intensity. (Ceausescu had just
returned from Iran and had decided to
reaffirm his authority through a speech in
response to the events in Timosoara — i.e.
the government shooting demonstrators
supporting a Hungarian priest held pris
oner by the secret police).
"[Ceausescu] was speaking and sud

past? People who still speak in that social
ist realism or the jargon of the past?
They're not meaning anything bad by it,
but other people get very offended."
The third act continues with the Vladus
and the Antonescus raising many of these
same questions as they attempt to adjust to
Iliescu's Romania.
In the Stanford production's finest scene,
Radu (Geoff Sobelle) discovers his mother,
Flavia (Caroline Vix), may lose her job be
cause of her acquiescence under Ceausescus
regime. He stormily confronts Flavia while
she and Radu's father, Mihai, forcefully de
fend her.
Unfortunately, many in the 15-member
cast fail to ever reach this level of energy, a dy
namism crucial to a play that incorporates
lengthy pauses as expressions of tension.
"What the actor is trying to do is to play
these moments in which they're complicit in
feeling like they can't have conversation with
out the radio turned up," Kuftinec reminds.
"In some ways it's really difficult, especially
for students who are under 20, to really be
able to process that kind of experience
Because it's so minimally written, it's hard to
get a lot of information about the characters."
But even with so little information,
more can be done with the portrayals.
Dramaturg Tom Freeland, who bril
liantly plays nine or 10 dramatically different
characters in "Mad Forest," slips in and out of
roles so smoothly, it's hard to believe the
same man plays them all.
"The actors had to do so much, though, in
five weeks," Kuftinec says. "They had to learn
how to lambada, they had to learn to fight,

they had to learn a Romanian song, a Ro
manian poem, and the whole last scene is in
Romanian."
True, yet asking an audience to devote way
more than two hours of its attention to a
slow-moving, complicated production is
hardly fair.
Even more grating is Kuftinec's decision to
overlap dialogue in the entire second act and
much of the third. Although the effect works
on a theoretical level, in practice 20 or more
minutes of constant straining to understand
what is being said encourages the audience to
tune out altogether rather than clue in on one
character at a time.
Fortunately, the technical aspects of the
play work incredibly well. Low lighting in the
first act appropriately extends the heaviness
beyond what the laconic dialogue and nu
merous pauses lend to the mood.
"The first act is really very dark because
Romanians were only allowed one 40-watt
light bulb in the house, that's all," Kuftinec
says.
"In the late '80s, when Ceausescu was

You wouldn't have power, you didn't know

Spotlights in the second act stress the indi
vidual voices, each competing to tell its story,
none of the characters listening to any other.
And in the third act the light opens up,
suggesting a new reality to which characters
must adjust.
Costumes add another touch of realism,
with the award for the best outfit going to
Lucia's early '80s designer denims, bright
pink jacket, and rhinestone-studded ankle
boots — all of which subtly emphasize her re
cent trip to America.
While the technical aspects of the show
enhance the themes, Stanford's production
of "Mad Forest" seems to fall victim to a di
rector and a cast, all of whom bit off far more
than they can collectively chew.
Although Churchill's depiction of Ro
manian life remains stimulating, you may
need to ingest a few gallons of Jolt before tak

"Mad Forest" appears in Memorial Hall's Little

That night it seems it must be all over. I hope it will go on tomorrow but I
don't know how.

So goes "Mad Forest," the Caryl Churchill
play that depicts life before, during and
after the 1989 overthrow of repressive
Romanian president Nicolae Ceausescu
through the eyes of two families — the
Vladus and the Antonescus.
Directed by Sonya Kuftinec, a third-year
Ph.D. student in drama, the three-hour,
multi-media production covers more issues
than a MacNeil-Lehrer news hour.
"It's a heavy play that's not something to
go to if you're not in that good of a mood,"
says sophomore Gabriella Teodorescu, who
plays Lucia. "It really makes you think a lot."
In the first act, Churchill deftly tackles the
Romanian culture of silence. A plethora of
pauses and terse dialogue — spoken either in
codified language or with the radio on full
blast — forces gestures and actions to reveal
what characters cannot say for fear of politi
cal and personal repercussions.
One such scene starts with Lucia visiting a
doctor, hoping to have an abortion. Teodor
escu, who was born in Romania and had
lived there for eight years before immigrating
to the United States with her family, de
scribes the difficult action.
"I'm facing a doctor and [her] words are,
'You're a slut,' and 'One more child is one
more worker'. But in the meantime, on this
notepad, I'm writing down how much an
abortion would cost and she writes down
where we will meet and what time. Basically,

I'm going to get an abortion.'

Romania had outlawed abortion and birth
control as well. Women were supposed to
bear a certain number of children to balance
the Romanian population growth with that
of the Hungarians, the largest ethnic minori
ty group living in their country.
At the same time, however, Ceausescus
radical economic policy — exporting all of
Romania's resources to eradicate the foreign
debt, thereby eliminating dependence on the
West — had driven the standard of living too
low for the average family to support those
children.
As a result, at least 15,000 Romanian
women died between 1965 and 1989 from
back-room abortions while thousands of
other women gave children up to orphan
ages, says Teodorescu.
"There's this complete subtext," she con
tinues, now referring to the play. "|The audi
ence has] to realize what's going on. You all
spoke in that silence."
And within the pages of Churchill's script,
silence speaks volumes.
Kuftinec cites the writing as one reason
she chose to direct "Mad Forest." "I was real
ly interested in the way Churchill took an
event, a current event — the Romanian revo
lution, and wrote around it. Didn't try to cre
ate a documentary, but worked to look at the
social context."

In addition to her Eastern European her
itage, Kuftinec's interest in

how theatre intersects
with politics also led her

to "Mad Forest." For

her, the play's theme posed intriguing
questions.
"What was the life of the individual
within this large event and how did the
event work with the individual's mindset?
How did they affect each other? How do
these people, in a way, contribute to their
own oppression?"

Churchill bulldozes through uncharted
territory, mapping out answers to some of
these questions in the second act. Com
prised of a series of monologues, this act
introduces 11 new characters, each of
whom addresses the audience and relates
where they were and what they saw happen
during revolution.
Based on interviews Churchill held
while visiting Romania, the monologues
supply stinging realism to an already pow
erful play.
Freshman Hristo Stephanov, who wit
nessed the events on television from his
home in Bulgaria, relates his own story
with similar intensity. (Ceausescu had just
returned from Iran and had decided to
reaffirm his authority through a speech in
response to the events in Timosoara — i.e.
the government shooting demonstrators
supporting a Hungarian priest held pris
oner by the secret police).
"[Ceausescu] was speaking and sud
denly people started booing, just started
whistling and shouting stuff. Of course,
you couldn't hear anything but it was like a
very frightening noise — the crowd being
silent, sort of a clapping noise.
"You can't really hear a single clap, but you
know it's that sound," he describes, slowly
simulating a clapping motion. "And then the
sound totally changes. It's like the nice wind
on the beach that suddenly turns into a ty

| saw] a totally different studio and somebody
translating while everything is going on ...
and then I realized that they had just set up a
table in front of a camera in the T.V. building
and they were reading speeches and stuff.
"They had just started transmitting Ro
manian programs on the second channel of
Bulgarian T.V.," Stephanov continues. "1 ac
tually saw the trial .... When they actually

phoon. [Ceausescu] just stopped. I think he
got really scared. He couldn't say anything.
"Some people started climbing on top of
the buildings and the policemen just couldn't
contain the crowd," he explains. "[Ceauses
cu] called a helicopter to come to the top of
the building."
After flying him, his wife and his body
guards from the scene, Ceausescus en
tourage realized the danger and ditched the
dictator and his wife in the countryside, ac
cording to Stephanov.
"One day, I just turned on the T.V. ... I

shot [the Ceausescus), they showed that. It
was really, really scary. It's not like the vio
lence in the movies you see here."
At first, Stephanov, who plays Mihai in
"Mad Forest," didn't believe a two-hour play
could adequately capture the history and sig
nificance of the events. But now, he says, he
sees the short scenes as depicting realistic
fragments of Romanian life.
"I think the play tells very well about the
soul of the Romanian people, their mindset."
" I here's no one truth," Kuftinec says. "It's
hard to read a history book about the Ro
manian revolution, or about anything in Ro-

l iLUUSTR \1 K V\\ X BI DM 1

mania for that matter, first of all, it's a culture
that communicates through myth and story
telling. If a metaphor can relate a truth better
than the actual truth, [Romanians] will pick
a metaphor, an exaggeration because the
facts are less important that the idea."
Quite fittingly, the third act opens
with two metaphorical characters, a
vampire and a dog. The dog whines
about his previous master mistreating him,
then begs the vampire to take care of him.
After vainly shooing the dog, the vampire
asks it it it would like to become a vampire,
too. The dog says yes and the scene ends with
the vampire sinking his teeth into the dogs
neck.
A simplistic analysis would interpret the
vampire as symbolizing Romania's new
leader lon lliescu and the dog as representing
the defeated Romanian people. But Kuftinec
sees another level to the scene.
"Hegel writes about the master-slave di
alectic. The master is only the master when
the slave recognizes the master's authority
and power. It's a scene about someone be
coming a slave, someone participating in
their own enslavement in order to get some
thing — security, food.
"There is a transaction that has to do both

with power and authority, but it's a trans
action the dog makes. And that's, I think,
the most important element of the scene..
. the individual's participation in his or her
own oppression."
A scathing criticism, indeed.
Hegel and Kuftinec, however, aren't the
only ones to espouse this belief. According
to Kuftinec, the idea also surfaced in Czech

leader Vaclav Havel's 1989 state of the
union address which told the people they
could no longer blame the communist sys
tem for their grievances, they had to look
within.
"There would be no Ceausescu if there
weren't 20 million Romanians allowing
themselves to live within that system,"
Kuftinec adds.
"What do you do with the people who
compromise themselves just to save their
families, or just have food for their chil
dren?" Teodorescu asks. "How do you deal
with just such things as the language ol the
past? People who still speak in that social
ist realism or the jargon of the past?
They're not meaning anything bad by it,
but other people get very offended."
The third act continues with the Vladus
and the Antonescus raising many of these
same questions as they attempt to adjust to
Iliescu's Romania.

Radu (Geoff Sobelle) discovers his mother,
Flavia (Caroline Vix), may lose her job be
