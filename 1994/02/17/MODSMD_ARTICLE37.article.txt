# Love in the bushes
## 'The Cement Garden' delivers unexpected romance 
### 
While Disney's February release "My Fa
ther the Hero" hints at incest, Andrew Birkin's
very un-Disney love-among-the-ruins film
"The Cement Garden" paints a more surreal,
disturbing vision of sibling sexual relations.
Although Disney handles this tender issue
with jokes and jibes, the film adaptation of
lan McEwan's "The Cement Garden" is all too
serious. It is the seductive story of Jack (An
drew Robertson), a typically troubled 16-
year-old. Jack's father, a strange character in
this distinctive picture, decides to cover the
garden with cement. Almost as soon as he has
begun, however, he suddenly dies, presum
ably of a heart attack.
As Jack's mother deteriorates from some
unknown affliction, responsibility for the
younger children, Tom and Sue (Ned Birkin
and Alice Courthard), is increasingly placed
with Jack and his older sister Julie (Charlotte
Gainsbourg). An early hint of where the rela
tionship between this curious pair is heading
comes when Jack tickles Julie on her bed,
causing them both to orgasm. From that
point on, every look or peck on the cheek has
layers of meaning and implication.
Yet it is clear from the start that neither of
the two is innocent. Jack has the constant
habit of masturbating — with mirrors, no
less. Also, Julie seems all too aware of her sex
ual power over Jack.
Jack and Julie seem to have created a dream
world where everything is static, but nothing
is ever surprising or new. Sue and Julie even
encourage little brother Tom's desire to dress
up like a girl.
As their make-believe family becomes

threatened by the outside world, Jack and
Julie seem to sink deeper into their dream.
Their increasingly heightened awareness of
each other becomes more believable — and
more acceptable. Only when Julie's older
boyfriend realizes Jack's and Julie's feelings for
each other do we again grasp the grotesque
ness of this sordid tableau.
And yet, the beauty of their relationship re
mains, despite what society may say about it.
Incredibly, this film is so artistically crafted
that it makes you wish that Jack, Julie and their
little family could continue living in their little
fantasy world, where Tom sleeps in a crib and
drinks from a bottle, Sue writes letters to her
now dead mother, Jack lives in a state of con
stant arousal and Julie blithely lies in the half
cemented garden trying to get a tan.
The music (and sometimes the lack there
of) is perfect. It sufficiently conveys a mood
without telling the audience what to think or
what's coming up next. Best of all, composer
Edward Shearmer knew when to stay silent:
without the false Hollywood-style back
ground music in every possible scene, "The
Cement Garden" becomes all the more realis
tic, making it all the more haunting.
The setting is appropriately vague, with ru
inous buildings giving it a post-apocalyptic
feel. The family's house is an unadorned cube
set in the middle of a rubble-strewn plain,
with forbidding high-rises off in the distance.
The garden itself is a nightmare, with grinning
elf statuettes and weeds running rampant.
What is truly memorable, however, are the
disturbing visual pictures which the film
seems to burn into the brain. The first is when

Jack's father dies, falling onto the cement
which he had been spreading and leaving a
cast of his body as it took its final breath — a
scene which is alternated with flashes of Jack
masturbating in the bathroom. The final
image is one that will both thrill and chill you
and stay in your mind for a long time after
leaving the theater.
This film seems to be so many still-action
photographs rolled together, each shot vi

brant and well thought-out. Yet there is no
question that this work is cohesive — each
scene glides fluidly into the next, so much so
that there is almost no question as to where
we are being led. "The Cement Garden" never
becomes stale, however, because even though
we anticipate the end, the journey is so shock
ing to our politically-correct minds that we
don't seem to fully admit it.
