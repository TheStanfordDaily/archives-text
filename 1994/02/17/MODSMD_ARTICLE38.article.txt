# My Father the Hero
## screens 
### 
When you look at a guy like Gerard De
pardieu, all nose and shaggy head, you figure
it must be his acting ability that made him so
famous. But after seeing this movie, you start
to wonder.
Perhaps someone thought it would be a
good idea: take a famous actor, pair him with
two good-looking American rising stars, and
make a quick-moving romantic comedy. The
only problem was the result: a slow, boring,
unconvincing love

story.
"My Father the
Hero" stars Depar
dieu as Andre, the
father of Nicole
(Katherine Heigl), a
beautiful yet spoiled
14-year-old (a
rather, um, well-de
veloped 14-year
old). Andre, who
has not seen his
daughter for years,
takes her on vaca
tion to the Bahamas
in the hopes of get
ting closer to her.
The rest of the
movie is basically a

"Three's Company"-esque "misunderstand
ing." Nicole lies to a studly beach boy at the
hotel (Dalton James) and tells him Andre is
her lover. The rest of the hotel, full of poten
tially offensive tourist stereotypes, reviles the
poor, uncomprehending Andre.
Eventually Andre learns of his bratty
daughter's now complex set of lies, but then
incredibly goes along with it so his daughter
can find her true love.
In one scene, the director makes a lame
effort to recall the famous "Cyrano de Berg
erac" scene where Depardieu whispers
words of love to pass on to his lover on the
balcony. But seeing the big lunkhead
crouched and whispering to Heigl on a
beach just makes you shake your head in
shame for the guy. Good and bad movies
don't mix, Gerry.
Finally the movie resorts to overdrawn
slapstick scenes. But who wants to see 10
minutes of Depardieu on water skis?
The only reason you might spend any
money on this movie is to pant over the lithe
Heigl or Adonis-like James, who immediate
ly stole the heart of my Valentine's Day date.
Emma Thompson makes a surprise ap
pearance in the last few seconds of the movie
as Depardieu's previously anonymous girl
friend. But that and Depardieu's goofy
"French-dude-without-a-clue" expressions
do little to salvage this unmemorable mo
ment in cinematic history.
