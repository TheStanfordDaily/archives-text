# Ace Ventura, Pet Detective
## 
### 
With a predictable plot, no character de
velopment and some downright embarrass
ing acting, the burden of carrying "Ace Ven
tura, Pet Detective" falls solely on star Jim
Carrey's performance. While it's true that no
other actor could pull off a character like Ace,
Carrey still dampens the hilarity of the film
by going overboard.
Directed by Tom Sheydac, the film show
cases Carrey's zany antics. Carrey, famous
for his multitude of ridiculous characters on
"In Living Color" — like the psychotic,
never-ceases-smiling Fire Marshall Bill and
the hormonally imbalanced Vera de Milo —
makes and breaks "Ace Ventura."
Set in Florida on the eve of the Super
Bowl, the film centers on the kidnapping of
Snowflake, the Miami Dolphins' team mas
cot. Following the advice of an admirer of the
pet detecting profession, the Dolphins' mar
keting director, Melissa Robinson (Courtney
Cox), hires Ace to solve the kidnapping.
When Ace discovers the jewel from a 1984
Super Bowl ring in the filter of Snowflake's
tank, he knows he's on to something. Ace
goes so far as to hide in Don Shula's mailbox,
snatching the unsuspecting hand of the es
teemed coach to frantically check for a miss
ing jewel. The plot "thickens" as Dan Mari
no, playing himself, joins the kidnapped.
And there's something fishy about the way

police investigator Lt. Einhorn (played atro
ciously by Sean Young) isn't too enthusiastic
about Ace's progress in solving the crime.
So goes the recycled plot. At times Carrey
adds to the predictability. For instance, his
contorted lip horse laugh and "re-he-he
heallys" got old quickly.
While Carrey grows continually irritating
with his non-stop adherence to the role of
the wacky pet detective, there are a few mo
ments of comic genius which make the
movie bearable. Carrey's natural talent is
highlighted in one scene where he must con
vince a doctor of his insanity. Adorned in a
pink tutu and spiked hair, with uncanny con
trol over his body and facial muscles, Carrey
replays a football touchdown in slow motion
which is frightcningly realistic.
If you're willing to forgive the faults and
focus on the funny parts of the movie, then "Ace
Ventura" might be worth the matinee pricc.
