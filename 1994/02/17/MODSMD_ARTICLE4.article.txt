# Figures released for Student Affairs cuts
## Proposed numbers debated at town meeting 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
Preliminary budget cut
targets announced at yes
terday's town hall meeting
reveal that the Dean of
Students' office will be
hardest hit, while Cowell
Student Health Center
and the Haas Center for
Public Service are expect
ed to be mostly spared.
Addressing an audience

of about 120 in Kresge Auditorium,
Provost Condoleezza Rice and the Student
Affairs "management team" tackled such
volatile issues as the future of the four eth
nic centers, the restructuring of Tresidder
Union and Residential Education's pro
posed merger with Housing and Dining
Services.

But the relatively specific nature of the
announcements did little to quell the fears
of many students and staff members, who
say they have felt alienated from the deci
sion-making process.
After explaining that Student Affairs is
striving to cut 5 percent to 10 percent from
its operating budget of $16.2 million in the
first year of reductions, Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds detailed the
process through which the eight individual
unit proposals were melded into one cohe
sive preliminary plan.
Most of the 15 percent to 20 percent bud
get cuts to the Dean of Students office will
come from the restructuring of retail ser
vices at Tresidder, said Dean of Students
Michael Jackson. In addition, the Office of
Student Affairs will be merged formally into
the Dean of Students' office, as will New


Edmonds
