# Figures released for Student Affairs cuts
## Proposed numbers debated at town meeting 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
Preliminary budget cut
targets announced at yes
terday's town hall meeting
reveal that the Dean of
Students' office will be
hardest hit, while Cowell
Student Health Center
and the Haas Center for
Public Service are expect
ed to be mostly spared.
Addressing an audience

of about 120 in Kresge Auditorium,
Provost Condoleezza Rice and the Student
Affairs "management team" tackled such
volatile issues as the future of the four eth
nic centers, the restructuring of Tresidder
Union and Residential Education's pro
posed merger with Housing and Dining
Services.

But the relatively specific nature of the
announcements did little to quell the fears
of many students and staff members, who
say they have felt alienated from the deci
sion-making process.
After explaining that Student Affairs is
striving to cut 5 percent to 10 percent from
its operating budget of $16.2 million in the
first year of reductions, Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds detailed the
process through which the eight individual
unit proposals were melded into one cohe
sive preliminary plan.
Most of the 15 percent to 20 percent bud
get cuts to the Dean of Students office will
come from the restructuring of retail ser
vices at Tresidder, said Dean of Students
Michael Jackson. In addition, the Office of
Student Affairs will be merged formally into
the Dean of Students' office, as will New


Edmonds
Student Orientation programs.
The heart of Jackson's mes
sage, however, lay in the much
publicized debate over budget
reductions to the four ethnic cen
ters.
The centers will not be facing
significant changes, Jackson said.
"Let the headline read that the
centers are not going to be emas
culated," he added emphatically.
According to Jackson, he is
working with center heads to
develop a strategic plan to be fin
ished next week Which will identi
fy the services the centers should
eliminate, the ones they should
maintain and the ones that
should be changed.
Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions James Montoya
reviewed the restructuring
changes that combined the Office
of Financial Aid with undergradu
ate admissions and detailed a plan
to cut 7 percent of the unit's oper
ating budget.
Beyond the administrative
streamlining such a merger will
produce, Montoya proposed
changing mail and publication

strategies. He also advocated
redesigning the admissions calen
dar to disperse the staff workload
more evenly, allowing some stu
dents to be admitted earlier.
Director of Housing and Din
ing Services Keith Guy could not
attend the meeting, but Edmonds
reiterated that Res Ed is not being
placed "under" Housing and Din
ing Services. Rather, the two are
being combined into a new entity,
she said.
Since the Haas Center relies
heavily on gifts and grants, much
of its funding is not subject to the
Student Affairs reductions, said
Tim Stanton, director of the Haas
Center.
The center can, however, elim
inate one half-time position
designed to help coordinate out
side student efforts, Stanton said,
while warning that this cut would
mean less attention to student ini
tiatives.
Saying he is committed to "cut
ting out administrative layers,"
Registrar Roger Printup's propos
al includes cutting 3.8 to 3.9 per
cent of his budget by merging
offices with similar functions. He
does not expect the cuts to reduce
student services.
The newly appointed director
of Cowell, Ira Freedman, said no

cuts will be made in the center at
this time pending changes in cam
pus health care.
Although this town meeting
is the first of four such efforts
to allow the Stanford communi
ty the chance to examine possi
ble reductions, several audience
members expressed concern
that these decisions have
already been made without the
input of students and staff
members.
"As a staff members, I didn't
feel like I was included in the pro
cess," said Asst. Director of Res
Ed Elizabeth Hiyama. "People
just want to know 'What's the
story?' "
Other staff member aired more
specific fears. ASSU Legal Coun
seling Office Coordinator Jewell
Hudson expressed concern that
Tresidder will be turned into "a
mini shopping mall," losing its
community focus.
Although student attendance
was low, four undergraduates also
voiced concerns about the admin
istration's efficiency and the level
of student involvement in writing
initial budget reduction propos
als.
"In my short time, 21 years, I
have never come across an insti
tution which is so poorly run or

wastes so much money," said
junior Matthew Mizel. "Part of
the reason that students are so
suspicious of what's going on is
that (there) were no students or
faculty on the committee" of unit
managers who collaborated on the
entire proposal.
Students also questioned the
validity of Jackson's assurance
that the ethnic centers would
experience no substantial losses.
"Wouldn't any additional
responsibility on the ethnic cen
ters without additional resources
amount to the same thing as a
cut?" ASSU Senator Vanessa
Alvarado asked.
Alvarado also questioned the
administrators' method of
announcing yesterday's meeting
with a single classified ad in The
Daily Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday.
Although Rice said she would
try to arrange another such meet
ing, she expressed frustration at
sparse student attendance.
"We're really looking for commu
nity input, but people have to
come," Rice said.
The second town hall meeting
will be held next Thursday from 3
to 5 p.m. in Kresge and cover
changes in faculty and staff ser
vices.

of Cowell, Ira Freedman, said no

cuts will be made in the center at
this time pending changes in cam
pus health care.
Although this town meeting
is the first of four such efforts
to allow the Stanford communi
ty the chance to examine possi
ble reductions, several audience
members expressed concern
that these decisions have
already been made without the
input of students and staff
members.
"As a staff members, I didn't
feel like I was included in the pro
cess," said Asst. Director of Res
Ed Elizabeth Hiyama. "People
just want to know 'What's the
story?' "
Other staff member aired more
specific fears. ASSU Legal Coun
seling Office Coordinator Jewell
Hudson expressed concern that
Tresidder will be turned into "a
mini shopping mall," losing its
community focus.
Although student attendance
was low, four undergraduates also
voiced concerns about the admin
istration's efficiency and the level
of student involvement in writing
initial budget reduction propos
als.
"In my short time, 21 years, I
have never come across an insti
tution which is so poorly run or

wastes so much money," said
junior Matthew Mizel. "Part of
the reason that students are so
suspicious of what's going on is
that (there) were no students or
faculty on the committee" of unit
managers who collaborated on the
entire proposal.
Students also questioned the
validity of Jackson's assurance
that the ethnic centers would
experience no substantial losses.
"Wouldn't any additional
responsibility on the ethnic cen
ters without additional resources
amount to the same thing as a
cut?" ASSU Senator Vanessa
Alvarado asked.
Alvarado also questioned the
administrators' method of
announcing yesterday's meeting
with a single classified ad in The
Daily Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday.
Although Rice said she would
try to arrange another such meet
ing, she expressed frustration at
sparse student attendance.
"We're really looking for commu
nity input, but people have to
come," Rice said.
The second town hall meeting
will be held next Thursday from 3
to 5 p.m. in Kresge and cover
changes in faculty and staff ser
vices.

Dean of Students Michael Jackson speaks at a town hall meeting
held yesterday in Kresge Auditorium.
Preliminary budget cut
targets announced at yes
terday's town hall meeting
reveal that the Dean of
Students' office will be
hardest hit, while Cowell
Student Health Center
and the Haas Center for
Public Service are expect
ed to be mostly spared.
Addressing an audience

of about 120 in Kresge Auditorium,
Provost Condoleezza Rice and the Student
Affairs "management team" tackled such
volatile issues as the future of the four eth
nic centers, the restructuring of Tresidder
Union and Residential Education's pro
posed merger with Housing and Dining
Services.

But the relatively specific nature of the
announcements did little to quell the fears
of many students and staff members, who
say they have felt alienated from the deci
sion-making process.
After explaining that Student Affairs is
striving to cut 5 percent to 10 percent from
its operating budget of $16.2 million in the
first year of reductions, Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds detailed the
process through which the eight individual
unit proposals were melded into one cohe
sive preliminary plan.
Most of the 15 percent to 20 percent bud
get cuts to the Dean of Students office will
come from the restructuring of retail ser
vices at Tresidder, said Dean of Students
Michael Jackson. In addition, the Office of
Student Affairs will be merged formally into
the Dean of Students' office, as will New


Edmonds
Student Orientation programs.
The heart of Jackson's mes
sage, however, lay in the much
publicized debate over budget
reductions to the four ethnic cen
ters.
The centers will not be facing
significant changes, Jackson said.
"Let the headline read that the
centers are not going to be emas
culated," he added emphatically.
According to Jackson, he is
working with center heads to
develop a strategic plan to be fin
ished next week Which will identi
fy the services the centers should
eliminate, the ones they should
maintain and the ones that
should be changed.
Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions James Montoya
reviewed the restructuring
changes that combined the Office
of Financial Aid with undergradu
ate admissions and detailed a plan
to cut 7 percent of the unit's oper
ating budget.
Beyond the administrative
streamlining such a merger will
produce, Montoya proposed
changing mail and publication

strategies. He also advocated
redesigning the admissions calen
dar to disperse the staff workload
more evenly, allowing some stu
dents to be admitted earlier.
Director of Housing and Din
ing Services Keith Guy could not
attend the meeting, but Edmonds
reiterated that Res Ed is not being
placed "under" Housing and Din
ing Services. Rather, the two are
being combined into a new entity,
she said.
Since the Haas Center relies
heavily on gifts and grants, much
of its funding is not subject to the
Student Affairs reductions, said
Tim Stanton, director of the Haas
Center.
The center can, however, elim
inate one half-time position
designed to help coordinate out
side student efforts, Stanton said,
while warning that this cut would
mean less attention to student ini
tiatives.
Saying he is committed to "cut
ting out administrative layers,"
Registrar Roger Printup's propos
al includes cutting 3.8 to 3.9 per
cent of his budget by merging
offices with similar functions. He
does not expect the cuts to reduce
student services.
The newly appointed director
of Cowell, Ira Freedman, said no

cuts will be made in the center at
this time pending changes in cam
pus health care.

ty the chance to examine possi
