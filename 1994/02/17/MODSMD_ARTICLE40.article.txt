## Indie sell-outs: Green Day's first major label release 
### 
The first thing old-time fans will notice
when they flip over the new Green Day
album "Dookie" is the Warner Bros, logo in
the corner.
That's because Green Day, formerly one of
the biggest bands in the Bay Area indie punk
scene, signed to Reprise Records, a division of
the gargantuan Warner Bros, corporation. Of
course, when a punk band moves from a small
punk label to a well-paying corporation, many
yell, "Sell-out!" Well, Green Day's style may
have changed slightly on "Dookie," but it
hasn't gone anywhere it wasn't going already.
Originally conceived as Sweet Children in
1989, Berkeley natives Billie Joe
(guitarist/singer/songwriter), bassist Mike,
and drummer Al Sobrante played poppy,
catchy punk music inspired by the Descen
dants. When their first seven-inch record
came out on SKENE! Records, Billie Joe and
Mike were only sixteen and seventeen years
old.
In 1990, drummer Tr£ Cool replaced Al
and the band became Green Day. That year,
the trio (then high school seniors) recorded
the "1,000 Hours" EP, the "Slappy" EP, and
the classic "39/ Smooth" LP on Berkeley's
Lookout! Records ("1039/ Smoothed Out
Slappy Hours" combines these three on CD).
"39/ Smooth" is an amazingly brilliant
teenage punk masterpiece, filled with unbe
lievably melodic, catchy songs, and fast-dri
ving rhythms. The hooks are so strong, one
can sing along just to the bass part. This
album is required listening for anyone who
craves energetic, foot-tapping punk that will
annoy your Top 40-devotce roommate.
Green Day (whose name, incidentally,
refers to days spent doing nothing but smok

ing massive quantities of pot) sings songs
about standard male high school experiences:
girls, sex, pot, girls, growing up, girls, parents
and girls. These songs are simple and honest
without being trite and silly. These experi
ences are universal — everyone knows the
feeling of "Here we go again, infatuation
In late 1991, Green Day (now armed with
high school diplomas) recorded twelve songs
for their second LP, "Kerplunk!" A develop
ment from the style and mentality of their
earlier songs, "Kerplunk!" contains an vari
ety of songs dealing with many subjects. As
well as the hooky pop-punk of "39/ Smooth"
there are mid-tempo rock songs, a marvelous
acoustic number, and a hilarious country
ditty about bondage. While there are still
some teen-romance songs, other subjects in
clude urban decay, insanity, neurosis, leaving
home and slacking. "Kerplunk!" is a good
album, but suffers in comparison to the ge
nius of "39/ Smooth " Clearly, Joe's outlook
had changed since high school, and the song
writing reflects it. In a recent interview for
BAM, Joe said, "On the songs on 'Kerplunk!'
... I was consciously trying to outdo my pre
vious songs."
With the "sophomore slump" of "Ker
plunk!" many fans, ourselves included, were
expecting the worst from the major-label
debut. But "Dookie" is a strong album. Over
all, Green Day has moved away from their
original sound to a sweet "pop-rock" sound
like Sugar. Still, the original attraction of
Green Day is still there in songs like
"Burnout," "Chump," "She," "Emenium
Slecpus" and "In the End."
Catchy pop songs abound, such as "Hav
ing a Blast," "Pulling Teeth," "Basket Case,"

"Sassafras Roots" and "When I Come
Around." "Longview" is easily the best song
on the album, on par with anything from
"39/ Smooth." This song alone should propel
Green Day to the ranks of MTV stardom.
Other standouts include "Welcome to Par
adise" (taken from "Kerplunk!") and "F.0.D."
"Dookie" is easier to swallow on first lis
ten, but still not as great as their first album.

Our advice: go buy "1039/ Smoothed Out
Slappy Hours," and if you love it, then con
sider getting "Dookie." Then, if you're
hooked, get "Kerplunk!" And even better, go
see them live. Green Day puts on one of the
best live shows on the planet. They are play
ing for the Bay Area tonight at SlinVs in San
Francisco.

Green Day to the ranks of MTV stardom.
Other standouts include "Welcome to Par
adise" (taken from "Kerplunk!") and "F.0.D."
"Dookie" is easier to swallow on first lis
ten, but still not as great as their first album.

Our advice: go buy "1039/ Smoothed Out
Slappy Hours," and if you love it, then con
sider getting "Dookie." Then, if you're
hooked, get "Kerplunk!" And even better, go
see them live. Green Day puts on one of the
best live shows on the planet. They are play
ing for the Bay Area tonight at SlinVs in San
Francisco.
