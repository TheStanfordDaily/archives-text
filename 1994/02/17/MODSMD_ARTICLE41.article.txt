Bootfunk, Scaryeire, Articolo 31. Do
these names sound familiar? Well, they are
acts featured on Tommy Boy's exciting new
compilation album showcasing rap acts
from around the world. Groups from such
countries as Brazil, Ireland, Germany and
Japan demonstrate some skill for adding to
this once ail-American art form.
The tracks on this album are enlivened by
a wide range of music that is sometimes
pleasing to the ear. Die Fantastischen Bier of
Germany and London Posse of the United
Kingdom have mastered the craft of making

their voices blend into
the music with their
songs, "Die Da" and
"How's Life In Ix>n
don?"
Some of the
groups produced bril
liant lyrics. Ireland's
Scaryeire wrote a
piece concerning the
homeless crisis and
South Africa's Pro
phets of the City drop

a Public Enemy-style repartee about racism
in their land. Sweden's ADL add a lighter note
to the project with equally clever lyrics that
are reminiscent of the work of Dr. Dre or
Snoop Doggy Dogg.
However, the other four tracks that were
performed in English left something to be
lyrically desired. Groups like Denmark's
Bootfunk, Canada's MVP, and Australia's
Mama's Funkstikools merely try to revive the
old brag rap style by trying to spout who is
the baddest rapper of them all.
Yet they couldn't even do that particular
ly well. In fact, they come across as pitiful.
Budding young rappers on the world's play
grounds could put them to shame.
The lead voice of Italy's Articolo 31 was
horrible. The depressing tone of it simply
dragged to the point that one wonders if this
artist was seeking therapy for his problems.
Nails scratching on a chalk board may be
more pleasing to the ear.
If you listen to rap for the musical con
tent, then you should enjoy most of the se
lections in this compilation. They generally
have an easy flowing beat and distinctive
touches to them. However, if you enjoy
strong, intelligent lyrics and can't speak sev
eral foreign languages, you may purchase
this album and desire to send it off to anoth
er planet altogether.
