# "For Your Own Special Sweetheart" Jawbox
## 
### 
Born and bred on the independent label
Dischord Records, Jawbox has broken into
the mainstream with its new release, "For
Your Own Special Sweetheart." It's major
label time for the foursome from Washing
ton, D.C., and some will be quick to cry,
"sell-out." But the multi-layered guitars and
ferocious vocals on this album surpass either
of their earlier two indie releases.
After listening to the thirteen tracks that
battle and rage over thumping bass lines and
syncopated rhythms, it's got to be time to re
think "sell-out."
Jawbox played under the shadow of
Dischord legend Fugazi for the past three
years to little recognition. The band culti
vated its own sound, and the results are a
distinct break from the thrash punk fury of
Fugazi. Surprising vocal harmonies sur
face from underneath distorted guitar
noise. With a distinct penchant for
melody, vocalists J. Robbins and Bill Bar
bot carry catchy themes throughout the
raucous hooks.

Despite moments of high intensity noise,
Jawbox shows admirable restraint on tracks
like "Savory" and the inexplicable
"LS/MFT." On other tracks like "Chicago
Piano," Robins' voice rages at an angry fever
pitch, bursting intermittently into cathartic
screams.
Jawbox's lyrics also make for great listen
ing. The images are mostly dark, like on the
track "Motorist" which takes rubbernecking
to a new level: "Nothing better than a look at
what I shouldn't see." And a disturbing re
turn from the victim, "This is my wreck so
let it be / cracked cages carry messages for
me."
After the mostly political and social rage
of its Dischord counterparts, the random
lyrical imagery is refreshing. Call it post
angst therapy.
Jawbox recalls the best of power pop as
well as the pounding sound of Helmet
(another major label "sell-out"). But
Dischord has bred something much more
interesting than any of its counterparts.
Jawbox is an example of pure satisfying
guitar rock.
So if "For Your Special Sweetheart" is
the work of a sell-out, I hope that Jawbox
keeps on selling with equally impressive
results.
