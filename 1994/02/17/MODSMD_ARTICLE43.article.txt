# Bright lights, big servings
## Paradise's Persian fare fills you up 
### Travis Conley 
Upon approaching the entrance
to Paradise Restaurant, one is likely
to temporarily forget that "par
adise" originates from the classical
Persian word meaning "garden,"
for the flashing light-studded sign
looming over the doorway leads
one to expect some sort of seedy
strip tease and/or nude mud
wrestling show to lie within. On the
contrary, what I discovered was a
wholesome little restaurant with
friendly service and excellent food
at a reasonable price.
The interior decor centers on a
'70s trailer-house motif, complete
with faded, wood-paneled walls
covered with oil paintings of ocean
waves and autumn woodland
scenes. Iranian folk music, emitted

very softly, almost subliminally, in
the background, helps redirect
one's attention to the main event:
the kabob.
Why, you might ask, focus on
only one type of dish? Because no
self-respecting Iranian-American
would admittedly betray home
cooking by eating out. The one ex
ception to this is the char-broiled
kabob, which is too troublesome to
prepare at home on a regular basis.
Therefore, most Persian restau
rants, Paradise being no exception,
must specialize in kabobs in order
to stay in business.
This is not to say, however, that
their other dishes aren't worth try
ing. In fact, the sweet, slightly cin
namony eggplant appetizer, the

tantalizing minestrone-like ash
reshteh and my dining compan
ion's chicken entree in a sassy
pomegranate and walnut sauce
were all superb. The latter was sim
ilar in appearance and taste to the
mole poblano of Mexican cuisine.
The ash reshteh, my personal fa
vorite, is a vegetable and noodle
soup that owes its distinctive flavor
to mint leaves and kashk, a special
yogurt-like ingredient typical of
Persian cooking.
I ordered the kabob koobideh:
succulent ground beef, minced
onions and spices mixed together
and broiled on a skewer. Grilled
tomato halves are optional but high
ly recommended to compliment the
somewhat heavy flavor of the beef.

Everything is served
over a generous por
tion of saffron rice. I
was, to say the least,
very satisfied. Some
mildly spiced Iranian
tea (which, as with
Chinese tea, should
never be taken during
a meal) provided a
soothing closure to
the evening.
The waiters were

attentive and courteous, and the
courses were served at what seemed
to be an intentionally slower than
average pace. This is one of the
restaurant's greatest merits, for one
is able to relax and properly savor
the food without feeling rushed.

Phone: 968-5949
Recommendation: For the price, it's a
really good deal. Give it a try.

Don't come to Paradise if you are in
a hurry. The price averages about
$10 per person â€” quite cheap for
such filling portions.
Actually, I was a bit disappointed
that there wasn't a belly dancing per
formance. I guess the sign above the
entrance had raised my hopes a bit.
