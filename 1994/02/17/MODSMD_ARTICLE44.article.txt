### 
The Accompanist
As the latest French film about beau
tiful, tormented people in the world
of classical music, "The Accompa
nist" proves to be an engrossing
stroll through that never-never land.
Still, any story set in Nazi-occupied
Paris should have some historical
focus. Unfortunately, that reality is
marginalized in this bittersweet love
story. PG
Blink
With afoul-mouthed, bad-tem
pered heroine (Madeline Stowe)
who has regained sight after years
of blindness as the central charac
ter, "Blink" proves to be a good de
tective story with a twist. While
she's predictably stalked by her
neighbor's murderer and falls in
love with the man who protects her,
eerie hallucinations and space-age
medical advances help "Blink"
stand out. R
Golden Gate
Tony-winning writer David Henry
Hwang may have won cheers for

"M. Butterfly," but he gets nothing
but jeers for the failed black come
dy/detective flick "Golden Gate."
Cheesy allusions to Chinese culture
and unrealistic love affairs make this
movie, set in 1950s San Francisco,
a stale one. The casting director
should have known that matching
Matt Dillon and film noir just doesn't
work. R
I'll Do Anything
The latest in a line of Hollywood self
satires, "I'll Do Anything" offers
nothing new or particularly interest
ing. This movie about movie musi
cals stays flimsy throughout, show
casing overacted parts and a weak
plot. If you want to see a good movie
in this vein, stay home and rent "The
Player" or "Sunset Boulevard." PG
-13
In the Name of the Father
Despite appearances by Academy
Award-winning actors Daniel Day-
Lewis and Emma Thompson, "In
the Name of the Father" rarely rises
above melodrama. Instead of focus
ing on how violence can destroy the

life of an everyman, director Jim
Sheridan takes on a well-worn per
spective, opting for courtroom
drama straight out of "L A. Law" and
"Perry Mason." R
Reality Bites
So what if "Reality Bites" is another
movie about twenty-somethings
struggling in the post-college world?
Although no shining rays of wisdom
are revealed in the movie, "Reality
Bites" is a fun movie with a refresh
ing sense of humor. It's immediate
enough for us college students to
forgive its minor flaws. PG-13
Romeo Is Bleeding
When director Peter Medak decided
to direct "Romeo Is Bleeding," he
listened to the wrong voice in his
head. Good casting can't save this
black comedy which really misses.
Ridiculous violence and silly sex
scenes prevent the movie from
going anywhere. About the only
thing going for "Romeo" is actor
Gary Oldman's flawless New York
accent. R

Schindler's List
The dark, haunting images of
Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's
List" overcome the film's charac
ters, leaving moments more im
portant than people. The story of
German entrepreneur Oskar
Schindler and the more than 1,100
Jews he saves leads to an exami
nation of the many faces of evil in
the Nazi regime. With indelible pic
tures of death and degradation
burned in black-and-white film,
"Schindler's List" captures the
truth of the more than six million
murders carried out just a half cen
tury ago. R
What's Eating Gilbert Grape?
"Gilbert Grape" isn't just another
trite "coming-of-age" flick. It's a
fresh portrayal of how reclusive
Gilbert (Johnny Depp) emerges
from the burdens of family life to find
love. The performances are excel
lent: Leonard DiCapricio, who plays
Gilbert's mentally retarded brother,
receive an Oscar nomination for his
riveting work. Above all that, of neat
symbols and metaphors! PG-13
