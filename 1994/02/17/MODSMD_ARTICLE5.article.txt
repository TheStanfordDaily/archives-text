# Grad tuition plan bills Stanford $2.1M a year
## 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Starting in 1997, graduate students who
work on federally funded research projects
will get their tuition money in a different way
under a new plan announced yesterday.
The revised system will cost the Universi
ty about $2.1 million a year. However, the
change should not significantly affect the
number of graduate students receiving such
tuition support or the amount of money they
receive, according to Charles Kruger, vice

provost and dean of research and graduate
policy.
Currently, tuition for graduate students
working on sponsored research projects is
charged to the staff benefits pool as an indi
rect cost — an expense not directly linked to
the focus of the research.
However, as part of an ongoing federal re
evaluation of how to deal with indirect costs,
the government has changed its rules so that
universities cannot engage in tuition remis-
sion afler 1997.
So Stanford has created the
new system for charging tuition
for student researchers, who gen
erally take classes half time and
are charged 62 percent of full-time
tuition.
Under the new plan,
researchers will ask for 40 percent
of full-time tuition per graduate
student assistant as a direct
charge when they submit funding
proposals, Kruger said.
The remaining money — equal
to 22 percent of full-time tuition
— will be paid out of the Universi
ty's pool of general funds, hence
the $2.1 million annual loss.
The system will work a little
differently at the School of
Medicine, where 50 percent of
tuition will be directly charged.

The remaining money at the Med
ical School — as well as at the
School of Business — will be paid
through a dean's subsidy.
Kruger said the change in the
way gradu&te research assistant
tuition is funded should not signif
icantly affect the amount of money
graduate students pay.
The change also should not
greatly increase the cost of
research projects, Kruger said.
Although new direct costs will be
added to grant proposals, the
removal of tuition remission will
lower the staff benefit charges, so
the overall price tag on the grant
proposal won't increase signifi
cantly, he said.
A large increase in the amount
of funding researchers seek would
likely have led to a decrease in the
number of grants approved.
The $2.1 million loss to the
University is unfortunate in tight
fiscal times, but Stanford has
already factored the loss into its

revenue predictions, said Chief
Financial Officer Peter Van Etten.
That means that the loss is includ
ed in the current budget-cutting
effort, he said.
The 40 percent figure was cho
sen to keep research costs and
University losses as small as possi
ble while still funding graduate
students adequately, Van Etten
said.
Staff members analyzed how
recent grants would have been
affected by different direct charge
rates, and picked 40 percent as the
best balance, Kruger said.
Kruger said he is optimistic
that the new system will work.
Still, Van Etten said he believes
tuition remission is a better sys
tem.
"We are continuing to work
with the federal government to
assure them that this is not good
policy," Van Etten said of the
forced end to tuition remission.
"We haven't given up."
