# $150M sale of bonds to finance quake repairs
## University increases public debt to approximately $650M, maintains good credit rating 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Stanford held a very successful sale
yesterday morning.
In just a few hours, the University
sold $150 million in taxable bonds to in
stitutional investors to finance repairs
and building projects over the next five
years, according to Chief Financial Offi
cer Peter Van Etten.
The bond issue raises Stanford's total
outstanding debt, encompassing long
and short-term financing, to approxi
mately $650 million. However, Van

Etten said the additional burden should
not affect the University's good credit
rating.
"We believe that we have the ability to
issue some additional debt without los
ing our AAA rating," he said. "We have
the capability for additional debt."
The decision to sell taxable bonds for
the first time in the University's history
was made after about a year of studying
financial options, Van Etten said.
Stanford will spend $500 million in
the next five years on capital improve
ments. According to Van Etten, the $350
million not earned through taxable

bonds will be obtained from University
reserves and fund-raising efforts.
A large portion of the funding,
around $150 million, will be used for re
pairs stemming from the Loma Prieta
earthquake in 1989. Under normal cir
cumstances, the University would not
begin construction unless adequate
funding was available through fund rais
ing or other channels, Van Etten said.
"In this case, it was critically impor
tant to begin the repairs immediately,"
he added, explaining that the bonds will
therefore cover a funding shortfall.
The sale yesterday proceeded normal

ly, Van Etten said, with institutional in
vestors buying large number of bonds
which they will in turn sell to individuals
interested in acquiring a piece of Stan
ford's debt.
The bonds sold at a "very favorable
price" with a total annual cost of 7.01
percent to the University, he said.
"There are probably very few institu
tions that issued bonds at so favorable a
rate," he added.
The new issues are 30-year maturity
bonds which, according to Van Etten,
are the most cost effective given
current market conditions and low
interest rates. "At 30 years, this
was the most favorable rates we
could get, balancing the needs we
had," he said. "Most of the invest

ments we're going to make were
for buildings that would last at
least 30 years."
Upcoming repairs include con
struction on the Geology and Lan
guage corners of the Quad as well
as the Stanford Art Museum, Van
Etten added.
Additional funds will be used for
the renovation of buildings on the
inner Quad to bring them into

compliance with a Santa Clara
ordinance passed immediately
after the earthquake. The ordi
nance requires the rebuilding "of
all unreinforced buildings by the
year 2000," Van Etten said.
Other construction projects,
including dormitory renovation
and new construction, will also be
financed by the new issue, he
added.
