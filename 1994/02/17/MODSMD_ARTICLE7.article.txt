Police are searching for a
man who was seen publicly mas
turbating at Stanford Stadium
around 3 p.m. Sunday after
noon.
A Stanford senior said she no
ticed a man standing in one of
the tunnels who had his shorts
pulled down in front. He was in a
visible state of arousal, she
added.
When she walked by the man,
the senior said, she heard him
say, "Oops."
"I thought he was taking a
leak or something," she said.
She then started her work
out. The man would hide behind
the stands when she looked in
his direction, the senior said.
After other people exercising
in the stadium left, the woman
said she saw the suspect en
gaged in an act of public mastur
bation.
"He came out in full view and
then he really started going at
it," said the student, who then
went home and called the police.
The suspect is described as a
20 to 25-year-old white male, 5
feet 7 or 8 inches tall. He has
short curly brown hair, medium
to fair complexion, and a thin
runners build.
He was last observed wearing
a brown T-shirt and black
shorts with white stripes on the
side.
