# SHAC holds meeting concerning proposed anti-panhandling law

He has been asked "Are you a
bum?" straight to his face. "I hate
beggars," a 20-ish yuppie told him
once.
To some of the people at an in
formational town meeting on ag
gressive panhandling yesterday,
the man who has been regularly ac
cused of victimizing is in many
ways a victim as well.
The testimony of an anony
mous, homeless panhandler was
read yesterday afternoon in down
town Palo Alto's All Saints Church
as part of a town meeting spon
sored by the Stanford Homeless
ness Action Coalition (SHAC) in an
attempt to preempt local anti-ag
gressive panhandling legislation.
"If you have money and securi
ty, Palo Alto is a nice place to hide
out from the world," the man said.
An anti-aggressive panhandling
law "would be misdirected and ex
cessive" and "subtly force panhan
dlers to go to other cities," he con
tinued, denying that there is a

"need for regulation simply be
cause we are visible."
Palo Alto City Attorney Ariel
Calonne said no steps have been
taken to make laws against aggres
sive panhandling yet, but recog
nized the need to respond "to peo
ple who feel threatened, who feel
their personal safety is at risk."
"Our office now is in a wait-and
see mode," Calonne said. "This is
not a problem you fix by passing a
law. We're keenly aware of consti
tutional issues involved, and look
forward to helping the communi
ty"
Lt. Don Hartnett, a watch com
mander for the Palo Alto Police De
partment, said he does not see "a
magic solution" to aggressive pan
handling. The problem is that
some homeless people are content
with their lives, he said, and "are
not ready to get out of the situation
they're in."
Although people are becoming
less tolerant and the panhandling
situation is getting worse, Hart

Palo Alto resident Margaret Ash speaks yesterday at a meeting to discuss anti-panhandling legislation.
nett added, "Palo Alto is a safe
place to be."
Margaret Ash, who has been a
citizen of Palo Alto since 1975,
agreed that Palo Alto is "a nice
place to live, with a good heart,
generally speaking." She suggested
that people feel threatened because
of "a deeper psychological fear"
that they could also become home
less.
Others said they believe that
aggressive panhandlers threaten
their businesses. In written testi
mony, Odette Batis of Mock Pho
tography — a business on Univer

sity Avenue — complained that
panhandlers call her customers
vile names and use her back door
as a bathroom. "They cut down on
business . . . and sales tax revenue
which helps the city," Batis said.
Nevertheless, the sentiment at
the meeting was overwhelmingly
against any form of an anti-aggres
sive panhandling law.
SHAC member Theo Emery, a
senior, said that to pass such a law
would be "to turn our heads the
other way."
Homeless panhandlers "cannot
be discarded as so much garbage
and brushed into shelters," Emery
said, stressing that the issues are
lack of jobs, a low minimum wage
and a shortage of low-income hous
ing.

"Until we address those prob
lems rather than those victimized
by them, we won't get anywhere,"
he said.
The meeting was not completely
negative, however, as "Viking Vic"
— a man who identified himself as
a passive panhandler — thanked
the people of Palo Alto who "have
been very nice to me." He said that
because of the "windows of oppor
tunities" they have provided, "my
life has come together."
Senior Lily Batchelder, a direc
tor of SHAC, said the town meet
ing aimed to demonstrate "how
unenforceable and unethical" an
anti-aggressive panhandling law
would be. The "initiative for this
meeting came from the homeless
people," she said.
