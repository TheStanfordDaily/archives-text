He has been asked "Are you a
bum?" straight to his face. "I hate
beggars," a 20-ish yuppie told him
once.
To some of the people at an in
formational town meeting on ag
gressive panhandling yesterday,
the man who has been regularly ac
cused of victimizing is in many
ways a victim as well.
The testimony of an anony
mous, homeless panhandler was
read yesterday afternoon in down
town Palo Alto's All Saints Church
as part of a town meeting spon
sored by the Stanford Homeless
ness Action Coalition (SHAC) in an
attempt to preempt local anti-ag
gressive panhandling legislation.
"If you have money and securi
ty, Palo Alto is a nice place to hide
out from the world," the man said.
An anti-aggressive panhandling
law "would be misdirected and ex
cessive" and "subtly force panhan
dlers to go to other cities," he con
tinued, denying that there is a

"need for regulation simply be
cause we are visible."
Palo Alto City Attorney Ariel
Calonne said no steps have been
taken to make laws against aggres
sive panhandling yet, but recog
nized the need to respond "to peo
ple who feel threatened, who feel
their personal safety is at risk."
"Our office now is in a wait-and
see mode," Calonne said. "This is
not a problem you fix by passing a
law. We're keenly aware of consti
tutional issues involved, and look
forward to helping the communi
ty"
Lt. Don Hartnett, a watch com
mander for the Palo Alto Police De
partment, said he does not see "a
magic solution" to aggressive pan
handling. The problem is that
some homeless people are content
with their lives, he said, and "are
not ready to get out of the situation
they're in."
Although people are becoming
less tolerant and the panhandling
situation is getting worse, Hart
