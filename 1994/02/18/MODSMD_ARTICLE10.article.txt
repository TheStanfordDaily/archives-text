SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — Convoys of Bosnian Serb
artillery withdrew from the hills
around Sarajevo yesterday in compli
ance with a NATO ultimatum to pull
back or be bombed. "We do think the
war in Sarajevo is finally over," Bosni
an Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said.
The pullout reported by U.N. mon
itors followed a pledge by Karadzic to
meet NATO's Sunday deadline. He
made the concession under pressure
from Russia.
Karadzic spoke with reporters after
meeting with Vitaly Churkin, Russia's
special envoy, in Pale, the Bosnian
Serb stronghold southeast of Sarajevo.
Lt. Col. Bill Aikman, a U.N.
spokesman in the shell-shattered
Bosnian capital, would not specify what
sort of equipment was being with
drawn, but said "we're talking heavy
weapons."

"Literally they're moving out in
convoys, not in individual vehicles,"
he said. "Clearly there's a major with
drawal going on."
He said U.N. monitors saw convoys
of equipment moving off the hills, and
U.N. commanders received informa
tion that withdrawals meeting NATO
conditions would be completed within
36 hours.
It was the first significant Serb
withdrawal of heavy guns since NATO
issued its ultimatum Feb. 9. NATO
has said all heavy guns within a 13-
mile radius of Sarajevo must be
removed or placed under U.N. control
by Sunday or face NATO bombard
ment.
U.N. and NATO officials earlier
reported foot-dragging by the Serbs.
Aikman called the quickening pace of
Serb withdrawals "a very heartening
sign."

The Russians have been the most
powerful ally of the Serbs, their fellow
Slavs and Orthodox Christians.
Churkin said the Serbs had agreed to
withdraw their heavy weapons from
around the Bosnian capital in
exchange for a Russian promise to
contribute soldiers to any new peace
keeping duties in the city.
Bosnian Serb generals railed
against the NATO ultimatum in a
reflection of the frustration of having
to pull back and lose battlefield
advantage.
The generals have defied Karadzic
before, and it was unclear if they
would honor promises made by their
political leadership.
President Clinton told reporters in
Washington yesterday,"I hope the air
strikes will not be necessary, and they
will not occur if the Serbs will com
ply •"
