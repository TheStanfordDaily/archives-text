ference offered thought-pro
voking speakers and addressed a rel
evant topic, only about 400 students
and community members attended.
While the annual conference is an
excellent chance to discuss current
social problems, it may draw more
participants in the future with
increased student support.
The topic — "Cities in Crisis" —
was a good idea, attracting speak
ers from such realms as education,
politics, religion and the media.
Tangible topics such as this one
may seem more urgent to students
than last year's focus, the gap
between university and communi
ty. Such pertinent subjects should
attract more student participants.
This year's speakers were not as
well-known as speakers at past
conferences, but the quality and
diversity of their experience was,
in this case, more important than

their visibility.
Many speakers stayed around
after their speeches or panels to par
ticipate in workshops and talk with
students. Such interaction can help
make students' experiences even
more positive.
The conference also does a good
job of getting student groups in
volved by asking them to co-spon
sor related events. More student
groups should make an effort to
play a role in Stanford's largest stu
dent-run conference by sponsoring
events and by just showing up.
If more groups take on a leader
ship role in the conference, a greater
number and wider variety of stu
dents are bound to want to join in.
The You Can Make a Difference
Conference is fine opportunity to
educate students and the Stanford
community about contemporary
issues in a lively, interactive fashion.
But, to make a real difference,
students must take the first step.
