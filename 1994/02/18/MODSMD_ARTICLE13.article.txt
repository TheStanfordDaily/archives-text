STANFORD STUDENTS may
be able to enjoy ESPN
Sports Center and MTV's
Headbanger's Ball in the future if
a plan to expand residence cable
service is implemented.
The additional channels added
to SUNet would be available to
students — for a price — as part of
joint effort between Library and
Information Resources and the
office of the vice provost for Stu
dent Affairs.
If all goes as planned, the ser
vice will be available on a trial
basis in some residences as early
as next year.
This is a service that is long
overdue to students, and the
details should be worked out as
soon as possible so that everyone
who wants it can get it. Since stu
dents would be paying for the addi
tional service, there is no reason
the University should not offer
cable as soon as possible.
The ASSU Senate Student

Affairs committee has been look
ing into cable options for years
because of the high student
interest expressed in such a ser
vice.
Since the vast majority of Stan
ford students — over 90 percent —
live on-campus, they are often cut
off from some of the luxuries that
off-campus apartments offer, such
as cable and more varied eating
choices.
The fact that big basketball
games — like Duke vs. North Car
olina — often send Stanford stu
dents to Halftime Sports Bar and
other places that have ESPN
should tell administrators that
this option is important to stu
dents. Students should not have to
feel they are missing out merely
because they live on campus.
When it's late and the work is
done, what better way is there for
a student to unwind than watch
ing Beavis and Butt-head set a cat
on fire?
