## Stephen Krasner Information needed to discuss diversity 
### 
STANFORD AIMS to achieve diversi
ty and excellence. Definitions of
diversity, however, differ for differ
ent parts of the University. Moreover,
there is not enough public information to
judge whether the University is achieving
its objectives. Important questions like
the following cannot be answered
because the relevant facts are not pub
licly available.
How are Stanford's policies actually
implemented in practice?
Is there any tension between diversity
and academic excellence?
Are students from different groups
that are given special treatment in under
graduate admissions, including the chil
dren of Stanford graduates, and faculty
and staff, as well as targeted minorities,
performing at about the same level or are
there significant differences? Are there
differences in performance among gradu
ate students from different ethnic groups?
If there are variations in group perfor
mance, how can they be explained? Is the
preparation of students different? Is Uni
versity support different? Are differences
a manifestation of bias?
What groups count in Stanford's mea
sure of diversity? It is hard to tell from
Stanford's policies and practices. The
designation of groups as targeted minori
ties is different for undergraduates on
the one hand and faculty and graduate
students on the other. For undergradu
ate admissions, African-Americans, Mex
ican-Americans and Native Americans

are targeted minorities. For graduate
students and faculty Puerto Ricans are
also included as a targeted category.
The American Medical College Applica
tion Service, which Stanford Medical
School uses, not only lists American Indi
ans, blacks, Mexican Americans, and
Mainland Puerto Ricans as designated cat
egories but also states that "Applicants
who check the box for ethnic consideration
may be expected by the medical school to
demonstrate residence in or involvement
with a community of that ethnic group."
Other schools do not require demonstra
tion of community involvement.
In a comprehensive report on affirma
tive action published around 1991 the
Law School reported that in 1990-91
"The (Faculty Appointments) Committee
has been especially aggressive in the
search for potential candidates of target
ed and under-represented groups. . . .
For 1990-91 the committee's work
resulted in offers to a black woman, a
white woman who is an open lesbian, and
a white man."
Stanford lists Asian-Americans in its
reports on diversity although the propor
tion of Asian-Americans at Stanford is
higher than the proportion of Asian-
American high school graduates.
The Asian-American category, which
follows ethnicity definitions provided by
the federal government, includes every
one with an ancestry from the Indian
sub-continent to the Pacific islands.
Aside from geography, these groups have

virtually nothing (language, culture, his
tory) in common. Hispanic includes
everyone with origins in Latin America
from Chile to Cuba, as well as in Spain.
Aside from the lack of clear criteria for
determining what groups count for diver
sity, the administration does not provide
enough information for anyone, regard
less of their values, to make a reasoned
judgment about whether Stanford is
accomplishing its goal of excellence and
diversity. Stanford does report on the
number of students by ethnic group, but
there is almost no information on aca
demic attainment at Stanford. The Regis
trar's office could only provide figures for
the number of graduates by ethnicity
which show that there is no variation in
graduation rates for different groups.
For undergraduates, however, there
are no publicly available data by ethnic
group for the means and variances of
grade point averages, or election to Phi
Beta Kappa, or students that encounter
academic difficulty, or other measures
that might provide a more refined assess
ment of academic performance. Such
information could easily be generated.
Universities ought to be committed to
reasoned discussion of critical issues.
Reasoned discussion requires both the
specification of rules for determining
classifications (why target or list some
groups and not others?) as well as infor
mation to evaluate the effectiveness of
