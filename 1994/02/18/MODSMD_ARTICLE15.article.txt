## Senator says leaders should not thwart ASSU reforms 
### 
THE LEAD-IN to last week's Daily
article was correct: if my house
were on fire, I'd want the ASSU
Senate to come over and put it out,
because that is what has happened with
virtually every reform legislation
offered. In my case, the senate took
what momentum there once was on the
issue of districting and governmental
reform, and turned it into another indef
inite, introspective study that has
already begun to fade away into can
celled meetings and will ultimately pro
duce nothing.
At the head of this body is Chair Greg
Waldorf, who has used poor discretion in
handling this situation. Once committed
to doing what it would take to give
undergraduates the opportunity to dis
trict themselves, he has now succumbed
to the Parliamentarian senator Sanford
Dickert, who also happens to be the
chief opponent of the bill. Dickert ruled
that my latest bill cannot be debated on
because it is too similar to my recently
defeated sweeping legislative reform
bill.
Of course, this is the same Senator
Dickert who suggests that my motives
are to run for COP (not true) and that I
really wanted to downsize the senate
using districting as bait (so why would I
introduce this new bill?). Or he's getting
back at me because my bill deserves the
same scrutiny I gave his sound-system
bill. (That bill had enough holes for the
financial manager to recently tell the
senate that the repayment plan he con
cocted to pay for the sound system in
Memorial Auditorium won't work).
I would like the student body to be
aware of this pathetic legislative bicker
ing that is preventing any real improve

ments from coming forth to a campus
wide vote. I have tried over the past sev
eral months to introduce the long
desired concept of districting to under
graduates, and it has become apparent
that my crucial mistake was to include
the senate in this process.
Here is what I have encountered
from some of my fellow senators: ini
tial apathy and disinterest, then resis
tance, and then, after various modifica
tions, a lack of responsibility in not
even reading the new bill. And now,
with another bill before them that
removes downsizing and removes the
time-line structure for imposing dis
tricts, the senate seems poised to bury
this bill under a heap of old by-laws by
calling it"the same bill."
What are other objections? The con
tinued song and dance I hear is that
anything the senate votes to put on the
ballot will automatically be approved.
This is a pathetic and demeaning argu
ment that alleges that your average
voter doesn't understand the five phras
es "geographical districts," "class dis
tricts," "at-large district," "any combi
nation of the three," and "ability to
modify every two years," for that right
there is the essence of the bill. I would
also remind these paranoid senators to
look around them at other legislative
institutions. We routinely see city coun
cils and state legislators vote to put
issues on the ballot precisely because
they want the controversial decisions to
come down to a vote of the people, even
though many of those issues are ones
that these bodies have the power to
decide.
But how can the senate ever put
something on the ballot if it never

meets to do so? We can't hold a meet
ing next week because there have been
too many weeks already in which we
have met, and so our Senate Chair
feels we all need two weeks off. That's
one of the sorriest excuses I've ever
heard to avoid a major issue. If any
thing, the Chair should call everyone
together to make the senate take a
stance on undergraduate districting. Of
course, how can I blame the Chair
when at the end Tuesday's session
barely over one-fourth of elected Sena
tors remained.
The other response I continually hear
is that maybe the reform amendments
that come forth to the senate aren't the
very best possible. So one can hear sena
tors buzzing in response to the recent
executive reform bill: "He's proposing to
have a president and a vice president;
hmm, maybe, but what about three vice
presidents?" And of course, down goes
that bill. Let's assume I choose not to
respond with the very plausible argu
ment that the proposals we have before
us now are better than the status quo.
Instead, I will again point my fellow
senators to the outside world of politics.
When the idea for term limits came to
California, we didn't see one measure,
but two measures. Fancy that — the
notion that if you don't like what's out
there, go out and propose something of
your own.
My fellow senators know that dis
tricting is widely popular among the
majority on campus, yet many of them
are against it because they represent the
minority of the campus. Under the cur
rent system, if I have 300 people as a
strong base support, I can pick up
another 300 random votes from name-

recognition and gain a voting seat. That
system is fine if you believe that the
people who understand the system and
know already whom they want as their
representatives are the ones whom gov
ernment should cater to. Interest-based
voting succeeds because the average
voter plays no importance to candidates
who have secured a voting block. On the
other hand, if you believe in bringing
people directly into the process, like cur
rently-ignored voters, frosh, and mas
ters students, just to name a few, then
the current at-large system does not
work.
It is sad, but true, that out of all this
the senate appears to many non-political
types out there as a roadblock. I have
bent over backward to include the sen
ate in the process of government
reform. I have modified districting
reform to reach a reasonable compro
mise with its opponents, yet I know now
that any bill I put forth is destined for
legislative defeat or bureaucratic dead
lock.
And so I conclude with a public
notice to my fellow senators that they
should check this year's spring ballot,
which will have various proposals for
what they seem to believe are the "une
ducated masses." This past month they
have sent me a message, so now togeth
er I believe we can send them a mes
sage. I hope all ASSU senators enjoy
these two weeks off — I know we'll all
need to rest up before we argue endless
ly about next meeting's Orders of the
Day and last meeting's Minutes.

THE LEAD-IN to last week's Daily
article was correct: if my house
were on fire, I'd want the ASSU
Senate to come over and put it out,
because that is what has happened with
virtually every reform legislation
offered. In my case, the senate took
what momentum there once was on the
issue of districting and governmental
reform, and turned it into another indef
inite, introspective study that has
already begun to fade away into can
celled meetings and will ultimately pro
duce nothing.
At the head of this body is Chair Greg
Waldorf, who has used poor discretion in
handling this situation. Once committed
to doing what it would take to give
undergraduates the opportunity to dis
trict themselves, he has now succumbed
to the Parliamentarian senator Sanford
Dickert, who also happens to be the
chief opponent of the bill. Dickert ruled
that my latest bill cannot be debated on
because it is too similar to my recently
defeated sweeping legislative reform
bill.
Of course, this is the same Senator
Dickert who suggests that my motives
are to run for COP (not true) and that I
really wanted to downsize the senate
using districting as bait (so why would I
introduce this new bill?). Or he's getting
back at me because my bill deserves the
same scrutiny I gave his sound-system
bill. (That bill had enough holes for the
financial manager to recently tell the
senate that the repayment plan he con
cocted to pay for the sound system in
Memorial Auditorium won't work).
I would like the student body to be
aware of this pathetic legislative bicker
ing that is preventing any real improve

ments from coming forth to a campus
wide vote. I have tried over the past sev
eral months to introduce the long
desired concept of districting to under
graduates, and it has become apparent
that my crucial mistake was to include
the senate in this process.
Here is what I have encountered
from some of my fellow senators: ini
tial apathy and disinterest, then resis
tance, and then, after various modifica
tions, a lack of responsibility in not
even reading the new bill. And now,
with another bill before them that
removes downsizing and removes the
time-line structure for imposing dis
tricts, the senate seems poised to bury
this bill under a heap of old by-laws by
calling it"the same bill."
What are other objections? The con
tinued song and dance I hear is that
anything the senate votes to put on the
ballot will automatically be approved.
This is a pathetic and demeaning argu
ment that alleges that your average
voter doesn't understand the five phras
es "geographical districts," "class dis
tricts," "at-large district," "any combi
nation of the three," and "ability to
modify every two years," for that right
there is the essence of the bill. I would
also remind these paranoid senators to
look around them at other legislative
institutions. We routinely see city coun
cils and state legislators vote to put
issues on the ballot precisely because
they want the controversial decisions to
come down to a vote of the people, even
though many of those issues are ones
that these bodies have the power to
decide.
But how can the senate ever put
something on the ballot if it never

meets to do so? We can't hold a meet
ing next week because there have been
too many weeks already in which we
have met, and so our Senate Chair
feels we all need two weeks off. That's
one of the sorriest excuses I've ever
heard to avoid a major issue. If any
thing, the Chair should call everyone
together to make the senate take a
stance on undergraduate districting. Of
course, how can I blame the Chair
when at the end Tuesday's session
barely over one-fourth of elected Sena
tors remained.
The other response I continually hear
is that maybe the reform amendments
that come forth to the senate aren't the
very best possible. So one can hear sena
tors buzzing in response to the recent
executive reform bill: "He's proposing to
have a president and a vice president;
hmm, maybe, but what about three vice
presidents?" And of course, down goes
that bill. Let's assume I choose not to
respond with the very plausible argu
ment that the proposals we have before
us now are better than the status quo.
Instead, I will again point my fellow
senators to the outside world of politics.
When the idea for term limits came to
California, we didn't see one measure,
but two measures. Fancy that — the
notion that if you don't like what's out
there, go out and propose something of
your own.
My fellow senators know that dis
tricting is widely popular among the
majority on campus, yet many of them
are against it because they represent the
minority of the campus. Under the cur
rent system, if I have 300 people as a
strong base support, I can pick up
another 300 random votes from name-

recognition and gain a voting seat. That
system is fine if you believe that the
people who understand the system and
know already whom they want as their
representatives are the ones whom gov
ernment should cater to. Interest-based
voting succeeds because the average
voter plays no importance to candidates
who have secured a voting block. On the
other hand, if you believe in bringing
people directly into the process, like cur
rently-ignored voters, frosh, and mas
ters students, just to name a few, then
the current at-large system does not
work.
It is sad, but true, that out of all this
the senate appears to many non-political
types out there as a roadblock. I have
bent over backward to include the sen
ate in the process of government
reform. I have modified districting
reform to reach a reasonable compro
mise with its opponents, yet I know now
that any bill I put forth is destined for
legislative defeat or bureaucratic dead
lock.
And so I conclude with a public
notice to my fellow senators that they
should check this year's spring ballot,
which will have various proposals for
what they seem to believe are the "une
ducated masses." This past month they
have sent me a message, so now togeth
