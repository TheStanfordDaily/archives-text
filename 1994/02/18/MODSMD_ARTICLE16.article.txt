## The
						curse of happiness: it's a wonderful life 
### 
Happiness is not my middle name. Il
is, more precisely, my first, giver
name. You smirk. You snicker. Yoi
even laugh aloud at my futile plight. Yoi
will pay for such insolence in hell.
My real name, in all its formality
means "happiness." On a bad baby-boot
day it means joy, on a good baby-book da)
it means fist-pumping, triumphant ecsta
sy. Any way you slice it, the name paints i
wonderfully putrid vision of technicoloi
fairies riding on the backs of unicorn. l
down Candy Cane Lane, criss-crossing
rainbows arching overhead.
Sugar and spice and everything nice.
Imagine, if you will, till the Saturday
morning cartoon characters of the univers<
joined together at Disneyland, swapping G
rated stories over caffeine-free cokes anc
Daiiy Queen sundaes. Imagine, a Garani
mal-fest kindergarten choral performanc<
with a dozen toothless smiles belting oui
songs of springtime to their six-figure-earn
ing parents. Imagine, a young couple leav
ing their wedding reception in their neu
Dodge Caravan, souls ready to burst fron
the radiant Velveeta future ahead.

Say cheese.
It is my grandmother's name, a family
inheritance. My grandmother is an amaz
ingly stylish woman. An artist. A grand
dame of grand dames. A woman who can
remember the glory days of weekend
jaunts to Havana and vacations in Jamaica
taken when seaplanes were tne only way to
fly. A woman with a marvelous personali
ty, a quick wit and classic good looks. The
woman is a catch. The woman is amazing.
The woman is "happiness."
Here she comes, Miss America.
I am a worthless, gloom-and-doom cynic,
devoid of even the tiniest ray of sunlight. I
thrive on black clothing, Morrissey and all
that is nice, juicy roadkill roasting on the
highway. I admire morbid, bitter discourse
and bleak, depressing outlooks. I wallow in
my morosity like a swine in her pen, cover
ing myself with layers of mirth in a futile
attempt to shelter myself from the bright
side of life.
A chip ofT the old block.
Yet I am cursed with this name. Cursed
with the knowledge that for all intents and
purposes, I should be a hyperactive aero

bics instructor to the stars, artfully mas
saging the huge pecs of my linebacker
boyfriend between power yoga sessions.
Cursed with the constant reminder that I
am not living up to my potential to be a
bake-sale coordinator, a Good Morning
America host, a Bridge counselor.
Cursed by this unforgiving fate. A fate
personified in the existence of easy-listen
ing Kathy Lee Gifford fans. A fate that con
jures up visions of Dallas Cowboy Cheer
leaders on a perky Super Bowl Sunday. A
fate befitting a sequinned game-show host
ess awarding rental-cars-to-be to beaming
Midwesterners.
A fate worse than death.
How, I ask you, was I ever supposed to
live up to this name? Right below Chastity
on the Impossibility-o-meter, this name
has destined me to fail. Destined me to
have a permanent grimace on my face
which prompts passers-by to comfort me,
"It can't be that bad." Destined me to rip
out their intestines in my imagination,
wiping the silly grins off their half-con
cerned faces as I eat their entrails before
their eyes.

Happiness in the Smurfy sense was
never to be mine. I will always be more of a
Spike and Mike cartoon than a redrawn
Hanna Barbera slut piece, a Tom to the
Jerrys of the world, a Daffy Duck in the
Mickey Mouse Club of life.
Why, because we loathe you.
But it doesn't necessarily mean that I'm
not happy. I derive just as much joy out of
life as the next person. Joy from watching
a really good bike crash in front of the
Clock Tower. Joy from watching women in
excesively tall platform shoes trip in steam
grates. Joy from listening to an especially
angry album when I am in that bordering
on-foul mood that comes right after you
get an excessive phone bill as the only mail
in your p.o. box for the week.
Nothing else matters.
I enjoy many of the underappreciated
steps in each day's walk down my path of
pessimism. E-mail messages from my
friends, buying Sour Patch Kids at the
Bookstore, sitting outside Memorial
Church when someone is playing the
organ. I enjoy pizza day in the cafeteria, a
new black undergarment purchase, shoes

that are two sizes too big and playing with
other people's long hair.
But I've never considered it a necessity
to offer a candy-coated facade to the uni
verse. A larger-than-life smile belying a
tinge of rage inside. A cheery tablecloth not
quite covering the chipped and warped
table below. A wondrous vine-covered gate
way desperately hiding the weathered
house behind it.
Tear down the wall.
This has always been a failing of mine.
I refuse to pretend to be happy, accepting
frustration, sadness, and randomness as
equally acceptable emotions for mass
consumption. I refuse to present a col
orized, edited version of myself for the
faint-of-heart general viewing audience.
I refuse to aspire to artificially colored
and flavored happiness, quite satisfied
with my straightforward presentation,
my no-frills packaging, my fleeting shelf
life.
A rose by any other name.
