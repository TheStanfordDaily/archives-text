## Women face Golden Bears Hedgpeth's turnaround important for Cardinal 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
They don't call it a home stretch for nothing.
For the Cardinal women's basketball team, which
is clinging to a share of second place in the Pacific 10
Conference, tonight's showdown with the California
Golden Bears kicks off a three-game Maples Pavilion
homestand.
Currently ridmg a four-game winning streak after
last weekend's sweep in Arizona, the Cardinal (15-5,
8-3 in the Pac-10) appears well-equipped to complete
a season sweep of the ninth-place Golden Bears (8-13,
2-9), whom Stanford defeated 92-75 on Jan. 21 in
Berkeley. And while the Cardinal looks to avert a
slow start like the one that saw it trailing 40-35 at
halftime of that contest, it hopes the star of that first
meeting shines again tonight.
Senior guard Christy Hedgpeth, who tied a career
high with 26 points in Harmon Gymnasium, has
used that game as a springboard to turn her final
Stanford season around. Averaging less than 10
points an outing and making only her fifth start at
the time, Hedgpeth bombed five of the Cardinal's
record-tying 12 three-pointers that night en route to
a 10-for-18 shooting performance.
Having earned the starting role for keeps, she has
since posted double figures in five of Stanford's last
six games and raised her scoring average to an
impressive 11.8 ppg, third on the team.
"My improvement has come mostly because I have
gotten more playing time," Hedgpeth said. "You
can't make an impact when you're not out there."
Head coach Tara VanDerveer's deployment of
Hedgpeth would seem to back this assessment up, as
four of Hedgpeth's five 30-minute appearances have
come since the first Cal matchup.
"At this point in the season, Christy has got to do
it for us," VanDerveer said.
Junior forward Rachel Hemmer, the Cardinal's
leading scorer (15.7 ppg) and rebounder (7.9 rpg),
agreed, adding that "[Christy] wants to play as long as
she can, until April and the Final Four. But talk is

cheap, and you have to step up and
carry the team."
Carrying the Golden Bears
tonight should be senior center
Ingrid Dixson, who suffered a right
knee injury in that first showdown
and returned in time to help Cal
snap a five-game losing streak last
week at Arizona State. Dixson
boasts a 14.8 ppg scoring averages,
and ranks third in the Pac-10 with
11.9 boards per contest.
