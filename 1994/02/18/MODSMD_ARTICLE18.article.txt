### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
The No. 14 Cardinal baseball team will have more
than surfing on their minds this weekend as they
open a three-game series at Rainbow Stadium in Hon
olulu tonight against the University of Hawaii.
Stanford enters the game with a 7-5 record after
dropping a 7-0 decision to Sacramento State on Tues
day, while the Rainbows are 8-4 after taking two of
three from Loyola Marymount last weekend.
Offensively, the Cardinal is led by the bat of senior
designated hitter Nate Olmstead. Olmstead had a tor
rid beginning of the season, compiling a .583 batting
average through the first ten games.
Despite cooling off during the past two games, he
still leads the team with a .438 batting average,
including three doubles, two homers, and eight RBIs.
Despite Olmstead's red-hot bat, the offense has
been inconsistent and Stanford coach Mark Marquess
believes there is still room for improvement.
"Offensively, we're still not doing a good enough
job," Marquess said. "We need to pick that up if we're
going to hope to do well in our league."
However, where the Cardinal offense has come up
short, the pitching staff has more than compensated.
Stanford's young pitching rotation has opened many

eyes early this season with a low 3.19 team ERA.
Sophomores Dan Reed and Todd Bartels and
freshman Jasor> have picked up all seven
Stanford victoria. The trio have compiled a 2.40 total
earned-run average, and have shaped up into the Car
dinal's Big Three. Freshrrr n Tom Reimers has
emerged as the closer with a perfect 3-for-3 in save
opportunities and an 0.68 ERA.
"I think we're pitching very well," Marquess said.
"I'm very pleased with our pitching staff."
The Big Three will have to contend with an explo
sive Rainbow offense that has a .310 team batting
average. Outfielder Franz Yuen leads the charge, bat
ting .400 with two doubles, three triples, and three
stolen bases.
"They've got a great team," said Stanford outfield
er Rich Crowe. "They score a lot of runs and have
good pitching."
On the mound, the Rainbows will turn to left
hander Roger Mills, who has a 2-0 record and a 2.45
ERA, and righthander Mark Johnson (2-1, 4.80 ERA)
to try to slow down the Stanford hitters.
Marquess believes the Cardinal will face a huge
challenge playing in Rainbow Stadium.
"They are very tough to beat at home," Marquess
said. "This is probably the best team they've had in
three or four years."
