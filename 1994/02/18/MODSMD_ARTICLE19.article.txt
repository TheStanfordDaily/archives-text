# Spikers take on No. 3 Cougars
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Highlighting a meteoric rise in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation, Brigham Young start
ed off this season at the No. 3 position with only
four years of Division I playing time under its
belt.
Since then the team has hit a couple of road
blocks, losing twice to top-ranked UCLA and
once to sixth-ranked Pepperdine in Southern
California.
However, despite sporting a 2-3 record, the
Cougars will invade the Farm with a vengeance,
while the Stanford volleyball squad (6-3, 5-0 in
the MPSF, ranked No. 7 national
ly) looks to diffuse this explosive
team in the Saturday night-capper.
"We're going to have a very
hard match against a very strong
team," said Cardinal head coach
Ruben Nieves. "We'll be playing
against a team which has no weak
nesses and a lot of experience."
Fielding a star-studded starting
rotation, BYU will call on the ser
vices of five returning starters in
addition to one of the brightest
freshman in the nation.
Ganging up on the opponents
up the middle will be blockers
Ethan Watts and Kevin Hambly.
Last season, Watts led the nation
with a .493 hitting percentage in
addition to tallying 1.66 blocks per
game — sixth on the national list.
"These two guys are good quick
hitters," Nieves said. "They'll get
the majority of the quick sets, in
addition to hitting out of the back
row."
In trying to defend against the
Cougars' powerful duo, the Cardi
nal will try to commit block —
blocking while the hitters go for
the kill — instead of reacting to the
hit, because of BYU's size and
quickness.
"Usually against strong, quick
hitters you commit, but we haven't
been that effective in commit
blocking this season," Nieves said.
Adding to the Cardinal
headache will be outside hitters
Pat Sinclair and Scott Larkin. Sin
clair, a member of last summer's
World University Team, served for
a .543 percentage last season (sixth
in the nation), in addition to com
piling 388 kills — good for second
on the BYU squad.
"I think BYU is the strongest
opponent we've played since the

finals of the [University of Califor
nia at Santa BarbaraJ Tournament
[against USC]," Nieves said.
"Everyone knows they're a good
team, and to beat a top-three team
will gives us great confidence and
tell us a lot about ourselves."
In order to accomplish that feat,
the Cardinal will rely on the consis
tency of their top offensive players.
Powering the Stanford attack
will be sophomore Mike Lambert,
who is coming off a game-high 25
kills against Pacific Tuesday.
Freshman Matt Fuerbringer
has already made a name for him
self on the collegiate circuit, tally
ing 201 kills on the season to lead
all Cardinal hitters. After sitting
out the Pacific match with a sore
ankle, Fuerbringer should rejoin
the starting lineup this weekend.
Setting Stanford's top two hit
ters will be last season's National
Player of the Year, senior Canyon
Ceman. Ceman is also returning
from an injury, however, his 60
sets against the Tigers earlier this
week is an indication that he is
back and ready to play.
After a slight shift in the start
ing rotation, senior Joe Burghardt
was bumped back to the middle
blocking position, leaving junior
Eric Wells to assume the swing hit
ting responsibilities, while senior
Brian Garrett and freshman Mike
Hoeffer battle it out for the final
outside hitting job.
A win this weekend is crucial to
Stanford's postseason goals. Cur
rently, the Cardinal is tied with
No. 2 USC for first place in the
Pacific Division of the MPSF. In
order to maintain that standing,
Stanford must win against the
Cougars. If not, the road to the
NCAA Final Four will be signifi
cantly harder from the runner-up
position.
"First place means a lot to us,"
Nieves said. "And I think we have
a good chance against BYU."
