# Bing just keeps on giving'
## Donor's plan will quadruple donations of graduating class 
### Scott Van Winkle Staff writer 
LTniversity trustee Peter Bing has
been called a philanthropist, a public ser
vant, even an "Uncommon Man." Now
he wants to play the role of a matchmak
er.
Bing, who graduated from Stanford in
1955, has offered $1.25 million to match
gifts to the University from graduating

seniors in an effort to establish a pattern
of giving by graduates.
The program is an effort to get stu
dents to feel that their gift can really
make a difference, said Traslyn Butler,
who directs student and young alumni
giving for the Office of Development,
which is administering the program.
Bing has pledged up to $250,000 for
each of the next five years to match do
nations made bv seniors before June 1 of

their year of graduation. Each senior gift
in excess of $10 is matched by the Par
ents Advisory Board, and Bing will equal
the matched gift, thereby quadrupling a
senior's gift. Bing will contribute up to
$100,000 in matching funds.
In addition, Bing will donate $50,000
if one-third of the graduating class gives
money and $100,000 more if half the
class donates.
The program, called the Bing
Senior Gift Challenge, was
launched last week at a workshop
with selected student leaders.
Bing was honored at the work
shop with the "Degree of Uncom
mon Man," an award given by the
Stanford Associates, a group of
University alumni and benefac
tors. Bing insisted that as part of

the award, a program be devel
oped to encourage philanthropy.
Now that Bing has initiated the
program, the Development Oft ice
will work to inform students about
the impact their gift will have.
Chang of the Development
Office said the office plans to con
tact every senior individually
about the program. If the pro
gram meets all of its goals, it will
raise a total of $1.75 million for
the University.
Increasing senior gifts is
important, program directors
say, because it encourages philan

thropy luter on. Chang cited
statistics showing that if alumni
do not donate within 10 years of
graduation, they are much less
likely to donate at all.
Currently, 15 percent to 18
percent of seniors give to the Uni
versity before graduating. "We
have not been very good about
educating students of their obli
gation to give to the University,"
Chang explained.
Senior Class President Dana
Weeks agrees. "The Class of '94
can go down in history as one of the
greatest fund-raisers," she said.
