# Women's tennis serves up two this weekend
## Washington, No. 3 Cal on the ticket 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
The trail that has steadily got
ten steeper for the Stanford
women's tennis team will take a
small dip followed by a terrific
incline this weekend.
Unranked Washington State,
who visits the Stanford Tennis
Stadium today at 1:30 p.m. rep
resents a small step downward in
competition for the No. 2-ranked
Cardinal. Saturday's 11 a.m.
match at California against the
No. 3-ranked Bears, on the other
hand, will be one of Stanford's
(8-0) toughest dual meets of the
season.
According to Cardinal head
coach Frank Brennan, the meet
against the Cougars (4-3) will be
"a nice little workout." His two
top singles players, Kristine
Kurth and Laxmi Poruri, will
both rest, allowing Wendy Sacks
and Emily Burt to slip into the
bottom two singles slots and
bumping freshman Katie
Schlukebir up to the No. 1 posi
tion.
At No. 1 doubles, Emma Lin
and Katherine Costain make up
the strongest slot in the Wash
ington State lineup. This duo is
ranked No. 18 nationally, having
upset the Cal pair of Vera Vitels
and Jennifer Poulos in the Rolex
Intercollegiate Championships
in November.
This team will square off
against Stanford's undefeated

duo of Poruri/Schlukebir unless
Poruri sits out the doubles
matches as well.
This season's first edition of
the Battle of the Bay pits two of
the strongest and deepest teams
in the nation against one another
at the Hellman Tennis Center,
where the Golden Bears (4-0)
have a 15-match unbeaten
streak. One of those victories
was a 6-3 win over Stanford last
season.
"We've been sort of snakebit
over there," Brennan said. "I've
been puzzling over this Cal thing
for quite a while now. We just
don't play well there."
Stanford will need a strong
outing from its top three singles
positions to come home from
Berkeley victorious, as the Bears
have more netters in the Inter
collegiate Tennis Association
top-15 than any other Pacific 10
Conference school. These three
— Pam Nelson (ranked No. 10),
Jennifer Poulos (No. 5) and Vera
Vitels (No. 12) —will fill Cal's
top three singles slots.
Nelson, a sophomore who
played at No. 1 for the Bears all
last year, had been sidelined
after having minor knee surgery
but has lately been filling the
third singles position. In all like
lihood she will move up to No. 1
on Saturday, thus setting up a
clash against Poruri, the top
ranked player in the nation.

Sandra DeSilva, a freshman, strokes a backhand against Washington. Undefeated for
the season, she will either play In the No. 4 or No. 6 singles slot this weekend.
