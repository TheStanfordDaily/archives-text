# Men's hoops sunk by poor shooting percentage
## Kidd and Cal crunch Cardinal 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY — Maligned by
first-half shooting woes and sec
ond-period foul problems, the
Stanford men's basketball team
proved no match for No. 18 Cali
fornia last night in dropping an
80-62 decision to the Golden
Bears at Harmon Arena.
The Cardinal (13-8 overall, 6-6
in the Pacific 10 Conference) shot
a season-low 32 percent from the
field in losing its third straight
game.
"We just weren't good
enough," Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery said. "We've got to
regroup and we've got to play bet
ter offensively."
Cal (17-5, 9-3), which gave up
45 points to Cardinal forwards
Andy Poppink and Brent Williams
in Stanford's 88-79 win last
month at Maples Pavilion, cut
down on Cardinal inside opportu
nities from the opening tap.
Poppink and Williams finished
with 17 points on five-for-22
shooting.
"We concentrated on stopping
Stanford in front of us when they
cut into the lane," Bear forward
Michael Stewart said. "I think it
paid off."
It certainly paid off for Stew
art. The Pac-10 leader in blocks
with a 1.8 per-game average,
Stewart tied a conference record
with seven swats last night.
Stewart, a 6-foot-10 forward,
was part of a starting Cal lineup in
which no one stood shorter than
6-foot-4.
"Their big lineup hurts us
more than their small lineup,"
Montgomery said. "We had
matchup problems all the way
around."
The Cardinal hung with the
Bears early in the game, staking a
12-11 lead when Poppink hit an
18-foot turnaround baseline
jumper.
"I felt like we were playing
pretty well in the beginning," Pop

pink said. "Had we knocked down
a few more of our shots right
there, we would have been right in
it."
But Stanford could not knock
anything down last night, hitting
only 10 of 34 field goals and 5 of
12 foul shots in the first half.
Down 36-26 at the intermis
sion, the Cardinal trimmed its
deficit to 43-36 when guard Dion
Cross hit a three-pointer three
minutes into the second half.
Cross led Stanford in scoring
for the third consecutive game,
this time with 14 points.
Foul troubles hampered Stan
ford hopes for a second-half come
back. Poppink picked up his
fourth foul less than two minutes
into the period. Center Jim Mor
gan got his fourth at the 13:28
mark, and guard Brevin Knight
recorded his fourth foul with 9:28
to play.
Cal forward and Pac-10 scoring
leader Murray was the recipient of
the brunt of these fouls, collecting

a game-high 26 points thanks to a
12-for-16 performance from the
line.
"When we got the ball into the
post, we took it at those guys and
got them into foul trouble," Golden
Bears coach Todd Bozeman said.
After their lead hovered
around 10 points for most of the
second half, Cal began to pull
away late in the game.
The Bears went ahead 65-50
with 7:44 to play when Murray hit
a pair of free throws, increasing
its margin to 19 on another two
Murray foul shots and a steal
lavup combination from Jason
Kidd.
Cal never led by less than 16
points after that, as Kidd finished
with 22 points (18 in the second
half) and nine assists.
"You're not going to win many
games home or away shooting the
ball the way we did," Montgomery
said. "We can't play how we did,
particularly on the road, against a
team like Cal."
