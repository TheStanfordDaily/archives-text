## Morgan, Cross only starters who showed signs of life at Berkeley 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
BERKELEY — It's hard to win when only two of your starters
play up to their potential.
Despite solid performances last night from center Jim Morgan
and ' hooting guard Dion Cross, the Stanford squad was hindered
by the fact that most of its players had off nights.
"We just didn't give ourselves any type of chance tonight," said
Cardinal coach Mike Montgomery. "Our confidence is shaken."
Had the Stanford team not received the significant offensive
contributions from Morgan and Cross, the game would have been
a blowout from the start.,
In the first half, Morgan gave the Cardinal a tremendous boost.
The 6-foot-ll center chipped in seven points, the most of any
Stanford player in the period.
"I got good passes," said Mor
gan. "I got into a groove where I
felt comfortable, and I felt I could
score on the inside guys."
Not only did Morgan connect
down low near the basket, but he
also used his inside power moves
to draw numerous fouls on the
Cal players. Morgan knocked in
three points from the charity
stripe and proceded to get Golden
Bear center Ryan Jamison in foul
trouble.
"Jim works hard," Mont
gomery said. "He's not a polished
offensive player, but his effort is
always there."
In the second half, it was Cross
who caught fire on offense and
who helped to minimize Califor
nia's lead. The 6-foot-2 sopho
more scored 11 of Stanford's first

17 points of the period after man
aging only three points in the
game's first twenty minutes.
"I wasn't trying to force any
thing. I wasn't rushing," said
Cross about his second-half
shooting performance. "I was just
trying to be more aggressive."
A seven-foot jumper by Cross
followed by a Morgan slam dunk
cut the Cardinal's deficit to 10
points with 12:30 remaining in
the contest, but Stanford's
offense fell apart from there.
"We weren't scoring the ball,"
Cross said. "If we scored the ball
we would win."
While the offensive play of
Morgan and Cross gave the Cardi
nal something positive think
about after a disappointing loss to
its archrival, it needed some other
players to contribute if it had
hoped to give Cal with a legiti
mate threat at its home court.
"I don't think I'm really satisfied
with our play right now," Mont
gomery said. "It's a team game."
