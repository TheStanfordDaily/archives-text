## Swimmers look to drown Bears

For the Stanford men's swim team, the hardest
training of the season is behind them and the fun
part is just about to begin.
Before hitting the road for the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships and NCAA finals in
March, however, the Cardinal must first entertain
California at deGuerre Pool Saturday at 1 p.m.
Top-ranked Stanford (9-0) will be looking to cap
its second-consecutive undefeated dual-meet sea
son.
"The championship season starts this week
end," said junior Ray Carey. "We're at the start of
our taper. Everyone is at a different point because
it takes a while for your body to catch up to the
rest."
In preparation for the upcoming Pac-10 and
NCAA Championships, the Cardinal training has
consisted of decreased yardage and increased
attention to various specific elements of racing.
"We've definitely been cutting back a lot," said
senior sprinter Bill Schell. "We're going hard
every other day and getting lots of rest to get into
race shape. The focus right now is on Pac-lOs."
In order to further the focus on the Pac-10
meet, which is in two weeks, coaches Skip Kenney
of Stanford and Nort Thornton of Cal agreed to
expand the traditional dual meet's schedule of
events. The full schedule featured at Pac-lOs and
NCAAs will be swum this weekend, as the 100-
yard butterfly, back- and breaststroke, the 400-
yard individual medley and 1650-yard freestyle
will be added.
Although the Cardinal has not yet been threat
ened by any conference rivals, the team is not
looking past the Golden Bears. "Cal is good this
year," Schell said. "They took USC right down to
the end in a dual meet. We expect to beat them but
it will be a good meet."
One of the more interesting races of the day
should be the 200-yzrd butterfly, which will fea
ture Carey, the defending NCAA champion. In
last year's meeting, Cal's Martin Herrman beat
Carey, handing him the only dual-meet defeat of
his Stanford career in his specialty event.
"This race will be very important," Carey said.
"Besides concentrating on my time, I try to get to
the wall first. Regardless of what my time is, I
want to practice winning."
He has done just that this year, winning sever
al close races, coming from behind in many of
them. In those races, Carey was tired from the
mid-season workouts. Now he looks forward to
swimming rested.
"I've tapered better with Skip than with my
previous coaches," he said. "He lets you combine
what you did in high school that was effective and
also new things that you have learned. This is the
turning point for a perfect season."
Schell said the team is excited in anticipation of
the upcoming meets. "The guys are psyched. This
is the fun part of the season. They know they're
going to swim real fast."
Let the fun and games begin.
