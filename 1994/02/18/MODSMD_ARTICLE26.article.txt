# Men's tennis opens Pac-10 season vs. Cal
## 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
With two matches remaining
before NCAA National Team
Indoors, the Stanford men's ten
nis team will look to continue its
winning ways against University
of California at Irvine and Califor
nia this weekend at the Stanford
Tennis Stadium.
"We're really looking forward
to the competition," said head
coach Dick Gould. "And this will
help us get ready for Indoors."
Today at 1:30 p.m. the Cardi
nal will face the Aggies of Irvine,
who Stanford defeated last year
by a score of 7-0. However, the
Aggies return an experienced line
up and have made some competi
tive additions in singles.
On Saturday at 11 a.m. Stan
ford will open up its Pacific 10
Conference dual-meet season as it
squares off against Cal. While the
Cardinal won both meetings
between the two last year, this
neighbor from across the Bay
returns with an experienced line
up. The Bears' top singles player,
Casie Louie, was a finalist in the
Rolex Northern California region
al tournament.
For Stanford, the lineup has
been a rather tenuous entity,
plagued by both injury and uncer
tainty. Senior Michael Flanagan
will most likely return this week
atop the singles lineup despite last
week's sprained wrist.

The Nos. 2 and 3 singles spots
should be occupied in some order
by senior Robert Devens and
sophomore JefTSalzenstein. While
Devens has been the No. 2 player
for most of the season, a trouble
some back and excellent play by
Salzenstein may force a change.
Nos. 4, 5 and 6 singles will like
ly be played by some combination
of seniors Vimal Patel and Chris
Cocotos and sophomore Jim
Thomas, the last of whom seems
to be recovered from an early-sea
son shoulder injury.
Doubles will likely remain con
stant with Flanagan/Cocotos at
No. 1 doubles and Patel/Salzen
stein at No. 2. Patel/Salzenstein
are coming off an electrifying win
against a top-caliber Pepperdine
duo last weekend.
Freshman phenomenon Grant
Elliott will likely pair up with
Devens at No. 3 to round out the
doubles field.
While this weekend's play will
help the Cardinal's line-up with
final preparation for Indoors,
both matches should offer Stan
ford strong competition in their
own right.
"Both teams are always ready
to play us," Gould said. "In order
to beat them, we'll have to play at
our very best."
In the event of rain, today's
match may be delayed up to two
hours. If Saturday's match is
rained out, it may be replayed
Sunday or Monday.
