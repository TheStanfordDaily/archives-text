# Director selected for multicultural office
## Dickson will monitor minority hiring 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
Sally Dickson, associate dean for student
affairs at the Stanford Law School, was
named the new director of the Office of Mul
ticultural Development yesterday, ending
an eight-month search.
Calling this a "challenging time but a
bright time" to take over the office, Dickson
said that the office's "progress thus far
should not go unrecognized. Our task now
is to take it further."
In her new position, which she will as
sume March 21, Dickson will be responsible
for monitoring the University's hiring and
promotion of African-American, Asian-
American, Chicano/Latino, Native-Ameri
can, female and disabled employees.
"Sally Dickson had earned the respect,
both personal and professional, of her col-

leagues," said University
President Gerhard Casper
in a statement. "She has
been praised for her re
markable sense of respon
sibility, her enthusiasm
and her drive in her work
at the Law School."
Dickson's appointment
ends a drama that began
last May with the depar-

ture of former director Sharon Parker,
whose resignation remains highly contro
versial. Acting director Judith Little has
been heading the office since Parker's de
parture and was one of the four finalists for
the permanent position.
While statements released last May by
Parker, Casper and the University itself all


Dickson
claimed Parker resigned for per
sonal reasons, several sources
have indicated to The Daily that
the administration asked Parker
to resign.
Following Parker's resignation,
an advisory committee led by
Assoc. Dean of Humanities and
Sciences A 1 Camarillo was formed
to evaluate the office's direction.
The group recommended that
the office re-focus itself on staff
affirmative action, leaving com
munity multicultural education to
other areas of the University.
Calling this a "very exciting
time to take over," Dickson said
she looks forward to further imple
menting the report's recommen
dations.
"One of the attractive features
of the position was the Camarillo
report," Dickson said. "I think it
brought a real clarity to the office,
and re-established its broad agen
da."
Little agreed that "the Camaril

lo report issued a clear mandate
... to put the focus back on staff
affirmative action."
While she said she would have
preferred to remain in the position
permanently, Little called Dickson
"a good choice." Other candidates
for the position included Clare
Phillips, the office's associate
director, and SueVon Gee, an affir
mative action administrator at
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter.
Dickson came to Stanford in
1988, after three years as assistant
dean of student affairs at Golden
Gate University Law School in
San Francisco.
Along with overseeing general
student services at the Law
School, Dickson has been responsi
ble for the recruitment, admission
and retention of minority students
at the Law School for the last six
years — during which time the
number of minority applicants has
risen from about 500 to 1,000 each
year.
Along with her duties at the
I jaw School, Dickson has been Uja
maa's resident fellow since 1989.
She is also a lecturer at the Law

School and has taught classes on
such topics as criminality and sub
ordinated communities.
"I think, in many different
ways, my professional and person
al interests have always been with
affirmative action in its broadest
context," Dickson said.
Responding to recent criticism
that Stanford has not realized its
hiring goals relating to minority
staff members, Dickson said her
first task as director would be to
gather and analyze facts.
"I would like to find out exactly
where we are," Dickson said. "I'm
not making any firm assumptions
— we need to establish where
we've been and where we need to
go."
"It's important for her to put
her own character on the office,"
Little said. "It's also essential to
establish relationships with Uni
versity cabinet members, and fac
ulty and staff leaders — she needs
to gain their trust and to develop a
good working relationship with
them."
OMD search director Political
Science Prof. Luis Fraga could not
be reached for comment yesterday.
