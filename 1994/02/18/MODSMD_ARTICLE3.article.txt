# Director selected for multicultural office
## Dickson will monitor minority hiring 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
Sally Dickson, associate dean for student
affairs at the Stanford Law School, was
named the new director of the Office of Mul
ticultural Development yesterday, ending
an eight-month search.
Calling this a "challenging time but a
bright time" to take over the office, Dickson
said that the office's "progress thus far
should not go unrecognized. Our task now
is to take it further."
In her new position, which she will as
sume March 21, Dickson will be responsible
for monitoring the University's hiring and
promotion of African-American, Asian-
American, Chicano/Latino, Native-Ameri
can, female and disabled employees.
"Sally Dickson had earned the respect,
both personal and professional, of her col-

leagues," said University
President Gerhard Casper
in a statement. "She has
been praised for her re
markable sense of respon
sibility, her enthusiasm
and her drive in her work
at the Law School."
Dickson's appointment
ends a drama that began
last May with the depar-

ture of former director Sharon Parker,
whose resignation remains highly contro
versial. Acting director Judith Little has
been heading the office since Parker's de
parture and was one of the four finalists for
the permanent position.

Parker, Casper and the University itself all
