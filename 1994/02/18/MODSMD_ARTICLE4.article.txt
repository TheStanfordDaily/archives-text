# Interdisciplinary rules established by Fac Sen
## 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
The faculty senate yesterday approved a
set of guidelines on how interdisciplinary
programs should be created, evaluated and
dissolved.
The document outlines the general
points someone seeking approval for an in
terdisciplinary program must address, in
cluding the "academic rigor" of the pro
gram, its likely financial costs, how it will be
structured and how the program will relate
to existing academic departments.
Programs that are created will be re
viewed in five years. After that point, both
undergraduate and graduate programs will
be reviewed every eight years. Currently,
graduate programs are reviewed every five
years and undergraduate reviews come
every eight years.
The change was made to standardize the
review process and ease the administrative
burden of reviews, said Political Science
Prof Judith Goldstein, chair of the senate
Committee on Graduate Studies.

Much of the discussion surrounding the
proposal centered on terminating interdis
ciplinary programs. Under the guidelines,
any proposal that is not renewed is de facto
terminated. Goldstein said one of the pur
poses of the guidelines was to clarify who
can terminate the programs and how.
Some faculty members wanted to facili
tate the process of terminating programs.
English Prof. John Bender suggested that,
since he could not remember an interdisci
plinary program being terminated, the
guidelines should include criteria programs
have to meet lest they be terminated.
But Goldstein said there are more specif
ic rules in other documents about what in
terdisciplinary programs must do to pre
serve themselves. She added that part of
the reason for the new guidelines was
deanal concerns about whether programs
can be killed.
"The impetus for this document was
that the deans didn't feel it was possible to
terminate a program," Goldstein said.
"Everything will actually lead
now to people seriously thinking
about terminating interdisci
plinary programs."
Current interdisciplinary
programs include Symbolic Sys
tems; Science, Technology and
Society; Urban Studies and

Human Biology

In other news, the senate
heard a report from the Com
mittee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement. The report
said that about three-quarters
of faculty surveyed favored
recording failing grades and
having a transcript that more
closely reflects a student's
entire academic performance,
not just their successes.
None of the other questions

from the faculty survey on grad
ing had such large support, Gold
stein said. Support was low for
the way Stanford currently han
dles such issues as retaking class
es and the drop and add deadline,
she added. Indeed, Mahood said,
the committee is now "looking at
a much earlier add date."
The senate also heard a memo
rial resolution for former Chem
istry Prof. J. Murray Luck, who
died Aug. 26, 1993.
