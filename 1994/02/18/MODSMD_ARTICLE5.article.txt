# Surviving the 'gulag'
## Harry Wu recounts 20 years of nightmare in labor reform camps 
### Vivien Wang Staff writer 
In 1957, Harry Hongda Wu
could have been any one of us — a
20-year-old student who had a
girlfriend, played bridge and was
captain of his baseball team.
Wu — who is now a research
fellow at the East Asian Collec
tion of the Hoover Institution —
had no interest in politics as a
young man. Life was easy, until
the day he spoke his mind about
human rights violations.
In an effort to propagate Chi
nese leader Mao Zedong's cam
paign to let "one hundred flowers
bloom," the secretary of the local
communist party branch urged
him to voice his concerns, and not
worry about criticism.
"In one meeting I spoke out in
my class about some of the com
munist violations of human
rights. I also criticized the Soviet

tanks crushing the Budapest up
rising in October of 1956," Wu
said.
But despite the assurance he
had received from the party offi
cial, Wu's speech was condemned.
"Your speech is a poisonous weed,
not a flower," he said the Com
munist Party told him. "We wel
come flowers. . . but we don't like
poisonous weeds."
In 1960, Wu was labeled a
"counterrevolutionary rightist"
and dealt a sentence of life impris
onment. Although he didn't serve
life, he did spend almost two
decades in more than twelve of
China's laogai — or labor reform
camps — where one was forced to
confess even after trial and sen
tencing.
For example, Wu recalled an
interrogation by a police officer
during his first day in the camp.

Author Harry Wu answers questions about his new book "Bitter Winds: A Memoir of My
Years in China's Gulag" Wednesday at The Bookstore.
"There was a hard, bright light
focused on my face. I didn't see
the face of the policeman. 'Squat
down,' he said. 'Tell me your
name, you age, your family, voca
tion. And now, tell me your
crime. You have to confess. One
by one, list all your crimes, to
match the files,' " Wu said.
In a recent New York Times
opinion piece, Wu wrote that he
"was repeatedly tortured and
nearly died from starvation and
exposure to freezing tempera
tures. I ate anything I could find
to stay alive, learning to catch
and devour frogs, snakes and
rats."
Daily life was a struggle which
he survived by refuting his
humanness and turning himself
into a beast.
"If you are a human being,
you have feelings, emotions,
ideas. You're always thinking
about the future, your family,
your lover, sex, wrong and right,
freedom. But if you turn yourself
into a beast, an animal. . . you
don't have emotion, you don't
have any thought. You're only
thinking about trying to grab
food from anywhere, every

where," he said.
Exhausting work days lasting
from sunrise to sundown were
the staple of the laogai, where
only two bowls of gruel were
served a day. "We never washed
our bowls," said Wu, "we used
out tongues to clean them. Any
thing to save."
Wu was finally released in
1979, when the idea of commu
nism lost much respect among
China's people. Current figure
head Deng Xiaoping decided to
"give the people a break, and
release old prisoners," said Wu.
But at the same time, they con
tinued "to arrest new counterrev
olutionaries."
Wu came to the United States
in 1985. "I realized I would have
very good life conditions, not
much money, but if I worked
hard, I'd survive, I'd have free
dom. The problem is, the night
mares never left me," he said.
Wu's nightmares are chroni
cled in his recently published
second book, "Bitter Winds: A
Memoir of My Years in China's
Gulag." The title of the book is
significant to Wu. "I always
remember the bitter cold winds
through the paper-covered win
dows of the prison cell. And they
still chill me." Today, Wu said
he finds that "keeping myself
busy is keeping me away from

the nightmare."
Wu will testify today before
Congress against renewal of the
China's most favored nation sta
tus. He will also speak before the
European Parliament and the
United Nations Human Rights
Commission later this month.
As president and one of the
founders of the Laogai Research
Foundation, Wu's mission in life
is to expose the laogai system,
and the endless suffering of those
incarcerated in it.
"There are still so many people
in the camp today, experiencing
my past. Why hasn't the system
been exposed? What is abuse in
China? A handful of well-known
dissidents asking for release. If
you can save a few of them, fine.
But how about we destroy the
system, denounce the system to
save a lot of lives?" he said.
As recipient of the Martin
Ennals Award for Human
Rights, he intends to establish a
fellowship for study on the rela
tionship between the Soviet
gulag and the Chinese laogai and
to further support the Laogai
Research Foundation. Wu was
also presented with the Freedom
Award by the Hungarian Free
dom Fighter's Federation in
1991, and has been featured on
the television news program "60
Minutes."
