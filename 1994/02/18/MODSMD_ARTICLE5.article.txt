# Surviving the 'gulag'
## Harry Wu recounts 20 years of nightmare in labor reform camps 
### Vivien Wang Staff writer 
In 1957, Harry Hongda Wu
could have been any one of us — a
20-year-old student who had a
girlfriend, played bridge and was
captain of his baseball team.
Wu — who is now a research
fellow at the East Asian Collec
tion of the Hoover Institution —
had no interest in politics as a
young man. Life was easy, until
the day he spoke his mind about
human rights violations.
In an effort to propagate Chi
nese leader Mao Zedong's cam
paign to let "one hundred flowers
bloom," the secretary of the local
communist party branch urged
him to voice his concerns, and not
worry about criticism.
"In one meeting I spoke out in
my class about some of the com
munist violations of human
rights. I also criticized the Soviet

tanks crushing the Budapest up
rising in October of 1956," Wu
said.
But despite the assurance he
had received from the party offi
cial, Wu's speech was condemned.
"Your speech is a poisonous weed,
not a flower," he said the Com
munist Party told him. "We wel
come flowers. . . but we don't like
poisonous weeds."
In 1960, Wu was labeled a
"counterrevolutionary rightist"
and dealt a sentence of life impris
onment. Although he didn't serve
life, he did spend almost two
decades in more than twelve of
China's laogai — or labor reform
camps — where one was forced to
confess even after trial and sen
tencing.
For example, Wu recalled an
interrogation by a police officer
during his first day in the camp.
