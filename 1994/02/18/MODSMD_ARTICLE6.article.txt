# Congressman eases fears of U.S.-Japan trade war

Despite the breakdown of last
week's trade negotiations between the
United States and Japan, the escalat
ing confrontation between the two
countries will not explode into a trade
war, Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., told
students yesterday.
In an informal talk to about 30 stu
dents in Political Science 134B: Ameri
ca and the World Economy, Matsui, a
member of the House Ways and Means
Committee, stated that their relation

ship is too important and economies too
interdependent for .the impasse to
cause complete collapse.
"The relationship is too critical," he
said. "The intertwined economies
make breakdown not likely." Matsui
added that he believes the conflict —
which has led to American trade sanc
tions against Japanese-manufactured
cellular phones — will eventually
"work itself out."
Matsui also detailed other recent de
velopments in U.S. foreign policy,
specifically those dealing with China

and North Korea, and linked them to
the ongoing trade conflict between the
United States and Japan.
In a time of high uncertainty follow
ing the end of the Cold War, Matsui
maintained that the Clinton adminis
tration is not wholly responsible for its
shaky, if not sporadic, formation of for
eign policy. "The national interest is
much harder to define," he said.
However, as trade interests become
increasingly important in foreign poli
cy considerations, Matsui said the Clin
ton administration must clearly define

and follow through with its foreign-pol
icy goals.
He pointed to the relationship be
tween the U.S.-Japan trade talks and
the ongoing dealings with China over
violations of human rights as an exam
ple of why the U.S. "must be strong."
An assertive American position toward
Japan in the trade talks, Matsui said, is
imperative regarding the future devel
opments of U.S. policy dealing with the
linkage of China's most favored nation
