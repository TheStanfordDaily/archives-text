# Constitutional crisis?
## Kunstler signals alarm on rights 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
The Bill of Rights is dead â€” at least according to at
torney William Kunstler.
An audience of about 200 people eagerly laughed
along with Kunstler as he shared his witticisms and in
sights on the state of society in America last night in
Kresge Auditorium.
Kunstler, a 75-year-old lawyer from New York, has
served as defense counsel to the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr., the Black Panthers, the Chicago Seven and
others. He has also argued cases in front of the
Supreme Court, including the 1989 Texas v. Johnson
flag-burning case.
Currently, Kunstler is defending the men accused
of the World Trade Center bombing and will appear in
court today. He has also appeared in films, playing the
judge in "X" and Jim Morrison's attorney in "The
Doors."
Taking the audience on a trip through history,
Kunstler portrayed the framing of the American Con
stitution as a creation written for the slave- and land
owning American elite.
"They painted the windows black so no one would
know what they were doing," Kunstler said of the Con
stitutional Convention held in Philadelphia in 1787.
The Bill of Rights was only created at the protest of
a few of the larger states, Kunstler said. However, the
Senate chose to not make the amendments apply to
the states.
The Bill of Rights became applicable to the states
with the passage of the 14th Amendment after the
Civil War, Kunstler said. "Six hundred thousand
corpses are the price we had to pay to make these
rights binding on states," he said.
After outlining the Bill of Rights, Kunstler moved
to the last 20 years and described what he perceives as
the recent erosion of these rights.
"What happened to all these rights?" Kunstler
asked. "They are being destroyed as fast as we can de
strov them."
The First Amendment has been
eroded by restrictions on abortion
counseling, rights of privacy and
nude dancing, Kunstler said.
Recent Supreme Court rulings
allow police to hold suspects for 48
hours without arrest warrants,
and warrantless searches are now
permitted in homes if the police
enter on "good faith," according to
Kunstler.
Kunstler cast doubt on the will
ingness of the Supreme Court to
protect civil rights. He cited the
landmark case of Brown v. Board
of Education, stating that while
this was a significant step forward,
the judges only wrote that desegre
gation was to proceed "with all
deliberate speed."
"When working on civil rights,
the tide was with us," Kunstler
said. "But how fast they slip back
into the old ways."
Broadening his criticism, Kun
stler declared, "the Supreme Court
is nothing more than an arm of
those who rule the country."
"This is the establishment's
law, the establishment's Bill of
Rights, and the establishment's
Constitution," he said.
Kunstler also questioned the
value of capital punishment.
"Remember, the person you're
executing was not deterred," Kun
stler said. "When you execute peo
ple like this, you have gone into the
bestiality stage."
All in all, Kunstler painted a
fairly bleak picture of American
society today, comparing today's

dwindling society to the fall of the
Roman empire.
"There's a great similarity to
what's happening in Rome to
what's happening in the United

States," Kunstler
said. "It's no coin
cidence that the
Super Bowl has
Roman numer
als."
Speaking fur
ther on the deteri
oration of Ameri
can society, Kun
stler addressed

the "Skategate" affair between
Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrig
an.
"This convulses us, this essen
tial bullshit, so we forget what's
going on in this country," Kunstler
said to an appreciative audience.
Kunstler also took the opportu
nity to tell the latest lawyer joke
that he had heard. "Do you know
the difference between a lawyer
and a spermatozoa?" Kunstler
asked. "A lawyer has one chance in
six million of becoming a human
being. That's what I think of the
legal profession."
In the question and answer ses
sion, junior Scott Moss asked Kun
stler for what advice he would give
an undergraduate thinking of a
career in law.
"I'm only going to say do it if
you're going to do what I do," Kun
stler said. "In every country
there's got to be people who fight
government."
"Lawyers are in a great position
to do this, instead of ripping off
widows and orphans," Kunstler
said. "All the rest are part of the
enemy."
