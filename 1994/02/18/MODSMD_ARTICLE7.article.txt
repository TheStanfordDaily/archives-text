# Constitutional crisis?
## Kunstler signals alarm on rights 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
The Bill of Rights is dead â€” at least according to at
torney William Kunstler.
An audience of about 200 people eagerly laughed
along with Kunstler as he shared his witticisms and in
sights on the state of society in America last night in
Kresge Auditorium.
Kunstler, a 75-year-old lawyer from New York, has
served as defense counsel to the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr., the Black Panthers, the Chicago Seven and
others. He has also argued cases in front of the
Supreme Court, including the 1989 Texas v. Johnson
flag-burning case.
Currently, Kunstler is defending the men accused
of the World Trade Center bombing and will appear in
court today. He has also appeared in films, playing the
judge in "X" and Jim Morrison's attorney in "The
Doors."
Taking the audience on a trip through history,
Kunstler portrayed the framing of the American Con
stitution as a creation written for the slave- and land
owning American elite.
"They painted the windows black so no one would
know what they were doing," Kunstler said of the Con
stitutional Convention held in Philadelphia in 1787.
The Bill of Rights was only created at the protest of
a few of the larger states, Kunstler said. However, the
Senate chose to not make the amendments apply to
the states.
The Bill of Rights became applicable to the states
with the passage of the 14th Amendment after the
Civil War, Kunstler said. "Six hundred thousand
corpses are the price we had to pay to make these
rights binding on states," he said.
After outlining the Bill of Rights, Kunstler moved
to the last 20 years and described what he perceives as
the recent erosion of these rights.
"What happened to all these rights?" Kunstler
asked. "They are being destroyed as fast as we can de
strov them."
