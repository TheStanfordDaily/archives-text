Moe knows medals
RINGEBU, Norway (AP) — With
crumbs of birthday cake on his face and
a second medal to his name, Tommy
Moe flashed a wide grin and spooned
another piece into his mouth.
"I think I'm havinga dream Olympics,"
he said.
Moe turned 24 yesterday, the same
day he became the first American man
ever to win two Alpine skiing medals at
a single Winter Games — a gold in the
downhill and now a silver in the super
giant slalom.
Norwegian Atle Skaardal, whose
28th birthday happened to coincide
with Moe's, shared a toast and cake
with gold medalist Markus Wasmeier of
Germany, Norse teammate Kjetil Andre
Aamodt, the bronze medalist, and Moe.

Moe was only eight hundredths of a sec
ond from his second gold.
