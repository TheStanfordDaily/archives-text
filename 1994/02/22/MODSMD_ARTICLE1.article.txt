As part of an effort to plan for
the future, University represen
tatives have met with members of
Palo Alto's City Council over the
past several weeks to discuss the
possibility of expanding the Med
ical Center and the Children's
Hospital.
"The hospital, as well as Stan
ford as a whole, has been asked by
Palo Alto what they're going to
look like in the future," said Andy
Coe, the University's director of
community relations. "The hospi
tal, given the national debate on
health care, is looking at what
they are going to need."
He added that representatives
from the Medical Center and the
children's hospital are meeting
with Palo Alto's Comprehensive
Plan Advisory Committee, a
group appointed by the City
Council to develop a long-range
plan for the city.
Don Gibbons, director of com
munications for the Medical Cen
ter, said the discussions with the
City Council and Palo Alto's plan
ning commission were an effort to
ease fears about hospital expan
sion. "The city views the hospital
with a little more trepidation" be
cause of the amount of traffic the
institution brings into the area,
he said.
"There has never been — in
anyone's wildest dreams — plans
to double the size of the hospital,"
Gibbons said, calling such reports
in local newspapers "grossly inac
curate."
However, Gibbons said there is
a plan for another research facili
ty for the Medical Center that has
"gone further in the planning
stage." Gibbons said the facility, if
constructed, would not be very
large.
According to Palo Alto City
Council member Gary Fazzino,
the hospitals' representatives
wanted to "make the case for the
eventual expansions of the hospi
tals."
Fazzino said "major expan
sion" appeared to be in the future
because of changes in the future
