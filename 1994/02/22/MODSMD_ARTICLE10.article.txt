### Justin Dawe Staff writer 
Hoping to give people "the news they need to
become active," two master's students from the Com
munication Department plan to begin broadcasting a
local news program on community-access cable dur
ing spring quarter.
"Issues for municipal governments and communi
ties like Palo Alto are being left out of regular televi
sion news," said Jon Mattingly, a master's student in
the Media Studies program.
With partner Shelly Simonds, a journalism gradu
ate student, Mattingly said he hopes to fill that void
for the 22,000 subscribers to Stanford's local cable
cooperative.
"People have conditioned attitudes given to them
by the mass media," Mattingly said. He hopes to make
the news broadcast a "channel through which com
munity outreach can occur."

The program, which is tentatively slated to run
weekly, will address a particular theme on each broad
cast. The features will not be on breaking news, but
will "highlight issues related to the communities" of
Palo Alto, East Palo Alto, Menlo Park and Stanford,
Mattingly said.
Unlike large-budget productions, the community
access broadcast "is an entirely self-supported
endeavor," he said. Equipment — including cam
eras, a recording studio and editing facilities — is
being provided by Impact, a branch of the Mid-
Peninsula Access Company. In addition, the pro
gram will be run by volunteers from Stanford and
the community.
Mattingly said this freedom from budget consider
ations will allow participants "to talk in a very
straightforward manner."
Mattingly is currently working to assemble report
ing and production teams. An informational meeting
will be held this Friday in Mendenhall Library.
