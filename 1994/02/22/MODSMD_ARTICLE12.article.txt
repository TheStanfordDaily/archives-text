# NATO airstrike deadline passes
## Leaders call for peace as U.N. takes control of Serb guns

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)
— With the threat of NATO air strikes
averted, peacekeepers moved in yesterday
to control the remaining Serb guns
around Sarajevo while diplomats turned
up the heat for a political settlement.
Immediate air strikes against remain
ing Serb artillery positions were unneces
sary, NATO and United Nations officials
said.
Although some Serb guns remained in
place after yesterday's 1 a.m. deadline,
the Serbs were credited with trying to
comply with an ultimatum that could
have put NATO into combat for the first
time ever.
Any more shelling in Sarajevo would
meet with "immediate military response,"
warned Gen. Jean Cot, commander of

U.N. forces in the former Yugoslavia.
Yesterday's catchword — from Rus
sians, Americans and Europeans — was
momentum: Use this halt in the siege of
Sarajevo as a model for a wider settle
ment in Bosnia, where 200,000 people are
dead or missing in 22 months of war.
"The challenge," said President Clin
ton at a White House news conference,
. is to build on this week's progress
and create a lasting and workable peace
for all the people of Bosnia."
The search for peace is to continue
today in Bonn at a meeting of senior Rus
sian, American and European diplomats.
Clinton said U.S. troops could eventu
ally be part of a peacekeeping force to
implement a future peace accord.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadz

ic said his side would only use its with
drawn weapons for self-defense. He said a
few weapons were "stuck" in their posi
tions "but will also be controlled."
French U.N. troops arrived by heli
copter to control several cannons and a
howitzer northeast of Sarajevo, forcing
the Serbs to turn around the howitzer
aimed at the center of Sarajevo.
After nightfall yesterday, U.N. Maj.
Rob Annink said all sites had been visited
and either brought under U.N. control or
had the weapons withdrawn.
U.S. special envoy Charles Redman
was in Zagreb, Croatia, yesterday work
ing on the Croatian aspect of the three
sided war. Bosnia's Croats and Muslims
were once loosely allied against the Serbs,
but that affiliation disintegrated.
