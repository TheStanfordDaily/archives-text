Outside management of
Union will help to focus
on services for students

IN ANY OTHER small "town," a
centrally located shopping cen
ter with several restaurants, a
convenience store, a barbershop, a
dry cleaning service, a copy center,
a bank, a T-shirt shop, a travel
agency, a video arcade and a ticket
outlet would probably be doing its
fair share of business.
If that shopping center was the
only marketplace in town, it would
be raking money in hand over fist.
Ironically, Stanford — which has
produced business whizzes from
Charles Schwab to Hewlett and
Packard — has been unable to
make its own shopping center,
Tresidder Memorial Union, turn a
profit.
So it's a welcome — if long over
due — sight to see that the Univer
sity is considering bringing in an
outside management firm to run
Tresidder. Hopefully, bringing in
management experts will result in
improved and expanded services
and better prices throughout the
union.
Given its design, Tresidder will
never be the consummate "student
union" which is at the heart of so
many other universities — a place
where many, if not most, student
organizations have offices; a place
with services for students at stu
dent prices; a place to "hang out."
Its name — Tresidder Memorial
Union — seems to snidely rebuff
anyone with designs to turn it into
a place expressly for students.
But even if it's not to be a stu
dent union, the least Tresidder
could do for students is make a
profit for the University — and per
haps, in the process, generate some
revenue for student services. Last
year, the dysfunctional eyesore lost
the campus more than $1 million.
If and when a management team
is selected, it should look at the

entire structure of the building and
the location of services.
Any fool who's ever built a strip
mall could discern that Tresidder
lacks a coherent presentation of
services.
And while it offers some great
amenities — such as an abundance
of meeting space and a computer
cluster — administrative offices
occupy prime locations on the sec
ond floor. Meanwhile, the base
ment, which used to house a bowl
ing alley, sits vacant.
Perhaps some remodeling along
the lines of the envisioned "Grand
Marketplace" — an architect
ural/retail plan devised for Tresid
der in the '80s but never imple
mented — would result in a cen
tralization of services on the first
and second floors. The computer
cluster, offices and even meeting
rooms — which don't really merit
windows — could be moved to the
basement.
Remodeling to create more than
one centralized kitchen would
allow multiple food service opera
tors to compete in the building,
hopefully expanding the variety of
dining options available and reduc
ing their prices.
And how about some landscap
ing, for a little ambiance?
Of course, any major restructur
ing of Tresidder will come with a
price to the University — renova
tions aren't cheap.
But wouldn't investing a million
dollars or two in the short run be
worth many profitable years in the
future? After all, Tresidder is los
ing about that much money every
year as it is.
A hallmark of intelligence is
knowing when to ask for help.
Tresidder is in deep need of man
agerial know-how, and it's good to
see the University finally reaching
out for it.
An outside management firm
could really help turn Tresidder
around and make it more useful for
the community.
Let's just hope they get it soon,
because in these budget-cutting
days, time really is money.
