## Stanford's postal disservice 
### 
SERVICE IN five minutes or less!"
Have you ever noticed these signs?
If so, could you believe your eyes?
If not, what are your bets on their
location? The photo counter at the Book
store? A good bet, but survey says . . .
nope. The Law Library? Another one of
the top five answers on the board, but no
dice on numero uno. The CoHo at noon?
Hardly.
The signs are plastered on the walls
and windows and counters of the infa
mous Stanford Post Office, that hellish
twilight zone where three bitter men in
blue suits have collectively ruined stu
dents' days more often than the rains of
winter (at least this year).
But if you think any printed notice can
provide you any kind of leverage against
the infuriating loss of your time, care
packages, and temper, think again.
Many Stanford students spend the
better part of the hour between classes —
the hour during which they plan to swing
by Lecture Notes, mail off a hefty job
application, and eat lunch — standing
face to face with the signs. Their chipper
blue print, breezy graphics and perky
exclamation points mock harried stu
dents as each minute past the promised
five ticks away.
Bitter men putter about with sadistic
smiles as they watch the line go out the
door and around White Plaza. It's hard to
restrain from peeling the signs off and
thwocking them on their heads. After all,
to do that, you'd lose your spot in line. A

less violent alternative might be to gauge
the inexplicably long "recovery" time in
between customers.
If students do reach the front of the
line and casually mention the irony of
having spent 45 minutes in line reading

Ultimately, we must resign
ourselves to memorizing
the postage rates to Koala
Lampur and the mailing
address of the official
stamp collectors' club.

the "five minutes or less" signs, they still
won't get much satisfaction. Bitter Man
Number One will be too quick for them.
His snappy reply: "It's five minutes per
customer, and we pride ourselves on
sticking to that." Makes sense, right?
Next time bring a stopwatch and see if it
holds up.
In any case, there's still plenty to gripe
about. Such as the tons of mail that go MIA
somewhere between Palo Alto and Stan
ford. Such as plane tickets to Paris sent
eight weeks in advance from New York and
not milking it to Stanford until the day
before departure. Or receiving magazines
months late. Reading November's news in
March loses its thrill quickly.

Have you ever noticed that the pack
age window always seems to be closed?
And that even when it is open, the door
is kept open for mere seconds at a time,
with a furtive hand reaching out for
those pink slips through the barely
cracked door?
I mean, what do they have to hide?
That is, aside from the fear that some
one will recognize that they are wearing
the item you ordered from J. Crew
months ago which mysteriously "disap
peared" in the mail.
Students often take out their frustra
tions over the interminable delays on the
postal workers, which is pretty uncool.
But it's hard to understand what takes so
long, and students receive a good amount
of condescension and other abuse from
workers as well.
Ultimately, we must resign ourselves
to memorizing the postage rates to Koala
Lampur and the mailing address of the
official stamp collectors' club. It's actual
ly pretty amazing, if you stop to consider
the wealth of information you can obtain
in an hour. . . .
Service in five minutes or less? It
depends which side of the counter you're
on.

Liz hopes the Three Bitter Men won't be
even more bitter after reading this.
