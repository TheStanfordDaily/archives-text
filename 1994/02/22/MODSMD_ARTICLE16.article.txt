## Senator says reforms might not improve accountability 
### 
IN RESPONSE to Gabe Lucas' Feb.
18 letter, I thought that a couple of
out-of-context "fects" and opinions
should be corrected before silence ren
ders them factual. All of this hubbub
began with Lucas' attempt to pass his
most recent bill on "senate restructur
ing," which is actually a grand term for
halving the size of the ASSU Senate and
creating geographical districts, all in the
attempt to "improve the efficiency and
accountability of the Student Senate."
After his bill's resounding defeat two
weeks ago, Lucas has resorted to a pub
lic forum, hoping to cast an unfavorable
light onto the senate in the hope of cast
ing himself as a "non-political outsider"
working for the needs of the students. I
believe another viewpoint is necessary to
shed greater light on these two issues.
What is disappointing about Lucas's
letter is his characterization of the sen
ate as a bunch of apathetic, indifferent,
special-interest-based resume packers
conspiring against any beneficial change.
The senators might have reacted differ
ently to Lucas' "efforts" if he asked
more than the few individuals who
might support his plan to any of the
meetings that he had attempting to
plumb student opinion. Many senators
did not even know of his original bill
until the night he presented it.
And after his bill was defeated and
senators met the next day with Cardinal
Consulting to address the issues that
Lucas brought up, he did not attend the
meeting and focused on writing a "new"
bill himself. Rather than working with
senators to achieve his stated goals, he
seemed more interested in maintaining
ownership of his ideas to the detriment
of the students.

Lucas also insinuates in his letter
that he is entirely "non-political" and
works only for the student interest.
However, he has not been involved in
any of the student-oriented projects
delivered within the last year such as
summer storage, the arrival of Taco Bell,
or the coming installation of cable TV on
campus — all of which were relevant
undergraduate campaign issues last
year. And he was the only undergradu
ate senator to vote against the Flicks
sound system last year, which is consid
ered one of the major accomplishments
of last year's senate.
In his defense, he did introduce legis
lation this year to require students to
request fee refunds three times a year
instead of once — but it seems that he
has focused on more cosmetic issues,
such as ASSU mechanics, rather than on
issues that students elected him to
address in the first place.
Lucas has also made claims on my
character with respect to the Flicks
sound system repayment plan. If Lucas
had taken as much time talking with the
financial manager as he did in typing his
sentence, he would have discovered that
the original repayment plan (that was
approved by last year's financial manag
er) was modified to come into accordance
with common accounting practices as
required by the ASSU auditors. And as
Financial Manager Brian Hillger stated,
"even though the method of repayment
does not follow the exact outline
approved, it does follow the spirit of the
plan."
Additionally, Lucas' comment sug
gesting that I was "getting back at him"
because I was scrutinizing his bill is
inappropriate. As a senator, I attempt to

examine the issues that are before me
and make an informed decision, rather
than make one based on a load of politi
cal rhetoric. This scrutiny that I gave his
bill is what caused me to vote against his
proposal, not because of any personal
vendetta I had against him. In essence,
Lucas' original bill had numerous gaps
that would not allow his plan to achieve
his stated goals of "improving efficiency
and accountability."
In debate, he was unable to substanti
ate his plan with any logical arguments
when asked. When presented with the
contrary arguments, such as the reduc
tion of the senator to student ratio, the
lack of regional (geographical) governing
and lack of accountability without said
governments, and the absurdity of ask
ing freshmen and first-year graduate stu
dents within five weeks of their arrival to
vote for senators that are supposed to
represent them, Lucas was unable to
rebut. His arguments that "anything is
better than status quo" and "people I
have spoken to say it is what they want"
while stating that he had only received
"two e-mail messages supporting his plan
and no calls" caused the bill to be defeat
ed by a significant margin.
Then, in his effort to "compromise,"
Lucas reintroduced his bill where he had
been informed by another senator that,
as parliamentarian, I would have to rule
it as inadmissible. Lucas chose not to
believe this and placed the bill along side
the other senate papers for that evening
without formally placing it on the agenda.
After the senate had approved 34 spe
cial fee requests, I informed the senate
chair and the deputy chair of my ruling
and also offered other options for Lucas'
bill to be reintroduced to the senate floor

in accordance with parliamentary rules.
Lucas, when informed of this ruling, was
more upset with the fact that there would
l>e no meeting for the next week rather
than getting his bill on the floor for that
evening. It seems to me that Lucas' main
concern was to insure the capability for a
special election this quarter — for what
ever reason he had in mind.
For all Lucas' commenting, I am still
plagued by two questions that he has yet
to answer in any straightforward way.
They are:
• Why would districting improve
accountability of the senators? With
more than 80 dorm governments, vari
ous fraternities and off-campus stu
dents, how will districting provide
improved accountability with just 20
senators?
• How does moving the election from
spring to fall improve effectiveness or
accountability? Who would want cam
paign for elections or special fees during
the busiest and most disorienting weeks
of the year?
Finally, I have wondered about Lucas'
motivations. I sincerely hope that he has
the interests of the student body at
heart, and I can understand that school
and other activities do tend to be a drain
on resources which can cause rash com
ments to be made without checking out
their validity. But if he thinks that using
public forums to level vituperative
charges with little factual substance on
the senate as a whole is his way of show
ing the populace that he is doing his job,
then I hope he realizes that teamwork
and effort go much further.
