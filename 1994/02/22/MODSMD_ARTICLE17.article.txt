# N'Gai Croal: fly in the buttermilk
## Anarchy in the U.K. better than Made in U.S.A.?

THE ANNUAL delirium of Oscar
fever can't hide the fact that there Ls
a crisis in contemporary American
screen acting. With each passing year, we
see fewer and fewer great performances.
And as up-and-coming actors forsake the
stage as a training ground, instead choos
ing television, music videos and commer
cials as their stepping-stones, the future
for acting in America seems bleak.
It wasn't always so. Marlon Brando's
incarnation of Stanley Kowalski in Ten
nessee Williams' "A Streetcar Named
Desire" cast aside then-traditional acting
styles with the Method. An expressive
type of acting pioneered by Constantin
Stanislavsky, then taught to Brando by
Lee Strasberg and Stella Adler, the
Method influenced virtually every actor
who came afterwards, from James Dean
to Robert De Niro.
By the time he made his screen debut
in "The Men" (1950), Brando had been
acting on Broadway and training with
Adler for six years, during which he had
already starred in the stage version of
"Streetcar." Four years later, he took

home an Academy Award for his perfor
mance in "On the Waterfront," etching
the phrase "I coulda been a contenda" into
the minds of audiences for years to come.
De Niro and his peers from the genera
tion of actors that succeeded Brando —
A 1 Pacino, Jack Nicholson, Harvey Keitel
and Dustin Hoffman — refined the
Method in a series of edgy, volatile perfor
mances that set the benchmark for we
would today consider "realistic acting."
Their work in a series of seminal films
from the late '60s to the '70s — "Taxi
Driver," "Dog Day Afternoon," "One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," "Mean
Streets" and "Midnight Cowboy" — com
bined Brando's inarticulateness in
"Waterfront" with his rebellious nihilism
in "The Wild One."
As Vietnam and Watergate burst onto
the American agenda, audiences seemed
to relate more to shifty, ambiguous char
acters than the stock heroes — and these
actors rose to the occasion. De Niro's
"You talkin' to me?" became a catch
phrase, as did Pacino's shouts of "Attica,
Attica!" and Hoffman's "I'm walkin'

here." Nicholson's confrontations with
Nurse Hatched embodied the current
anti-authoritarian mood. And those who
saw Keitel's moody Catholic anti-heroes
wouldn't find his romantic turn in "The
Piano" at all surprising.
But then came the '80s. The rich got
richer, the poor got poorer and acting fol
lowed the poor into the abyss. Each of the
aforementioned actors — Brando includ
ed — traded in the rigors of characteriza
tion for the ease of technique somewhere
around 1983. De Niro leveled off with
"The King of Comedy" (1983), Pacino,
with "Scarface" (1983), Nicholson, with
"The Shining" (1980) and Hoffman with
"Tootsie" (1982).
From that year on, none has delivered
a lead performance that comes close to
matching his earlier work. In more recent
films like "Cape Fear," "Scent of A
Woman," "Hoffa" and "Rain Man," these
actors painstakingly research and
rehearse their roles, displaying an
impressive assortment of tics, twitches
and accents and abrasive attitude. But
these mannerisms are just showy efforts

to cover up the emptiness of safe, soulless
characters — full of sound and fury, sig
nifying nothing.
Our current crop of actors doesn't
even have this much skill and training, as
embodied by Tom Cruise. In an ideal
world, Cruise, who has turned in two
competent performances ("The Color of
Money," and "Rain Man"), would be a
model, not an actor. Like Christian
Slater, Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen,
Cruise and his contemporaries play the
same character in every film — only the
names change. He stretched mightily in
"Born on the Fourth of July," but never
managed to rise above trying to play the
part.
This generation has little, if any the
atrical experience. They move from com
mercials to lead roles with the greatest of
ease, and audiences that hunger for the
next hot young actor consume them with
glee. But acting in front of a camera only
requires them to concentrate from
"action" to "cut," whereas theater
demands that they concentrate from the
time the curtain is raised until it drops.

Theater, not film, is the actor's medium.
So it should come as no surprise that
Cruise and company haven't delivered
any performances that can aspire to leg
end — they don't know how to do it
because they've never bothered to learn
how. And if we keep buying enough tick
ets for their mediocre movies to justify
their multi-million dollar salaries, why
should they learn?
The majority of today's actors that
show promise — Gary Oldman, Tim
Roth, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes — or
have delivered brilliant performances —
Daniel Day-Lewis, Anthony Hopkins and
David Thewiis — aren't American. All
have extensive theater backgrounds, and
continue to perform onstage. That's why
only one of the last four Best Actor win
ners — and just two of this year's five
Best Actor nominees — hail from the
United States.
American actors, it seems, can no
longer be contendas.
