# Women's basketball humiliates Cal, 111-64
## Largest losing margin in Berkeley history 
### Greg Collins Editorial staff 
California may have the Axe, but the
Stanford women's basketball team chopped
its way into the Golden Bears' record book
Friday night by handing Cal its worst defeat
in school history.
Combining pinpoint shooting with a tran
sition game triggered by stifling defense, the
No. 13 Cardinal (16-5, 9-3 in Pacific 10 Con
ference) demolished the Bears 111-64. The
47-point margin broke the old record of 42,
which was set Feb. 6,1987 by USC. Stanford
came within two points of tying the record
for most points ever scored against Cal,
which was set two years ago by the Cardinal
when it crushed the Bears 113-79.
"This was obviously a good win for our
team," said head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"We got out running and our transition game
was real good and I think that was a result of
people being aggressive defensively."
Led by junior Anita Kaplan's inside pres
ence and senior Christy Hedgpeth's long

range shooting, Stanford shot a remarkable
57.7 percent from the field. The Cardinal
was iO-of-20 from behind the three-point
stripe, led by Hedgpeth's 5-of-8 shooting.
The senior's 23 points led a foursome of
Stanford players scoring double figures.
Kaplan added 22, freshman Kate Starbird
knocked down 19 and sophomore Bobbie
Kelsey tallied 15.
"I think Christy's really doing what a
senior has to do in stepping up her play,"
VanDerveer said. "Her shooting is probably
her strength, but she's really running the
floor well, her defense is improving and she's
rebounding well."
Despite the Cardinal's complete domina
tion of the Bears (8-14, 2-10), the first seven
minutes did not foreshadow the record point
output. However, Stanford started on a 24-4
run at the 12:36 mark with back-to-back
Hedgpeth three-pointers, pushing the Cardi
nal's lead from three to 23 points in just over
six-and-a-half minutes.
