# Women's basketball humiliates Cal, 111-64
## Largest losing margin in Berkeley history 
### Greg Collins Editorial staff 
California may have the Axe, but the
Stanford women's basketball team chopped
its way into the Golden Bears' record book
Friday night by handing Cal its worst defeat
in school history.
Combining pinpoint shooting with a tran
sition game triggered by stifling defense, the
No. 13 Cardinal (16-5, 9-3 in Pacific 10 Con
ference) demolished the Bears 111-64. The
47-point margin broke the old record of 42,
which was set Feb. 6,1987 by USC. Stanford
came within two points of tying the record
for most points ever scored against Cal,
which was set two years ago by the Cardinal
when it crushed the Bears 113-79.
"This was obviously a good win for our
team," said head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"We got out running and our transition game
was real good and I think that was a result of
people being aggressive defensively."
Led by junior Anita Kaplan's inside pres
ence and senior Christy Hedgpeth's long

range shooting, Stanford shot a remarkable
57.7 percent from the field. The Cardinal
was iO-of-20 from behind the three-point
stripe, led by Hedgpeth's 5-of-8 shooting.
The senior's 23 points led a foursome of
Stanford players scoring double figures.
Kaplan added 22, freshman Kate Starbird
knocked down 19 and sophomore Bobbie
Kelsey tallied 15.
"I think Christy's really doing what a
senior has to do in stepping up her play,"
VanDerveer said. "Her shooting is probably
her strength, but she's really running the
floor well, her defense is improving and she's
rebounding well."
Despite the Cardinal's complete domina
tion of the Bears (8-14, 2-10), the first seven
minutes did not foreshadow the record point
output. However, Stanford started on a 24-4
run at the 12:36 mark with back-to-back
Hedgpeth three-pointers, pushing the Cardi
nal's lead from three to 23 points in just over
six-and-a-half minutes.

Junior Kate Paye scores two of her nine points in Friday night's rout of Cal. Paye also
'Chipped in seven assists, six rebounds and was a stopper on defense.
"They can't guard outside and
inside as strongly as they need to
when we're hitting outside,"
Kaplan said.
Leading by 22 at the start of the
second half, the Cardinal went on a
19-6 run in the first four-and-a-half
minutes to put Cal away for good.
The Bears never got the deficit back
under 32.
"We got on a roll tonight," Van-
Derveer said. "The basket got big
and a lot of people were playing
well. We just had too many weapons
going at the same time."
Surprisingly, one of the many
Stanford weapons not fighting
against Cal was junior Rachel Hem
mer. Sidelined with early foul trou
ble, the team's leading scorer played
just 17 minutes, making only one of
four shots for two points.
Even with the absence of Hem

mer, Stanford didn't miss a beat, as
Starbird filled for the power for
ward. In the first half, Starbird
scored 11 points on perfect 4-for-4
field goal shooting and 3-for-3 on
free throws.
"I think everyone's beginning to
step up," Starbird said. "The fresh
men, with the amount of experience
we've had, we're not really fresh
men anymore and we're not allowed
to play like freshmen anymore."
Working all week in practice on
getting good passing lanes to the
low post, the Cardinal broke down
every defense Cal tried against
them. The 35 assists recorded by
Stanford is the second highest total
in school history. Freshman guard
Jamila Wideman led the team with
eight, regularly leading the fast
break and finding open shots for
Cardinal players.
"It's real simple," said Cal head
coach Gooch Foster. "When teams
get going, especially when you're at
home, and you get on a roll, its con
tagious. Everybody gets on a roll."
