It was raining Sundance Mining Compa
ny caps Friday night in Maples Pavilion.
For those unfamiliar with women's bas
ketball tradition at Maples, little kids toss
the caps into the stands every time a Cardi
nal three-pointer finds its way into the
hoop. Friday night, those kids were getting
some exercise.
The women's basketball team, led by
senior Christy Hedgpeth, sunk a stunning
total of 10 three-pointers to secure their
111-64 blowout against the California Gold
en Bears. Hedgpeth alone tallied five three
pointers out of eight attempts.
Coming up short on her first two three
point shots in the first half, Hedgpeth
adjusted her shot and proceeded to rack up
a game-high 23 points.
"(After the first two misses] I was tenta
tive, but I just let them go and they went
in," said Hedgpeth. "After I make my first
one I get a little more confident. n «

treys in only four minutes, followed by a
three-point jumper by teammate Kate Paye
that capped a 15-0 Cardinal scoring streak
early in the first half.
Freshman Tara Harrington added to the
assault with another three-pointer, giving
the Cardinal a 24-point lead later that half.
The Cardinal's first-half efforts spelled out
an impressive 45.5 three-point shooting
percentage.
The second half resulted in even greater
success as Hedgpeth hit two more treys in
the first six minutes on assists by freshman
Jamila Wideman. Sophomore Bobbie
Kelsey, ranked second in the Pacific 10 Con
ference with a three-point percentage of
.438, donated another three points to the
Cardinal score later in the half.
Senior co-captain Niki Sevillian and
sophomore Amy Wustefeld followed the
three-point trend with one jumper each dur
ing the last minutes of the game.
The second half ended with an impres
sive three-point shot percentage of 55.6, as
opposed to Cal's 25 mark. All told,
Stanford shot 10-for-20 from out
side 19 feet, nine inches and Cal
went one-for-eight.
The numbers from Friday night
are characteristic of the Cardinal's
successes this season. The team is
currently ranked number one in
the Pac-10 for its three-point field
goal percentage of 39.9. Along with
Kelsey, Hedgpeth and Paye are
ranked in the top eight in three
point shooting percentage.
The Cardinal has now made an
incredible 70 three-pointers in its

last 10 games, making 45 percent
over that span. In its first game
against Cal this year, Stanford
scored 12 three-pointers, the most
this season in a Pac-10 contest.
With the inside game ruled by
juniors Anita Kaplan and Rachel
Hemmer, the outside shooting
rounds out the team's strength at
different shooting ranges.
Adding in the team's low
turnovers and heightened intensi
ty, it's no wonder the Cardinal
defeated the Bears.
"If they're hitting outside like
tonight, [Stanford] is an extremely,
extremely good team. I'm not sur
prised to see them playing like that,
especially here," said Cal coach
Gooch Foster.
