# A 						new sports scandal, for America's sake
## Long-awaited match-up between Kerrigan, Harding finally here 
### 
Well, it's Week Two of the
Tonya and Nancy Olympics Pre
view Show. Believe it or not,
rumor has it that tonight they
both are actually going to skate.
Honest.
The Harding-Kerrigan affair
has filled a void in American lore
that the National Football League
created last year when it abbrevi
ated the layoff time between the
conference championships and
the Super Bowl. This year, just as
the media were warming up, the
game arrived. And so, mild-man
nered journalists from Portland to
Detroit were left with a lot of inno
vative ways to hype, but nothing
to hype about.
Couple that with the end of the
Bobbitt saga, a mistrial in the

Menendez afTair and the one-year
anniversary of the three net
works' different television movies

on the Amy Fish
er story, and our
country was
primed for a new
sordid tale.
Enter Tonya.
Harding, who has
sold her story to
"Inside Edition"
(and apparently
been offered
funds to pose for

"Playboy"), got to Lillehammer
late last week. This arrival was big
news because only a week earlier,
whether she would compete in the
XVII Olympic Winter Games was
in doubt. Was she, or was she not,

involved in the plot to attack Ker
rigan at the U.S. Figure Skating
Championships which resulted in

a clubbing of
Nancy's knee?
That
notwithstand
ing, Harding
was allowed to
remain on the
U.S. squad.
Ironically, the
ice rink that
she and Nancy
will compete in

is located in the Norwegian town
of Hamar (pronounced Hammer).
Kind of gives Tonya a bit of a psy
chological edge. Was the location
of the arena also one of Harding's
plots?

Next thing you know, Harding
will replace Kerrigan's music for
the long program so that mid-rou
tine the loudspeaker will blare:
"Stop! Hamartime!"
The big issue upon Harding's
arrival was that she and Nancy
would be staying in the same dor
mitory complex in the Olympic
Village â€” what would they say to
each other? Neither of the skaters
revealed this crucial piece of infor
mation at their respective press
conferences. My guess is that
Tonya spotted her in the hall and
said, "I'm baaack!" and that was
that. Needless to say, there was no
late-night sharing of milk and
cookies.

Both did, though, share the
same practice time at the ice rink.
Customarily, that's what team
mates do. And hundreds of
reporters gathered around to watch
them practice. Talk about excite
ment! Never mind that other actu
al events were going on. Here was
the chance to reach that segment of

the population that never reads the
sports pages, and by gosh, this was
the tabloid story to do it.
And so, while world records
were being set, and medals were
being won, the rest of the Olympics
has served as a backdrop to Tonya
and Nancy. U.S. speedskater Dan
Jansen ended his Olympic frustra
tion, while Bonnie Blair racked up
yet another gold. Not even the
arrival of Italy's playboy/skier
Alberto Tomba could upstage what
everyone around the world has

gone "Gillooly" over.
Finally, it's time for women's
figure skating. Until now, everyone
has scrutinized and analyzed the
figures. All that remains is to judge
the skating
That's where David Letterman's
mom steps in.

Who are we kidding? David
Schwartz would have reported
the same kind of smut if The
Daily had the budget to send him
there.
