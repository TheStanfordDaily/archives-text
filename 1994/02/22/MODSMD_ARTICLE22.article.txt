# Undefeated swimmers swamp Cal in the rain

### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
When the Stanford men's swim team trav
eled to Michigan in January it was cold, but at
least the swimming took place indoors. Satur
day, in the midst of a constant driving rain, the
Cardinal (10-0) wrapped up its second consecu
tive undefeated season by drowning California
188-101.
While it wasn't ideal spectator weather,
there were many parents in the bleachers sup
porting the team, in particular the seven seniors
making their final appearances at deGuerre
pool.
Ix i ading the way for the Class of '94 were
Derek Weatherford and Tyler May field, who
each won two events. Mayfield reached a per
sonal goal in the 100-yard breaststroke, break
ing the pool record in a time of 54.70 seconds.
"The record was held by (ex-Cardinal star
and Olympian) John Moffet," Mayfield said. "I
grew up with him as one of my heroes. (Break
ing) the record has always been one of my goals
— to see if I can surpass some of the things he
has done. It's an honor."
Stanford coach Skip Kenney was impressed
with Mayfield's determination and effort
despite the unkind conditions.
"He wanted the pool record and this was his
last chance," Kenney said. "He just said, 'I'm
going after it,' and he put the elements out of
his head."
Mayfield looked at the rain as a challenge. "If
you can perform well under the worst condi
tions, then you know you'll be able to perform at
NCAAs, which are indoors with perfect climate
and perfect conditions."

Although Kenney was pleased with some of
the individual performances, such as senior J.J.
Freitag (100 breast), junior Clay Tippins (100
butterfly) and sophomore Joe Hudepohl (50 and
100 freestyle), there were also efforts that he
questioned.
"Weather like this is actually a blessing,"
Kenney said. "It makes the athletes think,
'What can I learn about myself?' Today, the
competition was Cal and the weather. It was

mostly positive, most of the guys swam hard,
and I know where they are in their training and
how much rest they need. A couple guys, I can't
evaluate."
Weatherford, winner of the 100 and 200
backstroke, was happy with his swims. He
called the weather "more of a factor than usual.
It was the coldest meet I've ever been involved

with," said Weatherford. "Coach
was pretty upset because we didn't
mentally prepare for the physical
barriers."
Unfortunately the Golden
Bears had to contend with the
same physical barriers as the Car
dinal, and the result was Stanford
winning 11 of the 15 individual

events. Weatherford, Mayfield,
Hudepohl and diver James
Edwards won two events apiece,
with senior Trip Zedlitz (200 indi
vidual medley), sophomore Eric
Diehl (200 free) and Tippins each
winning one race.
Stanford now turns its atten
tion to the upcoming Pacific 10
Conference championships, March
3-5 in Long Beach, Calif.
"I couldn't ask for a better situ
ation," Mayfield said. "I'm right on
the mark. The team is swimming

great and we've got lofty goals. I'm
out to defend my Pac-10 title in the
100 breast to make it four in a row.
I have lots of confidence and I'm
excited."
Kenney is also looking forward
to the most important time of the
season. "I'm really pleased that
we've shown we are the best team
in the dual-meet season. Now we
have to prove it in the champi
onship season. Now the fun starts
— this is why we've worked so
hard."
