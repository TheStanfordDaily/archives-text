# Men's volleyball loses in straight sets to BYU
## Loss attributed to defensive problems 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Stanford's men's volleyball
team learned something that's true
in almost every team sport ever
invented — you can't win without
defense.
On a night when hitting, passing
and setting all came together for
the Cardinal, their blocking and
digging failed them, as No. 4
Brigham Young swept by Stanford
15-11, 17-15, 16-14.
The Cougars brought out their
big guns Saturday night and pun
ished the Cardinal at the net, as
BYU's senior middle blocker Ethan
Watts pounded out 19 kills for an
unheard-of .826 hitting percentage.
"Ethan shouldn't have hit that
high," said Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves. "That's just like hit
ting against no block."
Senior captain Joe Burghardt,
who hit an impressive .611 himself,
admitted, "I didn't block Ethan
very well and he took me to school."
What was worse than Watts,
though, was the combination of
Watts and fellow middle blocker
Kevin Hambly, who converted 27
of 40 kill opportunities for a .525
average on the night.
Overall, the Cougars (4-3, 3-3 in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation) outhit Stanford (6-4, 5-1)
.474 to .354, but the problem ran
deeper, as BYU outpaced the Cardi
nal in total blocks by a 17-9 margin.
"I was very disappointed with
our blocking and digging," Nieves
said. "In other areas I think we were
fairly even, but we have to realize
that winning starts at the net."
Despite the disparity on defense,
however, the Cardinal did manage
to give the 1,035 fans in attendance
their money's worth with a one
hour, 50-minute nailbiter.
"We were really lucky to get out
of here in three games," Hambly
said. "It was the longest three
game match I've ever played, and
they gave us a real tough fight. This
is the type of match you play volley
ball for."
Afler a seesaw battle in the first
game, the Stanford squad could not
find its rhythm as the Cardinal
eventually succumbed to a 15-11
Cougar effort. In the second game,
however, Stanford turned on the
afterburners and gave BYU a run

for its money.
Relying on timely serving and
consistent side-outs, the Cardinal
gained momentum in the second
frame with a 7-3 advantage before
BYU rattled off four unanswered
points to tie the match at seven.
From that point the two squads
tightened the purse strings and
grudgingly exchanged point-for
point and sideout-for-sideout.
Two consecutive Canyon Ceman
service aces propelled the Cardinal
to a 12-12 tie. However, BYU
reclaimed the lead at 14-13 on a
Watts kill.
Serving for game point, BYU
came within inches of securing the
game, but outside hitter Eric Wells,
a junior, gave Stanford a second
chance with a knuckle-scraping dig
which junior Brian Garrett con
verted into a sideout kill.
Garrett then served for the tie,
and seven sideouts later, the
Cougars blocked a Matt Fuer
bringer attack for their 15th point.
Fuerbringer then redeemed him
self with a sideout kill, and Ceman
pushed the game into over-scoring
with a two-hit attack.
However, despite its valiant
comeback, Stanford could not stop
the Cougar offense as BYU edged
out the Cardinal 17-15.
"I thought we showed a lot of
heart," Ceman said. "It was our
inexperience that showed through.
We had a couple of crucial service
errors, and we didn't execute the
fundamentals. When it came down
to the big plays, they just didn't
make any mistakes."
It was the same scenario in game
three, as Stanford fell behind early
and clawed its way back from a 14-9
deficit by staving off a half hour's
worth of match-point attempts by
BYU. Finally, Fuerbringer aced a
serve to pull the Cardinal within
one, and Lambert provided the kill
that knotted the game at 14.
Once again however, with victo
ry within its grasp, Stanford was
denied by a persistent Cougar
squad. Putting on a hitting and
blocking clinic, BYU sealed the Car
dinal's fate with a Pat Sinclair solo
block on point 16 of the game.
"When the game got close, we
just kept our composure and
turned up the intensity," said
Cougar outside hitter Brad Gold
ston.

out the Cardinal 17-15.
"I thought we showed a lot of
heart," Ceman said. "It was our
inexperience that showed through.
We had a couple of crucial service
errors, and we didn't execute the
fundamentals. When it came down
to the big plays, they just didn't
make any mistakes."
It was the same scenario in game
three, as Stanford fell behind early
and clawed its way back from a 14-9
deficit by staving off a half hour's
worth of match-point attempts by
BYU. Finally, Fuerbringer aced a
serve to pull the Cardinal within
one, and Lambert provided the kill
that knotted the game at 14.
Once again however, with victo
ry within its grasp, Stanford was
denied by a persistent Cougar
squad. Putting on a hitting and
blocking clinic, BYU sealed the Car
dinal's fate with a Pat Sinclair solo
block on point 16 of the game.
"When the game got close, we
just kept our composure and
turned up the intensity," said
Cougar outside hitter Brad Gold
ston.
