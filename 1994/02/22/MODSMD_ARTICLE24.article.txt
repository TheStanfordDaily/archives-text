# Tennis edges Cal
## Final warm-up before National Indoors 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
In between this weekend's
driving rainstorms, the No. 2-
ranked Stanford men's tennis
team snuck in two wins in its
final two dual meets before
National Team Indoors. In Fri
day's 4-0 win over University of
California at Irvine and a tight
4-3 win over California Sunday,
Stanford continued on its win
ning ways in upping its dual
meet record to 8-0.
Against the Irvine Anteaters,
it looked that there would be no
match at all since all the courts
were wet from intermittent rain
storms.
However, as courts dried,
players began their singles
matches, hoping that the dou
bles would be unnecessary.
Indeed they would be, as Stan
ford quickly won four singles
matches in straight sets.
"We handled [Irvine] pretty
easily, quite frankly," Gould
said. "But I don't know whether
that was because they played
poorly or because we forced
them to (play poorly)."
The remaining singles and
doubles matches were discon
tinued to provide the Anteaters
with enough time to catch their
plane for sunnier Southern Cal
ifornia.
Stanford's Saturday match
against California was post
poned because of more rain.
When the time came for the two
to meet on Sunday, Stanford
found itself once again playing
without still-healing senior Ail-
American Michael Flanagan in
the singles lineup.
"It was a calculated gamble
going in without Mike," Gould
said. "But the guys really came
through."
Stanford managed to get the
first point on the board as it
won the first two doubles

matches. Flanagan paired up
with senior Chris Cocotos at
No. 1 doubles and defeated
Cal's Brian Eagle and Steve
Lappin by a score of 8-4. At No.
2 doubles, the Cardinal tandem
of Vimal Patel and Jeff Salzen
stein teamed up to down Cal's
David Melmed and Dan Hiddle
son at 8-5.
At No. 3, the Cal doubles
team of Michael Hill-Julian
Zajfen salvaged a 9-8 (7-5) win
against Cardinal freshman
Grant Elliott and senior Robert
Devens, but the doubles point
had already been decided.
Next, Stanford got two more
points when Salzenstein beat
Eagle 6-3, 6-2 at No. 1 singles
and Jim Thomas beat Cal's Hid
dleson by a score of 6-3, 6-2 at
No. 5. With the two quick sin
gles wins, the Cardinal had a 3-
0 lead and only needed one more
match to clinch the win.
But Cal was not the same
team that had played so poorly
at the Rolex Northern Califor
nia Regional at Stanford last
fall. Cal got on the board as the
Bears' Hill beat Devens at No. 3
singles 6-4, 6-2. The remaining
three singles matches were dog
fights as all three went into
their third sets. And although
Stanford was up a break in all
three, the day's match was far
from over.
Down 4-2 in the third set,
Cal's No. 12-ranked Casey
Louie played a tenacious and
consistent baseline game at No.
2 singles to wear down Patel by
a final score of 6-4, 4-6, 7-5.
Likewise, Bear teammate Lap
pin came back from down a
break at 3-1 to win five straight
games and the No. 4 singles
match over Cocotos by a score of
7-6, 1-6, 6-3. The overall match
score became tied at 3-3.
