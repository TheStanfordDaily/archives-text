# Baseball takes two of three from Hawaii
## 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
As it has done before in this young season,
the Stanford baseball team once again rose to
the occasion when faced with adversity.
The Cardinal took two of three from the
high-powered Hawaii Rainbows last weekend
at Rainbow Stadium in Honolulu. The victo
ries improve the Cardinal's record to 9-6 with
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division com
petition less than a week away.
Stanford jumped out to a one-run lead early
in the first game, with left-fielder Rich Crowe
leading off with a double in the second inning
and first baseman Steve Carver following with
a single to right to score Crowe.
However, the Cardinal were unable to get
anything else going against Hawaii starter
Bobby Moore (2-0), who was masterful on the
mound, retiring 15 consecutive Stanford bat
ters after giving up the single to Carver.
"[Moore] had good stuff today," Carver said
in a KZSU interview. "He threw his fastball
pretty well and positioned it nicely, and he had

his off-speed stuff working today."
The Rainbows took command of the game
in the fourth, scoring two runs on RBI singles
by catcher Tyler Cheff and second baseman
Corey Ishigo, and added another in the fifth,
one in the seventh, and two in the eighth en
route to a 6-3 victoiy.
The Rainbows were the first team since Cal
State-Fullerton in the season opener to finally
break through against Stanford southpaw
Dan Reed (2-2). In his past three starts, Reed
had given up no runs and only 11 hits and had
led the starting rotation with a 1.64 earned
run average.
In Saturday's game, Stanford faced Hawaii
lefthander Roger Mills, who had a 2-0 record
and a 2.45 ERA. The red-hot senior was com
ing off a complete-game victory over then-No.
2 ranked Florida State in his last start, and is
considered the ace of the Rainbow staff.
Cardinal second baseman Jed Hansen was
up to the challenge, however. Hansen went
three-for-four with two doubles and four
RBIs, including a big two-run double with two
outs in the top of the ninth inning that pow

ered Stanford to a 7-5 victory. Stanford came
alive offensively in the game, pounding out 13
hits, including seven doubles.
"We as a team feel we can put together a lot
more runs than we have in the past few games
since we've been struggling," Hansen said on
KZSU. "We just tried to be really aggressive
today and swing the bat consistently."
Freshman relief ace Tom Reimers (1-1)
picked up the victory after pitching two per
fect innings in relief of righthanders Todd
Bartels and Ben Rada.
"I thought it was a good win for us," said
Stanford coach Mark Marquess on KZSU.
"We battled extremely well, especially offen
sively, which we haven't done much this year.
I was very pleased with our performance with
the bat."
In Sunday's game, Stanford's freshman
flamethrower Jason Middlebrook was
replaced after only 1 1/3 innings after strug
gling with his control in the second inning and
trailing 3-1.
