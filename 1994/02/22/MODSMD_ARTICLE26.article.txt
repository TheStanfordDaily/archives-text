The Stanford women gymnasts had a roller-coast
er weekend as they posted the highest and lowest
team scores of the season in just two days.
The Cardinal gave a record-breaking performance
at Cal State-Fullerton last Friday, defeating the
Titans in their own gym for the first time in 19 years.
At University of California at Santa Barbara Satur
day, the tables were turned as the Cardinal lost by
almost two points.
Stanford received 190.175 points against Fuller
ton's 189.900. Stanford won two events — uneven
bars and beam — but lost vault and floor at this meet.
In contrast, at Saturday's meet against the UCSB
Gauchos, the Cardinal team lost each event and
brought in its lowest score of the season, 186.050. The
Gauchos received a score of 187.950.
Because of a strain in her back, junior Meegan
Lannin, a gymnast whose performance usually adds
over'a point to the overall team score, was out of the
lineup this weekend.
"We had a great meet against Fullerton," said head
coach Breck Greenwood. "For us to do that well with
out Meegan was very significant."
In the all-around competition, first place went to
Fullerton's Celeste Delia with a 39.075. Cardinal
junior Jen 6 Elzie took second place with a season-high
score of 38.750 and Titan Cristi Clifford came in third
with a 38.650.
The Cardinal team's score of 48.125 was the high
est score of the season on bars, as there were no falls
for the second meet in a row. First place went to Stan
ford's Katie Jennings, a freshman, with a 9.850,
Titan Delia took second and Cardinal sophomore
Hillary Anderson placed third.
On the vault, Elzie took first place with a score of
9.800, which broke Stanford's school record. Second
and third places went to Fullerton's Delia and Clif
ford, respectively. As a mental preparation for upcom
ing meets, Cardinal coaches had sophomore Linda
Chun warm up vault at this meet, though she did not
actually compete in the event.
Though first place on the floor went to Fullerton's
Delia with a 9.850, Cardinal junior Tina Snowden was
not far behind with a 9.825 to tie for second with Clif
ford. This score greatly improved Snowden's previous
season high of 9.700. Jennings and Anderson also
broke personal season highs with respective scores of
9.775 and 9.700. In spite of a fall in her last pass, Elzie
brought in a high score of 9.500.
The Cardinal team received a season-high score of
47.950 on the beam, with first and second places
