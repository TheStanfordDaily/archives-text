# Women's tennis spanks WSU, sneaks by gritty Cal squad 6-3
## 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
In the locker room of the Cali
fornia women's tennis team, there
is a list of goals. They include hav
ing an undefeated season, winning
the Pacific 10 Conference title and
winning the NCAA champi
onships. But right on top, above all
others, is the squad's No. 1 goal —
"Beat Stanford."
That top goal was set just a wee
bit too high.
On Sunday the Stanford
women's tennis team (10-0) broke
a three-year drought by beating
Cal (4-1) at the Hellman Tennis
Center, 6-3, thereby snapping the
Bears' 15-match home unbeaten
streak. Previously, in Friday's
rain, the Cardinal demolished
Washington State 6-0 at the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium.
Cal was ranked No. 3 in the
country (behind top-ranked Texas
and Stanford) and had beaten
Stanford at Cal for the past two
seasons. But this year the Bears
lost all the key matches, and with
them, their goal of an undefeated
season.
One of those key matches was
at No. 4 singles, where sophomore
Beth Berris took the court against
Cal's Nicole Elliott, a player Berris
has had trouble with in the past.
"Beth lost to this girl at the
Pac-10 Indoors [earlier this sea
son]," said Cardinal head coach
Frank Brennan. "Elliott was play
ing well then. She's a nightmare
now."
Berris started off well against
the "nightmare," winning the first
set 6-2. But Elliott bounced back,

mixing backhand slices with drop
shots to snatch the second set 6-4.
By the time the third set rolled
around, the other singles matches
were over and all eyes were on this
crucial match.
"I knew it was 3-2 [Stanford],"
Berris said. "The whole crowd was
watching. There was some pres
sure, but I liked that."
Playing her "best match of the
season" according to Brennan,
Berris sculpted a 6-4 third-set win,
thereby sending the Cardinal into
the doubles slate needing only one
win to clinch a victory.
Although at times it seemed
that win would come easily, it did
not. All three Stanford doubles
teams won their first sets, then
were down in the second.
"First it looked like we'd win
[the dual meet], then it looked like
we'd lose, then win again, and
then lose again," Brennan said of
the roller-coaster ride of a doubles
slate.
Finally Stanford's No. 1 dou
bles team of Laxmi Poruri and
Katie Schlukebir took control. The
duo was matched up against the
Cal team of Pam Nelson and
Keirsten Alley, the No. 1 doubles
team in the country. The Cardinal
took the first set easily 6-1, then
lost a heartbreaker of a second set
7-6 after passing up two match
points.
"They started out like a house
on fire," Brennan said. "Then in
the second set they headed south."
But the Cardinal's senior/fresh
man combo was able to stick
together to win the third set 6-4,
thus ensuring Stanford's 10th
dual meet win.

The senior half of the team
expected such a see-saw match.
Poruri had played against this Cal
duo last season, when she was
teamed with now-graduated
Heather Willens.
"Against that team there are
many momentum shifts," Poruri
said. "The match was like a yo-yo
. . . we just played power tennis in
the third set to win."
Her freshman teammate was
ecstatic after her first close team
victory.
"We went nuts," Schlukebir
said. "It was a great experience.
I've never had that team experi
ence before."
Not all of Schlukebir's match
es on Sunday were great, howev
er. She lost her first singles
match of the season 6-2, 6-1 to
Vera Vitels at No. 3 singles.
Vitels, a transfer from Drake
University, was "probably Cal's
best player of the day," Brennan
said. "She was really unbeliev
able."
"I had a lot of chances but I
couldn't get over the little humps
that would have given me oppor
tunities to win," Schlukebir said.
Poruri didn't have too many
"little humps" in her 6-1, 6-2 dis
mantling of lOth-ranked Pam
Nelson at No. 1 singles. Nor did
Sandra De Silva, as the freshman
remained undefeated with a 7-5,
6-1 victory over Angela Nelson at
No. 6 singles.
Cal's Jennifer Poulos defeated
Kristine Kurth at No. 2 singles 6-
4, 6-2, but her twin Valerie was
not as successful, losing to senior
Emma Woodhouse 6-4, 6-4 at No.
5 singles.
