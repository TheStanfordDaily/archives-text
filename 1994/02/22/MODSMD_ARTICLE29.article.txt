The two-time defending
national champion Stanford
men's gymnastics team remained
undefeated by ousting Brigham
Young in Provo, Utah last Fri
day. Stanford's 278.4 to 270.1
victory was better than Cardinal
head coach Sadao Hamada said
he expected.
Indeed, Hamada said he
entered the dual meet with mere
intentions of giving his athletes
more experience on particular
routines and also trying out more
difficult maneuvers. Despite the

resulting lineups in some events,
however, Stanford still captured
five out of six events.
Senior tri-captain Mark Booth
led the way with first-place finish
es on the pommel horse, parallel
bars and high bars, scoring a 9.75,
9.50 and 9.55 respectively. Fresh
man lan Bachrach won the vault
and floor exercises with scores of
9.65 and 9.75 respectively.
Hamada noted that many of
his athletes eliminated errors
from their routines and that the
team improved on the vault.
