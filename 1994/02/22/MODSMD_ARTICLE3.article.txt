# H&S creates new senior dean post
## Camarillo to step down next year; new dean will oversee undergrads 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
The School of Humanities and
Sciences will have a new senior as
sociate dean for undergraduate
studies next academic year, a struc
ture prompted by the job changes of
two associate deans.
A 1 Camarillo, H&S associate
dean and director of undergraduate
studies, will work at the Center for
Advanced Studies in Behavioral
Sciences next academic year and
will finish a book he is working on.
In addition, H&S Associate Dean
and Director of Overseas Studies
Russell Berman will devote all his
time to directing Stanford's over
seas programs beginning in Octo
ber.
Starting next year, Camarillo's
tasks that deal with H&S under
graduates will be given to a senior
associate dean for undergraduate
studies, a new full-time post, said
John Shoven, dean of the school.
Camarillo applauded Shoven for
making the position a full-time one,
saying that although his position
was half-time in name, it was full
time in reality.
The new senior associate dean
will have new areas of responsibili

ty, including evaluating any recom
mendations of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education that
deal with the school, Shoven said.
The new administrator will also
oversee areas such as the Cultures,
Ideas and Values program and "a
number of the large undergraduate
interdisciplinary programs," he
said.
Shoven said the creation of the
full-time associate dean position at
the school will mean additional
focus on the role of undergraduates
in the humanities and sciences.
Berman, who currently oversees
several academic areas as associate
dean, will work full time on over
seas studies. The academic areas he
supervises as a dean — the Depart
ments of Philosophy, Religious
Studies and Linguistics and the
Ethics in Society and Symbolic Sys
tems programs — will be trans
ferred to the oversight of John
Etchemendy, the senior associate
dean who now oversees humanities.
Shoven said staff support for se
nior associate deans in the school
will increase to help them deal with
their new, additional responsibili
ties.
In some ways, the changes rep
resent a move toward the way
things were done in the past. There
was a full-time undergraduate
studies dean — for the whole Uni
versity, not just H&S — until
about two years ago, said Linguis
tics Prof. Thomas Wasow, the last
university-wide dean for under
graduate studies and chair of the
faculty committee that is helping
Shoven fill the new position.
Berman said the directorship of
overseas studies had always been a
full-time job before he took the
combined overseas studies and
associate dean post.
And shifts within overseas stud
ies toward more student research
and more programs outside West
ern Europe — as well as the fact

that 25 percent to 30 percent of
Stanford students study overseas
— demand more attention from
the program director, Berman
said.
Overseas programs in Moscow,
Santiago and Kyoto have all start
ed in recent years. Bf.rman said he
is now concentrating on the possi
bility of starting a program in
China, and may consider starting a
program somewhere in Africa.
Moving the departments
Berman now oversees under
Etchemendy extends a historical
trend toward "discipline-specific
clusters" of departments, Berman
said. In the "somewhat distant
past" deans used to oversee diverse
departments, he said, and one dean
might oversee art, physics and
sociology, for example.
Former dean of H&S Ewart
Thomas began moving toward the
present, discipline-clustered sys
tem, where there is one senior

associate dean for humanities, one
for social sciences and one for nat
ural sciences, Berman said.
Shoven said he hopes to have a
person picked for the new post by
the end of this quarter. The new
senior associate dean will likely
come from within the University,
he added.
Camarillo said he feels good
about his term as dean. "I feel pret
ty gratified about the things we
were able to do," he said, citing the
establishment of the sophomore
Peters seminars as an example.
Faculty can recommend people
for the post until March 4. After
that, Wasow said, a search com
mittee made up of six faculty
members will evaluate the nomi
nations and suggest candidates to
Shoven, who will pick the new
senior associate dean. Wasow said
he expects that the search commit
tee will be able to do its job "quite
quickly."
