## Camarillo to step down next year; new dean will oversee undergrads 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
The School of Humanities and
Sciences will have a new senior as
sociate dean for undergraduate
studies next academic year, a struc
ture prompted by the job changes of
two associate deans.
A 1 Camarillo, H&S associate
dean and director of undergraduate
studies, will work at the Center for
Advanced Studies in Behavioral
Sciences next academic year and
will finish a book he is working on.
In addition, H&S Associate Dean
and Director of Overseas Studies
Russell Berman will devote all his
time to directing Stanford's over
seas programs beginning in Octo
ber.
Starting next year, Camarillo's
tasks that deal with H&S under
graduates will be given to a senior
associate dean for undergraduate
studies, a new full-time post, said
John Shoven, dean of the school.
Camarillo applauded Shoven for
making the position a full-time one,
saying that although his position
was half-time in name, it was full
time in reality.
The new senior associate dean
will have new areas of responsibili

ty, including evaluating any recom
mendations of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education that
deal with the school, Shoven said.
The new administrator will also
oversee areas such as the Cultures,
Ideas and Values program and "a
number of the large undergraduate
interdisciplinary programs," he
said.
Shoven said the creation of the
full-time associate dean position at
the school will mean additional
focus on the role of undergraduates
in the humanities and sciences.
Berman, who currently oversees
several academic areas as associate
dean, will work full time on over
seas studies. The academic areas he
supervises as a dean — the Depart
ments of Philosophy, Religious
Studies and Linguistics and the
Ethics in Society and Symbolic Sys
tems programs — will be trans
ferred to the oversight of John
Etchemendy, the senior associate
dean who now oversees humanities.
Shoven said staff support for se
nior associate deans in the school
will increase to help them deal with
their new, additional responsibili
ties.
