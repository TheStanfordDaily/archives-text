# Sex assault legal advocacy group gears up
## 
### Gina Lee Staff writer 
Starting next week, students who have been
sexually assaulted will be able to consult a new
student group for legal advice.
The Sexual Assault Legal Advocacy Group,
comprised of 14 law students who are currently
in training, will visit dorms and sororities, deliv
ering 10-minute presentations on what the
group has to offer.
"It's important that Stanford students know
the resources available to them," said second
year law student Isabel Traugott, who is orga
nizing the group. "Not knowing where to get
information is one of the main problems on this
campus."
On Sunday, the eight first-year and six sec
ond-year law students trained for about four
hours, learning about the various resources
available to victims through both the University
and criminal justice systems.
"This program is very, very time intensive,"

said Traugott. "But it's important that training
is comprehensive."
Traugott said there is no set date for the end
of training because the subject matter is so
broad. She said counselors will be engaged in a
sort of "ongoing training."
The counselors have also heard guest speak
ers inform them about how to help victims deal
with sexual crime. For example, Caroline
Mitchell, the former University director of the
Sexual Assault Information and Resource Cen
ter, spoke to the students last week.
Traugott, who wrote a 60-page reference
manual compiling the organization's goals and
techniques, describes the work as very "techni
cal." In training, counselors go through infor
mation contained in the manual "step-by-step."
"I think we have a veiy excited group," said
law student Willow Sanchez, a participant in the
program. "Throughout training we've had a
number of different workshops and experts who
come to speak. The training is a long, ongoing
process that will continue throughout this

month and the next."
Traugott urges students who are raped or
sexually assaulted to call the group to learn
about their options in filing a police report and
arranging for a medical examination. She said all
calls are completely confidential.
In addition, the group will receive referrals
from Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) at Cowell Student Health Center.
Counselors offer support while advising vic
tims about their legal rights, she said. The same
counselor will remain on a specific case from
beginning to end.
Traugott said counselors will not influence
victims' decisions, but will simply provide them
with legal information so they can make the best
decision based on their situation.
The group, currently based in Serra House,
can be reached by calling 725-5431. The 14 stu
dents will rotate shifts every two days.
"We've put so much time and energy into this
effort that it's important that the program is
accessible," Traugott said.
