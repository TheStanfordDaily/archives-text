# Groups lose 39 percent of fee requests to refunds
## Grad students' requests more than double undergrads' 
### Charles Katz Staff writer 
Student groups lost 39 percent of their fee requests
this quarter, causing additional strain on budgets al
ready damaged by the graduate student revolt that cost
them 32 percent of their funding in the fall.
Graduate students requested two and a half times
more money than undergraduates, a carryover from this
fall's Graduate Student Tea Party drive that encour
aged graduate students to get their fee refunds. I lowev
er, this was a decrease from fall quarter when 78 percent
of the refunds were requested by graduate students.
Karen Seta, an organizer of the graduate student re
volt, said that the refund drive was not meant to con
tinue winter quarter. "I think we made our point in fall
quarter," she said.
"No one has tried to court graduate students," said
Seta, a medical student. "If organizations wanted grad
uate students, organizations would go out and get grad
uate students. But I haven't seen it happen."
Student groups submitted their budgets expecting a
refund rate of 25 percent. Therefore, each percentage
point over 25 percent cuts into student groups' funding.

The Publications Board, which was hit especially
hard with the loss of nearly 43 percent of the money it
requested, is trying to gain more campus recognition
in the hope of stopping students from taking their
money back.
"For a long time the Publications Board has been
anonymous," said board dir.xrtor Stephen Russell.
"But I think we're really going to see a comeback by the
end of the year."
Russell said there is a cyclical reason for the growing
number of refunds. "Poorly funded publications are
not published as much and therefore are not as well
known," he said.
In addition, Russell pointed out that publications
can be read by everyone on campus, even the graduate
students who received $4,398 out of the $6,247 re
turned to students this quarter from Publications
Board funds.
The result of the scarcity of money has been "pretty
horrible," according to Russell. "A lot [of groups] who
were counting on support from the Publications Board
didn't get it."
