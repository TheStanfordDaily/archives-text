# Fighting back
## New student group wants to reform education 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
Blaming a "crisis of knowl
edge" within the humanities and
social sciences for the scapegoat

ing of blacks as the cause of social
problems, eight students have
formed a group to fight back.
"Institute N.H.1." is partially
a response to articles in The
Stanford Review that attack

black students, said organiza
tion co-founder Kwame Anku, a
senior. But he also emphasized
that the group will focus on aca
demics rather than politics in at
tempting to fundamentally
change education.
"We want to show the mythol
ogy in which both liberals and
conservatives are entrapped,"
said senior Jason Ambroise, an
other founder, at the group's
press conference Friday. "We are
not calling for a multicultural
curriculum. Knowledge must be
rewritten."
The group plans to co-sponsor
an environmental workshop and
an African and Afro-American
Studies symposium, publish a
journal and act as a clearing
house, Anku said.
"When people have ideas . . .
we will be able to work with them
to construct an action program,"
he added. "It can be campus,
state or nation oriented."
