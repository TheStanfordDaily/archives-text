# Fighting back
## New student group wants to reform education 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
Blaming a "crisis of knowl
edge" within the humanities and
social sciences for the scapegoat

ing of blacks as the cause of social
problems, eight students have
formed a group to fight back.
"Institute N.H.1." is partially
a response to articles in The
Stanford Review that attack

black students, said organiza
tion co-founder Kwame Anku, a
senior. But he also emphasized
that the group will focus on aca
demics rather than politics in at
tempting to fundamentally
change education.
"We want to show the mythol
ogy in which both liberals and
conservatives are entrapped,"
said senior Jason Ambroise, an
other founder, at the group's
press conference Friday. "We are
not calling for a multicultural
curriculum. Knowledge must be
rewritten."
The group plans to co-sponsor
an environmental workshop and
an African and Afro-American
Studies symposium, publish a
journal and act as a clearing
house, Anku said.
"When people have ideas . . .
we will be able to work with them
to construct an action program,"
he added. "It can be campus,
state or nation oriented."

says was widely used within the
city's judicial system to refer to
cases involving breaches of the
rights of young, jobless black males.
Education is currently unac
ceptable if it does not allow col
lege graduates to deal with con
temporary crises, Ambroise said.
"How in the hell can we walk
around calling people N.H.1.?

What type of knowledge do the
disciplines provide such that we
see all these things as just and
legitimate?"
Although "white Americans
have been represented as doing
everything worth doing in histo
ry," Ambroise said, merely adding
multicultural elements to the
existing curriculum will not take
the place of fundamental change.
Anku said recent articles in
The Review — which he believes
singled out black students and
implied that they want to change

the curriculum for the worse —
reflect national attitudes.
Winds of Freedom, a conserva
tive campus organization found
ed last fall, is telling alumni that
"these black students are getting
you to change the curriculum and
the next thing you know you'll be
practicing voodoo," Anku added.
But co-founder Jason Glenn
also emphasized that Institute
N.H.I, is "not interested" in being
pitted against specific publica
tions or individuals. "Our enemy
is the body of knowledge," he said.
