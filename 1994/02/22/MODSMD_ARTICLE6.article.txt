## 
### Diane Chen 
With topics ranging from women in athletics to the
value of housewives, thus year's Women's Herstory Cel
ebration will examine women's roles and achievements.
Organizers officially kicked off the two-and-a-half
week celebration last Friday night, with a concert by
Boston musician Melissa Ferrick at the Coffee House.
Activities will continue through Mar. 8 and encompass
a broad range of topics concerning women's issues both
on campus and throughout the world.
The overall purpose of Women's Herstory Celebra
tion is to "organize activities to draw attention to
women's achievements," said Rebecca Bliss, coordina

tor of the Women's Center and a graduate student in ed
ucation.
Junior Sarah Horsley, a student organizer for the
event, said she feels that one purpose of the celebration
is to "raise awareness about women's issues intersect
ing with race, class and poverty."
Another goal is to "incorporate a wide range of peo
ple, thoughts and perspectives," Bliss added.
In order to reach a broad audience, the Women's
Center has planned events that include performances
by an all-woman band, lectures by various professors
and an open microphone night at Toyon in which any-
and an open microphone night at
Toyon in which anyone is welcome
to speak candidly and sponta
neously about being a woman at
Stanford.
The celebration "brings togeth
er both on-campus and national
figures to talk about women's
issues and raise awareness of dif
ferent struggles of women in the
Stanford community and in the
world," said Michelle Friedland, a
senior who is helping to organize
the event.
This year, the students who
coordinated the celebration chose
not to have a central theme because
they "didn't want to feel limited,"
Bliss said. Discussions will address
both local issues — such as the
sorority system at Stanford — and
global topics, such as the value of
women as housewives.
"There shouldn't have to be a
special women's herstory, but
women's achievements tend not to
get recognized as much in the reg
ular teaching of history," she said.
Friedland said the celebration
— which will last for two and a half
weeks — has expanded from previ
ous years, when it was only a week
long.
However, the celebration has
been affected by recent budget
cuts, Friedland said. Although the
Women's Center helps to pay trav
el costs for speakers coming from
off-campus, and sometimes in
cludes an honorarium, the funds
were limited this year and more on
campus speakers were recruited.
But organizers, who began plan

ning for the event around the mid
dle of fall quarter, say the celebra
tion will be interesting nonethe
less.
Highlights for Women's Hersto
ry Celebration 1994 include a pre
sentation by women's basketball
coach Tara VanDerveer, who will
speak today about gender equality
in athletics. Bliss said the topic of
women in athletics is new this year.
Another new program consists
of a panel of Jewish women speak
ing about their experiences at
Stanford, and in the country. The
presentation tomorrow, co-spon
sored by the Jewish Student Asso
ciation and Hillel, discusses
whether these women "deal with
the same oppressions" as other
women in a multicultural commu
nity, said Bliss.
One of the main speakers
brought in from ofT-campus is Mar
garet Prescod, a black woman from
Los Angeles who co-founded the
International Black Women Wages
for Housework organization. She is
a "radical feminist who places
emphasis on valuing women's
work historically as a mother and
housewife," said Johnson. Prescod
will speak Thursday.
Stanford medical student
Michelle Lin said, "I think it's
great how they can incorporate
generally appealing topics like
sports and music into Herstory
programs. It certainly dispelled my
original impression that these pro
grams were ultrafeminist teach
ings that just put down men."
Women's Herstory Celebration
is the biggest activity sponsored by
the Women's Center, said John
son. Bliss said the celebration prob
ably began between 15 and 20
years ago.
