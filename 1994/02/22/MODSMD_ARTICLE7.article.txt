# Quad, SCBN still working to be placed on ASSU spring ballot
## 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
While the ASSU Senate voted
last week to place all the fee re
quests on the spring ballot, the
work is still not over for at least
two student groups.
The Appropriations Commit
tee reduced the Stanford Quad's
allotment to $0 because of what it
characterized as poor financial
management and record-keeping.
The Quad had requested $12,000

in special fees, which would have
been adjusted to $20,000 to ac
count for fee refunds.
According to Quad treasurer
Aaron Bilstrom, an advertising
firm filed for bankruptcy several
years ago causing a loss of $27,000
to the yearbook. Since then, each
year the Quad has passed that
debt on to the next year.
Graduate senator Edward
Sharp said the appropriations
committee was unwilling to rec
ommend a special fee given the

Quad's financial status.
"They had terrible [financial]
management and terrible record
keeping, and they want to be
bailed out by the students," Sharp
said.
The only way for the Quad to
receive its original budget — or
any budget other than the $0 ap
proved by the Senate — is to col
lect signatures from 20 percent of
the student body, or about 2,800
students.
Bilstrom said the Quad does not
have the manpower to collect the
required number of signatures.
"We're just going to try to get by
as we have" without ASSU funds.
While he agreed with the sen
ate's claim that "financial records
in the past were not complete," he
said "they were a little harsh on
us" in eliminating their fee.
"Obviously the ASSU is mak
ing it difficult to enter" the spe
cial fee system, Bilstrom said.
"Students should be able to judge

for themselves."
Also, even though the senate
approved Stanford Cardinal
Broadcasting Network's request,
it still must collect signatures
from 10 percent of students
because the group failed to garner
the approval of 50 percent of the
voters during last year's election.
SCBN treasurer Mark Shalaby
said the process of collecting sig
natures is "all under control" and
that he is "pretty confident" that
SCBN will be able to gather the
required number.
"I think [our chancesl are
much improved this year. Our
station has changed its format
quite a bit" and has a more expe
rienced staff, Shalaby said.
