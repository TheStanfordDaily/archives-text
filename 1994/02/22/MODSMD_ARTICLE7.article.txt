# Quad, SCBN still working to be placed on ASSU spring ballot

While the ASSU Senate voted
last week to place all the fee re
quests on the spring ballot, the
work is still not over for at least
two student groups.
The Appropriations Commit
tee reduced the Stanford Quad's
allotment to $0 because of what it
characterized as poor financial
management and record-keeping.
The Quad had requested $12,000

in special fees, which would have
been adjusted to $20,000 to ac
count for fee refunds.
According to Quad treasurer
Aaron Bilstrom, an advertising
firm filed for bankruptcy several
years ago causing a loss of $27,000
to the yearbook. Since then, each
year the Quad has passed that
debt on to the next year.
Graduate senator Edward
Sharp said the appropriations
committee was unwilling to rec
ommend a special fee given the

Quad's financial status.
"They had terrible [financial]
management and terrible record
keeping, and they want to be
bailed out by the students," Sharp
said.
The only way for the Quad to
receive its original budget — or
any budget other than the $0 ap
proved by the Senate — is to col
lect signatures from 20 percent of
the student body, or about 2,800
