# Clock tower repairs beginning
## 
### George Chen 
Broken for almost a year, the
clock tower may once again chime
the hours as the University gears
up to mend the building's leaky
belfry.
An examination of the tower
last Friday revealed three minor
floor leaks in the southwestern
corner of the belfry, Facilities spe
cial projects manager Bruce Wig
gins said, caused by bolts whose
eyehole positions had shifted.
A roofing contractor will exam
ine the belfry floor this week to
determine what repairs are need-

Ed, said Wiggins, who suggested
the floor may only need water
proofing at a cost of "a few hun
dred dollars." He also said the gas
kets around the windows will also
be checked for leaks.
Currently, Facilities takes care
of the building in which the clock is
housed while Mechanical Engi
neering Prof. David Beach main
tains the clockworks.
Once the integrity of the clock
tower is established, Wiggins said
the clockworks, which also do not
work, can be fixed.
Water vapor damaged the
clock's transmission, Beach said.

Repairs could cost anywhere
between $1,000 and $10,000.
The clock tower's roof was to be
repaired in conjunction with all the
other roofs on campus that were
damaged in last year's heavy rains.
Money to finance the roof repairs
was recently approved by the
Board of Trustees.
However, Facilities special pro
jects manager Ben Asaro said the
clock tower was not listed in any of
the re-roofing project packets con
tractors may bid on.
"The money will come from a
special fund for outdoor struc
tures," Wiggins said.
