Attend a special preview of the QUALCOMM story at
6:00 PM, March 2, Cypress North
the night before our on-campus interviews.
It's interesting what happens when you give extraordinary people an extraordinary amount
of autonomy and support.
They innovate like crazy. Then their company takes off and grows like very few others have.
Case in point: San Diego's own QUALCOMM. We've gone from 8 employees in 1985 to over
1300 today. That makes us one of America's fastest growing high-tech companies.
It also doesn't hurt to have the company launched by communications visionaries like Dr. Irwin
M. Jacobs and Dr. Andrew J. Viterbi.
The trick, of course, is to keep the entrepreneurial spirit flourishing despite phenomenal
growth. That's why we give our engineers as much freedom and encouragement as possible. This
includes an open door policy company-wide, the latitude to set your own hours, the private space
provided by your own office, and more.
In response, QUALCOMM people have spearheaded many of our industry's most challenging
technologies. Among them are mobile satellite communication networks, dual mode (analog and
CDMA) mobile and portable phones, VLSI products, full-custom ASIC design, low earth orbit
satellites, and more.
We'll throw in the ocean â€”free.
Along with a highly stimulating work environment, you'll also enjoy the Southern California
lifestyle, which features one of America's most temperate climates. And QUALCOMM is less than
a mile from the Pacific Ocean.
