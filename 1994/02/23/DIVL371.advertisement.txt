INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS HONORS PROGRAM
SUMMER RESEARCH GRANT
I D BARBIE FIELDS MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIP
The International Relations Program invites undergraduate students to apply for
the Barbie Fields Memorial Scholarship, to be used to carry on research or intensive
study leading to a senior honors thesis in International Relations.
The Barbie Fields Memorial Scholarship Fund was established by the family and
friends of Barbie Fields, a Stanford student and International Relations major (Class
of 1981) who died in 1984 while traveling in Malaysia.
This scholarship is jointly administered by the International Relations Program and
the Office of Undergraduate Research Opportunities. Applications are available
through URO, 122 Sweet Hall. The deadline for applications is April 1, 1994.

Committee on Academic Appraisal and Achievement
Students are reminded that taking final examinations earlier than the scheduled time
is a privilege, not a right. They should request this privilege only in the event of
extraordinary circumstances.
Since the final examination schedule is published quarterly in the Time Schedule at
the time of course selection and enrollment, students are expected to make their
academic plans in light of known personal circumstances that may make certain
examination times difficult for them.
In general, faculty members are discouraged from giving final examinations earlier
than the published and announced times. If faculty nevertheless decide to administer
early examinations, the questions should either be completely different from those on the
regularly scheduled examination or the early examination should be administered in a
highly controlled setting. An example of such a setting would be a campus seminar room
where the examination questions would be collected along with students' work and
students would be reminded of their Honor Code obligations not to share information
about the examination contents. Giving students easy opportunities to abuse the integrity
of an examination is unfair to honest students and inconsistent with the spirit of the
Honor Code.
Academic fields differ in the degree to which early examination requests present
dilemmas for faculty. If, for example, an examination format consists of a small number of
essay questions, where students would be greatly advantaged by knowing the question
topics, faculty should be especially reluctant to allow early examinations unlesslhey are
willing to offer totally different examinations or a different kind of academic task — e.g.,
a final paper in lieu of an examination.
