# Former top CIA officer charged as spy
## Ames and his wife accused of selling national security secrets to the Kremlin 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a case with Cold
War echoes and implications for future U.S.-
Russia relations, a former top CIA counterin
telligence officer and his wife were charged
yesterday with selling national security
secrets to the Kremlin.
The case, as described in the federal affi
davit for the arrest of Aldrich Hazen Ames
and his wife, has many of the elements of a spy
thriller novel: hand-offs of secret CIA docu
ments at "dead drops;" $1.5 million in alleged
Russian payoffs and FBI agents sifting trash
cans for clues.
President Clinton called the matter "very
serious," and Secretary of State Warren
Christopher summoned Russian diplomat
Vladimir Chkhikvishvili for a formal protest.
The White House was reviewing how the
case might affect relations with Russia at a
time when the United States is strongly sup
porting President Boris Yeltsin and providing
millions of dollars in aid.

The affidavit accuses Ames and his wife of
conspiring to deliver information about secret
CIA operations and of revealing the identity of
Russian officials who were illicitly providing
information to the United States, including a
Russian counterintelligence officer who was
an agent for the CIA.
Ames is accused of being an agent for the
Russian foreign intelligence service, known as
the SVRR, which is the direct successor to the
KGB of the former Soviet Union.
Ames, 52, and his wife, Maria Del Rosario
Casas Ames, 41, of Arlington, Va., appeared
before a federal magistrate in Alexandria, Va.,
yesterday on charges of conspiracy to commit
espionage.
If convicted, each would face a maximum
sentence of life imprisonment and a $250,000
fine.
The couple, who had been arrested Mon
day, were ordered held without bail until a
hearing scheduled for Friday.

The CIA had suspected since 1985 that
there was a "mole" spying for the Russians
inside the agency, and Ames had been under
investigation for two years, according to a law
enforcement official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
Ames and his wife are accused of accepting
more than $1.5 million in payoffs for informa
tion.
The money is alleged to have been laun
dered through numerous bank accounts in
Switzerland and in the United States, "which
he and his wife subsequently used for person
al gain and enjoyment," the affidavit stated.
The government contends that Ames
became involved in 1985 when he was chief of
the Soviet Counterintelligence Branch in the
Soviet-East European Division at CIA.
In his counterintelligence work he was
assigned to recruiting officials and intelligence
officers of the Soviet Union. He also analyzed
the Soviet intelligence services.
