# Cease-fire extended
## New deal applies to other Bosnian cities 
### 
BONN, Germany (AP) —
Diplomats agreed yesterday to
extend the Sarajevo cease-fire
model to other besieged Bosnian
towns, with a crucial difference
insisted on by Moscow: no new
NATO threats, at least for now.
Russia opposed extending the
NATO ultimatum against Serb
gunners around Sarajevo to other
parts of Bosnia, two European
officials said after a meeting
among Russian, U.S. and Euro
pean diplomats.
Still, German Eoreign Minis
ter Klaus Kinkel said further
ultimatums may be needed. And
a U.S. official said Washington
hadn't ruled out force.
Diplomats agreed to push the
three warring factions toward an
overall agreement on dividing up
Bosnia in three ethnic parts,
according to the officials, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
"For now, I would say, we give
peace a chance," said Juergen
Chrobog, a deputy German foreign
minister and host of the meeting.

In a statement, diplomats at the
meeting said they would seek to
improve the humanitarian situa
tion in Serb-besieged Muslim
enclaves and pressure Muslims
and Croats for a cease-fire in cen
tral Bosnia and the southern city of
Mostar.
They insisted the Serbs not
move to other warfronts any of
the artillery removed from
around Sarajevo in compliance
with the NATO ultimatum.
It was clear after yesterday's
talks that Russia, a traditional
ally of the Serbs, had added a new
element to the Bosnia peace
effort. The faded superpower also
won some much-needed respect.
After 22 months in which the
Bosnian Serbs thumbed their
noses at Western demands that
they cease their attacks, it took the
NATO air strike threat to moti
vate the Serbs to remove their big
guns from around Sarajevo.
But the final step of the Serb
withdrawal over the weekend
was negotiated by Russia.
