Cable rates cut
WASHINGTON (AP) - For
the second time in less than a
year, the Federal Communica
tion Commission is ordering
cable companies to cut the
prices they charge for programs
and equipment. The 7 percent
reduction should affect 90 per
cent of America's cable televi
sion subscribers.
The FCC unanimously
approved the new rate cut yester
day, 10 months after ordering a
10 percent rate reduction that
backfired for some consumers,
who complained that their bills
went up.
The new rate cut is expected
to take effect in mid-May.
Though the impact on any indi
vidual bill isn't immediately
known, most consumers can
expect to pay less for cable ser
vice each month because the
reduction covers all channels
except pay-per-view and premi
um services like HBO, Showtime

and Encore.
"If the subscribers look at
what they were buying in
September of 1992, the price will
have gone down one-sixth" when
the new rates go into effect, FCC
Chairman Reed Hundt said in an
interview.
Interest rates to rise
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
short-term interest-rate increase
engineered this month by the
Federal Reserve was in all likeli
hood just a taste of things to
come, central bank chairman
Alan Greenspan told Congress
yesterday.
"History suggests that real
short-term rates are more likely
to have to rise than fall from
here," Greenspan said.
On Feb. 4, the central bank
nudged up the federal funds rate,
the rate charged among banks on
overnight loans, by a quarter of a
percentage point, to 3.25 per
cent.
