## Editorials Stalling arbitration 
### 
Landlords are usually
dreaded and feared. But they
can also be influential when
dealing with matters of their own
turf.
And while Stanford has essential
ly washed its hands of matters on
Webb Ranch — which occupies 237
acres of University land — it may
also be the most qualified, as the
lessee, to help settle the current dis
pute on the ranch.
Right now, the operators of Webb
Ranch and the United Stanford
Workers are in disagreement over
who may live in the trailers on the
ranch. The union has claimed that
the Webbs were illegally denying
housing to Stanford workers by
allowing non-workers to live there.
The Webbs contend that they should
be able to determine who may live in
the trailers, which were originally
intended to replace older trailers
that county health officials deemed
"unfit for human occupancy."

The two parties decided to go to
arbitration over the issue in Novem
ber, but have been unable to secure
an arbitrator who could see them
within seven days of selection,
which is the guideline stated in their
arbitration contract.
So, four months later, the dispute
— which could be settled in about 30
days — is dragging on.
At this point, the University
should step in and give the stagnat
ing talks a much-needed shove in
the right direction — toward quick
resolution. Letting such a dispute
carry on — for what now appears to
be an indefinite amount of time —
reflects poorly on Stanford.
Because ultimately, the Universi
ty is responsible for what takes place
on its land. Even though it has will
ingly relinquished this authority by
setting a policy of non-interference
with Webb Ranch issues, it can
decide to involve itself at any time.
One of those times is now.
