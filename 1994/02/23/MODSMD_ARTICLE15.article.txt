AS WITNESSED by the large
amount of participation in
last fall's "tea party," Stan
ford graduate students generally
are not pleased with the services
and attention they get from the
University. Although one major
complaint — housing — has no
easy fix, Stanford can take steps to
improve graduate student life by
creating a center designed specifi
cally to serve their needs.
The idea is not new. In the 1989
report of the University Committee
on Minority Issues, it was recom
mended that the University estab
lish a center which would be a "focal
point for graduate student life."
However, that suggestion was dis
carded with many others after Stan
ford was hit by budget problems and
the Loma Prieta earthquake.
But the idea of a graduate stu
dent center should be revived. Stan
ford needs a centralized location to
house groups and services oriented
toward graduate students.

The center could offer space and
increased visibility to graduate stu
dent groups, which often have trou
ble raising awareness and garnering
broad support. For example, the
Graduate Student Association was
one of only five student groups that
students rejected in last year's
ASSU special fee election.
The center could also serve as a
"clearinghouse" to disseminate
information that is of interest to all
graduate students and as a general
resource center.
While graduate students may all
have different interests and respon
sibilities, there is still need for the
establishment of a common area.
It would serve to build up a sense
of cohesion and community among
a group of students that often feels
left out of the University loop.
And while finding money for such
a project would be difficult, the
investment would pay off in the long
run by improving graduate student
satisfaction.
