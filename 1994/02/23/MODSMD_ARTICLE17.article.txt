## British political correctness 
### 
SOMETHING STRANGE happens
to you when you grow up as a per
son of color in the Bay Area. In
social settings, I was just used as to being
in the racial "majority" as in the "minor
ity" (in California, a state which is quick
ly approaching a white minority, one
learns to use these terms literally). At
Stanford, political correctness and multi
culturalism were not new and shocking
concepts for me — backlash was.
So it should go without saying that
being in England for the past two
months has been a bit of a culture shock.
I had expected to find English people
much less racially enlightened and cul
turally sensitive -» f and they are — buM
didn't think that their ignorance would
have its merits. I find many of the inter
actions I have or hear of simultaneously
disturbing and refreshing:
• I explain to a London street vendor
that there are many Asian people born in
the States, and yes, they speak perfect
American English.
• I watch as a Japanese-American Stan
ford student tries to explain sushi to an
Oxford student who has asked, "What do
they eat in Japan, seaweed?"
• I listen to other Stanford students
describe how they explained that "orien
tal" was considered an offensive term in
the States to an Oxford race issues pro
fessor who had used it in class.
So while certain aspects of these inci
dents do not sit well with my Bay

Area/Stanford sensibilities, the objectivi
ty that comes with being in a foreign
country allows me to recognize that igno
rance is . . . just ignorance. There is a
certain honesty in British people's
approach toward these issues that seems
to have become unacceptable in the
States. Here, it is okay to say, "I don't
know. Tell me more."
While "What do they eat in Japan,
seaweed?" is a far-from-ideal plea for cul
tural education, I was struck that our
Oxford friend was completely comfort
able in asking as much.
At Stanford, we seem to have adopted
the assumption that everyone must be
multiculturally-literate, and not know
ing equates to cultural insensitivity or
inadequacy.
Somehow, we have given ourselves
the burden of responsibility to know, and
too often, we pretend for fear of appear
ing ignorant. I can sense it in that walk
ing-on-eggshells quality people get in
their voice when they ask me about Chi
nese culture or Asian-American race
issues. By the same token, there are peo
ple who will attack those who do not
know about their race or culture, keep
ing the vicious cycle in motion.
Nevertheless, English people's toler
ance for cultural ignorance is not to be
idealized by any means. It has not taken
me long to realize that England's lack of
race-issue awareness is a product of an
Anglo-white dominated, largely xeno

phobic country, backed by a long tradi
tion of imperialism. Anti-immigration
laws, job discrimination and general neg
ative sentiment, especially toward Eng
land's Indian and West Indian popula
tion, are very real and pervasive prob
lems.
My high school journalism textbook
said you always have to have a solution
to the problems you present at the end of
every opinion piece; unfortunately, I
don't this time. The best I can offer is a
personal anecdote:
After meeting a black British woman,
I was asked to describe her, and, without
thinking, I said she was "African-Ameri
can" — then stopped myself, realizing
my mistake. Often, "more enlightened"
conceptions of race, that we allow our
selves to fall into complacency, and speak
the language of political correctness
without thinking of its original intent.
Compared to England, we have come
along way toward racial awareness — so
long that we must occasionally check
ourselves and challenge our own
assumptions as well as those of the
"ignorant."

Although she has spent more than half a
quarter at Stanford in Oxford, Angle
still speaks perfect American English.
