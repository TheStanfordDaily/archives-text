## Outside agency at fault for yearbook's financial woes 
### 
AS MANAGING editor of the Stan
ford Quad Yearbook, I wish to
clarify some errors in yesterday's
Daily. In an article about spring ballot
funding, the Stanford Quad was report
ed to be requesting money for debt
reduction. Rather, the Quad sees the
request for funds as an effort to keep
down the cost of the book.
Furthermore, in the article, ASSU
senator Edward Sharp asserted that
the financial status of the Quad was
due to "terrible [financial] manage
ment." This is false. The Quad is in
debt because of the bankruptcy of our
ad agency, Anthony Advertising, which
defaulted on a percentage of payments
for a five-year contract. This failure
resulted in tens of thousands of dollars
in unpaid revenue generated for ads

run in yearbooks.
In the past the Quad has been able
to slowly reduce this debt by book sales,
but the burden of our situation has
caused us to consider raising the price
of the book to one equal to production
cost.
The Quad, then, is able to manage
its finances, only not without producing
a book that will be available to all stu
dents at the current price. Currently we
offer the book to students at a price
below production costs in order to make
it available to all students, regardless of
financial background. But, without the
same type of support that The Review
or The Daily receives, we will not be
able to continue to do this.
Furthermore, while the ASSU is ten
tatively refusing us even the chance to

be put on the ballot, the quality and cal
iber of the Quad is at stake. The parents
of Stanford students expect a Quad to
be produced every year. The students
and even the University assume it will
be around â€” yet are not even being
given the chance to support it.
When Anthony Advertising went
bankrupt the business manager at the
Quad consulted the ASSU legal services
about suing the company, but were told
that the court expenses and bankruptcy
return rate (pennies on the dollar)
could actually end up costing the Quad
rather than recapturing lost revenue.
Thus it seems that the ASSU is tak
ing away from the student body the
chance to decide for themselves about
whether they believe the Quad deserves
the kind of funding countless other stu

dent organization are allotted.
While many students opt for funding
organizations they do not directly bene
fit from, most every Stanford graduate
will look back upon his or her yearbook
for decades to come. At the Quad, we
produce the only concise record of the
year's student life, residences, student
groups, seniors and sports. It is unique
in this aspect, however apparently not
unique enough for the ASSU to consid
er worthy of the students opinion.
We therefore urge the Appropria
tions Committee to reconsider our
request, and also urge concerned stu
dents to voice their opinion on this
matter and vote for us if we appear on
the ballot.
