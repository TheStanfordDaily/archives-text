# Tresidder's management will focus on community services, saving money
## 
### 
We write in response to yesterday's
editorial entitled "Improving Tresid
der." We are in agreement that the
Tresidder Memorial Union of the
1990s needs to be different than the
one that has been a part of the Stan
ford landscape for the past 30-plus
years. In a time of streamlining and
redirection of resources, it is particu
larly important that a place like

Tresidder be able to make its own way,
while providing quality services. How
ever, it is important to note that there
is a history and a context in which the
subsidy of Tresidder Union has existed.
To say that Tresidder loses a million
dollars without some explanation pro
vides an unfair assessment of the job
that the management has been asked
to do. For most of its existence, Tresid
der Union has been viewed as a "mixed
auxiliary" and has received a general
funds subsidy from the University in
conscious recognition of the fact that
the non-retail facilities of the union
were dedicated to the support of the

educational mission of the institution.
Historically the subsidy has included
support for meeting rooms, lounge
spaces, ticket operations, information
service, student government and pro
ject office spaces, student activities and
student programming.
In December, Provost Rice outlined
her new expectations for the Union,
which asks Tresidder management to
focus on the development of retail ser
vices and operate as a "pure auxiliary"
and at a minimum, break even finan
cially. Part of this mandate is to
explore ways in which existing and
potentially new services can be self-

sustaining. Tresidder Union manage
ment is in the process of completing
this assessment.
Whether the ultimate decision is to
retain in-house management or con
tract the management, the goal is the
same: to provide the Stanford commu
nity with the best services possible, to
do so at little or no expense to the Uni
versity, and in the process maintain a
community center that is a vital part of
the campus.
