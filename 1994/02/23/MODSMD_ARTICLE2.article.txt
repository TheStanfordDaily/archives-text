# Gender equity?
## Women's basketball coach discusses disparity in college sports 
### Greg Collins Editorial staff 
Although Stanford is considered to be
one of the nation's models of gender equi
ty in athletics, many changes still need to
be made, according to Cardinal women's
basketball coach Tara VanDerveer.
"There is not equity, whether it's at
Stanford or any other university in the
country. [Stanford] is probably as good as
it gets in college athletics," VanDerveer
said. "This is the best place to work, the
best place to be a female athlete to partic
ipate, and it still has a long way to go."
Speaking before a sparse crowd at
Tresidder Union yesterday in the first

program of Women's Herstory Month,
VanDerveer addressed many issues, rang
ing from her own experiences fighting to
play and coach in a man's world to former
USC women's basketball coach Marianne
Stanley's struggles for salary parity be
tween men and women coaches.
The focus of VanDerveer'a speech was
on the success of Title IX, the federal law
which requires that institutions receiving
federal funds meet gender equity stan
dards in areas such as participation in and
funding of athletic programs.
"Title IX should be more strictly en
forced," VanDerveer said. "There should
be a lot more open knowledge about an
Athletic Department — telling the Athlet

ic Departments you have to open your
books and show where you are putting
your money."
With television money becoming the
main economic force in collegiate athlet
ics, she noted that women's sports needs
some measure of exposure to provide role
models for young girls and trigger a
change in the overall mentality of promo
tion and corporate sponsorship.
"We're not in the sports page, we're
not on the news. Our scores are not being
reported, so we have a big battle ahead of
us, and most of it is a promotion battle,"
VanDerveer said.
VanDerveer believes the biggest
battle involving gender equity is
the disparity between men's and
women's coaching salaries.
Citing Stanley's fight against
USC and her belief that she is
worth as much as Trojans' men's
basketball coach George Ravel
ing, VanDerveer called for com
plete openness and honesty in
dealing with Title IX. "Until they
open the books, it's a situation
which is very, very disparate," she
said.
Stanley, a personal friend of
VanDerveer who is now working
in the Cardinal women's basket
ball office as director of promo
tion, rejected a three-year,
$288,000 contract and a one-year
deal for $96,000 in her fight for a
salary equal to Raveling's. His
annual salary, which is undis
closed by USC, has been estimated
at between $110,000 and
$150,000.
In January, a federal appeals

panel refused to reinstate her to
the USC job due to an unresolved
$8 million sex discrimination suit
she had filed against the universi
ty. The court said the men's pro
gram was under a higher pressure
to win because it brought in more
money.
"Why should we feed the boys
steaks and make the girls eat hot
dogs?" questioned VanDerveer.
However, as long as cash cows
like the upcoming NCAA men's
basketball tournament give huge
payments to both the schools and
the advertisers, women's sports
will not receive the type of expo
sure necessary because "the money
is definitely stacked in men's ath
letics," VanDerveer said.
Even when women's athletics
does get exposure in the national
media, such as the large viewing
audience expected for the Olympic
coverage of women's ice skating,
she said she thinks the motivation
is hypocritical.
"CBS is going to make a bundle
off the Kerrigan-Harding situa
tion," she said. "It's almost like
playing off women's stereotypes of
cattiness."
