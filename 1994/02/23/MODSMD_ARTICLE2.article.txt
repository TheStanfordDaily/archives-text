# Gender equity?
## Women's basketball coach discusses disparity in college sports 
### Greg Collins Editorial staff 
Although Stanford is considered to be
one of the nation's models of gender equi
ty in athletics, many changes still need to
be made, according to Cardinal women's
basketball coach Tara VanDerveer.
"There is not equity, whether it's at
Stanford or any other university in the
country. [Stanford] is probably as good as
it gets in college athletics," VanDerveer
said. "This is the best place to work, the
best place to be a female athlete to partic
ipate, and it still has a long way to go."
Speaking before a sparse crowd at
Tresidder Union yesterday in the first

program of Women's Herstory Month,
VanDerveer addressed many issues, rang
ing from her own experiences fighting to
play and coach in a man's world to former
USC women's basketball coach Marianne
Stanley's struggles for salary parity be
tween men and women coaches.
The focus of VanDerveer'a speech was
on the success of Title IX, the federal law
which requires that institutions receiving
federal funds meet gender equity stan
dards in areas such as participation in and
funding of athletic programs.
"Title IX should be more strictly en
forced," VanDerveer said. "There should
be a lot more open knowledge about an
Athletic Department â€” telling the Athlet

ic Departments you have to open your
books and show where you are putting
your money."
With television money becoming the
main economic force in collegiate athlet
ics, she noted that women's sports needs
some measure of exposure to provide role
models for young girls and trigger a
change in the overall mentality of promo
tion and corporate sponsorship.
"We're not in the sports page, we're
not on the news. Our scores are not being
reported, so we have a big battle ahead of
us, and most of it is a promotion battle,"
VanDerveer said.
