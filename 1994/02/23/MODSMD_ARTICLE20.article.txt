## Student group builds hybrid car for contest Vehicle combines high speed and efficiency

Though faculty members often win
awards for ground-breaking research,
student groups make their presence felt
in the research world relatively infre
quently.
But little known to the Stanford com
munity, a group of undergraduate and
graduate students — the Stanford
Hybrid Automobile Research Project —
has embarked upon an ambitious task to
rectify this imbalance, intending to
design the car of the future.
The group got its start as an entrant
in a competition sponsored by the auto
mobile industry to develop a hybrid elec
tric vehicle. Last year Ford donated Ford
Escort station wagons to teams from
universities across the nation, asking
them to develop a car which meets strin
gent emission and performance specifi
cations.
Given a year to work on the technolo
gy, the groups from universities in the
United States and Canada will converge
on the General Motors Proving Grounds
in June to compete against each other.
"This year we intend to win," said pro
ject coordinator Bailey White. "We have
the most technologically advanced
design of all the teams."
Though the primary goal of the con
test was to develop technology for a
hybrid automobile which uses existing
technology to produce a car capable of

satisfying environmental regulations
effectively and cheaply, the group has
also tried to prove that hybrid cars rep
resent the future of automobiles because
they are practical to operate, do not pol
lute the atmosphere and perform well in
city conditions.
Technically, a hybrid electric vehicle
is a car which employs electricity as well
as gasoline, using gasoline to generate
energy from a small engine — usually a
motorcycle engine. The engine serves as
a generator, taking in gasoline and gen
erating electricity.
This electricity, combined with the
power stored in 18 rechargeable nickel
cadmium batteries, powers the motor
which can accelerate the vehicle up to a
top speed of 85 miles per hour. The bat
teries themselves require approximately
four to six hours to recharge.
Depending on the circumstances, the
batteries and generator can be connected
in two different configurations. Connect
ed in series, the motor can run at a regu
lar, uninterrupted pace, allowing it to
recharge the batteries as they are deplet
ed by driving. A parallel configuration
creates a higher peak output but at a less
constant rate because the engine can
work alongside the batteries to power
the vehicle.
Because the engine and batteries are
both available as power sources the car
can operate for long durations of time.
Present estimates place the car's range

at 900 miles when carrying a standard
13-gallon fuel tank — about 69 miles per
gallon.
In order to accomplish this feat, the
hybrid car can function as an electric car
for the first 60 miles of a trip (the normal
range of an electric car) and then switch
on the generator to replenish the batter
ies.
Since its primary power source is elec
tricity, the car will contribute minimally
to pollution — most journeys are less
than 60 miles anyway.
In its prototype, the Stanford group
has incorporated revolutionary concepts,
including regenerative braking in order

to reduce energy waste and generate
electricity.
Through this technology, instead of
losing energy to friction in the case of
conventional brakes, braking actually
recharges the batteries because the car's
energy of motion is converted to electric
ity by using the electric motor as an
alternator.
Hybrid electric technology is current
ly under investigation because of its
immense potential for amelioration of
the energy problem and because the elec
tricity used to recharge the batteries is
relatively cheap.
In addition, since most cars would be

recharged during the night, power compa
nies might no longer waste electricity
every night because it is cheaper than
shutting down and restarting the plant
every day.
At present the Stanford group is
involved in preparations for a competi
tion it plans to attend in Phoenix over
spring break — the first competition of
the year for the car.
The group is a completely student-run
project overseen by Mechanical Engi
neering Prof. Reginald Mitchell, and
includes both graduate students and
undergraduates from a variety of disci
plines.
