# Technique may make transfusions easier
## Protein research yields new ways to prevent rejection of donor blood 
### Julie Sauer Staff writer 
Researchers at the Stanford
Blood Center are working to
increase the pool of potential blood
donors by studying the proteins
that cause incompatibility between
patient and donor blood.
The human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) is one of the proteins that
occurs on nearly all human cells,
including platelets — a component
of blood. A blood transfusion intro
duces donor platelets that carry
HLA proteins that may cause an
immune response in the patient.
HLA proteins are part of the
body's immune system. As Debra
Hiraki, a research associate at the
center, explained, "I think of the
immune system as the internal
defense system, and all the cells in
the immune system are going
around checking everything in
your body to see if it belongs there
or not."
The HLA proteins on the recipi
ent's platelets may recognize a dif
ferent HLA pattern on the trans
fused platelets and identify them as
foreign substances. When this hap
pens, the patient's immune system
produces antibodies to attack for
eign HLA and destroy those
platelets. HLA proteins of the
donor may not need to match per
fectly those of the recipient for the
first transfusion, but need to be
close.
With each successive transfu
sion, however, the patient develops
sensitivities to additional HLA pro
teins. Hiraki described the difficul
ty this creates for patients needing
multiple transfusions. "Once you
get somebody who is sensitized to
so many HLA [proteins], eventual
ly the only thing you can give them
is a transfusion that is matched
exactly for them."
Finding donors whose platelet
proteins exactly match those of the
patient causes problems, since
there are many possible HLA com

binations.
Three genes code for the HLA
on platelets, producing A, Band C
HLA. An individual has two copies
of the gene for each type. The gene
combination creates the HLA pro
tein pattern on the person's cell
surfaces.
There are 30 currently recog
nized A proteins, 50 B proteins
and 10 C proteins. The vast num
ber of possible patterns hinders
the matching of donor and recipi
ent platelets. The team of
researchers, directed by Carl
Grumet, is trying to facilitate the
matching process and thus
increase the donor pool.
According to Hiraki, the goal is
to make the patient's body recog
nize certain common HLA pro
teins as part of the body itself.
"When you have a case where the
immune system tolerates a pro
tein that it would normally
respond to, you have induced a
state of tolerance."
If the patient were tolerant to
some common HLA proteins,
matching platelets would be an
easier task and more people could
be eligible donors.
HLA occurs on cell surfaces,
much like proteins on red blood
cells. The HLA proteins all consist
of one large protein and an associ
ated smaller protein. The smaller
proteins are the same in all HLA. It
is the larger protein that deter
mines the HLA identity.
The large HLA protein on the
platelets has a tail inside the cell,
anchoring the protein in the cell
membrane, and an identifying
region displayed on the cell surface.
Non-matching proteins on the
donor cell surface can aggregate
and cause immune response in the
patient's body, but similar proteins
not attached to cells may not
induce as much of an immune
response and are more easily toler
ated.
To induce tolerance, researchers
want to make a soluble form of the

HLA protein — essentially the
same protein with its "tail" cut off
so it has no anchor into the cell.
This form could be given to the
patient and would effectively turn
the immune response off, allowing
the patient's body to tolerate donor
platelet HLA.
In order to create this soluble
protein, the DNA which encodes
HLA proteins can be cloned, cut
and incorporated into the DNA of
tissue culture cells. The cells treat
the new DNA as their own and
start producing soluble HLA pro
tein.
The soluble protein is harvested
and purified. It is then adminis
tered to mice to determine how it
affects the immune system
response.
All mice receive cells with the
attached HLA protein — which
should induce a response — while
some mice also are given the solu
ble protein.
The mice receiving both pro
duced fewer antibodies than those
without the soluble protein. This
means the mice immune systems

responded less to the attached for
eign protein if the mice had
received the soluble form of the
protein.
Hiraki described the possible
benefit of these studies to human
transfusion patients. She said that,
theoretically, patients could be
treated with the soluble protein
and become tolerant to it. They
could then receive transfusions
from donors with exactly matching
HLA and from donors whose HLA
includes the type that the patient
now tolerates.
Successful research results
would increase the pool of eligible
donors. The HLA project at the
Stanford Blood Center has contin
ued for nearly 10 years and is cur
rently directed by Grumet and
supervised by Debra Hiraki and
Shalini Krishnaswamy.
The research will require more
time before it achieves results that
can be tested on human transfu
sion patients. It is funded by the
National Institute for Health as
part of a Specialized Center on
Transfusion Medicine.

(HLA) is one of the proteins that
occurs on nearly all human cells,
including platelets — a component
of blood. A blood transfusion intro
duces donor platelets that carry
HLA proteins that may cause an
immune response in the patient.
HLA proteins are part of the
body's immune system. As Debra
Hiraki, a research associate at the
center, explained, "I think of the
immune system as the internal
defense system, and all the cells in
the immune system are going
around checking everything in
your body to see if it belongs there
or not."
The HLA proteins on the recipi
ent's platelets may recognize a dif
ferent HLA pattern on the trans
fused platelets and identify them as
foreign substances. When this hap
pens, the patient's immune system
produces antibodies to attack for
eign HLA and destroy those
platelets. HLA proteins of the
donor may not need to match per
fectly those of the recipient for the
first transfusion, but need to be
close.
With each successive transfu
sion, however, the patient develops
sensitivities to additional HLA pro
teins. Hiraki described the difficul
ty this creates for patients needing
multiple transfusions. "Once you
get somebody who is sensitized to
so many HLA [proteins], eventual
ly the only thing you can give them
is a transfusion that is matched
exactly for them."
Finding donors whose platelet
proteins exactly match those of the
patient causes problems, since
there are many possible HLA com

binations.
Three genes code for the HLA
on platelets, producing A, Band C
HLA. An individual has two copies
of the gene for each type. The gene
combination creates the HLA pro
tein pattern on the person's cell
surfaces.
There are 30 currently recog
nized A proteins, 50 B proteins
and 10 C proteins. The vast num
ber of possible patterns hinders
the matching of donor and recipi
ent platelets. The team of
researchers, directed by Carl
Grumet, is trying to facilitate the
matching process and thus
increase the donor pool.
According to Hiraki, the goal is
to make the patient's body recog
nize certain common HLA pro
teins as part of the body itself.
"When you have a case where the
immune system tolerates a pro
tein that it would normally
respond to, you have induced a
state of tolerance."
If the patient were tolerant to
some common HLA proteins,
matching platelets would be an
easier task and more people could
be eligible donors.
HLA occurs on cell surfaces,
much like proteins on red blood
cells. The HLA proteins all consist
of one large protein and an associ
ated smaller protein. The smaller
proteins are the same in all HLA. It
is the larger protein that deter
mines the HLA identity.
The large HLA protein on the
platelets has a tail inside the cell,
anchoring the protein in the cell
membrane, and an identifying
region displayed on the cell surface.
Non-matching proteins on the
donor cell surface can aggregate
and cause immune response in the
patient's body, but similar proteins
not attached to cells may not
induce as much of an immune
response and are more easily toler
ated.
To induce tolerance, researchers
want to make a soluble form of the

HLA protein — essentially the
same protein with its "tail" cut off
so it has no anchor into the cell.
This form could be given to the
patient and would effectively turn
the immune response off, allowing
the patient's body to tolerate donor
platelet HLA.
In order to create this soluble
protein, the DNA which encodes
HLA proteins can be cloned, cut
and incorporated into the DNA of
tissue culture cells. The cells treat
the new DNA as their own and
start producing soluble HLA pro
tein.
The soluble protein is harvested
and purified. It is then adminis
tered to mice to determine how it
affects the immune system
response.
All mice receive cells with the
attached HLA protein — which
should induce a response — while
some mice also are given the solu
ble protein.
The mice receiving both pro
duced fewer antibodies than those
without the soluble protein. This
means the mice immune systems

responded less to the attached for
eign protein if the mice had
received the soluble form of the
protein.
Hiraki described the possible
benefit of these studies to human
transfusion patients. She said that,
theoretically, patients could be
treated with the soluble protein
and become tolerant to it. They
could then receive transfusions
from donors with exactly matching
HLA and from donors whose HLA
includes the type that the patient
now tolerates.
Successful research results
would increase the pool of eligible
donors. The HLA project at the
Stanford Blood Center has contin
ued for nearly 10 years and is cur
rently directed by Grumet and
supervised by Debra Hiraki and
Shalini Krishnaswamy.
The research will require more
time before it achieves results that
can be tested on human transfu
sion patients. It is funded by the
National Institute for Health as
part of a Specialized Center on
Transfusion Medicine.
