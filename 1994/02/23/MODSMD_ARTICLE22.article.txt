# Aging research creates hope amid realities
## Prof explains the physical and psychological repercussions of getting old

People often see growing old as
a process whose changes will alter
their lifestyles irrevocably.
But according to Javaid Sheikh,
an associate professor of psychia
try who is studying the psycholog
ical and physiological effects of
aging, although people can expect
to undergo significant changes,
the human mind and body remain
in many respects the same as they
grow older.
"In general, people tend to have
the same kinds of attributes and
personality traits as they go
through life," Sheikh said, explain
ing that people's basic characteris
tics tend to follow them as they
age.

"That may or may not be a good
thing," he added.
Despite his initially positive
outlook, he said it is important to
understand the fundamental
physical and mental changes that
come about with age. "It's ripe
time that people understand these
factors," Sheikh said.
In describing the process of
becoming older, he employed two
basic categories — primary and
secondary aging — which both
contribute to biological aging
though they stem from different
sources.
Primary aging is "independent
of stress, trauma or acquired dis
ease," he said, adding that such
changes generally affect nearly all
people during their lives.
On the other hand, secondary

aging is more insidious — brought
on by such external factors as
cigarette smoking and chronic
stress. According to Sheikh, these
additional agents "can significantly
speed the process of growing old."
Analysis of demographics also
provides clues about the nature of
aging. For example, by the age of
85, females are more than twice as
likely to be alive as males. In addi
tion, the number of casual friend
ships generally declines.
Sheikh said such statistics can
account for psychological stresses
which lead older people to com
plain of nervousness and anxiety.
"Psychological changes are
often compounded by environmen
tal factors," he said, though he
admitted that related physical and
biological problems also play a role.

Because aging is known to
cause a decline in a person's mus
cular strength, reaction time and a
host of other processes, Sheikh
said it is often difficult to separate
external problems from those
which are purely psychological in
origin.
"There are many possibilities
for outward manifestations of anx
iety," he said. Though his research
has centered around sorting out
the wide variety of indicators
involved in measuring psychologi
cal change in old age, he admitted
there are still many unknowns.
"To a large degree, these factors
vary from person to person," he
said, adding that by understand
ing the difficulties facing them,
older people can live very success
ful and fulfilled lives.
