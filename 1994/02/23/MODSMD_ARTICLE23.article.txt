## Booze is unlikely to quench thirst 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
Q:I can never seem to drink
enough on Friday nights,
as when I wake up on Saturday
morning, I'm still thirsty. How
can this be?
A: I'm going to go out on a
limb here and assume that
even though you are affiliated
with Stanford, your drink of
choice on Friday nights is not
Clearly Canadian™.
If I can safely guess that you
drown your self-pitying
thoughts about the celibate,
monastic grind that fills your
week-daily life (i.e. the typical
Stanford existence) with
alcohol, then I might be able to
offer some constructive advice.
The naive, inadequate
answer to your question is that if
you spend your Friday nights
like the rest of us, you are hung
over on Saturday mornings, and
thirst is one of the symptoms of
a hangover. Being a member of
the Stanford community, how
ever, you doubtless have a pene
trating and demanding intellect,
and this brief response will
prove unsatisfying.
To satisfy your inquiring
mind, I had to pull out my dusty
physiology textbook and do a lit
tle reading on the subject of
human endocrinology. It turns
out that the association of alco
hol intake with thirst (and the
symptoms of hangovers in gen
eral) is the result of alcohol's
negative effect on the release of a
single hormone, the so-called
antidiuretic hormone (ADH).
ADH is a neuropeptide
released by the pituitary gland, a
tiny but significant endocrine
gland located on the brain's
underbelly. The pituitary is
quite a star of the mammalian
endocrine system, releasing at
various times in its professional
career some nine different hor
mones. This breadth of expertise
has impressed some physiolo
gists enough that they call the
pituitary the "master gland."
Since the pituitary itself is under
the control of a section of the
brain called the hypothalamus,
however, I prefer not to dignify
it with such a title.
Regardless of what you call it,
the pituitary unquestionably
releases ADH, in greater or less
er amounts, depending on the
water balance of the individual.
Antidiuretic hormone earns

its name by preventing diuresis,
which is what you call urination
after you finish your first year of
medical school. Its primary
physiological action is to
increase the permeability of the
collecting ducts of the kidney,
thereby decreasing the amount
of water leaving the blood to
become urine.
Release of ADH is promoted
by two closely related factors:
low blood volume and high plas
ma osmolality. ("Osmolarity,"
by the way, is just a high-falutin'
word for the summed concentra
tions of everything the blood
happens to be carrying — sugars,
salts, proteins, etc. When body
water levels go down, osmolarity
goes up.) This makes sense:
when the water content of the
blood is too low, there's no point
in losing still more water to the
urine.
But ADH secretion is down
regulated by ingestion of
ethanol, the active ingredient in
piria coladas. The inhibitory
effect of alcohol on ADH results
in a great deal of water leaving
the bloodstream for the bladder
— hence the old saying, "You
don't buy beer, you just rent it."
When you drink alcohol,
then, ADH levels go down, you
urinate copiously, and your net
intake of fluids is no match for
your net output. Consequently,
you feel dehydrated and thirsty
in the morning. Dehydration is
responsible for most of the other
symptoms of a hangover — mus
cle fatigue, soreness and
headaches — as well.
You claim in your question
that "no matter how much" you
drink, you still feel thirsty. Well,
if you're drinking alcoholic bev
erages with the intention of pre
venting or quelling thirst, there's
your problem. If you're drinking
water in large volumes before
turning in, though, I'm not sure
why you still feel thirsty.
One possibility is that the
water you drink while intoxicated
is just flushed right through you
and doesn't really serve to replen
ish what you've already lost.
Assuming that such is the
case, my advice to you is to wait
until well after your last drink —
say, until you no longer feel like
urinating every fifteen minutes
— to begin restocking your
water reserves.
