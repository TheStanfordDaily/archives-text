## 'Golden' Cardinal legacy Three senior swimmers gear up for final NCAA run 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
In 1990, Stanford men's swim
ming coach Skip Kenney struck
gold. After winning a ninth consec
utive Pacific 10 Conference title
and finishing third at NCAAs, Ken
ney hit recruiting paydirt, signing
an incredible class of elite swim
mers to join his Cardinal squad.
Assembling athletes from
around the country, Kenney knew
there were great things to come.
Three of this year's seniors, Tyler
May field, Derek Weatherford and
Trip Zedlitz, comprise a major
force behind the Cardinal's drive
toward a third consecutive national
championship.
Throughout their four years
together at Stanford, the Class of
'94 has not disappointed. As fresh
men, the class experienced a rocky
dual meet season, posting a record
of 2-6 before winning Pac-lOs and
grabbing a runner-up finish at
NCAAs.
Since that time, this year's
seniors have enjoyed near perfec
tion: 23-1 in dual competition, two
Pac-10 titles and two national
championship rings.

"When we were seniors in high
school, we were talking to each
other on the phone, getting excited

about putting our class together,"
said Mayfield, who hails from Las
Vegas. "We knew we could be one
of the greatest classes in history.
There were eight of us and no one
has fallen off, everyone has contin
ued to improve."
Zedlitz, an Oklahoma City,
Okla. native, agreed. "If you step
back and look, it's amazing," he
said. "Coming in, if we would have
told you individual goals, it would
have been an incredible list. We've
been able to do a lot of great
things."
A large part of that motivation
comes from Kenney, who is consid
ered the best in the business at cre
ating a team atmosphere in what
seems to be an individual sport. "I
attribute a lot of my success to
Skip," said Weatherford, who hails
from Ft. Myers, Fla. "He's the
greatest motivator I've ever heard.
I've learned a lot about myself as
an athlete and a person. I'd never
trade the experience."
Over their collegiate careers, the
trio has provided the team with
more than just championship
hardware. Zedlitz, Stanford's co
captain along with fellow senior
Bob Eastlack, is aware of the
importance of the team concept to
the Cardinal.
"I try to show the younger guys

what it takes to have success in the
water and out of the water as well,"
Zedlitz said. "I deal with personali
ty problems, getting them out in
the open and out of the way so the
team can function as a cohesive
unit."
Kenney also acknowledged the
crucial role these three seniors
play. "They are all team guys, they
care a lot about the team," he said.
"They bust their tails in workout
and are not afraid to tell other peo
ple when they aren't working
hard."
Despite their diverse experi
ences and geographical back
grounds, Mayfield, Weatherford
and Zedlitz share many of the keys
to success. "Obviously, they're all
talented," Kenney said. "They are
very dedicated away from the pool
and in the pool, which makes a big
difference in college athletics.
"They are also very open to
changes in stroke and training.
They process information and try
and experience new things. When
they came here they were already
good, but they've gotten better."
Along the way, each Cardinal
star has attained particular goals
that they set for themselves. May
field, the defending NCAA champi
on in the 100-yard breaststroke,
has achieved just about all that he
set out to do four years ago. "From
an NCAA perspective, I have," he
said. "We've won two team titles. I
wanted an individual title and I've
done that. We've also broken
American records on relays."
But there remains one mark
that Mayfield has his eyes on. "One
goal left that's still open is my
dream of chasing the American
record. The 100-breast record is
the oldest in the books. NCAAs will
be my last chance at getting it. It'll
be like a last hurrah."
Weatherford, who specializes in
the 100 and 200 backstrokes also
has his sights set on the national
record book. Those records are cur
rently held by ex-Cardinal team
mate JefT Rouse. After setting a
deGuerre Pool record in the 200
back earlier in the season, Weath
erford is looking forward to the
upcoming championship meets.

"My swims in November were a
little surprising to me," he said.
"I'm excited to shave for the con
ference meet for the first time in
my four years. I'm looking to go
under a sort of magical barrier,
1:40, which would basically be the
American record. I want to give
myself as many chances as I can."
Weatherford won both back
stroke events at last year's Pac-10
meet and went on to win the 100
back crown at NCAAs. This year
his goals are just as high. "I'd like
to see the team win all five relays,
and I'd like to win from one to
three individual events," he said.
While Mayfield and Weather
ford have each captured an individ
ual title, this goal still remains for
Zedlitz, who posted top three fin
ishes in the 100 butterfly (second),
200 individual medley (second) and
the 100 back (third) at the 1993
NCAA meet. Although he was the
team's top individual scorer in that
meet, he will be looking to rise to
the top of the victory podium this
year's championships in Min
neapolis.
"There are many individual
goals that I've met, and some I

haven't," Zedlitz said. "I'd love to
win an NCAA title and hopefully
that will happen this year. I also
have time goals, and I've been
training with those goals in mind."
The three seniors, who teamed
up with Joe Hudepohl to win the
400 medley relay at last year's
NCAAs, also share bigger goals —
goals that will allow them to

remain teammates after their
Stanford careers are over.
All three plan to continue their
training, focusing on the World
Championships in Rome this sum
mer and the 1996 Olympic Games
in Atlanta.

Tyler Mayfield displays his championship breaststroke form. The
senior will be out to defend his 1993 NCAA title in his final season.
Mayfield, Weatherford and
Zedlitz as the coach of the U.S.
Pan Pacific team last summer,
has high hopes for the future.
"Traveling internationally
with them was just a joy," he
said.
"They have lots of interna
tional swimming ahead of
them."
While Kenney did not volun
teer to serve as head coach of
the World Championship team,
he can still be placed on the
team, based on the performance
of his swimmers at the team
selection meet.
"We talk about the potential
to land about 10 or 11 guys
(from the current and recent
squads) on the Olympic team in
*96," Zedlitz said.
"That would be half the
team. That would be if every

thing goes perfectly, but we
want to shoot for attaining the
ultimate potential."
Both May field and Weather
ford are veterans of two
Olympic Trials, and will be
ready for a third chance. "A lot
hinges on this summer," Weath
erford said. "But I think I'll be
ready."
For now, the Pac-10 Champi
onships and NCAA finals lie
ahead, and this trio will be out
to set the pool on fire. When
their final races are swum, their
legacy will set an impressive
standard for future Cardinal
teams.
"These guys will have been a
major part of Stanford history,"
Kenney said. "It will be a long
time until a team can compare
itself to these guys."

While Mayfield and Weather
ford have each captured an individ
ual title, this goal still remains for
Zedlitz, who posted top three fin
ishes in the 100 butterfly (second),
200 individual medley (second) and
the 100 back (third) at the 1993
NCAA meet. Although he was the
team's top individual scorer in that
meet, he will be looking to rise to
the top of the victory podium this
year's championships in Min
neapolis.
"There are many individual
goals that I've met, and some I

haven't," Zedlitz said. "I'd love to
win an NCAA title and hopefully
that will happen this year. I also
have time goals, and I've been
training with those goals in mind."
The three seniors, who teamed
up with Joe Hudepohl to win the
400 medley relay at last year's
NCAAs, also share bigger goals —
goals that will allow them to

remain teammates after their
Stanford careers are over.
All three plan to continue their
training, focusing on the World
Championships in Rome this sum

in Atlanta.

Tyler Mayfield displays his championship breaststroke form. The
senior will be out to defend his 1993 NCAA title in his final season.
Mayfield, Weatherford and
Zedlitz as the coach of the U.S.
Pan Pacific team last summer,
has high hopes for the future.
"Traveling internationally
with them was just a joy," he
said.
"They have lots of interna
tional swimming ahead of
them."
While Kenney did not volun
teer to serve as head coach of
the World Championship team,
he can still be placed on the
team, based on the performance
of his swimmers at the team
selection meet.
"We talk about the potential
to land about 10 or 11 guys
(from the current and recent
squads) on the Olympic team in
*96," Zedlitz said.
"That would be half the
team. That would be if every

thing goes perfectly, but we
want to shoot for attaining the
ultimate potential."
Both May field and Weather
ford are veterans of two
Olympic Trials, and will be
ready for a third chance. "A lot
hinges on this summer," Weath
erford said. "But I think I'll be
ready."
For now, the Pac-10 Champi
onships and NCAA finals lie
ahead, and this trio will be out
to set the pool on fire. When
their final races are swum, their
legacy will set an impressive
standard for future Cardinal
teams.
"These guys will have been a
major part of Stanford history,"
Kenney said. "It will be a long
time until a team can compare
itself to these guys."
Tyler Mayfield, Derek Weath
erford and Trip Zeditz have led
the Class of '94 to the fulfill
ment of the expectations that
formed four years ago — they've
proved to be as good as gold.
In 1990, Stanford men's swim
ming coach Skip Kenney struck
gold. After winning a ninth consec
utive Pacific 10 Conference title
and finishing third at NCAAs, Ken
ney hit recruiting paydirt, signing
an incredible class of elite swim
mers to join his Cardinal squad.
Assembling athletes from
around the country, Kenney knew
there were great things to come.
Three of this year's seniors, Tyler
May field, Derek Weatherford and
Trip Zedlitz, comprise a major
force behind the Cardinal's drive
toward a third consecutive national
championship.
Throughout their four years
together at Stanford, the Class of
'94 has not disappointed. As fresh
men, the class experienced a rocky
dual meet season, posting a record
of 2-6 before winning Pac-lOs and
grabbing a runner-up finish at
NCAAs.
Since that time, this year's
seniors have enjoyed near perfec
tion: 23-1 in dual competition, two
Pac-10 titles and two national
championship rings.

"When we were seniors in high
school, we were talking to each
other on the phone, getting excited

about putting our class together,"
said Mayfield, who hails from Las
Vegas. "We knew we could be one
of the greatest classes in history.
There were eight of us and no one
has fallen off, everyone has contin
ued to improve."
Zedlitz, an Oklahoma City,
Okla. native, agreed. "If you step
back and look, it's amazing," he
said. "Coming in, if we would have
told you individual goals, it would
have been an incredible list. We've
been able to do a lot of great
things."
A large part of that motivation
comes from Kenney, who is consid
ered the best in the business at cre
ating a team atmosphere in what
seems to be an individual sport. "I
attribute a lot of my success to
Skip," said Weatherford, who hails
from Ft. Myers, Fla. "He's the
greatest motivator I've ever heard.
I've learned a lot about myself as
an athlete and a person. I'd never
trade the experience."
Over their collegiate careers, the
trio has provided the team with
more than just championship
hardware. Zedlitz, Stanford's co
captain along with fellow senior
Bob Eastlack, is aware of the
importance of the team concept to
the Cardinal.
"I try to show the younger guys

what it takes to have success in the
water and out of the water as well,"
Zedlitz said. "I deal with personali
ty problems, getting them out in
the open and out of the way so the
team can function as a cohesive
unit."
Kenney also acknowledged the
crucial role these three seniors
play. "They are all team guys, they
care a lot about the team," he said.
"They bust their tails in workout
and are not afraid to tell other peo
ple when they aren't working
hard."
Despite their diverse experi
ences and geographical back
grounds, Mayfield, Weatherford
and Zedlitz share many of the keys
to success. "Obviously, they're all
talented," Kenney said. "They are
very dedicated away from the pool
and in the pool, which makes a big
difference in college athletics.
"They are also very open to
changes in stroke and training.
They process information and try
and experience new things. When
they came here they were already
good, but they've gotten better."
Along the way, each Cardinal
star has attained particular goals
that they set for themselves. May
field, the defending NCAA champi
on in the 100-yard breaststroke,
has achieved just about all that he
set out to do four years ago. "From
an NCAA perspective, I have," he
said. "We've won two team titles. I
wanted an individual title and I've
done that. We've also broken
American records on relays."
But there remains one mark
that Mayfield has his eyes on. "One
goal left that's still open is my
dream of chasing the American
record. The 100-breast record is
the oldest in the books. NCAAs will
be my last chance at getting it. It'll
be like a last hurrah."
Weatherford, who specializes in
the 100 and 200 backstrokes also
has his sights set on the national
record book. Those records are cur
rently held by ex-Cardinal team
mate JefT Rouse. After setting a
deGuerre Pool record in the 200
back earlier in the season, Weath
erford is looking forward to the
upcoming championship meets.

"My swims in November were a
little surprising to me," he said.
"I'm excited to shave for the con
ference meet for the first time in
my four years. I'm looking to go
under a sort of magical barrier,
1:40, which would basically be the
American record. I want to give
myself as many chances as I can."
Weatherford won both back
stroke events at last year's Pac-10
meet and went on to win the 100
back crown at NCAAs. This year
his goals are just as high. "I'd like
to see the team win all five relays,
and I'd like to win from one to
three individual events," he said.
While Mayfield and Weather
ford have each captured an individ
ual title, this goal still remains for
Zedlitz, who posted top three fin
ishes in the 100 butterfly (second),
200 individual medley (second) and
the 100 back (third) at the 1993
NCAA meet. Although he was the
team's top individual scorer in that
meet, he will be looking to rise to
