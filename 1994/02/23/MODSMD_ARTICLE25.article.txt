leading into the final round, finished five strokes shy of Ari
zona State with a three-day total of 855.
Begay's solid performance in all three rounds earned him
the individual title with a 10-under par 206. Begay surpassed
Arizona State's Cade Stone Monday to win by two strokes.

In November, Begay captured the Golf World/Palmetto
Dunes Collegiate Open title in Hilton Head, S.C. with a
school record 14-under-par total. When the nation's top 18
teams competed in Hilton Head, Begay led the Cardinal to a
third-place finish.
With this weekend's win amongst equally stiff competi
