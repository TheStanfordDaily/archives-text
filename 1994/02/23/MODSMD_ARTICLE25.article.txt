# Linksters take second in Hawaii
## 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
Stanford men's golf coach Wally Goodwin was worried
that his team would come out slowly in the opening rounds of
last weekend's Big Island Invitational in Hilo, Hawaii. Obvi
ously, there's no need for Goodwin to fret.
After a three-month hiatus, the Cardinal linksters opened
their spring season with two impressive rounds at the
Waikoloa Kings Golf Course behind junior Notah Begay's
championship performance. Ironically, an usually mediocre
final round allowed Arizona State to overtake Stanford and
the No. 3-ranked Cardinal was forced to settle for a second
place finish.
"Being so high up there in the rankings is a new experi
ence for us," said Goodwin before the team left for Hawaii.
"I'm worried that we'll come out a little sluggish in the first
few rounds and I'm just hoping we can turn it on late."
The Stanford linksters, however, led the 27-team field

with scores of 283 find 278 on Saturday and Sunday, respec
tively, before firing a sub-par 294 on Monday. The Cardinal,
leading into the final round, finished five strokes shy of Ari
zona State with a three-day total of 855.
Begay's solid performance in all three rounds earned him
the individual title with a 10-under par 206. Begay surpassed
Arizona State's Cade Stone Monday to win by two strokes.
The victory for the former All-American was his second
straight title this year, both in competition with the nation's
best collegiate golfers.
In November, Begay captured the Golf World/Palmetto
Dunes Collegiate Open title in Hilton Head, S.C. with a
school record 14-under-par total. When the nation's top 18
teams competed in Hilton Head, Begay led the Cardinal to a
third-place finish.
With this weekend's win amongst equally stiff competi
tion, Begay firmly established himself as one of the nation's
top collegiate golfers. Next fall,
however, Begay will be challenged
by a fellow Cardinal as golf phe
nom Tiger Woods will begin his
Stanford career. Many feel that
with a one-two punch of Begay and
Woods, Stanford will be the odds
on favorite to win a national cham
pionship in 1995.
But Begay doesn't think he has
to wait until next year to make a
run for a national title.
"What we need to do is focus on
what we have in front of us," Begay
said. "I think we have as good a
chance of anyone in the NCAAs this
spring."
In addition to Begay's strong
weekend showing, William Yanigi
sawa, a junior transfer from Uni
versity of California at Irvine, fin
ished in seventh place over the
weekend despite a five-over-par
third round. Ail-American junior

Casey Martin also contributed to
the Cardinal's outcome, finishing
11th of 119 competitors.
Due to an NCAA regulation
which forbids coaches to have con
tact with their players during the
off-season, Stanford first practiced
as a team on Feb. 6. Goodwin felt
the long ofT-season would make it
difficult for his team to begin spring
competition.
"Personally, I'm not in agree
ment with the NCAA on this one,"
Goodwin said. "We go through a
hectic fall and the off-season is real
ly the only time we can work with
the kids without the pressure of
tournaments. Golf is a team sport
and we're going to be at a disadvan
tage because we haven't been
together for so long."
Apparent ly the time off did little
to alter the confidence of the Cardi
nal who will put its ranking on the
line again today. The team will com
pete in the John F. Burns Invita
tional in Kanoehe, Hawaii through
Friday before returning to Stanford
this Sunday.
