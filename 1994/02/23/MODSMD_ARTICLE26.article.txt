## Tennis hammers UCSB

bara head women's tennis coach Chris Rus
sell was pleased with his team's play yes
terday."I felt good with our performance,"
he said.
The fact that he could be pleased after
his squad got pasted 9-0 at the Stanford
Tennis Stadium is a testament to the qual
ity of tennis the No. 2 Cardinal is playing
presently.
A stronger testament was given by head
coach Frank Brennan on his 10-0 team.
"We're in that mode where we start to feel
really pleased with ourselves. . . . We have
the makings of a good team. It's coming
together nicely."

In a dual meet marked by its length and
cold temperatures, the Stanford lineup was
close to flawless. At No. 1 singles, Laxmi
Poruri continued her dominance with a 6-
2, 6-1 dismantling of Jean Okada. Poruri
remains undefeated this season in both sin
gles and doubles, where she teamed with
freshman Katie Schlukebir to smother
Okada and Kathy Peterson 6-1, 6-2.
Schlukebir rebounded from her first loss
of the season Sunday against California to
tromp Laura Rutledge 6-1,6-1 at No. 3 sin
gles. One notch down the lineup, sopho
more Beth Berris continued her trend of
dominating the first set, then losing some
concentration in the second before coming
back to win. Against Peterson (her Gaucho
opponent), Berris played to form,
winning 6-2, 7-5.
As usual, the Nos. 5 and 6 sin
gles players for Stanford were
flawless. Undefeated so far, both
senior Emma Woodhouse and
freshman Sandra De Silva "have
been rocks all season," according
to Stanford assistant coach Lele
Forood. They were both granite
tough again yesterday, with
Woodhouse defeating Kelly
Spencer 6-1, 6-3 and De Silva
beating Amelia White 6-3, 6-2.
The No. 2 singles match was a
dog fight. Stanford senior Kris
tine Kurth fell behind in the first
set 5-4 to Gaucho junior Lynn
Coakley, but behind consistent
groundstrokes, she took the next
two games to win 7-5. The second
set proceeded somewhat like the
first, but this time Kurth was
unable to complete the come
back, losing 7-6 in a tiebreaker.
But she found her game in time
for the third set, which she dom
inated over the hard-hitting
Gaucho 6-3.
"She's notoriously a slow
starter," Brennan said of his All-
American. "Kristine was very
fiat the first four games. . . . The
good news about that match is
Kristine finished strong."
Kurth paired with Berris to
record another strong showing at
No. 2 doubles. The duo spanked
the UCSB team of Spencer/White
6-0 in the first set. The second

set tune was entirely different,
however, as the UCSB pair
jumped out to a 3-0 lead.
"We stopped playing basic ten
nis," Berris said. "We started try
ing to do too much and made
stupid errors."
Staying within themselves,
the two Cardinal players battled
back to finally win the match 7-5.
Credit for the longest match of
the night goes to the Stanford
doubles team of Woodhouse and
freshman Emily Burt at No. 3
doubles. After winning the first
set 6-3, the two proceeded to
drop the second set 6-4 to the
UCSB team of Rutledge/Coakley.
The third set went to a tiebreak
er, with the Cardinal finally pre
vailing 7-6 (8-6) after fighting off
a match point.
"I think it's a confidence
thing," Brennan said. "I yelled at
them a little bit and got them
more antsy at the net and that
was good, so now I know they
need that [type of encourage
ment]."
In related news, coach Bren
nan was inducted into the North
ern California Tennis Hall of
Fame on Saturday night, joining
Stanford men's tennis coach
Dick Gould, who was inducted
last year. In garnering a 334-36
record over his 14 years at Stan
ford, Brennan's squads have won
eight NCAA team titles, seven
NCAA singles titles and four
NCAA doubles titles. He was
named the NCAA Coach of the
Decade three years ago as part of
the NCAA 1980's All Decade
Team.
