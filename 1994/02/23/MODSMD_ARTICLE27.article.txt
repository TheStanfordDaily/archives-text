# Offense power boosts baseball past UOP
## Allen and Hansen spearhead Cardinal's 18 hit effort, Arizona next on deck 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
Offensive slump? What offen
sive slump? The Stanford base
ball team returned home from its
weekend series in Hawaii to light
up the scoreboard at Sunken Dia
mond yesterday, smashing out 18
hits in a 14-4 shellacking of the
University of the Pacific.
With the victory, the Cardinal
improved to 10-6 overall, as it
heads into a huge Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division
matchup against Arizona State
Friday.
Every player in the Stanford
starting lineup had at least one
hit, as Stanford jumped on the
scoreboard early, scoring four
runs in the bottom of the first
inning off Pacific starter Bill Beck
(0-1).
The scoring was keyed by a
leadofT double by third baseman
Brian Dallimore and a two-run
double by first baseman Dusty
Allen.
The Tigers were simply unable
to keep up with the Cardinal's
run-scoring extravaganza.
"I think we've done a much
better job in the last three games
offensively, but we're going to
need to continue to improve, and
get everybody swinging the bat
well," said Stanford coach Mark
Marquess. "It was good for us,

but we've got a lot of work to do
yet."
Allen led the charge with a
three-for-three performance,
including two doubles, three runs
scored, and three RBIs.

much better job in
the last three games

going to need to con
tinue to improve, and
get everybody swing
ing the bat well.'

"I was feeling really comfort
able at the plate," Allen said.
"The ball was coming in there,
and I happened to put a few good
swings on some balls."
Cardinal second baseman Jed
Hansen continues to swing a hot
bat, and yesterday was no excep
tion as he picked up three hits in
four at-bats. In his past 6 games,
the junior has hit well over .500,
with two home runs and 13 RBI.
"We wanted to carry some

momentum going into the Six-
Pac," Hansen said. "We really
accomplished that today."
Allen partly attributes the
revival of the Cardinal offense to
a team meeting held after last Fri
day's 6-3 loss to the Rainbows in
Honolulu, in which the Cardinal
could only muster four hits.
"It all came down to the fact
that we just didn't have the right
attitude [at the plate]," Allen
said. "Jed (Hansen! and I specifi
cally talked about having a little
bit of arrogance at the plate, or
just knowing that you're going to
beat the pitcher. I think that
helped us. We're playing much
better now, and we've got a lot of
confidence going into this week
end."
Stanford used five different
pitchers to shut down Pacific
starting with sophomore left
hander Mike Robbins (1-1) who
pitched only two innings. He was
followed by righthanders Ben
Rada, J.D. Brammer, Cliff Kali
nowski, and Tom Reimers. In all,
the Cardinal hurlers surrendered
four runs on seven hits.
"We've got a lot of good arms
and we're not afraid to go to
them," Marquess said. "We try to
use everyone that we can."
Stanford will carry the
momentum of this victory into its
Six-Pac opener on Friday against
defending conference champion

Arizona State. Last season, the
Sun Devils won five of their six
meetings with the Cardinal en
route to a 46-20 overall record
and an NCAA Midwest Regional
berth.
"They're a great team, they're
coming off a great season, and
they have a lot of returning play
ers, but I'll put our team up
against anyone right now," Allen
said "We're swinging hot bats,
and our pitching staff is doing a
good job. We can't ask for much
more than that."

up the scoreboard at Sunken Dia
mond yesterday, smashing out 18
hits in a 14-4 shellacking of the
University of the Pacific.
With the victory, the Cardinal
improved to 10-6 overall, as it
heads into a huge Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division
matchup against Arizona State
Friday.
Every player in the Stanford
starting lineup had at least one
hit, as Stanford jumped on the
scoreboard early, scoring four
runs in the bottom of the first
inning off Pacific starter Bill Beck
(0-1).
The scoring was keyed by a
leadofT double by third baseman
Brian Dallimore and a two-run
double by first baseman Dusty
Allen.
The Tigers were simply unable
to keep up with the Cardinal's
run-scoring extravaganza.
"I think we've done a much
better job in the last three games
offensively, but we're going to
need to continue to improve, and
get everybody swinging the bat
well," said Stanford coach Mark
Marquess. "It was good for us,

but we've got a lot of work to do
yet."
Allen led the charge with a
three-for-three performance,
including two doubles, three runs
scored, and three RBIs.

ing the bat well.'

"I was feeling really comfort
able at the plate," Allen said.
"The ball was coming in there,
and I happened to put a few good
swings on some balls."
Cardinal second baseman Jed
Hansen continues to swing a hot
bat, and yesterday was no excep
tion as he picked up three hits in
four at-bats. In his past 6 games,
the junior has hit well over .500,
with two home runs and 13 RBI.
"We wanted to carry some

momentum going into the Six-
Pac," Hansen said. "We really
accomplished that today."
Allen partly attributes the
revival of the Cardinal offense to
a team meeting held after last Fri
day's 6-3 loss to the Rainbows in
Honolulu, in which the Cardinal
could only muster four hits.
"It all came down to the fact
that we just didn't have the right
attitude [at the plate]," Allen
said. "Jed (Hansen! and I specifi
cally talked about having a little
bit of arrogance at the plate, or
just knowing that you're going to
beat the pitcher. I think that
helped us. We're playing much
better now, and we've got a lot of
confidence going into this week
end."
Stanford used five different
pitchers to shut down Pacific
starting with sophomore left
hander Mike Robbins (1-1) who
pitched only two innings. He was
followed by righthanders Ben
Rada, J.D. Brammer, Cliff Kali
nowski, and Tom Reimers. In all,
the Cardinal hurlers surrendered
four runs on seven hits.
"We've got a lot of good arms
and we're not afraid to go to
them," Marquess said. "We try to
use everyone that we can."
Stanford will carry the
momentum of this victory into its
Six-Pac opener on Friday against
defending conference champion

Arizona State. Last season, the
Sun Devils won five of their six
meetings with the Cardinal en
route to a 46-20 overall record
and an NCAA Midwest Regional
berth.
"They're a great team, they're
coming off a great season, and
they have a lot of returning play
ers, but I'll put our team up
against anyone right now," Allen
said "We're swinging hot bats,
and our pitching staff is doing a
good job. We can't ask for much
more than that."

Junior Dusty Allen looks for the toss at first base In the Cardinal's
win over Pacific yesterday.
Offensive slump? What offen
sive slump? The Stanford base
ball team returned home from its
weekend series in Hawaii to light
up the scoreboard at Sunken Dia
