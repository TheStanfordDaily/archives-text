## Coyle hopes for Lillehammer medal 
### Randy Reback Staff writer 
Although speed skater John
Coyle (Class of '90) is currently
competing in the Olympics for
the first time, he is no stranger
to the rinks of Norway. His
most memorable Scandinavian
performance was when he
skated in his underwear during
a major international competi
tion.
"John is very flamboyant,"
said Perry Friedman, his best
friend since they took fresh
man English together at Stan
ford.
However, Coyle's flashy
skating has only followed many
hours of rigorous training.
While at Stanford, Coyle spent
much of his time skating at a
rink in Redwood City. During
practices he sometimes shared
the ice with former world
champion figure skater Debbie
Thomas (Class of '89). Coyle
also stayed active as a member
of the cycling team and a mel
lophone player for the Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Band.
Since graduating, Coyle has
skated full time, quickly
emerging as one of the fastest
short-track skaters in the
world. His spot on the world
team and his Olympic training
have led the skater to Mar
quette, Michigan and Lake
Placid, New York.
During the pre-Olympic tri
als, which took place in
Europe last November, Coyle
placed second in 500- and
1,000-meter races, and helped
the U.S. team win the 5,000-
meter relay.
In January, Coyle qualified
to participate in the Winter
Olympics in all three short

track events. While Coyle did
not win a medal in the 1,000-
meter race in Lillehammer yes
terday, he still has a chance to
make his mark in his two other
events, which will take place
Thursday and Saturday.
Coyle's prospects look
bright in both these competi
tions. According to Sports
Illustrated, the U.S. relay team
has a chance at a medal, and
the skater also has an outside
shot at penetrating the top
three in the 500-meter race.
Short-track skating made
its first appearance in the
Olympics in 1992. While long
track events take place on a
400-meter oval, short-track
events are skated on a 111-
meter oval. In addition, short
track skaters race directly
against each other on the ice.
Coyle, who excels at short
distances, has benefited from
the emergence of short-track
skating. In fact, he holds the
world record time for one lap.
While Coyle is definitely
serious about his speed skating
endeavors, reporters have had
little trouble exposing Coyle's
colorful side. USA Today quot
ed Coyle stating that the best
part of being at the Olympics is
the "Norwegian women," and
the worst part is that there
"aren't any Taco Bells."
When reporters asked ath
letes what they would do with
their medal if they won, most
of them replied that they
would give it to their mother or
another close family member.
Coyle quipped that he would
"sell it to the highest bidder."
While he may not come
away from the Olympics sport
ing a medal to sell, hopefully
he'll keep his pants on during
these races.
