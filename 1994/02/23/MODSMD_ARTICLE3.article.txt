A quick-thinking student was able to
stop a convicted thief from burglarizing the
Keck Science Building this weekend.
Rene Hernandez, a 23-year-old man
from Redwood City with prior convictions
of theft, was arrested for burglary and pos
session of stolen property late Sunday
night. There was also an outstanding war
rant for his arrest for previous bike thefts
at Stanford, according to Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Police were tipped off by a Stanford stu
dent who was working in the building at
about 11 p.m. The student noticed someone
rummaging through a desk in a nearby of
fice and immediately called the police,
Niemeyer said.
Deputy Bob Henderson was the last of
four officers who arrived at the building.

When Henderson pulled up in his car, he
noticed Hernandez walking quickly away
from the building. The description given by
the student matched Hernandez.
Henderson ordered Hernandez to stop
where he was. "He looked at me and bolt
ed," Henderson said.
After a brief pursuit on foot, Hernandez
turned to confront the deputy. "I drew my
baton and ordered him to sit down," Hen
derson said.
After a second warning, Hernandez fol
lowed the command and was immediately
handcuffed. "(Hernandez] decided discre
tion was the better part of valor," Niemey
er said.
Police questioning revealed that Her
nandez gained access to the building by
waiting outside for someone with a key,
Henderson said. He told passers-by that he
was meeting his friend "Jose" to
help with janitorial work.
After Hernandez was let in the
building by a passing student, he
searched for unlocked doors,
Henderson said.
Hernandez took a leather jack
et containing a wallet from the

first unlocked office he found,
and he was on his way to the sec
ond floor when police were called,
Henderson said.
Hernandez was also found
with several other allegedly
stolen items, including a Joe
Montana M.V.P. football, a set of
earphones, a pair of gloves and a
wallet. He was also carrying a
plastic bag containing a sand
wich, orange and potato chips,
Henderson said.
