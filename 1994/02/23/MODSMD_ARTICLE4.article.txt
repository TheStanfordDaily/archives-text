# Studying salamanders
## Bio student researches endangered campus creatures 
### Nina Wasow 
Soyou thought you had heard the last of
the California tiger salamanders?
Think again. After spending the sum
mer interning with Stanford's Center for
Conservation Biology, junior Ted Lee is in
the midst of a new project to study the pop
ulation of these amphibians.
As part of the internship, Lee, a biology
major, reviewed scientific literature and
conducted field studies in order to "take an
inventory of species that are known or sus
pected to be on campus, now or historically.
You never know what may be creeping
around," he said.

His results featured the history, geo
graphical range, legal status and physical
description of various potentially endan
gered animals, including the burrowing
owl, the California horned lizard and the
Foothill yellow-legged frog.
CCB researcher Dr. Allen Launer, who
acted as Lee's advisor this summer, said
Lee's report will act as a working reference
draft. "It will be used as a source book— it
can't be used to make planning decisions,"
he said. When the University considers
areas for construction development or stu
dent activities — such as the Big Game bon-
fire in Lake Lagunita — the
report may be consulted for infor
mation on species they would
endanger by abusing their habi
tats.
As a result of his work during
the summer, Lee became interest
ed in studying the tiger salaman
der. He embarked on his own
research project, funded by the
CCB, studying the area of a wall
along Junipero Serra in Septem
ber. He has been out a few nights
each week since then, looking at
the number of salamanders in
this heavy traffic area.
"Yeah, I'm the guy who's
always out there peeking in a wall
on rainy nights with my flash
light. People stop and ask me
about it all the time," he said.
Lee explained that the sala
manders live in the burrows of
other animals during the dry sea
son, and migrate into bodies of
water to breed in the wet season.
Thus, not only do areas like Lake
Lagunita need to be protected,
but also the salamanders' sum
mer homes, such as Alpine Ridge.
The objective of his current
project is to learn more about the
history and migration patterns of
the salamanders, and to use that
information to find ways of con
serving the species at Stanford.

"The long term goal is to find out
how important the Junipero
Serra area is to this population as
a whole," said Lee.
Lee went on to say that the
University has been "very helpful
and interested — they've taken a
pro-active stance in terms of mak

ing sure they're aware of species
at Stanford."
Lee's summer internship was
sponsored by the University Plan
ning office and the James Cash
Penney fund. "Ted was the most
promising one to respond to our
ad," Launer said.

Assoc. Director of the Plan
ning Office Judy Chan said the
office funded the internships for
practical reasons. "We were actu
ally hoping to get a product out of
it, to enable us to understand a
little about campus species," she
said.
