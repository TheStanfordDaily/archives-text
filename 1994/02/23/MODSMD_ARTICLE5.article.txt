# Women's needs study ignored, many claim
## Students frustrated at University's slow response 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Campus women's leaders are expressing
frustration with a perceived lack of Universi
ty action on a report issued over a year ago
that called for improvement of the quality of
female students' lives at Stanford.
However, they admit that budget cuts
and a general decline in interest may impede
efforts to press further for implementation
of the report's findings.
The report, titled the Women's Needs As
sessment Report, was the result of a study
conducted by the Women's Needs Assess
ment Study Group, a committee formed by
former Dean of Student Affairs Jim Lyons in
1989.
Released in the fall of 1992, the report
contains 12 recommendations, including
that the University establish a Committee
on the Status of Women and create a full
time position for an assistant dean to serve
as director of the Women's Center.
But women's leaders and members of the
study group contend that the administration

has largely ignored the report's recommen
dations.
Last month, participants in a Women's
Center forum on budget cuts raised concerns
about the status of the report and the ad
ministration's commitment to it. Yet few de
finitive answers were given at that meeting,
leaving many women still skeptical.
"I feel that if the University was going to
seriously look at the Women's Needs Assess
ment Report, they would have thought about
implementing some of the recommendations
within a year of its release," said Coordinator
of the Women's Center Rebecca Bliss, a doc
toral student in the School of Education.
"It's a little disappointing when you put a
lot of effort into something and you don't see
the results," added Rosalind Pierson, a doc
toral student in communication and mem
ber of the study group.
Diana Akiyama, the chair of the commit
tee and the associate dean of Memorial
Church, said the group's assumption had
been that the Office of Student Affairs would
be responsible for taking whatever
actions it saw fit based upon the
report.
"The assumption was that [the
report] would inform the Office of
Student Affairs about the quality
of life for female students," Akiya
ma said.
"All of the committee members
hoped that the recommendations
would be used," Pierson said.
Last February, Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson convened a
committee to discuss the report's
findings. Bliss said the group met
once, and that further inquiries by
the Women's Center Advisory
Board failed to accrue more infor
mation on the report's status.
Jackson, when questioned yes
terday about the report, said it was
"old news" and refused to discuss
it any further. Neither Vice

Provost for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds nor Provost Condoleezza
Rice returned phone calls yester
day.
To conduct the study, the group
— which consisted of 18 staff
members and students — brain
stormed about issues affecting
female students and also examined
similar studies at other universi
ties to decide on a format and what
issues to address.
About 120 female students
participated in "focus groups,"
which were discussions conduct
ed in residences and graduate
schools. The participants identi
fied problems that they have
encountered as females at Stan
ford. The issues of sexual harass
ment, safety on campus and class
room environment were found to
be of particular concern.
The study group used the find
ings from the focus groups to for
mulate the recommendations in
the report, which included imple
menting "training for faculty and

teaching assistants to enhance sen
sitivity to issues of sexism in the
classroom."
Akiyama said that if she had to
choose one specific recommenda
tion to be implemented, it would be
this one because "it affects the
most number of female students."
Akiyama attributed the lack of
administrative response to "a com
bination of things." The reorgani
zation of the Office of Student
Affairs, a new provost unfamiliar
with the report and various budget
cuts are all reasons why nothing
has been done, she said.
Meanwhile, members of the
study group and other women's
leaders expressed their disappoint
ment at the absence of discussion
of the report.
Calling the lack of response to
the report "frustrating," Bliss said,
"I would appreciate the University
admitting that they're not able to
address the recommendations at
this time.... I sort of feel like
we're in purgatory."

"What was the point of creating
this report if it's falling on deaf
ears?" she asked. "Why did the
committee spend all this time and
energy to pull together this docu
ment?"
But she admitted that students,
too, may be distracted from press
ing for implementation.
"At this point, there are so
many other things going on, like
budget cuts and the policy on unac
ceptable sexual conduct, that
there's no indication that by press
ing, there would be any result," she
said. "So we just keep dredging it
up, reminding people about it."
Others were more optimistic
that the administration will even
tually take steps to implement the
report's recommendations.
"The recent budget cuts and
restructuring has taken precedence
over a lot of other issues," Pierson
said. "I can't say [the administra
tors] are never going to get to it, but
until they resolve some of these
other issues, it will take time."

tors] are never going to get to it, but
until they resolve some of these
other issues, it will take time."
Campus women's leaders are expressing
frustration with a perceived lack of Universi
ty action on a report issued over a year ago
that called for improvement of the quality of
female students' lives at Stanford.
However, they admit that budget cuts
and a general decline in interest may impede
efforts to press further for implementation
of the report's findings.
The report, titled the Women's Needs As
sessment Report, was the result of a study
conducted by the Women's Needs Assess
ment Study Group, a committee formed by
former Dean of Student Affairs Jim Lyons in
1989.
Released in the fall of 1992, the report
contains 12 recommendations, including
that the University establish a Committee
on the Status of Women and create a full
time position for an assistant dean to serve
as director of the Women's Center.
But women's leaders and members of the
study group contend that the administration

has largely ignored the report's recommen
dations.
Last month, participants in a Women's
Center forum on budget cuts raised concerns
about the status of the report and the ad
ministration's commitment to it. Yet few de
finitive answers were given at that meeting,
leaving many women still skeptical.
"I feel that if the University was going to
seriously look at the Women's Needs Assess
ment Report, they would have thought about
implementing some of the recommendations
within a year of its release," said Coordinator
of the Women's Center Rebecca Bliss, a doc
toral student in the School of Education.
"It's a little disappointing when you put a
lot of effort into something and you don't see
the results," added Rosalind Pierson, a doc
toral student in communication and mem
ber of the study group.
Diana Akiyama, the chair of the commit
tee and the associate dean of Memorial
Church, said the group's assumption had
been that the Office of Student Affairs would
be responsible for taking whatever
actions it saw fit based upon the
report.
"The assumption was that [the
report] would inform the Office of
Student Affairs about the quality
of life for female students," Akiya
ma said.
"All of the committee members
hoped that the recommendations
would be used," Pierson said.
Last February, Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson convened a
committee to discuss the report's
findings. Bliss said the group met
once, and that further inquiries by
the Women's Center Advisory
Board failed to accrue more infor
mation on the report's status.
Jackson, when questioned yes
terday about the report, said it was
"old news" and refused to discuss
it any further. Neither Vice

Provost for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds nor Provost Condoleezza
Rice returned phone calls yester
day.
To conduct the study, the group
— which consisted of 18 staff
members and students — brain
stormed about issues affecting
female students and also examined
similar studies at other universi
ties to decide on a format and what
issues to address.
About 120 female students
participated in "focus groups,"
which were discussions conduct
ed in residences and graduate
schools. The participants identi
fied problems that they have
encountered as females at Stan
ford. The issues of sexual harass
ment, safety on campus and class
room environment were found to
be of particular concern.
The study group used the find
ings from the focus groups to for
mulate the recommendations in
the report, which included imple
menting "training for faculty and

teaching assistants to enhance sen
sitivity to issues of sexism in the
classroom."
Akiyama said that if she had to
choose one specific recommenda
tion to be implemented, it would be
this one because "it affects the
most number of female students."
Akiyama attributed the lack of
administrative response to "a com
bination of things." The reorgani
zation of the Office of Student
Affairs, a new provost unfamiliar
with the report and various budget
cuts are all reasons why nothing
has been done, she said.
Meanwhile, members of the
study group and other women's
leaders expressed their disappoint
ment at the absence of discussion
of the report.
Calling the lack of response to
the report "frustrating," Bliss said,
"I would appreciate the University
admitting that they're not able to
address the recommendations at
this time.... I sort of feel like
we're in purgatory."

"What was the point of creating
this report if it's falling on deaf
ears?" she asked. "Why did the
committee spend all this time and
energy to pull together this docu
ment?"
But she admitted that students,
too, may be distracted from press
ing for implementation.
"At this point, there are so
many other things going on, like
budget cuts and the policy on unac
ceptable sexual conduct, that
there's no indication that by press
ing, there would be any result," she
said. "So we just keep dredging it
up, reminding people about it."
Others were more optimistic
that the administration will even
tually take steps to implement the
report's recommendations.
"The recent budget cuts and
restructuring has taken precedence
over a lot of other issues," Pierson
said. "I can't say [the administra
tors] are never going to get to it, but
until they resolve some of these
other issues, it will take time."
