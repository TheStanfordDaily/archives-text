# Casper to eliminate the Office of Public Affairs
## 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Senior staff writer 
As part of an ongoing effort to restructure
the administration, University President
Gerhard C&sper will dissolve the Office of
Public Affairs and split its duties between
two senior administrators.
Director of News and Publications Terry
Shepard, who is in charge of the University's
News Service, will become director of univer
sity communications. Larry Horton, cur
rently the director of government relations,
will oversee Public Affairs' community and
government relations work.
According to sources close to the office, Di
rector of Public Affairs Richard Kurovsky's
job will be eliminated.
Under the reorganization, Shepard will
continue to oversee News Service and Stan
ford Publication Services, but his duties will
be expanded to handling media relations and
public communications. Shepard, who will
report, directly to Casper, will also serve as a

senior adviser to the presi
dent and Provost Con
doleezza Rice.
The move caps a two-year
process to revamp the Pub
lic Affairs Office. When
Casper became president
in September 1992, the of
fice was stripped of its vice
presidential status and Bob
Freelen, then-vice presi-

dent for Public Affairs, was asked to leave.
After Freelen left in March 1993, the of
fice's work was divided among several ad
ministrators, including Shepard, Horton,
Kurovsky and Assistant to the President
Jean Fetter.
"But the office's functions didn't go
away," Fetter said. "It wasn't easy for us to
do it all."
As a result, a committee consisting of Fet
ter, Shepard and Assoc. Vice President of


Shepard
Development Steven Peeps recom
mended the change, which will
eliminate two jobs — Kurovsky's
and that of Mary Bartlett, an asso
ciate director for public affairs who
had previously planned to move to
Los Angeles.
Kurovsky, who could not be
reached for comment yesterday,
has been at Stanford since 1982.
He has previously worked as the
director of university relations in
the Public Affairs Office and as the

director of the Office of Public
Information at the Graduate
School of Business.
Fetter stressed that the move,
while part of the University's bud
get-cutting process, was intended
to improve the office's efficiency
and effectiveness. Public Affairs
staff positions will be consolidated
either under Shepard or Horton,
she said.
About half the office's work
involved community relations, and
that task will now be handled by
Horton, whose title will become
director of government and com
munity relations. Horton refused
to comment on the reorganization

last night.
Some of the office's previous
duties that directly related to the
president or provost, such as travel
arrangements and answering cor
respondence, will be handled by
Fetter.
University officials are still
"fine-tuning" the reorganization
plan, which likely will not be for
mally implemented for a couple of
months, Fetter said.
Shepard said that while he and
Horton will try to absorb as much
of the office's duties as possible,
there will be some tasks that will
no longer be performed. He
declined to specify what those

functions may be.
"The conclusion was that it was
clearly logical to take some of the
things Public Affairs was doing
and attach them to people doing
similar things," Shepard said. "But
that doesn't mean all of the office's
roles will be continued. .. . We will
need to set some priorities."
Shepard said the University will
begin a search for a new director of
news and publications in the near
future. In the interim, he said he
will oversee the department.
Fetter said the change should
help allay the fears of those who
see Campus Report — which is
produced by the News Service — as

being too closely tied to the presi
dent.
"For those who have been criti
cal about the perceived lack of inde
pendence of Campus Report, the
News Service director will now be
further removed from the Office of
the President and Provost," she
said.
The reorganization, which was
announced to a handful of staff
members yesterday, received a
lukewarm response.
"In the long run, the new office
should be doing the same stuff,"
said an individual close to the Pub
lic Affairs Office who refused to be
identified. "Sometimes you need a

shake-up and a bit of a reorganiza
tion."
Shepard has been News Service
director since April 1991. Prior to
that he was deputy associate chan
cellor for public affairs at the Uni
versity of Illinois at Urbana-Cham
paign.
Fetter said the Office of the
President and Provost, which has
140 staff members and 16 bud
getary units, is currently looking at
ways to restructure some of its
other operations as well, although
no formal plans have been devel
oped for other areas.
"It's a very complex situation,"
she said. "It will take some time."
