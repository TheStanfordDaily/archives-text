### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Senior staff writer 
As part of an ongoing effort to restructure
the administration, University President
Gerhard C&sper will dissolve the Office of
Public Affairs and split its duties between
two senior administrators.
Director of News and Publications Terry
Shepard, who is in charge of the University's
News Service, will become director of univer
sity communications. Larry Horton, cur
rently the director of government relations,
will oversee Public Affairs' community and
government relations work.
According to sources close to the office, Di
rector of Public Affairs Richard Kurovsky's
job will be eliminated.
Under the reorganization, Shepard will
continue to oversee News Service and Stan
ford Publication Services, but his duties will
be expanded to handling media relations and
public communications. Shepard, who will
report, directly to Casper, will also serve as a

senior adviser to the presi
dent and Provost Con
doleezza Rice.
The move caps a two-year
process to revamp the Pub
lic Affairs Office. When
Casper became president
in September 1992, the of
fice was stripped of its vice
presidential status and Bob
Freelen, then-vice presi-

dent for Public Affairs, was asked to leave.
After Freelen left in March 1993, the of
fice's work was divided among several ad
ministrators, including Shepard, Horton,
Kurovsky and Assistant to the President
Jean Fetter.
"But the office's functions didn't go
away," Fetter said. "It wasn't easy for us to
do it all."
As a result, a committee consisting of Fet
ter, Shepard and Assoc. Vice President of


Shepard
