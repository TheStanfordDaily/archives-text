# Dickson prepares for new challenges
## New multicultural director plans evaluation of affirmative action 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Attending a predominately-white col
lege, teaching criminal law to female
prisoners, and acting as resident fellow
for a theme house are just a few of the ex
periences that Sally Dickson will draw on
when she assumes the directorship of the
Office of Multicultural Development on
March 21.
For Dickson, issues of race, gender
and class have been life-long concerns,
beginning back in her college days when
she was one of the few black students at
the City University of New York, where
she majored in political science.
"I've always wondered about what are
the influences in society that shape peo
ple's behavior," said Dickson, currently
the associate dean for student affairs at
the Law School, addingthat jus a child she
once wanted to be a psychiatrist.
"I've always been really concerned
with the plight of poor people, especially
African-Americans," she said. "I entered
law because it is one of the ways that
changes could occur ... |It 1 could be
used as an agent for social change." Dick
son, a native of Queens in New York City,
earned her law degree at Rutgers Uni
versity in New Jersey.
Dickson spent her summers during
law school working for the American
Civil Liberties Union, including teaching
criminal law to women in a New Jersey
prison under the tutelage of then-Rut
gers professor, now-Supreme Court Jus
tice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
As Dickson prepares to assume her
new posit ion, she is busily making plans
about what she wants to accomplish as
head of the office, where she will be re
sponsible for monitoring the Universi
ty's hiring and promotion of African-

American, Asian-American, Chi
cano/Latino, Native-American, female
and disabled employees.
She said she her initial task will be to
look at "how Stanford has done thus far
in affirmative action hiring."
In order to determine this, she said
she will not only examine the numbers,
but also whether these employees are
"finding professional growth and devel
opment once they come to Stanford."

She also plans to work with the deans,
vice presidents and provost to see how
the individual schools and departments
are doing in terms of affirmative action.
"I want to help them address their stated
goals," she said.
Dickson said she intends to carry out
the recommendations of the report on
the office prepared last year by an advi-

Camarillo. "The Camarillo Report
lays out what it sees as the function
of the office," she said.
Dickson said she will begin
implementing the report's recom
mendation that the office re-focus
itself on staff affirmative action by
"the gathering, collection and ana
lyzing of data."
She said she will focus on the
analysis, asking, "What are the
areas we're doing well on and what
are the areas we need to address?"
Once Dickson has collected and
analyzed the necessary data, she
said she wants to "set up an action
plan which will state what the goals
of the office are with close consulta
tion with the provost, president and

Stanford employees."
"Then I can provide thoughtful
counsel to the president, provosts
and of course the deans," Dickson
said.
Dickson said she wants to pay
special attention to disabled staff
at Stanford, saying the main ques
tion she will address will be, "Is
Stanford University an accessible
place for them?"
"I see the office serving in a
communication function," Dick
son said. She said she will help
facilitate interaction between the
various staff organizations on
campus and top administrators.
"The means of communication
should go both ways," she said.
She said she wants "the staff
here at Stanford to feel that the
OMD is professional, caring and
knowledgeable in terms of the con
cerns and issues of staff. ... What
I want to bring to the office is to
give the staff a sense that they are

supported and valued."
Dickson said she also wants to
work with Vice President of Facul
ty and Staff Services Barbara But
terfield to see how their two offices
can work together.
One new project being consid
ered by Dickson is the creation of
"forums in which the Stanford
community can be informed about
what the objectives and goals of
the office are." Increasing the visi
bility of the office will allow for
more input from students, staff
and faculty, she said.
Dickson came to Stanford six
years ago, after serving as the
assistant dean of student affairs at
Golden Gate University Law
School in San Francisco.
As the associate dean for student
services at the Law School, Dick
son has been responsible for over
seeing general student services, as
well as the recruitment, admission
and retention of minority stu

dents. During her years at Stan
ford the number of minority appli
cants doubled, she said.
"One of the things I've done is
help create an active minority
admissions program," Dickson
said.
Dickson has also taught — and
will continue to teach — courses in
criminal and constitutional law.
In addition to her work at the
Law School, Dickson has served as
the resident fellow at Ujamaa
since 1989. "She's a very stimulat
ing person to work with," said Uja
maa resident assistant Cheryl
Clark. "She's always made herself
very available to us."
Dickson said that Ujamaa plays
"a critical role at Stanford" because
it is the first time that many stu
dents have lived in a fully-integrat
ed environment. "It gives them the
opportunity to understand, learn
and live with students who have
had different experiences," she said.

of the office," she said.
Dickson said she will begin
implementing the report's recom
mendation that the office re-focus
itself on staff affirmative action by
"the gathering, collection and ana
lyzing of data."
She said she will focus on the
analysis, asking, "What are the
areas we're doing well on and what
are the areas we need to address?"
Once Dickson has collected and
analyzed the necessary data, she
said she wants to "set up an action
plan which will state what the goals
of the office are with close consulta
tion with the provost, president and

Stanford employees."
"Then I can provide thoughtful
counsel to the president, provosts
and of course the deans," Dickson
said.
Dickson said she wants to pay
special attention to disabled staff
at Stanford, saying the main ques
tion she will address will be, "Is
Stanford University an accessible
place for them?"
"I see the office serving in a
communication function," Dick
son said. She said she will help
facilitate interaction between the
various staff organizations on
campus and top administrators.
"The means of communication
should go both ways," she said.
She said she wants "the staff
here at Stanford to feel that the
OMD is professional, caring and
knowledgeable in terms of the con
cerns and issues of staff. ... What
I want to bring to the office is to
give the staff a sense that they are

supported and valued."
Dickson said she also wants to
work with Vice President of Facul
ty and Staff Services Barbara But
terfield to see how their two offices
can work together.
One new project being consid
ered by Dickson is the creation of
"forums in which the Stanford
community can be informed about
what the objectives and goals of
the office are." Increasing the visi
bility of the office will allow for
more input from students, staff
and faculty, she said.
Dickson came to Stanford six
years ago, after serving as the
assistant dean of student affairs at
Golden Gate University Law
School in San Francisco.
As the associate dean for student
services at the Law School, Dick
son has been responsible for over
seeing general student services, as
well as the recruitment, admission
and retention of minority stu

dents. During her years at Stan
ford the number of minority appli
cants doubled, she said.
"One of the things I've done is
help create an active minority
admissions program," Dickson
said.
Dickson has also taught — and
will continue to teach — courses in
criminal and constitutional law.
In addition to her work at the
Law School, Dickson has served as
the resident fellow at Ujamaa
since 1989. "She's a very stimulat
ing person to work with," said Uja
maa resident assistant Cheryl
Clark. "She's always made herself
very available to us."
Dickson said that Ujamaa plays
"a critical role at Stanford" because
it is the first time that many stu
dents have lived in a fully-integrat
ed environment. "It gives them the
opportunity to understand, learn
and live with students who have
had different experiences," she said.
Attending a predominately-white col
lege, teaching criminal law to female
prisoners, and acting as resident fellow
for a theme house are just a few of the ex
periences that Sally Dickson will draw on
when she assumes the directorship of the
Office of Multicultural Development on
March 21.
For Dickson, issues of race, gender
and class have been life-long concerns,
beginning back in her college days when
she was one of the few black students at
the City University of New York, where
she majored in political science.
"I've always wondered about what are
the influences in society that shape peo
ple's behavior," said Dickson, currently
the associate dean for student affairs at
the Law School, addingthat jus a child she
once wanted to be a psychiatrist.
"I've always been really concerned
with the plight of poor people, especially
African-Americans," she said. "I entered
law because it is one of the ways that
changes could occur ... |It 1 could be
used as an agent for social change." Dick
son, a native of Queens in New York City,
earned her law degree at Rutgers Uni
versity in New Jersey.
Dickson spent her summers during
law school working for the American
Civil Liberties Union, including teaching
criminal law to women in a New Jersey
prison under the tutelage of then-Rut
gers professor, now-Supreme Court Jus
tice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
As Dickson prepares to assume her
new posit ion, she is busily making plans
about what she wants to accomplish as
head of the office, where she will be re
sponsible for monitoring the Universi
ty's hiring and promotion of African-

American, Asian-American, Chi
cano/Latino, Native-American, female
and disabled employees.
She said she her initial task will be to
look at "how Stanford has done thus far
in affirmative action hiring."
In order to determine this, she said
she will not only examine the numbers,
but also whether these employees are
"finding professional growth and devel
opment once they come to Stanford."

She also plans to work with the deans,
vice presidents and provost to see how
the individual schools and departments
are doing in terms of affirmative action.
"I want to help them address their stated
goals," she said.
Dickson said she intends to carry out
the recommendations of the report on
the office prepared last year by an advi-
