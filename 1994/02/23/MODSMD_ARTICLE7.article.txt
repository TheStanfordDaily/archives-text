### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Attending a predominately-white col
lege, teaching criminal law to female
prisoners, and acting as resident fellow
for a theme house are just a few of the ex
periences that Sally Dickson will draw on
when she assumes the directorship of the
Office of Multicultural Development on
March 21.
For Dickson, issues of race, gender
and class have been life-long concerns,
beginning back in her college days when
she was one of the few black students at
the City University of New York, where
she majored in political science.
"I've always wondered about what are
the influences in society that shape peo
ple's behavior," said Dickson, currently
the associate dean for student affairs at
the Law School, addingthat jus a child she

American, Asian-American, Chi
cano/Latino, Native-American, female
and disabled employees.
She said she her initial task will be to
look at "how Stanford has done thus far
in affirmative action hiring."
In order to determine this, she said
she will not only examine the numbers,
but also whether these employees are
"finding professional growth and devel

She also plans to work with the deans,
vice presidents and provost to see how
the individual schools and departments
are doing in terms of affirmative action.
"I want to help them address their stated
goals," she said.
