# Fac Sen tries to dissuade cheaters
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Responding to the rash of
cheating incidents during final ex
aminations almost a year ago, a
committee of the Faculty Senate
has issued a "statement concern
ing early exams," a move many
say could help raise awareness of
the obligations inherent in the
Honor Code.
The statement, which ap
peared in The Daily yesterday,
was issued by the Faculty Sen
ate's Committee on Academic Ap
praisal and Achievement in con
junction with members of the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council
and Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole.
Calling early examinations "a
privilege, not a right," the state
ment says that "faculty members
are discouraged from giving final
examinations earlier than the
published and announced times."
It suggests that students plan
ahead to avoid conflicts and that
professors, if they should decide
to offer early examinations,
change the content of the test and
administer the test in a "highly
controlled setting" to discourage
cheating.
Cole said she met with com
mittee chair Gail Mahood and
SCLC chair John Dupre last
spring because of allegations of
cheating last winter. In three
classes — Philosophy CIV, Geo
physics 4 and Molecular Biology
119 — cheating was suspected as
a result of students taking early
exams.
"In the wake of the problems
last year, the question came up on
whether we needed a policy on
whether or not exams could be
administered at any other than
the scheduled time," Cole said. "I
think it's a good idea to offer

some guidance to both students
and faculty.
"I don't think there have been
uniform expectations on the part
of faculty or students, and as a
result there have been widely
varying behaviors," she added.
Committee member Jeremy
Cohen, a communications profes
sor, said he believes the state
ments were intended "as a
reminder to faculty and students
that the Honor Code isn't wide
open, that it doesn't relieve facul
ty of the responsibility of main
taining an environment where
cheating is discouraged."
Mahood, the committee's
chair, agreed. "Some of the facul
ty over-interpret the Honor Code.
They think that because they're
not allowed to proctor, they're
not allowed to do anything. What
they don't understand is that
allowing an advantage for some
student is just as much an Honor
Code violation."
Some people affected by last
year's cheating incidents took a
positive view on the new state
ment.
"I think there's an obligation
on the part of faculty not to agree

to circumstances which could
encourage cheating," said Prof.
Mark Zoback, chair of the Geo
physics Department, calling the
statement "a reminder that devi
ating from normal procedure is
extraordinary, not ordinary."
Sophomore Keith Eischeid
said that while the policy was
good because it "promotes the
Honor Code," the statement
should be more widely dissemi
nated.
However, he also raised con
cerns about the necessity of early
examinations. "There is a ques
tion concerning the flexibility of
the exams; they're sort of set in
stone before we have any input,"
said Eischeid.
Senior Carla Sanchez-Palacios,
another veteran of Geophysics 4,
raised similar concerns, empha
sizing that she had needed to take
early examinations during her
Stanford career because of con
flicting plane flights and finals.
"If the professor didn't (allow
an early final), I couldn't have
taken the class or I couldn't have
gone home," she said, referring to
a course taken last quarter.
