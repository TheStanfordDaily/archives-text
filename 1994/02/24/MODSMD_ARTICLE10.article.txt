# Following the Tao
## Asian-American authors discuss issues facing writers 
### Mariam Maqsood 
Six Asian-American authors
spoke at a panel and reading dis
cussion last night as part of the
Creative Writing Department's
continuing program to address
issues facing contemporary writ
ers.
Deng Ming-Dao, author of the
recent "Chronicles of Dao" and
"365 Dao," advised that writers
write from the heart. "You have
to be true to yourself in your writ
ing," he said. "No one knows
what makes a blockbuster book,
so write the book you feel you
need to write."
The panel, entitled "Issues for
Asian-American Fiction Writers,"
also featured authors Samantha
Chang, Helen Cho, Ruthanne
Lum McCunn, R.A. Sasaki and
Marianne Villanueva. The writers
gave a five-minute reading of
excerpts from their works.
The authors then outlined
issues that face Asian-American
writers, including the pressure of

living up to traditional family
expectations, defining one's self
as an artist and determining how
one should approach writing as
an Asian-American.
Chang, a Stegner Fellow in Fic
tion Writing at Stanford, whose
piece "Pipa's Story" appeared in
The Atlantic last summer,
stressed that all writers face simi
lar issues in their writing.
"Many of the issues facing
young Asian-American writers
are the same concerns of all
young writers," she said, "the dif
ficult decision to give up a more
solid career for the more uncon
trollable creative life; the con
stant pressures of commercial
markets; and perhaps most
importantly, the strength to
grant oneself access to and
authority over one's natural
material."
Chang said that she saw many
similarities among the authors'
works. "I thought it was really
interesting that although the sto
ries come from many different

periods in history and we're all
such different writers, there were
similar themes running through
the stories," she said, outlining
common themes of family, cul
ture and people defining bound
aries for themselves when they
encounter new worlds.
Susan Weinberg, a Jones Lec
turer in the Creative Writing
Department, organized the panel
reading and discussion to bring
attention to the fact that Asian-
American writers face many chal
lenges in their writing.
"I think anytime somebody is
writing out of ethnic experience
or even family experience, they
have the same kinds of questions
about responsibility, about repre
senting people, and about being
pigeon-holed," she said.
Junior Richard Hsu was glad
to hear from six different perspec
tives. "There aren't that many
Asian-American writers out there
and it's a rare thing to get a lot of
them together and to have access
to that," he said.
