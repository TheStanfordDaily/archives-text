# Student borrowing increases at Stanford and across state
## 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Stanford joined the rest of the
nation with a $2.5 million
increase in student borrowing
this year, a result of relaxed fed
eral lending rules.
The number of student loans
taken out from fiscal years
1992-93 to 1993-94 jumped
from 1,814 to 1,918. This
showed an increase from $5.5
million in loans to about $8 mil
lion in loans taken out by Stan
ford students, said Diana
Netherton, staff analyst at the
California Student Aid Commis
sion in a statement.
These loans represent about
85 percent of students who bor
row at Stanford, Netherton said.
Statewide, California stu
dents and parents borrowed 50
percent more money for college
this school year, totaling a
record $1.2 billion in loans.
One of the main reasons for

this increase in borrowing is the
Higher Education Reauthoriza
tion Act of 1992.
"This act did two things,"
said Financial Aids Office Asst.
Director Cynthia Rife. "It raised
the amount of money that stu
dents could borrow ... and it
said that any student could bor
row whether they had financial
need or not.
"Those two factors accounted
for the large increase in vol
ume," she said.
Rife said the act and the
resulting jump in student bor
rowing is "good news and bad
news."
"It's good news in that there's
access for money to help pay for
a Stanford education .... The
bad news is that the amount of
loan a student may borrow may
negatively impact a student's
future choices."
Rife added that "it's not until
the student is paying back the
loan that it's a problem."
