# Professor discusses cosmic catastrophes
## 
### Kyle Graham Staff writer 
Last night in the Physics Tank,
the land of children's literature met
the world of astrogeology. "Chicken
Little was right," said Prof. Eugene
Shoemaker of the U.S. Geologic
Survey. "Earth is subject to inter
planetary bombardment."
Shoemaker, a researcher with
the Lowell Observatory, spoke to
an audience of 150 on the dangers
Earth faces from comets and other
celestial objects in the "asteroid
swarm" it orbits.
"When I started working, we
knew of five [Earth-crossing aster
oids] with a diameter of over one
kilometer; now we know of 200 and
believe there are as many as 2,000,"
Shoemaker said. He added that
comets, which are far larger than
asteroids yet much less common,
also pose a remote danger to Earth.
A one-kilometer asteroid, the
likes of which strikes the Earth
about every 100,000 years, creates

a crater approximately 10 kilome
ters in diameter, Shoemaker said.
Comets, which average about 10
kilometers in diameter, strike only
once every 50-75 million years, yet
can create craters up to 175 kilome
ters in diameter. One such comet,
which struck the Yucatan Peninsu
la 65 million years ago, is blamed
for climatic changes which led to
the extinction of the dinosaurs.
Despite the accumulating evi
dence that suggests the major role
that comets and asteroids play in
mass extinctions and climate shifts
on earth, Shoemaker said many
researchers in his field still have
their doubts.
"This whole notion that large
objects can fall out of the sky and
have a large impact has become an
anathema to many of my col
leagues," he said.
Shoemaker's speech was the
13th annual Bunyan Lecture, a
series of speeches concerning the
origin of the universe and the
future of mankind.
