Accrediting statement adopted
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A controversial
statement on diversity was adopted yesterday
by the organization that accredits schools and
colleges in California, Hawaii and Guam.
The Accrediting Commission of the Western
Association of Schools and Colleges said the
statement on diversity was "overwhelmingly
supported by the 145 accredited candidate col
leges and universities" that belong to the group.
The statement's core read: "The institution
demonstrates its commitment to the increas
ingly significant role played by diversity of eth
nic, social, and economic backgrounds among
its members by making positive efforts to foster
such diversity."
Colleges and universities must be accredited
in order to gain federal funds, including student
loans.
Stanford's Faculty Senate unanimously
renounced the document earlier this month on
the grounds that it posed a threat to University
autonomy and contained discriminatory lan
guage.
University President Gerhard Casper told
faculty leaders earlier this month that the com
mission was attempting to "insert itself in an
area in which it has no legitimate standing."
"No institution should be required to demon
strate its commitment to diversity to the satis
faction of an external review panel," he said.
Kerrigan skates past Harding
HAMAR, Norway (AP) — Nancy Kerrigan
soared above Tonya Harding and the rest of the
field yesterday to win the opening round in the
most-anticipated women's figure skating com
petition ever.
In a triumphant return to competition from
a clubbing attack, Kerrigan even surpassed
world champion Oksana Baiul's "Swan Lake"
routine and placed first in the technical pro
gram portion of the Olympic competition.
Baiul, from Ukraine, was second and
France's Surya Bonaly third going into Fri
day's free skate, worth two-thirds of the total
score.
Harding finished 10th and ended up an
afterthought, out of medal contention.
Kerrigan presented a nearly flawless short
program, providing a dynamic climax to the
evening.
Her lowest score for technical merit was 5.6,
and her presentation marks ranged from 5.6 to
5.9. She ranked first with every judge except
Great Britain and Ukraine, who put Baiul on top.
