# Bosnian Muslims and Croats sign peace treaty

ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) â€” Under growing diplo
matic pressure from the West, the military chiefs of
Bosnia's Muslim-led government and their second
strongest foes, Bosnia's Croats, signed a truce yes
terday.
Many truces in Bosnia have collapsed, but the
accord between the former allies against Bosnia's
Serbs is likely to gain strength from diplomatic
efforts to extend across Bosnia a NATO-enforced
truce in Sarajevo.
A new note of discord, however, emerged between
Russia and the West when Boris Yeltsin lashed out
at NATO for threatening air strikes against Russia's
traditional allies, the Serbs, without asking Russia
first.

The Russian president reiterated his proposal for
a summit between Russia, the United States,
France, Britain and Germany to "put an end to the
Yugoslav conflict." But the United States and Ger
many were cool to the idea yesterday, indicating it
was premature.
Foreign diplomats consider an end to fighting
between Croats and government forces crucial to an
overall peace settlement.
The cease-fire, which takes effect at noon (2 a.m.
EST) tomorrow, covers central Bosnia and Mostar
and other areas in the south where Muslims and
Croats have fought bitterly since their alliance col
lapsed last April.
"The U.N. hopes and trusts that it will be respect-

Ed and implemented by both sides, which is essential
in this moment," said Yasushi Akashi, head of the
U.N. mission in former Yugoslavia. Akashi partici
pated in the four hours of talks that produced the
accord.
The agreement is the most precise and serious in
a long list of cease-fire accords. Its signing came
amid renewed efforts by the United Nations, NATO
and especially the United States and Russia to bring
peace to Bosnia.
Yeltsin's proposal, announced Tuesday, would
build on the Russian initiative last week that per
suaded Bosnian Serbs to withdraw heavy weapons
from Sarajevo following NATO's ultimatum to do so
or face air strikes.
