# Soviet spies for U.S. killed
## Accused officer's wife cooperating with authorities 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - At least two
Soviets who spied for the United States
were killed after being exposed by the
career CIA officer who has been accused of
selling national security secrets, American
officials said yesterday.
Meanwhile, the accused officer's wife
has been cooperating with the government
since she was arrested along with her hus
band on Monday, according to one official,
commenting only on condition of anonymi
ty.
The official would not say what Maria
del Rosario Casas Ames has disclosed. But
her cooperation could be crucial to the
government's effort to learn how much
damage she and her husband, CIA opera
tions officer Aldrich H. Ames, might have
done.
The Clinton administration seemed
determined not to allow the issue to ruin
relations with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin.
President Clinton said the case involved
a "very serious" breach of security
"because of issues that I am not at this
time at liberty to discuss." But he cau
tioned against a drastic change in U.S.-
Russia relations.
"I do not think the facts of this case at
this time undermine in any way shape or
form the policy we have followed the last
year toward President Yeltsin and his gov
ernment and the forces of change in Rus
sia," Clinton said.
The administration has asked the Rus
sians to defuse tension over the spy case by

voluntarily removing from Washington
one or more of the Russian intelligence
officers connected to the alleged 1985
recruitment of Ames and his wife, Rosario.
Senate Republican leader Robert Dole
of Kansas called the case "as damaging as
any in U.S. intelligence history." He said
that at a minimum the Russians should
"cease and condemn efforts to penetrate
American intelligence."
Dole also said a temporary freeze on
U.S. aid to Russia should be imposed until
Clinton is satisfied that the Kremlin is
ending its espionage against the United
States.
In Moscow, officials played down the
importance of the case and said it should
not provoke "excessive political emotions."
Some said the United States continues to
spy on Russia.
Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service
chief, Yevgeny Primakov, told The Associ
ated Press he had never heard of Ames.
The Ameses were charged Tuesday
with conspiracy to commit espionage, a
charge that carries a potential penalty of
life in prison. The couple are scheduled to
appear at a hearing in federal court in
Alexandria, Va., on Friday.
The Justice Department accused Ames,
52, and his wife, 41, of funneling U.S.
national security secrets to the Soviet
Union and later the Russian government
in exchange for cash payments totaling
$1.5 million. The spy operation is alleged
to have continued until the two were
arrested by FBI agents on Monday.
