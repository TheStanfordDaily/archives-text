Palo Alto should not fall
in step with new trend
to criminalize homeless

Homeless, will work for
food." The signs beg for
attention and some spare
change. But such pleas for help
often fall on deaf or plainly unsym
pathetic ears. And increasingly,
cities throughout the Bay Area are
passing ordinances against
vagrants and panhandlers.
Unfortunately, the citizens and
merchants of Stanford's next-door
neighbor, Palo Alto, have also been
voicing complaints about the nui
sance caused by the local homeless
population. They have expressed
both fear and loathing of those
individuals who make the streets
their home. And while the city has
taken no firm steps so far to pro
pose a law in response to these con
cerns, it has recognized the need to
address them.
To counter this increasingly
intolerant sentiment, though, one
Stanford student group has
launched a laudable effort to
increase citizens' knowledge about
the homeless.
In defense of the panhandlers,
the Stanford Homelessness Action
Coalition sponsored a town meet
ing in Palo Alto last week to discuss
the issue of aggressive panhan
dling. It drew merchants, govern
ment and law enforcement offi
cials, concerned residents and
homeless persons together to
exchange their views.
The group has also been involved
in other programs to assist the
homeless population in Palo Alto
and deserves praise for its efforts.
Its other endeavors include hold
ing weekly community meetings,
where the attendance is roughly
half homeless individuals and half
students. SHAC is also working to
obtain storage lockers for local
homeless individuals and publish a

"street sheet" newsletter, as well as
trying to find more permanent
solutions to the problem. The
group tackles an issue that extends
far beyond the Stanford communi
ty and spreads a pro-active senti
ment to other student groups.
It also stands by the idealistic
but true notion that the problem of
homelessness will not simply disap
pear with the passage of a few laws.
Certainly the NIMBY solution,
which many cities have chosen to
adopt, is very contagious â€” it's
always easier to turn away and say,
"Not in my backyard," than to
engage in constructive discourse
on the problem. Some in Palo Alto
are so frustrated that they would
be happy just to pass a law that
would do nothing but force the
homeless to another town without
the law.
But as members of SHAC have
maintained, this solution is not
very effective. For example, San
Francisco began the controversial
Matrix program for the homeless
last August, but had spent $1 mil
lion in the first three months to
enforce the program. The program
allowed authorities to cite home
less people for panhandling and
camping in public parks, among
other acts. And while there have
been plenty of citations, there
hasn't been a marked decline in the
homeless population.
Ultimately, the decision to make
laws against homeless people's liv
ing situations cannot be sustained.
Local merchants may be
annoyed at having panhandlers at
their doorways, hounding cus
tomers for spare change. But by
pressing for legislation against
such actions, they are sidestepping
the real issues, such as low wages
and a lack of employment opportu
nities that force some to resort to
these measures.
SHAC's town meeting was an
admirable and helpful way to draw
attention to these underlying
issues.
And while fighting homelessness
is no easy battle, it's better than
fighting the homeless.
