## More heart, less TV hype 
### 
LAST FRIDAY night, like most of
America, I was stuck to the TV. In
just moments, Dan Jansen was
going to begin his last effort at an
Olympic speed skating medal. Chills were
running up my spine. The whole world
was pulling for this guy. Just then some
one knocked on the back door of the Ital
ian house, where I live. As he walked in,
he spotted the screen.
"Dan Jansen!" he said. "This is great.
He wins the gold medal."
So much for drama. Apparently, the
race had been held earlier in the day.
Sure, I was a bit pissed off. But the guy
had made an honest mistake. The race
would still be exciting.
And it was. Jansen was amazing. The
man almost fell twice and he still shat
tered the world record. Everyone in the
room was going nuts. And after Jansen
spotted the scoreboard, his arms shot up
over his head and he held his face in his
hands. There was his wife, crying and
screaming, "Thank you, God!"
It was one hell of a moment, whether
you knew it was coming or not. Especial
ly for the people at CBS. In fact, they
liked that moment so much, they decided
to drive it home. So they showed Dan's
dad, jumping in his seat. Then it was his
mother. And then his wife again. And
then his friends at home, and some sup
porters, and his distant cousins, and his
plumber. . ..
Before long, CBS had ruined every

thing — far worse than the guy who
blurted out the race results to me. It
turned a monumental athletic achieve
ment into a soap opera. By the time they
were finished, Dan Jansen's world record
had about as much power to move me as
a bean burrito.
Sad to say, it was typical of CBS'
Olympic coverage. From day one, they've
shown that they're interested in the sen
sational. If an actual event happens to fit
in that category, you get to watch it.
If not, you get something else — like a
slew of human interest stories. Except
usually, they're just not that interesting.
And I've seen so many, they all sound the
same. How about some discretion? Espe
cially with the depressing stories. Did
anyone else see the touching piece on
1992 USA hockey goalkeeper Ray Le
Blanc, now a backup on a minor league
hockey team? That sure was an upper.
What makes CBS think I want to hear
about a guy whose life has basically gone
down the toilet since the last Olympics?
Speaking of the toilet, last time I
checked, CBS and MTV were two com
pletely separate entities. But no longer.
The coverage of every Olympic event has
to start with a two minute get-you
pumped video, complete with a hip song,
crazy colors and oh-so-funky images.
Thanks, but no thanks.
And what about those articulate CBS
announcers? My God, are they jaded.
Why do we have to listen to a Norwegian

account of Jansen's race to hear some
emotion? It's embarrassing.
Finally, I'd like to see CBS prove
they've got some tact. Every time these
athletes pull off some incredible effort,
reporters stick mikes in their faces and
ask, "Can you tell me how you felt when
. . Strangely enough, their answers
almost never capture the thrill of the
feats we've marveled at. Not every ath
lete is Mohammed Ali. Sometimes, it's
better not to know how someone feels.
Sometimes it's just better to imagine.
My friends, I'm starting to get a little
antsy. I'm beginning to ask questions. I'm
thinking that maybe — just maybe — it all
comes down to money and ratings. And I'm
getting a little angry. And that's not good.
It's time to stop the hype. Prove that
the Olympics aren't stretched out over
two weeks just to fit in all the advertise
ments. Let's see more than just the top
three competitors in each event battle it
out in two-minute spurts. Maybe broad
cast an entire event. Ease off the com
mercial breaks.
Is that too much to ask?
Damn right it isn't.

Dave denies that his bitterness started
after being cut from the U.S. luge team at
the last moment.
