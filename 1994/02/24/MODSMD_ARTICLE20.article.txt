## Croal offers insight into administration's true agenda 
### 
REID SCHAR, IN HIS response
to N'gai Croal's column (Feb. 17
letter to the editor), seems to
believe that Croal's opinion is unique
and completely paranoid. While
Croal's opinions in his column may
express the only one of its kind in The
Daily, his opinions are grounded in
the beliefs and hearts of many others
on campus, myself included. Croal's
column stands not as a delusional,
paranoid diatribe, nor is it simply an
opportunity for one student to "bash"
the administration. His column,
instead, consistently critiques the
news and the administration, reveal
ing the true agenda and motives
behind the administration.
But I guess you know that, Schar.
You read The Daily every day. While
this is a laudable if not courageous
act, reading The Daily does not pro
vide anyone with enough information
to make an educated opinion, nor does
it absolve anyone from the sin of apa
thy.
Does Schar know that Provost Con
doleezza Rice at the Feb. 16 town
meeting responded to a question of
executive pay cuts as part of the over
all budget trimming by angrily saying
she forewent compensation by merely
accepting the job as Provost? This is

the same woman who sits on the
board of trustees at TransAmerica and
Chevron Corporations, two powerful
corporate positions.
Does he know that the University is
currently negotiating The Daily's
lease, and has proposed a clause that
would require all Daily editors to be
registered students (editors in chief of
The Daily have traditionally stopped
out in order to manage the time-con
suming job of running a daily newspa
per)? This would, in effect, disempow
er a major forum of student communi
cation. Do the words "freedom of the
press" ring a bell?
The hypocrisy of Stanford's admin
istration has been blatant. It preaches
multiculturalism and a diverse Cul
tures, Ideas, and Values curriculum,
yet cannot take the responsibility to
make the correct and moral decision
concerning Webb Ranch.
How can a university require
Europe and the Americas for a group
of freshmen and then allow the abuse
of migrant farm labor on its own land?
The University is currently allowing
the Webbs to stall their arbitration
with the workers. I do not think there
can be enough criticism of a university
that allows anyone of these things to
happen. While Schar cries, "Good God

man, enough is enough," I say "Bring
it on."
We cannot afford the likes of Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper, Rice,
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds or Dean of Students Michael
Jackson. The fact that Croal finds it
necessary to write about these issues
every week is not coincidence or his
inability to find another subject to
write on. These issues need to be
attacked. And it is not only the respon
sibility of one "fly in the buttermilk" to
bring these issues to light.
All of us, as students, staff, and fac
ulty, bear the responsibility of forcing
the administration to come clean on its
political agenda.
It seems to me that students at this
school like to argue and they like a
good controversy, as long as it isn't
too big or doesn't hurt anybody's feel
ings. Schar admits he agrees with
much of Croal's column, yet he simul
taneously tells him to cool off. It's
interesting to me that in five months
of Croal's political and opinionated
columns, the only response has been
one to say, "You're right, but keep it
down." This is wrong.
Apathy is rampant on this campus,
Schar, and if you deny it then you're
the one with delusions. We, as stu-

dents, cannot be afraid of a fight with
this University for our rights as stu
dents.
If you agree with Croal's column,
do something about it. Do some
research and find out what this uni
versity is really up to. If you disagree,
write the Daily and say why. Either
that or join The Stanford Review.
Students like Schar should realize
that things such as the cuts to the cul
tural centers and the debate over a
more "traditional" education affect
everybody on this campus. Sitting back
and reading The Daily may keep Schar
somewhat informed, but it doesn't make
any reform or voice any discontent.
The writing and courage of Croal's
column should be exalted, not con
demned. This is not an issue of right
vs. left, Republican vs. Democrat,
minority vs. mainstream. What it
comes down to is the University's
attempt to undermine any political
agenda of the student body and sever
our modes of communication and dis
course, throwing us back into the dark
ages of education. I for one will not
stand for this and applaud Croal's
weekly effort.
