# Problems in diversity need solutions instead of more confusing info

The headline for Professor Stephen
Krasner's Feb. 18 Friday forum reads
"Information needed to discuss diver
sity." May I suggest that information
on diversity should be spelled
R.A.C.E.
Reason tells us that the historic
disadvantage of blacks in income,

occupation, education, health and
housing is not a statistical aberration
and is based on social structure, not
individual deficiency. Information on
the relationship between academic
performance and race is available
now and has been available for some
time not only in education but for job
performance.
Avoidance dominates action when
we combine historic white bias and
economic advantage with abstract
ideals such as merit, equality, and
information gathering, e.g. The
Kerner Report.

Color is the substitute for culture
in America and no one has ever had
any problem knowing which is
which. This is why West Indian
blacks, with all their work ethic, still
earn less than the national average
or any identifiable white group.
Evidence on social disadvantage
is most frequently used to confuse
and confound rather than to eradi
cate segregation or white advan
tage.
