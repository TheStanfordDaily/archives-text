## Fuerbringer picks spikes over slams Ex-hoops star now a vital member of volleyball team 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
If you asked him today, Matt Fuer
bringer would say he'd rather win the
Final Four in volleyball b bail.
Hands down, no question about it.
Two years ago, however, Stanford's
6-foot-7 sophomore opposite hitter was
one of Southern California's hottest
basketball prospects. With numerous
tantalizing basketball packages from
local Division I schools being dangled in
front of him, several collegiate volley
ball programs gave up on trying to
recruit him.
After leading his Estancia High
School team to two consecutive state
titles, even the Costa Mesa native him
self thought basketball would be his col
legiate calling.
That was before Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves decided to take a gamble
on this part-time volleyball player and
full-time basketball star.
"He had four basketball Irecruitingl
trips lined up after his trip to Stanford,"
Nieves said. "But after he visited with
our program, he called me up that night
and decided to cancel the rest of his
trips in favor of Stanford."
What looked like a stroke of recruit
ing genius to volleyball programs such
as USC (which came calling after Fuer
bringer had committed to Stanford) was
really a rather simple decision in Fuer
bringer's mind.
"I took a look at the guys, and I knew
this was a team of winners," he said. "I
thought that with all these successful
people on one team, anything can hap
pen."
After signing with the Cardinal,
Fuerbringer started on the road to mak
ing things happen by red-shirting his
freshman year and learning the funda
mentals of volleyball. Playing behind
first-team All-American Dave Goss,
who is now on the U.S. national team,
Fuerbringer was not about to see signif
icant playing time. As a result, he spent
his rookie season tuning up the skills he
never learned in high school.
"The biggest transition I had to

make was playing against athletes who
were as good as I was," Fuerbringer
said. "Before, I had just gotten by with
being taller and being able to iumn high
er, but when I got here I realized I was
lacking true volleyball skills."
That was when Fuerbringer made
the transition from playing full-time
basketball to practicing full-time volley
ball.
"I played volleyball in high school,
but our basketball team was so good
that I would miss half the volleyball sea
son for basketball," he said. "I never
concentrated on volleyball, because I
never thought that would be the sport
I'd play in college."
Nevertheless, Fuerbringer developed
into a powerful opposite hitter — one
who will be the nucleus of the Stan
ford's offense for seasons to come.
Filling the tremendous void left by
Goss is no easy task, but Fuerbringer
stepped up to the occasion this season
by posting potential All-League figures
in average kills per game and hitting
percentage.
Before the Brigham Young match
last week, Fuerbringer staked out the
fourth spot in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation in average kills with
7.29 per game, only 0.01 kills behind
third-place Chris Underwood of USC.
In hitting percentage, the sophomore
has swung for a .495 showing — also
good for fourth in the league.
"I never pictured myself as a top hit
ter on this team, let alone the league,"
Fuerbringer said. "I think it's had a lot
to do with playing around guys like
Mike [Lambert] and Joe [Burghardtl
and Canyon [Ceman], They raise your
game to the next level."
Combined with sophomore swing
hitter Lambert, the duo was described
as "unstoppable" by University of Cali
fornia at Irvine coach Andy Read after a
29-kill performance by Fuerbringer and
19 kills by Lambert against the
Anteaters earlier this year.
Comments such as "phenomenal"
and "world class" are often uttered
after every match by opposing coaches
who have witnessed Fuerbringer's and

Lambert's spiking prowess.
Even Nieves believes Fuerbringer
will be ripe for s professional career
beyond Stanford. "I think he has inter
national volleyball potential," he said.
"He can play on the highest level any
where, whether it be on the national
team or on the beach.
"That's probably one of the reasons
why he chose volleyball over basketball,
because he knows he can play at the
highest possible level."
However, despite all his potential
and all the praise being showered upon
him, Fuerbringer also has had to take
his lumps, just like any other rookie
playing in the toughest collegiate volley
ball league.
Against fourth-ranked BYU last
week, Fuerbringer tallied a game-high
29 kills to lead the Stanford attack, but
that was at the expense of 15 hitting
errors in 52 opportunities for a sub-par
.269 percentage.
"You have to take the good with the
bad," Nieves said. "He's like most young
players in that he's sometimes erratic,
but he's definitely working on that."
Nevertheless, Fuerbringer has also
been described as a gamer, the "go-to
man" in tough situations. Against the
BYU Cougars, the opposite hitter
racked up 14 kills on Cardinal services
in the third game alone to outdistance
everyone on the court.
"Opposite is probably the toughest
position to be good at in that it requires
the most exceptional athletic ability,"
Nieves said. "To be able to hit out of the
back row (opposite is the only position
where the player hits in all six rota
tions] with any consistency is really an
athletic talent."
If Fuerbringer's full athletic poten
tial is realized, Nieves foresees immi
nent success for the former all-state
hoopster.
"He is exactly what the national
team is looking for right now. I think in
last year's recruiting class there are sev
eral players the national team would
love to get into their program and train
for down the road — and Matt is defi
nitely one of them."

really a rather simple decision in Fuer
bringer's mind.
"I took a look at the guys, and I knew
this was a team of winners," he said. "I
thought that with all these successful
people on one team, anything can hap
pen."
After signing with the Cardinal,
Fuerbringer started on the road to mak
ing things happen by red-shirting his
freshman year and learning the funda
mentals of volleyball. Playing behind
first-team All-American Dave Goss,
who is now on the U.S. national team,
Fuerbringer was not about to see signif
icant playing time. As a result, he spent
his rookie season tuning up the skills he
never learned in high school.
"The biggest transition I had to

make was playing against athletes who
were as good as I was," Fuerbringer
said. "Before, I had just gotten by with
being taller and being able to iumn high
er, but when I got here I realized I was
lacking true volleyball skills."
That was when Fuerbringer made
the transition from playing full-time
basketball to practicing full-time volley
ball.
"I played volleyball in high school,
but our basketball team was so good
that I would miss half the volleyball sea
son for basketball," he said. "I never
concentrated on volleyball, because I
never thought that would be the sport
I'd play in college."
Nevertheless, Fuerbringer developed
into a powerful opposite hitter — one
who will be the nucleus of the Stan
ford's offense for seasons to come.
Filling the tremendous void left by
Goss is no easy task, but Fuerbringer
stepped up to the occasion this season
by posting potential All-League figures
in average kills per game and hitting
percentage.
Before the Brigham Young match
last week, Fuerbringer staked out the
fourth spot in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation in average kills with
7.29 per game, only 0.01 kills behind
third-place Chris Underwood of USC.
In hitting percentage, the sophomore
has swung for a .495 showing — also
good for fourth in the league.
"I never pictured myself as a top hit
ter on this team, let alone the league,"
Fuerbringer said. "I think it's had a lot
to do with playing around guys like
Mike [Lambert] and Joe [Burghardtl
and Canyon [Ceman], They raise your
game to the next level."
Combined with sophomore swing
hitter Lambert, the duo was described
as "unstoppable" by University of Cali
fornia at Irvine coach Andy Read after a
29-kill performance by Fuerbringer and
19 kills by Lambert against the
Anteaters earlier this year.
Comments such as "phenomenal"
and "world class" are often uttered
after every match by opposing coaches
who have witnessed Fuerbringer's and

Lambert's spiking prowess.
Even Nieves believes Fuerbringer
will be ripe for s professional career
beyond Stanford. "I think he has inter
national volleyball potential," he said.
"He can play on the highest level any
where, whether it be on the national
team or on the beach.
"That's probably one of the reasons
why he chose volleyball over basketball,
because he knows he can play at the
highest possible level."
However, despite all his potential
and all the praise being showered upon
him, Fuerbringer also has had to take
his lumps, just like any other rookie
playing in the toughest collegiate volley
ball league.
Against fourth-ranked BYU last
week, Fuerbringer tallied a game-high
29 kills to lead the Stanford attack, but
that was at the expense of 15 hitting
errors in 52 opportunities for a sub-par
.269 percentage.
"You have to take the good with the
bad," Nieves said. "He's like most young
players in that he's sometimes erratic,
but he's definitely working on that."
Nevertheless, Fuerbringer has also
been described as a gamer, the "go-to
man" in tough situations. Against the
BYU Cougars, the opposite hitter
racked up 14 kills on Cardinal services
in the third game alone to outdistance
everyone on the court.
"Opposite is probably the toughest
position to be good at in that it requires
the most exceptional athletic ability,"
Nieves said. "To be able to hit out of the
back row (opposite is the only position
where the player hits in all six rota
tions] with any consistency is really an
athletic talent."
If Fuerbringer's full athletic poten
tial is realized, Nieves foresees immi
nent success for the former all-state
hoopster.
"He is exactly what the national
team is looking for right now. I think in
last year's recruiting class there are sev
eral players the national team would
love to get into their program and train
for down the road — and Matt is defi
nitely one of them."

surprised Cardinal coaches with his smooth transition from basketball to volleyball.
If you asked him today, Matt Fuer
bringer would say he'd rather win the
Final Four in volleyball b bail.
Hands down, no question about it.
Two years ago, however, Stanford's
6-foot-7 sophomore opposite hitter was
one of Southern California's hottest
basketball prospects. With numerous
tantalizing basketball packages from
local Division I schools being dangled in
front of him, several collegiate volley
ball programs gave up on trying to
recruit him.
After leading his Estancia High
School team to two consecutive state
titles, even the Costa Mesa native him
self thought basketball would be his col
legiate calling.
That was before Stanford head coach
Ruben Nieves decided to take a gamble
on this part-time volleyball player and
full-time basketball star.
"He had four basketball Irecruitingl
trips lined up after his trip to Stanford,"
Nieves said. "But after he visited with
our program, he called me up that night
and decided to cancel the rest of his
trips in favor of Stanford."
What looked like a stroke of recruit
ing genius to volleyball programs such
as USC (which came calling after Fuer
bringer had committed to Stanford) was
really a rather simple decision in Fuer
bringer's mind.
"I took a look at the guys, and I knew
this was a team of winners," he said. "I
