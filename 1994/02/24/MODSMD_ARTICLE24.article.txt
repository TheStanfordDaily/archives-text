The second half of the season has not been a pret

After jumping to a 13-5 start to open its slate, the

Montgomery said of his Stanford squad, which was
picked to finish as low as ninth in the Pac-10 by pre

earn the Cardinal a slot in the National Invitational
Tournament.
"We have to be thinking about our postseason
opportunities at this point," Stanford forward
Brent Williams said. "There's no more time for let
downs, especially if we're thinking about NCAAs."
When the Cardinal takes on the Trojans (12-10,
5-8) tonight, it faces a team with some far-flung
postseason hopes of their own.
USC has been one of the more disappointing
teams in the league, battling through a six-game los
ing streak at one point in the season. But in their
last contest, the Trojans upset Arizona State on the
road 68-56, a game that gives the squad late-season
