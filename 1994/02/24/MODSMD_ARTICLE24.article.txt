# Men's basketball travels to L.A.
## Team needs two wins to keep NCAA tourney hopes alive 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
The second half of the season has not been a pret
ty one for the Stanford men's basketball team.
After jumping to a 13-5 start to open its slate, the
Cardinal (13-8 overall, 6-6 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence) has dropped three straight games while falling
to a .500 mark in the Pac-10 for the first time in
almost a month.
"No one said it would be easy for us," coach Mike
Montgomery said of his Stanford squad, which was
picked to finish as low as ninth in the Pac-10 by pre
season observers. "But if we're going to start a run,
this weekend would be a good time to start one."
The Cardinal travels to Los Angeles this week
end, facing USC and UCLA in a pair of contests vital
to the team's still-alive NCAA Tournament aspira
tions.

With six games remaining on its schedule, Stan
ford needs a minimum of five wins to be considered
for an NCAA berth. Anything less would probably
earn the Cardinal a slot in the National Invitational
Tournament.
"We have to be thinking about our postseason
opportunities at this point," Stanford forward
Brent Williams said. "There's no more time for let
downs, especially if we're thinking about NCAAs."
When the Cardinal takes on the Trojans (12-10,
5-8) tonight, it faces a team with some far-flung
postseason hopes of their own.
USC has been one of the more disappointing
teams in the league, battling through a six-game los
ing streak at one point in the season. But in their
last contest, the Trojans upset Arizona State on the
road 68-56, a game that gives the squad late-season
momentum, according to USC
coach George Raveling.
"Our goal is to finish out the sea
son on a positive note, and we think
the odds are in our favor," Raveling
said. "A strong finish will, with
enough victories, put us in a posi
tion to go to the NIT."

Earlier this season, the Cardinal
topped USC in a bruising, physical
contest â€” the two teams set a Pac
-10 record by combining for 52 fouls.
On Saturday, Stanford ventures
out to Westwood, facing the front
running Bruins in a game as vital to
the Cardinal as it is to UCLA.
Much has changed since the
undefeated and then No. 1-ranked
Bruins emerged from Maples Pavil
ion with a 69-65 victory over the
Cardinal earlier in the year.

Though UCLA (18-3, 11-2) has
topped the Pac-10 all season, its
lead has been whittled to a single
game by charging Arizona and Cal
ifornia. Earlier this week, the Bru
ins slipped to their lowest USA
Today/CNN ranking of the season
at No. 15.
Not that UCLA's problems
make it any easier for the Cardinal
to play at Pauley Pavilion, where
Stanford has won only two games
in the last 40 years.
