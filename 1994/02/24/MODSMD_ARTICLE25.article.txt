## Championship time for wrestlers 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
Although they've competed in ten dual meets and
five tournaments since the middle of November, the
Stanford wrestlers are just beginning their season.
This weekend the Cardinal (3-7) will travel to Cal
Poly-SLO on the most important quest of the season —
the Pacific 10 Conference Championships. The tourna
ment marks both the end and the pinnacle of the sea
son.
"It's like we're going to war," said head coach Chris
Horpel. "We've run a lot of miles, lifted a lot of weights,
run a lot of stadium steps — and we're putting it all on
the line for this big event."
Unfortunately the Cardinal will be without two of its
strongest and most consistent athletes. Sophomore
Jimmy Aguirre, defending Pac-10 champion at 134
pounds, will not wrestle due to a ruptured disk. This
season Aguirre was second in team points and had an
overall record of 19-11, with two pins and three techni
cal falls.

Sophomore Matt Cano must also forego the remain
ing competition of the season. The 126-pounder injured
his knee against Fresno State late last month, and was
unable to heal in time to regain his optimal strength.
Cano was the team's fourth highest scorer, and posted
an impressive record of 17-7.
"It's hard to take because I really trained hard for
the Pac-lOs," said Cano. "It was devastating at first, but
I'll get over it." He added that this setback will increase
his motivation next season.
Despite these two losses, the Cardinal hopes for
strong performances from all 10 athletes competing
this weekend. Horpel anticipates that up to five of the
wrestlers will qualify for nationals. He said that Jay
Jackson (134), I>ance Johnson (142), and Tod Surmon
(150) are potential top seeds in their divisions.
Sophomore Ed Medina, who was a critical contribu
tor to the Cardinal's most recent win over University of
California at Davis, will compete at 126 pounds after
wrestling at 134 and 150 during different points of the
