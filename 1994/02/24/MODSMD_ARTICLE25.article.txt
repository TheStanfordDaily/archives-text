# The 						road to NCAAs
## Championship time for wrestlers 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
Although they've competed in ten dual meets and
five tournaments since the middle of November, the
Stanford wrestlers are just beginning their season.
This weekend the Cardinal (3-7) will travel to Cal
Poly-SLO on the most important quest of the season —
the Pacific 10 Conference Championships. The tourna
ment marks both the end and the pinnacle of the sea
son.
"It's like we're going to war," said head coach Chris
Horpel. "We've run a lot of miles, lifted a lot of weights,
run a lot of stadium steps — and we're putting it all on
the line for this big event."
Unfortunately the Cardinal will be without two of its
strongest and most consistent athletes. Sophomore
Jimmy Aguirre, defending Pac-10 champion at 134
pounds, will not wrestle due to a ruptured disk. This
season Aguirre was second in team points and had an
overall record of 19-11, with two pins and three techni
cal falls.

Sophomore Matt Cano must also forego the remain
ing competition of the season. The 126-pounder injured
his knee against Fresno State late last month, and was
unable to heal in time to regain his optimal strength.
Cano was the team's fourth highest scorer, and posted
an impressive record of 17-7.
"It's hard to take because I really trained hard for
the Pac-lOs," said Cano. "It was devastating at first, but
I'll get over it." He added that this setback will increase
his motivation next season.
Despite these two losses, the Cardinal hopes for
strong performances from all 10 athletes competing
this weekend. Horpel anticipates that up to five of the
wrestlers will qualify for nationals. He said that Jay
Jackson (134), I>ance Johnson (142), and Tod Surmon
(150) are potential top seeds in their divisions.
Sophomore Ed Medina, who was a critical contribu
tor to the Cardinal's most recent win over University of
California at Davis, will compete at 126 pounds after
wrestling at 134 and 150 during different points of the
season. Horpel said Medina is
"capable of having a really good
tournament — he could be a sur
prise."
Also competing will be the four
some of Cardinal freshmen made up
of Scott Chapman (158), Ryan
Barnes (167), Jason Gladden (177)
and Bryan Vaniman (190). Sopho
more Scott Whitt will fill the heavy
weight slot and junior Ramy Saad
will compete at 118 pounds.
In preparation for the tourna

ment, the team upped its practice
intensity earlier in the week and
brought in former Stanford
wrestling coach and world champi
on Dave Schultz for individual tech
nique sessions.
"I think we're ready," said co
captain Jackson. "Under the cir
cumstances, with a lot of injuries
and some problems, I think we're
going to do really well."
The tournament features what
Horpel calls a "hybrid Pac-10," con
sisting of four true Pacific 10
schools and five other West Coast
teams. The top three placewinners
from Pac-lOs in each division auto
matically qualify for the NCAAs,

held in North Carolina in mid-
March. Five wild-card athletes in
the conference are chosen by the
coaches to go as well.
Horpel's main concerns lie with
the wrestlers' individual efforts, as
the overall team standing comes
second. He said the team as a whole
does not have the experience to take
the Pac-10 championship, but he
expects solid performances from all
the athletes.
"I want each athlete to do what
they're capable of doing based on
what I've seen," he said. "The goal
is to qualify as many people as pos
sible for nationals because that's the
most important part of the season."
