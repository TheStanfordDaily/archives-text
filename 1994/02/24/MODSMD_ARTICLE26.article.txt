# Women's hoops tackles Trojans
## Cardinal, USC vie for Pac-10 title 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
The Trojans ride into town tonight. Nothing else
matters.
True, the Cardinal women's basketball team has
won its last five games by an average margin of 29
points, boosting the squad to a 16-5 overall record and
No. 11 in the latest Associated Press poll.
True, Stanford's resurgence has given the team a 9-
3 league record, good enough for second place, and a
two-and-a-half game deficit to USC in an improbable
bid for a sixth-consecutive Pacific 10 Conference crown.
True, the Cardinal owns Maples Pavilion, holding a
10-1 seasonal home record there after last week's
record-setting victory over archrival California.
3ut rankings, records, even homecourt advantage
— these factors will pale to insignificance as Trojan
center Lisa Leslie and Stanford forward Rachel Hem
mer tip off the proceedings this evening.
After all, the Trojans appear to have the upper
hand going into tonight's 7:30 showdown, with a No.
6 ranking, a 19-2 overall record (12-1 in the Pac-10)
and an 11-1 home mark on their resume.
If the numbers don't tell the stoiy, then what does?
In a word, control.
In winning the last five Pac-10 titles, the Cardinal
displayed remarkable consistency, winning every con
ference home game and sweeping USC every time.
Now, the Cardinal stands to prevent the Trojans
from turning the tables and taking their first champi
onship since the Pac-10's inaugural 1986-87 cam
paign. USC already claims an 81-73 win over the Car
dinal from Jan. 30 in Los Angeles, where Leslie scored
a career-high 34 points. The senior conference MVP
favorite averages 22.4 points, 12.3 rebounds and three
blocked shots a contest.
In order to shut down Leslie, and in turn much of
the Trojans' threat, Stanford needs strong perfor
mances from both Hemmer and center Anita Kaplan,
two juniors who together average over 30 points and 14
rebounds a night. Lately, the inside duo has taken
turns leading the Cardinal attack while the other plays
below her capabilities, a trend that continued even in
last Friday's 111-64 blowout of Cal when Kaplan net
ted 22 points and Hemmer a season-low two.
"Rachel and Anita have to take their average game
personally, and step up to a higher level," said Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer. "They have to pay
more attention to Lisa, while not paying less attention

to everyone else."
Should the Cardinal successfully neutralize
USC's "everyone else" includes an impressive inside
outside duo of freshman forward Tina Thompson
(13.8 ppg, 10.4 rpg) and senior point guard Nicky
McCrimmon (11.4 ppg, 6.1 assists per game), who
returns to action after missing two games for her
mother's funeral last week.
