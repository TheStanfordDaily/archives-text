# Men's tennis faces nation's best
## 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
For everyone wondering exactly
how good the Stanford men's tennis
team is, here's where we find out.
The Cardinal travels to
Louisville, Ky. this weekend to com
pete for the U.S. Tennis Associa
tion/Intercollegiate Tennis Associa
tion National Indoor title. The sin
gle elimination tournament, which
runs through Sunday, features 20
of the best teams in the nation,
including the 18 highest-ranked
teams.
While Stanford heads into
Indoors with an 8-0 dual meet
record and a No. 2 national ranking,
it should face team competition like
none it has seen so far this year.
Stanford, as the second seed,
received a first-round bye. Today,
the Cardinal meets the winner of
yesterday's match between No. 13-
ranked University of Alabama-
Birmingham and No. 17 Virginia
Commonwealth. The likely winner
of that match, Alabama, features an
all-foreign lineup and is "very, very
good," according to Stanford head

coach Dick Gould.
"If we play Alabama-Birming
ham, it will definitely be our
toughest match so far this year,"
Gould said.
If Stanford manages to get by
Alabama, it will face the winner of
No. 12-ranked Pepperdine and No. 8
Mississippi.
The Cardinal, however, counters
with incredible depth. For one of the
first times this season, the entire
singles and doubles lineups will be
healthy and ready for competition.
The success of the Stanford team
up and down the ladder is dizzying.
Senior All-American Michael Flana
gan will return atop the Cardinal's
singles lineup. Flanagan, currently
ranked No. 4 nationally in the ITA
collegiate rankings, seems fully
recovered from a sprained wrist.
Sophomore and potential Ail-Amer
ican Jeff Salzenstein, who didn't
give up a set in his brief stint at No.
1, will give way and compete at No.
2 for the Cardinal.
At third singles will be senior Ail-
American Vimal Patel, who was
ranked No. 18 in the ITA preseason
rankings. Senior Robert Devens,

ranked No. 12 in the preseason, will
play at No. 4 after varying levels of
success at the top three spots.
No. 5 singles will feature yet
another Stanford senior All-Ameri
can in the person of Chris Cocotos.
But the Cardinal's lineup doesn't
even yield at the bottom where its
No. 6 singles player, Jim Thomas, is
currently ranked No. 6 nationally
by the ITA.
Doubles will prove to be no easi
er for opposing teams. Stanford's
No. 1 doubles team of Flanagan and
Cocotos was ranked No. 2 in the
preseason rankings. The only team
ranked ahead of Flanagan-Cocotos
was beaten by Stanford's second
best and the ITA's No. 7-ranked
duo of Patel and Salzenstein. At
third doubles will be the competitive
Devens with teammate Grant
Elliott, a freshman.
Other teams in the tournament
include third seed Southern Califor
nia, Texas and Duke at fourth and
fifth, and No. 6 UCLA. The top seed
and No. 1 team in the nation, Geor
gia, is also in attendance as another
prime candidate to take home the
title.
