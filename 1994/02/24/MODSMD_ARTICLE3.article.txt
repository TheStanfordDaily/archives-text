## Retiring Indiana University President Thomas Ehrlich offered teaching position 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
In an effort to entice Indiana University
President Thomas Ehrlich back to Stanford,
the University is offering the former Stanford
Law School dean a package which includes a
teaching position at the school.
Ehrlich, who was dean of the Law School
from 1971 to 1975, announced last August
that he would be stepping down from the Indi
ana University presidency this July.
"We have asked him to teach a course in
public international law," said Law School
Dean Paul Brest. "We knew he was leaving the
presidency, and he is one of the most distin
guished scholars in public international law."
Brest would not comment any further on

the details of the job offer, but confirmed that
the Institute of International Studies is in
volved in planning it.
Brest did say, though, that the institute
would be a "natural place" for Ehrlich because
of his experience in the field of international
law.
Both Ehrlich and Walter Falcon, the direc
tor of the institute, refused to comment.
"The package is open-ended, and we are
waiting for [Ehrlichl to respond back," Brest
said.
The only certainty is that Ehrlich will be
moving back to the West Coast after he leaves
Indiana University, according to Indiana Uni
versity spokesman Jim Green.
"His daughter and sons are all on the West
Coast.... and he said last August that he was

going to live on the West Coast (after stepping
down)," Green said.
However, Green said he had not heard
about the Stanford package and that he did
not know of any other job offers from other
universities.
After leaving Stanford in 1975, Ehrlich be
came the first president of the non-profit or
ganization Legal Services Corporation for
three years. In 1979, he was appointed as the
first director of the International Develop
ment Cooperation Agency, and became
provost of the University of Pennsylvania in
the early 1980s.
"If one could attribute responsibility for
the new law school building, Ehrlich played a
major role," Brest said. "He's a fine teacher
and has had a terrific career."
