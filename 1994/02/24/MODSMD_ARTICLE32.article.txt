# Smashing my TV Joey Rosenblum

### 
The scenario of my most recent pop
culture nightmare: I wake up in a
cold sweat and try to shake the
dreams of Dylan McKay reading his poetry
to me in a small, smoky Beverly Hills cafe. I
attempt to fall back asleep, thinking about
fields of daisies but a nagging question
keeps surfacing in my brain: who will move
next into the apartment at "Melrose Place"?
Unable to sleep, I reach for the remote con
trol and tune into Music Television but my
MTV is so caught up in game shows and in
telli-pop advertising that it refuses to air a sin
gle music video. I scan through all 523 chan
nels but the the only show on is "Mystery Sci
ence Theatre 3000." I pull out a sawed-off
shotgun and blow my TV into oblivion, final
ly falling peacefully back to sleep.
"Why?" I ask myself. "Why is TV so pa
thetic?" Although the answer isn't simple, it
comes down to this: as corporate, adbuck
hungry networks fight for viewshare con
trol, the rapidly mutating figure of the
media looms ugly over the ideals of intellec
tual and aesthetic programming. What this
leaves out is that the media (TV, radio,
print, etc.) play an integral role in shaping
popular culture, in shaping social values

and in initiating social, economic and polit
ical change. And TV is the most persuasive
voice that ever sings you jingles.
I wake up from my pseudo-dream and
say, "Fuck the media." For every ounce of
truth there's a pound of bullshit and a gallon
of advertising. Who can stand to read Time
magazine or Newsweek's spoon-fed mix of
pop-politics and corporate propaganda?
And who wants to watch 39 minutes of actu
al (and generally stupid) programming to
every prune-time hour? And then there's the
great question posed by my new favorite TV
show "Cops": is it live or is it docudrama?
So I've given up on television. Call me a
cynic, but TV in its present incarnation is a
dead or at least dying medium. Network
programming reached an all-time low with
three different yet simultaneous broadcasts
of "The Amy Fisher Story." The radical up
start Fox network is resorting to eye-candy
a-la-MTV techniques to drip their sappy
brand of low-grade acid (uh, I mean pro

gramming) into the hungry veins of today's
teens (uh, I mean Generation X). And Frank
Zappa is dead. Does TV even have hope?
The media in general has become a
voyeuristic, video-clip/sound-byte hungry
monster that wants me to consume, con
sume, consume in a way that will appease
their corporate sponsored, watered-down
version of culture (i.e. "The Real World").
Cut into Court TV mode for exhibit A:
'Jan. 17,1994,6.6 earthquake rocks Los An
geles at 4:31 a.m....' and you know what?
Three weeks later there's a $15 photojour
nal: "4:31, Images of the 1994 L.A. Earth
quake" on sale (that means NOW) at book
stores and newsstands all across the south
land area. That's a pretty quick turnaround
time on production if you ask me. It claims
to be news, but it's a voyeuristic cash-in on
12 million people's tragedy.
Which explains why I'm having an exis
tential dilemma as to my place in a society
which gets its jollies from going in depth

and personal with other people's misfor
tune. When did prime-time and tabloid
journalism become synonymous? Will
MTV enlighten our generation? Or will they
all just continue to get fat off adbucks? En
quiring minds want to know.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying any
thing negative about freedom of press. I
think that a free media is a mandatory condi
tion for a free nation. Irresponsible journal
ism doesn't get me down, it's corporate jour
nalism that peeves me. It's corporate control
of the social context in which 1 live my life
that really drives nails into my flesh. It's the
idea that advertisers can somehow actually
make me feel good about wearing certain
blue jeans or drinking a certain soft-drink.
It's the idea that millions of people think
Dylan is a poet and Rrandon is a role model
and that Oprah isn't a sell-out and that Ger
aldo knows anything and that "A Current
Affair" is a viable source of trustworthy
news and that MTV isn't mainstream. This
is the nightmare that I shake myself awake
from only to find that it's true. And it makes
me wish I actually had a sawed-off shotgun
... only then they'd probably make a minis
eries out of me. â–
