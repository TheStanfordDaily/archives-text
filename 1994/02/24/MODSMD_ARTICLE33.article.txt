## What happens when 'The Next Big Thing' grows up 
### Arnold Pan 
Moments after Teenage Fanclub's tour bus
stops, drummer Brendan O'Hare prances
across rain-soaked 4th Street with his honey,
while band frontman Norman Blake splashes
onto the sidewalk to greet a friend.
An untrained eye would have a hard time
believing these fellows make up the same
Teenage Fanclub who have played on Satur
day Night Live, have been profiled in music
rags around the world and have recorded
three blissful albums of pop melodies. It's dif
ficult to imagine that anyone trying to fit in
seven interviews during a short sound check
are just friendly music lovers who'd just as
soon ask you questions about music as they
would answer yours.
"Do you like Depeche Mode?" drummer
Brendan O'Hare asks with his barely compre
hensible Scottish accent as he strays from the
question posed. "They were always a kind of
a joke in Britain."
A LITTLE HISTORY
Our brief 15-minute interview with
O'Hare begins auspiciously as he offers up his
smokes while lighting one up for himself.
Such actions speak volumes about
Teenage Fanclub. Blake, O'Hare, guitarist
Raymond McGinley and bassist Gerard Love
really are normal folks — albeit normal folks
who have created some of the most delightful
pop songs in recent memory. Just ask the fans
who got a chance to meet and mingle with the
band during two Bay Area performances last
December. Or just ask the band itself.
"There's not really any [problems with
egos]. We're all fans of music and we all like
good tunes," O'Hare says about the group dy
namic. "I don't think you have to sell an
image, though a lot of people think you have
. »
to.
Staying level-headed probably isn't the
easiest thing to do when your music receives
as much acclaim as Teenage Fanclub's has.
With its first album, "A Catholic Education"
(1989), Teenage Fanclub grabbed the atten
tion of the music world, becoming the prize
in a bidding war among the major labels.
Geffen Records won out and won even
bigger when the Glaswegians delivered
"Bandwagonesque," their classic 1991 long
player which left the media everywhere
scrambling for superlatives. Perhaps Spin
outdid the rest by naming it 1991's best *
album. m

With their latest release, "Thirteen,"
the Fannies have continued to add to
their "legend," stirring together the
same ingredients of grinding guitar
hooks, sing-along lyrics and
smirking humor in their song

stew.
Still, these peppy Scots
haven't let all the hoopla
get to their heads.
COPING WITH SUCCESS
"We didn't notice the
push until we came to

America [two and a half years ago]," O'Hare
recalls. "People were kind of going crazy in
some places. We didn't understand it because
we'd never been here before. That kind of
freaked us out.
"Most of it was a media creation. We
would ignore a good review as we would a
bad review. We never really got affected by it.
We never really noticed it. It's just a lot of
people would be saying things."
However, the spotlight has taken some toll
on the band. The promise and burden of be
coming "the next big thing" has forced the
band to meet those expectations head on,
rather than allowing them to take time and
develop at a more natural pace.
"[Geffen] just had the Nirvana thing and
thought 'Maybe we can go with this.' So they
started pushing us," O'Hare says."It would
have been good for us, except it was for their
own reasons, wanting to keep the label look
ing good. So we probably did suffer a bit from
that.
"For us, it's just business as usual. It always
has been. We've just got to do what we've got
to do."
But if it's not one thing, it's another. While
prodding by the record company can be irri
tating, dealing with the press has proven to be
an altogether harrowing experience for
Teenage Fanclub. In some sense, the music
media has found a pop icon in Teenage Fan
club where there really isn't one — especially
in the case of the all-powerful British music
press.
"The thing in Britain is that they just make
stuff up. That's why we tend not to read the
stuff in Britain because it's just nonsense,"
says O'Hare. "It's just some guy who'll ask
you questions. You'll answer them and he'll
just make it up.
"You'll give an answer and he'll print it by
a different question. So it makes it look like
you're saying something else. You might say
'Yes, I really like that' about cheese and he
puts it by 'Do like having sex with donkeys?'"
O'Hare relates by example.
In fact, Teenage Fanclub had stopped giv
ing interviews in Britain for a short period of
time. But out of an allegiance to their fans,
they decided to break their silence, even with

the problems they've had with the British
music magazines.
"We do interviews because people do want
to hear what we say, whether or not what we
say is valid. People out there do want to read
things about us and want to know about us
and what we think about things," O'Hare ex
plains. "You've got to do them from that
point of view."
and, of course, the music ...
In spite of such pressures and hardships,
Teenage Fanclub does have the liberty to
make the kind of music they want. In one
sense, they've been blessed: they never had
their music altered by a hit-making producer
or been forced by the record company to do
anything against their will. For Teenage Fan
club, making good music comes down to one

People [in America] were going crazy in
SOME PLACES. WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT BE
CAUSE WE HAD NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE. THAT
KIND OF FREAKED US OUT.
BRENDAN O'HARE

simple principle: whatever sounds good.
"Sometimes we'll just be sitting around
playing the guitar and think 'That's kind of
cool.' And when it's done, we'll say 'Wow!'
Sometimes we're like, 'That sounds good'
and can't do anything with it and keep on it
for ages. Then, after two weeks, we'll say
'That's awful,"' O'Hare describes the song
writing process. "It's just different every
time."
Moreover, they're an egalitarian bunch,
with all four members contributing songs. As
O'Hare puts it,"it doesn't matter whose song
it is, as long as it's a good song."
What's amazing about Teenage Fanclub
songs is their cohesiveness. From songwriter
to songwriter, song to song, album to album,
they stay true to their delightful mix. Like the
tunes on "A Catholic Education" and "Band
wagonesque," "Thirteen" serves up another
batch of perfect pop songs. Teenage Fanclub
puts a smile on your face

and a melody in your head.
Still, that's not enough to satisfy the critics.
Not that it really matters to Teenage Fan
club. For instance, they've been able to shrug
off the constant claims that they are merely
imitators of the proto-pop band of the '70s,
Big Star. Although it's a compliment to be
compared to a band like Big Star, Teenage
Fanclub clearly has its own sound.
"It's like being compared to the Beatles. If
somebody compared you to the Beatles,
you'd be happy about it. I think [Big Star is] a
great band, though I don't think we necessar
ily sound like them," O'Hare explains.
"As Alex (Chilton, member of Big Star)
said once, 'You can tell that [Teenage Fanclub
has] listened to my band.' Just like he listened
to the Beatles. And you can tell the Beatles lis
tened to Chuck Berry. So it keeps on going

back and back, like an evolutionary kind of
thing. But I think we sound like ourselves
enough."
Others look at the band and scream "cor
porate rock." A bane to some, it's a label
Teenage Fandub can live with. Unlike many
of their college rock counterparts, they ques
tion the authenticity of "indie credibility."
They don't want to be precious. They want to
be heard.
"People like to be elitist. I did it myself.
When more people like [a band], you kind of
go off them," O'Hare says philosophically.
"It's something weird that happens to you.
You try to deny yourself music because once
other people like it, you're not on your own.
"Most independents in Britain are owned
by major record companies, so that's kind of
bullshit. And in America, you need to be on a
major label, I think, or your records don't get
distributed and people don't get to hear
them....l don't know, but indie credibility is a
r '80s for me."

Whether it's answering this
and other criticisms, dealing
with the media or handling the
burdens of their record com
pany, Teenage Fanclub's
members seem to have come
out on top by staying true to
hemselves and to their fans.
Perhaps O'Hare's
bandmate Gerard
Love identifies the
band's philosophy
best when he sings,
"No, you won't leave a
mark on me / I'm
protected by an
honesty." ■

coming "the next big thing" has forced the
band to meet those expectations head on,
rather than allowing them to take time and
develop at a more natural pace.
"[Geffen] just had the Nirvana thing and
thought 'Maybe we can go with this.' So they
started pushing us," O'Hare says."It would
have been good for us, except it was for their
own reasons, wanting to keep the label look
ing good. So we probably did suffer a bit from
that.
"For us, it's just business as usual. It always
has been. We've just got to do what we've got
to do."
But if it's not one thing, it's another. While
prodding by the record company can be irri
tating, dealing with the press has proven to be
an altogether harrowing experience for
Teenage Fanclub. In some sense, the music
media has found a pop icon in Teenage Fan
club where there really isn't one — especially
in the case of the all-powerful British music
press.
"The thing in Britain is that they just make
stuff up. That's why we tend not to read the
stuff in Britain because it's just nonsense,"
says O'Hare. "It's just some guy who'll ask
you questions. You'll answer them and he'll
just make it up.
"You'll give an answer and he'll print it by
a different question. So it makes it look like
you're saying something else. You might say
'Yes, I really like that' about cheese and he
puts it by 'Do like having sex with donkeys?'"
O'Hare relates by example.
In fact, Teenage Fanclub had stopped giv
ing interviews in Britain for a short period of
time. But out of an allegiance to their fans,
they decided to break their silence, even with

the problems they've had with the British
music magazines.
"We do interviews because people do want
to hear what we say, whether or not what we
say is valid. People out there do want to read
things about us and want to know about us
and what we think about things," O'Hare ex
plains. "You've got to do them from that
point of view."
and, of course, the music ...
In spite of such pressures and hardships,
Teenage Fanclub does have the liberty to
make the kind of music they want. In one
sense, they've been blessed: they never had
their music altered by a hit-making producer
or been forced by the record company to do
anything against their will. For Teenage Fan
club, making good music comes down to one

People [in America] were going crazy in
SOME PLACES. WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT BE
CAUSE WE HAD NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE. THAT
KIND OF FREAKED US OUT.
BRENDAN O'HARE

simple principle: whatever sounds good.
"Sometimes we'll just be sitting around
playing the guitar and think 'That's kind of
cool.' And when it's done, we'll say 'Wow!'
Sometimes we're like, 'That sounds good'
and can't do anything with it and keep on it
for ages. Then, after two weeks, we'll say
'That's awful,"' O'Hare describes the song
writing process. "It's just different every
time."
Moreover, they're an egalitarian bunch,
with all four members contributing songs. As
O'Hare puts it,"it doesn't matter whose song
it is, as long as it's a good song."
What's amazing about Teenage Fanclub
songs is their cohesiveness. From songwriter
to songwriter, song to song, album to album,
they stay true to their delightful mix. Like the
tunes on "A Catholic Education" and "Band
wagonesque," "Thirteen" serves up another
batch of perfect pop songs. Teenage Fanclub
puts a smile on your face

and a melody in your head.
Still, that's not enough to satisfy the critics.
Not that it really matters to Teenage Fan
club. For instance, they've been able to shrug
off the constant claims that they are merely
imitators of the proto-pop band of the '70s,
Big Star. Although it's a compliment to be
compared to a band like Big Star, Teenage
Fanclub clearly has its own sound.
"It's like being compared to the Beatles. If
somebody compared you to the Beatles,
you'd be happy about it. I think [Big Star is] a
great band, though I don't think we necessar
ily sound like them," O'Hare explains.
"As Alex (Chilton, member of Big Star)
said once, 'You can tell that [Teenage Fanclub
has] listened to my band.' Just like he listened
to the Beatles. And you can tell the Beatles lis
tened to Chuck Berry. So it keeps on going

back and back, like an evolutionary kind of
thing. But I think we sound like ourselves
enough."
Others look at the band and scream "cor
porate rock." A bane to some, it's a label
Teenage Fandub can live with. Unlike many
of their college rock counterparts, they ques
tion the authenticity of "indie credibility."
They don't want to be precious. They want to
be heard.
"People like to be elitist. I did it myself.
When more people like [a band], you kind of
go off them," O'Hare says philosophically.
"It's something weird that happens to you.
You try to deny yourself music because once
other people like it, you're not on your own.
"Most independents in Britain are owned
by major record companies, so that's kind of
bullshit. And in America, you need to be on a
major label, I think, or your records don't get
distributed and people don't get to hear
them....l don't know, but indie credibility is a
r '80s for me."

Whether it's answering this
and other criticisms, dealing
with the media or handling the
burdens of their record com
pany, Teenage Fanclub's
members seem to have come
out on top by staying true to
hemselves and to their fans.
Perhaps O'Hare's
bandmate Gerard
Love identifies the
band's philosophy
best when he sings,
"No, you won't leave a

Moments after Teenage Fanclub's tour bus
stops, drummer Brendan O'Hare prances
across rain-soaked 4th Street with his honey,
while band frontman Norman Blake splashes
onto the sidewalk to greet a friend.
An untrained eye would have a hard time
believing these fellows make up the same
Teenage Fanclub who have played on Satur
day Night Live, have been profiled in music
rags around the world and have recorded
three blissful albums of pop melodies. It's dif
ficult to imagine that anyone trying to fit in
seven interviews during a short sound check
are just friendly music lovers who'd just as
soon ask you questions about music as they
would answer yours.
"Do you like Depeche Mode?" drummer
Brendan O'Hare asks with his barely compre
hensible Scottish accent as he strays from the
question posed. "They were always a kind of
a joke in Britain."
A LITTLE HISTORY
Our brief 15-minute interview with
O'Hare begins auspiciously as he offers up his
smokes while lighting one up for himself.
Such actions speak volumes about
Teenage Fanclub. Blake, O'Hare, guitarist
Raymond McGinley and bassist Gerard Love
really are normal folks — albeit normal folks
who have created some of the most delightful
pop songs in recent memory. Just ask the fans
who got a chance to meet and mingle with the
band during two Bay Area performances last
December. Or just ask the band itself.
"There's not really any [problems with
egos]. We're all fans of music and we all like
good tunes," O'Hare says about the group dy
namic. "I don't think you have to sell an
image, though a lot of people think you have
. »
to.
Staying level-headed probably isn't the
easiest thing to do when your music receives
as much acclaim as Teenage Fanclub's has.
With its first album, "A Catholic Education"
(1989), Teenage Fanclub grabbed the atten
tion of the music world, becoming the prize
in a bidding war among the major labels.
Geffen Records won out and won even
bigger when the Glaswegians delivered
"Bandwagonesque," their classic 1991 long
player which left the media everywhere
scrambling for superlatives. Perhaps Spin
outdid the rest by naming it 1991's best *
album. m

With their latest release, "Thirteen,"
the Fannies have continued to add to
their "legend," stirring together the
same ingredients of grinding guitar
hooks, sing-along lyrics and
smirking humor in their song

stew.
Still, these peppy Scots
haven't let all the hoopla
get to their heads.
COPING WITH SUCCESS
"We didn't notice the
push until we came to

America [two and a half years ago]," O'Hare
recalls. "People were kind of going crazy in
some places. We didn't understand it because
we'd never been here before. That kind of
freaked us out.
"Most of it was a media creation. We
would ignore a good review as we would a
bad review. We never really got affected by it.
We never really noticed it. It's just a lot of
people would be saying things."
However, the spotlight has taken some toll
on the band. The promise and burden of be
coming "the next big thing" has forced the
band to meet those expectations head on,

Moreover, they're an egalitarian bunch,
with all four members contributing songs. As
O'Hare puts it,"it doesn't matter whose song
it is, as long as it's a good song."
What's amazing about Teenage Fanclub
songs is their cohesiveness. From songwriter
to songwriter, song to song, album to album,
they stay true to their delightful mix. Like the
tunes on "A Catholic Education" and "Band
wagonesque," "Thirteen" serves up another
batch of perfect pop songs. Teenage Fanclub
puts a smile on your face

and a melody in your head.
Still, that's not enough to satisfy the critics.
Not that it really matters to Teenage Fan
club. For instance, they've been able to shrug
off the constant claims that they are merely
imitators of the proto-pop band of the '70s,
Big Star. Although it's a compliment to be
compared to a band like Big Star, Teenage
Fanclub clearly has its own sound.
"It's like being compared to the Beatles. If
somebody compared you to the Beatles,
you'd be happy about it. I think [Big Star is] a
great band, though I don't think we necessar
ily sound like them," O'Hare explains.
"As Alex (Chilton, member of Big Star)
said once, 'You can tell that [Teenage Fanclub
has] listened to my band.' Just like he listened
to the Beatles. And you can tell the Beatles lis
tened to Chuck Berry. So it keeps on going

back and back, like an evolutionary kind of
thing. But I think we sound like ourselves
enough."
Others look at the band and scream "cor
porate rock." A bane to some, it's a label
Teenage Fandub can live with. Unlike many
of their college rock counterparts, they ques
tion the authenticity of "indie credibility."
They don't want to be precious. They want to
be heard.
"People like to be elitist. I did it myself.
When more people like [a band], you kind of
go off them," O'Hare says philosophically.
"It's something weird that happens to you.
You try to deny yourself music because once
other people like it, you're not on your own.
"Most independents in Britain are owned
by major record companies, so that's kind of
bullshit. And in America, you need to be on a
major label, I think, or your records don't get
distributed and people don't get to hear
them....l don't know, but indie credibility is a
r '80s for me."

Whether it's answering this
and other criticisms, dealing
with the media or handling the
burdens of their record com
pany, Teenage Fanclub's
members seem to have come
out on top by staying true to
hemselves and to their fans.
Perhaps O'Hare's
bandmate Gerard
Love identifies the
band's philosophy
best when he sings,
"No, you won't leave a
mark on me / I'm
protected by an
honesty." ■
