# POP GOES BUMP
## STANFORD BAND BRAVES THE WILDS OF THE MUSIC WORLD 
### BY IAN THORSON 
Bump is a band. They play music. Good
music, at that. Three Stanford stu
dents, Chris Fruhauf, Arturo Meuniot
(known as Turtle) and Victor Barclay com
prise the band. Bump started playing at the
Barristers eating club last year and has gone
on to gig at dozens of campus parties and Bay
Area clubs.
Their music is fast and fun to thrash your
head to, even if you don't have long hair. The
speed hietal drum beats and funky bass lines
complement the carefree lyrics. The most
notable aspect of the band is the amount of
fun its members seem to be having on stage
at gigs, grooving to lyrics like "Shake your
rumpa, lick my love pumpa." The band al
ways seems to be having a blast.

Turtle, the junior lead singer, has theories
about lyrics. " 'Heart' and 'soul' are two
words that you can never put into a song," he
says.
However, the band itself is full of heart,
soul and talent. Fruhauf, a senior known as
"Fru," has been pounding the drums for
years and it shows. He rarely misses a beat,
even during the most funky, jazzy riffs. His
true creativity as an artist shines through in
his crowd-wooing solos.
No less of an artist, Vic, the senior bassist,
embodies the essence of funk and rhythm. I ie
slaps and pops his strings so well that one
often leaves a Bump gig humming the bass
lines and forgetting the lyrics. His heavy metal
background shines through this present trend
of funk in his steely, syncopated style.
"You can pop and slap all you want and
still not be funky — just be white as hell," he
says. "True funk is in the rhythm."
Where Vic has rhythm, Turtle has the fire
that turns Bump's gigs into wild, raucous and
sometimes naked thrash fests. At a Xanadu
party he urged Vic and Fru to strip to their
boxers. The inspired crowd followed suit.
During "Shake Your Rumpa," a heavy thrash
song, they bared all and the crowd went bal
listic.
"Most of the crowd was down to their un
derwear," says Vic as he chuckles like Beavis.
"It was cool. We called it the 'strip gig.'"
These three musketeers of rock and roll
will play at the Fdge in Palo Alto fully clothed
Sunday, Feb. 27. Fru will set up his purple
drum set, Vic will plug in his white bass gui
tar and Turtle will shout "Shake Your
Rumpa" on the same stage that has hosted
Faith No More, Meat Beat Manifesto and
Chris Isaak. They are more than excited.
"In 10 years I'll tell my kids," says Turtle

with his eyes lighting up under his purple
corduroy hat. "I played the same club as Faith
No More, Psychefunkapus, Mr. Bungle."
In honor of this weekend's gig, Bump
promises to premiere a new song. Whatever
the final name ends up being, it will be char
acteristically Bump, with funky bass line and
fiery lyrics guaranteed to satisfy the most rig
orous musical standards. The campus awaits.

I went to dinner with Fru, Turtle and Vic
at La Costena in Mountain View. Over hefty
burritos the band spilled nightmare stories of
their worst gig experiences. At the
Chameleon they were not only the entertain
ers but the targets of random projectiles.
"Nothing big or sharp," says Fru of the ob
jects that were thrown. "Pieces of paper, bot
tle caps."
They also spoke of a horrible experience at
the Boomerang in San Francisco. The micro
phones were ungrounded so that whenever
Turtle's lips approached the mike too closely
a spark of blue light zapped him, causing to

yell "Gad-fuk-AHH!" over the speakers at
the crowd.
"These were no nine volt twitches, they
were heavy shocks," says Turtle, shaking his
head in memory of the pain.
Sitting with the band (filling my stomach
with good Mexican grub) I realized the rea
son Bump's members sound so good live at
gigs: they are all good friends and care about
each other a great deal. This relationship al
lows them to communicate musically to each
other when on stage. If one person misses a
beat or changes the rhythm of a song slightly
the others will go with him to re-establish
harmony.
"That's what the song 'Becoming' is
about, not wanting to change or control
other people but to harmonize with them,"
Turtle says.
Like good friends, the band members
don't seem to try to control or change each
other, but maintain a general sense of har
mony. They hit each other, call each other
"stoners" and talk about their girlfriends.
In that joking manner they talk of many

Sarah Harrigan—Daily
things. But when it comes to their fear of
staying in the weekday nightclub gig rut, they
get serious.
"It's like a catch-22," says Fru. "People
don't come to weekday night club gigs to
watch us play and clubs won't invite you back
unless people come to watch. It's depressing."
Yet they hope the Edge gig will turn things
around. Vic adds, "We'll be able to tell other
clubs that we've headlined at the Edge. That
should throw some weight. Maybe the
Warfield will book us!"
Regardless of the impact of the Edge show
on Bump's already-illustrious career, the im
pact on the audience will, no doubt, be huge.
This Sunday fans will wade through four
other acts to get to the savory sounds of
Bump. When the wait is over the crowd will,
as always, go wild. ■

Hump will be playing at the Edge with Stanford
hands Young Orpheus, Occam's Razor, Shag
Wagon and Green Room on Sunday, Feb. 27.
All proceeds from ticket sales will go to benefit
the Stanford/East Palo Alto summer program.
