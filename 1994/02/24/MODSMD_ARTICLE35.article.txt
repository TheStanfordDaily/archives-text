## Battle of the Bands features Stanford's best new music talent 
### 
What other event is sure to capture the atten
tion of adulating fans, casual onlookers,
drinkers and other assorted enthusiasts?
Nothing other than the annual Phi Kappa Psi Battle of
the Bands, of course. On March 5, five bands — Gen
eral Sherman, Towhead, Bump, Rerun and Faraway
Moses — will converge in Toyon Hall to deliver a night
of dynamic live performances. The bands will be
judged by a panel of campus music experts and the
winner will be awarded cash prizes. A special bonus
for the best original work will be a performance and
interview on KZSU's Wednesday Night Live radio
show at 9 p.m.

The event is unique because it allows
bands to play outside the standard college
band fare of time-tested favorites. Every
one's heard the basic nondescript cover
band play these songs. While they can be fun
to dance to at a party, endless identical ren
ditions of "Brown Eyed Girl" and "So Lone
ly" can become brain-deadeningly dull.
Campuses across the country are famous
for this type of party band. However, college
also traditionally breeds slackers and dis
contents who are willing to challenge main

by these musicians bored with the standard
ized, mainstream styles. Such was the case
in the mid-'Bos, when groups like R.E.M.,
the Smiths, and 10,000 Maniacs invented a
new style of melodic guitar-rock that has
since become synonymous with "college
music."
However, "college music" extends far be
yond the limited boundaries of "jangle
pop." There are thousands of virtually un
known college bands whose experimenta
tion attracts few mainstream listeners. In

stream pop mentalities. Often, the musical
ly inclined will collect into bands whose
taste has fallen outside brainless top-40 pop
and rock into more esoteric genres such as
funk, hardcore, industrial, noise-pop, or the
ever-popular speed flamenco hip-hop.
New, inventive styles of music are created

terested students at other colleges around
the nation collect recordings of these
groups, and take advantage of low-wattage
campus radio stations to publicize their ef
forts. While these campus stations rarely
achieve the widespread popularity of com
mercial radio, they attract devoted listeners

throughout their local community.
Here at Stanford, most partygoers are
more interested in a good disc jockey or a
fun cover band than a band with unfamiliar
songs and styles. Many of Stanford's origi
nal groups are forced into playing crowd
pleasing Rush covers at beer-sodden frat
parties.
The creative success of Stanford bands
depends on opportunities to play their orig
inal material. For example, the Battle of the
Bands' winner's spot on KZSU's Wednesday
Night Live will reach a large receptive audi
ence in the South Bay area. Battle of the
Bands itself, where the focus is on the bands
and not the beer, is a prime example of an
opportunity to hear campus bands on their
own terms. Music lovers interested in expe
riencing original sounds should go to the
Battle and check it out for themselves.
Early pop, Faraway Moses style
Before genres like grunge and hip-hop
came to such widespread popularity, a more
mellow pop sound characterized college
music. Simple but catchy chord progres
sions and upbeat rhythms describe the early
sound of bands like Big Star and R.E.M.
College music had its roots in these bands,
and some continue to carry the torch of col
lege pop. Campus favorite Faraway Moses
manages to recall the best of early college
pop and still forge their own unique sound.
The threesome has been together since
their freshman year, playing campus venues
to increased recognition. The band even has
groupies now, and for good reason — the
music is laden with soothing pop melodies,
matched with a surprising groovy bass. Rob

lyrics. Eldridge's song "She'll Get By" is a
prime example: "And there beside her, she
still sees him so very clear / And deep inside
her she still needs him, but he's no longer
there."
So where did the name come from? El
dridge said Faraway Moses was a minor
character from Mark Twain's "Innocence
Abroad." Favorite book? "No," he said. "I
just thought it would be a cool band name."
So much for literary profundity.
With the Beatles and the Smiths as major
influences, the band's music tends to sound,
as Whitlock puts it, "pretty damn mellow."
Perfect for CoHo gigs, but the threesome
sees more in the future. A couple demos are
out, and the band hopes to land some off
campus gigs this summer. With a sound that
mirrors classic college pop, they should have
great things in their future. For now, catch
their groovy melodies here on campus and
let Faraway Moses soothe your soul.
Rerun flips the rewind switch
Ah, the '70s. A surprisingly resilient
decade of classic sitcoms, enduringly hip
fashions, and unrelentingly funky music.
I hey were years of polyester and platform
shoes, years of free love, years of bad hair
days. We tried to forget they ever happened
in the '80s, but now in the '90s, the '70s are
back in force. And the funky 12-piece band
Rerun is out to prove that they are here to
stay.
With a six-piece horn section, a guitar
player, a bass player, a drummer, percussion
ist and two singers, Rerun is a musical force
to be reckoned with. But they are anything
but intimidating.
"We're a friendly, open band," said drum
mer Dave Hannigan. They do pack quite a
punch, though. "We're basically a big sound
with a good groove that anyone can dance
to," he added.

Whitlock plays
both acoustic and
electric guitars,
and his impres
sive vocal work
begs comparison
with Michael
Stipe. Ethan El
dridge provides
harmony and the
recurring funky
bass. With Joe
Vimura on
drums, the three
friends manage
to create a sooth
ing and upbeat
sound.
Faraway
Moses took the
standard begin
ning route as a
cover band, but
they soon began

to write their own songs. Now, Eldridge and
Whitlock have written enough material to
fill their set with originals.
The subject of their songs? "Women,"
they said with a laugh. Break-ups and other
woes of past relationships abound in their

central part of the Rerun experience tha
the band is considering bringing TV sets or
stage to give its audience the ultimate '70
show.
General Sherman: Primus-influenced
Some of you may remember Genera
Sherman's beginnings last year as th<
world's only Primus cover band. Sine*
then, they've traded Les Claypools' song:
for their own and changed the band fron
an intriguing project to a full-time affair.
The three members of General Shermar
— Spencer Looney on drums and vocals
Jack Dunham on bass and vocals, and Marl
Danielson on guitar — are old-timers ir
the small and sometimes incestuous Stan

ford music scene. Danielson played
previously with Prime Mover and
Earshot, while Looney and Dunham
were both members of Pufferfish when
General Sherman began.
They had all been friends before the
band's inception and wanted to play
together. However, lacking any original
material to play, they decided to play
all Primus covers while they compiled
enough original songs to fill an entire
set.
For those who are unfamiliar with
Primus, the band has a unique sound
characterized by vigorous, difficult
percussive bass-playing and heavy,
complicated drumming. The members
of General Sherman said playing
Primus songs wasn't easy, but it helped
improve their respective musical abili
ties.
When asked why they chose Primus,
they replied that all three members had
a common interest in the band and that
it was just something fun to do for a
while. Playing Primus material is not a
trivial undertaking; however, General
Sherman handled it well, mastering the
distinctive Primus hooks and adding a
little of its own flavor to the songs.
Their original songs, however, aren't
very Primus-esque. For the most part,
General Sherman plays an interesting
combination of riffy college rock and
funk with a big reggae influence via the
Police. Looney, who handles about half
of the group's songwriting, admits to
being a big Police fan. "Can you hear
the Stewart Copeland in his drum
ming?" asked Dunham.
The other members claim major in
fluences are from Rush, Faith No More
and fIREHOSE. Their music, however,
sounds rather original, ranging from
wah-soaked funk to thrashy, bouncy
numbers, interspersed with ska sec
tions and the occasional capable guitar
solo.
Having played together for only a
year, General Sherman has 14 original
songs — enough for an hour-long set.
For the difficult Stanford party scene,
however, the band fills out its own

In a one-word analysis, Hannigan de
scribed the band's shound as "funkalicious."
loey Rosenblum's groovy wah-wah guitar
sound and Vip "Viper" Soni's fine, smooth
bass complement the solid horn section.
Stan Brobson, singer and occasional band
scout (he's in Czechoslovakia now, scouring
the famed Czech funk scene for new mem
bers) serves the band well with co-vocalist
Megan Blake.
The majority of their set consists of cov
ers from seminal '70s artists like Chase,
Tower of Power and Stevie Wonder. A few
choice Bee Gees hits are always crowd
pleasers. "We're basically mining the gold
that is '70s music," Hannigan said.
Future plans consist of some originals
that should "sound like they may be 20
years old" and some '70s TV show favorites
(Sanford and Son, etc.). Rerun's focus is on
having fun and grooving, and their neglect
ed funk covers from the '70s are a surprise
hit at any party.
The band's size also allows them to bring
their own groovy scene to its gigs complete
with retro garb. "We're our own roving mu
sical party," said Hannigan. Pre-party ritu
als include loading up on '70s sitcom re
runs. Shows like "What's Happening" (the
character from which provided the band's
name) and "Three's Company" are such a

songs with covers of Police and Rush songs,
and of course, Primus. The members have
recently ventured out to San Francisco as
well, playing slots at Morty's and The
Boomerang on Haight Street. General
Sherman is currently recording a demo at
the Knoll.
Towhead, featured in the Jan. 20 edition
of Intermission, and Bump, featured this
issue, will also be performing. Together, the
five bands offer a saucy mix of sonic deliri
um. Five bands enter, one emerges. Find
out March 5. ■


Faraway Moses
If there's a college band
here on campus that
plays "college music,"
it's this trio. Drawing
on influences like the
Beatles and the Smiths,
Faraway Moses plays
the kind of pop you
hear on the radio. Lead
singer Rob Whitlock's
"Stipe-esque" voice
doesn't hurt either.


Rerun
Based on sheer size, this twelve-piece funk
outfit overwhelms just about any band out
side of the LSJUMB. As you might expect,
they feature a big, big sound, boosted by six
piece horn section. If it's the '70s you like,
you'll dig Rerun.


General Sherman
With the lofty title of the world's only
Primus cover band behind them, General 1
Sherman looks to move on with original ma
terial. The three man band shows off a nice
mix of hook-laden rock with reggae and
bouncing funk sounds.
