"The Scent of Green Papaya" chronicles 10
years in the life of Mui (Lu Man San), a peas
ant girl raised as a servant in a prosperous
household in 1950s Saigon.
Vietnamese writer/director Tran Anh
Hung takes time to smell the papaya — and
more — in this scattered but hypnotically
beautiful first film, winner of the Camera
d'Or at last year's Cannes Film Festival.
As seen through Mui's eyes, "The Scent of
Green Papaya" takes place almost entirely
within the confines of her masters' homes,
beginning with her arrival at a fantastic
open-air mansion hung with ghostly mos
quito nets.
Thi (Nguyen Anh Hoa), an older house
maid, gently initiates young Mui in the pa
tient art of servitude. But behind the daily rit
uals of washing, cooking and sewing, we al
ready see evidence of unravelling. The green
tinted veneer of domestic comfort can't hide
the fact that there's something terribly wrong
with this picture.
Father never leaves the house; Grand
mother never leaves the attic. The family's
youngest son treats Mui as cruelly as his
child's mind knows how, while his brother
devises horrific methods of torturing the in
sects that crawl through the house. Is this
the ennui of wealth, or something more sin
ister?
Furthermore, nobody can help noticing
that Mui is the same age the family's only
daughter would have been, if she hadn't died
under mysterious circumstances several
years earlier. A coincidence or ominous har
binger of further tragedy?
Only Mother (Truong Thi Loc) seems to
know, and she's not telling. Instead, she lives
in determined denial, carrying on business as

usual when even Mui suspects the awful
truth. But Mother's desperate attempts to
keep the family together ultimately prove
self-defeating. The forces working against
her are simply too strong.
Ten years later, grown-up Mui (Tran Yen-
Khe) has a new master — handsome, sophis
ticated Khuyen (Vuong Hoa Hoi), the object
of a lingering childhood crush. Though she
remains almost mute, Mui fairly glows with
deluded happiness.
Any sinister overtones have been pushed
outside Khuyen's ultra-modern bachelor
bungalow, which we never leave. The shrill
siren of crickets has been replaced by the
scream of war planes and the curfew whistle.
Mui has emerged, Cinderella-like, from
her cocoon. The film starts over as a kind of
fairy tale, giving Mui a chance to break away
from the destructive patterns she's left be
hind and demonstrate what she's learned.
The scenes in Khuyen's house delicately
trace a tradition of silent seduction almost
alien to American film. In one, Mui dips her
toe into one of the fiance's pumps, then
quickly reconsiders, retracting it. Later, she
wiggles into Khuyen's roomy shoes, and then
the fine slippers Mother gave her as a parting
gift.
These moments are the visual and themat -
ic pegs on which Tran hangs his web of illu
sion. Languid tracking shots expand the sun
lit interiors to infinity, making poetry of
peaceful domestic details.
Tran's camera acts as both voyeur and
vivisectionist, zeroing in with patient but
detached curiosity on a drop of papaya juice
on a leaf, an ant struggling to carry off a
piece of rice, the lumpy insides of a green
papaya. Awash in Tran's soft watercolor

palette, the house always seems cool and
shady despite the oppressive heat of the
Saigon summer.
Though lovely to look at, "The Scent of
Green Papaya" lacks a central theme, abrupt

ly jumping from decade to decade, house to
house. Equal parts love story, family drama
and coming-of-age tale, it triggers emotional
ripples without ever making a splash.
