You don't need to be a hard-core basketball
fan to enjoy and appreciate the power of di
rector William Freidkin's "Blue Chips." While
knowledge of the game allows for recognition
of the many college and NBA players and
coaches scattered throughout the film, the
film focuses on the ethics of recruiting.

Nick Nolte is al
most too perfect as
the over-stressed,
ranting, going-to
have-a-heart attack
any-day coach Pete
Bell of Western Uni
versity. As the proto
typic out-of-control
basketball coach, he
is the kind that the
opposing team's
fans love to heckle.
Faced with his
first losing season
ever, Bell is well
aware of the pres
sure by local media
and alumni to
somehow "pro-

duce" a squad worthy of the two national
championship banners hanging in the gym.
He takes recruiting trips in search of "Blue
Chippers," played by Anfernee Hardaway,
Matt Nover and Shaquille O'Neal.
Shaq is surprisingly adept as the sarcastic,
rather clueless Neon Bodeaux, who is gifted
with a mean dunk. Teammates Hardaway
and Nover play believable characters, but
their real talents lie in their basketball skills.
Vowing never to get involved in under the
table recruiting, Bell refuses to acknowledge
the requests by the recruits' parents for a new
tractor and a house with a lawn. He wants
desperately to recruit cleanly. It is not until
N'over's Ricky Roe nonchalantly demands
$30,000 in "one of those gym bags" that Bell
finally gives in. He allows the "friends of the
program" to do whatever it takes to get the
players to sign. And of course they do.
What follows is a lot of riveting well
filmed basketball interspersed with scenes of
Bell's utter anguish and guilt at having cheat
ed. Can he live with having "produced" the
team in an unfair way?
If anything, "Blue Chips" is a compelling
movie about a moral issue that must be ad
dressed. Even more, Nolte's passionate per
formance and Shaquille's dunks will enrap
ture any audience.
