# Body Snatchers
## 
### 
The scream is what stays with you.
Sure, "Body snatchers" was a pitiful
movie, disappointing in countless ways. Bad
editing. Typical camera work. God-awful
writing. Clichdd, slimy, tentacled alien
beasts. Poor use of a military helicopter. The
list of faults is finite but long.
Ah, but the scream. T'was exquisite. If you
weren't so jaded, you would've had night
mares. Here's how it works:
The body snatchers are invading your
planet. You are a beautiful desperado
(Gabrielle Anwar) all alone. Actually, cancel
that. You are a beautiful desperado with a
beautiful desperado boyfriend, who, luckily
enough, is the pilot of an Apache helicopter.
You are on your way to escape when a bodys
natching fiendish alien spots you. The
fiendish alien then points at you and wails
like Kurt Cobain on speed.
This is the scream. It is not the lamenting
shriek of a one-heeled bimbo. It is not even
the yelp of a serial killer who's having a real
good time. It is the massive siren-shriek of a
bodysnatcher. And it doesn't stop. The
scream just keeps going and going. It's pretty
cool actually.
After I watched the movie, I practiced

non-stop screaming, hut it gets to hurt. So
then I sat and listened to a Mariah Carey
album, but it wasn't the same.
Don't rent this movie. Your piddly dorm
TV won't do the scream justice. You need the
big screen, with big sound for proper effect.
This is the only worthy thing about the
movie, and you don't want to blow four
bucks for nothing.
This "Body satchers" is the second re
make of Jack Finney's novel, which Abel Fer
rara (of "Bad Lieutenant" fame) directs. But
the brutal poetry of "Bad Lieutenant" is lost
here. The creepy possibility of an insidious
takeover of the world is lost to cheap thrills
and simple plotting. If you're in the mood
for this sort of thing, I hear "The X Files" is
a good show.
