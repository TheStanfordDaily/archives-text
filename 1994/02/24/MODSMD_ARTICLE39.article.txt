# The
						original 'original gangsta'
## Hip hop's bad lieutenant strikes back 
### 
Before Ice-T killed cops, before N.W.A.
rolled straight outta Compton and into sub
urbia, before the Geto Boys' minds played
tricks on them and long before Dr. Dre and
Snoop Doggy Dogg proclaimed that bitches
weren't shit, Schooly D embodied the essence
of hardcore hip-hop. A Fila-wearing, gold
chain-sporting, West Philly-living rapper,
Schooly D defined gangsta long before the
noun was ever broken.
But being a pioneer has never guaranteed
success or everlasting fame — just ask
Christopher Columbus or Jelly Roll Morton,
respectively. Despite signing with Capitol
Records after two self-produced indepen
dent albums, Schooly D still hasn't managed
to capture the hearts, minds or wallets of the
mainstream.
His rap style — a profane mixture of sto
rytelling, signifying, cursing and lyrical ser
ial killing — is carried by a gravel smooth
voice that suggests at once focused intensity
and "I-don't-give-a-fuck" cool. Even Oak
land rapper Too Short, whose anatomically
and scatologically precise rhymes most ap
proximate Schooly's own, can't duplicate
the distinctive laid-back swagger believably.
But so far, listeners have been more than
willing to accept all substitutes — and it
seems unlikely that Schooly D's latest album,
"Welcome to America," will do anything to
change that.
From the moment he recorded his self-ti
tled 1986 debut, Schooly D's vision of the
land of the free and the home of the brave has
been essentially nihilistic. And like America
herself, the vision keeps getting worse.
"I Wanna Get Dusted," the album's open

ing track, is a pathetic, dirge-like ode to the
scourge of crack. By telling it from the point
of view of a knight of the living baseheads
who wants to keep getting high, Schooly D
takes us further into the addict's heart of
darkness than any "This is your brain on
drugs" commercial ever could.
He follows that track with "I Know You
Want to Kill Me," a song whose overt martyr
complex belies its author's suicidal tenden
cies. Riffing competently on Ice Cube's
"When Will They Shoot" and"The Nigga Ya
Love to Hate," Schooly D rages against an il
lusory machine of censors — President Clin
ton, Arsenio Hall, Bill Cosby, the FBI, the
KKK and the NAACP — all of whom he feels
are trying to shut him down. Unfortunately,
the tale is hardly true — if it were, the resul
tant controversy would have huped him sell
more records than the few that he's sold to
date.
The rest of the songs — with such titles as
"Gimme Your Shit Nigga," "I Shot Da Bitch"
and "No Good Nigga" — are pointless exer
cises in bitch-baiting, gun-toting, forty-swill
ing machismo. On the opening of "Niggas
Like Me," a sista who's tired of Schooly's dis
respect for the fairer sex asks him if he knows
the difference between a bitch and a black
woman. Answers Schooly: "About a blow
job." I le then cues a chorus of sistas to sing the
praises of his prodigious "member" and fan
tasize about what they would do with it.
Musically, the only song that even ap
proaches the profane brilliance of the Zep
pelin guitar lick-driven "Signifying Rapper"
— expertly used by bad boy director Abel
Ferrara in "Bad Lieutenant" — is titled "I

Shot Da Bitch." A bottom-heavy bassline,
backed by an insidious siren and a hypnotic
guitar are all undermined by Schooly D's
mindless chorus of "It's all about the moth
erfuckin' pussy."
"Welcome to America" is Exhibit A in the
case to prove that Schooly's never-thriving

career is in complete free-fall. At least in "Bad
Lieutenant," Harvey Keitel was fortunate
enough to have some people roll up on him
with a twelve-gauge and put him out of his
misery. Schooly D, it seems, won't be that
lucky.

The newest album by Schooly D doesn't match up to his previous work. Some songs
make you wish he'd disappear.
