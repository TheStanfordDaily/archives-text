# Task force plans consolidation of language depts.
## 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
Stanford's five foreign lan
guage and literature programs
will likely be consolidated into one
or two new departments, despite
cries for autonomy from some stu
dents, faculty and staff members.
A task force convened by Hu
manities and Sciences Senior
Assoc. Dean John Etchemendy
has been working with depart
mental administrators to develop
a plan that will combine some or
all aspects of the Asian Lan
guages, French and Italian, Ger
man Studies, Slavic Languages,
and Spanish and Portuguese De
partments.
The Comparative Literature
Department may also become part

of the new configuration.
The task force, which meets
this afternoon, was formed in Oc
tober to oversee the changes,
which are part of the school's con
tribution to the University's bud
get reduction process.
"We're facing serious financial
constraints," Etchemendy said.
"Right now we're making certain
reductions in parts of H&S to
allow for innovations in other
areas."
The changes are being planned
regardless of the findings of the
Commission on Undergraduate
Education, which is reviewing the
University foreign language re
quirement. The task force hopes
its changes will put the depart
ments in a good place to imple
ment the commission's recom
mendations, Etchemendy said.
"The task force is in a very
delicate stage trying to find
some plan that represents a mid
dle ground," said Prof. Theodore
Andersson, the chair of the Ger
man Studies Department who
also serves on the committee.
"There will be elements of con
solidation and elements of inde
pendence."
But even these moderate
goals have some in the depart
ments worried.
"Like most other depart
ments, we think we're doing
pretty well as things are, and
we're not too happy about the
creation of one huge depart
ment," said Prof. Michael Pred
more, Spanish and Portuguese
Department chair and task force
member.
"There's a lot of panic out
there," said Prof. Ralph Hester,
chair of the French and Italian
Department, adding that he'll be
meeting with graduate students
concerned about the future of
their department later this week
to discuss the changes.
A confederation of national
language and literature depart
ments would be difficult to run,
said Sylvia Wohlmut, depart
ment administrator for both the
French and Italian Department
and the Spanish and Portuguese
Department.
"I can speak from the staff
point of view that there can be
some savings at the expense of
cutting down on staff,"
Wohlmut said.
"But each language and liter
ature department has a distinct
way of acting and of getting
things done, and it's difficult to
expect all of them to be able to
be run in the same way."
Last year, the Spanish and
Portuguese Department and the
French and Italian Department
merged administratively, leav
ing Wohlmut to manage both.
The change has been "hard on
the staff," she said.
Beyond the dangers of over
burdening staff and neglecting
students, some claim the merger
may present logistical night

mares.
"We're so spread out now, it
would be difficult to merge as
three of us are over in the
[Wilbur modules] and two of us
in the Quad," said Wohlmut. "I
would think a merger would be
accompanied by some sort of
guarantee that we'd be placed
back in one area."
Since the Quad's language
corner, damaged in the Loma
Prieta Earthquake, will not be
restored for at least a year, Pred
more agreed that housing the
newly created departments may
be a problem.
One of the questions the task
force will address is whether or
not the Comparative Literature
Department belongs in any of
the merged departments, Ander
sson said.
Saying there is a "reasonable
likelihood" that comparative lit
erature would consolidate with
the foreign language and litera
ture departments, department
chair Jeff Schnapp said the
impact of his program's partici
pation would "depend on the
confederation."
If the departments merge
into a format of area studies, for
example, there is no place for
the Comparative Literature
Department, Schnapp said. "A
foreign literature program,
however, may formalize the
work we're already doing," he
added.
The changes may help
Etchemendy balance the load of
departments he oversees, which
will grow substantially when
H&S converts from a five-dean
to a four-dean administration
system next year.
Etchemendy's new position
"would be much easier if there
were a simplified structure" of
foreign language and literature
departments, Andersson said, as
a change would lessen the num
ber of individual units he will
supervise.
Several department heads
applauded Etchemendy's
responsiveness in creating the
task force and avoiding "admin
istrative dictums," as Hester
said.
While the task force had
hoped to have a preliminary
report by April, if a more com
plex plan is adopted it may take
all summer to thoroughly
design, Etchemendy said.

"Right now we're making certain
reductions in parts of H&S to
allow for innovations in other
areas."
The changes are being planned
regardless of the findings of the
Commission on Undergraduate
Education, which is reviewing the
University foreign language re
quirement. The task force hopes
its changes will put the depart
ments in a good place to imple
ment the commission's recom
mendations, Etchemendy said.
"The task force is in a very
delicate stage trying to find
some plan that represents a mid
dle ground," said Prof. Theodore
Andersson, the chair of the Ger
man Studies Department who
also serves on the committee.
"There will be elements of con
solidation and elements of inde
pendence."
But even these moderate
goals have some in the depart
ments worried.
"Like most other depart
ments, we think we're doing
pretty well as things are, and
we're not too happy about the
creation of one huge depart
ment," said Prof. Michael Pred
more, Spanish and Portuguese
Department chair and task force
member.
"There's a lot of panic out
there," said Prof. Ralph Hester,
chair of the French and Italian
Department, adding that he'll be
meeting with graduate students
concerned about the future of
their department later this week
to discuss the changes.
A confederation of national
language and literature depart
ments would be difficult to run,
said Sylvia Wohlmut, depart
ment administrator for both the
French and Italian Department
and the Spanish and Portuguese
Department.
"I can speak from the staff
point of view that there can be
some savings at the expense of
cutting down on staff,"
Wohlmut said.
"But each language and liter
ature department has a distinct
way of acting and of getting
things done, and it's difficult to
expect all of them to be able to
be run in the same way."
Last year, the Spanish and
Portuguese Department and the
French and Italian Department
merged administratively, leav
ing Wohlmut to manage both.
The change has been "hard on
the staff," she said.
Beyond the dangers of over
burdening staff and neglecting
students, some claim the merger
may present logistical night

mares.
"We're so spread out now, it
would be difficult to merge as
three of us are over in the
[Wilbur modules] and two of us
in the Quad," said Wohlmut. "I
would think a merger would be
accompanied by some sort of
guarantee that we'd be placed
back in one area."
Since the Quad's language
corner, damaged in the Loma
Prieta Earthquake, will not be
restored for at least a year, Pred
more agreed that housing the
newly created departments may
be a problem.
One of the questions the task
force will address is whether or
not the Comparative Literature
Department belongs in any of
the merged departments, Ander
sson said.
Saying there is a "reasonable
likelihood" that comparative lit
erature would consolidate with
the foreign language and litera
ture departments, department
chair Jeff Schnapp said the
impact of his program's partici
pation would "depend on the
confederation."
If the departments merge
into a format of area studies, for
example, there is no place for
the Comparative Literature
Department, Schnapp said. "A
foreign literature program,
however, may formalize the
work we're already doing," he
added.
The changes may help
Etchemendy balance the load of
departments he oversees, which
will grow substantially when
H&S converts from a five-dean
to a four-dean administration
system next year.
Etchemendy's new position
"would be much easier if there
were a simplified structure" of
foreign language and literature
departments, Andersson said, as
a change would lessen the num
ber of individual units he will
supervise.
Several department heads
applauded Etchemendy's
responsiveness in creating the
task force and avoiding "admin
istrative dictums," as Hester
said.
While the task force had
hoped to have a preliminary
report by April, if a more com
plex plan is adopted it may take
all summer to thoroughly
design, Etchemendy said.
