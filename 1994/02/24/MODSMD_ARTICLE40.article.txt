# "Souvlaki" Slowdive

1 ley, I like the British sound as much as the
next gal. Erasure was my first concert. I own a
Depeche Mode album. Hut Slowdive? Who?
I douht their second release, "Souvlaki,"
will thrust Slowdive, hailing from Reading,
England, into the limelight of America's
music scene. While "Souvlaki" does provide
some refreshing alternative music to combat
the unrelenting grunge sound on the radio,
I'd give them a few more album tries to culti
vate their distinct, ambient style.
On "Souvlaki," their second LP, psyche
delic guitars melt into one another as ethere
al, abstract vocals create a sound environ-

ment which calls to
mind images of rain
showers and chilled
winds. Often the
drums are the only
distinguishable in
strument as Slowdive
weaves mood music
to simultaneously
soothe and excite
you. Though their
lyrics are often unin
telligible, the vocals

can end up functioning as a complementary
instrument to the soundscape effect, like on
"Sing," one of the successful ambient pieces.
Unfortunately, on most tracks, Slowdive
goes too heavy on the synthesizers and elec
tronic manipulation. On some, like "40
Days" and "Souvlaki Space Station," their
layers of sound crash horrendously into a
mountain of annoying, whiny noise. The
lyrics are another blemish on the CD, which,
when understandable, seem shallow.
Slowdive collaborated with Brian Eno, a
keyboardist who has worked with David
Bowie and U2, on "Sing" (which Eno co
wrote) and "Here She Comes," a melodic,
crystalline ballad which exemplifies Slow
dive's needed attempt to balance their talent
for soundscape with a more song-based style.
"Dagger" also thankfully deviates from the
overall sound-wash of the CD, and focuses on
simple, coherent lyrics and an acoustic guitar
sound. The hit single in the United Kingdom
"Alison" is perhaps the finest example of the
group's mix of soundscape and pop song.
So, go on, grab "Souvlaki" as one of those
"8 firee CDs for a penny" when you join Co
lumbia House, or pick it up at a used CD
store. Then give it a couple weeks. Slowdive
has to grow on you, but when they finally hit
it, you can say you discovered them when
they were nobodies.
