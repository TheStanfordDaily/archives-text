# "August and Everything After" Counting Crows
## 
### 
1 las a young rock band ever been as richly
deserving of popular success as Berkeley's
Counting Crows? Just four months since its re
lease, the Crows' phenomenal debut album
"August and Everything After" has cracked the
top-10 in album sales, catapulting the band
into the mainstream pop spotlight, including
a gig on "Saturday Night Live" in January.
But the Crows have earned such recogni
tion the old-fashioned way — not through
contrived marketing scams but by word of
mouth, critical acclaim and lovely, intelli
gent songwriting. Simply put, "August and
Everything After" is one of the best roots
rock debuts to emerge in the last decade.
The tracks on "August" are like lilting
drugs that remain in the listener's head and
CD player. The debate among the wide audi
ence that has bought the album is not over
whether the songs here are good, but which
is the best.
The vote here is for "Anna Begins," a se
ductive, bluesy reflection on a relationship
that has entered that awkward, do-you
want-commitment phase. "My friend as

sures me / it's all or nothing," lead singer
Adam Duritz sings in a raspy, commanding
voice that others spend whole careers devel
oping. While initially he sings, "I am not
worried, I am not overly concerned." Duritz
admits as the song rises to a chiming chorus
filled with rich three-part harmony "I'm not
ready for this sort of thing."
That kind of twenty-something neurosis
is expressed throughout the album, especial
ly on the two lovelorn ballads, "Perfect Blue
Buildings" and "Raining in Baltimore." But
the Crows don't let that lyrical brooding get
in the way of their solid rock sensibilities and
penchant for cutting loose a bit. "I belong in
the service of a queen / I belong anywhere
but in between," Duritz wails on "Rain
King," as the rhythm section kicks jauntily
behind him in a tune that seems to come
straight off R.E.M.S "Life's Rich Pageant."
What remains to be seen is whether this
superb, restless band can deal with unex
pected popularity as brilliantly as a group
like Nirvana, or whether the spoils of success
will make them little more than a souped-up
Crowded House. For now, one thing is cer
tain. On the album's irresistible first single,
"Mr. Jones," Duritz sings somewhat disin
genuously that "Mr. Jones and me / We're
gonna be big stars." For the best reasons,
Counting Crows already are.
