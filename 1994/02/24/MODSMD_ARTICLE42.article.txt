# Affordable ambrosia and psychedelic sauces
## Why go to Berkeley when Siam Royal is down the street? 
### Nick Peters 
The first time we dined at Siam
Royal my girlfriend and I were puz
zled when the owners hovered over
us as we tried the first appetizer,
maeng kom. The reason became
clear when we tried the dish — wave
after wave of flavor washed over our
mouths and they watched us squirm
in joy. The owners, Chutima and Zen
Vasa, grinned — two more converts.
The second time we came in, my
girlfriend and I hovered over six of
our friends as they had their first
taste of maeng kom. We grinned —
another six converts.
On my third visit I just grinned.
Those of us that used to truck to
Cha'am in Berkeley for great Thai
food can now save the gas and toll
money. Established in August 1993,
Siam Royal is right on par in service,
presentation, and quality. It is locat

cd right in the middle of the main
University strip and within quick
walking distance of the Varsity the
ater. It's the perfect stop for a great
meal before enjoying a movie.
Adorned with simple decora
tions the establishment belies the
culinary adventure to conie. It
should — the prices are excellent,
the service is quick and friendly and
the food is ambrosia to the unen
lightened tongue.
The maeng kom appetizer is
worth the trip alone. Consisting of
little leaf boats filled with fried co
conut, ginger, lime and peanuts, this
dish also has a whole bevy of secret
ingredients which you then top with
secret sauce. If you can fit one into
your mouth, you'll taste at least 15
different flavors in the time it takes
you to swallow it! Wash it down

with a sip of Thai beer and you'll
walk out grinning, too. The Science
Bug may want to try this one.
However, the true tests for any
Thai restaurant are the authenticity
of the soups and curries. Well, at
Siam Royal the subtleties that curry
spices can convey have been mas
tered by Zen, the chef. The chicken
coconut-galanga soup is perfect and
spiced to taste.
Once your table has stopped
fighting over the last complemen
tary shrimp chip, you'll have to
make a choice of appetizer and en
tree. Of course, for those who don't
want to experience a dish limi Hen
drix would have sung about (and
Jerry dreams about), the spring rolls
are a tasty treat.
A soup is recommended for
those with a hearty appetite, but

save some room for
the main course. Nat
urally, chicken or pork
satay is available for
those who can't get
enough peanut sauce
into their lives.
For the main
course, I've sampled
various curry varia
tions. The latest I tried
was pataya which was
prawns, scallops, and
pineapple served in a

cored pineapple half with spicy red
curry and vegetables. Don't worry
about burning yourself on Thai
chilies, either: they'll ask you what
spice levels you enjoy and give good
recommendations.
Finally, you may want to end
with Thai iced tea, coffee or coconut

the trek!

ice cream. Each is as likely to inspire
delight as the other, its simply a
matter of taste. Taste is what Siam
Royal is all about. Don't be sur
prised if they ask you for sugges
tions. They care about the cus
tomers and it translates into a great
dining experience. ■
