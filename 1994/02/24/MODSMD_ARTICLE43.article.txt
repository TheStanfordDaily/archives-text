### 
Ace Ventura, Pel Detective
As the star of a movie featuring a
predictable plot and bad acting,
comic Jim Carrey carries the bur
den of turning "Ace Ventura"
from another piece of trash into
something worth the price of a
matinee ticket. Although his
wacky pet detective character
wears thin at points, Carrey suc
ceeds in achieving very modest
goals. PG-13
The Accompanist
As the latest French film about
beautiful, tormented people in the
world of classical music, "The Ac
companist" proves to be an en
grossing stroll through that never
never land. Still, any story set in
Nazi-occupied Paris should have
some historical focus. Unfortunate
ly, that reality is marginalized in this
bittersweet love story. PG
The Cement Garden
Surely, a movie about sibling sexu
al relations raises many an eye
brow. Yet "The Cement Garden"
tells a far from trite and sensational
ists story; fine acting, appropriate
settings and a perfect score make
for a beautiful and haunting work of
art. UNRATED

In the Name of the Father
Despite appearances by Academy
Award-winning actors Daniel Day-
Lewis and Emma Thompson, "In the
Name of the Father" rarely rises
above melodrama. Instead of focus
ing on how violence can destroy the
life of an everyman, director Jim
Sheridan takes on a well-worn per
spective, opting for courtroom
drama straight out of "L.A. Law" and
"Perry Mason." R
I'll Do Anything
The latest in a line of Hollywood self
satires. "I'll Do Anything" offers
nothing new or particularly interest
ing. This movie about movie musi
cals stays flimsy throughout, show
casing over-acted parts and a weak
plot. If you want to see a good movie
in this vein, stay home and rent "The
Player" or "Sunset Boulevard." PG
-13
My Father the Hero
Who wants to see 10 minutes of
Gerard Depardieu waterskiing? Per
haps the better question is who re
ally wants to see an hour and a half
of a silly "Three's Company"-esque
romantic comedy? Even a cameo
by Emma Thompson and Depar
dieu's trademark "French-dude
without-a-clue" expressions do little

to help this dog of a movie. PG
Naked
An experience that could, at best, be
called painful, Mike Leigh's latest
takes the worst view of male-female
relations and pushes it to an ex
treme. With the story of an intellectu
al drifter who sexually and emotion
ally abuses women, Leigh suggests
that all women are masochists in
this overtly misogynistic film. UN
RATED
Reality Bites
So what if "Reality Bites" is another
movie about twenty-somethings
struggling in the post-college
world? Although no shining rays of
wisdom are revealed in the movie,
"Reality Bites" is a fun movie with a
refreshing sense of humor. It's im
mediate enough for us college stu
dents to forgive its minor flaws. PG
-13
Romeo Is Bleeding
When director Peter Medak decided
to direct "Romeo Is Bleeding," he lis
tened to the wrong voice in his head.
Good casting can't save this black
comedy which really misses. Ridicu
lous violence and silly sex scenes
prevent the movie from going any-

where. About the only thing going for
"Romeo" is actor Gary Oldman's
flawless New York accent. R
Schindler's List
The dark, haunting images of
Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's
List" overcome the film's characters,
leaving moments more important
than people. The story of German
entrepreneur Oskar Schindler and
the more than 1,100 Jews he saves
leads to an examination of the many
faces of evil in the Nazi regime. With
indelible pictures of death and
degradation burned in black-and
white film, "Schindler's List" cap
tures the truth of the more than six
million murders carried out just a
half century ago. R
What's Eating Gilbert Grape?
"Gilbert Grape" isn't just another
trite, "coming-of-age" flick. It's a
fresh portrayal of how reclusive
Gilbert (Johnny Depp) emerges
from the burdens of family life to find
love. The performances are excel
lent: Leonard DiCapricio, who plays
Gilbert's mentally retarded brother,
may receive an Oscar nomination
for his riveting work. Above all that,
there's a bunch of neat symbols and
metaphors! PG-13
