# Donors can target specific minorities
## 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
Stanford has offered minority
scholarships for decades, but a re
cent policy statement by the Depart
ment of Education may allow
donors to insist that their money go
to a certain ethnic group.
The department announced last
week that colleges may legally offer
minority scholarships in order to
promote diversity on their campus
es or make up for past discrimina
tion.
Financial Aids Office Asst. Direc
tor Mary Morrison said current
donors who give funds can specify
which groups they "prefer" the
money to go to.
"The Office of Development only
accepts scholarships that say they
'prefer' that the money goes to a mi

nority," Morrison said, adding that
under the new policy donors may be
able to "insist that [scholarships]
are for a minority," instead of just
"preferring that they're for a minor
ity."
Out of the approximately 600
permanent scholarships that the
University offers, Morrison said
only about 5 pi 1 rcent have anything
to do with ethnicity.
Cynthia Rife, another Financial
Aids assistant director, said the new
policy may make "a difference in our
encouraging new scholarships .. .
because the Office uf Development
might be able to offer a donor more
flexibility."
When accepting scholarships,
Morrison said, the Office of Devel
opment makes sure "not to discrim
inate against any class of peo
ple."
"All students with the same
need get the same amount of
money," she said, adding that
minority students still must
demonstrate financial need.
The controversy over minori
ty scholarships arose about two
years ago when the Department
of Education under former
President George Bush said
such scholarships were illegal.
The department later
"backed off on this stance," Rife
said. "It was really unclear." No
Stanford practices were
changed at the time of the
department's original state
ment.
Of the current policy state
ment, Rife said, "It's not so
much that it's a new policy, but
what was going on before was
unclear. ... It clarifies things."
However, last week's policy
statement may not settle the
issue because some conserva
tive legal groups are threaten
ing to sue colleges that offer
minority scholarships.
