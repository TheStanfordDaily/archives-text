Hoping to better internal communi
cation between Hoover Institution's fel
lows, Dr. Gerald A. Dorfman has as
sumed a newly-created associate direc
tor for research position.
Dorfman, a senior fellow and curator
of the Paul and Jean Hanna Collection
on Education, said that because fellows
at Hoover are "free to do their own re
search as they define it," they often re
search the same area without even real
izing it.
He said he intends to "facilitate com
munication between fellows about their
work and improve the ability to tell the
rest of the world about what we're
doing."
Dorfman will work with Hoover Di

rector John Raisian and Asst. Director
Noel Kolak. "Jerry brings to this assign
ment a thorough knowledge of the
Hoover Institution, the respect of his
colleagues and an outstanding scholarly
record," Raisian said.
Kolak said she will be "working with
various committees related to the
strategic direction of Hoover's research
position."
She looks forward to working more
closely with Dorfman. "He's got a good
sense of priorities and wonderful inter
personal skills with fellows, donors and
staff members," she said, stressing that
Dorfman "has really strong natural
leadership abilities and is very helpful in
moving a group with divergent views to
ward consensus."
