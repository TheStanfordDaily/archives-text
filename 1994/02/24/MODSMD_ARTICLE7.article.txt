They performed form! sterilizat ions on
hundreds of thousands of their own com
patriots. They systematically murdered
men, women and children. And they be
lieved it was all justified.
Beginning with Adolf Hitler's rise to
power in 1933, and through the second
world war, thousands of physicians and sci

entists in Nazi Germany performed deadly
medical experiments on both German citi
zens and Jewish concentration-camp vic
tims in the name of racial purification.
Now, a class titled "Ethical Values in
Health Care in 1994: Lessons from the
Nazi Period" examines these physicians
and scientists' medical practices in a his
torical context, and applies these lessons to
the social, economic and political chal

lenges facing health care providers in the
United States today.
The class is sponsored by the Medical
School, but is open to undergraduates as
well. Guest lecturers Michael Franzblau, a
clinical professor of dermatology at Uni
versity of California, San Francisco, and
Michael Thaler, UCSF professor of pedi
atrics, teach the class along with Dr.
Thomas Raffin, the Medical Center's chief
of the Division of Pulmonary and Critical
Care Medicine.
The course investigates members of the
Nazi party who performed the ethnic
cleansing in Hitler's German state, Raffin
explained. "The goal of this course is to
identify the role that physicians and scien
tists played in developing the theories of
racial hygiene which were common and im
portant in Germany," he said.
According to Raffin, the first half of the
class outlines the facts surrounding physi
cians and scientists' experiments and med
icalized killing of German citizens and
Jews in Hitler's concentration camps.
"The second half of the course uses this
knowledge and the insight that the class
has gained ... to examine a number of key
ethical issues that exist now in America,"
he said.
Raffin said Germany's racial hygiene
program involved ridding the country of
any individuals deemed inferior in order to
advance a pure form of the Nordic race.
Along with Jews during World War 11,
these individuals included German citizens
who were mentally ill, homosexuals, com
munists, gypsies and conscientious objec
tors.
Starting in the late 19305, German
physicians and scientists performed med
icalized killing of 350,000 children and
adults. According to Franzblau, their
methods of murder included freezing peo
ple to death, exposing them to high alti
tudes without oxygen, injecting them with
