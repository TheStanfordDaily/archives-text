They performed form! sterilizat ions on
hundreds of thousands of their own com
patriots. They systematically murdered
men, women and children. And they be
lieved it was all justified.
Beginning with Adolf Hitler's rise to
power in 1933, and through the second
world war, thousands of physicians and sci

entists in Nazi Germany performed deadly
medical experiments on both German citi
zens and Jewish concentration-camp vic
tims in the name of racial purification.
Now, a class titled "Ethical Values in
Health Care in 1994: Lessons from the
Nazi Period" examines these physicians
and scientists' medical practices in a his
torical context, and applies these lessons to
the social, economic and political chal

lenges facing health care providers in the
United States today.
The class is sponsored by the Medical
School, but is open to undergraduates as
well. Guest lecturers Michael Franzblau, a
clinical professor of dermatology at Uni
versity of California, San Francisco, and
Michael Thaler, UCSF professor of pedi
atrics, teach the class along with Dr.
Thomas Raffin, the Medical Center's chief
of the Division of Pulmonary and Critical
Care Medicine.
The course investigates members of the
Nazi party who performed the ethnic
cleansing in Hitler's German state, Raffin
explained. "The goal of this course is to
identify the role that physicians and scien
tists played in developing the theories of
racial hygiene which were common and im
portant in Germany," he said.
According to Raffin, the first half of the
class outlines the facts surrounding physi
cians and scientists' experiments and med
icalized killing of German citizens and
Jews in Hitler's concentration camps.
"The second half of the course uses this
knowledge and the insight that the class
has gained ... to examine a number of key
ethical issues that exist now in America,"
he said.
Raffin said Germany's racial hygiene
program involved ridding the country of
any individuals deemed inferior in order to
advance a pure form of the Nordic race.
Along with Jews during World War 11,
these individuals included German citizens
who were mentally ill, homosexuals, com
munists, gypsies and conscientious objec
tors.
Starting in the late 19305, German
physicians and scientists performed med
icalized killing of 350,000 children and
adults. According to Franzblau, their
methods of murder included freezing peo
ple to death, exposing them to high alti
tudes without oxygen, injecting them with

deadly germs like typhus, and
gassing them to death.
One reason Nazi doctors per
formed such acts was the redis
covery of Gregor Mendel's
genetics work, Raffin said. "The
second element was the close
attention and impact of social
Darwinism and the survival of
the fittest," he said.
Thaler said German doctors
and scientist fused Darwinian
ideas about natural selection
and about survival of the fittest
into a question of social sur
vival. "In other words," he said,
they practiced medicine with
"the concept that societies rise
and fall on a similar competitive
basis as species do."
Third-year medical student
Greg Ruhnke, who is taking the
class, was outraged at German
physicians and scientists' prac
tices. "Physicians' use of genet
ic engineering and experimenta
tion to create a new direction
for their society is scandalous

when one considers the fact that
our perception of a physician's
role is that of an advocate for
humanitarian values," he said.
Raffin said that examples of
the ethical challenges that face
health care providers in the
United States include the "great
importance of informed consent
in medical investigation." With
holding and withdrawing life
support in the question of
euthanasia, the rationing of
health care, and new genetics,
or physicians' ability to alter
the gene pool, are other ethical
concepts the class outlines as a
part of today's medical profes
sion, Raffin said.
Thaler explained that the
ethical issues facing health care
providers today are similar to
the questions German physi
cians and scientists had to deal
with.
"We're undergoing pres
sures, changes, and political and
economic contingencies that are
very analogous to those which
basically drove German
medicine in the direction of
Nazi medicine," he said.
According to Thaler, Nazi

medicine was an aberration of
Western medicine. "What we
have here is a medicine very
similar to ours, and in fact the
progenitor of ours, moving into
a way of dealing with patients
that we now characterize as
criminal medicine," he said.
Thaler said that Nazi
medicine treated the whole of
German society as a patient,
rather than individuals in that
society, and physicians used
medical science to treat all of its
illnesses. "That is precisely
what we're doing today," he
said.
Citing the AIDS dilemma as
an example, Thaler said that
society insists AIDS is a medical
crisis and holds doctors respon
sible for taking care of the prob
lem.
However, according to
Thaler, AIDS is more than a
medical question; it is a social
and cultural problem that
requires changes in society's
behavior. "But at the moment
society has no answers in the
other areas, and tiierefore it has
medicalized this social prob
lem," he said.

have here is a medicine very
similar to ours, and in fact the
progenitor of ours, moving into
a way of dealing with patients
that we now characterize as
criminal medicine," he said.
Thaler said that Nazi
medicine treated the whole of
German society as a patient,
rather than individuals in that
society, and physicians used
medical science to treat all of its
illnesses. "That is precisely
what we're doing today," he
said.
Citing the AIDS dilemma as
an example, Thaler said that
society insists AIDS is a medical
crisis and holds doctors respon
sible for taking care of the prob
lem.
However, according to
Thaler, AIDS is more than a
medical question; it is a social
and cultural problem that
requires changes in society's
behavior. "But at the moment
society has no answers in the
other areas, and tiierefore it has
medicalized this social prob
lem," he said.
They performed form! sterilizat ions on
hundreds of thousands of their own com
patriots. They systematically murdered
men, women and children. And they be
lieved it was all justified.
Beginning with Adolf Hitler's rise to
power in 1933, and through the second
world war, thousands of physicians and sci

entists in Nazi Germany performed deadly
medical experiments on both German citi
zens and Jewish concentration-camp vic
tims in the name of racial purification.
Now, a class titled "Ethical Values in
Health Care in 1994: Lessons from the
Nazi Period" examines these physicians
and scientists' medical practices in a his
torical context, and applies these lessons to
the social, economic and political chal

lenges facing health care providers in the
United States today.
The class is sponsored by the Medical
School, but is open to undergraduates as
well. Guest lecturers Michael Franzblau, a
clinical professor of dermatology at Uni
versity of California, San Francisco, and
Michael Thaler, UCSF professor of pedi
atrics, teach the class along with Dr.
Thomas Raffin, the Medical Center's chief
of the Division of Pulmonary and Critical
Care Medicine.
The course investigates members of the
Nazi party who performed the ethnic
cleansing in Hitler's German state, Raffin
explained. "The goal of this course is to
identify the role that physicians and scien
tists played in developing the theories of
racial hygiene which were common and im
portant in Germany," he said.
According to Raffin, the first half of the
class outlines the facts surrounding physi
cians and scientists' experiments and med
icalized killing of German citizens and
Jews in Hitler's concentration camps.
"The second half of the course uses this
knowledge and the insight that the class
has gained ... to examine a number of key
ethical issues that exist now in America,"
he said.
Raffin said Germany's racial hygiene
program involved ridding the country of
any individuals deemed inferior in order to
advance a pure form of the Nordic race.
Along with Jews during World War 11,
these individuals included German citizens
who were mentally ill, homosexuals, com
munists, gypsies and conscientious objec
tors.
Starting in the late 19305, German
physicians and scientists performed med
icalized killing of 350,000 children and
adults. According to Franzblau, their
methods of murder included freezing peo
ple to death, exposing them to high alti
tudes without oxygen, injecting them with

deadly germs like typhus, and
gassing them to death.
One reason Nazi doctors per
formed such acts was the redis
covery of Gregor Mendel's
genetics work, Raffin said. "The
second element was the close
attention and impact of social
Darwinism and the survival of
the fittest," he said.
Thaler said German doctors
and scientist fused Darwinian
ideas about natural selection
and about survival of the fittest
into a question of social sur
vival. "In other words," he said,
they practiced medicine with
"the concept that societies rise
and fall on a similar competitive
basis as species do."
Third-year medical student
Greg Ruhnke, who is taking the
class, was outraged at German
physicians and scientists' prac
tices. "Physicians' use of genet
ic engineering and experimenta
tion to create a new direction
for their society is scandalous

when one considers the fact that
our perception of a physician's
role is that of an advocate for
humanitarian values," he said.
Raffin said that examples of
the ethical challenges that face
health care providers in the
United States include the "great
importance of informed consent
in medical investigation." With
holding and withdrawing life
support in the question of
euthanasia, the rationing of
health care, and new genetics,
or physicians' ability to alter
the gene pool, are other ethical
concepts the class outlines as a
part of today's medical profes
sion, Raffin said.
Thaler explained that the
ethical issues facing health care
providers today are similar to
the questions German physi
cians and scientists had to deal
with.
"We're undergoing pres
sures, changes, and political and
economic contingencies that are
very analogous to those which
basically drove German
medicine in the direction of
Nazi medicine," he said.
According to Thaler, Nazi

medicine was an aberration of
Western medicine. "What we
have here is a medicine very
similar to ours, and in fact the
progenitor of ours, moving into
a way of dealing with patients
that we now characterize as
criminal medicine," he said.
