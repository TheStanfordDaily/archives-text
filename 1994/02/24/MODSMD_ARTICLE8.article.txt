## Profs agree on need for free market incentives 
### Nicolas Kuritzky Staff writer 
Hilled as a debate over the need for
free market environmentalist!, the
Stanford Federalist Society instead fea
tured yesterday two economics profes
sors who were in "99.5 percent" agree
ment over the merits of the market in
solving environmental problems.
Terry Anderson of the Political
Economy Research Center and Eco
nomics Prof. Roger Noll emphasized the
need "to get the law out of the way" and
find financial incentives for solving en
vironmental problems.
"Without wealth, people simply
don't care about the environment. We

need to get incentives right in order to
turn wildlife from a liability into an
asset," said Anderson, who was fea
tured as a guest lecturer.
"The environment is a luxury good
and comes when people get money,"
said Anderson, who underlined the inef
fectiveness of environmental policy in
most of the world.
In America, Anderson cautioned,
"we are subsidizing the destruction of
the environment" with programs that
provide incentives for farmers and tim
ber companies to excessively deplete re
sources.
Anderson praised the success of
Hank Fischer, a Montana envi
ronmentalist, who offered ranch
ers reimbursements and mone
tary incentives to let wolves stay
on their property. "He turned a
liability into an asset," said
Anderson.
Noting the lessons learned

from this example, Anderson,
criticized laws which prevent
environmental groups from bid
ding for timber and water rights
on federal lands. "The law stands
in the way," he said, backing his
claim by relating the case of an
environmentalist group that is
legally blocked from paying
farmers to save water for trout
and salmon.
One solution proposed by
Anderson to many of the envi

ronmental problems on public
lands detailed a $5 annual per
mit for hikers. Such a program
could create $400 million in rev
enue, Anderson claimed. More
over, he said, it would make tim
ber companies think twice about
cutting down the trees on their
lands.
In general, both Anderson and
Noll professed a need to make
forests and parks more lucrative
for tourism than for timber.

Such incentives could include
raising park entrance fees.
Noll finished the talk by
emphasizing the need for com
promise between environmental
ists, politicians and special inter
est groups. He criticized environ
mentalists with "absolutist" val
ues, claiming that environmental
gains can only occur when every
one, including bureaucrats, are
part of the policy making pro
cess.
