# Out of the loop, students fear 'conservative agenda'
## Ethnic center budget cuts, other 'clues' feed student nervousness 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
Condoleezza Rice swept into the
forum more than an hour after it began
and already on the defensive. Stanford's
provost appeared impatient, even testy,
as she confronted student concerns over
threatened budget cuts to campus ethnic
centers.
"You don't have the standing to ques
tion my commitment to minorities and
minority issues," Rice lectured an audi

ence member at one point, during the
Jan. 12 event. "I've been black all my
life."
The tone of the forum — convened by
the Students of Color Coalition to stave
off possible funding cutbacks due to the
University's $18 million to $20 million
budget-cutting effort — reflected a grow
ing feeling of paranoia among students
who believe their voices no longer have a
place in the University decision-making
process.
Some of the students, many who are

involved with ethnic centers or liberal
student organizations, also suspect that
the relatively new administration har
bors hopes of cutting back Stanford's em
phasis on multiculturalism and diversi
ty.
"There was a time in the forum when
Condi said 'You have to trust me' and the
audience just snickered," remembers
Black Student Union Chair Anietie
Ekanem. "You have to treat students
with a certain amount of respect, and
that's been lacking."

But University President Gerhard
Caspe»; says such feelings are not justi
fied. "Look, I'm doing as much as I possi
bly can. I'm out there in dorms, I have
students to the house, I talk to the ASSU,
I hold fora on curricular issues," he says.
"What else can I do? I also have to run
Stanford."
With a University president who
rarely voices strong opinions, Ekanem
and others pick up on small things: the
choice of a conservative scholar
as graduation speaker, the brevi
ty of Casper's visits to ethnic
centers last year, his hands-off
approach to labor problems at
Webb Ranch.
"That small group of people
can decide which way this insti
tution is going to go," Ekanem
says. "When you have a conser
vative president from the Uni
versity of Chicago and a conser
vative provost from the Bush
administration, which way do
you think it is going to go?"
But not every student shares
that sentiment. Casper and Rice
are merely willing to challenge
the status quo, according to COP
member Jason Snyder. "The sta
tus quo is neither liberal nor con
servative."
As for Rice, Snyder says, "she
listens to rational arguments and
solid policy options. What she
won't listen to is knee-jerk reac
tions, and she won't listen to
simply emotional arguments."
Rice herself also dismisses
concerns. "I'm a little surprised
that people would assume that I
have or Gerhard has an agenda
for a political direction for the
University," she says.
On the night of the forum,
Rice had a previously scheduled
faculty dinner.
She smiles at the suggestion
that the event was uncomfort
able: "I didn't particularly think
of it as tense. I like and don't
mind even rather sharp
exchanges sometimes."
Still, the anger is there. Rice
was "unprofessional, personally
insulting and obnoxious" at the
forum, says senior Rachel Mad
dow. But the concern goes far
beyond the perceived attitude of
a specific administrator on one
night.
"I think the administration is
responding to what they perceive
the alumni want," says Saman
tha Halem, president of the

Stanford Democrats. "It seems
to me that the stances they are
taking is to show a more friendly
University to conservative alum
ni" that looks "less like a 'PC
haven' " to wealthy, conservative
donors.
'Nothing very overt'
Questioned on what specifical
ly leads them to think Casper
and Rice have a conservative
agenda, worried students and
staff list — in fche words of junior
Emily Haines — "little, slight,
underhand things."
"I don't think it's anything
very overt," Halem says.
While former University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy was quick
to air his liberal views, some
times to the dismay of trustees
and alumni, Casper tends to float
trial balloons. Last year he threw
out the idea of a three-year
undergraduate education, for
instance, without actively push
ing for it.
"What has he spoken out on?"
COP member Ron Brown asks.
"Just improving the quality of
academics. The absence of the
strong voice you heard before is
in sharp contrast to Kennedy."

So students, faculty and staff
are left to decipher clues in the
hopes of grasping the president's
agenda. Those clues include,
they say, the appointment of two
trustees with conservative views
and Casper's suggestion last year
that faculty members should not
take political stands.
Some of the cited incidents
seem to have little to do with the
president and provost. Students
see a rightward trend in a
remark made by Political Science
Prof. Stephen Krasner at a Jan
uary Faculty Senate meeting
questioning admissions policies.
The birth of Winds of Free
dom — a group of conservative
students and alumni conducting
its own review of undergraduate
education — is also a warning
sign for some.
The liberal group formed in
reaction, Stanford Students for
an Informed Community, splin
tered a few weeks after its forma
tion over an internal disagree
ment.
Even for those who piece
together a conservative trend,
there are also plenty of opposite
indications: Casper supports
Stanford's speech code, for
example. He placed the ethnic
centers on his fund-raising prior
ity list, and seems genuinely puz
zled by charges that he does not
support them.
"I met with the representa
tives in December," he says."I
made it very clear that I thought
of the ethnic centers as not just
part of student activities but
indeed as part of the academic
side of the University, and I said
that therefore I considered it
very unlikely that they would
have to suffer the same intensity
of cuts we are making in other
administrative areas."
Conspiracy theories
When he writes that students
have to be prepared to "shovel
the cow dung that Rice and com
pany have prepared for our con-

sumption," Daily columnist
N'Gai Croal is voicing some of
the concerns of students like
Ekanem and Maddow.
Croal and others believe the
uproar over the ethnic center
budget cuts is only one piece of a
larger puzzle. And the emerging
picture isn't one they welcome.
While Casper said in an inter
view this week that he isn't both
ered by the criticism, he did call
Croal's assertion that the presi
dent wants to depoliticize the
University "shit" during a dorm
visit late last month.
Rice also says she doesn't take
the criticism personally. But
both respond with outrage to the
idea that Casper has somehow
manipulated the situation so
that ethnic center leaders are
primarily dealing with three
black administrators — Rice,
Vice Provost and Dean for Stu
dent Affairs Mary Edmonds, and
Dean of Students Michael Jack
son.
It's a pattern Ekanem sees in
Casper's conspicuous absence in
the budget debate. "If it wasn't
planned, it's a darned good way
of going about business," he
says.

Students ought to ask Casper,
"Where are you during all of
this? Why is it that only three
administrators have been
addressing us?" Ekanem contin
ues. "He's been saying 'You have
to go to these three people.' But
those aren't the only ones mak
ing the decisions."
Even Snyder, who is quick to
defend the administration, per
ceives that strategy. "Casper has
had a very low profile this year.
The provost has been very high
profile," he says.
The provost has traditionally
handled the details of budget cut
ting, Rice says. "We spend a lot of
time together talking about the
budget, and [Casper] meets with

the budget group. We most cer
tainly will make decisions togeth
er."
Casper first points out that
Kennedy appointed both
Edmonds and Jackson. On the
idea that he might somehow be
assigning the three administra
tors to deal with ethnic center
cuts because of their race, he
says,"I find that just incredibly
patronizing."
"I must confess I find the
notion that — I have in the past
and I continue to break glass ceil
ings — when that happens, for
that to be turned around as an
argument against me I find just
incredibly offensive," Casper
adds.
Rice too dismisses the idea
with a hint of anger. "I think it's
pathetic. I think it means that
for all our talk about multicul
turalism and diversity we
haven't come very far," she says.
"And I guess on that one I ques
tion the motive and ask anybody
who thinks that to look very hard
at their own racial attitudes."
But certainly one result of
Rice taking a leading role in the
budget show — and Casper's dis
appearing act — is a tendency for
some to perceive the provost as
the ultimate villain.
"I think it's very easy to get
angry at Condoleezza Rice and
focus on her, but it's her and
President Casper," notes ASSU
Senator Vanessa Alvarado, who
is also a leader in Stanford's Chi
cano/Latino community.
'So little to begin with'
January's rally and forum was
the most public manifestation of

concern over
budget cuts to
the four ethnic
centers, but the
fears leading to
that outburst of
concern had been
building for
much longer.
As part of the
University's

effort to slice its operating bud
get, the Dean of Students Office
will be cutting back 15 percent to
20 percent. The centers fall
under the Dean of Students, but
it is still unclear how much
money the centers themselves
will lose.
At last week's town meeting,
Jackson tried to soothe fears by
declaring that the centers will
largely be spared. "Let the head
line read that the centers are not

going to be emasculated," he
said.
But with funding already cut
to the bone, Native American
community leader Myra Parker
says heads of the centers are
more worried about the future
than the immediate cuts. "The
point was that there was so little
to begin with, not that we were
going to be consolidated or wiped
out," she says.
Rumors floating around had
the centers being consolidated or
moved to the second floor of Old
Union, says Ekanem. "It's amaz
ing how rumors can suddenly
become fact," he adds.
But Casper asserts that the
centers were never in serious

danger, though he told students
"we could not exempt them"
from the re-examination of all
University areas.
For COP member Ying-Ying
Goh, that is not a disturbing
idea. "Students can't say
[Casperl is not doing a good job
just because he hasn't ruled cer
tain areas off limits for budget
cuts. That's a very limited view."
"The notion that they would
suffer a 30 percent budget cut
was never on the agenda,"
Casper adds. "I went out of my
way to say to the students that I
thought the programmatic side
of ethnic centers was terribly
important and that I would try to
help them, that I would go out
and try to raise funds."
Why, then, would they feel so
threatened? As the president
explains it, students may be
using the activism "as a strategy
to put even more pressure" on
the administration to avoid cuts
by "taking a more strident posi
tion than was justified by the
positions I have taken."
Brown, however, believes the
rally and forum were at least
somewhat productive. "It's hard
to imagine that the protest didn't
open administrators' eyes on
some level," he says."The situa
tion became hostile at some point
in the protest movement. That's
unfortunate."
At the forum, Rice talked of
"endowing" the centers. Since
then, she has spoken of endow
ing specific programs within the
centers rather than their operat
ing budgets. To some, that
sounds like a betrayal.
"The endowment issue was a
carrot put out there to appease
us," Ekanem says.
El Centro Chicano director
Frances Morales also expresses
disappointment over what she
perceives as Rice's switch. "It's
not what she said publicly, but at
least the centers will be given
some priority in development in
the University," she says.
But Rice contends that the
endowment issue was a misun
derstanding. "People give money
when they know exactly how it's
going to be spent," she said. "You
can't endow people's operating
budgets. It's just not in the fund
raising cards. If I could endow
Stanford's operating budget, I
would do it for Stanford."
An individual program or fel
lowship or a lecture series might
be endowed, she adds. "When we
talked about endowment for the
centers, that is what we were

always talking about. If there
was any sloppiness in the lan
guage, maybe it was just the spo
ken word."
Ethnic centers aside, many
students express concern that
the current budget process is far
less inclusive than in the past.
"The administration made a
conscious decision that not very
much student input would be
needed," says ASSU Senator
Mork Murdock, who chairs an
ASSU committee that advises
Student Affairs. After the heavi
ly consultative process during
the last round of cuts, he adds,
there has been a "big swing in
the other direction."
But administrators argue that
the drawn-out undertaking two
years ago is not the way to solve
new funding shortfalls. "You just
can't mobilize a whole communi
ty every year to do this," Rice
says."It is a more streamlined
process."
A shift to the right?
In Monday's Stanford Review,
the lead editorial attempts to
debunk "The Myth of a 'Right
Thinking' Stanford." Winds of
Freedom, the choice of Steven
Carter as graduation speaker
and other clues "are all used by
the Left side of campus as evi
dence of a rightward drift of
Stanford," The Review asserts.
"This whole mentality, however,
is nonsense."
But to senior Carl Hampton, a
member of the Stanford
Democrats who was briefly
involved in Students for an
Informed Community, the Uni
versity is indeed drifting. "I
think Casper's goal is to get
money from alumni," he says,
and older alumni tend to dis
agree with policies like the
replacement of Western Culture
with Cultures, Ideas and Values.
Alumni donations are low
because of the misperception
that Stanford is a wealthy insti
tution, Casper argues, while
admitting that "there are a lot of
single-issue people out there who
punish us for this, that or some
thing else, who hold the institu
tion hostage because they do not
agree with a particular policy."

If Casper appears conserva
tive, it may only be in compari
son to the last administration.
But Kennedy says fears of a pres
idential agenda is nothing new.
"During my presidency people
would always say I was trying to
move the University one way or
another. It wasn't true for me
and I suspect it isn't true for
President Casper," he says.
For those who do not see a
larger trend, the fears are merely
the natural result of changing
times.
"Whenever people start ques
tioning the status quo or the way
things are moving, people get
scared," Goh says. "You can't
make any judgments yet."
Casper contends that he has
made his views clear. "I have
bent over backwards to articu
late on major issues where I
stand, what my concerns are,
what my worries are," he says.
"Do I know answers? No, I'm not
smart enough."

But Brown argues that the
president's priorities will not be
found in scrutiny of his public
statements. "Where we'll be able

to judge whether
Casper is work
ing against some
student interests
to appease con
servative alumni
is when the bud
get allocations
are made," he
says.
If the ethnic

centers, theme houses, multicul
tural curriculum continue to
grow, Brown says, "that's what
counts. I think for Casper, it's all
dollars."
Last year, he adds, some were
angered when Casper made hur
ried 10-minute visits to each of
the ethnic centers. "It's some
thing that students can perceive
as an insult," Brown said, "but
those 10-minute visits were fol
lowed by a placement of the cen
ters on a development priority
list."
For those who perceive right
ward trends, the prospect of
changes in the curriculum is also
a frightening one as they wonder
what will the Commission on
Undergraduate Education come
up with.
"What I'm worried about is
this may be a move to totally
eliminate distribution require
ments," says Asian-American
Activities Center director Rick
Yuen, who is concerned about
the relatively recent gender and
world cultures requirements.
"The new DRs are the ones in the
greatest jeopardy."
But History Prof. James Shee
han, who chairs the commission,
refutes any ideas that the com
mission was appointed as part of
a Casper agenda. "Would I really
devote so much time to do some
one else's work for them?" he
asks. "I feel no outside pressure
at all to do any particular thing."
And Goh stresses the impor
tance of questioning the status
quo. "I think it is a good thing
that we are being forced to re
evaluate multiculturalism," she
says. "There are gripes that you
hear on campus like 'Multicul-

turalism is being shoved down
our throat.' It wasn't just a small
minority of students. It was
almost becoming an 'in' thing to
say."
While most students believe a
little questioning is positive, they
do not want to be left out of that
process. Murdock holds out hope
that both Rice and Casper will
eventually bring students into
the decision-making process.
"Because they are relatively
new here, I think there is room
to establish a new system with
them for student input," he says.
"There would rightly be a prob
lem if we assert a different pro
cess and are entirely denied."
Until then, however, some
students will remain hostile.
"Talk to any graduating senior.
They're just fed up," Ekanem
says."It doesn't matter what
ethnicity, where you live. . . .
People don't trust the adminis
tration. They don't like what it is
doing."
