# Hong Kong fights for democracy despite warnings

### 
HONG KONG (AP) - Gov. Chris
Patten announced yesterday that he
was pushing ahead with democracy for
Hong Kong in defiance of China's warn
ing that it will sack all elected bodies
when the territory reverts to Chinese
rule in 1997.
China has warned repeatedly that
Britain would slam the door shut on
further negotiations for the smooth
transfer of Hong Kong if Patten did not
scrap his political reforms.
"The door to negotiations has now
been closed by the British side," Chi
nese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen
Guofang said yesterday.

Patten's action signaled the most
serious crisis between Britain and
China over Hong Kong since the nerve
racking negotiations of 1982 that led to
the agreement on the colony's transfer
back to Chinese sovereignty.
In December, Chinese Foreign Minis
ter Qian Qichen renewed previous
vague Chinese threats to retake Hong
Kong before 1997 if it believes the
colony was in a state of chaos.
But a defiant Patten told lawmakers
that he would submit on March 9 the
remainder of the reform package that
put Britain and China on a collision
course when the governor first unveiled

it in 1992.
Patten congratulated the Legislative
Council for passing the first part of the
reforms in a vote early yesterday.
In a swift reaction, China said all
local councils and the legislature "will
definitely be terminated" when Hong
Kong reverts to Chinese rule on July 1,
1997.
China fears the reforms will under
mine its future rule of the prosperous
colony and spur demands for change.
Most of Hong Kong's six million peo
ple feared that any dispute with China
would bring economic chaos to this
thriving financial center.
