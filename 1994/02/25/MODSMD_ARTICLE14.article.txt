## Accused spy may not be guilty CIA worker Ames passed polygraph tests twice 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Accused CIA turncoat Aldrich H.
Ames passed agency polygraph
tests twice during the time he is
suspected of working for Moscow,
and the Senate Intelligence Com
mittee plans to review the agency's
internal security procedures, offi
cials said yesterday.
Meantime, the CIA suspects
that secrets allegedly sold by the
former counterintelligence officer
led to the deaths of at least 10
Soviets working for U.S. intelli
gence, according to one official
familiar with CIA and FBI briefin
gs to the House and Senate intelli
gence committees about the case.
In an effort to detect traitors,
the CIA tries to administer poly
graph tests every five years to its
employees, but there have been
backlogs.
Ames, alleged to have worked
for the Soviets and then the Rus
sians from 1985 until his arrest
Monday, was tested on schedule
without his spying being discov
ered, according to a government
official, who, like the others,
declined to be identified by name.
Those tests occurred in 1986 and
1991, according to another offi
cial.
"Doesn't the machine work? Or

is it that easy to beat?" asked a
congressional official who had
been advised of Ames' passing the
tests. "That's one area the Senate
Intelligence Committee will be
looking at."
One of the government officials
said successful polygraphing
depends on the questions.
"They ask you if you are a spy.
It's about that blunt," said the
congressional official.
This official said the committee
also has questions about CIA and
FBI cooperation on the case. CIA
Director James Woolsey and
Attorney General Janet Reno have
hailed the cooperation, but Reno
said yesterday she did not know
how well they worked together
before her arrival last year.
Cooperation has been fine the
past couple years, the congression
al official said, but the government
doesn't have a clear idea of the
investigative effort from 1986
through 1991, a period when
Ames far outspent his salary.
Government sources have said
the Ames investigation began two
years ago, but suspicion that a
Soviet mole had penetrated U.S.
intelligence was aroused in 1985.
The Senate panel also wants
more information about exactly

how and when Ames was recruited
by the Soviets, including any role
his wife may have played.
In August 1985, Ames married
Maria del Rosario Casas. When he
was stationed in Mexico City dur
ing 1981-83, she was a cultural
attache there for Colombia, her
native land, and a paid CIA source.
Ames' attorney, Plato Cacheris,
said Ames was not talking with
authorities. Cacheris visited Ames
in custody Wednesday.
A hearing on the couple's con
tinued detention without bail was
postponed until Tuesday.
Shortly afler the arrests, the
CIA informed Congress it had rea
son to believe that Ames' alleged
disclosures had led to the deaths of
10 U.S. agents, according to
another congressional official.
"We've been given a number,
but at the same time we've been
told the damage assessment is just
starting" and the death figure
could go higher. This official cau
tioned that it had not been made
clear that the link between Ames
and the deaths could be proved.
In Moscow, Foreign Intelli
gence Service spokesman Yuri
Kobaladze told The Associated
Press the reports of 10 deaths
were "speculations."
