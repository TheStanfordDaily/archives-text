U.S. military cuts back
FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - The
next round of cutbacks in U.S. military
forces in Europe will shut nine Army
installations in Germany and a Air Force
base in England, officials said yesterday.
The announcement marked the first
details on where planned cutbacks would
fall following the Clinton administra
tion's decision to cut troop strength in
Europe to 100,000 by 1996.
The U.S. Army said it was closing and

returning to Germany nine more instal
lations, bringing to 550 the number of
facilities fully or partially returned to
Germany since the cuts began in 1990
with the Cold War's end.
All the Army installations listed for
closure in the latest announcement were
located in and around Karlsruhe in
southern Germany.
With the Army and Air Force troop
cuts and others previously announced,
about 100,000 U.S. soldiers will be left in
Europe by 1996.
