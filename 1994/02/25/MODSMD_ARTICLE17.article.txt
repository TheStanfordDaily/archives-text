University's compromise
on tuition remission for
graduate students is fair

Government funding
of research has been a touchy
issue at Stanford in recent
years, but the University has ham
mered out a good compromise for
the system that will replace gradu
ate student tuition remission.
Currently, tuition for graduate
students working on federally-spon
sored projects is billed as an indirect
cost — an expense that is not direct
ly linked to the research.
Starting in 1997, Stanford will
use a different system to account
for tuition costs of graduate stu
dents when University researchers
submit funding proposals.
The changes announced last
week call for researchers outside
the School of Medicine to ask for 40
percent of full-time tuition per
graduate student assistant as a
direct cost when they submit grant
proposals. (The Medical School will
charge tuition at a 50 percent rate).
Since such students are now
charged 62 percent of full tuition,
the University will have to make up
the rest from its pool of general
funds. This revised system will cost
Stanford $2.1 million each year.
Even though the move will cost
money, the University has already
taken this expense into account in
its budget planning.
And it made the right decision to
make the change without protracted
stalling. Only a handful of schools
were still using tuition remission
when the Office of Management and
Budget announced that it would not

be allowed after 1997.
And even though some of those
institutions — including MIT —
filed protests along with Stanford,
the predictions of massive cuts in
the number of graduate students
aren't as dire as some officials sug
gested. When the announcement
was first made last year, some pre
dicted that Stanford might lose
financial support for up to 25 per
cent of its graduate students.
However, under the new system,
it is not likely that the situation will
change much. Since the University
will finance the deficit created by
the new accounting rules, there
should not be a significant decrease
in the number of graduate students
who serve as research assistants.
The only notable impact of the
change is that the costs of graduate
students will be a much more visi
ble component of grant proposals
now that they cannot be lumped
with other indirect costs.
Charles Kruger, vice provost and
dean of research and graduate poli
cy, has estimated that cost for a
graduate student research assistant
will rise by $500 per quarter under
the new plan. Although this may
make research proposals more
expensive, the new system will be
more fair because it will place Stan
ford on a level playing field with
other universities.
Agencies that support research
already know that they are helping
to finance student tuition. By mak
ing tuition a direct — as opposed to
an indirect — cost, the new system
will better show funding sources
how their money is spent.
In short, the compromise should
placate the government while
ensuring that research — and the
number of graduate students — is
not cut.
