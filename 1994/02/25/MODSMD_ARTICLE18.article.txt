On Feb. 25, 1975, 350 students marched on the office of University President
Richard Lyman to protest proposed cutbacks in financial aid to minority students.
Students at the rally asked the University to summarize its "vocal commit
ments" of affirmative action policies into a written policy, The Daily reported.
They also called for affirmative action to be extended to Asian-American students.
