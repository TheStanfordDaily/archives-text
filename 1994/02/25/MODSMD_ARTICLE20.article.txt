## Billie Mandel American students lack drive to protest 
### 
ON ONE OF countless hot, rainy
days in Managua, Nicaragua this
summer I sat scribbling furiously,
listening intently while a young, haggard
social science researcher explained the
nuances of Nicaraguan political partici
pation. All of a sudden he stopped, looked
me in the eye and asked me, "Why don't
the American students protest any
more?"
Voices of youth have ignited so much
revolution and change throughout histo
ry, all over the globe, and during the
1960s and 19705, it was often the Ameri
can student movements to whom the
Nicaraguans looked for inspiration to
persevere.
It seemed that he was asking for
insight into the comparative political
paralysis of his people, in a time when the
government was trying to consolidate
greater control. And I had no idea what to
tell him. But his question has remained
in the back of my head ever since, gnaw
ing away, demanding attention.
Talking to an American friend in Man
agua helped me get a clearer idea of the
situation. She was in her forties, who, by
the age of 17, had attracted FBI attention
by involving herself in anti-Vietnam
protesting and working in solidarity with
the local teacher's union.
In contrast to her experience, my
political consciousness was not really
born until I came to Stanford, when an
activist friend down the hall sat me down
and told me how the United States

trained Salvadoran death squads in mili
tary operations and how the U.S. had
been convicted by the International
Court of Justice for trying to overthrow
the Nicaraguan government. He chal
lenged me to write my senators, encour
aged me to get involved in helping shape
U.S. policy in Latin America and helped
me realize that my political input had
some significance.
But even then, and until I emerged
from the shelter of my intellectual Amer
ican milieu to experience Central Ameri
ca for myself, I believed that my political
consciousness had come too late. I was
sure that all the revolutions had already
been fought, that the world map was
drawn permanently, and that if I wanted
to participate in the process of creating
social justice, I would have to assist in
managing the consolidation of a global
community for which the structure had
already been determined.
So in light of my own experience, why
don't the American students protest any
more? We either don't believe we have
the power to change anything, or we
don't believe that there's anything left
that needs changing.
How did this happen? Perhaps the
media dilute the news, removing us from
it so much that we feel unaffected. Per
haps we are just desensitized by living in
an era when violence and injustice are
commonplace. Or maybe the nature of
modern warfare — the prevalence of eco
nomic rather than military intervention,

gradual compromising rather than out
right appropriation of women's rights,
gay rights, etc. — is generally too subtle
to trigger widespread active opposition.
Maybe it is a combination of these rea
sons; the largest act of public outrage I
have participated in was after the Rodney
King verdict, an instance in which the
media could not dilute the information
the public was receiving about particular
ly unsubtle injustice.
So how do we take back our voices and
our empowerment, given that students
have been at the vanguard of so many
powerful social movements all over the
world? My political consciousness was
born through confrontation with the
unsweetened truth — first by the global
vertigo of the revolutions in Eastern
Europe, then through increasing my
political education in an academic sense,
and finally reaching its height through
my experiences in Central America.
By living with a poor Mexican family,
finding starving Nicaraguan children on
my doorstep day after day and seeing full
color pictures as recent as my prom pho
tos of Salvadoran priests with their heads
blown open, I have been forced to the
conclusion not only that students have
the empowerment to protest, but that
there is something to protest about. And
now I can no longer be silent.
