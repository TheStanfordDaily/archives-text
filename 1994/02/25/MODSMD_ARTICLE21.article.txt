## Ethnic centers effectively promote international themes 
### 
AS MEMBERS of Hammarskjold,
the international student house
on campus, we experience first
hand the benefits of multiculturalism
and residential education at Stanford.
Among the members of our house are
two Pakistanis, a Russian, a Pole, a Ger
man, a couple of Taiwanese, a Viet
namese-American, an Australian, three
Indians, a Belgian, an African-American-
Swede, a Dane, a Norwegian, a Scot, a
Cypriot, a Singaporian, a Malaysian and
an Icelander.
We've spent many hours discussing
international, national and personal
issues over dinners that we prepare,
and have often been surprised at the
very different perspectives that people
from many cultures bring to the
table.
The current push to cut the budgets
of the ethnic centers on campus is dis
turbing to us because it demonstrates
that the University administration con
siders multiculturalism a luxury that is
not central to the educational mission

of the University. We beg to differ.
We hold that one of the most essen
tial qualities Stanford can hope to
teach its students is the ability to work
with others, transcending short-sighted
boundaries of race, religion, and
nationality to find optimal, and possi
bly inspired, solutions to the problems
that we face, both as a nation and as a
global community. As the borders of
the world are transformed, Stanford
should be a leader in equipping stu
dents to interact with our neighbors in
the global village.
In our view, international students
and American students from minority
cultures are all part of the spectrum of
diversity at this University. We there
fore cringe at the suggestion of budget
cuts which could limit the types of stu
dents recruited to Stanford.
"A leading university must always
look to the future," wrote Provost Con
doleezza Rice in The Daily of Jan. 19.
We could not agree more. As global
barriers to both trade and communica

tion fall by the wayside, we must pre
pare ourselves. The 21st century will
reward global cooperation and cross
cultural communication to an unprece
dented degree. If the students of this
University are to lead effectively into
the next century, it is absolutely essen
tial that they be prepared to operate in
an environment characterized by a
greater diversity than they have ever
known.
This is why cutting into the operat
ing budgets of the ethnic centers
would be unwise. The Asian-Ameri
can, Chicano, black and Native Ameri
can centers have been effective con
duits for diverse students. According
to student testimony, those centers
encouraged them to come to Stanford
and helped them stay in school.
Through community service programs
they also introduce elementary and
high school students to the possibility
of attending Stanford, thereby
recruiting the diverse students who
will enhance the "international

themes in our educational and
research programs" that Rice values
so highly.
What Stanford students need to
realize is that the administration is
using the economic rationale of budget
cuts to reshape the services and type
of education that Stanford will pro
vide. They are doing so in a way which
can only be detrimental to the educa
tion of well-rounded, competent stu
dents.
What this administration needs to
realize as it "restructures" the Univer
sity budget to fit its educational priori
ties is that "international themes" on
campus are effectively promoted by a
culturally diverse and well-supported
student body.
