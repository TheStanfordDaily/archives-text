# Stanford should focus on arts to improve standing
## 
### 
I find it distressing that Stanford is
being ignored by the nation's top high
school seniors in favor of other univer
sities. However, I don't find it nearly
as surprising as do the Board of
Trustees and the Faculty Senate. It is,
after all, very difficult to compete with
the other "great" universities in this
country when Stanford itself is rapidly
losing sight of what makes a great uni
versity in the first place.
In its zeal to balance Stanford's
budget, the University bureaucracy has
repeatedly sent the message that both
performing and visual arts programs
aren't important enough to be a priori
ty during these tough times. The Music

Department is woefully underfunded,
and two years ago, the number of grad
uate students the department is able to
accept was cut in half. The Drama
Department and many visual arts pro
grams have faced either crippling cuts
in funding or eradication altogether.
The arts have clearly been placed on
the proverbial "B" list, and everyone at
Stanford knows it.
The only problem is that high
school seniors — especially the kind
of well-rounded, talented and intelli
gent students Stanford is having trou
ble attracting — also know it. Just
because fewer people choose to major
in music, art and drama doesn't mean
that these programs don't play an
integral part of the lives of Stanford
students, or that they aren't some of
the programs that really serve to
attract potential frosh. The truly

"great" universities know this to be
true.
Harvard and Princeton, for exam
ple, have always treasured their music
departments because these schools
realize how vital these pursuits are to
creating a well-rounded, active learn
ing environment. This is not to say
that these departments are immune to
budget cuts during tough times. It
should be noted, though, that you
would never find the kind of discrep
ancy between the quality of Ivy
League schools' fine arts and engi
neering departments like that existing
at Stanford. Our University, even in
good financial times, has never made
it a priority to nurture the arts.
It is no wonder, therefore, that the
arts are such an easy target when a
budget crisis hits. These departments
are underdeveloped, and at budget

time, when the Board of Trustees
assesses which departments are the
University's strongest, the arts are
never among them. Harvard, Prince
ton and Yale, like many other truly
"great" schools, should be commended
for realizing what a vital contribution
the arts make to a university commu
nity. Stanford's policy makers, on the
other hand, need to rethink their pri
orities.
It is high time the Board realizes that
its short-sighted views about the arts at
Stanford makes it impossible for us to
offer the same enriching learning envi
ronment of other top schools. This is a
crucial factor behind why Stanford is
being spurned by more and more of our
nation's most talented high school
seniors.
