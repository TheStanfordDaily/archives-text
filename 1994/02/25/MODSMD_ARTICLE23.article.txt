## Acting my age: a personal Rocky Horror story 
### 
FIFTEEN-YEAR-OLDS just don't
do it for me. But there I was, doing
the lip tango with some 15-year-old
Paly brat last Saturday night. Scanning
the movie theater out of the corner of my
eye for potential undercover cops pre
pared to pounce and nail my butt for
statutory rape. Wondering if I was going
to get into a cat fight with some heroin
thin 15-year-old girlfriend undoubtedly
waiting in the wings. Pondering the
frightening possibility that if 1 felt up my
young Romeo I might find he hadn't even
gotten to the crucial adolescent body hair
stage yet.
It's just a jump to the left.
It was all one more leg in my journey
to find the fountain of youth. All to com
plete a rite of passage that — along with
sex, alcohol and asymmetrical haircuts —
I would have been better served experi
menting with back in eighth grade, when
anything and everything was deathly
embarrassing. All to open my eyes to a
tempting world that had remained just
out of my reach. All to see the "Rocky
Horror Picture Show."
And then a step to the right.
Starting as several fine, upstanding

Stanford students, the five of us clus
tered like refugeed window shoppers lost
in search of a Land's End outlet in the
courtyard of the Varsity Theater in Palo
Alto, I was feeling ancient. Staring at the
glue-sniffing, leather-and-chains, best-
Doc Marten's-Daddy 's-Silicon-Valley
vice-presidency-could-buy high school
kids frolicking about, I realized my J.
Crew poster-child existence had rendered
me much too old for such a deviant mile
stone. Gazing in terror at the reflection in
the shaved sides of the large-headed 18-
year-old bounding our way, I pondered
whether anyone would find our corpses
dumped in the Foothills.
Creature of the night.
This veritable Ralph from "Lord of the
Flies" had come to ask if we were virgins
— film-watching virgins, that is. A term
which hadn't struck such fear in my
heart since the fourth grade, when Robyn
Steger asked me if I was one and I
answered a firm "no," thinking I had
finally won her wily acronym game. My
now 21-year-old sheepish "yes" was fol
lowed by him painting a slut-red drug
store lipstick "V" on my forehead twice as
thick as every other victim's, even after I

had asked him to draw mine with
panache, a word as puzzling to his
microwaved mind as "virgin" was to the
pre-pubescent me.
A toast to absent friends.
So we timidly entered the theater,
fearing the anarchic frenzy of our hosts,
whose cumulative life span could not
even hope to approach our individual
SAT scores. Fearing we had just forked
over an hour's worth of University mini
mum wages to be humiliated in front of a
theater crowd of questionable mental
capacity, including special guest adult Joe
Jonah Euclid, the roving typewriter guy
at Tresidder. Fearing we were about to
enter a Miss Teen Marquis de Sade
pageant sponsored by Fisher-Price and
Sassy magazine.
Come up to the lab and see what's on
the slab.
We bravely marched in, gazing sympa
thetically at all the scarlet-lettered teens
around us. Only to be corralled up on
stage and introduced to the screams of
the unnaturally pale crowd with its mul
ticolored hairdos. To be goaded by the
costumed cast, a conspicuous array of the
most poorly fitting Harley-Davidson

bondage gear this side of Frederick's of
Hollywood.
To be paired with pre-adolescent
nymphs in a kissing contest that I, for
one, found offensive, distasteful and con
trary to my stringent moral standards.
Yet to participate, knowing that several
hours of fervent prayer would save me,
while all the young, impressionable souls
in the group would go straight to hell in
24 hours or less.
Give yourself over to absolute plea
sure.
Finally they let us go and we melted
away into anonymity. Settled back to
watch the hypnotic lips and attractively
chipped teeth during the credits. Kicked
up our tired, old feet to enjoy the lingerie
exploits of the roamy live cast, periodically
shielding the eyes of the youngsters in the
row behind us. Relieved somewhat by the
knowledge that none of the 10 Command
ments or any state sodomy laws were to be
broken by our unsheltered teen compatri
ots, and only the movie remained.
Late-night, double-feature picture
show.
And as the pristine Brad and Janet
frolicked about on-screen, reveling in a

newfound world of kinky platform heels
and alien transsexuals, I discovered
along with them. Looking at the 12-year
old Casper the friendly waif acting the
part of the pumped and tanned on-screen
Rocky, I managed to finish a chapter in
my incomplete book of adolescence. Try
ing to pick up the steps to the Time
Warp, I had gotten just as hooked on the
event as every Oxy-lO poster-child in the
joint.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really
drives you insane.
Even on Geritol, I would go again. To
observe the crowd, breaking curfew just
to shout jokes in between the lines. To
Time Warp flabby-arm-in-taut-arm with
the dancers in the aisles, busting out of
my post-teen complacency to the chagrin
of the tiny shreds of self-dignity I have
left. To hold my ground in MTV's demo
graphics range. To lose a few years and a
little control.
Don't dream it, be it.

We bravely marched in, gazing sympa
thetically at all the scarlet-lettered teens
around us. Only to be corralled up on
stage and introduced to the screams of
the unnaturally pale crowd with its mul
ticolored hairdos. To be goaded by the
costumed cast, a conspicuous array of the
most poorly fitting Harley-Davidson

bondage gear this side of Frederick's of
Hollywood.
To be paired with pre-adolescent
nymphs in a kissing contest that I, for
one, found offensive, distasteful and con
trary to my stringent moral standards.
Yet to participate, knowing that several
hours of fervent prayer would save me,
while all the young, impressionable souls
in the group would go straight to hell in
24 hours or less.

Finally they let us go and we melted
away into anonymity. Settled back to

row behind us. Relieved somewhat by the
knowledge that none of the 10 Command
ments or any state sodomy laws were to be
broken by our unsheltered teen compatri

Silly wabbit, bondage is for kids.

FIFTEEN-YEAR-OLDS just don't
do it for me. But there I was, doing
the lip tango with some 15-year-old
Paly brat last Saturday night. Scanning
the movie theater out of the corner of my
eye for potential undercover cops pre
pared to pounce and nail my butt for
statutory rape. Wondering if I was going
to get into a cat fight with some heroin
thin 15-year-old girlfriend undoubtedly
waiting in the wings. Pondering the
frightening possibility that if 1 felt up my
young Romeo I might find he hadn't even
gotten to the crucial adolescent body hair
stage yet.
It's just a jump to the left.
It was all one more leg in my journey
to find the fountain of youth. All to com
plete a rite of passage that — along with
sex, alcohol and asymmetrical haircuts —
I would have been better served experi
menting with back in eighth grade, when
anything and everything was deathly
embarrassing. All to open my eyes to a
tempting world that had remained just
out of my reach. All to see the "Rocky
Horror Picture Show."
And then a step to the right.
Starting as several fine, upstanding

Stanford students, the five of us clus
tered like refugeed window shoppers lost
in search of a Land's End outlet in the
courtyard of the Varsity Theater in Palo
Alto, I was feeling ancient. Staring at the
glue-sniffing, leather-and-chains, best-
Doc Marten's-Daddy 's-Silicon-Valley
vice-presidency-could-buy high school
kids frolicking about, I realized my J.
Crew poster-child existence had rendered
me much too old for such a deviant mile
stone. Gazing in terror at the reflection in
the shaved sides of the large-headed 18-
year-old bounding our way, I pondered
whether anyone would find our corpses
dumped in the Foothills.
Creature of the night.
This veritable Ralph from "Lord of the
Flies" had come to ask if we were virgins
— film-watching virgins, that is. A term
which hadn't struck such fear in my
heart since the fourth grade, when Robyn
Steger asked me if I was one and I
answered a firm "no," thinking I had
finally won her wily acronym game. My
now 21-year-old sheepish "yes" was fol
lowed by him painting a slut-red drug
store lipstick "V" on my forehead twice as
thick as every other victim's, even after I

had asked him to draw mine with
panache, a word as puzzling to his
microwaved mind as "virgin" was to the
pre-pubescent me.
A toast to absent friends.
So we timidly entered the theater,
fearing the anarchic frenzy of our hosts,
whose cumulative life span could not
even hope to approach our individual
SAT scores. Fearing we had just forked
over an hour's worth of University mini
mum wages to be humiliated in front of a
theater crowd of questionable mental
capacity, including special guest adult Joe
Jonah Euclid, the roving typewriter guy
at Tresidder. Fearing we were about to
enter a Miss Teen Marquis de Sade
pageant sponsored by Fisher-Price and
Sassy magazine.
