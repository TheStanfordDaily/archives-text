## Defense can't hold Stanford 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
One is tempted to wonder what game USC head
coach Cheryl Miller was watching last night in Maples
Pavilion.
After witnessing Anita Kaplan pump in a career
high 34 points against her Trojans, Miller remarked,
"I thought we did a good job in spurts of stopping her."
The problem was that the normally effective Tro
jan defense was only able to stop Kaplan in spurts, and
leaked the rest of the time.
Why did the Trojan barrier leak? The answer lies in
the fact that Stanford did everything differently than
it did in its January 30 loss at USC. That night, the
Women of Troy's All-American center Lisa Leslie
scored 34 points to eclipse Val Whiting's Pacific 10
Conference all-time scoring mark, and lead her team
to an 81-73 victory.
"After the first time we played USC, I told my team
that the 'S' on our jerseys was for 'Stupid'," said Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer.
Last night, however, Stanford showed what the "S"
really stands for, as Leslie took a back seat to Kaplan,
just as Kaplan and the Cardinal squad had planned
before the game.
The team knew that containing Leslie would be the
key to success. "We didn't let [Leslie] isolate on Anita
like she did in the first game," said Stanford forward
Rachel Hemmer.
Leslie's trouble defending against Kaplan, as well
as her season-low eight points (down from her 22.1
per game average), was explained after the contest in
several ways.
"Stanford didn't do anything. Lisa just had an off
night," Miller said.
But Stanford personnel pointed to a different
explanation — ball denial.
"For the first six minutes of the game, I don't think
Lisa touched the ball," VanDerveer said. "Sometimes
we had three or four people on her and it just frus
trated her," Kaplan said.
The frustration factor might have contributed to
Leslie's apparently soft play on defense against
Kaplan, whose 17-for-26 shooting from the field was
composed of an unusually high number of uncontest
ed shots.
"Anita did a real good job finishing," VanDerveer
said.
