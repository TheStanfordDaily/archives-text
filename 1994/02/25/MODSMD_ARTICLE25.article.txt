# Cardinal pounds USC
## Kaplan's 34 points lead unstoppable women 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
"Kaplan lost her mind."
With those four words, USC women's
basketball coach Cheryl Miller effectively
summarized what she and 5,595 other
Maples Pavilion spectators witnessed last
night during Stanford's 80-50 massacre of
her No. 6-ranked Trojans.
Indeed, from the opening tap to her
exit before a thunderous standing ova
tion with 2:47 remaining, Cardinal
junior center Anita Kaplan owned the
evening.
Scoring a career-high 34 points on 17-
of-26 field goal shooting, Kaplan added
seven rebounds — including six on the
offensive glass — as No. 11 Stanford (17-
5, 10-3) moved to within a game-and-a
half of the frontrunning Trojans (19-3,
12-2) in the Pacific 10 Conference stand
ings.
"I was just throwing the ball up there
and getting lucky," a humble Kaplan said
of an array of hook shots and layups that
marked Stanford's most prolific individu
al showing of the season.
"It's called practice, Anita, not luck,"
corrected Cardinal head coach Tara Van-
Derveer.
Whether by practice or luck, a measure
of revenge may have also helped Kaplan,
who turned the tables in the renewal of a
much-anticipated battle with USC for
ward and Naismith Award candidate Lisa
Leslie.
In fact, Kaplan's 34 points matched the
career-high posted by Leslie in the teams'
first meeting, an 81-73 Trojan victory Jan.
30 in Los Angeles.
"Lisa wasn't playing defense very well,
and I think frustration played a part," said
Kaplan, who noted that she never heard
Leslie call for help in USC's man-to-man
defensive scheme.
Whatever the reason for its center's
command performance, the Cardinal
played like a team on a mission through
out the contest.
After an early exchange of baskets,
senior guard Christy Hedgpeth nailed a
jumper four minutes into the game to give

Stanford the lead for good at 6-5.
Then Kaplan took charge. Connecting
on a 12-footer at the 14:58 mark, she first
embarked on a personal 12-2 run that
left Stanford ahead 18-7 and forced
Miller to call a timeout less than four
minutes later. Showing no signs of a
letup, Kaplan then made four of the Car
dinal's next five field goals before Van-
Derveer pulled her with just under five
minutes left in the period and Stanford
up 28-19.
Hedgpeth, the game's other offensive
star, took the brief opportunity hit a
three-pointer and a pair of layups for
seven of her 16 points as the Cardinal
went into the locker room with a comfort
able 40-27 advantage.
"We made a statement tonight. We
wanted to come out right away and play
better, and we did," VanDerveer said.
The second half spelled more of the
same punishment for the Trojans, who cut
the lead to single digits only once (at 40-
32) and allowed it to grow as large as 33
(at 75-42) while the Cardinal pulled to the
final 30-point margin.
"When things go your way you just pick
up momentum," VanDerveer explained.
"At 20 and 22 points, the game just got
away from them."
Aside from 14 more points from
Kaplan, the second period became note
worthy for one accomplishment by Stan
ford forward Rachel Hemmer.
Having scored two points before the
intermission, the junior needed just one to
reach 1,000 on her career. Hemmer final
ly got that point, to the applause of an
appreciative crowd, by hitting the first of
two free throws at the 13:16 mark.
Hemmer, now the 17th player in school
history to reach that statistical milestone,
recorded a "double-double" with 10 points
and 10 rebounds on the night.
The Cardinal will next attempt to
avenge the other loss from their infamous
L.A. weekend when the UCLA Bruins (15-
8, 10-4) arrive at Maples tomorrow night
at 7:30 p.m. Led by Natalie Williams, the
Pac-10's leading scorer and rebounder,
the Bruins rallied to defeat California 90-
85 in Berkeley last night.
