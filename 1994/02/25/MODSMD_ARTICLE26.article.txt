# Men breach Trojan wall
## Hoopsters pull off 66-55 victory at USC 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
The Stanford men's basketball team
fought its way out of a deep hole last night
against USC, and in the end was rewarded
with a brighter outlook on the rest of its
season.
Playing on the road, the Cardinal (14-8,
7-6 in the Pacific 10 Conference) embarked
on a 24-12 scoring run in the game's final
minutes to pull out a 66-55 victory over the
Trojans (13-10, 5-9) and guarantee itself a
winning record this season.
The Cardinal started off sluggishly,
falling behind 11-0 after two minutes of
play. As a result, the team was forced to
play catch-up basketball for the rest of the
half.
In the contest's early moments, USC
overwhelmed Stanford with its 1-2-2 zone
defense, a style which caught the squad off
guard. The Cardinal responded by throw
ing the ball away on numerous occasions.
"We were tentative early on," said Stan
ford coach Mike Montgomery. "We played
as if we were afraid to make mistakes and
you can't play that way."
Instead of panicking about the early
deficit, however, Montgomery simply
inserted some of his bench players into the
lineup and watched them tear apart the
Trojan defense.
Fueled by pinpoint passing from back-up
guard Warren Gravely, Stanford got on a
roll. Gravely tallied four assists in the peri
od, including a lob pass to Bart Lammersen

which gave the Cardinal its first lead late in
the half at 18-17.
"Our bench got us back into rhythm,"
said Montgomery. "Warren Gravely ran the
ball club for us and made the offense go."
Gravely's passing also helped reserve
forward Darren Allaway rack up six first
period points.
"Darren was doing a great job stepping
up and asking for the ball," said Gravely in
a post-game radio interview. "He made it
easy for me."
The lead seesawed until the Stanford
squad made its run at the end. Freshman
Brevin Knight sparked the rally with clutch
free-throw shooting that helped his team
break a 43-43 deadlock and dart past the
Trojans.
The 5-foot-10 point guard converted an
impressive 10 of 12 charity-stripe shots on
the night, most of which came down the
stretch to bury USC.
"Brevin Knight is a good free throw
shooter," said Montgomery. "We tried to
keep the ball in his hands so he'd get to
shoot them at the end."
The victory not only boosted team
morale by halting a three-game losing
streak, but it also propelled Stanford into
the coveted fourth-place position in the
Pac-10. If the Cardinal is able to hold that
fourth-place spot, it just might earn a trip
to NCAA postseason play.
"We've got a chance," said Montgomery,
"There's no guarantee the fourth-place
