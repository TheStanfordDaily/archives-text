# Full weekend for men gymnasts
## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
It's time for big competition this weekend, but
nobody will worry about Stanford's most infamous
rival, the California Golden Bears.
Stanford's two-time defending national champi
on men's gymnastics team will face both Cal and No.
9-ranked UCLA at Berkeley today. The Cardinal will
then host the UCLA Bruins and No. 7 Michigan Sat
urday. Indeed, with two top-ten teams on its hands,
Stanford will show no concern for the unranked
Golden Bears.
"Cal will be no factor," said head coach Sadao
Hamada.
On the other hand, Hamada said he believes the
talents of the Bruins and the Wolverines are under
rated.
National rankings were released last week based
on the average of a given team's three highest scores
in competitions to date. Michigan and UCLA, like
No. 6 Stanford, received the short end of the stick
because each university has had only three meets so
far.
In gymnastics, a squad need only submit its three
best scores from the regular season to make a bid for
the NCAA Regional Championships. Therefore,
most top-caliber teams start the year off slowly and
pace themselves for national aspirations as the sea
son progresses.
"UCLA scored 280.25 (out of 300) last weekend,

and Michigan is capable of scoring above 280,"
Hamada said. "They're underrated because they've
had very few meets. Whatever team that can go 280
in a meet belongs right at the top."
The coach expects high scores from these squads
again this weekend. UCLA may reach such heights
with the combination of sophomore U.S. National
Team member Steve McCain, freshman Canadian
National Team member Doug Macey, highly-touted
freshman Spencer Slaton, and a support cast of solid
all-around performers. Meanwhile, the Wolverines,
according to Hamada, will utilize their depth and
consistency.
However, the Cardinal is also prepared to light up
the score board. Two weeks ago against Brigham
Young, Stanford posted a 282.35, the highest dual
meet score recorded in the nation that weekend.
Against UCLA and Michigan, the Cardinal hopes to
climb even higher on the point-scoring ladder.
"Our goal for both days is to go 285-plus," Hama
da said. "It could happen either day, if not Friday,
then definitely Saturday. I'm very confident right
now with how we're doing. The guys are more con
sistent, there's more hitting and less missing of rou
tines, and we've improved dramatically on the
vault."
While posting high scores this weekend is an
important objective for Stanford, it will not be what
Hamada calls the main "theme" for his team. Above
