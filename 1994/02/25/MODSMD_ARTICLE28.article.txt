# Tennis takes on Arizona duo
## 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
Call it a "Mini National Team Indoors." Except it's a
week early. And at Stanford. And outdoors.
Regardless of these minor differences, this weekend's
dual matches against No. 13-ranked Arizona and No. 8 Ari
zona State give the Stanford women's tennis team a prac
tice run before it heads to Madison,Wis. next weekend for
the formidable National Team Indoors tournament.
In Madison the second-ranked Cardinal will play four
matches against four top-20 teams, so what better way to
prepare than by playing two matches against two top-15
teams?

"You can't lose your focus or not be in shape," said Car
dinal head coach Frank Brennan about consecutive com
petitive matches. "It's a little different dynamics."
The Stanford Tennis Stadium starts to heat up today at
1:30 p.m. when the Wildcats (6-2) come hunting for their
biggest win of the season. Three weeks ago this Arizona
squad slipped and fell at home against the same UC-Santa
Barbara team that the Cardinal slaughtered on Tuesday,
9-0.
But these 'Cats have been ferocious of late, winning
three of their last four, including victories over No. 8 USC
and over their cross-desert rivals, Arizona State.
