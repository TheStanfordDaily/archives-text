# Tennis takes on Arizona duo
## 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
Call it a "Mini National Team Indoors." Except it's a
week early. And at Stanford. And outdoors.
Regardless of these minor differences, this weekend's
dual matches against No. 13-ranked Arizona and No. 8 Ari
zona State give the Stanford women's tennis team a prac
tice run before it heads to Madison,Wis. next weekend for
the formidable National Team Indoors tournament.
In Madison the second-ranked Cardinal will play four
matches against four top-20 teams, so what better way to
prepare than by playing two matches against two top-15
teams?

"You can't lose your focus or not be in shape," said Car
dinal head coach Frank Brennan about consecutive com
petitive matches. "It's a little different dynamics."
The Stanford Tennis Stadium starts to heat up today at
1:30 p.m. when the Wildcats (6-2) come hunting for their
biggest win of the season. Three weeks ago this Arizona
squad slipped and fell at home against the same UC-Santa
Barbara team that the Cardinal slaughtered on Tuesday,
9-0.
But these 'Cats have been ferocious of late, winning
three of their last four, including victories over No. 8 USC
and over their cross-desert rivals, Arizona State.
The Sun Devils (5-2) will light
up the Stanford Tennis Stadium
tomorrow at noon, bringing with
them junior Kori Davidson. This
Ail-American plays No. 1 singles
and teams with Meredith Geiger
at No. 2 doubles. Undefeated in
dual-match play, Davidson is a
Babe Ruth-type hitter â€” she
swings for the fences and either
hits a winner or makes an error.
"She's your classic smash
and-basher," Brennan said.
"Sometimes they go in, some
times they don't go in, but she's
an All-American, so they usually
go in. . . . We don't know if she
moves very well because she
never has to; the point is usually
over as soon as she hits it."

Arizona's top player was made
from the opposite mold. As her
French origin suggests, senior
Celine Verdier has a classic Euro
pean style of play. She relies on
touch and quickness to win her
points, much like Stanford's own
top player Laxmi Poruri. But
sometimes touch just isn't
enough as last Saturday's Ari
zona State-Arizona desert dual
exemplified. Power pummeled
finesse with Davidson beating
Verdier 6-4, 7-5.
Despite the rankings, Bren
nan expects Friday's battle to be
the closest of the two.
"I think Arizona is going to be
a little trickier, even though ASU
is stronger on paper," Brennan
said. "I think [Arizona's] loss to
UCSB was a fluke. Everybody's
allowed to have a bad day."
The Cardinal has not used its
allotted "bad day" yet this sea

son. With an 11-0 record, the
Stanford team has had few close
dual meets. They have matched
up against only one top-10
school, No. 3 California, defeat
ing the Bears handily at Cal, 6-3.
Of Stanford's top six singles
players, four are undefeated.
Three of these four, sophomore
Beth Berris, senior Emma
Woodhouse and freshman San
dra De Silva, make up the bot
tom half of the lineup. The
fourth, Poruri, is the No. 1 play
er in the nation.
These four and their team
mates will have to play back-to
back strong matches for Stanford
to survive this weekend
unscathed. Then that learning
experience must be doubled, as it
will take back-to-back-to-back
to-back winning performances to
nab the National Teams Indoors
title next weekend.
