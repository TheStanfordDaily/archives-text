# 'It gets a lot tougher from here'
## Baseball Pac-10 play against ASU

The Stanford baseball team will look to start its Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division schedule off with a bang today
as it hosts defending conference champion Arizona State at 2
p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
Both teams arrive with a great deal of momentum as well
as a lotto prove. The No. 12 Cardinal (10-6) is riding the crest
of a three-game winning streak, while the No. 9 Sun Devils
(9-5) took two of three from conference powerhouse USC last
weekend.
Last season, the Sun Devils came out ahead in five of the
six meetings with the Cardinal, including all three at Sunken

Diamond, en route to a 46-20 overall record and the Six-Pac
championship.
Stanford coach Mark Marquess said he believes offense
will be the key for the successful team this weekend.
"If we're going to be competitive in our league we have to
continue to get better in all phases, but especially offensively
because it gets a lot tougher from here," he said.
Stanford's offense has peaked just in time for this series.
In its last six games the Cardinal has averaged 6.8 runs and
more than 10 hits per game. During Stanford's series at
Hawaii last weekend, junior second baseman Jed Hansen had
five hits in 12 at-bats with nine RBIs and three runs scored.
