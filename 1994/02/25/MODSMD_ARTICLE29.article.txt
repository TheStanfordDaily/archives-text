# 'It gets a lot tougher from here'
## Baseball Pac-10 play against ASU 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
The Stanford baseball team will look to start its Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division schedule off with a bang today
as it hosts defending conference champion Arizona State at 2
p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
Both teams arrive with a great deal of momentum as well
as a lotto prove. The No. 12 Cardinal (10-6) is riding the crest
of a three-game winning streak, while the No. 9 Sun Devils
(9-5) took two of three from conference powerhouse USC last
weekend.
Last season, the Sun Devils came out ahead in five of the
six meetings with the Cardinal, including all three at Sunken

Diamond, en route to a 46-20 overall record and the Six-Pac
championship.
Stanford coach Mark Marquess said he believes offense
will be the key for the successful team this weekend.
"If we're going to be competitive in our league we have to
continue to get better in all phases, but especially offensively
because it gets a lot tougher from here," he said.
Stanford's offense has peaked just in time for this series.
In its last six games the Cardinal has averaged 6.8 runs and
more than 10 hits per game. During Stanford's series at
Hawaii last weekend, junior second baseman Jed Hansen had
five hits in 12 at-bats with nine RBIs and three runs scored.

"Over the weekend, we start
ed off with the first game on Fri
day (a 6-3 loss to Hawaii) and we
didn't play very well," Hansen
said. "We had a little team meet
ing with the hitters and we want
ed to be really aggressive, and we
accomplished that on Saturday
and Sunday."
Also enjoying considerable
offensive success is junior first
baseman Dusty Allen, who has
bounced back from a subpar
1993 season to become a force in
the middle of the Stanford line
up. Allen has put together 11 hits
in his past 20 at-bats for a .550
average, including eight runs

scored and six RBIs. On the sea
son, Allen is batting .345 with a
team-leading six doubles and 14
RBIs.
"Right now, we've been swing
ing the bat pretty well," said
sophomore centerfielder Cale
Carter. "Our middle of the order
is just on a tear right now. [The]
three, four and five [slots] are
hitting unbelievably, and I think
we're ready to open up the Six-
Pac."
Ready or not, here come the
Sun Devils, who are on an offen
sive tear themselves, batting .341
with 17 home runs, 168 hits, 127
runs scored, and 114 RBIs in
only 14 games.
Pre-season first-team All-
American third baseman Antone
Williamson leads the charge with
a .326 batting average, three

home runs, 15 RBIs, and 16
walks. Williamson was listed by
Baseball America as the top colle
giate prospect for this year's
major league draft and the lead
ing contender to win Six-Pac
Player of the Year honors.
"Antone is one of the top two
or three players in the country,"
said Arizona State coach Jim
Brock. "If everything goes as
expected he should be a candi
date for many postseason hon
ors."
Marquess said the Cardinal
will have to get in a dominant
position if it hopes to find victory.
"We're going to have trouble
controlling them," Marquess
said. "We have to keep them
from scoring runs on us and
hopefully we'll be able to gener
ate some offense ourselves."
