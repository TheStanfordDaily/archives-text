# Palumbo-Liu departing to Harvard
## 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
In a move that could seriously threaten ef
forts to establish a program in Asian American
Studies, Comparative Literature Prof. David
Palumbo-Liu yesterday announced his intention
to accept a visiting professorship at Harvard
University next fall.
"There comes a time in one's life when one
must speak out," said Palumbo-Liu at a press
conference on the status of Asian American
Studies at Stanford yesterday. He is one of only

two Stanford professors who teach courses in
Asian American Studies.
Claiming that Harvard recognizes the impor
tance of Asian American studies, Palumbo-Liu
said he is "99 percent sure" that he will accept
their ofTer for a position in the departments of
English and East Asian Languages and Civiliza
tion.
He added that he has also interviewed for po
sitions at UC-Davis and UC-Irvine, but is wait
ing to hear from them.
"David's a real strong asset to Stanford and
particularly to Asian American Studies," Dean of

Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven said last night, adding
that "I don't know the circum
stances of him taking his
leave."
"I hope it's just a good career
development move for him, r
Shoven said. "I'd love to talk to
him about it to see how it fits
into his professional plans."
Shoven said that if Palum-


Palumbo-Liu
bo-Liu does leave Stanford, "we will
try to talk him into returning."
Palumbo-Liu came to Stanford
in 1990 to help the University's
offerings in Asian American Stud
ies. He has previously expressed dis
appointment at the University's
lack of support for Asian American
studies, as well as its failure to meet
certain personal commitments
made to him.
Anthropology Prof. Harumi
Befu, an ardent supporter of Asian
American Studies, pointed out that
History Prof. Gordon Chang and

Palumbo-Liu, the two professors
who teach courses in Asian Ameri
can studies, are only assistant pro
fessors. Neither "is in a position to
be able to devote time and effort" to
the development of a program, he
said.
Claiming that "it's a political
issue," Befu said that as assistant
professors, Chang and Palumbo-Liu
"can't afford to be sticking [their]
necks out."
Befu said he has discussed the
movement for a program with sev
eral administrators, including
Shoven and Provost Condoleezza
Rice.
"The uniform voice I hear from
all of them is that unless there is fac
ulty effort, there is no way in doing

this," he said.
Befu called it "a Catch-22 situa
tion" because "we don't have the
core people to be able to support this
movement."
"The administration has repeat
edly committed itself to multicul
turalism, at least on paper," he said.
"They come through with all kinds
of rhetoric, but no substance."
In addition to Palumbo-Liu and
Befu, several students spoke at the
press conference.
Senior Patty Tsai, a member of
Asian/Pacific Islanders for Educa
tion and Change (APECS), gave a
brief overview of the history of the
movement for an Asian American
Studies program at Stanford.
"The University has historically

maintained indifferent and/or dis
paraging attitudes to repeated calls
for an Asian American Studies pro
gram," Tsai said.
Tsai said that efforts to establish
a program in Asian American stud
ies began in the early 19705, when
students organized two courses and
submitted the first formal proposal
for a program to the administra
tion.
Pointing out that UC-Berkeley
and UCLA both established pro
grams in 1971, Tsai said, "If the
administration is to fulfill its com
mitment to multiculturalism as
its proclaimed mission since the
19605, it should take seriously the
need for an Asian American Stud
ies program after all these years."

ASSU senator Mork Murdock
discussed the role that the ASSU
Senate has played in the movement
to establish a program. He said
that the senate passed a resolution
last April, calling for "an in-depth
and ongoing faculty, staff and stu
dent initiative to develop and estab
lish an Asian American Studies
major."
Last year's resolution is "still the
sentiment of the ASSU .... We still
demand that the administration
truly support Asian American Stud
ies at Stanford," Murdock said.
Calling this "a critical point in
Asian American Studies," APECS
member Gerald Chen said that "the
administration must take action to
retain Chang and Palumbo-Liu."
