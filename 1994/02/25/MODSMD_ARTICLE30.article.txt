# Women go to Pac-10s
## Undefeated swimmers will try for another conference title in Long Beach State meet 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
The Stanford women's swimming
squad moves into the big time this week
end, taking a perfect dual-meet record
to the Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships this weekend in Long Beach.
Boasting a 44-straight dual meet win
ning streak and a No. 1 national rank
ing, the Cardinal hopes to repeat last
year's victory at the Pac-10 meet that
eventually led to its 1993 NCAA Cham
pionship. Last year Stanford won the
meet by accumulating 1,577 points — its
nearest competitor managed only 1,323
points.
The odds are definitely in favor of a
Cardinal repeat at the Pac-10 champi
onships. In fact, Stanford is the only
team to have won the title — the first
championship for the women was held in
1987 and the Cardinal have won every
one of them since.
In addition, Stanford is coming off of
its sixth straight undefeated dual-meet
season and has won back-to-back NCAA
championships. In his five years on the
Farm, coach Richard Quick has won
three NCAA titles.
The Pac-10 meet serves as a precursor
to the big show in Indianapolis in March,
but the competition in Long Beach will
still fall short of the quality squads the
Cardinal will face at the NCAA tourna
ment.
The Pac-10 tournament is, however,
the last opportunity that individual
Stanford swimmers have to qualify for
the NCAA tournament. Going into this

weekend's competition, three individu
als and a relay team have already quali
fied. Junior Jenny Thompson has made
times in the 100- and 200-yard freestyle,
the 100- and 200-yard butterfly and the
200-yard individual medley, while
senior Lea Loveless has qualified in the
100- and 200-yard backstroke. Junior
Becky Crowe earned a trip to Indianapo
lis with her time in the 200 butterfly,
while the 400-yard freestyle relay team
of sophomore Jessica Tong, Loveless,
sophomore Lisa Jacob and Thompson
posted a qualifying time as well.
The toughest challenge to the Cardi
nal should come from the sixth-ranked
Bruins of UCLA. Sprinter Richelle
Depold and distance swimmer Lori
Walker might pose problems for Stan
ford in their events, while the Cardinal's
weakness in the breaststroke events
could also open up an opportunity for
UCLA.
In the distance events, the Cardinal
lost the 1993 Pac-10 Champ in the 1,650
free in Catherine Comanor, but fresh
man Sarah Anderson is already three
seconds faster than Comanor's Pac-10
winning time of 16:27.41.
In addition, Loveless will be swim
ming in her final Pac-10 meet and look
ing to defend her titles in both the 100-
and 200-yard backstroke. She already
owns nine individual and relay Pac-10
titles.
The meet runs Thursday through Sat
urday at the Belmont Plaza Olympic
Pool in Long Beach. Preliminary events
start at 11 a.m, while the finals are held
at 6 p.m.
