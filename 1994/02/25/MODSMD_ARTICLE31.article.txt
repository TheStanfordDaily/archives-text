# Spikers seek revenge during trip south
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
The No. 6-ranked Cardinal
volleyball squad will be primed
for revenge against No. 9 Long
Beach State and No. 2 USC dur
ing this weekend's crucial South
ern California roadtrip.
Last season, Stanford dropped
a four-game heartbreaker to the
Long Beach State 49ers in the
Mountain Pacific Federation
Tournament. That 15-13, 10-15,
15-9, 15-11 upset victory
knocked the Cardinal out of fur
ther playoff contention.
During the preseason this
year, Long Beach pulled off
another surprise by jumping on
the Cardinal 15-7, 16-14 in the
University of California at Santa
Barbara Tournament.
Boasting an overali 8-6 record
with an even 4-4 showing in the
MPSF, the 49ers will call upon
the services of junior outside hit
ter Martin Wagner to assume the

brunt of the offense. Leading his
squad with 291 kills, Wagner will
be set by senior David Hallaway,
who has tallied 535 assists on
season.
In addition to those impres
sive offense numbers, the 49ers
also pride themselves upon their
stringent defense. Senior outside
hitter Travis Barr finished ninth
in the league last season with
2.30 digs per game, and he is
heading on the right track again
this year with a team-high 103
digs already.
"Long Beach plays exceptional
defense," said Cardinal captain
Joe Burghardt. "They don't hit
as hard as a USC, but they have
a lot more call control, and
they'll make you work hard for
your points."
Nevertheless, the Cardinal is
confident about a victory against
the 49ers. "If we block and serve
well, and just play up to our
potential, we should definitely
beat them," Burghardt said.

However, against a tougher
USC team, it might be a different
story.
Going into the Saturday
match with a pristine 8-0 record
(7-0 in the MPSF), the Trojans
present an uphill battle for the
young Cardinal squad.
Led by a powerful combina
tion at the opposite and outside
hitting positions, USC boasts the
highest team hitting percentage
as of last week. Factor in senior
Chris Underwood's 198 kills and
Jason Mulholland's 165 kills, the
Trojans outdistance all MPSF
contenders with 421 kills against
only 105 errors for a .436 hitting
percentage.
However, hot on USC's heels
is a Stanford team which has tal
lied 342 kills with 100 errors —
good for a .434 average.
The two team's similar levels
of dominance were displayed
during the finals of the UCSB
tournament. Stanford harassed
the No. 2 Trojans for five sets

before succumbing to a 15-9, 6-
15, 15-8, 8-15, 15-9 match — the
only five-game affair USC has
entangled itself in this season.
"We're not going in there
wondering whether we can hang
with these guys or not,"
Burghardt said. "The UCSB
tournament told us we're right
up there with them. Now it's
only a matter of playing consis
tent volleyball and beating
them."
If revenge is not incentive
enough, the Cardinal will also try
to reclaim first place in the
MPSF, after they fell out of a
two-way tie with the Trojans last
week with a loss to No. 3 BYU.
"This is our biggest roadtrip
of the year," Burghardt said.
"Both teams are in our confer
ence, and these two teams,
including us, will probably be 1-
2-3 in our division this year.
We'll have a hard time catching
either team if we don't win both
games this weekend."
