## 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
While out to defeat both Uni
versity of Minnesota and UC-
Davis tonight, the Stanford
women's gymnastics team will
mainly focus on wreaking
vengeance on the Golden Bears.
This time, however, the battle
will take place on Cardinal terri
tory.
In Stanford's last home meet

of the sea
son, an invi
tati on a 1
sponsored
by Chili's
Bar and
Grill, the
team will be
up against
three oppo
nent s
including
Cal, a squad
it lost to ear
lier this sea
son across
the Bay.

Senior Cardinal gymnasts Mol
lie Brown and Laurie West will
be honored at the meet, which
begins at 7:30 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.
"Cal is our biggest competi
tion (in this meet)," said Stan
ford's head coach Breck Green
wood. "We need to beat them at
home, and win this invitational.
"To continue into regional
and national competition, we
need to be able to beat our peers.
Cal is one of our peers, but we
know we are a better team."
The meet is bound to be close
between No. 16 and No. 17
ranked Stanford and Cal, as the
Cardinal's highest score of the
season is 190.175 and Cal's top
score was 190.450 in Arizona.
Minnesota, currently ranked
No. 29, has a high score of
188.650 and the season high for
Davis is 183.865.
Junior Jene Elzie and fresh
man Katie Jennings will lead the
Cardinal as the team's two all
around competitors. Juniors
Meegan Lannin and Tina Snow
den along with sophomore
Hillary Anderson will deliver
floor routines with new tum
bling passes and perform two
other events as well.
"I really think we're going to
go in there, have fun, and show
people where we've gotten
since the first home meet,"
West said. "We can beat Cal in
our gym."

gymnasts Heather Schneider
and Lisa Washington. According
to head coach Alfie Mitchell, the
team is also very consistent on
the uneven bars, counting falls
in only three of its six meets so
far. Gymnast Cindy Tom leads
the Bears on this event, as well
as on the beam while Sirinda
Sincharoen and Mindy Ornellas
are the strongest all-around
gymnasts.
"It comes down to who

wants it
more,"
Mitchell
said. "It is
so close
(between
Stanford
and Cal)
that who
ever makes
the fewest
mistakes
will win the
meet.
Hopefully
it will be
us."

Though plagued by injuries
at the beginning of the season,
the Minnesota gymnasts are
rehabilitating and getting back
in the line-up. According to head
coach James Stevenson, this
recuperation, along with contin
ual improvement, account for
the team's range of scores,
which have spanned from 180 to
188.
The floor is the team's
strongest event, though it has
counted no falls on bars or beam
in the last three meets. Accord
ing to Stevenson, there are no
superstars on the team, and only
one gymnast competes in the all
around.
"Everybody contributes
equally on our team — individu
als shine for us everywhere,"
Stevenson said.
The Aggies are strongest on
bars and beam. Davis' top per
former in the all-around is
Cheryl Sidel, and Dawn Pavis
leads on the bars.
"We just want to go to Stan
ford and do some good, consis
tent gymnastics and complete
our routines," head coach,
Ray GoEdbar. *1 expect it to be a
close meet between Cal and
Stanford, but if we hit all our
routines, it could also be close
between Minnesota and us."
The competition tonight is
bound to be tight indeed, as can
be expected any time the Cardi
nal and the Bears clash. Stan
ford hopes the second meeting
will land it on top.
