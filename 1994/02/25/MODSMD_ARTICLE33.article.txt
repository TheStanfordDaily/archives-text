# Stanford women's golf swings to 8th in desert tourney
## 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
The desert can be a cruel place.
The Stanford women's golf team discovered this
earlier in the week at the 1994 Conquistadores/Chris
Johnson Arizona Invitational at the Randolph Park
North Golf Course in Tucson, Ariz. The Cardinal
women finished the three-day tournament in a tie for
eighth place in the 19-team field.
No. 1 Arizona State once again proved it is the
team to beat this season, capturing the competition
with 869 strokes, 26 shots better than the runner up,
No. 7-ranked UCLA. The No. 5 Cardinal finished 43
shots off the lead.

This performance was not an ideal way to begin
the spring season. Stanford had hoped to at least to
give the Sun Devils a run for their money at this con
test in the arid Southwest.
"Our goal is to narrow the gap vbetween Arizona
State and Stanford) between now and the NCAA
tournament," said Stanford head coach Tim Baldwin
before the tournament.
The Sun Devils were not in any mood to let Stan
ford carry out this aim, however. Comfortable in the
dry air, Arizona State did not allow any team within
reach past the very first tee. By the end of Monday's
first round they held a seven-stroke lead and just
kept expanding the gap over the next two days. Sun
Devil golfers captured the top three individual scores

with Heather Bowie leading the way with 214
strokes.
"Arizona State is extremely strong," Baldwin said.
"They have potentially five first-team All-Ameri
cans."
Despite the Sun Devils' ferocity, Stanford still had
a chance to place second entering Wednesday's final
round. Due in large part to strong second round per
formances by junior Jamille Jose and freshman
Mhairi McKay, the seventh-ranked college player in
the nation, the Cardinal found itself in fourth place,
only six strokes out of second and within striking dis
tance.
However, this aspiration was not to be realized.
During Wednesday's final round, 12 of the 19 teams

came in with lower totals than the Cardinal team.
This was not due so much to any collapse by the
Stanford squad, but rather a lack of improvement on
the previous days' scores. Normally, as teams grow
accustomed to a course as the tournament progress
es, their number of strokes fall.
Jose led the Stanford cause, finishing in a tie for
17th overall with 226 strokes. McKay and Junior
Amy Lawrence came in with 231 strokes, good for
36th, while freshman Andrea Baxter and senior
Melinda Daniels were two shots behind at 233 in
52nd place.
Despite the disappointing finish, hope springs
eternal. The Cardinal lady golfers will give it another
trv next weekend at San Jose State.
