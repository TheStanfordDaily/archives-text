# Statehood for Washington, D.C.?
## Lack of representation in Congress wrong, SNCC leader says 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh 
Civil rights activist James Forman spoke of the
political importance of granting citizens of Wash
ington, D.C. federal representation in Potter
Lounge last night.
A leader in the Statehood for New Columbia
movement — which aims to establish statehood for
Washington, D.C. — Forman told a gathering of
about 20 that without the power to vote for repre
sentatives in Congress, District of Columbia citizens
are being denied the political voice they deserve.
"How can we be a democracy if some 600,000
people who pay taxes don't have any voting power in
the Senate and House?" he asked.
Forman — the former executive coordinator of
the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee
(SNCC), a 1960s civil rights organization — is hope
ful that the Senate will pass a proposal for D.C.
statehood this spring. He claimed that statistics
indicate that 87 percent of U.S. citizens are in favor
of statehood for the nation's capital.
The struggle to establish statehood for D.C. was
just one issue Forman addressed in his discussion.
He also touched on the larger issue of voter regis
tration policy, emphasizing its potential for effect
ing profound sociaJ change.
Forman heralded the 1993 Voter Registration
Act — which will allow adults acquiring their

drivers' licenses to register to vote at the same time
— as an example of positive change on the horizon.
The act, which will be implemented in 1995, will
simplify the process of registering to vote tremen
dously, he said.
Forman highlighted the fact that 40 million U.S.
citizens are not registered to vote as a major prob
lem with American democracy, adding that the sim
plified registration process will likely reduce the
number of citizens who do not vote.
According to Forman, giving all citizens equal
voting power is a way of "trying to make the ideals
of democracy a reality for all Americans."
Forman related this current struggle to his work
as a civil rights activist in the 19605, describing his
role in SNCC as a full-time commitment to helping
blacks register to vote. He said his dedication to
voter registration advocacy was his way of continu
ing the struggle of his predecessors in the move
ment for racial equality.
He mentioned the anti-poll tax movement, the
1954 Brown vs. Board of Education decision man
dating the desegregation of public schools and Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s non-violent crusade for
racial equality as factors influencing his role in the
civil rights movement.
Forman also expressed thanks to those Stanford
students who joined the struggle for civil rights in
Mississippi during the early 19605.
