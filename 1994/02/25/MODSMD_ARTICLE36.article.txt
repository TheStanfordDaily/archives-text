# Students rap about CIV, DRs

### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
Members of the Student Advisory Group on
Undergraduate Education discussed the possibility
of condensing the entire system of distribution
requirements from nine to three and brainstormed a
number of ways to rework Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues classes in an open meeting last night.
The meeting, aimed at gathering student opinion
on aspects of undergraduate education, was another
in a series of open meetings held by the group this
quarter. The nine students who attended the meet
ing in Mariposa House centered their discussion
around the reported results of a meeting held yester
day morning by the Commission on Undergraduate
Education's subcommittee on breadth requirements.
In the subcommittee's meeting, faculty and stu
dents talked about combining the currently separate
World Cultures and American Culture requirements
into one under the CIV system, said sophomore
Laura Goodrich, a member of the subcommittee.
Senior Greg Gilchrist, another subcommittee
member, said the condensation of culture require
ments is in keeping with what the committee sees as
the theoretical purpose of the CIV system.
"CIV is an examination of cultures, not great
books or ideas. You're using books as tools to look at
a culture and see how they relate to themselves and
to outsiders," he said. "CIV is not intended to give
you your ideas — that was the whoie debate of the
'80s. You will learn ideas indirectly, but the real goal
is culture."
Other students disagreed with Gilchrist's view.
"The focus [of CIV] should be on ideas. The cultural
approach is vulnerable to political attacks and dis
tortion, giving up intellectual rigor for more popular
views," said sophomore Heyning Chang.
But sophomore Jolie Dyl said she feels that the
integration of the two cultural requirements could
be interesting in showing how the same ideas are
seen differently by distinct cultures.
"You could read 'A Room of One's Own' as an

example of what Western women need, along with a
Third World feminist," she said. "I'd rather see it
integrated."
Although the subcommittee has not yet finalized
its position on the CIV program, Gilchrist and
Goodrich said that the members have decided to rec
ommend that transfer students not be required to
take CIV. The group is also discussing the possibili
ty of reducing CIV from its current three quarter
requirement to two.
But senior Eddie Garcia, chair of the student
committee, said he thought the group should be
thinking more in general terms of what students
want to get out of an undergraduate education
instead of getting stuck on the structural difficul
ties.
"I'm concerned we're trapped in a way of think
ing, with nine DRs," he said.
Gilchrist said that the subcommittee is also con
sidering reducing the number of distribution
requirements. The proposed system would cover
three broad areas: science and mathematics, human
ities and social sciences.
Although students worried that such a general
system might defeat the purpose of having distribu
tion requirements, Goodrich said that many feel
that current system is too specific. However, she
added that the subcommittee is "still structuring."
The condensation could also give rise to new
courses under some of the areas, Gilchrist said. For
example, the subcommittee has discussed creating a
voluntary three-quarter course comparable to CIV
that would satisfy the science requirement.
"It would be a three-track sequence where you
look at a problem, [such as) failures and disasters,
natural or man-made. You could bring in everything
— physics, engineering, astronomy," he said.
However, Gilchrist added that the problem with
such a course is finding professors who would be
willing to "devote their life to it."
The student group plans to draft a report for the
commission, which will in turn release its findings in
May.
