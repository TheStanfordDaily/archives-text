# Living in the real 'Mad Forest'
## Students recall Romanian strife 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
All the world's a stage. This rings especially true
for a group of Romanian Stanford students who have
lived through the experiences depicted in the current
Drama Department production of "Mad Forest."
The play by Caryl Churchill dramatizes the events
of the Romanian revolution of 1989, showing the dif
ferent sides of life under a totalitarian dictator and
the current transition to democracy.
Gabriela Teodorescu, a sophomore majoring in
history, left Romania when she was eight years old,
two years after the 1979 defection of her father.
Teodorescu plays the character of Lucia in "Mad For
est."
Teodorescu said posters of the leader of Romania,
Nicolae Ceausescu, were placed in every building and

party propaganda was drilled into
students' heads in schools. The
set of "Mad Forest" is also cov
ered with posters of the dictator.
"[My father] was afraid of hav
ing his daughter brainwashed —
of turning against him," Teodor
escu said.
Teodorescu said she remem
bers when she was five years old
and saw Ceausescu on the televi
sion. "He was always on TV," she
said. Teodorescu walked up to
the television and turned it off.
When the guests at her house
asked her why she had done that,
she told them, "My dad hates this
man." There was dead silence in
the room.
"You didn't know who was
Securitate," Teodorescu said,
referring to the Romanian secret
internal security police.
Other Romanian students at
Stanford relate similar experi
ences. Mihai Popovici, currently a
graduate student in geophysics,
worked as a tour guide and engi
neer in Romania before defecting
to the West in 1986. Popovici and
his brother Andrei, a junior
majoring in physics, talked to the
cast of "Mad Forest" to give them
a sense of what it was like to live
in Romania.
Mihai Popovici said that he
would get into trouble as a guide
by "speaking too much." He
recalled one incident where he
was making political jokes in
English to a companion. He
noticed a woman looking strange
ly at him, and she asked him to
step outside.
When Popovici followed the
woman outside, she identified
herself as a captain in the Securi
tate and took down information
from him.
The students said the oppres
sive communist system was also
unable to deal with huge short
ages in essential consumer goods.
Central planning was unable to
predict what the demand for cer
tain products would be.
"You would wait one and a half
hours in line for bread, and they
would run out and you would
have to go somewhere else," said
Andrei Paraschivescu, a graduate
student in mathematics, who
came to the United States after
the 1989 revolution. He remem
bered once having to wait four
hours for cooking oil.
The shortages were a chronic
problem. "It wasn't occasionally,"
Paraschivescu said. "These were
basic things you can't do with
out."
People who decided that they
wanted to leave Romania had to
wait years before the bureaucracy
would give them a passport and
exit visa.
Popovici was working near the
border to Yugoslavia when he saw
his chance to leave the country.
He finished working before his
work permit expired, and thus
was still authorized to be near the
border. "The problem is not to

cross the border, the problem is to
get within the border," Popovici
said.
He went across the border at
night and stayed briefly with a
family friend in Yugoslavia. The
friend then drove him to the
Austrian border, where he
snuck around the guard tower at
night.
In Austria, Popovici was
placed in jail for two weeks and
then put in a refugee camp.
Popovici applied for political asy
lum to the United States
through the U.S. embassy and
was granted a visa after three
months. When he became a U.S.
citizen, he was able to send for
his brother in 1990.
Teodorescu said her father
already had a passport, because
he had to travel for his work in
the oil industry. He applied for a
visa by telling the officials that he
would be going on a trip.
Because so few people had
passports, Teodorescu's father
was able to gain approval from his
work committee to leave the
country. They granted the
approval believing that he would
never actually be able to leave.
When the visa came in the
mail, Teodorescu's father left the
same evening. "I knew that he
wasn't going to be back," Teodor
escu said.
After spending a year at a
refugee camp in Italy, Teodores
cu's father made it to the United
States. He then wrote to senators
and was able to get visas for
Teodorescu and her mother.
The relatives of people who
defected were often blacklisted
and followed. Teodorescu said
that her mother was fired from
her job after her father left the
country. Before leaving the coun
try, an anonymous man called her
mother with specific details about
everything her mother had done
for the last two years.
Andrei Popovici was also con
fronted when his brother left

Romania. The school principal
called him into his office and told
him to stop visiting the British
library. "He knew stuff about me
that somebody normally
shouldn't," Popovici said.
Both Andrei Popovici and
Paraschivescu were living in
Bucharest, Romania at the time
of the December 1989 revolu
tion.
Popovici went with a few
friends to the University Square,
where students staged protests
against the government. "Every
thing was surrounded by troops,"
Popovici said.
Then the guards shot into the
air, and snipers started shooting
from the tops of buildings. "It's
very fuzzy what happened,"
Popovici said.
Paraschivescu was at the build
ing where Ceausescu made his
last speech before seeing him
being whisked away in a heli
copter.
Ceausescu and his wife were
executed a few days later after a
quick military trial. "They killed
him fast so people who are in gov
ernment now wouldn't be dragged
down with him," Paraschivescu
said.
Teodorescu and Mihai Popovici
have seen the current production
of "Mad Forest" and said that it is
an accurate depiction of life in
Romania.
But Andrei Popovici said the
play's reception in Romania was
not so positive. The scene that
was most controversial to the
Romanian people depicts a moth
er who scoops some dropped eggs
back into a bowl so they can be
used later.
Popovici said that Romanians
complained that things really
weren't that bad. However,
Paraschivescu said, "I've seen
that done."
Recalled Andrei Popovici, "The
oppression was so great that peo
ple didn't have time to think
about anyone else."
