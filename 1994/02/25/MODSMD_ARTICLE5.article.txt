# Services to staff, faculty to be cut
## Health and Safety spared 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Faculty and staff housing will
take the hardest hit from budget
cuts to faculty and staff services
while environmental safety, for
now, will not be affected.
The Faculty and Staff Housing
Office will lose 25 percent of its
general funds next year. Person
nel Services is slated to have its
general funds cut 11 percent and a
5 percent cut is scheduled for Risk
Management.
All told, Faculty and Staff Ser
vices will slash 12 percent from its
current general funds. The cuts
were announced at an open forum
yesterday at Kresge Auditorium.
One office, Environmental

Health and Safety, is excluded
from the figures because they are
not going through the budget cut
ting process most University areas
are, said Barbara Butterfield, vice
president of faculty and staff ser
vices. The department will present
a review of its budget by mid-year,
she added.
"This is a very expensive enter
prise for the University," Butter
field said of the environmental ser
vices. "This particular group, be
cause of the importance of their
work and (complying with envi
ronmental regulations), is excused
from this exercise."
The total cuts, minus Environ
mental Health and Safety, will
trim about $445,000 from the
unit's $3,884,000 budget for
1993-1994.
Butterfield admitted that the
cuts to the housing office were
"somewhat extreme," and said
that the tasks of the housing
office may be sent to an outside
agency. The office helps Stanford
employees navigate the compli
cated California housing market
and finance housing. Also possi
ble, she said, is that the office
may have to begin service
charges on loans and mortgages
that the University offers to
employees.
The total 12 percent reduction
would also entail merging some
administrative areas, reducing
support for labor and employee
relations and training, contract
ing out the statistical analysis
work now done in the compensa
tion office, contracting out some
publication work and eliminating
the career counseling program,
Butterfield said.
Career counseling will not be
eliminated until the 1995-96 aca
demic year to help employees
who lose their jobs due to budget
cuts. A Palo Alto company,
Career Action Center, will also
help with career counseling next
year and will then likely take
over all the University's career
counseling work.
Butterfield said she plans for
budget reductions in the second
and third year of budget cuts to

come primarily from program
restructuring. Two such reforms
are already underway, she said,
including trying to improve the
way paid time off is accounted
for and the way policies are
reported.
Programs that Butterfield
said she will look at restructur
ing in the future include retire
ment and dental programs,
which she called "potential big
savers in redesign."
The dental plan could likely be
changed in several years to take
advantage of new managed care
dental contracts, she said.
Options for changing the retire
ment plan could include only giv
ing part of the money the Uni
versity contributes to benefits to
employees who leave after only a
short time at the University.
Other areas that will be exam
ined for redesign include the pro
cess of advertising job openings,
hiring employees and salary
increases, she added. In addition,
she said future redesign may
mean reducing the number of
personnel staff and lowering
some retirement contributions.
Tina Kass, personnel services
officer for the University, dis
cussed the preparations the Uni
versity is making to help employ
ees and managers deal with lay
offs.
Kass said three main goals of
her office are supporting the
decisions about layoffs that man
agers make, following applicable
laws and the University's own
rules about layoffs and making
sure the process is "humane."
The University will take sev

eral actions to ease the lay-off
process, Kass said. All employees
who are laid off will receive a
information folder on their job
loss, including a letter from But
terfield and Provost Condoleezza
Rice and information on what
services are available to help find
temporary or new employment.
Employees will also receive a
brochure titled "What If I'm
Laid Off?"
The University will also have
a one-hour orientation meeting
to help those who have been laid
off, and will provide information
to managers on the proper proce
dures for laying people off, alter
natives to layoffs and staff demo
graphics so that "staff reduc
tions should not have an unpre
dictable effect on staff demo
graphics," Kass said. The Uni
versity will help staff who are
laid off find programs to get
more job training or new jobs.
Butterfield said not enough
budget reduction plans have
been finalized for her to know
how many people will be laid
off. However, she said she did
not expect the number of lay
offs to hit the 1989-1990 level,
when about 250 employees
were laid off. About 150 to 180
employees are laid off every
year, she said.
Butterfield said she did not
know how many layoffs there
might be within Faculty and
Staff Services, but said she
hopes to cut most of the posi
tions that have to be cut through
attrition or cutting back the
amount of time people work on
certain jobs.
