## Stanford's accrediting body adopts diversity statement 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
Administrators and faculty
members expressed disappoint
ment yesterday that, despite
Stanford's objections, the region
al accrediting body responsible for
certifying the University's acade
mic standing has adopted a state
ment that will allow the body to
assess diversity in its evaluations.
The Western Association of
Schools and Colleges voted unani
mously Wednesday for the much
revised "Statement on Diversity,"
which asks schools to evaluate
themselves periodically based on
their own standards of diversity in
hiring, the student body and cur
ricula. Institutions must be ac
credited to be eligible for federal
financial aid and research grants.
Encouraged by University
President Gerhard Casper, the
Faculty Senate objected to the doc
ument earlier this month on the
basis that it contains discriminato

ry language and dangerously ex
tends the reach of accrediting bod
ies beyond their traditional scope.
"This is in no way intended as a
retreat from the issue of diversity.
That's not at all the point," said
Vice Provost for Institutional
Planning Geoffrey Cox, express
ing frustration at misconceptions
of Stanford's motives for rejecting
the statement.
Rather, the statement allows
WASC, a body with "no particular
standing in this area," to push far
beyond the criteria it was estab
lished to evaluate and insert itself
into areas that should be left to
member institutions themselves,
Cox said.
Nevertheless, Cox added that
the statement's passage should
have "no immediate impact" on
Stanford. "We're very proud of our
record on diversity, and I'm sure we
can pass any standards," he said.
WASC is one of six voluntary
collaborations of colleges and uni
versities nationwide who partici
pate in regulatory self-studies every
five to 10 years. The accrediting
process has traditionally been
based on factors like the caliber of
faculty, quality of buildings and the
number of books in an institution.
Beyond the issue of University
autonomy, the statement on diver
sity contains language that sanc
tions discrimination against gays
and lesbians, said English Prof.
Ron Rebholz, who originally
brought the statement to the sen
ate's attention.
"I am deeply, deeply disappoint
ed," said Rebholz. "The statement
is an invitation for religious insti
tutions to discriminate on the
basis of sexual orientation."
The statement was amended

when conservative religious
schools objected to standards that
would ask them to accept and hire
gay and lesbian students, faculty
and staff.
WASC's statement now holds
that "religious institutions have
the right to select students and
faculty on the basis of adherence
to religious beliefs." It also allows
such institutions to enact "prohi
bitions," providing they do so
without "animosity or disrespect."
"The document explicitly states
that institutions can discriminate
based on sexual orientation," said
Biology Prof. Patricia Jones, chair
of the senate. "It was specifically
rewritten to allay the fears of reli
gious schools."
The senate's Steering Commit
tee originally drafted two resolu
tions objecting both to the docu
ment's discriminatory language
and its seizure of new powers. In
the course of senate debate, howev
er, the two resolutions were com

bined to issue a stronger overall
statement. The senate also voted to
endorse Casper's statement
renouncing WASC's initiative.
The regional body has been tin
kering with its statement for three
years, battling both religious insti
tutions and gay and lesbian
groups.
The final version assures mem
ber institutions that no school will
be held to standards that contra
dict its mission statement or will
have its accreditation withheld
because of diversity issues.
Despite the statement's limited
impact on the University, Casper
said at the senate meeting that
Stanford is nonetheless looking
into other accrediting options.
"We can't just withdraw from
WASC as they hold the keys to the
federal purse strings," Cox said.
"The national accrediting situation
is changing very rapidly, though,
and we'll be watching closely to see
what options appear."
