# Montoya and students debate affirmative-action admissions
## 
### Kyle Graham Staff writer 
Has the University's affirmative-action
program "created a Stanford that is a beau
tiful place," or has it given some minority
applicants a "freebie"?
Five panelists confronted this question
in a debate over affirmative action's role in
American life and Stanford admissions be
fore a crowd of more than 50 in Tresidder
Union last night.
After an introductory statement by
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions James
Montoya, who said, "I can say very proudly
that I am a product of affirmative action,"
Stanford Review managing editor Aman
Verjee and Blake Stephenson of Students
for Self Government attacked the results of
similar national and University programs.
Verjee said that Stanford's affirmative
action policy in effect has given some mi

nority students a "freebie" with regard to
admissions and has created a hierarchy
among blacks based on economic class.
"What we're telling blacks, essentially, is
that you cannot fail," he said.
Stephenson, president and founder of
Students for Self Government — a new or
ganization attempting to "question
whether government can solve the prob
lems we're confronting," attempted to
make a wider indictment of affirmative ac
tion, which he said "is just another narrow
minded political solution to a political prob
lem that has been caused by politics," he
said.
Mike Zwibelman of the Stanford Democ
rats and Council of Presidents member
Ron Brown strongly defended affirmative
action, citing Stanford's admissions policy
as an example of an effective program.
"I think that one of the main
purposes of affirmative action is
to increase the educational oppor
tunities for certain groups of peo
ple," said Brown. "Stanford's
affirmative action has created a
Stanford that is a beautiful
place."
Zwibelman responded to Ver
jee's earlier question of "What is
affirmative action trying to
accomplish?" by naming affirma
tive action as a force for further
integration and as ensuring on
campus diversity.
After introductory statements

by each panelist, the group par
ticipated in a question-and
answer session with the audi
ence.
Verjee's comments on Stan
ford's affirmative-action admis
sions policy was the subject of
most queries. In response to
questions regarding his lack of
data on the grade-point averages
of students admitted under affir
mative-action guidelines, Verjee
said, "I would challenge Dean
Montoya, if he really thinks that
blacks at Stanford, despite their
lower SAT (scores), are doing as
well as whites at Stanford or
Asian-Americans at Stanford,
well then if he really believes
that, then he should release the
data (on student SAT-GPA cor

relation) to everyone.
"It's a quest I'm on, I guess,
trying to get the data released,"
Verjee said.
The panel discussion was
organized by Cross Cultures, a
student group attempting to
unite various cultures and help
them share their heritage with
others.
"We decided it's something
everyone knows a little bit about
. . . and it affects everyone on
campus, not just students of
color," said senior Rob Axelrod.
"We thought of this a while
back; we wanted to do something
more serious than our usual cul
tural lactivities]," said junior
Junko Peterson, another Cross
Cultures founder.
