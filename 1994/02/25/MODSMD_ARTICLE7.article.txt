# Montoya and students debate affirmative-action admissions

### Kyle Graham Staff writer 
Has the University's affirmative-action
program "created a Stanford that is a beau
tiful place," or has it given some minority
applicants a "freebie"?
Five panelists confronted this question
in a debate over affirmative action's role in
American life and Stanford admissions be
fore a crowd of more than 50 in Tresidder
Union last night.
After an introductory statement by
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions James
Montoya, who said, "I can say very proudly
that I am a product of affirmative action,"
Stanford Review managing editor Aman
Verjee and Blake Stephenson of Students
for Self Government attacked the results of
similar national and University programs.
Verjee said that Stanford's affirmative
action policy in effect has given some mi

nority students a "freebie" with regard to
admissions and has created a hierarchy
among blacks based on economic class.
"What we're telling blacks, essentially, is
that you cannot fail," he said.
Stephenson, president and founder of
Students for Self Government â€” a new or
ganization attempting to "question
whether government can solve the prob
lems we're confronting," attempted to
make a wider indictment of affirmative ac
tion, which he said "is just another narrow
minded political solution to a political prob
lem that has been caused by politics," he
said.
Mike Zwibelman of the Stanford Democ
rats and Council of Presidents member
Ron Brown strongly defended affirmative
action, citing Stanford's admissions policy
as an example of an effective program.
