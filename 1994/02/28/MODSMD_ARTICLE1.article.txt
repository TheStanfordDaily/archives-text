# Take back the night
## March fights fears for women's safety 
### Beth Berselli Staff writer 
About 30 men and women
brought candles, emotions, stories
and song to White Plaza last night
in their effort to "Take Back the
Night" by protesting the fear that
women have of being out alone after
dark.
The annual event, which is spon
sored by the Women's Center as
part of Women's Herstory Month,
"serves as an outlet for women's
feelings about not being able to go
out alone at night and being faced
with harassment and assault," said
sophomore Rachel Katz, an orga
nizer of the event.
"It raises awareness on campus
that it's an issue," Katz said. "Item
powers men and women to both do
something they normally wouldn't
do. They're in it together, they're
not alone."
For many, the fear of being at
tacked while out alone at night af
fects their actions. "I never feel safe
running by myself at night. I have to
fmd a man to run with, and of course
he always talks about how much he
enjoys running alone at night," se
nior Christine Milano said.
"I decided to come tonight be
cause I've been on this campus for
four years, and I've always been
frustrated by the fact that I've
never felt completely safe out alone
at night," Milano said.
She added that she's tired of "al
ways doing all those things that I do
out of habit like checking my back
seat before I gets into my car."
Holding candles, the partici
pants marched from White Plaza to
the Inner Quad, where they held an
informal "speak out."
"It's a time to talk about our feel-
ings, our fears," Katz said.
Katz talked about "Issues in Self
Defense for Woman," a former
Stanford Workshop on Political and
Social Issues which could not be
offered through regular academic
channels because of a Title IX equi
ty complaint. "It makes me sad that
a lot of people don't have the chance
to take the class," she said,
although she added that classes will
be taught next quarter off-campus.
Another participant talked
about her personal experience with
rape. She was raped at a party dur
ing her third week at Stanford as a

freshman. "I try not to think about
it.. .. I pretended that it didn't
happen to me," she said.
"For me, ['Take Back the
Night'] is a lot more than just walk
ing at night, it's the knowledge that
I can be around people and not
have to worry about it happening,"
she said.
"It makes me happy that men
are here tonight," she added. "It
shouldn't be just a woman's issue."
Also in the Quad, Stanford grad
uate Carin Anderson and her
friend, Chris Weipert, sang two
numbers. The two are a profession
al singing duo called "Wise Child."
Their first song was about one of
their friends and her experience of
being raped. "Tell me sister, what
did he do to you that night... what

kind of pain did you feel that
night?" the two women sang,
bringing tears to many partici
pants' eyes.
"I am woman. I have a voice. I
am woman. I have a choice — to
take back the night, to bring forth
my light," they sang in another
number.
Katz attributed the low turnout
to the absence of self defense class
es this quarter. "That's a big group
of people who are interested in
these issues," she said.
At the reception at the Women's
Center following the march, partic
ipants signed a petition to "ask that
Stanford University explore
options necessary in order to rein
state the class 'Issues in Self
Defense for Women.' "
