Law School to replace Dickson
The Law School is preparing to begin its hunt
for a replacement for Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Sally Dickson, who will leave her post next
month to become director of the Office of Multi
cultural Education.
Dean Paul Brest said administrators will "look
at the job description, and see how it has changed"
since Dickson took the job six years ago. After tak
ing into account any new definition of the post,
Brest will announce the vacancy and solicit appli
cations.
Brest added that an appointed committee will
conduct a national search for Dickson's replace
ment.
For the remainder of the academic year, Brest
said the dean's office and other administrators
will "cover Dean Dickson's position," adding she
will still be available for assistance.
"She will spend enough time here to keep on
pitching in," he said.

Continuing the search
Almost three months after the departure of the
last sexual assault prevention coordinator, Cowell
Health Promotion and the Campus Sexual
Assault Response and Recovery Team are inter
viewing several candidates to fill the position.
The new coordinator will replace Fran Gibson,
who left Dec. 10, a few weeks after her resigna
tion. Although there had initially been discussions
of eliminating the position, the decision was made
to fill the half-time post.
According to sexual assault educator Angelina
Cheney, a candidate was selected, but the
appointee chose to accept another job offer. "We
ended up back at square one," she said.
The coordinator evaluates Stanford's sexual
assault prevention programs and advises the Uni
versity administration on how these programs can
be improved.
Health Promotion and C-SARRT are looking
for a person who is familiar with the preventive
programming at Stanford and is interested in sex

ual assault issues, according to Cheney.
She said they hope to fill the position as soon as
possible, but no deadline for selection has been
established. C-SARRT and Health Promotion will
both participate in the final decision.

Frosh faces bike theft charge
A Stanford student turned himself in to police
on Feb. 16 for alleged bicycle theft, according to
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
John Lewis, a freshman, was first confronted
by a dormmate about his numerous bicycles,
Niemeyer said.
The dormmate wanted Lewis to move his bikes
and called the police when Lewis refused, Niemey
er said. Police were able to identify the bikes as
stolen.
After Lewis did not respond to a request to
come to the station, Stanford police obtained a
warrant for his arrest, Niemeyer said.
"We don't really get a lot of [Stanford] students
that do stufT like that," Niemeyer said. "Maybe
once a year."
Lewis will be charged with possession of stolen
property and three counts of bicycle theft, he said.
Lewis declined to comment on the charges.

A robbery gone awry
A pizza delivery man narrowly avoided becom
ing the victim of a robbery at Stanford the evening
of Feb. 18.
Sergio Latorre was driving on campus at about
10:30 p.m. that night when he noticed a white Volk
swagen van with its lights off following him, accord
ing to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
At the intersection of Campus Drive and May
field, the van pulled alongside Latorre's car and
attempted to force him off the road, Niemeyer said.
One of the suspects got out of the van and
ordered Latorre to give him his money. Latorre
was able to drive away and went immediately to
the Stanford police station, Niemeyer said.
