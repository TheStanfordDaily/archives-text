Lebanon church bombed
JOUNIEH, Lebanon (AP) — A bomb explod
ed in a packed Maronite Catholic church yester
day, killing nine worshipers and wounding at
least 60 as they lined up in front of the altar to
take Communion, police and witnesses said.
The carnage at Notre Dame De Ija Delivrance
could have been far worse: A larger bomb was
found inside the church's organ and defused.
The bombing, hard on the heels of the mas
sacre ofMuslimsata mosque in the Israeli-occu
pied West Bank, underlined the threat the
region's religious animosities pose to the
Mideast peace process.
It also marked a setback for efforts to restore
law and order after the 1975-90 civil war that
made this country notorious for violence.
There was no immediate claim of responsibil
ity for the explosion in Jounieh, 12 miles north
of Beirut.
Lebanese and Syrian officials blamed Israel,
accusing it of trying to divert attention from the
mosque massacre.
There was no official comment immediately
from Jerusalem.
The blast sent the congregation of about 250
people storming hysterically out of the church.
