## Israel tries to restore order after massacre 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) â€” Israel's Cab
inet ordered some Jewish extremists
disarmed and up to 1,000 Palestinian
prisoners freed yesterday in an effort
to smother Arab fury over the Hebron
mosque massacre.
The violence did not abate. At least
three Palestinians died as clashes
between Arabs and Israeli troops
spread across the occupied lands and
the Jewish state itself, leaving the
Middle East peace process still in jeop
ardy.
PLO chairman Yasser Arafat dis
missed the Israeli government crack
down on Jewish extremists opposed to
peace talks as "hollow and superfi
cial."
"These are empty decisions which
have no relation with the seriousness
of the crime or with the basis of resolv
ing it," Arafat told The Associated
Press at his headquarters in Tunis,
Tunisia.
He charged Israeli troops were
involved in the bloodbath at the
mosque Friday, a claim Israel has
denied. The government says a lone
Jewish settler attacked the victims
with an assault rifle while they prayed.
The Arab League voted last night to

ask the U.N. Security Council to inves
tigate the massacre. Its 22 members
urged the United States and Russia to
provide protection for Palestinians in
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
Arabs also played down the Cabi
net's order for the release of Palestini
an prisoners this week. Many of the
inmates affected have served the bulk
of their sentences and had been
expected to be released next month as
part of Israeli-PLO efforts to begin
limited self-rule for Palestinians.
Despite criticisms of Israel's moves,
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said he
hoped talks with the Palestine Libera
tion Organization would resume.
"We expect that regardless of the
tragic event that took place in Hebron
on Friday, the Palestinians, the PLO,
will . . . realize that the only way to
solve the problem is to accelerate the
process, to find a solution," Rabin said
at a Jewish media conference.
In Tunis, Arafat assembled the
PLO leadership yesterday to decide
whether to respond to an invitation by
President Clinton to resume peace
talks in Washington on Wednesday.
The Israelis have said they will go.
Related Mideast peace talks in

Washington were suspended after del
egates from Syria, Lebanon and Jor
dan decided yesterday to withdraw to
show solidarity with the PLO and to
return home for consultations, U.S.
and Israeli officials said.
The Palestinians are demanding
the removal of the 120,000 Jewish set
tlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Rabin said, however, he would hold
the PLO to its agreement not to nego
tiate the future of the settlements
until 1996. "The settlements are going
to remain," Rabin said. "We will stick
to this agreement."
The army sealed off the occupied
zones, with a population of 1 million
Palestinians, for an indefinite period.
Thousands of Arabs defied curfews to
stone soldiers in rainswept streets and
throw up barricades of burning tires.
Others sneaked through alleyways
decked in black flags, dodging patrols
to visit the grieving families of the vic
tims.
The military said the operation
launched late Saturday was to prevent
Arab attacks in Israel and anti-Arab
attacks by Israelis.
Hundreds of young people also riot
ed in Jaffa, Nazareth and other Arab

towns inside Israel, setting vehicles on
fire and blocking streets.
Sixty-two Palestinians have been
killed in violence since Friday morn
ing, including 39 at the Hebron
mosque. More than 350 were reported
wounded.
Israel's environment minister,
Yossi Sarid, said the 14-member Cabi
net voted unanimously to disarm some
Jewish extremists, forcibly if neces
sary, and was studying the legal posi
tion of outlawing extremist factions.
He said it "signals a new way of deal
ing with extremist settlers."
The main target of the crackdown is
Kach, a militant movement founded
by Rabbi Meir Kahane. He was assas
sinated in New York in 1990.
The mosque massacre was blamed
on Dr. Baruch Goldstein, a U.S.-born
physician from Kiryat Arba who was a
follower of Kahane. The government
said he was overpowered and beaten to
death by worshipers.
Israeli officials named one as Kach
spokesman Noam Federman. He
brazenly telephoned Israel radio yes
terday from an unknown location and
said: "I'm not hiding. I'm touring
Israel."
