IS IT ONLY the thought that
counts? That's probably not
what the Women's Needs Assess
ment Study Group believed when it
was convened in the fall of 1989. The
group spent three years investigat
ing female students' academic per
formance, decision making, re
lationship dynamics, experiences
with sexism and how their quality of
life is supported and enhanced by
the University environment.
Of course, investigation is only
half the job. In the fall of 1992, the
group released a report with 12
major recommendations, including
the training of faculty, staff and
teaching assistants about sexism;
establishing a full-time position for
an assistant dean to serve as direc
tor of the women's center; and the
convening of a Committee on the
Status of Women to develop and
implement policies related to
women at Stanford.
Now, nearly 18 months later,
none of the recommendations has

been implemented. Budget cuts,
staff turnovers and the endless
"reorganization" that plague this
University are blamed for the inac
tion. While these may be impedi
ments, they cannot be accepted as
excuses for ignoring all the recom
mendations.
The degree to which the recom
mendations of the report have —
or in this case, have not — been
kept "front and center" in spite of
any reshuffling is an indicator of
the value the University places on
the report. Judging from the inac
tion to date, one has to wonder if
some people hope the recommen
dations will die a slow, yet quiet
death as they languish in the pre
implementation phase.
It's easy to skirt the issue, to
say, "hey, we think it's important
— we had a committee study it
didn't we?" But when it comes to
improving the environment for
women at Stanford, actions speak
louder than words.
