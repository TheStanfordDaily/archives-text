# Smart dean dealing
## 
### 
The commission on
Undergraduate Education, a
task force created to review
the standards and practice of edu
cation at Stanford, will announce
its findings next fall.
After the recommendations are
made, however, the first question
to ask is, who will put them in
place?
The University has taken a step
toward answering this question by
recently creating a new full-time
associate dean post for the School of
Humanities and Sciences. The new
senior associate dean of undergrad
uate studies will hopefully make it
his or her job to see that CUE rec
ommendations will not be eternally
buried in a report but will actually
have an impact on students.
Large bureaucracies such as
Stanford's are well-known for
organizing committees whose find
ings fall by the wayside. Often
reports either go unnoticed or are

deemed obsolete by the time they
are released.
CUE's report is too important
for this to happen. The new dean
post can be an excellent connection
between the review process and the
actual application of CUE findings.
It would probably be a good idea
for the new dean, who will be
named by the end of this quarter,
to sit in on CUE meetings and
become familiar with the process.
The University's dean dealing
has also designated Prof. Russell
Berman as a full-time dean to
manage overseas studies. Having a
full-time dean will hopefully
improve the organization and man
agement of overseas studies.
Stanford has shown a strong
commitment to seeing the CUE
project through by shuffling asso
ciate dean positions in Humanities
and Sciences to make room for the
new dean.
Let's hope the shuffling pays off.
