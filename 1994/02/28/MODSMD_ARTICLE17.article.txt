## Loss of Palumbo-Liu reflects badly on the University 
### 
IFIND IT unbelievable that The
Daily attended a press conference on
"The Current State of Asian Ameri
can Studies at Stanford" and managed
to come up with the headline "Palumbo-
Liu departing to Harvard."
The focus of the conference was the
administration's hostility to Asian
American Studies at Stanford, not the
specific career moves of Assistant Pro
fessor David Palumbo-Liu. Palumbo-Liu
himself made it very clear that he want
ed to speak not about his personal case,
but about the implications of his treat
ment by the University and the admin
istration's lack of support for Asian
American Studies.
Losing either Palumbo-Liu or Gor
don Chang would be more than simply
losing a top scholar in the field of Asian
American Studies. Losing either of them
would be a signal to the academic com
munity as well as the community at

large that Stanford does not support
Asian American Studies, that this Uni
versity is a hostile place for scholars in
this field.
For Dean John Shoven [of Humani
ties and Sciences] to say that losing
either Palumbo-Liu or Chang "would
seriously impair the program" (Daily,
Feb. 8) or that "David's a real strong
asset to Stanford and particularly Asian
American Studies" (Daily, Feb. 25) is a
serious understatement.
If Stanford does not take active and
immediate steps to retain these faculty
members, Stanford will expose itself as
an unwelcome place for scholars of
Asian American Studies, and it will be
extremely difficult for Stanford to
attract any other scholar in the field. It
is time for Stanford to stop paying lip
service to its commitment to diversity in
education and to act.
Moreover, the issue of Asian Amer

ican Studies is not simply a matter of
diversity in education. As a graduate
student in modern thought and litera
ture studying Asian American litera
ture and cultural studies, I write to
remind the Stanford community that,
as the many positions at top universi
ties that are opening up in this field
indicate, Asian American Studies is
emerging as a field of intense intellec
tual activity. With its intellectual
resources, its vibrant student popula
tions, and its strategic location, Stan
ford has the potential to be on the
cutting edge of Asian American Stud
ies.
As it stands, however, the adminis
tration seems bent on completely dis
mantling the program that it purports
to support. I am a first-year graduate
student here. I chose Stanford over
other top universities in California and
the United States because I saw Stan-

ford's potential.
With its support (now dwindling I
see) for interdisciplinary work, Stanford
allows the flexibility that fields like
Asian American Studies demand. I
chose to attend this institution because
the combination of the support for work
outside of traditional departments and
an infant Asian American studies pro
gram promised to create an exciting
place to pursue my work. The mistreat
ment of Chang and Palumbo-Liu
demonstrates that Stanford is intent on
destroying this promise.
Stanford prides itself on being one of
the top universities in the United States
and the world. This reputation cannot
simply be protected — it must be
earned. Stanford must move now to
support Asian American Studies.
