# CUE does not validate "over-representation of Asian Americans" myth
## 
### 
I'd like to add one important point I
made at Thursday's Asian American
Studies press conference which was
omitted from Friday's article. It is ironic
that a professor here would remark on
the "over-representation" of Asians at
Stanford.
If this is indeed true, it sets up an
interesting case in politics for there is
not even a single Asian "representative"
on the University's commission which is
charged with reevaluating the under
graduate curriculum here â€” a crucial
job. Doesn't this give us a textbook case
of the difference between demographic
and political representation?
