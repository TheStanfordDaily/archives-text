# Housing progress
## Administrators, EV council work toward improving communication, understanding 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Only a month after a heated meeting be
tween the Escondido Village family council
and administrators in which residents
made their views known on a myriad of top
ics from bicycle theft to playground safety,
both groups agree that significant progress
has been made.
"We've written a letter to all EV stu
dents to catch people up on a number of
projects," said Rodger Whitney, associate
director of student housing and dining ser
vices. "It clarified questions raised at the
meeting."
Many of the issues raised at the January
meeting were related to communication, a
fact which has prompted administrators to
take steps to find out exactly what residents
want.
In addition, residents voiced concerns
about such issues as asbestos found in
apartments, the desirability of unfurnished

residences and problems with stolen bicy
cles.
According to Graduate School of Busi
ness student Mary Lea McAnally, one of the
council's founders, additional meetings
have been held with the University.
"They're working very closely with
us," said Facilities Manager Glenn Car
roll, adding that the administration had
not seen many of the issues raised before
the council brought them to their atten
tion.
Whitney said plans are also underway to
go directly to the residents. "We're going to
try to call some neighborhood meetings to
get feedback from the entire village over the
next month and a half," he said.
In addition to improving communication
between residents and administrators,
progress has been made in addressing spe
cific complaints.
"There's a committee that is coming up
with a plan for bicycle safety,"
Whitney said. "The residents'
messages have been heard."
The Graduate Housing Action
Committee has begun to look at
the issue of furnishings.
Other proposals brought out at
the meeting, such as playground
improvements, have also

received attention from adminis
trators — in the form of
answered questions and action to
form committees and develop
solutions.
"I'm really impressed by how
quickly they responded,"
McAnally said, adding that in the
past the University tended to
ignore residents' concerns.
As one explanation for the
sudden shift in responsiveness,
she pointed to the council's
increased prominence — both in
bringing issues to the University

and ensuring that they receive
adequate consideration.
"We've managed to institute a
number of policies that make the
council entrenched," McAnally
said. "We've built some strong
communication links with the
administration. . . . They're real
ly taking us seriously."
In addition, the council
received funding from the ASSU
program board for the first time
this quarter — endowing it with
the resources necessary to
inform residents, she said.
