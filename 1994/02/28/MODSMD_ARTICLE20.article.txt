## Weather makes or breaks 
### 
IT'S TIME to give weather some cred
it. The weather across the country
lately has been rather tempestuous
to say the least. Snow and cold have
dominated the East Coast this winter,
the mighty Mississippi made levees look
like cheap condoms over the summer and
mud slides were the drink of choice in
Southern California last spring.
Weather dominates every aspect of
our lives and we take it for granted. It
dictates how we dress. It's the major fac
tor in whether or not we can participate
in activities outdoors, let alone go out
side. And when we're leaning up against
the wall with beer in hand at Party X
with nothing to say to him/her, what is
the first thing we talk about? I'll give you
a hint — it's not the likelihood of U.S. air
strikes on Sarajevo.
My grandparents talk about the
weather constantly. I think the reason
they regard it so highly is because
they've experienced its fury first-hand.
They've been through sleet, hail, sub
zero temperatures and 90 percent
humidity. They haven't seen a tornado,
but they can talk hurricanes. And I
think they can die peacefully having
experienced many a New England
autumn.
Weather forced my dad's parents to
move to Arizona. They still call some
times in the winter just to say, "It's 85
degrees here — now when are you com
ing to visit us?"
It's not really a rite of passage for the

age-challenged to migrate south when
they get older. It's a necessity. My other
grandmother is still in New York,
though. When I talk to her she always
asks me if I miss the cold and if I'm com
ing home soon.
Why am I making such a big deal
about weather on the East Coast? I feel
weather is the most important non
familial factor in a child's development.
I've seen kids grow up in suburban New
York and in suburban San Francisco.
My hypothesis is that kids who grow
up here aren't as imaginative as kids
who grow up where the climate chal
lenges them. Now don't get me wrong —
I don't think all Californian kids are
unproductive masses of flesh. However,
if you lock them out of the house on a
rainy day, I doubt "kill the carrier"
would be one of the first games on their
playlist.
I arrived at this conclusion after
observing children growing up in both
areas. The East Coast subject: my
15-year-old brother. The West Coast
subjects: 11 kids, ages 12 to 14, on a
Menlo Park little league team I coached
two years ago. I observed how the sub
jects functioned under various weather
conditions.
The results were conclusive. My
brother would play basketball or wiffle
ball regardless of the summer time con
ditions in New York. The West Coast
subjects, on the other hand, were more
lackadaisical, temperamental and less

willing to want to be outside on bad days.
I'm still convinced that's why the team
came in second place.
I admit, my theory has some flaws.
But since Californians don't have to
worry about the weather, they don't
worry about life as much. Angelinos
would be as angry as New Yorkers if it
just rained more than once a decade —
and I don't mean raining bullets, flames
or freeways. That stuff makes you crazy.
I guess San Franciscans have to deal
with fog, but if it rains around here, peo
ple can't get to Tahoe fast enough. And
San Diegans are like, just hopelessly
happy, dude.
All of this weather stuff comes down
to one thing — shoveling snow. If you've
shoveled snow before you know what an
arduous chore it is. If you haven't, then
you've missed out on the greatest char
acter-building exercise this side of fra
ternity initiation. There's nothing like
the aching buck, the callused hands and
the cardiac arrest associated with the
new demonstration sport at the 1998
Olympics.
There's two feet of snow outside my
house in New York. Where's my shovel?
