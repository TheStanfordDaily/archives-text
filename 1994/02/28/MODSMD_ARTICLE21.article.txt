# Panelists look at causes of immigration

Instead of blaming migrant workers for
America's problems, panelists at a symposium
Friday emphasized the need to study the
underlying causes of immigration.
More than 40 students attended the one
day symposium in History Corner on Mexican
immigration and human rights. The audience
watched a half-hour documentary about
human-rights abuses along the San Diego-
Tijuana border titled "Sin Fronteras," or
"Without Borders." Afterward, two panels
convened to discuss the ways migrant workers
are treated in local and global politics.
"What we're trying to define are the rights
of people to live — and work — in peace," said
Cathi Tactaquin, director of the National Net
work for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. "We
are learning that immigrant restriction does
not work ... we have to examine the causes of
the immigration."
Tactaquin supports a United Nations
covenant which would give the same basic
rights to workers all over the world. She said
the U.S. government should be encouraged to
sign the charter. So far, only Morocco and
Mexico have stepped forward to endorse this
policy.
Roberto Martinez, director of the U.S.-

Mexico Border Program, agreed with Tac
taquin's assessment of the drawbacks of cur
rent immigration laws. He added that there
have been many instances of border patrols
using unnecessary violence along the San
Diego-Tijuana border. Though a few human
rights cases have made their way to court,
Martinez said criminal justice often discrimi
nates against immigrants.
"We've seen an increase in hate crimes, an
increase in hostility and racism in schools,"
Martinez said. "It's no longer just about
undocumented people."
Political Science Prof. Luis Fraga discussed
the fundamental causes behind the recent
wave of "immigrant bashing." Scapegoating,
he maintains, is "part of a general strategy . . .
to enhance the electability of political candi
dates." He pointed to Gov. Pete Wilson's
declining popularity ratings as an impetus for
the state's recently hardened stance against
illegal immigrants. By stirring up public opin
ion against an outside group, more pertinent
concerns were allowed to fall by the wayside,
Fraga said.
A common theme throughout the work
shop was the need for a closer link between
scholars and activism. Carrie Tirado Bramen,
a graduate student who helped organize and
sponsor the event, emphasized this as the

main reason for setting up the program.
"In the media, immigration is becoming
more and more of an issue, and Mexican
Americans are increasingly scapegoated," she
said. She added that the panels were a forum
in which students and activists could share
their insights and reach some form of consen
sus.

This hope was perhaps voiced most effec
tively by Teresa Gutierrez, the Bay Area orga
nizer for the immigrant-rights group, "Cam
paign for Justice." After sharing her own
story of being repeatedly fired for attempting
to organize her fellow workers, Gutierrez put
in a personal plea to the crowd.
"I'm talking from my heart to you," the
mother of four said to the audience. "If you
can do something for our people, do it."
