### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
An accidental fire was quickly
put out by residents of Alpha
Sigma early Sunday morning.
House Manager Mike Chris
tian heard smoke detectors sec
ond-floor start to blare around 2
a.m. He was standing in the
courtyard when he looked up to
his room and saw "flames going
all the way up to the ceiling," he
said.
A cardboard box containing
cans and cups that was sitting in
the hallway outside of Chris
tian's room had ignited, accord
ing to Palo Alto Fire Department
Capt. Lee Leonard.
Senior Tag Griffith said he
attempted to use the fire extin
guisher closest to the fire to
control the flames, but to no
avail.

Residents then began taking
buckets of water from the bath
room to dump on the fire, Chris
tian said. All this did was cause
the fire to spread, he said.
Christian then found the fire
extinguisher on the opposite side
of the house and was able to con
trol the blaze before the fire
department arrived.
Police were already at the
house due to noise complaints
about a party that the house was
holding.
All house residents were evac
uated and no injuries were
reported, Leonard said.
According to Leonard, the
cause of the fire is unknown, but
he speculated that someone may
have accidentally dropped a
cigarette into the box. The fire
caused no property damage,
except for residue from the extin
guisher, he said.
