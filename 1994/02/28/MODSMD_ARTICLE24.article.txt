## Sweet revenge for women Cardinal hoosters secure 94-82 win over UCLA 
### Joe Bialowitz Staff writer 
Handbills posted around the Stanford campus
last week advertised the upcoming women's basket
ball team's home games with one word: "Revenge!"
With the results now in, it is safe to say the Car
dinal lived up to its advanced billing. On the heels of
a 30-point trouncing of Pacific 10 Conference leader
USC two nights before, No. 11 Stanford (18-5 over
all, 11-3 Pac-10) completed its mission to avenge its
previous losses to the two Southern California
schools with a 94-82 victory over UCLA (15-8, 10-5)
before a near capacity crowd at Maples Pavilion Sat
urday night.
The decision extended Stanford's winning streak
to seven games and enabled the Cardinal to remain
one game behind the front-running Trojans in the
loss column, after USC won its contest in Berkeley
Saturday night.
Throughout the Cardinal streak, individual Stan
ford players have elevated the levels of their games
in order to lead the team to victory. Two weeks ago,
it was Christy Hedgpeth, last week it was Anita
Kaplan and last Saturday night it was freshman
Kate Starbird who shined.
The forward came off the bench to score a career
high 24 points in just 19 minutes of play, an effort
her coach felt was much-needed.
"When you come out and beat a team like USC by
30, what is going to top that?" said head coach Tara
VanDerveer. "If you have any hopes of playing in the
tournament, you have got to come back ready to play
in the next game. . . . That is why it is important to
have people like Kate Starbird coming off the
bench."
For a while, it didn't look like Starbird's heroics
would be needed. After staying within five points of
the Cardinal for much of the first half, Bruin hopes
took a serious turn for the worse. With just over five
minutes remaining in the first half, star forward
Natalie Williams badly injured her right knee after
slipping while driving to the basket. Williams, the
Pac-10 leader in points per game (24.3) and
rebounds per game (13.6), was forced to leave the
game and did not return.
"When Williams goes down, that's a good 30
points and 15 to 20 rebounds that we're losing," said
UCLA head coach Kathy Olivier.
The Cardinal promptly took advantage of
Williams' absence from the paint, pounding the ball
inside to Kaplan and utilizing Starbird's ability to
drive to the hoop. The result was a 12-2 run that put

Stanford up by a score of 47-26, its biggest lead of
the game.
Yet UCLA refused to concede the game easily.
"After Williams went down, the players literally
grabbed me and said, 'keep believing'," Olivier said.
Thanks to the performances of Detra Lockhart
(26 points) and Amy Jalewalia (23 points), the Bru
ins were able to chip away at a 15-point Cardinal
halftime advantage. When Lockhart drained a 17-
footer with 12:36 to go in the game, the lead was cut
to eight and VanDerveer was forced to call a timeout.
Two minutes later, however, Starbird began to
nail the Bruin coffin shut. After dishing off in traffic
for an easy Rachel Hemmer layup to make the score
75-59, Starbird got back on defense and sent the
