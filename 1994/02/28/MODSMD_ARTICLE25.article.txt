# Freshman Starbird's block sparks victory
## 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
Few things in basketball are as thrilling and
completely empowering as a good block. A
humiliating block that makes the crowd go
wild. The kind that makes a freshman look like
a veteran.
Kate Starbird's block against Ricarda
Kuypers in Saturday night's 94-82 victory
against UCLA resembled a clip from CNN
Sports' "Play of the Day." Not only did it
define the concept of a blocked shot, but it was
exemplary of Starbird's total game that night.
In the middle of the second half, Kuypers
stood all alone under the hoop on a fast break,
ready to score an easy two. Her points were
taken away as Starbird streaked over and sent
the ball out of bounds with a massive swipe. It
brought the crowd to its feet.
"I haven't seen a standing ovation for a
player like that at Stanford ever," said head
coach Tara VanDerveer.
Starbird humbly acknowledged the block
not as a personal achievement, but
rather as a spark for the team. "It
brought a lot of excitement into the
game," Starbird said. "The ovation
brought everybody's energy up."
Although Stanford held a com
fortable lead at this point, the
heightened intensity carried the
team through to secure the victory,
according to VanDerveer.
With a career-high 24 points,
Starbird lit up the Cardinal effort
in all dimensions. She found her
touch at every range, whether it
was from baseline, three-point
land, or in the driving layups at
which she excels.

"If we could've stopped their lit
tle freshman, we'd be okay," said
Bruin coach Kathy Olivier of Star
bird. "She gets into a flow and she's
hard to stop. She was in her comfort
zone, that's for sure."
What's comfortable for Starbird
is the fast transition game, when
she attacks with her characteristic
drives to the hoop. She began the
game by scoring on four layups in
only 11 minutes, along with a three
pointer and an inside shot.
More impressive, however, was
her accuracy. Achieving her first
thirteen points, Starbird was
seven-for-eight from the field. By
the end of the night, she was 11-for
-13.
Li the second half, Starbird con
tributed another 11 points with out
side shots from the right and left

corners. She also fed the inside
shooters on several assists to help
maintain the lead.
"She just does things you can't
teach," VanDerveer said. "She has
vision, the moves, and timing. She's
a real exciting player to coach, and
to think she's only a freshman is
even more exciting."
In her first year, Starbird has
already secured herself in Stanford
history: she is second in the Pacific
10 Conference in free throw shoot
ing, and she has been the top scorer
five times this season.
In Stanford's final games before
the NCAA playoffs, however, Star
bird knows that being a freshman is
not something that needs to be
emphasized. At this point in the sea
son, "we're not allowed to play like
freshmen anymore."
