# Freshman Starbird's block sparks victory

Few things in basketball are as thrilling and
completely empowering as a good block. A
humiliating block that makes the crowd go
wild. The kind that makes a freshman look like
a veteran.
Kate Starbird's block against Ricarda
Kuypers in Saturday night's 94-82 victory
against UCLA resembled a clip from CNN
Sports' "Play of the Day." Not only did it
define the concept of a blocked shot, but it was
exemplary of Starbird's total game that night.
In the middle of the second half, Kuypers
stood all alone under the hoop on a fast break,
ready to score an easy two. Her points were
taken away as Starbird streaked over and sent
the ball out of bounds with a massive swipe. It
brought the crowd to its feet.
"I haven't seen a standing ovation for a
player like that at Stanford ever," said head
coach Tara VanDerveer.
