# Swimmers capture Pac-10s
## Stanford boosted by strong relay efforts, will send 16 to NCAAs 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
It is perhaps the biggest misnomer in
women's swimming. They call it the Pacific 10
Conference Championships, but considering
Stanford is the only squad ever to have won the
title in the event's eight-year history, it could
easily be renamed the "Cardinal Classic."
Stanford won the tournament this year by
beating its closest competitors, the USC Tro
jans, by over 200 points.
"We had a very solid meet," said junior Becky
Crowe. "Not every individual was completely
satisfied, but the team really pulled together."
Numerous Stanford individuals had great

showings at the three-day meet, held in Long
Beach. A total of 14 individuals have now quali
fied for the NCAA tournament next month,
most of those competitors nabbing their times
at the Pac-10 tournament. In addition, two Car
dinal swimmers who fell just short of their auto
matic qualifying times will also be sent to Indi
anapolis for the NCAA show.
"A lot of people dropped a lot of time going
into this meet," Julie Kole said. "We are doing
great gearing up for NCAAs."
Assistant coach Ross Geary said the team did
very well in the meet despite the pressure of
preparing for NCAAs.
"There is absolutely no question that we put
out a great effort," he said.

Through the first 11 events, the Cardinal
women pulled off nine first-place finishes and
set four Pac-10 records in the process. The 200-
yard freestyle relay team of Mary Edwards, Jes
sica Tong, Kerry O'Hanlon and Jenny Thomp
son knocked nearly a full second off the Pac-10
meet mark with their time of 1:31.58.
"The relays were just phenomenal," Crowe
said. "The tone set by this Pac-10 meet was that
we are a team that can win the national cham
pionship. That should really intimidate Florida
and Texas."
The intimidation continued on the second
day of the tournament. Jenny Thompson broke
her own Pac-10 meet record in the
50 free with a time of 22.50 in the
trials for her event. In addition,
senior Lea Loveless broke a Pac-10
meet record she set herself in the
100 backstroke with a time 0f53.00.
"The majority of our team quali
fied for NCAAs," Crowe said, refer
ring to the 16 Stanford swimmers
who can already plan the trip to
Indiana.
The Cardinal brought yet anoth
er record down Friday night, when
Michelle Jesperson, Tong, Jane
Skillman and Lisa Jacob sliced
more than a second off of the Pac
-10 meet record in the 800 free relay.
Stanford won five of five events
and all relays in the first night of
competition.
Other winners for the Cardinal

included the team of Loveless, Mary
Ellen Blanchard, Thompson and
Jacob in the 400 medley relay. Stan
ford captured victories in all relay
events.
"We had some incredible show
ings from some of the relays,"
Geary said. "It showed the charac
ter of our team. They were easy for
us to win, but our team wasn't sat
isfied with just winning."
The Diving team placed Britt
Mattern third, Stefanie Forrest
fifth and Megan Gardner seventh
on the three-meter board, while in
the one-meter even Mattern took
fifth, Gardner sixth and Forrest
seventh.
The team can take up to 17 mem
bers to the NCAA tournament, so
the final spot should be filled at the
trials event next weekend. Only
those swimmers who had not
already qualified for NCAAs before
the Pac-10 tournament chose to
taper and shave; the others will wait
until the national championships.
