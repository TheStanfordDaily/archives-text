The No. 6-ranked Stanford men's gymnas
tics team proved it is the two-time defending
national champion for a reason.
Not only did the Cardinal defeat No. 7 Michi
gan and No. 9 UCLA as well as UC-Berkeley on
Friday, it emphasized its superiority the next
day by beating the two top-10 teams again at
home to remain undefeated.
"I'm so comfortable with the way we're per
forming right now," said coach Sadao Hamada.
"We got some of our highest scores for the year
this weekend, and we also improved a lot."
These record highs were essential for the
Cardinal to emerge victorious. Friday it took the

Cardinal a season-high 48.65 out of 50 on floor
exercise to earn a 282.30-point win. Michigan
posted a normally uncontested score of 281.15
out of 300, while California, to Stanford's sur
prise, put on a 280.15-point performance.
At home the next day, Stanford found itself
with only a 187.85 to 187.45 lead over the maize
and blue after four rotations. Then, in its two
remaining events of the day — the parallel bars
and high bars — the Cardinal exploded with
47.60 and 48.25-point tallies respectively to pull
off a 283.7 to 279.65 victory. The scores on par
allel bars and high bar, along with the final dual
meet score, were Stanford season highs.
"Physically, it was the toughest weekend
we've had," Hamada said. "First, it's because it
was back-to-back. Second, we competed against

two of the toughest teams in the nation."
In addition to rigorous competition, the Car
dinal had to deal with injury as well.
Freshman lan Bachrach suffered a bruised
heel during his vault Friday. As the event was
Stanford's first of the meet, he was sidelined for
the remainder of the contest.
"lan's injury gave us weaker line-ups,"
Hamada said. "I was cautious with 1an.... I
want him to stay healthy. He should be back
next week when we go against archrival Nebras
ka."
Fortunately for the Cardinal, many of its
other stars shined, including senior tri-captain
Mark Booth, junior tri-captain Josh Stein and
