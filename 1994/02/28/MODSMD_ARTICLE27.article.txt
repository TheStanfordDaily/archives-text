# Undefeated men gymnasts down top-10 rivals

The No. 6-ranked Stanford men's gymnas
tics team proved it is the two-time defending
national champion for a reason.
Not only did the Cardinal defeat No. 7 Michi
gan and No. 9 UCLA as well as UC-Berkeley on
Friday, it emphasized its superiority the next
day by beating the two top-10 teams again at
home to remain undefeated.
"I'm so comfortable with the way we're per
forming right now," said coach Sadao Hamada.
"We got some of our highest scores for the year
this weekend, and we also improved a lot."
These record highs were essential for the
Cardinal to emerge victorious. Friday it took the

Cardinal a season-high 48.65 out of 50 on floor
exercise to earn a 282.30-point win. Michigan
posted a normally uncontested score of 281.15
out of 300, while California, to Stanford's sur
prise, put on a 280.15-point performance.
At home the next day, Stanford found itself
with only a 187.85 to 187.45 lead over the maize
and blue after four rotations. Then, in its two
remaining events of the day — the parallel bars
and high bars — the Cardinal exploded with
47.60 and 48.25-point tallies respectively to pull
off a 283.7 to 279.65 victory. The scores on par
allel bars and high bar, along with the final dual
meet score, were Stanford season highs.
"Physically, it was the toughest weekend
we've had," Hamada said. "First, it's because it
was back-to-back. Second, we competed against

two of the toughest teams in the nation."
In addition to rigorous competition, the Car
dinal had to deal with injury as well.
Freshman lan Bachrach suffered a bruised
heel during his vault Friday. As the event was
Stanford's first of the meet, he was sidelined for
the remainder of the contest.
"lan's injury gave us weaker line-ups,"
Hamada said. "I was cautious with 1an.... I
want him to stay healthy. He should be back
next week when we go against archrival Nebras
ka."
Fortunately for the Cardinal, many of its
other stars shined, including senior tri-captain
Mark Booth, junior tri-captain Josh Stein and
junior Jing-Wei Liang. Stein led
the Cardinal's best season outing
on parallel bars during Saturday's
meet with a 9.70.
Also on Saturday, Booth
earned marks of 9.80 and 9.75 on
the high bar and pommel horse
respectively. Meanwhile, Liang
made solid contributions in all
events, highlighted by a 57.1 out
of 60 all-around score at home.
But it was freshman standout
Keith Wiley who delivered on a
promise Hamada had made for
the weekend — NCAA champi
onship-caliber scores of 9.90 to
10.0.
On Friday, Wiley achieved Stan

ford's year-best floor rotation with
a 9.90. The freshman repeated this
feat Saturday, this time on the high
bar, where he also posted a 9.90.
"I'm pretty happy with the way
my routines turned out," Wiley
said. "The 9.90s are the result of
all we've been concentrating on
the last couple of weeks, and
that's refining our execution,
form and really trying to separate
ourselves from other teams in
that regard."
Hamada also said he was happy
with the team's progress this
weekend.
"We improved on the vault
even without lan, and the our
[routine] hit ratio is higher," he
said. "Originally, our goal for the
weekend was to score 285 or
more. That is definitely possible
— we just need lan."
