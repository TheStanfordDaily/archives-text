While the O'Bannon boys were
impressive, it was free-throw
shooting that spelled the demise
of the Cardinal men's basketball
team in its 103-88 loss to No. 15
UCIiA Saturday at Pauley Pavil
ion.
Although Bruin brothers Ed
and Charles O'Bannon combined
for 43 points and 24 rebounds,
Stanford shot itself in the foot by
hitting only 25 of 46 foul shots in
losing by 15 points.
"You're not going to win on
the road if you give up 21 scoring
opportunities at the free-throw
line," said Cardinal coach Mike
Montgomery. "We did not play
badly. We got the ball in the right
offensive areas, but got nothing
in return."
Stanford (14-9 overall, 7-7 in
the Pacific 10 Conference), 13-
point underdogs entering the
game, hung close to division-lead
ing UCLA (19-4, 12-3) in the first
half, entering the intermission
down only 43-40.
Less than four minutes into
the second period, the Cardinal
tied the score at 49 on a Jim Mor
gan drive.
But the Bruins, second in the
Pac-10 in scoring with an average

of over 86 points per game, fol
lowed Morgan's basket with a 15-
6 run, led by four buckets from
the O'Bannons. When the Bru
ins' Shon Tarver hit a three
pointer at the 11:38 mark, the
score stood at 64-55 UCLA.
Stanford, which fought back
from an 11-point deficit against
USC on Thursday, was unable to
close the mark this time.
Cardinal guard Brevin Knight,
who sat out the last seven min
utes of the first period with three
fouls, was called for his fourth
and fifth fouls within a 50-second
span. He picked up his disqualifi
cation with 10:55 remaining and
Stanford down 70-59.
With Knight gone and UCI.A
running a full-court press
defense, the Cardinal couldn't cut
the gap to less than nine points.
"We played with aggressive
ness and got our running back a
little bit," said Bruins' coach Jim
Harrick, after recorded its
seventh straight win over the
Cardinal. "Stanford, I thought,
shot the ball well in the first half,
but not in the second."
From the field, the Cardinal
shot the ball well the entire game
— its 48-percent mark from the
field was its highest in almost
three months.
But Stanford's performance at
the line was a different story — the
Cardinal recorded 13 free-throw
misses in the second half alone.
With the score 80-69 Bruins and
seven minutes remaining on the
clock, Stanford whiffed on five con

secutive foul shots. By the time
David Harbour hit the back end of a
two-shot foul with less than five
minutes remaining, UCI.A had
taken an 85-69 lead.
Ed O'Bannon finished with 28
points and a career-high 19
rebounds, while younger brother
Charles threw in 15 points, five
boards, and three blocked shots.
"When Ed O'Bannon plays bas
ketball like he can play basketball,
we're a different team," Harrick

said. "And Charles O'Bannon took
a Lot of pride in his defcaau today."
Dion Cross led the Cardinal in
scoring for the fifth consecutive
game, this time with 19 points.
Knight finished with 13 points in
only 24 minutes of playing time,
and Andy Poppink hit for 14 points.
Stanford dropped into a tie with
Washington State for fifth place in
the Pac-10, while UCLA remained
tied for first place in the conference
with Arizona.
