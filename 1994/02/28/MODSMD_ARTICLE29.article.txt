# Baseball takes two from Arizona St.
## 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
The No. 12 Cardinal baseball squad served notice to
the rest of the Pacific 10 Southern Division that it is a
team to be reckoned with this weekend as it took two
of three from defending Six-Pac champion Arizona
State, 4-5, 11-1 and 4-1.
With the series victory over the No. 11 Sun Devils,
Stanford's record improved to 12-7 (2-1 in conference
play) and the Cardinal took an early lead in the 1994
Six-Pac standings.
Stanford's youthful pitching staff set the tone for
the series by limiting a powerful Sun Devil lineup that
came in batting .341 to scoring only seven runs in
three games at Sunken Diamond.
"You don't hold Arizona State to two runs in 18
innings everyday — they're just too good an offensive
team," said Cardinal coach Mark Marquess after Stan
ford's doubleheader sweep on Sunday. "The story of
this day was the pitching. Our pitching was outstand

ing.
In Friday's game, sophomore lefthander Dan Reed
and freshman righthander Tom Reimers helped estab
lish a Cardinal season-high as they struck out 17 ASU
batters, with Reed accounting for a career high 11 in 7
1/3 innings of work.
Offensively, the Cardinal jumped on the scoreboard
early, scoring a run in the first and two in the second
to hold a 3-1 lead. However, the Sun Devils battled
back and the score was deadlocked at four each going

into extra innings.
ASU struck again in the top of the 14th inning, as
back-to-back doubles by left fielder Billy McGonigle
and catcher Jake Steinkemper off of Reimers (1-2)
gave the Sun Devils a 5-4 lead which closer Noah
Peery (3-0) would make stand up.
In the first game of the doubleheader, the red-hot
Cardinal offense scored early and often, smashing out
17 hits in a 11-1 victory, while freshman righthander
Jason Middlebrook (3-0) used his 93-mph fastball to
limit the Sun Devils to seven hits over seven innings.
"I think IMiddlebrook'sl getting a lot better," Mar
quess said. "He's a lot more comfortable out there,
and they didn't get many hits off him. He gave us
seven good innings and it was a great effort."
The Stanford batters chased Sun Devil starter Jason
Verdugo (1-2) after only two innings, scoring a run in
the first, two in the second, one in the third, and five in
the fifth to put the game away. Cardinal third baseman
Brian Dallimore said he believes that opposite field hit
ting was the key to the Ciirdinal's offensive success.
"A lot of guys have been getting up to the plate
with the frame of mind of pull-pull-pull and not allow
ing themselves any mistakes," he said. "Lately in
practice we've been working on [hitting the ball morel
up the middle and the other way, allowing us to stay
over the ball and hit the ball hard."
Stanford's pitching staff continued to dominate the
Sun Devil hitters in the second game of the double-

took two of three from ASU in the series.
header. Junior lefthander Mike
Robbins (2-1) pitched seven
innings and scattered nine hits
and allowed only one run.
"[Robbins] did a good job of
getting all of his pitches over the
plate," said junior first baseman
Dusty Allen. "He kept them off
balance, and he wasn't allowing
them to sit on one pitch."
The Cardinal offense came
up with two runs in the first,
one run in the second and one
run in the fifth, and junior
righthander Matt Marenghi
spelled Robbins by pitching two
shutout innings to nail down a
4-1 victory.

Also key to Robbins' success
was an outstanding defensive
performance by the Stanford
infield, turning two difficult
double plays and snuffing out
ASU rallies.
"I feel that we have solid
players at all infield positions,"
Allen said. "Double plays are
going to be a big part of our
repertoire."
Sun Devil lefthander Jason
Ruskey (1-1) took the loss
despite pitching a complete
game and allowing four runs on
seven hits.
"They're a good hitting club.
They made contact today — it
seemed like wherever I put the
ball, they hit it," Ruskey said.
"They didn't back down one bit
— they kept on hitting the ball
and hitting it solid."
