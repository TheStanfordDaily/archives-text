A public forum titled "Women and the
War in Bosnia" brought 250 spectators to
the Palo Alto City Chambers yesterday to
hear speakers discuss violence against
women in Bosnian rape camps and to view a
documentary preview which brought tears

Moderator Ira Ruskin of the Peninsula
Democratic Coalition began the program by
recounting the "unthinkable crimes" that
had been committed against women in the
former Yugoslavia.
"It is the women â€” the grandmothers,

the mothers, the wives, the sisters and
daughters of Croatia and especially in
Bosnia that have been singled out and sub
jected to the most heinous treatment," he
said. "It is their bodies that have been made
the battlefield of this genocidal war."
Key speakers at the event included Mo
hammed Sacirbey, Bosnia-Herzogovina's
ambassador to the United Nations, Mandy
Jacobson, a filmmaker from New York who
previewed her documentary "War Crimes
Against Women," and Leslie Watson-Davis,
chair of the Committee on Women's Human
