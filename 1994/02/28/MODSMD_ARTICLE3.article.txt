# 'Unthinkable crimes'
## Speakers discuss violence against Bosnian women 
### Holly Lloyd 
A public forum titled "Women and the
War in Bosnia" brought 250 spectators to
the Palo Alto City Chambers yesterday to
hear speakers discuss violence against
women in Bosnian rape camps and to view a
documentary preview which brought tears
to some eyes.
Moderator Ira Ruskin of the Peninsula
Democratic Coalition began the program by
recounting the "unthinkable crimes" that
had been committed against women in the
former Yugoslavia.
"It is the women — the grandmothers,

the mothers, the wives, the sisters and
daughters of Croatia and especially in
Bosnia that have been singled out and sub
jected to the most heinous treatment," he
said. "It is their bodies that have been made
the battlefield of this genocidal war."
Key speakers at the event included Mo
hammed Sacirbey, Bosnia-Herzogovina's
ambassador to the United Nations, Mandy
Jacobson, a filmmaker from New York who
previewed her documentary "War Crimes
Against Women," and Leslie Watson-Davis,
chair of the Committee on Women's Human
Rights at Amnesty International
U.S.A. The event was sponsored
by more than 20 groups includ
ing Students Against Genocide, a
group based at Stanford.
The four-hour presentation
included three trans-Atlantic
calls — the first to Pulitzer Prize
winning journalist Roy Gutman
who informed the group of the
findings of the Bosnian commis
sion investigating war crimes.
According to Gutman, the com
mission had concluded that there
was a systematic policy of rape by
the Serbian government and that
a minimum of 25,000 women had
been raped as part of that policy.
Jacobson's documentary adds
a human element to the num
bers. After the preview, she
stressed the importance of docu
menting atrocities in Bosnia and
called for sustained relief efforts
that go beyond treating the
women affected only as victims.
In his address, Sacirbey reiter
ated that the Bosnian conflagra

tion was not a civil war, saying
that such a depiction allows the
U.S. to justify its uninvolvement.
He compared the Bosnian war
to the Holocaust in its use of
civilians as the target of war.
"The enemy perceived that
they could uSe women as a way to
demean the society that was
under attack. -Effectively, there
was a male-chauvinist perception
on the part of the aggressor that
by demeaning the women of that
society, you were also demeaning
the men," he said.
Watson Davis stressed the
importance of documentation to
ensure fair prosecutions of ra
pists, and also the importance of
starting the healing of people and
their communities. She said she
knew the horror of rape.
"As someone who myself has
been raped, I know what this
type of act brings: shame and
humiliation, defilement, dishon
or, self-blame and self-devalua
tion. However, I do not know
what it feels like to fear for the
safety of my family, my commu
nity and to have that fear keep
me from volunteering very need
ed information," she said.
