# Netters pound Arizona teams
## 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
This weekend's rain did nothing to
dampen the Stanford women's tennis
team's winning streak. In a weekend
of play marred by wet courts and cold
weather, the Cardinal blew out the
Arizona Wildcats 8-1 on Friday and
the Arizona State Sun Devils 6-0 yes
terday. The No. 2-ranked Stanford
squad ran its record to 13-0 while
dropping the Wildcats and the Sun
Devils to 5-3 and 6-3, respectively.
Laxmi Poruri, the Cardinal's No. 1
singles player and the top-ranked net
ter in the country, faced diametrically
opposing styles of play over the two
matches. Her Wildcat opponent,
Celine Verdier, used a touch and
finesse style to try and disrupt the
harder-hitting Poruri. Arizona's Cori
Davidson, on the other hand,
unleashed cannon-esque ground
strokes, attempting to blow Poruri off
the concrete.
Neither was successful, as Poruri
overpowered Verdier then outlasted
Davidson, defeating both in straight
sets.
"I just basically hit to the backhand
and came in," Poruri said after her 6-
1, 6-3 victory over Verdier. "It was a
good match for me to open up a little
more."
To Arizona head coach Becky Bell,
Poruri presented too much of a chal
lenge to her team's top netter.
"Laxmi's not No. 1 in the country for
nothing. She's a great player and
showed that today."
Davidson, an Ail-American ranked
15th in the country, was expected to
present Poruri with more of a chal
lenge, but fell quickly 6-1, 6-1. Cardi
nal head coach Frank Brennan
attributed the loss to her powerful but
run-of-the-mill style.

"Verider was the tougher one for
her. Bangers like Davidson are a dime
a dozen," Brennan said. "[Poruri]
loves that type of player. She feeds off
their power and drops thorn and dinks
them. . . . [Verdier], on the other
hand, is what the good p.'ayers look
like. Not that Verdier is thit tough a
player, but she has the style of a dom
inant player."
On the other end of the spectrum,
Cardinal freshman Katie Schlukebir
had a tough time at No. 3 singles,
partly due to attempts to expand her
game. Primarily a baseline player,
Schlukebir has been trying to
approach the net more, with mixed
results.
"I have to come in more and take
chances," she said after a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4
victory over ASU's Paige Bartelt.
"Sometimes, though, I feel like I'm
playing not to lose rather than to
win."
On Friday the results of her work
were more convincing, as Schlukebir
won a hard-fought match against
Angela Bernal 7-5, 6-4.
Bernal roamed the baseline for
most of the match, using a powerful,
Hat forehand and a crushing serve to
keep both sets close. Schlukebir
switched styles during the match, at
some points trading forehand smash
for forehand smash, while at other
times approaching with off-speed
shots to keep Bernal off balance.
"Katie has a way of making her
opponents play well," Brennan said of
the surprisingly close match. "We've
been trying to get her to come to the
net more and not just hammer from
the baseline until somebody falls
down. She did that much better today
(against Arizona)."
Senior Kristine Kurth, Stanford's
No. 2 singles player, had an uncharac
teristically easy weekend. Kurth has

tended to go to three sets this season,
but dispatched both of her Grand
Canyon State opponents in two quick
sets.
Against Arizona, Kurth met
Michelle Oldham, winning 6-4, 6-2.
The two previously met in the NCAA
Championship team semi-finals last
season, with Kurth winning that
match 7-5 in the third. \
Joel Shad's face was also a familiar
and welcome one for Kurth. Shad,
ASU's No. 2 singles player, is someone
Kurth has played "since I was like 12."
"There are just some people [who]
fit you," Kurth said. "I just like to play
her."
Kurth liked the experience so much,
she finished it quickly, beating the
Dominican Republic native 6-3, 6-2.
The bottom half of the Cardinal
lineup was flawless — typical play for
the trio of sophomore Beth Berris,
senior Emma Woodhouse and fresh
man Sandra De Silva, all of whom
remain undefeated in the dual-match
season. The three did not give up a set
between them on Friday or Sunday.
De Silva continues to impress with
her play at No. 6 singles. Winning 6-1,
6-2 Friday and 6-0, 6-1 yesterday, De
Silva has yet to give up a set this sea
son.
"She just blows people off the court
with her power and accuracy," said
Cardinal assistant coach Lele Forood.
The Cardinal's only loss of the
weekend was the No. 2 doubles team's
three-set loss at the hands of Ari
zona's squad of Bernal and Stephanie
Sammaritano. This Cardinal duo,
made up of Kurth and Berris, was
dealt its first loss of the season to the
tune of 7-6, 6-7, 6-4 in a match that
lasted well into the night. Brennan did
not find the loss important, as Stan
ford had already clinched the dual
meet win at the time.

Sunday's match ended at 6-0 because
the Sun Devil squad had a plane to catch
and was therefore unable to play doubles.
At the end of the dual-meets, both
coaches stressed the second-ranked Cardi
nal's powerful play as the keys to the

blowouts. ASU head coach Sheila Mclner
ney summed up both coaches' feelings
bluntly.
"Traditionally, Stanford's always been
better than us," she said. "They were
again this year."

Arizona Wildcats 8-1 on Friday and
the Arizona State Sun Devils 6-0 yes
terday. The No. 2-ranked Stanford
squad ran its record to 13-0 while
dropping the Wildcats and the Sun
Devils to 5-3 and 6-3, respectively.
Laxmi Poruri, the Cardinal's No. 1
singles player and the top-ranked net
ter in the country, faced diametrically
opposing styles of play over the two
matches. Her Wildcat opponent,
Celine Verdier, used a touch and
finesse style to try and disrupt the
harder-hitting Poruri. Arizona's Cori
Davidson, on the other hand,
unleashed cannon-esque ground
strokes, attempting to blow Poruri off
the concrete.
Neither was successful, as Poruri
overpowered Verdier then outlasted
Davidson, defeating both in straight
sets.
"I just basically hit to the backhand
and came in," Poruri said after her 6-
1, 6-3 victory over Verdier. "It was a
good match for me to open up a little
more."
To Arizona head coach Becky Bell,
Poruri presented too much of a chal
lenge to her team's top netter.
"Laxmi's not No. 1 in the country for
nothing. She's a great player and
showed that today."
Davidson, an Ail-American ranked
15th in the country, was expected to
present Poruri with more of a chal
lenge, but fell quickly 6-1, 6-1. Cardi
nal head coach Frank Brennan
attributed the loss to her powerful but
run-of-the-mill style.

"Verider was the tougher one for
her. Bangers like Davidson are a dime
a dozen," Brennan said. "[Poruri]
loves that type of player. She feeds off
their power and drops thorn and dinks
them. . . . [Verdier], on the other
hand, is what the good p.'ayers look
like. Not that Verdier is thit tough a
player, but she has the style of a dom
inant player."
On the other end of the spectrum,
Cardinal freshman Katie Schlukebir
had a tough time at No. 3 singles,
partly due to attempts to expand her
game. Primarily a baseline player,
Schlukebir has been trying to
approach the net more, with mixed
results.
"I have to come in more and take
chances," she said after a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4
victory over ASU's Paige Bartelt.
"Sometimes, though, I feel like I'm
playing not to lose rather than to
win."
On Friday the results of her work
were more convincing, as Schlukebir
won a hard-fought match against
Angela Bernal 7-5, 6-4.
Bernal roamed the baseline for
most of the match, using a powerful,
Hat forehand and a crushing serve to
keep both sets close. Schlukebir
switched styles during the match, at
some points trading forehand smash
for forehand smash, while at other
times approaching with off-speed
shots to keep Bernal off balance.
"Katie has a way of making her
opponents play well," Brennan said of
the surprisingly close match. "We've
been trying to get her to come to the
net more and not just hammer from
the baseline until somebody falls
down. She did that much better today
(against Arizona)."
Senior Kristine Kurth, Stanford's
No. 2 singles player, had an uncharac
teristically easy weekend. Kurth has

tended to go to three sets this season,
but dispatched both of her Grand
Canyon State opponents in two quick
sets.
Against Arizona, Kurth met
Michelle Oldham, winning 6-4, 6-2.
The two previously met in the NCAA
Championship team semi-finals last
season, with Kurth winning that
match 7-5 in the third. \
Joel Shad's face was also a familiar
and welcome one for Kurth. Shad,
ASU's No. 2 singles player, is someone
Kurth has played "since I was like 12."
"There are just some people [who]
fit you," Kurth said. "I just like to play
her."
Kurth liked the experience so much,
she finished it quickly, beating the
Dominican Republic native 6-3, 6-2.
The bottom half of the Cardinal
lineup was flawless — typical play for
the trio of sophomore Beth Berris,
senior Emma Woodhouse and fresh
man Sandra De Silva, all of whom
remain undefeated in the dual-match
season. The three did not give up a set
between them on Friday or Sunday.
De Silva continues to impress with
her play at No. 6 singles. Winning 6-1,
6-2 Friday and 6-0, 6-1 yesterday, De
Silva has yet to give up a set this sea
son.
"She just blows people off the court
with her power and accuracy," said
Cardinal assistant coach Lele Forood.
The Cardinal's only loss of the
weekend was the No. 2 doubles team's
three-set loss at the hands of Ari
zona's squad of Bernal and Stephanie
Sammaritano. This Cardinal duo,
made up of Kurth and Berris, was
dealt its first loss of the season to the
tune of 7-6, 6-7, 6-4 in a match that
lasted well into the night. Brennan did
not find the loss important, as Stan
ford had already clinched the dual
meet win at the time.

Sunday's match ended at 6-0 because
the Sun Devil squad had a plane to catch
and was therefore unable to play doubles.
At the end of the dual-meets, both
coaches stressed the second-ranked Cardi
nal's powerful play as the keys to the

blowouts. ASU head coach Sheila Mclner
ney summed up both coaches' feelings
bluntly.
"Traditionally, Stanford's always been
better than us," she said. "They were
again this year."
