## Men's golf swings to two seconds in Hawaii 
### Andrew Blachman Staff writer 
Last week's trip to Hawaii was supposed to give
the Stanford men's golf team a good idea of how it
stacked up against the best teams in the nation. It
did all that and more as the Cardinal nabbed sec
ond-place finishes in both the Big Island and the
John F. Burns Invitationals.
Stanford was narrowly edged out for the Big
Island title by Arizona State in Hilo, Hawaii last
weekend to start out the trip. Friday the squad
went on to fall just three strokes shy of top-ranked
Oklahoma State, returning home with two impres
sive second-place finishes.
The linksters set an all-time school record with a
three-round, 21-under par team score of 843 in the
Burns Invitational. Stanford went 30 under par for
the week in Hawaii, by far the best total of any of
the 20 teams who competed in both tournaments.
"We knew this week would let us know how we
matched up against some of the nation's best
teams," said Stanford coach Wally Goodwin. "We

feel great that we can compete with anybody and we
know that we're right in position to play for the
national championship."
Despite Stanford's record performance the team
could not come up with a victory in either tourna
ment. After holding the lead going into the final
round in Hilo, the Cardinal faltered and finished
second to Arizona State. Stanford then started five
strokes off the pace in the first round of competi
tion in Kanoehe and was able only to tighten the
gap but not to catch Oklahoma State.
"These two tournaments just show that we can
compete with anybody," said junior Steve Burdick.
"It was a little disappointing that we couldn't win,
but we played well and it's a nice way to start the
spring season."
Junior Notah Begay 111 won the individual title
in the Big Island Invitational to kick off the trip,
and went on to lead the Stanford team again in the
John F. Burns Invitational. Going into Kanoehe,
Begay was looking for his third consecutive individ
ual title to continue his winning streak which began
in November in Hilton Head, S.C. Begay finished

fourth at six under par, four strokes shy of tourna
ment champion Kris Cox of Oklahoma State.
Three other juniors, Casey Martin, Steve Bur
dick and William Yanigisawa, finished within three
strokes of Begay and helped fuel Stanford's most
consistent tournament to date.
"In the entire tournament we did not have one
official score above par," Goodwin said. "That's
incredible, especially given the lack of practice we
had in the off-season." In NCAA golf the top four
scores per team are counted in the official stand
ings.
Perhaps the biggest boost for Stanford came
from senior Brad Lanning, who plays the No. 5
position for the Cardinal. After a disappointing four
over par in the first round, Lanning shot his best
two rounds of the year with a 69 and a7l in the sec
ond and third rounds, respectively, to finish the
tournament at an even par.
With dead week and finals ahead, the Cardinal
men golfers will not compete again until March 23
when they travel to Santa Barbara to compete in
the Pacific Coast Championships.
