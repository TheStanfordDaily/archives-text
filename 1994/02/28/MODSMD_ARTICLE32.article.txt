# Women tumblers finish second in Chili's Invite
## 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
Overall victory slipped from the grasp
of the Cardinal women's gymnastics team
last Friday night in Maples Pavilion as
California bested the field at the Chili's
"Red Hot" Invitational, defeating Stan
ford, the University of Minnesota and
University of California at Davis.
The Cardinal had hoped to avenge a
loss earlier in the season on Golden Bear
turf in this, its last home meet of the year.
"It is a shame we didn't win," said senior
Laurie West. "If we had hit everything, we
would have beat them."
After two rotations, Stanford and Cal
remained tied, each with 94.925 points.
The meet proved to be a nailbiter, as Stan
ford took top honors in the uneven bar
and floor events, while the Bears placed
first on vault and beam. Coming down to
the wire, however, Cal's final team score
of 189.875 was enough to cement the vic
tory, ahead of Stanford's 189.650.
"It is hard to lose by only two-tenths of
a point," said head coach Breck Green
wood. "I'd almost rather lose by a whole
point.
"We didn't warm up well and were off a
little on everything. You have to be on
when there is competition in the gym."
The Minnesota Golden Gophers
brought in a team score of 187.525 and
came in second place on every event but
bars. Davis remained far from the spot
light during the night, with a final score of
183.400.
Junior Jen 6 Elzie led the Cardinal
team, earning first place in the all-around
competition with a season best of 38.825.
Cal freshman Mindy Ornellas was right at
her heels in second place with 38.725, fol
lowed by Stanford freshman Katie Jen
nings who finished in third place with a
score of 38.525, her highest of the season
as well.
Vault proved to be the thorn in the side
of the Stanford squad, with no gymnasts
executing solid landings. Although there
were few falls, stumbles cost the team,
putting it in third place overall in the
event. Cal's Candice Kwok and Lisa
Washington took first and second place
respectively on the apparatus, while Elzie
tied with Minnesota's Jessica Wolf for
third place.

Stanford pulled together and reassert
ed itself on the bars, receiving its highest
score of the season, a 48.250. Cardinal
gymnasts captured the top three places on
this event, topped by sophomore Hillary
Anderson in first place with a season high
score of 9.800. Jennings and Elzie took
second and third places with respective
scores of 9.775 and 9.725. Junior Meegan
Lannin was not far behind with a 9.650, a
drastic improvement from her previous
season high score of 9.400.
"We did a great job on bars," Green
wood said. "We had a lousy warm-up on
this event, but fortunately that was
turned around."
The Cardinal team failed to capitalize
on one of its strongest events in the next
rotation, as three normally consistent per
formers fell from the beam. Anderson,
Stanford's all-time record holder for this
event, had her first fall of the season.
First and second places on this event went
to Cal's Cindy Tom and Ornellas, while
Stanford's Jennings took third with a
9.700. Elzie was right behind with a
9.675.
Stanford finished off with a strong
floor performance, earning a season best
of 48.050. The Cardinal performed some
new tumbling passes with added difficul
ty, and despite a few stumbles only one
gymnast fell. First place went to Stanford
junior Tina Snowden with a 9.750, Cal's
Ornellas took second with a 9.725 and
Elzie's score of 9.700 earned her third
place.
Seniors West and Mollie Brown were
honored in a ceremony at this last home
meet of the season. West competed vault
and bars, and Brown performed exhibi
tion routines on bars and beam.
"I have been fighting to get back in the
lineup, and I think I came one step closer
with my performance tonight," Brown
said. "My bars are finally coming together
and starting to swing, and I had no falls
and few shakes on beam. I'm feeling con
fident.
"This was a good meet to end on. Yet, I
think we are a stronger team than Cal. . . .
We still have Pac-10's and regionals."
According to coach Greenwood, the
gymnasts will not be adding much more
difficulty to their routines, but rather will
concentrate on perfecting their current
routines and improving their endurance.
