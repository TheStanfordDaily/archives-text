# Split decision
## Spikers suffer narrow USC loss, then overcome Bruins 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
The difference between first place and runner up
is very slight, as Stanford proved over the weekend
at USC.
Heading into Lyon Center with the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation division standings on the
line, the Cardinal men's volleyball squad came
within an eyelash of handing the Trojans their first
loss of the season. Nevertheless, a well-seasoned
USC team (10-0 overall, 9-0 in the MPSF) sent
Stanford (7-5, 6-2) back to the drawing board Sat
urday night with a 15-10, 13-15, 15-10, 15-12 victo
ry-
Before the USC matchup, Stanford made a pit
stop at Long Beach State (8-7, 4-5) and pushed the
49ers further back in the standings with a handy
15-9, 6-15, 15-9, 15-11 win.
"Over the weekend, we had perhaps our best
back-to-back matches of the season," said Stanford
coach Ruben Nieves. "But although we played USC
really close, we still failed to fire on all cylinders."
Failing to fire on all cylinders still meant that
Cardinal defenders managed to muzzle USC's top
attackers, opposite hitter Chris Underwood and
swing hitter Jason Mulholland.
Stanford combined 81 digs and 10 team blocks to
limit Underwood to only 18 kills on 56 chances for
a dismal .161 hitting percentage. On the season,
Underwood ranks with the biggest hitters in the
nation, with 198 kills and a sparkling .475 average.
Mulholland, an Ail-American junior, could not
figure out the Cardinal defense either as he con
verted only 31 of 61 kill opportunities for a sub-par
.361 hitting percentage — more than 80 percentage
points lower than his season average.
"That was our goal going into the match,"
Nieves said. "We struggled with our defense last
week [against Brigham Young], so to see us having
a good passing, digging and blocking match is very
positive."
Despite Stanford's success at the net, the Tro
jans proved that two can play at the defensive
game. Jumping up for 30 total blocks and 64 digs,
USC stuffed sophomore swing hitter Mike Lambert
— allowing him 29 kills against 20 errors for a low
.134 percentage. The Cardinal leader in kills did
not fair much better, as sophomore opposite hitter
Matt Fuerbringer handled 83 sets for 44 kills and a
.325 hitting percentage.
"We had too many hitting errors tonight,"
Nieves said. "The frustrating part is that a large
portion of those errors came on balls that were hit
out and not on USC blocks. If we keep the ball in
the court, it at least gives USC a chance to make a
mistake, but if we hit it out all the time, we give the
rally away."
In addition to the hitting errors, the Cardinal
transition game on service receives buckled under
pressure Saturday. Despite its tremendous number
of digs, Stanford failed to set up plays after the dig
and convert the defensive effort into offensive
results.
However, against Long Beach State, it was a
completely different story. Sporting a new look on
the court, Nieves inserted freshman backup setter
Stewart Chong in the swing hitting position. The
results were nine kills, 10 digs and a solid .615 hit
ting for "a better passing digging and ball control
game," according to freshman middle blocker
Michael Hoefer.
"Stewart did a great job for us in both matches,"
Hoefer said. "He's got a great game and basically
can play at all the positions. Beside that, it helps to
have an extra setter on the court, because he can
set when Canyon [Cemanl goes for the dig."
Against the 49ers, Lambert swung for 40 kills
and a .394 percentage, while Fuerbringer added 32
smashes to the Cardinal effort. Hoefer keyed the
defensive play with one solo block and eight block
assists.
"We showed a lot of promise over the weekend,"
Ceman said. "We were the better team against
Long Beach, and we also proved that this young
team is almost as good as USC."
