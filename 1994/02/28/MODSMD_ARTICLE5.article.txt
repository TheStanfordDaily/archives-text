# Bridge counselors concerned about possible relocation
## 
### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
Student peer counselors at the
Bridge learned last Friday that
both of the buildings that house the
counseling center may be unsafe to
work or live in, which could force
the group to find a new home as
soon as next year.
A study conducted by the Uni
versity earlier this year found that
"there are significant repairs that
need to be made to the foundation
and general structure" of the
Bridge buildings, said Alan Cum
mings, a facilities manager.
Although Office of Student Ac
tivities Program Coordinator Troy
Gilbert stressed that students are
not in danger, he said the Office of
Student Activities is concerned
about the building. "We would
probably want them to move out
some time," he said.
Gilbert said it is "premature to
be making predictions about the
Bridge space" and added that the
University wants to support the
program in every way possible.
However, the prospective move

has caused a great deal of concern
among Bridge staffers. "There is
no substantive reason we should
change the way the organization
works," said senior Cameron
Hamill, a Bridge staffer. "Chang
ing because of a physical con
straint seems very uncomfort
able."
Of particular concern to student
members is the continuation of
live-in staffers. Currently, six full
time students live in the Bridge as
counselors, enabling the group to
operate on a 24-hour basis. But stu
dents are worried that a move to of
fice space could mean the loss of de
cent living quarters.
"The fundamental thing is the
existence of live-in counselors, for
backing up new staffers, taking
calls at night and for continuity —
someone who staffers always see,"
said co-terminal student Andy
Katz, who is a live-in counselor.
Hamill and Katz both said the
operation of a 24-hour service is a
highly important part of the
group's existence. "A lot of emer
gency calls come in late at night. If
we had to close at night, it would
be a huge disservice," Hamill
said.
The evaluation of the Bridge is
part of a study conducted by the
University to determine the phys
ical condition of all the academic
buildings on campus, Cummings
said. The report, which is cur
rently in the process of being
accumulated, will be presented to
the administration later in the
spring.
Cummings said the buildings
will be fixed if the University
deems them a high enough prior
ity. "The issue will be to deter
mine the total extent of the
repairs required and how they
will be fit into the priorities of all
the other academic buildings," he
said.
Although Bridge staffers are
involved in the search for a new
space, Hamill and Katz said the
group is interested in trying to
retain their current building.
"Our first priority is to see if

the current building can be refur
bished," said Hamill.
Katz said that since the group
makes all its money from its
annual Spring Faire rather than
from ASSU special fees, it has
extra funds which it would be
willing to put towards the build
ing-
"lf it's manageable, we'd be
willing to work with the Universi
ty to make repairs," he said. How
ever, he added that the group has
not yet seen the report.
Gilbert said the structure may
not be important enough to the
University for it to order the
repairs. But he added that the
needs of the group are first and
foremost in the University's con
cern.
"There are a number of things
we could do to help the program,"
he said. "We want to help them
find a new place but there's no
definitive timeline."
Hamill and Katz said they are
pleased with the University's sup
port. "They definitely seem inter
ested in helping us find adequate
space," said Hamill. "They are
very committed to continuing the
service."
