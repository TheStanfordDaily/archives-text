# Bridge counselors concerned about possible relocation

### Sarah Katz Editorial staff 
Student peer counselors at the
Bridge learned last Friday that
both of the buildings that house the
counseling center may be unsafe to
work or live in, which could force
the group to find a new home as

A study conducted by the Uni
versity earlier this year found that
"there are significant repairs that
need to be made to the foundation

time students live in the Bridge as
counselors, enabling the group to
operate on a 24-hour basis. But stu

"The fundamental thing is the
existence of live-in counselors, for
backing up new staffers, taking
calls at night and for continuity â€”
someone who staffers always see,"
said co-terminal student Andy
Katz, who is a live-in counselor.
Hamill and Katz both said the
operation of a 24-hour service is a
highly important part of the
group's existence. "A lot of emer
gency calls come in late at night. If
