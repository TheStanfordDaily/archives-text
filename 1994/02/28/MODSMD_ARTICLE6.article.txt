# Group helps Stanford comply with drug-testing rule

Athletics Department administrators
scrambling to meet a March 1 deadline to com
ply with NCAA drug-testing requirements are
getting some help from a new University-wide
drug and alcohol prevention program.
The Stanford Community Partnership for
Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Prevention —
a group of Coweli Student Health Center ad
ministrators and student interns — was
formed fall quarter to develop community
specific programs informing students about

the risks and consequences of alcohol and
drug abuse.
For the athletic community, the program
has shifted its focus following last month's
California Supreme Court ruling which al
lowed the NCAA to begin drug testing some
Stanford athletes.
Stanford had been the only school in the
NCAA which was exempt from drug testing
since 1988, when a state court ruled the pro
cedure a violation of athletes' privacy.
The goals of the drug awareness program,
funded by a $147,000 Department of Education
grant, coincide with the Athletics Department's

desire to provide "an excellent education pro
gram that will comply with the NCAA regula
tions and protect the health and safety of our
athletes," said Athletic Director Ted LelancL
Senior Ross McQuivey, an intern studying
the varsity athlete community, said the Ath
letics Department is "scrambling" to ensure
that athletes are educated about the dangers
of drug use.
McQuivey is one of 10 partnership in
terns, paid $500 per quarter, who will work
with members of various Stanford communi
ties to implement programs specific to each
community by next fall.

McQuivey has formed a working group of
coaches, athletes and Athletics Department
officials to study whether and how the Uni
versity should test athletes for drugs, among
other issues.
He said the University was considering
three options with regard to drug testing of
athletes: anonymous testing to determine
the extent of drug abuse, collection of identi
fied samples to "catch [drug abusers] before
the NCAA does," or not to test at all.
Including coaches in the process is impor-
