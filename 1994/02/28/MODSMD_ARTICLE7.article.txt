While the ethnic centers are putting the
finishing touches on their budget-cutting
proposals, the communities they serve are
presenting a unified front to the Universi
ty as four desperately underfunded enti
ties.
However, the impact of the cuts,
whether across-the-board or varied, is like-

ly to be different for each of
the communities, partly
because each is starting on
a slightly different plane.
The budgets and staff

sizes of El Centro Chicano, the Black Com
munity Services Center, the American In
dian Program Office and the Asian Ameri
can Activities Center vary, though they are
not reflective of each ethnicity's proportion
of the University population.

According to the 1993-94 operational
budget for the centers, the Black Commu
nity Services Center receives the most
funds from the University, $156,573, fol
lowed closely by the American Indian Pro
gram at $151,635. El Centro Chicano re
ceives $142,202, and the Asian American
Activities Center bottoms out the group at
$128,351.
