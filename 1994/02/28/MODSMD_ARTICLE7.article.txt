# Ethnic centers face budget tightening from unequal base
## Distinctive pasts, disparate futures 
### Sandy Lee Staff writer 
While the ethnic centers are putting the
finishing touches on their budget-cutting
proposals, the communities they serve are
presenting a unified front to the Universi
ty as four desperately underfunded enti
ties.
However, the impact of the cuts,
whether across-the-board or varied, is like-

ly to be different for each of
the communities, partly
because each is starting on
a slightly different plane.
The budgets and staff

sizes of El Centro Chicano, the Black Com
munity Services Center, the American In
dian Program Office and the Asian Ameri
can Activities Center vary, though they are
not reflective of each ethnicity's proportion
of the University population.

According to the 1993-94 operational
budget for the centers, the Black Commu
nity Services Center receives the most
funds from the University, $156,573, fol
lowed closely by the American Indian Pro
gram at $151,635. El Centro Chicano re
ceives $142,202, and the Asian American
Activities Center bottoms out the group at
$128,351.
In contrast, Asian Americans
currently make up the largest
minority student population
numerically — representing 24 per
cent of the current freshman class
— and Native Americans remain
the smallest, with 2 percent.
The level of funding for the cen
ters has remained at the same level
for approximately the last five
years, levels that appear to be
entrenched in the history of the
University. They appear unlikely to
change to reflect ethnic demo
graphics or economic parity.
However, Asian American Stu
dent Association member Jerry
Chen pointed out that in the past,
across-the-board budget cutting
has treated the centers as if they
were at the same funding level.
"All the ethnic centers have par
ticular needs. [The Asian American
Activities Center] was the last to go
through development, and we need
to develop the [center] further." he
said.
A historical phenomenon
Differences in funding levels
have persisted over years and
reflect little or no recent revision.
The budgets as they stand today,
along with the differences in fund
ing, are products of past budgets,
said Dean of Students Michael
Jackson.
These budgets have always
depended on the level of program
ming, according to James Lyons,
dean of Student Affairs from 1972
to 1990. Funds have always been
given out "not necessarily at the
same level and not on a per capita
basis," he said.
Since approximately 90 percent
of each center's operating budget
funds salaries, the disparities in
funding levels translate most obvi
ously into staff sizes, though the
differences appear minimal. The
BCSC and the American Indian
Program Office have 2.5 full-time
staff compared to two for El Centro
and the Asian American Activities
Center.
However, in the past some cen
ters have imposed internal cuts to
increase staff. For example, El Cen
tro Chicano adjusted its budget
allocations to increase its staff from
1.5 members to two; staffing now
makes up 87 percent of the center's
budget.
"Our approach had been to treat

each center individually and to
address them in terms of each cen
ter's mission and needs," said Mar
garet Ann Fidler, director of admin
istration in the Office of the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs and the
chief budget officer under Lyons.
Fidler said the budgets evolved
uniquely for each center since the
office responded to the requests
and the programming needs of the
centers individually.
An evolution
The current funding levels of the
centers reflect their ages; the
newest center is poorest, and each
consecutively older center has a
greater budget.
The first center to be founded,
the BCSC, was an outgrowth of the
Black Activities Center and the
Black Students Volunteer Center, a
group active in volunteer and edu
cational efforts in the late 1960s
and early 19705. The BCSC evolved
into its current form in 1979.
The office of Assistant to the
President for Black Affairs was dis
mantled later in the 19705, and a
"considerable amount of money
was reallocated to existing pro
grams. Thus, the BCSC's budget
grew the fastest, earlier," Fidler
said. However, it is unclear if any of
the new funding went into the cen
ter's operating budget.
The American Indian Program
Office first opened its doors in
1974. According to Fidler, the Uni
versity provided significant funding
because of the smaller American
Indian population and "historically
low graduation rates."
A unique facet of the office has
been its involvement in undergrad
uate recruiting — something that
is almost impossible in the larger
ethnic communities, she said.
El Centro Chicano grew slightly
later — the center began as a stu
dent organization and became an
institutional program in 1982.
Authority over some University
funds for Chicano community
activities — freed up when the
Office of Advisor to the President
on Chicano Affairs was dissolved in
1991 — were transferred to the
center's governing board, but none
of the increase went into the oper
ating budget.
Similarly, the Asian American
Activities Center's level of funding
may also be attributed partly to the
time in which it was founded — in
1987 during tight budget times.
"The mission and focus were
unique; there was no targeted
group (for affirmative action

goals)," Fidler said.
Financial limitations
Jackson recently stated in an
open meeting that the centers
would be affected minimally in the
current round of budget examina
tions. In effect, current imbalances
in the operating budgets are unlike
ly to change.
In an interview, he said "every
thing is not equal," and defining
equity through identical operating
budgets would be "inappropriate."
Even if bringing the budgets to
numerical parity were a desired
goal, in the current situation, there
are "very little abilities" to expand
the budgets.
"You have to put it in the con
text of the kind of funds available to
Student Affairs," he said. Five
years ago when budget cutting was
not the paramount concern, the
discussion was more viable, Jack
son added.
However, Fidler points out, any
past change in the centers' operat
ing budgets has not been dramatic.
Once a director and some sort of
support staff were established —
reaching a minimal level for opera
tion — little changed.
Unique, but united
The unique nature of each cen
ter's mission and target group's
needs should not be overlooked in
scrutinizing the budgets' unequal
numbers, agreed Jackson.
"To base the budgets merely on
numerical equality would be inap
propriate — the needs are very dif
ferent for Asian American students
[for example | as for American Indi
an students. Each ethnic center is
trying to emphasize different
things with different communi
ties," Jackson said.
Deans and student leaders at the
centers also recognize the unique
ness of the other centers while
emphasizing their common goals
and interests.
Lisa Lee, the chair of AASA, said,
"The Asian American community is
the largest minority group on cam
pus, and that we are understaffed is
definitely a concern.... [However],
at the core of the issue is full devel
opment of the centers," not a com
parison between the centers.
MEChA chair Gabi Cervantes
reiterated the emphasis on commu
nity effort over contention.
"Each ethnic center is desperate
ly underfunded so it doesn't matter
so much how (incrementally) more
underfunded one center is," Cer
vantes added.
