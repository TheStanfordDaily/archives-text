# Pieces of AIDS quilt laid out
## Display part of AIDS week 
### Karen E. Heywood Staff writer 
Appropriately, Stanford is kicking off AIDS
awareness week with a sampling of the project per
haps most influential in inspiring world and na
tionwide awareness of the epidemic.
For the first time since its beginnings in 1987,
pieces of the San Francisco-based Names Project's
AIDS memorial quilt will be on display at the Uni
versity.
"Almost every other big university has had a big
display," said Stanford Project Coordinator Thane
Kreiner, a student at the Graduate School of Busi
ness.
A "big display," he said, consists of a few hun
dred sections, each of which contain 144 squares.
This week's Stanford exhibit will involve just three
sections, which will be on display from today until
March 6 in the Business School's Jackson Library.
"This small display is a kickoff for what we hope
will be a major display [at Stanford) next year,"
said Kreiner.
AIDS awareness week at Stanford will also in
clude a number of safe-sex programs, discussion
panels and speakers throughout the campus, and a
"Wall of Hope" ribbon memorial in White Plaza.

scheduled for members of the
Stanford and local communities
in Memorial Church tonight, fol
lowed by a candlelight "March to
the Cure" in White Plaza on
Wednesday evening.
The Stanford quilt display
holds special significance for Mike
Smith, who graduated from the
Business School in 1986 and co
founded the Names Project with
Cleve Jones the following year.
"I'm glad to see the Business
School is finally doing some pieces
of quilt," said Smith. "But hope
fully it will have an impact on the
whole campus, not just the Grad
uate School of Business. . . Stan
ford has been a glaring omission
[from the quilt circuit]."
Smith said the quilt was creat
ed after Jones prompted

marchers to carry signs commem
orating those they had lost to
AIDS in San Francisco's 1985
memorial vigil for assassinated
politicians Harvey Milk and
George Moscone.
"Hundreds turned up with
signs," he said. "When they were
taped to the front of the Federal
Building, it looked like one big
crazy quilt, and got (Jones) think
ing.
Smith points to the universal
emotional response triggered by
the image of a quilt. "People are
reminded of something warm,
maybe that their grandmother
made. [The AIDS quilt] keeps the
focus on the humanity of the epi
demic and evokes the same com
passion," he said.
Though its first display con
tained just 2,000 three by six-foot
panels, the quilt in its entirety
now contains over 25,000 panels,
weighs 31 tons and is too large to
show all at once in any indoor set

ting in the world.
Smith said that as the quilt
grows, the Names Project contin
ues to subscribe to its initial three
goals: to help people creatively
express their grief for the many
who have lost their lives to AIDS, to
represent the humanity and enor
mity of the epidemic, and to serve as
an educational tool about AIDS.
"We want to stop the focus on
numbers," said Smith, "And
make people start to see these
people (who have died of AIDS] as
neighbors, friends — people just
like them."
He emphasized that all dona
tions to the quilt project go direct
ly to AIDS programs in the area of
that particular display. In the
past few years, Smith said, the
project has raised over $1.5 mil
lion, "a dime at a time."
Mike Smith will open the Jack
son Library quilt display with a
speech in Bishop Auditorium at
5:15 this afternoon.
