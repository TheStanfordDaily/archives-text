A Symposium
"The Negro intellectual must not be allowed to forget that the integrated intellectual world is not representative of ethnic group aspirations
with regard to the world of the American Negro or Indian The Indian world of the reservation exemplifies the fate awaiting the American
Negro who is left stranded and impoverished in the ghettoes, beyond the fringe of absorption He will be pushed there through the
compulsions of the American capitalistic dynamic if, as the most populous ethnic 'out' group, the American Negro fails to galvanize his
potential as a countervailing force."
[Harold Cruse, The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual, 1967]
"The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line—the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia and
Africa, in America and the islands of the seas."
[W.E.B. Dubois, The Souls of Black Folk, 1903]
"The American Negro must stand up and fight his way out of the social trap in which Western civilization has ensnared him. But he can no
longer struggle with the old methods alone. Protest actions of whatever nature are no longer enough. The Negro must now develop and
begin to use a set of new ideas ... [and] cast them in a theoretic frame."
[Harold Cruse, Rebellion or Revolution?, 1968]
