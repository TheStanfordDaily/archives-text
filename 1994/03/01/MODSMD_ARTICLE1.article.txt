# Crisis in leadership?
## Effectiveness of COP structure questioned on 25th anniversary News analysis 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Twenty-five years ago, the ASSU
president organized rallies where thou
sands of students poured into Frost
Amphitheater and the Quad in protest
of military research on campus.

But times have
changed. The leaders of
today's ASSU, a four
member Council of
Presidents, act more as

liaisons between the administration
and students than a force for mobiliz
ing student activists.
The decision to splinter the execu
tive office into four people, with each
member assigned different tasks of
governing, came about gradually over
the course of seven years, with little
discussion of the change's ramifica
tions.
Denis Hayes, who in 1969 served as
the last ASSU president not affiliated

with a council, re
mained in constant
contact with his con
stituency. "I would go
to a different dorm's
dining hall each night
to have meetings," he
said. "I would guess in
a typical week, I never
put in less than 50
hours."

In contrast, this year's COP has held
irregular town-hall meetings with
overall attendance for the year totaling
about 100 students. And according to
Senate Chair Greg Waldorf, only one or
two COP members typically show up at
senate meetings.
Leadership has also been hampered
by the fact that the ASSU had no exec
utive body last year because students
elected a slate titled "I Prefer Not to
Have a COP," which abolished itself.
Despite the COP's reincarnation,
Waldorf said it has initiated no legisla

tion this year. And resolutions like one
passed by last year's senate in support
of an Asian-American Studies program
have been ineffective, in part because
the executive body has not mobilized
student support.
The issues at stake have changed
since 1969 from military research on
campus to multiculturalism and bud
get cuts, but students' desire to express
their views has not disappeared.
January's forum to protest ethnic
center budget cuts, for example, drew
about 250 people but was organized by
the Students of Color Coalition and not
the COP.
The COP evolves
The document which currently gov
erns the ASSU is itself a product of dis
satisfaction 25 years ago with a senate
whose membership exceeded 100 stu
dents.


Waldorf
In 1969, students passed a new
ASSU Constitution which, though it
included a great number of changes,
maintained the single-president
structure previously in use.
However, in the election held in
1970, students chose to elect a
president whose platform included
three vice presidents — a platform
called the"council of presidents."
At the time, Hayes ruled that
the four-member group could,
under the constitution, take office
and operate as a council.
Both the name and the idea
caught on and students regularly
elected such councils, even though
the constitution still specified that
one member must act as the presi
dent.
In 1977, two constitutional
amendments passed the senate
and the student body, creating a
system of co-presidents, the same
system employed today.
Though the proposals passed by
a large margin, there was little dis
cussion of ramifications, and vot
ers complained of inadequate
information access, saying they
really had no idea what they were
voting on because printed copies of
the amendments were not dis
tributed.
These problems were complicat
ed by the fact that only 10 days
intervened between the senate's
passage of the amendments and

the actual student election — in
which a two-thirds vote was need
ed and obtained in order to ratify
the proposals.
In essence, the COP became
institutionalized because it seemed
traditional to students. After all,
by 1977 most students had proba
bly forgotten about the single
president system used prior to
1970.
According v O Waldorf, some stu
dents are currently circulating a
petition to place an amendment on
the spring ballot that would return
the ASSU to the single-president
system. He introduced the same
bill to the senate in January, but it
failed.
Structural difficulties
According to COP member Ron
Brown, the switch to a COP
spreads the work and the responsi
bilities around, making the job eas
ier for all concerned.
"The best thing about a COP is
that each person can complement
each other," COP member Jason
Snyder said. They have "different
skills they can channel into both
representative and administrative
roles."
However, according to Hayes,
who was an observer of that first
COP election, the motive for split
ting the office among four students
was not so altruistic.
The council system allowed can
didates to "represent diverse con
stituencies," Hayes said. "There
was a perception that it would be a
very close race and that the fusion

idea would be a way to trump the
factionalism and develop a con
stituency."
In other words, students real
ized it would be easier to be elected
with a slate consisting of more peo
ple since more interest groups
could be included in that way.
It wasn't long before disadvan
tages of the council system became
evident. In 1973, senators com
plained of a lack of coordination
between the ASSU and University
committees — which had only
recently begun accepting student
members thanks to ASSIJ lobbying.
In contrast, Hayes 1 described
1969 as a period when the student
committee members were "gaining
power."
The administration also com
plained about lack of communica
tion with the organization, which
then-COP member Brent Appel
described as "being controlled by a
small clique characterized by cigar
smoking and beer drinking."
Today, the ability to represent a
wider constituency remains one of
the primary crutches holding up
this peculiar executive body. It has
become a tradition for slates to
include ethnically diverse members.
With the exception of last year's
missing executive, COPs in recent
memory have included this type of
diversity. This year's slate, for
example, includes two males and
two females, and each member
belongs to a different ethnic group.
Who's to blame?
Though problems now seem to

have hindered the ASSU's effec
tiveness, there are more elements
than just the COP in explaining
the vast changes the organization
has undergone in 25 years.
The COP currently in power
has resisted efforts to impugn
their ability to guide and motivate
the student body.

"I think we've been able to work
effectively as a group," Snyder
said. "This year we've divided our
tasks among us and each had our
own designated responsibilities."
And when Waldorf put forward
his proposal in January to re
institute the single presidency,
Snyder pointed his finger at the
senate, saying that it has not ful
filled its obligations to represent
students.
Though the senate's ineffective
ness has been well documented, its
problems do not seem to offer the
key to the vast changes the ASSU
has undergone.
Indeed, during Hayes' adminis
tration, he said the senate was less
organized than it is today.
"There was not a lot of home

work done," he said. "People
would assemble irregularly and
foment. . . . The only thing they
did that I cared about a whole lot
was pass the budget."
On the other hand, the impor
tance of the senate chair has risen
dramatically. The position has
moved from what Hayes described

'Out of the maelstrom of opinion, the admin
istrators acknowledged that they would deal
with me personally and that there would be
consequences if they didn't.'

— Denis Hayes

as a "zookeeper" to a full-fledged
actor in negotiations with the Uni
versity.
This year, Waldorf worked
alongside Brown in bringing back
summer storage. And according to
Waldorf, it is his proposal — Uni
versity-operated service — which
will be implemented this summer.
The COP had advocated that stor
age become an ASSU business pro
ject.
The University administration
looks to him in "an executive
capacity," he said. "I don't think
they differentiate between me and
the COP — we're all ASSU leader
ship."
In fact, Waldorf said he believes
the senate is running better now
than it has in years.

A single leader
Because the ASSU executive
must meet with University offi
cials, Hayes said it would have been
more difficult to develop working
relationships with four presidents
than with a single leader.
"There was no consensus on
campus about anything," Hayes
said. "But out of the maelstrom of
opinion, the administrators
acknowledged that they would deal
with me personally and that there
would be consequences if they
didn't."
According to Hayes, his major
job as president was to work with
students. "We had a group of peo
ple who loosely represented differ
ent constituencies on campus that
I met with regularly," he said.
"I would think the structural
disadvantages [of a council] toward
active communication would be
formidable," he added.
University officials have
expressed a desire to meet with
ASSU leaders to discuss issues rel
evant to students. Provost Con
doleezza Rice said she has been
"talking to the [COP] since
November."
And University President Ger
hard Casper has also expressed his
willingness to work with the ASSU.
But unless the ASSU leadership
can show administrators that they
have the students behind them,
they will have difficulty accom
plishing what Hayes did: force the
University to take student govern
ment seriously.
Twenty-five years ago, the ASSU
president organized rallies where thou
sands of students poured into Frost
Amphitheater and the Quad in protest
of military research on campus.

But times have
changed. The leaders of

one member must act as the presi
dent.
In 1977, two constitutional
amendments passed the senate
and the student body, creating a
system of co-presidents, the same
system employed today.
Though the proposals passed by
a large margin, there was little dis
cussion of ramifications, and vot
ers complained of inadequate
information access, saying they
really had no idea what they were
voting on because printed copies of
the amendments were not dis
tributed.
These problems were complicat
ed by the fact that only 10 days
intervened between the senate's
passage of the amendments and

the actual student election — in
which a two-thirds vote was need
ed and obtained in order to ratify
the proposals.
In essence, the COP became
institutionalized because it seemed
traditional to students. After all,
by 1977 most students had proba
bly forgotten about the single
president system used prior to
1970.
According v O Waldorf, some stu
dents are currently circulating a
petition to place an amendment on
the spring ballot that would return
the ASSU to the single-president
system. He introduced the same
bill to the senate in January, but it
failed.
Structural difficulties
According to COP member Ron
Brown, the switch to a COP
spreads the work and the responsi
bilities around, making the job eas
ier for all concerned.
"The best thing about a COP is
that each person can complement
each other," COP member Jason
Snyder said. They have "different
skills they can channel into both
representative and administrative
roles."
However, according to Hayes,
who was an observer of that first
COP election, the motive for split
ting the office among four students
was not so altruistic.
The council system allowed can
didates to "represent diverse con
stituencies," Hayes said. "There
was a perception that it would be a
very close race and that the fusion

idea would be a way to trump the
factionalism and develop a con
stituency."
In other words, students real
ized it would be easier to be elected
with a slate consisting of more peo
ple since more interest groups
could be included in that way.
It wasn't long before disadvan
tages of the council system became
evident. In 1973, senators com
plained of a lack of coordination
between the ASSU and University
committees — which had only
recently begun accepting student
members thanks to ASSIJ lobbying.
In contrast, Hayes 1 described
1969 as a period when the student
committee members were "gaining
power."
The administration also com
plained about lack of communica
tion with the organization, which
then-COP member Brent Appel
described as "being controlled by a
small clique characterized by cigar
smoking and beer drinking."
Today, the ability to represent a
wider constituency remains one of
the primary crutches holding up
this peculiar executive body. It has
become a tradition for slates to
include ethnically diverse members.
With the exception of last year's
missing executive, COPs in recent
memory have included this type of
diversity. This year's slate, for
example, includes two males and
two females, and each member
belongs to a different ethnic group.
Who's to blame?
Though problems now seem to

have hindered the ASSU's effec
tiveness, there are more elements
than just the COP in explaining
the vast changes the organization
has undergone in 25 years.
The COP currently in power
has resisted efforts to impugn
their ability to guide and motivate
the student body.

"I think we've been able to work
effectively as a group," Snyder
said. "This year we've divided our
tasks among us and each had our
own designated responsibilities."
And when Waldorf put forward
his proposal in January to re
institute the single presidency,
Snyder pointed his finger at the
senate, saying that it has not ful
filled its obligations to represent
students.
Though the senate's ineffective
ness has been well documented, its
problems do not seem to offer the
key to the vast changes the ASSU
has undergone.
Indeed, during Hayes' adminis
tration, he said the senate was less
organized than it is today.
"There was not a lot of home

work done," he said. "People
would assemble irregularly and
foment. . . . The only thing they
did that I cared about a whole lot
was pass the budget."
On the other hand, the impor
tance of the senate chair has risen
dramatically. The position has
moved from what Hayes described

'Out of the maelstrom of opinion, the admin
istrators acknowledged that they would deal
with me personally and that there would be
consequences if they didn't.'

— Denis Hayes

as a "zookeeper" to a full-fledged
actor in negotiations with the Uni
versity.
This year, Waldorf worked
alongside Brown in bringing back
summer storage. And according to
Waldorf, it is his proposal — Uni
versity-operated service — which
will be implemented this summer.
The COP had advocated that stor
age become an ASSU business pro
ject.
The University administration
looks to him in "an executive
capacity," he said. "I don't think
they differentiate between me and
the COP — we're all ASSU leader
ship."
In fact, Waldorf said he believes
the senate is running better now
than it has in years.

A single leader
Because the ASSU executive
must meet with University offi
cials, Hayes said it would have been
more difficult to develop working
relationships with four presidents
than with a single leader.
"There was no consensus on
campus about anything," Hayes
said. "But out of the maelstrom of
opinion, the administrators
acknowledged that they would deal
with me personally and that there
would be consequences if they
didn't."
According to Hayes, his major
job as president was to work with
students. "We had a group of peo
ple who loosely represented differ
ent constituencies on campus that
I met with regularly," he said.
"I would think the structural
disadvantages [of a council] toward
active communication would be
formidable," he added.
University officials have
expressed a desire to meet with
ASSU leaders to discuss issues rel
evant to students. Provost Con
doleezza Rice said she has been
"talking to the [COP] since
November."
And University President Ger
hard Casper has also expressed his
willingness to work with the ASSU.
But unless the ASSU leadership
can show administrators that they
have the students behind them,
they will have difficulty accom
plishing what Hayes did: force the
University to take student govern
ment seriously.
Twenty-five years ago, the ASSU
president organized rallies where thou
sands of students poured into Frost
Amphitheater and the Quad in protest
of military research on campus.

But times have
changed. The leaders of
today's ASSU, a four
member Council of
Presidents, act more as

liaisons between the administration
and students than a force for mobiliz
ing student activists.
The decision to splinter the execu
tive office into four people, with each
member assigned different tasks of
governing, came about gradually over
the course of seven years, with little
discussion of the change's ramifica
tions.
Denis Hayes, who in 1969 served as
the last ASSU president not affiliated

with a council, re
mained in constant
contact with his con
stituency. "I would go
to a different dorm's
dining hall each night
to have meetings," he
said. "I would guess in
a typical week, I never
put in less than 50
hours."

In contrast, this year's COP has held
irregular town-hall meetings with
overall attendance for the year totaling
about 100 students. And according to
Senate Chair Greg Waldorf, only one or
two COP members typically show up at
senate meetings.
Leadership has also been hampered
by the fact that the ASSU had no exec
utive body last year because students
elected a slate titled "I Prefer Not to
Have a COP," which abolished itself.
Despite the COP's reincarnation,
Waldorf said it has initiated no legisla

tion this year. And resolutions like one
passed by last year's senate in support
of an Asian-American Studies program
have been ineffective, in part because
the executive body has not mobilized
student support.
The issues at stake have changed
since 1969 from military research on
campus to multiculturalism and bud
get cuts, but students' desire to express
their views has not disappeared.
January's forum to protest ethnic
center budget cuts, for example, drew
about 250 people but was organized by
the Students of Color Coalition and not
the COP.
The COP evolves
The document which currently gov
erns the ASSU is itself a product of dis
satisfaction 25 years ago with a senate
whose membership exceeded 100 stu
dents.

In 1969, students passed a new
ASSU Constitution which, though it
included a great number of changes,
maintained the single-president

However, in the election held in
1970, students chose to elect a

three vice presidents — a platform

include ethnically diverse members.
With the exception of last year's
missing executive, COPs in recent
memory have included this type of
diversity. This year's slate, for
example, includes two males and
two females, and each member
belongs to a different ethnic group.
Who's to blame?
Though problems now seem to

have hindered the ASSU's effec
tiveness, there are more elements
than just the COP in explaining
the vast changes the organization
has undergone in 25 years.
The COP currently in power
has resisted efforts to impugn
their ability to guide and motivate
the student body.

"I think we've been able to work
effectively as a group," Snyder
said. "This year we've divided our
tasks among us and each had our
own designated responsibilities."
And when Waldorf put forward
his proposal in January to re
institute the single presidency,
Snyder pointed his finger at the
senate, saying that it has not ful
filled its obligations to represent
students.
Though the senate's ineffective
ness has been well documented, its
problems do not seem to offer the
key to the vast changes the ASSU
has undergone.
Indeed, during Hayes' adminis
tration, he said the senate was less
organized than it is today.
"There was not a lot of home

work done," he said. "People
would assemble irregularly and
foment. . . . The only thing they
did that I cared about a whole lot
was pass the budget."
On the other hand, the impor
tance of the senate chair has risen
dramatically. The position has
moved from what Hayes described

'Out of the maelstrom of opinion, the admin
istrators acknowledged that they would deal
with me personally and that there would be
consequences if they didn't.'

— Denis Hayes

as a "zookeeper" to a full-fledged
actor in negotiations with the Uni
versity.
This year, Waldorf worked
alongside Brown in bringing back
summer storage. And according to
Waldorf, it is his proposal — Uni
versity-operated service — which
will be implemented this summer.
The COP had advocated that stor
age become an ASSU business pro
ject.
The University administration
looks to him in "an executive
capacity," he said. "I don't think
they differentiate between me and
the COP — we're all ASSU leader
ship."
In fact, Waldorf said he believes
the senate is running better now
than it has in years.

A single leader
Because the ASSU executive
must meet with University offi
cials, Hayes said it would have been
more difficult to develop working
relationships with four presidents
than with a single leader.
"There was no consensus on
campus about anything," Hayes
said. "But out of the maelstrom of
opinion, the administrators
acknowledged that they would deal
with me personally and that there
would be consequences if they
didn't."
According to Hayes, his major
job as president was to work with
students. "We had a group of peo
ple who loosely represented differ
ent constituencies on campus that
I met with regularly," he said.
"I would think the structural
disadvantages [of a council] toward
active communication would be
formidable," he added.
University officials have
expressed a desire to meet with
ASSU leaders to discuss issues rel
evant to students. Provost Con
doleezza Rice said she has been
"talking to the [COP] since
November."
And University President Ger
hard Casper has also expressed his
willingness to work with the ASSU.
But unless the ASSU leadership
can show administrators that they
have the students behind them,
they will have difficulty accom
plishing what Hayes did: force the
University to take student govern
ment seriously.
