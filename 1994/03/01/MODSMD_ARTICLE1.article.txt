# Crisis in leadership?
## Effectiveness of COP structure questioned on 25th anniversary News analysis 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Twenty-five years ago, the ASSU
president organized rallies where thou
sands of students poured into Frost
Amphitheater and the Quad in protest
of military research on campus.

But times have
changed. The leaders of
today's ASSU, a four
member Council of
Presidents, act more as

liaisons between the administration
and students than a force for mobiliz
ing student activists.
The decision to splinter the execu
tive office into four people, with each
member assigned different tasks of
governing, came about gradually over
the course of seven years, with little
discussion of the change's ramifica
tions.
Denis Hayes, who in 1969 served as
the last ASSU president not affiliated

with a council, re
mained in constant
contact with his con
stituency. "I would go
to a different dorm's
dining hall each night
to have meetings," he
said. "I would guess in
a typical week, I never
put in less than 50
hours."

In contrast, this year's COP has held
irregular town-hall meetings with
overall attendance for the year totaling
about 100 students. And according to
Senate Chair Greg Waldorf, only one or
two COP members typically show up at
senate meetings.
Leadership has also been hampered
by the fact that the ASSU had no exec
utive body last year because students
elected a slate titled "I Prefer Not to
Have a COP," which abolished itself.
Despite the COP's reincarnation,
Waldorf said it has initiated no legisla

tion this year. And resolutions like one
passed by last year's senate in support
of an Asian-American Studies program
have been ineffective, in part because
the executive body has not mobilized
student support.
The issues at stake have changed
since 1969 from military research on
campus to multiculturalism and bud
get cuts, but students' desire to express
their views has not disappeared.
January's forum to protest ethnic
center budget cuts, for example, drew
about 250 people but was organized by
the Students of Color Coalition and not
the COP.
The COP evolves
The document which currently gov
erns the ASSU is itself a product of dis
satisfaction 25 years ago with a senate
whose membership exceeded 100 stu
dents.
