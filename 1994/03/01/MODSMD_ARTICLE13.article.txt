U.S. diplomat expelled
MOSCOW (AP) — Russia expelled a
senior U.S. diplomat yesterday to retaliate
for Washington's expulsion of a Russian
intelligence officer — a tit-for-tat action
reminiscent of the Cold War.
Among his own spies, President Boris
Yeltsin fired the head of Russia's counter
intelligence agency which provides the
Kremlin with reports on the political situ
ation inside the country.
The abrupt removal of Nikolai
Golushko was another sign of continued
disarray, as well of the ongoing turmoil in
Russia's internal intelligence operations.
But Russia reacted swiftly on the for
eign front, ordering U.S. Embassy coun
selor James L. Morris to leave the country
within seven days. The action was a
reminder that the Cold War legacy of mis
trust still clouds efforts to forge a new

U.S.-Russian partnership.
Russia's expulsion of a U.S. diplomat
was expected after the chief of Russia's
intelligence station in Washington was
ordered Friday to leave the U.S. within
seven days.
Brady law takes effect
(AP) — The federal Brady law took
effect yesterday, turning firearms dealers
in 32 states into a first line of defense to
keep felons from buying handguns.
The dealers, who enjoyed brisk sales in
anticipation, were quick to criticize the
cost, complexity and comprehensiveness
of newly required, or reinforced back
ground checks.
The mechanism varies around the
country. Some gun dealers call a state
agency toll-free, others have to pay, some
will fax or mail in forms.
