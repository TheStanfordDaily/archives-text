## Serbs violate U.N. no-fly zone 
### 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) â€” For
once, the Serb pilots were caught in the
act.
For nearly a year NATO has scoured
the skies and filtered through uncon
firmed reports, watching and waiting
for a clear violation of a U.N.-imposed
no-fly zone.
When it came yesterday, NATO and
its warplanes didn't hesitate to use force
and carry out the organization's first
combat action since it came into exis
tence 44 years ago.
Only two weeks ago NATO took a
new, tougher approach to Bosnia's war
with an ultimatum of Bosnian Serbs:
Withdraw your heavy guns from around
the besieged capital of Sarajevo or face
air strikes. The guns were withdrawn.
But NATO officials said yesterday's
air action was not the result of any new
resolve by the 16-nation alliance or by

the American, French, British, Dutch
and Turkish jet fighters covering the no
fly zone.
This time the Serb pilots just did
eveiything wrong.
"We did what we said we would do,"
said U.S. Adm. Jeremy M. Boorda, com
mander of NATO's southern European
forces in Naples, Italy. "Violations of the
no-fly zone simply will not be tolerated."
Previous violations were mainly by
helicopters or fixed-wing planes on
short, non-combat missions transport
ing personnel or equipment. When chal
lenged by NATO flyers, they landed or
left Bosnian air space.
Although they spotted frequent viola
tions by helicopters and fixed-wing
planes, the jet fighters had not fired a
shot in anger.
That, he said, marked a "difference in
quality" that forced pilots in the two

U.S. Air Force F-16 Flying Falcons to
launch their missiles against the Serb
raiders over central Bosnia yesterday.
NATO Secretary-General Manfred
Woerner told Germany's ZDF television
that this was the first time in a year the
alliance had clearly determined the vio
lation of the no-fly zone by fighter
planes.
"One will learn to take NATO seri
ously," Woerner said.
And this time, six Yugoslav-built
Soko G-4 Super Galeb attack aircraft
were caught bombing a government
held factory near the central Bosnian
town of Novi Travnik.
Claims by the Bosnian government
that Serb planes have bombed before
have not been verified. "This one, we
were there, we saw it, so we know it was
a real violation," said a NATO official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
