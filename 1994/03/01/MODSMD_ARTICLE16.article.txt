WHEN NOTHING happens,
people notice. Among the
people who have noticed the
University's inaction on Asian
American studies is Comparative
Literature Assistant Prof. David
Palumbo-Liu, one of only two pro
fessors who teach in this field at
Stanford.
Last week, Palumbo-Liu an
nounced his intention to take a one
year leave from Stanford and accept
a visiting professorship at Harvard
next fall. While it is not unusual for
a professor to take leave, Palumbo-
Liu's temporary absence will effec
tively halve the size of the Universi
ty's Asian American studies faculty
for even this short period of time.
More importantly, his announce
ment underscores his and others'
continuing dissatisfaction with the
University administration's treat
ment of Asian American studies.
Despite years of student and faculty
pressures to develop a program,
Stanford has remained complacent.
Perhaps the University's silence
and inaction on the issue could be a

sign of genuine disinterest.
Too bad no one said this before.
But if this is all a terrible misun
derstanding, and the University is
truly committed to a strong Asian
American studies program, it must
act quickly to remedy the appear
ance of ambivalence.
It must even go beyond breaking
its characteristic silence on the issue
and take some decisive steps to
ensure that one professor's shaken
confidence in Stanford's commit
ment to the program can be
restored.
If the current lackluster institu
tional support for Asian American
studies at Stanford continues, it will
only detract further from future
efforts to attract top scholars in the
field.
To counter its image of indiffer
ence, which has come about from
such prolonged inaction on Asian
American studies at Stanford, the
University must, simply, act. If it
chooses to do nothing at such a cru
cial time for the program, it may as
well just be saying, "no."
