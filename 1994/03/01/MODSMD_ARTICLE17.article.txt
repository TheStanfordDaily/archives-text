WHEN SHE takes office
March 21, Sally Dickson,
the new director of the
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment, will have a lot on her plate
and should be cautious in prioritiz
ing her duties.
In the past, the office has tackled
a variety of diversity issues on cam
pus, including affirmative action in
staff hiring and education on multi
cultural issues.
Dickson should keep in mind that
such a plan, while valiant, can also
detract from the individual atten
tion accorded to each mission.
The office has never had the
resources to do both jobs effectively.
Its chief mission since its creation in
the 1970s — monitoring staff affir
mative action statistics — was de
emphasized as more resources were
devoted to other activities. Under
the office's last director, the office

even stopped producing its annual
report on affirmative action because
its mission had become so broad.
For this reason an ad hoc Univer
sity committee recommended earli
er this year that the office refocus
on its original goal.
In one of the open meetings
introducing candidates for the mul
ticultural office position, Dickson
sounded a similar note, saying that
the office's focus should be on staff
affirmative action programs, but
that "multiculturalism and affirma
tive action are linked."
And while this is certainly true,
she should realize that her office
alone may not have the resources to
support all its existing programs
while also beefing up its attention to
staff hiring policies.
Dickson has a broad job — but
she shouldn't spread herself too
thin.
