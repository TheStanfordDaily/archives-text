## Dialogue, not polarization 
### 
THE REVIEW is after me. Yes, I
actually read The Stanford Review,
and was pretty surprised to flip
through the usual caustic remarks and
find some of them directed at my
columns.
Unfortunately, I just can't take them
seriously. It's unfortunate because the
Stanford community could really benefit
from a good conservative publication.
It's unfortunate because I know a lot of
Stanford students who equate conserva
tives with The Review. It's unfortunate
because some conservatives feel like they
don't have a voice on campus and don't
identify with The Review. In any case,
conservatives generally don't feel like
they get very much respect from the
greater Stanford community. And that's
just not right.
Pluralism is what the Stanford experi
ence should be all about. Some may
argue that The Review's alienation is
highly ironic, given that its positions
often focus on the exclusion of others.
Consider The Review's top ten best and
worst classes at Stanford, for example. It
may be guilty of simplistic depictions — I
mean, even / have taken Poli Sci 35 and
Econ 1 and will admit to having gotten a
lot out of them. But you don't have to
embrace the conservative ethic just
because you get something out of these
classes.
And, ironic columns aside, I actually
have no problem with corporate Ameri

ca. I wouldn't want to be a part of it, but
my individual choices are just that —
individual, and claim little normative
superiority to yours.
Pluralism is about respecting the
whole spectrum of choices people make,
rather than attempting to define the
legitimate choices for other people. It
involves the concept of layering — rather
than eradicating — the different oppor
tunities open to us all, which means it's
as cool for a woman to be a homemaker
as it is for her to be an astronaut. And
liberals are just as guilty about forget
ting this as conservatives. With plural
ism comes a lot of things you or I may
individually disagree with. With plural
ism comes the Winds of Freedom as well
as the LGBCC — which is precisely
where the opportunity for dialogue
comes in.
Where is this dialogue? Why aren't
Stanford students taking advantage of
these opportunities? Too often the plu
ralism here remains polarized into fac
tions with very little honest interaction
between the two. The reactionary
dynamic between The Daily and The
Review is a classic example of this: Stu
dents flip through the Daily largely with
out questioning the perspective it's writ
ten from. Meanwhile, copies of The
Review get stolen from the stands as
soon as they are distributed. The non
conservative students who do pick up
The Review read it looking to confirm

the worst of their expectations.
And most of the time, they're not dis
appointed. When you represent the sole
counter perspective to The Daily you run
the risk of merely reacting to their issues
instead of presenting an original agenda.
Campus issues should be viewed from a
more comprehensive perspective.
Of course, the means used to express a
message greatly influence the legitimacy
of the issue involved. Ad hominem
attacks never make for great journalism.
Nor does it do a lot to increase the level of
respect of the people outside your com
munity, those you most need to reach.
Ultimately, pluralism is an ideal, and
any expression of it will be inadequate
and flawed. However, making a serious
commitment to an issue involves ques
tioning your own position. Beginning a
dialogue with the very people you most
disagree with is a concrete way to ham
mer your ideals into a form that fits real
ity. If people disagree with each other,
they should talk about it rather than
widening the gaps between them.
That's an easy game to play, but one
with very few rewards.

Liz doesn't quite understand the differ
ence between pluralism and plurality,
but she's working on it.
