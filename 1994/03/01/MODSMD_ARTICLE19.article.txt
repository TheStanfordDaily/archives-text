## Skin color not relevant in discussion of minority issues 
### 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON I started
reading the article "Out of the loop,
students fear 'conservative agen
da'" in The Daily. I wondered what news
had surfaced in the growing tensions
between Stanford students and the
administration — the tensions surround
ing the inevitable budget cuts.
As I read, I noticed yet another ref
erence to those infamous words spoken
by Condoleezza Rice on Jan. 12 at the
forum organized by the Students of
Color Coalition. "I've been black all my
life," she said. Then it struck me, more
than a month after the fact — what do
those words mean?
Rice's comment was a response to a
question challenging her commitment
to minority issues. Her statement was a
troubling and inadequate response to a
challenge posed by a concerned stu
dent. For Rice to reason, as she did,
that therefore "you [the students]
don't have the standing to question my
commitment to minority issues," is far
from a logical truth.
Indeed, it struck me as a knee-jerk
criticism to a legitimate question com
ing from, of all people, a woman intol
erant of knee-jerk criticisms. Rice's
position as Provost necessitates that
she constantly reaffirm that commit
ment to the student body. That she

should think otherwise is a gross
underestimation of the demands we as
students necessarily put on our admin
istration.
A perfect administration would fully
serve each student's interests. Howev
er, we don't live in a Utopia, and I'm not
about to assume without question that
my interests are being served fully. As
Stanford students, we are sophisticated
enough to appreciate the dynamics of
limited resources and the role of sub
jective judgment in the decision making
process.
Furthermore, as minority students,
we are not a monolithic population,
even though we may have an aggregate
interest — ensuring our presence on
this campus. This is a subtle and cru
cial distinction. We are a complex body
of students, who are not by virtue of
our skin color political, never mind rad
ically political. I hesitate to say, we can
look at a majority of the black popula
tion here at Stanford to be reminded of
this fact. Arguably, however, we ought
to be — either one would do. This is one
of the great dilemmas of being a person
of color in America — the reconciliation
of personal autonomy with group
responsibility — dare I say, something
whites can hardly empathize with.
My point is that we must all advo

cate our ideas and interests as individ
uals. When we discern systemic abuses,
then we work as a group to protect our
mutual interests. This is not to say,
however, that we are therefore all the
same within that group. Life is suffi
ciently complex that skin color alone is
not determinant of one's assessment of
the causes of racial inequality. Some
people perceive the problem to be more
superficial (less systemic) in nature
than others; we can look at Clarence
Thomas if we need be reminded of this
fact.
Rice's skin color is irrelevant when
testifying her commitment to student
groups on campus. She shouldn't be
surprised that minority students aren't
placated by her words of reassurance or
that students should have been
appeased is a personal affront. Is it not
surprising that whites were unaffected
by her comments? Was it not a prime
opportunity for The Review to do an
expos 6 on Rice's conflicts of interest as
provost? Of course not, because whites
realize also that Rice's reference to her
skin color is of no substance in the con
text of affirming her commitment to
student groups.
The precarious existence of minori
ties on this campus is one that demands
that we go above and beyond the nor

mal means of protecting our interests.
Certainly, the ethnic centers, as a
reflection of our presence on this cam
pus, are the most obvious manifesta
tion of that predicament. Whether it be
as overt attacks on affirmative action
relating to assertions that our alleged
inferior SAT scores and GPAs are
watering down the quality of academic
life here at Stanford or as subtle as
implying that we suffer from an inferi
or gene pool, we are in a position of per
petually justifying our existence.
To this, I can only say that the pro
portions of cultural biases and systemic
oppression experienced by many
minorities exceeds the threshold of
comprehension of the many truly poor
ly educated on campus. Feeble-minded
ness is most manifest in analytically
unsophisticated assertions. The rela
tively few students actively thwarting
off these malignant forces are doing
what any progressively minded student
would do — staying one step ahead of
the adversary.
I'm not so crude in my assessment of
the opposition as to group the adminis
tration with the other more morally
repugnant conservative associations.
But if we're not careful, who knows?

testifying her commitment to student
groups on campus. She shouldn't be
surprised that minority students aren't
placated by her words of reassurance or
that students should have been
appeased is a personal affront. Is it not
surprising that whites were unaffected
by her comments? Was it not a prime
opportunity for The Review to do an
expos 6 on Rice's conflicts of interest as
provost? Of course not, because whites
realize also that Rice's reference to her
skin color is of no substance in the con
text of affirming her commitment to
student groups.
The precarious existence of minori
ties on this campus is one that demands
that we go above and beyond the nor

mal means of protecting our interests.
Certainly, the ethnic centers, as a
reflection of our presence on this cam
pus, are the most obvious manifesta
tion of that predicament. Whether it be
as overt attacks on affirmative action
relating to assertions that our alleged
inferior SAT scores and GPAs are
watering down the quality of academic
life here at Stanford or as subtle as
implying that we suffer from an inferi
or gene pool, we are in a position of per
petually justifying our existence.
To this, I can only say that the pro
portions of cultural biases and systemic
oppression experienced by many
minorities exceeds the threshold of
comprehension of the many truly poor
ly educated on campus. Feeble-minded
ness is most manifest in analytically
unsophisticated assertions. The rela
tively few students actively thwarting
off these malignant forces are doing
what any progressively minded student
would do — staying one step ahead of
the adversary.
I'm not so crude in my assessment of
the opposition as to group the adminis
tration with the other more morally
repugnant conservative associations.
But if we're not careful, who knows?
