# Academic schools to turn in budget plans
## Deans prepare for cuts amid uncertainty, doubt 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
Although academic cuts were slated to be
minimal during this round of budget cuts,
schools are still finding it difficult to pare
down enough to complete their three-year
budget plans, which are due at the provost's
office today.
Under the clouds of lingering uncertain
ty and possible caps on funding, the schools
have been working to prepare the budgets
since fall quarter.
Most of the schools will continue to
spend the next few days working out the de
tails of their financial needs, with the inten
tion of handing in their proposals by the end
of the week.
The plans for the School of Humanities
and Sciences are still in the works, accord
ing to Dean John Shoven. Though the
school has no fixed budget target, "we will
be proposing some areas for cuts, some

areas for growth" based on plans submitted
by each department, he said.
While some faculty have expressed con
cern that the school might lose eight to 10
faculty billets in the budget-planning
process, Shoven said he does not expect this
to happen. The school's plan, however, may
entail reallocating some faculty billets
among departments within the school.
In addition, the School of Engineering
has not completed its plan, said Assoc. Dean
Jim Plummer, so he could not comment on
specific changes to the school's financial
and organizational structure. He said he ex
pects the school will present the provost
with "some alternatives as opposed to a sin
gle plan."
Administrators in the school foresee
funding cuts not in a percentage reduction
of their budgets but in smaller annual in
creases. Plummer said the school was asked
to limit its general funds allocation
for next year to 3 percent above
this year's allocation, which Plum
mer placed at $27 million.
"I think effectively, it amounts
to a budget cut when you account
for inflation," Plummer said.
But Rice said she had only
warned the school that the Uni
versity had a 3 percent cap on rev

enue and that she had not specifi
cally instructed the school to
observe that limit.
Rice said the uncertainty sur
rounding these cuts may arise
from the nature of academics — a
large proportion of funds going
into fixed costs such as faculty
salaries and the bottom-up nature
of planning and budgeting.
Presenting specific budget tar
gets for the schools, Rice said,
"doesn't make sense" in an aca
demic context. Asking the schools
for three-year plans represented

"a more integrated planning effort
than 4 y° u have X percent cut out
of your budget,' " she said.
While she gave the schools no
specific instructions for budget
reduction, Rice said, "I left the
deans with a very strong admoni
tion" of the need to create compre
hensive plans and to keep the Uni
versity's financial situation in
mind. Rice will discuss the plans
with the deans and come to an
agreement on each school's budget.
Dean of the School of Earth Sci
ences Gary Ernst said that follow

ing Rice's advice, the school tried to
"affect economies where we could."
Ernst said Earth Sciences has
"made a very small cut," but it
could not make any significant
reduction in this new budget, part
ly because the administrative staff
has already been reduced "to the
bare bones" — from nine to five
— as a result of past cuts.
Ernst said this means the only
cuts left to make were in faculty
positions, so the school instead
"tried to consolidate" previous
administrative changes.

Ernst said he does not expect
the provost to implement further
reductions, as there is already "no
blood in the turnip." He added
that the school has the largest pro
portion of self-generated revenue
of all the schools. This year, the
school received only $2.7 million of
its $5.5 million operating budget
from general funds allocations.
Similarly, the School of Educa
tion has not proposed any signifi
cant changes in budgeting or pro
gramming, said Acting Dean Nel
Noddings. "We've been as careful

as we can be [in keeping costs
down], but there are no overall
reductions," she said.
Rice added that the current
round of budget reductions will
emphasize the University's
administrative units and keep cuts
in the academic arena to a mini
mum. She said that whether cuts
will be made, and the extent of any
cuts, will depend on the plans sub
mitted by each school.
"I have just wanted to wait and
see what plans we get from the
[academic] units," Rice said.
