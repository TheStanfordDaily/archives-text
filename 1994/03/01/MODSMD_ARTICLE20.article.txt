# Leaders of Jewish and Israeli community say violence is deplorable
## 
### 
As leaders of the Israeli and Jewish
community at Stanford, we all stand
in shock and horror in the aftermath
of the murderous shooting that
occurred last Friday morning in a
mosque in Hebron.
We unequivocally condemn such
acts of violence. During this holy

month of Ramadan, we send our
heartfelt condolences to the families of
the victims.
We hope that the current move
ment towards peace will continue and
bring the day when "nation shall not
lift up sword against nation. Neither
shall they learn war anymore" (Isaiah
2:4).
