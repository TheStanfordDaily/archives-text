# N'Gai Croal: fly in the buttermilk
## A Nation of scapegoats to hold black people back?
### 
Having fiddled a Mendelssohn tune
in an attempt to close the rift
between his sect of the Nation of
Islam and Jews, Louis Farrakhan man
aged to lower his profile — until his top
aide Khallid Muhammad put the NOI
back in the national spotlight. Muham
mad's speech at Kean College, a diatribe
against gays and lesbians, whites, Jews as
well as other black people, was excerpted
in a national ad by the Anti-Defamation
League. The ADL then asked the Con
gressional Black Caucus and the NAACP
to publicly repudiate Muhammad's
remarks and sever its ties with the NOI.
Time magazine put a full-page graphic
of Louis Farrakhan on the cover, with the
headline "Ministry of Rage." The rest of
the cover read: "[Farrakhan] spews racist
venom at Jews and all of white America.
Why do so many blacks say he speaks for
them?" Inside, the story included opinion
pieces by three black and three Jewish
intellectuals on "The Rift Between Blacks
and Jews"
With headlines like "Why Did Blacks
Turn on Jews?" and caricatures of black

people eating — yes, eating — a Star of
David, these "intellectuals" and Time mag
azine willfully missed the story, in favor of
the worst kind of tabloid journalism.
The Daily, for its part, jumped into the
fray headfirst and without thinking. Earli
er last month, it ran a story on a speech
given by a representative of the largest
branch of the NOI — which has absolutely
nothing to do with Louis Farrakhan. The
writer chose to focus on a few comments
the speaker made about Farrakhan, com
pletely misrepresenting his speech. And
last week, The Daily ran an editorial car
toon that showed a garbage can hanging
from Farrakhan's mouth, with the words
"racism" and "anti-Semitism" written
therein. This, it seems, will be the extent of
our coverage of the NOI and racism in
America.
From the media coverage, you would
never know that the NOI has never burned
down a synagogue or defaced a Jewish
grave site. That the only people the NOI
has ever killed were other black people.
That Farrakhan and Muhammad are
involved in a power struggle over the

group's direction. Or that Farrakhan's sect
uf the NOI is five times smaller than that
of the son of Elijah Muhammad (no rela
tion to Khalid).
You would think, however, that there is
an army of black people about to kill any
white person on sight — with Farrakhan
leading the way.
To understand the extent of the
hypocrisy shown by the media and the
ADL, we have to ask a few questions. First,
how is it that the ADL has any credibility
with national media, now that it is com
mon knowledge that during the '80s they
spied on several civil rights groups, stoop
ing so low as to illegally obtain police files
and share their information with the
police. Which groups did it spy on? The
NAACP, Bay Area Anti-Apartheid Net
work, the International Jewish Peace
Union, American Arab Anti-Discrimina
tion Committee and the American Indian
Movement, among others.
Earlier this year, a racist publication
named The Jewish Week (circulation:
200,000) published an editorial that
blamed Arab sea captains for bringing

black Africans to America and denied that
the Africans came as slaves.
Senior editor Arnold Fine wrote: "The
original Africans were simply indentured
passengers until they could pay off their
fare. Those indentured slaves agreed to
work off the cost of their passage to Amer
ica even before they left their home port
whether it was Africa or England. Those
Africans who were unable to speak the lan
guage got deeper and deeper into debt.
Some unscrupulous settlers eventually
enslaved them and that's how it all began."
I don't recall the ADL taking out a full
page ad to denounce The Jewish Week's
revisionist history. Nor do I recall the
NAACP or any black leaders asking Jewish
leaders to repudiate the publication. Why
is it that all black people are responsible for
the words of a few — a cross that other eth
nic groups don't have to bear?
And with the recent massacre of Pales
tinians in Hebron, can we expect The Daily
to run a picture of Dr. Baruch Goldstein in
an open casket, a picture of Meir Kahane in
one hand and a Galil rifle in the other, with
a garbage can protruding from his mouth?

Somehow, I don't think so.
The idea isn't to engage in tit-for-tat dis
cussions of media misrepresentation or
oppression, but to substantially engage the
racism that cripples America. Racism, anti-
Semitism and homophobia aren't the sole
preserve of the NOI or black people, as
recent events would have us believe. These
"-isms" are deeply rooted in the American
character — and that is how we should
study them.
To characterize "so many blacks" on the
basis of Muhammad's comments is ridicu
lous. Are all Jews racists because of the
statements of Meir Kahane? Are all
WASPs anti-Semitic because former Secre
tary of State James Baker said "Fuck the
Jews"? Should all Scottish-Americans be
considered Klansmen because of their fel
low Scot, David Duke? I don't think so.
Holding a single group up to scrutiny, in
a vacuum that ignores the context of
racism in America, does us all a disservice.
In fact, it's a crime, it's a crime. ..
