## The 						heart's in it Grapplers finish season eighth 
### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
It has been a season of "too manys" and "not enoughs" for the
Stanford wrestling team.
Too many injuries. Not enough experience. Too many close
losses. Not enough old-fashioned good luck.
What the team has proven relentlessly, however, is that it has
the right amount of heart. Battling tough competition and past
injuries at this weekend's Pacific 10 Conference Championships
at Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo, the squad came through with two
NCAA qualifiers, five Pac-10 placewinners and resolve for next
season.
"I think everybody looked good," said senior co-captain Lance
Johnson. "This is definitely an up-and-coming team."
Cardinal wrestlers Tod Surmon and junior co-captain Jay
Jackson both finished fourth in their weight classes and will
advance to nationals later this month. Although normally only
the top three placewinners qualify, both were granted wild cards
based upon their strong efforts.
Jackson entered the tournament seeded fourth at 134 pounds.
He immediately turned on the pressure by beating Cal Poly's Eric

Gould by technical fall in six minutes, 26 seconds.
Advancing in the bracket, he lost 10-5 to number-one seed
Steve St. John of Arizona State, who is ranked fifth in the nation.
After a 14-8 win against Fullerton's Far/in Dineshnia, Jackson
lost his final match to Tony Desousa of Bakersfield, 10-5.
According to head coach Chris Horpel, the fact that all three
athletes seeded above Jay are ranked nationally made his weight
especially rough.
Sophomore Surmon at 150 pounds was not seeded in the tour
nament, although he ended up 2-2 by beating Ryan Kringlie of
Oregon State and Oregon's number-four seed Scott Norton. Sur
mon's losses were both to two-time All-American Joe Gilbert of
Boise State, who is ranked eighth nationally.
"I'll have a much better showing at nationals," Surmon said.
"I'm glad the coaches respected me enough to give me a wild
card."
Horpel said Surmon's final match, where he came extremely
close to scoring a winning takedown, was a primary reason for the
selection.
Disappointingly, Johnson (142 pounds) could not overcome

recent knee surgery and a variety of
other injuries to qualify for nation
als. "I wasn't completely recovered
from my surgery, but I just felt for
tunate that I was able to wrestle,"
Johnson said.
Seeded fourth, he beat Arizona
State's Rob McMinn 13-6 to reach
Fullerton's Kenny Workman. At
the final period, Workman and
Johnson were tied 2-2 and entered
sudden-death overtime.
Johnson dominated the majority
of overtime, but in the final seconds
Workman was able to score, win

ning the match 4-2. Johnson went
on to lose to top-seeded Tony Evans
of Boise State, after which qualifica
tion for nationals was outside his
grasp. Despite this, Johnson decided
to wrestle for fifth place, but lost 6-
1 to Oregon State's Monte Trusty.
"[Johnson] gave it everything
he had, and he almost got it despite
all of those obstacles," Horpel said.
"He really did an unbelievable job.
My hat is definitely off to him."
Johnson ends his college
wrestling career with the rare dis
tinction of being a four-time Pac
-10 placewinner.
The Cardinal had some sur
prise finishers in freshman Jason
Gladden (177 pounds) and sopho
more Scott Whitt at heavyweight.

Gladden achieved his second and
third victories of the year by beat
ing Boise State's Eric Heinz 6-1
and Jim Keck of UC-Davis, 2-1.
Gladden lost to Keck in the
Cardinal's most recent dual
against Davis in sudden-death
overtime. "We had a better game
plan this time," Horpel said. "He
has really improved a notch."
Whitt also reversed some previ
ous losses this season by beating
Davis' Tom Branca 4-2 and Fuller
ton's Julius Reyes 5-3. Branca had
beaten Whitt at the All-Cal Invita
tional last month by technical fall,
while Reyes had managed two victo
ries over Whitt earlier this season.
Also wrestling for the Cardinal
were junior Ramy Saad at 118

pounds, who went 1-2 this week
end; sophomore Ed Medina weigh
ing in at 126 pounds, who was 0-2;
freshman Scott Chapman (158),
who came away 0-2; freshman
Bryan Vaniman at 190 pounds,
going 1-2; and freshman Ryan
Barnes at 167 pounds, who left
with a 1-2 record.
"I was hoping for three quali
fiers, but I think in a sense we were
fortunate to get two," Horpel said,
referring to injuries and the com
petitive nature of the tournament.
"We weren't ready as a team — we
don't have enough experience yet."
Taking the top three honors for
the Pac-10 were Oregon State,
Bakersfield, and Arizona State.
Stanford finished eighth overall.

What the team has proven relentlessly, however, is that it has
the right amount of heart. Battling tough competition and past
injuries at this weekend's Pacific 10 Conference Championships
at Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo, the squad came through with two
NCAA qualifiers, five Pac-10 placewinners and resolve for next
season.
"I think everybody looked good," said senior co-captain Lance
Johnson. "This is definitely an up-and-coming team."
Cardinal wrestlers Tod Surmon and junior co-captain Jay
Jackson both finished fourth in their weight classes and will
advance to nationals later this month. Although normally only
the top three placewinners qualify, both were granted wild cards
based upon their strong efforts.
Jackson entered the tournament seeded fourth at 134 pounds.
He immediately turned on the pressure by beating Cal Poly's Eric

Gould by technical fall in six minutes, 26 seconds.
Advancing in the bracket, he lost 10-5 to number-one seed
Steve St. John of Arizona State, who is ranked fifth in the nation.
After a 14-8 win against Fullerton's Far/in Dineshnia, Jackson
lost his final match to Tony Desousa of Bakersfield, 10-5.
According to head coach Chris Horpel, the fact that all three
athletes seeded above Jay are ranked nationally made his weight
especially rough.
Sophomore Surmon at 150 pounds was not seeded in the tour
nament, although he ended up 2-2 by beating Ryan Kringlie of
Oregon State and Oregon's number-four seed Scott Norton. Sur
mon's losses were both to two-time All-American Joe Gilbert of
Boise State, who is ranked eighth nationally.
"I'll have a much better showing at nationals," Surmon said.
"I'm glad the coaches respected me enough to give me a wild
card."
Horpel said Surmon's final match, where he came extremely
close to scoring a winning takedown, was a primary reason for the
selection.
Disappointingly, Johnson (142 pounds) could not overcome

recent knee surgery and a variety of
other injuries to qualify for nation
als. "I wasn't completely recovered
from my surgery, but I just felt for
tunate that I was able to wrestle,"
Johnson said.
Seeded fourth, he beat Arizona
State's Rob McMinn 13-6 to reach
Fullerton's Kenny Workman. At
the final period, Workman and
Johnson were tied 2-2 and entered
sudden-death overtime.
Johnson dominated the majority
of overtime, but in the final seconds
Workman was able to score, win

ning the match 4-2. Johnson went
on to lose to top-seeded Tony Evans
of Boise State, after which qualifica
tion for nationals was outside his
grasp. Despite this, Johnson decided
to wrestle for fifth place, but lost 6-
1 to Oregon State's Monte Trusty.
"[Johnson] gave it everything
he had, and he almost got it despite
all of those obstacles," Horpel said.
"He really did an unbelievable job.
My hat is definitely off to him."
Johnson ends his college
wrestling career with the rare dis
tinction of being a four-time Pac
-10 placewinner.
The Cardinal had some sur
prise finishers in freshman Jason
Gladden (177 pounds) and sopho
more Scott Whitt at heavyweight.

Gladden achieved his second and
third victories of the year by beat
ing Boise State's Eric Heinz 6-1
and Jim Keck of UC-Davis, 2-1.
Gladden lost to Keck in the
Cardinal's most recent dual
against Davis in sudden-death
overtime. "We had a better game
plan this time," Horpel said. "He
has really improved a notch."
Whitt also reversed some previ
ous losses this season by beating
Davis' Tom Branca 4-2 and Fuller
ton's Julius Reyes 5-3. Branca had
beaten Whitt at the All-Cal Invita
tional last month by technical fall,
while Reyes had managed two victo
ries over Whitt earlier this season.
Also wrestling for the Cardinal
were junior Ramy Saad at 118

pounds, who went 1-2 this week
end; sophomore Ed Medina weigh
ing in at 126 pounds, who was 0-2;
freshman Scott Chapman (158),
who came away 0-2; freshman
Bryan Vaniman at 190 pounds,
going 1-2; and freshman Ryan
Barnes at 167 pounds, who left
with a 1-2 record.
"I was hoping for three quali
fiers, but I think in a sense we were
fortunate to get two," Horpel said,
referring to injuries and the com
petitive nature of the tournament.
"We weren't ready as a team — we
don't have enough experience yet."
Taking the top three honors for
the Pac-10 were Oregon State,
Bakersfield, and Arizona State.
Stanford finished eighth overall.
