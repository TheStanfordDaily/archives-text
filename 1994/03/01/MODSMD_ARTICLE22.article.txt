## The heart's in it Grapplers finish season eighth
### Allyson Mizoguchi Staff writer 
It has been a season of "too manys" and "not enoughs" for the
Stanford wrestling team.
Too many injuries. Not enough experience. Too many close
losses. Not enough old-fashioned good luck.
What the team has proven relentlessly, however, is that it has
the right amount of heart. Battling tough competition and past
injuries at this weekend's Pacific 10 Conference Championships
at Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo, the squad came through with two
NCAA qualifiers, five Pac-10 placewinners and resolve for next
season.
"I think everybody looked good," said senior co-captain Lance
Johnson. "This is definitely an up-and-coming team."
Cardinal wrestlers Tod Surmon and junior co-captain Jay
Jackson both finished fourth in their weight classes and will
advance to nationals later this month. Although normally only
the top three placewinners qualify, both were granted wild cards
based upon their strong efforts.
Jackson entered the tournament seeded fourth at 134 pounds.
He immediately turned on the pressure by beating Cal Poly's Eric

Gould by technical fall in six minutes, 26 seconds.
Advancing in the bracket, he lost 10-5 to number-one seed
Steve St. John of Arizona State, who is ranked fifth in the nation.
After a 14-8 win against Fullerton's Far/in Dineshnia, Jackson
lost his final match to Tony Desousa of Bakersfield, 10-5.
According to head coach Chris Horpel, the fact that all three
athletes seeded above Jay are ranked nationally made his weight
especially rough.
Sophomore Surmon at 150 pounds was not seeded in the tour
nament, although he ended up 2-2 by beating Ryan Kringlie of
Oregon State and Oregon's number-four seed Scott Norton. Sur
mon's losses were both to two-time All-American Joe Gilbert of
Boise State, who is ranked eighth nationally.
"I'll have a much better showing at nationals," Surmon said.
"I'm glad the coaches respected me enough to give me a wild
card."
Horpel said Surmon's final match, where he came extremely
close to scoring a winning takedown, was a primary reason for the
selection.
Disappointingly, Johnson (142 pounds) could not overcome
