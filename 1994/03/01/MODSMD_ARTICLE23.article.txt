## Pac-10 men's hoops likely to make weak showing in NCAA tourney 
### 
Mark your calendars, hoops
fans: only 17 more days
'till the start of the Big
Dance — the NCAA Tournament.
But with the Madness that this
month brings comes the stark
realization that Pacific 10 Confer
ence teams will not dance more
than a song or two.

A wild and unpredictable week
end of Pacific 10 Conference bas
ketball this past weekend in Los
Angeles among the four California
schools illustrated how good —
and how bad — Pac-10 hoops can
be.
The California Golden Bears
appeared to be in the driver's seat
for the league title after defeating
UCLA in Pauley Pavilion on
Thursday night — the first time
the Bears swept the Bruins in the
regular season since they won the
NCAA title in 1959 under coach
Pete Newell.
Cal, coming off an impressive
win against Cincinnati before the
victory, appeared ready for
the Tourney. But Saturday, the
Bears lost to lowly USC at the
Sports Arena.
That defeat does not signify
parity in the Pac-10. What it does
signify is that the teams at the
upper echelon of the league are
not playing with the intensity
needed night-in and night-out.
Even more troubling is that an
effort like that in the tournament
will result in an early season vaca
tion, much like Arizona had a year
ago when it lost in the first round
to Santa Clara.
UCLA, which was at the top of
the national rankings just six
weeks ago, languishes in the mid
dle of the polls. The Bruins could
win the league crown despite los
ing twice to Cal and once to Ari
zona. It seems the Bruins may

have peaked too early. Despite a
19-4 record, UCLA has not defeat
ed any noteworthy teams, other
than Arizona at home.
By contrast, every potentially
difficult game the Bruins have
played they have lost, including an
embarrassing blowout at Notre
Dame. This Sunday's matchup
with No. 8 Louisville gives UCLA
one last chance to prove itself
against a quality opponent.
Then there's Arizona, which
impresses the nation each year
during the regular season, only to
choke at Tourney Time. The Wild
cats, currently ranked No. 9 in the
country, lost narrowly to Ken
tucky earlier in the year and have
defeated Michigan. Yet they have
also lost to Washington, one of the
Pac-10's doormats, and barely
beat a weak Oregon squad this
weekend.
While teams in other leagues
are peaking this time of year, it
seems that the Pac-10's big three
are fading. Why? Except when
they play each other, the teams
don't seem to take the other
league games all that seriously.
They don't have to play their best
all the time to win like in the
Atlantic Coast or Big Ten Confer
ences. They can just coast, know
ing that each game they only have
to play hard for one five-to-seven
minute stretch to put the game
away.
So then, where does that leave
Stanford's tournament hopes?
Very much on the bubble. If Stan
ford wins its remaining four
games, the Cardinal will have an
18-9 overall record, 11-7 in the
Pac-10 with a fourth place finish.
Stanford was 18-11 two years
ago and finished fourth in the Pac,
but the league had three teams
ranked in the top ten and six
teams with at least 18 wins. This
year, the league is not as strong, as
the Pac has one top ten team, and
two others in the top twenty.
Stanford has quality wins over
Virginia and Cal, but the Cal vic
tory diminished in stature this
weekend when the Bears fell to
the Trojans.
Ultimately, Stanford's fate

rests with the outcomes of postsea
son tournaments in other confer
ences. If some underdogs win their
league's automatic bids, the Cardi
nal will be on the outside looking in.

By the same token, that's
assuming Stanford does its part in
its remaining contests. As UCLA
demonstrated Saturday, point
guard Brevin Knight determines
the Cardinal's fate. When Knight
picked up his fifth personal foul at
the 12-minute mark, the brothers
O'Bannon waved him — and the
rest of Stanford's team — goodbye.

The game was over.
If Knight fouls out again, leav
ing the Cardinal with suspect ball
handling, the door will close on
Stanford's NCAA chances. Also, all
bets are off if Stanford showcases
another horrendous display of
missed free-throws.
With two weeks left in the regu
lar season, its time for the Pac-10's

elite to consider taking their games
seriously. Maybe that will earn the
league back some of the respect it
has lost. Otherwise, the only thing
Pac-10 teams are going to be able to
be serious about from the Sweet
Sixteen onward is who will win
each of their betting pools.
And West Coast basketball will
again be the target of ridicule.
