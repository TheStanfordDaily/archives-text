# Netters capture National Indoor Championships
## Men down stiff competition, emerge best of top-18 teams 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
They're the best.
At the United States Tennis
Association/Intercollegiate Tennis
Association Men's National
Indoors Championship in
Louisville, Ky., the Stanford men's
tennis team vaulted to the top of
the collegiate tennis world by tak
ing the national title last weekend.
"The guys just really did a nice
job," said Stanford head tennis
coach Dick Gould. "We didn't have
an easy match the entire tourna
ment, and they really came
through."
National Indoors featured an
impossibly competitive field,
including the top 18 teams in the
nation. Among those vying for the
national championship were previ
ously top-ranked Georgia, USC,
Texas, Duke, UCLA and the rest of
the top teams in the Rolex Colle
giate Tennis Rankings.
As the second seed in the tour

nament, the Cardinal received a
first round bye. Stanford played its
first match on Thursday, defeating
No. 17-ranked Virginia Common
wealth.
Stanford lost two of three dou
bles matches, sending it to singles
play down one point out of a possi
ble seven. But despite VCU's dom
inating size and serve-and-volley
savvy on the hard, fast courts, the
Cardinal bounced back, dominat
ing singles play and winning all but
Vimal Patel's tie-breaker match
against VCU's Jonas Elmblad.
Jim Thomas, the No. 6-ranked
player in the nation thanks to his
victory at the Rolex Regional
Championships in the fall, easily
dominated his opponent, placing in
the sixth position.
On Friday, Stanford faced a
tough No. 12-ranked Pepperdine
squad in the quarterfinals. Howev
er, Stanford had beaten the Waves
earlier in the year, and repeated
the task at Indoors. Pepperdine
featured a slate of foreign players

in both singles and doubles.
Stanford won a close doubles
competition, two matches to one,
despite the loss of the No. 7-ranked
team of Vimal Patel and Jeff
Salzenstein, who also lost the day
before.
With decisive matches from No.
4-ranked Michael Flanagan and
Thomas in singles, Stanford
topped Pepperdine by a 4-2 mar
gin.
Saturday's semi-final match
against No. 7-ranked Mississippi
State proved tougher for the Cardi
nal, providing the tightest play in
the tournament. The day before
Mississippi State had upset No. 4
Texas in a lopsided 6-1 victory.
Despite a win from Patel/-
Salzenstein to the Laurent Orsi
ni/Remi Barbarin doubles team,
Stanford lost the doubles competi
tion and narrowly won the neces
sary fourth game of singles compe
tition. Thomas won the decisive
match after a tedious battle.
Thomas won a third set tie-breaker,
4-6,6-3, 7-6(8) in what was possibly
the most exciting match of the tour
nament.
MSU's Orsini, the top-ranked
player in the nation, dominated
Flanagan 6-4, 6-0 but later lost the

men's singles title to fourth-seeded
Sargis Sargsian of Arizona State,
who did not lose so much as a single
set the entire tournament.
Stanford players Robert Devens
and Thomas went undefeated
throughout the tournament as
well.
Sunday's final against Georgia
was perhaps a bit anti-climactic.
After Flanagan and partner Chris
Cocotos won at first doubles and
Devens and his partner Grant

Elliott won at third, Stanford had
the first point of the match going
into singles. Thomas and Devens
both posted quick two-set wins, and
when Patel won at third singles, the
match was clinched at 4-1, malting
Georgia's eventual victories at first
and second singles ineffectual.
"At some point during the tour
nament, every guy on the team had
a significant win," Gould said. "It
was really a team win."
The last time Stanford won the

Indoor title was in 1992, when the
Cardinal went on to win the NCAA
Championship. Stanford also won
the NCAA title after winning
Indoors in 1990. It was the Cardi
nal's eighth National Indoors title
overall.
"This showed we can play with
the best teams in the country," said
Gould of the win. "I don't want to
minimize the win, but we will con
tinue to improve as a team and get
better."
They're the best.
