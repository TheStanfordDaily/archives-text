They're the best.
At the United States Tennis
Association/Intercollegiate Tennis
Association Men's National
Indoors Championship in
Louisville, Ky., the Stanford men's
tennis team vaulted to the top of
the collegiate tennis world by tak
ing the national title last weekend.
"The guys just really did a nice
job," said Stanford head tennis
coach Dick Gould. "We didn't have
an easy match the entire tourna
ment, and they really came
through."
National Indoors featured an
impossibly competitive field,
including the top 18 teams in the
nation. Among those vying for the
national championship were previ
ously top-ranked Georgia, USC,
Texas, Duke, UCLA and the rest of
the top teams in the Rolex Colle
giate Tennis Rankings.
As the second seed in the tour

nament, the Cardinal received a
first round bye. Stanford played its
first match on Thursday, defeating
No. 17-ranked Virginia Common
wealth.
Stanford lost two of three dou
bles matches, sending it to singles
play down one point out of a possi
ble seven. But despite VCU's dom
inating size and serve-and-volley
savvy on the hard, fast courts, the
Cardinal bounced back, dominat
ing singles play and winning all but
Vimal Patel's tie-breaker match
against VCU's Jonas Elmblad.
Jim Thomas, the No. 6-ranked
player in the nation thanks to his
victory at the Rolex Regional
Championships in the fall, easily
dominated his opponent, placing in
the sixth position.
On Friday, Stanford faced a
tough No. 12-ranked Pepperdine
squad in the quarterfinals. Howev
er, Stanford had beaten the Waves
earlier in the year, and repeated
the task at Indoors. Pepperdine
featured a slate of foreign players

in both singles and doubles.
Stanford won a close doubles
competition, two matches to one,
despite the loss of the No. 7-ranked
team of Vimal Patel and Jeff
Salzenstein, who also lost the day
before.
With decisive matches from No.
4-ranked Michael Flanagan and
Thomas in singles, Stanford
topped Pepperdine by a 4-2 mar
gin.
Saturday's semi-final match
against No. 7-ranked Mississippi
State proved tougher for the Cardi
nal, providing the tightest play in
the tournament. The day before
Mississippi State had upset No. 4
Texas in a lopsided 6-1 victory.
Despite a win from Patel/-
Salzenstein to the Laurent Orsi
ni/Remi Barbarin doubles team,
Stanford lost the doubles competi
tion and narrowly won the neces
sary fourth game of singles compe
tition. Thomas won the decisive
