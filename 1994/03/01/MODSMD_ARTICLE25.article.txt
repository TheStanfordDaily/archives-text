# Panel discusses issues facing women athletes

### Sarah Nagae Editorial staff 
As part of the Women's Herstory Cel
ebration, a panel of Stanford women ath
letes and coaches met yesterday to dis
cuss some of the issues which female
players face as well as trends in future of
women's sports.
Associate Athletic Director Cheryl
Levick moderated "Women in Athletics
at Stanford" whose participants
addressed the challenges of balancing
athletics and academics and also related
their experiences making the transition
into collegiate athletics and the pride
associated with Stanford sports.
A lack of female role models in the

media and a dangerous fixation on body
image were also topics panelists agreed
are important areas of focus in which
changes to a more healthy attitude are
needed.
"One of the things I think that
women's sports allows you to do is to be
around women who are very confident,"
said senior field hockey player Gina
Bianchini. "It's one of the few opportuni
ties women have to be in very high pres
sure situations."
While the stresses of athletics at Stan
ford can be positive influences on the
development of women's self-esteem,
some athletes find maintaining class-
work and competition difficult.
Having balanced her time between
the two for the past four years,
tennis star Laxmi Poruri related
the ways in which her participa
tion in sports has lead to academic
improvements.
"I think my tennis has forced
me to discipline myself and as a
result has helped me to perform
better in my academics," the
senior said. "There are times
though when you do get very, very
frustrated about not having
enough time to do everything."
Male and female athletes alike
struggle to fit in study time in the
middle of road trips and practices.
Women's challenges can be
tougher at times, however, due to
a downplaying in the media of
women as serious sports con
tenders, said women's fencing
coach Sheri Posthumus.
"We don't have the role models,
I think that is one of biggest prob
lems facing women's sports,"
Posthumus said.
Women's gymnastics assistant
coach Lisa Izzi agreed that
women's sports lack the same tele
vision coverage afforded to men's
events but also noted the
increased coaching opportunities
for women in the past ten years.
"Any women [who's] in a
strong role that's successful, we
need to emphasize that and keep
on building on it," Izzi said.
One way more women can gain
exposure and serve as models for

younger female athletes is
through coaching and administra
tive positions, Posthumus empha
sized.
"It's the new women's net
working as opposed to the good old
boy's networking, where ever you
can get a qualified woman in
you've got to push," she said.
Junior basketball player Rachel
Hemmer cited Cheryl Miller, now
the women's basketball coach at
USC, as one of the players she
looked up to as an inspiration
while growing up.
"It was real ironic for me when
we went down there," Hemmer
said of the Cardinal's early season
loss in Los Angeles. "Here's this
woman I had watched play and I
said 'God, I hope someday I'll do
half the things that she can do.'
Afterwards she put her arm
around me and was talking to me
like I was a regular person."
While truly talented female
players pound the courts and take
to the fields, there remains an
absence of strong, fit women ath
letes in the media, the panelists
agreed. An unrealistic ideal is
often represented which presents
women as submissive and unable
to compete at the same intensity
level as men.
One of women's primary chal
lenges today lies in modifying this
stereotype so female athletes will
come to be viewed as equally seri
ous as their male counterparts.
"I think what should be por
trayed in terms of women in
sports and body image is that it's
okay to be strong and okay to be
big — this is what a healthy
woman looks like," Bianchini said.
