# On a hot streak
## No. 10 baseball challenges unbeaten Wolves 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
Last weekend, the Stanford baseball team
cooled off the conference powerhouse Sun Devils
by winning two of three games, including a dou
bleheader sweep. The No. 10 Cardinal will now
try to put the deep freeze on an equally hot team,
the undefeated University of Nevada-Reno
Wolfpack at 2 p.m. today at Sunken Diamond.
After a 2-1 victory in last weekend's series,
Stanford's record improved to 12-7, 2-1 in Six-
Fac play, while the Wolfpack stands at 5-0
after a three-game series sweep over Santa
Clara in Reno.
After struggling early on in the season, the
Stanford offense has been highly productive
recently. Senior designated hitter Nate Olm
stead leads the Cardinal with a .381 batting
average, with a team-leading 24 hits and eight
doubles, while first baseman Dusty Allen and

second baseman Jed Hansen are both batting
over .300 with a team leading 17 RBIs each.
"We're getting better offensively, but I still
think there's a lot of room for improvement,"
said Stanford coach Mark Marquess. "We're
starting to get a little better idea of what we're
trying to do offensively."
Also key to the recent offensive revival have
been an increasing number of stolen bases and
successful hit-and-run plays. The Cardinal was
successful on eight of nine stolen base attempts
against Arizona State, and have been success
ful on 28 of 39 attempts this year. Leading the
team is Hansen, who has pilfered the 90 feet
eight times this season.
"Prior to the last four or five games we
haven't had a lot of base runners so we haven't
had the opportunity to steal a lot of bases,"
Marquess said. "Even though we're hitting the
ball a lot better, we haven't been scorching the
ball, so when I do get a base runner I do a lot of

hit and runs, or a lot of steals trying to gener
ate more ofTense."
As a powerful complement to Stanford's
aggressive ofTense, the youthful Cardinal pitch
ing stafT has exceeded even the coaching staff's
expectations, compiling a 3.10 ERA overall with
123 strikeouts in 19 games. Opposing hitters are
batting only .238 against the Stanford hurlers.
"I am surprised by the success of the young
pitchers," Marquess said. "We felt going into
the season we had a lot of young, talented arms,
but to expect them to pitch to the level they
have, you can't expect that."
Stanford will likely start righthander Todd
Bartels today. The sophomore has compiled a
3-0 record with a 4.74 ERA so far in the 1994
season.
Allen said he believes consistent run produc
tion and the continuing dominance of the
pitching staff will be the keys to success during
the rest of the season.
