# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Some things are just expected. A routine
fly ball. That perfectly set up cross-court
smash.
Others are worthy of more than the usual
nod and clap, feats that can bring an entire
gym of fans to their feet or cause people to
turn to their friends in amazement and ask,
"How do they do that?"

The performances of The Daily's athletes
of the week Kate Starbird and Mark Booth
definitely fall into the second of these cate
gories. Both delivered rousing efforts which
led the women's basketball team and the
men's gymnastics team to important victo
ries.
In her first year on the Farm, Starbird
has already proven a valuable, if not key
contributor for Stanford. She came off the
bench during Saturday's 94-82 win over
UCLA to score a career-high 24 points in
less than 20 minutes of play.
The Tacoma, Wash., native's stuff of
Bruin Ricarda Kuypers merited a "standing
O" from Maples onlookers after which she
sunk the next 11 of 14 points for the Cardi
nal. Starbird has been Stanford's high scor
er five times this season and currently ranks
second in the Pac-10 in free-throws.

While Starbird brings a freshman youth
and enthusiasm to the court, Booth provides
the gymnastics team with four years of
knowledge and experience. In his second
year as captain of the defending national
championship team, Booth led the No. 6
Cardinal over the weekend to back-to-back
victories over No. 7 Michigan and No. 9
UCLA.
Hailing from Reno, Nev., Booth's Satur
day night 9.80 high-bar routine and 9.75
pommel horse showing propelled Stanford

past its competition on its way to a season
high overall score of 283.70.
While an Achilles heal injury sidelined
Booth during the 1993 NCAA Champi
onships, he played a key role in earning the
Cardinal's first national title and will surly
be one Stanford's centerpieces as the team
makes a run for its third crown.
