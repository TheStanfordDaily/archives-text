# Outside firms bid for University legal work
## 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Senior staff writer 
The Legal Office's restructuring plans
will likely involve sending significant
amounts of the University's legal work to
outside firms, several individuals close to
the office said yesterday.
But General Counsel Michael Roster,
who said all 12 firms that expressed inter
est in Stanford's legal work submitted for
mal bids last week, maintained that the ex
tent of changes the office will face has not
yet been decided.
"We're very likely making changes,"
Roster said, "but how dramatic they will be

are truly unknown at this point."
Roster solicited bids for three levels of
outside work: for all of the University's legal
needs, for specific components of the office's
work — such as all litigation or all real estate
work — and for providing a back-up con
sulting service to the office. Bids to handle
the legal work for Stanford Health Services,
which includes Stanford Hospital, the Fam
ily Practice Program and the Medical
School, were also accepted. Law firms could
submit bids for any or all of these options.
All three options will involve layoffs of
some University attorneys and support
staff, sources close to the office
said.
Seven of the 12 firms submitted
bids to handle all of the office's
work, said Roster, who discussed
the restructuring effort with his
staff yesterday afternoon. "The
proposals were all very competitive.
..." he said. "One showed how we
can save up to a million dollars."
Roster, who spent the weekend
poring through thick binders con
taining each firm's proposal,
expects to decide on a final restruc
turing plan within three weeks.
"The people in this office have been
working very hard and have been
very loyal to Stanford and they
need to know the outcome as soon
as possible," he said.
'Big changes here'
Some attorneys in the office pri
vately concede that the focus of the

restructuring effort is becoming
clearer and will result in a large
scale transformation of how the
office operates. They say most of
the office's work will eventually be
contracted to outside firms.
"It would be extremely shock
ing if this plan didn't go through in
a dramatic way," said one individ
ual close to the office who did not
want to be identified. "We're going
to be seeing some big changes
here."
Roster, however, downplayed
talk of massive changes, especially
in the office's staff. Most of the
firms who placed bids are interest
ed in keeping a "core group" of cur
rent attorneys in the office and
may hire other existing University
lawyers to help with Stanford
related work, he said.
The 16-member office currently
handles 95 percent of the Stanford's
legal work, while the remainder —
usually cases that require experts in
certain areas — is sent to outside
firms. The University spends about
$5 million a year on the office and

an addition $1 million to $2 million
on outside legal services.
A clear picture of what changes
may take place is not yet available
because the University is ventur
ing into uncharted territory, Ros
ter said. But he is hoping that his
trailblazing will pay off in the end.
"We're taking it step by step and
we're trying to develop a process as
we go along," he said. Final deci
sions will be based primarily on
three factors: the quality of attor
neys a firm can provide, their
expertise in areas of importance to
Stanford and total cost.
Eliminating barriers
As the restructuring process
progresses, some have started to
question the actual savings such a
change would provide. Another
individual close to the office said
that while cost-reductions were
touted as the major reason for the
change a few weeks ago, the focus
has currently shifted to "expertise
and elasticity" — Roster's catch
phrase for the ability to quickly

move legal resources from one area
to another.
"The bottom line has become a
moving target," the source said.
"The savings will be questionable."
Several people familiar with the
office have questioned whether an
outside firm can, over the long run,
provide the University with the
same level and quality of service
the current staff provides.
As part of any restructuring
plan, University departments will
also be asked to reduce their legal
needs as much as possible, the
source said. "They'll have to be
especially careful now when doing
things like terminating people."
Ultimately, Roster hopes the
process will establish a new way to
provide legal services to the Uni
versity by eliminating the barriers
between internal and external
counsel.
"What I envision is that a year
from now, that inside and outside
people will sit around a table and
there will be ... a seamless rela
tionship," he said.

progresses, some have started to
question the actual savings such a
change would provide. Another
individual close to the office said
that while cost-reductions were
touted as the major reason for the
change a few weeks ago, the focus
has currently shifted to "expertise
and elasticity" — Roster's catch
phrase for the ability to quickly

move legal resources from one area
to another.
"The bottom line has become a
moving target," the source said.
"The savings will be questionable."
Several people familiar with the
office have questioned whether an
outside firm can, over the long run,
provide the University with the
same level and quality of service
the current staff provides.
As part of any restructuring
plan, University departments will
also be asked to reduce their legal
needs as much as possible, the
source said. "They'll have to be
especially careful now when doing
things like terminating people."
Ultimately, Roster hopes the
process will establish a new way to
provide legal services to the Uni
versity by eliminating the barriers
between internal and external
counsel.
"What I envision is that a year
from now, that inside and outside
people will sit around a table and
there will be ... a seamless rela
tionship," he said.
