amounts of the University's legal work to
outside firms, several individuals close to
the office said yesterday.
But General Counsel Michael Roster,
who said all 12 firms that expressed inter

ily Practice Program and the Medical
School, were also accepted. Law firms could
submit bids for any or all of these options.
All three options will involve layoffs of
some University attorneys and support
