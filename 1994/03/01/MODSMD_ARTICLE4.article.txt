## 
### Josh Gohlke Staff writer 
A new administrator could oversee the
quality of undergraduate education if a
proposal discussed at yesterday's meeting
of the Commission on Undergraduate edu
cation is adopted.
In CUE's third meeting of the quarter,
convened to decide on a general outline for
their final report to University President
Gerhard Casper, the commission discussed
possibly creating an administrative posi

tion charged with supervising undergradu
ate education throughout the University's
academic schools, according to Law Prof.
Robert Weisberg, a commission member.
Although there was a consensus on the
need for such a figure — "a person whose
responsibility is the quality of undergradu
ate education" — there is not yet agree
ment on the details of the position, said
commission member David Lowell, a grad
uate student in engineering.
