A new administrator could oversee the
quality of undergraduate education if a
proposal discussed at yesterday's meeting
of the Commission on Undergraduate edu
cation is adopted.
In CUE's third meeting of the quarter,
convened to decide on a general outline for
their final report to University President
Gerhard Casper, the commission discussed
possibly creating an administrative posi

tion charged with supervising undergradu
ate education throughout the University's
academic schools, according to Law Prof.
Robert Weisberg, a commission member.
Although there was a consensus on the
need for such a figure — "a person whose
responsibility is the quality of undergradu
ate education" — there is not yet agree
ment on the details of the position, said
commission member David Lowell, a grad
uate student in engineering.
There was further agreement
that the position would have to
include some sort of financial
power, with which the adminis
trator could reward departments
contributing more to undergrad
uate education, Weisberg said.
"This position can have no
meaning without budgetary
power," he said.
He cited "giving departments
the [teaching assistants] they
want" as one example of incen
tives to participate in advising
and other aspects of undergradu
ate education.
Commission members also
spoke of the need for financing
in general, Weisberg said. They

discussed the fact that the Uni
versity will have to divert money
toward undergraduate pro
grams if real change is to take
place.
"The University is going to
have to pay for undergraduate
education," Weisberg said.
The commission also got to
the main item on their agenda,
deciding what issues to address
in their final report, commission
chair and History Prof. James
Sheehan said.
"We talked today about the
overall shape of the report,"
Sheehan said. "I think we've now
come to an agreement on what
the main topics will be."
One section of the report will
address the issue of governance
that figured prominently in the
discussion yesterday. Another
section will be devoted to "the

goals of undergraduate educa
tion in a very broad sense," Low
ell said.
The report will also address
the seven topics which have com
mission subcommittees devoted
to them. Some of the subcommit
tees will turn in their final
reports to the commission at the
next meeting, scheduled for
March 14, although other sub
committees will not be ready
until later, Sheehan said.
The report will also have a
section devoted to praising the
better aspects of current under
graduate education, Sheehan
said, mentioning the overseas
studies and honors programs as
examples.
"The report is not only going
to suggest changes, but it will
also highlight what we think
works," he said.
