# Project founder speaks on AIDS

### Kyle Graham Staff writer 
Jeff Phillips, a former Stan
ford master's student, died of
AIDS in 1985. Phillips might
have remained just another of the
more than 200,000 American vic
tims of AIDS, if not for the effect
his life — and death — had on
fellow Graduate School of Busi
ness student Michael Smith.
Smith, who spoke before an
audience of approximately 100 in
Bishop Auditorium yesterday af
ternoon, now recalls the "extra
ordinary impact" Phillips' pass
ing had on him. Eventually,
Smith's grief would be channeled
into the NAMES Project's AIDS
Memorial Quilt, three panels of
which are now on display at the
Business School.
Smith co-founded the quilt
