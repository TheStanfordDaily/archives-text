# Project founder speaks on AIDS
## 
### Kyle Graham Staff writer 
Jeff Phillips, a former Stan
ford master's student, died of
AIDS in 1985. Phillips might
have remained just another of the
more than 200,000 American vic
tims of AIDS, if not for the effect
his life — and death — had on
fellow Graduate School of Busi
ness student Michael Smith.
Smith, who spoke before an
audience of approximately 100 in
Bishop Auditorium yesterday af
ternoon, now recalls the "extra
ordinary impact" Phillips' pass
ing had on him. Eventually,
Smith's grief would be channeled
into the NAMES Project's AIDS
Memorial Quilt, three panels of
which are now on display at the
Business School.

with Cleve Jones, a politician and
activist. Jones pitched the "crazy"
idea to Smith over dinner in 1987.
By the end of the dinner, "it no
longer seemed crazy; it seemed bril
liant. And it seemed like the right
thing to do," said Smith, a 1986
graduate of the Business School.
"This was a way to communi
cate to the rest of the world what
our neighborhood was living
through," Smith said.
"At that time, and even to this
day, a lot of people in this nation
react with hatred and bigotry
when they hear about AIDS. . . .
Cleve really saw that the quilt was

a way to break through that.
When you think of quilts, you
think of warmth and love and
comfort."
Smith added, "The quilt was
really a Trojan Horse. It was a
way to sneak AIDS into the con
sciousness of the country and
eventually into its conscience."
Recalling the quilt's first days,
Smith spoke of several "chutzpah
related moves" to publicize the pro
ject. One example involved an early
display in San Francisco, where the
idea for the quilt was born and
where the project was based.
At the exhibit, which featured
all 40 original 3-foot by 6-foot
panels, Smith, Jones and others
would tell onlookers, "These are
only 40 of the hundreds of hun
dreds of quilts that we have."

"This would probably be a good
time to say I slept through the
'Truth in Advertising' lecture in
the (Business) School," Smith
said.
Soon after, however, the pro
ject's founders would face little
difficulty in publicizing or expand
ing the quilt. Over a three-day
period in 1987, more than 900
people submitted additions to the
quilt which Smith and fellow vol
unteers sewed and pieced togeth
er.
Since then, the quilt has grown
to over 26,000 panels, and has
toured all 50 states. Further
more, Smith and his fellow pro
ject workers were nominated for
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988
and were the subject of an Acade
my Award-winning HBO docu

mentary in 1990.
Smith marveled at the "magic
of the quilt" to evoke both assis
tance and sentiment, and recalled
stories of volunteers with AIDS
who sewed others' names onto
the quilt, "working on something
that they would become a part
of."
Smith also spoke of mothers
who came to the project head
quarters with the material for
their sons' quilt panels "who
couldn't let go of the fabric, since
letting go of the fabric meant let
ting go of their son."
But Smith said the AIDS quilt
will always be a memorial to his
friend. "Every single time I walk
through the display, I hear Jeff
Phillips' voice ... I hear him say
ing, 'Remember my name.' "
