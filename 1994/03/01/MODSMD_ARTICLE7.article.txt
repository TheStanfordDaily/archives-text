## 
### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
The hunt for a successor to Jim
Larimore, the American Indian
Program director who will step
down by Aug. 1, is finally under
way as Dean of Students Michael
Jackson named the committee
who will conduct the national
search.
"It's a real good committee of
thoughtful faculty, students and
alums who will help us find some

one very good," Jackson said.
After completing its search,
the committee will recommend
three unranked candidates to
Jackson who will make the final
decision.
The search begins more than
four months after Larimore, the di
rector for the past nine years, an
nounced his resignation. The hunt
was delayed after Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds im
posed a hiring freeze, citing budget
cuts.

John Pearson, director of the
Bechtel Center, will chair the
search committee. Other staff
members include Cheryll
Hawthorne-Seawright, assistant
dean in the School of Engineering;
Alejandro Martinez, director of
Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices; and Rick Yuen, Asian-Amer
ican Activities Center director.
Asst. English Prof. Robert Warrior
will serve as the lone faculty mem
ber on the committee.
Junior Anastasia Cooke is the
vice-chair of the search commit
tee. Other student representa
tives are Herman Agoyo, a fresh
man in civil engineering; Victo
ria Bomberry, a modern thought
and literature graduate student;
and Greg Powderface, a student
in the Graduate School of Busi
ness.
Larimore expressed relief that
the search for the next director
has gained momentum, adding
that the University's financial cli
mate shouldn't be a deterrent to
prospective applicants.
"The current budget problems,
thank God, are temporary," Lari
more said, "though there will be a
period of time where we'll have to
go to outside funding (to finance
the Native American community
programming)."
The search committee will aim
to have a replacement named by
mid-May to allow for adequate
training time before Larimore
leaves, Jackson said.
While Larimore said "the
search committee will have to
work pretty hard over the next

couple of months to sort
through all the applications," he
added that the May deadline is
feasible.
Pearson said he was "delight
ed" at the chance to chair the
search committee.
"I'd like to get Icommittee
meetings] going as soon as possi
ble, before the end of the quar
ter," Pearson said, adding that
weekly meetings would likely be
necessary to stay on schedule.
Pearson also had only praise
for Larimore, saying it would be
difficult to find a replacement.
"Jim Larimore is one of a kind,
but what is the likelihood of get
ting another Jim Larimore?"
Pearson asked.
"He's extremely able to syn
thesize lots of discussions and see
where they're headed, but he's
also very willing to say what he
thinks.
"He's a tremendous advocate
for his community," Pearson
added.
Larimore himself is not offi
cially taking part in the search
because, he said, "in some ways,
it's absolutely the wrong thing to
do."
"The community must get
together and decide what direc
tion to lay out for the next couple
of years," he said.
