Stanford Police have arrested a man who alleged
ly defrauded the University by impersonating a stu
dent to obtain free housing in Branner Hall and
Governor's Corner.
Abdelghani Attou, 26, was taken into custody
Friday, said Stanford Police Sgt. John McMullen.
He added that police identified Attou after several
informants came forward about the crime, which oc
curred in late January.
Attou will be charged with two counts of "de
frauding the innkeeper" for allegedly conning Stan

ford employees into allowing him to spend 12 nights
in University housing, McMullen said.
When police went to the Menlo Park home where
Attou was staying, he tried to tell the officers that he
was "Frederick Emerson" from Switzerland, Mc-
Mullen said.
"[Attou] finally admitted to who he was after
talking to him for a bit," McMullen said.
Attou is also alleged to have defrauded other local
housing complexes, including Oak Creek Apart
ments, Welch Road Apartments and Pierce Mitchell
Apartments, McMullen said. He also allegedly wrote
bad checks for housing and bor
rowed money without paying it
back.
The informants who came for
ward were people to whom Attou
allegedly owed money, McMullen
said.
Attou would also loiter on

campus in the Tresidder LaIR
and Sweet Hall computer clus
ters, Crothers Memorial Hall and
the Psychology Department,
according to McMullen. "He
looks like a student and acts like
a student," McMullen said.
"He's been hanging around
for at least a year — maybe
two," McMullen said. "He's one
of the people who try to be affil
iated with Stanford, but never
are."
