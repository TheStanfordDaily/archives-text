## Israel frees Palestinian prisoners Palestinians 'scoff at gesture, say it's not a true step toward peace

HEBRON, Occupied West Bank (AP)
â€” Israel released more than 500 Pales
tinian prisoners yesterday to coax the
PLO back to peace talks suspended alter
the Hebron mosque massacre, and said
another 500 will be freed by the weekend.
Palestinians scoffed at the gesture.
"I think the Israelis are releasing us
now to make the Palestinians happy,"
said freed prisoner Wael Salameh, 38,
when he arrived in Hebron, where
dozens of Muslim worshipers were slain
by a Jewish settler Friday. "This is not a
real step for peace."
That was the PLO line, too. Samir
Ghosheh, a member of the PLO's ruling
Executive Committee, dismissed the
release as "irrelevant to the real issue of
providing protection for our people."
He called it "cosmetic surgery" to
dampen the violence that has swept the

occupied territories and parts of Israel
since Friday's massacre.
The PLO won't resume peace talks
with Israel unless "certain guarantees
are provided" to protect Palestinians liv
ing under occupation, he said.
But, amid intense diplomatic maneu
vering, there were signs that these may
now be forthcoming. Israeli sources were
optimistic that the suspended talks will
resume following Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin's offer of a package of
concessions that go part way toward
meeting PLO demands.
Western and Arab diplomats in
Tunis, Tunisia, the PLO's headquarters,
said Israel's concessions, offered this
week, include strengthening a Palestini
an police force being deployed under the
Sept. 13 PLO-Israeli peace accord in
what will be self-rule areas in Gaza and

the West Bank town of Jericho. Israel
also would disarm settlers in those
areas.
Rabin also offered to allow interna
tional observers into the territories for
the first time since Israel captured them
in the 1967 Mideast War.
The PLO Executive Committee, the
organization's ruling body, rejected the
package early yesterday in Tunis, saying
it did not go far enough, said PLO Exec
utive Committee member Ali Ishak.
The worst stumbling block, said
Ishak, was the offer of observers. The
PLO wants an armed multinational pro
tection force in the occupied lands.
Israeli officials indicated the
observers would be empowered only to
supervise Israel's military withdrawal
from Gaza and Jericho and oversee the
handover of authority to Palestinians.
