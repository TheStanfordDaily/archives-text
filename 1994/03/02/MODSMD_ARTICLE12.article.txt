## Editorial Support the Bridge University shouldn't let current problems affect group's valuable service 
### 
After more than 20
years of helping Stanford
students deal with their
problems, the Bridge now has one
of its own: its building.
While weakened by the Loma Pri
eta Earthquake, the Bridge's unas
suming house and adjoining build
ing on Campus Drive East are, more
simply, victims of neglect. Tacitly
deteriorating as a generation of
Stanford students grew and found
strength within their four walls, the
buildings are now in need of major
repairs.
The Bridge has always been inde
pendent of the University financially,
but its house belongs to Stanford.
However, the University has put no
money into the upkeep of the build
ing in recent memory, and the Uni
versity should move quickly to solve
the location problems of such a wor
thy organization as the Bridge.
It's unclear at this point exactly
how the deterioration mil affect the
operations of the Bridge. Depending
on if and when live-in counselors are
evicted, and if and where new space
is found for the service, the Bridge
could either develop into a stronger
counseling service and community,
or it could shrivel into yet another
student program tucked into a back
corner at Cowell Student Health
Center.
Currently, the Bridge provides
many services unavailable anywhere
else at Stanford, including 24-hour
private, personal counseling for
issues as serious as suicide and sexu
al assault to everyday crises like
stress and roommate problems.
In addition, the Bridge is a meet
ing site for numerous support
groups and peer counseling class sec
tions. It is also an information
resource and referral center for a
wide range of problems.

Amazingly, the Bridge is financial
ly self-sufficient, generating all its
operating revenue from its annual
Spring Faire held in White Plaza.
It's not often that a group essen
tially run by students for students
provides such a crucial service to the
University and costs Stanford noth
ing. Given this highly unique feat,
it's now time for Stanford to give a
little back and make sure that struc
tural problems don't amount to
detrimental program changes for
the Bridge.
With the cooperation of the Uni
versity, the displacement of the
Bridge from its current quarters
could actually improve the program.
For example, the program could
move next door to Owen House —
the old Haas Center for Public Ser
vice building.
This house, which is bigger than
the current Bridge, would allow at
least the same number of counselors
to be live-ins while providing more
meeting space.
If there is enough room, other
student groups dealing with such
issues as sexual health, AIDS, sexual
assault or nutrition could conceiv
ably relocate to Owen House as well.
Another possibility that has been
raised is to tie the Bridge to other
health-related student groups and
house all the programs' staffs in one
of the Row houses. While this option
may provide the best physical ameni
ties, the new plans must address
issues of counseling confidentiality.
While either of the above options
could possibly augment the services
of the Bridge, there is one scenario
that must be rejected outright: locat
ing the Bridge in a building that is
only open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The
Bridge is an all-hours place — that is
one of its greatest assets — and this
feature must be preserved.
To this point, University adminis
trators have appeared supportive of
the Bridge and concerned about its
possible displacement, relocation
and general future.
Hopefully, positive words now will
translate into meaningful actions
later, when the Bridge is forced to
move.
