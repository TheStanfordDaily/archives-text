## The 						next cosmetic evolution 
### 
And the Lord God caused a deep sleep
to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he
took one of his ribs, and closed up the
flesh instead thereof;
And the rib, which the Lord God has
taken from man, made he a woman.
— Genesis 2:21
SOMETHING WENT awry between
those days and the present. Maybe
it was those darn Victorians, but
somehow, we found ourselves in a society
when slightly less skilled surgeons are
taking ribs out of women for slightly less
justifiable reasons.
Yeah, yeah, I know Tori Spelling did it,
along with her breast implants and nose
job, and doesn't her waist look so svelte,
so feminine? If cosmetic surgery can
enlarge breasts, tuck tummies and vacu
um up pesky fat cells, what's to stop
them from lopping out a few extraneous
ribs here and there?
I thought we had come up with every
trick possible to manipulate our appear
ances. Between cheekbone implants and
liquid diets, I really thought I had seen it
all. But to me, the idea of rib removal
seems to tamper with something even
more sacred than stores of childbearing
fat on female hips.
I mean, we are talking about basic
skeletal structure here — bones, for
God's sake, are not meant to be removed.
There's a reason why after cycles upon
cycles of evolution we all have 24 ribs, no

more, no less. Natural selection has
decided that 24 is a nice, well-rounded
number of ribs to have. Call me a purist,
but I'm inclined to leave well enough
alone.
So why has a small money-making
segment of our population decided that
chucking the last couple of rows on their
ribcages should be as easy as trimming
split ends? I am truly and sincerely dis
turbed. And my sides are aching a little
from the mere thought of an undoubted
ly excruciating surgical process.
What do they do with the ribs anyway?
Do they hand them to you in a container
— like they do with tonsils and wisdom
teeth — that says "My 23rd and 24th
ribs"? Can you mount them on your wall
like antlers, as a momento of your less
thin-waisted days? Maybe they can auc
tion off Tori Spelling's ribs for charity.
It should not be necessary to say that
there is something incredibly unhealthy
about a society that encourages this kind
of bodily mutilation, that sees ribs as an
expendable obstacle to ideal beauty. The
tyranny of impossible standards of beau
ty has been rightfully attacked many a
time. But in the end, the women (and a
few men) who choose to have their bodies
surgically altered make-the decision.
Why?
Essentially, we are control freaks to
the extreme, and what better place to
start exerting mastery over your domain
than your physical being? The anorexic

or bulimic behaves in a certain way not
only to look thin, but also to exert control
over their bodies, and thus their lives.
Cosmetic surgery is the control freak's
dream — instant, drastic alteration to
your expectations.
In cosmetic surgery we have found
the means to battle the very things that
most threaten our complete dominion
over our bodies. And in this glorious day
and age for women, the root of all evil is,
unfortunately, a female secondary sex
characteristic — fat, that disgusting,
oozing barrier between Rubens-esque
roundness and Kate Moss-ian emacia
tion. It's self-loathing turned self
destructive.
When dieting and vacuuming every
fat cell out of extinction isn't enough,
then we resort to hacking up our skele
tons. Hey, think of all that weight you
lose when those heavy ribs are taken out
— better than a month on Slim Fast.
And just imagine, if you removed your
pelvis . . . and how narrow your hips
would be. . . .

Angie would like to thank her fellow stu
dents at Stanford-in-Oxford — Camille,
Tina and Clark — who, in the highly aca
demic spirit of the program, sparked the
conversation that inspired this column.
