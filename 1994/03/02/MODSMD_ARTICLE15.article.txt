## Stanford should answer call for Asian American Studies 
### 
"We feel that an Asian American
Studies program would contribute to a
better balance atmosphere for examining
the multiculturality in American society
and lead to broader ethnic implications
for all who participate."
— Asian American Studies Group, 1972
STRUGGLES ARE often measured
in how many lives have passed
devoted to a cause, how many gen
erations have passed fighting to right
some wrong, to reach some ideal. How
many women never saw a voting booth?
How men and women were born into
slavery? If a student's life is four years,
then Stanford has frustrated students
fighting for Asian American Studies for
six generations. The above quote is
selected from a proposal for an Asian
American Studies program over twenty
years ago. It is interesting to note that
ideas and arguments behind Asian Amer
ican Studies from years ago are still valid
and relevant today.
This spring, as the Asian American
Student's Association reaches its 25th
anniversary, Stanford should look back
upon both its history and future with
Asian Americans. Leland Stanford's rail
road fortune was partly built upon the
exploitation of Chinese immigrant labor.
These men came to America for the
fabled Gold Mountain, only to be cheated
out of their dreams and left with the
nightmare of laboring on America's rail
roads. In the early 1900s, Chinese and
Japanese students were forbidden to live
with other Stanford students.
In 1919, Chinese-American students
purchased the Chinese Clubhouse to live
in, after a Chinese student was thrown
out of Encina Hall by its white residents.
Today, the Law School stands over the
site of the Clubhouse and Chinese-Amer
icans live in all of Stanford's dorms.
Today, Asian-Americans of diverse
descents comprise almost 24 percent of
Stanford's undergraduates and 13 per
cent of graduate students.

However, there are no Asian-Ameri
cans on the Commission on Undergradu
ate Education and there are no Asian-
American trustees. There are no Asian-
American administrators in high posi
tions — such as provost or vice provost
— and there are no Asian-American aca
demic deans. Why?
Why does the University recruit and
retain so few Asian-American professors
in the School of Humanities and Sci
ences? The majority of Asian-American
faculty is clustered in the sciences, engi
neering and the Medical School.
Why has Stanford resisted efforts by
students, staff, and faculty members to
establish an Asian American studies pro
gram? Why has Stanford ignored the
University Committee on Minority
Issues report that explicitly called for
more Asian American studies courses?
Why has Stanford ignored a student sur
vey concluding that Stanford students
want an Asian American Studies major?
Stanford's inaction on Asian Ameri
can Studies is as harmful as negative
action. This very inaction threatens to
cost Stanford's only two professors in
Asian American Studies, Gordon Chang
and David Palumbo-Liu. Palumbo-Liu
has been offered a visiting lectureship at
Harvard; in addition, he has been inter
viewed by numerous universities that are
committed to establishing Asian Ameri
can Studies.
Although Chang's immediate plans
include Stanford, he has little incentive
to remain in an environment that is hos
tile to the establishment of Asian Ameri
can Studies when he still holds a tenured
position at University of California at
Irvine.
What should Stanford do?
First, the administration must take
active steps to retain Palumbo-Liu and
Gordon Chang by resolving any and all
contract problems and by making Stan
ford a welcome place for them and their
interest in Asian American Studies.
Second, Stanford should charge a

commission with the duty of reviewing
Asian American Studies. In addition, the
University should investigate the status
of Asian Americans at Stanford: why do
Asian-Americans have apparently so lit
tle political representation at this Uni
versity?
Third, the University should establish
an endowment fund, where donations
from alumni, businesses and communi
ties can be collected to help fund an
Asian American Studies program. With
almost a quarter of the undergraduates
today, Asian-Americans will become a
significant portion of Stanford's alumni
donating pool in the future.
Finally, the School of Humanities and
Sciences should establish an office or
some structure to coordinate faculty
members interested in Asian American
studies. To this end, the school should
support faculty and staff members who
want to teach Asian American studies
classes. Support involves several things.
Departments should free professors
from their teaching requirement and
allow them to teach classes in Asian
American Studies. The Dean of Humani
ties and Sciences should fund more
classes to be taught by staff members
and par-faculty.
Stanford should also continue its
recent efforts to bring visiting scholars
such as Amado Cabezas and Sue Chow to
Stanford. A more defined and permanent
visiting scholar program, perhaps mod
eled after the Chicano fellows program,
would add stability to an Asian American
Studies program.
Finally, support means support. There
is no incentive for professors, especially
untenured junior faculty members, to
teach Asian American Studies if such
efforts are not recognized by the Univer
sity as merit worthy and scholarly.
Stanford has placed its faculty mem
bers in a paradox: it charges the faculty
on to develop an Asian American Studies
program, but then it shows no support or
interest in seeing a program be devel-

oped. Stanford cannot expect to attract
or retain quality scholars if it does not
change its attitude and make this Uni
versity more open towards Asian Ameri
can Studies.
As I argued at the beginning of my let
ter, many of the justifications for Asian
American Studies have not changed over
25 years; likewise, the steps outlined to
develop a program have changed little
over that time. Almost all of the ideas
that I listed above can be found in vari
ous Asian American Studies proposals
from the past two-and-a-half decades.
The call for Asian American Studies has
been a persistent and consistent voice. A
voice coming from students, staff, facul
ty, and alumni. It is time that Stanford
not only listened but answered.
