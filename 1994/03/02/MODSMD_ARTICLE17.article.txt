## Scientist argues new encryption chips violate privacy Government standard would permit decoding of data through court order 
### Bryan Johnson 
Along with the increase in
information exchange which has
taken place in the last decade has
come a growing need for better
security.
Because privacy and authentic
ity in electronic communications
have become major concerns in
today's society, the government
has recently proposed an encryp
tion standard, known formally as
the Escrowed Encryption Stan
dard and popularly as the "Clip
per" chip.
The involvement of govern
ment in the process has caused
many prominent figures in cryp
tography, including Electrical
Engineering Prof. Martin Hell
man, to voice serious reservations
about the Clipper system.
The Clinton administration
has announced that it hopes this
system will become an industry
standard and be the basis for all
commercial encryption systems.
According to the statement,
made last month, the new system
will "enable individuals to trans
act business electronically rather
than having to exchange signed
paper contracts."
The announcement went on to
say that "the administration has
determined that such technology
should not be subject to private
royalty payments, and it will be
taking steps to ensure that royal
ties are not required for use of a
digital signature."
Citing concerns about "terror
ists, drug dealers and other crimi
nals," however, the government
announced that the Clipper sys
tem will contain a way for the gov
ernment to read any message
encrypted with it upon obtaining
a court order.
Because of this feature, com
puter advocacy groups, such as
the Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility (CPSR) and
the Electronic Frontier Founda

tion (EFF), have voiced opinions
against the Clipper chip and cir
culated petitions calling for its
abandonment.
The CPSR petition, in particu
lar, has been signed by thousands
of users on the Internet — an
international computer network
— who fear that this may be a first
step in an effort by the govern
ment to ensure its ability to moni
tor electronic communication.
Developed by the National
Security Agency over the past 10
years, the algorithm which forms
the basis for the Clipper chip is
still classified and thus is not
available for review by most of the
encryption community.
Upon intercepting a transmis
sion which had been encoded
using a Clipper chip, a law
enforcement agency could present
the chip's serial number to two
escrow agencies and receive a key
to that chip, allowing them to
read the coded message.
According to Hellman, the
problem is that the NSA "wants
to protect American communica
tions from foreign espionage but
it wants to keep foreign communi
cations open to American espi
onage."
Hellman has had disputes with
the government over cryptogra
phy before, dating back to 1975
when the National Bureau of
Standards, now the National
Institute for Standards and Tech
nology (NIST), first proposed the
Digital Encryption System. That
system, in his opinion, was too
weak and potentially breakable.
The administration recently
named the Treasury Department
and NIST as the escrow agents
which will hold the keys to each
chip, rather than impartial agen
cies outside the government,
causing more concern among
those wary of possible abuses of
wiretapping authority.
In addition, while the chip's
adoption would protect many con

versations which are now unen
crypted, Hellman says it might
also set a precedent which would
aid the government in its efforts
to pass Digital Telephony legisla
tion, which seeks to ensure that
as the telephone companies
upgrade their equipment they
maintain law enforcement agen
cies' ability to monitor their
users' activities.
While the government has

announced that Clipper will be a
voluntary standard, many are
concerned that other encryption
methods will be suppressed or
banned to preserve the ability of
law enforcement agencies to read
electronic traffic.
Hellman thinks it is more like
ly that the government will sim
ply use its economic influence to
propagate the chip as a standard,
and "would give them away free"

if they could. Already, the Ameri
can Telephone & Telegraph Co.
has announced that its new tele
phone encryption device will be
Clipper based.
If the government requires busi
nesses dealing with it to use Clip
per, he said that rather than use
two different systems those busi
nesses will most likely use Clipper
for other communication as well.
Devices using the Clipper sys

tem would also be automatically
approved for export. Currently,
anyone exporting a device incor
porating cryptography must first
obtain a license from the govern
ment, which has historically been
reluctant to grant them for pow
erful encryption products. If Clip
per is approved, all other algo
rithms would be denied export,
increasing pressure on business
to use that system.

maintain law enforcement agen
cies' ability to monitor their
users' activities.
While the government has

announced that Clipper will be a
voluntary standard, many are
concerned that other encryption
methods will be suppressed or
banned to preserve the ability of
law enforcement agencies to read
electronic traffic.
Hellman thinks it is more like
ly that the government will sim
ply use its economic influence to
propagate the chip as a standard,
and "would give them away free"

if they could. Already, the Ameri
can Telephone & Telegraph Co.
has announced that its new tele
phone encryption device will be
Clipper based.
If the government requires busi
nesses dealing with it to use Clip
per, he said that rather than use
two different systems those busi
nesses will most likely use Clipper
for other communication as well.
Devices using the Clipper sys

tem would also be automatically
approved for export. Currently,
anyone exporting a device incor
porating cryptography must first
obtain a license from the govern
ment, which has historically been
reluctant to grant them for pow
erful encryption products. If Clip
per is approved, all other algo
rithms would be denied export,
increasing pressure on business
to use that system.
