The Clipper chip, based on the government's
proposed Escrowed Encryption Standard
(EES), is the physical chip for use with tele
phone communications. It is based on a mathe
matical algorithm known as Skipjack, which
has been developed by the National Security
Agency.
Conventional encryption, including both the
Digital Encryption Standard (DES) and EES,
works by encoding a message using a particular
key — a string of data bits which is also
required to decipher the message on the other
end. While a DES key consists of 50 bits, those
in EES are longer, at 80 bits, and thus the sys
tem is in theory harder to break.
Where DES works with a single key, the EES
system contains three different keys for each
Clipper chip. These are a session key, which is
different for every transmission; a unit key,
which is unique to each different chip; and a
system key, which is the same for every chip.
For each transmission, the message is first
encoded using the session key and this data is
sent as the first part of the message. The ses
sion key is then encoded using the unit key. In
addition to the chip's serial number, this data is
encoded using the system key and sent as the
second part of the transmission.
For the receiver to decode the transmission,
it would simply employ the session key and then
use that information to decode the actual data.
However, a law enforcement agency wanting
to decrypt a Clipper transmission could use the
system key to get the chip's serial number. The
agency could get a court order for the appropriate
unit key and use it to decipher the session key,
which would then be used to read the message.
