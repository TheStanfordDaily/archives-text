Why do men have nipples ?
— Anonymous
A: You may not believe this, but evolu
tion has maintained the male nipple
solely for the purpose of piercing. It seems
there was a tribe of early humans in which
only those males who had nipples, who
pierced said nipples and who proceeded to
hang bright shiny objects from aforemen
tioned nipples managed to attract mates. . .
OK, I bet you saw right through that one.
The answer to this week's query does have
something to do with evolution, but it's
nowhere near as straightforward as the cock
and-bull story I was trying to force-feed you in
the previous paragraph.
Male nipples are vestigial, which is Mock
Latin for "useless." A vestige is an imperfectly
developed or degenerate structure that
appears either during embryonic development
or in an adult animal. Although vestigia don't
serve any real purpose by the time they merit
that name, embryologists and evolutionary
biologists often look to such useless structures
for clues about previous functions.
Good examples of informative vestigia are
the tiny hind legs of whales (which support the
theory that the ancestors of whales lived on
land at one point), and the embryonic tails of
higher primates (which support the theory
that we used to swing from trees eating bugs
out of one another's armpits).
Male nipples, however, are less indicative of
an ancestral form than of developmental
necessity. The body plan of mammals is basi
cally female, as evidenced by glamorous
transvestite model RuPaul and films such as
"The Crying Game."
During the early stages of development, the
sex of a human embryo can't be determined by
visual inspection. Two sets of primordia (prim
itive tissues which later form other, more
mature tissues) — the Wolffian and Mullerian
ducts — exist simultaneously.
In the absence of the working testis of a
male, the Wolffian duct atrophies, and the
Mullerian duct goes on to form the Fallop
ian tubes, uterus, and the upper third of
the vagina.

If a properly functioning testis is present,
on the other hand, the Mullerian duct atro
phies and the Wolffian ducts rises to the occa
sion to form the vas deferens (the tube that
carries sperm away from the testicles) and
other components of the traditional male
plumbing.
Kids, the point here is this: vas deferens or
no vas deferens, there's not a vast difference
between male and female bodies. Both have to
develop from the same basic plan, and many
parts of the embryo serve related but altered
functions in the two sexes.
At puberty, female humans must produce
functional mammary glands from whatever
starting materials are present. Mammary
glands, or "breasts" as they're Killed by men
hoping to avoid upsetting women who don't
like the sound of the word "titties" or "gazon
gas," aren't just fatty protrusions.
A complicated structure of ducts leads from
the mammary gland to the nipple. The nipple
itself is chock full of nerves; these nerves trans
late tactile stimulation (as from suckling,
fondling or even pinching) into hormonal sig
nals that regulate menstruation, sexual
responsiveness and — of course — the produc
tion of milk.
The bottom line is this: Because the nipples
are complicated structures, and because ner
vous development ceases very early in life (well
before puberty), it's more economical for all
humans to form fairly decent nipples during
embryonic development — which women
improve upon during puberty — than it would
be for males to have no nipples and females to
have to grow all the ducts, nerves and what
have-you while going through the rest of
puberty. As if getting your first period weren't
traumatic enough.
An interesting consequence of this efficient
approach to nipple development is that some
men have well-formed mammary glands and
have even been known to produce milk. As
with lactating women, such men can be
induced to eject milk from the nipples by per
sistent genital stimulation.
I just thought that would be something
you'd really want to hear about.
