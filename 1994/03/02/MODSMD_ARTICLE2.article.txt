# Housed sororities still in the works

### Julie Sauer Staff writer 
The University may be moving toward
finalizing a proposal for the possibility of
sorority housing, according to a draft
prepared by the Office of Student Affairs.
But Greek representatives and Uni
versity administrators say implementa
tion of the policy is still at least a year
away.
According to Jessica Schulman, presi

dent of the Intersorority Council, the
proposal — currently being drafted by
the Office of Student Affairs in consulta
tion with Greek leaders — is still only a
"working model."
"It's still in the first stage of approval,
and ... it still has to go through so many
levels," Schulman said.
However, Schulman said she hopes
the plan will be completed by the time she
leaves office, after Sorority Rush this
spring. She speculated that even if a pro

posal is hammered out, it would not go
into effect immediately but would be put
into place "within a few years."
Dean of Students Michael Jackson ad
mitted that a proposal for restructuring
Greek housing is under consideration.
But he added that no plans have been fi
nalized, saying, "I don't anticipate any
immediate change in housing."
According to Fraternal Affairs Ad vis-
er Heather Dunn, it is difficult to
predict the time frame for imple
menting the proposal, because
the needs of the University, the
students and the future of stu
dent housing must be examined.
"There are no facilities identi
fied yet," she said, adding that
while she is currently helping to
draft the proposal, "we're not
ready to take it on the road yet."
The proposal — which has been
the subject of active discussion and
drafting since October — states
that the number of designated
Greek houses would be increased

from nine to a maximum of 12 and
that sororities as well as unhoused
fraternities would be eligible for
the residences.
Though the number of men's
and women's housed groups
would ideally reflect the campus'
student population percentages, a
present draft of the proposal
states that "no men's organization
shall be removed from a house for
the sole purpose of achieving the
equilibrium between the sexes."
Even so, the proposal would
not necessarily give priority for
any available houses to the 12
fraternities currently eligible for
housing. At the moment, nine
fraternities are housed.
This would be a departure
from the current policy that

excludes sororities from Univer
sity housing.
The houses would be awarded
to groups based on their ability to
fill the house, financial stability
and level of alumni support.
Senior Will Porteous, presi
dent of un-housed fraternity
Sigma Nu, said there is substan
tial interest for increased Greek
housing among some unhoused
fraternities.
Schulman said she believes the
move to housed sororities would
increase fairness in University
housing by calling attention to
current inequities in the spring
housing lottery, which does not
take into account the number of
men who are exempt because
they are in housed fraternities.
