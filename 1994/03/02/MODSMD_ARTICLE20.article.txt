# Climate control may fix environment
## Scientist discusses possibilities, ramifications for new technology 
### Sara Bhargava 
Since ancient times, conjurers
and magicians have been said to con
trol the weather for their own pur
poses.
But today, for the first time, it is
scientists and engineers who may
design schemes to alter the course of
nature.
Scientists have actually already
come up with designs, such as creat
ing Saturn-like rings around the
earth, to help block solar radiation
and alleviate problems like the dry
ing up of the Mediterranean to
recover huge areas of fertile land.
As ridiculous as these plans might
seem, they and others like them
were and are being seriously consid
ered by institutions such as the
National Academy of Science as a
means of reversing global warming.
Stephen Schneider, a professor of
biological sciences, has long been
outspoken on the issue of altering
the climate. "How much risk do you
want to take with the earth," he
said, warning that the unpredictable
consequences of such climate engi
neering could be potentially disas
trous.
Schneider claims that the possi
ble adverse effects from tampering
with the climate are quite likely.
The most important thing to keep in
mind, he says, is that scientists real
ly don't know and are presently in
no position to predict the conse
quences of such alterations.
"Inadvertent modification is not
necessarily bad," he said. "It's a
gambling game.
"To tamper with a system that
determines the livelihood and
lifestyles of people the world over
would be the height of irresponsibil
ity if we could not foresee the out
come," Schneider wrote in a paper
he presented last week to the Amer
ican Association for the Advance
ment of Science.
The major problem is that even if
some workable design were found, it
is highly unlikely that it would have
a uniform positive effect across the
entire Earth. "We could still con
front the agonizing decision about
whose climate should be preserved,
whose improved, and whose sacri
ficed," he wrote in a book titled The
Genesis Strategy.
The range of uncertainty in the
outcomes of geoengineering is mild
to catastrophic, Schneider said.
Though industry claims that the
risk is at the lower end of the spec
trum, groups like Greenpeace have a
far more pessimistic viewpoint and

fear taking any risk at all.
"I fear more potentially a rapid
change in the environment than I
fear what it does to the coal indus
try," he said. "The burden of proof is
on those who are concerned, not on
the polluters. Why isn't the earth
innocent until proven guilty?"
This problem is compounded by
the fact that geoengineering seems
to be the easiest solution to the envi
ronmental problems brought on by
the industrial age. Changing society
from a fossil fuel base to something
more environmentally friendly
would be expensive and very diffi
cult.

'I fear more potentially a
rapid change in the
environment than I fear
what it does to the coal
industry..., The burden
of proof is on those who
are concerned, not on
the polluters. Why isn't
the earth innocent until
proven guilty?'

"It's all well and good that you
should tell us that society should
change its way . . . but you must
admit that it's not likely to happen,"
Schneider said.
Since the last ice age over 5,000
years ago, the Earth's temperature
has risen five degrees Celsius.
Through this natural climactic shift
— amounting to about one degree
every thousand years — ecosystems
and species have come and gone.
The effects of global warming due to
pollutants will be much more dras
tic.
"We are looking at a one degree
increase per century if 1 we're 1 lucky
and possibly even five to ten degrees
of inadvertent climate modifica
tion," Schneider warned. The
results of this change could be disas
trous for life on this planet.
If society won't alter its behavior,
the only chance we have is to reverse
the damage through a massive cli
mate engineering effort, he added.
Schneider was a member of the
National Academy of Science panel
which reviewed various climate

change options two years ago. The
group concluded that at least two of
the schemes had a possibility for
success.
Both involve decreasing the
amount of solar radiation which
would reach the Earth. One requires
seeding clouds to provide more cover
over the ocean, while the other
would employ naval guns to shoot
dust into the stratosphere. The lat
ter effort would offset about one
watt per square meter of global
warming from the greenhouse
effect.
According to Schneider, the
greatest obstacle to this type of
undertaking is definitely not acquir
ing the technology.
In this case the technical prob
lems are "formidable but surmount
able," he said. Instead, the world
wide cooperation required over an
extended period of time would be the
most difficult task.
"Even the possible side effects are
more surmountable than the politi
cal aspects," Schneider said, who is
also a professor at the Institute for
International Studies.
Such an effort would require
"unprecedented cooperation and
trust," he said. "What chance is
there of that over 100 years?"
Another major problem would be
the placement of blame for any nat
ural disaster that occurred after any
geoengineering scheme was put into
effect, Schneider said. Any drought
in Africa or flood in India might be
thought of as the result of tamper
ing with climate.
In addition, the technology could
be misused in political conflicts, he
said. Given the nature of humans,
large-scale climate warfare is by no
means out of the question.
Searching for solutions to these
problems, Schneider said that soci
ety must create "a more rapid imple
mentation of energy-efficient tech
nologies, wildlife habitat protection,
commodity pricing that reflects the
potential for modified environ
ment."
These are "the kind of lasting
measures that can cure [our] 'addic
tion' to polluting practices without
the side effects of geoengineering,"
he said.
"Rather than pin our hopes on
the gamble that geoengineering will
prove both inexpensive and benign,"
Schneider said. "I'd prefer to start
to lower the human impact on the
Earth through less exotic means —
even if I do reluctantly agree that
the study of geoengineering poten
tial is probably needed."

seem, they and others like them
were and are being seriously consid
ered by institutions such as the
National Academy of Science as a
means of reversing global warming.
Stephen Schneider, a professor of
biological sciences, has long been
outspoken on the issue of altering
the climate. "How much risk do you
want to take with the earth," he
said, warning that the unpredictable
consequences of such climate engi
neering could be potentially disas
trous.
Schneider claims that the possi
ble adverse effects from tampering
with the climate are quite likely.
The most important thing to keep in
mind, he says, is that scientists real
ly don't know and are presently in
no position to predict the conse
quences of such alterations.
"Inadvertent modification is not
necessarily bad," he said. "It's a
gambling game.
"To tamper with a system that
determines the livelihood and
lifestyles of people the world over
would be the height of irresponsibil
ity if we could not foresee the out
come," Schneider wrote in a paper
he presented last week to the Amer
ican Association for the Advance
ment of Science.
The major problem is that even if
some workable design were found, it
is highly unlikely that it would have
a uniform positive effect across the
entire Earth. "We could still con
front the agonizing decision about
whose climate should be preserved,
whose improved, and whose sacri
ficed," he wrote in a book titled The
Genesis Strategy.
The range of uncertainty in the
outcomes of geoengineering is mild
to catastrophic, Schneider said.
Though industry claims that the
risk is at the lower end of the spec
trum, groups like Greenpeace have a
far more pessimistic viewpoint and

fear taking any risk at all.
"I fear more potentially a rapid
change in the environment than I
fear what it does to the coal indus
try," he said. "The burden of proof is
on those who are concerned, not on
the polluters. Why isn't the earth
innocent until proven guilty?"
This problem is compounded by
the fact that geoengineering seems
to be the easiest solution to the envi
ronmental problems brought on by
the industrial age. Changing society
from a fossil fuel base to something
more environmentally friendly
would be expensive and very diffi
cult.

'I fear more potentially a
rapid change in the
environment than I fear
what it does to the coal
industry..., The burden

are concerned, not on
the polluters. Why isn't
the earth innocent until

"It's all well and good that you
should tell us that society should
change its way . . . but you must
admit that it's not likely to happen,"
Schneider said.
Since the last ice age over 5,000
years ago, the Earth's temperature
has risen five degrees Celsius.
Through this natural climactic shift
— amounting to about one degree
every thousand years — ecosystems
and species have come and gone.
The effects of global warming due to
pollutants will be much more dras
tic.
"We are looking at a one degree
increase per century if 1 we're 1 lucky
and possibly even five to ten degrees
of inadvertent climate modifica
tion," Schneider warned. The
results of this change could be disas
trous for life on this planet.
If society won't alter its behavior,
the only chance we have is to reverse
the damage through a massive cli
mate engineering effort, he added.
Schneider was a member of the
National Academy of Science panel
which reviewed various climate

change options two years ago. The
group concluded that at least two of
the schemes had a possibility for
success.
Both involve decreasing the
amount of solar radiation which
would reach the Earth. One requires
seeding clouds to provide more cover
over the ocean, while the other
would employ naval guns to shoot
dust into the stratosphere. The lat
ter effort would offset about one
watt per square meter of global
warming from the greenhouse
effect.
According to Schneider, the
greatest obstacle to this type of
undertaking is definitely not acquir
ing the technology.
In this case the technical prob
lems are "formidable but surmount
able," he said. Instead, the world
wide cooperation required over an
extended period of time would be the
most difficult task.
"Even the possible side effects are
more surmountable than the politi
cal aspects," Schneider said, who is
also a professor at the Institute for
International Studies.
Such an effort would require
"unprecedented cooperation and
trust," he said. "What chance is
there of that over 100 years?"
Another major problem would be
the placement of blame for any nat
ural disaster that occurred after any
geoengineering scheme was put into
effect, Schneider said. Any drought
in Africa or flood in India might be
thought of as the result of tamper
ing with climate.
In addition, the technology could
be misused in political conflicts, he
said. Given the nature of humans,
large-scale climate warfare is by no
means out of the question.
Searching for solutions to these
problems, Schneider said that soci
ety must create "a more rapid imple
mentation of energy-efficient tech
nologies, wildlife habitat protection,
commodity pricing that reflects the
potential for modified environ
ment."
These are "the kind of lasting
measures that can cure [our] 'addic
tion' to polluting practices without
the side effects of geoengineering,"
he said.
"Rather than pin our hopes on
the gamble that geoengineering will
prove both inexpensive and benign,"
Schneider said. "I'd prefer to start
to lower the human impact on the
Earth through less exotic means —
even if I do reluctantly agree that
the study of geoengineering poten
tial is probably needed."
Since ancient times, conjurers
and magicians have been said to con
trol the weather for their own pur
poses.
But today, for the first time, it is
scientists and engineers who may
design schemes to alter the course of
nature.
Scientists have actually already
come up with designs, such as creat
ing Saturn-like rings around the
earth, to help block solar radiation
and alleviate problems like the dry
ing up of the Mediterranean to
recover huge areas of fertile land.
As ridiculous as these plans might
seem, they and others like them
were and are being seriously consid
ered by institutions such as the
