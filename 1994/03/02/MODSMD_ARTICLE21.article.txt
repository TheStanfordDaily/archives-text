## A 						wrestling legacy Following in their fathers' footsteps, Jay Jackson and Lance Johnson build on a life-long friendship 
### Allygon Mizoguchi Staff writer 
Thank goodness for fate.
If it hadn't been for Lance John
son's dad, Jay Jackson's parents
would have never met. If they
hadn't met, then Jackson wouldn't
be around, and the Stanford
wrestling program would be miss
ing one of its most vital athletes.
Fate is definitely the best word
to use to understand the relation
ship between Johnson and Jack
son, co-captains of the Cardinal
wrestling team. It's been said that
history repeats itself, and in the
case of these two friends and team
mates, the saying couldn't be more
accurate.
The story begins a generation
ago, when Jackson's and Johnson's
fathers were best friends at
Franklin High School in Portland,
Ore. Paul Jackson and Ron John
son wrestled throughout high
school, and both went on to com
pete for the University of Washing
ton.
At Washington, the two men
were co-captains of the team. They
were roommates and fraternity
brothers. They lined each other up
on dates. They went to each other's
weddings. They both had three
children.
Uncannily, Johnson and Jack

son seem to be reliving the college
years their fathers experienced.
Although Johnson and Jackson
grew up in different states (John
son in Portland, and Jackson just
outside of Seattle), the two wres
tled throughout high school, win
ning their respective state champi
onships in the same year.
Like their fathers, both ended
up at the same college, and now the
two are roommates, fraternity
brothers, and share the responsi
bility of being co-captains for the
Cardinal team.
The two also share an intense
love for wrestling that overrules all
other sports they have tried.
"It's the greatest sport. You put
two guys together without any
equipment and let them go at it,"
said Jackson. "It's like physical
chess — there's a lot of strategy."
Johnson emphasized the total
wrestling lifestyle as his primary
reason for wrestling. "It's the
intensity of the competition, the
pure athleticism that draws you to
it,"he said.
Both chose Stanford for the
same reasons: academics, location,
and wrestling. "And I had Lance
here, so I had a built-in wrestling
partner," Jackson added.
While their similarities seem
unceasing, the two have their dif
ferences beneath the surface. Iron

ically, these differences are primar
ily manifested on the wrestling
mats. The ways the two approach
matches, for instance, are practi
cally opposite.
"I get myself into a rage," said
Jackson. "I tell myself to be mean
and nasty.... I need to prepare
that kind of mentality."
Johnson, on the other hand,
takes the more passive approach.
"I just try to relax a lot, focus on
technique, and concentrate," he
said.
Their wrestling styles may be
applied to their individual person
alities as well. Outside the
wrestling room, Jackson said he is
less likely to take a dare than John
son is. As it pertains to wrestling,
Jackson describes himself as more
conservative — "I need to be more
like Lance and take risks more," he
said.
However, Johnson said he
wants to keep his risktaking under
control, as he finds himself going
for the more gutsy moves even
when he shouldn't.
Their separate interests apart
from wrestling reveal more about
them as individuals. Jackson is a
talented artist, while Johnson likes
to hit the slopes and the waves to
snowboard or surf.

Junior Jay Jackson, in front, and senior Lance Johnson have been wrestling together nearly since birth.
Like their fathers who also wrestled together, the two are roommates and fraternity brothers.
"Lance is a thrill-seeker, and
that's one of the things that
makes him such a great athlete,"
said head coach Chris Horpel.
"He believes that crazy things
are normal."
Now that the regular
wrestling season is over, Johnson
and Jackson have different goals
for the immediate future. Jack
son, a junior, qualified for
NCAAs this past weekend at the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships at 134 pounds, and is
completely focused on the next
couple of weeks of training.
Johnson, a senior, found less for

tune at Pac-lOs and was unable
to qualify at 142 pounds because
of a variety of injuries he has suf
fered since Christmas, ending his
Cardinal career on a less than
perfect note.
"I had a lot of fun this year,
and a lot of heartbreaks too,"
said Johnson. After a torn ham
string and a knee operation, he
feels fortunate he was able to
keep competing.
"I lost a lot of mobility [to
wrestle], but I still have no
regrets about anything that hap
pened," he said.
Johnson is the only senior on
the team this year, and after
graduation he looks to complete
his masters degree in civil engi
neering, find a job and, of course,
continue to train for upcoming

tournaments and possibly the
Olympics.
"Lance has been a lot of fun to
have around. He's a buddy as
well as a great athlete to coach,"
said Horpel. "He is a leader by
example — he earned a lot of
respect by what he was able to do
despite all his injuries."
Jackson, who led the team this
season with a record of 23-10 as
of last weekend's Pac-10 Champi
onships, looks forward to improv
ing his technique next season and
getting more experience.
According to Horpel, Jack
son's mental toughness and dis
ciplined training style make him
a very intense athlete. "He likes
being the lone warrior," said
Horpel. "He's got an intensity
that goes beyond wrestling."

Jackson. "I tell myself to be mean
and nasty.... I need to prepare
that kind of mentality."
Johnson, on the other hand,
takes the more passive approach.
"I just try to relax a lot, focus on
technique, and concentrate," he
said.
Their wrestling styles may be
applied to their individual person
alities as well. Outside the
wrestling room, Jackson said he is
less likely to take a dare than John
son is. As it pertains to wrestling,
Jackson describes himself as more
conservative — "I need to be more
like Lance and take risks more," he
said.
However, Johnson said he
wants to keep his risktaking under
control, as he finds himself going
for the more gutsy moves even
when he shouldn't.
Their separate interests apart
from wrestling reveal more about
them as individuals. Jackson is a

to hit the slopes and the waves to

Junior Jay Jackson, in front, and senior Lance Johnson have been wrestling together nearly since birth.
Like their fathers who also wrestled together, the two are roommates and fraternity brothers.
"Lance is a thrill-seeker, and
that's one of the things that
makes him such a great athlete,"
said head coach Chris Horpel.
"He believes that crazy things
are normal."
Now that the regular
wrestling season is over, Johnson
and Jackson have different goals
for the immediate future. Jack
son, a junior, qualified for
NCAAs this past weekend at the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships at 134 pounds, and is
completely focused on the next
couple of weeks of training.
Johnson, a senior, found less for

tune at Pac-lOs and was unable
to qualify at 142 pounds because
of a variety of injuries he has suf
fered since Christmas, ending his
Cardinal career on a less than
perfect note.
"I had a lot of fun this year,
and a lot of heartbreaks too,"
said Johnson. After a torn ham
string and a knee operation, he
feels fortunate he was able to
keep competing.
"I lost a lot of mobility [to
wrestle], but I still have no
regrets about anything that hap
pened," he said.
Johnson is the only senior on
the team this year, and after
graduation he looks to complete
his masters degree in civil engi
neering, find a job and, of course,
continue to train for upcoming

tournaments and possibly the
Olympics.
"Lance has been a lot of fun to
have around. He's a buddy as
well as a great athlete to coach,"
said Horpel. "He is a leader by
example — he earned a lot of
respect by what he was able to do
despite all his injuries."
Jackson, who led the team this
season with a record of 23-10 as
of last weekend's Pac-10 Champi
onships, looks forward to improv
ing his technique next season and
getting more experience.
According to Horpel, Jack
son's mental toughness and dis
ciplined training style make him
a very intense athlete. "He likes
being the lone warrior," said
Horpel. "He's got an intensity
that goes beyond wrestling."
Thank goodness for fate.
If it hadn't been for Lance John
son's dad, Jay Jackson's parents
would have never met. If they
hadn't met, then Jackson wouldn't
be around, and the Stanford
wrestling program would be miss
ing one of its most vital athletes.
Fate is definitely the best word
to use to understand the relation
ship between Johnson and Jack
son, co-captains of the Cardinal
wrestling team. It's been said that
history repeats itself, and in the
case of these two friends and team
mates, the saying couldn't be more
accurate.
The story begins a generation
ago, when Jackson's and Johnson's
fathers were best friends at
Franklin High School in Portland,
Ore. Paul Jackson and Ron John
son wrestled throughout high
school, and both went on to com
pete for the University of Washing
ton.
At Washington, the two men
were co-captains of the team. They
were roommates and fraternity
brothers. They lined each other up
on dates. They went to each other's
weddings. They both had three
children.
Uncannily, Johnson and Jack

son seem to be reliving the college
years their fathers experienced.
Although Johnson and Jackson
grew up in different states (John
son in Portland, and Jackson just
outside of Seattle), the two wres
tled throughout high school, win
ning their respective state champi
onships in the same year.
Like their fathers, both ended
up at the same college, and now the
two are roommates, fraternity
brothers, and share the responsi
bility of being co-captains for the
Cardinal team.
The two also share an intense
love for wrestling that overrules all
other sports they have tried.
"It's the greatest sport. You put
two guys together without any
equipment and let them go at it,"
said Jackson. "It's like physical
chess — there's a lot of strategy."
Johnson emphasized the total
wrestling lifestyle as his primary
reason for wrestling. "It's the
intensity of the competition, the
pure athleticism that draws you to
it,"he said.
Both chose Stanford for the
same reasons: academics, location,
and wrestling. "And I had Lance
here, so I had a built-in wrestling
partner," Jackson added.
While their similarities seem
unceasing, the two have their dif
ferences beneath the surface. Iron

ically, these differences are primar
ily manifested on the wrestling
mats. The ways the two approach
matches, for instance, are practi
cally opposite.
"I get myself into a rage," said
Jackson. "I tell myself to be mean
and nasty.... I need to prepare
that kind of mentality."
Johnson, on the other hand,
takes the more passive approach.
"I just try to relax a lot, focus on
technique, and concentrate," he
said.
Their wrestling styles may be

alities as well. Outside the

when he shouldn't.
