## Men's swimming revs up for Pac-10s

Is 13 an unlucky number?
Stanford's men's swim team doesn't
think so. Their opinion might not be
shared by the rest of the field, however,
at the Pacific 10 Championship meet
this weekend in Long Beach, Calif. In
shooting for their 13th consecutive con
ference title, the Cardinal will leave the
rest of the Pac-10 in a familiar situation
— battling for second place.
Although the Cardinal has dominat
ed the meet for more than a decade, the
competition should be exciting, as all six
of the participating schools (Stanford,
Cal, Arizona, Arizona State, UCLA and

USC) are ranked in the top 11 in the
nation.
After completing its dual meet sched
ule with a perfect 10-0 record, Stanford
has spent the past couple of weeks taper
ing in their workouts. The majority of
the team will shave down for Pac-lOs,
with many prepared to qualify for
NCAA Championships in late March.
"The taper has been nice," said junior
Clay Tippins. "I'm feeling fast and easy,
light in the water."
Rested and ready, the Cardinal looks
to send a message to the nation's top
teams that they will defend their nation
al title at NCAAs. The outstanding depth
of the squad be exciting in every race.
"In the Pac-lOs, there are six swim

mers in the finals," said Brian Retterer,
a junior. "Sometimes half the field is
wearing Stanford caps. It's great to see
those red suits and Stanford emblems."
Retterer is especially eager to hit the
water in Long Beach, after redshirting
last season due to injury. The last time
he swam at the Pac-10 Championships
in 1992, Retterer set American records
in winning both the 100- and 200-yard
backstrokes.
"I'm very excited. Last year, it was
really hard to watch my events being
swum and not being able to participate,"
he said. "I've been more focused this
year after sitting out a year. I'm excited
to swim again at a champi
onship meet with the team."
Stanford swimmers who
have reached that level include
returning Pac-10 champions

Joe Hudepohl (100 free), Derek
Weatherford (100 and 200
back), Tyler Mayfield (100
breast), Kurt Grote (200 breast)
and Trip Zedlitz (200 individual
medley). The Cardinal also
swept all five relays at last
year's meet, an accomplishment
they hope to duplicate this
weekend.
