# Women's tennis travels to Indoors
## 
### Rob Ross Senior staff writer 
Considering that the Stanford women's tennis team will be
taking its finals in Georgia, it makes sense that the team must
travel halfway there for midterms.
Before traveling to the Peach state for the national champi
onships in May, the No. 2-ranked Cardinal takes to the indoor
courts of the University of Wisconsin at Madison for the United
States Tennis Association/Intercollegiate Tennis Association
Women's National Team Indoor Championships tomorrow
through Sunday. All 16 schools in the tournament are ranked in
the top 25, and 13 of the top 20 players in the country will be in
action over the weekend in Madison.
Stanford stands undefeated at 13-0, with impressive victories
over No. 3 California, No. 8 Arizona State and No. 13 Arizona.
But to repeat as National Indoors champions, the Cardinal must
wade through an imposing collection of top-ranked teams.
No. 1 Texas and Cal both chose to bypass the tourney, but
Nos. 4-8 will be gunning to prevent the top-seeded Cardinal from
winning its fourth National Indoors championship in the tour
nament's seven-year existence.
Stanford's biggest challenge will come from the No. 4-ranked

and second-seeded University of Florida (9-0). Along with the
Cardinal, the Gators have dominated this young tournament,
having won the team title the three years Stanford faltered.
Moreover, of the six finals, five of them pitted the Cardinal
against Florida, with the exception being Stanford's win over
UCLA in 1990.
"I'm really excited to play Florida," said Stanford sophomore
Beth Berris. "They're our national rivals."
Stanford's path to a possible finals matchup against the
Gators is a treacherous one. The team first meets Clemson
tomorrow at 9 a.m. The Tigers, ranked No. 14 nationally, were
thumped by No. 3-ranked Georgia (4-0) last Friday 7-2.
Lead by freshman Angela Lettiere, who is ranked second in
the country, the Bulldogs are a likely semifinal opponent for the
Cardinal assuming Stanford can defeat the Notre Dame-
Brigham Young winner in the round of eight. Last year Stanford
eliminated Georgia in both this tournament and also in the
NCAA National Championship semifinals.
Most of the Stanford players downplay the importance of this
event, pointing rather to the NCAA Championships as the real
test for the squad. But head coach Frank Brennan sees this
weekend's results as potentially affecting seedings at this
squad's "final exam."
