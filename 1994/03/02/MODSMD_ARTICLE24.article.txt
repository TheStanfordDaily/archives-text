# Batters lose to Nevada-Reno
## Wolf Pack chase Cardinal starter after first inning 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
The University of Nevada-Reno baseball
team showed yesterday why it is still unde
feated.
The Wolf Pack pounded out 13 hits and
seven runs to defeat the No. 10 Cardinal 7-
4 before a crowd of 322 at Sunken Dia
mond. The loss dropped Stanford's record
to 12-8 on the season, 2-1 in the Pacific 10
Southern Division, while Nevada-Reno
improved to 6-0.
The Wolf Pack jumped on the score
board early, using three two-out hits in the
first inning and two walks by Cardinal
starter ClifT Kalinowski (0-1) to seize a 3-0
lead and chase Kalinowski after the first
inning.
"(The Stanford pitchersl had good
stuff," said Nevada-Reno shortstop Antho
ny Basoco. "They showed good fastballs
and set their pitches well. We just came
through in key situations."
Nevada-Reno scored again in the second
inning, and Stanford found itself down 4-0.
However, the Cardinal came back in the
bottom of the third with two runs to cut the
lead to 4-2, as third baseman Brian Dal
limore walked and scored on catcher A. J.
Hinch's RBI triple. Hinch then scored
when the throw into third base sailed into

the Wolf Pack dugout.
Stanford got another run in the fourth
inning on a Dallimore sacrifice fly, scoring
freshman Eric Sees to close to within 4-3,
but could get no closer. Nevada-Reno
scored two runs in the sixth and one in the
eighth to ice the game.
"We're up and down with the bats right
now, and today was a down day," said
junior first baseman Dusty Allen. "We had
some good at-bats and a lot of poor ones.
We've just got to get more consistent and
we'll be tough."
Overall, the Cardinal could score only
four runs on seven hits, and were stifled by
the Wolf Pack pitching staff. Freshman
Matt Wells (1-0) entered the game in the
fifth inning in relief of starter Jim Garza,
and snuffed out a Cardinal rally to preserve
a 4-3 lead and pick up the victory.
"[Garza] did a good job in the first couple
of innings," Allen said. "He had us off bal
ance, and he was throwing a lot of change
ups and getting our hitters out front a little
bit. There were a lot of lazy fly balls, and we
just weren't hitting the ball sharply."
Cardinal coach Mark Marquess said the
team needs to be steadier at the plate and
continue pitching well if it hopes to remain
atop the Six-Pac standings.

Shortshop Eric Sees puts the tag on a Wolf Pack runner during yesterday's action at Sunken Diamond. Sees, a fresh
man, pairs with Ail-American candidate Jed Hansen to give the Cardinal solid defense up the middle.
"I don't think we've been con
sistent offensively for any length of
time, which has really been our
problem," Marquess said. "One or
two games we'll play well, and then
we won't swing the bat well at all.
It's always a combination of good
pitching and being consistent I that
is necessary)."
Stanford returns to Six-Pac
action on Friday with a three-game
series against UCLA at Jackie
Robinson Stadium. Despite yester
day's loss, Allen expressed opti
mism about the Cardinal's chances.
"I hope our guys are able to put
this game out of their minds going
into UCLA," Allen said. "We've got
a lead in the [Six-Pac] right now,
and we've got to go down to UCLA
and preserve it."
