# Lichti returns to Bay Area
## Ex-Cardinal overcomes injuries to play again 
### 
Todd Lichti is back in town, and for
those of you on the Farm who are not
familiar with that name, shame on
you.
Lichti, a member of the Cardinal men's
basketball team from 1985-1989, is one of
the most honored players in Stanford histo
ry. His career as a Cardinal culminated in
1989 when he led a Cinderella Stanford
team to its first NCAA Tournament appear
ance in 47 years. However, the circum
stances which led to his return to the Bay
Area are anything but a fairy tale.
Drafted by the Denver Nuggets with the

15th pick overall in the
1989 NBA Draft, Lichti T
looked like a great addition
to a Denver team in transi
tion. His athletic, hard
nosed play seemed a per
fect fit for Paul Westhead's
run-and-gun style. After a
solid rookie season, howev
er, Lichti's life didn't just
take a wrong turn — it
missed the exit entirely.

After numerous physical and emotional
injuries, Lichti has joined the Golden State
Warriors, his third NBA team, for a 10-day
contract — the smallest amount an NBA
team can sign a player to.
In the summer of 1990, after his first
year in the NBA, he was on top of the world.
Although Denver was not a great team by
anyone's imagination, Lichti had made it in
the NBA, a major goal of his and a driving
force in his life, and he was now engaged.
Life must have felt pretty good to him.
All that changed during a routine car trip
from Denver to California with his fiancee.
While driving through Nevada, the car
swerved out of control and crashed, killing
Lichti's fiancee and leaving him with a
severely injured left foot.
Many people would have just hung up
the high-tops after this, but not Lichti. He
fought back from injury to play in 29 games
during the 1990-91 campaign. Just when he
thought he had made it back for good,

though, the nightmare began again when he
jammed his left knee, ending his season.
Struggling to regain his playing form,
Lichti was ready to challenge a deep Nugget
backcourt for playing time in the 1991-92
season. However, this time his unnaturally
bad luck struck before the season even
began. In a preseason game, he tore the pos
terior cruciate ligament on his right knee.
Returning to the Denver lineup in late
November, he rode out the rest of the sea
son injury-free, playing 68 games and aver
aging 8.4 points.
Over the next two years, Lichti was
struck by the injury bug
three more times. On a
cruise, a glass shattered
in his hand, severing a
nerve in his right
thumb. Last January he
strained his left ham
string, seeing action in
less than half of Den
ver's games that year.
The season ended early
for Lichti when he tore
another knee ligament, this time his left
anterior cruciate ligament. On top of all his
injuries, Lichti's house burned down in the
summer of 1992 when he was on vacation in
Australia.
Traded to Orlando last summer, Lichti
was released by the Magic February 23. A
five-year odyssey one would not wish on his
worst enemy has finally brought Lichti back
to the area where he was a star.
As a freshman at Stanford, he quickly
made his presence felt, making the All Pacif
ic Ten Conference team. The tough-as-nails
guard made the All Pac-10 team each of his
four years on the Farm, becoming only the
third person in conference history to accom
plish such a feat. He ended his Stanford
career as the a Cardinal's all-time leading
scorer with 2336 points over 124 games.
Two of his games stand out most in my
memory, both against Arizona and its All-
