# Card sales link GSB and kids
## 'Kidz in Biz' greet Stanford 
### Vivien Wang Staff writer 
Hearts, fireworks and a dog are a few of the sub
jects portrayed on the faces of a set of colorful greet
ing cards being sold by enterprising youths in White
Plaza this week. But perhaps even more colorful are
the card vendors' sales pitches, which vary from rap
ping to assertive self-introductions.
The budding merchants are participating in
"Kidz in Biz," a program that is part of the"I Have a
Dream" partnership between the Graduate School
of Business and the James Flood Technology and
Science Magnet School.
In pairing Business School students with fifth
and sixth graders at the Menlo Park school, the pro

involved in business.
Guckel stressed that "the kids made a lot of the
decisions" and were involved every step of the way to
create the box of 10 cards •— from choosing the de
signs of the cards and visiting the printer to deciding
who their customers would be.
Monnie Edwards, a second-year Business School
student who is also pursuing a master's degree in ed
ucation, helped to develop lesson plans for the
youths. "The kids would come up with examples,
and think about all the questions they wanted to an
swer" to make the business happen, Edwards said.
Guckel said that when the kids are trying to
make a sale, they like to emphasize that each card is
