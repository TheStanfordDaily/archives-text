## Bill requiring senate uniform also proposed 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
To facilitate the Publications Board's
new assumption of old duties, the ASSU
Senate voted last night to put a measure on
the spring election ballot that would almost
triple the board's general fee.
If the amendment is approved by stu

fee will be increased from the current
$53,000 to more than $158,000 to allow the
board's operating budget to account for
maintenance of the Storke Publications
Building and the purchase and mainte
nance of computer equipment.
The senate also passed a measure allow
ing the board to immediately transfer
$13,500 from its reserves to cover this
year's costs in those areas.
The board's general fee recently has

been limited to direct financial support of
various student publications that do not re

Publications Board chair Steve Russell
said that these increases were necessary be
cause the board's budget does not currently
account for equipment purchases and
maintenance though they are within the
board's duties as specified by the ASSU By
laws.
Russell said the board is only now mak
ing a resurgence after a period during
which "it didn't take the active role that it
was supposed to in supporting student pub
lications."

cations Board has been a non-entity," Rus
sell said. "It's making a comeback."
