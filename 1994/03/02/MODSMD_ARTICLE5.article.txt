### Romesh Ratnesar Editorial staff 
Vaclav Havel, the much-admired presi
dent of the Czech Republic who helped or
chestrate the overthrow of Czechoslova
kia's communist government in 1990, will
visit Stanford Sept. 29 to receive the Law
School's Ralston Prize.
While at Stanford, Havel also may deliv
er an open lecture to the University com
munity, according to Law School Dean
Paul Brest.
"It is traditional for the prize winner to
give a public lecture, and possibly speak in
formally as well," Brest said.
Brest said Havel was chosen for the
award — which recognizes significant con
tributions to the promotion of interna
tional peace, justice and development —
"close to a year ago," but formal plans for
Havel's appearance were not finalized

until recently.
Havel was notified of the
honor by the Czech ambas
sador to the United States
during President Clinton's
trip to the republic last
month. Since then,
arrangement for Havel's
visit have been conducted
by the Law School
"through the good offices"

of the ambassador, Brest said.
Previous winners of the prize include
former President Jimmy Carter, President
Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica and for
mer Canadian Prime Minister Pierre
Trudeau.
African National Congress president
Nelson Mandela was awarded the prize and
was scheduled to appear on campus in the


Havel
fall of 1992, but canceled the trip
due to unrest in South Africa.
Havel, a noted playwright who
was resident writer for the
Prague "Theater on the
Balustrade" from 1960 to 1969,
became an active critic of the
Soviet-sponsored communist
regime in the 19705. He was
imprisoned in 1979 for four
years, but began to gain interna
tional recognition for his plays,
which were banned from being
performed in Czechoslovakia.
He emerged in the late '80s as
a leading voice in the nascent
anti-communist movement in
Europe, and was jailed again in
1989. But his plight spurred the
popular coup d'6tat against the
government — called the "Velvet
Revolution" — and Havel was
elected president in 1990.
In July 1992, Havel resigned
as president of Czechoslovakia on
the eve of Slovakia's secession
from the country, which he had
campaigned against. Last Jan
uary, however, he was elected the
president of the Czech Republic.
Havel has gained a reputation
as one of the world's most elo
quent statesman. Most recently,
he appealed to Clinton to enlarge
NATO to include former Soviet
satellites in Eastern Europe.
