# Stanford grad founds 'Mi Familia' in Ecuador
## Alumni, faculty and staff work together to establish home for abandoned children 
### Nina Wasow 
In an attempt to help disabled and
abandoned Latin American children,
Stanford staff, faculty and alumni are
joining together to create a day care
center and group home in Ecuador.
Founded in March 1992, Mi Famil
ia — or "my family" — was the brain
child of alumnus Bruce Graham, a
former student in developmental psy

chology. Having spent summers in
Latin America during his youth, Gra
ham encountered much of the poverty
and deprivation there first hand.
"I wanted to do more than volun
teer work," he said.
The project — which will be funded
exclusively by donations — is expect
ed to cost about $300,000, including 9
percent for fundraising costs and 13
percent for administrative costs.

"We've received a few thousand dol
lars in private donations, and we're
going to start approaching founda
tions soon," Graham said.
Ten of the 12 children for the group
home will come from the Instituto Na
cional del Nino y la Familia, an
Ecuadorian government association.
In exchange for taking in the children
— who are disabled and inadequately
cared for in their present situation —

the Ecuadorian government has ver
bally pledged $30,000 to support the
project.
The other 2 children will come
from Fundacion Esperanza, a project
run by Graham's contacts in Ecuador.
Graham said the group home will
be run by an Ecuadorian married cou
ple, who will treat the children as
their own. It will be centered in a
house, complete with animals and
a fireplace. "We're trying to move
away from orphanages," he said.
Fundacion Esperanza current
ly has a makeshift day care center
in the back of a church, which
Graham describes as "coura
geous" but "100 percent inade
quate. There are no supplies, no
funding, no therapy," he said.
The center will be closed down

and all of the children there will
be relocated to the new facility.
Others will be selected by "ask
ing around, networking. Eventu
ally someone will say, 'Oh yeah,
that woman down the street has
disabled children,' " Graham
said.
Graham has other ideas for
the group if the day care center
and family home succeed. "For
example, pregnant women who
are malnourished and have
nowhere to stay have been com
ing to the hospital in Quito, and
having underweight babies," he
said. If the babies need to stay in

the hospital, the mothers often
have to abandon their children
because they have nowhere to go,
Graham said, adding there were
30 such cases in one year at one
hospital.
To combat this problem, Gra
ham sees a commune-style home
run entirely by the mothers and a
small staff, which would be a very
inexpensive facility.
Other Mi Familia board mem
bers include Assoc. Director of the
Center for Latin American Stud
ies Kathleen Morrison and Politi
cal Science Assoc. Prof. Terry
Karl, the director of the center.
