# Facing different challenges
## HIV-positive women battle misconceptions, prejudice 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh 
A five-person panel discussed the range
of problems associated with the growing
number of HIV-positive women in front of a
small audience at Toyon Lounge last night.
The event — sponsored by Project SAVE
(Stanford AIDS Volunteer Education) and
the Women's Health Care Committee at
Cowell Student Health Center — was part
of this month's Women's Herstory Celebra
tion and AIDS Awareness Week '94.
Lori Girshick, manager of the volunteer
education and training programs of Aris Pro
ject — Smita Clara County's largest social
services center supporting people with AIDS
mid HIV — began the talk by emphasizing
the complexity of challenges women must
face in dealing with an illness that has large
ly been categorized as a "gay men's disease."
Other panelists, including three who are
HIV-positive, also discussed their experiences
in confronting a hast of negative social stigmas
associated with the disease, such as assump
tions of promiscuity and intravenous drug use.
Jenny Burroughs, a family nurse practi
tioner at the University of California at San
Francisco's AIDS Clinic, noted that the rate
of contracting HIV is increasing more rapidly
in women than in any other group.
The growing number of women with HFV
has pressured health care professionals to ex
pand their areas of research and to think of
new ways to incorporate services for women,

Burroughs added.
For instance, the UCSF Clinician AIDS Re
search Consortium for Women is currently
studying 165 women with HIV in the Bay Area.
In June of last year, the government ap
proved funding for the consortium — one of
six organizations nationwide to be granted
federal dollars. Burroughs said the group will
use the funds to launch a new four-year study
of 3,000 women.
Burroughs stressed the importance of
avoiding fixations on categorized risk groups.
"Basically, anyone who is sexual is at risk re
gardless of who we think our partners are."
Myra, who asked that her last name not be
revealed, is a volunteer facilitator of an Aris
Project women's support group. As a woman
with HIV, she works to provide other women
in her situation with a safe, confidential envi
ronment in which they can share the issues
that affect their lives.
Jennifer, 26, another panelist with HIV,
speaks to teens and young adults about
everything from self-esteem to the dangers of
unprotected sex. She and the fifth panelist,
Ginger, said that educating young people
about AIDS and HIV has helped them deal
with their illnesses.
All these women praised the support
groups in which they are involved. Bur
roughs mentioned a recent Stanford study,
which showed that HIV-positive women in
support groups stay healthier longer, as a
hopeful sign for those coping with AIDS.
