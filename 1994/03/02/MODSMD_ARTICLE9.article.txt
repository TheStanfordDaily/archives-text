Economy improves
WASHINGTON (AP) — The economy
showed more strength in the last three
months of 1993 than it has in nearly 10
years, helping to renew inflation jitters that
the Clinton administration tried to calm.
The Gross Domestic Product rose at a
torrid 7.5 percent rate during the final
quarter last year, the Commerce Depart
ment reported yesterday as it revised its
own 5.9 percent estimate of a month ago.
The government's latest measure of the
nation's total output of goods and services
easily exceeded the projection of most
economists and was the best performance
since a 7.9 percent advance in the first
three months of 1984.
The fourth-quarter GDP surge was
fueled largely by a consumer spending
spree encouraged by low interest rates,

and a better-than-expected rise in exports
that is not likely to be duplicated soon.
Tuzla airport to open
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)
— Nudged by their Slavic brethren in Rus
sia, Bosnian Serbs sought to disarm
NATO firepower yesterday by agreeing to
open Tuzla's airport to aid flights.
An airlift to the Muslim city in northern
Bosnia like the one that's helping feed
Sarajevo could provide food and humani
tarian assistance to hundreds of thousands
of people.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic,
who had opposed opening the airport
because he believed arms could be smug
gled to the Muslims controlling it, made the
concession following talks in Moscow with
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev.
