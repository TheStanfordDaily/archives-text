"The Negro intellectual must not be allowed to forget that the integrated intellectual world is not representative of ethnic
group aspirations with regard to the world of the American Negro or Indian. The Indian world of the reservation
exemplifies the fate awaiting the American Negro, who is left stranded and impoverished in the ghettoes, beyond the fringe
of absorption. He will be pushed there through the compulsions of the American capitalistic dynamic if, as the most
populous ethnic 'out' group, the American Negro fails to galvanize his potential as a countervailing force."
[Harold Cruse, The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual, 1967]
"The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line—the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men
in Asia and Africa, in America and the islands of the seas."
[W.E.B. Dubois, The Souls of Black Folk, 1903]
"The American Negro must stand up and fight his way out of the social trap in which Western civilization has ensnared
him. But he can no longer struggle with the old methods alone. Protest actions of whatever nature are no longer enough.
The Negro must now develop and begin to use a set of new ideas ... [and] cast them in a theoretic frame."
[Harold Cruse, Rebellion or Revolution?, 1968]
