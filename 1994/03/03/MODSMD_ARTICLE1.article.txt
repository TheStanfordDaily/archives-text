## ASSU holds meeting for prospective candidates 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
With two slates contending for Council of Presi
dents and approximately 45 students considering a
run for the senate, April's ASSU election promises to
be a bit more competitive than last year's race.
People's Platform, which was founded in 1986 to
promote the interests of students of color, will en
dorse a COP slate for the first time since 1991. Ham
mer and Coffin — a party affiliated with the Chapar
ral and known for its humorous campaign promises
— will sponsor a second slate.
In addition, at least one slate is in the race for pres
idents of the senior class. Juniors Reena Gulati,
Alexa Constantinides, Nick Kolodny and Alisa Kami
gaki are meeting tomorrow to decide on goals for
their quartet, according to Constantinides.
Prospective candidates had to attend a meeting
last night in order to appear on the spring ballot. A
quick survey showed approximately 35 potential can
didates for 20 undergraduate senate seats and about
10 for the 20 graduate senate seats.
To appear on the ballot, candidates must also sub
mit petitions and declarations of intent by 4 p.m.
today. Any other students who wish to run for office
will have to organize write-in campaigns.
One of the COP slates, "Students' Voice," includes
juniors Mork Murdock, Anietie Ekanem and Lisa Lee
and sophomore Vanessa Alvarado. Murdock is cur
rently an undergraduate senator, Ekanem is a sena
tor and chair of the Black Student Union, Lee co
chairs the Asian American Students Association and
Alvarado is a senator involved in MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student group.
The other slate, "The Teamsters," includes se
niors Tony Sirna, Doug Miro and Peter Marks and
sophomore Scott Gagner. Among the Teamsters' ob
jectives, according to Sirna and Miro, are a bowling
alley and a Dunkin' Donuts in Tresidder Union, a
student minimum wage of $20 an hour, a hunting
trip for entering freshman, a Budweiser truck in
White Plaza every Friday and free fuzzy dice for any
one who votes for their slate.
Students would rather have fun than be bored,
Miro said, and the Teamsters will try to "give people
what they want."
Murdock said the name of the
Students' Voice slate explains one
of their main objectives — to
increase students' communica
tion with and influence in the
University administration.
"We've dealt with the adminis
tration all this year," Alvarado
said. "We want to do it in a better
way. . . . We think the COP is the
way to do it."
"We seriously believe we can

change student government at
Stanford," Murdock said.
By contrast, the Teamsters
said they had a different strategy
for dealing with the administra
tion — Sirna and Miro promised
to "put some pressure on the
administration" and to "throw a
little more muscle around."
Many prospective senate can
didates said they wanted to repre
sent the interests of groups to
which they belong. Graduate stu
dent Mike Bayle, for example,
said he was interested in running
because "the engineering schools
are pretty much underrepresent

ed."
Other potential candidates
cited disappointment with the
current student government and
a desire for a more effective sen
ate. Potential undergraduate can
didate Juan Leon said he was
"discontent" with many goings
on at the University and frustrat
ed at "not being able to have a
voice in it."
Sophomore Navin Jani com
plained that this year's senators
have not made themselves acces
sible. "I don't know the senate
much at all. [No senator] has ever
talked to me," he said.
