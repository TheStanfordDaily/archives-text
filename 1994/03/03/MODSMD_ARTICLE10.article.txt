A man suspected of stealing credit cards from
three dorm rooms was arrested by Stanford Police
early yesterday morning.
After receiving a tip from a student living in
Theta Chi, police arrested John Douglas Gentry, a
22-year-old Mountain View resident, for allegedly
committing the thefts, said Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer.
The student was in his bathroom at about 8:20
a.m. when he heard the door to his room open and
close, Niemeyer said. When the student went out
side to see what was happening, he saw Gentry, who
told the student that he was putting up flyers.
Gentry was carrying a staple gun and a stack of
flyers advertising a "Red Light Party" being held at
Ricker Dining Hall on March 5, Niemeyer said.
Sue Peletta, food service manager at Ricker, did
not know whether there was a "Red Light" party
scheduled at Ricker.
The resident told Gentry to go downstairs to post
the flyers, according to Niemeyer. When the resident
returned to his room, he noticed that his wallet had dis
appeared. The student ran outside, Niemeyer said, and
watched Gentry enter and exit the Synergy House.
When the student approached Gentry and asked

if he knew where he might be able to find his wallet,
according to Niemeyer, Gentry said he thought he
might know where the wallet was.
Gentry then took the student aside into a clump
of bushes and handed him his wallet back, Niemey
er said. After the student noticed a credit card was
missing, Gentry gave him back his credit card.
Gentry asked the student to keep things quiet,
Niemeyer said. The student then went back to his
room, and after talking it over with a friend, called
the police.
Sgt. David Lee was patrolling the Tresidder area
when he noticed Gentry, who matched the student's
description. Lee made eye contact with Gentry, who
began to act fidgety, according to Niemeyer.
When Gentiy began to hurriedly walk away, Lee
detained him until police could drive the student
past the Coffee House to make a positive identifica
tion of Gentry, Niemeyer said.
Gentry was arrested and found in possession
credit cards issued in the names of students living in
the Delta Kappa Epsilon house and Grove Lasuen,
Niemeyer said. He was also carrying $67 in crum
pled bills.
Gentry has been registered as a student at Santa
Clara University in the past but is not currently
attending, according to the Santa Clara University
Registrar.
