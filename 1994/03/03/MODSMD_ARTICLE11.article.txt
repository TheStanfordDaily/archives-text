## 
### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
A newly appointed search committee is now
accepting nominations for an academic secretary
to replace Communication Prof. Marion Lewen
stein, who will step down next quarter.
"Hopefully, within a fortnight, we will have a
list of recommendations for Provost (Condoleez
za) Rice," said History Department chair David
Kennedy, who heads the search committee. "We
hope Provost Rice will designate a new secretary
sometime relatively early in the spring quarter."
The academic secretary serves as a liaison
between the faculty and the Faculty Senate, keep
ing records on senate meetings and assisting the
senate chair.
Kennedy said advertisements have been
placed in Campus Report for nominations and
self-nominations of candidates," Kennedy said.
Nominees must be members of the Academic
Council, which is composed mostly of faculty

members.
Nominations are due by March 15. The com
mittee will submit three to five nominations to
Rice, who will make the final decision in consulta
tion with committee members.
"Because of the importance of a deep knowl
edge of the institution and the faculty, we are look
ing at senior faculty members," Kennedy said.
"It may be, but not necessarily, someone
recently retired because it is difficult to entice
people [who arel in a job," added English Prof.
Ron Rebholz.
Rice praised Lewenstein and said she will be
difficult to replace. "If I could recreate Marion
Lewenstein, the present academic secretary, I
would. She's been terrific," she said.
Lewenstein said her three years as academic
secretary have been "wonderful."
"I'm honored to have held the position," she
said. "But now I'm chomping at the bit. I want to be
with students regularly. I also have a few research
projects, and a book I never quite finished."
