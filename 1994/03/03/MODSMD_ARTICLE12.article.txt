## Massacre fury spreads, more die Israelis try to curb bloodshed, disarm seven extremist Jewish settlers 
### 
JERICHO, Occupied West Bank
(AP) â€” Israeli soldiers killed two Pales
tinian youths yesterday as fury over the
Hebron mosque massacre spread to
Jericho, where the PLO plans to set up
its headquarters under a peace plan
with Israel.
As part of an effort to curb the blood
letting, security forces disarmed seven
extremist Jewish settlers in the occu
pied territories and banned them from
Palestinian areas.
It was a radical move for the Israelis,
though unlikely to placate Palestinians
demanding the removal of Jewish set
tlements from the territories and inter
national protection.
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres reit
erated the government's refusal to bud
get on the settlement issue.
But Peres, an advocate of flexibility,
left the door open to further gestures.
The government "is not blind" to the
need to make concessions to the PLO to
resume talks, he told Jewish media rep
resentatives in Jerusalem last night.
Militant Palestinians, meanwhile,

called for revenge attacks for the
mosque massacre. And the government
put its embassies and citizens abroad
on alert. Rabin's terrorism adviser,
Yigal Pressler, urged Israelis with gun
permits to carry their weapons at all
times.
In Jericho, a normally peaceful town,
trouble flared when 400 Palestinians,
some waving black flags, protested Fri
day's massacre of Palestinian wor
shipers by a Jewish settler in Hebron.
Protesters stoned army vehicles and
a police station, and troops on rooftops
opened fire at youths, who were using
slingshots.
One teen-ager was killed in the
shooting and about 20 people were
injured, including Saeb Erakat, head of
the PLO's negotiating team, who was
slightly wounded in the leg.
Chanting "Revenge! Revenge!" the
teen-ager's family grabbed the body
from an ambulance. They wrapped it in
a Palestinian flag and carried it
through the rubble-strewn streets to a
cemetery for burial.

In Hebron, a 17-year-old Palestinian
was shot dead and 33 Arabs were
injured in clashes with soldiers that
erupted after the military lifted a 6-day
old curfew for two hours to allow people
to shop.
At least 13 Palestinians were wound
ed by gunfire in scattered stone-throw
ing clashes with troops in the Gaza
Strip, hospitals reported.
Yesterday's fatalities raised the
death toll since Friday to at least 66,
including at least 30 men and boys mas
sacred in the Hebron mosque Friday.
All but three of those killed were Arabs.
More than 400 people have been
wounded.
The Gaza-based Muslim fundamen
talist Hamas movement called for all
out revenge for the mosque massacre,
heightening Israeli unease amid mili
tary warnings that Arab reprisal
attacks are likely.
Hamas called for a "holy liberation
war" against Israel and exhorted the 1
million Arabs living in Israel to avenge
those killed in the mosque.
