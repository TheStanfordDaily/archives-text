Serbs fire grenades
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)
â€” Bosnian Serbs launched three rocket
propelled grenades yesterday at govern
ment troop positions in Sarajevo, violating
the U.N. cease-fire and raising fears that
the city's recent calm will prove to be
short-lived.
U.N. officials said Serbs fired the three
grenades at Bosnian positions around the
Jewish cemetery in downtown Sarajevo. A
U.N. spokesman, Lt. Col. Bill Aikman, said
Serb artillery also fired Tuesday on the Mus
lim town of Breza, just north of Sarajevo.
While in both cases the Serbs clearly had

breached the 3-week-old cease-fire, the
attacks apparently were not serious enough
to trigger a NATO air strike under the
alliance's Feb. 9 ultimatum.
