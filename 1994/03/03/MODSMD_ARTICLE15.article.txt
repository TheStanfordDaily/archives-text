## Editorials Wasting food points 
### 
IN A MAD rush at the end of
each quarter, students with
extra dining service meal
points scramble to spend the
remaining dollars on their cards.
Filling sacks with potato chips,
candy bars and soda, students can
feel satisfied that their expensive
meal plans are not going to waste.
Those students who are too
stressed or numbed by finals to
use their extra points sometimes
pass up potential junk food binges.
Their points fall into the Cardi
nal Twilight Zone, which means
the University is eating in dollars
what the students failed to eat in
burritos and deli sandwiches.
Both ways of disposing of extra
food points — binging and letting
the University gobble up wasted
points — seem impractical and
wasteful.
The University and students
have forgotten that there are oth
ers who need the food more than
they do. Dozens of charitable orga
nizations near Stanford would
jump at the chance to use surplus

food points to buy food for home
less shelters or other people in
need.
For instance, Spoon Hunger
Relief Network is one organization
which might be able to use stu
dents' extra points. On a voluntary
basis, students could submit their
cards to Spoon at the end of the
quarter and donate their supple
mental points. The accumulated
points of such a project would be
enough to buy loads of food from
the University to give to charity.
Dining Services might not
appreciate having to give full value
for students' cards because it
would signal a smaller net gain for
them, but for once students would
be getting what they pay for.
And even when food service
encourages students to eat enough
to make their meal plans worth
while, it is inevitable that some
students will have points left over.
So, rather than letting pre-paid
food rot in a dorm kitchen, the bet
ter option, by far, would be to give
it away to those who need it.
