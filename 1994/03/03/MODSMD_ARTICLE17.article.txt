# Boob tube for ASSU
## 
### 
AS THE spring ASSU elec
tions approach, students will
once again be forced to
choose from a myriad of candi
dates who make questionable cam
paign promises and post fliers and
campaign signs across campus.
However, after the election
results are compiled, these elected
officials often seem to slide into
anonymity rarely having opportu
nity to speak out on issues except
at senate meetings. It is often dur
ing these debates that a senator's
true worth can be shown. A sena
tor who will fight for what he
believes is far more reliable than
one who sits by and watches the
clock.
For this reason — and to show
that they really believe in account
ability — the ASSU senators
should vote to televise their meet
ings on the Stanford Cardinal

Broadcasting Network.
By televising the meetings,
interested students could flip the
channel to see what the senate was
up to without having to leave their
cozy dorm rooms.
At a time when ASSU senators
are trying to increase accountabili
ty by suggesting a uniform com
plete with sweatshirt and propeller
beanie hats, the senate should look
at some serious ways to become
more visible by paying for SCBN to
televise its meetings.According to
SCBN director Matt Kulikowski,
this would very little.
A collaboration between SCBN
and the ASSU would enable the
student body to be more aware of
the adequacies and inadequacies of
the senate and would keep the sen
ate more accountable.
Now it's just a matter of lights,
camera, action.
