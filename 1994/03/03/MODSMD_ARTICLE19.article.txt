## Tricks of talk show trade 
### 
LAST FRIDAY afternoon, I sat down
on the couch, remote in hand, fired up
the old TV and watched. After ten
minutes of a talk show I'd rather not name,
I was convinced that one out of every five
people was an overweight, transsexual goat
herder in a menage-a-trois with his best
friend's lover and her younger, racist
cousin. And that maybe I was one too.
It's shocking but true. No, I'm not talk
ing about me. I'm talking about TV and the
media as a whole. It isn't wholly responsible
for shoving this country down the garbage
disposal, but let's be honest — it isn't help
ing either.
Don't believe me?
First, understand that millions of Amer
icans watch daytime TV, particularly talk
shows. Take a look at a sampling of what
was showing Monday from 9 a.m. until 4
p.m., as listed in the TV schedule:
Vicki!: "People who are look-alikes of
famous talk-show hosts."
Sally: "The conflicting stories regarding
a shooting incident in which a teen shot his
friend."
Jenny Jones: "A woman confronts the
ex-lover of her fiance."
Richard Bey: "Women who say they
can't get dates because they are too beauti
ful."
Jerry Springer: "Update on a teenage
transsexual."
Montel Williams: "Sisters in love with
the same man."
Ricki Lake: "Sisters estranged because
one of them is gay."

Geraldo: "Penthouse Pets and Adonis
Men."
Makes you want to walk into a crowded
McDonald's and just open fire, doesn't it?
The sad thing is that this doesn't just stop
with television. I've been cutting out articles
from the San Francisco Chronicle for a
while now. The really weird ones. Catch
some headlines and lead-ins of articles the
self-proclaimed "Voice of the West" saw fit
to print:
"Man waving scissors shot by police: Two
police officers fatally shot a man who threat
ened them and others with a pair of scissors
yesterday."
"Coroner says driver's view of body was
obstructed: A San Francisco medical exam
iner's deputy apparently did not see the
body of an accident victim lying under a tarp
on Market Street when he horrified onlook
ers by driving his van over the lifeless form,
authorities said yesterday."
"Arrow pierces skull — no brain damage:
A man who was shot through the skull with
an arrow by a friend trying to knock a fuel
can off his head survived with no brain dam
age."
What's the point of printing these sto
ries? Sure, they're hilarious, but this is a
newspaper. People take this stuff seriously.
They begin to generalize.
A trend begins to develop, ladies and gen
tlemen. Call me a false prophet, but I see the
day coming when we kneel, reverent, before
the awesome power of pseudo-knowledge.
You've seen the commercials. The informa
tion superhighway is on its way. We're

going to have millions of hyper-megabytes
of knowledge at our fingertips. The whole
world will be connected.
All this means we're going straight to
hell. We'll be watching a TV mini-series on
Ahmad Ben Hassad: Libyan terrorist by
day, struggling romance novelist by night.
We'll have access to scandal rags from every
nation across the world, all conveniently
translated into English. And you think
those talk shows are bad now? Just you
wait, brother. You scoff now, but wait until
you read the TV listing for Rush Limbaugh,
the international version, broadcast from
inside the Kremlin. Trust me, man. It's
going to happen.
Worst of all, the information superhigh
way will take the fun out of everything.
We'll know everything. Backward wife
beating hicks from Nebraska will seem old
hat.
So what can we, as future leaders of
tomorrow, do to combat this problem?
Who knows. But I've recently started
standing in front of my window naked at
noon, every day. I listen to death marches
and read sections of "The Wasteland" when
I do it.
Think I can make Donahue?

Dave hopes not to attract hordes of admiring
fans now that they know where and in what
state he is to be found at noon.
