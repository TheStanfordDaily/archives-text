## Israeli settlers must be contained for complete peace 
### 
AT THE END of the worst day of
unrest in 27 years of Israeli occupa
tion on Friday, Feb. 25, some 60
Palestinians were killed and some 170
wounded in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. The massacre of Palestinians was
perpetrated by an Israeli settler at the
Haram al-Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron
while hundreds of Pabstinians were at
prayer. Further deaths and injuries con
tinued to be inflicted by the Israeli
Defense Forces during the widespread
protests throughout the Occupied Territo
ries, including Jerusalem. We mourn the
loss of life that has occurred in Hebron
and in Israel and Palestine in the days
since Friday and extend our condolences
to the families of those killed.
Attempts to dismiss the massacre as an

act of a deranged individual ignore the col
lective responsibility borne by the Israeli
government, which has created a climate
conducive to Jewish terror in the occupied
territories. The Israeli authorities allow
Israeli settlers to bear arms and have tol
erated violence by Jews against Arabs
while cracking down severely on Arab vio
lence and on the entire Arab population.
The incident in Hebron is merely the lat
est and worst in a series of Israeli violent
acts against the largely unarmed Pales
tinian population of the Occupied Territo
ries.
The Hebron massacre demonstrates
that the Israeli settlers are opposed to any
recognition of Palestinian national claims
and that the question of the settlements
must be addressed if the peace process is

to continue. Accordingly, we call on the
Israeli government to adopt immediately
the following measures which have been
proposed by Americans for Peace Now,
the Israeli Peace Now movement, and the
Meretz faction of the Israeli government
coalition:
• Disarm the settlers and enforce the
rule of law.
• Outlaw the militant right-wing group
Kach (of which Baruch Goldstein, the per
petrator of the Hebron massacre, was a
leader) and other extreme right-wing
Israeli groups.
• Dismantle Israeli settlements in and
around Hebron and pull Israeli forces
back to their bases to avoid further clash
es.
We also call on the Israeli government

to institute a permanent freeze on new
settlement construction. We call on the
international community to employ all
available means, including international
supervision, to guarantee the safety of
Palestinian civilians under Israeli occupa
tion.
We believe that unless the Israeli gov
ernment undertakes significant confi
dence building measures such as those
outlined above, the future of the Arab-
Israeli peace talks will be jeopardized.
