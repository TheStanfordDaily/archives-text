# University responding to women's needs study
## 
### 
We would like to respond to the Feb.
23 article ("Women's needs study ignored,
many claim") on a lack of University
response to the Women's Needs Assess
ment, a study on the status of women's
well-being at Stanford. Though specific
recommendations from the report have
not yet been implemented, the University
administration has recently taken steps to
ward action on several issues in the report.
On Jan. 25, a community forum was
held by the Women's Center Advisory
Board to identify issues of greatest con
cern to women on campus. The forum was
attended by many students and a number
of administrators, including Vice Provost
of Student Affairs Mary Edmonds and
Dean of Students Michael Jackson.
On Feb. 4, four students, both graduate
and undergraduate, met with Provost
Condoleezza Rice to further discuss these
concerns. These included graduate issues
such as the inadequacy of financial sup
port, the effects of the loss of the central

Office of Graduate Studies, and the lack of
options for student parents.
In addition, the effect on academic per
formance of undergraduates because of
graduate student pressures and lack of
connection between the two groups was
discussed. A mentoring program and
mandatory teaching assistant training,
including an increased sensitivity to gen
der dynamics in the classroom, were iden
tified as ways to address these issues.
Other ideas include a longer resident
assistant training session and an
assertiveness training program for women
students.Safety on campus will hopefully
be dealt with immediately by installing
campus phones and better lighting.
We were encouraged by our productive
meeting with Rice. Although the specific
recommendations in the Women's Needs
Assessment have not at this point been
addressed, we are pleased with the pro
active response by the administration to
the above issues.
