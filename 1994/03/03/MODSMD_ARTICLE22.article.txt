## Loveless bids the Farm adieu After five years, two schools and the 1992 Olympics the senior swimmer looks for a last jewel in her crown 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
In the royal succession of leader
ship within the Stanford women's
swim squad, one ruler has emerged
as the all-time leader of the elite
historical dynasty.
But for Lea Loveless, being a
good leader falls right in line with
her job description — team captain
of one of the top swimming pro
grams in the nation.
"That was the niche I found,"
Loveless said of her leading role.
"In it I found happiness in going to
workouts. The individual motiva
tions aren't as great, but to exter
nalize my motivations [on my
teammatesl let me find the motiva
tion to enjoy this sport."
She began developing that moti
vation at the age of five. Being the
sixth of seven children, Loveless
was one of the last in a long line of
family swimmers.
"If this team is going to have
success at the NCAA tournament,
you can stamp Lea's personality
right next to the trophy," coach
Richard Quick said. "She's the
glue, the heart, and the chemistry
of this team."
If you ask Loveless why she
started (and continued) swimming,
she might tell you the reason is "we
had only two bathrooms for seven
kids." The real reason she enjoys
swimming involves her gradual
maturation in the sport over the
years.
"What enabled me to make a big
breakthrough was a change in my
focus," Loveless said. "I used to
look at this sport just hoping to

win. But during the Olympic year
that changed to a process of
improvement. By focusing on a cer
tain factor of the sport I was able to
keep motivated and combat the
monotonous aspect of swimming."
Loveless' success in high school
was minimal compared to her later
accomplishments. She qualified for
Junior Nationals at age 11 and
competed at 12; she qualified for
the Senior Nationals at 12 and
competed at 13. As a high school
senior in 1989 she went to the Pan-
Pacific Games and won the 100-
yard backstroke.
"I was always finaling but never
able to win," Loveless said of her
high school career.
After being denied a scholarship
from Stanford coming out of high
school, Loveless spent her first
year of college at Florida, where
she first began improving in the
swimming realm. She placed ninth
in the 200 individual medley and
second in both the 100 and 200
backstroke her freshman year.
However, after her coach left the
school and she had a run-in with
the school administration, Loveless
decided to transfer.
"I wanted to come to Stanford
because I knew that academics
needed to play a bigger role than I
thought before," Loveless said.
"The [Stanford] team and various
aspects of this school compelled me
to come here."
For the Cardinal and coach
Quick, that decision was a tremen
dous boost for this University's
swimming program.
"Lea has been the best leader,"
Quick said. "She's the most giving

person that I've ever seen. She's
the best team captain I've ever had,
and I've had some great team cap
tains."
Loveless found several key dis
tinctions between Florida and
Stanford. "There was a higher indi
vidual focus at Florida, where
eveiybody was hoping to win with
cumulative good individual perfor
mances," she said.
At Stanford, however, she found
the team to be the primary focus of
the program, as the team "con
sumes the individual" but keeps
everyone's goals in mind, according
to Loveless.
In addition, Loveless felt "segre
gated" at Florida, living in the ath
letic quarters and even having her
classes picked for her by coaches. "I
was content at the time, but I real
ized now how great it is to be able
to leave the pool and 112 interact I with
such a variety of people."
Her first true blossoming in the
sport, ironically enough, did not
occur until the 1992 Olympics. At
the Barcelona games she placed
fourth in the 200 backstroke, won a
bronze medal in the 100 back and
captured a gold in the 400 medley
relay. In that relay, she broke the
American record in her lead-off leg
and helped the foursome to a
world-record showing.
"My favorite part of the
Olympics was that no matter who
you were or where you came from,
everyone was treated the same
way," Loveless said. "All differ
ences were forgotten in the
Olympic Village. It was as close to
Utopia as I think you can get."
Her success did not stop there,

however. After redshirting her
sophomore year at Stanford, Love
less returned strong during her
second year of eligibility at NCAAs
— as a junior, she placed sixth in
the 200 IM, second in the 200 back
and first in the 100 back. Last year
she improved even more, taking
fifth in the 200 IM and first in both
the 100 and 200 backstroke events.
For this year, Loveless hopes to
place at least in the top three of the
200 IM field and defend her two
titles in the backstroke events. Her

goals for the team are similar: "I
want our team to have no regrets,
to never give up, and to know that
they could not have done anything
different or better. That way, if
we're not first [place], we have
nothing to be disappointed in," she
said.
Aside from her list of accom
plishments in the pool, Loveless is
a well-respected athlete and per
son.
"We just can't have a team
meeting without Lea giving us

some valuable input," teammate
Jane Skillman said. "The coaches
can give you good insight, but she
can really relate to us."
Loveless attributes her success
to her family, who helped to "foster
a sense of humor" in her. "You def
initely need to keep a lighthearted
attitude in swimming, and just
know that when you get out of a
race you'll move on and the sun
will come out tomorrow, she said."


Vincent Ho — Daily
Senior Lea Loveless receives flowers from coach Richard Quick after her last collegiate dual meet two
weeks ago. Loveless, a backstroker, will leave a hole in the Stanford lineup when she graduates.
Loveless plans to swim in the
World Championships this sum
mer in Rome, which will probably
be her last endeavor in the profes
sional swimming scene.
"I left the Olympics under great
circumstances, and it's time to
move on. I'm going to allocate my
motivations to a new goal, and find
dreams in other areas."
The future leaders of the Stan
ford squad have large shoes to fill,
but Quick is confident that others
will make their mark.
"We have several swimmers
that can step up to be leaders," he
said.
"But [Lea'sl definitely set the
standard."
