# Women travel to Oregon
## On the road 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
Two more for the road.
After compiling three victories in two weeks at
home, the No. 11 Cardinal women's basketball team
kicks off its final regular-season road trip tonight
when it faces the Oregon State Beavers (7-7, 15-8 in
the Pacific 10 Conference) in Corvallis, Ore.
While Stanford (18-5, 11-3) has lost two out of its
last three games in Gill Coliseum, the Cardinal pre
vailed there last season and has since run its alltime
record against the Beavers to 12-4 with a resounding
88-67 triumph Feb. 5 in Maples Pavilion. Circum
stances have changed since that encounter five weeks
ago, but several factors suggest that the result should
be similar this time around.
Foremost among these reasons is Stanford's seem
ingly annual late-season run, a winning streak that
started with the Cardinal's last Oregon series and cur
rently stands at seven games. Included in the streak
are last weekend's victories over USC and UCLA, a
pair of wins that marked Stanford's revenge for its
last two losses and which brought the Cardinal with
in striking distance of a sixth straight Pac-10 title.
In knocking the front-running Trojans from No. 6
to No. 9 in the Associated Press poll, Stanford
retained its No. 11 spot for a second week and now
stands tied for second place in the Pac-10, just a game
and a half out of the conference lead with four games
remaining.
To stand any chance of winning tonight, the
Beavers must find a way to shut down Cardinal junior
center Anita Kaplan and senior guard Christy Hedg
peth, Stanford's offensive leaders both in the teams'
last meeting and throughout the winning streak.
Kaplan, recently named Pac-10 Player of the Week
for her career-high 34-point effort and 20-point fol
low-up against USC and UCLA, has averaged close to
20 points in her last seven starts to raise her team
leading season average to 16.5 ppg. She led all scorers
with 22 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in the Cardi
nal's first clash with the Beavers.
Hedgpeth, meanwhile, added 20 points against
Oregon State and has since raised her scoring average
to 12.7 ppg, third-best on the squad. She continues to
lead the Pac-10 in free-throw shooting as well, having
knocked down 52-of-62 (83.9 percent) on the year.
Despite the inspired play of the Stanford team and
its leaders of late, however, an ii\jury to Beavers point
guard Bokana Vidic stands as
the most formidable roadblock
to the Beavers' hopes for an
upset tonight.
Vidic, a sophomore, estab
lished a school season record
with 176 assists in just 21
games, but tore the medial
miniscus and possibly the ante
rior cruciate ligament of her
right knee while driving to the
basket against Washington
Feb. 19, and is lost for the sea
son.
With Vidic out, Beavers
coach Aki Hill will rely even
more heavily on sophomore for
ward Tanja Kostic, the Pac
10's third-leading scorer (21.0
ppg) and fifth-leading rebound
er (10.0 rpg).
Kostic turned in a workman
like 19 points and six boards
against the Cardinal in Maples,
but enjoyed most of her produc
tion long after the outcome of
the contest was decided.
Tonight's action gets under
way at 7:30 p.m., and as always
