# Men's basketball plays last two home games
## Postseason opportunities still up in the air 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
It's the beginning of the end for the
Stanford men's basketball team.
The end of the regular season, that is.
With its postseason fate on the line, the
team faces Oregon State and Oregon at
Maples Pavilion this weekend in its final
regular-season home games of the year.
"Our last two home games are going to
be big," Stanford coach Mike Montgomery
said. "We've still got something to play for
here."
With four games remaining on its sched
ule, the Cardinal's NCAA Tournament
chances remain very much up in the air.
Stanford (14-9 overall, 7-7 in the Pacific 10
Conference) is currently tied for fifth place
in the division with Washington State.
While a bid to the National Invitation
Tournament is relatively certain for the
Cardinal, its NCAA prospects are more
questionable. The Pac-10 has never sent
more than four representatives to the
NCAA Tournament — the Cardinal must
finish strong to merit NCAA consideration.
Finishing strong is not out of the question
— Stanford defeated all four of its remaining
opponents (the Cardinal plays Washington
and Washington State next weekend) the first
time through its schedule.
"We have to win the rest of our games
and see how everything falls into play,"
Cardinal forward Brent Williams said. "We
need to do our part."
Since defeating the Oregon schools on
the road a month ago, Stanford has
slumped, losing four out of its last five con
tests.
"We've done a lot of mind-searching,"
Cardinal guard Dion Cross said. "We've got
to get back into the team mind-set that we
had at the beginning of the season."
Stanford faces its easiest end-of-the-sea
son test tonight at 7:30 p.m. against Oregon
State. Mired in last place in the Pac-10, the
Beavers (6-17, 2-12) have been playing
nightmarish basketball over the past two
weeks, losing their last four games by an

average of over 20 points per contest. The
Beavers have not won a road game all sea
son.
The Ducks (9-14, 5-9), who visit Maples
Saturday at 7:30 p.m., have won three of
their last four, losing only a 75-71 decision
to conference-leading Arizona over that

stretch.
"Oregon's made a lot of
improvements," Williams said.
"You can't just look at their
record."
Oregon is led by 6-foot-2 guard
Orlando Williams, who is current
ly fifth in the conference in scor
ing with an 18.2 per-game aver

age.
The junior gave the Cardinal
fits last month in Eugene, scoring
22 points in a 69-67 Stanford win.
Williams can be deadly from
three-point range — his 65 three
pointers this season place him
fourth on the Ducks' all-time sin
gle-season list.
"Williams has improved a lot
since last season," said Cross,
who will guard Williams Satur
day. "My job is just to get in his
face and shut him down."
