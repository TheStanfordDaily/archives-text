# Team discusses 6th Man Club
## 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery
has no qualms about stating where he
stands on the controversial Sixth Man
Club.
"It's what college basketball is all
about," Montgomery said. "They've
gone in there and had some fun, and
now students are excited to come
watch us play."
The inaugural season of the 250-
member Sixth Man Club winds down
this weekend. The club, a creation of
the Stanford sports marketing
department, occupies the midcourt
area of what was formerly exclusively
student seating. Membership to the
club cost $10 for Stanford students
and included a T-shirt and free food
at Halftime Sports Bar before home
games.
While students have debated both
the need and the fairness of the Sixth
Man Club, Cardinal players and
coaches came out in resounding sup
port of the club.
"They're the best thing that's
happened to the crowd since I've
been here," senior forward Brent
Williams said. "They have really
pumped us up."
"They've been great," junior for
ward Andy Poppink said. "They add
to the noise of this place."
Attendance at Stanford home
games has risen 34 percent over last
year's mark to an average of nearly
5,000 fans per contest. Montgomery
attributes the jump, in part, to the
Sixth Man Club.
"Of course, more people are
going to come out when we're win
ning," Montgomery said. "But I
think the Sixth Man Club has made
it so much more fun for the students
to come out, and I appreciate that."
