# Women gymnasts tune up against Sacramento State
## Avoiding the Hornets' sting 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
The Stanford women's gymnas
tics team can afford to alter its line
up and take some risks in its
upcoming meet against Sacramen
to State tomorrow at 7 p.m.
Stanford defeated Sacramento
State on Cardinal turf earlier this
season by almost 14 points. But
this Friday's meet should be more
exciting, since the Hornets have
greatly improved and will be com
peting at home, said Hornet head
coach Kim Hughes.
"When we first met with Stan
ford, it was our first meet of the
season and we got a score of
174.425," he said. "Five meets
later, at our last meet, we got a
score of 186.75."
Though the meet should be clos
er this time, the Cardinal team is
averaging about a 190.000 and is
confident it will win.
"We still need to challenge our
selves," said Stanford's head coach
Breck Greenwood. "But we are
going to vary the lineup and try

some new skills."
Friday's meet will be the last
meet of the season in which the
Cardinal team will perform tricks it
is not "90 to 100 percent" sure of
making, according to Greenwood.
Stanford will rest some of its
starters Friday. Freshman Katie
Jennings, who has been nursing a
back injury for most of the season,
will not compete, and junior Jene
Elzie, a usual all-arounder, will
only perform a few events.
Sophomore Linda Chun will be
a new addition to the vaulting line
up, and will also compete on
uneven bars and beam. Sophomore
Hillary Anderson was taken out of
the vaulting lineup the past few
meets so that she could focus more
on her floor routine, but improve
ments that coaches expected would
take a month to master only took
Anderson a week. She will be back
in the all-around competition after
this weekend.
Senior Mollie Brown, a usual
exhibitioner, will be competing on
bars and beam. Senior Laurie West,
since having surgery on her ankle,
has been working on a conservative

and a non-conservative bar routine.
She now plans to compete her non
conservative routine, which has
more difficulty, for the rest of the
season.
"Mollie and Laurie are both
great competitors," Greenwood
said. "They usually do better in
meets than in practice."
Sacramento State's strongest
event this season is vault, led by
freshman Rebecca Seebirt. The
Hornets' weakest event is bars,
according to coach Hughes. Fresh
man Kim Schultz leads the team on
floor and beam, and is a strong all
around competitor. Lisa Schindler
is the top all-around gymnast, as
well as the best bar worker.
According to Hughes, the Hor
net team hopes to receive its high
est home score and maintain a
score in the mid-180s.
"We know what Stanford is
capable of and we are realistic,"
Hughes said. "In order for us to
win, we would have to have a near
perfect meet and Stanford would
have to fall like six or seven times.
And you don't hope a team will
mess up."
