Conflict between the aspirations of de
veloping countries to modernize and the
desires of industrialized countries to
maintain the environment hinder the cre
ation of global environmental policy, said
former Environmental Protection Agency
chief William Reilly in a speech yesterday.
Reilly referred to his personal experi
ences in Oaxaca, Mexico to illustrate the
contending forces. Oaxaca is a beautiful

land, rich in flora and fauna with many
beautiful bays, destined "to become the
next Cancun," Reilly said.
However, its residents are extremely
poor and stand to gain a great deal from
the opportunities to "unfold in construc
tion, services, and transportation," he
said.
Old-line conservationists would ap
proach Oaxaca intending to fence it ofT, he
added, "punching green holes in the map,"
while keeping out the social and economic

pressures of the indigent residents.
The solution is to integrate both devel
opment and conservation, Reilly said.
"One hopes the new development will be
fitted into its surroundings, that roads will
skirt the mangroves, that sewage will be
treated . . . and giantism in construction
avoided. This is where the game will be
won or lost. Not in development, or its
lack, but in how development occurs."
