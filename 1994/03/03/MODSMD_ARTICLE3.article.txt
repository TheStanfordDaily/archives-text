Conflict between the aspirations of de
veloping countries to modernize and the
desires of industrialized countries to
maintain the environment hinder the cre
ation of global environmental policy, said
former Environmental Protection Agency
chief William Reilly in a speech yesterday.
Reilly referred to his personal experi
ences in Oaxaca, Mexico to illustrate the
contending forces. Oaxaca is a beautiful

land, rich in flora and fauna with many
beautiful bays, destined "to become the
next Cancun," Reilly said.
However, its residents are extremely
poor and stand to gain a great deal from
the opportunities to "unfold in construc
tion, services, and transportation," he
said.
Old-line conservationists would ap
proach Oaxaca intending to fence it ofT, he
added, "punching green holes in the map,"
while keeping out the social and economic

pressures of the indigent residents.
The solution is to integrate both devel
opment and conservation, Reilly said.
"One hopes the new development will be
fitted into its surroundings, that roads will
skirt the mangroves, that sewage will be
treated . . . and giantism in construction
avoided. This is where the game will be
won or lost. Not in development, or its
lack, but in how development occurs."
The forces contending in Oaxa
ca, however, are relatively simple
compared to those governing the
role of major developing countries
such as China in determining glob
al climate change policy, Reilly said,
illustrating this point with the

events preceding the Montreal Pro
tocol which limits chlorofluorocar
bon use.

China had planned to build 300
million refrigerators, all of which
used CFCs as refrigerants, he said.
The United States not only wanted
the Chinese to use CFC substitutes,
but asked the country to forego
manufacturing the refrigerators
altogether. To China, it seemed
chat the United States wanted to

limit its development, Reilly said.
This was complicated even more
by the fact that the United States'
CFC emissions are 10 times
China's. But the United States,
with the help of technical experts
and assurances from industry that
CFC substitutes would be afford
able, convinced China to ratify the
Montreal Protocol.
Offering solutions, Reilly sug
gested increased communication

between industrialized and devel
oping nations. He cited an incident
at the June 1992 Rio De Janeiro
environmental conference where
negotiations were stalled over a
misunderstanding of the Indian
term "lop and top".
To U.S. negotiators, "lop and
top" sounded like the complete dis
memberment of a tree, while it
actually meant only removing the
top branches of a tree.
