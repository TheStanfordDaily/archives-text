# Burying James Dean's ashes Julie Tsai
## 
### 
I was going to marry River Phoenix, and
then, of course, he had to go and die on
me.
Sigh ... I guess some things just aren't
meant to be.
No, no, no, I don't believe that. That line is
like some twisted Zen philosophy from hell
seductively coaxing us to waste away into
passive blissful oblivion. We are not minis
cule clay (wo) men to be moved by some un
seen fateful hand. We are the inhabitants of
our souls, the captains of our ships, the mas
ters of our domains, the... whatever.
Forgive me, I know it's been five months
since Phoenix departed from this world, but
I just saw "My Own Private Idaho," and I'm
still a little dazed.
But what is it about the deaths of the
young and the reckless that is all so intrigu
ing and simultaneously unexpected, like it
was bound to happen? Maybe the fascina
tion is tied to a need to affirm that there was
deserved karmic retribution involved, that it
really wasn't some random event that will
fade with time.
But, gosh, River looked like such a good
sort of man. Perhaps he was a little less than

Ivory-pure, but he seemed so sincere. He did
cool movies. He dated Martha Plimpton. He
recycled. What a waste.
I guess, though, that's a clich£d response
to a clich£d stereotype.
It would be the sincere ones who get all
introspective and self-destructive. As they
always say about the pathological murderer
who just happened to live next door, "He
was such a quiet man."
That was a clich£d reaction—l can't stop.
I think this was what "Heathers" was about.
The James Dean Syndrome: it's rampant;
it's in one's blood.
Live fast, die young, and leave a good
looking corpse behind.
Janis Joplin. Jimi Hendrix. Jim Morrison.
Natalie Wood. That guy who sang "La
Bamba." I'm sure I'm forgetting quite a few,
but all you '60s culture revivalist "Genera
tion X"-ers can fill in your own.
It's not that I believe we all have a primal

urge to go out in a fast brilliant blaze of light,
speed and twisted car parts. We're not lem
mings, you know.
At the very least, though, 1 have fallen vic
tim to a robust fascination with it and all its
baggage. There's just something about
young glamorous people willing to chuck it
all for one last hedonistic rush, or not, that
begs inquiry. Pop culture has recently been
exhibiting a particularly self-destructive
vein, in message and action.
I wonder how far Porno for Pyros would
have gotten with their heroin advocacy in
the "just say no" '80s. Or can you picture Li
onel Ritchie in the same generation with an
Eddie Vedder mumbling dejectedly to MTV
after being showered with awards that "I
don't know, sometimes this world can just
really really get you down?"
Even good-kid entertainment flirts with
rebellion and its evil child, anarchy.
I don't think Luke Perry and Jason Priestley

would be sporting those 'burns if we didn't
find James Dean as cool as we do. So Perry and
Priestley are made to emit neat little morals
— same bat-time, same bat-channel every
week; they're still supposed to harken to an
era when a nasty-boy squint and a cigarette
were enough to scare mom and pop.
Even Drew Barrymore, former "E. T."
cutie and reformed bad girl, is cashing in on
the reckless youth thing by doing coy adver
tisements for Guess? jeans. She came pretty
close to filling out that list of tragic young re
grets, but she lived to write her book, do an
Amy Fisher movie or two, and actually get
some royalties on her commercialization.
It still bugs me, though, that in the face of
this recklessness, one is tempted to make
sympathetic noises and sigh, "It's sad, but
you know what those young people are like."
Okay, so I'm propagating this James Dean
Syndrome thing, but only 'cuz it really really
does exist. You can't help it. It's trashy, it
makes you buy People magazine, you're
ashamed in the morning, but it's part of you.
Don't fight it. Breathe it, smell it, live in
it. You know you love it. Just like I loved
River Phoenix. ■
