# e-mailing the night away milking more fun from your cluster
## 
### Amanda Green 
E-mail, e-mail, e-mail. This campus
is wonderfully computer oriented. If

you weren't familiar with the imbe
cilic machines before you came to
campus, I'm sure you are now.

And not only for word processing
greeting words of all RCCs during
Freshman Orientation is "Hello, my
name is , go to the cluster and

open an e-mail account." Good advice,

too. It's hard to do anything on cam
pus without e-mail. Most of us
couldn't even print without it.
For a good number of Stanfordites,
however, their networking knowl
edge is limited to these functions.

Many students actually use the e
mail part of their account, sending
messages to far places, close friends,

and errant professors. For those who
are continually frustrated by elm, by the
way, type "control-x control-c" at the end

of the letter. It'll make your day so much
brighter. Note to experienced elm users: try
pine on the adelberts. Pine has a better editor.

Confused yet? Of course, we're dealing
with inherently confusing computers.
All of the computers on campus are linked
together by a lot of cables that closely resem
ble phone lines. The cable itself is called eth
ernet, and the invisible network that hooks all
of Stanford's computers together is called
SUNet. Even if Stanford students just had ac
cess to SUNet, there would be fun things to do
on rainy days.
But SUNet is connected to the Internet,
which is a bunch of ethernet and satellite con
nections connecting small nets like SUNet
into other small nets, and on and on until you
have a connection to anywhere in the world
with a networked computer.
Now we can really have fun.
Good clean fun
You're probably sitting at your Mac Classic
without enough memory to keep Word 2.0
open and manage to eject the disk at the same
time. But it has an ethernet card and there is a
cable running from your computer to the
fancy built-in ethernet connections available
in most dorms these days. And the size of your
computer matters not, because you can log
into a computer bigger and faster than any
sane person needs, and your Mac gives it or
ders and it will actually listen.
So what orders are you going to give it?
You could browse your newgroups, play a
few MUDs, FTP a few files to your account for
reading, FTP a few gifts for your viewing plea
sure, or talk to someone in another country.
Still impressed by e-mail? I thought not.
The best thing is, all these things are incred

ibly easy to do. As long as you have an ac
count, there are so many things on the Inter
net to do that you could never be bored.
First log into a station just like you would
for e-mail. Cardinal, elaine, adelbert, your
dorm NeXT, whatever. Well start small —
with newsgroups — a variant on e-mail.
Think of them as a bulletin board. News
groups are theme-oriented, and there's a
newsgroup out there for everyone.
People send mail to the newsgroup, mak
ing comments and asking questions and leav
ing notes to friends. But all mail directly or in
directly relates to one topic. When people
read news, they see the file that everyone who

Graphic by Dan Kim

reads the newsgroup sends mail to. So it is
possible to read about virtually any topic and
see it discussed by people all across the coun
try — and likely a few out of country too.
Another way to be amused on e-mail is to
search FTP sites (FTP is a process, not a
thing). It is the process of bringing a file, ei
ther made of text (ASCII) or symbols (binary)
to your computer so to read it Binary files
most likely mean pictures, which are always
fun to use as wallpaper on your Mac windows.
The easiest way for Mac users to search
FTP sites is by the program Turbo Gopher,
which is on most cluster machines. Anything
found off Turbo Gopher can be put on disk if

you want to move it to a different computer.
Everything you ever needed is on FTP sites.
All of Shakespeare's works are out there some
where, for example. You can even FTP games
to your account, if you know where to look.

Human inspiration

There are also ways to talk to real
y people on the net in realtime (si-

multaneously). There are many
ways to talk but watch out — all

are highly addictive.
The easiest way is
called talk-request.
Many people have used

v . x talk-request. You simply
type "talk <address>" at the prompt. If the
person is logged in at the same time, they get
the message that you want to talk to them, and
they respond with "talk <your address>." The
screen divides in half, and you each type mer
rily at each other.
I hope you aren't impressed, because this
really isn't impressive.
Impressive is a talker, or IRC or a MUD.
IRC is a huge "place" were people can go to
chat. People from all over the world talk to
each other about everything anonymous-

I ly. The only drawback with IRC is that you
112 need a client, or program that makes talk
-1 ing easier. Without a client, you would have
to know the IRC programming language. To
find a client, ask your RCC or go to a cluster
and ask the consultants.
Another type of realtime communication
is a MUD. There are thousands of MUDs,
and a special client isn't necessary to use
them because telnet can be used, which is
built into accounts. A MUD is for more than
socializing, though. It is a game, and the
point is to advance your character by killing
monsters, winning prizes and exploring. It is
a computer game with real people wrapped
up in it.
To get a list of places to telnet to MUD, FTP
off eskimo.com (FTP eskimo.com, search the
directories, "get filename" type control-c,
then "emacs filename" at your prompt.).
Then type "telnet <address>" and you are
there. MUDs have their own themes and in
formation.
If you are interested in something less de
structive, but want to talk, talkers are stripped
MUDs. They still have rooms, but the only
purpose is to wander around a chit-chat
rather than kill every monster you can find.
One of the most popular is in England, called
Foothills. To get to it, type "telnet
marble.bu.edu 2010."
So the next time you're trying to procrasti
nate that problem set or paper, hop onto the
net and surf your problems away. ■

find a client, ask your RCC or go to a cluster
and ask the consultants.
Another type of realtime communication
is a MUD. There are thousands of MUDs,
and a special client isn't necessary to use
them because telnet can be used, which is
built into accounts. A MUD is for more than
socializing, though. It is a game, and the
point is to advance your character by killing
monsters, winning prizes and exploring. It is
a computer game with real people wrapped
up in it.
To get a list of places to telnet to MUD, FTP
off eskimo.com (FTP eskimo.com, search the
directories, "get filename" type control-c,
then "emacs filename" at your prompt.).
Then type "telnet <address>" and you are
there. MUDs have their own themes and in
formation.
If you are interested in something less de
structive, but want to talk, talkers are stripped
MUDs. They still have rooms, but the only
purpose is to wander around a chit-chat
rather than kill every monster you can find.
One of the most popular is in England, called
Foothills. To get to it, type "telnet
marble.bu.edu 2010."
So the next time you're trying to procrasti
nate that problem set or paper, hop onto the
net and surf your problems away. ■

E-mail, e-mail, e-mail. This campus
is wonderfully computer oriented. If

you weren't familiar with the imbe
cilic machines before you came to
campus, I'm sure you are now.

And not only for word processing
greeting words of all RCCs during
Freshman Orientation is "Hello, my
name is , go to the cluster and

open an e-mail account." Good advice,

too. It's hard to do anything on cam
pus without e-mail. Most of us
couldn't even print without it.
For a good number of Stanfordites,
however, their networking knowl
edge is limited to these functions.

Many students actually use the e
mail part of their account, sending
messages to far places, close friends,

and errant professors. For those who
are continually frustrated by elm, by the
way, type "control-x control-c" at the end

of the letter. It'll make your day so much
brighter. Note to experienced elm users: try
pine on the adelberts. Pine has a better editor.

Confused yet? Of course, we're dealing
with inherently confusing computers.
All of the computers on campus are linked
together by a lot of cables that closely resem
ble phone lines. The cable itself is called eth
ernet, and the invisible network that hooks all
of Stanford's computers together is called
SUNet. Even if Stanford students just had ac
cess to SUNet, there would be fun things to do
on rainy days.
But SUNet is connected to the Internet,
which is a bunch of ethernet and satellite con
nections connecting small nets like SUNet
into other small nets, and on and on until you
have a connection to anywhere in the world
with a networked computer.
Now we can really have fun.
Good clean fun
You're probably sitting at your Mac Classic
without enough memory to keep Word 2.0
open and manage to eject the disk at the same
time. But it has an ethernet card and there is a
cable running from your computer to the
fancy built-in ethernet connections available
in most dorms these days. And the size of your
computer matters not, because you can log
into a computer bigger and faster than any
sane person needs, and your Mac gives it or
ders and it will actually listen.
So what orders are you going to give it?
You could browse your newgroups, play a
few MUDs, FTP a few files to your account for
reading, FTP a few gifts for your viewing plea
sure, or talk to someone in another country.
Still impressed by e-mail? I thought not.
The best thing is, all these things are incred

ibly easy to do. As long as you have an ac
count, there are so many things on the Inter
net to do that you could never be bored.
First log into a station just like you would
for e-mail. Cardinal, elaine, adelbert, your
dorm NeXT, whatever. Well start small —
with newsgroups — a variant on e-mail.
Think of them as a bulletin board. News
groups are theme-oriented, and there's a
newsgroup out there for everyone.
People send mail to the newsgroup, mak
ing comments and asking questions and leav
ing notes to friends. But all mail directly or in
directly relates to one topic. When people
read news, they see the file that everyone who

Graphic by Dan Kim

reads the newsgroup sends mail to. So it is
possible to read about virtually any topic and
see it discussed by people all across the coun
try — and likely a few out of country too.
Another way to be amused on e-mail is to
search FTP sites (FTP is a process, not a
thing). It is the process of bringing a file, ei
ther made of text (ASCII) or symbols (binary)
to your computer so to read it Binary files
most likely mean pictures, which are always
fun to use as wallpaper on your Mac windows.
The easiest way for Mac users to search
FTP sites is by the program Turbo Gopher,
which is on most cluster machines. Anything
found off Turbo Gopher can be put on disk if

you want to move it to a different computer.
Everything you ever needed is on FTP sites.
All of Shakespeare's works are out there some
where, for example. You can even FTP games
to your account, if you know where to look.

Human inspiration

There are also ways to talk to real
y people on the net in realtime (si-

multaneously). There are many
ways to talk but watch out — all

are highly addictive.
The easiest way is
called talk-request.
Many people have used

v . x talk-request. You simply
type "talk <address>" at the prompt. If the
person is logged in at the same time, they get
the message that you want to talk to them, and
they respond with "talk <your address>." The
screen divides in half, and you each type mer
rily at each other.
I hope you aren't impressed, because this
really isn't impressive.
Impressive is a talker, or IRC or a MUD.
IRC is a huge "place" were people can go to
chat. People from all over the world talk to
each other about everything anonymous-

I ly. The only drawback with IRC is that you
112 need a client, or program that makes talk
