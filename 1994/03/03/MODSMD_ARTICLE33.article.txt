# College music explosion
## What to look out for and listen to in 1994 
### Arnold Pan, Andy Radin Joey Rosenblum 
What exactly is "college rock"? Well, it's
not what MTV calls "Alternative Na
tion" or what Live 105 tries to spoon
feed us with their heavy-play rotation. And
it's not that obscure playlist on KZSU that no
one tunes in to or the underground music to
which disenfranchised punks cling.
So we haven't told you what college rock is,
but what it isn't. It's somewhere in between tal
ent and luck, personality and style... read on.

Pop losers
As a genre of music, many often misun
derstand pop as merely what is "popular."
More than an attitude or contest of what's
cool, pop is a sound and a musical quality.
Still confused? Listen to the Beatles for the
prototypic "pop sound."
Of course, pop music isn't limited to the
Fab Four. It's passed through many stages,
from the early 70s power pop of Big Star to
the groundbreaking college radio acts of the
early '80s like R.E.M and the Replacements.
College pop expands in many directions
these days, with bands taking the tried and
true combination of sing-along vocals and
catchy guitar hooks and making new sounds
with that old formula.
Take the "shoegaze pop" movement for
example. British bands like My Bloody Valen
tine and Lush pioneered the sound given the
strange label because they were more intent
on making swirls of guitar sounds and cooing
incomprehensible lyrics than on being pho
togenic pop stars.
Velocity Girl gives a good introduction to
this kind of music. This Washington, D.C.
five-piece puts together a tasty combination
of sugary-sweet pop vocals and swirly layers
of guitar. On the other end of this most mod
ern of modern music movements lies space
age Stereolab. This groundbreaking band
mixes in tons of synthesizer and electric
organ tracks with droning guitar work with
out sounding cheesy. Throw in Marxist lyrics
and you've got a truly revolutionary band.
The ever-popular grunge is also a relative
newcomer to the pop scene. The trend with
in this trend seems to be moving away from
the howling of Seattle's finest to more sing
song vocal parts. Bluesy, sludge rockers Red
Red Meat bring innovation to the grunge an
them and straightforward pop sensibilities.
While their blend of mellowed grunge guitars
and twangy smooth vocals remind one of
vintage Rolling Stones, this Chicago four
some sounds like nothing else around.
For those of you who don't want anything
new and are just looking for a good pop band,
never fear — Unrest may be just what you
want. They lay off the guitar tricks and ac
company their pretty lyric harmonies with
powerfully unadorned guitar chords. They're
certainly a band which carries on the tradi
tion of pop,

bringing happy,

hummable music to whoever listens.
A HORDE of new mnsic
There's always been a place in the college
music scene for the GratefUl Dead. Their non
stop touring and fantastic live jams have in
spired college students since the band's con
ception in the late sixties. Today, while the
Dead still tours, there's a new outcropping of
bands with similar musical ideas: long extend
ed jams blending a variety of musical styles.
You've probably heard the Spin Doctors
(how could you avoid them?), but their long
time companion and predecessor, the har
monica-driven Blues Traveler, has been
touring, jamming, and putting out albums
for the last five or so years, and has played
with the likes of the immortal Santana and
the Allman Brothers.
A particular standout in this touring vein
is Widespread Panic. Their music is fantas
tic, but hard to describe — sort of bluesy, sort
of rock and roll, sort of bluegrass, very south
ern and very cool.

Another
great is
Phi s h .
Their jazzy,
funky,
country,
bluesy rock
and roll
takes songs
twisting and
turning,
pulling the
listener to
places far
away and
unintelligi
ble and then

bringing them back home with a funkified
kick. There's no experience quite like seeing
Phish live. Besides being an extremely talent
ed musical group, they're just plain wacky.
Along with Phish and Widespread, there's
a horde (most of these bands have played in
the well-known HORDE tours of the past few
summers) of lesser known jamming bands
that to check out: Allgood, who recently
brought their Allman and Stevie Ray influ
enced jams to EBF, and the Hatters whose
"Live Thunderchicken" disc is an incredibly
groovy piece of work.
The Dave Mathews Band just made num
ber four in Rolling Stone's alternative music
chart, and their CD isn't even available on the
West Coast yet. Be sure to check them out:
Mathews' voice is reminiscent of a male Tracy
Chapman and his great guitar playing melds
well with his ftlnkengrtiven band (tenor, bass
and drums).

In a noisier vein
Are you sick of hearing Pearl Jam on the
radio every seven-and-a-

alf minutes? Has MTV
dulled your musical
taste with rapid-fire,
I boring music? Well,
if you're looking for
loud and fast music
to piss off the armies
of Whitney Houston
lovers in your house,
there are a lot of

losing any of the
distortion,
try Jaw
breaker.
This Bay
Area band
combines
great song
writing,
great lyrics,
lots of guitar
hooks, and a
slightly

melan
choly atti
tude. An
other amaz
ing Berkeley
pop-punk
band, Green
Day, appeals
more to the re
bellious teenag
er in everyone.
Superchunk is
another great
sing-along punk
band Their indie-

amazing bands you won't see on MTV. Here
are some places to start:
Fugazi is sort of a punk-rock supergroup,
made up of members of legendary punk out
fits like Minor Threat and Rites of Spring. But
Fugazi's music is slower, more restrained and
emotional, even artsy at times, yet still loud
enough to burn holes in your ears. Their live
shows are often likened to religious experi
ences.
Another D.C. band, Jawbox, puts out
consistently good music in the same vein. Its
intensity, live and recorded, is simply hard to
believe. Drive Like Jehu is another mar
velous band in this genre; their music is often
even more varied than Fugazi.
If you really want to annoy your room
mate, try Sonic Youth. Despite the band's
name, it have been around for ten years. The
combination of heavy guitars, fuzz, noise and
psychedelia is unlike anything else. Many
people will say, "Ugh! That's just noise!" They
don't get it — that's the point.
For a more melodic, poppy sound without

rock
roots show
up in their
impressive
lyrics and
garage
esque sound.

On the other
side of mixed in-

fluence bands is
Beck. Beck's twisted
mix of

rock,
rap,
blues
and

coun
try has been charming

the L.A. scene for years, and he
just made it to the major label big
time with his single on Bong Load
records: "Loser." When this song hit the air
waves, labels couldn't get enough of him.
Check out his release "Mellow Gold," and
the CD single for "Loser" 'cause it has four
sweet B-sides.
So whether you seek college bands to suit
that Grateful Dead or Rolling Stones or
Pearl Jam craving, there are plenty of choic
es out there — just follow the college trail. ■
