# The 						spinanes moving up without a map
## 
### 
At the beginning of this year, the
Spinanes proved that blissful cracks
do exist in the monolith of style that is
college music when their debut album
"Manos" hit number one on the oh-so-influ
ential CMJ alternative music chart. This il
lustrious distinction, usually reserved for
"cool" major label acts like the Breeders or
Smashing Pumpkins, vaulted this two-piece,
independent label Portland band from rela-

tive obscurity to
that position of

"rock messi
ah."

Yet if any
band is deserv
ing of the at
tention and
acclaim that

comes with

"being number one,"

that band is the Spinanes. They

play some of the most compelling music
to hit the scene in recent memory. Certainly,
it's not mindless, recycled rage —
Vocalist / guitarist Rebecca Gates and drum
mer Scott Plouf blend their talents together
seamlessly, weaving together raw-edged gui
tar, articulate vocals and hard-hitting percus
sion to paint a striking tableau of twen
tysomething anxiety.
No expectations
Plus, it's good to see genuinely nice people
come out on top for a change. As clich£d as it
sounds, the Spinanes remain a level-headed,
down-to-earth outfit. While they are natu
rally pleased with what's happening, it seems
the Spinanes themselves can't figure out what
the buzz is about.
"It was really great to see an indie number
one. Not to be anti-major label, but it was
great to be the first Sub-Pop band to ever
reach number one. That made me really
happy," Gates says.

"But there were no expectations. We put
out two singles and short two-week tours
[before "Manos."] We knew people liked us,
so we just put out an album. [Placing at num
ber one] came out of the blue."
Although they've done what no other
Sub-Pop band (whose lineup has boasted the
likes of the Afghan Whigs, Sebadoh and Nir
vana) has ever done, a streak of hu
mility still runs

through the Spinane ethic. Rather than play
ing up to the hype, Gates downplays the
whirlpool of attention in which the band has
been swept up recently. For her, recognition
from the tight-knit core of music fans is more
than enough.
"I'm glad that this community of people
who listen to music like us. That's nice," Gates
relates. "It's mostly nice. We don't ignore it,
but we don't pay a lot of attention either. That
way, we don't get big heads or put a lot of
pressure [on ourselves]."
"Peggy Lee meets the Jesus Lizard"
While the band's "aw, shucks" attitude is a
refreshing break from self-important bands
of the day, it's the duo's amazing music which
makes their rise so fulfilling. Although their
music is powerful in its simplicity, it's diffi
cult to pin down the Spinanes' spin on pop
music. Even Gates herself can't seem to find
the right words to capture her own art.
"It's always hard to describe our music. To
my dad's friends, 1 always tell them we play
'alternative rock'," Gates tells. "We do what
we do and look for what sounds g00d....
But now [with all the attention], we think
about how to describe it."

Still, Gates throws out a description,
calling it the point where "Peggy Lee
meets the Jesus Lizard." Or in sim
i _ . . i_ i j _ r ••

pie terms, a blend of poppy jin
gle and hard punk edge. She

describes it even more simply
when she says, "It's a two-

person rock band play
ing melodic pop rock."

Yet one listen to
"Manos" separates the
Spinanes from those

counterparts who play
trivial ear candy or

make sound for
sound's sake. Unlike
any band around, the

Spinanes possess an
uncanny ability to hit

the right notes. The
composition of each

song is impeccable.
Plouf's precise

drumming adds a
distinctive sound

that does more
than merely

keep a beat.

Gates is a
spitfire on

guitar, making more frenetic noise than
many bands with two guitarists and a
bassist do. Yet she also knows when to pull
back the guitar effects and let her huskily
smooth voice come to the forefront.
"Manos" provides quite a showcase of
mid-tempo charmers; each song is well
crafted, a synthesis of raw guitar crunch,
pounding drums and beautifully-delivered,
intelligently-penned vocals.

There s always a gem of
wit to be found amidst the
wonderful sound-

scape. For in
stance, Gates
deftly calls out
"You're hung up
on it / You're hung
up in it / You're
hung up on her"
as part of the
chorus in the
single "Manos."

And when she absurdly asks "Would you
give up punk / For Lent?" in "Noel, Jonah
and Me," it sticks in your head for a while.
What works works
Still, many who've heard the Spinanes
harp on what's missing rather than what's
there — namely, the absence of a bass play
er. It's no surprise that the band takes this
critique in stride. Gates tells of a bass-play
ing fan who laid bass parts over the tracks
on "Manos." And of the theory that some
listeners subconsciously here subsonic bass
rhythms on the album. But, in all serious
ness, Gates doesn't see a need for a bass play
er just because everyone else has one.
"There was no conscious decision to use
guitar and drums. Originally, we said 'Let's
find people,' but we didn't find anyone and
decided to stay with just the two of us," Gates
explains.
"Anyway, the only reason people expect a
bass is that they've become used to it. It's just
because they're conditioned to it."
Simply put, the Spinanes like the freedom
to do what they want the way they want. In
the case of adding a bass player or other in
struments in the future, they'll only do it if
sounds good and if it works in the group dy
namic. It goes the same way with future plans
in general: as Gates puts it, they're slow on
setting objectives for themselves.
"There was no plan behind anything. It
just happened," Gates philosophizes. "It's so
weird. I never thought I would write songs. I
just wanted to make music, i thought I'd like
to make music."
In the meantime, the Spinanes will go
wherever their rented Ford Aerostar takes
them, touring parts of the United States for
the next month or so. Beyond that, the
Spinanes aren't about to prophecy what the
future holds. Only two things are certain:
Gates' resolution to spend extra time practic
ing and the promise of more mind-blowing
melodies.
"It's pretty much natural writing songs.
There's no schedule. Sometimes, I'll come up
with them while driving or in the shower,"
Gates explains with a chuckle.
"While it's not hard writing songs, it's hard
to write good songs. Trying to make sure that
a song means something can be hard."

The fantastic Spinanes will be making yet an
other Bay Area appearance Friday, March 18,
this time with the fabulous Liz Phair at the fa
mous Warfield.
