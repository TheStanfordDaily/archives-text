# mind over music when brain and band collide Arnold Pan and Joey Rosenblum

COLLEGE ROCK is in a
state of flux. At any
time, new talent and
new ideas can make it to the top
of the scene. The '90s have gone
back to basics â€” natural guitars
and raw vocals. As a result, real
emotion and real thought em
anate from real music made by
real people playing real instru
ments. These two bands, the
Spinanes and Jeff Buckley epit
omize this movement. They cut
back on the gimmicky produc
tion tricks and let intelligent
lyrics and smartly-composed
music shine on their own: the

Spinanes consist simply of a
guitarist/singer and drummer
and Buckley s first EP features
him solo, singing and playing
guitar. Is this "Smart Rock" a
trend? Maybe: both bands have
caught the attention of mass
media. The Spinanes recently
reached number one on the
CM J college music chart and
Buckley has recently graced the
pages of major magazines and
has been asked to model in a
Gap ad. Their music evokes
emotion and provokes
thought. It is music not simply
to hear; it's music to listen to.
