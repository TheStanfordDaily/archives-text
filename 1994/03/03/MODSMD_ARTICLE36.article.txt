# jeff Buckley a song about a dream
## 
### 
On the phone from his hotel room in
New Jersey (why are up-and-coming
musicians always reached in hotels?),
Jeff Buckley yawns. It's already noon but he's
still recovering from last night's gig and get
ting ready for another show tonight.
His first full album is three days away from
completion on the recording side, and his
name is already coming up on the pages of
such industry rags as Spin, Rolling Stone and
Musician.

Who is this new singer whose voice
sends tingles like the chimes of a cash

register up the backs of
label presidents? He's the
spawn of high school love

and artistic abandon — son
of folk great Tim Buckley and

his high school sweetheart.
Jeff was raised in southern
California, where he gigged

with reggae and rock bands. He later moved
to New York, which he considers his true
home.
"I was misplaced as an infant, 1 was horn
in the wrong city. The seasons change, there's
a sense of age and depth in New York that 1
don't find in southern California." This
karmic connection Buckley feels with New
York illustrates the spiritual connection he
feels with his music.
Gods and Monsters
When he first arrived on the New York
scene, he took up with ex-Captain Beefheart
guitar player Gary Lucas and a rhythm sec
tion of Tony Maimone and Anton Fier, who
had been touring with Bob Mould.
This incarnation, Gods and Monsters,
developed somewhat of a name around the
New York underground and was being
heavily scouted by numerous major and
indie labels.
Buckley quietly tells the story of their
breakup before any sort of record deal could
be consummated: " The only conflict arose
when (Lucas] wanted to do it as a full time
thing. He wanted it to be like the Doors, a
real commitment, and I hadn't planned on
it. I didn't want to get married so quickly."
So Buckley picked up his guitar and
reigned in his voice and took them to town,
literally playing solo in small coffee shops
and cafes throughout Greenwich Village.
His bluesy, spiritual guitar phrases wrap
around and complement his nearly perfect
voice: high, fine, tender yet piercing, soulful
and dedicated.
He started the New York circuit playing a
number of covers (better called interpreta
tions) and a handful of originals. This was a
searching time for Buckley, and he says he
learned a great deal from playing these in
terpretations.
"There was something I felt was missing
from me. So I decided to totally tear my self
apart and build myself back up again from
the inside, and just to shut the hell up about
anything I thought I knew about music and
just ask my teachers from inside the songs,
so that 1 could come exactly from within
myself."
Some people say that he inherited his fa
ther's voice and that he broke into the New
York scene when he played ut a tribute to his
father at a venue called St. Anne's. Buckley
tells it slightly differently.
"I didn't do it to break into the scene at
all. I didn't even want to be billed, I didn't
want to be noticed. I only did that because I

wasn't invited to the funeral. I never got to
pay my respects." The specter of his father,
however, is not haunting his shining new
career. "It only haunts the minds of people
who are hungry for the past."
Singing the blues
While '80s popular music rejected a lot of
the blues influence that touched the '70s,
the '90s are again embracing this stray
theme. While his music

won't be filed under the

"Blues" section

at Tower, Buckley ad-

mires blues greats like
Robert Johnson and Bessie Smith.

"They transmitted their own experience
in a song they built line upon line. It was real
— there was not a drop of it that missed. It
was the life of the man, the life of the
woman. That's what 1 wanted to get into, in
my own way." Jeff tries to capture some of
this experience in his songs. "It's got a beat
to it, a pulse to it, the heart of the person is
totally flying up above that — and that's
what makes you dance, and that's what I
wanted to touch."
His debut EF on Sony, "Live at Sin-e"
(pronounced Shin-eh) features Buckley
solo, wailing original and interpreted
melodies with his guitar and lungs. From
the dreamy original (co-written by Gary
Lucas) "Mojo Fin" to his phenomenal and
unexpected scat solo in Van Morrison's
"The Way Young Lovers Do," the EE's tour
tracks demonstrate Buckley's musical
prowess and rare ability to infuse his music
with emotion — and it provides a hopeful
glimpse of bright things to come.
On his studio album, simply titled "Jeff
Buckley," to be released in June, Buckley
branches back into the band realm. He

hooked up with drummer Matt Johnson
through friends, but bassist Mick Grondahl
came to him.
"Mick walked up to me at a gig and said
he really wanted to work with me," Buckley
says. "One of the main purposes of playing
at places like Sin-£ was to attract the right
people to play with. I'm not really a solo
artist at heart. It's a great thing to do, and
there are great lessons to be learned from it,
but for me it's about the relationship when
you see a really good band."
Buckley's enormous talent combined

with young
James Dean
looks that have
gotten him
modeling of
fers from such
well-knowns

as the Gap
(which he

turned down) made

him a super hot property on
the music meat market. Limousines and
suits were regular arrivals at his Sin-e and
Knitting Factory gigs during the summer of
1992.
In what he calls "a complete dilemma"
Buckley ended up signing with Sony. While
it may present an ethical paradox, starting
out on a major label has had its advantages
for Buckley — like having his first FF and LF
produced by Andy Wallace, who has mixed
Soul Asylum, Guns N' Roses and Nirvana.
Buckley's songs embrace dreams, life,
death and love. As he himself is a complex
individual, his songs unfold to the listener
on many levels: musical, spiritual, emotion
al and intellectual.
In addition to his guitar and voice is a
highly intelligent Buckley who cracks jokes,
looks objectively at life and digs Beavis and
Butt-head. It may take a number of albums
(remember REM?), and while he's not going
to go the MTV route for now ("a video is a
commercial for an album"), his music is
sure to be winning the hearts and minds of
America's twenty-something soul searchers
and intellectuals for years to come. ■

through friends, but bassist Mick Grondahl
came to him.
"Mick walked up to me at a gig and said
he really wanted to work with me," Buckley
says. "One of the main purposes of playing
at places like Sin-£ was to attract the right
people to play with. I'm not really a solo
artist at heart. It's a great thing to do, and
there are great lessons to be learned from it,
but for me it's about the relationship when
you see a really good band."
Buckley's enormous talent combined

with young
James Dean
looks that have
gotten him
modeling of
fers from such
well-knowns

as the Gap
(which he

turned down) made

him a super hot property on
the music meat market. Limousines and
suits were regular arrivals at his Sin-e and
Knitting Factory gigs during the summer of
1992.
In what he calls "a complete dilemma"
Buckley ended up signing with Sony. While
it may present an ethical paradox, starting
out on a major label has had its advantages
for Buckley — like having his first FF and LF
produced by Andy Wallace, who has mixed
Soul Asylum, Guns N' Roses and Nirvana.
Buckley's songs embrace dreams, life,
death and love. As he himself is a complex
individual, his songs unfold to the listener
on many levels: musical, spiritual, emotion
al and intellectual.
In addition to his guitar and voice is a
highly intelligent Buckley who cracks jokes,
looks objectively at life and digs Beavis and
Butt-head. It may take a number of albums
(remember REM?), and while he's not going
to go the MTV route for now ("a video is a
commercial for an album"), his music is
sure to be winning the hearts and minds of
America's twenty-something soul searchers
and intellectuals for years to come. ■

On the phone from his hotel room in
New Jersey (why are up-and-coming
musicians always reached in hotels?),
Jeff Buckley yawns. It's already noon but he's
still recovering from last night's gig and get
ting ready for another show tonight.
His first full album is three days away from
completion on the recording side, and his
name is already coming up on the pages of
such industry rags as Spin, Rolling Stone and
Musician.

Who is this new singer whose voice
sends tingles like the chimes of a cash

register up the backs of
label presidents? He's the
spawn of high school love

and artistic abandon — son
of folk great Tim Buckley and

his high school sweetheart.
Jeff was raised in southern
California, where he gigged

with reggae and rock bands. He later moved
to New York, which he considers his true
home.
"I was misplaced as an infant, 1 was horn
in the wrong city. The seasons change, there's
a sense of age and depth in New York that 1
don't find in southern California." This
karmic connection Buckley feels with New
York illustrates the spiritual connection he
feels with his music.
Gods and Monsters
When he first arrived on the New York
scene, he took up with ex-Captain Beefheart
guitar player Gary Lucas and a rhythm sec
tion of Tony Maimone and Anton Fier, who
had been touring with Bob Mould.
This incarnation, Gods and Monsters,
developed somewhat of a name around the
New York underground and was being
heavily scouted by numerous major and
indie labels.
Buckley quietly tells the story of their
breakup before any sort of record deal could
be consummated: " The only conflict arose
when (Lucas] wanted to do it as a full time
thing. He wanted it to be like the Doors, a
real commitment, and I hadn't planned on
it. I didn't want to get married so quickly."
So Buckley picked up his guitar and
reigned in his voice and took them to town,
literally playing solo in small coffee shops
and cafes throughout Greenwich Village.
His bluesy, spiritual guitar phrases wrap
around and complement his nearly perfect
voice: high, fine, tender yet piercing, soulful
and dedicated.
He started the New York circuit playing a
number of covers (better called interpreta
tions) and a handful of originals. This was a
searching time for Buckley, and he says he
learned a great deal from playing these in
terpretations.
"There was something I felt was missing
from me. So I decided to totally tear my self
apart and build myself back up again from
the inside, and just to shut the hell up about
anything I thought I knew about music and
just ask my teachers from inside the songs,
so that 1 could come exactly from within
myself."
Some people say that he inherited his fa
ther's voice and that he broke into the New
York scene when he played ut a tribute to his
father at a venue called St. Anne's. Buckley
tells it slightly differently.
"I didn't do it to break into the scene at
all. I didn't even want to be billed, I didn't
want to be noticed. I only did that because I

wasn't invited to the funeral. I never got to
pay my respects." The specter of his father,
however, is not haunting his shining new
career. "It only haunts the minds of people
who are hungry for the past."
Singing the blues
While '80s popular music rejected a lot of
the blues influence that touched the '70s,
the '90s are again embracing this stray
theme. While his music

won't be filed under the

"Blues" section

at Tower, Buckley ad-

mires blues greats like
Robert Johnson and Bessie Smith.

"They transmitted their own experience
in a song they built line upon line. It was real
— there was not a drop of it that missed. It
was the life of the man, the life of the
woman. That's what 1 wanted to get into, in
my own way." Jeff tries to capture some of
this experience in his songs. "It's got a beat
to it, a pulse to it, the heart of the person is
totally flying up above that — and that's
what makes you dance, and that's what I
wanted to touch."
His debut EF on Sony, "Live at Sin-e"
(pronounced Shin-eh) features Buckley
solo, wailing original and interpreted
melodies with his guitar and lungs. From
the dreamy original (co-written by Gary
Lucas) "Mojo Fin" to his phenomenal and
unexpected scat solo in Van Morrison's
"The Way Young Lovers Do," the EE's tour
tracks demonstrate Buckley's musical
prowess and rare ability to infuse his music
with emotion — and it provides a hopeful
glimpse of bright things to come.
On his studio album, simply titled "Jeff
Buckley," to be released in June, Buckley
branches back into the band realm. He

hooked up with drummer Matt Johnson
through friends, but bassist Mick Grondahl
came to him.
"Mick walked up to me at a gig and said
