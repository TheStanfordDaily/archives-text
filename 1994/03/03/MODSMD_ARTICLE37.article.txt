# Ravaged days, 'Savage Nights'
## French movie tells graphic story of AIDS and love 
### 
Take Tom Hanks' character from
"Philadelphia." Teach him French and put
him in Paris with a job as a film technician.
Make him bisexual and throw in images of
every deviant behavior you can think of, from
sadomasochism to menage-a-trois. Finally,
give him a soul.
You have just created Jean, the main char
acter in the French film "Savage Nights"
There are now two types of movies about
AIDS. One is the sterile treatment that tem
pers any serious discussion with ludicrous
"family values" scenes that merely subvert any
real issues. The resultant movie is basically ir
relevant with various poignant gestures that
seem almost accidental.
The other type plunges into the world of
an HIV-positive patient and makes a film
about a life haunted by AIDS. Where the first
type continues to give AIDS victims a consol
ing pat on the back with surgeon's gloves, the
other attempts to caress the dying in the only
humane way possible — skin to skin.
Having said that, "Savage Nights" is not
the great movie French critics accredited it as
by burying the film with Cesars (the French
Oscars), including Best Picture. One must
wonder if Cyril Collard (the film's director,
writer and lead actor) had not died of AIDS
soon before the voting whether the same stu
pendous results would have been achieved.
The film is autobiographical, based on Col
lard's novel of the same name. Jean's under
standably realistic character hops from one
sexual situation to another in active denial of
his resident virus. Perhaps he thinks if his lethal
disease can not curtail his actions, it does not
exist. As Jean sings, he is "A large bird who has
lost his memory / But is still greedy for life."
His ravenous lust for life entangles the

films two other major characters, Samy (Car
los Lopez) and 17-year-old Laura (Romane
Bohringer). Their love for Jean becomes a
noose, driving Samy to sadomasochism and
Laura to a comic yet destructive ultra-jeal
ousy. Throughout the movie, the specter of
AIDS colors the canvas, like "a stranger
watching our every move."
The film's greatest success lies in the audi
ence's reaction to lean. He has sex with Laura
without telling her of his disease and then is
off to a bridge beside the Seine, where the sex
is anonymous and painted with hellish ambi
guity. In his insatiable desire to live, Jean
seems not to care who he kills.
Yet the audience is torn between moral
condemnation and perverse encouragement.
His actions, albeit reprehensible, are under
standable in context. The film engenders A
Clockwork Orange-esque fear of oneself —
what type of person am I to sympathize with
this ethical misanthrope?
Collard has his moments. The images are
stirring and provoking: from Laura's removal
of Jean's condom after learning of his "wast
ing away" to Samy's swift self-mutilation with
a knife followed by an ample alcohol shower.
At one point Jean is begging an unknown
partner to urinate on him. At another he pre
vents a beating by threatening the assailants
with the most feared of bodily fluids, the
blood of an AIDS patient. All these scenes
force the audience not to turn away, but to
consider sympathetically subjects that society
has not given us the tools to understand.
But Collard presents a canvas replete with
powerful images sans canvas. They lack unity.
We are bounced from one peephole to anoth
er without any thread to follow. Collard fails
in packaging — the components are there,

but their placement is haphazard and, in
some cases, ridiculous.
Thus, some moments are lost in the mud
dle. With so much scenery sweeping across
the screen so quickly, one is unable to entirely
grasp any particular section. Collard's dia
monds, though beautiful, become merely
gaudy in his tennis-bracelet of a movie.
"Philadelphia" is probably the best and
worst thing that could have happened for
"Savage Nights." Collard's film, in compari

son, changes from okay to amazing by being
able to give depth to characters director
Jonathan Demme merely drew on the screen.
Yet Collard has no trial by jury, no vehicle to
move from one moment to another.
Thus, we are left in the catacombs with no
magic thread to follow. In our wanderings we
get vivid glimpses of the hideous creature, yet
we are never guided to a confrontation of the
AIDS minotaur.
