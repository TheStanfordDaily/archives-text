8 Seconds

Luke Perry at the rodeo? It sounds like an
unlikely combination, but the "90210" pretty
boy is surprisingly good as Lane Frost, world
champion bull rider. He's lanky, he's hand
some, he's naive, and his Oklahoma accent is
perfectly consistent. "8 Seconds" is a well
conceived, nicely acted glimpse into the dusty
world of the rodeo circuit.
Director John Avildsen ("Rocky," "The
Karate Kid") resists the temptation to turn

this true story into a
sappy melodrama.
Lane is no angel, but
he is still a genuinely
appealing guy. Fa
ther Clyde (James
Rebhorn) is hard on
his son, trying to re
live his 1968 World
Rodeo Champi
onship through him.
Little Lane soon
performs up to ex
pectations, winning
circuit competitions
with his friends Tuff
(Stephen Baldwin)

and Cody (Red Mitchell). Then he falls for a
cute but distant blonde barrel rider, Kellie
(Cynthia Geary).
The rodeo sequences are great. Perry did a
lot of his own stunts with the help of real-life
Tuff and Kellie. And bull riding is a pretty
grueling sport. The rider must stay on top of
an angry bull for eight seconds while holding
the mount with one hand. The camera angles
in these scenes add lots of visual interest and
they build well into the climactic final ride.
There are lots of nice touches. When Lane
takes his first hard fall and considers quitting,
Tuff abuses him at first and then abruptly
leaves him with the advice "cowboy up."
And that he does. Lane goes on to get the
girl, the championship and his dream. How
ever, there is dark side to his success as he
finds himself estranged from his wife Kellie
even as he begins to come to terms with his
dad. But he does come to his senses.
Perhaps the results are a little obvious. The
same touches that provide the movie with
such great continuity make the ending rela
tively transparent. Bull riding is a dangerous
sport and all champions know it
Ultimately, u 8 Seconds" is a charming
movie with broad-based appeal and it is a re
spectable addition to the current Hollywood
country-western genre.

The Getaway

Although "The Getaway" proves to be a
good action/thriller, it's only worth the price
of admission and not much more.
The movie's problem lies in its predictabil
ity. When watching this film, one is struck
with a sense of deja vu — it's a remake of the
1972 film of the same name, which starred
Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw.
This time, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger
take on the lead roles. Baldwin plays Doc
McCoy, an "honest" criminal who is trying to
"go straight." As Carol McCoy, Basinger is his
beautiful wife, a devoted partner-in-crime
who'll do anything to help her man.
When Doc finds himself in a Mexican jail,
it's up to shady operator Jack Benyon (James
Woods) to get him out. Benyon carries out
his task, although the movie never explains
how.
Of course, there's a catch. Doc must per
form his next heist for Benyon. After some
double-crossing, more unsavory characters
enter the picture, ending in a dramatic, west
ern-style shoot-out in a cheap El Paso hotel.
The essence of "The Getaway" is McCoys
attempt to take the money and run back to
Mexico. Although there are a couple of plot
twists, there's little doubt, from start to finish,

who'll end up with the cash.
Still, the movie never loses the audience's
attention. Director Roger Donaldson ("No
Way Out," "Cocktail") does a competent job
guiding the action.
All around the performances were strong.
Woods plays his bad guy part well. Basinger
also does a convincing job as the doting wife.
Particularly convincing is the relentless ban
ter between her and Baldwin. I wonder why?
However, it's Baldwin who steals the show.
Although his McCoy doesn't match up to the
performance he gave in last year's excellent
"Malice," Baldwin captures the spirit of the
petty thief superbly.
Overall, "The Getaway" is an above-par
action film. And you'll have fun with it — if
you don't expect too much.
