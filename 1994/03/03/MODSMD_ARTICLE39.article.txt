# Expectations and rewards
## Pavement delights fans with long-awaited new release 
### 
For die-hard Pavement followers, the two
years between the band's debut LP "Slanted
and Enchanted" and the release of a new
album "Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain" have
been filled with great anticipation.
That wait has been accentuated by small
morsels offered by the band. But one EP and
one compilation of earlier works only in
creased expectations.
Plus, there are the volumes of embarrass
ingly good press Pavement has been given.
When it seems everything's already been said
about the band, it's tough to do it justice.
For example, if you've read the reviews in
Rolling Stone or Spin you might expect me to
talk about how great they are, how they're the
next big thing, how you have to rush out and
buy this album!
But, I won't.
In fact it's probably better if not to rush
(just an instance of approval cheaply dis
guised as a warning). My admiration for
Pavement has built up in momentum over
the last two years of repeated listenings.
An admission: Pavement has done more
for my values than CIV. It's not the case of
"Join Greenpeace" or "20 facts about pot."
It's all the questions they have me asking.
Something so simple as "What was that
lyric? What does that mean?" translates
into "What was that thought? What do I
mean?"
I>ead singer and guitarist Stephen Malk
mus' words walk the border between obscure
stream-of-consciousness and poetry in sim
plicity. When he pines, "It's simple stuff I
need / Can't you see?" at the end of "Newark
Wilder," he echoes concerns that are all too
familiar.

Pavement's sophistication lies in the way
in which the band's members go about dis
secting their own medium through a process
of appropriation, allusion and self-reflec
tion. Theirs is an exercise in identity. But they
seem so aware of what they're doing, what
they're writing. They're so sincere in the
search for a new standard.
In short, Pavement recycles rock and roll.
"Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain" questions the
integrity of the music industry directly. In
this aspect it is a departure from their previ
ous work.
Pavement fuses so many beautiful ele
ments together into a staggering progression
of melody, melodrama and mistake, and it
works like a charm. The members have deliv
ered style, style, style. They have so many
lyrics, lines, riffs and moments that are so
sweet and striking.
The song "Stop Breathin"' requires a
moment of silence — then it is understand
able. If you asked me what the lyrics are all
about, fragments come to mind. "Lies and
betrayals," expectations and rewards, high
school football, spies, rock and roll, dash
boards, all Fit nicely under the blanket of
American life.
"Silence Kid" alone combines elements
from the '70s country rock of Creedence
Clearwater Revival with '50s and '60s pop
ballads. "Heaven is a Truck" also gives a nod
to the past, with its echoes of "Loaded"-era
Velvet Underground. The lyrics of "Unfair"
sound like a new version of "America the
Beautiful" mixed with the Velvets' "Heroin."
Only, this time the addiction is credit cards
and the stage is California.
The instrumental "5-4=Unity" sounds

like a lounge act. And "Range Life" has a
country sensibility, which again is particular
ly American. Cowboys, rock stars, marriages
and divorces, careers (or is it Korea?) all make
appearances. The back cover even sports a
picture of a bald eagle.
The album ends appropriately with "Fill
more Jive" as a finishing commentary on the
life of rock, in the spirit of their earlier "Shoot
the Singer" off the "Watery, Domestic" EF.
Except "don't expect" has become "say good
night to the rock and roll era." The line "I

need to sleep / Why won't you let me?" is
sung with such a perfect mixture of drama
and sarcasm that it is hard to know how to
react. The song is a loaded lullaby.
Ours is the "loser era" littered with un
needed fans, distracted composers, empty
stars and empty lives. In spite of all the con
fusion Pavement characterizes the search for
solace. As Pavement sings on "Watery, Do
mestic," "This pattern's torn and we're weav
in.
