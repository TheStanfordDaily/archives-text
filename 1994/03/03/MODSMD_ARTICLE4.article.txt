# Law Prof. Gould gets confirmed for NLRB
## Senate finally OKs nomination to top labor post 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Law Prof. William Gould began packing
his bags for Washington, D.C. yesterday after
the Senate confirmed his long-delayed nomi
nation to chair the National Labor Relations
Board.
President Clinton nominated Gould for
the position last June, but the nomination
was initially blocked by Republicans and
some southern Democrats who objected to
the nominee's apparent "pro-union" stance.
"I'm pleased that a majority of the Senate
did the job that should have been done long
ago," Gould said. "Today's victory was over a
campaign of cynical character assassination
and lies from elements of the Republican
party and some businesses."
Gould will be the first African-American
chairman of the board, which acts like a court
for union representation disputes, deciding
unfair-practice suits and monitoring union
elections.
Yesterday's 58-38 vote reflected unani
mous support from the Democrats present

and the votes of Republican Sens. Bob Pack
wood of Oregon and James Jeffords of Ver
mont. The negative votes all came from Re-

publicans. Four senators
did not vote.
Gould, who will take a
leave of absence from the
Law School, said he intends
to leave for Washington
next week with his primary
aim "to bring the board
back to the center."
"There needs to be bal
ance and fairness to all

sides and that is my main goal," he said. "I
think there are a number of complex issues in
front of us and there are likely to be a number
more in the future."
Gould has taught at Stanford since 1972
and has served as an arbitrator and a media
tor for more than 30 years. He also served on
the labor board during the 19605.
Dean of the Law School Paul Brest ap
plauded Gould's confirmation. "He's going to


Gould
be superb," he said. "It's just hard
to imagine some one better quali
fied for the position."
While adding that Gould would
be missed at the Law School, Brest
said his departure isn't unexpected
because of the length of the nomi
nation process. "It's going to create
a gap which we will try to fill until
he returns," Brest added.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg
added to the praise, while criticiz
ing the Senate for the long delay

of Gould's nomination. "He's
been working toward it all his life.
He's a great labor lawyer. He's a
great labor scholar," Weisberg
said. "It was absolutely ridiculous
it took so long to confirm him.
And it was even more ridiculous
that there were 38 votes against
him.
"Bill Gould is not at all ideologi
cal. He wins a lot of respect from
management for being extremely
fair," Weisberg added. "It's just one
of those things where a few sena
tors and a few staff members of
senators decided to make this a big
issue when in fact his confirma
tions should have been unani

mous."
In addition to Gould, two other
nominees to the board — Philadel
phia labor lawyer Margaret Brown
ing, a Democrat, and Washington
D.C. management attorney
Charles Cohen, a Republican —
were confirmed yesterday. Fred
Feinstein, counsel to the House
Education and Labor labor-man
agement subcommittee, will be the
board's general counsel.
The board consists of five mem
bers, split three to two along party
lines. Since November the board
has retained only two members,
and therefore has been unable to
function.
