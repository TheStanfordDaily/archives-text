### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Law Prof. William Gould began packing
his bags for Washington, D.C. yesterday after
the Senate confirmed his long-delayed nomi
nation to chair the National Labor Relations
Board.
President Clinton nominated Gould for
the position last June, but the nomination
was initially blocked by Republicans and
some southern Democrats who objected to
the nominee's apparent "pro-union" stance.
"I'm pleased that a majority of the Senate
did the job that should have been done long
ago," Gould said. "Today's victory was over a
campaign of cynical character assassination
and lies from elements of the Republican
party and some businesses."
Gould will be the first African-American
chairman of the board, which acts like a court
for union representation disputes, deciding
unfair-practice suits and monitoring union
elections.
Yesterday's 58-38 vote reflected unani
mous support from the Democrats present

and the votes of Republican Sens. Bob Pack
wood of Oregon and James Jeffords of Ver
mont. The negative votes all came from Re-

publicans. Four senators
did not vote.
Gould, who will take a
leave of absence from the
Law School, said he intends
to leave for Washington
next week with his primary
aim "to bring the board
back to the center."
"There needs to be bal
ance and fairness to all

sides and that is my main goal," he said. "I
think there are a number of complex issues in
front of us and there are likely to be a number
more in the future."
Gould has taught at Stanford since 1972
and has served as an arbitrator and a media
tor for more than 30 years. He also served on
the labor board during the 19605.
Dean of the Law School Paul Brest ap
plauded Gould's confirmation. "He's going to
