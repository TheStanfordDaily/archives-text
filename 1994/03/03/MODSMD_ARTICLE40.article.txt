"Blunted On Reality"
Fugees

The rap music scene has exploded with
various new artists such as Onyx and Snoop,
who have come out strong and original with
their very first effort. I lowever, the Fugees are
not in the same class — in fact, they have
flunked out of the new school.

Only two songs on this 17-track album are
even worth a second listen. "Some Seek Star
dom" is the one shining star of the album. It
actually has good lyrics and music, a concept
that the Fugees seem to have a hard time try-

ing to identify with.
The song masterfully
blasts those who
"seek stardom / and
then forget Harlem."
The song "Vocab"
isn't that bad because
of the music in the
background. Con
gratulations to the
guitar player who
rescued the song
from the sorry con
dition shared by the

other selections.
It is probably no accident that "Some Seek
Stardom" is the only song on the album that
group members Prakazrel and Wyclef didn't
try to produce. 1 would say they should stick
to rapping, but they couldn't do that very
well either. Their voices are nothing special
and neither are their lyrics.
"Some Seek Stardom" jams because it isn't
inhibited by the voices of this untalented
duo. It features the voice of the one female
member, Lauryn, who also helped some of
the many needy tracks. She is the talented
one of the group. Apparently, she is the one
with the voice and lyrical ability. She could
have a future if only she ditched the other two
and found some real producers.
The worst part of the project was the final
track "Shout Outs From the Block," which is
just what it sounds like — endless shouts to
their friends and families — which I'm sure
is no great honor since few people will even
give this album the time of day.
This album is definitely not worth the
purchase, but the single, "Some Seek Star
dom" is worth the record store price. Howev
er, if it isn't released, don't lose any sleep over
it. Just hope that Lauryn wakes up and goes
solo.

"Some Old Bullshit"
Beastie Boys

It may come as a surprise to early Beastie
Boys fans that the band had its roots in rau
cous hard-core, not club-friendly funk or
hip-hop. "Some Old Bullshit" collects the
Beasties' two earliest HP's, now out of print,
and some live cuts, and the results are mixed.
The album begins with a terrific live cut
recorded from a 1982 underground radio
show. Ferocious and static laden, the
minute-long "Egg Raid on Mojo" is a frenet
ic blip of punk rock. Sheer energy carries the
song more than musical complexity (there is
none) or thought provoking lyrics (can't
hear any).
The next eight tracks were released as the
Polly Wog Stew EP. Recorded in *82 on the
second floor of a New York music store called
"Rat Cage," these songs are hyper-active tes
taments to early '80s hard-core. Most sound
alike and blur together. "Jimi" stands out
with its opening restless groove, a precursor
to the funky brilliance of 1992's "Check Your
Head." "Riot Fight" is the most frenetic of
the bunch, recalling Minor Threat and early
Bad Brains. These songs work in their total

lack of pretense. They are punk at its best —
fast, tight and unremittingly rebellious.
"Michelle's Farm" begins like some kind
of out-take from "Hee-Haw" with a coun
try-esque washboard and acoustic guitar
and then descends into "Fuck the chickens I
don't like milk now fuck the chickens I don't
like milk / Barnyard stoats raid the pen if you
don't shoot them they'll do it again." This
early lyrical brilliance chronicles the anarchy
of farm life.
The rest of the album is garbage. The last
four tracks comprise the 1983 12" single
"Cooky Puss." It's a horrible, sell-out at
tempt at hip-hop. Recorded in a studio that,
according to head man Michael Diamond
(later known as Mike D), "didn't really have
the hard-core vibe," the songs gained popu
larity in the club scene and launched the
Beasties' career. "Cooky Puss" is offensive
and cheesy at the same time. "Beastie Revo
lution" is a lame attempt at reggae which
begs the question, how can white, New York
punk rockers with no hair possibly consider
themselves "rastafarians?"
In short, the first half of "Some Old Bull
shit" is thirteen minutes of great punk fun,
and the second half is no fun at all. It's worth
a listen for novelty sake.
