# Gombei: A taste of Tokyo
## Big portions and reasonable prices in a tranquil atmosphere 
### Lindsey Marcus 
Loud, unintelligible waiters. Fel
low Stanford students making fools
of themselves by doing sake bombs
on chairs. Smushed-up-against
the-wall seating. If these images im
mediately conjure up images of
Miyake's, maybe it's time for an al
ternative to the same old Japanese
food routine.
Gombei's, conveniently located
on El Camino in Menlo Park, serves
sizable portions in a somewhat
more mellow atmosphere than
Miyake's. Although it does not fea
ture as wide an array of sushi as
Miyake's does, the menu is large and
varied enough to allow anyone to
find a dish.
Gombei's open kitchen lets cus
tomers drool as they watch their
food being cooked. The restaurant is
well-lit, and is decorated in pleasant,

cheery tones. While it may not be
the best place for a quiet, romantic
anniversary dinner by candlelight,
most Stanford students don't find
that criteria important anyway.
The restaurant attracts a variety
of locals — families, Japanese and
students. It is definitely a safe choice
for parents' weekend (unless, of
course, you enjoy sake bomb com
petitions with mom and dad).
Whereas customers are accosted
by a noisy mix of Spanish and Japan
ese upon entering Miyake's, a friend
familiar with Tokyo said Gombei's
looks and feels much like a true
Japanese restaurant
Although the restaurant itself is
on the small side, it does not seem
crowded much of the time. Of
course, going early will help cut
down on waiting time, but at least

customers don't have to huddle out
side in the nippy California nights,
as they do at, say, Miyake's.
The service at Gombei's is both
quick and friendly — our food ap
peared just as soon as I got bored
watching the cooks make it. Also, the
price is right. Full meals cost between
$8-11 or so, and the sizes of the help
ings leave nothing to be desired.
Most full dinners come with two
types of beef, chicken, fish or pork, a
bowl of rice, salad, soup and tea.
Served on trays with numerous au
thentic bowls and plates, the food is
presented neatly and carefully.
However, certain dishes at
Gombei's are more worthy of raves
than others. Ordering well is the key
to a scrumptious meal. The Gombei
— a pork cutlet with choice of
chicken or fish — is deliriously pre-

pared. Also recom
mended is the don
buri, which is meat,
chicken or fish served
over rice.
The beef teriyaki,
while cooked well,
does not thrill the
taste buds as much as
some other dishes
will. The meat does
not seem to be of the
highest quality (but

don t worry — its not
like Food Service or anything). In
addition, the udon (Japanese noo
dles in soup broth) tastes somewhat
bland, despite the fact that a hefty
portion is served in what appears a
good-sized mixing bowl. But spices
and sauces should be available to
improve any taste that is not imme

diately delectable.
So if you're in the mood for a
change of pace, Gombei's might
provide just what the doctor or
dered. It may be a bit more of a trek
than Miyake's, but the extra five
minutes of travel time is definitely
worthwhile. ■
