### 
Ace Ventura, Pet Detective
As the star of a movie featuring a
predictable plot and bad acting,
comic Jim Carrey carries the bur
den of turning "Ace Ventura" from
another piece of trash into some
thing worth the price of a matinee
ticket. Although his wacky pet de
tective character wears thin at
points, Carrey succeeds in achiev
ing very modest goals. PG-13
The Accompanist
As the latest French film about
beautiful, tormented people in the
world of classical music, "The Ac
companist" proves to be an en
grossing stroll through that Never.
Never land. Still, any story set in
Nazi-occupied Paris should have
some historical focus. Unfortunate
ly, that reality is marginalized in this
bittersweet love story. PG
Blue Chips
You don't need to be a big-time
basketball fan to enjoy "Blue
Chips." Nick Nolte convincingly
plays the prototypic crazed basket
ball coach caught between ethics
and winning. The athletes chosen to
play parts do a good job playing
themselves. Of note is Shaquille
O'Neal's acting debut; the multi-

media monster does quite a good
job playing a sarcastic and clueless
character. PG-13
Body Snatchers
As a remake of a remake, one may
not expect to much going in. That's
probably a good idea: "Body
Snatchers" offers little more than a
good scream. On the whole, it's
pretty poor film, a far cry from direc
tor Abel Ferrara's last feature "The
Bad Lieutenant." It's showing at the
Varsity, but save yourself the trip. R
The Cement Garden
Surely, a movie about sibling sexual
relations raises many an eyebrow.
Vet "The Cement Garden" tells a far
from trite and sensationalistic story;
fine acting, appropriate settings and
a perfect score make for a beautiful
and haunting work of art. UNRATED
In the Name of the Father
Despite appearances by Academy
Award-winning actors Daniel Day-
Lewis and Emma Thompson, "In the
Name of the Father" rarely rises
above melodrama. Instead of focus
ing on how violence can destroy the
life of an everyman, director Jim
Sheridan takes on a well-worn per
spective, opting for courtroom

drama straight out of "L.A. Law" and
"Perry Mason." R
My Father the K?ro
Who wants to see ten minutes of
Gerard Depardieu water skiing? Per
haps the better question is who real
ly wants to see an hour and a half of
a silly, "Three's Company"-esque
romantic comedy? Even a cameo by
Emma Thompson and Depardieu's
trademark "French-dude-without-a
clue" expressions do little to help
this dog of a movie. PG
Reality Bites
So what if "Reality Bites" is another
movie about twenty-somethings
struggling in the post-college world?
Although no shining rays of wisdom
are revealed in the movie, "Reality
Bites" is a fun movie with a refresh
ing sense of humor. It's immediate
enough for us college students to
forgive its minor flaws. PG-13
The Scent of Green Papaya
This beautifully filmed movie, nomi
nated for the Best Foreign Film
Oscar, chronicles 10 years in the life
of a peasant girl raised to be a ser
vant. Although the plot seems thin at
points, the lovely visuals more than
make up for the holes in the story.

First-time director Tran Anh Hung's
camera makes poetry from tedious
details of everyday life. UNRATED
Schindler's List
The dark, haunting images of
Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's
List" overcome the film's characters,
leaving moments more important
than people. The story of German
entrepreneur Oskar Schindler and
the more than 1,100 Jews he saves
leads to an examination of the many
faces of evil in the Nazi regime. With
indelible pictures of death and
degradation burned in black-and
white film, "Schindler's List" cap
tures the truth of the more than six
million murders carried out just a
half century ago. R
What's Eating Gilbert Grape?
"Gilbert Grape" isn't just another
trite, coming-of-age flick. It's a fresh
portrayal of how reclusive Gilbert
(Johnny Depp) emerges from the
burdens of family life to find love.
The performances are excellent.
Leonard DiCapricio, who plays
Gilbert's mentally retarded brother,
may receive an Oscar nomination
for his riveting work. Above all that,
there's a bunch of neat symbols and
metaphors! PG-13
