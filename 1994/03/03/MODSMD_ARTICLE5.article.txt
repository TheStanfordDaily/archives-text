University President Gerhard Casper ad
dressed such varied issues as budget cuts,
ethnic students and alumni fund raising at a
news conference with student journalists yes
terday.
Regarding the University's current effort
to cut its budget, Casper pointed out that
while Provost Condoleezza Rice is the chief
budget officer at Stanford, he and Rice are "in
continuous discussion" about the cuts and
"the final decisions about the budget, as we
are submitting it to the Board ofTrustees, are
made by me."
Addressing foreign-language education at
Stanford — the structure of which is now
being reviewed by Prof. John Etchemendy,
the senior associate dean for humanities in
the School of Humanities and Sciences —
Casper drew a distinction between foreign
languages and foreign literature.
The president predicted that Stanford
may split foreign languages and literature
into separate departments, although he said
he does not know what Etchemendy's com
mittee will propose.
Casper also spoke about what would be
done with the final report of the Commission

on Undergraduate Education, expected by
the end of the summer.
The president said the report will be pub
lic and that he hopes "a very widespread dis
cussion" of the report by students and facul
ty will follow — a discussion in which he him
self will be "a very active participant." Then,
he said, various areas of the University which
have jurisdiction over the suggestions will re
view the recommendations.
Ethnic students were another topic of dis
cussion. Casper reiterated that he had never
intended to "emasculate" the ethnic centers,
that the amount of funding for the centers "is
not a vast amount of money" and that he sym
pathizes with the complaints of some ethnic
center representatives that they cannot take
large funding cuts. Casper added that he be
lieves the centers play "a very important role"
both socially and academically on campus.
The president also slammed a request to
publish statistics on minority admissions,
saying that "the educational goals of Stan
ford are not captured by quantitative criteria
of any sort" and calling the publication of
such admissions statistics "one of the worst
ideas I've heard in a long time."
When published, such figures are often
