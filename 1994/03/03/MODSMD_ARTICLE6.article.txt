# Chances for a filled Lake Lag dwindling
## 
### Charles Katz Staff writer 
Unless it rains — and rains a
lot — the beautiful beaches of
Lake Lagunita will remain just
that: beaches, with no water. Uni
versity Water and Sewer Superin
tendent Larry Andrews will de
cide in the next week and a half
whether to fill Lake Lag.
"We're not going to fill it unless
we get more rain," Andrews said.
He explained that there is no
"magic" number of inches of rain
required because the decision de
pends on whether there is enough

run-off from the Trancos and San
Francisquito creeks to pump into
the lake.
The lake requires 800 million
gallons of water to fill and another
500 gallons each minute to main
tain.
"The odds are, [filling the lakel
is not going to happen, but it
hasn't been decided yet," Blake
Middleton, director of sailing and
windsurfing for the University.
"There has to be substantial rain
in the next 10 to 14 days for the
lake to be filled."
