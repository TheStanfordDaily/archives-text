# Chances for a filled Lake Lag dwindling
## 
### Charles Katz Staff writer 
Unless it rains — and rains a
lot — the beautiful beaches of
Lake Lagunita will remain just
that: beaches, with no water. Uni
versity Water and Sewer Superin
tendent Larry Andrews will de
cide in the next week and a half
whether to fill Lake Lag.
"We're not going to fill it unless
we get more rain," Andrews said.
He explained that there is no
"magic" number of inches of rain
required because the decision de
pends on whether there is enough

run-off from the Trancos and San
Francisquito creeks to pump into
the lake.
The lake requires 800 million
gallons of water to fill and another
500 gallons each minute to main
tain.
"The odds are, [filling the lakel
is not going to happen, but it
hasn't been decided yet," Blake
Middleton, director of sailing and
windsurfing for the University.
"There has to be substantial rain
in the next 10 to 14 days for the
lake to be filled."
Middleton's programs stand to
be hurt severely by a dry lakebed.
Instead of using Lake Lag, sailing
and windsurfing classes will have
to use Salt Lake, a reservoir lake
that belongs to Stanford but is off
the main campus, and Redwood
City's waterway, which has an
outlet to the San Francisco Bay.
"We'll have two remote sites.

Classes won't fill up and we'll lose
a ton of money," Middleton said.
"We'll have to completely
reschedule classes and cancel
some of the windsurfing classes."
The tiger salamanders, the
endangered species which caused
the cancellation of the annual Big
Game bonfire, would not be sig
nificantly affected by the presence
or absence of water in the lake.
Andrews pointed out that the
salamanders survived last year
when the lake was filled and also
survived the three-year drought

in the years previous.
However, Jamie Reaser, a
graduate student in biology, said
salamanders need water to breed.
"No breeding will take place if the
lake is not filled," she said.
Last year, the lake was already
one-third filled by winter quarter
due to rain and run-off, according
to Middleton. Currently, the main
reservoir, Salt Lake, is down to 40
feet from the normal 60 feet, he
added.
Andrews said it would cost
$16,000 for the water to fill Lake

Lag. In addition, a lifeguard
would have to be on duty all the
time.
According to Middleton, the
lake would take about two weeks
to fill, so the last possible day to
decide is March 3 4 or 15. The lake
is usually drained after Com
mencement.
Although sailing would also be
hurt, Middleton said the Univer
sity as a whole will suffer if the
lake is not filled. "Lake Lagunita
has been a fixture at this Univer
sity for years," he said.
