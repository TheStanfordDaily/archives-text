### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Out on bail and apparently on
his way to Switzerland, the man
accused of posing as a student to
get free campus housing is now
also suspected of failing to pay a
$1,500 University phone bill.
Abdelghani Attou was arrested
on Friday in connection with two
charges of "defrauding the
innkeeper" — acts which he al
legedly committed at both Bran

ner Hall and Governor's Corner.
Attou also may owe the Univer
sity's Communication Services
over $1,500 in phone bills, accord
ing to Stanford Police Detective
Mark Swineford. The bills stem
from a four-month stay in the
University owned and operated
Welch Road Apartments.
Attou was evicted from the
apartment building in late Janu
ary for failure to pay rent, Swine-
ford said. The apartments are
normally used by visiting physi
cians and staff at the Stanford
Hospital, he added.
The building's resident man
ager, Ladona Hartman, declined
to comment on Attou's case.
A friend of Attou's, who would
not give her name, said Attou
told her that he was doing
research at Stanford. He also
said that he was a citizen of
Switzerland. The friend
described Attou, whom she knew
for almost six months, as a "lik
able, gentle person" who was
"very articulate."
"He's very convincing — you
would never suspect that he's not
who he says he is," she said. "I'm
still pretty shocked by the whole
thing."
Attou was able to pay his
$5,000 bail on Friday by asking
for a loan from a woman friend,
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said, adding that Attou
called the woman from jail crying

and asking for help.
The friend said Attou told her
he was a M.D. / Ph.D. student
studying artificial intelligence,
Niemeyer said.
Attou also told the woman
friend that his father was the
United Nations ambassador from
Switzerland. Police were unable
to find anyone who knew of
Attou's father at the United
Nations or in Washington, D.C.,
Niemeyer said.
The woman loaned Attou the
$5,000 as well as an additional
$535 deposit, Niemeyer said.
Attou later called the woman to
thank her, saying that he was on
his way to Switzerland and then
London, according to Niemeyer.
Attou told the woman not to
worry because "the check was in
the mail," Niemeyer said. Attou
also reportedly said he was in
contact with his father's attor
neys in Washington, and that he
might not have to return to the
United States to make his
March 15 court date, Niemeyer
said.
"We've been getting dozens
and dozens of calls about this
character," Niemeyer added.
