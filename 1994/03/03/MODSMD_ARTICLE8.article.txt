# A 						time to remember
## Students share reflections at AIDS vigil 
### Kyle Graham Staff writer 
Last night, 22 candles repre
senting "the beginning of light
and order in the dark night of
chaos" of the HIV/AIDS crises il
luminated White Plaza during a
candlelight ceremony, part of the
ongoing AIDS Awareness Week.
During the ceremony, orga
nized by senior Ken Dunn and ju
nior Nina Lin, participants lis
tened to a written message by Act
ing Dean of Memorial Church
Diana Akiyama, then discussed
friends and family afflicted with
HIV and AIDS.
"The main purpose of the can
dlelight vigil is twofold: of remem
brance of those who have died . ..
as well as looking forward, with
hope, to the future," Dunn said.
Akiyama's message, also read
at a similar ceremony last year,
mentioned the role of candles in
dispelling the darkness of AIDS,
calling the light a force of "order"
which continually battled the
"chaos" of AIDS.
Later in the ceremony, partici
pants unfurled a red streamer,
symbolizing both the red portion
of the gay rights movement's rain
bow flag as well as the red ribbons
used to commemorate victims of
AIDS.
After unrolling the streamer,
Dunn said, "I find it kind of ironic

that a color in the flag that repre
sents hope and freedom and new
life for a whole generation of peo
ple has also now been appropriat
ed by AIDS activists as a color for
the terrible epidemic that has
struck our nation today."
Dunn added, "Hopefully, we will
find a cure mid once again make the
world a better place to live in, and so
then the red in the flag will once
again mean life, hope and joy and
not carry the taint of death and of
AIDS that it now carries."
Other participants in the vigil
shared Dunn's hope that the
event would help others both fight
the disease and honor its victims.
"The [vigil] is for awareness, but
it's also a chance for people to
come together and remember to
gether," said junior Aly Feldman.
The event, which was original
ly billed as a march from various
campus locations to a central
point, was transformed into a vigil
due to schematic and administra
tive difficulties.
An additional purpose of the
candlelight vigil was to "bring [a
ceremony] into the heart of aim
pus and into the center of campus
life, be it the Inner Quad, as it was
last year, or White Plaza," and
thereby increase awareness of the
disease, said Dunn.
