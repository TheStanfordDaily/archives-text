Fellow Joseph McNamara will
serve as a security consultant in
the United Nations' oversight of
South Africa's first integrated
elections next month.
McNamara, a former San Jose
police chief, departs for U.N.
headquarters in New York next
week for a briefing on the mission
and will then travel to Europe and
South Africa.
"It is a great honor to be part of
this historic process in some small
way, helping to end apartheid and
aid the transition to a new gov
ernment through a peaceful elec
tion," he said.
He said he was originally con
tacted by an official at a founda
tion that "does work" in election
supervision. McNamara will be
one of three security specialists in
the delegation.
Although the election signals
the end of minority rule in South
Africa, factions of rightist whites
and the Zulu-based Inkatha Free
dom Party have combined to form
the Freedom Alliance and have
announced boycotts of the elec
tions. The African National Con
gress, led by Nelson Mandela, is
expected to win the election
which will be held Apr. 26-28.
McNamara said he has not
been given full details of the trip
yet, but said the U.N. delegation
will act as "consultants and
advisers to guarantee the
integrity of the elections, avoid
violence and intimidation and
convince all people" of the fair

ness of the vote.
He downplayed threats of
unrest such as those by the right
wing Freedom Alliance, which
has threatened civil war if its
demands for regional autonomy
are not met.
"Obviously there is concern,"
he said. "Yet at the same time,
there is a kind of cautious opti
mism, that things are moving for
ward, and that some of the resis
tance to the elections is dissipat
ing."
Though he has never visited

or studied South Africa, McNa
mara said his experience in
guarding elections as a member
of the police force in New York
City will aid him in his duties
next month.
McNamara will return to
Hoover after the targeted May 4
conclusion of the mission. He said
the length of the trip is "longer
than I expected," but well worth
it.
"This is such a momentous
occasion in history," he said. "It's
something I couldn't say no to."
