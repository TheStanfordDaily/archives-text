# Clinton enacts tough trade law
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Unable to
achieve a breakthrough in his battle to
open Japanese markets, President
Clinton brought back to life the most
feared weapon in America's trade
arsenal yesterday.
By executive order, the president
revived an expired provision of U.S.
law known as Super 301. The presi
dent said he would put forward by
Sept. 30 a target list of countries
deemed to have erected the most
harmful barriers to American goods
and services.
If negotiations fail to remove those
barriers, the administration would
have the power to impose punitive tar
iffs of up to 100 percent against
exports from those nations. The
amount targeted would equal the sales
being lost by American producers.
"This administration is committed

to opening markets for high-quality
goods and services produced by com
petitive American workers," the presi
dent said as he announced his deci
sion. "This action will help us reach
our objective — open markets that
will create better jobs and increase
wages at home and abroad."
Administration officials denied that
they were trying to start a trade war
with Japan, but they said the United
States would not relent in its efforts to
open Japan's markets as a way of nar
rowing a record $59.3 billion trade
imbalance between the two nations.
The administration already has the
power to initiate market-opening
investigations and impose tariffs if the
talks fail to produce results under the
regular Section 301 of the 1974 trade
act.
What Super 301 provides is a strict

timetable for results. The clock will
begin running March 31 with publica
tion of an annual "National Trade
Estimate Report" that provides a sur
vey of unfair trade practices that are
harming U.S. exporters around the
world.
From that list, the administration
will by Sept. 30 designate "priority
foreign country practices" that are
blocking the largest amount of U.S.
exports.
Scheduled negotiations could then
delay the imposition of sanctions until
March 1996, although administration
officials said if the talks were going
nowhere, sanctions could come much
sooner.
Japanese officials have warned
about counter-retaliation if the Unit
ed States slaps punitive tariffs on
Japanese products.
