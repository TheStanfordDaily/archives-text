HOW MANY times has the
Stanford community heard
the University sing its own
praises: "Stanford is a world-class
university"?
Without a doubt this statement
is true. But the key word in that
claim is "world" — Stanford is
judged on an international level.
And it values the diversity of the
international realm of its commu
nity members.
Aside from having a foreign
born president, Stanford also
offers numerous overseas studies
opportunities and prides itself on
its appreciation of multicultural
ism. If Stanford hopes to remain
competitive in the future and live
up to its promises, it must encour
age and foster the study of foreign
languages and cultures.
The University must be sure
that its foreign language depart
ments are able to further this goal.
As Assoc. Italian Prof. Robert Har
rison said, "The real basis of multi
culturalism, whether we like it or
not, is learning a foreign language."
John Etchemendy, a senior asso
ciate dean of the School of Human
ities and Sciences, has convened a
task force to discuss how the for
eign language departments can
best accommodate their programs
in the likely >
Etchemendy should bfe com
mended for forming this task force
to get input from members of the
various departments.
However, it must be remem
bered that foreign languages —
other than being foreign — do not
have much in common.
One option the task force is look
ing at — consolidating all or some
of Stanford's foreign language
departments — must be
approached with caution.
Any reform must preserve each

departments' autonomy to the
extent that they can continue to
instruct effectively and offer a
breadth of courses.
Supporters of the consolidation
initiative argue that larger depart
ments have vastly more resources
and leverage, both in and out of the
University. If all the foreign lan
guage departments were merged
into one large department with a
single chair, the department might
carry more influence.
But while French and Japanese
are both foreign languages, their
similarities end there. The struc
tures of the languages are very dif
ferent arid therefore, so are the
methods of teaching them.
Language depaitments obvious
ly need more support than their
small sizes give them — but they
must possess the freedom to pur
sue the most productive education
al path possible.
Another possibility under con
sideration is to combine languages
with related disciplines. For exam
ple, the Spanish and Portuguese
Department would be combined
with Latin American studies. This
option is more attractive than one
large conglomeration of languages,
since the methodology of the lan
guage instruction would be pre
served and the overall "foreign"
atmosphere of these departments
could be kept intact.
The language departments that
are currently housed in the Wilbur
modules will be moved back to their
permanent home in the language
corner of the Quad in about 22
months*, aocondingrto Etchemendy.* u
After the departments are reunited
in this centrally located area, they
will be better suited to accommo
date structural changes. >
However, if the University wish
es to live up to one of its hallmarks
— the valuable contributions of a
diverse community — then it must
allow foreign language depart
ments to do their essential part in
living up to this goal.
Otherwise, it can say au revior
to promises and bonjour to
hypocrisy.
