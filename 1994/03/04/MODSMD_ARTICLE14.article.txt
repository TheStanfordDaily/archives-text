## Joel Stein Rebel lemming: notes on the real world 
### 
YOU'RE NOT ready for the real
world. The real world is full of util
ity bills, tax forma and endless
hours spent choosing the right private
school for your kids. You need an agent, a
lawyer, an accountant and a therapist,
and you must refer to them often in con
versation. You must buy drinks for peo
ple you don't even like.
Sitting on a patch of grass discussing
whether Sterne really finished "Tristam
Shandy" isn't going to get you anything
but a wet ass. Drag queens don't care
where you went to school or how you
really grew from your experience as an
RA. And, for some reason, in the real
world, drag queens are cool.
Despite what you've been told, noth
ing you've done up until now will have
any effect on your iuktre. Think of the
last 17 years as a lpnfgj;, useless vacation.
Then get really drtgnkfin cheap beer and
forget all of it.
Because the real world, my friend —
the world in which "Ace Ventura, Pet
Detective" is the number one hit at the
box office and being an accessory to mur
der makes your misogynistic rap album
sell really well — the real world has no
rules.
When I left this isle paradiso this sum
mer, I was a veritable expert at how to be
a student — lea regies d icole, if you wilL
My 17-year career as a student taught me
to read books, write papers, and reword
other people's comments in section so
you look smarter than them. At the end

of the year, they gave you a promotion
and every four years or so your parents
would come sit in the sun, listen to some
one boring speak, and give you Cross
pens from relatives so obscure you could
legally marry them. It was an easy life.
But then it was over. I sent out 50
r6sum6s to large magazines, several con
centrating on women's feet, and drove
across the country high on ether with my
station wagon's tires way over-inflated.
And when I arrived in New York, I had an
interview with Martha Stewart Living.
For those of you who don't know who
Martha Stewart is, she is a cooking and
gardening maven. For those of you who
don't know what a "maven" is, circle it
and look it up later. I don't have that kind
of time any more.
After several grueling interviews con
sisting of questions like, "You know how
to use Lwas hired as the
sole writer for a nationdlry syndicated
cooking and gardening television show
even though I don't know anything about
cooking or gardening. That is how the
real world works.
Promotions don't come from hard
work, but because other people — people
who you hardly know — retire. Women
like you not for listening to them tedious
ly talk about how painful their relation
ship was, but because you own a decent
pair of wing tips.
If you've ever wondered how things
happen — how, for instance, Kevin
Neialon got on Saturday Night Live —

stop wondering. Stop trying to impose
schoolboy logic on a world far beyond
your understanding or imagination. A
world in which many, many people go to
work every day of their lives and never
actually make anything. It goes against
every lesson you were taught from
kindergarten on.
I return for this short visit to warn
you, like Zarathustra half-in-the-bag,
stumbling off the mountain to look for
cold pizza and confronting a band of lost
sheep, recently shorn and looking for a
bellwether. Yeah, like that.
Don't fear the world outside Stanford.
It cannot harm you. Not because it cares
about you, but because it is so poorly con
structed it wouldn't know how to harm
you.
Remember, everyone gets a job — even
the people you went to high wchool with.
Worrying about getting a job is like wor
rying about passing your driving'test.
Kevin Nealon passed his driving test.
Everyone gets married, even really
ugly people. And everyone has kids. And
everyone dies the same slow, horrible,
futile death. Even Kevin Nealon.
So stop worrying and start going to
more games at Sunken Diamond. Laugh
in the face of Goldman Sachs and they
will laugh back in yours. Don't think of
your time here as a chance to build a
r6sum6 — because your stint as live-in
counselor at the Bridge or ASSU Senator
