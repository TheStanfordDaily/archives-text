## Joe Bialowitz Muhammad's words hurt, but tolerating them kills 
### 
SOME BLACKS, including Daily
columnist N'Gai Croal, have recent
ly condemned the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai B'rith for singling out
the bigoted rhetoric of Khallid Abdul
Muhammad as worthy of repudiation by
black community leaders. To criticize
this effort to erase racism is to ignore the
painful lessons of a history fraught with
reminders of what silence in the face of
bigotry can and does lead to.
Must we wait for another Holocaust,
race riot or Hebron massacre to once
and for all remind us of the cost of fail
ing to combat hatred in all its forms?
Those who choose to wait are the ones
who lead humanity down a path of self
destruction. Those who have learned the
lesson but remain silent — be it for polit
ical reasons, considerations of practicali
ty, sheer selfishness, or even ignorance
— are perhaps even more culpable.
Amidst the horror, there is a lesson to
be learned from the scenario of the
shamed silence recently played out in the
country where one would have least
expected it — Israel. In a nation whose
creation was catalyzed by history's most
monstrous culmination of hatred's evil
consequences, a moment of national con
trition has tragically befallen the Israeli
people.
They are acutely aware of that the
massacre of at least 30 worshippers
could have been prevented had they and
their leaders taken more active mea
sures to curtail the activities of Kach, a
militant group of racists who followed
the teachings of the late Meir Kahane.
Labeled "racist" by the government,
Kach had indeed been barred from the
Israeli Parliament long before the mas
sacre. Despite this measure, not enough

was done on the part of the Israeli gov
ernment or its community leaders to
prevent Dr. Baruch Goldstein and others
like him from falling prey to Kahane's
Faustian message of Jewish empower
ment through bloodshed.
Thus when Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin stood before his country to con
demn Goldstein and his kind in the
harshest terms possible ("You are a
shame on Zionism and an embarrass
ment to Judaism"), there was in his
speech not only an explicit feeling of
humiliation "over the disgrace imposed
upon [them] by a degenerate murderer,"
but also a tangible feeling of guilt. Guilt
that, in a country that should have rec
ognized the signs of hatred and taken
action to nip it in the bud, hate was
rather allowed to fester and mutate from
mere thoughts and words of prejudice
into reprehensible acts of racism of the
sort usually perpetrated by pro-Pales
tinian terrorists.
Only now, ex post facto, is the possi
bility of outlawing the Kach movement
being considered. It is, no doubt, a case
of too little, too late. But do I therefore
propose that we outlaw Louis Far
rakhan's sect of the Nation of Islam?
After all, his and his former aide's anti-
Semitic, anti-gay, anti-white and anti-
Catholic remarks certainly contribute to
a climate in which acts of racism like the
murder of Yankel Rosenbaum during
the Crown Heights riots have been and
will continue to be committed. Despite
the appeal of such a strict measure, we
abstain from its implementation because
we all know it would sacrifice too many
of the constitutional principles we are
actually trying to protect.
Yet for blacks to countenance hatred

is to compromise the integrity of the civil
rights movement. Rep. Kweisi Mfume,
the chair of the Congressional Black
Caucus, realizes this, but only to a limit
ed extent. In disavowing the "covenant"
of cooperation between his caucus and
Farrakhan, he stated his group believes
"it cannot take the high ground on moral
issues of fairness and justice if it does not
stand up and express the fact that its
relationship, working and otherwise,
with the Nation of Islam is jeopardized
as long as some of our members continue
to feel... that there remains within the
Nation of Islam some degree of in sensi
tivity with respect to other people and
... other religions."
Mfume's ambiguous, politically mea
sured words point to black leadership's
reluctance to alienate Farrakhan from
the black dialogue. Yet I find it not only
surprising and disappointing but also
shocking that, in the wake of Hebron,
not every single black member of
Congress and leader of the black com
munity has answered the ADL's call to
repudiate the venomous remarks made
by Muhammad. To be sure, many such
leaders have publicly condemned the
Nation of Islam as "teachers of hate."
They are to be commended for their
courage and good sense. They realize
that, by virtue of their common experi
ence, it is much more necessary, effec
tive, and above all credible for them to
criticize the NOI than it is for the ADL
to do so.
Yet there remain others who refuse to
speak out against hatred. They usually
hide behind a quite hollow contention
that, as phrased by Croal, runs as fol
lows: "Why is it that all black people are
responsible for the words of a few — a

cross that other ethnic groups don't
have to bear?" To this the only answer is
that all ethnic groups — particularly
those who most bitterly experience and
steadfastly fight the effects of racism —
must treat the effort to expose bigoted
thought as no less than a good in itself.
And when the language of hate
emanates from one's own ethnic group,
then the will to check that hatred must
necessarily be stronger. Silence is not
just counterproductive, it is counter
intuitive.
Rabin was right on the mark when he
said: "A single, straight line connects the
lunatics and racists of the entire world."
A Koran-carrying Klansman is, nonethe
less, a Klansman. The idea is to recog
nize him as such, and moreover, expose
him as such.
Exposing bigotry is never bigoted. It
is never the disease for which it purports
to be the cure. On the contrary, it is
always a part of the cure. Of course, it is
not the onhr essential ingredient of the
fight to end racism. Efforts to alleviate
the symptoms and surface causes of
racism are only the beginning. We must
also address the root causes of racism.
This entails supporting the efforts of
anti-hate groups like the ADL as well as
those of groups who, by various means,
promote improvement in the socioeco
nomic positions of minorities without
conveniently scapegoating Jews and
other ethnic groups.
The ADL cannot be faulted for sug
gesting to black leaders ideas about what
would be beneficial to the civil rights
struggle. It is, after all, the eveyone'a
struggle too.

just counterproductive, it is counter
intuitive.

said: "A single, straight line connects the

Exposing bigotry is never bigoted. It
is never the disease for which it purports
to be the cure. On the contrary, it is
always a part of the cure. Of course, it is
not the onhr essential ingredient of the
fight to end racism. Efforts to alleviate
the symptoms and surface causes of
racism are only the beginning. We must
also address the root causes of racism.
This entails supporting the efforts of
anti-hate groups like the ADL as well as
those of groups who, by various means,
promote improvement in the socioeco

SOME BLACKS, including Daily
columnist N'Gai Croal, have recent
ly condemned the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai B'rith for singling out
the bigoted rhetoric of Khallid Abdul
Muhammad as worthy of repudiation by
black community leaders. To criticize
this effort to erase racism is to ignore the
painful lessons of a history fraught with
reminders of what silence in the face of
bigotry can and does lead to.
Must we wait for another Holocaust,
race riot or Hebron massacre to once
and for all remind us of the cost of fail
ing to combat hatred in all its forms?
Those who choose to wait are the ones
who lead humanity down a path of self
destruction. Those who have learned the
lesson but remain silent — be it for polit
ical reasons, considerations of practicali
ty, sheer selfishness, or even ignorance
— are perhaps even more culpable.
Amidst the horror, there is a lesson to
be learned from the scenario of the
shamed silence recently played out in the
country where one would have least
expected it — Israel. In a nation whose
creation was catalyzed by history's most
monstrous culmination of hatred's evil
consequences, a moment of national con
trition has tragically befallen the Israeli
people.
They are acutely aware of that the
massacre of at least 30 worshippers
could have been prevented had they and
their leaders taken more active mea
sures to curtail the activities of Kach, a
militant group of racists who followed
the teachings of the late Meir Kahane.
Labeled "racist" by the government,
Kach had indeed been barred from the
Israeli Parliament long before the mas
sacre. Despite this measure, not enough

was done on the part of the Israeli gov
ernment or its community leaders to
prevent Dr. Baruch Goldstein and others
like him from falling prey to Kahane's
Faustian message of Jewish empower
ment through bloodshed.
Thus when Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin stood before his country to con
demn Goldstein and his kind in the
harshest terms possible ("You are a
shame on Zionism and an embarrass
ment to Judaism"), there was in his
speech not only an explicit feeling of
humiliation "over the disgrace imposed
upon [them] by a degenerate murderer,"
but also a tangible feeling of guilt. Guilt
that, in a country that should have rec
ognized the signs of hatred and taken
action to nip it in the bud, hate was
rather allowed to fester and mutate from
mere thoughts and words of prejudice
into reprehensible acts of racism of the
sort usually perpetrated by pro-Pales
tinian terrorists.
Only now, ex post facto, is the possi
bility of outlawing the Kach movement
being considered. It is, no doubt, a case
of too little, too late. But do I therefore
propose that we outlaw Louis Far
rakhan's sect of the Nation of Islam?
After all, his and his former aide's anti-
Semitic, anti-gay, anti-white and anti-
Catholic remarks certainly contribute to
a climate in which acts of racism like the
murder of Yankel Rosenbaum during
the Crown Heights riots have been and
will continue to be committed. Despite
the appeal of such a strict measure, we
abstain from its implementation because
we all know it would sacrifice too many
of the constitutional principles we are
actually trying to protect.
Yet for blacks to countenance hatred

is to compromise the integrity of the civil
rights movement. Rep. Kweisi Mfume,
the chair of the Congressional Black
Caucus, realizes this, but only to a limit
ed extent. In disavowing the "covenant"
of cooperation between his caucus and
Farrakhan, he stated his group believes
"it cannot take the high ground on moral
issues of fairness and justice if it does not
stand up and express the fact that its
relationship, working and otherwise,
with the Nation of Islam is jeopardized
as long as some of our members continue
to feel... that there remains within the
Nation of Islam some degree of in sensi
tivity with respect to other people and
... other religions."
Mfume's ambiguous, politically mea
sured words point to black leadership's
reluctance to alienate Farrakhan from
the black dialogue. Yet I find it not only
surprising and disappointing but also
shocking that, in the wake of Hebron,
not every single black member of
Congress and leader of the black com
munity has answered the ADL's call to
repudiate the venomous remarks made
by Muhammad. To be sure, many such
leaders have publicly condemned the
Nation of Islam as "teachers of hate."
They are to be commended for their
courage and good sense. They realize
that, by virtue of their common experi
ence, it is much more necessary, effec
tive, and above all credible for them to
criticize the NOI than it is for the ADL
to do so.
Yet there remain others who refuse to
speak out against hatred. They usually
hide behind a quite hollow contention
that, as phrased by Croal, runs as fol
lows: "Why is it that all black people are
responsible for the words of a few — a

cross that other ethnic groups don't
have to bear?" To this the only answer is
that all ethnic groups — particularly
those who most bitterly experience and
steadfastly fight the effects of racism —
must treat the effort to expose bigoted
thought as no less than a good in itself.
And when the language of hate
emanates from one's own ethnic group,
then the will to check that hatred must
necessarily be stronger. Silence is not
just counterproductive, it is counter
intuitive.

said: "A single, straight line connects the
