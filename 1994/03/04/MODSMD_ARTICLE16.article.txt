## Crashing a bachelor party: the sad singles scene 
### 
TAKE ME NOW, GOD. Take me
before I have to grow up and face
the life of gold lam£ and faux
leather dresses I have just witnessed.
Before I have to go out into the tasteless,
tacky world with all its clearance-rack
social functions. Before I am reduced to
dancing pot belly to pot belly with other
pseudo-professionals to a bumping back
beat that only aggravates my growing
lack of bladder control.
Two nights ago I saw the future. I saw
what is to become of me once Delt parties
and full frontal broomball are long gone. I
saw what I will spend the next five years
of my life slaving away at a 90-hour-a
-weck job to avoid. I saw the dark under
belly of a Stanford Bachelors club party.
Beware the faint of heart.
Admission for students was free, so a
fearless companion and I went to shop for
a Sugar Daddy to buy us off-road vehicles
and support our Diet Coke habits. Admis
sion for women was $15, so every San Jose
State grad in the Bay Area asked her ex
husband for extra child support to foot the
bill Admission for men was $20, so every

Silicon Valley lackey in a 30-mile radius
asked Mom for money, unpacked his brain
from its jar and prepared to get lucky.
All guests on the Fiesta Deck were
required to be no younger than 21 years
old, and no older than 45. No statutory
rape-risks or Social Security skimmers
allowed. The locale was The Palace in
Sunnyvale, dressy club attire requested.
No-host bar, the yuppie equivalent of
Bring Your Own Bcier, ruled the land.
Disco sirens. Top-40 music. Wall to wall
olive-drab suits and dark ties, dotted by
fire-engine-red tube dresses hugging the
curves of bodies that would more appro
priately be given a nice, stoic handshake.
Know your limitations.
My spritely friend and I entered the
throng — part male-pattern baldness fest,
part post-divorce if-I-have-to-spend-anoth
er-night-surfing-the-net-ril-die despera
tion. Lots of men in somewhat expensive
business suits. Lots of men with some
what amusing ice-breaker lines.
We paused. We shuffled our way
through the crowd. We paused. We smiled
our seductive smiles. We walked halfway

up the stairs to the tortilla-chip bar and
gave our hair that model swish. We
paused. We looked around and noticed the
interested looks from uninteresting, yet
financially solid men. We paused
Come up and see us sometime.
Nothing. Zero. Not even a squirt of
Binaca in our direction. So my mis
chievous friend decided to grab the bull
by the horns and ask someone how to get
the balls to fall our way to win millions in
the love lottery. Of course, I thought,
she'll choose an upstanding voung com
puter programmer ripe for the picking.
Never underestimate the wiliness of a
woman.
She waltzed right up to stand nose to
nosehairs with the Homer Simpson of
financiers. A fine specimen of mid-life cri
sisdom. A beer gut with gusto. A body
stench with verve. A few strands of hair
tastefully cutting the glare on his glossy
head. A man among men.
With a bat of her eyelashes, she
inquired as to the etiquette of the hunt
With a quick dean and jerk he hooked us
both around the waists and pulled us far

too near to the sweat circles of his ray
oned armpits. "You ladies just gotta come
in and ask any guy to dance," he slurred.
"Do you wanna dance?" He gazed loving
ly into the eyes of my companion.
Death before dishonor.
"Tish, you go ahead. I'll watch," she
beamed, her pitchfork drawing blood from
my leg, creating a run in my pantyhose.
She slipped into the crowd to mingle with
the line up of bachelors, all standing pow
ersuit to powersuit just as they had on
deck at the CPPC years before.
Looking radiant in the suit-jacket and
skirt she worried would make her look
too much like she had just left a glass
ceiling job to come to the party. Looking
straight across the way at all the 30-
something women whose fashions,
shoplifted from the juniors' section at
Emporium, made them look too much
like they had just left their five-to-nine
jobs out on the corner of El Camino and
Harlot Ave. to come to the soiree.
Time to knock over the ATM.
"You look like you're under 30, would
you like to dance?" a Cal grad smoooooth

ly asked my laughing-too-soon friend.
Trapped, she was soon tripping the light
fantastic along with me and my geriatric
Casanova. I grinned a fiendish grin.
Are you a good bitch, or a bad bitch?
We left the floor to wrap up the night
chit-chatting with dozens of men, none of
whom had attended Stanford. Men who
were, perhaps, only lying to crawl out from
under the Stanford stigma. Men who
claimed to be "been-there, done-that kinda
guys," looking for "willing to go there, will
ing to do that" kinda women. Men betting
their Gold Cards on the sorrowful roulette
wheel that is the Singles scene.
"When does this party end?" I asked
one man as the night dragged on. "It
never ends," he shrugged, dejectedly
scanning the crowd.
You can check out any time you like,
but you can never leave.

Ttih hopes Steve from SLAC had a
much better time than she.

ersuit to powersuit just as they had on
deck at the CPPC years before.
Looking radiant in the suit-jacket and
skirt she worried would make her look
too much like she had just left a glass
ceiling job to come to the party. Looking
straight across the way at all the 30-
something women whose fashions,
shoplifted from the juniors' section at
Emporium, made them look too much
like they had just left their five-to-nine
jobs out on the corner of El Camino and
Harlot Ave. to come to the soiree.
Time to knock over the ATM.
"You look like you're under 30, would
you like to dance?" a Cal grad smoooooth

ly asked my laughing-too-soon friend.
Trapped, she was soon tripping the light
fantastic along with me and my geriatric
Casanova. I grinned a fiendish grin.
Are you a good bitch, or a bad bitch?
We left the floor to wrap up the night
chit-chatting with dozens of men, none of
whom had attended Stanford. Men who
were, perhaps, only lying to crawl out from
under the Stanford stigma. Men who
claimed to be "been-there, done-that kinda
guys," looking for "willing to go there, will
ing to do that" kinda women. Men betting
their Gold Cards on the sorrowful roulette
wheel that is the Singles scene.
"When does this party end?" I asked
one man as the night dragged on. "It
never ends," he shrugged, dejectedly
scanning the crowd.
You can check out any time you like,
but you can never leave.

Ttih hopes Steve from SLAC had a
much better time than she.

TAKE ME NOW, GOD. Take me
before I have to grow up and face
the life of gold lam£ and faux
leather dresses I have just witnessed.
Before I have to go out into the tasteless,
tacky world with all its clearance-rack
social functions. Before I am reduced to
dancing pot belly to pot belly with other
pseudo-professionals to a bumping back
beat that only aggravates my growing
lack of bladder control.
Two nights ago I saw the future. I saw
what is to become of me once Delt parties
and full frontal broomball are long gone. I
saw what I will spend the next five years
of my life slaving away at a 90-hour-a
-weck job to avoid. I saw the dark under
belly of a Stanford Bachelors club party.
Beware the faint of heart.
Admission for students was free, so a
fearless companion and I went to shop for
a Sugar Daddy to buy us off-road vehicles
and support our Diet Coke habits. Admis
sion for women was $15, so every San Jose
State grad in the Bay Area asked her ex
husband for extra child support to foot the
bill Admission for men was $20, so every

Silicon Valley lackey in a 30-mile radius
asked Mom for money, unpacked his brain
from its jar and prepared to get lucky.
All guests on the Fiesta Deck were
required to be no younger than 21 years
old, and no older than 45. No statutory
rape-risks or Social Security skimmers
allowed. The locale was The Palace in
Sunnyvale, dressy club attire requested.
No-host bar, the yuppie equivalent of
Bring Your Own Bcier, ruled the land.
Disco sirens. Top-40 music. Wall to wall
olive-drab suits and dark ties, dotted by
fire-engine-red tube dresses hugging the
curves of bodies that would more appro
priately be given a nice, stoic handshake.
Know your limitations.
My spritely friend and I entered the
throng — part male-pattern baldness fest,
part post-divorce if-I-have-to-spend-anoth
er-night-surfing-the-net-ril-die despera
tion. Lots of men in somewhat expensive
business suits. Lots of men with some
what amusing ice-breaker lines.
We paused. We shuffled our way
through the crowd. We paused. We smiled
our seductive smiles. We walked halfway

up the stairs to the tortilla-chip bar and
gave our hair that model swish. We
paused. We looked around and noticed the
interested looks from uninteresting, yet
financially solid men. We paused
Come up and see us sometime.
Nothing. Zero. Not even a squirt of
Binaca in our direction. So my mis
chievous friend decided to grab the bull
by the horns and ask someone how to get
the balls to fall our way to win millions in
the love lottery. Of course, I thought,
she'll choose an upstanding voung com
puter programmer ripe for the picking.
Never underestimate the wiliness of a
woman.
She waltzed right up to stand nose to
nosehairs with the Homer Simpson of
financiers. A fine specimen of mid-life cri
sisdom. A beer gut with gusto. A body
stench with verve. A few strands of hair
tastefully cutting the glare on his glossy
head. A man among men.
With a bat of her eyelashes, she
inquired as to the etiquette of the hunt
With a quick dean and jerk he hooked us
both around the waists and pulled us far

too near to the sweat circles of his ray
oned armpits. "You ladies just gotta come
in and ask any guy to dance," he slurred.
"Do you wanna dance?" He gazed loving
ly into the eyes of my companion.
Death before dishonor.
"Tish, you go ahead. I'll watch," she
beamed, her pitchfork drawing blood from
my leg, creating a run in my pantyhose.
She slipped into the crowd to mingle with
the line up of bachelors, all standing pow
ersuit to powersuit just as they had on
deck at the CPPC years before.
