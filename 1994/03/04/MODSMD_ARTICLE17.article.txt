## Women win Hedgpeth leads hoopsters against the Beavers 81-60 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
Nothing spectacular, just another "W."
While managing to extend its winning streak
to eight games last night with an 81-60 decision
over the Oregon State Beavers, the No. 11 Car
dinal women's basketball team did not exactly
blow the roof off Gill Coliseum before 2,853 in
Corvallis, Ore.
In a leapfrog-like contest in which the final
score marked the evening's widest margin,
Stanford (19-5, 12-3 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence) never trailed in the final 30 minutes but
allowed Oregon Siate (15-9, 7-8) to come close
on several occasions.
The Cardinal finally broke the game open
when a layup by junior forward Rachel Hemmer
with 5:10 remaining in the second half put the
score at 71-52, capping an eight-minute, 20-5
Stanford run.
While the Cardinal's fifth-consecutive win
over the Beavers lacked aesthetic quality, Stan
ford showed that it could survive without spec
tacular performances from either Hemmer (six
points, five rebounds) or junior center Anita
Kaplan (13 points, five rebounds).
In fact, the team's two scoring average lead
ers spent much of the game's latter stages play
ing tentatively after being whistled for their
fourth personal fouls within a 30-second span
midway through the second half.
Even before Hemmer and Kaplan faded to
virtual bystander status, however, the Cardinal
established a fast-break style reminiscent of
previous Stanford teams and offering a hopeful
sign of its versatility as the postseason
approaches.
Senior guard Christy Hedgpeth, who led all
scorers with 21 points, drilled the first of her
four three-pointers shortly after the opening tap
and followed with a layup that staked the Cardi
nal to a quick 5-0 lead.
The teams then traded bursts of momentum,
with Oregon State freshman center Kristina
Lelas netting six of her team-high 15 points to
give the Beavers their final lead, at 13-11, with
just under 10 minutes remaining in the first
period.
Stanford then accelerated to a 40-30 halftime
edge behind freshman forward Kate Starbird,
who came off the bench to score 13 of her 20
points on six-of-nine field goal shooting in the
seven minutes before intermission.
Oregon State hit the ground running after
the break, however, reeling off the first six
points of the second half and closing to within
one, at 43-42, when Lelas sank a five-foot hook
shot with 16 minutes remaining. Yet the Cardi
nal reeled off the next eight points and gave up
the next five before embarking on a backbreak
ing 12-2 run that saw Hedgpeth surpass Julie
Zeilstra as the lOth-leading scorer in Stanford
history.
In putting the Beavers away late, Stanford
benefited not only from Oregon State's 19 sec
ond-half turnovers but also from a splendid
playmaking performance by junior guard Kate
Paye.
While contributing a quiet seven points in 38
minutes of play, Paye set new career highs with
eight rebounds and nine assists. She also held
sophomore forward Tanja Kostic, the Beavers'
top scoring threat, to an ineffectual seven points
and five rebounds on the night.
While the Cardinal got away with a slight
change in style la~t night, it will most likely
need to return to its dominating half-court
offensive style tomorrow, when it faces the Ore
gon Ducks in Eugene, Ore. Led by senior for
wards Debbie Sporcich and Sara Wilson, the
Ducks stand tied with the Cardinal at second
place in the Pac-10 with three games remaining
for both teams.
The contest may be heard live on KZSU (90.1
FM) at 7 p.m., with Marc Oppenheimer and
Scott Walker gracing the airwaves.
