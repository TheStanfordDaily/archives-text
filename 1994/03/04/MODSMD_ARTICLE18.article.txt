They finally got an easy one.
A Cardinal men's basketball
team that had not previously won a
Pacific 10 Conference game by
more than 11 points demolished
Oregon State 90-66 last night in
Maples Pavilion.
"We needed that," Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery said. "It
was pretty much mission accom
plished out there."
It was very much mission
accomplished out there, as the Car
dinal (15-9 overall, 8-7 in the Pac
-10) dominated both sides of the
ball in recording its most lopsided
conference victory in over two
years.
"We thought we came into the
game with a good game plan," a
bewildered Beavers forward Brent
Barry said after the game. "They
hadn't been shooting the ball all
that well lately, so we were looking
to force them to shoot."
And shoot the Cardinal did —
Stanford guards Dion Cross and
Brevin Knight set the tone for the
game by opening with a pair of
three-pointers, as the Cardinal hit
seven of its first ten shots. On the
night, Stanford shot 56 percent
from the field, its highest mark
since the first game of the season.
"We came out shooting the ball
well, and we were ready to play,"
Cross said. "Once things got
rolling, everyone was touching the

ball and getting into the game."
With Oregon State (6-18, 2-13)
shooting frigidly from the field, the
Cardinal built a 12-2 lead in the
game's first four minutes. Stan
ford expanded that margin to 25-8

Sophomore forward Darren Allaway plots his next move in Stanford's 90-66 victory
over Oregon State last night in Maples.
after Darren Allaway hit a pair
of layups and a free throw.
Allaway played 27 minutes,
reaching season highs with 14
points and 12 rebounds in his
most impressive performance of
the season.
"When you build up some
confidence, your teammates
look to get you the ball more,"
Allaway said.
"He's playing like he played
last year," Cross said of Allaway,
who started 14 games for Stan
ford in 1992-93. "If Darren
scores that many for us, we're
going to win."
After building an imposing

42-17 halftime advantage, the
Cardinal cruised in the second
half, expanding the margin to
58-24 at the 13:47 mark.
"I didn't want to come out in
the second half, and have them
trim down the lead," Mont
gomery said. "I felt we did a
good job in that regard."
The Stanford bench saw
action late in the game. Guard
Rich Jackson hit a career-high
eight points, and walk-on David
Shaw saw his first playing time
of the season.
Shaw, a wide receiver on the
Cardinal football team who also
runs sprints on the track squad,
became one of the only Stanford
athletes in modern history to
play three varsity sports.
The Cardinal victory, coupled
with Arizona State's loss to

Washington State last night,
moves Stanford into a fourth
place tie with the Cougars in the
Pac-10. The Cardinal faces Ore
gon tomorrow at 7:30 p.m in its
final regular season home game
of the year. With three games
remaining on its schedule, the
Cardinal must remain in fourth
place to merit NCAA Tourna
ment consideration.
"We know we have to win our
last three games," Allaway said.
"We've got to go into them with
the attitude we played with
tonight."
