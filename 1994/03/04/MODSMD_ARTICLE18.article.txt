They finally got an easy one.
A Cardinal men's basketball
team that had not previously won a
Pacific 10 Conference game by
more than 11 points demolished
Oregon State 90-66 last night in
Maples Pavilion.
"We needed that," Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery said. "It
was pretty much mission accom
plished out there."
It was very much mission
accomplished out there, as the Car
dinal (15-9 overall, 8-7 in the Pac
-10) dominated both sides of the
ball in recording its most lopsided
conference victory in over two
years.
"We thought we came into the
game with a good game plan," a
bewildered Beavers forward Brent
Barry said after the game. "They
hadn't been shooting the ball all
that well lately, so we were looking
to force them to shoot."
And shoot the Cardinal did —
Stanford guards Dion Cross and
Brevin Knight set the tone for the
game by opening with a pair of
three-pointers, as the Cardinal hit
seven of its first ten shots. On the
night, Stanford shot 56 percent
from the field, its highest mark
since the first game of the season.
"We came out shooting the ball
well, and we were ready to play,"
Cross said. "Once things got
rolling, everyone was touching the

ball and getting into the game."
With Oregon State (6-18, 2-13)
shooting frigidly from the field, the
Cardinal built a 12-2 lead in the
game's first four minutes. Stan
ford expanded that margin to 25-8
