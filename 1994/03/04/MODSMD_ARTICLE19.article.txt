# Quick first half sparks Cardinal

Over by intermission â€” three
words the Stanford men's bas
ketball team has been unable to
apply to a win this year.
Until last night.
"Numberwise, it was proba
bly our best first half of the sea
son," Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery said, referring to
his team's 25-point halftime
advantage.
"Our start was unbelievably
bad," said Oregon State coach
Jim Anderson after his Beavers
shot 29.6 percent from the floor
in the first half.
From the tipoff the Cardinal
dominated. The Beavers opened
up in a zone, which Stanford
shooting guard Dion Cross
promptly busted by nailing a three
pointer. Center Jim Morgan added a
quick layup, which Oregon State
small forward Kareem Anderson
answered with a 10-foot jump shot.
Five-to-two was as close as the
Beavers would get, as Stanford went
on a seven-point scoring run, punc
tuated by a Brent Williams alley
oop. Two quick shots narrowed the

lead to 12-6, but then the Cardinal
went back to the races. Williams
scored eight straight points and
Darren Allaway added six as Stan
ford stretched the lead out to 18.
"It's like a roller coaster," Cross
said. "Once you get going, you can't
stop."
And the ride kept going through
out the first half. Anderson
switched his defense to man-to-man
to stop the onslaught, but the Cardi
nal adjusted, working the ball inside
to Allaway and Williams. Behind
this pair's combined 21 first-half

points, Stanford lead at one point by
28 and took a 42-17 advantage into
the locker room at halftime. This
woeful scoring mark by the Beavers
was the lowest point output the Car
dinal has allowed all year.
The domination was not just on
the scoreboard. Allaway's eight
first-half rebounds helped Stanford
to a 24-13 edge on the glass. The
Cardinal forced 11 turnovers while
giving up only seven itself.
Coach Montgomery pointed to
his team's ball movement as key to
the first-half advantage.

"I thought we made the extra
pass and found the extra guy," he
said. "The execution was there."
Much of the Cardinal's first-half
output was due to intense defensive
input. A pressuring man-to-man
defense kept the Beavers out of the
hoop and held Oregon State's top
two scorers, Anderson and Brent
Barry, to six combined points.
Combining this defensive pres
sure with boards domination and a
53 percent shooting mark, Stanford
built a Pacific 10 Conference win
that was truly finished by halftime.
