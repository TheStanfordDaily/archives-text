# No. 10 Hurlers travel south to challenge UCLA

The Stanford baseball team will put its one-game
lead in the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division on
the line today as it travels to Los Angeles to open a
three-game series against the UCLA Bruins. The first
game will begin at 7 p.m. at Jackie Robinson Stadium.
The No. 10 Cardinal enters the series with a 12-8
record, 2-1 in Six-Pac play after an impressive series
victory over Arizona State last weekend at Sunken Dia
mond. Stanford suffered a setback on Tuesday in losing
7-4 to undefeated Nevada-Reno and hopes to rebound
from that loss and charge ahead in the Six-Pac.
Stanford will start sophomore lefthander Dan Reed

(2-2) in tonight's game, which begins at 7 p.m. Fresh
man right-hander Jason Middlebrook (3-0) will start
Saturday and junior left-hander Mike Robbins (2-1) will
start Sunday.
Last weekend the same three Cardinal hurlers held
high-powered Arizona State to only seven runs in three
games. The trio has started a total of 13 games this sea
son and have a cumulative ERA of 2.70, while holding
their opposition to a batting average of only .239.
"I think that, especially with our young pitching
staff, that was quite an accomplishment in three games
to hold a strong Arizona State team to just seven runs,"
said Cardinal coach Mark Marquess. "I was quite
pleased when you consider the inexperience of our
young pitchers."

Despite the successes by the Cardinal pitching staff,
the key so far this season for Stanford has been offense.
When the Cardinal has scored five or more runs in a
game this season they are 11-1.
Stanford's offensive unit is led by senior designated
hitter Nate Olmstead, who is batting .381 with a team
leading 24 hits and eight doubles. First baseman Dusty
Allen leads the team with six multi-hit and five multi-
RBI games and is batting .319 on the season.
"We want to go down there and take three," Allen
said. "When we step on the field, our goal is to win.
Hopefully, we can take at least two out of three, but it
would be nice to get a sweep down there thus weekend."
