# Putting against the best
## Women linksters take to the green in Invite

There comes a time when good
enough isn't good enough anymore.
The Stanford women's golf team may
have reached this point when it heads
into the San Jose State/Jostens Invita
tional today, tomorrow and Sunday at
the Fort Ord Golf Course in Monterey,
Calif. There the No. 5-ranked Cardinal
will do battle with some of the top teams
in the nation, including No. 1 Arizona
State and No. 2 San Jose State.
Few question this Stanford squad's

talent or ability. Its performances against
other top teams have been nothing to
scoff at. However, its lack of a definitive
win over any of these teams continues to
haunt it. And a lackluster eighth-place
finish last week in Tucson leaves the Car
dinal questioning its own intensity.
"We weren't mentally or emotionally
ready to play in a tournament (last
week)," said freshman Andrea Baxter.
"We weren't excited. We just played and
didn't have a goal in mind."
Junior Jamille Jose agreed with this
assessment. "Everyone went in with
good games but we didn't put together

four good scores like we did last year,"
she said. "Mentally we all have to think of
winning, not just placing in the top five.
We have to want it badly enough."
This winning desire will likely be a
crucial factor this weekend if Stanford
wants to compete seriously in Monterey.
The women will face what head coach
Tim Baldwin called "the toughest course
we play all year." Tree-lined holes and
many dog-legs make it difficult to maneu
ver the ball. Winds will also be a factor, as
the course is adjacent to the ocean.
Not only will the squad have to deal
with natural obstacles, but also with

what Baldwin called "a field as strong as
we faced in Tucson, if not stronger."
Leading this field will be the Arizona
State Sun Devils, who, with one minor
exception in the fall, have not allowed any
team within striking distance yet this
season. The squad shows no signs of fal
tering during spring competition.
"ASU is going to stay that tough
throughout the year," Jose said.
Hope remains for the Stanford cause,
however. Despite her worries about the
Cardinal's tournament readiness, Baxter
