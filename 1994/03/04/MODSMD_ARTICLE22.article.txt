## Tennis heads to doubles tourney 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
After using a strong singles
lineup to take the National
Indoors title in Kentucky, the
top-ranked and well-traveled
Stanford men's tennis team will
now see how it stacks up in dou
bles in Southern California.
Held in La Jolla, the Pacific
Coast Doubles Tournament is
an open competition, featuring
top collegiate, professional and
formerly professional teams.
The single elimination tourna
ment runs Friday through Sun
day.
"This tournament will be an
excellent opportunity for us to
just concentrate on doubles,"
said head coach Dick Gould,
who added that doubles teams
from Pacific 10 Conference rival
USC will be in attendance.
"We've been concentrating on
doubles in practice this week,
and this will be a good chance to
see how we do."
At last weekend's Indoors in
Louisville, Stanford compiled
an impressive 16-8 singles
record in four matches over
four days.
However, against those oppo
nents, the Cardinal was only
able to muster a 6-6 record in

doubles.
Stanford's No. 1 doubles
team of senior All-Americans
Michael Flanagan and Chris
Cocotos, ranked No. 4 in the
nation, had a 2-2 record last
weekend.

This will be a good
way to encfup the
quarter.... And we'll
also be able to take a
good look at our dou
bles lineup. We're
looking forward to
the competition.'
— Dick Gould

The Cardinal's No. 2 team,
the nationally No. 7-ranked pair
of senior Ail-American Vimal
Patel and sophomore Jeff
Salzenstein, was only able to
chalk up a 1-3 record.
Surprisingly, Stanford's No.
3 team, senior Robert Devens
and freshman Grant Elliott,
compiled the team's best record
in doubles at 3-1. Though possi

bly lacking confidence and defi
nitely lacking experience, the
duo of Devens and Elliott played
strongly. When serving, the pair
lost only one game throughout
all Indoors.
While coaches Gould and
John Whitlinger have tried sev
eral combinations in the three
doubles positions, Flanagan-
Cocotos, Patel-Salzenstein and
Devens-Elliott seem to be pairs
of choice for this season's Car
dinal.
On the year, Flanagan-Coco
tos own an 11-5 record. Patel-
Salzenstein have racked up a
14-4 record (13-1 before
Indoors).
And while Devens-Elliott's
record stands at 4-2, their per
formance last weekend may
have entrenched the duo in the
doubles lineup.
All three pairs will travel
south to compete at Pacific
Coast Doubles, as will the tan
dem of sophomore Ricky Becker
and senior Billy Wright, which
has played twice in dual-match
play, winning both times.
"This will be a good way to
end up the quarter," Gould said.
"And we'll also be able to take a
good look at our doubles lineup.
We're looking forward to the
competition."
