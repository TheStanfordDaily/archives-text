# Men gymnasts take on rival
## Unbeaten Cardinal will host revenge-hungry Nebraska 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
It is said that revenge is a powerful but
dangerous tactic.
The No. 6 Nebraska men's gymnastics
team can certainly choose to empower
itself with revenge on its mind when it
visits two-time defending national cham
pion Stanford along with No. 16 Califor
nia, Western Michigan and San Jose
State tomorrow. Indeed, for the past two
years in the final round of the NCAA
Championships, the Cornhuskers have
finished second to the currently No. 2-
ranked Cardinal.
On the other hand, Nebraska may
think twice about going full throttle this
weekend due to the injuries it has
accrued over the season.
Over the years, consistent execution of
less difficult, but fundamentally solid
routines has allowed the Huskers to vie
for the national crown. Stanford head
coach Sadao Hamada believes that such
tactics will certainly prove sufficient in
defeating the Golden Bears, Broncos and
the Spartans.
However, according to Hamada, in
light of the Nebraska's injury-riddled
lineups, the Huskers may have to accept
the dangers as well as the strength of
vengeance if its hopes to burst the
unbeaten Cardinal's bubble.
"They're psyched to beat us since
they've lost to us the last two years at
NCAAs," Hamada said.

"They may go for broke and do every
thing for the win. It's most likely,
though, that |the Huskers] will remain
conservative because of their injuries. If
that's the case, and each team performs
to the best of its capabilities, then there
will be no contest."

1 know Nebraska's trend,
its coaching staff and its
philosophies I know
what Nebraska will do, but
Nebraska doesn't know
what I'm going to do. They
can't make plans, but we
can. I have my own trend —
I am unpredictable.'
— Sadao Hamada

Whatever the Huskers decide to do,
they will do it with U.S. National Team
member Dennis Harrison and Richard
Grace, both outstanding all-around per
formers. Nebraska also has a solid cast of
gymnasts to support its stars.
However, Harrison, Grace and compa
ny will confront a Stanford team that

posted a score of 283.70 out of 300 in its
victory over No. 7 Michigan and 9
UCLA at home last weekend. The Cara'i,
nal accomplished the feat even without\
the services of freshman floor and vault
specialist lan Bachrach, who suffered a
bruised heel during last weekend's com
petition.
"My prediction of 285 for last weekend
was pretty good except for lan," Hamada
said. "My goal for Saturday is 285-286. We
should be able to get that."
Bachrach will return to action in tomor
row's meet, however.
"My Achilles' still hurts a little,"
Bachrach said, "but I really want to com
pete this weekend. I'll rest the week after
this."
In any event — with or without a 100
percent Bachrach, and against either a
healthy or unhealthy Nebraska squad —
Hamada anticipates victory this weekend.
The meet will begin at 3 p.m. in Burnham
Pavilion.
"I know Nebraska's trend, its coach
ing staff and its philosophies," Hamada
said. "I know what Nebraska will do, but
Nebraska doesn't know what I'm going
to do. They can't make plans, but we can.
I have my own trend — I am unpre
dictable."
"Since September, I planned out how to
lead this team to another championship,
making our strategy based on other teams'
strategies. Other teams know where we're
going, but they don't know how we're get
ting there."
