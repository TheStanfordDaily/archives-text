# Track ready to run in Cal meet
## Team will compete for last time before NCAA Indoors 
### Jorge Chen 
The Stanford track team is
set to do battle in rival territory
tomorrow when it competes in
an all-comers meet at Califor
nia starting at 10:30 a.m. at
California Memorial Stadium.
This meet will be the last
opportunity for qualifiers to
add the finishing touches to
their performances before
heading to the NCAA Indoor
Track and Field Championships
March 11-12 in Indianapolis.
This weekend's contest will also
provide a good preview of the

rival team before the annual
Big Meet held on May 7 at
Berkeley.
Tomorrow's field will be
composed of athletes from Cal,
Sacramento State and many
other representatives from
local colleges.
The Stanford athletes com
peting in this meet will mainly
be coming from the sprints,
weights, field, and middle dis
tance squads. Stanford Head
Coach Vin Lananna is taking
the long distance team out of
this competition in order to give
the team plenty of rest before

the championships.
"Even though we are sending
a medium-sized group to this
meet, it will be a challenge to
the athletes' competition
tomorrow," said junior hurdler
and team co-captain Tovi Abel
lo.
Abello and his teammates are
optimistic about the Cardinal's
chances at topping its cross-bay
challengers.
"We hadn't beaten Cal in a
dual meet for a long time
because they always put togeth
er an extremely strong track
program," Abello said.
