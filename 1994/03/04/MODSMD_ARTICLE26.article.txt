# Taking to the road
## Spikers face UCSB, Cal State 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Standing pat in the No. 5 spot nationally for
the second consecutive week, the Stanford volley
ball squad will try to improve upon that with two
road matches this weekend against No. 8 UC-
Santa Barbara and No. 11 Cal State-Northridge.
Playing against two very hot teams, Stanford
will have to duplicate its tremendous defensive
effort in last week's USC match in addition to
eliminating attacking errors on offense in order to
topple the Gauchos and the Matadors.
Welcoming the Cardinal into Robertson Gym
on Sunday will be a Santa Barbara team (7-6 over
all, 4-3 in the MPSF) which has caught fire as of
late. After a dismal 5-6 start, the Gauchos have
turned things around with recent upsets against
No. 6 Pepperdine and Northridge.
"Santa Barbara is starting to click right now,"
said head coach Ruben Nieves. "After they beat
Pepperdine, Pepperdine turned around and beat
No. 2 USC on Tuesday. That tells me something
about this Santa Barbara team."
The core of this improved Gaucho's squad
includes freshman opposite hitter Donny Harris.
At 6-foot-7, the tallest spiker on Santa Barbara's
side of the net, Harris has pounded in 123 kills for
a 5.86 kills per game average — eighth in the
MPSF and 10th nationally.
Although overall Santa Barbara ranks a lowly
seventh out of 10 MPSF teams in hitting percent
age, the Gauchos can also turn to its defense for
support. Sophomore middle blocker Carter Reese
has come into his own with 40 total blocks on the
season, good for eighth in the MPSF.
"Basically, it's going to be a match between two
teams that have played really well of late," Nieves
said. "We're coming off our best weekend in a
while, and they are on a streak — we really don't
know what to expect."
Nevertheless, the Cardinal are preparing for
what Nieves called the "usually Santa Barbara
characteristics."
"First, we have to block effectively against
their hitters because they run a very sophisticat-

Ed offense," he said. "On they court there's a lot
of motion, crossing patterns and combination
plays."
In addition, the Gauchos have a penchant for
dropping in short serves, forcing opposing passers
to adjust on every serve.
Despite all this, Stanford has defeated Santa
Barbara once this season at the UCSB Tourna
ment. However, armed with a new lineup and an
impressive winning streak the Gauchos will not
fold as easily, as they did at the beginning of the
1994 campaign.
After the much anticipated Santa Barbara
matchup, the Cardinal will swing further down
south to take on the Matadors in Northridge.
Coming into the match at 7-4 overall and 3-2 in
the MPSF, Northridge is presently struggling
with problems of inexperience and youth that
plagued Stanford earlier this season.
After graduating four starters, including two
All-Americans, the Matadors have been trying to
reload, and are almost as inexperienced and
youthful as the Cardinal squad it will face on
Monday.
Nevertheless, their recruits are also among the
finest in the nation. Defecting from the German
National Team, middle blocker Oliver Heitmann
has paced Northridge on offense with 124 total
kills and a .427 hitting percentage, while fresh
man Jason Hughes has also been making waves
from his outside hitting position.
"Heitmann has a lot of international volleyball
experience and overall maturity to add to that
team," Nieves said. "And Hughes was one of the
top recruits in the nation last year. Beyond those
two, Northridge has a lot of unproven talent.
"All I know is that once that team gets going
though, it will be awfully tough to stop them.
That means we have to stay on top during the
match and not let them put any kind of scoring
streak together."
Northridge will be the final stop on the Cardi
nal's two-week road schedule. After the match
against the Matadors, Stanford will return home
to host No. 1 UCLA at Burnham Pavilion next
Saturday.
