### Romesh Ratnesar Editorial staff 
Exiled Haitian President Jean-
Bertrand Aristide will give a public lec
ture at Stanford April 18, the ASSU
Speakers' Bureau announced yesterday.
Aristide was ousted as president in
September 1991 by a military coup led by
current Haitian leader Gen. Raoul Ce
dras. U.S. and international pressure
has since failed to restore Aristide to
power.
While at Stanford, Aristide will dis
cuss the current political and social situa
tion in Haiti, which is presently under
United Nations economic sanctions and
an arms and oil embargo, according to se

nior Melind John, director of the speak
ers' bureau.
"I think American policy — its lack of
a policy towards Haiti — is one of the
major foreign" policy issues facing the
[Clinton] administration, and a lot of it
has to do with Aristide himself," he said.
John also pointed to the ongoing de
bate concerning Haitian refugees who
have been denied entrance into the U.S.
as further evidence of the country's
geopolitical importance.
He said the bureau has sought Aris
tide's appearance for 15 months and re
doubled its efforts after Aristide canceled
a tentative agreement to speak last
spring. John warned that if "he's back in
power (this spring), he won't come."

The speech is co-sponsored by three
academic departments as well as two stu
dent organizations, Stanford-in-Govern
ment and the Caribbean Students Asso
ciation. John said tickets for the speech
will be available on a "first-come, first
serve" basis at the Tresidder Union tick
et office about a week before the event.
He added that Secret Service agents
likely will accompany the Haitian leader
during his visit.
Terry Anderson, the Associated Press
journalist who was held hostage in
Lebanon for the better part of a decade,
will also speak at Stanford the same
week of Aristide's appearance. John said
arrangements for other figures are
"somewhat tentative."
