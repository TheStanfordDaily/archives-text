# Students travel to earth summit
## 
### Jamie Taylor Staff writer 
Increasing environmental awareness on college
campuses and incorporating the environment into
the university curriculum were two of the many
issues discussed by students — including three
Stanford undergraduates — at a national campus
environmental conference two weeks ago.
Seniors Esther Conrad and Mike Brylawski and
sophomore Marjorie Lucks attended the Feb. 18-20
Campus Earth Summit at Yale University to gain
perspectives from around the nation on current
environmental problems.
The summit — the first of its kind — was orga
nized by the Yale Student Environment Coalition
into various lectures and discussion groups for the
420 participants. Speakers included Carol Browner,
head of the Environmental Protection Agency; Paul
Hawkins; the author of "Ecology in Commerce";
and William Reilly, former head of the EPA and a
visiting professor at Stanford this year. Vice-Presi
dent A 1 Gore also sent a taped address.
Conrad, a Students for Enviromental Action at
Stanford co-coordinator, agreed. "The conference
helped to bring many universities together to give
people a sense that they're not the only ones work
ing on environmental problems," she said. "It helps
create connections, which is important to Stanford
in that it helps generate ideas."
Lucks, the residence environmental representa
tive coordinator for SEAS, said she thinks the con
ference brought freshness to the environmental
movement at Stanford. "It brought up ideas SEAS
hadn't dealt with, like education and waste manage
ment," she said.
Ideas developed in the 15 discussion groups were
consolidated into a 19-page "Campus Blueprint,"
outlining general concerns and techniques for rais
ing environmental awareness. Lucks said SEAS will
be meeting next quarter to discuss the blueprint and
to tailor it to Stanford's needs and goals.
Susan Kulakowski, Stanford's Energy Manage
ment coordinator, also attended the conference. In
terms of environmental awareness and action, she

said, "Stanford is kind of ahead of the game com
pared with other universities."
Kulakowski cited the Earth Systems program as
a strong environmental force in Stanford's curricu
lum, as well as Stanford's long-established recycling
program.
Although Brylawski, one of the student co-coor
dinators of Students for Environmental Action at
Stanford, agreed Stanford's environmental curricu
lum is good, he added that students need to put what
they learn in the classroom into practice. "If you
take the number of students involved with environ
mental classes and majors, and compare it to the
number involved in environmental action on cam
pus, it's a little disappointing," he said.
Brylawski said he believes that Stanford must
further develop an Environmental Studies major
based in the humanities rather than in biological
and technical sciences. The history and anthropol
ogy of the environment are possible perspectives.
Kulakowski said that Stanford's administration
needs improvement regarding its environmental
practices as well. "Students are ahead of the staff in
progressive thinking in terms of the environment,"
she said.
She added that she believes that the "faculty
needs to take time and think about the impacts of
their research or use of facilities on the local and
global environment, and incorporate it into their
teaching and mentoring." She added that energy
conservation should be one of the administration's
most important environmental concerns.
In addition, "economic incentives are just as valid
in a university setting as in other settings,"
Kulakowski said. She suggested that individual
departments take responsibility for their own utility
costs in their specific buildings. In this way, she said,
faculty would have a tangible incentive to conserve
and manage their resources.
"Essentially, it means lifestyle change, to take out
not only your trash, but your recyclables, choosing
less packaging at the grocery store, etc.," Lucks said.
"The one little contribution really makes a difference,
because not only do you contribute to the environ
ment, but you teach other by your actions as well."
