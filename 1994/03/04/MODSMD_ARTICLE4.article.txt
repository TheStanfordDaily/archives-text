Kicking off the first night of a
three-day symposium co-spon
sored by Institute N.H.1., author
Harold Cruse discussed the effec
tiveness of black leadership and or
ganizations heading into the 21st
century last night in the School of
Education.
Cruse, an emeritus professor of
history and Afro-American Studies
at the University of Michigan, as
serted that current black organiza
tions such as the NAACP are inade
quate to deal with the growth of
racial tension in the Unit'*! Slates.
This tension, he stated in a sort of
"doomsday" prediction, may result
in the sort of ethnic conflict now tak
ing place in the former Yugoslavia.
Cruse's talk was the keynote ad
dress of a three-day symposium on
black thought and identity, orga
nized by the newly-formed insti
tute. N.H.I, stands for "No Hu
mans Involved," a term used by
public officials and the judicial sys
tem in IjOs Angeles to refer to any
case involving a breach of the rights
of young inner-city black males.
According to Cruse, the goals of
current black organizations were
established in the early 20th centu
ry, around 1909, and may no
longer be appropriate.
"If we believe that these organi
zations which were established in

the 20th century will be effective in
the 21st century, then we are dead
wrong," Cruse said. "These orga
nizations have played out their
usefulness."
Cruse also stressed that when
these organizations were founded,
they were dependent on the white
upper class for financial support.
As a result, they have never been
truly independent black social up
lift organizations, and history has
to be revised to point that out.
"What else are these organiza
tions going to achieve?" he asked,
joking that they will ignore larger
concerns while battling for rela
tively insignificant causes such as
the next civil rights post in the
White House.
"These leaders will not do any
thing that hasn't been done be
fore," he said.
In the face of what he believes to
be developing racial and ethnic ten
sion, Cruse said that if American
political forces do not know what to
do in 1994, then they will not know
what to do by the year 2000.
The current African-American
student generation is the only
group left with any potential to
change things, Cruse said. The
most difficult thing to get across to
them, however, is that this is no
longer the 1960s and the tactics
