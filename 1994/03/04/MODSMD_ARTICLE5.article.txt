The Medical Center's financial problems
will force the school to eliminate more than
100 faculty positions, School of Medicine
Dean David Korn told the Faculty Senate
yesterday.
The school is projected to have a deficit
of $55.5 million between fiscal years 1993
and 1998, according to figures Korn pre
sented.
That loss comes mainly from reductions
in 1991 in the University's indirect-cost in
come — the money Stanford gets from the
government to cover overhead costs of re
search — which precipitated "pretty much
a financial crisis," he said. And, Korn said,
the move in Northern California and na
tionwide toward "competitive managed
care" contracts for medical services threat
ens some income the Medical Center now
receives from clinical work.
In response to the financial problems,
the school is trying to economize its opera

faculty, dropping from a baseline figure of
399.5 positions to 295.
Most of the positions will be cut through
attrition, Korn said, and some jobs may be
transferred to other, non-tenure-line posi
tions. Trying to cut jobs "is not a pleasur
able task," Korn said, but is important.
While Stanford began re-examining how
it organizes its tenure-line medical faculty
earlier than other schools because of the in
direct-cost reduction, Korn said medical
schools across the United States are now
studying the same issue because of nation
al health-care changes.
"I think we're going to need to re-order
the faculty structure of the Medical School
a little more than we have already," Korn
said.
Korn said he will also work to standard
ize the way clinical faculty are paid. To do
so, he will freeze base pay for tenure-line
clinical faculty starting Sept. 1, until the
