# Med Center will lose 100 faculty positions
## Korn discusses cost-cutting moves with Fac Sen 
### Andy Dworkin Colleen Krueger Staff writers 
The Medical Center's financial problems
will force the school to eliminate more than
100 faculty positions, School of Medicine
Dean David Korn told the Faculty Senate
yesterday.
The school is projected to have a deficit
of $55.5 million between fiscal years 1993
and 1998, according to figures Korn pre
sented.
That loss comes mainly from reductions
in 1991 in the University's indirect-cost in
come — the money Stanford gets from the
government to cover overhead costs of re
search — which precipitated "pretty much
a financial crisis," he said. And, Korn said,
the move in Northern California and na
tionwide toward "competitive managed
care" contracts for medical services threat
ens some income the Medical Center now
receives from clinical work.
In response to the financial problems,
the school is trying to economize its opera

tions. Korn stressed that the school is cut
ting the number of tenure-line positions for
faculty, dropping from a baseline figure of
399.5 positions to 295.
Most of the positions will be cut through
attrition, Korn said, and some jobs may be
transferred to other, non-tenure-line posi
tions. Trying to cut jobs "is not a pleasur
able task," Korn said, but is important.
While Stanford began re-examining how
it organizes its tenure-line medical faculty
earlier than other schools because of the in
direct-cost reduction, Korn said medical
schools across the United States are now
studying the same issue because of nation
al health-care changes.
"I think we're going to need to re-order
the faculty structure of the Medical School
a little more than we have already," Korn
said.
Korn said he will also work to standard
ize the way clinical faculty are paid. To do
so, he will freeze base pay for tenure-line
clinical faculty starting Sept. 1, until the
base pay among doctors with sim
ilar experience is equal. The fac
ulty can still earn extra pay for
their clinical work.
The long-term goal of these
changes, Kora said, is to make
the number of tenure-line faculty
and their base salaries have a
"rational relationship" to the
hard money base in the School of
Medicine's budget. He said final
decisions have not yet been made
on whether the salary structure
for basic science faculty should
change as well.
The Medical Center has taken
other steps to improve its
finances, including planning to
restructure its operations to
attract more patients. The School

of Medicine plans to cover its
deficit with $20.3 million in
reserve funds and $35.2 in spend
ing reductions.
In other senate news, the
Planning and Policy Board deliv
ered its quarterly update. The
board, which was created more
than a year ago, was intended to
serve as both the "keeper of the
faculty's vision" and an advisory
panel for the president and
provost.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg,
who is chairing the committee
this quarter, reported that
although the "Planning and Poli
cy Board will continue thinking
about the role it's going to play
guiding the administration and
reporting to the senate," policy
decisions have been suspended
this quarter.
Biology Prof. Robert Simoni
charged that the board has

"developed into a body that nei
ther takes instruction from nor
reports to the senate."
While Simoni said he appreci
ates the board's function as a
sounding board for the adminis
tration, he stressed that it should
also see itself as an advocate for
faculty concerns.
But University President Ger
hard Casper called the board "a
miyor way for us to gather reac
tions from faculty members who
are well positioned to know what
affects their colleagues."
The provost updated the sen
ate on the status of the budget
cutting process, commenting that
her office had received "5- and 10-
percent scenarios for all of the
academic units" as well as assess
ments of the services each pro
vides.
Administratively, Rice report
ed that two "town hall" meetings

had been held to solicit communi
ty reaction to proposed budget
reductions in the Offices of Stu
dent Affairs and Faculty and
Staff Services.
Responding to students' con
cerns that "the meeting was not
as well-advertised as it could have
been," Rice said Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds
and the Council of Presidents will
be sponsoring a second forum
spring quarter. In addition, two
other town hall meetings will be
held next quarter.
The senate heard a memorial
resolution for Spanish and Por
tuguese Prof. Emeritus Juan
Bautista Real, who died Nov. 8,
1993.
After the meeting, the presi
dent and many senate members
attended an "informal meeting"
closed to the press in the Law
School.
