# Students complain about advising at CUE meeting
## 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
A group of students aired its complaints
on the current advising system at an open
meeting held by members of the Commis
sion on Undergraduate Education last
night in Kimball lounge.
About 15 students participated in the
discussion, which was run by the commis
sion's Subcommittee on Academic Envi
ronment. This subcommittee's mission is
to evaluate the academic side of residential
education, according to committee member
A 1 Camarillo, associate dean of humanities
and sciences.
On the whole, students gave a fairly neg
ative portrayal of their experiences with the
residential advising system.
Joe Mitchell, a freshman, said his advi
sor did not even know what a distribution
requirement was. His advisor, who is a re
searcher at the medical school, was able to
give him general ideas about his education
but had no real connection to undergradu
ate life at Stanford, Mitchell said.
Other students voiced concerns about
the intimidation that many students feel
when required to go to their advisors, stat
ing that advisors should take more initia
tive to contact students.
"The gap between students and profes

sors is already huge," freshman Shahriar
Heidary said. He added that advisors
should help to "break the barrier early on."
Some students addressed what they felt
was the erratic quality of advising. "It's not
uniform or consistent," said junior Eliza
beth Riles. "I know a lot of people who had
terrible experiences or really good ones."
Camarillo echoed many of the students'
opinions and said that there is a "enormous
disparity in the quality of advising."
Many students also felt that there was a
failure in the process of matching students
to advisors in their fields of interest. "It's
not a good match in many cases," Camaril
lo said. The current system asks students to
express their interest in one of four areas:
social sciences, humanities, pre-med, and
engineering.
There is also a significant drop in stu
dent contact with their advisor after fresh
man year, said commission member and
Kimball resident fellow John Rickford, a
professor of linguistics. Many sophomores
only call their advisor to obtain approval
codes to register for classes, he added.
A potential solution to the problem could
be the elimination of faculty advisors, ac
cording to Rickford. All general advising
would be handled by 35 to 40 professional
advisors whose only job would be
to assist students, he said.
In the current system, mem
bers of the faculty volunteer to
become advisors, Camarillo said.
He added that there are currently
no quotas as to how many advi
sors must come from each depart
ment. The advisors are trained at
a two-hour lecture that is option
al, according to Rickford.
Other plans to assist students
with academic decisions were also
discussed. Small tutorials taught

by faculty to introduce students
to their field might be one solu
tion, Camarillo said. These tuto
rials would help students in the
major selection process. Large
classes with a variety of lecturers
might also be offered.
Reception to the tutorial pro
posal was fairly lukewarm. Sever
al students expressed the opinion
that — due to CIV and freshman
English — many students would
not be able to fit the introductory
classes into their schedules.
A summer program, where
incoming sophomores would
return early to work with faculty
in fields of their interest, was also
discussed.
