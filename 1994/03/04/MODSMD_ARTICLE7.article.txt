### Julie Tsai Staff writer 
A commemorative celebration
for late United Farm Workers
leader Cesar Chavez had emo
tions running high last night in a
moving evening of speeches, per

formances and awards in Memo
rial Auditorium.
David Martinez, secretary and
treasurer of United Farm Work
ers, memorialized his late col
league's final days, but he and
other speakers also used the op
portunity to exhort the audience

of 750 to escalate the boycott
against grapes sprayed with
harmful pesticides.
"The (grape) growers' diaboli
cal strategy of suing [United
Farm Workers] is having a devas
tating effect on us," Martinez
said. "The grape industry is the
richest industry in California."
Martinez urged everyone to
take home buttons and bumper
stickers emblazoned "No grapes"
and copies of videotapes docu
menting the harmful effects of
the pesticides.
"We must continue the grape
campaign. . . . Don't let the farm
workers fight alone," he said.
Senior Gabi Cervantes and
sophomore Elvira Prieto, co
chairs of MEChA, also made ap
peals for activism in their com
ments to the audience.
"Even if you're not aware of it,
you're part of the movement,"
Cervantes said.
"We can't afford to lose more
of our generation through
racism," Prieto said.
In remembrance of Chavez,
the leading advocate for the
rights of migrant field laborers,
Martinez spoke warmly about
the man's ability, energy and
dedication to his cause. Accord
ing to Martinez, Chavez would
regularly awaken at 2 a.m. to do
work. In 20 years, he said,
Chavez had vacationed once for

a period of three days.
"Cesar was an organizational
genius," Martinez said of
Chavez's ability to galvanize the
group.
Chavez, who was 66 when he
died 10 months ago, had finished
fasting in protest of field labor
ers' working conditions days be
fore his death.
"He was dying, and we just
couldn't tell," Martinez said, his
voice breaking.
"When he died, I thought I
would later see it as a privilege to
have been the one to advise fami
ly and friends on his death.
Today I simply miss brother
Chavez. The world is a far more
beautiful place because he was
here," he said.
Despite the somber tone of
the addresses, the evening
opened on a festive note with a
colorful, spirited performance
by Ballet Folkorico de Stan
ford. The audience, composed
largely of Chicano and Latino
students and families, was re
sponsive and grew more so as
the night wore on. The evening
included a short documentary
on Chavez.
El Centro Chicano Director
Frances Morales and Assistant
Director Chris Clarke made the
opening remarks in Spanish.
