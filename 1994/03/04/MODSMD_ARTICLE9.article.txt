Israel protest continues
RAM ALLAH, Occupied West Bank (AP)
â€” Israel freed 400 Palestinian prisoners
yesterday in a further effort to soothe sim
mering violence over the Hebron mosque
massacre, while Jewish extremists grew
more defiant of efforts to rein them in.
The government has released 1,000
prisoners in the past three days. Yet there
has been no sign that outraged Palestini
ans in the occupied territories would stop
protesting and or that their leaders would
return to stalled peace talks.
As part of efforts to salvage the peace
process following the massacre last Friday
by a Jewish settler, the Israeli government
has ordered the army to disarm 18 militant
settlers and banned them from Palestinian
areas.
Settler leaders yesterday called on the
extremist Jews to resist being disarmed.

One leader, Uri Ariel, said settlers
shouldn't use violence against troops.
Pentagon: Draft not needed
WASHINGTON (AP) - The govern
ment could end peacetime registration for
the military draft "without irreparable
damage to national security," the Pen
tagon said yesterday. President Clinton
said registration should continue tem
porarily.
The Pentagon stopped short of recom
mending an end to the Selective Service
system, saying, "We should continue draft
registration while we study possible alter
native uses."
President Clinton said in a letter, also
made public yesterday, that the system
should remain in place until the National
Security Council concludes a similar
review this spring.
