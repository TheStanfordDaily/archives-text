Celia Morris
When Anita Hill came forward to testify against
Clarence Thomas in 1991, she told a story that was
too familiar, too devastating —and too public—to
ignore. Now, in a powerful collection of interviews and
commentary, Celia Morris continues to fight the
Hill/Thomas hearings in her new book:
Bearing Witness:
SI Harassment and
|| Everywoman's
Published by Little, Brown and Company
"Interweaving compelling case histories with social commentary, political
writer Morris delivers a sobering study of sexual harassment in afl its lewd
and loathsome guises. ... A groundbreaking book."
—Kirkus Reviews
"Bearing Witness is at once a fascinating and shocking account of the
trials ana roadblocks women of all ages and backgrounds face in the
American workforce, in our schools, and even in our households."
—Congresswoman Olympia J. Snowe, (R-Me.)
Co-chair, Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues
