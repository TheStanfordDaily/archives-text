# Culture, costumes — and a bit of controversy
## Collegiate dance teams celebrate Indian culture in 'Bhangra by the Bay' competition 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Romesh Ratnesar Senior staff writers 
Lavish costumes, spirited folk dancing
and even a bit of controversy marked
"Bhangra by the Bay," the first annual
California collegiate Bhangra champi
onships, held at Kresge Auditorium Sat
urday evening.
The event, sponsored by Sanskriti,
Stanford's club of the Indian subconti
nent, included performances by dance
companies from Stanford, UC-Berkeley,
UC-Davis and Diablo Valley College.
Approximately 500 spectators turned out
for the hour-long competition.
Bhangra, a lively traditional dance
originating in India's Punjab state, fea
tures rhythmic music and sophisticated
choreography. Performers frequently
employ long sticks, scarves and other
props during their routines.
However, young Bhangra dancers in
this country have incorporated contempo
rary dance techniques and music into the
traditional form. "Bhangra is really tak
ing the traditional music, and applying it
to our lives," said sophomore Kiran Kang,
who performs Bhangra frequently and
was part of a panel of five judges at Sat
urday's competition. "It's a product of
different experiences, people in different
part of the world and [the process of]
assimilating."
This was evident during the competi
tion, as one group injorporated '80s
breakdance maneuvers and another took
the stage to C+C Music Factory's pulsing
hit, "Gonna Make You Sweat."
Though the event was intended to
showcase Indian culture and provide
some friendly rivalry among local
schools — Stanford supporters even
chanted "Cal sucks" when the Berkeley
team was introduced — the competition
ended on a bitter note for some home
town fans.
After an uninspiring presentation
from the Diablo Valley College team, a

team from the Punjab Cultural Society —
consisting of students from Berkeley and
Davi^ v — performed against a backdrop of
reggae/, hip-hop and traditional Indian
tunes, 'rispir intricate footwork and elabo
rate use tof props garnered them top
marks from the judges, including perfect
10s in the authenticity category.
In contrast, the Stanford team relied
less on difficult moves than stately,
engaging choreography and the enthusi
asm of the audience. The performance
was highlighted by acrobatics and a cir
cus-like stick-jousting scene.
But when the scores came up, the
stunned crowd listened in disbelief as
Stanford could only muster 7s and 8s
from the judges. The team eventually fin
ished third.
"I think the judges might have been a
little bit biased toward their own team,
and more negative toward the other
teams," Kang said. "It wasn't very fair
(that Stanford finished third)."
Each squad provided a judge for the
competition. Dancers were judged on
authenticity, choreography, dance ability
and overall performance.
Senior Sunil Singhania, one of the
event's coordinators and a dancer on
Stanford's team, said he thought the
judging was fair, and attributed Stan
ford's finish to the judges' emphasis on
the "cleanliness" of the routines.
"They really weren't looking at the dif
ficulty of the moves," he said, adding that
the Stanford group has been practicing
for about 15 hours a week for the last
month.
The event "grew out of a desire to net
work with people from other campuses, to
engage in some friendly competition,"
said senior Rani Deshpande, Sanskriti's
co-chair. Organizers hope to make the
event, which raised about $2,500 for San
skriti and a literary project in India, an
annual occasion.
On the judging, Despande allowed, "I
think the Stanford judge was extremely
fair. That's all I'll say."
