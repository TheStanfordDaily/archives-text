# Faculty club tightens belt
## Club will hike dues, prices 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
As it plans a transition in management, Stanford's
Faculty Club is facing financial difficulties that will
result in increases in membership dues and prices as
well as possible reductions in the hours and range of
services it offers.
The Faculty Club's share of funds from the Uni
versity's staff benefits pool will be reduced and a set
tlement with the Internal Revenue Service will limit
revenue from nonmember business. While the effect
the losses will have remains to be seen, Faculty Club
President Robert Simoni said they will definitely
have a negative impact.
Over the past two years, Simoni said, the Faculty
Club has faced a reduction in financial support from
the University staff benefits pool, from $304,000 in
1991 to $140,000 beginning next year. The reduction
began in 1991 in response to a federal mandate that
the University could no longer include those costs in
the pool, which includes money given by the federal
government to cover staff benefits.
The Faculty Club is considering a number of mea
sures to try to make up for the loss, Simoni said.
Monthly member dues in each membership classifi
cation will be increased between $1 and $3. There will
also be a 5 percent price increase for purchases.
Acting Manager of the Faculty Club Carol
Christofferson said that she expects the price increas
es to have at most a minimal impact on club business.
"I don't think it's going to affect it at all," she said.
Probably only "a few people who never use the club at
all" will discontinue their membership, she added,
given that prices and dues "are so little to start with."
"We'll have to consider some cost-cutting mea
sures as well," Simoni said. Such measures might
include closing on weekends and eliminating special
functions held at the Faculty Club.
Simoni said the Faculty Club will also attempt to
"increase business" and "expand the membership a
bit" by increasing advertising.
The Faculty Club is also encountering financial
difficulties due to an IRS rule that nonprofit private
clubs must limit their revenue from nonmember
business to 15 percent of total revenue. Simoni said
the Faculty Club currently makes about 25 percent of
its revenue from nonmember business.
The Faculty Club negotiated a settlement with the
IRS that will require the Faculty Club to pay $80,000
in back taxes and to cut nonmember business down
to 15 percent. The impact the changes will have on
the Faculty Club is "a little hard to determine at the
moment," Simoni said, though "there will be a finan
cial impact. It will be negative."
It is also unclear how soon the changes will impact
the Faculty Club. Christofferson said most nonmem
ber business comes in the form of weddings, several of
which had been booked prior to the settlement. There
are no plans to cancel those functions, she said.
