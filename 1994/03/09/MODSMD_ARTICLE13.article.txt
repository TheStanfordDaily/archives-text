## Clinton names new chief counsel Washington attorney Lloyd Cutler will serve on a 'temporary basis' 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The White
House acknowledged additional contacts
with federal regulators about the White
water investigation yesterday, even as
President Clinton tried to still ethics
doubts by naming respected Washington
attorney Lloyd Cutler as his chief counsel.
Clinton named Cutler at a late-after
noon news conference. Cutler agreed to
serve only on a temporary basis, up to
130 days, so he wouldn't have to sever
ties with his law firm.
Cutler, 76, a pillar of Washington's
legal establishment, made clear he
wasn't anxious to return to the same job
he'd held in the Carter administration.
"I've done it before, as you know,"
Cutler told reporters outside his home.
"You don't look forward to it, but you do
it. You're asked to do it and you have to
do it."

As Cutler's appointment was about to
be announced, the White House
acknowledged more contacts with regu
lators about Whitewater, raising further
questions about whether the administra
tion had tried to meddle in the federal
investigation.
Previously, the administration had
confirmed contacts on three occasions.
"Based on what we know, there were
some incidental contacts and other fol
low-up conversations," one senior
administration official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. "Nothing dealt
with the substance of the Resolution
Trust Corp. investigations." Asked how
many additional contacts there were, the
official said: "A few."
The official said the additional contacts
became known as a result of conversa
tions and the examination of documents

in the aftermath of subpoenas being
served on administration officials by
Whitewater special counsel Robert Fiske.
Clinton had said he wanted to fill the
counsel's post with an individual of
unquestioned integrity and experience
who would help put his presidency back
on track.
Cutler is known as the sort of lawyer
that business executives turn to when
they have serious problems. His recruit
ment by Clinton was a measure of the
problems facing White House officials as
a result of their mishandling of questions
growing out of the Clintons' investment
in an Arkansas real estate deal.
Six White House officials, including
Cutler's predecessor, Bernard Nuss
baum, and four Treasury officials are
under subpoena in the Whitewater
investigation.
