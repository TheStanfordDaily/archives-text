## Editorial Resurrect the Dead CUE should re-examine current policy on Dead Week for students' sake 
### 
DEAD WEEK is a period of
reduced social and extracur
ricular activity preceding
final examinations. Its purpose is
to permit students to concentrate
on academic work and prepare for
final examinations."
Yeah, right.
The official Dead Week policy
statement certainly makes the
week before finals sound like an
ideal time to catch up on work and
get ready for finals. Unfortunately,
as even freshmen know by now, it's
not.
In reality, many professors use
the last week of the quarter to
introduce new material, often
resorting to cramming in even
more than usual. Reading loads
seem to increase exponentially and
the week culminates in a flurry of
papers, problem sets and projects.
And just three days later, stu
dents start taking finals.
As the Commission on Under
graduate Education continues to
analyze and discuss specific areas
of the Stanford experience, its
members should make sure that
the Dead Week policy gets a good
look — and hopefully a facelift.
Understandably, professors
want to spend as much time as pos
sible presenting new material — 10
weeks is hardly enough time to
properly read and discuss Plato's
"Republic," let alone the entire
contents of a typical syllabus for
Cultures, Ideas and Values. Still,
the tight constraints of the quarter
system cannot be used to justify
heavy work loads during Dead
Week.
Students need some time with
out any work hanging over their
heads to focus on catching up and
preparing for upcoming finals.
Currently, the week before finals is

dead in name only. Stanford
should restore its original intent to
make the end of the quarter —
hardly the most pleasant time — a
bit more bearable.
Other top universities, such as
Harvard and Yale, have policies
that require two-week reading peri
ods with no classes at the end of
each semester. Such a long break is
unfeasible under Stanford's quar
ter system, but one reading week
per term — or three weeks per year
— would ensure that students had
enough time to prepare for finals.
Under the current policy, stu
dents don't have that luxury. Only
a weekend separates the last class
of the quarter — often the due date
for final papers — and the start of
exams. As a result, many students
try to cram 10 weeks of material
the night before the test — only to
promptly forget it a week later.
A true Dead Week without new
material would allow students to
more thoroughly absorb the infor
mation presented during the quar
ter for the long-term. Lax enforce
ment of and little respect for the
current policy has made Dead Week
just another week of the quarter —
and a hectic one at that.
The academic calendar subcom
mittee of the CUE has already dis
cussed the current policy, according
to its chair, Vice Provost for Insti
tutional Planning Geoffrey Cox. If
Stanford does decide to formulate a
new policy, those involved should
make sure that it is more explicit
and better enforced than the cur
rent one.
The fast pace of the quarter sys
tem would probably make a whole
week of no classes impossible.
However, a shortened Dead Week
without classes — perhaps running
from Wednesday to Sunday —
would be a good compromise.
Although it wouldn't be a full
week, such a period would be a
major improvement over the cur
rent Dead Week, which drains life
from students and kills intellectu
alism.
There might not even be need
for a primal scream.
