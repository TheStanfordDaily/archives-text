## Slackers beware: tutorials 
### 
FRIENDS, I AM afraid you find me
an unwilling columnist this week.
You see, this has never happened to
me before, but I have developed an aver
sion to words. Words in books, written
words and, yes, these words on my com
puter screen.
You see, thanks to Oxford University's
academic system, (or Stanford-in-
Oxford's adaptation of it, to be exact), I
have read and written more words in the
last seven weeks than I did my entire
sophomore year at Stanford. I was, well,
a bit of a slacker at Stanford (but if any of
my former professors are reading this, let
me assure you that yours was the one
class I actually did do all the reading in)
and was quickly, immediately reformed
upon arrival in England by a single word
— tutorial.
"Tutorial" —■ in Oxford it is enough to
strike fear and dread into the hearts of
thousands, lost under stacks of books in
the Bodleian Library. In Oxford, tutorials
— one-on-one weekly meetings between
faculty members and students, usually at
which a paper is presented — are the core
of the education system.
Here at Oxford, lectures, which are
usually considered the core of American
college education, make Stanford spring
quarter CIV lectures look well-attended.
Just last week, I went to my English lec
ture class, in which at least 30 students
are enrolled. Only seven students showed
up — and six of them were from Stanford.

Most Oxford students have two tutori
als a week, write an average of 10 to 12
papers in an eight-week term and may
attend (or purport to attend) lecture
classes.
And they read — as an English stu
dent, I feel embarrassingly poorly read
next to my Oxford counterparts, who
not only seem to have been exposed to
every major writer between Anglo-
Saxon times and 1900 (the 20th century
is considered frivolous and unacademic
by many, except for the few "cutting
edge" scholars who study T.S. Eliot or
Virginia Woolf) but also can spew
quotes from major texts as casually as
we memorize our favorite "Seinfeld"
episodes.
But Oxford English students' ability
to quote is not mere overblown academic
snobbery (although it can quite easily be
applied to that purpose). They are accu
mulating knowledge for their be-all and
end-all final exam — the only one that
counts — at the end of their third and
final year. And I can hardly remember
what I learned last quarter (out of what
remnants of knowledge remained after
post-final selective amnesia).
So what is an American student to
make of all this? It's easy to speak in
terms of "better"' or "worse" when mak
ing comparisons, and, in many ways, I do
have to acknowledge that I have encoun
tered a more rigorous, effective education
system at Oxford. The one-on-one tutori

al has both allowed me to thrive in a
totally individualized learning environ
ment and forced me to work, and work
hard. Mind you, I'm not implying that
Stanford students don't work that much
— just that / didn't work that much at
Stanford.
Yet, at the same time, I cannot deem
Oxford's system "better." It is, like so
many things in England, eminently and
painstakingly practical. Everything
works toward the goal of preparing the
students to be completely well-versed —
but only in a single subject. Imagine the
looks of surprise on Oxford students'
faces when I told them that I studied civil
engineering, studio art, Chinese and
English literature, all in one year at Stan
ford. Academic freedom is a wonderful
thing.
Well, I bit the bullet and here are
approximately 600 more words, a few
more "K" out of my computer memory
— mere drops in the bucket. I suppose,
like all phases, word aversion is just
something one has to overcome. Now if
we could only do something about
English-induced potato aversion. . . .
