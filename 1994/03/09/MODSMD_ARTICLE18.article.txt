## Spoon will accept donations using leftover food points 
### 
IN THE MAR. 3 editorial entitled
"Wasting Food Points," The Daily's
editorial board mentioned the
Spoon Hunger Relief Network as "one
organization which might be able to
use students' extra [Food Service]
points." While Spoon (the Stanford
Project on Nutrition) appreciates the
consideration, we are troubled by the
simplistic approach taken by the edito
rial board on this issue.
First, we would like to point out
that using food points to fund worthy
public service projects is not a recent
development. In fact, SIDO, the Stan
ford International Development Orga
nization, has for the last four years
worked with Stanford Food Service to
acquire student donations of food
points during their annual SIDO Fast
for Action Day. These points, in turn,
are converted into money which SIDO
uses to support grassroots projects in
developing countries.
Although Food Service has imposed
increasingly stringent limits on the
amount donated per student, SIDO has
nevertheless generated more money
every year. This trend likely indicates
both increasing student awareness and

a greater responsiveness to SIDO's
cause.
Spoon has also considered the idea
of using leftover points for direct food
donations. However, we have not
actively encouraged such donations for
one key reason: a large-scale donation
using leftover food points, especially by
students who would not otherwise use
their points, would result in increased
costs to Food Service and could lead to
an increase in the future price of meal
plans for all students.
Before writing this letter, we spoke
with Lynn Kaiser, the Systems Manag
er of Food Services. She said Food Ser
vice incorporates a certain percentage
of missed meals and leftover points
into their annual evaluation of meal
plan prices. She added that the per
centage of students who deplete all of
their points remains fairly stable from
quarter to quarter. Thus, a mass move
ment of well-intentioned students sud
denly using up all of their points could
affect future food prices for all stu
dents.
In Spoon's seven-year history,
Spoon volunteers have concentrated
their efforts on collecting unused, left

over food that would otherwise have
been discarded from dining halls and
eateries across the Stanford campus.
Last year we collected over 33,000
pounds of food, which we donated to
several local food kitchens and agencies
for the hungry and homeless.
Spoon also actively promotes food
salvaging at other universities across
the country and organizes volunteer
trips to nearby soup kitchens. Current
ly, Spoon is developing a local outreach
program to promote food salvaging in
the community as well by advising Palo
Alto restaurants on food salvaging pro
cedures and options.
Spoon's goals are to prevent waste,
alleviate hunger in the community,
promote community service as a
lifestyle and accomplish the above
without incurring any extra food costs
to the Stanford population. Since col
lecting leftover food points on a large
scale has the potential for escalating
future meal plan costs, we have not to
date encouraged that option. Although
Spoon is happy to receive food dona
tions from individuals, we have strong
reservations about taking donations
that could eventually result in more

money from the pockets of all students
without their consent.
We agree with The Daily that
diverting end-quarter food points from
"junk food binges" to hungry people in
the local community is a worthwhile
endeavor. Spoon will accept contribu
tions like raisins, granola bars and
fruit juices (items we can use that
Food Service does purchase in bulk)
from students who desire to donate
food with their remaining points at
the end of each quarter. To make a
donation, please talk to your house
Spoon volunteer or contact Spoon
directly.
However, please be aware of the
potential cost effects of large-scale
donations. Spoon does not wish to
encourage food donations from stu
dents who would not otherwise use
their remaining points, but we do urge
you to think twice before you go on
that "junk food binge."
