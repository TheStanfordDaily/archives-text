# Balance necessary in aftermath of massacre
## 
### 
The recent Hebron was abominable,
and an acute shame to anyone who
cares about humanity, the rule of law
and eventual coexistence between
Israel and the surrounding Arab
nations.
The killer was maniacal, but his act
also perpetuated a cycle of violent
intolerance that must be reckoned
with if a just coexistence is to be
achieved.
At Hebron in 1929, Arabs massa
cred 67 Jews, including women, chil-

dren, the aged.
The Tomb of the Patriarchs in
Hebron, where the recent massacre
occurred, is the traditional site of
Abraham's grave, where both Jews
and Arabs now have the right to wor
ship. This place represents the need
for mutual acceptance.
On March 1 The Daily carried a
brief letter from Jewish leaders at
Stanford, expressing outrage and grief
at what happened, and hoping to see
the peace process continue.
Then March 3 three other people
from the Stanford campus wrote to
"call on the Israeli government" alone
to act, when what's needed is pragma
tism from both sides.

What's needed are voices deploring
such things as the recent Hebron mas
sacre, but also deploring the daily,
perennial massacres of Israeli Jewish
civilians, and calling on Fatah and
Hamas to cease obstructing progress.
If one accepts the journalistic credo
of balance — "two peoples with equal
historical claims to the same land" —
then it should also apply to mutual
contrition, as Cynthia Ozick's New
York Times op-ed piece put it.
Let us remember landmarks
in the rejection of coexistence — 1929,
1948, 1967, 1973 — and keep pressing
for a just settlement of this conflict.
