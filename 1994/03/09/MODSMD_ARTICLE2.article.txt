# Millions in losses?
## University files lawsuit for patent infringement 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Senior staff writer 
Attempting to protect its profitable
patent portfolio, the University filed suit
Monday against a Florida transistor manu
facturer for allegedly infringing on elec
tronic switching technology developed by a
Stanford professor.
The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in
San Francisco, claims that Harris Corp.,
formerly RCA Corp., is improperly infring
ing on a patent issued to Electrical Engi

neering Prof. James D. Plummer.
The patent covers devices called insulat
ed gate bipolar transistors, which are com
plicated current-controlling devices used in
products ranging from washing machines
to power plants.
Stanford has not specified the amount of
damages it is seeking, although Gerald
Dodson, the University's attorney, said the
figure will "definitely be in the millions." If
the court rules against Harris, the corpora-
tion could be responsible for up to
three times the amount of damages.
Use of the switching technology
has been growing rapidly in recent
years, making it difficult to ascer
tain a specific damage claim, Dod
son said. Nevertheless, he said he
feels Stanford "has a very strong
case."
According to Plummer, the
switches improve power control and
the connection of digital electronics
to large machinery. Stanford offi
cials estimate that the market for
such switches, which are also used
in electric cars, airplanes and ships,
will reach $350 million by 1997, the
year the patent expires.
"Some of Harris' patent holders
have cited this patent as a teaching
tool for their work," Dodson said.
"That's one of the things that lead
us to conclude that they are using

this technology."
Harris, a $3 billion corporation
and one of the nation's largest man
ufacturers of such switching
devices, has asserted its products do
not infringe on the University's
patent.
Peter Carney, Harris' vice presi
dent for corporate relations,
declined to comment, saying that
the company's attorneys had not
yet seen the lawsuit.
The University has about 550
patents and earns more than $31
million annually from licensing
fees. This the second patent
infringement lawsuit Stanford has
filed in the last 25 years, according
to Kathy Ku, the University's direc
tor of technology licensing.
When businesses want to use
technology patented by Stanford,
they must first sign a licensing
agreement with the University. Ku
said Stanford had tried to negotiate
an agreement with Harris before fil
ing the lawsuit, but was unsuccess
ful.
