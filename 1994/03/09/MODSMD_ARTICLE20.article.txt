# Letters Policy

### 
The Daily welcomes letters from
its readers. Letters will be published
at the editor's discretion and are
subject to editing.
Letters should be turned in on a
Macintosh disk in Microsoft Word
format with a paper copy of the sub
mission. Disks may be picked up two
days after the letter has been sub
mitted.
Letters may also be sent on e
mail to ops@daily.stanford.edu.
