# N'Gai Croal: fly in the buttermilk
## Kick out white students? Aman Verjee thinks so 
### 
YES, I HAT'S what Review colum
nist Aman Verjee was forced to
admit that the University should do
under its present admissions policy, which
targets qualified black, latino and Native-
American students for recruitment under
affirmative action guidelines.
But somehow, he left out that conclu
sion when he wrote his Feb. 14 column. In
that piece, he scapegoated black students,
not white students who take the place of
"more qualified Asians" — to use his
words — for the decline of Stanford. He
wrote: "It seems that black students have
moved from the back of the bus to the
back of the class, and that they have
brought Mexican-Americans with them."
Verjee based his claim that affirmative
action hurts minorities at Stanford on a
study that he conducted. He got the
names of the Phi Beta Kappa class of
1993, used photographs of Kappans in
froshbooks and the Stanford Quad —
most of which were black-and-white — to
determine the race of each. He then got
the racial breakdown of the senior Class
of 1993 from the Office of Admissions,

took his trusty calculator, and voilA:
blacks and on the bottom, whites
and Asian-Americans on top.
If looking at pictures of students to
determine their race, simply throwing out
the 20 students who had no picture and
using Phi Beta Kappa data to infer the
performance of the entire student body is
what passes for serious scholarship at
Stanford today, the University has a prob
lem far greater than its affirmative action
program.
On Monday, Veijee rode into Ujamaa
on his high horse to help black students
slay the dragon that holds them back in
America: affirmative action. But like
another well-known knight, his attempt
was as effective as tilting at windmills, as
the students in attendance let him know.
Rather than engage Veijee's fatally
flawed study, I exposed the biased way in
which he used his "research." If neither
white students nor Asian-American stu
dents — whom he said are "more quali
fied" than their white counterparts — are
targeted by admissions, why are there
fewer Asian-American students in the

entering classes than whites?
Why didn't he write, "It seems that
white students have gotten back on the
Mayflower and are sailing backwards to
the old country, and they are taking black,
and Native-American students
with them." Why does he co-identify with
"less-qualified" whites in order to scape
goat black students? Wisely, he avoided
those questions.
This should not come as a surprise to
any of us. Because the Stanford adminis
trators who essentially apologize for their
admissions policies — President Gerhard
Casper and Dean of Admissions James
Montoya — respond to Verjee's rhetoric
based on the same incomplete logic as
Verjee himself.
In an interview with The Review, Mon
toya responded to Verjee's study in this
way: "Without question, we continue to
see African-Americans and Mexican-
Americans coming to Stanford whose
background has not included college. A
high proportion of them come from large
public institutions. For many of those stu
dents, they are not as well prepared. They

have the ability to be outstanding. In the
first year of their Stanford career, their
grades are not as high as those who have
been better prepared in high school."
My high school English teacher always
warned me to look for what the passive
voice hides. No matter how well-inten
tioned Montoya's statement, it doesn't
indicate why black or Latino students may
be less prepared.
Why didn't their parents attend col
lege? Why don't large public schools ade
quately prepare students? He doesn't say;
presumably, that's just the way things
are. Similarly, when Casper refuses to
release admissions data because "the edu
cational goals of Stanford are not cap
tured by quantitative criterion of any
sort," he too dodges the issue.
Why don't the administrators admit
that America was founded on a social
order that put blacks and Native-Ameri
cans at the bottom, whites on top, and
everyone else somewhere in between?
That white male landowners have had
more than 300 years of affirmative action,
not meritocracy? That we must examine

the role each of us play in maintaining
that social order, which will then forever
necessitate affirmative action — to let a
few minorities slip through the cracks so
that the rest don't revolt?
This denial of the American nightmare
gives Veijee the cover he needs to extol
the virtues of his immigrant group, then
wonder aloud why the rest of us "immi
grants" can't do the same. It gives him
license to ask a roomful of black students
why we think "our oppression is worse
than anyone else's," then attribute our
"lack of achievement" to the pacifier that
is affirmative action.
But I support Veijee's call for the
release of admissions data, even though
his motives are suspect. If our administra
tors — themselves trained at the best uni
versities in the world — can't come up
with a better explanation of what purpose
affirmative action serves and how we can
change society to render it unnecessary,
they shouldn't let any of us in. Really.
