## World Wide Web offers simpler Internet access System helps network users find information 
### Bryan Johnson 
The World Wide Web, a system which
connects information scattered across
the international computer network
Internet, gives students easier access to
information.
Developed by scientists at CERN, a
European nuclear physics research lab,
the Web is designed to reduce the
amount of information the user has to
remember in order to access a particu
lar piece of data contained in the net.
The Web is most commonly accessed
through Mosaic, a program developed
by the National Center for Supercom
puting Applicat ions at the University of
Illinois.
Normally, to retrieve information
using the Internet, a user must know
where the data is located and how to con
nect to that particular computer. Access
ing the same piece of information more
than once requires either remembering a
complex sequence of instructions or
repeating the entire search process.
Using the Web, however, allows a user
to navigate from file to file without hav
ing to worry about where the next piece
of information is physically located. All
technical details are taken care of by
Mosaic and a few other helper applica
tions.
At Stanford earlier this year, Rin
conada became the first college residence
to have a presence on the Web, contain
ing its newsletter, information on its
annual Rinc-a-Delt party and an archive
of dorm photos.
Stanford students will also be able to
read The Daily using the Web, thanks to
a small group of students working to
make the paper available electronically.

Starting this year, senior Noah Mer
cer — who is also the editor of Proteus,
The Daily's multimedia project — has
been overseeing an effort to put the
newspaper on-line. The project's final
goal will be to allow users from around
the world to access both the current
paper and a searchable archive of past
issues.
The current Daily should be available
on-line as early as the beginning of next
quarter. Back issues dating from after
the service starts will also be available,
but a larger archive of past issues and the
ability to search by subject or author may
not be available before next year.
A few other university newspapers,
including MlT's weekly paper, are already
available electronically. However, the
Daily project is more ambitious, since it is
published more frequently and will pro
vide photographs on-line as well as text.
All data on the Web is contained in a
series of documents known as "pages."
Each page is formatted in a standard
known as Hyper-Text Markup Language
(HTML) which tells the user's computer
whether the information transmitted is
text, pictures or sound, and how it should
be formatted.
Traveling among different pages is
accomplished through "links," special
underlined words. Clicking on a link will
automatically retrieve the desired infor
mation without requiring the user to
know where or how Mosaic is connecting
across the Internet. Accessing a file from
a computer across the Pacific is no more
difficult than from one located in the
same room.
Thus, anyone can roam from page to
page according to his or her interests,
without having to follow a set hierarchi

cal pattern or knowing where the next
link might lead. If a user does know
exactly where he or she wants to go, on
the other hand, direct access is also possi
ble, and just as easy.
The Web and HTML also allow data
providers to embed pictures, sounds and
even movies into their text, and thus cre
ate much more interesting and complete
documents. Mosaic versions exist for
Macintosh, DOS and UNIX-based mac
hines, allowing data transfer between all
types of hardware.
The Web makes it possible for organi
zations to make information about
themselves available on the Internet

much more easily than they could other
wise. Adding a page requires nothing
more than a computer connected to the
Internet and running a particular soft
ware program. Existing documents can
also be easily converted to HTML for
Web use.
Palo Alto was the first city to have a
page on the Web, and provides informa
tion on many aspects of the city, includ
ing color street maps. Stanford also has a
Web site, containing general information
about the University and specific infor
mation on several departments and
ongoing projects in the Computer Sci
ence Department and elsewhere.
