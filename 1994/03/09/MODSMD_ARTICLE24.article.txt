## Painful urination can mean trouble

Q; Why does it hurt when I
pee?
— Jonathan Eisen
A: It's nice to see that the
intellectual caliber of ques
tions sent to this desk by mem
bers of the Stanford communi
ty remains at its traditional
level.
I must confess an inability
to specifically answer this
week's question — not being a
urologist (even an amateur),
and not having examined Mr.
Eisen's plumbing in any detail,
I'm at a loss when it comes to
nailing down the problem.
Therefore, I'll have to employ
a sort of "shotgun" approach
to answering.
Although there are a vast
assortment of possible sources
for a problem like painful uri
nation, two fairly common
ones — and one which, while
far more interesting to con
template, is fortunately
extremely rare — come to
mind.
If Mr. Eisen's urinations
are accompanied by a pustu
lent discharge, the problem
may involve a venereal disease
of bacterial origin.
Pus is a whitish mass com
posed of dead cells which often
builds up at the site of a mas
sive immune response. Both
dead bacterial cells and spent
immune cells comprise a
"healthy" share of pus.
If this is the case, he
should: see a doctor about
antibiotic treatment, for
which the prognosis is fairly
optimistic; refrain from
unprotected sexual contact;
and inform all of his "special
friends" that they should be
consider a visit to a urologist
or family practitioner.
Absent a pustulent dis
charge, venereal disease is still
a possibility, but in such a case
the risk of bladder infection
also rears its ugly head. Fur
ther indications of bladder
infection include (but are not
limited to) a constitutive level
of pain — even between urina
tions — and, in severe cases,

blood in the urine.
Although some readers may
be tittering right now, bladder
infections are nothing to laugh
at.
They can cause permanent
damage or even kill. A famous
example of a prominent figure
laid low by such a proletarian
malady is Tycho Brahe, a
court astronomer and contem
porary of Johannes Kepler,
who died feverish and deliri
ous when an uncontrolled
bladder infection spread to
other bodily systems.
Fortunately, antibiotic
treatment for bladder infec
tion is straightforward and
generally successful.
A final but rare possibility
is a phenomenon known as
"retrograde ejaculation."
Without going into too
much detail, I'll tell you that
this malady involves ejacula
tion of semen upstream
through the urethra into the
bladder.
It results from a decrease in
tone of one of the muscles
involved in keeping liquid
excretion and reproductive
functions in separate pipes or
in a given pipe at separate
times.
Retrograde ejaculation can
cause pain in its own right or
lead to infection of the bladder
(see above).
The bottom line is this: I'd
like to tell anyone who experi
ences pain during urination to
high-tail it to a medical profes
sional.
I can make suggestions and
quack diagnoses, but I can't be
sure what the problem is and I
can't prescribe the appropriate
antibiotics.
And that is true because —
folks — I'm not a doctor. I
don't even play one on TV.

and soaking in the sun in Hol
lywood, but if you drop your
scientific questions in the Bug
Box, located just outside The
Daily offices at the western
entrance of Storke Publica
tions Building, or e-mail them

he will be here again next
quarter to answer them.
