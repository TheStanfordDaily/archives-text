# Questions raised in gene ownership issue
## Prof argues nations should attempt to trade information as freely as possible 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Increases in gene-manipulation technology
have raised questions about whether an indi
vidual should be allowed to claim ownership
over specific strains of plants and animals.
Because recent advances have highlighted
the value of the raw information contained
within the genes, International Law Prof.
John Barton says nations should strive to cre
ate a "free flow of genetic resources."
At a lecture delivered two weeks ago to the
American Association for the Advancement of
Science, Barton — along with Wolfgang
Siebeck, a legal adviser to the international
agricultural community — said countries are
now beginning to assert ownership over the
biological resources found within their bor
ders.
The pair suggested that gene banks make
recipients of genetic information aware that
countries may claim they own the intellectual
property rights to the organisms available at
the centers. This would allow the countries
claiming ownership to arrange for compensa
tion and regulate the access to the gene pool.
But Barton stressed that the best way to
ensure that the benefits of genetic advances
reach across the entire globe is to create a free
system for trading the technology.
"The benefits to the developing world far
outweigh any money they would obtain
through ownership," he said. "There are
plenty of people arguing about genetic
resources . . . but solutions traditionally put
financial return in a primary position."
According to Barton, there are two separate
interests involved in the debate over genetic
information — environmentalists and the
agricultural community.
Because their perspectives differ widely, he
said they must both be considered in formu

lating a proposal for the future of the technol
ogy.
"The agricultural community wants more
environmentally sustainable genes" in order
to produce crops which can grow in climates
which are unsuitable for most plant life, Bar
ton said.
"The ministries of the environment of var
ious nations involved in these negotiations
might put more emphasis on the money
aspect," he added.

Traditionally, the stronger crops produced
through genetic engineering have gone, in
part, to aid developing countries which need
stronger plants because of harsh climates
among other difficulties.
Barton and Siebeck, who have been work
ing for the International Plant Genetic
Resources Institute in Rome, wrote that
exchanges of genetic information among
nations also aid in the production of stronger
plant species.
However, Barton said, because of the possi
bility of financial return, "a fair number of
developing countries will most likely try to
exploit their genetic diversity."
Under the Convention on Biological Diver
sity, signed in 1992 by more than 150 coun

tries, starting at the beginning of this year,
countries should be able to derive profits from
genetic material — a move which may have
confirmed Barton's fears.
"There's nothing we can do about that
agreement," Barton said. "It's a done deal. . . .
I just hope some type of compromise can be
reached."
The accord, which also allows nations to
assert their sovereign rights over genetic
material, may help research efforts even
though it allows profit taking.
"I think patent rights do make sense," Bar
ton said. They aid in creating the research by
giving scientists the impetus and funding
which can "make their discoveries more
worthwhile."
Barton and Seibeck said at the conference
that, though the system of exchanging infor
mation and technology has become more com
plex because of the new agreement, a middle
ground solution can still apply.
They recommended that genetic centers
both work with countries to develop material
transfer accords and a reporting system, while
at the same time helping developing countries
collect their profits.
Despite their statements that centers
should take an active role in promoting
exchanges, they said that impartiality will be
crucial in insuring that the future is fair to
both industrialized and developing nations.
"In no case should the centers agree to col
lect royalties," they wrote, trying to create a
compromise which would aid both the coun
tries and the centers.
However, they admitted that the countries
themselves will have to ensure that the sys
tem works.
Material transfer agreements can lay the
groundwork for mutual understanding, col
laboration and fair play, Barton and Seibeck
wrote. "But replace them, they cannot."
