# America lags in use of new expert systems
## Japanese industry may soon be putting technology to work at a faster rate 
### Michael Slemmer Editorial staff 
Application of new technology
has always been a method used
to improve the operation of busi
nesses and industries.
For years, the United States
has been the leader in developing
and implementing new tech
niques for making work both
quicker and more efficient.
But according to Computer
Science Prof. Edward Feigen
baum, American industrial oper
ations are allowing the Japanese
to catch up in their use of so
called "expert-system" technolo
gy — one of the reasons for
Japan's continued success in the
marketplace.
Feigenbaum said that, while
American companies might
engage in "endless analysis and
discussion" about the implemen
tation of technology, there are
not as many barriers to introduc
ing expert systems in Japanese
firms.

These expert systems them
selves generally take the form of
computer programs designed to
aid people in carrying out a vari
ety of tasks — ranging from
scheduling people's daily activi
ties to helping them actually do
their work.
For example, Feigenbaum
said the systems have found
their way into manufacturing,
saving businesses a great deal of
money.
"A system used by Ford of
Europe called Cape . . . assists
cost estimators in producing
extremely accurate estimates of
the cost of making different
parts for a car," Feigenbaum
said. The company needs "accu
rate estimates for negotiating.
[The system) saves them several
million dollars."
Because expert systems are
currently some of the most suc
cessful implementations of artifi
cial intelligence in the commer
cial sector, they are now in use
throughout the nation.

In addition, they require busi
nesses to put forward a great
deal of commitment in order to
successfuly implement expert
systems because of their com
plexity.
Despite the possible mone
tary and efficiency-related bene
fits coming from the new sys
tems, the findings of a panel
chaired by Feigenbaum and
assembled by the Japanese
Technology Evaluation Center
at Loyola College in Maryland
pointed out that while these sys
tems currently exist in a wide
variety of American settings
including government, business
and industry, the U.S. may soon
be lagging in implementation of
expert systems.
In fact, Feigenbaum said that
although the U.S. continues to
lead the pack in terms of
research at the university level,
Japan has now taken the lead in
the quality of applications of the
new technology.
Feigenbaum pointed to soft

ware companies in the two coun
tries as one of the reasons for the
downturn in American utiliza
tion of expert systems. He said
Japanese computer companies
are more willing to provide soft
ware and support than their
American counterparts.
Because of this increased
emphasis on technology which is
now prevalent in Japan, their
industries and businesses are
able to reap the benefits of expert
systems.
In contrast, within the U.S.,
most of the support for expert
systems is coming from small
software companies, he said.
Though the technology has
spread within both nations,
Feigenbaum said it may soon be
Japan and not the U.S. which
takes the leading role in produc
ing new and better expert sys
tems for use in industry.
Feigenbaum said he plans to
teach a course during spring
quarter which will focus on the
use of expert systems technology.
