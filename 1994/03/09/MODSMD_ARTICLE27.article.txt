# Co-educational cohabitation
## How an experiment in living became a way of life 
### Julie Makinen Senior staff writer 
January, 1967: the civil rights
movement was in full swing,
protests against the Vietnam war
were brewing on campus and the
Phi Delts had just been kicked
out of their house for the rest of
the year.
So when Stanford's provost
called Histoiy Prof Mark Man
call in December 1966, and asked
him if he wanted to start up the
co-ed house he had been talking
about, "it was time to put up or
shut up," Mancall says.
Mancall decided to put up,
quickly convening a group of
students to organize "Grove
House," Stanford's first attempt
at a co-ed, "educationally orient
ed" residence. Several students
worked on the project through
winter break, and in winter
quarter 31 men and 12 women
moved into the experiment,
named for "Milton's Groves of
Academe."
Grove House's residents —
picked from about 300 appli
cants — ranged from freshmen
to graduate students and includ
ed students from overseas.
"Development" was the edu
cational focus of the house, and
students received credit for tak
ing seminars on such issues as
biology and ecology, education,
violence and the culture of pover
ty-
Despite being put together at
the last minute, the recipe for

Grove proved a success, says
Assoc. Director of Undergradu
ate Admissions Jon Reider, who
lived in the house as a Stanford
senior.
"Grove was a self-energizing
place that was very sponta
neous," remembers Reider. "The
end result was very good. . . .
People felt comfortable talking
about ideas."
According to Reider, faculty
members dined at Grove almost
every night, one of the students
started an "art gallery" in the
house, and "there was a great
deal of intellectual camaraderie"
— exactly what Mancall had
hoped to achieve.
"When I came to Stanford,
the thing I found appalling was
that nothing was happening in
the dorms," remembers Mancall,
who earned his doctorate at Har
vard. Stanford, he says, was
replicating the conventional
divide between "work hours"
and "non-work hours" in its aca
demic and residence programs.
"I was one of the people who
believe education is a way of life,
that it shouldn't stop at 5 p.m.
when classes end."-
Although "intellectual pur
suits" were a key component of
the house, the "integrated" liv
ing between the sexes was the
aspect of Grove that attracted
the most attention and conster
nation.
"Co-ed living was very bother
some to the administration,"
recalls Mancall. "You cannoi

imagine the narrowness of mind
at the old Stanford. . . . There
was antagonism from other
houses on campus — there was a
feeling that co-ed housing was
wrong, too radical."
Men and women lived on sep
arate sides of Grove, separated
by a swinging door installed
especially for the house. After 11
p.m., the door would swing in
only one direction, barring
entrance to the women's section.
Grove provided the first
opportunity for women and men
to interact 24 hours a day, seven
days a week. "Social events don't
allow a boy and girl to really
know each other. Here we see
fellows as they are," one woman
resident told The Daily that
year.
Despite widespread fears
about sexual contact, few house
residents dated each other.
Rather, they became compan
ions, says Mancall.
"People really began to devel
op very healthy human relation
ships," he says. But it "took a
long time for people to realize
that (men and women) living
together made what they feared
less likely."
At the end of the year, the
Grove project was forced to relo
cate to Donner because the Phi
Delts were to return to their
house. In the early 19705, Grove
returned to the Row, in a house
that sat kitty corner from Bob.
At that time, Reider returned to
Stanford and served as Glove's

RA for two years. Mancall con
tinued to teach in the house.
"It was a Mecca, it was a place
to come," recalls Reider. But as
the activism of the '60s died
down, and Grove became more
integrated with the emerging
"residential education" system,
the dynamism of Grove began to
fade.
"I knew it was dead in '73,
when I heard they had the foot
ball coach come speak one
night," says Reider. "We never
would have done that in the old
Grove."
But while the vibrancy of the
original Grove wasn't sustained

in that particular house, some of
its features were reincarnated in
other parts of the residence sys
tem — including the Structured
Liberal Education program,
founded largely by Mancall in
1974, which picked up the aca
demic energy of the program.
"Grove was a bold experiment
that provided a common intellec
tual experience for a selected,
and self-selected, groups of stu
dents," says former Dean of Stu
dents Jim Lyons. "It tweaked
the imaginations of people
around here."
Nevertheless, some believe
the original spirit of Grove has

never been fully replicated. Per
haps it was the diminuendo of
social activism in larger society,
or the rapid expansion of pro
gram houses, theme programs
and other activities that caused
the flavor of Grove to get lost in
the shuffle.
"Stanford in the '80s and '90s
hasn't really been a place that
encourages students to become
intellectually and politically
active," says Mancall. "Grove
was not a 'theme' house in
today's sense of the word. . . .
The intellectual free-for-all that
was Grove can get lost in the
specificity of a theme."

the Phi Delt house, began admitting residents of both sexes in 1967.
