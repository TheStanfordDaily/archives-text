# Heightened interest in spring elections
## 36 candidates will try for 20 undergraduate seats, large increase over last year 
### Jim Luh Staff writer 
The race for the ASSU Senate should be
more heated this year as the number of both
undergraduate and graduate candidates has
increased by almost 50 percent over 1993.
The campaign for the Council of Presidents
also will be more competitive this year, as two
slates have declared their candidacy. Last
year, only one slate appeared on the ballot.
There are 36 candidates on the ballot com
peting for the 20 undergraduate senate seats,
compared to 25 last year. Only 4 of the candi
dates are incumbents.
One possible reason for the increased inter
est was "because last year was so apathetic,"
according to ASSU Elections Commissioner
Tom Tsao. More students may have decided to
run this year after seeing how easy it was to
win a senate seat last year, he said.
Tsao said another explanation may be the
renewed activity by the People's Platform

party. Ten undergraduate candidates listed
affiliations with the People's Platform party.
In the race for graduate senate seats, only
10 candidates filed nominating petitions — an
increase from the six who appeared on last
year's ballot. The remainder of the 20 gradu
ate senate seats will have to be filled by write
in candidates.
"There isn't as much interest in graduate
people running," Tsao said. Barring massive
write-in campaigns, the candidates on the
ballot are almost guaranteed victory, he
added.
The two COP slates on the ballot are "The
Teamsters," sponsored by the Hammer and
Coffin Party, and "Students' Voice," spon
sored by the People's Platform. "The Team
sters" includes seniors Peter Marks, Doug
Miro and Tony Sirna and sophomore Scott
Gagner. "Students' Voice" includes juniors
Mork Murdock, Lisa Lee and Anietie Ekanem
and sophomore Vanessa Alvarado.
There are also two senior class president

slates on the ballot. "The Fab Four" includes
Eric Chen, Paula Dybdahl, Kevin Harrington
and Sarah-Marie Martin. "The Bottom Line"
includes Alexa Constantinides, Reena Gulati,
Alisa Kamigaki and Nick Kolodny.
Also on the ballot are two constitutional
amendments. One amendment, which the
senate placed on the ballot fall quarter, would
change the special fee approval system to
allow undergraduate and graduate students
to vote separately for special fees.
The other amendment would divide the
undergraduate senate into six geographic dis
tricts and four class districts and make every
senator a voting senator. It was placed on the
ballot by petition under the sponsorship of
undergraduate senator Gabe Lucas after the
senate rejected similar plans proposed by
Lucas.
There are no candidates for Student Con
duct Legislative Council, which interprets the
Fundamental Standard. The office is typically
filled by write-in votes.
