# Defending culture
## Conference focuses on art as vehicle for social change, cultural growth 
### José Jesus Gutierrez Staff writer 
Dr. Amalia Mesa-Bains, a Chi
cano activist and artist with a doc
torate in clinical psychology, spoke
on the importance of Chicano art
and its ifuerza! — its power, as a
voice — in the keynote address for
a conference on Chicano activism
in the arts and media.
There has been "a long-lasting
Chicano tradition and legacy of
using art as forms of media," said
Mesa-Bains, speaking to a group
of about 50 in History Corner
Friday night. "[This form ofl
mass media serves as a means for
us to achieve social change."
Presented by the Chicano
Graduate Student Association on
Friday and Saturday, the confer
ence discussed issues surround
ing the media's portrayal of the
Chicano culture and the impor
tance of activist involvement
within the community.
According to Mesa-Bains —
who believes that one should
defend community and culture
"by any means necessary" — Chi
cano art achieves social change by
depicting the culture's true spir
it, unlike "stereotypical media
portrayals that degrade the Chi
canos' identity, and become ads
for Taco Bell."
Mesa-Bains also spoke about
the first Chicano movement,
emphasizing that although it
may have ended, the art, the
music the community centers
have not. "They still have the
ifuerza!"
In their involvement with art

and the media, Mesa-Bains said
Chicanos face a problem with the
expectations of "mainstream
institutions."
"We become devalued within
the larger art history, within the
larger art institutions," she said.
"Many times, mainstream insti
tutions go against my stan
dards."
In response to this predica
ment, Mesa-Bains believes the
conference served as a positive
insight into the kinds of skills,
and ifuerzas! Chicanos will need
in facing a more complex problem
than the first movement faced
more than 20 years ago.
"[The conference] lets Chi
canos know that there is some
thing for them out there. It gives
them a consciousness of
activism," she said.
"The conference was informa
tive and inspiring," said fresh
man Cecilia Tavera, who attend
ed the keynote address. "By talk
ing with some of the Chicano
artists and activists that re
shaped society, and paved the
road for my success and involve
ment [as a Chicano], I am further
motivated to use my talents to
counter stereotypical attacks on
my culture."
In addition to Mesa-Bains,
artists/activists Ester Hernandez
and Carmen Lomas Garza, as
well as documentary filmmaker
Olivia Olea, Pocho Magazine car
toonist Lalo Lopez, and other
Chicano activists served on dif
ferent panels on Saturday to
express their support to the Chi
cano community.
