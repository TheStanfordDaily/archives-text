Emphasizing that community benefit can result
from personal adversity, University Provost Con
doleezza Rice celebrated the life of Jane Lathrop
Stanford on Sunday during the 90th Founder's Day
Address held in Memorial Church.
"Those of us who owe her so much need to know
her story and need to internalize its lesson," Rice
said.
Though Stanford is sometimes seen as merely a
grief-stricken mother, a determined educator or a
meddling dowager, Rice's talk — titled "Jane Stan
ford: Spiritual Legacy as Struggle" — focused on
what Rice called the "core belief" behind all of these
roles.
Jane Stanford was a woman driven by the convic
tion "that out of personal struggle one can do great
things for others," Rice said, noting that this is a "be
lief worthy of recapturing" in the University today.
"Only through struggle do people or institutions

realize their strength and resilience,"
Rice added.
Rice used the example of her own
mother's life and death to illustrate that
"finding peace in the midst of pain is the

true fulfillment of one's humanity."
When her mother was diagnosed with
cancer while Rice was still in high school,
Rice said she "feared her death ... every
waking moment." It wasn't until her
mother passed away 15 years later that
Rice truly understood how strength can
come from sorrow, she said.
Beyond merely finding strength
through hardship, Jane Stanford took

her work one step further — by turning
her personal sorrow into good for other
people, Rice said. "Stanford University
was founded by people who were able to
let go of their personal pain for the ben
efit of others."
And while most are not faced with
such momentous opportunities every
day, "there are times in our lives when
we are called to do the same," Rice said.

Instead of focusing on struggle and
pain as a badge of self-entitlement, Rice
said we should look instead at how
much we have been given. "Nothing
good is born of personal struggle if it is
used ... to point to those who have
struggled less," she said.
Rice delivered her speech at the Uni
versity Public Worship Service, a non
denominational Christian gathering.
