# TV violence harmful for kids, panelists say
## First Lady, media personalities agree on need for responsible programming 
### Jennifer Rosen Staff writer 
First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton criticized "sensational
ism" and excess violence in the
news at the National Conference
on Children and the News
Media, held at the Children's
Hospital last weekend.
"Saturating children with
increasingly graphic and sensa
tional stories of violence prevent
them from developing the emo
tional and psychological tools they
need to deal with violence," said
Clinton, who attended the confer
ence on Friday live via satellite.
Clinton later admitted that
neither she nor her husband
watch the news, prompting pan
elist Linda Ellerbee to wonder
how Clinton could accurately
denounce it.
The two-day conference was
co-sponsored by Stanford Univer
sity, UCLA and Children Now, an
advocacy organization for chil
dren centered in the Bay Area.
Panelists initiated Friday's
discussion by attempting to delin
eate news reporters' responsibili
ties. "The job of television news is
not to represent anybody at all,
it's there to report on people,"
said President of FOX News Van
Gordon Sauter.
Some panelists believed they

were not responsible for catering
to the needs of children, while
others disagreed. "All of us know
the whole future is the kids and
unless we get .. . journalists . ..
to think that part of their job is to
promote interest in kids, we're
just going to repeat what we're
doing," said former Federal Com
munications Commission Chair
Newton Minow.
Panelists agreed that the econ
omy is the driving force behind
the media, often overshadowing
their ethical commitment to soci
ety.
"Networks are basically fight
ing for their share of [a] shrink
ing pie thanks to cable. . .. The
more desperate they get, the
more they decide how to pander
to the basest instincts of their
audience," said National Public
Radio commentator Daniel
Schorr.
The conference then focused
on whether excessive violence in
the news media detrimentally
affects children.
Clinton spoke after Friday's
morning panel. "We all want our
children to experience their child
hood's without being afraid. . . .
But [this] seems less and less real
to children who are routinely
bombarded with words and pic
tures that seldom portray young
people living that way," she said.

A recent survey by the Center
for Media and Public Affairs
showed that the network news
coverage of murder and violence
had doubled last year, even
though the nation's overall crime
rate had remained the same.
Clinton specified the dangers
that unnecessary violence in the
media imposes on children. "The
stories validate, sometimes even
glamorize dysfunctional behav
ior. Violence becomes normal and
in an odd way even painless."
"Children become numbed to
violence. . . . They develop an
ironic detachment from life, a
fatalism that prevents them from
trusting anyone or anything," she
added.
Clinton said she believes the
news media must exercise bal
ance and judgment. "When vio
lence is newsworthy enough to be
reported, it should be balanced
with stories that provide children
with positive images of them
selves and those around them,"
she said.
An afternoon panel proposed
solving the problem by creating
news programs specifically tar
geted at children. Although some
people view children's shows as
simplistic, Ellerbee — who
writes, produces and anchors
Nick News, a TV news magazine
for kids — contends, "If you think

that producing news for kids is a
matter of scaling down, then
you're looking in the wrong direc
tion. This is the hardest work I've
ever done."
One child panelist said, "If you
tell the truth, adults are going to
like it. One lady that I talked to
yesterday said that she really
liked [children's shows], but don't
tell anyone. It's like Kellogg's
Frosted Flakes. . . . [Adult news]
is sometimes hard to understand,
and adults will watch the kids
shows too."
One audience member said
that instead of engaging in a
"philosophical, sometimes self
serving" discussion, more empha
sis should be placed on "how to
make sure children are in contact
with well-intended adults" and
"that there are constructive, edu
cational, fun things for them to
do other than watching TV."
"You take away children and
youth centers ... and we wonder
why our children are overexposed
to television," she said.
"I think that I would have
liked to have seen more solu
tions," said sophomore Adam
Fingerhut, who attended the con
ference. He also said that, ironi
cally, many of the panelists
neglected the children's opinions
and instead concentrated on their
own views.

for kids — contends, "If you think

that producing news for kids is a
matter of scaling down, then
you're looking in the wrong direc
tion. This is the hardest work I've
ever done."
One child panelist said, "If you
tell the truth, adults are going to
like it. One lady that I talked to
yesterday said that she really
liked [children's shows], but don't
tell anyone. It's like Kellogg's
Frosted Flakes. . . . [Adult news]
is sometimes hard to understand,
and adults will watch the kids
shows too."
One audience member said
that instead of engaging in a
"philosophical, sometimes self
serving" discussion, more empha
sis should be placed on "how to
make sure children are in contact
with well-intended adults" and
"that there are constructive, edu
cational, fun things for them to
do other than watching TV."
"You take away children and
youth centers ... and we wonder
why our children are overexposed
to television," she said.
"I think that I would have
liked to have seen more solu
tions," said sophomore Adam
Fingerhut, who attended the con
ference. He also said that, ironi
cally, many of the panelists
neglected the children's opinions
and instead concentrated on their
own views.
