# Don't call us, we'll call you
## Hollywood agents chat with Stanford hopefuls 
### Kyle Graham Staff writer 
An hour into a question-and-answer session
with elite Hollywood agents Rick Nicita and Paula
Wagner last Friday, one member of the audience
finally asked the questions which seemed to be on
everyone's mind.
"Can you get me a job? Could you represent
me?"
Responding deftly, Nicita answered, "You
wouldn't want me to. The agency I represent and
I don't like to fail, and our strength isn't in deal
ing with unknowns. We think we'd fail. You could
do better."
Just another moment in the life of a Hollywood
agent, a life which Nicita and Wagner discussed
before an audience of approximately 70 at the Law
School during an appearance sponsored by the
Stanford Entertainment Network — a new stu
dent group designed to inform and assist students
interested in careers within the entertainment
industry
Nicita and Wagner, also husband and wife,
engaged in a lively discussion with the audience,
alternately offering advice on starting a career in
the movie industry, revealing insider stories con
cerning Hollywood figures and discussing the real
ities of life as a "player" within the entertainment
world.
The majority of the audience's questions con
cerned getting a foothold in the movie industry.
In response, Wagner and Nicita stressed the
importance of patience and a willingness to do
anything to get started in the industry. "You've
got to crawl under the fence somehow," said Nici
ta.
"From the acting side, determination is very
important. Talent alone will not do it you have to
create your opportunities, and face the endless

public rejection of your very essence," he added.
Nicita and Wagner offered further specialized
advice to job-seekers in particular fields. On act
ing, Nicita said, "Act wherever you can, with
whomever you can."
Regarding scriptwriters, he suggested that
writers sending a script to an agent should ear
mark their cover letter with the name of a par
ticular client. "Then, I'm far more likely to read
it or have it [read]. If it says, 'I wrote this with
Geena Davis in mind,' then I ask — 'Is this
Geena's next film? Did the thunderbolt
strike?' "
On being an agent, Nicita, who serves as head
of the Talent Department at Creative Artists'
Agency and also represents figures such as
Madonna, Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese,
said, "It's a hands-on, 'feel' type of business.
There's no book to read, or courses to take. . . .
You have to have a certain amount of confidence
and inspire a certain amount of trust, because
people are placing their most valuable asset,
themselves, with you."
Wagner, also a former agent who is now Tom
Cruise's production partner, added, "You have to
be a good salesperson, 'the bridge between art
and business'; you need to have the stamina of a
doctor; you need to know film inside out; and,
most importantly, you have to be a good friend."
Both Wagner and Nicita also stressed the
importance of trustworthiness for agents.
"Fewer than half of the contracts in Hollywood
are ever signed . . . therefore, your [personal is a
lot more important than momentary technique.
There are no 'flash-in-the-pan' agents," said
Nicita.
In sum, both Wagner and Nicita agreed on the
best route for all would-be Pacinos, Demmes and
Ovitzes to take. "Be naive and be foolish. You
might be better off."
