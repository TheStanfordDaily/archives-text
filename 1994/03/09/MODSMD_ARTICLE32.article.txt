# 'Color Line' in the classroom?
## Conference explores issues of race, learning and the media 
### Julie Tsai Vivien Wang Staff writers 
Racial inequality and the prob
lems of black intellectuals today
were the topics of discussion at
panels convened during a confer
ence last weekend on "The Two
Reservations: Western Thought,
The Color Line and The Crisis of
the Negro Intellectual, Revisited."
Friday night's meeting of Insti
tute N.H.1., a newly formed stu
dent group, was marked by both
intellectual idealism and difficult
questions. The organization co
sponsored the conference with the
African and Afro-American Studies
Program.
"Stanford does a miraculous job
of getting you wrapped up in your
Frisbee-throwing world and not
thinking of anything important —
it's up to us to make a change,"
said Kwame Anku, a member of
Institute N.H.1., which was created
to examine issues of race in society
and the media in response to a per
ceived conservative trend.
The panelists, the eight mem
bers of Institute N.H.1., presented
personal anecdotes, commentaries
on media stereotyping and socio
logical arguments urging the
reconception of the academic
framework because of its Western
basis and the consequent racial
imbalances to an audience of close
to 70 students, professors, alumni
and community members.
"No matter [how much] multi
culturalism we have here, ... we

study disciplines formed from the
transformation of the West —
humanism, Adam Smith," said
senior Jason Ambroise. "When you
control a man's thinking, you con
trol his actions. The problems (we
have) are unsolvable within the the
oretical frames of Western think
ing."
Some members of the audience
felt the vision presented by N.H.I,
panelists was too exclusionary of
other races."I reject that dichoto
my of simply black and white,"
said George McKinney, a 1993
graduate. "I don't think the point
is to rank oppression in order to
rise in society — we must form
coalitions."
At one memorable point, a
young man who grew up in East
Palo Alto told of how he had been
informed that just that morning
two of his childhood friends had
been shot and one had likely sus
tained permanent brain damage.
"What you're doing is very good,
but when people walk out of this
room, people will be saying, 'Wow,'
and then not [take action]," he said
to Anku. "How do we connect these
discussions with the daily realities
for these people? How do we apply
it right now?"
Anku responded by saying the
theoretical frameworks must be
changed first by African-Ameri
cans gaining power in cultural
influences like the media and
music.
Two Stanford graduate stu
dents also spoke earlier Friday as
part of the three-day symposium.

Patricia Fox, from the depart
ment of Spanish and Portuguese,
elaborated on what she called "the
paranoid and schizophrenic exis
tence of the black college student"
in her speech entitled "Expert Bad
Girl in Search of a Paradigm:
Don't Roll Your Eyes at Me."
Fox said that although she is
sought out by the news media as a
"free-floating expert on the black
community" to answer questions
about black events, she also feels
"invincibly ignorant" as a black
intellectual when she attempts to
insert her thoughts on race into
other discussions.
She said that she faces "audible
sighs" and rolling eyes "even
though I know what I'm talking
about." Because of this, she feels
like an "expert bad girl."
Demetrius Eudell, a graduate
student in history, carried out a
chapter-by-chapter critical analysis
of "Race Matters," a book by Cor
nel West, in his speech "Race, a
Crisis of Discourse."
Eudell said he disagreed with the
political thrust of West's book. He
also contested West's view of affir
mative action. West believes affir
mative action is better than noth
ing, Eudell said, and that racial
tension will return with a
vengeance if it is abolished.
"Where did [racial tensionl go,
anyway?" asked Eudell. He ques
tioned why affirmative action is
necessary "when we don't need it
in music, because no one can com
pete with Aretha Franklin, and
sports."
