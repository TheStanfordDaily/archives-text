## Cardinal second-half flurry buries Ducks Substitutes supply much-needed burst 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
In a game characterized by play
ers in foul trouble, some of the real
heroes for the Stanford men's bas
ketball team were those coming off
the bench.
Although the Cardinal defeated
the Oregon Ducks 84-76, the
team's reserves provided a much
needed spark late in the first peri
od, just as Oregon was gaining
momentum. With the Ducks build
ing on their lead and three of Stan
ford's starters each carrying two
fouls, Cardinal coach Mike Mont
gomery had no choice but to look to
his subs to pick up some of the
slack.
"We had problems with fouls,"
he said. "I didn't want to risk any
one of our starters getting three
fouls (in the first half) "
Out went point guard Brevin
Knight, forward Andy Poppink
and center Jim Morgan. In came
David Harbour, Todd Manley and
Bart Lammersen to replace them.
The back-ups responded by
improving Stanford's play and
inspiring the players around them.
"A lot of people stepped up,"
said forward Brent Williams. "We
were able to rotate people in and
not lose our composure."
Harbour started off an 18-6
Cardinal scoring run by nailing a
three-pointer at the seven-minute
mark which cut the deficit to six.
He also assumed the crucial role of
handling the ball for the team.
"When I go in, I give it 110 per
cent," he said. "My main job was to
ran the team."
Stanford big men Lammersen
and Manley added their own con
tributions a few minutes later.
Lammersen pulled down two
rebounds and hit a free throw to
pull the Cardinal within one. Then,
with one minute remaining in the
half, Manley converted a fast-break
lay-up off a Lammersen steal, giv
ing Stanford its first lead since
early on in the contest.
Manley went on to hit two free
throws with five seconds left to
extend the Cardinal advantage to
three points at the break.
"Bart and Todd did a nice job of
helping us," Montgomery said.
"We actually gained ground with
those guys in the game."
All in all, the Stanford bench
accounted for 12 of the team's final
18 points of the period and helped
turn a nine-point deficit into a
modest lead. The rest of the
squad followed suit in the second
half by propelling the Cardinal to
victory.
The inspired play of the Stan

ford reserves in the first half
demonstrated that unlike some
college basketball teams which
lack depth, the Cardinal has noth
ing to worry about when its
starters pick up too many fouls.
"When we've gotten into trou
ble they get us going," Knight
said. "They're the force behind
the team."
