# Seniors play last game in Maples
## 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
With visions of an NCAA berth
in its head, an inspired Stanford
men's basketball team stormed to a
physical 84-76 win over Oregon at
Maples Pavilion Saturday night.
"I thought Oregon was playing
as well as any team in the league,"
Cardinal coach Mike Montgomery
said. "I'm really, really pleased
with this win."
The Ducks (9-16 overall, 5-11 in
the Pacific 10 Conference) entered
the game winners of three of their
last five, their two losses being a
pair of narrow defeats at the hands
of nationally-ranked Arizona and
California.
Oregon centered its game-plan
on a seemingly-endless supply of
nameless, bruising big men — six
forwards and centers, none of
whom was averaging more than 11
points per game, saw significant
playing time for the Ducks.
The physical play of the Oregon
frontcourt was effective in the
early-going, turning an early 6-0
Cardinal lead into a 22-13 Duck
advantage midway through the
first half.
"They're the most physical team
in the league," Montgomery said.
"That aspect of the game caused us
some problems early."
"The game was a little more
physical than we had expected,"
Stanford forward Brent Williams
said. "We'll play as physical as they
want to play as long as we get the
calls."
Both teams got the calls in this
game, as they combined to tie a
Pac-10 record with 54 total fouls.
It was the Cardinal (16-9, 9-7),
however, that was able to capitalize
on its key free-throw opportunities.
With Stanford down 28-24 late in
the first half, Cardinal reserves
David Harbour, Bart Lammersen
and Todd Manley hit five of six foul
shots down the stretch, helping the
Cardinal to a 31-28 halftime lead.
In the second half, Oregon
fought back from an eight-point
deficit, taking a 49-47 lead when
freshman point guard Kenya
Wilkins put in a 10-footer off the
glass with 12 minutes to play.
The Cardinal, however, followed
with a 12-0 run of its own, led by a
Brevin Knight three-pointer and a
pair from Dion Cross.
Foul shooting crushed any
hopes for a second-half Duck come
back. Oregon shot a woeful 6-for
-17 from the line in the second peri
od, missing five in a row at one
point.
With two minutes, 58 seconds

remaining and the Cardinal up 72-
66, Orlando Williams, the Ducks'
leading scorer and an 80-percent
free throw shooter, sealed Ore
gon's fate by hitting only one of
three free throws after he was
fouled when attempting a three
pointer.
Stanford pulled away from that
point, taking an insurmountable
81-66 lead on a Jim Morgan lay-in
at the 1:14 mark.
The fouls eventually caught up
to the Ducks in the game's final two
minutes — four Oregon big men
fouled out in the final two minutes.
Williams, playing the last home
game of his Cardinal career, led all
scorers with 24 points, including 11
in the last eight minutes of the sec
ond half.
"This was a very good basketball
team that we faced tonight," Ore
gon coach Jerry Green said after
the game. "I hope they make the
NCAA Tournament."
So does the Stanford team. The
Cardinal closes out its schedule on
the road, facing Washington
tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. and Wash
ington State Saturday at 3 p.m. in a
pair of games that are vital to the
team's postseason chances.
"Everyone's pumped up and
ready to go," Morgan said. "We'll
be the ones to blame if we don't win
the next two."
The Cardinal now stands in sole
possession of fourth place in the
Pac-10, a position it can hold with a
pair of wins in Washington.
Is fourth place good enough for
an NCAA berth?
"We're thinking about it,"
Knight said. "But we need these
next two games first."
