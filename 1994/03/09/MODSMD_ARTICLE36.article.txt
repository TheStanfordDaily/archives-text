# Women's hoops outlasts Oregon 72-60
## Cardinal now only one game behind USC in Pac-10 race 
### Andy Eiser Senior staff writer 
No real big spring break plans for the
Cardinal women's basketball team.
After running its winning streak to
nine games with a 72-60 victory over the
Oregon Ducks last Saturday in Eugene,
Ore., Stanford hopes to spend three quiet
weeks at home and then take a weekend
trip to Virginia at the start of next quar
ter. That's Richmond, Va., home of the
1994 Women's Final Four.
"That would be an incredible accom
plishment," said Cardinal head coach
Tara VanDerveer of a possible fourth
Final Four appearance in five years.
Before Final Four dreams come true,
however, Stanford must wrap up its regu
lar season.

In what could have been its final game
away from Maples Pavilion this season,
the No. 11-ranked Cardinal (20-5, 13-3 in
the Pacific 10 Conference) Overcame a
sluggish start to clinch its seventh consec
utive 20-win season and sole possession of
second place.
Tied with Stanford at just one game
behind first-place USC heading into the
contest, Oregon (18-7, 12-4) found itself
ahead 50-46 in a seesaw battle with 10
minutes remaining in the game. But the
Cardinal reeled ofTan impressive 20-5 run
to seize control at 66-55 with three min
utes, 41 seconds left.
"We came out a little tired, but we hit
our outside shots and free throws down
the stretch," VanDerveer said.
Sophomore forward Bobbie Kelsey and
junior guard Kate Paye did most of the

hitting, accounting for 18 of Stanford's 20
points during the crucial run. Kelsey
scored 10 of her 15 on the night while
Paye added eight of her 14.
On the inside, junior center Anita
Kaplan, the reigning Pac-10 and Sports
Illustrated Player of the Week, turned in
another outstanding effort. Playing with
four fouls for the final 19 minutes, Kaplan
still managed to lead the Cardinal with 16
points and tie a career-high 14 rebounds.
Before their postseason odyssey
begins, the Cardinal women must first
play their last two Pac-10 regular season
games. Thursday night at 7:30 p.m., the
Washington State Cougars (7-18, 2-14)
come to Maples. On Saturday at 1 p.m.,
senior guards Christy Hedgpeth and
