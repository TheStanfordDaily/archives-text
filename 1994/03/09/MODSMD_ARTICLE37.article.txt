# Thirteen in a row
## Swimmers demolish Pac-10

The message has been sent.
In winning their 13th consecutive
Pacific 10 Conference title, the Stanford
men swimmers sent a message to the rest
of the nation's top swim programs — they
are ready to defend their title at the
NCAA Championships March 24-26 in
Minneapolis.
While the Cardinal had little to prove
to the rest of the Pac-10 teams competing
in Long Beach, Calif. — the team
outscored second place UCLA 962-605 —
it was evident that the team's depth will
be difficult for the rest of the country to

overcome at the NCAAs.
En route to the team victory, Stanford
swimmers won 10 of 13 individual events
and all five of the relays. Senior Derek
Weatherford and sophomore Joe Hude
pohl grabbed three individual titles each,
while junior Ray Carey picked up two.
Weatherford, winner of the 100- and
200-yard backstrokes and the 200 yard
individual medley was happy with his
races, even though he did not fulfill his
pre-meet expectations.
"I didn't swim as fast as I wanted to,"
Weatherford said. "But I convinced
myself that we have three more weeks of
rest (before the NCAAs). My goals
here were very lofty, and I will cany
those goals on to NCAAs."
Although he broke the Pac-10
Championship meet record in the
200 back with a time of one minute,
42.80 seconds, Weatherford called
the 200 IM his best race.
"That was my best time (1:45.81)
by about a half second," he said. "I
hadn't swum that fast in three
years."
As the Cardinal racked up the
points and top finishes, the final
team results surprised no one. Still,

Stanford did enjoy exciting
moments and breakthrough races.
Cardinal assistant coach Ted
Knapp mentioned two freshmen,
Matt Thompson and Kevin Rad
vany, whose efforts turned more
than a few heads. Thompson fin
ished second in the 400 IM, while
Radvany won his first conference
title in the 1,650 free.
"These two freshmen had sur
prise swims," Knapp said. "They
showed that they are ready to move
up to the next level, the national
level."
Knapp also pointed out the per
formances of Hudepohl, winner of
the 50, 100 and 200 freestyles,
sophomore Scott Gagner and Carey.
"For someone to win the 50, 100

and 200 at the conference level is
rare, especially unshaved," Knapp
said.
Gagner, who competed in the
100 (sixth place), 200 (second) and
500 (fifth) frees, enjoyed sizable
time drops and sets his sights on
further improvements.
"In the 200,1 had a drop of about
one and a half seconds from last
year," Gagner said. "I was really
excited to get into the 1:35 range."
Carey, the defending NCAA
champion in the 200 butterfly, was
looking to regain his Pac-10 title in
the event he won two years ago.
Before swimming his specialty
event, however, Carey surprised
even himself in turning in a time of
3:48.90 on his way to winning the

400 IM.
"The 400 IM is still sort of a new
event for me," Carey said. "I'm still
figuring out how to swim it. After
the 200 IM (on the first day of com
petition) I didn't know how I was
swimming. The 400 really pumped
me up for the fly."
Other Cardinal highlights
included senior Tyler Mayfield win
ning his fourth title in the 100
breaststroke and Stanford placing
five of the six finalists in the 200 IM
and 200 free. The team's winning
400 medley relay (Weatherford,
senior Trip Zedlitz, Mayfield and
Hudepohl) and the 800 free relay
(Gagner, junior Dan Kanner,
Weatherford and Hudepohl)
eclipsed meet records.
