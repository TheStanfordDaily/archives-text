The dramatic story of the 1989-90 Stanford
women's basketball team and their shift from an
underdeveloped team to NCAA Champions has been
captured in a documentary which will be previewed at
Stanford this Friday before its debut on public televi
sion.
The 60-minute documentary, entitled "In the
Game," gives a behind-the-scenes look at the women's
basketball team, following them on road trips and
filming them during their most intense moments in
the locker room.
The film also focuses on the legacy of Title IX, a
1972 statute that requires any school receiving feder
al money to give equitable support to women and men
in sports. The movie illustrates that, two decades after
this legislation, funding for women's sports is still dis
tinctly lower.
"I tried to tell the dramatic personal story as well as
bring in the very big Issues," producer Becky Smith
said.
At the end of the story, Smith — who graduated
from Stanford in 1984 and is currently an indepen
dent filmmaker — interviews the main characters
and updates their lives. Two of the five players are
pursuing professional basketball careers, and will try
out for the 1996 Olympic team. Tara VanDerveer,

who still coaches the women's team, is being consid
ered for the Olympic coaching job.
Smith's idea for the documentary developed after
she went to her first women's basketball game.
"I was astounded," she said. "I had no idea college
women were able to play at the style and level they did.
It was so far advanced for what I thought women
could do that I thought a documentary should be
made."
With continuing enthusiasm for her idea, Smith
started exploring. She knew she wanted to focus on
player Jennifer Azzi and on VanDerveer, who had
rebuilt the team to a successful, national winner.
"[VanDerveer] took the team from nowhere to the
top of women's basketball," Smith said. "It was amaz
ing and awe-inspiring how brilliant she was at coach

The hardest part of the documentary's three-year
production was finding funding, Smith said. She
added that she found this difficulty ironic, since the
documentary focuses on the need for more attention
to the importance of women athletes and the funding
women's sports receives.
Eventually, Apple Computer donated money for an
editing system and then PBS' Frontline, a weekly cur

between this season's regionals
and the NCAA Final Four tourna
ment.
"This show is unusual for
[Frontline] because it's a personal
profile of five young women and

their coach," Smith said. "For
them to air this program national
ly is unusual and a wonderful move
which shows that this issue is
important."
The documentary will also be
previewed for an open audience in
Kresge Auditorium this Friday.
Smith said she feels the docu

people think about women's
sports. "It's absolutely inspiring

and eye-opening to me to see what
a group of people can accomplish if
they share a common goal and
work very hard to achieve it,"
Smith said. "I was amazed at how
mature and goal-oriented [the
players] were at their age."
After the airing of "In the
Game" on national television,
Smith and her co-workers are
planning to look into the home
video and educational market.
