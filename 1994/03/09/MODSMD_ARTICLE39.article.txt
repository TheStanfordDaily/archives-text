# Tennis wins
## Flanagan, Cocotos capture title 
### Mike Langford Senior staff writer 
A perfect ending to a perfect winter.
The top-ranked Stanford men's tennis team lived
up its National Indoor championship title by winning
the 105 th annual Pacific Coast Doubles title last
weekend in La Jolla, Calif. The team of senior Ail-
Americans Michael Flanagan and Chris Cocotos won
the three-day tournament by beating USC's team of
Wayne Black and Jonathan Leach.
Stanford's second team of senior All-American
Vimal Patel and sophomore Jeff Salzenstein also
made an outstanding showing at the tournament, los
ing to Black-Leach in the semifinals.
"It was a good effort for us," said head coach Dick
Gould. "It was a chance for us to concentrate just on
doubles, which we needed. While we had been doing
good in doubles, we hadn't been super-stellar."
While Stanford's singles lineup had been proven
the best at Indoors, there may have been some ques
tions following a 6-6 record in doubles at Indoors as to
the strength of the doubles lineup.
But many of those questions were put to rest when
Stanford came close to making it an all-Cardinal final
in La Jolla.
Patel-Salzenstein, seeded fourth in the tourna
ment, moved quickly through the bracket during the
first two days of competition, making it to the semis
without so much as dropping a set. But the match
against Black-Leach, the tournament's top-seeded
team, was not as easy, as the Trojan pair triumphed 6-
4, 6-1.
"The first set was very close," Gould said. "But
Vimal and Jeff couldn't capitalize on opportunities.
Then USC just got on a roll and closed it out."
The second-seeded team, Flanagan-Cocotos, went
through the draw with similar ease, dropping nary a
set until the finals. In the semis, the Cardinal duo dis
patched USC's Lukas Hovorka and Adam Peterson,
the tournament's third seed, by a score of 6-3, 6-3.
And so the finals were set, the top two seeds repre
senting two of the top collegiate teams in the nation.
"[Flanagan-Cocotos] did a great job in the finals,"
Gould said. "The match really could have gone either
way."
Cocotos-Flanagan dropped the first set, but came
back in what is quickly becoming typical Stanford
fashion. The Cardinal team won the next two sets,
and took the match and title by a score of 3-6, 6-2, 7-
5.
Stanford's Bobby Devens and Grant Elliott also
competed in the tournament, but lost in the second
round to USC's Brett Hansen and Chad Rosser, the
tournament's sixth seed. Senior Billy Wright and
sophomore Ricky Becker lost in the second round as
well to the tournament's top-seeded independent
team, a pair of local players.
After a two-week break, Stanford will resume prac
tice on March 19. The Cardinal will then have a fairly
busy spring break, facing Brigham Young at Stanford
Tennis Stadium on the March 23. The team will then
travel south to face Arizona March 25 and Arizona
State the March 26.
A perfect ending to a perfect winter.
