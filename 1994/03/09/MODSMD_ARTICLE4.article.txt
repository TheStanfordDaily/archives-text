# Sexism and harassment still a concern, some say
## 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Neurosurgery Prof. Frances Conley reported
some disturbing incidents of sexual harassment and
discrimination duringa speech to the annual meeting
of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science last month.
Conley spoke of a Stanford School of Medicine de
partment chair who gave a female faculty member a
bonus only one-quarter the size given to all other de
partment members — including her husband who
works in the same department.
The chair, according to Conley, said he gave the

smaller bonus because one can't "expect the same
family to get two full bonuses."
In the Medicine Department last year, Conley
said, chair Edward Harris held a retreat "to discuss
strategic plans for the future" and invited none of the
women in his department.
Surgery Chair John Niederhuber last year "paid
for all his tenure-track male assistant professors to
attend a national scientific research meeting and did
not think to invite any of his female tenure-track sur
geons," Conley told the meeting.
Conley also said that a woman who came to her for
advice on how to stop the "intolerable physical sexu
al harassment" she was experiencing at Stanford was

later "told by a member of the administration to have
no contact with you (Conley)."
Harris could not be reached for comment and
Niederhuber did not return repeated phone calls.
However, in a statement given last week to Cam
pus Report, Niederhuber said that "it is true that
several male tenure-line professors attended a scien
tific meeting at the expense of the Department of
Surgery.
But what was not noted was that the female
tenure-track assistant professor also has been pro
vided funds to attend other professional meetings di
rectly related to her work."
Harris told Campus Report
that he believes the meeting Con
ley referred to is a retreat he held
Oct. 20, 1992 with the depart
ment's division chiefs, all of
whom are men.
These examples, Conley said,
are "glaring, awful incidents," but
she hears about many more.
Other faculty say they, too, get
calls for advice on harassment,
yet very few cases are handled
through official University chan
nels.
Hoping to end the apparent
fear of official channels, the Uni
versity's new sexual harassment
policy, elements of which are still
being implemented, outlines ways
to make informal complaints. The
question some professors now
ponder is whether these proce
dures will work or simply drive
the issue out of sight and out of
mind.
'Majority may be afraid'
Conley has been identified
with gender issues ever since she
resigned her post in 1991, claim

ing that the man who had been
named chair of the Department of
Neurosurgery, Gerald Silverberg,
had harassed her in the past.
Since that time, Conley (who
returned to the faculty soon after
Silverberg was removed as chair)
said she has received approxi
mately one phone call per week
from people with questions or
complaints about sexual harass
ment. Most of the cases she hears
about are from the Medical Cen
ter, and most could go through
the University's official channels
to deal with sexual harassment.
Conley is not alone. Political
Science Prof. Terry Karl, who is
also recognized as a sexual
harassment expert and was
involved in a harassment case at
Harvard University, said she sees
"a regular flow of people through
my office complaining of sexual
discrimination in some way," as
well as "a more limited number of
cases that are reports of harass
ment."
However, despite the high
number of questions about gen
der issues in general and harass
ment specifically, University
Ombudsperson Leah Kaplan said
only about two official complaints
of sexual harassment are filed per

year. She said her office received
25 calls about sexual harassment
last year, including complaints,
questions and people doing aca
demic research.
Why do so few cases then go
through official University chan
nels? Several faculty members
cited similar reasons: the fear of
having to confront your harasser
and the fear of having to publicly
identify yourself.
"I would say the majority are
afraid to get into any kind of offi
cial grievances," Karl said.
Education Prof. Myra Strober,
who was active in the creation of
the University's new sexual
harassment policy, agreed. The
student handbook, for example,
advises that when a student
wants to formally pursue sexual
harassment charges "the first
thing the person has to do is con
front the person with whom they
have a grievance," and then go to
a dean or department chair,
Strober said. But, she said, people
may not want to confront their
harassers and "department chairs
and deans may not be neutral
enough to handle mediation."
Improved reporting
In an attempt to solve the

dilemma of how to report sexual
harassment without confronting
the harasser or a supervisor, the
new policy sets up a network of
informal channels that can be
used to report harassment, said
Psychiatry Prof. Laraine Zappert,
Stanford's new sexual harass
ment coordinating adviser.
In January, a group of seven
"panelists" was created who will
help people adjudicate charges of
sexual harassment against
administrators and faculty. Also,
18 "advisers" — including
Strober — have been trained to
give advice on informal and for
mal harassment procedures to
either those accused of harass
ment or their accusers.
"The advantage of the group is
because it's spread across campus
and across disciplines, I don't
have to go to someone in my own
department," Zappert said.
Informal procedures would not
require that a complainant make
their name or the name of their
harasser public, but some action
still could be taken on the com
plaint, Zappert said. For example,
she said, an advisers might talk to
the person accused of harassment
about their behavior in a general
sense.

At other universities, informal
complaints have worked well,
Zappert said, and are used in up
to 90 percent of harassment
cases. Zappert said Stanford's
sexual harassment policy is too
new for her to judge whether its
informal procedures will be popu
lar.
Although such informal proce
dures may alleviate some fears of
going to University officials with
questions about harassment, it
opens up the possibility of anoth
er problem: That no one will hear
about sexual harassment cases.
Concerns persist
While Conley said "there is
now much more open dialogue
about what's acceptable behavior
and what isn't," she said she fears
that the University has "worked
extremely expeditiously to quash
any instances that come to its
attention, and is driving the issue
(of sexual harassment) back
underground."
In the Silverberg case, for
example, a report was prepared
about the harassment charges
but never released. "We, as a com
munity, have heard nothing. We
do not know what is acceptable
behavior," she said.

The University needs to find a
way to keep harassment in the
public eye while protecting peo
ple's privacy as much as possible,
Conley said.
Karl said she would like to
see reports on harassment cases
listing actions that have been
found inappropriate, what sanc
tions were taken against the
harasser and what was done to
help the harassed, without
reporting the identities of the
parties involved.
"It's very clear that the more
harassment is discussed and the
more it is clarified to everyone . . .
the better off we're all going to
be," Karl said.
Zappert agreed that having
public information on harass
ment is important and said one of
the main tasks of her office in the
coming years is to "centralize
information and statistics" about
harassment on campus.
Zappert said she did not know
whether the new system will be
able to balance maintaining per
sonal privacy and publicizing
information about harassment,
but said that the policy will be
reviewed in two years to look at
this and other issues about its
effectiveness.
