# Sexism and harassment still a concern, some say
## 
### Andy Dworkin Senior staff writer 
Neurosurgery Prof. Frances Conley reported
some disturbing incidents of sexual harassment and
discrimination duringa speech to the annual meeting
of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science last month.
Conley spoke of a Stanford School of Medicine de
partment chair who gave a female faculty member a
bonus only one-quarter the size given to all other de
partment members â€” including her husband who
works in the same department.
The chair, according to Conley, said he gave the

smaller bonus because one can't "expect the same
family to get two full bonuses."
In the Medicine Department last year, Conley
said, chair Edward Harris held a retreat "to discuss
strategic plans for the future" and invited none of the
women in his department.
Surgery Chair John Niederhuber last year "paid
for all his tenure-track male assistant professors to
attend a national scientific research meeting and did
not think to invite any of his female tenure-track sur
geons," Conley told the meeting.
Conley also said that a woman who came to her for
advice on how to stop the "intolerable physical sexu
al harassment" she was experiencing at Stanford was

later "told by a member of the administration to have
no contact with you (Conley)."
Harris could not be reached for comment and
Niederhuber did not return repeated phone calls.
However, in a statement given last week to Cam
pus Report, Niederhuber said that "it is true that
several male tenure-line professors attended a scien
tific meeting at the expense of the Department of
Surgery.
But what was not noted was that the female
tenure-track assistant professor also has been pro
vided funds to attend other professional meetings di
rectly related to her work."
