# Men rally to beat Nebraska
## No. 2 gymnasts defeat top rivals in close meet 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
It wasn't until the final rotation that
Stanford men's gymnastics coach Sadao
Hamada lit his victory cigar.
The two-time defending national cham
pion Cardinal was well aware that No. 16
California, Western Michigan, San Jose
State and, in particular, No. 6 Nebraska
would make last Saturday's home dual
meet the greatest obstacle Stanford has
had to overcome all year.
However, the No. 2-ranked Cardinal did
not expect the two-time NCAA runner-up
Cornhuskers to surge within .8 points of
blemishing its unbeaten record. In fact,
Nebraska fell to Stanford by a mere mar
gin of 284.40 to 285.125 despite amassing
a two-point lead on the Cardinal after four
rotations.
"It was a great comeback to beat
Nebraska," Hamada said. "Our last two
events were parallel bars and high bar — I
knew we were going to be strong in those
events. I was confident that we could win,
but when I saw they had a two point lead, I
knew it was going to be close."
Finding his team trailing 190.5 to 188.7
after the fourth rotation, Hamada
informed his gymnasts of their uphill bat
tle. He gave them only one piece of advice
— hit their routines or lose.
They took this advice to heart and hit
their final routines. In fact, the Cardinal
posted a 48.125 and 48.3 in parallel bars
and high bar respectively, its highest
marks on the events this season.
"It was a matter of us setting our goal
and achieving it," said senior tri-captain
Mark Booth. "It was an emotional roller
coaster. We were up, then we found our
selves behind, and we came back and won.

I couldn't have asked for anything more
for my last home meet."
Indeed, Booth spearheaded the Cardinal
rally. On parallel bars, Booth set the tone
with a 9.875. Then, on the high bar, he
closed the final home meet of his career
with a flourish, scoring a 9.95. It was after
Booth's high bar routine that Hamada
knew his team had prevailed — the coach
smoked his victop' cigar by telling fresh
man Jamie Ellis to attempt difficult
maneuvers rather than worry about hit
ting the closing routine.
The Cardinal's other tri-captains also
displayed their skill and leadership during
Stanford's comeback. Junior Josh Stein
earned a 9.85 on parallel bars, while senior
Chris Sey posted a 9.70 on the high bar.
Not to be out-done by his fellow veter
ans, junior Jing-Wei Liang came through
for a 9.85 on the high bar. With a 57.1-
point tally, he was also the second highest
all-around scorer in the competition next
to the Cornhusker's Richard Grace.
"I was very impressed by the way the
team came together in the last two
events," Sey said. "It's a new team after
all, so it's good to know that at this point in
the season, the team can come together
and get the job done. It was a great experi
ence to have my last home meet finish the
way it did for the team and for myself."
Hamada echoed Sey's thoughts.
"This meet demonstrated our leader
ship, confidence, and concentration level,"
the coach said. "It's incredible that the
kids can come up with season-highs under
that kind of pressure.
"We have to keep up this intensity.
We'll have even more pressure-packed sit
uations later in the season with champi-

onship competitions. We have to
perform under pressure."
During dead week and finals
week, the Cardinal will practice to
improve its consistency level, as it
missed several routines last week
end. It will also hold extra practices

to make progress in rings, a partic
ularly problematic event for Stan
ford all season long.
If all proceeds well, Hamada said
he thinks the team will be capable of
posting scores as high as 290 by the
time the NCAA Championship rolls
around in late April. As Lincoln,
Neb., will be the site of NCAAs, this
weekend served as a crucial indica
tor of where national powers Stan
ford and Nebraska stand in their

quests for the national crown.
"No doubt Nebraska will be the
team to beat (at the NCAA Cham
pionships)," Hamada said. "I
respect the Nebraska program.
They came all the way to Califor
nia, and they leave knowing they
only had a close loss to us at [Stan
ford]. This gave them a little confi
dence, but we gave Nebraska a

all-around scorer in the competition next
to the Cornhusker's Richard Grace.
"I was very impressed by the way the
team came together in the last two
events," Sey said. "It's a new team after
all, so it's good to know that at this point in
