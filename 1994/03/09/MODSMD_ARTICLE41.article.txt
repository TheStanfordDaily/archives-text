# Pitching propels Cardinal to two wins over UCLA
## 
### Swaminatha Gurudevan Staff writer 
As it has done several times earlier this season, the
Stanford pitching staff proved it is ready to take on the
rest of the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division.
The Cardinal entered Jackie Robinson Stadium in
Westwood last weekend riding the crest of solid per
formances by its pitching staff. After taking two of
three from UCLA, it pulled within one-half game of
Six-Pac-leading USC.
The No. 11 Cardinal won its second straight con
ference series behind strong pitching and saw its over
all record improve to 14-9 (4-2 in the Six-Pac), while
the Bruins fell to 5-12 (1-2).
Friday's game was a pitchers' duel which Stanford
southpaw Dan Reed (3-2) dominated, throwing the

Cardinal's first complete game of the season. Reed, a
sophomore, allowed only six hits while walking two
and striking out eight, sending UCLA to its sixth con
secutive defeat 3-0.
Offensively, Stanford scored single runs in the
third, sixth, and seventh innings, making a hard-luck
loser out of UCLA pitcher Brian Stephenson (1-1),
who also went the distance and allowed only three
runs on seven hits.
On Saturday, UCLA bounced back from six games
of frustration with an offensive explosion, scoring 11
runs on 11 hits and chasing Canlinal righthander
Jason Middlebrook after only 11/3 innings en route to
an 11-4 victory. The Bruins were aided by 12 walks
issued by five Stanford pitchers, including seven by
righthander Matt Marenghi (0-2).
"We were kind of disappointed about how we

played on Saturday," said junior second baseman Jed
Hansen. "Even though our pitchers gave up a lot of
walks, we still should have scored more runs and pro
duced offensively."
The Bruins were led by shortstop Gar Vallone, who
went 2-for-4 with three RBIs, and first baseman Mike
Mitchell, who collected three hits in four at-bats with
three RBIs.
Stanford refused to back down, however, and came
right back on Sunday, pounding out a season-high 19
hits in a 14-3 drubbing of UCLA. The Cardinal
jumped on the scoreboard early, scoring three runs in
the top of the first inning off of Bruin starter Rick
Heineman (0-4).
However, sophomore lefthander Mike Robbins was
shaky in the first inning, giving up
three runs in the bottom of the
first and letting the Bruins into the
game. But Robbins (3-1) settled
down and pitched a complete
game, allowing nine hits total and
no additional runs, while walking
two and striking out five.
"I was happy things went the
way they did and I was able to finish
the game," Robbins said. "As a
starter, your goal is to stay out there
and contribute as long as you can
and complete the game if possible.
But you need a lot of things to do

that, like a good defense and some
run scoring, which we got today."
Robbins attributed his and
Reed's success to the fact that
many of the UCI.A hitters were
left-handed batters or switch-hit
ters that favored their left side.
"On Saturday, they were able to
have eight or nine of their batters
hitting left-handed," Robbins said.
"Dan fßeedl and I were able to
switch those guys to the other
side."
Senior designated hitter Nate
Olmstead led the Stanford hit
parade, going 4-for-5 with a dou
ble, a run scored, and five RBIs.
Stanford will reopen Six-Pac
competition March 19 with a three
game home series against USC.
