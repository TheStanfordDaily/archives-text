# Track to host Stanford Fest
## 
### Jorge Chen 
Just in time for spring, the Stanford track
team prepares to enter the bulk of its schedule
firing on all cylinders.
Last weekend, part of the Stanford track team
made a stop at the Bears' lair in an all-comers
meet held at California Memorial Stadium as a
warmup for events over the next two weeks.
Rene Rodriguez and Louise Watson will rep
resent the Cardinal in the NCAA Indoor Track &
Field Championships held March 11-12 at Indi
anapolis, Ind., before the team assembles at the
Stanford Festival March 25-26.
At Berkeley, junior decathlete Travis Clark
got off to a good start bv running a debut of 15.5
seconds in the 110 meter high hurdles in prepa
ration for his first decathalon later this spring.
"I was really surprised with my time," Clark
said. "This race is a good foundation for my
upcoming outdoor season. However, there is def
initely a lot of room for improvement."
In preparation for Indoors, Rodriguez, a
sophomore, picked up where he left off last sea
son by running a school record 47.06 in the 400
meters earlier this season at the Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation Invitational in Reno, Nev.
Rodriguez is currently recovering from a pulled
hamstring which occurred in the middle of his
record-breaking run.
"This hindrance is more psychological than
physical," Rodriguez said. "I've been touching up
my performance as well as resting all this week."
Head coach Vin Lananna sees this race as a
great opportunity for Rodriguez to get his feet
wet for the first time in a competition on the
national level. "He will be able to carry his skills
and performances over to a promising outdoor
season," said Lananna.
Watson, a senior, carries similar expectations
into the championships.
"I am really excited to compete this weekend,"
Watson said. "The long waiting is finally over
since the provisional status has been dropped
and I am officially competing in the 5,000
meters."
Watson is ranked ninth among the field of 16
with an entering time of 16:26.95 seconds.
Lananna said he has confidence in Watson's abil
ity to perform.
"Louise is a veteran in national competitions
such as these. Hopefully she will gain one of the
eight Ail-American titles she has been working
assiduously for all season long."
The Stanford Festival, one of the largest colle
giate outdoor track meets in the nation, will be
held on March 25-26 at Stanford Stadium.
