Army ulways makes the Army-Navy game. Cal has
never missed Big Game. And Stanford always reaches
the finals of the Women's National Indoor Tennis
Championship.
Until last weekend.
Suffering its first loss of the season, the top-seeded
Cardinal dropped a 5-4 barnburner to the third-seeded
Florida Gators (8-1) on Saturday in the Indoors' semi
finals, thereby failing to make the finals in the eight
year history of the Madison, Wis. tournament. The fol
lowing day the Gators were dismissed by the second
seeded Georgia Bulldogs 5-1.
Saturday's match, which pitted the second-ranked
team in the country (Stanford) against No. 5, defined
the phrase "a see-saw battle." Taking the courts first,
the Cardinal's top netter Laxmi Poruri and No. 3 sin
gles player Katie Schlukebir disposed of their Gator
opponents speedily, giving Stanford an early 2-0 lead.
"She's a backcourt player who uses a lot of spin,"
Poruri said of her opponent, No. 16 Anouschka Popp.
"In indoors [where the courts are much faster] that's

not really the best strategy."
But at No. 2 singles, Cardinal senior All-American
Kristine Kurth was struggling against 36th ranked
Divya Merchant. Merchant won the first set 7-5 with a
strategy that is one of the best on indoor courts â€” hit
ting hard.
While Merchant and Kurth were fighting out the
second set, Stanford's No. 4 and 5 singles players Beth
Berris and Emma Woodhouse were getting drummed
on the other two courts. Kurth lost her second set in a
tiebreaker while her two teammates fell in straight
sets. In the space of three matches, a 2-0 Stanford lead
became a 3-2 Florida advantage.
But the pendulum swung back west as Cardinal
freshman Sandra De Silva continued her rock-solid
play with a 6-1, 6-1 win over Erika Kutter at No. 6 sin
gles. De Silva remains undefeated in dual-match play.
Another Stanford stalwart has been the top doubles
team of Schlukebir and Poruri, and this pair continued
their undefeated season with a 6-2, 7-6 victory over
Popp and Merchant. With two doubles matches left to
play, the Cardinal clung to a 4-3 edge.
Indicators seemed to point Stanford's way as the
No. 3 doubles team won the first set over Pugliese and

Lori Ann Freed man 7-5. But the next set was a disas
ter as the duo of Emily Burt and Kim Shasby were
blown out 6-1.
"That was the key situation right there," said Stan
ford coach Frank Brennan. "We could just have easily
been up 3-0 as opposed to down 3-0, and that would
have put the pressure on them, because the Florida
team knew that that was the decisive match."
With that set, the pendulum swung back to Talla
hassee for good. Burt and Shasby proceeded to lose the
third set 6-4, just as the No. 2 doubles team of Kurth
and Berris dropped their first set 6-3, then fell behind
5-3 in the second. With all eyes in the complex trained
on them, the Kurth/Berris pair fought off three match
points to take a 6-5 second set lead. But it was a case of
too little, too late as the Gator duo of Kristine Osmond
and Kuttler held on to win the twelfth game, the
tiebreaker and, ultimately, the dual-match.
But, as sophomore Berris said, "I'd rather lose now
than in May [at the NCAA championships]." So with
one loss under its belt, the Cardinal will continue its
trek towards a national championship. Stanford will
host third-ranked California at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium on March 23.
