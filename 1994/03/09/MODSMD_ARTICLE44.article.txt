# Gymnasts top Hornets
## Women beat Sac. State in Pac-10 warmup 
### Vanessa Arrington Staff writer 
Usually, not having its best or
even complete lineup would nega
tively affect a team's chances at
winning. But this assumption
proved false for Stanford's
women's gymnastics team last Fri
day at Sacramento State.
The Cardinal was forced to
count every score in the meet since
only five gymnasts competed on
each event. Normally, only five out
of six scores count, but since gym
nasts were pulled out of the line
ups at the last minute there were
not six scores to choose from.
Yet Stanford easily defeated the
Hornets in spite of these unexpect
ed troubles, winning the meet with
a score of 189.475 over the Hor
nets' 183.425.
"We had to overcome adversity
— we had a lousy warmup, some
or our key performers were out
and we were on equipment that
was not so great," said head coach
Breck Greenwood. "This was, in
many ways, our most impressive
performance of the year."
The Cardinal captured every
event but floor. On the vault, Stan

ford won by less than a point, but
triumphed by a more comfortable
three-point lead on both the
uneven bars and beam.
Stanford junior Jene Elzie took
first place in the all-around compe
tition with a score of 38.775. With
no other Cardinal gymnasts in the
running, second place in the all
around went to Sacramento fresh
man Kim Shoults with a 37.120.
Elzie led the Cardinal on vault,
receiving first place with a score of
9.650. Not far behind in second
place was junior Meegan Lannin
with a 9.600. Sacramento's Rebec
ca Seebirt took third place with a
9.500.
Senior Laurie West had been
planning to compete on this event,
as well as bars, but a pulled muscle
in her back from a fall during bar
warmups put her out for the
evening.
The Cardinal gave a solid per
formance on the bars, with all five
of the gymnasts in the lineup stick
ing their routines. Sophomore
Hillary Anderson tied for first
place with Elzie, sharing a 9.700,
while third place went to Lannin
with a 9.600.
The Cardinal broke its beam
record of 47.950 with a new score
of 48.200 and the top five places
went to the five Stanford gym
nasts in this event. Anderson took
first with a 9.750 and Elzie and
junior Tina Snowden tied for sec
ond with a score of 9.650.

Despite a one, two showing by
Snowden and Elzie on the floor,
with respective scores of 9.825
and 9.750, Sacramento gymnasts
performed more consistently
overall to win this event.
The Cardinal gymnasts will
meet Brigham Young March 19 in
Utah at its last regular meet of the
season.
The following week the team
will compete at Pac-10 Champi
onships and then, most likely, at
NCAA Regionals.
