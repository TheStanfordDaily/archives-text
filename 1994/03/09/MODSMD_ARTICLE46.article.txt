# Looking for a repeat
## Swimmers are on their way to NCAAs 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
A season of domination and success
has reached its final stage for the Stan
ford women's swim squad. The next (and
final) step: a bid for a second consecutive
NCAA title.
On March 17-19 the Cardinal will do
battle in Indianapolis for the champi
onship, a goal the team has embraced all
season. This year's tournament, unlike
last season's runaway Stanford victory,
will give the Cardinal no guarantees.
"I expect a very, very competitive meet
to the very last event," coach Richard
Quick said. "If we are going to win the
championship we've got to be a scrapping,
fighting team trying to get every last
point."
Stanford, which qualified 16 swim
mers to the NCAA meet, failed last week
end to add another swimmer to its Indi
anapolis roster. The time trials meet, held
at Cal, was designed to allow the Cardinal
the chance to fill its last remaining team
slot. While failing to do this, the team did
manage to qualify two existing NCAA

team members in other events. Mary
Ellen Blanchard will compete in the 200-
yard breaststroke, while Becky Crowe
will swim in the 50 butterfly.
In preparation for the national tourna
ment, the Cardinal will keep its eye on
two major competitors. Both Florida and
Texas could give Stanford problems in its
quest for a repeat victory.
"It's not going to be easy at all," said
junior Jenny Thompson. "We're going to
go in thinking as underdogs. We'll have to
fight all the way, and one point could
make the difference."
While the Cardinal has not met Flori
da in competition this year, Stanford did
defeat Texas soundly at deGuerre earlier
this season. The team is not viewing that
victory with much importance going into
the NCAA meet.
"That we beat [Texasl doesn't really
mean anything," said junior Kendra
Thayer. "At the end of the year eveiy
thing is different."
The Cardinal has employed a set strat
egy that it hopes will lead to success at the
national tournament. "Team champi
onships are won in several stages," Quick

said. "In the preliminaries, you've got to
put people in position to do the job [in the
finals]."
In addition, Quick and his team have
the goal of swimming their best times
when the finals in each event come
around. "You always want to swim better
at night, but that's not always an easy
thing to do."
Perhaps one of the Cardinal's biggest
strategies comes in the third events. Most
Stanford swimmers will swim in two of
their top events in addition to a third event
in which they might not be as powerful.
"(This meet J is going to come down to
the third events," Thayer said. "It's going
to take every effort combined to put us on
top."
The Cardinal's Achilles heel might
flare up in the breaststroke and diving
competitions and it hopes to make up for
lost points in backstroke and relay events.
On the whole, this year's NCAA expe
rience should be a different one for most
Stanford swimmers. "In past years we
came in knowing that we were going to
win," Thompson said. "But not this year.
We're really going to have to work."
