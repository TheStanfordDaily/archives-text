Bring on the Bruins, baby!
After toppling red-hot UC-Santa Bar
bara and last year's national runner-up
Cal State-Northridge, the Stanford men's
volleyball team gained some much-needed
momentum in anticipation of its Friday
night clash against the No. 1 team in the
country.
Heading into Gaucho territory on Sun
day, the Cardinal (9-5 overall, 8-2 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) put a
damper on Santa Barbara's recent win
ning streak by handing them a swift 8-15,
16-14,16-14,14-16,15-12 kick in the rear.
Despite winning the match with a rela
tively easy fifth game, Stanford struggled
early on, dropping game one and perilous
ly falling behind 14-9 in game two. Never
theless, the Cardinal made some adjust
ments and pulled off the seven-point
comeback.
"After we inserted [freshman swing
hitter] Aaron Garcia and [Junior middle
blocker] Brian Garrett we really steadied

out and found a way to win," said head
coach Ruben Nieves.
After mounting that game two come
back, the Cardinal jumped to a quick 12-7
lead in game three, only to see it evaporate
with six consecutive points on sophomore
middle blocker Doug Hughes' serves,
including two aces. However, Hughes'
one-man effort was not enough as the Car
dinal replayed its game two comeback
with six consecutive sideouts before
pulling ahead 16-14 for the victory.
After giving game four away, Stanford
buckled down and handily dismissed
Santa Barbara in the final game.
"We pretty much took control during
the fifth game," said senior setter Canyon
Ceman. "We blocked and dug well all
night long, and that offset some of the hit
ting and serving errors we had."
Overall, the Cardinal amassed 29 team
kills against Santa Barbara's 19, with
freshman middle blocker Mike Hoefer
leading all defenders by stuffing 13 Gau
cho attacks.
The Cardinal was equally effec
tive at the net against the Mata
dors on Monday, sweeping
Northridge (8-6, 4-4) in a tight 15-
10, 15-13, 17-16 contest.
Working off an early 6-1 lead,
Stanford dominated game one
before running into some problems
in the second frame. Sparked by
the barrage of jump serves from
outside hitters Jason Hughes and
Collin Smith in the second game,
Northridge clawed back from an
early deficit to go ahead 10-4 before
the Cardinal charged to a 15-13

victory.
Game three proved to be anoth
er see-saw battle, with Stanford
coming out on top again â€” this
time via a Hoefer ace to seal the
victory at 17-16.
With two more victories under
its belt, Stanford is ready to take
on UCLA this Friday at 7 p.m. in
Burnham Pavilion. In order to give
the Bruins a tough fight, the Car
dinal will have to minimize
UCLA's tough blocking and pass
well against the jump serve.
"We'll just have to be aggressive
on offense and try to contain their
hitters, but a good blocking team
like UCLA doesn't mean they like
to be blocked themselves," said
senior captain Joe Burghardt.
