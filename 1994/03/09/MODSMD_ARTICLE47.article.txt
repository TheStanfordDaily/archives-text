Bring on the Bruins, baby!
After toppling red-hot UC-Santa Bar
bara and last year's national runner-up
Cal State-Northridge, the Stanford men's
volleyball team gained some much-needed
momentum in anticipation of its Friday
night clash against the No. 1 team in the
country.
Heading into Gaucho territory on Sun
day, the Cardinal (9-5 overall, 8-2 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) put a
damper on Santa Barbara's recent win
ning streak by handing them a swift 8-15,
16-14,16-14,14-16,15-12 kick in the rear.
Despite winning the match with a rela
tively easy fifth game, Stanford struggled
early on, dropping game one and perilous
ly falling behind 14-9 in game two. Never
theless, the Cardinal made some adjust
ments and pulled off the seven-point
comeback.
"After we inserted [freshman swing
hitter] Aaron Garcia and [Junior middle
blocker] Brian Garrett we really steadied

out and found a way to win," said head
coach Ruben Nieves.
After mounting that game two come
back, the Cardinal jumped to a quick 12-7
lead in game three, only to see it evaporate
with six consecutive points on sophomore
middle blocker Doug Hughes' serves,
including two aces. However, Hughes'
one-man effort was not enough as the Car
dinal replayed its game two comeback
with six consecutive sideouts before
pulling ahead 16-14 for the victory.
After giving game four away, Stanford
buckled down and handily dismissed
Santa Barbara in the final game.
"We pretty much took control during
the fifth game," said senior setter Canyon
Ceman. "We blocked and dug well all
night long, and that offset some of the hit
ting and serving errors we had."
Overall, the Cardinal amassed 29 team
kills against Santa Barbara's 19, with
freshman middle blocker Mike Hoefer
leading all defenders by stuffing 13 Gau
cho attacks.
