# Sailing team comes out on top of tough field

Though the winds were almost txx) light for
racing, the No. 7-ranked Stanford sailing team
was able to come away with a victory in the Stan
ford Team Race Intersectional in Itedw<xxl City
this weekend.
tor the first time, the regatta was an inter
sectional, so schools from outside California
joined the field, such as No. 2 Hawaii and the No.
5 Naval Academy. Other ranked teams included
No. 9 Long Beach State (which upset Stanford at
the Rose Bowl Intersectional in January), No. 17
California and No. 18 Washington. For the Car
dinal, however, the biggest obstacle did not
appear to be the opposing schools, but the
weather.
The schools waited until about 3 p.m. for a
steady breeze before towing the boats to the San
Francisco Bay. There the winds were sufficient

for racing, and eventually for controversy.
In a key race, Stanford's top skipper Scott
Sellers, senior, and crew Britt Johnson, senior,
were rounding a mark in the water when the
boom of a Navy boat hit Sellers' shroud. Sellers
and Johnson went on to win the race, but Navy
immediately protested, arguing that Sellers
caused the collision and should be penalized.
At the end of the regatta, Stanford, UC-Irvine
and Navy were tied for first, but Stanford won
the total points tie-breaker, so the outcome
hinged upon the protest. After a short time, the
Navy protest was denied, and Stanford was
awarded the victory.
Rounding out Stanford's "A" team, which
advanced to the championship round, were
junior skipper Charles Meade and the creVfr of
freshman Letitia Yang, senior Jeremy Mclntyre
and freshman Don Chennavasin. Meade said he
was disappointed the teams only raced against
each other once.

"It would have a been a lot better if we could
have gotten more races in," he said. "Overall, we
sailed fairly well, but there's certainly room for
improvement."
Stanford almost sent its "B" team to the
championship round as well, but it lost in a sail
off Saturday. Instead, the team won the consola
tion bracket.
"We didn't win solidly, and yes, we could
have," said coach Steve Bourdow. "But team rac
ing is difficult. We haven't spent a lot of time
team racing against competitive teams."
The win for Stanford came after a freak acci
dent Wednesday during practice when senior
Katherine Chen broke her tibia and fibula and
her hand in a non-sailing accident. Bourdow said
the team was "definitely affected by it" during
the weekend.
The sailing team will travel to Maryland
where the men will sail at the Naval Academy
and the women will be at St. Mary's.
