# Softball learns its lesson in weekend tournament

For the Stanford softball team,
winning isn't everything â€” at
least not yet.
The Cardinal remains in high
spirits despite losing all seven
games this weekend in the 1994
Troy Cox/Roadrunner Invitational
Tournament at New Mexico State.
"We were just overmatched by
the talent there," said head coach
Sandy Pearce. "These games gave
us the experience that we need for
our games in April."
The team definitely seemed to

be playing out of its league when
the tournament began last Thurs
day. The Cardinal suffered a 15-5
loss to Nebraska, followed by a 16-
0 loss to Utah, the eventual tour
nament champion.
Things did not get any easier
the following day for Stanford, as
freshman starting pitcher Angela
Webb's action was limited due to a
stress fracture in her leg. With
Webb not at full strength, fresh
men Katie Beattie and Summer
Lee had to pick up the bulk of the
pitching duties.
"Being a freshman, I have to

move back three feet on the
mound, and I'm still working
towards my own improvement in
hitting my locations all of the
time," Beattie said.
Stanford lost 9-1 to Michigan
State, 10-0 to Northeast Louisiana
and 11 -3 to New Mexico State. The
Cardinal offense benefited from
junior infielder Caryn Okinaga's
proficiency at the plate. Okinaga,
the Cardinal lead-off batter,
stroked three hits on the day and
reached base safely in five of her
nine plate appearances.
On Sunday, after dropping a

16-1 contest with Western Michi
gan, Stanford possibly gave its best
performance of the season. The
Cardinal trailed Oregon State by
just a 2-1 score after the first five
innings. Webb could not continue
her steady performance however,
as Oregon State exploded for six
runs in the sixth. Despite sopho
more Toni Morengo's three hits,
the Cardinal lost the game 8-1.
While Stanford has yet to post
its first victory, Pearce feels that
her club is playing much better
and is "starting to play great
defense."
