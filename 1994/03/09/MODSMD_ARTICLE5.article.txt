# Budget cuts to trim staff in Building 10
## Casper eliminates secretary to the trustees 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Senior staff writer 
In another high-level staff shake-up asso
ciated with the University's budget-cutting
process, University President Gerhard
Casper will eliminate the secretary to the
Board of Trustees and cut a handful of other
administrative positions in the president's
office.
Senior Assoc. Provost Lowell Price, cur
rently secretary to the University's Cabinet,
will assume the duties of current board sec
retary Marlene Wine by Sept. 1. Price will
continue to be cabinet secretary.
Casper will also cut some staff positions
in Building 10 and the News Service and will
reduce funding for the Ombudsperson's Of
fice, Memorial Church and the University
budget director's office, all of which report to
the Office of the President and the Provost.
The changes, which will likely place a
greater workload on existing administra
tors, will save the office more than $400,000
a year.
In addition to the elimination of Wine's
job, her assistant and support staff will also
be cut and their duties assumed by Price and
his secretary.
"Marlene is a highly valued, long-stand
ing and loyal contributor to Stanford,"
Casper said in a statement. "It is my great
hope that we will be able to retain her talents
in a suitable position elsewhere in the Uni
versity."

Wine, a popular veteran University ad
ministrator who served as an assistant to
former University President Donald
Kennedy, refused to comment last night.
Assistant to the President Jean Fetter,
who manages the office's budget, said this
round of budget cuts has been especially dif
ficult.
"Stanford has always prided itself on
being a very personal place, and as money be
comes more and more of an issue, you have
to make apparently hard-nosed decisions
that seem brutal and impersonal," she said.
"But you cannot cut budgets at this stage
without cutting back on staff positions... .
It's an unavoidable consequence of the exer
cise."
Some have questioned how trustee sup
port duties — which include preparation of
meeting agendas, correspondence and travel
arrangements — can be adequately handled
by a reduced staff. But Fetter said that while
an exact allocation of duties has not yet been
hammered out, she does not envision less
support for the trustees.
"I expect that the reorganization will
meet most of our demands," said board Pres
ident John Friedenrich. "I don't foresee a
change in the way [the board] operates."
Wine "has done a fine job and we value
the work she has done for the board," he
added.
Price said it makes sense to consolidate
the support functions for the two
groups primarily responsible for
University policy formation.
"I'm excited at the possibility of
bringing together some of the ser
vices for the cabinet and the
trustees," he said. "It may be easi
er to support the working relation
ship that may develop."
Some veteran University
employees feel Wine's departure,
which is the latest in a series of
high-level staff changes since
Casper took office, leaves Building
10 and upper echelons of the Uni

versity's administration with
scant institutional memory.
"I'm deeply disappointed, not
only for Marlene but for Stanford.
We have had enough losses of this
kind to make me wonder whether
we're going to find ourselves with a
bad case of institutional amnesia
afler a while," Kennedy said. "There
aren't a lot of people with long Stan
ford histories now participating in
the policy formation process."
Kennedy said Wine, who
worked for the vice provost for
research and in the provost's office
before moving to Building 10, "has
been a person of extraordinary
value to the University .... and
her loss will be felt in a way no one
will ever know."

The University's financial belt
tightening has been exacerbated in
the president's office by the cre
ation of a handful of new senior
level positions to carry out previ
ously neglected University poli
cies. In the last year, the office has
added an associate dean of
research for graduate policy, a vice
provost for faculty recruitment
and retention and a sexual harass
ment coordinating adviser.
"We have had to make difficult
choices, particularly in light of the
additional demands for adminis
tration that the University cre
ates," Casper said.
In the News Service, budget
cuts will be achieved by reducing
the copy editor position to half

time, eliminating all student and
temporary employees and scaling
back the production of the Stan
ford Observer from six to four
times a year.
In addition, the Ombudsper
son's Office will be closed for one
month each summer. Cuts to
Memorial Church and the budget
director's office have not yet been
specified.
Also in the works may be
changes in the organization of
Events and Services and in the
budget for Commencement.
The elimination of the Office of
Public Affairs, announced two
weeks ago, is also part of the Office
of the President and Provost's
budget reductions.
