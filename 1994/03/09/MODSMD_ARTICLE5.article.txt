# Budget cuts to trim staff in Building 10
## Casper eliminates secretary to the trustees 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Senior staff writer 
In another high-level staff shake-up asso
ciated with the University's budget-cutting
process, University President Gerhard
Casper will eliminate the secretary to the
Board of Trustees and cut a handful of other
administrative positions in the president's
office.
Senior Assoc. Provost Lowell Price, cur
rently secretary to the University's Cabinet,
will assume the duties of current board sec
retary Marlene Wine by Sept. 1. Price will
continue to be cabinet secretary.
Casper will also cut some staff positions
in Building 10 and the News Service and will
reduce funding for the Ombudsperson's Of
fice, Memorial Church and the University
budget director's office, all of which report to
the Office of the President and the Provost.
The changes, which will likely place a
greater workload on existing administra
tors, will save the office more than $400,000
a year.
In addition to the elimination of Wine's
job, her assistant and support staff will also
be cut and their duties assumed by Price and
his secretary.
"Marlene is a highly valued, long-stand
ing and loyal contributor to Stanford,"
Casper said in a statement. "It is my great
hope that we will be able to retain her talents
in a suitable position elsewhere in the Uni
versity."

Wine, a popular veteran University ad
ministrator who served as an assistant to
former University President Donald
Kennedy, refused to comment last night.
Assistant to the President Jean Fetter,
who manages the office's budget, said this
round of budget cuts has been especially dif
ficult.
"Stanford has always prided itself on
being a very personal place, and as money be
comes more and more of an issue, you have
to make apparently hard-nosed decisions
that seem brutal and impersonal," she said.
"But you cannot cut budgets at this stage
without cutting back on staff positions... .
It's an unavoidable consequence of the exer
cise."
Some have questioned how trustee sup
port duties — which include preparation of
meeting agendas, correspondence and travel
arrangements — can be adequately handled
by a reduced staff. But Fetter said that while
an exact allocation of duties has not yet been
hammered out, she does not envision less
support for the trustees.
"I expect that the reorganization will
meet most of our demands," said board Pres
ident John Friedenrich. "I don't foresee a
change in the way [the board] operates."
Wine "has done a fine job and we value
the work she has done for the board," he
added.
Price said it makes sense to consolidate
