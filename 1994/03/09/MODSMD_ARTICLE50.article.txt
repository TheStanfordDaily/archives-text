# Golfers clinch fifth
## Hard course and rain hinder Cardinal 
### Seth Goldstein Staff writer 
Through hell and high water,
as the saying goes.
The hell was the course itself.
The high water was the heavy
rain that stopped play for two
hours during Saturday's second
round. But somehow the Stan
ford women's golf team man
aged to complete the three day
San Jose State/Jostens Invita
tional at the Fort Ord golf course
in Monterey, Calif.
The No. 5-ranked Cardinal
came away with a fifth-place fin
ish in an extremely tough field.
Stanford finished 50 strokes
behind the leader, No. 1 Arizona
State. The Sun Devils stole the
tournament with 893 strokes,
defeating No. 2 host San Jose
State by 39 shots. No. 6 USC
and No. 7 UCLA finished third
and fourth, respectively.
The Stanford golfers faced an
incredible challenge on what
head coach Tim Baldwin called
"one of the toughest (courses) in
the nation." Fort Ord is plagued

with high winds in addition to its
tree-lined holes and doglegs.
"The course played really
tough," said senior Melinda
Daniels. "It got the best of us."
The rain on Saturday didn't
help much either, making the
normally slick greens even more
unpredictable.
"I hit every fairway except
one," said junior Amy Lawrence.
"But I had a lot of long three
putts. The greens were not fun."
Despite the rain, the Cardinal
managed the field's second best
team score for the day, leaving
the golfers in fourth. When the
weather cleared up on Sunday,
UCLA managed to slide past
Stanford, pushing it into fifth.
Despite the disappointing dis
play in the tournament, Baldwin
remained optimistic about the
team's efforts.
"We didn't adjust as well as
we might have, but it was a good
performance," Baldwin said.
The women hope to improve
on their performance in two
weeks at the Hawaii Invitational
on March 22-24.
