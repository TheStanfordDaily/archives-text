# Life After 'The A Team'
## Arnold Pan 
### 
How the mighty have fallen! As Club
ber Lang, he conquered world
champion Rocky Balboa with one
fell swoop and one powerful fist. As "Bad At
titude" Baracus, he deftly portrayed a wrong
ly-accused fugitive who helped the underdog
come out on top with his brawny intimida
tion as a member of the famed "A-Team."
Now, he's schlepping silly comic books
featuring himself as the leader of a pathetic
"we-don't-use-weapons-to-administer-jus
tice" crime fighting force.
Yes, the one and only Mr. T., who seemed
to tower over all during the early half of the
'80s, who taught a cartoon gymnastics
troupe the true meaning of being winners,
who had a cereal made in his image is the
same one-time mohawked wonder who is
shorter than most of my friends, who has re
sorted to begging for cash at a two-bit comic
book store in Nowheresville, Texas, who has
fallen from commercial glory to general ig
nominy. Imagine my pain at seeing a hero
from my childhood relegated to an oh-so
pathetic sideshow as the star freak.
I had prepped myself all summer for his
arrival, waking in time to watch that favorite

show from my elementary school days day
in and day out. 1 studied every nuance of the
show: the cunning of leader Hannibal
Smith, the brilliant insanity of "Howling
Mad" Murdock, the sly trickery of con-man
Templeton "Face" Peck.
Yet what I most appreciated was the silent
genius of B.A. Baracus' brute force. His
steely glint of determination, his irrational,
even comic, fear of flying, his terse elo
quence made this daily cultural experience
all the more meaningful and worthwhile.
Still, I should have paid attention to all
the warning signs announcing his demise. A
featured role in "D.C. Cab," a tag team with
Hulk Hogan at the first "Wrestlemania," an
ill-fated syndicated action drama called "T
and T" — all these projects pointed to a star
on the wane. Say it sin't so!
However, I expected a rejuvenated Mr. T.
Surely, this man who brought "mohawk"
back into our cultural vocabulary had the

potential of being a proud phoenix rising
above the ashes of a gutted career, the har
binger of a much-awaited, much-desired
"A-Team" reunion to satisfy the nostalgic
cravings of millions of adoring fans.
At first, he met my lofty expectations.
The affable man, decked in a smart Hawai
ian print outfit and sporting an understated
gold and emerald studded necklace around
his trunk-like neck, posed with fans. He
even bestowed a starstruck follower with
gold necklaces (from which a fork and
spoon hung) for a photo opportunity.
With each of his natural movements,
with each of his toothy smiles and hearty
laughs, I grew more and more anxious for a
chance to talk to this paragon of' Bos chic.
Many of my questions were asked by oth
ers and answered by him in turn. Of course
he wasn't scared of flying; that was only a
funny plot device in just about every
episode of "The A-Team." No, the love-hate

relationship he and Murdock explored so
rivetingly on the small screen didn't carry
over to "real life." Such sincere responses
made me all the more anxious to ask him
about an "A-Team" reprisal.
Gathering my courage, 1 sprung the
question on him — only to be non-chalant
ly rebuffed by the one-time icon with, "1
hope so! I need the money!" Just imagine
how his answer shattered the wistful kid in
me. This man who once stood as a pillar of
blunt justice and for warped '80s morality
had shrunk before my eyes to a petty, greedy
dwarf of his former self.
And it gets worse. Images of Mr. T shaking
a plastic piggy-bank bust of himself, claiming
"That's happy Mr. T. He's got money!" still
haunt me when 1 think about it.
So Mr. T, take your place in line with
those other has-been stars, like New Kids on
the Block and Tiffany and your wrestling
buddy Hulk Hogan, who try to cash in on
old glory when no one really cares anymore.
Your 15 minutes are up, so fade away like the
man you once at least appeared to be and let
our wonderful memories of childhood
hero-worship live on untainted. ■
