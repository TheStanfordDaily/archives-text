# Allgood at the crossroads
## From a gym in Tennessee to a gig at EBF 
### Tommy Heys 
Sometimes you can forget that a good,
hard slap can leave five red fingers on your
face. When it's gone, you never think about it
until you get slapped again.
I saw Allgood for the first time three years
ago in Chattanooga, TN. They played that
concert in a high school gym for about four
hundred people who were truly into the
music and had seen the band play before.
Up to that point, good bands that I had
seen were playing material straight off their
albums, maybe adding a guitar riff or two to
the solo. But Allgood was the first band I saw
that tried to take full advantage of the live set
ting: the band's members took the energy the
crowd put into the music and used it to refine
their sound into a dynamic personality with
a distinct soul.
When I heard that Allgood was playing at
Stanford, the live music jones was reawak
ened in me, but I had my doubts. This is Cal
ifornia, not the South. None of these surfers
and raviacs had probably heard of Allgood,
much less heard an actual recording. Would
the tough Stanford crowd roll out on a
Wednesday night for live music when it
would be just as easily study for that Hum Bio
midterm on Friday?
Most live shows I have seen at Stanford,
whether they were played for 16 or 2000 peo
ple, had lagged every which way but up.
Nevertheless, I force-played Allgood in my
friends' rooms and promised their live sound
would blow the place apart. I let descriptions
fly of 20-minute songs that would warp your
mind like a psychedelic dragon, crushing you
with musical intensity. Dueling guitar solos,
homebilly grooves, severe distortion of reali
ty. I was a walking, drawling advertisement
for the band. But even I wasn't sure they

could pull it off.
Allgood came prepared to EBF. Although
there weren't even risers, the sound system
that had been lugged into the lounge had the
wattage to play at Shoreline Amphitheater. It
turned out to be a welcome change to have
the band on the floor — no distance between
the crowd and the band gave the show a per
sonal feel.
The band has a style all its own. Charlie
Pruet has a powerful, funkified style on the
drums and includes some interesting toys in
his set like an ice bell and a timbale. He lays
down strong groovy beats, giving the audi
ence no choice but to throw its weight
around. Mike Sain lends some bonus funk
roots to the band with his five string bass. He
doesn't limit himself to basic bass-line
rhythm patterns, being more than apt to toss
in everything from short touch-ons to ex
tended jams with the guitars, matching them
note for note. He also adds solid backing rock
vocals.
Clay "the Doctor" Fuller plays the first
lead guitar, throwing out mind-warping,
bluesy solos with no more emotion than a
smirk. As you watch him live, you'll be glad
when he solos that he doesn't get into it with
his whole body. The audience might faint
from disbelief.
The "Reverend" John Carter mans the
other lead guitar on stage, bringing with him
strong blues influences like Stevie Ray
Vaughan and the Allman Brothers. By no
means does he let either of those styles hold
him back, taking the best of both and forging
a new path.
Lead singer Corky Jones builds a strong
energy with his deep, throaty Southern voice
the listener can hardly believe he's the same

slow-sippin' good ol' boy who chats with the
audience between songs.
All this in one cooker turns out a sound
that was best captured in the strange phrase
"southern funkadelia." Control of these three
genres that might seem incompatible is what
makes the band superb. Imagine, if you will,
music that is compelling lyrically, exception
al in its musicianship, improvisational in
twists and maximally danceable. All good.
Nothing better.
The band started playing gigs mainly
around the college and high school campus
es in the South in the late '80s as the Allgood
Music Company. The band's home is Athens,
Ga., the same music scene that produced
R.E.M. and the Indigo Girls. The band short
ened its name to Allgood immediately before
its self-produced first album, "Ride the Bee,"
an excellent disc with a good, but watered
down version of their live sound.
For their second release, "Uncommon
Goal," they were picked up by the A&M
Records label, which allowed the band's
members to tour extensively. This summer,
they played on the H.O.R.D.E. tour for larger
audiences that were only mildly familiar with
their sound.
What distinguishes a great live band from
a great band is the ability to perform. That's
why all summer long and at shows like the
one at EBF, bands like Allgood sell them
selves. I don't exaggerate when I say that no
one left EBF unimpressed. Who could be
after more than three hours and two sets of
incredible music?
For every ounce of energy the audience
put in, the band could recycle it into a musi
cal form that was unrivaled in most live
shows I have seen of other bands.
For once, the Stanford audience wasn't
standing dumbfounded with hands in pock
ets. Everyone was rocking and screaming
like they didn't want to talk the next day. 1

could hardly whisper Thursday afternoon,
but I couldn't miss the chance to go with
some friends to San Francisco and try to
whip that whooping concert voice back into
shape.
I had not heard the band play any of their
new material from "Uncommon Goal."
Frankly, I was unimpressed with the second
album in comparison with the first because it
lacked any flavor for the band's live sound. All
of the songs are four minutes long with pro
grammed solo slots, verses and choruses — it
sounded too damn much like Stevie Ray —
plenty of reason to worry all the more about
the show's success.
But in concert, all the songs developed an
individual flair that still smacked wet of the
band I knew. Not to mention that the "Rev
erend" Carter blasted out an amazing two
minute guitar solo playing with his teeth. I
doubt that I have ever seen better control of a
musical instrument than in those two min
utes.
Songs from Allgood's first album broke
out of its album structures into fantastic ex
amples of what hard practice can do to
music. A wealth of character, improved tight
ness and defined song dynamics were the re
sults, no matter if you compare the Stanford
show to the album or to the shows I had seen
in the past.
If I left Baylor High School three years im
pressed, I left EBF astounded. The band
couldn't have done more to develop their live
ability in three years. The best thing about
live music is that the audience is in control of
the show. The more we yell and dance, the
better they play. Moral of the story: live music
is your friend.
Don't expect the band members to open
doors the next time you hear them live or
when they release a new album. Expect them
to knock it to splinters so that everyone else
can come in and dance. ■

Sometimes you can forget that a good,

I saw Allgood for the first time three years

from disbelief.
The "Reverend" John Carter mans the
other lead guitar on stage, bringing with him
strong blues influences like Stevie Ray
Vaughan and the Allman Brothers. By no
means does he let either of those styles hold
him back, taking the best of both and forging
a new path.
Lead singer Corky Jones builds a strong
energy with his deep, throaty Southern voice
the listener can hardly believe he's the same

slow-sippin' good ol' boy who chats with the
audience between songs.
All this in one cooker turns out a sound
that was best captured in the strange phrase
"southern funkadelia." Control of these three
genres that might seem incompatible is what
makes the band superb. Imagine, if you will,
music that is compelling lyrically, exception
al in its musicianship, improvisational in
twists and maximally danceable. All good.
Nothing better.
The band started playing gigs mainly
around the college and high school campus
es in the South in the late '80s as the Allgood
Music Company. The band's home is Athens,
Ga., the same music scene that produced
R.E.M. and the Indigo Girls. The band short
ened its name to Allgood immediately before
its self-produced first album, "Ride the Bee,"
an excellent disc with a good, but watered
down version of their live sound.
For their second release, "Uncommon
Goal," they were picked up by the A&M
Records label, which allowed the band's
members to tour extensively. This summer,
they played on the H.O.R.D.E. tour for larger
audiences that were only mildly familiar with
their sound.
What distinguishes a great live band from
a great band is the ability to perform. That's
why all summer long and at shows like the
one at EBF, bands like Allgood sell them
selves. I don't exaggerate when I say that no
one left EBF unimpressed. Who could be
after more than three hours and two sets of
incredible music?
For every ounce of energy the audience
put in, the band could recycle it into a musi
cal form that was unrivaled in most live
shows I have seen of other bands.
For once, the Stanford audience wasn't
standing dumbfounded with hands in pock
ets. Everyone was rocking and screaming
like they didn't want to talk the next day. 1

could hardly whisper Thursday afternoon,
but I couldn't miss the chance to go with
some friends to San Francisco and try to
whip that whooping concert voice back into
shape.
I had not heard the band play any of their
new material from "Uncommon Goal."
Frankly, I was unimpressed with the second
album in comparison with the first because it
lacked any flavor for the band's live sound. All
of the songs are four minutes long with pro
grammed solo slots, verses and choruses — it
sounded too damn much like Stevie Ray —
plenty of reason to worry all the more about
the show's success.
But in concert, all the songs developed an
individual flair that still smacked wet of the
band I knew. Not to mention that the "Rev
erend" Carter blasted out an amazing two
minute guitar solo playing with his teeth. I
doubt that I have ever seen better control of a
musical instrument than in those two min
utes.
Songs from Allgood's first album broke
out of its album structures into fantastic ex
amples of what hard practice can do to
music. A wealth of character, improved tight
ness and defined song dynamics were the re
sults, no matter if you compare the Stanford
show to the album or to the shows I had seen
in the past.
If I left Baylor High School three years im
pressed, I left EBF astounded. The band
couldn't have done more to develop their live
ability in three years. The best thing about
live music is that the audience is in control of
the show. The more we yell and dance, the
better they play. Moral of the story: live music
is your friend.
Don't expect the band members to open
doors the next time you hear them live or
when they release a new album. Expect them
to knock it to splinters so that everyone else
can come in and dance. ■

Sometimes you can forget that a good,
hard slap can leave five red fingers on your
face. When it's gone, you never think about it
until you get slapped again.
I saw Allgood for the first time three years
ago in Chattanooga, TN. They played that
concert in a high school gym for about four
hundred people who were truly into the
music and had seen the band play before.
Up to that point, good bands that I had
seen were playing material straight off their
albums, maybe adding a guitar riff or two to
the solo. But Allgood was the first band I saw
that tried to take full advantage of the live set
ting: the band's members took the energy the
crowd put into the music and used it to refine
their sound into a dynamic personality with
a distinct soul.
When I heard that Allgood was playing at
Stanford, the live music jones was reawak
ened in me, but I had my doubts. This is Cal
ifornia, not the South. None of these surfers
and raviacs had probably heard of Allgood,
much less heard an actual recording. Would
the tough Stanford crowd roll out on a
Wednesday night for live music when it
would be just as easily study for that Hum Bio
midterm on Friday?
Most live shows I have seen at Stanford,
whether they were played for 16 or 2000 peo
ple, had lagged every which way but up.
Nevertheless, I force-played Allgood in my
friends' rooms and promised their live sound
would blow the place apart. I let descriptions
fly of 20-minute songs that would warp your
mind like a psychedelic dragon, crushing you
with musical intensity. Dueling guitar solos,
homebilly grooves, severe distortion of reali
ty. I was a walking, drawling advertisement
for the band. But even I wasn't sure they

could pull it off.
Allgood came prepared to EBF. Although
there weren't even risers, the sound system
that had been lugged into the lounge had the
wattage to play at Shoreline Amphitheater. It
turned out to be a welcome change to have
the band on the floor — no distance between
the crowd and the band gave the show a per
sonal feel.
The band has a style all its own. Charlie
Pruet has a powerful, funkified style on the
drums and includes some interesting toys in
his set like an ice bell and a timbale. He lays
down strong groovy beats, giving the audi
ence no choice but to throw its weight
around. Mike Sain lends some bonus funk
roots to the band with his five string bass. He
doesn't limit himself to basic bass-line
rhythm patterns, being more than apt to toss
in everything from short touch-ons to ex
tended jams with the guitars, matching them
note for note. He also adds solid backing rock
vocals.
Clay "the Doctor" Fuller plays the first
lead guitar, throwing out mind-warping,
bluesy solos with no more emotion than a
smirk. As you watch him live, you'll be glad
when he solos that he doesn't get into it with
his whole body. The audience might faint
from disbelief.
