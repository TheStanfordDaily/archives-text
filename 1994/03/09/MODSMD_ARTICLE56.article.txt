# NAKED JANE BARES IT ALL
## GETTING PERSONAL WITH KZSU'S TALK-SHOW STAR 
### LISA CORRIGAN 
Tarzan, step back. Naked Jane is a
woman with a voice who has taken
Stanford's radio waves by storm.
"Bare It All with Naked Jane," a weekly
radio talk show on the Zoo, Stanford's 90.1
FM KZSU, airs every Monday night at 6 p.m.
For 30 minutes each week, business grad stu
dent Jane Schuchinski interviews guests and
welcomes phone-in callers on current,
provocative, engaging issues. Unlike Tarzan's
female counterpart, this Jane doesn't do her
shows scantily clothed.
Naked Jane isn't looking for flesh — she
seeks the naked truth.
Ranging from sexual harassment to fat ac
ceptance, Jane's topics are a vital ingredient for
the success of "Bare It All." With her guests,
Jane discusses "spicy" topics like "prostitution
advocacy." Other shows focus on subjects
which Jane feels "people might be too embar
rassed or intimidated to ask about," or to
which "the general public might not have ac
cess." For example, "Bare It All" has stripped
naked topics such as "vibrators, dildos and
other sex toys" and "men's rights." As Naked
Jane says, "there are really no rules as to which
topics I cover."
Jane's goal for "Bare It All" "is to have a
forum for these topics that may not get dis
cussed otherwise." She cites an example of her
show with an HIV-positive man, of which she
is very proud. "I was asking him some very
straightforward questions about what it is to
live with HIV, and that's the sort of thing
where a lot of us don't know someone who is
HIV-positive, or to our knowledge isn't HlV
positive, and therefore, we have all these
questions but we don't know who to ask."
On a lighter note, Jane also wants "to have
topics which arc fun, or funny." She notes, "I
had a sex therapist on for Valentine's Day. We
just laughed the whole time."
Naked Jane effectively opens discussions
instead of tailoring them to air her own per
sonal beliefs. She walks the fine line between
naked and indecent with skill. Ali Salomon,
KZSU news director, notes "Jane's candor and
composure are qualities which make her show
provocative but not offensive."
Surprisingly, Naked Jane has no previous
training. Discussing how she entered the field,
Jane looks as if she's pulling her hair out while
she wonders, with a mix of worry and excite
ment, "What am I doing?"
Naked Jane graduated from Barnard College
of Columbia University in 1990. After a stint in
investment banking, she is now a second-year
business school student at the Farm. Though
parts of her job on Wall Street were "really quite
interesting," Jane doesn't seem too disappointed

to have traded "very exhausting, 120-hour work
weeks" for her show. "This is just so much fun."
The seed for a radio talk show came from a
former business partner at her Wall Street job
who told her, "You're in the wrong business,
you should have a talk show," she said. "I was
talking with some friends about what to do
after business school and half-jokingly I said I
wanted to be a talk-show host."
Jane was "really sort of kidding," but a
friend and her husband, who teaches at the
business school, "thought that it was a great
idea, and took the idea seriously and encour
aged me to pursue it." He agreed to sponsor
her if she'd do an independent project study

ing the entertainment industry and media
personalities. After talks with KZSU, Naked
Jane landed the 6 p.m. time slot taking over a
show called "Campus Conference."
Because the Zoo fields other student shows
with delectable titles, she wanted her own. The
name "Campus Conference" wasn't enticing
enough for Jane, especially with her format.
"I was out with some friends and one of
them came up with the name Naked Jane, and
so we decided I'd call the show, 'Bare It All With
Naked Jane'. So, a week before the show I told
the station, 'By the way, this isn't 'Campus Con
ference, ' this is 'Bare It All With Naked Jane.'"
Jane recalls with some astonishment and

pride, "it took off." In a short time, "Bare It
All" has become the most successful call-in
show at KZSU, garnering six to 20 calls per
show. The campus response to the show "is
unbelievable. I'm so overwhelmed at the sup
port and encouragement I've gotten," Jane
says, especially since the San Francisco Chron
icle's feature on Naked Jane two weeks ago.
Naked Jane is definitely not going back to
Wall Street. On the morning of our interview,
she told me, "The big news is I turned down
my Wall Street job. I'm going to try to do this
professionally somehow." According to Jane,
"If I can earn a living doing this, it would just
be the happiest thing in the world." ■

had a sex therapist on for Valentine's Day. We
just laughed the whole time."
Naked Jane effectively opens discussions
instead of tailoring them to air her own per
sonal beliefs. She walks the fine line between
naked and indecent with skill. Ali Salomon,
KZSU news director, notes "Jane's candor and
composure are qualities which make her show
provocative but not offensive."
Surprisingly, Naked Jane has no previous
training. Discussing how she entered the field,
Jane looks as if she's pulling her hair out while
she wonders, with a mix of worry and excite
ment, "What am I doing?"
Naked Jane graduated from Barnard College
of Columbia University in 1990. After a stint in
investment banking, she is now a second-year
business school student at the Farm. Though
parts of her job on Wall Street were "really quite
interesting," Jane doesn't seem too disappointed

to have traded "very exhausting, 120-hour work
weeks" for her show. "This is just so much fun."
The seed for a radio talk show came from a
former business partner at her Wall Street job
who told her, "You're in the wrong business,
you should have a talk show," she said. "I was
talking with some friends about what to do
after business school and half-jokingly I said I
wanted to be a talk-show host."
Jane was "really sort of kidding," but a
friend and her husband, who teaches at the
business school, "thought that it was a great
idea, and took the idea seriously and encour
aged me to pursue it." He agreed to sponsor
her if she'd do an independent project study

ing the entertainment industry and media
personalities. After talks with KZSU, Naked
Jane landed the 6 p.m. time slot taking over a
show called "Campus Conference."
Because the Zoo fields other student shows
with delectable titles, she wanted her own. The
name "Campus Conference" wasn't enticing
enough for Jane, especially with her format.
"I was out with some friends and one of
them came up with the name Naked Jane, and
so we decided I'd call the show, 'Bare It All With
Naked Jane'. So, a week before the show I told
the station, 'By the way, this isn't 'Campus Con
ference, ' this is 'Bare It All With Naked Jane.'"
Jane recalls with some astonishment and

pride, "it took off." In a short time, "Bare It
All" has become the most successful call-in
show at KZSU, garnering six to 20 calls per
show. The campus response to the show "is
unbelievable. I'm so overwhelmed at the sup
port and encouragement I've gotten," Jane
says, especially since the San Francisco Chron
icle's feature on Naked Jane two weeks ago.
Naked Jane is definitely not going back to
Wall Street. On the morning of our interview,
she told me, "The big news is I turned down
my Wall Street job. I'm going to try to do this
professionally somehow." According to Jane,
"If I can earn a living doing this, it would just
be the happiest thing in the world." ■
