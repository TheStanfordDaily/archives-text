Across the street from the Potrero po
lice station, by the Bay and nestled
among Asian wholesale food ware
houses, cocktail dives and hulking heavy in
dustry factories, lie the offices of Sharona
Productions: two rooms stocked with
screenplays, pirated videos — and Alan Ja
cobs, a film director who, though recently re
luctant to direct films at all, might be poised
to enter the upper stratum of American
moviemaking.
Lounging behind a small desk in a small
room with little else besides several bat
tered movie posters taped to the wall, Ja
cobs — a lean, sharp-featured 35-year-old
wearing a black Jewish Film Festival t-shirt
and blue jeans — seems in no hurry to
move upscale.
Not that change bothers him. His first
feature film, "Nina Takes A Lover," which
details the trysts of a young San Francisco
wife, came in third in the audience poll at
the Sundance Film Festival several weeks
ago, which in the industry is more than a
foot in the door — it's more like an arm, a
leg and some shoulder too.
That the auditors at Sundance decided to
accept "Nina" after initially rejecting it was
especially sweet, forcing Jacobs to gladly
cancel a vacation in Arizona and jet to the
yuppie ski slopes of Park City, Utah. And
now his latest venture — a comedy called
"SFO" — has been given the green light by
Zoetroppe, Francis Ford Coppola's studio,
and should be calling on big-name stars to
fill the leads.
All this from a man whose formal training
in film mainly consists of finance classes at
Stanford business school.
That's MBA. not MFA
"Sundance went very well," Jacobs says re
servedly. "We were very well received there.
It's really like a convention. Like any conven
tion, people come from all over who are in
the business to meet other people in the busi
ness, and what's being traded are the films.
Didn't seem like there were many people
there to enjoy a film festival, like the San
Francisco Film Festival." (Jacobs points out
that "Nina" will be showcased at the San
Francisco Film Festival this spring, so look
for it.)
Born in suburban Rockland County,
N.Y., Jacobs majored in English at Wesleyan
and never possessed even fleeting thoughts
of being a filmmaker. "When I was in col
lege, I really didn't like movies," he says. "I
didn't go because I was afraid that they
would give me a vicarious experience, and
then I wouldn't want to have the real experi
ence. Shows how twisted my head was."
After writing mostly non-fiction in col
lege, Jacobs became a journalist for a region
al newspaper in Hackensack, N.J. But after
six years, he began to feel constrained.
"It was very competitive to get a good job
in journalism," he says. "There's a lot of tal
ented writers, very few good jobs. And I also
started to feel limited by the truth."

Saying that he would have gone to the
Peace Corps as long as he broke new ground,
Jacobs, like other college educated, vocation
ally-disoriented youths, applied to law
school. But none of the five law schools he
applied to — and he applied only to the top
five — accepted him. "I think I would have
been a terrible lawyer," he says. "Just been re
ally depressed in law school."
But other professional school admission
tests abounded. "Three months after the
LSAT there was the MCAT — no, the
GMAT," says Jacobs, searching his memory
for that happy time. "I just kind of looked at
he thing and said, 'Well, the GMAT looks eas
ier than the LSAT,' so I just sat down and took
it, and I was much more relaxed and I did
much better."
Eventually, Jacobs landed at Stanford
business school, sitting next to five other
journalists, an NBA basketball player, an
NHL hockey player and others, though he
wasn't sure where management would lead
him. "I thought there must be something
good coming from Stanford business school,
but I didn't know what. But I'm an oppor
tunist," he says.
Within nine months at the Farm, Jacobs
was making his first film, "Legal Tender,"
which dealt with business ethics. He raised
the money himself, calling corporations for
money. He spent most of his second year
making another film.
Management training certainly hasn't
been lost by the wayside for Jacobs. "The fact
is that we're in the entertainment business,"
he says. "There are people down the hall
from me who are artists — painters. They sit
in their studio and when they want to make a
painting they go out to the store and buy
paints and a canvas and that's all they need. I
need hundreds of thousands or millions of
dollars and that's means knowing something
about business."
"Nina" especially benefited from Jacobs'
mercantile training. It "taught me how to
raise money," he continues. "I couldn't have
made this film this way — I could have made
a $ 10,000 or $20,000 movie, but I made a big
ger film than that."
I never even wanted to direct
When asked what was most difficult about
making "Nina," Jacobs says that it was the
fundraising, a process which involved ap
proaching private sources and took the bet
ter part of a year—"Well, the script was pret
ty hard, too," he says, reconsidering, "and it's
difficult to get access to talent," he adds, real
izing the typical directorial problems.
Jacobs wrote "Nina" in four days — after
putting it off for nine months. "Of course I
didn't get started on it until about the last
month or so," he says. "I went through a lot
of scripts — in fact, I wrote the entire script
for 'SFO' before I wrote 'Nina.' I had to pro
crastinate — you know, put my albums in al
phabetical order, things like that."
"It's like the earth being void and without
form for many years, and then boom — a

lightning bolt strikes and it all makes sense.
"wUsually, what I do is jot down an idea
here, an idea there. When I have enough crit
ical mass I sit down and write the whole
thing. I'm always a littlesuspicious of it when
it comes out piece by piece — it really should
come out whole."
As for theme, Jacobs again says he shies
away from preconception: "I wasn't trying to
say anything; I was trying to reflect whatever
was going on in my mind at that time, and
just let these characters talk. I don't know
about other writers but when I start to con
sciously write things, it's usually my worst
writing. When I just let it come out — I don't
know where it's coming from — that's usual
ly the best."
But Jacobs learned to trust his own in
stincts only after writing half a dozen screen
plays penned with the sole intention of mak
ing money. "1 heard you could get rich quick
by writing a screenplay and never tell the

truth once," he says.
"I had no interest in
film. I just wanted
to make money. I
never even wanted
to direct — I didn't
even want to direct
'Nina'."
But with "Nina"
the first script that
Jacobs wrote with
out commercial
considerations, he
realized he had to
direct it. "You have
no choice: if you
love the thing you
can't give it up, and
you learn how to
take care of it like a
parent."
Jacobs had dis
covered that the

screenplay is "an incomplete medium. It's
meant to be the plan and not meant to be the
end. What I say is that the screenwriter is the
genetic parent of the movie and the director
is the custodian or guardian. Sometimes it's
right to put the script up for adoption — a lot
of writers are not capable of directing, and I
didn't think I was for many years."
I u movies nre qnod
So Jacobs learned to direct by "making
mistakes and trying," never even thinking
about going to film school because he never
wanted to be a director anyway. As part of his
training, he's currently watching movies,
comedies especially, to prepare for "SFO,"
and they stack the shelves in one of the rooms
at Sharona Productions.
"I really enjoy B-movies because they're
bad and they're ftin and easy to watch. When
I watch a good movie it's very taxing because
I feel I have a lot to learn from it. So I like
watching bad movies, because you can learn
from them also. It's just more fun."
Jacobs admires Martin Scorsese and
Robert Altman — "consistently good film-

For years I wrote screenplays I
thought everybody wanted. Hut
that s not what people want —
they want something unique,
something they haven t seen he
fore. 1 don t I h hi It success equals

-jfeAlttn Jarobai

makers who satisfy both critics and audi
ences" — and he himself would like his films
to be widely seen. "Ultimately we're making
entertainment," he says. "If we make people
reflect on their own lives a little differently
and move them and they're still thinking a
few days later, then it's a great success."
"The thing 1 have a hard time remember
ing and a lot of people have a hard time re
membering, is that it's just a movie," he says,
smiling.
i'ilm now, kailcu later ?
Now equally comfortable as director and
writer, Jacobs says "you can't separate them
in my mind." Flowever, he admits that "I
think I have much more talent writing — it's
the only thing I've done consistently since the
ninth grade."
Musing on his newfound status as a di
rector with a budding reputation among
the right circles, Jacobs says that much of

his good for
tune is simply
good luck and
exploited op
portunity.
"Once you
break through
and get the
chance to di
rect, it's sort of
like you're in

another league," he says. No longer consid
ered a first-timer, Jacobs says that "all I've
done is work for 24 days shooting a film.
Now let's say six months of shooting, and
I'm considered 'experienced,' and I'm set
apart from all the others who haven't done
one. That's the big jump. And if you break
through that barrier, you're lucky."
Do the temptations of Hollywood's mil
lions of dollars threaten to dilute Jacobs
artistic vision? "Nina" — a talky film that
meanders over the subject of marital infi
delity and the possibility of preserving pas
sion for a lifetime — probably won't ap
peal to the "Ace Ventura, Pet Detective"
crowd.
Jacobs isn't worried. He isn't packing up
for Studio City or Hollywood, and he says "I
hope to keep on making the films I want to
make." At the same time, he also realizes that
entertainment hasn't brought in limousines
or Malibu real estate yet, and that "I've also
got one child and another one due in a
month and a half. I have to think about sup
porting a family too."
But Jacobs feels that unique visions can
survive, indeed thrive in Hollywood. "I
think a lot of people may succumb and do
what Hollywood wants, but those aren't
the ones that Hollywood wants. For years I
wrote screenplays I thought everybody
wanted. But that's not what people want
— they want something unique, some

thing they haven't seen before. I don't
think success equals compromising your
vision."
As examples, Jacobs cites the quirky yet
moneymaking visuals of Tim Burton, the
talky yet popular comedies of Woody Allen
and the squeaky-clean big budget grandios
ity of Steven Spielberg.
"And those people for the most part see
their movie come out the way they want," Ja
cobs says. "What I aspire to, I don't know
what that is yet. I don't know what that Alan
Jacobs movie is, or if there ever will be one
— maybe it'll be just a mishmash of different
things. But I think there's room to keep your
own voice — I think there's more than room
— I think those are the people who really
succeed."
But Jacobs nevertheless seems willing to
accept fortune or failure as they come, al
ways prepared to return to his center —
writing — whatever vagaries arise. Film
seems to be a pleasant side trail he's current
ly exploring.
"A lot of life is just circumstance and hap
penstance and accident," he says. "For me
the line that runs through it all, no matter
what the different circumstances are, is that
I'm just going to keep on writing. That's
what I love to do and what I do best. At this
point in my life I'm writing film. Once I
wrote journalism, maybe one day I'll write
novels. Or haiku." ■

Jacobs wrote "Nina" in four days — after
putting it off for nine months. "Of course I
didn't get started on it until about the last
month or so," he says. "I went through a lot
of scripts — in fact, I wrote the entire script
for 'SFO' before I wrote 'Nina.' I had to pro
crastinate — you know, put my albums in al
phabetical order, things like that."
"It's like the earth being void and without
form for many years, and then boom — a

lightning bolt strikes and it all makes sense.
"wUsually, what I do is jot down an idea
here, an idea there. When I have enough crit
ical mass I sit down and write the whole
thing. I'm always a littlesuspicious of it when
it comes out piece by piece — it really should
come out whole."
As for theme, Jacobs again says he shies
away from preconception: "I wasn't trying to
say anything; I was trying to reflect whatever
was going on in my mind at that time, and
just let these characters talk. I don't know
about other writers but when I start to con
sciously write things, it's usually my worst
writing. When I just let it come out — I don't
know where it's coming from — that's usual
ly the best."
But Jacobs learned to trust his own in
stincts only after writing half a dozen screen
plays penned with the sole intention of mak
ing money. "1 heard you could get rich quick
by writing a screenplay and never tell the

truth once," he says.
"I had no interest in
film. I just wanted
to make money. I
never even wanted
to direct — I didn't
even want to direct
'Nina'."
But with "Nina"
the first script that
Jacobs wrote with
out commercial
considerations, he
realized he had to
direct it. "You have
no choice: if you
love the thing you
can't give it up, and
you learn how to
take care of it like a
parent."
Jacobs had dis
covered that the

screenplay is "an incomplete medium. It's
meant to be the plan and not meant to be the
end. What I say is that the screenwriter is the
genetic parent of the movie and the director
is the custodian or guardian. Sometimes it's
right to put the script up for adoption — a lot
of writers are not capable of directing, and I
didn't think I was for many years."
I u movies nre qnod
So Jacobs learned to direct by "making
mistakes and trying," never even thinking
about going to film school because he never
wanted to be a director anyway. As part of his
training, he's currently watching movies,
comedies especially, to prepare for "SFO,"
and they stack the shelves in one of the rooms
at Sharona Productions.
"I really enjoy B-movies because they're
bad and they're ftin and easy to watch. When
I watch a good movie it's very taxing because
I feel I have a lot to learn from it. So I like
watching bad movies, because you can learn
from them also. It's just more fun."
Jacobs admires Martin Scorsese and
Robert Altman — "consistently good film-

makers who satisfy both critics and audi
ences" — and he himself would like his films
to be widely seen. "Ultimately we're making
entertainment," he says. "If we make people
reflect on their own lives a little differently
and move them and they're still thinking a
few days later, then it's a great success."
"The thing 1 have a hard time remember
ing and a lot of people have a hard time re
membering, is that it's just a movie," he says,
smiling.
i'ilm now, kailcu later ?
Now equally comfortable as director and
writer, Jacobs says "you can't separate them
in my mind." Flowever, he admits that "I
think I have much more talent writing — it's
the only thing I've done consistently since the
ninth grade."
Musing on his newfound status as a di
rector with a budding reputation among
the right circles, Jacobs says that much of

his good for
tune is simply
good luck and
exploited op
portunity.
"Once you
break through
and get the
chance to di
rect, it's sort of
like you're in

another league," he says. No longer consid
ered a first-timer, Jacobs says that "all I've
done is work for 24 days shooting a film.
Now let's say six months of shooting, and
I'm considered 'experienced,' and I'm set
apart from all the others who haven't done
one. That's the big jump. And if you break
through that barrier, you're lucky."
Do the temptations of Hollywood's mil
lions of dollars threaten to dilute Jacobs
artistic vision? "Nina" — a talky film that
meanders over the subject of marital infi
delity and the possibility of preserving pas
sion for a lifetime — probably won't ap
peal to the "Ace Ventura, Pet Detective"
crowd.
Jacobs isn't worried. He isn't packing up
for Studio City or Hollywood, and he says "I
hope to keep on making the films I want to
make." At the same time, he also realizes that
entertainment hasn't brought in limousines
or Malibu real estate yet, and that "I've also
got one child and another one due in a
month and a half. I have to think about sup
porting a family too."
But Jacobs feels that unique visions can
survive, indeed thrive in Hollywood. "I
think a lot of people may succumb and do
what Hollywood wants, but those aren't
the ones that Hollywood wants. For years I
wrote screenplays I thought everybody
wanted. But that's not what people want
— they want something unique, some

thing they haven't seen before. I don't
think success equals compromising your
vision."
As examples, Jacobs cites the quirky yet
moneymaking visuals of Tim Burton, the
talky yet popular comedies of Woody Allen
and the squeaky-clean big budget grandios
ity of Steven Spielberg.
"And those people for the most part see
their movie come out the way they want," Ja
cobs says. "What I aspire to, I don't know
what that is yet. I don't know what that Alan
Jacobs movie is, or if there ever will be one
— maybe it'll be just a mishmash of different
things. But I think there's room to keep your
own voice — I think there's more than room
— I think those are the people who really
succeed."
But Jacobs nevertheless seems willing to
accept fortune or failure as they come, al
ways prepared to return to his center —
writing — whatever vagaries arise. Film
seems to be a pleasant side trail he's current
ly exploring.
"A lot of life is just circumstance and hap
penstance and accident," he says. "For me
the line that runs through it all, no matter
what the different circumstances are, is that
I'm just going to keep on writing. That's
what I love to do and what I do best. At this
point in my life I'm writing film. Once I
wrote journalism, maybe one day I'll write
novels. Or haiku." ■


Across the street from the Potrero po
lice station, by the Bay and nestled
among Asian wholesale food ware
houses, cocktail dives and hulking heavy in
dustry factories, lie the offices of Sharona
Productions: two rooms stocked with
screenplays, pirated videos — and Alan Ja
cobs, a film director who, though recently re
luctant to direct films at all, might be poised
to enter the upper stratum of American
moviemaking.
Lounging behind a small desk in a small
room with little else besides several bat
tered movie posters taped to the wall, Ja
cobs — a lean, sharp-featured 35-year-old
wearing a black Jewish Film Festival t-shirt
and blue jeans — seems in no hurry to
move upscale.
Not that change bothers him. His first
feature film, "Nina Takes A Lover," which
details the trysts of a young San Francisco
wife, came in third in the audience poll at
the Sundance Film Festival several weeks
ago, which in the industry is more than a
foot in the door — it's more like an arm, a
leg and some shoulder too.
That the auditors at Sundance decided to
accept "Nina" after initially rejecting it was
especially sweet, forcing Jacobs to gladly
cancel a vacation in Arizona and jet to the
yuppie ski slopes of Park City, Utah. And
now his latest venture — a comedy called
"SFO" — has been given the green light by
Zoetroppe, Francis Ford Coppola's studio,
and should be calling on big-name stars to
fill the leads.
All this from a man whose formal training
in film mainly consists of finance classes at
Stanford business school.
That's MBA. not MFA
"Sundance went very well," Jacobs says re
servedly. "We were very well received there.
It's really like a convention. Like any conven
tion, people come from all over who are in
the business to meet other people in the busi
ness, and what's being traded are the films.
Didn't seem like there were many people
there to enjoy a film festival, like the San
Francisco Film Festival." (Jacobs points out
that "Nina" will be showcased at the San
Francisco Film Festival this spring, so look
for it.)
Born in suburban Rockland County,
N.Y., Jacobs majored in English at Wesleyan
and never possessed even fleeting thoughts
of being a filmmaker. "When I was in col
lege, I really didn't like movies," he says. "I
didn't go because I was afraid that they
would give me a vicarious experience, and
then I wouldn't want to have the real experi
ence. Shows how twisted my head was."
After writing mostly non-fiction in col
lege, Jacobs became a journalist for a region
al newspaper in Hackensack, N.J. But after
six years, he began to feel constrained.
"It was very competitive to get a good job
in journalism," he says. "There's a lot of tal
ented writers, very few good jobs. And I also
started to feel limited by the truth."

Saying that he would have gone to the
Peace Corps as long as he broke new ground,
Jacobs, like other college educated, vocation
ally-disoriented youths, applied to law
school. But none of the five law schools he
applied to — and he applied only to the top
five — accepted him. "I think I would have
been a terrible lawyer," he says. "Just been re
ally depressed in law school."
But other professional school admission
tests abounded. "Three months after the
LSAT there was the MCAT — no, the
GMAT," says Jacobs, searching his memory
for that happy time. "I just kind of looked at
he thing and said, 'Well, the GMAT looks eas
ier than the LSAT,' so I just sat down and took
it, and I was much more relaxed and I did
much better."
Eventually, Jacobs landed at Stanford
business school, sitting next to five other
journalists, an NBA basketball player, an
NHL hockey player and others, though he
wasn't sure where management would lead
him. "I thought there must be something
good coming from Stanford business school,
but I didn't know what. But I'm an oppor
tunist," he says.
Within nine months at the Farm, Jacobs
was making his first film, "Legal Tender,"
which dealt with business ethics. He raised
the money himself, calling corporations for
money. He spent most of his second year
making another film.
Management training certainly hasn't
been lost by the wayside for Jacobs. "The fact
is that we're in the entertainment business,"
he says. "There are people down the hall
from me who are artists — painters. They sit
in their studio and when they want to make a
painting they go out to the store and buy
paints and a canvas and that's all they need. I
need hundreds of thousands or millions of
dollars and that's means knowing something
about business."
"Nina" especially benefited from Jacobs'
mercantile training. It "taught me how to
raise money," he continues. "I couldn't have
made this film this way — I could have made
a $ 10,000 or $20,000 movie, but I made a big
ger film than that."
I never even wanted to direct
When asked what was most difficult about
making "Nina," Jacobs says that it was the
fundraising, a process which involved ap
proaching private sources and took the bet
ter part of a year—"Well, the script was pret
ty hard, too," he says, reconsidering, "and it's
difficult to get access to talent," he adds, real
izing the typical directorial problems.
Jacobs wrote "Nina" in four days — after
putting it off for nine months. "Of course I
didn't get started on it until about the last
month or so," he says. "I went through a lot
of scripts — in fact, I wrote the entire script
for 'SFO' before I wrote 'Nina.' I had to pro
crastinate — you know, put my albums in al
phabetical order, things like that."
"It's like the earth being void and without
form for many years, and then boom — a

lightning bolt strikes and it all makes sense.
"wUsually, what I do is jot down an idea
here, an idea there. When I have enough crit
ical mass I sit down and write the whole
thing. I'm always a littlesuspicious of it when
it comes out piece by piece — it really should
come out whole."
As for theme, Jacobs again says he shies
away from preconception: "I wasn't trying to
say anything; I was trying to reflect whatever
was going on in my mind at that time, and
just let these characters talk. I don't know
about other writers but when I start to con
sciously write things, it's usually my worst

entertainment hasn't brought in limousines
or Malibu real estate yet, and that "I've also
got one child and another one due in a
month and a half. I have to think about sup
porting a family too."
But Jacobs feels that unique visions can
survive, indeed thrive in Hollywood. "I
think a lot of people may succumb and do
what Hollywood wants, but those aren't
the ones that Hollywood wants. For years I
wrote screenplays I thought everybody
wanted. But that's not what people want
— they want something unique, some

thing they haven't seen before. I don't
think success equals compromising your
vision."
As examples, Jacobs cites the quirky yet
moneymaking visuals of Tim Burton, the
talky yet popular comedies of Woody Allen
and the squeaky-clean big budget grandios
ity of Steven Spielberg.
"And those people for the most part see
their movie come out the way they want," Ja
cobs says. "What I aspire to, I don't know
what that is yet. I don't know what that Alan
Jacobs movie is, or if there ever will be one
— maybe it'll be just a mishmash of different
things. But I think there's room to keep your
own voice — I think there's more than room
— I think those are the people who really
succeed."
But Jacobs nevertheless seems willing to
accept fortune or failure as they come, al
ways prepared to return to his center —
writing — whatever vagaries arise. Film
seems to be a pleasant side trail he's current
ly exploring.
"A lot of life is just circumstance and hap
penstance and accident," he says. "For me
the line that runs through it all, no matter
what the different circumstances are, is that
I'm just going to keep on writing. That's
what I love to do and what I do best. At this
point in my life I'm writing film. Once I
wrote journalism, maybe one day I'll write
novels. Or haiku." ■


Across the street from the Potrero po
lice station, by the Bay and nestled
among Asian wholesale food ware
houses, cocktail dives and hulking heavy in
dustry factories, lie the offices of Sharona
Productions: two rooms stocked with
screenplays, pirated videos — and Alan Ja
cobs, a film director who, though recently re
luctant to direct films at all, might be poised
to enter the upper stratum of American
moviemaking.
Lounging behind a small desk in a small
room with little else besides several bat
tered movie posters taped to the wall, Ja
cobs — a lean, sharp-featured 35-year-old
wearing a black Jewish Film Festival t-shirt
and blue jeans — seems in no hurry to
move upscale.
Not that change bothers him. His first
feature film, "Nina Takes A Lover," which
details the trysts of a young San Francisco
wife, came in third in the audience poll at
the Sundance Film Festival several weeks
ago, which in the industry is more than a
foot in the door — it's more like an arm, a
leg and some shoulder too.
That the auditors at Sundance decided to
accept "Nina" after initially rejecting it was
especially sweet, forcing Jacobs to gladly
cancel a vacation in Arizona and jet to the
yuppie ski slopes of Park City, Utah. And
now his latest venture — a comedy called
"SFO" — has been given the green light by
Zoetroppe, Francis Ford Coppola's studio,
and should be calling on big-name stars to
fill the leads.
All this from a man whose formal training
in film mainly consists of finance classes at
Stanford business school.
That's MBA. not MFA
"Sundance went very well," Jacobs says re
servedly. "We were very well received there.
It's really like a convention. Like any conven
tion, people come from all over who are in
the business to meet other people in the busi
ness, and what's being traded are the films.
Didn't seem like there were many people
there to enjoy a film festival, like the San
Francisco Film Festival." (Jacobs points out
that "Nina" will be showcased at the San
Francisco Film Festival this spring, so look
for it.)
Born in suburban Rockland County,
N.Y., Jacobs majored in English at Wesleyan
and never possessed even fleeting thoughts
of being a filmmaker. "When I was in col
lege, I really didn't like movies," he says. "I
didn't go because I was afraid that they
would give me a vicarious experience, and
then I wouldn't want to have the real experi
ence. Shows how twisted my head was."
After writing mostly non-fiction in col
lege, Jacobs became a journalist for a region
al newspaper in Hackensack, N.J. But after
six years, he began to feel constrained.
"It was very competitive to get a good job
in journalism," he says. "There's a lot of tal
ented writers, very few good jobs. And I also
started to feel limited by the truth."

Saying that he would have gone to the
Peace Corps as long as he broke new ground,
Jacobs, like other college educated, vocation
ally-disoriented youths, applied to law
school. But none of the five law schools he
applied to — and he applied only to the top
five — accepted him. "I think I would have
been a terrible lawyer," he says. "Just been re
ally depressed in law school."
But other professional school admission
tests abounded. "Three months after the
LSAT there was the MCAT — no, the
GMAT," says Jacobs, searching his memory
for that happy time. "I just kind of looked at
he thing and said, 'Well, the GMAT looks eas
ier than the LSAT,' so I just sat down and took
it, and I was much more relaxed and I did
much better."
Eventually, Jacobs landed at Stanford
business school, sitting next to five other
journalists, an NBA basketball player, an
NHL hockey player and others, though he
wasn't sure where management would lead
him. "I thought there must be something
good coming from Stanford business school,
but I didn't know what. But I'm an oppor
tunist," he says.
Within nine months at the Farm, Jacobs
was making his first film, "Legal Tender,"
which dealt with business ethics. He raised
the money himself, calling corporations for
money. He spent most of his second year
making another film.
Management training certainly hasn't
been lost by the wayside for Jacobs. "The fact
is that we're in the entertainment business,"
he says. "There are people down the hall
from me who are artists — painters. They sit
in their studio and when they want to make a
painting they go out to the store and buy
paints and a canvas and that's all they need. I
need hundreds of thousands or millions of
dollars and that's means knowing something
about business."
"Nina" especially benefited from Jacobs'
mercantile training. It "taught me how to
raise money," he continues. "I couldn't have
made this film this way — I could have made
a $ 10,000 or $20,000 movie, but I made a big
ger film than that."
I never even wanted to direct
When asked what was most difficult about
making "Nina," Jacobs says that it was the
fundraising, a process which involved ap
proaching private sources and took the bet
ter part of a year—"Well, the script was pret
ty hard, too," he says, reconsidering, "and it's
difficult to get access to talent," he adds, real
izing the typical directorial problems.
Jacobs wrote "Nina" in four days — after
putting it off for nine months. "Of course I
didn't get started on it until about the last
month or so," he says. "I went through a lot
of scripts — in fact, I wrote the entire script
for 'SFO' before I wrote 'Nina.' I had to pro
crastinate — you know, put my albums in al
phabetical order, things like that."
"It's like the earth being void and without
form for many years, and then boom — a

lightning bolt strikes and it all makes sense.
"wUsually, what I do is jot down an idea
here, an idea there. When I have enough crit
ical mass I sit down and write the whole
thing. I'm always a littlesuspicious of it when
it comes out piece by piece — it really should
come out whole."
As for theme, Jacobs again says he shies
away from preconception: "I wasn't trying to
say anything; I was trying to reflect whatever
was going on in my mind at that time, and
just let these characters talk. I don't know
about other writers but when I start to con
sciously write things, it's usually my worst
writing. When I just let it come out — I don't
know where it's coming from — that's usual
ly the best."
But Jacobs learned to trust his own in
stincts only after writing half a dozen screen
plays penned with the sole intention of mak
ing money. "1 heard you could get rich quick
by writing a screenplay and never tell the

truth once," he says.
"I had no interest in
film. I just wanted
to make money. I
never even wanted
to direct — I didn't
even want to direct
'Nina'."
But with "Nina"
the first script that
Jacobs wrote with
out commercial
considerations, he
realized he had to
direct it. "You have
no choice: if you
love the thing you
can't give it up, and
you learn how to
take care of it like a
parent."
Jacobs had dis
covered that the

screenplay is "an incomplete medium. It's
meant to be the plan and not meant to be the
end. What I say is that the screenwriter is the
genetic parent of the movie and the director
is the custodian or guardian. Sometimes it's
right to put the script up for adoption — a lot
of writers are not capable of directing, and I
didn't think I was for many years."
I u movies nre qnod
So Jacobs learned to direct by "making
mistakes and trying," never even thinking
about going to film school because he never
wanted to be a director anyway. As part of his
training, he's currently watching movies,
comedies especially, to prepare for "SFO,"
and they stack the shelves in one of the rooms
at Sharona Productions.
"I really enjoy B-movies because they're
bad and they're ftin and easy to watch. When
I watch a good movie it's very taxing because
I feel I have a lot to learn from it. So I like
watching bad movies, because you can learn
from them also. It's just more fun."
Jacobs admires Martin Scorsese and
Robert Altman — "consistently good film-

thought everybody wanted. Hut

something they haven t seen he
fore. 1 don t I h hi It success equals

makers who satisfy both critics and audi
ences" — and he himself would like his films
to be widely seen. "Ultimately we're making
entertainment," he says. "If we make people
reflect on their own lives a little differently
and move them and they're still thinking a
few days later, then it's a great success."
"The thing 1 have a hard time remember
ing and a lot of people have a hard time re
membering, is that it's just a movie," he says,
smiling.
i'ilm now, kailcu later ?
Now equally comfortable as director and
writer, Jacobs says "you can't separate them
in my mind." Flowever, he admits that "I
think I have much more talent writing — it's
the only thing I've done consistently since the
ninth grade."
Musing on his newfound status as a di
rector with a budding reputation among
the right circles, Jacobs says that much of

his good for
tune is simply
good luck and
exploited op
portunity.
"Once you
break through
and get the
chance to di
rect, it's sort of
like you're in

another league," he says. No longer consid
ered a first-timer, Jacobs says that "all I've
done is work for 24 days shooting a film.
Now let's say six months of shooting, and
I'm considered 'experienced,' and I'm set
apart from all the others who haven't done
one. That's the big jump. And if you break
through that barrier, you're lucky."
Do the temptations of Hollywood's mil
lions of dollars threaten to dilute Jacobs
artistic vision? "Nina" — a talky film that
meanders over the subject of marital infi
delity and the possibility of preserving pas
sion for a lifetime — probably won't ap
peal to the "Ace Ventura, Pet Detective"
crowd.
Jacobs isn't worried. He isn't packing up
for Studio City or Hollywood, and he says "I
hope to keep on making the films I want to
make." At the same time, he also realizes that
entertainment hasn't brought in limousines
or Malibu real estate yet, and that "I've also
got one child and another one due in a
month and a half. I have to think about sup
porting a family too."
But Jacobs feels that unique visions can
survive, indeed thrive in Hollywood. "I
think a lot of people may succumb and do
what Hollywood wants, but those aren't
the ones that Hollywood wants. For years I
wrote screenplays I thought everybody
wanted. But that's not what people want
— they want something unique, some

thing they haven't seen before. I don't

moneymaking visuals of Tim Burton, the
talky yet popular comedies of Woody Allen

ity of Steven Spielberg.
"And those people for the most part see
their movie come out the way they want," Ja
