# A 						slow ride through Italy
## 'Fiorile' chronicles a family curse — and takes it time 
### 
Artfully and strategically crafted, "Fiorile"
weaves the past and present stories of the
Benedetti family. As the young, present-day
Benedetti family drives to the place of their
ancestors to visit the ailing Grandpa
Benedetti, the legend of the Benedetti curse
unfolds.
The father Benedetti reveals the origin of
Benedetti family fortune which arose from a
stolen chest of gold during the Napoleonic
occupation of Tuscany. It is this stolen
money which has cursed the family
throughout the ages. While these 1990s
Benedettis drive through the countryside,
the two children become preoccupied with
the legend and eagerly listen to the history of
how the Benedettis became known as the
"Maladettis" (which in Italian means "the
cursed").
Thus, "Fiorile" guides the audience in a
car ride back to a quaint village as well as
back in time through the Napoleonic era,
the early 20th century and World War 11.
Throughout the film, the directors, Paolo
and Vittorio Taviani, employ innovative
techniques to link the stories of the "ac
cursed family." The concept of renewal,
manifest in the term "Fiorile" (which means
"to bloom or flower" in Italian and which is
the French Revolution's calendar name for
the month of May), appears most obviously
in the use of same actors for different char
acters of different eras.
Galatea Ranzi, who plays the lovetorn
peasant girl Elisabetta Benedetti, reappears
a little over a century later as Elisa Benedet
ti, the sister deceived in love by her schem
ing brother. That Ranzi plays both charac
ters links age to age and highlights the non
discrimintating nature of the curse, despite

the fact that the two female Benedettis are
very different individuals.
The arrival of the traveling Benedetti
family at the Benedetti house subsequently
marks the end of the storytelling and the be
ginning of the confrontation between myth
and reality, old and young. In a sort of show
down between the two children and the
grandfather, the Film tries to address the va
lidity of the grandfather's statement: "Leg
ends aren't legends — they're real."
This episode which capitalizes on the
fears and hopes of the two children and the
headstrong, disgruntled grandfather does
no more than titillate the senses and perhaps
captures the whole tone of the movie: (s)low
intensity. The long series of flashbacks which
beautifully depict the various periods during
which the Benedettis suffer from the curse
appear a little overdone and extravagant and
the idea that the curse may still affect the
family remain underdeveloped.
In short, this movie lacks in the fact that
... well, if it weren't a foreign film, "Fiorile"
would not be worth seeing. This film has all
the necessary ingredients which make for
eign film-going entertaining: renowned di
rectors, great cinematography, handsome
protagonists, adorable and innocent child
actors, intriguing family history, tales of un
requited love ... and to top it all off, the
mellifluent Italian language. In other words,
these ingredients obscure the over-senti
mentality and slowness of "Fiorile."
Nevertheless, my advice, unless you re
quire self-affirmation in your cultured
foreign film ways and/or a good dose of
cuteness, is to wait for the video to come
out.
