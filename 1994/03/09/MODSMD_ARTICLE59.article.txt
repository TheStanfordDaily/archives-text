## Guarding Tess 
### 
It is hard to pinpoint exactly what goes
wrong with director Hugh Wilson's "Guard
ing Tess." The film isn't that horrendous —
the acting is average, and the story is semi
believable.
Maybe that's the problem. At least bad
movies are engrossing in their own special
way. "Guarding Tess" never even achieves
entertainment status.
As a former first lady, Tess Carlisle

(Shirley MacLaine)
is revered by the
public but loathed
by those who know
her privately. One of
these few is Special
Agent Doug Ches
nic (Nicolas Cage)
who has been sent to
guard Tess in her re
tirement. Described
by Chesnic as the
"worst assignment
in the Secret Ser
vice," it is clear the
two aren't best
friends. While

Carlisle thrives on ordering Chesnic around,
the agent stands up to her torments while at
tempting to do his job "by the book."
MacLaine suffices as the abrasive Tess
Carlisle. While Cage is adequate as Chesnic,
it is a challenge to watch him play the
straight-laced agent without expecting (and
hoping) him to break into one of his off-beat,
eccentric character types (as in "Raising Ari
zona" and "Wild at Heart"). Neither Cage
nor MacLaine goes beyond sufficient —
their performances are uninspiring and un
exceptional. As a result, the audience never
connects with the characters and is ambiva
lent as to what happens to them.
For the first 45 minutes, "Guarding Tess"
lives up to its comedic label. The duel of wills
between Chesnic and Carlisle allow for some
laughs. Especially original are the scenes
where the President himself calls Chesnic,
demanding that he take better care of Tess.
But their interaction gets stale fast. It
seems as if Wilson too realized that the story
was going nowhere. Out of the blue, Tess is
kidnapped. For the last half hour we have an
action/mystery/horror film as the agents
search for Tess. Because the two short, dis
jointed "movies" don't fuse, the second half
seems tacked on in an attempt to breathe life
into a dying movie.
