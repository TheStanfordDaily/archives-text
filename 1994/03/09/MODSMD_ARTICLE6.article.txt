# Res Ed at a crucial crossroads
## Program tries to look ahead despite budget cuts, staff loss

Is the catfish God's most ignoble
creature?
Stanford's Residential Education
program has always been a little rene
gade, so it was no surprise in the 1980s
when a large crowd turned out to see
Branner Resident Fellow Kennell Jack
son and former Soto RF John Perry de
bate the merits of whiskered bottom
feeders. But while the topic appeared
frivolous, the intellectual discussion it
provoked on campus was anything but

light-hearted.
"People were talking about that for
weeks," says James Lyons, dean of stu
dent affairs from 1972-1990.
While discussions of catfish have
given way to programs on social issues,
Res Ed remains on a different path
than its counterparts at other universi
ties. While students at Harvard and
Yale live out their undergraduate years
in "houses" or "colleges" each with its
own coat of arms and china pattern,
Stanford students shuffle between
freshman dorms, vegetarian co-ops,
ethnic theme houses like Okada and

"focus houses" on everything from
human biology to international rela
tions.
Over the organization's 20 years,
some have questioned the clarity of its
educational mission and the objectives
of its programs, but Res Ed has never
theless become a veritable campus in
stitution. As Res Ed moves into its
third decade, however, many people say
the program is at a crucial point in its
history.
Within the past several years, the
two people who essentially creat
ed Res Ed — former directors
Alice Supton and Norm Robinson
— have left Stanford. Over a four
year period, 30 percent of the pro
gram's budget has been sliced.
And it is unclear whether Res Ed
has fully recovered from accusa
tions in the late 1980s that it had
a "hidden, liberal agenda" that
was "shoving multiculturalism
down students' throats."
Now, more budget cuts loom
on the horizon for Res Ed. Sub
committees of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education and
the Faculty Senate are examining
the program. In January, it was
announced that Res Ed will be
grouped administratively with
Housing and Dining Services, a
move that provoked consterna
tion among resident fellows and
prompted them to suggest alter
native structures.
"Res Ed is at a crossroads,"
says Muwekma-Tah-Ruk Resi
dent Fellow Andrew Lisac, assis
tant dean of continuing studies.
"It needs to be reconceptualized,
reinvigorated. I'd love to decon
struct the whole thing and see a
really broad-based re-examina
tion."
'Understanding the history'
To prepare Res Ed for the
future, those close to the organi
zation say it's important to look
at how and why Res Ed developed
the way it did.
"We've lost our institutional
memory now," says Lyons. "We
don't have the people here to
understand the history, and
that's critical."
While administrative turnover
has been high in the last several
years, many people with histori
cal perspectives — such as Lyons,
Robinson, History Prof. Mark
Mancall and Anthropology Prof.
James Gibbs — still lurk in the
nooks and crannies of Stanford.
In the eyes of Lyons, who came
to Stanford in the early '70s, Res
Ed was forged in the crucible of

'Res Ed is not about
putting one section
of your seminar into
558 (Mayfield). It's
about giving people
responsibility, giv
ing them the chance
to interact and learn
from each other.'

turbulent national and local
events of the 19605.
"We were coming out of some
really rough times at Stanford —
the burning of Encina (Hall) and
the anti-war rallies," says Lyons.
"I think it was an invigorating
time that caused people to re
examine what Stanford was
doing."
Some of that re-examination
came formally, in the 1968 Study
of Education at Stanford — simi
lar to today's Commission on
Undergraduate Education. That
report recommended residences
which were integrated across
class years; coeducational and sin
gle-sex residences; and the devel
opment of academic and thematic
houses "affording optimal oppor
tunities."
But much re-examination was
prompted by the circumstances of
the times, including the dwin
dling interest in fraternities, the
national move away from in loco
parentis, increasing interest in co
education, the civil rights move
ment and the war in Vietnam,
recalls Lyons.
As fraternity membership
dropped off and their houses were
vacated, the University was
forced to consider what to do with
the buildings, says Lyons. In addi
tion, many Stanford students
were taking advantage of overseas
studies — which were co-ed since
their inception in 1958 — and
returned to campus dissatisfied
with segregated housing.
As more housing opened up,
the University was faced with a
dilemma: should it be standard
ized, even though the facilities
were very different, or should a
variety of living arrangements be
provided?
"I and others realized early on
that Stanford would not take
comfortably to a standardized sit
uation," said Lyons.
In 1967, Stanford's first real
attempt at innovative housing
came when the Phi Delta Theta
fraternity was kicked off campus
for the year. Forced to leave their
house in December 1966, Mancall

'I don't think the
decision makers in
the administration
have enough experi
ence with Res Ed. If
you're not on the
front line, how can
you understand it?'
— Mark Mancall

organized a group of 31 male and
12 female students to move into
the house winter quarter.
Renamed "Grove House," the res
idence was organized around the
idea of "development" and stu
dents took small seminars in the
house. (See related story)
By 1968, several such "experi
mental" houses had cropped up
on campus, and residences
became co-educational "like domi
noes" says Robinson.
Co-operative houses such as
Columbae (a "non-violent protest
house"), Synergy (an "alternative
lifestyle house") and Terra (the
"ecology" house) soon sprouted
from the counterculture move
ment, recalls Robinson. And while
there were a few that failed —
Lyons remembers an "androgy
nous" house that folded a r ter a
year — most have continued until
this day.
Theme houses grew out of the
co-ops. La Maison Francaise was
the first "academic" theme house.
It was followed by La Casa Ital
iana in 1976, Haus Mitteleuropa
in 1978, American Studies and
EAST House. While some depart
ments tried to make these houses
into "departmental parlors,"
Lyons said, "We had to get them
to realize that these places were
first and foremost students'
homes."
Ethnic theme houses originat
ed slightly earlier, on the heels of
the civil rights movement in the
late '60s and early '70s. Following
months of pressure by members
of the Black Student Union and
supporting administrators and
faculty, Cedro was designated the
"Black Concentration House" in
1969.
The house represented a major
coup for black students, who had
sought a sense of community and
gathering place. At the time, only
1 percent of the student popula
tion was black. While the Univer
sity was somewhat skeptical of
the house, "it just worked out
beautifully," Psychiatry Prof.
William Dement, the house's first
resident fellow, said on the 20th
anniversary of the house.
In developing its cadre of resi
dence programs, "one of the
things we wanted to create was —
in what can be a very impersonal,
cool University — a sense of car
ing and inclusiveness," says
Lyons.
The Chicano theme house
came along in 1970, located first
in Roble and later in Stern. In
1972 it settled in its current loca
tion and in 1973 it was dubbed
"Casa Zapata." Asian-American
and Native American house pro
grams began in 1971.
By 1973, "Res Ed" was official
lingo, and the program was on its
way to national recognition.
Days of glory and grief
The '80s ushered in what some
might call the "golden era" of Res
Ed. A favorable economic climate
allowed the construction of Gov
ernor's Corner which included
Sterling Quad and the Suites, cre
ating 800 new housing spaces to
the tune of $36 million. More stu
dents than ever were living on
campus, and expanding budgets
allowed for more staff, more pro
grams and the addition of focus
houses on such topics as gender
and Human Biology.
"There was a period of time, in
the mid-'Bos, when we were able
to add positions like the multicul
tural educator, and resident fel
lows had significantly more
funds," remembers Supton. "In
retrospect, that was a high point
for Res Ed.

"The money was enabling. The
central staff was able to create
programs, .. . bring in speakers,
filmmakers, musicians, authors. .
. . We could create a set of activi
ties and the residence staff could
schedule them."
But while the '80s brought
more resources, they also brought
challenges — one of the most sig
nificant being a ever-more diverse
student body. Increasingly, says
Lyons, Res Ed was looking to pro
mote understanding of a whole
host of issues related to diversity,
including race, religion, sexual
orientation and class.
In his 1988 welcoming address,
former University President Don
ald Kennedy told freshmen: "In
residential education and else
where at Stanford, racial under
standing has properly become a
powerful theme. It is important
for you to acknowledge that
theme and to recognize it as an
integral part of the education you
will receive here, not as some
extracurricular sideshow."
As early as 1987 and 1988, Res
Ed began to draw criticism, as
some students claimed that the
system, in trying to promote
"inclusiveness and open-minded
ness," it was itself closed-minded.
They claimed the Res Ed staff had
a hidden, pro-liberal agenda.
Not really, say some in the sys
tem. "The 'Res Ed agenda' pre
sumes a far greater central orga
nization than ever existed," says
German Prof. Rob Robinson, a
former RF in Roble. Others say
there was an "agenda" to a degree
— an agenda of which they were
proud.
"There was an agenda, in the
sense that there was an agenda of
humanity,... of including all peo
ple for who they were," says Sup
ton. "To the extent that programs
offered a chance to explore simi
larities and differences, I think
that was good.
"If you were encountering the
ideas for the first time, you may
have felt imposed upon."
"Under Donald Kennedy, there
was a huge commitment to diver
sity," says Lyons. "But we spent
so much time doing that, we for
got to turn a mirror on ourselves
and ask 'What kind of a commu
nity do we have here?'
"UCMI did that, and suddenly
we faced a humongous task," says
Lyons. Yet as 1989's report from
the University Committee on
Minority Issues put a formal spot
light on multicultural issues and
recommended more programs,
activities and policy changes, the
same year also brought what
many people have pointed to as
the event that catalyzed "the mul
ticultural backlash:" a speech by
student Ingrid Nava at "The Fire
Within," a freshman Orientation
program, in which she implored
the audience to work for change
in the University.
While many felt Nava crystal
lized the passion and politics of
Stanford's multicultural move
ment, at the same time she
turned off a large number of stu
dents — freshmen and otherwise
— to a movement that had fre
quently challenged the status quo
through dramatic actions and
confrontational rhetoric.
"Some people experienced [The
Fire Within] as hard to hear,"
says Supton. It was a "voice of
alienation, . . . the espousement
of ideas they found challenging,
or accusatory, in some cases."
"The reaction, from that time
on was, 'You're trying to stuff it
down our throats,' " says Lyons.
"I don't think we were trying to
stuff it down throats. I think we

It boils down to
who's on top. Do
you put the
greenskeeper in
charge of the foot
ball coach, or vice
versa?'

were trying to keep some impor
tant issues front and center."
Others say the backlash
stemmed not so much from what
Res Ed tried to do as how it tried
to do it.
"It was sometimes based on
blame and guilt, and that's not
productive," says Larkin Resident
Fellow Sue Harvey.
"I think [educating about
diversity] was a worthwhile goal,"
says Gibbs. "They probably
should've talked less about what
they were doing and simply done
it."
Whether Res Ed — its staff and
its reputation — has fully recov
ered from the backlash is unclear.
"Res Ed tried to understand
what was making people feel
excluded," says Supton. "Because
our goal was to find a place for
everyone. . . . Times changed,
people changed and I think we
recovered."
"There's been an attempt to
move away" from events and
activities that contributed to the
backlash, says Harvey. But other
assaults — budget cuts, Supton's
decision to reduce her position to
half-time, her subsequent depar
ture and other reorganizational
moves put Res Ed essentially in a
continual position of defense and
reaction.
"I think we need to go into a
proactive mode," says Harvey.
A call for action
Ironically, it was yet another
perceived "assault" that has
renewed the call for a thorough
re-examination of Res Ed.
In January, Vice Provost and
Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds announced Res Ed
would be resituated in a unit
headed by Director of Housing
and Dining Services Keith Guy.
Edmonds insists that Res Ed is
not "under" Housing and Dining
Services in the new configuration,
"all the parties are at the table
together planning, having their
views known, working together to
make the residential experience
the best possible."

The discussion has
focused too much
on names and titles,
without a public dis
cussion of the goals
and objectives of
Res Ed.'
— Norm Robinson

But RFs feel the move symbol
izes "a demotion of Reu Ed in the
eyes of the University," says Rob
Robinson.
"It boils down to who's on top,"
says Lyons. "Do you put the
greenskeeper in charge of the
football coach, or vice versa?"
Under Edmonds' proposal, a
half-time faculty dean of Residen
tial Education would oversee the
academic activities conducted in
student residences, such as dorm
based courses, while "round-the
clock" residential services would
report to Guy.
While critical of its vagueness,
many people have acclaimed the
deanship idea — even to the point
of envisioning a significantly
greater role for such a person in
an administrative structure radi
cally different from Edmond's
plan.
Calling the deanship an "excel
lent idea," Perry said having a
faculty member leading Res Ed
would keep the organization in
touch with the "academic values"
of Stanford. If the dean headed up
the entire organization and it
reported directly to the provost,
so much the better, he says.
"I'd like to see Res Ed brought
under an academic dean not
because I think [residences]
should become more like class
rooms, but because that person
could take a broad-based view" of
the program, says Mancall, a for
mer resident fellow in Arroyo and
Florence Moore Hall.
Others believe having a faculty
member lead Res Ed would give
the organization more legitimacy,
more stature and could bolster
efforts to recruit more faculty to
serve as resident fellows.
"Having faculty leadership
within Res Ed could be extremely
healthy," says Supton.
Perry said he can envision mul
tifarious roles for a faculty dean
of Res Ed, from lending Res Ed a
more "departmental" sense to
improving departmental recogni
tion of faculty who serve as resi
dent fellows. Most importantly,




though, Perry sees the dean as
someone who would be an "advo
cate" for undergraduates and who
would keep the president and
provost abreast of what is happen
ing in the residences.
And while enthusiasm is run
ning high for the post, many orga
nizational and staffing factors
must still be resolved — would
there be a dean and a director? If
so, would there be a philosophical
divide between the program's aca
demic and non-academic func
tions?
"To play the intellectual leader
ship role successfully, you have to
be working with students at all lev
els," says Supton, who noted that
Stanford's approach to students in
residences has traditionally more
integrated than that of Harvard or
Yale.
According to Supton, it may be
difficult to "cut off the heads of
RFs above the ears" and say that
on academic matters, fellows
"relate to this person over here,
but on everything else — drinking.
.. homophobic remarks ... those
things belong somewhere else."
"I do worry about a program
that is supposed to be integrated —
splitting up the organization," says
Norm Robinson. "It weakens the
program the more split and diffuse
the responsibility is."
Finances, too, may be an issue.
Some question whether the dean
ship might cost the program more
money, and wonder whether is it
the best place to allocate money in
a time of tight budgets.
"Certainly, the best place to put
the money is in the residences,"
says Harvey. "I wouldn't like to see
a dean's salary come at the expense
of RF programming funds."
Despite the enthusiasm for

organizational tinkering, many feel
that the recent emphasis on new
positions and administrative
restructuring has put the prover
bial cart before the horse.
"The discussion has focused too
much on names and titles, without
a public discussion of the goals and
objectives of Res Ed," says Norm
Robinson.
"The question we shouldn't be
asking is, 'Is this administratively
more efficient?' " says Harvey.
"The question is, 'Is this the best
and most effective way to meet stu
dents' needs?' "

All the parties are at
the table together
planning, having
their views known,
working together to
make the residential
experience the best
possible.'

Toward the future
One group asking those questions
is CUE's subcommittee on aca
demic environment, which is look
ing into Res Ed's academic and
intellectual aspects — such as
dorm-based courses, intellectual
programming, focus houses and
theme houses.
While applauding the attention,
those close to Res Ed say it has
always been difficult to nail down

the "Ed" sense of the organization.
"In some senses, it's vague,
because there is no formal curricu
lum and it's not a discipline," says
Norm Robinson.
Senior Seema Jain, a resident
assistant in Roble, agrees.
"It is ambiguous," says Jain.
"What a lot of people associate with
the 'Ed' is programming, but that's
not what I see as the main thing.
What 'Ed' is depends a lot on your
RA. Every RA is different."
But while the "Ed" may be hard
to sort out, a clearer notion of what
the "Ed" aspect is would give the

program more direction, some say.
"I never really understood what
the academic thrust of Res Ed was,
and I'm not sure, as Res Ed devel
oped, it ever really has thought
about the effects of theme houses,"
says Man call. "It's an institution
searching for a mission.
"I think they never really fig
ured out the role of resident fel
lows," he adds, lamenting that
unlike at Harvard, it is not consid
ered a major honor to be a resident

fellow at Stanford.
"Eventually, I think what hap
pened is that Res Ed became a vest
ed interest in itself," says Man call.
"Although the University said it
eschewed it, Res Ed itself became
in loco parentis.
"Educating people about
racism, sexism. .. became the rai
son d'etre of Res Ed."
Last Thursday, a town hall
meeting on Res Ed and advising
was held in Kimball to solicit stu
dent input, and the subcommittee
has begun meeting with resident
fellows, resident assistants and
others, says CUE member A 1
Camarillo, associate dean of
humanities and sciences.
The subcommittee is also exam
ining responses to senior surveys
and last quarter's Res Ed survey,
and is in the process of formulating
a few more questions which will be
part of a special CUE survey to be
administered before the end of the
year. Focus groups are also being
employed to study Res Ed, Camar
illo said.
While CUE examines the intel
lectual aspects, the Faculty Sen
ate's Subcommittee on Residential
Education and Advising has began
its study of other aspects of Res Ed
— including its student support
functions, its attempt to create a
"pluralistic community," its facili
tation of leadership and responsibil
ity among students. In addition,
SREA will also reconsider the orga
nizational structure of the pro
gram.
Although appearing to work
quite separately, SREA and CUE
are coordinating their efforts, says
Camarillo, who sits on both. SREA
is expected to report directly to the
commission, which is to issue its
report in the fall. How the report
will fit with Edmonds' reorganiza
tion is unclear, but she says her

unit will "have the organizational
flexibility to deal with any recom
mendations from CUE."
While no one is certain what the
examination of Res Ed's funda
mentals will produce, any recom
mendations will have to be crafted
with the knowledge that funding
will be increasingly limited.
With its budget pared down to
$3 million, from more than $4 mil
lion in the 1980s, Res Ed has had to
reduce central office staff, the
number of RAs in residences, RA
salaries and program funds.
According to Acting Residential
Education Co-director Ann Por
teus, student housing, which has a
budget of about $50 million, must
cut about $1 million in this round
of budget cuts. How much of that
will come from Res Ed is undecid
ed, but it is certain to force an even
harder look at what the program
does — especially with regard to
education.
One critical function Res Ed
might play, speculates Harvey,
involves the increasing role of com
puters and other technology in
education at Stanford.
"Technology could make the
residences the real academic cen
ters." says Harvey. "A strong Res
Ed could really help facilitate
that."
As education becomes more and
more expensive — and if Stanford
maintains its commitment to need
blind admissions — Res Ed may
have an even greater role as an
"equalizing force" between stu
dents through its subsidizes of stu
dent programs and activities, says
Perry.
Man call says it is also necessary
to examine whether to integrate
graduate students and undergrad
uates, and also to look at the lack of
integration of foreign graduate stu
dents into the larger population.

Others hope that Res Ed can
simply refine what is has done in
the past. "I always felt that small
er, upperclass houses, with RFs
were probably ideal," says Supton.
"Of course, with budget cuts, it's
hard to afford this, but I think that
beyond the acclimation year, peo
ple may be in a really good position
to benefit from interaction with
faculty."
Although aspirations for the
future are running high, ominous
budget forecasts and fears that
high-level administrators don't
understand Res Ed are tempering
optimism that the program can be
revitalized for the '90s and beyond.
"I don't think the decision mak
ers in the administration have
enough experience with Res Ed,"
says Mancall. "If you're not on the
front line, how can you understand
it? ... They must get closer to the
thing about which they are trying
to make decisions."
And as Res Ed goes under
numerous campus microscopes,
many caution that the scrutiny
must not assume too limited a view
of the possible functions and roles
of the organization.
"Res Ed is not about putting one
section of your seminar into 558
(Mayfield) — although the more of
that the better. ... It's about giv
ing people responsibility, giving
them the chance to interact and
learn from each other," says
Kennedy.
"The temptation is to examine
curricular issues, but improving
undergraduate education involves
much more, especially improving
the quality of teaching and sharp
ening departmental accountability
for it."
"We shouldn't define education
too narrowly," says Rob Robinson.
"We're educating students about
being human in modern society."

mental" houses had cropped up
on campus, and residences
became co-educational "like domi
noes" says Robinson.
Co-operative houses such as
Columbae (a "non-violent protest
house"), Synergy (an "alternative
lifestyle house") and Terra (the
"ecology" house) soon sprouted
from the counterculture move
ment, recalls Robinson. And while
there were a few that failed —
Lyons remembers an "androgy
nous" house that folded a r ter a
year — most have continued until
this day.
Theme houses grew out of the
co-ops. La Maison Francaise was
the first "academic" theme house.
It was followed by La Casa Ital
iana in 1976, Haus Mitteleuropa
in 1978, American Studies and
EAST House. While some depart
ments tried to make these houses
into "departmental parlors,"
Lyons said, "We had to get them
to realize that these places were
first and foremost students'
homes."
Ethnic theme houses originat
ed slightly earlier, on the heels of
the civil rights movement in the
late '60s and early '70s. Following
months of pressure by members
of the Black Student Union and
supporting administrators and
faculty, Cedro was designated the
"Black Concentration House" in
1969.
The house represented a major
coup for black students, who had
sought a sense of community and
gathering place. At the time, only
1 percent of the student popula
tion was black. While the Univer
sity was somewhat skeptical of
the house, "it just worked out
beautifully," Psychiatry Prof.
William Dement, the house's first
resident fellow, said on the 20th
anniversary of the house.
In developing its cadre of resi
dence programs, "one of the
things we wanted to create was —
in what can be a very impersonal,
cool University — a sense of car
ing and inclusiveness," says
Lyons.
The Chicano theme house
came along in 1970, located first
in Roble and later in Stern. In
1972 it settled in its current loca
tion and in 1973 it was dubbed
"Casa Zapata." Asian-American
and Native American house pro
grams began in 1971.
By 1973, "Res Ed" was official
lingo, and the program was on its
way to national recognition.
Days of glory and grief
The '80s ushered in what some
might call the "golden era" of Res
Ed. A favorable economic climate
allowed the construction of Gov
ernor's Corner which included
Sterling Quad and the Suites, cre
ating 800 new housing spaces to
the tune of $36 million. More stu
dents than ever were living on
campus, and expanding budgets
allowed for more staff, more pro
grams and the addition of focus
houses on such topics as gender
and Human Biology.
"There was a period of time, in
the mid-'Bos, when we were able
to add positions like the multicul
tural educator, and resident fel
lows had significantly more
funds," remembers Supton. "In
retrospect, that was a high point
for Res Ed.

"The money was enabling. The
central staff was able to create
programs, .. . bring in speakers,
filmmakers, musicians, authors. .
. . We could create a set of activi
ties and the residence staff could
schedule them."
But while the '80s brought
more resources, they also brought
challenges — one of the most sig
nificant being a ever-more diverse
student body. Increasingly, says
Lyons, Res Ed was looking to pro
mote understanding of a whole
host of issues related to diversity,
including race, religion, sexual
orientation and class.
In his 1988 welcoming address,
former University President Don
ald Kennedy told freshmen: "In
residential education and else
where at Stanford, racial under
standing has properly become a
powerful theme. It is important
for you to acknowledge that
theme and to recognize it as an
integral part of the education you
will receive here, not as some
extracurricular sideshow."
As early as 1987 and 1988, Res
Ed began to draw criticism, as
some students claimed that the
system, in trying to promote
"inclusiveness and open-minded
ness," it was itself closed-minded.
They claimed the Res Ed staff had
a hidden, pro-liberal agenda.
Not really, say some in the sys
tem. "The 'Res Ed agenda' pre
sumes a far greater central orga
nization than ever existed," says
German Prof. Rob Robinson, a
former RF in Roble. Others say
there was an "agenda" to a degree
— an agenda of which they were
proud.
"There was an agenda, in the
sense that there was an agenda of
humanity,... of including all peo
ple for who they were," says Sup
ton. "To the extent that programs
offered a chance to explore simi
larities and differences, I think
that was good.
"If you were encountering the
ideas for the first time, you may
have felt imposed upon."
"Under Donald Kennedy, there
was a huge commitment to diver
sity," says Lyons. "But we spent
so much time doing that, we for
got to turn a mirror on ourselves
and ask 'What kind of a commu
nity do we have here?'
"UCMI did that, and suddenly
we faced a humongous task," says
Lyons. Yet as 1989's report from
the University Committee on
Minority Issues put a formal spot
light on multicultural issues and
recommended more programs,
activities and policy changes, the
same year also brought what
many people have pointed to as
the event that catalyzed "the mul
ticultural backlash:" a speech by
student Ingrid Nava at "The Fire
Within," a freshman Orientation
program, in which she implored
the audience to work for change
in the University.
While many felt Nava crystal
lized the passion and politics of
Stanford's multicultural move
ment, at the same time she
turned off a large number of stu
dents — freshmen and otherwise
— to a movement that had fre
quently challenged the status quo
through dramatic actions and
confrontational rhetoric.
"Some people experienced [The
Fire Within] as hard to hear,"
says Supton. It was a "voice of
alienation, . . . the espousement
of ideas they found challenging,
or accusatory, in some cases."
"The reaction, from that time
on was, 'You're trying to stuff it
down our throats,' " says Lyons.
"I don't think we were trying to
stuff it down throats. I think we

It boils down to
who's on top. Do
you put the
greenskeeper in
charge of the foot
ball coach, or vice
versa?'
— James Lyons

were trying to keep some impor
tant issues front and center."
Others say the backlash
stemmed not so much from what
Res Ed tried to do as how it tried
to do it.
"It was sometimes based on
blame and guilt, and that's not
productive," says Larkin Resident
Fellow Sue Harvey.
"I think [educating about
diversity] was a worthwhile goal,"
says Gibbs. "They probably
should've talked less about what
they were doing and simply done
it."
Whether Res Ed — its staff and
its reputation — has fully recov
ered from the backlash is unclear.
"Res Ed tried to understand
what was making people feel
excluded," says Supton. "Because
our goal was to find a place for
everyone. . . . Times changed,
people changed and I think we
recovered."
"There's been an attempt to
move away" from events and
activities that contributed to the
backlash, says Harvey. But other
assaults — budget cuts, Supton's
decision to reduce her position to
half-time, her subsequent depar
ture and other reorganizational
moves put Res Ed essentially in a
continual position of defense and
reaction.
"I think we need to go into a
proactive mode," says Harvey.
A call for action
Ironically, it was yet another
perceived "assault" that has
renewed the call for a thorough
re-examination of Res Ed.
In January, Vice Provost and
Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds announced Res Ed
would be resituated in a unit
headed by Director of Housing
and Dining Services Keith Guy.
Edmonds insists that Res Ed is
not "under" Housing and Dining
Services in the new configuration,
"all the parties are at the table
together planning, having their
views known, working together to
make the residential experience
the best possible."

The discussion has
focused too much
on names and titles,
without a public dis
cussion of the goals
and objectives of
Res Ed.'
— Norm Robinson

But RFs feel the move symbol
izes "a demotion of Reu Ed in the
eyes of the University," says Rob
Robinson.
"It boils down to who's on top,"
says Lyons. "Do you put the
greenskeeper in charge of the
football coach, or vice versa?"
Under Edmonds' proposal, a
half-time faculty dean of Residen
tial Education would oversee the
academic activities conducted in
student residences, such as dorm
based courses, while "round-the
clock" residential services would
report to Guy.
While critical of its vagueness,
many people have acclaimed the
deanship idea — even to the point
of envisioning a significantly
greater role for such a person in
an administrative structure radi
cally different from Edmond's
plan.
Calling the deanship an "excel
lent idea," Perry said having a
faculty member leading Res Ed
would keep the organization in
touch with the "academic values"
of Stanford. If the dean headed up
the entire organization and it
reported directly to the provost,
so much the better, he says.
"I'd like to see Res Ed brought
under an academic dean not
because I think [residences]
should become more like class
rooms, but because that person
could take a broad-based view" of
the program, says Mancall, a for
mer resident fellow in Arroyo and
Florence Moore Hall.
Others believe having a faculty
member lead Res Ed would give
the organization more legitimacy,
more stature and could bolster
efforts to recruit more faculty to
serve as resident fellows.
"Having faculty leadership
within Res Ed could be extremely
healthy," says Supton.
Perry said he can envision mul
tifarious roles for a faculty dean
of Res Ed, from lending Res Ed a
more "departmental" sense to
improving departmental recogni
tion of faculty who serve as resi
dent fellows. Most importantly,




though, Perry sees the dean as
someone who would be an "advo
cate" for undergraduates and who
would keep the president and
provost abreast of what is happen
ing in the residences.
And while enthusiasm is run
ning high for the post, many orga
nizational and staffing factors
must still be resolved — would
there be a dean and a director? If
so, would there be a philosophical
divide between the program's aca
demic and non-academic func
tions?
"To play the intellectual leader
ship role successfully, you have to
be working with students at all lev
els," says Supton, who noted that
Stanford's approach to students in
residences has traditionally more
integrated than that of Harvard or
Yale.
According to Supton, it may be
difficult to "cut off the heads of
RFs above the ears" and say that
on academic matters, fellows
"relate to this person over here,
but on everything else — drinking.
.. homophobic remarks ... those
things belong somewhere else."
"I do worry about a program
that is supposed to be integrated —
splitting up the organization," says
Norm Robinson. "It weakens the
program the more split and diffuse
the responsibility is."
Finances, too, may be an issue.
Some question whether the dean
ship might cost the program more
money, and wonder whether is it
the best place to allocate money in
a time of tight budgets.
"Certainly, the best place to put
the money is in the residences,"
says Harvey. "I wouldn't like to see
a dean's salary come at the expense
of RF programming funds."
Despite the enthusiasm for

organizational tinkering, many feel
that the recent emphasis on new
positions and administrative
restructuring has put the prover
bial cart before the horse.
"The discussion has focused too
much on names and titles, without
a public discussion of the goals and
objectives of Res Ed," says Norm
Robinson.
"The question we shouldn't be
asking is, 'Is this administratively
more efficient?' " says Harvey.
"The question is, 'Is this the best
and most effective way to meet stu
dents' needs?' "

All the parties are at
the table together
planning, having
their views known,
working together to
make the residential
experience the best
possible.'
— Mary Edmonds

Toward the future
One group asking those questions
is CUE's subcommittee on aca
demic environment, which is look
ing into Res Ed's academic and
intellectual aspects — such as
dorm-based courses, intellectual
programming, focus houses and
theme houses.
While applauding the attention,
those close to Res Ed say it has
always been difficult to nail down

the "Ed" sense of the organization.
"In some senses, it's vague,
because there is no formal curricu
lum and it's not a discipline," says
Norm Robinson.
Senior Seema Jain, a resident
assistant in Roble, agrees.
"It is ambiguous," says Jain.
"What a lot of people associate with
the 'Ed' is programming, but that's
not what I see as the main thing.
What 'Ed' is depends a lot on your
RA. Every RA is different."
But while the "Ed" may be hard
to sort out, a clearer notion of what
the "Ed" aspect is would give the

program more direction, some say.
"I never really understood what
the academic thrust of Res Ed was,
and I'm not sure, as Res Ed devel
oped, it ever really has thought
about the effects of theme houses,"
says Man call. "It's an institution
searching for a mission.
"I think they never really fig
ured out the role of resident fel
lows," he adds, lamenting that
unlike at Harvard, it is not consid
ered a major honor to be a resident

fellow at Stanford.
"Eventually, I think what hap
pened is that Res Ed became a vest
ed interest in itself," says Man call.
"Although the University said it
eschewed it, Res Ed itself became
in loco parentis.
"Educating people about
racism, sexism. .. became the rai
son d'etre of Res Ed."
Last Thursday, a town hall
meeting on Res Ed and advising
was held in Kimball to solicit stu
dent input, and the subcommittee
has begun meeting with resident
fellows, resident assistants and
others, says CUE member A 1
Camarillo, associate dean of
humanities and sciences.
The subcommittee is also exam
ining responses to senior surveys
and last quarter's Res Ed survey,
and is in the process of formulating
a few more questions which will be
part of a special CUE survey to be
administered before the end of the
year. Focus groups are also being
employed to study Res Ed, Camar
illo said.
While CUE examines the intel
lectual aspects, the Faculty Sen
ate's Subcommittee on Residential
Education and Advising has began
its study of other aspects of Res Ed
— including its student support
functions, its attempt to create a
"pluralistic community," its facili
tation of leadership and responsibil
ity among students. In addition,
SREA will also reconsider the orga
nizational structure of the pro
gram.
Although appearing to work
quite separately, SREA and CUE
are coordinating their efforts, says
Camarillo, who sits on both. SREA
is expected to report directly to the
commission, which is to issue its
report in the fall. How the report
will fit with Edmonds' reorganiza
tion is unclear, but she says her

unit will "have the organizational
flexibility to deal with any recom
mendations from CUE."
While no one is certain what the
examination of Res Ed's funda
mentals will produce, any recom
mendations will have to be crafted
with the knowledge that funding
will be increasingly limited.
With its budget pared down to
$3 million, from more than $4 mil
lion in the 1980s, Res Ed has had to
reduce central office staff, the
number of RAs in residences, RA
salaries and program funds.
According to Acting Residential
Education Co-director Ann Por
teus, student housing, which has a
budget of about $50 million, must
cut about $1 million in this round
of budget cuts. How much of that
will come from Res Ed is undecid
ed, but it is certain to force an even
harder look at what the program
does — especially with regard to
education.
One critical function Res Ed
might play, speculates Harvey,
involves the increasing role of com
puters and other technology in
education at Stanford.
"Technology could make the
residences the real academic cen
ters." says Harvey. "A strong Res
Ed could really help facilitate
that."
As education becomes more and
more expensive — and if Stanford
maintains its commitment to need
blind admissions — Res Ed may
have an even greater role as an
"equalizing force" between stu
dents through its subsidizes of stu
dent programs and activities, says
Perry.
Man call says it is also necessary
to examine whether to integrate
graduate students and undergrad
uates, and also to look at the lack of
integration of foreign graduate stu
dents into the larger population.

Others hope that Res Ed can
simply refine what is has done in
the past. "I always felt that small
er, upperclass houses, with RFs
were probably ideal," says Supton.
"Of course, with budget cuts, it's
hard to afford this, but I think that
beyond the acclimation year, peo
ple may be in a really good position
to benefit from interaction with
faculty."
Although aspirations for the
future are running high, ominous
budget forecasts and fears that
high-level administrators don't
understand Res Ed are tempering
optimism that the program can be
revitalized for the '90s and beyond.
"I don't think the decision mak
ers in the administration have
enough experience with Res Ed,"
says Mancall. "If you're not on the
front line, how can you understand
it? ... They must get closer to the
thing about which they are trying
to make decisions."
And as Res Ed goes under
numerous campus microscopes,
many caution that the scrutiny
must not assume too limited a view
of the possible functions and roles
of the organization.
"Res Ed is not about putting one
section of your seminar into 558
(Mayfield) — although the more of
that the better. ... It's about giv
ing people responsibility, giving
them the chance to interact and
learn from each other," says
Kennedy.
"The temptation is to examine
curricular issues, but improving
undergraduate education involves
much more, especially improving
the quality of teaching and sharp
ening departmental accountability
for it."
"We shouldn't define education
too narrowly," says Rob Robinson.
"We're educating students about
being human in modern society."

Is the catfish God's most ignoble
creature?
Stanford's Residential Education
program has always been a little rene
gade, so it was no surprise in the 1980s
when a large crowd turned out to see
Branner Resident Fellow Kennell Jack
son and former Soto RF John Perry de
bate the merits of whiskered bottom
feeders. But while the topic appeared
frivolous, the intellectual discussion it
provoked on campus was anything but

light-hearted.
"People were talking about that for
weeks," says James Lyons, dean of stu
dent affairs from 1972-1990.
While discussions of catfish have
given way to programs on social issues,
Res Ed remains on a different path
than its counterparts at other universi
ties. While students at Harvard and
Yale live out their undergraduate years
in "houses" or "colleges" each with its
own coat of arms and china pattern,
Stanford students shuffle between
freshman dorms, vegetarian co-ops,
ethnic theme houses like Okada and

"focus houses" on everything from
human biology to international rela
tions.
Over the organization's 20 years,
some have questioned the clarity of its
educational mission and the objectives
of its programs, but Res Ed has never
theless become a veritable campus in
stitution. As Res Ed moves into its
third decade, however, many people say
the program is at a crucial point in its
history.
Within the past several years, the
two people who essentially creat
ed Res Ed — former directors
Alice Supton and Norm Robinson
— have left Stanford. Over a four
year period, 30 percent of the pro
gram's budget has been sliced.
And it is unclear whether Res Ed
has fully recovered from accusa
tions in the late 1980s that it had
a "hidden, liberal agenda" that
was "shoving multiculturalism
down students' throats."
Now, more budget cuts loom
on the horizon for Res Ed. Sub
committees of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education and
the Faculty Senate are examining
the program. In January, it was
announced that Res Ed will be
grouped administratively with
Housing and Dining Services, a
move that provoked consterna
tion among resident fellows and
prompted them to suggest alter
native structures.
"Res Ed is at a crossroads,"
says Muwekma-Tah-Ruk Resi
dent Fellow Andrew Lisac, assis
tant dean of continuing studies.
"It needs to be reconceptualized,
reinvigorated. I'd love to decon
struct the whole thing and see a
really broad-based re-examina
tion."
'Understanding the history'
To prepare Res Ed for the
future, those close to the organi
zation say it's important to look
at how and why Res Ed developed
the way it did.
"We've lost our institutional
memory now," says Lyons. "We
don't have the people here to
understand the history, and
that's critical."
While administrative turnover
has been high in the last several
years, many people with histori
cal perspectives — such as Lyons,
Robinson, History Prof. Mark
Mancall and Anthropology Prof.
James Gibbs — still lurk in the
nooks and crannies of Stanford.
In the eyes of Lyons, who came
to Stanford in the early '70s, Res
Ed was forged in the crucible of

'Res Ed is not about
putting one section
of your seminar into
558 (Mayfield). It's
about giving people
responsibility, giv
ing them the chance
to interact and learn
from each other.'
— Donald Kennedy

turbulent national and local
events of the 19605.
"We were coming out of some
really rough times at Stanford —
the burning of Encina (Hall) and
the anti-war rallies," says Lyons.
"I think it was an invigorating
time that caused people to re
examine what Stanford was
doing."
Some of that re-examination
came formally, in the 1968 Study
of Education at Stanford — simi
lar to today's Commission on
Undergraduate Education. That
report recommended residences
which were integrated across
class years; coeducational and sin
gle-sex residences; and the devel
opment of academic and thematic
houses "affording optimal oppor
tunities."
But much re-examination was
prompted by the circumstances of
the times, including the dwin
dling interest in fraternities, the
national move away from in loco
parentis, increasing interest in co
education, the civil rights move
ment and the war in Vietnam,
recalls Lyons.
As fraternity membership
dropped off and their houses were
vacated, the University was
forced to consider what to do with
the buildings, says Lyons. In addi
tion, many Stanford students
were taking advantage of overseas
studies — which were co-ed since
their inception in 1958 — and
returned to campus dissatisfied
with segregated housing.
As more housing opened up,
the University was faced with a
dilemma: should it be standard
ized, even though the facilities
were very different, or should a
variety of living arrangements be
provided?
"I and others realized early on
that Stanford would not take
comfortably to a standardized sit
uation," said Lyons.
In 1967, Stanford's first real
attempt at innovative housing
came when the Phi Delta Theta
fraternity was kicked off campus
for the year. Forced to leave their
house in December 1966, Mancall

'I don't think the
decision makers in
the administration
have enough experi
ence with Res Ed. If
you're not on the
front line, how can
you understand it?'
— Mark Mancall

organized a group of 31 male and
12 female students to move into
the house winter quarter.
Renamed "Grove House," the res
idence was organized around the
idea of "development" and stu
dents took small seminars in the
house. (See related story)
By 1968, several such "experi
mental" houses had cropped up
on campus, and residences
became co-educational "like domi
noes" says Robinson.
Co-operative houses such as
Columbae (a "non-violent protest
house"), Synergy (an "alternative
lifestyle house") and Terra (the
"ecology" house) soon sprouted
from the counterculture move
ment, recalls Robinson. And while
there were a few that failed —
Lyons remembers an "androgy
nous" house that folded a r ter a
year — most have continued until
this day.
Theme houses grew out of the
co-ops. La Maison Francaise was
the first "academic" theme house.
It was followed by La Casa Ital
iana in 1976, Haus Mitteleuropa
in 1978, American Studies and
EAST House. While some depart
ments tried to make these houses
into "departmental parlors,"
Lyons said, "We had to get them
to realize that these places were

the civil rights movement in the
late '60s and early '70s. Following

of the Black Student Union and
supporting administrators and

"Black Concentration House" in
1969.

anniversary of the house.

dence programs, "one of the
things we wanted to create was —
in what can be a very impersonal,
cool University — a sense of car
ing and inclusiveness," says
Lyons.
The Chicano theme house
came along in 1970, located first
in Roble and later in Stern. In
1972 it settled in its current loca
tion and in 1973 it was dubbed
"Casa Zapata." Asian-American
and Native American house pro
grams began in 1971.
By 1973, "Res Ed" was official
lingo, and the program was on its
way to national recognition.

ment, at the same time she
turned off a large number of stu
dents — freshmen and otherwise
— to a movement that had fre
quently challenged the status quo
through dramatic actions and
confrontational rhetoric.
"Some people experienced [The
Fire Within] as hard to hear,"
says Supton. It was a "voice of
alienation, . . . the espousement
of ideas they found challenging,
or accusatory, in some cases."
"The reaction, from that time
on was, 'You're trying to stuff it
down our throats,' " says Lyons.
"I don't think we were trying to
stuff it down throats. I think we

were trying to keep some impor
tant issues front and center."
Others say the backlash
stemmed not so much from what
Res Ed tried to do as how it tried
to do it.
"It was sometimes based on
blame and guilt, and that's not
productive," says Larkin Resident
Fellow Sue Harvey.
"I think [educating about
diversity] was a worthwhile goal,"
says Gibbs. "They probably
should've talked less about what
they were doing and simply done
it."
Whether Res Ed — its staff and
its reputation — has fully recov
ered from the backlash is unclear.
"Res Ed tried to understand
what was making people feel
excluded," says Supton. "Because
our goal was to find a place for
everyone. . . . Times changed,
people changed and I think we
recovered."
"There's been an attempt to
move away" from events and
activities that contributed to the
backlash, says Harvey. But other
assaults — budget cuts, Supton's
decision to reduce her position to
half-time, her subsequent depar
ture and other reorganizational
moves put Res Ed essentially in a
continual position of defense and
reaction.
"I think we need to go into a
proactive mode," says Harvey.
A call for action
Ironically, it was yet another
perceived "assault" that has
renewed the call for a thorough
re-examination of Res Ed.
In January, Vice Provost and
Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds announced Res Ed
would be resituated in a unit
headed by Director of Housing
and Dining Services Keith Guy.
Edmonds insists that Res Ed is
not "under" Housing and Dining
Services in the new configuration,
"all the parties are at the table
together planning, having their
views known, working together to
make the residential experience
the best possible."

The discussion has
focused too much
on names and titles,
without a public dis
cussion of the goals
and objectives of
Res Ed.'
— Norm Robinson

But RFs feel the move symbol
izes "a demotion of Reu Ed in the
eyes of the University," says Rob
Robinson.
"It boils down to who's on top,"
says Lyons. "Do you put the
greenskeeper in charge of the
football coach, or vice versa?"
Under Edmonds' proposal, a
half-time faculty dean of Residen
tial Education would oversee the
academic activities conducted in
student residences, such as dorm
based courses, while "round-the
clock" residential services would
report to Guy.
While critical of its vagueness,
many people have acclaimed the
deanship idea — even to the point
of envisioning a significantly
greater role for such a person in
an administrative structure radi
cally different from Edmond's
plan.
Calling the deanship an "excel
lent idea," Perry said having a
faculty member leading Res Ed
would keep the organization in
touch with the "academic values"
of Stanford. If the dean headed up
the entire organization and it
reported directly to the provost,
so much the better, he says.
"I'd like to see Res Ed brought
under an academic dean not
because I think [residences]
should become more like class
rooms, but because that person
could take a broad-based view" of
the program, says Mancall, a for
mer resident fellow in Arroyo and
Florence Moore Hall.
Others believe having a faculty
member lead Res Ed would give
the organization more legitimacy,
more stature and could bolster
efforts to recruit more faculty to
serve as resident fellows.
"Having faculty leadership
within Res Ed could be extremely
healthy," says Supton.
Perry said he can envision mul
tifarious roles for a faculty dean
of Res Ed, from lending Res Ed a
more "departmental" sense to
improving departmental recogni
tion of faculty who serve as resi
dent fellows. Most importantly,




though, Perry sees the dean as
someone who would be an "advo
cate" for undergraduates and who
would keep the president and
provost abreast of what is happen
ing in the residences.
And while enthusiasm is run
ning high for the post, many orga
nizational and staffing factors
must still be resolved — would
there be a dean and a director? If
so, would there be a philosophical
divide between the program's aca
demic and non-academic func
tions?
"To play the intellectual leader
ship role successfully, you have to
be working with students at all lev
els," says Supton, who noted that
Stanford's approach to students in
residences has traditionally more
integrated than that of Harvard or
Yale.
According to Supton, it may be
difficult to "cut off the heads of
RFs above the ears" and say that
on academic matters, fellows
"relate to this person over here,
but on everything else — drinking.
.. homophobic remarks ... those
things belong somewhere else."
"I do worry about a program
that is supposed to be integrated —
splitting up the organization," says
Norm Robinson. "It weakens the
program the more split and diffuse
the responsibility is."
Finances, too, may be an issue.
Some question whether the dean
ship might cost the program more
money, and wonder whether is it
the best place to allocate money in
a time of tight budgets.
"Certainly, the best place to put
the money is in the residences,"
says Harvey. "I wouldn't like to see
a dean's salary come at the expense
of RF programming funds."
Despite the enthusiasm for

organizational tinkering, many feel
that the recent emphasis on new
positions and administrative
restructuring has put the prover
bial cart before the horse.
"The discussion has focused too
much on names and titles, without
a public discussion of the goals and
objectives of Res Ed," says Norm
Robinson.
"The question we shouldn't be
asking is, 'Is this administratively
more efficient?' " says Harvey.
"The question is, 'Is this the best
and most effective way to meet stu
dents' needs?' "

All the parties are at
the table together
planning, having
their views known,
working together to
make the residential
experience the best
possible.'
— Mary Edmonds

Toward the future
One group asking those questions
is CUE's subcommittee on aca
demic environment, which is look
ing into Res Ed's academic and
intellectual aspects — such as
dorm-based courses, intellectual
programming, focus houses and
theme houses.
While applauding the attention,
those close to Res Ed say it has
always been difficult to nail down

the "Ed" sense of the organization.
"In some senses, it's vague,
because there is no formal curricu
lum and it's not a discipline," says
Norm Robinson.
Senior Seema Jain, a resident
assistant in Roble, agrees.
"It is ambiguous," says Jain.
"What a lot of people associate with
the 'Ed' is programming, but that's
not what I see as the main thing.
What 'Ed' is depends a lot on your
RA. Every RA is different."
But while the "Ed" may be hard
to sort out, a clearer notion of what
the "Ed" aspect is would give the

program more direction, some say.
"I never really understood what
the academic thrust of Res Ed was,
and I'm not sure, as Res Ed devel
oped, it ever really has thought
about the effects of theme houses,"
says Man call. "It's an institution
searching for a mission.
"I think they never really fig
ured out the role of resident fel
lows," he adds, lamenting that
unlike at Harvard, it is not consid
ered a major honor to be a resident

fellow at Stanford.
"Eventually, I think what hap
pened is that Res Ed became a vest
ed interest in itself," says Man call.
"Although the University said it
eschewed it, Res Ed itself became
in loco parentis.
"Educating people about
racism, sexism. .. became the rai
son d'etre of Res Ed."
Last Thursday, a town hall
meeting on Res Ed and advising
was held in Kimball to solicit stu
dent input, and the subcommittee
has begun meeting with resident
fellows, resident assistants and
others, says CUE member A 1
Camarillo, associate dean of
humanities and sciences.
The subcommittee is also exam
ining responses to senior surveys
and last quarter's Res Ed survey,
and is in the process of formulating
a few more questions which will be
part of a special CUE survey to be
administered before the end of the
year. Focus groups are also being
employed to study Res Ed, Camar
illo said.
While CUE examines the intel
lectual aspects, the Faculty Sen
ate's Subcommittee on Residential
Education and Advising has began
its study of other aspects of Res Ed
— including its student support
functions, its attempt to create a
"pluralistic community," its facili
tation of leadership and responsibil
ity among students. In addition,
SREA will also reconsider the orga
nizational structure of the pro
gram.
Although appearing to work
quite separately, SREA and CUE
are coordinating their efforts, says
Camarillo, who sits on both. SREA
is expected to report directly to the
commission, which is to issue its
report in the fall. How the report
will fit with Edmonds' reorganiza
tion is unclear, but she says her

unit will "have the organizational
flexibility to deal with any recom
mendations from CUE."
While no one is certain what the
examination of Res Ed's funda
mentals will produce, any recom
mendations will have to be crafted
with the knowledge that funding
will be increasingly limited.
With its budget pared down to
$3 million, from more than $4 mil
lion in the 1980s, Res Ed has had to
reduce central office staff, the
number of RAs in residences, RA
salaries and program funds.
According to Acting Residential
Education Co-director Ann Por
teus, student housing, which has a
budget of about $50 million, must
cut about $1 million in this round
of budget cuts. How much of that
will come from Res Ed is undecid
ed, but it is certain to force an even
harder look at what the program
does — especially with regard to
education.
One critical function Res Ed
might play, speculates Harvey,
involves the increasing role of com
puters and other technology in
education at Stanford.
"Technology could make the
residences the real academic cen
ters." says Harvey. "A strong Res
Ed could really help facilitate
that."
As education becomes more and
more expensive — and if Stanford
maintains its commitment to need
blind admissions — Res Ed may
have an even greater role as an
"equalizing force" between stu
dents through its subsidizes of stu
dent programs and activities, says
Perry.
Man call says it is also necessary
to examine whether to integrate
graduate students and undergrad
uates, and also to look at the lack of
integration of foreign graduate stu
dents into the larger population.

Others hope that Res Ed can
simply refine what is has done in
the past. "I always felt that small
er, upperclass houses, with RFs
were probably ideal," says Supton.
"Of course, with budget cuts, it's
hard to afford this, but I think that
beyond the acclimation year, peo
ple may be in a really good position
to benefit from interaction with
faculty."
Although aspirations for the
future are running high, ominous
budget forecasts and fears that
high-level administrators don't
understand Res Ed are tempering
optimism that the program can be
revitalized for the '90s and beyond.
"I don't think the decision mak
ers in the administration have
enough experience with Res Ed,"
says Mancall. "If you're not on the
front line, how can you understand
it? ... They must get closer to the
thing about which they are trying
to make decisions."
And as Res Ed goes under
numerous campus microscopes,
many caution that the scrutiny
must not assume too limited a view
of the possible functions and roles
of the organization.
"Res Ed is not about putting one
section of your seminar into 558
(Mayfield) — although the more of
that the better. ... It's about giv
ing people responsibility, giving
them the chance to interact and
learn from each other," says
Kennedy.
"The temptation is to examine
curricular issues, but improving
undergraduate education involves
much more, especially improving
the quality of teaching and sharp
ening departmental accountability
for it."
"We shouldn't define education
too narrowly," says Rob Robinson.
"We're educating students about
being human in modern society."

Is the catfish God's most ignoble
creature?
Stanford's Residential Education
program has always been a little rene
gade, so it was no surprise in the 1980s
when a large crowd turned out to see
Branner Resident Fellow Kennell Jack
son and former Soto RF John Perry de
bate the merits of whiskered bottom
feeders. But while the topic appeared
frivolous, the intellectual discussion it
provoked on campus was anything but

light-hearted.
"People were talking about that for
weeks," says James Lyons, dean of stu
dent affairs from 1972-1990.
While discussions of catfish have
given way to programs on social issues,
Res Ed remains on a different path
than its counterparts at other universi
ties. While students at Harvard and
Yale live out their undergraduate years
in "houses" or "colleges" each with its
own coat of arms and china pattern,
Stanford students shuffle between
freshman dorms, vegetarian co-ops,
ethnic theme houses like Okada and

"focus houses" on everything from
human biology to international rela
tions.
Over the organization's 20 years,
some have questioned the clarity of its
educational mission and the objectives
of its programs, but Res Ed has never
theless become a veritable campus in
stitution. As Res Ed moves into its
third decade, however, many people say
the program is at a crucial point in its
history.
Within the past several years, the
two people who essentially creat
ed Res Ed — former directors
Alice Supton and Norm Robinson
— have left Stanford. Over a four
year period, 30 percent of the pro
gram's budget has been sliced.
And it is unclear whether Res Ed
has fully recovered from accusa
tions in the late 1980s that it had
a "hidden, liberal agenda" that
was "shoving multiculturalism
down students' throats."
Now, more budget cuts loom
on the horizon for Res Ed. Sub
committees of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education and
the Faculty Senate are examining
the program. In January, it was
announced that Res Ed will be
grouped administratively with
Housing and Dining Services, a
move that provoked consterna
tion among resident fellows and
prompted them to suggest alter
native structures.
"Res Ed is at a crossroads,"
says Muwekma-Tah-Ruk Resi
dent Fellow Andrew Lisac, assis
tant dean of continuing studies.
"It needs to be reconceptualized,
reinvigorated. I'd love to decon
struct the whole thing and see a
really broad-based re-examina
tion."
'Understanding the history'
To prepare Res Ed for the
future, those close to the organi
zation say it's important to look
at how and why Res Ed developed
the way it did.
"We've lost our institutional
memory now," says Lyons. "We
don't have the people here to
understand the history, and
that's critical."
While administrative turnover
has been high in the last several
years, many people with histori
cal perspectives — such as Lyons,
Robinson, History Prof. Mark
Mancall and Anthropology Prof.
James Gibbs — still lurk in the
nooks and crannies of Stanford.
In the eyes of Lyons, who came
to Stanford in the early '70s, Res
Ed was forged in the crucible of

'Res Ed is not about
putting one section
of your seminar into
558 (Mayfield). It's
about giving people
responsibility, giv
ing them the chance
to interact and learn
from each other.'
— Donald Kennedy

turbulent national and local
events of the 19605.
"We were coming out of some
really rough times at Stanford —
the burning of Encina (Hall) and
the anti-war rallies," says Lyons.
"I think it was an invigorating
time that caused people to re
examine what Stanford was
doing."
Some of that re-examination
came formally, in the 1968 Study
of Education at Stanford — simi
lar to today's Commission on
Undergraduate Education. That
report recommended residences
which were integrated across
class years; coeducational and sin
gle-sex residences; and the devel
opment of academic and thematic
houses "affording optimal oppor
tunities."
But much re-examination was
prompted by the circumstances of
the times, including the dwin
dling interest in fraternities, the
national move away from in loco
parentis, increasing interest in co
education, the civil rights move
ment and the war in Vietnam,
recalls Lyons.
As fraternity membership
dropped off and their houses were
vacated, the University was
forced to consider what to do with
the buildings, says Lyons. In addi
tion, many Stanford students
were taking advantage of overseas
studies — which were co-ed since
their inception in 1958 — and
returned to campus dissatisfied
with segregated housing.
As more housing opened up,
the University was faced with a
dilemma: should it be standard
ized, even though the facilities
were very different, or should a
variety of living arrangements be
provided?
"I and others realized early on
that Stanford would not take
comfortably to a standardized sit
uation," said Lyons.
In 1967, Stanford's first real
attempt at innovative housing
came when the Phi Delta Theta
fraternity was kicked off campus
for the year. Forced to leave their
house in December 1966, Mancall

'I don't think the
decision makers in
the administration
have enough experi
ence with Res Ed. If
you're not on the
front line, how can
you understand it?'
— Mark Mancall

organized a group of 31 male and
12 female students to move into
the house winter quarter.
Renamed "Grove House," the res
idence was organized around the
idea of "development" and stu
dents took small seminars in the
house. (See related story)
By 1968, several such "experi
mental" houses had cropped up
on campus, and residences
became co-educational "like domi
noes" says Robinson.
Co-operative houses such as
Columbae (a "non-violent protest
house"), Synergy (an "alternative
lifestyle house") and Terra (the
"ecology" house) soon sprouted
from the counterculture move
ment, recalls Robinson. And while
there were a few that failed —
Lyons remembers an "androgy
nous" house that folded a r ter a
year — most have continued until
this day.
Theme houses grew out of the
co-ops. La Maison Francaise was
the first "academic" theme house.
It was followed by La Casa Ital
iana in 1976, Haus Mitteleuropa
in 1978, American Studies and
EAST House. While some depart
ments tried to make these houses
into "departmental parlors,"
Lyons said, "We had to get them
to realize that these places were
first and foremost students'
homes."
Ethnic theme houses originat
ed slightly earlier, on the heels of
the civil rights movement in the
late '60s and early '70s. Following
months of pressure by members
of the Black Student Union and
supporting administrators and
faculty, Cedro was designated the
"Black Concentration House" in
1969.
The house represented a major
coup for black students, who had
sought a sense of community and
gathering place. At the time, only
1 percent of the student popula
tion was black. While the Univer
sity was somewhat skeptical of
the house, "it just worked out
beautifully," Psychiatry Prof.
William Dement, the house's first
resident fellow, said on the 20th
anniversary of the house.
In developing its cadre of resi
dence programs, "one of the
things we wanted to create was —
in what can be a very impersonal,
cool University — a sense of car
ing and inclusiveness," says
Lyons.
The Chicano theme house
came along in 1970, located first
in Roble and later in Stern. In
1972 it settled in its current loca
tion and in 1973 it was dubbed
"Casa Zapata." Asian-American
and Native American house pro
grams began in 1971.
By 1973, "Res Ed" was official
lingo, and the program was on its
way to national recognition.
Days of glory and grief
The '80s ushered in what some
might call the "golden era" of Res
Ed. A favorable economic climate
allowed the construction of Gov
ernor's Corner which included
Sterling Quad and the Suites, cre
ating 800 new housing spaces to
the tune of $36 million. More stu
dents than ever were living on
campus, and expanding budgets
allowed for more staff, more pro
grams and the addition of focus
houses on such topics as gender
and Human Biology.
"There was a period of time, in
the mid-'Bos, when we were able
to add positions like the multicul
tural educator, and resident fel
lows had significantly more
funds," remembers Supton. "In
retrospect, that was a high point
for Res Ed.

"The money was enabling. The
central staff was able to create
programs, .. . bring in speakers,
filmmakers, musicians, authors. .
. . We could create a set of activi
ties and the residence staff could
schedule them."
But while the '80s brought
more resources, they also brought
challenges — one of the most sig
nificant being a ever-more diverse
student body. Increasingly, says
Lyons, Res Ed was looking to pro
mote understanding of a whole
host of issues related to diversity,
including race, religion, sexual
orientation and class.
In his 1988 welcoming address,
former University President Don
ald Kennedy told freshmen: "In
residential education and else
where at Stanford, racial under
standing has properly become a
powerful theme. It is important
for you to acknowledge that
theme and to recognize it as an
integral part of the education you
will receive here, not as some
extracurricular sideshow."
As early as 1987 and 1988, Res
Ed began to draw criticism, as
some students claimed that the
system, in trying to promote
"inclusiveness and open-minded
ness," it was itself closed-minded.
They claimed the Res Ed staff had
a hidden, pro-liberal agenda.
Not really, say some in the sys
tem. "The 'Res Ed agenda' pre
sumes a far greater central orga
nization than ever existed," says
German Prof. Rob Robinson, a
former RF in Roble. Others say
there was an "agenda" to a degree
— an agenda of which they were
proud.
"There was an agenda, in the
sense that there was an agenda of
humanity,... of including all peo
ple for who they were," says Sup
ton. "To the extent that programs
offered a chance to explore simi
larities and differences, I think
that was good.
"If you were encountering the
ideas for the first time, you may
have felt imposed upon."
"Under Donald Kennedy, there
was a huge commitment to diver
sity," says Lyons. "But we spent
so much time doing that, we for
got to turn a mirror on ourselves
and ask 'What kind of a commu
nity do we have here?'
"UCMI did that, and suddenly
we faced a humongous task," says
Lyons. Yet as 1989's report from
the University Committee on
Minority Issues put a formal spot
light on multicultural issues and
recommended more programs,
activities and policy changes, the
same year also brought what
many people have pointed to as
the event that catalyzed "the mul
ticultural backlash:" a speech by
student Ingrid Nava at "The Fire
Within," a freshman Orientation
program, in which she implored
the audience to work for change
in the University.
While many felt Nava crystal
lized the passion and politics of
Stanford's multicultural move
ment, at the same time she
turned off a large number of stu
dents — freshmen and otherwise
— to a movement that had fre
quently challenged the status quo
through dramatic actions and
confrontational rhetoric.
"Some people experienced [The
Fire Within] as hard to hear,"
says Supton. It was a "voice of
alienation, . . . the espousement
of ideas they found challenging,
or accusatory, in some cases."
"The reaction, from that time
on was, 'You're trying to stuff it
down our throats,' " says Lyons.
"I don't think we were trying to
stuff it down throats. I think we

were trying to keep some impor
tant issues front and center."
Others say the backlash
stemmed not so much from what
Res Ed tried to do as how it tried
to do it.
"It was sometimes based on
blame and guilt, and that's not
productive," says Larkin Resident
Fellow Sue Harvey.
"I think [educating about
diversity] was a worthwhile goal,"
says Gibbs. "They probably
should've talked less about what
they were doing and simply done
it."
Whether Res Ed — its staff and
its reputation — has fully recov
ered from the backlash is unclear.
"Res Ed tried to understand
what was making people feel
excluded," says Supton. "Because
our goal was to find a place for
everyone. . . . Times changed,
people changed and I think we
recovered."
"There's been an attempt to
move away" from events and
activities that contributed to the
backlash, says Harvey. But other
assaults — budget cuts, Supton's
decision to reduce her position to
half-time, her subsequent depar
ture and other reorganizational
moves put Res Ed essentially in a
continual position of defense and
reaction.
"I think we need to go into a
proactive mode," says Harvey.
A call for action
Ironically, it was yet another
perceived "assault" that has
renewed the call for a thorough
re-examination of Res Ed.

Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds announced Res Ed
would be resituated in a unit

Robinson.

"Certainly, the best place to put
the money is in the residences,"
says Harvey. "I wouldn't like to see
a dean's salary come at the expense
of RF programming funds."
Despite the enthusiasm for

organizational tinkering, many feel
that the recent emphasis on new
positions and administrative
restructuring has put the prover
bial cart before the horse.
"The discussion has focused too
much on names and titles, without
a public discussion of the goals and
objectives of Res Ed," says Norm
Robinson.
"The question we shouldn't be
asking is, 'Is this administratively
more efficient?' " says Harvey.
"The question is, 'Is this the best
and most effective way to meet stu
dents' needs?' "

All the parties are at
the table together
planning, having
their views known,
working together to
make the residential
experience the best
possible.'

Toward the future
One group asking those questions
is CUE's subcommittee on aca
demic environment, which is look
ing into Res Ed's academic and
intellectual aspects — such as
dorm-based courses, intellectual
programming, focus houses and
theme houses.
While applauding the attention,
those close to Res Ed say it has
always been difficult to nail down

the "Ed" sense of the organization.
"In some senses, it's vague,
because there is no formal curricu
lum and it's not a discipline," says
Norm Robinson.
Senior Seema Jain, a resident
assistant in Roble, agrees.
"It is ambiguous," says Jain.
"What a lot of people associate with
the 'Ed' is programming, but that's
not what I see as the main thing.
What 'Ed' is depends a lot on your
RA. Every RA is different."
But while the "Ed" may be hard
to sort out, a clearer notion of what
the "Ed" aspect is would give the

program more direction, some say.
"I never really understood what
the academic thrust of Res Ed was,
and I'm not sure, as Res Ed devel
oped, it ever really has thought
about the effects of theme houses,"
says Man call. "It's an institution
searching for a mission.
"I think they never really fig
ured out the role of resident fel
lows," he adds, lamenting that
unlike at Harvard, it is not consid
ered a major honor to be a resident

fellow at Stanford.
"Eventually, I think what hap
pened is that Res Ed became a vest
ed interest in itself," says Man call.
"Although the University said it
eschewed it, Res Ed itself became
in loco parentis.
"Educating people about
racism, sexism. .. became the rai
son d'etre of Res Ed."
Last Thursday, a town hall
meeting on Res Ed and advising
was held in Kimball to solicit stu
dent input, and the subcommittee
has begun meeting with resident
fellows, resident assistants and
others, says CUE member A 1
Camarillo, associate dean of
humanities and sciences.
The subcommittee is also exam
ining responses to senior surveys
and last quarter's Res Ed survey,
and is in the process of formulating
a few more questions which will be
part of a special CUE survey to be
administered before the end of the
year. Focus groups are also being
employed to study Res Ed, Camar
illo said.
While CUE examines the intel
lectual aspects, the Faculty Sen
ate's Subcommittee on Residential
Education and Advising has began
its study of other aspects of Res Ed
— including its student support
functions, its attempt to create a
"pluralistic community," its facili
tation of leadership and responsibil
ity among students. In addition,
SREA will also reconsider the orga
nizational structure of the pro
gram.
Although appearing to work
quite separately, SREA and CUE
are coordinating their efforts, says
Camarillo, who sits on both. SREA
is expected to report directly to the
commission, which is to issue its
report in the fall. How the report
will fit with Edmonds' reorganiza
tion is unclear, but she says her

unit will "have the organizational
flexibility to deal with any recom
mendations from CUE."
While no one is certain what the
examination of Res Ed's funda
mentals will produce, any recom
mendations will have to be crafted
with the knowledge that funding
will be increasingly limited.
With its budget pared down to
$3 million, from more than $4 mil
lion in the 1980s, Res Ed has had to
reduce central office staff, the
number of RAs in residences, RA
salaries and program funds.
According to Acting Residential
Education Co-director Ann Por
teus, student housing, which has a
budget of about $50 million, must
cut about $1 million in this round
of budget cuts. How much of that
will come from Res Ed is undecid
ed, but it is certain to force an even
harder look at what the program
does — especially with regard to
education.
One critical function Res Ed
might play, speculates Harvey,
involves the increasing role of com
puters and other technology in
education at Stanford.
"Technology could make the
residences the real academic cen
ters." says Harvey. "A strong Res
Ed could really help facilitate
that."
As education becomes more and
more expensive — and if Stanford
maintains its commitment to need
blind admissions — Res Ed may
have an even greater role as an
"equalizing force" between stu
dents through its subsidizes of stu
dent programs and activities, says
Perry.
Man call says it is also necessary
to examine whether to integrate
graduate students and undergrad
uates, and also to look at the lack of
integration of foreign graduate stu
dents into the larger population.

Others hope that Res Ed can
simply refine what is has done in
the past. "I always felt that small
er, upperclass houses, with RFs
were probably ideal," says Supton.
"Of course, with budget cuts, it's
hard to afford this, but I think that
beyond the acclimation year, peo
ple may be in a really good position
to benefit from interaction with
faculty."
Although aspirations for the
future are running high, ominous
budget forecasts and fears that
high-level administrators don't
understand Res Ed are tempering
optimism that the program can be
revitalized for the '90s and beyond.
"I don't think the decision mak
ers in the administration have
enough experience with Res Ed,"
says Mancall. "If you're not on the
front line, how can you understand
it? ... They must get closer to the
thing about which they are trying
to make decisions."
And as Res Ed goes under
numerous campus microscopes,
many caution that the scrutiny
must not assume too limited a view
of the possible functions and roles
of the organization.
"Res Ed is not about putting one
section of your seminar into 558
(Mayfield) — although the more of
that the better. ... It's about giv
ing people responsibility, giving
them the chance to interact and
learn from each other," says
Kennedy.
"The temptation is to examine
curricular issues, but improving
undergraduate education involves
much more, especially improving
the quality of teaching and sharp
ening departmental accountability
for it."
"We shouldn't define education
too narrowly," says Rob Robinson.
"We're educating students about
being human in modern society."

Is the catfish God's most ignoble
creature?
Stanford's Residential Education
program has always been a little rene
gade, so it was no surprise in the 1980s
when a large crowd turned out to see
Branner Resident Fellow Kennell Jack
son and former Soto RF John Perry de
bate the merits of whiskered bottom
feeders. But while the topic appeared
frivolous, the intellectual discussion it
provoked on campus was anything but

light-hearted.
"People were talking about that for
weeks," says James Lyons, dean of stu
dent affairs from 1972-1990.
While discussions of catfish have
given way to programs on social issues,
Res Ed remains on a different path
than its counterparts at other universi
ties. While students at Harvard and
Yale live out their undergraduate years
in "houses" or "colleges" each with its
own coat of arms and china pattern,
Stanford students shuffle between
freshman dorms, vegetarian co-ops,
ethnic theme houses like Okada and

"focus houses" on everything from
human biology to international rela
tions.
Over the organization's 20 years,
some have questioned the clarity of its
educational mission and the objectives
of its programs, but Res Ed has never
theless become a veritable campus in
stitution. As Res Ed moves into its
third decade, however, many people say
the program is at a crucial point in its
history.
Within the past several years, the
two people who essentially creat
ed Res Ed — former directors
Alice Supton and Norm Robinson
— have left Stanford. Over a four
year period, 30 percent of the pro
gram's budget has been sliced.
And it is unclear whether Res Ed
has fully recovered from accusa
tions in the late 1980s that it had
a "hidden, liberal agenda" that
was "shoving multiculturalism
down students' throats."
Now, more budget cuts loom
on the horizon for Res Ed. Sub
committees of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education and
the Faculty Senate are examining
the program. In January, it was
announced that Res Ed will be
grouped administratively with
Housing and Dining Services, a
move that provoked consterna
tion among resident fellows and
prompted them to suggest alter
native structures.
"Res Ed is at a crossroads,"
says Muwekma-Tah-Ruk Resi
dent Fellow Andrew Lisac, assis
tant dean of continuing studies.
"It needs to be reconceptualized,
reinvigorated. I'd love to decon
struct the whole thing and see a
really broad-based re-examina
tion."
'Understanding the history'
To prepare Res Ed for the
future, those close to the organi
zation say it's important to look
at how and why Res Ed developed
the way it did.
"We've lost our institutional
memory now," says Lyons. "We
don't have the people here to
understand the history, and
that's critical."
While administrative turnover
has been high in the last several
years, many people with histori
cal perspectives — such as Lyons,
Robinson, History Prof. Mark
Mancall and Anthropology Prof.
James Gibbs — still lurk in the
nooks and crannies of Stanford.
In the eyes of Lyons, who came
to Stanford in the early '70s, Res
Ed was forged in the crucible of

'Res Ed is not about
putting one section
of your seminar into
558 (Mayfield). It's
about giving people
responsibility, giv
ing them the chance
to interact and learn
from each other.'
— Donald Kennedy

turbulent national and local
events of the 19605.
"We were coming out of some
really rough times at Stanford —
the burning of Encina (Hall) and
the anti-war rallies," says Lyons.
"I think it was an invigorating
time that caused people to re
examine what Stanford was
doing."
Some of that re-examination
came formally, in the 1968 Study
of Education at Stanford — simi
lar to today's Commission on
Undergraduate Education. That
report recommended residences
which were integrated across
class years; coeducational and sin
gle-sex residences; and the devel
opment of academic and thematic
houses "affording optimal oppor
tunities."
But much re-examination was
prompted by the circumstances of
the times, including the dwin
dling interest in fraternities, the
national move away from in loco
parentis, increasing interest in co
education, the civil rights move
ment and the war in Vietnam,
recalls Lyons.
As fraternity membership
dropped off and their houses were
vacated, the University was
forced to consider what to do with
the buildings, says Lyons. In addi
tion, many Stanford students
were taking advantage of overseas
studies — which were co-ed since
their inception in 1958 — and
returned to campus dissatisfied
with segregated housing.
As more housing opened up,
the University was faced with a
dilemma: should it be standard
ized, even though the facilities
were very different, or should a
variety of living arrangements be
provided?
"I and others realized early on
that Stanford would not take
comfortably to a standardized sit
uation," said Lyons.
In 1967, Stanford's first real
attempt at innovative housing
came when the Phi Delta Theta
fraternity was kicked off campus
for the year. Forced to leave their
house in December 1966, Mancall

'I don't think the
decision makers in
the administration
have enough experi
ence with Res Ed. If
you're not on the
front line, how can
you understand it?'
— Mark Mancall

organized a group of 31 male and
12 female students to move into
the house winter quarter.
Renamed "Grove House," the res
idence was organized around the
idea of "development" and stu
dents took small seminars in the
house. (See related story)
By 1968, several such "experi
mental" houses had cropped up
on campus, and residences
became co-educational "like domi
noes" says Robinson.
Co-operative houses such as
Columbae (a "non-violent protest
house"), Synergy (an "alternative
lifestyle house") and Terra (the
"ecology" house) soon sprouted
from the counterculture move
ment, recalls Robinson. And while
there were a few that failed —
Lyons remembers an "androgy
nous" house that folded a r ter a
year — most have continued until
this day.
Theme houses grew out of the
co-ops. La Maison Francaise was
the first "academic" theme house.
It was followed by La Casa Ital
iana in 1976, Haus Mitteleuropa
in 1978, American Studies and
EAST House. While some depart
ments tried to make these houses
into "departmental parlors,"
Lyons said, "We had to get them
to realize that these places were
first and foremost students'
homes."
Ethnic theme houses originat
ed slightly earlier, on the heels of
the civil rights movement in the
late '60s and early '70s. Following
months of pressure by members
of the Black Student Union and
supporting administrators and
faculty, Cedro was designated the
"Black Concentration House" in
1969.
The house represented a major
coup for black students, who had
sought a sense of community and
gathering place. At the time, only
1 percent of the student popula
tion was black. While the Univer
sity was somewhat skeptical of
the house, "it just worked out
beautifully," Psychiatry Prof.
William Dement, the house's first
resident fellow, said on the 20th
anniversary of the house.
In developing its cadre of resi
dence programs, "one of the
things we wanted to create was —
in what can be a very impersonal,
cool University — a sense of car
ing and inclusiveness," says
Lyons.
The Chicano theme house
came along in 1970, located first
in Roble and later in Stern. In
1972 it settled in its current loca
tion and in 1973 it was dubbed
"Casa Zapata." Asian-American
and Native American house pro
grams began in 1971.
By 1973, "Res Ed" was official
lingo, and the program was on its
way to national recognition.
Days of glory and grief
The '80s ushered in what some
might call the "golden era" of Res
Ed. A favorable economic climate
allowed the construction of Gov
ernor's Corner which included
Sterling Quad and the Suites, cre
ating 800 new housing spaces to
the tune of $36 million. More stu
dents than ever were living on
campus, and expanding budgets
allowed for more staff, more pro
grams and the addition of focus
houses on such topics as gender
and Human Biology.
"There was a period of time, in
the mid-'Bos, when we were able
to add positions like the multicul
tural educator, and resident fel
lows had significantly more
funds," remembers Supton. "In
retrospect, that was a high point
for Res Ed.

"The money was enabling. The
central staff was able to create
programs, .. . bring in speakers,
filmmakers, musicians, authors. .
. . We could create a set of activi
ties and the residence staff could
schedule them."
But while the '80s brought
more resources, they also brought
challenges — one of the most sig
nificant being a ever-more diverse
student body. Increasingly, says
Lyons, Res Ed was looking to pro
mote understanding of a whole
host of issues related to diversity,
including race, religion, sexual
orientation and class.
In his 1988 welcoming address,
former University President Don
ald Kennedy told freshmen: "In
residential education and else
where at Stanford, racial under
standing has properly become a
powerful theme. It is important
for you to acknowledge that
theme and to recognize it as an
integral part of the education you
will receive here, not as some
extracurricular sideshow."
As early as 1987 and 1988, Res
Ed began to draw criticism, as
some students claimed that the
system, in trying to promote
"inclusiveness and open-minded
ness," it was itself closed-minded.
They claimed the Res Ed staff had
a hidden, pro-liberal agenda.
Not really, say some in the sys
tem. "The 'Res Ed agenda' pre
sumes a far greater central orga
nization than ever existed," says
German Prof. Rob Robinson, a
former RF in Roble. Others say
there was an "agenda" to a degree
— an agenda of which they were
proud.
"There was an agenda, in the
sense that there was an agenda of
humanity,... of including all peo
ple for who they were," says Sup
ton. "To the extent that programs
offered a chance to explore simi
larities and differences, I think
that was good.
"If you were encountering the
ideas for the first time, you may
have felt imposed upon."
"Under Donald Kennedy, there
was a huge commitment to diver
sity," says Lyons. "But we spent
so much time doing that, we for
got to turn a mirror on ourselves
and ask 'What kind of a commu
nity do we have here?'
"UCMI did that, and suddenly
we faced a humongous task," says
Lyons. Yet as 1989's report from
the University Committee on
Minority Issues put a formal spot
light on multicultural issues and
recommended more programs,
activities and policy changes, the
same year also brought what
many people have pointed to as
the event that catalyzed "the mul
ticultural backlash:" a speech by
student Ingrid Nava at "The Fire
Within," a freshman Orientation
program, in which she implored
the audience to work for change
in the University.
While many felt Nava crystal
lized the passion and politics of
Stanford's multicultural move
ment, at the same time she
turned off a large number of stu
dents — freshmen and otherwise
— to a movement that had fre
quently challenged the status quo
through dramatic actions and
confrontational rhetoric.
"Some people experienced [The
Fire Within] as hard to hear,"
says Supton. It was a "voice of
alienation, . . . the espousement
of ideas they found challenging,
or accusatory, in some cases."
"The reaction, from that time
on was, 'You're trying to stuff it
down our throats,' " says Lyons.
"I don't think we were trying to
stuff it down throats. I think we

It boils down to
who's on top. Do
you put the
greenskeeper in
charge of the foot
ball coach, or vice
versa?'

were trying to keep some impor
tant issues front and center."
Others say the backlash
stemmed not so much from what
Res Ed tried to do as how it tried
to do it.
"It was sometimes based on
blame and guilt, and that's not
productive," says Larkin Resident
Fellow Sue Harvey.
"I think [educating about
diversity] was a worthwhile goal,"
says Gibbs. "They probably
should've talked less about what
they were doing and simply done
it."
Whether Res Ed — its staff and
its reputation — has fully recov
ered from the backlash is unclear.
"Res Ed tried to understand
what was making people feel
excluded," says Supton. "Because
our goal was to find a place for
everyone. . . . Times changed,
people changed and I think we
recovered."
"There's been an attempt to
move away" from events and
activities that contributed to the
backlash, says Harvey. But other
assaults — budget cuts, Supton's
decision to reduce her position to
half-time, her subsequent depar
ture and other reorganizational
moves put Res Ed essentially in a
continual position of defense and
reaction.
"I think we need to go into a
proactive mode," says Harvey.
A call for action
Ironically, it was yet another
perceived "assault" that has
renewed the call for a thorough
re-examination of Res Ed.
In January, Vice Provost and
Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds announced Res Ed
would be resituated in a unit
headed by Director of Housing
and Dining Services Keith Guy.
Edmonds insists that Res Ed is
not "under" Housing and Dining
Services in the new configuration,
"all the parties are at the table
together planning, having their
views known, working together to
make the residential experience
the best possible."

The discussion has
focused too much
on names and titles,
without a public dis
cussion of the goals
and objectives of
Res Ed.'
— Norm Robinson

But RFs feel the move symbol
izes "a demotion of Reu Ed in the
eyes of the University," says Rob
Robinson.
"It boils down to who's on top,"
says Lyons. "Do you put the
greenskeeper in charge of the
football coach, or vice versa?"
Under Edmonds' proposal, a
half-time faculty dean of Residen
tial Education would oversee the
academic activities conducted in
student residences, such as dorm
based courses, while "round-the
clock" residential services would
report to Guy.
While critical of its vagueness,
many people have acclaimed the
deanship idea — even to the point
of envisioning a significantly
greater role for such a person in
an administrative structure radi
cally different from Edmond's
plan.
Calling the deanship an "excel
lent idea," Perry said having a
faculty member leading Res Ed
would keep the organization in
touch with the "academic values"
of Stanford. If the dean headed up
the entire organization and it
reported directly to the provost,
so much the better, he says.
"I'd like to see Res Ed brought
under an academic dean not
because I think [residences]
should become more like class
rooms, but because that person
could take a broad-based view" of
the program, says Mancall, a for
mer resident fellow in Arroyo and
Florence Moore Hall.
Others believe having a faculty
member lead Res Ed would give
the organization more legitimacy,
more stature and could bolster
efforts to recruit more faculty to
serve as resident fellows.
"Having faculty leadership
within Res Ed could be extremely
healthy," says Supton.
Perry said he can envision mul
tifarious roles for a faculty dean
of Res Ed, from lending Res Ed a
more "departmental" sense to
improving departmental recogni
tion of faculty who serve as resi
dent fellows. Most importantly,




though, Perry sees the dean as
someone who would be an "advo
cate" for undergraduates and who
would keep the president and
provost abreast of what is happen
ing in the residences.
And while enthusiasm is run
ning high for the post, many orga
nizational and staffing factors
must still be resolved — would
there be a dean and a director? If
so, would there be a philosophical
divide between the program's aca
demic and non-academic func
tions?
"To play the intellectual leader
ship role successfully, you have to
be working with students at all lev
els," says Supton, who noted that
Stanford's approach to students in
residences has traditionally more
integrated than that of Harvard or
Yale.
According to Supton, it may be
difficult to "cut off the heads of
RFs above the ears" and say that
on academic matters, fellows
"relate to this person over here,
but on everything else — drinking.
.. homophobic remarks ... those
things belong somewhere else."
"I do worry about a program
that is supposed to be integrated —
splitting up the organization," says
Norm Robinson. "It weakens the
program the more split and diffuse
the responsibility is."
Finances, too, may be an issue.
Some question whether the dean
ship might cost the program more
money, and wonder whether is it
the best place to allocate money in
a time of tight budgets.
"Certainly, the best place to put
the money is in the residences,"
says Harvey. "I wouldn't like to see
a dean's salary come at the expense
of RF programming funds."
Despite the enthusiasm for

organizational tinkering, many feel
that the recent emphasis on new
positions and administrative
restructuring has put the prover
bial cart before the horse.
"The discussion has focused too
much on names and titles, without
a public discussion of the goals and
objectives of Res Ed," says Norm
Robinson.
"The question we shouldn't be
asking is, 'Is this administratively
more efficient?' " says Harvey.
"The question is, 'Is this the best
and most effective way to meet stu
dents' needs?' "

All the parties are at
the table together
planning, having
their views known,
working together to
make the residential
experience the best
possible.'

ple may be in a really good position
to benefit from interaction with
faculty."
Although aspirations for the
future are running high, ominous
budget forecasts and fears that
high-level administrators don't
understand Res Ed are tempering
optimism that the program can be
revitalized for the '90s and beyond.
"I don't think the decision mak
ers in the administration have
enough experience with Res Ed,"
says Mancall. "If you're not on the
front line, how can you understand
it? ... They must get closer to the
thing about which they are trying
to make decisions."
And as Res Ed goes under
numerous campus microscopes,
many caution that the scrutiny
must not assume too limited a view
of the possible functions and roles
of the organization.
"Res Ed is not about putting one
section of your seminar into 558
(Mayfield) — although the more of
that the better. ... It's about giv
ing people responsibility, giving
them the chance to interact and
learn from each other," says
Kennedy.
"The temptation is to examine
curricular issues, but improving
undergraduate education involves
much more, especially improving
the quality of teaching and sharp
ening departmental accountability
for it."
"We shouldn't define education
too narrowly," says Rob Robinson.
"We're educating students about
being human in modern society."

Is the catfish God's most ignoble
creature?
Stanford's Residential Education
program has always been a little rene
gade, so it was no surprise in the 1980s
when a large crowd turned out to see
Branner Resident Fellow Kennell Jack
son and former Soto RF John Perry de
bate the merits of whiskered bottom
feeders. But while the topic appeared
frivolous, the intellectual discussion it
provoked on campus was anything but

light-hearted.
"People were talking about that for
weeks," says James Lyons, dean of stu
dent affairs from 1972-1990.
While discussions of catfish have
given way to programs on social issues,
Res Ed remains on a different path
than its counterparts at other universi
ties. While students at Harvard and
Yale live out their undergraduate years
in "houses" or "colleges" each with its
own coat of arms and china pattern,
Stanford students shuffle between
freshman dorms, vegetarian co-ops,
ethnic theme houses like Okada and

"focus houses" on everything from
human biology to international rela
tions.
Over the organization's 20 years,
some have questioned the clarity of its
educational mission and the objectives
of its programs, but Res Ed has never
theless become a veritable campus in
stitution. As Res Ed moves into its
third decade, however, many people say
the program is at a crucial point in its
history.
Within the past several years, the
two people who essentially creat
ed Res Ed — former directors
Alice Supton and Norm Robinson
— have left Stanford. Over a four
year period, 30 percent of the pro
gram's budget has been sliced.
And it is unclear whether Res Ed
has fully recovered from accusa
tions in the late 1980s that it had
a "hidden, liberal agenda" that
was "shoving multiculturalism
down students' throats."
Now, more budget cuts loom
on the horizon for Res Ed. Sub
committees of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education and
the Faculty Senate are examining
the program. In January, it was
announced that Res Ed will be
grouped administratively with
Housing and Dining Services, a
move that provoked consterna
tion among resident fellows and
prompted them to suggest alter
native structures.
"Res Ed is at a crossroads,"
says Muwekma-Tah-Ruk Resi
dent Fellow Andrew Lisac, assis
tant dean of continuing studies.
"It needs to be reconceptualized,
reinvigorated. I'd love to decon
struct the whole thing and see a
really broad-based re-examina
tion."
'Understanding the history'
To prepare Res Ed for the
future, those close to the organi
zation say it's important to look
at how and why Res Ed developed
the way it did.
"We've lost our institutional
memory now," says Lyons. "We
don't have the people here to
understand the history, and
that's critical."
While administrative turnover
has been high in the last several
years, many people with histori
cal perspectives — such as Lyons,
Robinson, History Prof. Mark
Mancall and Anthropology Prof.
James Gibbs — still lurk in the
nooks and crannies of Stanford.
In the eyes of Lyons, who came
to Stanford in the early '70s, Res
Ed was forged in the crucible of

'Res Ed is not about
putting one section
of your seminar into
558 (Mayfield). It's
about giving people
responsibility, giv
ing them the chance
to interact and learn
from each other.'
— Donald Kennedy

turbulent national and local
events of the 19605.
"We were coming out of some
really rough times at Stanford —
the burning of Encina (Hall) and
the anti-war rallies," says Lyons.
"I think it was an invigorating
time that caused people to re
examine what Stanford was
doing."
Some of that re-examination
came formally, in the 1968 Study
of Education at Stanford — simi
lar to today's Commission on
Undergraduate Education. That
report recommended residences
which were integrated across
class years; coeducational and sin
gle-sex residences; and the devel
opment of academic and thematic
houses "affording optimal oppor
tunities."
But much re-examination was
prompted by the circumstances of
the times, including the dwin
dling interest in fraternities, the
national move away from in loco
parentis, increasing interest in co
education, the civil rights move
ment and the war in Vietnam,
recalls Lyons.
As fraternity membership
dropped off and their houses were
vacated, the University was
forced to consider what to do with
the buildings, says Lyons. In addi
tion, many Stanford students
were taking advantage of overseas
studies — which were co-ed since
their inception in 1958 — and
returned to campus dissatisfied
with segregated housing.
As more housing opened up,
the University was faced with a
dilemma: should it be standard
ized, even though the facilities
were very different, or should a
variety of living arrangements be
provided?
"I and others realized early on
that Stanford would not take
comfortably to a standardized sit
uation," said Lyons.
In 1967, Stanford's first real
attempt at innovative housing
came when the Phi Delta Theta
fraternity was kicked off campus
for the year. Forced to leave their
house in December 1966, Mancall

'I don't think the
decision makers in
the administration
have enough experi
ence with Res Ed. If
you're not on the
front line, how can
you understand it?'
— Mark Mancall

organized a group of 31 male and
12 female students to move into
the house winter quarter.
Renamed "Grove House," the res
idence was organized around the
idea of "development" and stu
dents took small seminars in the
house. (See related story)
By 1968, several such "experi
mental" houses had cropped up
on campus, and residences
became co-educational "like domi
noes" says Robinson.
Co-operative houses such as
Columbae (a "non-violent protest
house"), Synergy (an "alternative
lifestyle house") and Terra (the
"ecology" house) soon sprouted
from the counterculture move
ment, recalls Robinson. And while
there were a few that failed —
Lyons remembers an "androgy
nous" house that folded a r ter a
year — most have continued until
this day.
Theme houses grew out of the
co-ops. La Maison Francaise was
the first "academic" theme house.
It was followed by La Casa Ital
iana in 1976, Haus Mitteleuropa
in 1978, American Studies and
EAST House. While some depart
ments tried to make these houses
into "departmental parlors,"
Lyons said, "We had to get them
to realize that these places were
first and foremost students'
homes."
Ethnic theme houses originat
ed slightly earlier, on the heels of
the civil rights movement in the
late '60s and early '70s. Following
months of pressure by members
of the Black Student Union and
supporting administrators and
faculty, Cedro was designated the
"Black Concentration House" in
1969.
The house represented a major
coup for black students, who had
sought a sense of community and
gathering place. At the time, only
1 percent of the student popula
tion was black. While the Univer
sity was somewhat skeptical of
the house, "it just worked out
beautifully," Psychiatry Prof.
William Dement, the house's first
resident fellow, said on the 20th
anniversary of the house.
In developing its cadre of resi
dence programs, "one of the
things we wanted to create was —
in what can be a very impersonal,
cool University — a sense of car
ing and inclusiveness," says
Lyons.
The Chicano theme house
came along in 1970, located first
in Roble and later in Stern. In
1972 it settled in its current loca
tion and in 1973 it was dubbed
"Casa Zapata." Asian-American
and Native American house pro
grams began in 1971.
By 1973, "Res Ed" was official
lingo, and the program was on its
way to national recognition.
Days of glory and grief
The '80s ushered in what some
might call the "golden era" of Res
Ed. A favorable economic climate
allowed the construction of Gov
ernor's Corner which included
Sterling Quad and the Suites, cre
ating 800 new housing spaces to
the tune of $36 million. More stu
dents than ever were living on
campus, and expanding budgets
allowed for more staff, more pro
grams and the addition of focus
houses on such topics as gender
and Human Biology.
"There was a period of time, in
the mid-'Bos, when we were able
to add positions like the multicul
tural educator, and resident fel
lows had significantly more
funds," remembers Supton. "In
retrospect, that was a high point
for Res Ed.

"The money was enabling. The
central staff was able to create
programs, .. . bring in speakers,
filmmakers, musicians, authors. .
. . We could create a set of activi
ties and the residence staff could
schedule them."
But while the '80s brought
more resources, they also brought
challenges — one of the most sig
nificant being a ever-more diverse
student body. Increasingly, says
Lyons, Res Ed was looking to pro
mote understanding of a whole
host of issues related to diversity,
including race, religion, sexual
orientation and class.
In his 1988 welcoming address,
former University President Don
ald Kennedy told freshmen: "In
residential education and else
where at Stanford, racial under
standing has properly become a
powerful theme. It is important
for you to acknowledge that
theme and to recognize it as an
integral part of the education you
will receive here, not as some
extracurricular sideshow."
As early as 1987 and 1988, Res
Ed began to draw criticism, as
some students claimed that the
system, in trying to promote
"inclusiveness and open-minded
ness," it was itself closed-minded.
They claimed the Res Ed staff had
a hidden, pro-liberal agenda.
Not really, say some in the sys
tem. "The 'Res Ed agenda' pre
sumes a far greater central orga
nization than ever existed," says
German Prof. Rob Robinson, a
former RF in Roble. Others say
there was an "agenda" to a degree
— an agenda of which they were
proud.
"There was an agenda, in the
sense that there was an agenda of
humanity,... of including all peo
ple for who they were," says Sup
ton. "To the extent that programs
offered a chance to explore simi
larities and differences, I think
that was good.
"If you were encountering the
ideas for the first time, you may
have felt imposed upon."
"Under Donald Kennedy, there
was a huge commitment to diver
sity," says Lyons. "But we spent
so much time doing that, we for
got to turn a mirror on ourselves
and ask 'What kind of a commu
nity do we have here?'
"UCMI did that, and suddenly
we faced a humongous task," says
Lyons. Yet as 1989's report from
the University Committee on
Minority Issues put a formal spot
light on multicultural issues and
recommended more programs,
activities and policy changes, the
same year also brought what
many people have pointed to as
the event that catalyzed "the mul
ticultural backlash:" a speech by
student Ingrid Nava at "The Fire
Within," a freshman Orientation
program, in which she implored
the audience to work for change
in the University.
While many felt Nava crystal
lized the passion and politics of
Stanford's multicultural move
ment, at the same time she
turned off a large number of stu
dents — freshmen and otherwise
— to a movement that had fre
quently challenged the status quo
through dramatic actions and
confrontational rhetoric.
"Some people experienced [The
Fire Within] as hard to hear,"
says Supton. It was a "voice of
alienation, . . . the espousement
of ideas they found challenging,
or accusatory, in some cases."
"The reaction, from that time
on was, 'You're trying to stuff it
down our throats,' " says Lyons.
"I don't think we were trying to
stuff it down throats. I think we

It boils down to
who's on top. Do
you put the
greenskeeper in
charge of the foot
ball coach, or vice
versa?'

were trying to keep some impor
tant issues front and center."
Others say the backlash
stemmed not so much from what
Res Ed tried to do as how it tried
to do it.
"It was sometimes based on
blame and guilt, and that's not
productive," says Larkin Resident
Fellow Sue Harvey.
"I think [educating about
diversity] was a worthwhile goal,"
says Gibbs. "They probably
should've talked less about what
they were doing and simply done
it."
Whether Res Ed — its staff and
its reputation — has fully recov
ered from the backlash is unclear.
"Res Ed tried to understand
what was making people feel
excluded," says Supton. "Because
our goal was to find a place for
everyone. . . . Times changed,
people changed and I think we
recovered."
"There's been an attempt to
move away" from events and
activities that contributed to the
backlash, says Harvey. But other
assaults — budget cuts, Supton's
decision to reduce her position to
half-time, her subsequent depar
ture and other reorganizational
moves put Res Ed essentially in a
continual position of defense and
reaction.
"I think we need to go into a
proactive mode," says Harvey.
A call for action
Ironically, it was yet another
perceived "assault" that has
renewed the call for a thorough
re-examination of Res Ed.
In January, Vice Provost and
Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds announced Res Ed
would be resituated in a unit
headed by Director of Housing
and Dining Services Keith Guy.
Edmonds insists that Res Ed is
not "under" Housing and Dining
Services in the new configuration,
"all the parties are at the table
together planning, having their
views known, working together to
make the residential experience
the best possible."

The discussion has
focused too much
on names and titles,
without a public dis
cussion of the goals
and objectives of
Res Ed.'
— Norm Robinson

But RFs feel the move symbol
izes "a demotion of Reu Ed in the
eyes of the University," says Rob
Robinson.
"It boils down to who's on top,"
says Lyons. "Do you put the
greenskeeper in charge of the
football coach, or vice versa?"
Under Edmonds' proposal, a
half-time faculty dean of Residen
tial Education would oversee the
academic activities conducted in
student residences, such as dorm
based courses, while "round-the
clock" residential services would
report to Guy.
While critical of its vagueness,
many people have acclaimed the
deanship idea — even to the point
of envisioning a significantly
greater role for such a person in
an administrative structure radi
cally different from Edmond's
plan.
Calling the deanship an "excel
lent idea," Perry said having a
faculty member leading Res Ed
would keep the organization in
touch with the "academic values"
of Stanford. If the dean headed up
the entire organization and it
reported directly to the provost,
so much the better, he says.
"I'd like to see Res Ed brought
under an academic dean not
because I think [residences]
should become more like class
rooms, but because that person
could take a broad-based view" of
the program, says Mancall, a for
mer resident fellow in Arroyo and
Florence Moore Hall.
Others believe having a faculty
member lead Res Ed would give
the organization more legitimacy,
more stature and could bolster
efforts to recruit more faculty to
serve as resident fellows.
"Having faculty leadership
within Res Ed could be extremely
healthy," says Supton.
Perry said he can envision mul
tifarious roles for a faculty dean
of Res Ed, from lending Res Ed a
more "departmental" sense to
improving departmental recogni
tion of faculty who serve as resi
dent fellows. Most importantly,




though, Perry sees the dean as
someone who would be an "advo
cate" for undergraduates and who
would keep the president and
provost abreast of what is happen
ing in the residences.
And while enthusiasm is run
ning high for the post, many orga
nizational and staffing factors
must still be resolved — would
there be a dean and a director? If
so, would there be a philosophical
divide between the program's aca
demic and non-academic func
tions?
"To play the intellectual leader
ship role successfully, you have to
be working with students at all lev
els," says Supton, who noted that
Stanford's approach to students in
residences has traditionally more
integrated than that of Harvard or
Yale.
According to Supton, it may be
difficult to "cut off the heads of
RFs above the ears" and say that
on academic matters, fellows
"relate to this person over here,
but on everything else — drinking.
.. homophobic remarks ... those
things belong somewhere else."
"I do worry about a program
that is supposed to be integrated —
splitting up the organization," says
Norm Robinson. "It weakens the
program the more split and diffuse
the responsibility is."
Finances, too, may be an issue.
Some question whether the dean
ship might cost the program more
money, and wonder whether is it
the best place to allocate money in
a time of tight budgets.
"Certainly, the best place to put
the money is in the residences,"
says Harvey. "I wouldn't like to see
a dean's salary come at the expense
of RF programming funds."
Despite the enthusiasm for

organizational tinkering, many feel
that the recent emphasis on new
positions and administrative
restructuring has put the prover
bial cart before the horse.
"The discussion has focused too
much on names and titles, without
a public discussion of the goals and
objectives of Res Ed," says Norm
Robinson.
"The question we shouldn't be
asking is, 'Is this administratively
more efficient?' " says Harvey.
"The question is, 'Is this the best
and most effective way to meet stu
dents' needs?' "

All the parties are at
the table together
planning, having
their views known,
working together to
make the residential
experience the best
possible.'

Toward the future
One group asking those questions
is CUE's subcommittee on aca
demic environment, which is look
ing into Res Ed's academic and
intellectual aspects — such as
dorm-based courses, intellectual
programming, focus houses and
theme houses.
While applauding the attention,
those close to Res Ed say it has
always been difficult to nail down

the "Ed" sense of the organization.
"In some senses, it's vague,
because there is no formal curricu
lum and it's not a discipline," says
Norm Robinson.
Senior Seema Jain, a resident
assistant in Roble, agrees.
"It is ambiguous," says Jain.
"What a lot of people associate with
the 'Ed' is programming, but that's
not what I see as the main thing.
What 'Ed' is depends a lot on your
RA. Every RA is different."
But while the "Ed" may be hard
to sort out, a clearer notion of what
the "Ed" aspect is would give the

program more direction, some say.
"I never really understood what
the academic thrust of Res Ed was,
and I'm not sure, as Res Ed devel
oped, it ever really has thought
about the effects of theme houses,"
says Man call. "It's an institution
searching for a mission.
"I think they never really fig
ured out the role of resident fel
lows," he adds, lamenting that
unlike at Harvard, it is not consid
ered a major honor to be a resident

fellow at Stanford.
"Eventually, I think what hap
pened is that Res Ed became a vest
ed interest in itself," says Man call.
"Although the University said it
eschewed it, Res Ed itself became
in loco parentis.
"Educating people about
racism, sexism. .. became the rai
son d'etre of Res Ed."
Last Thursday, a town hall
meeting on Res Ed and advising
was held in Kimball to solicit stu
dent input, and the subcommittee
has begun meeting with resident
fellows, resident assistants and
others, says CUE member A 1
Camarillo, associate dean of
humanities and sciences.
The subcommittee is also exam
ining responses to senior surveys
and last quarter's Res Ed survey,
and is in the process of formulating
a few more questions which will be
part of a special CUE survey to be
administered before the end of the
year. Focus groups are also being
employed to study Res Ed, Camar
illo said.
While CUE examines the intel
lectual aspects, the Faculty Sen
ate's Subcommittee on Residential
Education and Advising has began
its study of other aspects of Res Ed
— including its student support
functions, its attempt to create a
"pluralistic community," its facili
tation of leadership and responsibil
ity among students. In addition,
SREA will also reconsider the orga
nizational structure of the pro
gram.
Although appearing to work
quite separately, SREA and CUE
are coordinating their efforts, says
Camarillo, who sits on both. SREA
is expected to report directly to the
commission, which is to issue its
report in the fall. How the report
will fit with Edmonds' reorganiza
tion is unclear, but she says her

unit will "have the organizational
flexibility to deal with any recom
mendations from CUE."
While no one is certain what the
examination of Res Ed's funda
mentals will produce, any recom
mendations will have to be crafted
with the knowledge that funding
will be increasingly limited.
With its budget pared down to
$3 million, from more than $4 mil
lion in the 1980s, Res Ed has had to
reduce central office staff, the
number of RAs in residences, RA
salaries and program funds.
According to Acting Residential
Education Co-director Ann Por
teus, student housing, which has a
budget of about $50 million, must
cut about $1 million in this round
of budget cuts. How much of that
will come from Res Ed is undecid
ed, but it is certain to force an even
harder look at what the program
does — especially with regard to
education.
One critical function Res Ed
might play, speculates Harvey,
involves the increasing role of com
puters and other technology in
education at Stanford.
"Technology could make the
residences the real academic cen
ters." says Harvey. "A strong Res
Ed could really help facilitate
that."
As education becomes more and
more expensive — and if Stanford
maintains its commitment to need
blind admissions — Res Ed may
have an even greater role as an
"equalizing force" between stu
dents through its subsidizes of stu
dent programs and activities, says
Perry.
Man call says it is also necessary
to examine whether to integrate
graduate students and undergrad
uates, and also to look at the lack of
integration of foreign graduate stu
dents into the larger population.

Others hope that Res Ed can
simply refine what is has done in
the past. "I always felt that small
er, upperclass houses, with RFs
were probably ideal," says Supton.
"Of course, with budget cuts, it's
hard to afford this, but I think that
beyond the acclimation year, peo
ple may be in a really good position
to benefit from interaction with
faculty."
Although aspirations for the
future are running high, ominous
budget forecasts and fears that
high-level administrators don't
understand Res Ed are tempering
optimism that the program can be
revitalized for the '90s and beyond.
"I don't think the decision mak
ers in the administration have
enough experience with Res Ed,"
says Mancall. "If you're not on the
front line, how can you understand
it? ... They must get closer to the
thing about which they are trying
to make decisions."
And as Res Ed goes under
numerous campus microscopes,
many caution that the scrutiny
must not assume too limited a view
of the possible functions and roles
of the organization.
"Res Ed is not about putting one
section of your seminar into 558
(Mayfield) — although the more of
that the better. ... It's about giv
ing people responsibility, giving
them the chance to interact and
learn from each other," says
Kennedy.
"The temptation is to examine
curricular issues, but improving
undergraduate education involves
much more, especially improving
the quality of teaching and sharp
ening departmental accountability
for it."
"We shouldn't define education
too narrowly," says Rob Robinson.
"We're educating students about

tion, many Stanford students
were taking advantage of overseas
studies — which were co-ed since
their inception in 1958 — and
returned to campus dissatisfied
with segregated housing.
As more housing opened up,
the University was faced with a
dilemma: should it be standard
ized, even though the facilities
were very different, or should a
variety of living arrangements be
provided?
"I and others realized early on
that Stanford would not take
comfortably to a standardized sit
uation," said Lyons.
In 1967, Stanford's first real
attempt at innovative housing
came when the Phi Delta Theta
fraternity was kicked off campus
for the year. Forced to leave their
house in December 1966, Mancall

'I don't think the
decision makers in
the administration
have enough experi
ence with Res Ed. If
you're not on the
front line, how can
you understand it?'
— Mark Mancall

organized a group of 31 male and
12 female students to move into
the house winter quarter.
Renamed "Grove House," the res
idence was organized around the
idea of "development" and stu
dents took small seminars in the
house. (See related story)
By 1968, several such "experi
mental" houses had cropped up
on campus, and residences
became co-educational "like domi
noes" says Robinson.
Co-operative houses such as
Columbae (a "non-violent protest
house"), Synergy (an "alternative
lifestyle house") and Terra (the
"ecology" house) soon sprouted
from the counterculture move
ment, recalls Robinson. And while
there were a few that failed —
Lyons remembers an "androgy
nous" house that folded a r ter a
year — most have continued until
this day.
Theme houses grew out of the
co-ops. La Maison Francaise was
the first "academic" theme house.
It was followed by La Casa Ital
iana in 1976, Haus Mitteleuropa
in 1978, American Studies and
EAST House. While some depart
ments tried to make these houses
into "departmental parlors,"
Lyons said, "We had to get them
to realize that these places were
first and foremost students'
homes."
Ethnic theme houses originat
ed slightly earlier, on the heels of
the civil rights movement in the
late '60s and early '70s. Following
months of pressure by members
of the Black Student Union and
supporting administrators and
faculty, Cedro was designated the
"Black Concentration House" in
1969.
The house represented a major
coup for black students, who had
sought a sense of community and
gathering place. At the time, only
1 percent of the student popula
tion was black. While the Univer
sity was somewhat skeptical of
the house, "it just worked out
beautifully," Psychiatry Prof.
William Dement, the house's first
resident fellow, said on the 20th
anniversary of the house.
In developing its cadre of resi
dence programs, "one of the
things we wanted to create was —
in what can be a very impersonal,
cool University — a sense of car
ing and inclusiveness," says
Lyons.
The Chicano theme house
came along in 1970, located first
in Roble and later in Stern. In
1972 it settled in its current loca
tion and in 1973 it was dubbed
"Casa Zapata." Asian-American
and Native American house pro
grams began in 1971.
By 1973, "Res Ed" was official
lingo, and the program was on its
way to national recognition.
Days of glory and grief
The '80s ushered in what some
might call the "golden era" of Res
Ed. A favorable economic climate
allowed the construction of Gov
ernor's Corner which included
Sterling Quad and the Suites, cre
ating 800 new housing spaces to
the tune of $36 million. More stu
dents than ever were living on
campus, and expanding budgets
allowed for more staff, more pro
grams and the addition of focus
houses on such topics as gender
and Human Biology.
"There was a period of time, in
the mid-'Bos, when we were able
to add positions like the multicul
tural educator, and resident fel
lows had significantly more
funds," remembers Supton. "In
retrospect, that was a high point
for Res Ed.

"The money was enabling. The
central staff was able to create
programs, .. . bring in speakers,
filmmakers, musicians, authors. .
. . We could create a set of activi
ties and the residence staff could
schedule them."
But while the '80s brought
more resources, they also brought
challenges — one of the most sig
nificant being a ever-more diverse
student body. Increasingly, says
Lyons, Res Ed was looking to pro
mote understanding of a whole
host of issues related to diversity,
including race, religion, sexual
orientation and class.
In his 1988 welcoming address,
former University President Don
ald Kennedy told freshmen: "In
residential education and else
where at Stanford, racial under
standing has properly become a
powerful theme. It is important
for you to acknowledge that
theme and to recognize it as an
integral part of the education you
will receive here, not as some
extracurricular sideshow."
As early as 1987 and 1988, Res
Ed began to draw criticism, as
some students claimed that the
system, in trying to promote
"inclusiveness and open-minded
ness," it was itself closed-minded.
They claimed the Res Ed staff had
a hidden, pro-liberal agenda.
Not really, say some in the sys
tem. "The 'Res Ed agenda' pre
sumes a far greater central orga
nization than ever existed," says
German Prof. Rob Robinson, a
former RF in Roble. Others say
there was an "agenda" to a degree
— an agenda of which they were
proud.
"There was an agenda, in the
sense that there was an agenda of
humanity,... of including all peo
ple for who they were," says Sup
ton. "To the extent that programs
offered a chance to explore simi
larities and differences, I think
that was good.
"If you were encountering the
ideas for the first time, you may
have felt imposed upon."
"Under Donald Kennedy, there
was a huge commitment to diver
sity," says Lyons. "But we spent
so much time doing that, we for
got to turn a mirror on ourselves
and ask 'What kind of a commu
nity do we have here?'
"UCMI did that, and suddenly
we faced a humongous task," says
Lyons. Yet as 1989's report from
the University Committee on
Minority Issues put a formal spot
light on multicultural issues and
recommended more programs,
activities and policy changes, the
same year also brought what
many people have pointed to as
the event that catalyzed "the mul
ticultural backlash:" a speech by
student Ingrid Nava at "The Fire
Within," a freshman Orientation
program, in which she implored
the audience to work for change
in the University.
While many felt Nava crystal
lized the passion and politics of
Stanford's multicultural move
ment, at the same time she
turned off a large number of stu
dents — freshmen and otherwise
— to a movement that had fre
quently challenged the status quo
through dramatic actions and
confrontational rhetoric.
"Some people experienced [The
Fire Within] as hard to hear,"
says Supton. It was a "voice of
alienation, . . . the espousement
of ideas they found challenging,
or accusatory, in some cases."
"The reaction, from that time
on was, 'You're trying to stuff it
down our throats,' " says Lyons.
"I don't think we were trying to
stuff it down throats. I think we

It boils down to
who's on top. Do
you put the
greenskeeper in
charge of the foot
ball coach, or vice
versa?'
— James Lyons

were trying to keep some impor
tant issues front and center."
Others say the backlash
stemmed not so much from what
Res Ed tried to do as how it tried
to do it.
"It was sometimes based on
blame and guilt, and that's not
productive," says Larkin Resident
Fellow Sue Harvey.
"I think [educating about
diversity] was a worthwhile goal,"
says Gibbs. "They probably
should've talked less about what
they were doing and simply done
it."
Whether Res Ed — its staff and
its reputation — has fully recov
ered from the backlash is unclear.
"Res Ed tried to understand
what was making people feel
excluded," says Supton. "Because
our goal was to find a place for
everyone. . . . Times changed,
people changed and I think we
recovered."
"There's been an attempt to
move away" from events and
activities that contributed to the
backlash, says Harvey. But other
assaults — budget cuts, Supton's
decision to reduce her position to
half-time, her subsequent depar
ture and other reorganizational
moves put Res Ed essentially in a
continual position of defense and
reaction.
"I think we need to go into a
proactive mode," says Harvey.
A call for action
Ironically, it was yet another
perceived "assault" that has
renewed the call for a thorough
re-examination of Res Ed.
In January, Vice Provost and
Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds announced Res Ed
would be resituated in a unit
headed by Director of Housing
and Dining Services Keith Guy.
Edmonds insists that Res Ed is
not "under" Housing and Dining
Services in the new configuration,
"all the parties are at the table
together planning, having their
views known, working together to
make the residential experience
the best possible."

The discussion has
focused too much
on names and titles,
without a public dis
cussion of the goals
and objectives of
Res Ed.'
— Norm Robinson

But RFs feel the move symbol
izes "a demotion of Reu Ed in the
eyes of the University," says Rob
Robinson.
"It boils down to who's on top,"
says Lyons. "Do you put the
greenskeeper in charge of the
football coach, or vice versa?"
Under Edmonds' proposal, a
half-time faculty dean of Residen
tial Education would oversee the
academic activities conducted in
student residences, such as dorm
based courses, while "round-the
clock" residential services would
report to Guy.
While critical of its vagueness,
many people have acclaimed the
deanship idea — even to the point
of envisioning a significantly
greater role for such a person in
an administrative structure radi
cally different from Edmond's
plan.
Calling the deanship an "excel
lent idea," Perry said having a
faculty member leading Res Ed
would keep the organization in
touch with the "academic values"
of Stanford. If the dean headed up
the entire organization and it
reported directly to the provost,
so much the better, he says.
"I'd like to see Res Ed brought
under an academic dean not
because I think [residences]
should become more like class
rooms, but because that person
could take a broad-based view" of
the program, says Mancall, a for
mer resident fellow in Arroyo and
Florence Moore Hall.
Others believe having a faculty
member lead Res Ed would give
the organization more legitimacy,
more stature and could bolster
efforts to recruit more faculty to
serve as resident fellows.
"Having faculty leadership
within Res Ed could be extremely
healthy," says Supton.
Perry said he can envision mul
tifarious roles for a faculty dean
of Res Ed, from lending Res Ed a
more "departmental" sense to
improving departmental recogni
tion of faculty who serve as resi
dent fellows. Most importantly,




though, Perry sees the dean as
someone who would be an "advo
cate" for undergraduates and who
would keep the president and
provost abreast of what is happen
ing in the residences.
And while enthusiasm is run
ning high for the post, many orga
nizational and staffing factors
must still be resolved — would
there be a dean and a director? If
so, would there be a philosophical
divide between the program's aca
demic and non-academic func
tions?
"To play the intellectual leader
ship role successfully, you have to
be working with students at all lev
els," says Supton, who noted that
Stanford's approach to students in
residences has traditionally more
integrated than that of Harvard or
Yale.
According to Supton, it may be
difficult to "cut off the heads of
RFs above the ears" and say that
on academic matters, fellows
"relate to this person over here,
but on everything else — drinking.
.. homophobic remarks ... those
things belong somewhere else."
"I do worry about a program
that is supposed to be integrated —
splitting up the organization," says
Norm Robinson. "It weakens the
program the more split and diffuse
the responsibility is."
Finances, too, may be an issue.
Some question whether the dean
ship might cost the program more
money, and wonder whether is it
the best place to allocate money in
a time of tight budgets.
"Certainly, the best place to put
the money is in the residences,"
says Harvey. "I wouldn't like to see
a dean's salary come at the expense
of RF programming funds."
Despite the enthusiasm for

organizational tinkering, many feel
that the recent emphasis on new
positions and administrative
restructuring has put the prover
bial cart before the horse.
"The discussion has focused too
much on names and titles, without
a public discussion of the goals and
objectives of Res Ed," says Norm
Robinson.
"The question we shouldn't be
asking is, 'Is this administratively
more efficient?' " says Harvey.
"The question is, 'Is this the best
and most effective way to meet stu
dents' needs?' "

All the parties are at
the table together
planning, having
their views known,
working together to
make the residential
experience the best
possible.'

Toward the future
One group asking those questions
is CUE's subcommittee on aca
demic environment, which is look
ing into Res Ed's academic and
intellectual aspects — such as
dorm-based courses, intellectual
programming, focus houses and
theme houses.
While applauding the attention,
those close to Res Ed say it has
always been difficult to nail down

the "Ed" sense of the organization.
"In some senses, it's vague,
because there is no formal curricu
lum and it's not a discipline," says
Norm Robinson.
Senior Seema Jain, a resident
assistant in Roble, agrees.
"It is ambiguous," says Jain.
"What a lot of people associate with
the 'Ed' is programming, but that's
not what I see as the main thing.
What 'Ed' is depends a lot on your
RA. Every RA is different."
But while the "Ed" may be hard
to sort out, a clearer notion of what
the "Ed" aspect is would give the

program more direction, some say.
"I never really understood what
the academic thrust of Res Ed was,
and I'm not sure, as Res Ed devel
oped, it ever really has thought
about the effects of theme houses,"
says Man call. "It's an institution
searching for a mission.
"I think they never really fig
ured out the role of resident fel
lows," he adds, lamenting that
unlike at Harvard, it is not consid
ered a major honor to be a resident

fellow at Stanford.
"Eventually, I think what hap
pened is that Res Ed became a vest
ed interest in itself," says Man call.
"Although the University said it
eschewed it, Res Ed itself became
in loco parentis.
"Educating people about
racism, sexism. .. became the rai
son d'etre of Res Ed."
Last Thursday, a town hall
meeting on Res Ed and advising
was held in Kimball to solicit stu
dent input, and the subcommittee
has begun meeting with resident
fellows, resident assistants and
others, says CUE member A 1
Camarillo, associate dean of
humanities and sciences.
The subcommittee is also exam
ining responses to senior surveys
and last quarter's Res Ed survey,
and is in the process of formulating
a few more questions which will be
part of a special CUE survey to be
administered before the end of the
year. Focus groups are also being
employed to study Res Ed, Camar
illo said.
While CUE examines the intel
lectual aspects, the Faculty Sen
ate's Subcommittee on Residential
Education and Advising has began
its study of other aspects of Res Ed
— including its student support
functions, its attempt to create a
"pluralistic community," its facili
tation of leadership and responsibil
ity among students. In addition,
SREA will also reconsider the orga
nizational structure of the pro
gram.
Although appearing to work
quite separately, SREA and CUE
are coordinating their efforts, says
Camarillo, who sits on both. SREA
is expected to report directly to the
commission, which is to issue its
report in the fall. How the report
will fit with Edmonds' reorganiza
tion is unclear, but she says her

unit will "have the organizational
flexibility to deal with any recom
mendations from CUE."
While no one is certain what the
examination of Res Ed's funda
mentals will produce, any recom
mendations will have to be crafted
with the knowledge that funding
will be increasingly limited.
With its budget pared down to
$3 million, from more than $4 mil
lion in the 1980s, Res Ed has had to
reduce central office staff, the
number of RAs in residences, RA
salaries and program funds.
According to Acting Residential
Education Co-director Ann Por
teus, student housing, which has a
budget of about $50 million, must
cut about $1 million in this round
of budget cuts. How much of that
will come from Res Ed is undecid
ed, but it is certain to force an even
harder look at what the program
does — especially with regard to
education.
One critical function Res Ed
might play, speculates Harvey,
involves the increasing role of com
puters and other technology in
education at Stanford.
"Technology could make the
residences the real academic cen
ters." says Harvey. "A strong Res
Ed could really help facilitate
that."
As education becomes more and
more expensive — and if Stanford
maintains its commitment to need
blind admissions — Res Ed may
have an even greater role as an
"equalizing force" between stu
dents through its subsidizes of stu
dent programs and activities, says
Perry.
Man call says it is also necessary
to examine whether to integrate
graduate students and undergrad
uates, and also to look at the lack of
integration of foreign graduate stu
dents into the larger population.

Others hope that Res Ed can
simply refine what is has done in
the past. "I always felt that small
er, upperclass houses, with RFs
were probably ideal," says Supton.
"Of course, with budget cuts, it's
hard to afford this, but I think that
beyond the acclimation year, peo
ple may be in a really good position
to benefit from interaction with
faculty."
Although aspirations for the
future are running high, ominous
budget forecasts and fears that
high-level administrators don't
understand Res Ed are tempering
optimism that the program can be
revitalized for the '90s and beyond.
"I don't think the decision mak
ers in the administration have
enough experience with Res Ed,"
says Mancall. "If you're not on the
front line, how can you understand
it? ... They must get closer to the
thing about which they are trying
to make decisions."
And as Res Ed goes under
numerous campus microscopes,
many caution that the scrutiny
must not assume too limited a view
of the possible functions and roles
of the organization.
"Res Ed is not about putting one
section of your seminar into 558
(Mayfield) — although the more of
that the better. ... It's about giv
ing people responsibility, giving
them the chance to interact and
learn from each other," says
Kennedy.
"The temptation is to examine
curricular issues, but improving
undergraduate education involves
much more, especially improving
the quality of teaching and sharp
ening departmental accountability
for it."
"We shouldn't define education
too narrowly," says Rob Robinson.
"We're educating students about
being human in modern society."
