"Greedy" might not be the worst movie
ever, but it isn't for want of trying.
An aggressively unfunny movie, "Greedy"
is essentially a remake of the early '80s TV
show "Filthy Rich," in itself one of the great
est blows to Western culture since the fall of
Rome. However, "Greedy" surpasses its tele
vised predecessor in its expedition into the
depths of bad taste.
The tale of scrap metal tycoon Uncle Joe
(Kirk Douglas), his $25 million fortune and
the several venal relatives attempting to es
tablish a pecking order in Joe's will, "Greedy"
pulls out all of the predicted stops — bath
room jokes, partial nudity, etc. — in an at
tempt to create a successful comedy. The end
result, however, is more like a sick turkey
flapping its wings in a futile attempt to fly.
The movie begins with four of Joe's nieces
and nephews (Phil Hartman, Colleen Camp,
Ed Begley, Jr. and Jere Burns) fighting for
placement in the will. However, their
schemes are interrupted by the appearance
of Molly (Olivia d'Abo), a pert British nurse,
to whom they fear Joe will leave everything.
Enter Michael J. Fox, a long-lost rela
tive/professional bowler named Danny, who at
first displays none of the venality of the other

relatives. From there, it is a predictable descent
into Danny vs. Molly vs. evil relatives for con
trol over the old mans heart, mind and wallet.
This conflict reaches several denoue
ments, each more ridiculous than the last.
Will Danny be able to acquire his heart's de
sire, a mega-bowling alley on I.ong Island? Is
Molly looking out for Joe's money or his wel
fare? Will half the seats in the audience be full
by movies end?
It's awfully difficult to quantify just how
bad "Greedy" is. The acting is bad; the di
recting is bad; the screenplay is bad; even the
makeup is bad. Badness emanates from
every scene, every line. OK, maybe not
everything was bad. Levon Besnelian's work
as key grip was excellent.
But even that's being generous.
