# Enigma loses steam
## Cheesy mix of chants and hip-hop is disappointing 
### 
Four years ago Enigma burst onto the
music scene with an entirely new sound. The
album, "MCMXC a.D.", was a wildly success
ful mix of hip-hop beats and Gregorian
chants, a libido-streaked testament to late
night ambiance. Headman Curly MC had
creatcd something different but he was
couching it in heady and familiar sex appeal.
That debut album began with a woman's
sultry voice, the "Voice of Enigma," wishing
us "Good evening." We were to turn off the
lights and "let the rhythm be our guiding
light." The ensuing "Principles of Lust," con
taining the hit single "Sadeness," was a gor
geous mix of bass heavy beats and lilting
chants.
Enigma's success was due in a large part to
its pairing of opposing musical ideas: hip-hop
and Ciregorian chants. The surface was sooth
ing and meditative, with reed flutes weaving
through sampled chants, but just beneath were
carnal, bass-heavy rhythms. Enigma offered
these opposites laid over with the allure of sex
and creatcd a steamy meditation.
While "MCMXC a.D." delved into the
spiritual bedroom, Enigma's latest release,
" The Cross of Changes," travels different
ground. The result is another competent ren
dering of ambiance and groove but without
the turn-on. While the music is interesting it
still feels like some kind of ambient coitus in
terruptus.
The new album begins in the same way as
the last one with a short instrumental called
"Second Chapter." The strange Eastern
sounding instruments are still there; the fe
male "Voice of Enigma" is still there (even if
it's a bit less sultry).
In the next track, another instrumental
called "The Eyes of Truth," Enigma hits its

stride. Chanting and the ever-present reed
flute swirl above a crushing drum track. This
is Enigma at its best, and while it may not be
as rampantly sexual as "The Principles of
I.ust," the drama here is equally as intense.
The song culminates in booming timpani
drums matched with a full choir, singing for
all the world like they've just seen God.
The album goes downhill from there.
What was dramatic early on quickly descends
into evangelical melodrama. The problem
here is the singing. Curly MC has gotten into
his head that he must write lyrics and then
sing them himself. The result is embarrassing.
"Ifyou want, then start to laugh / Ifyoumust,
then start to cry / Be yourself don't hide / Just
believe in destiny." This and other bits of lyri
cal profundity, probably stolen from fortune
cookies, cheapen the album.
One exception is the track "Silent War
rior." Here Curly MC's lyrics somehow re
main one step away from cheeseball through
out. 1 le describes the exploitation of native
cultures by the white man. "They tried to
fight for liberty / Without a chance in hell,
they gave up / White men won in the name of
God / With the cross as alibi / There's no God
who ever tried / To change the world in this
way." These lyrics are surrounded by Native
American chants and the characteristic ex
plosive rhythms.
However, the rest of the album doesn't
match up. It's hard to take a song called "The
Dream of the Dolphin" seriously despite the
cheery environmental sound-bites and Dis
ney-esque piano solos. Even worse is "Out of
the Deep," an overly enthusiastic ditty ex
plaining the purpose of our existence (some
thing original like loving and helping).
The inane "Age of Loneliness (Carly's

Song)," from last year's movie "Sliver," with
its "thought provoking" lyrics ("Carly don't
be sad / Life is crazy / Life is mad / Don't be
afraid") should have died with the film. The
last track, "Cross of Changes," ends on an ap
propriately flaccid note with no beat, just a
spacey sampling of synth-noise over a lilting
piano.
It seems this kind of "ambient" music is
just a trend with the staying power of week

old milk. Enigma's first album was a steam
bath of sexual rhythm and eerie chanting.
Sure it was pretentious, but still quite a turn
on.
While "The Cross of Changes" certainly
has its moments, on the whole it's melodrama
at its worst. It's as if Enigma suddenly turned
the lights on, switched on a de-humidifier,
and ruined the mood.

Enigma's second release 'The Cross of Changes" features some of the same charac
teristic steamy material as the first. But it isn't quite the same fantastic, red-light album
on the whole.
