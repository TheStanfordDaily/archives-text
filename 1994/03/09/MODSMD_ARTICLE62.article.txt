## "Fear Itself" Casual 
### 
The most insular and mysterious of any of
the babies to emerge from Del The Funky
Homosapien's School for Gifted Youngsters,
"Fear Itself" proves Casual to be anything
but laid back. Instead he's a vicious freestyler
with boundless energy, a trench runner who
wields his lyrical gift the way the X-Men's
Wolverine flexes his razor-sharp adaman
tium claws.
As is the case with all of the latest Oak
land-based Hieroglyphic releases, Casual's

rip-rowling flow is
supported by
jaz7./funk fortifed up
right basslines, flut
tering horns, and
startling rhymes. Un
like the Souls Of Mis
chief, his beats hold
little melodically
pleasant sounds for
the ear but lend the
perfect springboard
for him to catapult
his vicious lyrics. His

gripping rhymes, despite the funky beats, are
the real shining point here.
"Me-o-Bi-o," with its bouncing bass-line,
is the first track to get the ball rolling with
some momentum, but not until "That's How
It Is" does the rhymer's overwhelming talent
come to light. His staggering confidence
makes it one of the most compelling battle
rhymes since "Rock The Bells," with boasts
and verbal challenges ("Mo' Niggas got my
back than Rodney King") that might even
make the ego-centric KRS check his head.
Dels horn-laced production propels him
forward that much faster. The gangsta
mackin' "1 Didn't Mean To," smooved out
radio-friendly slickness of "We Got It Like
That" and compelling "Thoughts of the
Thoughtful" all dazzle, but the segues, short
as they are, push the album in even more in
ventive directions. Hearing Saffir the Saucy
Nomad rip "That's Bullshit" to death-defying
shreds makes a strong argument for a live,
completely spontaneous freestyle album.
There's absolutely nothing to fear from
"Fear Itself." Casual makes an impressive
debut that makes one thirst for more releases
from him and the rest of his crew. Oakland
freestyle is cemented by this album — hillbil
lies, country accents and all that!
