# "Imaginary Friend" Th' Faith Healers
## 
### 
If shoegazer is what you think of when
you think of the United Kingdom, think
again. Th* Faith Healers UK is one of the
Bands of the New Noise.
Th' Faith Healers' amps spit guitar chaos
at the walls. They have an intensity you can
feel in your veins as the chords conjure a
trance. Your ears are warm for hours after
the headphones hit the floor.
Their 1992 release, "Lido," is a great intro
duction to their method. On a first listen it
simply sounds repetitious. The lyrics are
rarely longer than two lines that are repeated
like a mantra. But on the second or third lis
ten, the doors open and you can notice the
real changes. It's not in the chords, it's in the
way they play them.
"Imaginary Friend" is a similarly com
pelling piece. They haven't lost their intensi
ty, they've merely channeled it. Where
"Lido" had ten songs clocking in at 51 min
utes, "Imaginary Friend" has seven songs
filling 72 minutes.
The first song, "Sparklingly Chime,"
sounds deceptively cute for the first three

seconds. Then the guitar comes in and carves
a new meaning for the phrase "power
chord."
The lead-in to the second song, "Heart
Fog," is also deceptively tame. Vocalist Rox
anne Stephen's lyrics are plain and honest.
But as the song builds, the emotions start to
boil. The music carries the message as what
seems like calm observation is repeated and
transformed into angst.
In the final song they really push the lim
its of reason. "Everything, All at Once, For
ever" has two chords, is 28 minutes long and
has a 12-minute intermission.
But, who's worried about being reason
able? They're probably two of the baddest
chords I've ever heard. If you get bored you
can skip to track eight and catch the eight
minute return.
Th' Faith Healers don't depend as much
on the melody as they do on the textures and
the rhythms which are created by the inter
play between the vocals, the guitars, and the
drums, particularly in songs like "The Peo
ple" and "See-Saw." Along with bands like
Moonshake and Stereolab and artists like PI
Harvey, Th' Faith Healers are radically re
defining what should be expected from
music.
