# A
						tale of two smoothies
## Move over milkshake — now there's something leaner! 
### Rob Ross 
It's a testament to the influence
of the state of California that its
name is now a verb. You can now
"Californize" things. Take, for ex
ample, the hamburger. Californize
it, and you've got the tofu burger.
The newest victim of "Cali
fornization" the that good old
American standard, the milkshake.
A gift of the first cow to cross the
Atlantic, the milkshake had been
flourishing in this country for two
hundred years. Then calamity
struck. Responding to the call for
more nutritious, yet tasty bever
ages, practitioners of the art of Cal
ifornia cuisine got hold of the milk
shake and Californized it. The
product was the smoothie, now the
chic-est beverage in Palo Alto.
1 found that everyone has their

own definition of a smoothie.
Some places use typical fruits —
strawberries, bananas, and blue
berries. Others use the more exotic
cherry, guanabana and tamarind.
Some stores use lowfat frozen yo
gurt as a base, while others go the
nonfat route, or don't use any yo
gurt at all (creating a watery, thin
drink). Finally, some smoothie cre
ators dive into the ultra-healthy
pool, dumping everything your
mother told you to eat into their
beverage, from wheat germ to gin
seng. Others just tend to the stan
dard "ice plus fruit plus frozen yo
gurt equals smoothie" equation.
With retailers so specialized, it is
impossible to recommend one
store to fill all your smoothie needs.
But the Juice Club should come

pretty darn close.
Located in the Town and Coun
try Village on El Camino, Juice Club
is the little store with the big line that
always seems to extend out the door
and onto the sidewalk With ten
servers working like bees in a hive,
though, the line shortens quickly.
From the ultra-healthy (and
ultra-PC) Ironman/Woman to the
unexpectedly tangy Boysenberry
Blitz, Juice Club has the biggest
smoothie selection in the area. The
fruit choices range from strawberry
and banana to the more exotic date
and guava. Each drink fills a 24-
ounce cup and runs about $3, with
extremes at $3.95 and $2.65.
At 483 University Ave. near CD
Land, Mango Cafe offers a few more
exotic choices. It specializes in the

cuisine of Jamaica,
Trinidad and Tobago
and, for about $2.95,
provides a twist off
the Juice Club theme.
The smoothies here
have no frozen yogurt
base, but are made
simply of crushed
fruits and canned
juices.
The fruits the
Mango Cafe offers are
the fruits of the
Caribbean — mango,
tamarind, guana-

bana, guava and pineapple — and
they blend these five in 18 various
ways to form the cafe's specialty
drinks. These 18 are an interesting
change, although less healthy, from

Recommendation:
Healthy smoothies can be tasty and re
freshing, but it's also nice to indulge in a
milkshake once in a while.

the heavier offerings of Juice Club.
While the health food craze is
nice, I tend to remain un-Cali
fornized." 1 prefer a good, old
fashioned milkshake. ■
