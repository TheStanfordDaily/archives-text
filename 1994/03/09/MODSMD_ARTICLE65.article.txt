### 
8 Seconds
Sure, a rodeo movie starring Luke
Perry won't be garnering any Oscar
nominations. But for what it is, "8
Seconds" is a charming flick with
broad-based appeal. Throw in
some excellent live action rodeo se
quences and a few corny yet heart
ening cowboy aphorisms and
you've got a movie that's worth the
ticket price. PG-13
Ace Ventura, Pet Detective
As the star of a movie featuring a
predictable plot and bad acting,
comic Jim Carrey carries the bur
den of turning "Ace Ventura" from
another piece of trash into some
thing worth the price of a matinee
ticket. Although his wacky pet de
tective character wears thin at
points, Carrey succeeds in achiev
ing very, very, very modest goals.
PG-13
The Accompanist
As the latest French film about
beautiful, tormented people in the
world of classical music, "The Ac
companist" proves to be an en
grossing stroll through that never
never land. Still, any story set in
Nazi-occupied Paris should have
some historical focus. Unfortunate

ly, that reality is marginalized in this
bittersweet love story. PG
Blue Chips
You don't need to be a big-time
basketball fan to enjoy "Blue
Chips." Nick Nolte does a good job
playing the prototypic crazed bas
ketball coach caught between
ethics and winning. The athletes
chosen to play parts do a good job
playing themselves. Of note is
Shaquille O'Neal's acting debut; the
multi-media monster does quite a
good job playing a sarcastic and
clueless character. PG-13
The Cement Garden
Surely a movie about sibling sexual
relations raises many an eyebrow.
Yet "The Cement Garden" tells a far
from trite and sensational story; fine
acting, appropriate settings and a
perfect score make for a beautiful
and haunting work of art. UNRAT
ED
The Getaway
Get away with "The Getaway?" If
you're looking for a good
actionAhriller, you like Alec Baldwin
and Kim Basinger and you've got
an afternoon and four bucks to
burn, this might just be what you're

looking for. Otherwise, maybe you
should stay home and rent the origi
nal version of the movie, starring
Steve McQueen and Allie McGraw
as the husband/wife crime duo. R
In the Name of the Father
Despite appearances by Academy
Award-winning actors Daniel Day-
Lewis and Emma Thompson, "In
the Name of the Father" rarely rises
above melodrama. Instead of focus
ing on how violence can destroy the
life of an everyman, director Jim
Sheridan takes on a well-worn per
spective, opting for courtroom
drama straight out of "L.A. Law" and
"Perry Mason." R
Reality Bites
So what if "Reality Bites" is another
movie about twenty-somethings
struggling in the post-college
world? Although no shining rays of
wisdom are revealed in the movie,
"Reality Bites" is a fun movie with a
refreshing sense of humor. It's im
mediate enough for us college stu
dents to forgive its minor flaws. PG
-13
Savage Nights
An autobiographic film about love
and AIDS, "Savage Nights" packs

emotional punch few movies on the
topic can. To add to the realism,
writer Cyril Collard not only directs
the action, but also stars in this
highly-acclaimed French import.
Despite the riveting performances,
the lack of a cohesive plot makes
the two-hour work a difficult one to
follow. Unrated
The Scent of Green Papaya
This beautifully filmed movie, nomi
nated for the Best Foreign Film
Oscar, chronicles 10 years in the life
of a peasant girl raised to be a ser
vant. Although the plot seems thin
at points, the lovely visuals more
than makes up for the holes in the
story. First-time director Tran Anh
Hung's camera makes poetry from
tedious details of everyday life. Un
rated
What's Eating Gilbert Grape?
"Gilbert Grape" isn't just another
trite, "coming-of-age" flick. It's a
fresh portrayal of how reclusive
Gilbert (Johnny Depp) emerges
from the burdens of family life to
find love. The performances are ex
cellent: Leonard DiCapricio, who
plays Gilbert's mentally retarded
brother, may receive an Oscar nom
ination for his riveting work. PG-13
