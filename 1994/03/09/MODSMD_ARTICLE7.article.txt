# Melting pot?
## Casper concerns himself with 'Culture and Cultures' 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
At a San Francisco forum broadcast on National
Public Radio last Friday, University President Ger
hard Casper defended some of Stanford's controver
sial multicultural policies after delivering a speech ti
tled "Concerning Culture and Cultures."
Using a slightly modified version of his welcome
speech to freshmen last September, Casper spent a
half-hour addressing the perception that multicul
turalism — particularly in the form of ethnic sepa
ratism — is in conflict with the time-honored goal of
an American "melting pot."
"It is not for the University in its institutional role
to tell students to blend in or to remain separate, to
embrace an 'amalgam' or to reject
it,"he said. "It should not be Uni
versity policy to mold students in
a particular way."
But the 250-plus members of
the Commonwealth Club of Cali
fornia — a group that brings speak
ers to their meetings for discus
sions of selected issues — seemed
more interested in the 20-minute
question-and-answer period after
the speech, in which Casper
responded to some Stanford-specif
ic questions ranging from the
three-year plan to the Cultures,
Ideas and Values controversy.
In most cases, Casper either
responded by saying that the mat
ter was out of his hands or not to
be discussed publicly — such as
the return of the F grade and
salary differences — or defended
Stanford's policies.
His most well-received com

ments concerned the national
attention given to the change
from Western Civilization to CIV,
which he said "had vastly misrep
resented what was actually hap
pening at Stanford. The set of
changes were relatively modest,
and indeed, a large part of the
readings that was taught at Stan
ford before the changes is still
being taught at Stanford."
Justifying the need for a more
diverse canon of works, Casper
said, "We are about as far
removed from Greece of the fifth
century B.C. as we are removed
from anything. That was a cul
ture with its sacrifices, with its
slaves, with its discrimination
against women that is very alien
to the present world and the
notion that it can be the only one
that captures the kind of prob
lems we have in front of us seems
to me .. . superficial."
Casper also defended Stanford
in response to a question implying
that academic quality at Stanford
had been adversely affected by the

multicultural movement.
"In many ways [the multicul
tural movement 1 has made the
academic environment much rich
er because lots of questions are
now . . . being asked that were
ignored in the past," he said.
In addition, Casper discussed
the fallacy of the "myth that is
out there that American universi
ties in the past were uninhibited,
robust and wide open in intellec
tual debate while at present they
are threatened by political cor
rectness and other trend. I should
like to remind you that that gold
en age never quite existed."
He went on to defend the need
for theme houses and different
ethnic centers and programs.
"Those who critically charac
terize various campus groups as
students 'segregating' rather than
as students 'associating' choose to
construe the phenomenon as
alienation, rather than as associa
tion for a variety of purposes,
among them the exploration of
cultural identity," Casper said.
