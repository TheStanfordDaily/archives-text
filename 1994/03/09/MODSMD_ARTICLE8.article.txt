Abdelghani Attou may finally have found the free
housing that he has been looking for.
Once again, Attou — the man accused of defrauding
the University for housing by impersonating a student
— has been unable to escape the long arm of the law,
and new charges of immigration violations against
Attou make an early release from jail unlikely.
San Francisco International Airport police arrest
ed Attou Monday night for an alleged act of pick
pocketing, according to Stanford Police Sgt. John Mc-
Mullen.
Attou had been arrested Feb.
25 after living in Branner Hall
and Governor's Corner for 12
days without paying rent. He was
released the next day on $5,000
bail.
In the most recent incident, a
Stanford student was talking on
an airport phone at around 9
p.m. when he felt someone bump
against him. McMullen said that
the student saw Attou, who said,

"Excuse me." The student then
noticed his checkbook was miss
ing.
Realizing what had happened,
the student told airport police,
who found Attou with the
allegedly stolen checkbook,
McMullen said.
Attou will have more difficulty
getting out of jail this time.
Immigration and Naturalization
Service has placed a hold on
Attou for overstaying an Algeri
an visa which expired on Feb. 26
of this year, McMullen said.
Attou previously told people that
he was a citizen of Switzerland.
