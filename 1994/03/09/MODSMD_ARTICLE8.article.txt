Abdelghani Attou may finally have found the free
housing that he has been looking for.
Once again, Attou — the man accused of defrauding
the University for housing by impersonating a student
— has been unable to escape the long arm of the law,
and new charges of immigration violations against
Attou make an early release from jail unlikely.
San Francisco International Airport police arrest
ed Attou Monday night for an alleged act of pick
pocketing, according to Stanford Police Sgt. John Mc-
Mullen.
