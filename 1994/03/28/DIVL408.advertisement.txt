I INVITATION TO NOMINATE I
CANDIDATES FOR
THE JAMES W. LYONS
AWARD FOR SERVICE
The James W. Lyons Award for Service was established to recognize and
honor students of the Stanford community for service contributions
made by students from a variety of schools, departments, teams, clubs,
residences, and community projects. All enrolled students are eligible to
receive the award.
Selections are made on the basis of nominations from members of the
Stanford community: faculty, staff, and students. Nominations can be
made in the form of a letter addressed to Michael Jackson, Dean of
Students, 323 Old Union, Mail Code (3010). The award ceremony and
dinner will be held in June, 1994. The deadline for submitting nomina
tions for spring quarter is:
Friday, April 15,1994 — 5:00 p.m.
The Service Award program is a nice way to express appreciation to
some of the amazing student-citizens in our community. I hope you will
think of this program when you encounter such students.
