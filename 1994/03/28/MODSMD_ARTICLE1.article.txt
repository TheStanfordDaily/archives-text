# Double threepeat
## Record-setting men swim to third NCAA title 
### Kyle Utsumi Staff writer 
MINNEAPOLIS — Threepeat.
It's a phrase New York Knicks coach
Pat Riley coined and the Chicago Bulls
made famous. At the 1994 NCAA men's
swimming and diving championships at
the University Aquatics Center, Stan
ford completed a threepeat of its own,
claiming a third consecutive national
title. Although Stanford clung to a slim
one-point lead after the first of three
days, the Cardinal displayed its extraor
dinary depth in the final two days of com
petition, tallying 566.5 points to out-dis
tance runner-up Texas (445) and third
place Michigan (370).
The three straight national crowns
match the run of NCAA successes en
joyed by the 1985-87 Cardinal teams. It
is coach Skip Kenney's sixth national
title in 15 years at Stanford and the sev
enth overall for the Cardinal.
"This one was the toughest," Kenney
said. "I've talked all year about this
being the best team ever. They might
have thought this would be easy."
Although the team fell short of its sea

son-long goal of amassing the most
points in NCAA history (632), the Cardi
nal produced numerous outstanding
performances. Stanford made its intent
to repeat known immediately, as junior
Brian Retterer led off the '200-yard
freestyle relay by splitting a Stanford
record of 19.35 seconds. Senior team
mates Bill Schell and Tyler Mayfield and

sophomore Joe Hudepohl followed
Retterer's lead as the Cardinal
blazed to an American-record time
of 1:17.10.
After resting for the finals, Ret
terer and the Cardinal opened the
evening's session by lowering their
200 free relay record. Swimming
in a different order than in the
morning, Stanford won the event
with a time of 1:16.93.
"Bill has the fastest start,"
Kenney said. "We had him lead off
because of his quick reaction time.
Brian went second because we
wanted Tyler to have smooth
water."
May field had plenty of smooth
water courtesy of Schell and Ret
terer, whose split of 18.67 was the
fastest relay leg in history. Hude
pohl held off Auburn, Stanford's

closest challengers, with a 19.01
anchor leg.
"We've talked about this all
year," Schell said. "We wanted to
start the meet off with an Ameri
can record."
In addition to the records set by
the Stanford relay and Retterer,
Arizona's sophomore distance sen
sation Chad Carvin bested a nine
year-old American record in the
trials of the 500 free, then crushed
the U.S. Open and NCAA record
with a 4:11.59 in the finals.
Stanford's best individual event
of the night was the 50 free, won
by Retterer, with Hudepohl finish
ing second and Schell eighth. The
win was the first individual NCAA
title for Retterer, who red-shirted
last season because of a shoulder
injury. The 400 medley relay team
of senior Derek Weatherford, May
field, junior Ray Carey and Retter

er also captured gold to finish up
the day's racing.
After his busy day which netted
three NCAA championships, Ret
terer said, "It felt real good. Yes, I
did my part, but everyone swam
well on the relays. It was a total
team effort. The individual one
was sweet — I've been waiting for
that for a while."
Although the rest of the session
did not go quite as the Cardinal
had hoped, Kenney was not wor
ried about the score at the conclu
sion of the evening.
"I thought the relays were out
standing, but with the individual
events (500 free and 200 IM) we're
not really happy," he said. "We
expected to do a little better. Point
wise, we're exactly where we
thought we would be, but when
you don't swim great, you worry
about the other two days. The 200

free (Friday) will be a key event.
We haven't been in a team battle
in a while, and we're enjoying it
now."
It didn't take long to erase any
worries from Kenney's mind, as
the Cardinal's preliminary swims
placed at least one Stanford swim
mer in every individual event final
except for the 400 IM.
For the second straight night,
the finals session began with a
Cardinal relay team blowing out
the field, as Weatherford, May
field, Schell and Retterer won the
200 medley relay.
After the 400 IM, which saw
Florida's Greg Burgess continue
the assault on the American record
book by lowering his own record to
3:40.64, Texas led Stanford in the
team race by 18 points. In the next
event, the 100 butterfly, Cardinal
senior Eddie Farenti turned in a
47.97 to place sixth.
"Eddie was a pleasant sur
prise," Kenney said. "He's been
swimming long course in Canada,
so coming to swim short course, I
thought he might have lost some
of his edge. But Eddie's been to the
Olympic games (in 1992 for Cana
da). He knows how to race."
Parenti's points pulled the Car
dinal to within six of the
Longhorns heading into the 200
free, and true to Kenney's predic
tion, the event proved pivotal.
Swimming in the consolation heat,
junior Dan Kanner placed second,
to finish 10th overall. In the final
heat, Hudepohl took the race out
hard but was touched out by
Michigan's Gustavo Borges. Hude
pohl tied for second with Ugur
Taner of California.
"I didn't have a great morning
swim," Hudepohl said. "At night, I
wanted to get out fast. I used less
legs and picked up my stroke rate."
Also placing in the finals for
Stanford was Minnesota native
Scott Gagner. The sophomore,
who hails from Wayzata, finished
sixth.
"I knew Joe and [Texas' Josh]
Davis would get after it,"he said.
"I held on better tonight and got in
there on the touch at the end. I
swam high-school meets here (but]
this is much more exciting than
anything I've been to before."
Adding to the Cardinal's excite
ment, Stanford outscored the
Longhorns in the event, 36.5 to 17,
and the team had a lead it would
not relinquish. In fact, the 200 free
was just the beginning of the end
for Texas and any other would-be
challengers, as Stanford's 100
breaststrokers, then 100 backstro

kers put an end to any hopes of
dethroning the two-time national
champions.
Junior Kurt Grote led the qual
ifying in the 100 breast by turning
in a personal best 53.45 in the pre
lims. Mayfield, the defending
champion in the event, and senior
J.J. Freitag also secured spots in
the final with strong morning
swims. In the finals, it was May
field who got to the wall first in a
race in which a mere .62 seconds
separated first and eighth place.
Freitag finished third with Grote
fourth.
Mayfield's winning time, 53.73,
was well off his personal best of
53.07, yet the senior was elated
with the results.
"There comes a time when you
accept that you're not going to
jump in and break an American
record (one of Mayfield's goals for
the season)," he said. "You just
swim for place."
The 51 points earned by the
breaststrokers put Stanford com
fortably ahead of its competition.
Not to be undone, the Cardinal
backstroking corps of Retterer,
Weatherford and senior Trip
Zedlitz matched that point total in
the following event. The three fin
ished first, second and fifth respec
tively in the 100 back.
Stanford completed its second
day of work by slashing more than
two seconds off the school record
in the 800 free relay. The Cardinal
touched a close second behind
Michigan, the defending champion
in the event. The stellar team
effort allowed Stanford to leave
the pool with a whopping 98.5
point advantage over Texas.
After the session, Longhorn
coach Eddie Reese, who has led his
Texas teams to five NCAA titles,
expressed frustration about his
team's performance and admira
tion for the Cardinal's.
"Between last night and this
morning I didn't do something
right," Reese said. "We were slow
as a team."
When asked if he was conceding
the meet to Stanford, Reese replied,
"I don't think anyone has to do
that. This morning, Stanford got
nine people in the top eight for
finals. That's where the meet is
won and lost. They may not have all
been happy with their times, but
they swam for place. The only way
we could catch Stanford now is if I
cook for them tonight."
With the team title virtually in
hand, it was a spirited Cardinal
squad which cheered freshman
Kevin Radvany to a sixth-place fin

ish in the 1,650 free.
The event, which takes about
15 minutes, turned out to be the
most exciting of the weekend, as
Carvin raced the clock and won,
breaking ex-Stanford star Jeff
Kostoffs American record in a
time of 14.34.91. More than 2,000
screaming fans were on their feet
urging Carvin on for the final 200
yards, and the Aquatics Center
exploded when he hit the wall. For
his historic performances, Carvin
was named NCAA Swimmer of the
Year.
The crowd, still buzzing from
the 1,650, came alive again min
utes later as Weatherford edged
out a very close heat in the 200
back to claim the NCAA title. Ret
terer finished fourth.
"That was the greatest race I've
seen Derek swim," said ex-team
mate Rouse. "It was one of the
best races of the meet — if he
swam any differently, he wouldn't
have won."
In the 100 free, Stanford's lone
finalist, Hudepohl, also swam a
near perfect race, but was edged
for the third time by Borges. His
second-place finish was his third
runner-up performance in two
NCAAs. Because Borges is a
Brazilian national, however,
Hudepohl's swims were the fastest
turned in by an American colle
gian.
Following Hudepohl's race, the
breaststrokers once again out
classed the field, as Grote won the
race with Mayfield second. Freitag,
swimming perhaps his final com
petitive race, finished seventh.
"I'm ecstatic. It was a hard
race," Grote said. "I wanted to
get out ahead, and try to ignore
the competition. I just closed my
eyes on the turns and sprinted as
hard as I could between the
walls."
In the final individual race of
the meet, Carey fell .2 second
short of defending his NCAA title
in the 200 fly. Carey turned for
home slightly behind Taner, then
made a furious charge in the final
10 yards but was out-touched at
the wall. Parenti took the race out
fast, leading for part of the way
before finishing third in a personal
best time.
The 400 free relay of Hudepohl,
Retterer, Schell and Weatherford
put an exclamation point on the
Cardinal's team effort, breaking
the Stanford record in 2:51.41 — a
time better than the existing
American record. But Texas was
just a little bit faster, and the
Longhorns set a new American
record of 2:51.07.
"We got beat, but that (race)
was so exciting," Kenney said.
"I'm just so proud of our guys.
We couldn't have gone anv
faster."
And the feeling couldn't have
been any sweeter. Freitag, a
fifth-year senior, who opted to
return for another season, said,
"Obviously I'm thrilled. To come
back and win a third champi
onship is a once in a lifetime
experience."
Zedlitz, who helped the Stan
ford Class of '94 surpass USC's
Class of '67 as the highest scoring
class at an NCAA championship,
summed up his personal feelings.
"Right now, I'm very excited and
happy for the team. We did it
again. The first two days, my per
formances weren't good at all, but
the team success far outweighs
that. I came away with a great
feeling."
