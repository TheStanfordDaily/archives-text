# Recent incident raises question of gym's inclusiveness
##

A lesbian student who says she was recently
harassed while lifting weights in Arrillaga gym
will not file a formal complaint with the Universi
ty because "it's not something that would stick."
"It was a situation that was threatening, but it
would not hold up in any legal setting," said Anne
Tarver, a doctoral student in philosophy. "You
have to have a rock-solid case."
Tarver said she came forward to raise aware
ness that some females may be uncomfortable in
the gym environment. "I'd like to look at ways to
make the gym a more comfortable environment
for women in particular," she said.
However, a representative from the Depart
ment of Athletics said he didn't think incidents of
harassment are common. "This is the first time
that we've ever heard of anything like this happen
ing," said Assoc. Athletic Director Thomas Beck
ett. "The Athletics Department will continue to
make sure that people are comfortable using the
facilities ... if for any reason that isn't happening,
then we will take steps to correct the situation."
The Feb. 8 incident at the gym began when
Tarver, who was wearing a "Queer Nation" T
shirt, noticed a man "glaring at me in a rather
hateful manner," she said.
Tarver ignored the glare, but "he continued

giving me those rather hostile looks," she said.
When Tarver went to do some incline bench
presses, she selected the only available bench in the
room, which happened to be adjacent to the man's.
"He said, 'Somebody better move,' " Tarver
said. "I moved my bench as much as possible, even
though he had more space to move on his side.
"Then he said, 'I should just drop these
weights intentionally,' " Tarver said, adding that
he was holding very heavy dumbbells at the time.
The man did not drop the dumbbells, but Tarver
said she was upset by his threat.
Tarver said she was uncertain whether "the
kind of hostility that I encountered" was due to
her sexual orientation or her gender. "It seemed
like it was a reaction to my shirt, but it felt like the
hostility I had occasionally encountered for being
a woman when I worked on construction jobs.
"I felt and I think that it was clearly a threat, but
it would be ... my word against his," she said. It
was "unlikely that anyone saw the whole incident."
Although this was not the first time that such
an incident has happened to Tarver, she said,
"That level of overt hostility is rare. . . . Most peo
ple are fairly decent."
In response to the incident, gay and lesbian
community members organized a demonstration
at the gym the following week to show "that the
gym is an uncomfortable environment for a lot of
women," Tarver said.
