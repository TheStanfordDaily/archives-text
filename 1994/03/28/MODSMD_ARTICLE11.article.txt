## Violent storm hits the Southeast Tornado caves in roof of an Alabama church, 17 people killed 
### 
PIEDMONT, Ala. (AP) - A tornado
caved in the roof of a church crowded
with Palm Sunday worshipers, killing
17 people yesterday. Two other people
died as a series of twisters and violent
thunderstorms tore through the South
east.
A brick wall collapsed on a pew of
children wearing their new Easter out
fits and waiting to sing as part of a
pageant being performed when the tor
nado roared through the church about
11:30 a.m.
At least 90 people were injured,
authorities said. Three children were
among the dead.
Worshipers said they heard wind
against the church, then the lights went
out.
"One man ran down the aisle yelling
'Get on the floor!' " said worshiper

Elwanna Acker, 63. "Then the roof
came down. The woman right next to
me died."
"People were praying," she said.
"People were worrying about their
grandchildren."
A nursery filled with children in a
church wing did not collapse.
Sixteen bodies were found inside the
church, and one was found outside in a
van, Cherokee County sheriffs deputies
said.
About 140 people were in the church
five miles north of Piedmont in eastern
Alabama. Rescuers had feared others
were buried, but all were accounted for
after more than 100 searchers dug
through the rubble by hand and called
in a crane to lift the roof.
The storm knocked out power and
telephone service, hampering rescue

efforts. Passing motorists helped ferry
the injured to hospitals around Pied
mont, a rural town of 5,000 residents 72
miles west of Atlanta.
"It looked like a war zone," said Pied
mont resident Basil Penny.
The National Weather Service had
issued a tornado watch for the area ear
lier in the morning. The weather service
issued a warning saying a twister had
been spotted on the ground about the
time the roof collapsed.
Elsewhere in Alabama, tornadoes
killed one person at a park and another
in his car.
The severe storm system moved into
Georgia and South Carolina, with sever
al tornado touchdowns reported in
those states. Two homes were destroyed
and at least two people injured in Long
Creek, S.C.
