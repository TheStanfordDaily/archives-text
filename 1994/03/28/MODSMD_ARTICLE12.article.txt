SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)
— Government forces attacked Serb fight
ers in northern Bosnia yesterday, leading
the Serb leader to threaten a counterat
tack and hardened negotiating stance.
Bosnian radio claimed government
forces had captured key Bosnian Serb
positions near Maglaj, killing 70 Serb
fighters, and were advancing. There was
no confirmation of the report.

but claimed the attacks had been repelled.
Speaking to his Serbian Democratic
Party in Banja Luka, a Serb stronghold in
northern Bosnia, Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic said the government's
"spring offensive must be broken."
"If they do not stop this offensive, I will

order u counteroflensive and then they
shall not be able to get the territories they
would be able to by political negotiations,"
he said, according to Tanjug.

er half-penny (increase) waiting in the
wings," Lundberg said.
