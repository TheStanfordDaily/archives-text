## Editorial Grading professors Evaluation process can be made more effective for students and faculty 
### 
AT THE end of every quarter,
students return to the
grade-school ritual of bub
bling in little circles on Scantron
sheets, answering a handful of
vague questions on the quality of a
course and its professor.
These teaching evaluation forms
are supposed to help professors
evaluate their own performance
and give departments feedback on
the effectiveness of their courses.
But the forms as they are now
reveal little useful information.
Overly simplistic and relegated to
a last-minute exercise, they don't
elicit much thoughtful response.
The evaluation process, howev
er, does not have to be a tokenism.
Instead of asking students summa
ry questions, such as rating a pro
fessor's overall teaching perfor
mance, the forms should elicit com
ments on specific aspects of the
professor's teaching.
One example of such a detailed
form can be found in the School of
Engineering, which lists 16 differ
ent questions on its evaluation
forms. Topics include responsive
ness to student questions, availabil
ity outside the classroom, enthusi
asm for teaching, use of examples
and clarity of explanations.
This more detailed breakdown of
questions allows professors to bet
ter target specific areas for
improvement. In addition, it helps
students sort out the professor's
different qualities, rather than
lumping together the good with the
bad in one sweeping statement or
bubble.
Unfocused evaluation forms are
only part of the problem. There is
also a general lack of information
about the process — and especially
the results.
Few students are aware of what
happens to the forms after they

fill them out, or how important or
unimportant different depart
ments or professors view them.
Once completed, teaching evalu
ation forms are processed in the
Registrar's Office, which then
bounces back a summary sheet to
the professor and department
head. The professor also receives
the original forms.
Departments typically refer to
the information from evaluation
summaries when setting profes
sors' salaries, determining promo
tions and making nominations for
teaching awards, among other
activities.
While evaluation data may be
useful for professors and depart
ment chairs, students remain in
the dark. Indeed it is ironic that the
ones most directly affected by
teaching quality know the least
about it.
Students should be able to
access the wealth of information
teaching evaluation forms can pro
vide.
At many universities, they are
able to do so through student-pub
lished course guides that offer
practical and candid feedback
about classes and professors.
Though the ASSU had little suc
cess with its own such effort a few
years ago, the idea is certainly
worth trying again. Many students
would be willing to spend a few
bucks for a quality course guide
that offers plenty of straight talk
on a variety of classes.
Another way to share teaching
evaluations with students is to put
it on-line, perhaps as a service in
the Folio system.
Students would benefit even
more if evaluations were handed
out in the middle of the quarter,
before they become useless for
those who are already in the
class.
In any case, teaching evaluation
needs to be changed to provide
more informative feedback to more
people. And these changes would
ultimately serve to enhance the
way the University goes about its
primary mission: teaching.
