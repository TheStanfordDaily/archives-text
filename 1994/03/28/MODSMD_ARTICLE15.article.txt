## Your Stanford love affair 
### 
YOU LIKE me. You really like me.
This is not a pretentious lead. I
have been inspired by the Academy
Awards so much, I thought I needed
something as provocative as this to grab
your attention. Besides, I have watched
so much of that trash they call "hype," I
can honestly say I am more stupid than I
was before. Thank God I graduated.
Actually the lead has a purpose. And
no, it is not something to help recall your
favorite Sally Field moment. Call me
crazy, but I'm partial to her days as TV's
oh-so-perky and lovable "Gidget."
While you are undoubtedly reading
this as you prepare to fork over a cool six
grand to the memory of Iceland and Jane,
missing lunch because you have to buy
that reasonably priced Psych 1 text or sit
ting in your office wondering, "What the
hell am I doing inside on a day like
today?", allow me to remind you of a
springtime romance that might need
some rekindling.
This is an affair with more twists than
all the cappuccinos in any one of those
damned Palo Alto cafes.
This is your love affair with Stanford.
If you're young, chances are you still
like it here. If you're an upperclassman,
that time you just spent in Cabo just
wasn't long enough. And if you are
ancient like me, you can't stand this place
anymore.
Truth is, I've been here too long. To
put it into the proper context, when I
was a freshman so were [Baltimore Ori

oles outfielder] Jeffrey Hammonds and
Janet Evans. The leader of the commu
nist world, Mikhail Gorbachev, dropped
by to see if he could borrow a cup of
sugar, and earthquakes were our reality,
not theirs.
When 1 was a freshman, two words:
D. K. Even still, I missed Todd "the
God" Lichti, bonfires that raged out of
control and a Lake Lag that was exactly
that.
Now what do we got? Well, there are
graduate students who have decided to
crawl out from under their rocks and
make life miserable for some of the
undergrads who are trying to have a little
fun around here, newspapers that whine
over a harmless parody and axes that cut
budgets and not Bears. It looks pretty
bleak.
Honestly, the only reason for anyone
to dish out Stanford's $50 application fee
is if you're dead set on becoming an engi
neer or want to play football for Bill
Walsh. It sounds sad doesn't it? But the
ol' Farm just doesn't spark me like it
used to.
This is not some jaded senior-speak
from a person whose job prospects in the
next few months are dismal at best. I
wish I could be as eloquent as [Daily
columnist! N'Gai Croal is about some of
this, but I really did like the first three
years of my time or so. I don't want to
leave pissed off.
If you read Joel Stein's forum (haven't
I been Mr. Namedropper, by the way)

three weeks ago, you got the sense that a
Stanford diploma is well worth the
$100,000 price tag.
Unbelievably, Stanford grads do land
on their feet and end up quite successful.
Then why is it that as alumni, we tend to
be one of the most dissatisfied groups in
the nation? It all seems a little odd,
doesn't it? Maybe they'll outlaw
slip'n'slides at graduation. That'd be a
hoot.
We really can't start the new quarter
on such a sour note, though.
All the old standbys are there I guess.
Sunken Diamond's gates will be open all
spring long. Tara has given us yet
another reminder that indeed two gen
ders play the sport of basketball.
And the weather makes guys rethink
that whole "nine out of ten girls . . ."
thing, and makes the girls beg the guys
to put their shirts back on.
Hold everything! I just remembered
there is one thing that can get Stanford
off the schneid. The border is in order.
Taco Bell is coming to the biggest Taco
Bell stand in Northern California. I stand
corrected.

Jesse Johannesen will always love Flicks,
the breakfasts they serve at Tresidder and
a couple repeats of "All Right Now."
