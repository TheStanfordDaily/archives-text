A MAN VERJEE'S "finding" (Stan
ford Review, Feb. 14) that Phi
Beta Kappa includes few Mexican-
American and black students is a rare
accomplishment: it is at once the nastiest
and most empty-headed piece of research
I have seen in 23 years at Stanford.
Empty-headed? The positive correla
tion between socio-economic status —
privilege — and quantitative measures
for academic performance is very old
news. I am reminded of the story about

the researcher who applies for a
$200,000 grant to explore sin in Chicago,
when any cab driver could take him to it
in five minutes. Verjee has spent a lot of
time demonstrating the obvious.
Nasty? Most assuredly. On the basis
of his research, Verjee concludes, "Many
of these [minorityl students may be bet
ter off at another, less demanding uni
versity, where the curriculum and the
student competition is more suited to
their abilities, and where their destinies

are not preset for mediocrity by a mis
guided, albeit well-intentioned, admis
sions policy."
I do not think the answer to Verjee
is, as N'Gai Croal facetiously suggested
in the March 4 Daily, to pit white stu
dents who score less well on quantita
tive measures against higher-scoring
Asian students. The answer which fair
minded people in and out of Phi Beta
Kappa can easily see is that test results
should not be confused with real value.

On the basis of such tests, Provost
Condoleezza Rice was once told she was
not college material. A Stanford com
prised only of students who score well
on quantitative tests might appeal to
the Stanford Review, but I for one
would rather see a boat leaving Stan
ford filled with high-scoring snobs than
with the people on the receiving end of
Verjee's insults.
