# Academic integrity is threatened by merging of different disciplines
## 
### 
Stanford experts in a wide variety of
literatures fear that the fresh set of deans
in the School of Humanities and Sciences
are so eager to resurrect a pipe dream of
yesteryear (jumbling together several dis
tinct departments and programs for neg
ligible infrastructure savings) that the
very principle of faculty governance is
threatened.
Many literature professors have
already judged unworkable the notion
that Stanford can simply impose on
them tasks keyed to some synthetic
universalism which they reject intel-

Icctually.
The result would be severe damage
to the coherence, visibility and avail
ability of already established majors
dealing with specific important cul
tures (e.g. French, Chinese, etc.), as
well as to specific interdisciplinary
approaches (e.g. Comparative Litera
ture and Modern Thought and Litera
ture), and would undermine further
creative synergy. Our claim to work
for an international university would
quickly seem laughable to our domes
tic rivals and colleagues around the
globe.
Why must the literary studies facul
ty at Stanford face the equivalent of
Galileo's dilemma, when he was forced
to agree with the Pope and favored Car
dinals, not with his own informed expe
rience, on the pursuit of physics?

To date the administration has not
articulated any alternate academic
vision for our fields that can stand up
to the scrutiny of a world audience.
Would a dean's office dominated by
humanists browbeat our science depart
ments in the hopes of squashing their
disciplines together in artificial mar
riages? Or is this, too, possible at Stan
ford?
A number of faculty and student
demonstrations of solidarity with the
beleaguered humanities are already
planned, including the April 6 seminar
"Humanities and Arts Memorial." It is
time for humanities professors to inform
the broader academic public of our view of
the situation.
