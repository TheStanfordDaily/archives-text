# Campus Currents and ASSU get thumbs down
## 
### 
Given the general fiscal management
of the student side of the ASSU, its
exorbitant banking fees and its recent
deficit budgeting, I find the publication
of the self-serving, out-of-date and
extremely uninformative Campus Cur
rents ludicrous and offensive.
Remember this organization has
tabled every serious attempt at reform
— exactly what its beleaguered con
stituency wants — always under the
guise of "seeking the best possible solu
tion." As any politico knows, behind
quibbles over quality lies at best inertia
and at worst rank corruption.
