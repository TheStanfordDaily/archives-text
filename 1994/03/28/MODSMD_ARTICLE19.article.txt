## Grace Lee On parody, censorship and humor: setting the record straight 
### 
IN A COUNTRY founded on the
tenets of free expression, few actions
grab headlines and fire passions the
way censorship does.
But the potency of the term can be
just as easily diffused when, in a burst of
First Amendment fanaticism, legitimate
actions are carelessly mislabeled as "cen
sorship," as they were earlier this month
in the confusion that ensued over a fake
issue of The Daily.
On Thursday, March 10, the Cha
parral published a parody of The Daily
and distributed it throughout campus.
The previous day, The Daily published
its special end-of-the-quarter issue. Both
readers and advertisers expect this issue,
which is several times larger than usual,
to be available at Daily delivery points
until the end of the quarter.
In distributing its parody Dailies, the
Chaparral often placed its newspapers on
top of these real Dailies, in newspaper
stands that are the property of The
Daily.
In some cases, hundreds of real
Dailies had been thrown away. At some

of The Daily's main distribution points,
such as the post office and History Cor
ner, healthy stacks that had been there
the night before were conveniently relo
cated to nearby recycling bins by morn
ing.
The Daily could have laughed off the
whole incident — after all, the fake Daily
was supposed to be funny — but we also
have a responsibility to assure our read
ers and advertisers that what they find
in a Daily distribution box is, in fact, a
Stanford Daily.
So, a handful of Daily staff members
collected the impostor newspapers from
our boxes — an act that Chappie mem
bers conceded in local r'*ws reports was
"valid" and "legal."
Overall, we removed only a fraction —
about 1,000 — of the 10,000 fake news
papers the Chapparral printed.
We then redistributed these papers
throughout campus, keeping them out of
our boxes. Those papers that were inad
vertently removed from non-Daily distri
bution boxes were returned directly to
Chaparral staff members. No papers

were destroyed or withheld.
But many people began to miscon
strue our actions as censorship, quickly
attracting a local media circus. Passion
ately recounting episodes of newspaper
confiscation on other college campuses —
where students or administrators have
angrily dumped newspapers to protest
their contents — even some Daily staff
members asked, "How could we?"
Indeed, neither insult nor injury will ever
qualify the mass censorship of a newspa
per.
However, The Daily's actions had
nothing to do with censorship. What was
erroneously labeled as such in this case
was the legitimate protection of property
and private interests.
Had the Chaparral spoofed another
publication — and placed counterfeit San
Francisco Chronicles in Chronicle news
stands, or fake Bookstore Gazettes in
Bookstore distribution boxes — these
publications would likely have taken sim
ilar action.
Because the issue at hand wasn't
humor. We get a kick out of parody our

selves; we do our own every April Fool's,
and we even spoofed UC-Berkeley's Daily
Californian several years ago.
Though we found the Chappie's Daily
refreshingly amusing, we had little time
to sit back and laugh. We were too busy
rescuing stacks of real Dailies from recy
cling bins and fielding calls from con
fused readers, who thought our issue
looked a bit strange but couldn't figure
out why.
Apparently, the Chaparral had gotten
so caught up in producing an authentic
looking Daily that they neglected to
clearly mark it as parody until halfway
through the issue.
More importantly, could readers have
ascertained that the Daily staff had no
hand in producing the fake Daily? Not
when it was found in a Daily box, with
several marks of a real Daily — including
the masthead, bylines, format and copy
righted photos — scattered throughout.
Parody is all about bending the rules.
Even the Supreme Court demonstrated
this when it recently ruled that a parody
by the rap group 2 Live Crew constituted

"fair use" of copyrighted material.
However, this does not mean that par
ody is absolved from rules altogether,
something the Chappie will hopefully
keep in mind when they next attempt
parody.
The Chappie's fake March 10 Daily
was an ambitious effort — one that even
had some of us fooled for a minute. The
campus found it hilarious, and so did we.
It is unfortunate, though, that The
Daily's response to the parody's less
humorous aspects was misidentified as
censorship, a claim that can only help to
hinder free speech and detract from the
credibility of future claims.
And it is unfortunate that such
refreshing humor was achieved through
the reckless disregard for others — read
ers who were unable to get the real news,
advertisers who expected the paper to be
available for longer than a day, staff
members who spent the better part of
Dead Week producing the issue, and The
Daily, whose property was improperly
used to lend perhaps too much legitimacy
to what was, after all, just a joke.
