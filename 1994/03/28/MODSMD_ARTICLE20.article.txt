# Bike thief could strike out
## 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
An alleged bike thief caught at
Stanford may be the first criminal
in Santa Clara County to serve a
minimum sentence of 25 years
under the new "three strikes and
you're out" law.
Jed Harlan Miller, a 33-year
old San Francisco resident, could
be sentenced under the new legis
lation if found guilty of stealing
two bicycles at Stanford almost
three weeks ago.
The three-strikes law, which
went into effect March 7, mandates
a minimum sentence of 25 years up
to life in jail for criminals convicted
of three felony offenses.
Miller was arrested by Stanford
police after a brief car chase in the
early morning hours of March 9,
according to Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer. A deputy began
the pursuit when attempting to
stop Miller's pickup truck for
speeding near Wilbur Hall.
After abandoning the truck near

the College Terrace apartment
building, Miller attempted to evade
the deputy in a foot pursuit,
Niemeyer said. After sighting
Miller hidden behind a car, Deputy
Bob Henderson was able to run him
down before Miller could get away.
In the back of the truck Miller
was driving, police found two bicy
cles, both reported stolen by stu
dents living in Xanadu House and
Rains, Niemeyer said, adding that
Miller admitted to stealing the
bicycles at the time of his arrest.
The truck was also reported as
stolen from the Berkeley area and
was valued at $200 — less than the
bikes' total value of $1,100.
Miller has prior convictions of
burglary and assault with a deadly
weapon from Sacramento, as a well
as a burglary conviction from a
crime committed in San Francisco,
according to Niemeyer. He had
been paroled less than a month
earlier for the San Francisco
offense, Niemeyer said.
If Miller had committed the
alleged crime three days earlier

before the law took effect, the maxi
mum sentence he could have
received would have been three
years and eight months in jail, with
an additional year for each former
imprisonment, Niemeyer said.
After the arrest, San Francisco
police searched an apartment that
Miller was renting and found sev
eral allegedly stolen bicycles and
other items, as well as journals
which chronicled his criminal
activity, Niemeyer said.
One of Miller's written entries
told of a confrontation at UC-Berke
ley where a student caught Miller
attempting to steal his bicycle.
Miller wrote that he told the stu
dent he had lost his bike key. The
Cal student responded angrily and
wanted to call the police. Miller then
pulled a knife on the student and
left the scene, he wrote.
Berkeley police have also filed a
complaint against Miller that falls
under the three-strikes law for car
theft, and have begun investigating
the written crime accounts,
Niemeyer said.
