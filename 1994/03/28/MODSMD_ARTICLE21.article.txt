# Dalai Lama to speak in April
## 
### 
Exiled Tibetan leader Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th
Dalai Lama, will be on campus April 19-20 to
participate in two faculty seminars and to
address the general Stanford community.
Memorial Church is sponsoring the Dalai
Lama's visit, his first to Stanford. He was sched
uled to appear in October 1992, but postponed
the visit because of poor health.
The Dalai Lama became Tibetan head of state
in 1950, at the age of 15. He fled Tibet in 1959
with scores of his countrymen after a revolt
against Chinese occupying forces failed.

Since then he has lived in exile in India, and
has become an international spokesperson for
religious tolerance and non-violence. He was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.
The Dalai Lama's public address will take
place at Memorial Church on the 19th. Tickets
will be available to all current Stanford faculty,
students and staff through a lottery system to be
announced in the next few days.
The seminars will address issues relating to
religion, science and society. Several prominent
Stanford professors are scheduled to participate.
