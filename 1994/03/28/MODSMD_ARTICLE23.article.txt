# Retterer sets records

MINNEAPOLIS — Atlas would have been proud.
After the first day of the NCAA Men's Swimming and Diving
Championships, Stanford clung to a tender one-point lead over
arch-rival Texas. Sixty of the Cardinal's 157 points were due to
the efforts of Stanford junior Brian Retterer.
*He's probably tired sJler carrying 18 guys on his back," said
Cardinal head coach Skip Kenney aft er the first day of competi
tion.
His day's accomplishments would be considered a good meet
for other entire teams. Retterer began the morning session by
leading off the 200-yard freestyle relay with a blistering 19.34-sec
ond swim, setting the school record in the 50 freestyle in the pro
cess. This start gave his relay a lead it would not relinquish as it
set a new American record with a time of 1:17.10.
Three events later Retterer
hopped back into the pool and
swam a 19.49 50 freestyle, giving
him the top seed for the evening's
finals. And, to end a perfect morn
ing, the junior led off the 400
medley relay with an American
record 45.74 in the 100 back
stroke.
Two school records. Two
American records. Not a bad two
hours.
"He's swimming on another
planet," Kenney said.
The night's finals added to
Retterer's awards collection. He
won the 50 freestyle, thereby gar
nering his first NCAA individual
title. Later, swimming the
freestyle leg of the 400 medley
relay, he teamed with Derek
Weatherford, Tyler Mayfleld and
Ray Carey to take home that relay
championship.
His 46.72 split time in the pre
lims of the 400 medley relay made
him the first man to break the 47-
second barrier in the event.

Most astoundingly, though,
Retterer swam the second leg of
the 200 freestyle relay and
touched the wall after his 50 stint
in a time of 18.67 — the fastest 50
split ever, but not an American
record because it was aided by a
relay start.
"Brian Retterer has the best
relay starts I've ever seen," said
teammate Joe Hudepohl. "He's so
fast under water anyway that
with the relay start momentum
he's incredible."
This relay of Retterer, Hude
pohl, Bill Schell and Mayfield
broke the American record the
quartet had set only five hours
earlier and gave Retterer his third
trip to the gold medal stand in as
many events.
Retterer's next two days were
no less impressive. On the second
day he garnered yet another
championship with 46.07 swim in
the 100 backstroke, which was no
surprise considering that he set
the American record in the event
the day before. He also added a
fifth title by combining with May
field, Weatherford and Schell to
nab the 200 medley relay gold.
On Saturday Retterer collect

ed two more ribbons to become
the highest point gatherer in the
entire meet. In the 200 back
stroke he finished fourth, a little
over a second behind champion
Weatherford. Finally, in the 400
freestyle relay Retterer swam
the second leg of a relay that
broke the American record, only
to lose to a blazing Texas quar
tet.
Retterer ended the most
important meet of the season
with five first-place finishes, one
second place finish and a fourth.
The five golds were one less than
the record for championships, set
by former teammate Jeff Rouse in
1992.
"The thing about Brian is that
when he gets to the big meet, he's
probably one of the most confi
dent swimmers that I have ever
known," Rouse said.
That confidence took a beat
ing, though, when Retterer seri
ously dislocated his shoulder last
year during practice. He had to
red-shirt the season, and some
thought the injury marked the
end of his career.
However, as last weekend's
meet attests, Retterer fought the

injury and grew even stronger.
"The thing that's incredible
about him is how a relatively
small guy can come up with that
kind of speed," said Peter Daland,
a former USC coach who guided
the Trojans to nine NCAA team
titles in his 35-year tenure. "He
has quickness of action and reac
tion that is absolutely beyond
belief."
That quickness garnered tro
phies in an unusual pair of
strokes. Traditionally, champi
onship backstrokers and
freestylers are rather mutually
exclusive. But, as Retterer exem
plifies, these two have recently
become more unified.
"It's become more and more
apparent that you need the same
qualities to excel at these two
strokes — a very good kick and
good ankle flexibility," said James
"Doc" Councilman, a former Indi
ana swim coach who is one of the
most respected men in the sport.
Beyond confidence and ankle
flexibility, the secret to Retterer's
success is pretty simple. As
Daland pointed out, "he has one
big advantage — he's swimming
on the best team in the meet."
