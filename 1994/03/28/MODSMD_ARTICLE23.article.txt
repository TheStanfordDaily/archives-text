MINNEAPOLIS â€” Atlas would have been proud.
After the first day of the NCAA Men's Swimming and Diving
Championships, Stanford clung to a tender one-point lead over
arch-rival Texas. Sixty of the Cardinal's 157 points were due to
the efforts of Stanford junior Brian Retterer.
*He's probably tired sJler carrying 18 guys on his back," said
Cardinal head coach Skip Kenney aft er the first day of competi
tion.
His day's accomplishments would be considered a good meet
for other entire teams. Retterer began the morning session by
leading off the 200-yard freestyle relay with a blistering 19.34-sec
ond swim, setting the school record in the 50 freestyle in the pro
cess. This start gave his relay a lead it would not relinquish as it
set a new American record with a time of 1:17.10.
